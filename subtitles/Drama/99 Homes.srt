1
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,195
Yeah.

2
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,488
Oh.

3
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,323
Oh, Jesus, no.

4
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,950
This isn't a good time.

5
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,703
Rick?

6
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,457
- Mr. Carver?
- Yeah, I'll be with you in a second.

7
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,460
Huh? Well, I'll tell you what you do.

8
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:12,172
Remove the meter, turn the water off,
and let them sweat for a couple of days.

9
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,216
Then you ride in
on your white fucking horse,

10
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,093
tell them you have a cash buyer

11
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,470
and Richard Carver
can approve a short sale.

12
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,098
You want me to spell it for you?
R-I-C...

13
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,643
OK, well, I can't hold your hand
while you give them a hand job, Bill.

14
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,645
Just get me the property.

15
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,316
Yes, John, Officer Dudura, you have
my court order signed by the judge.

16
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,068
What can I do for you?

17
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,237
You're the bank's realtor
on this eviction.

18
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,699
I need an official statement.
What happened and why?

19
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,743
Well, Dudura, it's a real shame
cos we arrived here with two pizzas

20
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,163
for Mr. Kadwell, the property owner,

21
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,165
but he didn't want anchovies,

22
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,750
so he went into the house,
pulled out a gun

23
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,044
and he blew his brains out.

24
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,506
And that set off Mrs. Kadwell
who was expecting Chinese for dinner.

25
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,093
You're talking about a man
who just killed himself.

26
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:05,017
I am the last man who knocked
on Patrick Kadwell's door,

27
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,643
in his life.

28
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,979
That is his wife of 15 years, Samantha,

29
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,648
his daughters,
Dylan, 6, Paige, 11.

30
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,568
What official statement
can encapsulate

31
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,487
the tragic absurdity
of this fucked-up situation?

32
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,407
I can't bring him back to life.
Stop wasting my time.

33
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,036
Yeah?

34
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,621
No, I'm fine, honey.

35
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,832
Turn the TV off,
keep the girls away from the internet.

36
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,042
Er...

37
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,044
I got a call. Yeah.

38
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,921
Hello?

39
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,632
No, no, no.
You ride that up to 200.

40
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,468
220 tops.
No more than 10% down.

41
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,179
7.5% makes me sing.
Get the Miguels ready.

42
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,097
It's 2 grand a month
in interest alone.

43
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,183
We got to flip this thing.
Get back to me.

44
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,938
Call office.

45
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,523
Have we got anything else, boss?

46
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,401
Next eviction's Tuesday.
Natalia will call you.

47
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,736
Roger that.

48
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,451
- 'Rick Carver Realty.'
- Talk to me. My world's upside down.

49
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,537
'I'm emailing your revised itinerary.
And Jerry called again...'

50
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,498
Jerry's full of shit.
Keep talking.

51
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,501
'The Sutton Place high-rise came up.
The UD's in order.

52
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,254
'What do you want me to tell Elliot?'

53
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,257
No, no!

54
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,264
Please!

55
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,455
Yo, Nash, you can stop working now.
We're done. We're done.

56
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,999
- What?
- Hey!

57
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,002
Listen up!

58
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,965
The buyer didn't qualify.
We're shut down.

59
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,217
- What about payment?
- We don't get paid.

60
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,177
For 2 weeks
we've been working for free.

61
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,264
All this from roof to cement
is for nothing.

62
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,182
Stop working!

63
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,809
Put the hammer down, man.

64
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,562
Unplug everything, wrap it up.
Let's go home.

65
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,980
No dinero.

66
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,692
That looks like the United States
upside down, but flipped this way.

67
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,570
- It actually does.
- Connor?

68
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,904
Connor!

69
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,699
- We were just looking at the countries.
- Connor!

70
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,702
- We're naming the countries.
- It's our time. We're up.

71
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,454
- Gotta go.
- See you.

72
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,788
Bye.

73
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,708
Who was that?

74
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,044
- Who was that?
- That's my friend Alex from school.

75
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,340
- You dropped this.
- Good catch.

76
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:45,010
Your Honour, he missed 3 payments
and is underwater over 80 grand.

77
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,721
The bank can have a buyer in place
within 30 days.

78
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,058
- Did you in fact miss 3 payments?
- Yes, sir, but I was told to.

79
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,436
2 departments at the same bank
were telling me opposing things

80
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,647
and then, just recently,
I got a final notice for eviction.

81
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,567
We'd like to get
this property off the market.

82
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,779
- I see no reason to hold up the sale.
- They told me not to pay.

83
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,491
And that's why I'm behind.
They told me not to pay.

84
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,328
While I sympathise with your situation
I have 40,000 cases like this

85
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,913
backed up behind yours.

86
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,541
Final judgment granted.
I'm ordering you to vacate the premises.

87
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:20,170
That's my family home, Your Honour.
I was born and raised in that home.

88
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,924
He was born and raised there too.
He's my son, Connor.

89
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,510
Please don't do this.
We've lived there our whole lives.

90
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,137
My mum runs her business
out of that home.

91
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,348
That's our second source
of income right now.

92
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,974
- Is this your son?
- That's my son.

93
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,684
He should be in school and not here.

94
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,937
He's gonna lose his school,
with all due respect.

95
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,190
Sun United Bank versus R. Rogers.

96
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,904
- Give me a bit more time, please.
- Please remove Mr. Nash.

97
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,448
Your Honour, I just need a bit more time.

98
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,118
I need a bit more time.
Excuse me for a second.

99
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,036
I need you to follow me now.

100
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,747
You have 30 days
to file an appeal.

101
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,834
- Bailiff, please remove Mr. Nash.
- I need you to follow me now, sir.

102
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,419
Right now.

103
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,722
Where are we going to stay
if we lose our home?

104
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,353
- We're not gonna lose the home, bud.
- How do you know?

105
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,148
The cops are coming back.

106
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,733
I just wanna know
how you're gonna pay for it.

107
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,110
Connor.

108
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,450
Connor, I'm gonna figure it out, OK?

109
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,661
That judge gave us 30 days.
Ain't no one taking the home from us.

110
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,706
I'm gonna win this.
I'm gonna figure it out, simple as that.

111
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,915
We're good.

112
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,308
1 hour.

113
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,188
Hey, Bo.

114
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,691
I got that new blade for your skill saw.
I'll bring it over tonight.

115
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,610
- OK.
- You be careful, Connor.

116
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,862
- Got a new scooter?
- Yeah.

117
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,531
Hey, Mum.
So, tell me everything.

118
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:15,702
- Did they give you a lawyer?
- Mum, it's the same story.

119
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,830
Same story with the bank guys.
It's the same story everywhere we go.

120
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,457
We have to find a lawyer.

121
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,627
I'm just trying to understand
what this 30-day thing means.

122
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,588
Does that mean the eviction's
not gonna happen tomorrow?

123
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:30,425
- The judge told you. It's 30 days.
- 30 days to file for an appeal.

124
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:34,304
It's a judge, it's not a bartender.
We're in good shape.

125
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,807
My name is Dennis Nash
and I'm looking for representation.

126
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,144
I understand that you guys
sometimes do not need a retainer.

127
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,982
When you went through
what you went through,

128
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,069
you found someone pro bono.
I'm wondering if he's gonna help...

129
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:53,782
Lost is to found
as outside is to indoors, inside...

130
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,701
And what's another example?
Here you go.

131
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,495
- Have some salad.
- Black and white.

132
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,413
Black and white.

133
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,165
What's another one?
Give me one more.

134
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,962
4540189.
Please give us a call back.

135
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,764
I don't know
what to say to him sometimes.

136
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,100
I was so young when I had you.

137
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,895
I feel like you've had to raise me.

138
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,360
You know just what to say.

139
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,421
Borrow against Blair Street
to cover Via Alizar.

140
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,755
'Good.'

141
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,092
- I'll flip that this quarter.
- 'And London at Code Enforcement?'

142
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:58,638
I got a short sale for that cocksucker.
I'll email you the details.

143
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,223
- 'OK.'
- All right.

144
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:04,019
Afternoon, boss.
Love the new ride.

145
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,897
- Range Rover HSE.
- Is this the Nash eviction?

146
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,275
Yeah. Anyone home?

147
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:14,613
I'm not sure, but his vehicle is home,
so I'm assuming he is.

148
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,867
All right, let's get to it.

149
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,079
- Morning, y'all.
- How's it going?

150
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,348
He's at the window.

151
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,227
Sheriff's department.
Come to the door.

152
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,323
- What?
- Sheriffs are here.

153
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,161
Why are they here?

154
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,708
- You need to come to the door.
- He saw you.

155
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,379
They saw you through the window.
Just answer it. We just got to explain it.

156
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,381
Oh, come on.
Don't fucking do this.

157
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,344
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.

158
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,971
I'm Deputy Anderson
with the Sheriff's department.

159
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,307
We're here to serve you
a court-ordered eviction.

160
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,309
- OK, well...
- So, ma'am,

161
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,521
do you have any weapons on your body
or anywhere in the house?

162
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,440
- No, no, no, no. Not us.
- Mr. Carver?

163
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,442
Good morning.
My name's Rick Carver.

164
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,070
- I'm a licensed real estate broker.
- Mr. Carver.

165
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,238
Hi. Lynn.

166
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,573
And, er, I'm very sorry to tell you

167
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,411
that this home has been foreclosed on
and officially transferred to the bank.

168
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,456
- I need you to vacate the premises.
- I understand what you're saying.

169
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,916
And I've... I've... I've...

170
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,876
We've been getting
our eviction notices.

171
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,003
I was in court yesterday

172
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,298
and the judge informed me
that I got 30 days

173
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,843
to file for an appeal
and that's what I intend to do.

174
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,930
If you have an emergency stay signed
by the judge, you're welcome to remain.

175
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,642
I got a question. You guys didn't get
any rescheduling of the eviction date?

176
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,270
What I've received is a court order
signed by a judge.

177
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,189
It says you are to vacate
these premises today.

178
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,067
- We were scared of this.
- This home is owned by the bank.

179
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:20,155
- This is the information that we have.
- And we're sorry to waste your time.

180
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:24,367
My office offered you a $3500
cash-or-keys settlement from the bank

181
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,704
which would have given you time
to vacate the premises and you refused.

182
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,247
- Yes, sir.
- We didn't refuse.

183
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,750
- We tried to save our home.
- We were trying to save it.

184
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,127
This is a very painful time, I know.

185
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,881
It's a difficult thing to carry through on,
for me as well.

186
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,176
But the time has come.
You have to leave your property.

187
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,887
You are trespassing right now.
You are breaking the law.

188
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,639
Sir, this is our home
so we just need a few minutes.

189
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,768
We're going in circles here
so I'll let the sheriffs take care of it.

190
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,436
- Randy?
- All right, sir.

191
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:55,523
We've got a judge, sir,
and a lawyer who told us we can stay.

192
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,901
- Is this your mum?
- Yeah, this is my mum.

193
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,029
I'm gonna need you and your mum
to step off the property now.

194
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:05,492
You know what? If you all can
come back tomorrow same time

195
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,495
and if we don't have the papers,
we don't have the proof,

196
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,455
- then we will leave.
- We have a lawyer.

197
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,541
- We got it all figured out.
- Just give us a day.

198
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,835
We can dance together,
but we can't talk together.

199
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,713
- OK. All right, sir, we need a day.
- Do not close the door.

200
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,174
- We need a day.
- Listen, this is what I'm gonna do.

201
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,259
- Do not close the door.
- We need a day.

202
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,387
- This is my home. I can do what I want.
- I will give you two minutes

203
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,473
to pack whatever belongings you need

204
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:32,185
- Cash, chequebook, medicines.
- No, this is not happening.

205
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,771
- Yeah, this is happening.
- No, this is not happening.

206
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,649
I'm getting my cell phone
so I can get the lawyer on the phone.

207
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,944
- Ma'am? Ma'am?
- Excuse me, sir.

208
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,780
- I'm just walking by, sir.
- I don't know what this is.

209
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,616
We can't let someone out of our sight
once we start an eviction.

210
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,827
- Please don't come into my house.
- Listen to me.

211
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,120
There are two ways
that we can do this.

212
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,290
Right? An easy way which is
you do what you're told when asked.

213
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,252
The other way is
that I take you and your mum to jail.

214
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,878
Do you want
your mum to go to jail?

215
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,673
What I'd like you to do
is take advantage of the 2 minutes,

216
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,882
gather what you need,

217
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,718
cash, cheque books, medicines,
things that you need...

218
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,013
Excuse me, sir, would you mind
stepping outside of the property?

219
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,475
Listen to me, sir.
Let me put it to you this way.

220
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,644
- Excuse me.
- This isn't your home, son.

221
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,479
Mr. Carver?
Excuse me.

222
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:20,650
- Mr. Carver?
- According to Florida statute 801.08

223
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:24,028
- I have the authority...
- Sir, we have the right to an attorney.

224
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,447
Right? Then why
are you coming into our house?

225
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,867
Somebody forgot to call you,
we don't get a lawyer?

226
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,785
It's better not to get emotional, ma'am.

227
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,913
- You're kicking us out of our house.
- Please, OK? Please!

228
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,124
Ma'am,
please don't ask questions.

229
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,585
- Please!
- Enough of this. Let's go.

230
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,837
Get what you need to get,
then you need to go.

231
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,465
- Let's go. No more of this.
- Sir, I don't need your help.

232
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,259
OK? I can take a minute.

233
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,761
Do you need to follow a woman
into her bedroom?

234
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,350
I got a full house here.

235
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,729
I'm gonna have to be late
to the next one. I know.

236
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,149
It's just department policy.
Money, chequebook.

237
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,110
- Things like wallets, pictures.
- I'm trying to get pictures!

238
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,112
- Does he have to stand there?
- Yes, sir.

239
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,532
He has to fucking stand there
while she packs up her underwear?

240
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,700
Is that right?

241
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,620
Dennis, please!
It's policy.

242
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,005
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

243
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,507
I got to keep you in my sight, ma'am.
Sorry about that.

244
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,804
Anyway, ma'am, just take
the most important things.

245
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,064
What else, Mum?

246
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,693
Can I ask if it says 2 minutes
on your clipboard?

247
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,529
The 2 minutes is a courtesy.
Let her take the plant.

248
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,615
- You don't need it.
- The 2 minutes is what?

249
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,200
- A courtesy.
- Oh, my God!

250
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,035
You're trespassing right now.

251
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,913
I know it's painful to hear it,
but it's the truth.

252
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,749
This is our home.

253
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,504
- Oh, my God.
- Anything else, ma'am?

254
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,922
Oh, my toaster.

255
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,050
My toaster oven
to make toast for my grandson.

256
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,760
Uh-huh. Ma'am.

257
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,978
Dennis! Did you get
your chequebook out of the desk?

258
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,398
- You said the 2 minutes was up.
- We're getting the bills.

259
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,525
- All right, let's go.
- Dennis?

260
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,404
His basketball, his basketball.

261
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,489
Will you just let her go in
and get the ball?

262
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,033
Right, Jeff, get to it.
Rhonda, get the locks.

263
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,494
Hey, what about the rest?

264
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,579
They're gonna
bring everything out.

265
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,081
There's no need to worry.

266
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,419
You mind helping me move all this
to the other side of the sidewalk?

267
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,462
We're moving it, OK?
Just give us a second.

268
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,425
Now, my advice would be
to get a moving truck

269
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,510
cos your neighbours
are gonna have access

270
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,721
to everything you own
by the end of the day.

271
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,181
I got it.
Can you believe this?

272
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,728
They cancelled it and then
they didn't even tell these guys.

273
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,064
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

274
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,399
Oh, my God.

275
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,902
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I can't believe this is happening.

276
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,911
Hey!

277
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,080
- What are you doing?
- Moving stuff.

278
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,499
Don't go in there.
You got no business going in there.

279
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,960
- Shut the lid.
- All right, keep your pants on.

280
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,308
- I'll take him next door.
- OK.

281
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,934
- OK?
- OK.

282
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,022
- Hey, buddy.
- What are they doing?

283
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,732
- Nothing.
- This is our house.

284
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,525
- This is our house.
- It's OK.

285
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,861
- Son, where are you heading?
- Get off me!

286
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,529
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Get away from him.

287
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,531
- Get away from him.
- This is our house.

288
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,868
It's a very difficult situation.
Please take your son off the property.

289
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,162
- What do you think I'm doing?
- Those are my toys.

290
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,122
It's OK. It's OK.
It's OK, sweetie.

291
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,833
- Let go of me.
- Come here. Come here.

292
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,252
Just tell them.
I just wanna go to my room. Please.

293
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,630
You can't go to your room right now.

294
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,299
You said we weren't gonna
lose our house. You lied to me.

295
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,510
Sweetie, he didn't lie.
He didn't know.

296
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,228
Do you think you're gonna
come to school tomorrow?

297
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,026
- I don't know.
- Connor.

298
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,779
Got to go.

299
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:39,075
Well, what about our NBA 2K series?

300
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,786
See you later.

301
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,754
Not a problem.

302
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,882
- Thank you for everything.
- Absolutely. Take care.

303
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,259
See you soon.

304
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,476
Mr. Nash?

305
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:11,482
You have 24 hours before my crew
returns to dispose of whatever remains.

306
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,317
Not my choice.
Code enforcement.

307
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:16,988
Good luck.

308
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,059
You OK?

309
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,879
Hey.

310
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,510
Hey, do y'all know
where 229 is?

311
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,430
229's up there.
Up here?

312
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,515
Is there a stair near there?

313
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,101
- Around the pool.
- Around the pool.

314
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,355
- OK. Thank you.
- You got a lot of stuff.

315
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,774
- Yeah.
- We can watch your stuff

316
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,401
- while you take some of it up there.
- OK. Thanks.

317
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,612
- You want a hand?
- That'd be great.

318
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,157
- Are you planning on staying a while?
- No, just a couple of nights.

319
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,452
2 years ago that's what we said.

320
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,663
But, er, welcome anyway.

321
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,211
Come this way.

322
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,629
Come this way.

323
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,838
Come on.

324
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,830
- Where am I gonna sleep?
- Where do you wanna sleep?

325
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,666
How about in this one
cos it's closer to the TV?

326
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,585
That's a good call.
How about this, buddy?

327
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,754
Take that off, put this one on.

328
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,215
Wait, this has to come off.

329
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,017
Am I going to school tomorrow?

330
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,394
We got to figure all that out,
don't we?

331
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,439
Yeah, cos, er...

332
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,067
I have to see Derek.
And I promised him, so...

333
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,199
Er, my name is Dennis Nash.

334
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,368
I'm calling about the roofing job.

335
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,831
Yeah, I work for Crown Construction.

336
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,333
About 5 years.

337
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,502
Um, you got anything else
on the books right now?

338
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,254
All right, well, my number...

339
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,761
Yeah, I got a ton of experience.

340
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,388
I do electric, construction,
plumbing, anything.

341
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,186
All right. Lower-level stuff?
Anything? Anything going?

342
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,439
Do you know of anybody
that's hiring right now?

343
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,150
All right. Thank you for your help.
Thank you for your time.

344
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:12,598
Dennis, this motel
is half full of people like us.

345
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,601
They're not people like us.

346
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,396
They're all evicted
and they get stuck here.

347
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,317
I could maybe take the bus
and start looking for apartments.

348
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,070
- We can't afford it.
- It's just first and last month's.

349
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,615
Plus 2 or 3 months' security.
4 maybe, cos of our credit.

350
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,784
Our credit's shot.

351
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,371
Dennis, we've...
We've got to get out of here.

352
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,957
We've got to go to Tampa.

353
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,584
- We gotta go to Uncle Jimmy's.
- We're not going to Tampa.

354
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,753
Uncle Jimmy said we could come.

355
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,839
I talked to Mary Margaret
just 3 days ago.

356
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,424
We're not going to Tampa.

357
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,846
You really wanna go to Tampa?

358
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,766
You wanna take Connor out of school,
take him away from his friends?

359
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,269
We leave, we give up.
We leave, we let the house go.

360
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,731
I'm gonna figure it out.

361
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,653
No choice.

362
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,950
- Baby, you want some toast?
- No.

363
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,743
You don't want any toast?

364
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,829
I didn't leave any tools
in my truck, right?

365
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,207
Huh? We got everything, right?

366
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,962
What's wrong?

367
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,678
Man, I mean, that's beautiful, but...

368
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,638
- I was catching 2lb bass...
- Excuse me.

369
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,432
- ...when I was 6 years old.
- Hold up.

370
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,641
Hey.

371
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,060
You stole some tools from me
during my eviction.

372
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,980
I'm the senior sales manager.
What's the problem?

373
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:46,692
- He stole 500 bucks' worth of my tools.
- You're just making up bullshit.

374
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,444
I didn't steal your fucking tools.

375
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,071
- We have a form you can fill out.
- Just give me my tools.

376
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,324
If you have an issue
we got a form you can fill out.

377
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,535
Just go back to your house
and look for your tools again.

378
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,746
Oh, wait. You don't have
a fucking house, right?

379
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,206
What the fuck?

380
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,918
- Goddamn it!
- Give me my fucking tools back.

381
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,086
- Fucker!
- Kick your arse.

382
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,047
Chill the fuck out!

383
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,840
Hey, buddy, chill the fuck out!

384
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,384
- Hey!
- Fucking call me a fucking thief!

385
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,387
- Give me my fucking tools back.
- Knock that shit off right now.

386
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,389
- Chill the fuck out!
- Get the fuck off of me.

387
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,183
Bill, you wanna throw a couple of licks

388
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,727
or are you just officiating
this event today?

389
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:25,147
Sir, I was just...
I was trying to intervene, sir.

390
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,566
What the fuck
are you still doing here anyway?

391
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:31,111
- I thought, sir... I thought you said...
- You thought? Lord Almighty.

392
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:34,406
You have evolved.
Has Darwin come to Orlando, Florida?

393
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,577
- Well, Bill?
- We'll be there on time, Mr. Carver.

394
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,579
- Get to it.
- Yes, all right.

395
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,915
All right, come on, vamanos.
Freddy, let's go.

396
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,042
Guys, we're going to Vista Lakes.
Here we go.

397
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:48,379
And you, sir, are you finished?
Cos I got the cops on speed dial.

398
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,256
They could chase you out of town.

399
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,840
I didn't come here to fight.

400
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,759
I came to get my tools
that your guy stole.

401
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,220
Do I look like Ace Hardware?
I don't deal in tools.

402
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,347
- I deal in homes.
- Your guy stole the tools.

403
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,975
- I understand what you do, sir.
- You do?

404
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,018
You evicted me yesterday.
You kicked me out.

405
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,563
I didn't kick you out, the bank did.
I just represent it.

406
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,064
Richard Carver.

407
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,902
What? You gotta be kidding me.

408
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,738
When?

409
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,574
Uh-huh.

410
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,867
Yeah. Fuck Hazmat.
I'll call them myself.

411
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,829
- 914 Shader Drive, now.
- What about Via Alizar?

412
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,414
- Move it!
- Yes, sir.

413
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,623
Let's go.

414
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,001
Mr. Carver, I'm sorry
to interrupt your day.

415
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,377
- Are you Miguel?
- What?

416
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,754
Do you work? You got tools?
You do construction?

417
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,716
- Yeah, I do work.
- 914 Shader Drive.

418
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,884
I'll pay you $50 cash.

419
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:40,014
- What? Are you kidding me?
- $50 shouldn't be a joke to you, son.

420
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:46,186
Are you gonna look into my...
Motherfucker!

421
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,855
Fucking shit!

422
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,900
Fucking cocksucker!

423
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,912
I need your team out here in 30 minutes

424
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,457
or it's gonna be a total gut job
to the goddamn studs.

425
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,253
Yeah, these animals backed up
the sewage and skipped town.

426
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,633
I'm glad you think that's funny.

427
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,719
I got the neighbours threatening
to call the department of health.

428
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,387
If your team isn't here in 30 minutes

429
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,891
my next call's gonna be to Fannie
about your slow-arse response time.

430
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,477
What do you mean,
shit's not a hazardous material?

431
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,438
Why don't you come and eat some?
Maybe that will change your mind.

432
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,023
Yeah, fuck you too.

433
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,568
Rick, no.

434
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,821
- Mr. Carver, we don't...
- You know what's gonna happen, right?

435
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,115
By tonight the mould's
gonna be up to the ceiling.

436
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,702
By tomorrow someone's paying money
to demolish it.

437
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,622
- And it ain't gonna be me.
- 300 bucks.

438
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,210
200.

439
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,297
That's a bear and you know it. 250.

440
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,259
All right.

441
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,972
Is this yours?

442
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,452
Oh, fuck.

443
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,729
Harden the fuck up, son.

444
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,274
There better be container trucks,
shop vacs and a blower here in one hour

445
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,444
or I will make it my business that
you never work in Orange County again.

446
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,156
You will also finish Via Alizar today.
You are on my list, shit-fuck.

447
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,787
Nash.

448
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,506
What else do you do?
Framing, electric, roofing, plumbing?

449
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,012
All that, more.

450
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,308
Go on, finish it.

451
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,691
Ahh!

452
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,611
All right, a 6-pack
for the first guy in here with a shovel.

453
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,281
Anybody?

454
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,867
How much you pay for it?

455
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,452
- $200?
- 150.

456
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,953
Plus the 6-pack.

457
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,707
- Cerveza por trabajo, si?
- Cerveza? Good.

458
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,459
All right, let's go.

459
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,170
Anybody else? How about you?

460
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,255
It's just shit.
I know you need the money.

461
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:03,467
There you go, there you go.

462
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,428
Come on, red shirt.
What about you, pretty?

463
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,350
All right, let's do it.
Let's get this shit done.

464
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,565
- Dennis? Are you kidding me?
- Is that real money?

465
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,276
- How much is this? 50.
- That's real money. Count it out.

466
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:25,155
- 100. Another 50 is 150.
- Keep going.

467
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,449
- $200?
- 250.

468
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,576
Hold on a second.
Who called you? What's that?

469
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,453
Some guys.
It was through, er...

470
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,123
Not that guy Dan?

471
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,668
- Is this a new job?
- It's a new guy. You don't know him.

472
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,963
Javier called me
and we figured it out.

473
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:45,259
This is serious money
and your son has just totally pocketed it.

474
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,806
- Where have you put it?
- That's the biggest money ever!

475
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,226
- It's right here, Dad.
- That's my money!

476
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,186
Don't you believe it!

477
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,233
You're gonna make
new friends right now.

478
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,777
You're gonna jump on here.

479
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,821
I don't want to.

480
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,989
I know.

481
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,993
But I need you to be brave.

482
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,246
But it's a different school.
I don't want to go to that school.

483
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,292
I know you don't, but you got
to keep your grades up, remember?

484
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,671
- You got to take care of yourself, OK?
- Yeah, I know. Bye.

485
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:23,839
Hey, hey!

486
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,342
I love you.

487
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,679
Be safe, OK?
Take care of yourself, all right?

488
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,839
- 'I see you.'
- Hey, Rick.

489
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,634
'Come round back
to the screen door where the pool is.'

490
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,361
Who's that guy?

491
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,033
All right, thanks. Bye.

492
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,161
Nash. If it's not one thing
it's another.

493
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,329
Come on.

494
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,915
Oh, girls, it's hot in here.

495
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,793
Calling all princesses.
It's time for the royal ice cream.

496
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,044
Yeah!

497
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,840
It's a pretty place.
Ah, it's OK.

498
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,677
I got it 18 months ago.
I'm gonna flip it after New Year's.

499
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,681
Let's have some Ben and Jerry's,
Cecilia, please.

500
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,558
What is this?
Did you make these?

501
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,102
What? Oh, it fell off.

502
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,979
The AC's been out for 2 hours.

503
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,690
Through there to the left
there's a leak. You'll see it.

504
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,529
- Do they fly?
- No.

505
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,112
- This is Richard Carver.
- 'Adjustable rate mortgage, cocksucker!

506
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:55,115
- 'I'm homeless, you motherfucker!'
- Stop calling me, you freak.

507
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,325
'I'm gonna call you every goddamn day

508
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,703
'to remind you
what a piece of shit you are.'

509
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,255
They called here 2 days ago.

510
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,299
I don't wanna change
our phone number again.

511
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:16,303
Come on, boo. I got you and your mum
a week at the Corazon Spa in the Keys.

512
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,888
I want you to enjoy yourself.

513
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,057
- What?
- I should divorce you.

514
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,143
We'd lose on taxes.

515
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,103
And you'd miss me.

516
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,355
You'd miss your little Richie,
wouldn't you?

517
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,763
- What are you doing?
- I'm all done.

518
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,849
Give the coils 5 minutes to dry,
but then you got cold air.

519
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,769
- It's not even been an hour.
- I salvaged your ceiling with mud.

520
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,687
I didn't want to tear up that dry wall.

521
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,941
I found some paint in your garage
so I just patched that up too.

522
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,568
Well, unless you're planning
on taking a swim, let's go.

523
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,830
What do you see out there?
I see homes.

524
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:29,376
I just saw nine opportunities
to make money in the last 5 blocks.

525
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,211
3 properties without mailboxes

526
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,672
and one with an overgrown lawn
and no car in the drive,

527
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:38,135
two with white signs in the windows
and three with shiny new doorknobs.

528
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,304
If you can get attuned
to seeing those kinds of opportunities,

529
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,808
you can get up off your hands and knees
and really start working for me.

530
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,102
I can work.
You've seen me all week.

531
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:51,189
Yeah, I know you worked for good crews
with Rick Kirby, Chris Camilleri, right?

532
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,526
But the unfortunate thing is,
they're out of business.

533
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,279
Cos they build homes.
I own homes.

534
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:02,701
You know what I am? I'm a man
who owns a hell of a lot of properties.

535
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,996
You can be a part of that,
but it's a hell of a responsibility.

536
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,831
What I need to know
is that I have someone

537
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:11,376
who can handle any situation
I want to walk away from, 24/7.

538
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,837
I don't care
if your kid's in the school play,

539
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,380
it's Christmas,

540
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,592
you lined up
the best damn blowjob in Orlando,

541
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,011
when you work for me, you're mine.

542
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,723
What the hell?

543
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,813
Call office.

544
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,570
You see that?
The cable and the hose?

545
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,072
- I see it.
- 'Rick Carver Realty.'

546
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,075
I got some jack wagon
at 3505 Ridgeway

547
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,786
stealing water and power
from 3509 Ridgeway.

548
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,873
Call up the county court website,
find out if he's in default.

549
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,626
- 'Yes, sir.'
- Quickly, please. I'm at his house now.

550
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:53,835
'You got it.'

551
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,424
You know how to shoot, right?

552
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,516
I'll run a background check
so you can carry a concealed weapon.

553
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,061
Go on.

554
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,271
Are you fucking with me?

555
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,232
Surly homeowners.
You're gonna need it.

556
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,573
I'm not... No, I'm good.

557
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,783
Suit yourself.

558
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:30,038
The person on the other side of the door
doesn't always feel that way, trust me.

559
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,667
See? They can feed their Rottweiler,
but they can't pay for their house.

560
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,418
Mm-hm.

561
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,463
Frank Greene. All right, let's go.

562
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,769
Mr. Frank Greene?

563
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,438
- Yeah.
- I'm Rick Carver.

564
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:59,609
- You're stealing from me.
- You mean the extension cord.

565
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:03,363
Yeah, that property next door belongs
to Fannie Mae. I represent it for them.

566
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:07,826
So you're not just stealing from me,
you're stealing from the US government.

567
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,997
I'm with Frank Greene now.
What have you got for me?

568
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,207
Remove the lines.

569
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,885
I saw you at the foreclosure court.

570
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:30,015
Our boys go to the same school.
They were playing with the globe.

571
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,560
- Oh, yeah.
- I had my show-cause hearing.

572
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,230
- What happened with you?
- I lost.

573
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,026
Got evicted,
living in a motel right now.

574
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,654
What are you doing with him?

575
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,574
I got to work, you know.

576
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,242
He offered me a job.

577
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,829
I usually do construction, but...

578
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,998
it's been dry for the last however long.

579
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,045
- You know, this ain't what I do.
- This isn't me either.

580
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,549
I was a manager,
Custom Cabinets and Lighting.

581
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,345
Lost my job 2 years ago. 2.

582
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,847
I'm not a thief.

583
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,891
I know.

584
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,894
I've been researching
on the internet, public libraries.

585
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,645
I'm gonna save my house.

586
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,023
I hope you do.

587
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,362
Custom Cabinets?
Yeah, I installed your stuff.

588
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,489
- Oh, yeah. A bunch of times.
- Hey, Dad.

589
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,950
- Yes?
- The TV turned off.

590
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,494
OK.

591
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,746
You know my boy?
Connor? Connor Nash?

592
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,081
Yes, sir.

593
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,248
Yeah, thanks.

594
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:43,380
Looks like the Bank of Greater Santa Fe
filed for final judgment of foreclosure.

595
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:47,675
My money says the judge has me back
for your eviction in less than 90 days.

596
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,596
I took down the extension cords
and the hose.

597
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,640
I shouldn't have done that.
I apologise.

598
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,892
- It's OK.
- No, I assure you, stealing is not OK.

599
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,812
Mr. Nash will be talking
to your neighbours personally.

600
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,397
If we receive any reports

601
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,316
or if we drive by and see you
stealing my water and power again,

602
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,735
the next visit's
from the Sheriff's Department.

603
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,487
Understand me?

604
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,364
- Yes, sir.
- Good day.

605
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,615
Nash, come on.

606
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,329
Don't be soft.

607
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,457
They all got a sob story.

608
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,168
But the law's the law.
That's the side you're on.

609
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,589
You should be smart enough
to know the outcome of this situation.

610
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,091
So toughen up.

611
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,057
I'm evicting a hedge-fund manager
out of here in two weeks.

612
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,851
Keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open

613
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,978
and maybe you'll learn something
this time.

614
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:47,152
I'll take the Moder sconces,
the chandelier,

615
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,738
the Haleakala marble,
Harwood cabinets,

616
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,866
range, Sub-Zero.

617
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,369
- What about the microwave?
- I don't need a microwave.

618
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:59,330
Three grand and you gotta
be out in 2 weeks.

619
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,541
- How about 5?
- 4.

620
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,293
And Dennis here will get right to it.

621
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,837
Done.

622
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,342
The screws are right on in there.
Pop 'em right out, OK?

623
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,552
Yup.

624
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,992
Install everything, patch the tiles,
caulk the cabinets.

625
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,453
Connect the gas line
when you bring in the appliances.

626
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,247
- All this in here now?
- I'm selling this home for Fannie Mae.

627
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:44,167
I can't do that
if it doesn't have a kitchen, can I?

628
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,627
No.

629
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,129
So, who just paid me $33,000

630
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:52,258
for new cabinets, appliances
and a counter top plus labour?

631
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,512
- Fannie Mae.
- Fannie Mae.

632
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,306
Congratulations.
You just fucked the government.

633
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,187
- Mr. Nash?
- Yeah.

634
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,695
If you're interested, let me know.

635
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,156
If not, you can use this
to take your kid to Disney World

636
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:18,368
and get yourself a job
Migueling Cinderella's castle.

637
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,727
I don't give a shit about the government.

638
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:47,272
They ain't never done
nothing for me, so...

639
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,816
That's a lot of money
you just gave me.

640
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,734
Feels a bit like trouble.

641
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,279
You done honest work
your whole life building homes.

642
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,532
What did that get you
but me knocking at your door?

643
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,076
Are we stealing? Is this stealing?

644
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:03,413
Well, in 2006 you borrowed $85,000
against your home

645
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,290
and never paid it back, Nash.

646
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,793
- You telling me that's not stealing?
- What? Are you serious?

647
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,878
That's not stealing,
that's me taking a loan.

648
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,298
That's me working my arse off
to pay back that loan.

649
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,174
I wanted to pay it back.
I didn't steal.

650
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:18,928
That's not how the banks see it
or the taxpayers paying for the bail-out.

651
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,555
You think I bought a Porsche? No.

652
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:24,309
I invested every cent I borrowed
into construction equipment

653
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,104
so that I could pay back that loan
and put a roof over my family's head,

654
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,939
put food in my kid's mouth.

655
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,318
The economy crashed.
I can't predict the weather.

656
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,528
I can.

657
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:38,156
I'm a Doppler fucking radar.

658
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,284
You took something you didn't give back.
The bank screwed you over.

659
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,537
Take your pick.
Either way you lost.

660
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,373
But I made more money
during the crash than before it.

661
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:51,210
You can too, you just gotta stop
lying to yourself and ask,

662
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:54,589
what did you do wrong
that your family lives in a motel?

663
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,308
I'm gonna do it.

664
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,728
Whatever you want me to do,
I'll do it, but...

665
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,982
I need you to do me a favour,
help me get my family home back.

666
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,693
I want you to take this
as my first payment.

667
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,570
Don't get emotional about real estate.

668
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,697
It's too late for that.
That's my family home.

669
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,492
That's my boy's school,
so please just take this.

670
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,994
This ain't gonna cut it.
Put that under your mattress.

671
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,539
Don't put it in the bank.
You're just giving them more money.

672
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,042
When you get enough
I'll tell you what to do with it.

673
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,461
Now, do you want to double
what you just made or not?

674
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,636
It's about fucking time, playboy.

675
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,473
Damn.

676
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,143
Always late, papa.
You always late, man.

677
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,187
Yeah.

678
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,231
That's the jackpot.

679
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,694
- So who's this Rick Carver dude?
- That's my boss.

680
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,612
For the time being.

681
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,989
- What's that like?
- Oh, it's great. He's...

682
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,991
Nah, he's a fucking arsehole.

683
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,869
1, 2, 3.
Straight on.

684
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,832
- What are you doing?
- Got to take a picture.

685
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,043
to prove to the bank this shit's missing
so they pay us to put it back in.

686
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:17,255
We're stealing it
to then bring it back?

687
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,840
- You wanna get paid?
- Hell, yeah.

688
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,007
I got to take a picture.

689
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,305
- Yeah?
- Mr. Tanner, my name is Dennis Nash.

690
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:29,016
I'm here representing
Rick Carver Realty.

691
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,269
Um, I'm here to, er...

692
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,771
I understand your house
has been foreclosed on.

693
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,400
The house still belongs to us
and we intend to keep it that way.

694
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,819
I hope that works out.
God forbid it doesn't.

695
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:42,530
If you got a second
I wanna tell you about cash for keys,

696
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,615
here on the form.

697
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,492
What do you mean,
cash for keys?

698
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,245
If you leave your house
in a broom-swept condition

699
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,621
prior to your eviction date,

700
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,874
banks can give you 3500 bucks
cash in your pocket.

701
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,836
We're not interested in anything.
Take your papers.

702
00:45:56,962 --> 00:46:01,007
We'll contact our attorney
and they'll get with you.

703
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,063
What you doing, son?

704
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,399
Who'll buy a home with a pool
if the pool don't work?

705
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,902
- What do y'all think y'all doing?
- Doing some repairs.

706
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,738
I know this house has been empty
for 2 or 3 months.

707
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,574
You know Rick Carver Realty?
You see that sign on the lawn?

708
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,451
- Yes, I did.
- That's who we work for.

709
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,286
I hope you have a good day.

710
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,371
- Is she your type?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

711
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,373
It ain't a lot,
but it's gonna pay for U-Haul,

712
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,626
storage, a down payment
on an apartment.

713
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,170
I have no idea what's going on.

714
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:43,925
because my mum and dad
from Vietnam is coming

715
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,760
and the house can't be foreclosured.

716
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,846
Have you been putting notices
on my window?

717
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,225
- No, that's the Sheriff's Department.
- Well, that's trespassing.

718
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,353
I can't control what the department does,
but I can give you this form.

719
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,647
I don't want your papers.
Don't hand me no papers.

720
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,900
I don't want your papers or notices.
I want you to get the hell out of here.

721
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,869
I've been owning this house
for 7 years already.

722
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,955
I met my wife right here.

723
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,875
We're about to have a baby here.
I just made an addition in the back.

724
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,795
I wanna save the house.
I wanna keep it.

725
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:24,173
- Who are you?
- I work for a real estate company.

726
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:28,928
This is a KYO form. Basically,
it means knowing your options.

727
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:32,056
- My options?
- I'm putting it all on Facebook.

728
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,767
- Kayla, put it away.
- We don't know who this man is.

729
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,228
Kayla, go inside.

730
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,985
I'm sorry, ma'am.

731
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,279
I'm gonna have to take care of my kid.

732
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,948
I advise you to call
that number at the bo...

733
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,784
- If you wanna just take a look.
- I'm not looking at anything.

734
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,828
You could just take it
and not look at it.

735
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,621
Hold on a second.

736
00:47:57,249 --> 00:48:00,835
I think I've made myself clear to you.
I don't wanna see you again.

737
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:28,613
Both Victor and Andy.
Neither one of them showed up.

738
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,197
- Hey.
- Hey.

739
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,200
I can't even give Connor his vitamins.

740
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,828
I have one little kid Flintstone vitamin.

741
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,121
They're good.

742
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,999
- What do you got in there?
- What do you have in there?

743
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,127
- A steak.
- What?

744
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,796
That's Hamburger Helper
if I ever heard of anything.

745
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,174
What does that look like to you?

746
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,468
That looks like dinner for Day and I.

747
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,178
Day, you come on and join us.

748
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,889
You put that under your T-shirt.

749
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,724
No, I'm not kidding.

750
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,981
Oh, that was in.
Come on, Dad!

751
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,860
Watch the lamp!

752
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:28,130
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8 ACs.

753
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,883
And 5 pool pumps.

754
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,970
- A good addition.
- I figured why not.

755
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:37,390
Better count on 7.
I dropped that one. It's beyond repair.

756
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,226
- Sell it for scrap metal.
- I already priced it out. 100 bucks.

757
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,812
Good. Invoice Rick Carver Realty

758
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:46,107
24K for the ACs
and 3200 for the pumps.

759
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,859
The bank will reimburse me
to the same amount.

760
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,904
Your cut is 25%, about 6700.

761
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,033
- 6700?
- That's right.

762
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,537
- Hey, Rick.
- What?

763
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,206
You still got that Ruger?

764
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,627
Excuse me? What did you say?

765
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,463
Are you saying you want the gun?
Did I understand you?

766
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,932
I ran the background check already.
You're clear to carry it.

767
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,981
Who pays the most out
in cash for keys?

768
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,233
Fannie and Freddie, then BoA.

769
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,944
I want you to go to every one
of their foreclosed properties

770
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,612
and find any that are unoccupied.

771
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,906
No homeowner, no tenant.
You got it?

772
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,742
Yo, Terry, let's go.

773
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,578
- Motherfucker didn't pay again.
- We got some money for you.

774
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,041
Send 'em back, Luis.
Send 'em back, brother.

775
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,002
- Dennis, where are we going?
- Be patient. Don't ask questions.

776
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,755
- You don't trust me?
- You hired me, so I got no choice.

777
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,176
Go, Terry.

778
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,144
- Tell him to hurry up.
- Yo, T, let's go, baby.

779
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:08,147
There's nobody here.
11286. There's nobody here.

780
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,857
All right, bub. Jump in.

781
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,570
How we doing, Javi?

782
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:21,410
267 Lakewood.
Empty as a motherfucker.

783
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:24,371
Right, turn to the back page.
I need y'all to sign these leases.

784
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:29,251
The banks need to think you guys
are tenants in all these properties,

785
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:32,088
so that I can negotiate
cash-for-keys deals with all y'all.

786
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:35,508
- How much they paying?
- You can count on a $2500 cheque

787
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,135
from the government
and the motherfucking banks.

788
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,678
2500?

789
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:43,057
They been fucking me for so long, man.
Shit, I'll take it back, brother.

790
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,226
Somebody getting pregnant
tonight, baby.

791
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,897
Who we fucking, man?
The government or the banks?

792
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:08,165
Ah, Jim. See you for lunch
Wednesday, OK?

793
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,834
You think Freeman
is the way to go?

794
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,461
He's Fannie's number one attorney
3 years running.

795
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,713
He can connect us to bulk buyers.

796
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,758
I'm not talking millions of dollars,
I'm talking billions.

797
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,554
All right, so this is Dennis Nash.

798
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,014
- County Commissioner Arthur Link.
- Pleasure.

799
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,058
Your property at 2102 West Jefferson,

800
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:28,561
I'll have Dennis make sure
the gutters are redone.

801
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,396
- What happened to Bill?
- Killed him.

802
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,731
This is my new guy.
I think he's gonna last.

803
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:36,569
I'll get us a meeting with Freeman.
And stick with this guy, you'll go far.

804
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,737
Thanks for the recommendation.

805
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,072
See you, Arthur.

806
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,202
What do you got for me?

807
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:48,414
Successfully negotiated
6 cash-for-keys with 6 tenants.

808
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:53,335
Good. So, Nash, how much
did you tell your buddies per home?

809
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:56,088
- 3500 or less?
- Yeah, 3500.

810
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,383
Oh, you told them the full amount?

811
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,429
I told 'em what I told 'em.

812
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,890
What do you care?

813
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,854
Yeah.

814
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,656
Hey, baby. Look at that smile.
You're gorgeous.

815
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,619
Don't you have class today?

816
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,163
Er, they're all online,
plus I finished that website.

817
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,956
Congratulations.

818
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:37,713
She's my sweetheart.

819
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,174
Studies graphic design.
I had her do my business card.

820
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,429
- This your place?
- No, just keeping it warm.

821
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,641
Why don't you scan those leases
and email them to Fannie and BoA.

822
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,981
So, Nash, why aren't you married?

823
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,902
I don't really got time for it.

824
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,655
I don't trust a man who's not married.
Nobody does.

825
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,782
Wanna tell me
what happened to Connor's mum?

826
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,119
I don't think so, no.

827
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,623
Prom night fiasco?

828
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,378
Close, pretty close.

829
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:21,257
The cheque for the AC
and pool pumps came in.

830
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,300
It's a lot higher
than what I expected.

831
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,468
7200.

832
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,054
You wanna keep that?

833
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,682
I'll give you the 3 grand
I already made.

834
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,810
And whatever my share is
from these leases.

835
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,607
Cos I want my home back.

836
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,820
The BPO on your home
came in at 170K.

837
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,031
I'll buy it

838
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,242
and then you'll owe me 155

839
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:52,913
at 12% amortised over a 30-year period
with a 2-year balloon.

840
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,960
That's a shitty rate, Rick.

841
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,795
No bank's gonna loan you that money.

842
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,338
If you don't pay, I'm on the hook.

843
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,507
I don't want that property.
It has no future.

844
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:06,010
- Yeah, but that's my family home.
- It's a home.

845
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,637
But if you want it, it's yours.

846
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:12,391
It'll take eight to 12 weeks
for the bank to list it on the MLS.

847
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,852
You can do repairs,
but you can't move in till then.

848
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,813
Can we figure out
some kind of contract?

849
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,816
Yeah, I'll have the office
draw up a contract for deed.

850
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,822
Is it mine again?

851
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,657
Yeah, it's yours.

852
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:29,950
OK, thank you.

853
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,286
Seriously, thank you.

854
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,496
- Rick, thank you.
- All right.

855
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,166
No tears.

856
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,295
Drink?

857
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,175
No, I'm good, I'm good.

858
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,760
High on life.

859
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,928
Well, you might wanna reconsider.

860
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,181
We got one more stop.

861
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,350
224 Lake View Court.

862
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:59,313
Is that Mr. Tanner? I offered him
a cash-for-keys from the bank.

863
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,899
Guess what? He never called.
And his eviction's today.

864
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,692
You can pop your cherry
with this one.

865
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,612
First one's a bitch,
but you get numb to it.

866
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,947
All you gotta do
is stand next to me today,

867
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,367
but after this
you're gonna do 'em on your own.

868
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,078
Listen, Rick, I don't...

869
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:18,082
- Could I... Could I just...
- Go fuck yourself? Yeah.

870
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,460
What did you think it was gonna mean,
working for me?

871
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:24,505
- I just thought that maybe...
- No, you didn't. You didn't think.

872
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,049
You didn't have the guts
to ask me either. Nobody does.

873
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:31,303
Because who in their right mind
wouldn't rather put someone in a home

874
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,888
than drag 'em out of it?

875
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:36,725
Up until 3 years ago
I was a regular old real-estate agent.

876
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:40,270
Putting people in homes,
speculating on property, that was my job.

877
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:44,650
Now, in 2006 Robert and Julia Tanner
borrowed $30,000

878
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:47,027
to put an enclosed patio on their home

879
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,614
that they had somehow managed
to live without for 25 years.

880
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,909
Why don't you ask them about that
when they're spitting in your face

881
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,494
while you walk 'em to the kerb?

882
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,955
Why don't you ask the bank
what they were thinking

883
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,082
giving them
an adjustable-rate mortgage?

884
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,502
Then you can go to the government
and ask why they lifted every regulation

885
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,754
and sat there like a retarded stepchild.

886
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,216
You, Tanner, the banks, Washington,

887
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:12,344
every other homeowner
and investor from here to China

888
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,389
turned my life into evictions.

889
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,268
I'm not an aristocrat.

890
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,187
I wasn't born into this.
My daddy was a roofer, OK?

891
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,940
I grew up on construction sites
watching him bust his arse

892
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:27,317
until he fell off of a townhouse one day.

893
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:31,780
A lifetime of insurance payments
and they dropped him

894
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,949
before he could buy a wheelchair,

895
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:36,869
but only after they got him
hooked on painkillers.

896
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,538
Do you think
I'm gonna let that happen to me?

897
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:43,167
Do you think America 2010
gives a flying rat's arse about Carver?

898
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,668
Or Nash?

899
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:48,755
Uh-uh. America
doesn't bail out the losers.

900
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:53,927
America was built
by bailing out winners,

901
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:58,056
by rigging a nation

902
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:01,226
of the winners for the winners
by the winners.

903
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:06,023
You go to church, Nash?

904
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,902
- You go to church?
- Sure.

905
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,990
Only one in 100
is gonna get on that ark, son.

906
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,329
And every other poor soul's
gonna drown.

907
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,542
I'm not gonna drown.

908
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,601
I wanna do it alone.

909
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:46,813
I've seen you do it.
I know how it's done.

910
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,900
I'll do it alone.

911
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,485
Help yourself.

912
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:18,971
Wow.

913
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,640
Rick told me there was a new guy.
Let's go, rookie.

914
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,518
I didn't get all dressed up
just for you.

915
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,041
You ready?

916
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:01,013
Mr. Tanner?

917
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,180
Yeah.

918
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:05,017
- Mr. Nash.
- Mr. Tanner.

919
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,768
Good morning.

920
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,688
Dennis Nash from Rick Carver Realty.
Remember?

921
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,440
I remember you, Mr. Nash.

922
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,193
- What do you want?
- I hate to say it,

923
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,323
but your eviction
is scheduled for today.

924
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:23,827
And, um, your house
has been foreclosed on

925
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,038
and it's been transferred to the bank.

926
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,624
Now, I hate to be here doing this,

927
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,001
but I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the property.

928
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:34,212
Now, look, my wife's on the phone
with her attorney right now.

929
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,882
There's been a mix-up.
We're gonna get this sorted out.

930
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:39,676
If there's been a mix-up, sir,
I can't do anything about that.

931
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,846
I'm just gonna have to ask you to leave.
I can't do anything about that.

932
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,641
Look, honey,
have you got him on the phone?

933
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,100
Yeah.

934
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:52,689
It doesn't matter whatever's happening
on the phone or not with your lawyer.

935
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,859
- This is happening now.
- He said he'd call us back.

936
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,986
Well, there you go.
This is gonna have to wait.

937
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:01,239
Now, look we've got an appeal filed,

938
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:04,618
- so there's no point in you being here.
- I understand how you're feeling.

939
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:07,204
It's a tough day and...

940
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:11,083
We're going to have to wait
till he calls back. We can't leave today.

941
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,877
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
- We're not ready for this.

942
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,922
What I can do is give you some time
to go into the house,

943
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,548
grab all the stuff you need,

944
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:22,344
whether it's medicine,
stuff for your baby,

945
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:25,555
jewellery, any pictures,
anything valuable.

946
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:28,600
No, no, no. You aren't supposed
to be here today, OK?

947
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:29,810
So you're leaving.

948
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:33,647
I can only give you a few minutes
to grab some personal belongings.

949
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,774
- I'm gonna ask you to leave.
- You are leaving.

950
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,359
- We need to calm down.
- I am calm.

951
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,361
We're not going back.
Do not close the door.

952
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:42,572
You're all trespassing.
All of you, get off of my property.

953
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,783
No, sir, you and your wife
are trespassing.

954
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,618
This is the property of the bank now.

955
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:50,247
We're giving you an opportunity
to collect some of your belongings.

956
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,124
I suggest you take advantage of it.

957
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,460
There's 2 ways to do this:
the easy way where you pack up and go

958
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:58,380
or I escort you to jail.
It's your choice.

959
01:01:58,506 --> 01:01:59,923
Yes. Let's go.

960
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,551
- Gonna clear it.
- Gonna clear it.

961
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,269
All right, we're clear.

962
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:19,985
Now.

963
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,988
Be careful.

964
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,907
You wanna handle that?
You know what to do.

965
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:35,041
Mr. Tanner, I'm gonna have
to ask you to move to the kerb.

966
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,419
- What?
- I know, I know. I'm sorry.

967
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,463
Real sorry.

968
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,632
- If I can help you with anything...
- No, I got it, I got it.

969
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,093
- Let me grab this.
- No, no, no, no. I got it.

970
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,974
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna do this today.
I tried to avoid this.

971
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,393
How do you live with yourself?
You make me sick.

972
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:58,106
It's OK, baby. It's OK, baby.

973
01:02:58,232 --> 01:02:59,858
Oh, honey. No, no, no, no, no.

974
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,818
No, no, no, no, no, no.

975
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:49,157
- Where are we going?
- Where do you think we're going?

976
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:54,412
- To see the Orlando Magic practise.
- Er, close, actually pretty close.

977
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:57,165
We're gonna get myself
a tattoo of a snake

978
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,835
all over my arm,
wrapping around my arm.

979
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:02,671
You want a tattoo of a snake?
I'll give you a tattoo of a snake.

980
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:04,297
- Ow!
- That will be the day.

981
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,678
Are we gonna pull up?

982
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:11,680
Get out.

983
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,226
What are we doing here?

984
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,854
- Take that.
- What are we doing?

985
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,065
- What are you doing, Dennis?
- What are we doing here?

986
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,650
I don't know.
What are we doing?

987
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:29,364
- You're making me nervous.
- How do you expect us to know?

988
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,949
Don't be nervous.

989
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:37,706
There's an app for that.

990
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,249
What was that?

991
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,421
Cops are coming back?

992
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:50,218
- What are we doing?
- What are we doing here?

993
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,095
Oh, my God, look.

994
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:55,307
Oh, God.

995
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,685
- What are we doing here?
- I got the home back.

996
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,478
- What?
- So I have my room back?

997
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:03,607
- Yeah.
- How are we getting the house back?

998
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:04,900
I mean...

999
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:07,319
- My room looks so big.
- That's cos it is.

1000
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,696
We can't move in for a couple of weeks,
but it's ours.

1001
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:11,698
- Dad, come see my room.
- I'm gonna explain.

1002
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,366
Come here.

1003
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,245
I know, it's huge.

1004
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:18,955
Oh, my God.

1005
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,638
Do you want bunk beds?
I'll make you bunk beds.

1006
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:38,058
A basketball hoop
so I can dunk it right there.

1007
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,976
- What else? What do you think?
- A hot tub.

1008
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,436
A hot tub right there.

1009
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:43,897
And then paint it
black, blue and silver

1010
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:46,024
like the Orlando Magic.

1011
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:49,861
It's gonna be blue and blue and then
one small black strip all the way round.

1012
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:52,822
I love it. You know
what else I was thinking?

1013
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,034
- In the back yard we can get a pool.
- A pool? Yeah.

1014
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,287
- It better be a heated pool.
- Let's start painting.

1015
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:01,706
There's a bucket right here.
I'm gonna join you.

1016
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:16,596
How are you doing this?

1017
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:22,811
- How is this... How is this real?
- It's a contract.

1018
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,230
My boss bought it for me.

1019
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,901
- Why?
- And I'm paying him back.

1020
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:32,028
In instalments, just like a bank.

1021
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,490
- OK?
- What does he get?

1022
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:37,158
He gets...
He gets his money back.

1023
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:40,161
He's giving me work
so he's gonna keep me in work.

1024
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:43,873
He's painting the room right now.

1025
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:48,503
I got it back.

1026
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:52,841
With your name.

1027
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,593
- Derek.
- Hey, Connor.

1028
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,928
What's up?

1029
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:58,388
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi, Mr. Nash.

1030
01:06:58,514 --> 01:06:59,973
What's up?
What do you wanna play?

1031
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:07,439
A dominant silverback gorilla.
We've been spotted.

1032
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:31,880
Sheriff's department.
Anybody here?

1033
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:35,425
All right, jump in.

1034
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:40,305
Thank you, Carl.

1035
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,558
- Mr. Curtis, do you have any weapons?
- Mr. Curtis doesn't live here.

1036
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:46,561
- Er, Mr. Nash?
- You're not Mr. Ron Curtis?

1037
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:49,314
No, that's my landlord.
He lives in Miami.

1038
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,067
- You're not the owner of this property?
- No, we rent.

1039
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:55,278
- We've been here for eight years.
- I posted notices on the door.

1040
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:57,947
He said not to worry about it,
he's doing some type of...

1041
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:01,826
- Like a modification or something.
- He scammed you, sir.

1042
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:04,704
Mr. Brady, you've been scammed
by your landlord.

1043
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:08,666
- Now it's 3500, right?
- Yeah.

1044
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,251
3500.

1045
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,880
I can't... I can't get it.

1046
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,478
- Mr. Baldwin?
- Yeah?

1047
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,063
Mr. Nash.

1048
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:33,733
Evening, Mr. Baldwin.
My name is Dennis Nash.

1049
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:35,735
I'm here representing
Rick Carver Realty.

1050
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:39,155
Um, today is the day of your eviction,
I'm afraid to say.

1051
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:42,158
Um... the, er...

1052
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,119
Your house has been...

1053
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,498
- passed over to the bank.
- No, no, no. No, no.

1054
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:49,999
No, I...

1055
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,627
I have a reverse mortgage
on this house.

1056
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:57,173
My wife and I took it out 2 years ago
and we're here forever.

1057
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:01,427
- You violated the terms of the mortgage.
- My wife went down to the bank.

1058
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:02,971
She signed the papers

1059
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:05,640
and that was supposed
to be for her and for me.

1060
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:08,852
Mr. Baldwin, there's a process
that took place.

1061
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,188
All the paperwork was submitted,
signed by a judge. It's all legal.

1062
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,691
You wanna step outside?
You wanna sit with me?

1063
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:19,279
OK, but I don't have the money
to buy the house back.

1064
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:22,532
We did the modification.
They approved it.

1065
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:25,326
- We sent in our first cheque.
- I suggest we figure out a way

1066
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:27,328
to get all your stuff safe in a U-Haul.

1067
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:30,665
I'm gonna have to call my husband.
I could maybe store it

1068
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:34,085
down the street at my sister's house
for the day or something.

1069
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:47,015
The house
isn't yours anymore.

1070
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:52,061
Easy now.

1071
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,147
Anyone know what to do about a bird?

1072
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,154
3500.

1073
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,207
I'm giving you the better option.

1074
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,834
I'm gonna have to send these guys
who are being employed today

1075
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,753
to get your stuff
and throw it on the kerb.

1076
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:19,422
- I don't want to take you to jail.
- You do what you have to.

1077
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:22,175
- You know what you can do with that?
- You folks need to pack up.

1078
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:24,886
You do something else with that
cos I'm not gonna touch it.

1079
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:27,764
You got any family or friends
who can come and pick you up?

1080
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,183
I have a son.
He's up in Michigan.

1081
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,227
But I haven't seen him
in a couple of years.

1082
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:35,605
- Do you have his phone number?
- No, no.

1083
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:37,982
No, I don't. No.

1084
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:39,817
- Nobody you can stay with?
- No, I don't.

1085
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:43,655
Are there any neighbours you can call
to help you out for the night?

1086
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,490
I-I-I... I don't.

1087
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:48,034
I don't know my neighbours anymore.

1088
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,871
I can give you a ride to the Red Cross.
That sound all right?

1089
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:58,169
I can do that.
We'll find you a place, all right?

1090
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:27,490
Say short sale three times
and smile.

1091
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:29,784
Short sale, short sale, short sale.

1092
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,744
That's great. Perfect. Thank you.

1093
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:34,080
- Really nice. Last two.
- All right.

1094
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:35,456
OK.

1095
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,667
Pretty civilised.

1096
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,844
Tesken Equity Management picked up
400 homes in the past two months.

1097
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,679
All cash sales, no loans, $100 million.

1098
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:53,516
Orange County needs your help
in finding another bulk buyer like Tesken.

1099
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:56,978
I see. Then I'd like to know
where that highway is gonna be built

1100
01:11:57,104 --> 01:12:00,523
connecting the 414
and the Apopka Expressway.

1101
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:04,569
Well, that information
is not public knowledge, so...

1102
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:08,406
A lot of property's gonna be affected
by the zoning board's decision, Arthur.

1103
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:16,247
Anything else, Arthur?

1104
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:20,043
OK, yes, I know the route.

1105
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,671
Good. There's a bulk buyer here
out of New York.

1106
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:25,465
Vesic Investment Group.

1107
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:28,968
They're shopping with a piss-ant broker
out of Kissimmee, Ortiz.

1108
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:32,555
- Sold him 15 homes last month.
- Mr. Freeman, I know Ortiz.

1109
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,974
I can get Vesic Investment Group
away from him

1110
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,894
and my team can handle
as many homes as you have to sell.

1111
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,271
Well, I have
upwards of 1,000 homes.

1112
01:12:40,397 --> 01:12:41,647
Possibly more.

1113
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,151
You get me Vesic Investment,
we're in business.

1114
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,404
1,000 homes.

1115
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,740
Do you know how much money
we're talking about?

1116
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:53,159
I want you to track Ortiz,
find out who he's talking to,

1117
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:54,744
what properties he's looking at.

1118
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:57,789
- We got to know what this Vesic deal is.
- What's my cut?

1119
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:01,209
- Don't worry, I'll take care of you.
- I know standard commission is 6%.

1120
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:04,045
So what's my cut?

1121
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,548
I'll give you 5% of my take.

1122
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:10,468
- 10%.
- 6%, and a hand job.

1123
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:12,637
No callouses.

1124
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:16,224
You'll probably pull in
somewhere between 200 and 300K.

1125
01:13:18,268 --> 01:13:21,938
- More than you made in your whole life.
- Yeah, that's more than I ever made.

1126
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:55,471
- 'What do you got?'
- 3217 Lonson Cove.

1127
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:59,183
It's the fifth one.
They're all Bank of Greater Santa Fe.

1128
01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:02,520
'Keep following that cocksucker
and get back to me.'

1129
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:03,980
OK.

1130
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,213
Hey, Frank.

1131
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:33,968
What do you want?
Are you with those guys?

1132
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:36,053
No, no, not at all.

1133
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,681
Er, I've just come to see
how you're doing.

1134
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:44,687
And, um, if you want,
I think I can get you a job.

1135
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:47,398
That's a nice shirt.
You still working with your friend?

1136
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,404
I didn't have to come over here.
I just wanted to, um...

1137
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:57,074
- To what? To lie to me, to cheat me?
- No, to help you if you wanted it.

1138
01:14:57,201 --> 01:15:00,244
Have you figured out
where your kids are gonna stay?

1139
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:02,330
My kids have a home.
This is their home.

1140
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,207
- Well...
- I did research,

1141
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,709
gave boxes of files
to a lawyer pro bono.

1142
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,628
We're gonna win, legally, in court.

1143
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:11,380
It's not gonna make any difference.
I've been there, Frank.

1144
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:12,590
I've been there.

1145
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:18,179
- You gotta be realistic.
- I'm being realistic.

1146
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:21,432
I didn't ask for your help, sir,
and I don't want it. Please leave.

1147
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:25,436
Please get off my property.
You're trespassing.

1148
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:40,076
Hey, are you awake?

1149
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:44,121
Ortiz, the king of Miguels,
is gonna sell 100 homes to Vesic.

1150
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:47,959
They're all in these neighbourhoods,
priced between 165 and 200K.

1151
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,920
We're talking over a $20 million deal

1152
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,838
and it's not mine.

1153
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:57,218
- Holy shit.
- Yup.

1154
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,309
Triple word score.

1155
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,815
- Take that.
- We're working, baby.

1156
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:13,442
Dennis, tell him to take a break.

1157
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:14,819
Take a break, Rick.

1158
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:17,780
You inspire me, OK?

1159
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,448
We'll play later.

1160
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:23,286
Er...

1161
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:31,460
OK, so you know Vesic already bought
15 homes from Ortiz last month.

1162
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,087
So?

1163
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:36,591
So, what if I take all the ACs,

1164
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,259
all the water pumps

1165
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:41,304
and the appliances
out of those homes?

1166
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:45,016
Who do you think
Vesic's gonna blame?

1167
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:46,225
Ortiz.

1168
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:49,562
They'll call Immigration, put him
on his lawn mower back over the border

1169
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:51,981
while I'm on the phone
with Bank of Greater Santa Fe.

1170
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:57,069
Yeah.

1171
01:16:58,363 --> 01:17:00,531
And we'll sell these 100 homes.

1172
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:03,034
And 1,000 more for Freeman.

1173
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,077
I see green skies ahead.

1174
01:17:06,913 --> 01:17:09,790
Put some green in my pocket,
I'll empty those homes tonight.

1175
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:11,375
100 bucks a pop, 1500 bucks.

1176
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:13,336
Big talk. All right, do it.

1177
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,796
- Tell him to hurry up.
- We got that cube truck too.

1178
01:17:15,922 --> 01:17:17,673
- HVAC pool pump.
- HVAC pool pump.

1179
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,009
But come this way too.
I wanna show you something.

1180
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,768
- Are you going in?
- No, you're going in.

1181
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:32,438
Nah, that's B&E, man.
That's guaranteed time right there.

1182
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:35,316
It's not B&E if you got a key.
We're doing appliances too.

1183
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:38,402
We're doing fridges,
stoves, dishwashers.

1184
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:40,404
- You gonna take care of me?
- You know I will.

1185
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:42,490
Whatever I can afford.
You know that.

1186
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:46,619
I'm heading to handle this cash-for-keys
Rick wanted me to do.

1187
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:49,538
Yeah. Hold on.

1188
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:54,585
1485 Lake Shore Circle.

1189
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:56,462
Is that property for sale?

1190
01:17:57,214 --> 01:18:00,174
Does it have a swimming pool?
All right. I'll call you back.

1191
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:18,526
3, 2, 1.

1192
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,325
Derek, over here.

1193
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:29,453
- Every put your hands out.
- Yes!

1194
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:34,750
Happy birthday!

1195
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:38,754
All right, Mountain Dew.
What's happening?

1196
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:41,841
- Who wants it?
- Connor.

1197
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:45,261
God, Dad!

1198
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:49,849
- What do you think?
- Awesome!

1199
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,686
Jump on it. Jump on it.
Sit down on it. Sit down on it.

1200
01:18:55,355 --> 01:18:56,939
Show us what you got.

1201
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:00,025
Nice.

1202
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:05,114
Careful.
Car, guys.

1203
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:10,995
Hey.

1204
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,667
Hey, Connor. Let's see
if these guys want some of your cake.

1205
01:19:16,793 --> 01:19:18,961
Do we have a cheese pizza left?

1206
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:21,464
Do you guys wanna ask them
if they want some cheese pizza

1207
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,841
and some birthday cake?

1208
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:26,177
- All right, I gotta get Derek home.
- OK.

1209
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:28,637
I'm gonna grab that cheese pizza
and some cake.

1210
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,182
I think it's nice for them
to say hi to these guys.

1211
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:33,142
- I gotta get Derek home.
- Hey!

1212
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:35,519
Hey, where are you going?

1213
01:19:36,396 --> 01:19:37,438
Hey, you!

1214
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,024
Over here.

1215
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:43,903
- I'm talking to you.
- You're talking to me?

1216
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:46,197
What are you doing here?
Are you following me?

1217
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:48,949
No, I live here.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1218
01:19:49,075 --> 01:19:52,203
- Yeah, I know who you are.
- Have a good day.

1219
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:55,206
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean? I live here.

1220
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:56,832
I just told you.
I don't know you.

1221
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,585
No, you're Rick Carver Realty.
I know exactly who you are.

1222
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:01,629
- You don't know me.
- Oh, I know you.

1223
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:04,548
- You kicked me out of my home.
- What?

1224
01:20:04,674 --> 01:20:07,009
I don't know you, bud.
Come over here and we'll talk.

1225
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:11,222
Why would I walk over here?
Nash. That's your name, isn't it?

1226
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:13,641
You don't want
everybody else to hear about it,

1227
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,601
what a fucking arsehole you are

1228
01:20:15,727 --> 01:20:18,687
and how you kicked me
and my entire family out of our home?

1229
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:21,232
- You got me mixed up with someone.
- No, I don't.

1230
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:22,942
I know exactly who you are.

1231
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,693
Oh, you know it was you.

1232
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,737
And here everybody else
is gonna know.

1233
01:20:26,863 --> 01:20:29,073
- Just calm down.
- You kicked me out of my home.

1234
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:32,576
You ruined my fucking life.
No, you don't get to go anywhere.

1235
01:20:32,702 --> 01:20:34,453
- Dennis!
- Don't do that.

1236
01:20:34,579 --> 01:20:36,664
- Don't you tell me what to do.
- Get inside.

1237
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:38,916
- Get inside.
- Yeah, get inside.

1238
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:42,211
- Don't fucking talk to her like that.
- What are you gonna fucking do?

1239
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:44,380
Please, guys. Please!

1240
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,051
Go inside, go inside!

1241
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:51,428
- Take him inside!
- OK.

1242
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:54,181
- Go, go, go.
- You little fucking piece of shit.

1243
01:20:54,307 --> 01:20:57,059
- You ruined my life.
- I'm not fucking with this guy.

1244
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:58,644
Yeah, you better not fuck with me.

1245
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:00,604
- I don't know you, man.
- You know me.

1246
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,398
- I don't know you.
- Bullshit!

1247
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:06,652
- I don't fucking know you.
- I know you, Rick Carver Realty.

1248
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:09,738
I know you
and I'll see you every day,

1249
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:13,284
when you wake up, when you go to bed,
when your fucking kids are playing.

1250
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:28,841
You OK?

1251
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,803
How did he know your name?

1252
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:36,265
I don't know.

1253
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,728
- Cos he knew your face too, right?
- Yeah.

1254
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:42,563
Yeah, I know.

1255
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:45,399
Maybe I worked on his house.
I work on foreclosed homes.

1256
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:47,735
Maybe he saw me at his home.
I don't know.

1257
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,028
Rick Carver.

1258
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:51,447
Right?

1259
01:21:56,786 --> 01:21:59,204
How did he know your name?

1260
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:00,456
Fucking arsehole!

1261
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,710
- We gotta get Connor out of here.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

1262
01:22:04,836 --> 01:22:07,087
- Now.
- That's what I'm trying to do, Mum.

1263
01:22:07,213 --> 01:22:08,255
Right now.

1264
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:10,341
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Fuck you!

1265
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:12,468
- You motherfucker.
- Fuck you!

1266
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:15,429
OK, we need to go.
We need to get out of here, OK?

1267
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:18,140
Have some fucking balls.

1268
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:23,854
- Are you evicting people?
- Mum!

1269
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:27,316
- He said you were at his eviction.
- I don't know that fucking guy.

1270
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:29,568
I don't know how he knows me.
I work on homes.

1271
01:22:29,694 --> 01:22:32,029
I work on foreclosed homes, Mum.

1272
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:36,867
This guy was being foreclosed on.
Maybe he saw me working on his home.

1273
01:22:36,993 --> 01:22:38,953
Maybe. I don't know.

1274
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:40,829
- OK?
- Just tell me.

1275
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,623
I'm telling you.

1276
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,796
Bolt the door. Don't leave.

1277
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:05,813
Disney World, Sea World,
Universal Studios.

1278
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:08,691
Downtown Orlando's
about 20 miles behind us.

1279
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:11,777
And then at your nine o'clock
are the vacant Greater Santa Fe homes.

1280
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:14,822
Wow, I never realised
how close they were to Shinola.

1281
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:16,031
Mm-hm.

1282
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:19,702
- About the Santa Fe deal.
- It hasn't even been a week

1283
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,413
since we picked up 15 homes from Ortiz

1284
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:27,167
and all the ACs, water pumps,
appliances are missing.

1285
01:23:27,293 --> 01:23:30,587
- You're kidding me.
- Hidden expenses, they kill returns

1286
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:32,756
so Vesic's not interested anymore.

1287
01:23:32,882 --> 01:23:35,968
That Santa Fe deal's like
one giant ATM machine.

1288
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:38,429
What can I do to get Vesic
back into those homes?

1289
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:40,848
I just don't think
that's gonna be possible.

1290
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,016
How about this?

1291
01:23:42,142 --> 01:23:46,687
I'll put brand-new appliances
in all 15 of those homes free of charge

1292
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:48,939
if you move the deal
from Ortiz over to me.

1293
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,066
I tell you what.

1294
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:54,111
You put brand-new ACs,
appliances, water pumps

1295
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:56,280
in any of the 100 homes that need 'em

1296
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:58,032
you got yourself a deal.

1297
01:23:59,325 --> 01:24:01,368
Appliances, yeah.

1298
01:24:02,954 --> 01:24:04,580
ACs and water pumps, no.

1299
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,044
OK.

1300
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:13,422
But the homes have
to be vacated in 30 days.

1301
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:17,551
Put it in writing, it's a deal.

1302
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:36,570
Hey! Look at that!

1303
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:39,073
Bring him in. Bring him in.

1304
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:48,165
The Santa Fe deal,
I'll give you 6% of my share.

1305
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:52,586
Around $63,000 before taxes.

1306
01:24:57,342 --> 01:25:00,302
OK. I mean, I guess
I can accept that. That's fine.

1307
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:03,013
Yeah, I can deal with that amount.
$63,000 did you say?

1308
01:25:03,139 --> 01:25:06,100
- What are you boys up to?
- Aren't you so sweet?

1309
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:08,769
I used to dream about one home.
Now it's 100.

1310
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:11,480
All right.

1311
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:13,190
- Dreams.
- To dreams.

1312
01:25:13,316 --> 01:25:15,400
Fuck dreams. To 100 homes.

1313
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:34,253
Hey!

1314
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:50,686
Uh-oh. Zombies coming to get me.

1315
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:02,156
- Oh, fuck.
- Damn, pilgrim.

1316
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:20,048
Did anyone ever come up to you
after an eviction?

1317
01:26:23,928 --> 01:26:26,680
Yeah, someone tried
to run me off the road last year.

1318
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:32,186
I haven't gone out to dinner once

1319
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:34,354
with my wife and girls
in the last three years

1320
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,981
without looking over my shoulder.

1321
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:39,526
That's why I carry this.

1322
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,742
Even now at 5am.

1323
01:26:57,879 --> 01:26:59,588
Is it worth it?

1324
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,674
As opposed to what?

1325
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:08,388
Did somebody get to you?

1326
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:19,233
Don't bullshit me.
Someone's calling you.

1327
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:20,776
Or they tried to find you.

1328
01:27:25,698 --> 01:27:27,491
So, Nash,

1329
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:30,702
the sun's gonna come up
and here we are.

1330
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:31,912
What do you think?

1331
01:27:33,998 --> 01:27:35,666
Huh.

1332
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:39,670
- Think about what?
- Well, you wanted to kill me once.

1333
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:42,130
Now you're gonna make a lot of money.

1334
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,259
I did want to kill you.

1335
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:49,554
I don't know.

1336
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:52,224
I don't know what I'm doing here either,
but I'm thankful.

1337
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:56,311
You know.

1338
01:27:58,815 --> 01:28:01,733
I don't know. What could I do?
You know, my dad...

1339
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:04,653
Well, he killed himself pretty much.

1340
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:10,575
Fuck it, no. Sorry.
I don't wanna waste your booze.

1341
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:16,081
He... He died of a heart attack.

1342
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:18,250
Booze, food.
Whatever you wanna call it.

1343
01:28:20,003 --> 01:28:21,378
Left me with my mum.

1344
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:23,839
My boy.

1345
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,551
My boy, my boy.

1346
01:28:32,598 --> 01:28:33,974
As opposed to what?

1347
01:28:35,768 --> 01:28:38,061
I gotta get out of that motel now.

1348
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:42,482
I gotta get into my home.
I gotta get my family out.

1349
01:28:42,608 --> 01:28:45,652
It's gotta be listed on the MLS,
for sale.

1350
01:28:45,778 --> 01:28:47,404
- I need it.
- 2 more weeks, OK?

1351
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:48,989
I need it now.

1352
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:52,034
- Get another one.
- Help me with it.

1353
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,036
You got the money.
Buy whatever you want.

1354
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:55,829
There's plenty of homes in the sea.

1355
01:28:57,123 --> 01:28:59,041
Like I said,

1356
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:02,502
don't get emotional
about real estate, Nash.

1357
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:05,255
They're boxes.

1358
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:07,132
You listening?

1359
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:10,761
Big boxes, small boxes.

1360
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:13,597
What matters is how many you got.

1361
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:17,893
You're gonna have more properties

1362
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,103
than women to fill them with.

1363
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:21,897
You know that, right?

1364
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:26,276
You love your mum, you love your kid.
Buy 'em a house.

1365
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:28,779
Buy one for your mum.
Buy one for your kid.

1366
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:30,405
Buy one for yourself.

1367
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:32,282
What do I care? Jesus.

1368
01:29:32,408 --> 01:29:33,784
100 homes.

1369
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:37,120
1,000 fucking homes.

1370
01:29:40,249 --> 01:29:43,335
Watch out for the gators.
They don't sleep.

1371
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:45,629
And make sure I don't roll in the water.

1372
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,946
Why are we going this way?

1373
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,283
I just wanna show you something.

1374
01:30:31,717 --> 01:30:33,844
Dennis, what are we doing?

1375
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:36,096
Just trust me
and follow me, please.

1376
01:30:45,898 --> 01:30:48,358
- What is this?
- Have a look.

1377
01:30:48,484 --> 01:30:49,526
Why?

1378
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:53,572
Will you just have a look?

1379
01:30:57,994 --> 01:31:00,454
- It's a cool pool.
- Cool pool.

1380
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:03,165
I'd say.

1381
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:05,417
Makes you wanna dive in, right?

1382
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:09,045
- Whose basketball goal is that?
- That belongs to Shaquille O'Neil.

1383
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:11,840
He lowered it cos he likes to dunk
from sitting down.

1384
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:16,011
- Can we go now, please?
- Have you seen the pool?

1385
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:19,806
I bought this for you.

1386
01:31:22,602 --> 01:31:25,729
And you. That's your pool.
This is your house.

1387
01:31:25,855 --> 01:31:27,314
Let's go home. This isn't funny.

1388
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,983
- I'm not joking, Mum.
- That's not his basketball net.

1389
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:33,695
This is somebody else's
and I want our house.

1390
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:35,780
I wanna go home.

1391
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:38,492
We don't have that home anymore.
I sold it.

1392
01:31:41,078 --> 01:31:43,163
I sold our old home
and I bought this.

1393
01:31:43,289 --> 01:31:46,374
Fresh start. I don't wanna go back
to that house we were evicted from.

1394
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,460
You sold our house?

1395
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:50,962
We couldn't move into our old home
for 2 to 3 weeks

1396
01:31:51,088 --> 01:31:54,716
so I had to get us out of that motel
so that Connor wouldn't get killed.

1397
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:58,470
By kicking people out?
By kicking people out of their houses?

1398
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:01,223
- You buy this?
- I didn't kick anybody out of this home.

1399
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:03,141
I bought this home
with money I earned

1400
01:32:03,267 --> 01:32:06,645
so I could put a roof over your head
and I could put food in his mouth.

1401
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:09,856
- We were drowning, Mum.
- This stops here.

1402
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:14,236
I bought this fair and square.

1403
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:16,655
- I didn't take it from anybody.
- I'm gonna call Jimmy

1404
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:20,617
and we're going to Tampa, OK?
Come on, Connor.

1405
01:32:20,743 --> 01:32:22,202
I'm gonna call my brother.

1406
01:32:22,328 --> 01:32:26,248
We're gonna go to Tampa
and you're gonna figure this out.

1407
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:28,124
I did this for the boy.
We were drowning.

1408
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:31,670
Rick Carver? Rick Carver
who bought our house for us?

1409
01:32:33,839 --> 01:32:36,299
I'm not staying here.
I'm not staying in this home.

1410
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:41,096
What do you want?

1411
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:32,731
Is Connor OK?

1412
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:34,190
He's sleeping.

1413
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:43,825
Hey, Rick.

1414
01:33:45,828 --> 01:33:46,995
Yeah, sure.

1415
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:49,164
OK.

1416
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:10,727
- Give it to him.
- Yep, all right.

1417
01:34:11,854 --> 01:34:14,022
- See you, fellas.
- 9:45.

1418
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:15,190
Yes, sir.

1419
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:18,485
- Goddamn it.
- What is it?

1420
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:23,198
One Santa Fe homeowner is gonna try
and block his eviction in court today.

1421
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:26,242
If he's successful and others follow,
Vesic will pull out.

1422
01:34:27,578 --> 01:34:29,412
This is proof of publication.

1423
01:34:29,538 --> 01:34:31,623
It wasn't filed 2 years ago,

1424
01:34:31,749 --> 01:34:33,792
so Freeman's boys
backdated and notarised it.

1425
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:36,920
Now, I need you to be
at the courthouse plaza at 9:45am.

1426
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:40,131
The court clerk will meet you there.
Just give it to him, OK?

1427
01:34:40,966 --> 01:34:42,842
This is forged?

1428
01:34:42,968 --> 01:34:45,136
It's a stupid piece of paper
someone forgot to file

1429
01:34:45,262 --> 01:34:48,014
when the loan was being bought
and sold a million times over.

1430
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:49,933
It's just a technicality.

1431
01:34:54,146 --> 01:34:55,689
- It's Frank Greene.
- Yeah.

1432
01:34:55,815 --> 01:34:59,442
Same deadbeat stealing my water
and power. I told you he was no good.

1433
01:35:02,154 --> 01:35:05,115
Hey, that's not your dick
in your hand, son.

1434
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:07,033
That is the Santa Fe deal.

1435
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:10,870
100 homes, 1,000 more for Freeman.
Our money, Miami.

1436
01:35:10,996 --> 01:35:13,123
Your home, everything.

1437
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:15,500
- Got me?
- Mm-hm, yeah, I do.

1438
01:35:15,626 --> 01:35:18,002
Don't "mm-hm, yeah, I do" me.

1439
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:20,004
Courthouse plaza, 9:45am.

1440
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:38,857
Hey, honey.

1441
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:54,956
- Hi.
- Say hello.

1442
01:35:55,082 --> 01:35:56,458
Hi, Mr. Peters.

1443
01:36:36,665 --> 01:36:39,375
- Hello.
- What the hell is going on?

1444
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:41,169
'What do you mean?'

1445
01:36:41,295 --> 01:36:44,923
You get your arse over there now
or consider your life over, do you hear?

1446
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:47,175
- Where are you?
- 'I'm here now.'

1447
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:48,760
And?

1448
01:36:50,095 --> 01:36:52,430
- I'm about to do it now.
- 'You dumb fuck.'

1449
01:36:52,556 --> 01:36:54,974
You call me as soon as it's done.

1450
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:56,601
You hear me?

1451
01:37:17,039 --> 01:37:18,998
Hey.

1452
01:37:19,124 --> 01:37:21,417
Hey. Hey.

1453
01:37:22,127 --> 01:37:23,169
Hey!

1454
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:27,590
Are you with Rick Carver?

1455
01:37:27,716 --> 01:37:29,843
Are you with Rick Carver?

1456
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:32,887
Are you with Carver or not?

1457
01:37:33,013 --> 01:37:34,389
Is that it?

1458
01:37:37,601 --> 01:37:38,810
Idiot!

1459
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:44,941
As far as I can tell
the proof of publication is here.

1460
01:37:45,067 --> 01:37:47,151
Your Honour,
we have a buyer in place

1461
01:37:47,278 --> 01:37:49,445
and we'd like to get
this property on the books.

1462
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:53,491
If we check the fall index
this has not been docketed.

1463
01:37:53,617 --> 01:37:56,452
Well, that may be,
but the proof is in the file.

1464
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:59,664
That's all the statute requires.
I'm ordering the sale to go forward.

1465
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:02,834
Your Honour, we know for a fact
that the files weren't there.

1466
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,252
ESP versus Ballard.

1467
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:08,464
Your Honour, I know
that there was no proof of publication.

1468
01:38:08,591 --> 01:38:10,174
- You can't look at me...
- What is it?

1469
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:12,093
I have a wife and I have...

1470
01:38:12,219 --> 01:38:14,971
These guys. You see them?

1471
01:38:15,097 --> 01:38:17,640
You see my wife and my children?

1472
01:38:51,717 --> 01:38:52,759
Connor?

1473
01:38:57,014 --> 01:38:58,389
Mum? Connor?

1474
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,642
Connor?

1475
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:14,697
'Please record your message
after the tone. When you have...'

1476
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:09,711
'Hey, Rick.'

1477
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:12,171
Morning, Donald Trump.
I'm outside your new mansion.

1478
01:40:12,297 --> 01:40:15,425
Where are you?
Frank Greene's eviction. Let's go.

1479
01:40:16,802 --> 01:40:18,886
'Hello? Dumb arse, are you there?'

1480
01:40:23,267 --> 01:40:26,561
There's 8 other homeowners
we got to evict after Greene.

1481
01:40:27,938 --> 01:40:30,732
I'll start out nice
with an aggressive cash-for-keys.

1482
01:40:30,858 --> 01:40:33,776
I'll pay out of my own pocket
if I have to. I don't give a shit.

1483
01:40:33,902 --> 01:40:36,696
But if they give me any flak,

1484
01:40:36,822 --> 01:40:39,157
Freeman's boys
and the court clerk, baby.

1485
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:41,534
No big deal.

1486
01:40:46,415 --> 01:40:48,332
We've been neighbours for a long time

1487
01:40:48,459 --> 01:40:51,753
and I've never seen
anything like this before.

1488
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,921
Do you know if they have
any guns in the house?

1489
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:56,382
- I mean, he likes to hunt.
- He's a hunter?

1490
01:40:56,508 --> 01:40:58,426
Yeah, he likes to hunt.

1491
01:40:58,552 --> 01:41:02,722
She gripes a lot,
but he's a pretty even-keeled guy.

1492
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:05,433
- Not hot-tempered or anything?
- No, I wouldn't say that.

1493
01:41:05,559 --> 01:41:08,519
I can tell you, it's been really hard.
His wife's been a worried wreck.

1494
01:41:08,645 --> 01:41:12,231
Morning, Rick. We may have
some trouble with Mr. Greene, the tenant.

1495
01:41:12,357 --> 01:41:14,525
He and his wife
have been looking into stuff.

1496
01:41:14,651 --> 01:41:17,904
Well, I mean, you know.
Look, last night I heard 'em yelling.

1497
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,864
Ma'am, thank you.

1498
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:23,242
We're not marriage counsellors, OK?
Let's get cooking.

1499
01:41:23,368 --> 01:41:26,788
The problem is,
this guy may be armed.

1500
01:41:28,624 --> 01:41:30,625
Go find out.
I got two more evictions today.

1501
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:33,920
All right. I'll contact Orlando PD,
get a back-up come in and check it out.

1502
01:41:34,046 --> 01:41:37,715
- Is his family in there with him?
- The kids didn't go to school.

1503
01:41:37,841 --> 01:41:39,383
They're definitely home.

1504
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:42,804
She came over this morning, crying,

1505
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:45,098
until he called her back in.

1506
01:41:49,895 --> 01:41:51,354
I'll go and check it out.

1507
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,564
Thanks for the play-by-play.
Hurry up.

1508
01:41:57,653 --> 01:41:59,779
Watch out! Get back!

1509
01:41:59,905 --> 01:42:00,988
Run!

1510
01:42:03,075 --> 01:42:05,118
I do not wanna hurt anybody.

1511
01:42:05,244 --> 01:42:06,994
Sir, put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

1512
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:09,789
Put the gun down, sir.
Put the gun down, sir.

1513
01:42:09,915 --> 01:42:12,875
You put that down.
My wife and kids are in this house.

1514
01:42:13,001 --> 01:42:15,628
Get your gun. You don't have it?

1515
01:42:16,505 --> 01:42:18,881
- Dumb shit.
- Sir, put the weapon down.

1516
01:42:19,007 --> 01:42:20,800
Trespassing.

1517
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:24,011
- Sir, don't do that.
- Shots fired, shots fired.

1518
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:27,390
- You wanna shoot my kids?
- Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

1519
01:42:27,516 --> 01:42:29,725
I am not gonna leave here.
Go in the bedroom.

1520
01:42:29,852 --> 01:42:31,727
Don't stand there.
Get in the bedroom.

1521
01:42:31,854 --> 01:42:33,271
Now.

1522
01:42:33,397 --> 01:42:35,189
- I shot at the grass.
- Put the gun down.

1523
01:42:35,315 --> 01:42:37,608
God damn it, stop it.
Put that down.

1524
01:42:37,734 --> 01:42:40,278
- Put it down now.
- Not gonna happen, sir.

1525
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:43,281
Sir, why don't you send
your wife and kids out?

1526
01:42:45,325 --> 01:42:47,743
Send your wife and kids out.

1527
01:42:51,456 --> 01:42:53,332
Sir, drop your weapon.

1528
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:04,177
The court decided my case
in 60 seconds flat.

1529
01:43:04,303 --> 01:43:07,597
Nobody checked the file index. Fact.

1530
01:43:07,723 --> 01:43:11,726
No proof of publication filed. Fact.

1531
01:43:11,852 --> 01:43:15,605
Nobody looked at the cancelled cheques
to prove bank payment. Fact.

1532
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:20,026
The judge, he wasn't up for re-election.

1533
01:43:20,152 --> 01:43:24,030
He wasn't beholden
to anybody in this county.

1534
01:43:24,156 --> 01:43:27,366
60 seconds for a lifetime
and this is my home.

1535
01:43:27,492 --> 01:43:29,076
Dad.

1536
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:30,745
Get in the bedroom.

1537
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:33,664
- Get in the bedroom!
- No, Dennis.

1538
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:35,625
- Dennis.
- Get the fuck off.

1539
01:43:35,751 --> 01:43:38,586
- No.
- Sir, Mr. Nash.

1540
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:42,131
- What the hell are you waiting for?
- Mr. Nash, get back behind the car.

1541
01:43:42,257 --> 01:43:43,633
Get back! Sir, get back!

1542
01:43:43,759 --> 01:43:45,259
Stop! Stay right there.

1543
01:43:45,385 --> 01:43:47,345
I'm gonna shoot you.
I will shoot.

1544
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:49,555
- This is my home.
- Listen to me.

1545
01:43:49,681 --> 01:43:51,390
- Get off of my lawn.
- This is your lawn.

1546
01:43:51,516 --> 01:43:53,643
- This is your home, I know.
- What are you gonna do?

1547
01:43:53,769 --> 01:43:56,896
Do you hear me?
The banks made more money...

1548
01:43:57,022 --> 01:43:59,899
- Frank.
- I have got the right to shoot anybody

1549
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:02,276
who is on my property,
who sets foot on my property.

1550
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:05,655
- I don't want to do this.
- Frank, I know this is your home.

1551
01:44:05,781 --> 01:44:08,950
Put the gun down
and let your family out, please.

1552
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:10,952
Look up there. Look up there!

1553
01:44:12,746 --> 01:44:13,996
You see that?

1554
01:44:14,831 --> 01:44:16,791
That is the sun

1555
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:18,793
and it is shining.

1556
01:44:18,919 --> 01:44:21,879
Nobody is gonna tell me
it is night when it is day.

1557
01:44:22,005 --> 01:44:25,341
And God Almighty could come down here
and tell me it's night

1558
01:44:25,926 --> 01:44:27,802
and I would know that it's day,

1559
01:44:28,845 --> 01:44:31,931
because I know what I know.

1560
01:44:32,057 --> 01:44:36,102
And nobody is gonna tell me
the sun isn't shining. Nobody.

1561
01:44:37,604 --> 01:44:38,980
I cheated you.

1562
01:44:42,985 --> 01:44:46,654
I put a forged document in your file

1563
01:44:47,656 --> 01:44:49,865
on the day of your court hearing, Frank.

1564
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:58,416
This is your home.

1565
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:30,489
All right, I'm coming out.

1566
01:45:32,367 --> 01:45:34,702
All right, sir.
Keep your hands up.

1567
01:45:34,828 --> 01:45:36,579
Walk this way slowly
with your hands up.

1568
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:41,167
- Hands up.
- Put your hands up. Hands in the air.

1569
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:43,419
Walk out slowly.
Keep your hands in the air.

1570
01:45:43,545 --> 01:45:45,296
Keep walking. Keep walking.

1571
01:45:46,506 --> 01:45:49,258
Stop. Turn around, face the home.

1572
01:45:49,384 --> 01:45:51,302
Turn around, turn around.

1573
01:45:51,428 --> 01:45:53,804
Now walk slowly
towards the sound of my voice.

1574
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:56,307
Stop. Go down on your knees, sir.

1575
01:45:56,433 --> 01:45:59,685
Lie down on your stomach, sir,
with your arms extended to the side.

1576
01:46:02,856 --> 01:46:04,398
We're coming in, ma'am.

1577
01:46:11,573 --> 01:46:13,199
Stand up.

1578
01:46:13,325 --> 01:46:16,577
Got anything on you that could
poke me, stick in me, hurt me?

1579
01:46:16,703 --> 01:46:17,787
Call it in.

1580
01:46:17,913 --> 01:46:19,121
No, sir. No.

1581
01:46:20,248 --> 01:46:22,833
All right. You have the right
to remain silent.

1582
01:46:22,959 --> 01:46:24,877
Anything you say
can be used against you.

1583
01:46:25,003 --> 01:46:27,880
You have a right to have an attorney
present during questioning.

1584
01:46:28,006 --> 01:46:30,633
If you can't afford one,
the court will appoint one for you.

1585
01:46:30,759 --> 01:46:31,842
Sir.

1586
01:46:31,968 --> 01:46:34,220
OK, I just wanted...
He didn't do anything.

1587
01:46:34,346 --> 01:46:36,222
- He didn't do anything wrong.
- Calm down.

1588
01:46:36,348 --> 01:46:39,809
- What is your business here?
- I came here to evict Mr. Greene.

1589
01:46:39,935 --> 01:46:42,186
- Who are you working with?
- Rick Carver Realty.

1590
01:46:42,979 --> 01:46:45,398
- Is Rick Carver here today?
- There he is right there.

1591
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:56,242
That's a hell of a thing you did, son.

1592
01:46:57,285 --> 01:46:59,328
Hell of a thing.

1593
01:46:59,454 --> 01:47:00,913
You Rick Carver?

1594
01:47:02,916 --> 01:47:04,375
Sir, are you Rick Carver?

1595
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:06,502
Thank you.

1596
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:11,298
Yes, sir, I am.

1597
01:47:11,425 --> 01:47:13,134
We need to speak to you.
Don't leave.

1598
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:14,301
Mm-hm.
