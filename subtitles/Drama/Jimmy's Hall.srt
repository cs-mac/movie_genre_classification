1
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,984
I say there'll be a crowd at the house
tonight for you, Jimmy, huh?

2
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,319
When did they let you out, Mossie?

3
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:19,740
Just a month ago,
after the new government came in, like.

4
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,159
How long did you serve?

5
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,579
3 years.

6
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,165
Awful tough on Angela.

7
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,879
We had to send our eldest one, Kate,
off to her auntie in Scotland.

8
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,593
- Is she back yet?
- Nah, I have to find some work first.

9
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,026
Sorry old state now, Jimmy, huh?

10
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,031
Meself and Tommy keep an eye on the roof
as best we can like, but...

11
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,951
Some ghosts in there, eh?

12
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,370
I still miss it.

13
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,122
Go on, Dixie.

14
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,549
Go on, Dixie. Walk on.

15
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,346
Well, now.

16
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,310
Whoa, Dixie. Stand there now.

17
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,484
Stand.

18
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,111
Mam!

19
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,404
James!

20
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,250
- You're back.
- How are you?

21
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,377
Too long. Too long.

22
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,588
I know. Sorry I didn't make it back
for Charlie's funeral.

23
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,216
Just been to the grave.

24
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,470
Oh, he was a good son,
but this farm is a mess without him.

25
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,312
Ah, you bastard.

26
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,966
God bless you, Jimmy.

27
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,770
Hey-hey!

28
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,064
Where's this bloody rogue?

29
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,524
I could smell you were back.

30
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,069
Great to see you.
I can't believe they let you out.

31
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,696
About bloody time. Did you get lost?

32
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,824
You were sorely missed, Jimmy.
Great to have you back.

33
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,950
Thank you, Finn.

34
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,244
- I believe you got married recently.
- I did.

35
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,955
There's some fierce desperate women
in Leitrim...

36
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,418
Well, Jimmy. Jimmy.

37
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:02,213
You must have been around the world
20 times by now.

38
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,091
Well, thanks be to God
you're back here now with your mother

39
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,510
because, you know,
it was lonely here for her.

40
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,011
Very, very lonely.

41
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,347
I missed you so much.

42
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,434
Well, I'm home now to look
after you. It's great to see you all.

43
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,061
Lovely to see you, Jimmy.

44
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,230
What will you do
with yourself, Jimmy?

45
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:23,859
Well, I'll settle back down with Mam,
and I've missed the land.

46
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,946
- I want a quiet life now.
- Oh, I'll take bets on that.

47
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,073
Eh? A quiet life.

48
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,574
You're on! 10 to 1.

49
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,410
I'll have some of your Yankee dollars
off you, boy, huh?

50
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,079
I'm gonna hold you to that.

51
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,719
Oonagh. Oonagh!

52
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,647
- For your children.
- Oh, thank you.

53
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,737
For you.

54
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,032
OK.

55
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,247
You look well, Oonagh.

56
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,169
A bit grey around the edges.

57
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,546
Still like a hungry whippet, though.

58
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,426
Why did you stop writing, Jimmy?

59
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,970
You know why.

60
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,850
How are the children?

61
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,562
Healthy. Full of spirit, thank God.

62
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:47,860
- And Fintan?
- A good, steady man. Loving father.

63
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,866
- You?
- Ah. Same as ever.

64
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,578
Nobody's the same
after 10 years, Jimmy.

65
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,375
I have to get back. Thanks for these.

66
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,499
Hey, Jimmy.

67
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,516
He's very quiet.

68
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,394
Ah, give him time.

69
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,148
He's not the same man
that went away.

70
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,358
- Ah, he'll settle.
- Will he?

71
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,279
He might. He might.

72
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,327
Far cry from New York,
eh, Jimmy?

73
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,370
You don't get this down on Broadway.

74
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:09,001
And here you are back down
the same feckin' bog in Leitrim, huh?

75
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,545
- Wet feet.
- And a wet arse.

76
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:19,970
Aye, but nobody yelling orders at ya.
Can't beat that.

77
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,936
Well, word... word travels fast.

78
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,941
Must be a great relief
to see your son again.

79
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,151
It is.

80
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,447
- Is he well?
- He's very well, Father.

81
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,948
Thank you.

82
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,869
A lot of water under the bridge.

83
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,996
But, you know,
New York is a tough place.

84
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:50,751
It'll be quite a shock from city life
to our humble country ways.

85
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,422
Do you think he's matured?

86
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:59,468
Well, we all change, Father.
Wouldn't you agree?

87
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,097
Well, God willing,
we all change for the better.

88
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,892
Do you think he'll, er...
do you think he'll stay?

89
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,812
He was born in this house, Father.

90
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,774
The decision will be his.
I will leave that up to him.

91
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,444
You know, we've suffered great violence
in this country, Alice.

92
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:18,570
Yeah.

93
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,782
Brother against brother,
and neighbour against neighbour.

94
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,786
Scars on the heart,
they take a long time to heal.

95
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:32,251
But I... I sense a new atmosphere,
you know, of... of change.

96
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,002
Of forgiveness.

97
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,089
Would you agree?

98
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,885
Oh, I would agree, Father,
but there must be mutual respect.

99
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,639
Well, let's pray there'll be
no slipping back to the old ways.

100
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,183
Oh, by the way, tell your son

101
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,728
if the quietness of the country
gets too much for a man of action,

102
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:55,899
I have some excellent contacts in London
who could find him a very good job,

103
00:12:55,984 --> 00:13:01,280
which, of course, would be a great
relief to a mother in these hard times.

104
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,285
Where would you be now
without a nice cup of tea, huh?

105
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:09,997
Absolutely lost, Father.

106
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,975
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on, boy.

107
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,687
Sorry to stop your fun.

108
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,069
Are you who I think you are?

109
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,862
Are you, J... Jimmy Gralton?

110
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,697
And who wants to know?

111
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,533
My name's Marie O'Keefe.

112
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,493
Daughter of Dennis O'Keefe?

113
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,870
He hates you with a passion.

114
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,498
Nearly had a fit
when the priest said you were back.

115
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,458
Did he now? Come on.

116
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,718
Dance away now.

117
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,264
Have you seen O'Keefe?

118
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:55,352
He left the Free State Army a few years
back there after his first wife died.

119
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,271
He was on his own
with Marie for a while,

120
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,731
and then he struck gold
and married into land.

121
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,067
He's mad as hell
about the change of government,

122
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,902
calling de Valera a communist.

123
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:08,073
Big shot now in the Army Comrades
Association. You know them?

124
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,826
Yeah, afraid they won't be able
to export to England.

125
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,286
Ah, bunch of fascists.

126
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,081
Stay well clear of him. Nasty as ever.

127
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,292
And with a long memory.

128
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,130
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy!

129
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,008
- Jimmy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

130
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,094
- Stop, stop, stop.
- What's all this, the Wild West?

131
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,846
Can we have a word?

132
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,515
- Well, are we under arrest?
- Not yet, anyway.

133
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,643
- Go ahead, ask him.
- I won't ask him. You ask him.

134
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:40,188
The hall, Jimmy.
We've all heard stories, lots of them.

135
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,859
My brother's been telling me the stories
of when he used to box in the gym.

136
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,237
Tommy, if the hall was fixed up,
you could do the woodwork lessons.

137
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:51,325
My uncle did the woodwork lessons. He's
one of the best carpenters in the town.

138
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,785
Tess could use the hall
for her art classes.

139
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,912
The paintings and drawings
are wonderful.

140
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,331
I met Sean yesterday,

141
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:00,751
and he still has all his poetry
and books from the foreign countries.

142
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,795
He said he'd do the lessons again
if there was a hall there.

143
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,839
He really wants to do it. Please, Jimmy.

144
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,259
And the music by Molly
and the singing by Oonagh.

145
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,428
There's nothing
round here for us.

146
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,889
There's no work.
There's nowhere for us to go.

147
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,891
We can't go to America
the same as yourself.

148
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,644
The rules of immigration has changed.
We're stuck here.

149
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:22,064
Stop going around in circles.
Just ask the man what we came here for.

150
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:26,151
We want to dance, Jimmy. Somewhere where
we won't be getting a guard or a priest

151
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,445
poking at us with a stick.

152
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:32,282
Somewhere warm. Please, Jimmy,
will you open up the hall again?

153
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,575
Aye.

154
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,244
It's falling to pieces.
It's not even safe any more.

155
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,666
You don't understand.

156
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,420
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.
Come on, boy.

157
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,759
Come on, boy. Come on. Come on.

158
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,428
At least think about it, will you?
Think about it, yeah?

159
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,847
So much for the legend
of Jimmy Gralton.

160
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,976
You better change the name of the hall.

161
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,270
James Connolly
will be turning in his grave.

162
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,116
Right. Come on, up.

163
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,870
So, how long have you been
working at this?

164
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,580
Oh, for the past few months,

165
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,417
whenever the lads get a bit of free time,
in the evenings, at the weekends.

166
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:51,004
We're planning on opening in 2
or 3 weeks, and we're on schedule.

167
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,215
Ah, Dessie, for Jesus' sake!
Hello?

168
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,926
- Can I have one of these?
- Dessie! Come on!

169
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,346
I'm after milking 6 cows this morning.
I'm starved of the hunger.

170
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,015
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
give me patience!

171
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:06,186
Look at him with the sandwich
in his mouth.

172
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,730
Up we go. How's that?

173
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,608
- Jesus!
- Shite!

174
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,652
Shite!

175
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:18,073
The Tans burnt the church hall down
in Gowell about a year ago,

176
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,076
- so we decided to build our own.
- With, er, what money?

177
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,412
I had some savings from the States,
and a few friends, too.

178
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,999
So, if it's your money and your land,
does that mean that it's your hall?

179
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,795
No. It's built by the voluntary labour
of the community,

180
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,755
and it's run by an elected committee.

181
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,175
I'll teach art, and Molly and Oonagh
will teach the music.

182
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:42,430
And Mossie the boxing,
gymnastics, woodwork. Literature.

183
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,517
And every penny'll go back into the hall
to buy materials.

184
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,394
Musical instruments, books...

185
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,397
And we'll have the best damned dances
in the whole country.

186
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:54,442
I just spoke to your parish priest.
Not best pleased.

187
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,279
Even said that all the horses
that dragged the sand here

188
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,030
will die within a year.

189
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,866
Is he a priest or a witch doctor?

190
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,452
Our opposition is still the same,
the masters and the pastors.

191
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,595
Come in, Father.
You're welcome.

192
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,555
Gralton, you come out.

193
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,099
It's Mr Gralton to you,
Sheridan.

194
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,935
Who in the hell do you think you are,

195
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,520
running classes in my parish
without my permission?

196
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:16,316
No permission required.
That's the point, we built it ourselves.

197
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,987
Education is the exclusive reserve
of Holy Mother Church,

198
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,530
not semi-illiterates.

199
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,825
- Don't patronise me.
- No, Jimmy, don't...

200
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,330
I will not have
a communist on my turf defy the Church.

201
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,832
Now, days of tugging the forelock
are gone.

202
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,753
Oh, bare arms.

203
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,380
Hardly becomes you.

204
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,633
Does your father know you're here,
Oonagh Dempsey?

205
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,428
If you'd like to enrol in our dance class,
Father, you're more than welcome.

206
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,515
It doesn't cost a penny,
and we're all volunteers.

207
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,316
I'm here to represent
my neighbour, Rory McManus,

208
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,026
who is the rightful tenant.

209
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,196
That land has been in their family
for over 30 years,

210
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,324
but, due to ill health,
he fell behind on the rent.

211
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,077
That landlord wouldn't give him
the time to catch up,

212
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,246
and he threw him off his land.

213
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,082
My name is Seamus Clarke.
I am the new tenant.

214
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,127
I rented this land in good faith
and for a fair price from the landlord.

215
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,628
Shame on you, Clarke.

216
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:21,631
You've had your beady eye
on that land next door for years.

217
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:23,717
Silence in the court.

218
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,386
This court has reached a unanimous decision.

219
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:31,975
The tenant, Rory McManus, is entitled
to the recovery of the land in dispute.

220
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,937
And the cattle
belonging to Seamus Clarke

221
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,647
will be removed immediately.

222
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:47,240
Jimmy. Jimmy.

223
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,576
It's O'Keefe.
He's up there with his army.

224
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,246
Doherty's there with his thugs, too.
And the priest is just after arriving.

225
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,167
- You're not gonna get by.
- Good work, son. Good man.

226
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,835
- The Holy Trinity.
- Bastards.

227
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,337
Take it easy.
It's not the Tans we're fighting now.

228
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,464
It's feckin' worse.

229
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,801
Open up, Clarke.
Here's your cattle back.

230
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,928
Keep them off your neighbour's land.

231
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,014
Gralton,
you pay attention to me.

232
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,350
You sow nothing but conflict
in a peaceful community.

233
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,978
Go and join the commies in Siberia.
Leave us alone.

234
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,605
You join the British.

235
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,775
I'll tell you whose land it is.
Where's Rory? Come here, Rory.

236
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,360
McManus, you took advantage
of a tenant in trouble.

237
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:28,865
This is a statement from
the acting OC of the IRA in this area.

238
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,242
Now, listen up
if you know what's good for you.

239
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,119
We fought the British too, Doherty.

240
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,455
Look at him
having to read for Doherty.

241
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,791
Let him have his word. Read away.

242
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:41,419
"Whereas certain evilly
disposed and unauthorised persons

243
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:44,714
"in certain districts
within the area of South Leitrim

244
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,051
"have commandeered and taken
forcible possession of lands

245
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,804
"to which they are not entitled..."

246
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:55,141
- Yeah, back in 1690.
- Silence, silence, silence!

247
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:59,145
"We do hereby order
that anyone found commandeering

248
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,690
"or interfering with lands
to which such a person has no claim

249
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,776
"shall be severely dealt with."

250
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,694
Are you threatening us?

251
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,864
We intend to implement
the decision of the Republican court.

252
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,700
- Yes!
- Now stand aside!

253
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,912
Any man goes through that gate
gets a bullet in the head.

254
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,749
- Put those guns away!
- You'll be the first to hit the ground.

255
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,502
Put those guns down immediately!

256
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,255
Put it down! Put them down!

257
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:28,299
I don't want any innocent blood spilt.

258
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:31,803
Bide your time.
There's a time and a place.

259
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,764
Do as I say now. Now!

260
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:42,021
- Open that gate.
- Sean. Mossie.

261
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,445
Put your guns away.

262
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,823
- Guns away?
- Yes.

263
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,325
- Bring the cows in.
- Bring them through.

264
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,287
Stand aside. Stand aside.
Go on, stand over.

265
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,248
Stand aside.

266
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,209
Dessie. Dessie, usher them in.

267
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:05,753
Stand by them, stand by them.

268
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,052
Let them through.

269
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:25,064
Siuil, siuil, siuil a ruin

270
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:32,197
Siuil go socair agus siuil go ciuin

271
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:37,994
Siuil go doras agus ealaigh lium

272
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:46,085
Is go dte tu mo mhuirnin slan

273
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:51,883
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain

274
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:56,930
I wish I had my heart again

275
00:25:57,014 --> 00:26:03,353
And vainly think I'd not complain

276
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:11,277
Is go dte tu mo mhuirnin slan

277
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:17,367
Siuil, siuil, siuil a ruin

278
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:22,163
Siuil go socair agus siuil go ciuin

279
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,498
Siuil go...

280
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,959
I want Gralton!

281
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,670
- He's under arrest!
- What for?

282
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:32,382
There'll be no more anarchy in Leitrim.
No more of your kangaroo courts.

283
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,092
Show us the warrant!

284
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,471
You've got to get out! Get out!

285
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,267
Go! Go!

286
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,236
Get out! Get out!

287
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,030
Get out of here!

288
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,324
Get away with you!

289
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:23,975
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll head to the States.

290
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:31,274
Oh, that looks a sore one. I'm sorry.

291
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,775
It's nothing.

292
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,446
It was worth it to see the expression
on his face, the bastard.

293
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,783
Will you say goodbye to Mam for me?
They're watching the farm.

294
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,454
How long are you gone for, Jimmy?

295
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,998
Till things calm down.

296
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,168
There's a few pistol boys
keen to make a name for themselves.

297
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:54,589
I've a few good comrades over
in New York who'll help me find work.

298
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,218
Mossie's waiting for me.

299
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,264
What if I asked you
to come with me, Oonagh?

300
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,644
What if my mother wasn't fading?

301
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:11,481
What if I wasn't the only daughter?
What if my dad wouldn't fall apart?

302
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,692
What if I wasn't so trapped, Jimmy?

303
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,278
What if, Oonagh?

304
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,532
And follow you around?

305
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,369
From one battle to the next?
Can I take that?

306
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,958
Are these the only clothes you have?

307
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,796
I hear they sell clothes in New York.

308
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,798
I suppose so.

309
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,676
Jimmy...

310
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:49,602
You'll be in my heart, girl.
No matter what.

311
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,354
Till the day I die.

312
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:31,310
Well, Jimmy...
I think you lost your bet.

313
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,855
Couldn't stay away.
Like a moth to a flame.

314
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,606
More like a dog to a post.

315
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,234
That feckin' gable's
never been right anyway.

316
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,570
- I wonder who built that, Tommy.
- Dessie did.

317
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,323
Are you ready for this again, Jimmy?

318
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:50,621
Jeez. Life's too short.

319
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,207
- We've no choice, do we?
- No.

320
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,751
- Come on, there's work to be done.
- Aye.

321
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,845
It's a beaut, eh?

322
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:22,528
Is that what you had in that trunk
that near broke my back, is it?

323
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:24,822
It'll be well worth it, Mossie.

324
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,618
- What the hell is it, Jimmy?
- His pet.

325
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:37,043
Looks grand, but I don't know
what we're gonna feed it on.

326
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:52,433
We'll have music
while we work now.

327
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,855
It's a beautiful sound, isn't it?

328
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,860
Nice, Jimmy.

329
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:06,155
Jimmy, did you ever go to
a jazz club when you were in Harlem?

330
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,493
I did, aye. The Savoy Ballroom.
Aye, grand musicians.

331
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,453
The only place in the United States

332
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,830
where black and white
dance together in peace.

333
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,415
- Really?
- Aye, marvellous.

334
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,626
Did you ever dance
with a black woman, Jimmy?

335
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:23,214
You know what the most
amazing thing about it was?

336
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,175
They've two legs like everyone else.

337
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:30,096
- Go on there, Jimmy. Show us a few steps.
- Go on!

338
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,514
Honestly...

339
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,433
- Please, go on.
- Please, Jimmy, come on.

340
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:37,103
All right, all right, all right!

341
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,938
All right.

342
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,776
- If I can only remember them.
- Ah, go on, Jimmy, son.

343
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,030
Go on, Jimmy.

344
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:00,334
I've a chicken at home
that can do exactly the same dance.

345
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,686
Come on.

346
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:27,069
Stop leading, Oonagh.

347
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:45,755
Now, come on. Shim-sham time!

348
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,174
And shim-sham.

349
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,386
Right foot first.

350
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,223
And right again.
All right! Same again.

351
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,187
Left foot again. Good.

352
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:06,025
Oh, show us the beginning.
Show us the beginning. That's very hard.

353
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,904
Let's go back to the start.
Right foot first.

354
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,238
And right.

355
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,783
And a right again.

356
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,286
Left foot now. All right.

357
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,288
Right again.

358
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,549
Good work!

359
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,018
"I went out to the Hazel Wood,

360
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,396
"Because a fire was in my head.

361
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,524
"And cut and peeled a hazel wand,

362
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,567
"And hooked a berry to a thread.

363
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,947
"And when white moths
were on the wing,

364
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,700
"And moth-like stars
were flickering out,

365
00:33:56,576 --> 00:34:00,579
"I dropped the berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout.

366
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:07,378
"When I had laid it on the floor,
I went to blow the fire a-flame.

367
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,507
"But something rustled on the floor
And someone called me by my name.

368
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:15,594
"It had become a glimmering girl,

369
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,391
"With apple blossom in her hair
Who called me by my name and ran,

370
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,144
"And faded through the brightening air.

371
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:26,480
"Though I am old with wandering,

372
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,941
"Through hollow lands and hilly lands,

373
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,652
"I will find out where she has gone

374
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:34,739
"And kiss her lips and take her hands,

375
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,283
"And walk among long dappled grass,

376
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,745
"And pluck till time and times are done,

377
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:46,542
"The silver apples of the moon,
The golden apples of the sun."

378
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,502
- Beautiful, Roisin.
- That was beautiful.

379
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,629
- It was beautiful, darling.
- Thank you.

380
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,548
You made it sound so real.

381
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,260
Next week, we'll talk about
what influenced Yeats.

382
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,637
Irish folklore, Greek myth,

383
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:04,018
and even Maud Gonne's
continuous refusal of him. Erm...

384
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:08,689
But for now, let's just talk about how
it felt as the words swept over you.

385
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,692
Ah, but sure, you know,
does all that longing,

386
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:15,154
does it break your heart
or does it fill you up with hope?

387
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,532
You know, the way she's always,
er, just out of reach,

388
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,452
or changing shape or whatever, you know.

389
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,913
But I suppose, er, in fairness to him,

390
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,123
he tried till his dying breath
to find her.

391
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,557
Here we are, how are you getting on?

392
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,644
I was just
trying to get the overall shape here...

393
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:50,147
Loosen everything up and just
see what happens, but great work.

394
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:51,565
That's lovely.

395
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,154
- How are you getting on, Ruari?
- Good, yeah.

396
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,280
Great, I'd say...

397
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,825
One, two. Cross. Cross, go on.

398
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,410
Keep that head
beneath the chin. Good man.

399
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,412
Keep that guard up.

400
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,874
Jab. Cross now, cross.
And guard up.

401
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:12,044
Alright, Shane, Shane,
take a wee break there now.

402
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,755
- Good man.
- Go on then, tiger.

403
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,924
One, two. One, two.

404
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,135
Don't forget your guard. Good man.

405
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,305
- That was below the belt, was it?
- Come on, jab.

406
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,225
- Come on, wake up. One, two.
- Good man.

407
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,186
That's the one that's gonna
give him a pain in the belly.

408
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,856
Hold on. Hold on, hold on.
You're all over the place here now.

409
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,817
Come on. Straight shots, right?

410
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,944
Stand back a little bit.
Go on, now.

411
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,071
- Go on, good man.
- Is that the best you got?

412
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,575
- Straight, straight.
- Come on! I can't feel it.

413
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,494
- Ow! Jesus!
- Well, that's what you get...

414
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,705
Feckin' gobshite!

415
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:52,376
"The Pearse-Connolly
Hall opens again."

416
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,212
I see they've a dance
this weekend.

417
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:56,922
Maybe we should pop along, huh?

418
00:36:57,007 --> 00:37:00,509
Hmm. Advertised in
a communist newspaper. Look at that.

419
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:04,388
"Classes of every sort."
Defiance, that's what that is.

420
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:09,435
Well, with respect,
it's probably best to just ignore it.

421
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,771
Repression breeds belligerence,
isn't that what they say?

422
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,445
Yeah, "From each according to his ability,
to each according to his need."

423
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:22,156
The Communist Manifesto.

424
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,076
Quasi religious. It's like
"Love thy neighbour as thyself."

425
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,453
The language of brotherhood.

426
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:30,539
It spreads like wildfire
in a world of rampant greed.

427
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:33,876
Do you realise how attractive that is
in the slums?

428
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,755
To the poor, to the unemployed?
The landless?

429
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,633
This Depression has destroyed lives
around the world.

430
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,217
Misery breeds desperation,

431
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:45,220
and it only takes a handful of
communists to set the fuse...

432
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:46,639
Don't get carried away now.

433
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:49,683
There can only be 150 or 200 communists
in the entire country.

434
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,645
One man, one book,
changed the world. Karl Marx.

435
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:55,439
Jimmy Gralton isn't Karl Marx.
He's just a worker, now.

436
00:37:55,523 --> 00:38:00,486
Listen, his mother ran a mobile library.
Never patronise the self-taught man,

437
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,072
especially someone
who worked down the mines.

438
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:06,492
He's a maverick, all right,
but he's a lightweight maverick, so...

439
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,411
Fire in his soul
and a plan in his head.

440
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:12,873
You can't buy him off. No.

441
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,668
He's not greedy, he's not selfish.

442
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:20,673
You know...
They remind me of the first martyrs.

443
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:25,344
D'you ever read about those union
organisers in the States? The Wobblies.

444
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,721
Entering towns and factories.

445
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:32,101
Thrown into prisons, lynched, murdered.

446
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,061
If every priest had their grit...

447
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,064
Well, there's nothing
as dramatic as that here.

448
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,484
It's just a tiny little hall,
in a country bog.

449
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,612
- Yeah, with a gramophone.
- With a gramophone.

450
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:45,572
First it's the dancing, then the books.

451
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,282
He'll start at the bottom
with their feet

452
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,202
and work up to their brains,
if they have any.

453
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,622
That bloody book. Das Kapital.

454
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,626
I'm going to get one, too.

455
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,378
Going to get the book, are you?

456
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,089
A feckin' gramophone,
you bloody eejit.

457
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,759
Is there any marmalade in this house?

458
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,512
There is. Especially for you.

459
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,556
- Thank you.
- Go easy, go easy.

460
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,566
See you in a little while.

461
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,657
Jimmy!

462
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,800
- Hi!
- Hello.

463
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,594
This is Colm and Clodagh.

464
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,055
Colm, young man. Lovely to meet you.

465
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,891
This is Jimmy who brought you
the presents from America.

466
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,476
Lovely to meet you.

467
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,188
Jimmy. Time flies.
Some things haven't changed.

468
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:02,524
- You're looking well, Fintan.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

469
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,485
Now, will you two, will you dance?

470
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,695
A little. Maybe a little.

471
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,782
- Just a little bit?
- And thanks for the presents.

472
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,825
- Oh, did you like it?
- Yep.

473
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:15,579
Lovely. And you played with them?
That's the main thing.

474
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,207
- We know these two men.
- Who are these two?

475
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,126
Yeah,
that's Michael Fitzpatrick there.

476
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,545
Er, Fiona Gallagher.

477
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,339
- There's Fiona.
- Yes, I know you.

478
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,383
- Amy Gilligan.
- Amy Gilligan, right. Just a moment.

479
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,350
- Where have you come from?
- Up the road, Father.

480
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,852
- Up the road where?
- Up the road and round the bend.

481
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:42,648
- What bend would that be, young man?
- It's a fierce bendy road, Father.

482
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:46,110
- What bend was it, lads?
- Up at O'Hara's white horse.

483
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:49,029
Marie O'Keefe, what are you doing here?

484
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,115
I came here to dance, Father.

485
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,201
Is the proper parish dance
not good enough for you, huh?

486
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,702
Yes, Father.

487
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,664
Does your father know
you're in a car with outsiders? Huh?

488
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:03,293
Put her name down. Marie O'Keefe,
And what's that driver's name?

489
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,005
Think we're doing more harm than good.

490
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,592
- Look at the wee child.
- This poor child, will you look at her?

491
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:15,180
That child should be home in bed.
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

492
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,057
And who is this behind them?

493
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:20,519
- Who's that, the fella smoking?
- That's Brian McMahon.

494
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,437
And Tommy Doyle.

495
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:57,277
What is this craze for pleasure?

496
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:03,200
This fascination with the materialist?

497
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:05,535
The pagan, the Anglo Saxon?

498
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:11,458
And most recently,
the Los Angelisation of our culture?

499
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:15,504
What is wrong
with being true to ourselves,

500
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,756
to our deepest roots,

501
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,426
to our own true Irish values?

502
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:27,933
Did not Cromwell himself
try to burn all the harps in the land,

503
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:32,896
murder our priests, exile our musicians?

504
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:38,068
They tried to crush our language,
our song, our dance,

505
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:43,323
but our forefathers resisted them
in their hedge schools,

506
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,742
risking their very lives.

507
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:50,080
Oh, how they must turn in their graves

508
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:56,962
to see our youths debase themselves
in Jimmy Gralton's hall.

509
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,799
Jazz music.

510
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:49,723
Rhythms from darkest Africa
that inflame the passions.

511
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,768
Pelvic thrusts
and salacious body grappling,

512
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:58,398
instead of the elegance and beauty
of our own Irish dances.

513
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:04,196
And then, of course, we have company
keeping under the stars at night.

514
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,782
Joy-riding until dawn...

515
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:14,748
with unsuitables on the prowl
from distant parts in their motor cars.

516
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,960
Occasions of sin
multiplied beyond our imagination.

517
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:25,675
But there is something even more evil
hatching in that hall.

518
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:31,806
Gralton and his crew... are communists.

519
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,768
They are atheists.

520
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:40,190
They deny the existence of God,
the Trinity

521
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,067
and the Virgin birth.

522
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:47,447
So, our community faces a choice.

523
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:52,827
Is it Christ... or is it Gralton?

524
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,260
Now, the Church
has a right, and even a duty,

525
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:09,970
to protect the vulnerable.

526
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:15,016
So what I do now,
I do in the spirit of God's love.

527
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:19,312
I will now read out
the names of those people

528
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:23,733
who attended Gralton's Hall last night.

529
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:29,197
And other priests in other parishes
will be doing the same.

530
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,326
And here are the names.

531
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,373
Amy Gilligan.

532
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,586
Deirdre Kearns.

533
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,714
Johnog Conlon.

534
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:48,675
Mrs. Oonagh Mulvey.

535
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,678
Niamh Kearns.

536
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,180
Emma Duggan.

537
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:56,683
Mrs. Teresa Hanrahan.

538
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,394
Margaret Carty.

539
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,314
David O'Reilly.

540
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,193
Paul O'Brian.

541
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:11,031
Marie O'Keefe,
joy-riding with unsuitables.

542
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:15,577
Kieran Brennan.

543
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:21,833
Eoghan O'Neill.

544
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,752
Sarah Conlon.

545
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,879
Rory O'Dowd.

546
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,881
Eoin O'Neill.

547
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,843
Christian Pindar.

548
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,515
Darragh O'Malley.

549
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:50,111
- Get the girls inside.
- Calm down.

550
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,696
Take the girls inside.

551
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:55,158
Get out, you.

552
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,329
- Mrs. Don't you hurt her.
- Take them inside.

553
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:04,417
Smirking at the priest.
Humiliating the family name. Come on.

554
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:07,045
- Mrs. Don't you hurt her.
- Take them inside!

555
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:10,924
Get in there.

556
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,258
Take off your jacket.

557
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,103
Take off your jacket.

558
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:26,272
Take off your jacket!

559
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:30,485
Stay away from Gralton's Hall!
You hear me?

560
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,529
Do you hear me?

561
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:34,614
Stay away from Gralton's Hall!

562
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:36,574
Stay away from it! Hear?

563
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:38,451
You want some more? Do ya?

564
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:41,287
Do you want some more? Do ya?

565
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:44,040
Promise me! Stay away from it!

566
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:48,169
Promise me that! Stay away from it!

567
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,050
Do you want some more? Do ya?

568
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,225
You had time to think
long and hard in prison, Mossie.

569
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:05,687
You don't want to end up
on the wrong side of history again, no?

570
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,441
An embittered old man
with not a penny to your name.

571
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:11,025
You've so much to live for.

572
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:14,070
You've got a lovely spouse.
Isn't that right, Angela?

573
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:18,158
And I could get you
a job for life in the Council.

574
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:24,164
Watch your children
grow up in security. Educated.

575
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,709
You're at a crossroads, Mossie.

576
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:35,884
Listen to me. You could even get
little Katie back from Scotland. Hmm?

577
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,600
- Would you like a scone, Father?
- Thank you. Thank you, Angela.

578
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:47,312
Here's a picture of our little Katie.

579
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,397
Oh, isn't she a dote?

580
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:52,817
- Beautiful little girl.
- Just like her mammy.

581
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:55,445
- Thank you, Father.
- You must miss her terribly.

582
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,155
Very, very much.

583
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:02,952
Oh, we have the Redemptorist Fathers
coming to the parish for a mission.

584
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:06,247
What if I was to bring around
a doctor of divinity into your house,

585
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:09,083
to explain to you where Gralton
is leading you astray?

586
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:13,797
What if I was to bring a doctor of
economics round to your house, Father,

587
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:16,800
and explain to you
where you're going astray?

588
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,552
Loyalty is a noble thing,

589
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:24,349
but misplaced loyalty,
for a man with children, is a tragedy.

590
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,560
1, 2, 3, 4,

591
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,521
5, 6, 7, 8.

592
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:33,525
1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8.

593
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:40,990
1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8.

594
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:44,244
1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7.

595
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,579
Shim, sham.

596
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:49,624
Hop over, and shim, sham.

597
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:53,419
And hop over and shim, sham.

598
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:57,757
And hop over and... hop over and...

599
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:01,678
Hop stop. And one, two, three...

600
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:03,763
Marie!

601
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:08,393
I'm sorry I'm late. I...
I couldn't get on my bike.

602
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,353
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry.

603
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,313
- It's OK.
- Marie, what's the matter?

604
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:16,025
- I couldn't get on my bike.
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

605
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,778
I didn't want to miss the class.

606
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:20,905
- Marie...
- There's no worries.

607
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:23,908
Jimmy, get her a chair.
Marie, what happened to your back?

608
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:26,244
Come on, have a seat.

609
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:29,289
What's the matter?

610
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:35,128
"Lay the lash upon their backs."
That's what the Bishop of Galway said.

611
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,508
They make the blood boil,
these hooligans with a cross in their hand.

612
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:44,804
Closing in like hounds. There's talks
of bringing in the Redemptorists

613
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:47,390
to preach fire and thunder for a week.

614
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,268
Father Sheridan
came to the shop.

615
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:55,481
He said...
he said he'd organise a boycott.

616
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,567
- What?
- It's your livelihood.

617
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,528
- He could ruin us.
- What did Brendan say?

618
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:05,491
He doesn't want me coming here anymore.

619
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:12,707
I'm so sorry,
but I can't teach the classes any more.

620
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,378
I'm sorry.

621
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:20,256
He's after being in the houses
of most of the lads we know.

622
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:22,175
It's starting to happen
in other parishes.

623
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,135
They're all doing the same thing.

624
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:26,346
Father Sheridan
came up to see my father,

625
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,389
with the Knights of Saint Columbanus.

626
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:31,100
They were scheming away.

627
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:33,937
And they'll have your da
and the fascists on one side,

628
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:36,731
and the bloody Dohertys
of this world on the other.

629
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:39,567
At a safe, deniable distance, you know.

630
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:45,406
At each other's throats, but only united
by a mutual hatred of us.

631
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:48,993
We've still got lots of support
out there.

632
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:50,870
People are stopping me all the time.

633
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:55,083
And, listen, half those lads in
Fianna Fail, they think he's a fanatic.

634
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,418
Spit licks who will genuflect
when the time comes.

635
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:01,005
They're good lads, Sean.
And some of 'em were at the dance here.

636
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,966
My old brigade, most of them.

637
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,343
And the unemployed movement,
they're with us.

638
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:07,929
Lots of the parents,
they're still solid...

639
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:12,350
For how long, Tommy?
He called us antichrists!

640
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,311
Look, we need to see it
from his point of view. Right?

641
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:18,564
We're in his parish,
so he must confront us.

642
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:22,193
And his fellow priests, bishops
and the entire Catholic community

643
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,988
are all watching him,
so there's pressure on him too.

644
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,823
So we have to get him off our backs,

645
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,450
without him losing face
before his supporters.

646
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:36,207
What if... What if we ask the Reverend
Father to be on our board of trustees?

647
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,333
Jesus.

648
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:41,379
We can't be antichrists then.
We've always said everyone's welcome.

649
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,549
If it continues like this, you know,
we'll have an empty hall.

650
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:49,262
I feel for the lads. There's nothing
for them after all this work.

651
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:53,891
I'm becoming fed up of
being a pragmatist in church, you know.

652
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:57,395
Here's this young girl beside me,
she's been beaten because of them,

653
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,147
and she shows up here the next day.

654
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,274
We have to be very careful.

655
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:05,695
Those people don't just join.
They come to take over.

656
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,509
Holy Moses.

657
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,887
- No, it's only me.
- What do you want?

658
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:35,183
I've come to get me devil's horns
put on. Is Father Sheridan in?

659
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:36,809
He is. Come in.

660
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:43,816
Well, I'll be damned.

661
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:46,944
Don't lose hope, Father.
There's still time to repent.

662
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:51,574
Oh, is that so? Well, as you're here,
you might as well come in.

663
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:04,420
We want to invite you to join
our board of trustees who run the hall.

664
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:09,217
I'm hopeful that once you come along and
see what we're doing with your own eyes,

665
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:11,177
we can put all this behind us.

666
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:16,015
So, I am to be the odd man out
among your, er, hand-picked comrades.

667
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:19,102
And no doubt when it comes
to choosing reading material,

668
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:22,021
- there'll be... There'll be a vote?
- Can you not at least...

669
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:24,065
No, it's a gracious offering,
Mr. Gralton.

670
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,900
At a time when a quarter of the country

671
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,611
is planning to travel to Dublin
for the Eucharistic Congress,

672
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:32,990
and the other 75 percent will be
tuning into the radio from Athlone,

673
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:38,162
a country supremely united
in faith, in love and respect,

674
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:40,915
for Christ's representative on earth.

675
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,668
Have a look at that painting.

676
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:50,341
Democratic Irish State,
true to its traditions.

677
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,509
In harmony with its people

678
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:56,806
and under the guidance of
the one true universal Apostolic Church.

679
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:02,019
That is the natural way. Now, sit down.

680
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:08,693
You know my family are believers.
My sister is a nun.

681
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:13,030
I said the rosary in solidarity with
fighters during the War of Independence.

682
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:16,242
"Love thy neighbour"
is revered in my book too.

683
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,745
In our hall, we respect
freedom of religion and conscience.

684
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:23,499
Tell that to the Soviets who have
murdered Christians in their thousands.

685
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:26,502
And don't get me started
on Joseph Stalin's secret prisons,

686
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:28,588
and that famine that's on the horizon.

687
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:32,758
Don't get me started either, Father.
That is a long debate to be had.

688
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:36,596
But today, can we talk about the hall
and just listen to what we have to say?

689
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,765
I am not a politician.
No deals in dingy corners.

690
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:43,269
No half measures. No compromise.
There's no...

691
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,063
A question, please, Reverend Father.

692
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:49,901
When was the last time
you really listened to someone else?

693
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,780
Actually,
it was last night at confessions.

694
00:58:55,282 --> 00:59:00,036
I listen to the innermost secrets
and fears of our community.

695
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:05,041
People open their hearts to me.
Not the man, but the priest,

696
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:09,712
in a way unknown to your... imagination.

697
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,798
Look at these hands, Father.

698
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:15,009
Dirt under the fingernails.

699
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,886
I'm no scholar.

700
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:20,640
I've been a soldier, a sailor,
a docker, a miner,

701
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,975
on the seas and underground.

702
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,395
I've seen much and made many a mistake,

703
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,774
but despite all our flaws,

704
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:33,945
I believe in my neighbour,
my fellow man, my class.

705
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:38,115
Meeting up and struggling
to understand our lives as best we can.

706
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,370
On our own, in isolation, we perish.

707
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,789
The hall is a safe space

708
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:50,419
where we can think, talk,
learn, listen and laugh and dance.

709
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:51,879
It's a good place.

710
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:55,007
If I were a believer like you,
I'd call it a holy place.

711
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,510
It brings out the best in us.

712
00:59:58,387 --> 01:00:01,472
Don't be frightened.
Come along, meet us.

713
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:04,684
Talk to us, question us,
but work with us.

714
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:07,311
There is enough misery
in the world already.

715
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,065
Oh, you are a believer, Jimmy.

716
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,192
Yes, you are.

717
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:17,571
And part of me holds you
in very high esteem.

718
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:21,909
So, yes, I will come along
and listen to you and your trustees,

719
01:00:21,994 --> 01:00:25,663
once you have brought me
the title deeds to the hall,

720
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:29,458
and have them transferred over
to Holy Mother Church.

721
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:39,510
I take it back, Father. You do listen,
but only when we're on our knees.

722
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:56,652
A flight of Free State aeroplanes
flying in the form of a cross

723
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,571
escorted the special boat.

724
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:04,618
And then Cardinal Lauri stepped ashore,

725
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:09,623
the first Papal Legate to land
in Ireland for over two centuries.

726
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:13,586
Accompanied by Mr. de Valera
and his ministers...

727
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,672
he inspected the Guard of Honour,

728
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:20,676
followed by his retinue of
Vatican officials in Elizabethan dress.

729
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,304
The streets along the route

730
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:27,600
had been thronged for hours
before the Papal Legate was due,

731
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,436
and he received a tumultuous reception.

732
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:15,064
Sweeney...

733
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,484
There's Gralton!

734
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,821
Mossie Maguire. Tommy Gilroy. You rats!

735
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:24,198
Move on, you fascists.

736
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:27,410
- You shouldn't be here.
- Sweeney, get out and let us watch...

737
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,286
I said get out and let us watch the film.

738
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:32,498
- Antichrist!
- Atherton.

739
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:39,463
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword

740
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:42,049
Sing, boys!

741
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,052
Don't encourage them.
Watch the film, ignore 'em.

742
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:49,515
Get out, Sweeney. We've watched
your propaganda, now go home.

743
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,726
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!

744
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:56,897
- We will be true to thee till death
- Thank you.

745
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,650
We will be true to thee till death

746
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,318
Yeah, go on. Go on home.

747
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:04,530
Get back to your Yankee friends,
you Red bastards!

748
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,752
Whoa there, Dixie. Whoa, whoa.

749
01:03:18,879 --> 01:03:20,754
- Good man, Mossie.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

750
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:24,550
Mossie, I've left my bike at the hall,
so I'll make my own way home.

751
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:28,804
Youse mind yourselves, then.
They'll be looking for us.

752
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:31,223
The witch hunt has started.
You two, be careful.

753
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,893
Likewise. Good luck.
Look after yourselves.

754
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:37,354
Get on, Dixie.

755
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:50,242
Lock the door.

756
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:06,425
- Keep your back turned.
- What?

757
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:30,950
- I hope you're not looking.
- I wouldn't dare.

758
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,970
You can look now.

759
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,648
Fits perfectly.

760
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,154
Why wouldn't it?

761
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:48,063
You take my breath away.

762
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:53,736
I think my heart
is going to break.

763
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:28,228
Firstly,
I just wanted to thank you all

764
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:31,940
for agreeing to meet with us today.
It's about a fella called Milmoe.

765
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:37,070
Molly, that's the wife, there outside.
Erm, he's in a dire situation.

766
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,699
He's looking for the Roscommon IRA
to help him.

767
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:44,745
He's been forcibly evicted out of
his cottage on the Kingston estate.

768
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:48,874
We had an angry meeting last night,
a big split.

769
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,919
A third of us want to
reinstate him by force.

770
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:56,548
A third want nothing to do with it.
And there's a third sitting on the fence.

771
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:59,301
And he has
the best of connections.

772
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:02,054
He has the guards. He has the army.

773
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,556
He has the ranchers and the politicians.

774
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:08,143
Not just the local ones,
but the bigwigs.

775
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,146
There's some tough boys on this estate.

776
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:13,857
His agent's a vicious bastard.
A bad egg.

777
01:09:13,942 --> 01:09:16,610
That's a feckin' handful, all right.
Bejaysus, yeah.

778
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:19,696
 But there's 5 children
out there on the side of the road,

779
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:22,157
and a woman outside this hall
bawling her eyes out,

780
01:09:22,242 --> 01:09:24,451
unless any of you want to
go out and see her.

781
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:28,872
Now... things aren't too great
with ourselves.

782
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:31,375
We're not as strong
as what we used to be.

783
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:33,585
Truth be told, there's very few of us.

784
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:36,588
Even our OC doesn't even know
we're here today.

785
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:39,216
But you know what we know,
what's going on out there.

786
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,677
There's a queer fear out there
amongst the people,

787
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:44,137
and something's going to have
to be done about it.

788
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,641
So, what do you want from us?

789
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:49,852
We need your help
to reinstate them.

790
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:52,855
There'll be a big turnout
if we can spread the word

791
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:56,108
that Jimmy Gralton and his supporters
from Leitrim are coming.

792
01:09:56,192 --> 01:10:00,487
It isn't just about the reinstatement.
It's much more important than that.

793
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:03,198
It's about the message we send out there
to the wider community.

794
01:10:03,283 --> 01:10:06,535
Think about what could be done.
That's why it's important.

795
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,289
And that's why it's important, Jimmy,
that you speak to the crowd.

796
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:14,126
- Can someone else not speak?
- No, it has to be Jimmy.

797
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,879
He's got the words, he's got the spake.

798
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:19,840
He's got the confidence and trust
of the people out there,

799
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:22,342
and with all due respect
to the rest of you here,

800
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:25,137
you wouldn't pull a quarter of
the support of what Jimmy would.

801
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,139
It has to be Jimmy that speaks.

802
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:29,975
What do you think?

803
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:34,771
Well, I think that every journalist
from the local press will be there.

804
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:39,234
I think they'll note your words,
which will spread like wildfire,

805
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:43,280
and be seen as a direct challenge to
landed estates throughout the country.

806
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:45,324
That's why we must win this one.

807
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:48,035
Yeah, and why...
and why they need to.

808
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:49,786
You know what'll happen, Jimmy.

809
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:52,372
It's hard to judge, but...

810
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,374
they could come after you again, Jimmy.

811
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,085
No, there's no "could"
about it, Dessie.

812
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:59,546
They will. Of course they will.

813
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:02,174
And they'll close down the hall.
It's suicide.

814
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,927
Well, we don't know that
for certain, Mossie.

815
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:07,429
I mean, you know,
it's not the time for pessimism.

816
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:10,515
I-I'm not a pessimist.
I'm a realist.

817
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:13,435
I know the way these bastards are.

818
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:20,692
I'm on a, still, on a blacklist, Sean,
for 10 years. 10 feckin' years!

819
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:24,488
No, I know that
and, look, it's an opportunity.

820
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:27,157
Here are 5 children out on the street

821
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:31,703
from a lord who has thousands of acres
inherited from foreign invasion.

822
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:34,122
I mean, who has the right to the land?

823
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:36,917
We know who has the right to the land.
We know that.

824
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,670
Is it... Is it the rich man on his own,

825
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:42,339
or is it the families
that live and work that land?

826
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:46,802
What is the burning issue
up and down this country?

827
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:51,264
The breakup of large estates
to landless labourers.

828
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:52,766
- D'you know?
- I do.

829
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:55,018
I don't think we're gonna get
a better chance.

830
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:57,437
- And we shouldn't let it pass.
- That's right.

831
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:02,359
This is critical.
People are angry. They're desperate.

832
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:06,113
There's no money coming from family
in America because of the Depression.

833
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,823
We should strike now, James.

834
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:09,908
Think before we leap.

835
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:12,661
- We forget the bishops at our peril.
- Exactly.

836
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:15,706
They've never been stronger
after the Eucharistic Congress.

837
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:19,835
You saw the crowds in Dublin.
They've the Government in their pocket.

838
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:21,336
They'll go for the kill.

839
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:23,213
We have supporters.

840
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:27,384
There are thousands of landless
labourers outside these estates.

841
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:30,137
The rich are nervous. Fearful.

842
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,014
We have to keep pushing.

843
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:34,891
Ruari's right. And let me ask you this.

844
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:39,646
What is the feckin' point of this hall
if we do not support these people?

845
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:42,399
We built this hall
with our own hands.

846
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:46,987
We put our lives into it.
Heart and soul. Everything we had.

847
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:52,451
It's not just a building,
it's... it's what we are.

848
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:54,870
It's everything.
And we have to protect it.

849
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:58,123
Not just for ourselves,
but for the youngsters coming after.

850
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:02,085
And I know from bitter experience that
if you bite off more than you can chew,

851
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:03,545
you'll feckin' choke.

852
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,630
Exactly.

853
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:09,801
I'm sorry, lads, but that's my fear too.

854
01:13:10,178 --> 01:13:12,054
It's time for caution.

855
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:15,265
My heart goes out
to that woman in the cart.

856
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:17,559
They're too strong at the moment.

857
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:20,437
They're too wild.
We have to bide our time.

858
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:21,688
I agree.

859
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:25,150
I don't think Jimmy should talk.
He shouldn't speak this time.

860
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,861
For Christ's sake, though,
they're coming after us anyway.

861
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,363
I mean, there's no denying that.

862
01:13:31,491 --> 01:13:34,159
- I say we support this family.
- Stand together.

863
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,996
Oonagh. You've hardly said a word.

864
01:13:57,892 --> 01:13:59,810
- Mam.
- Hello, Jimmy.

865
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:13,824
Sacred Heart of Jesus, Jimmy, can you
thread this needle for me, please?

866
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:20,413
My eyesight is getting so bad,
and I need to mend your shirt.

867
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,509
- Here.
- Thank you.

868
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:35,720
If they drive me out again, Mam,
I want you to come with me.

869
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:40,058
I mean it, Mam.
I'll find a place for us both.

870
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:46,273
Maybe somewhere easier to manage.
Not so isolated.

871
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:52,737
Well?

872
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:56,950
What do you think?

873
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:03,748
You need a new pair of boots.

874
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,710
Your other ones are very worn.

875
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:10,088
I cleaned them last night.

876
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,469
Now, there's His Lordship, hmm?

877
01:15:57,595 --> 01:15:59,596
- He's shaking in his breeches.
- Yeah.

878
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,681
Fine day for it!

879
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,279
Come on!

880
01:16:16,364 --> 01:16:21,534
Come on then, lads.
Get in there and open the doors.

881
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:29,209
Get them all off. Quick as you can.

882
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:42,681
What's going on here?
This is private property!

883
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:44,766
Get off before we call the guards!

884
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:47,644
Shush your trap
and get you back to the big house!

885
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:49,312
This is my home, my family's home.

886
01:16:49,397 --> 01:16:52,691
I heard there was loads of room
up in Gralton Hall. Go up there for you.

887
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:54,818
No more evictions without just cause.

888
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:57,529
All these people are going to jail,
I promise you that!

889
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,906
Go back!

890
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:04,869
Down on your knees! Get on your knees!

891
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:13,920
If you... If you or your earl or anyone
lays a hand on this family,

892
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:16,339
you'll get what's coming to you.
Do you hear me?

893
01:17:16,424 --> 01:17:19,217
You're to leave these people in peace
in their own home!

894
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:22,178
- You won't get away with this.
- I will get away with it.

895
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:28,393
There's to be
no more evictions on this estate!

896
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:34,566
Come on, put the rest of the stuff
back into this house. Come on.

897
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,078
A chairde!

898
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:51,708
I want to introduce to you a man
whom all of us know,

899
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:54,919
whom all of us trust
and have confidence in.

900
01:17:55,755 --> 01:17:58,298
Jimmy Gralton, come up here
and say a few words.

901
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,884
Go on, Jimmy.

902
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:07,932
Friends, comrades.

903
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:14,314
Who could not appreciate
the magnificence of the mansion we passed?

904
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,400
Fertile land as far as the eye can see.

905
01:18:17,985 --> 01:18:21,446
And the simplicity of this cottage.

906
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:23,615
The Earl snaps his fingers,

907
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:26,743
and our brother and sister here
and their five children

908
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:28,453
are thrown onto the street.

909
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:34,167
This is the greatest lie
they try to stuff down our throats,

910
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:38,046
that Ireland is one,
that our nation is one,

911
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:40,090
and that we are all one people,

912
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:43,134
united in our beliefs
with one common interest.

913
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:48,098
But do you think the interests
of a child in the slum

914
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:50,850
are the same
as the rack-renting landlord?

915
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:55,230
Do you think the interests of a labourer
are the same as the Earl's?

916
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:56,481
No.

917
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:59,651
The interests of a miner
or a factory worker

918
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:04,114
the same as the owner's, his bankers',
his lawyers', his investors'

919
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:07,659
and the prostitute journalists'
hired to write their lies?

920
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:09,119
Some here today.

921
01:19:09,203 --> 01:19:13,289
Do you think they give a damn about our old,

922
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:16,668
the sick, the unemployed,
the hungry, the homeless,

923
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:20,505
and those forced to leave our shores
desperate for work?

924
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:24,968
I saw the '20s in New York,
with my own eyes,

925
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:29,514
and the wild speculation and greed
that infected everyone.

926
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:32,058
And then I saw the bubble burst.

927
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:36,646
The crash of '29
and misery in a land of plenty.

928
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:39,816
Let's not forget
how it spread round the world,

929
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:44,654
from a system steeped in illusion,
exploitation and avarice.

930
01:19:44,864 --> 01:19:50,577
They tried to pretend
that it was destiny or an act of God,

931
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:52,579
but it was all man-made.

932
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:58,418
We need to take control
of our lives again.

933
01:19:58,544 --> 01:20:01,588
Work for need, not for greed.

934
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:06,759
And not just to survive like a dog,
but to live and to celebrate.

935
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:07,886
Yes!

936
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:13,016
And to dance, to sing,
as free human beings.

937
01:20:16,187 --> 01:20:18,229
Now, on you go into your home.

938
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:16,913
Everybody down! Everybody down!

939
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:20,833
Everybody down! Get down!

940
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,544
- Stay down!
- Everybody down!

941
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:26,089
Stay down everyone.
Keep your heads down.

942
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:28,299
Everybody's fine.

943
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:30,218
Anyone hurt?

944
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:32,428
Stay where you are, stay where you are.

945
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,097
Keep your heads down!

946
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:38,726
Stay down,
stay down, stay down.

947
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:42,689
- Is everyone all right?
- Now you're gonna have to watch your back.

948
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,696
Now it's started, Jimmy.

949
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:52,824
Cowardly bastards.

950
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:58,329
Is that a truck driving off, you hear that?

951
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:04,210
I see no lights, but I'm sure that was a
truck driving off there. D'you hear it?

952
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:08,673
- I can't be sure.
- Bastards!

953
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:11,718
Cowards, huh?

954
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:15,179
The hall's full of women and children.

955
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:51,549
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

956
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:54,677
It is over 25 years
since my last confession.

957
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:57,930
I would like your advice
on what to do with the Pharisees who,

958
01:22:58,057 --> 01:23:00,975
from the safe distance of the pulpit,
have told lies,

959
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:04,354
incited hatred
and encouraged the rifle squad

960
01:23:04,438 --> 01:23:07,190
to attack and endanger
the lives of innocent people.

961
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:09,025
What are you talking about?

962
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:11,361
I would like your advice
on the sin of pride,

963
01:23:11,445 --> 01:23:14,113
on those who assume
they are the fount of all knowledge,

964
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:17,200
and yet do nothing but promote
ignorance and superstition.

965
01:23:17,284 --> 01:23:18,951
Do you want confession?

966
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:21,913
And those who try to destroy
what is best in us,

967
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:25,875
our imagination, our sense of fun,
by threats of damnation.

968
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:31,130
But worst of all, those who try to kill
our spirit by their miserable drabness,

969
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:35,551
who have such venom in their hearts
for everything they cannot control.

970
01:23:35,636 --> 01:23:38,012
Gralton, this is a sacrilege.

971
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:41,391
No, I'll tell you what the sacrilege is,
Reverend Father.

972
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:44,769
Having more hate in your heart
than love.

973
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:54,946
Goodnight, Mary.

974
01:23:56,115 --> 01:23:58,866
Can I ask you something, Father Seamus?

975
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:00,410
You can, of course.

976
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:03,746
Do you think Father Sheridan
is his usual self?

977
01:24:03,831 --> 01:24:07,792
It's Gralton.
He's obsessed with the man.

978
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:12,588
Oh, don't worry about it, Mary.
Goodnight.

979
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:14,006
Goodnight.

980
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:43,035
Come in.

981
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:45,621
Have a wee drop.

982
01:24:54,298 --> 01:24:55,631
There you are.

983
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:58,176
Slainte.

984
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:00,470
Slainte.

985
01:25:03,891 --> 01:25:06,058
What's wrong with that, huh?

986
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:12,899
You know,
that's the voice of a black woman.

987
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:14,400
Yeah.

988
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:17,403
Quite remarkable, huh?

989
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:23,242
Oh, Gralton came today.

990
01:25:24,203 --> 01:25:28,289
He had the nerve to leave these records
outside in the porch.

991
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:31,125
And he had the guts to face me
in the confessional.

992
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:33,878
D'you know what he said? Hmm?

993
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:40,384
He said, "You have more hate
in your heart than love."

994
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:44,180
What do you make of that?

995
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:48,786
Will it be you next, son?
I'm so worried for you.

996
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:29,827
Listen, what you've learned is in
your heads forever. They can't destroy that.

997
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:53,684
Thank you.

998
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:58,189
These are the tactics
of the Ku Klux Klan. No, thank you.

999
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:03,945
Cowardice, sneaking around
in the middle of the night.

1000
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:06,697
Strikes me they were keen
to avoid loss of life.

1001
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:08,157
Thank you.

1002
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:14,205
- Slainte.
- Slainte.

1003
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:15,998
To the business ahead.

1004
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:19,877
So, have they
found the culprits yet?

1005
01:28:20,003 --> 01:28:23,214
As you know, Father, Gralton
had quite a few enemies in the locality.

1006
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:25,049
He had a lot of friends, too,

1007
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:27,218
despite our best efforts.

1008
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:30,388
It's disgusting behaviour.
What are we gonna do next?

1009
01:28:30,514 --> 01:28:33,641
Are we gonna burn down the cottage
with the old woman inside?

1010
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:36,727
Make no mistake,
it's a disaster for the community.

1011
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:39,689
And we'll all be the losers
because of it.

1012
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:42,483
It would be a tragedy
if we turned him into a martyr.

1013
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:43,985
That would be a huge mistake.

1014
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:45,987
It'd be a tragedy for a decent man

1015
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:50,241
to get shot in the back
and lose his life, Mr O'Keefe!

1016
01:28:51,535 --> 01:28:53,411
"Is it Christ or Gralton?"

1017
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:56,414
I think those were the words of
several parish priests...

1018
01:28:56,498 --> 01:28:58,165
I suspect if Christ was here today,

1019
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,084
there'd be several members of this parish

1020
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:03,504
who would have Him crucified again.
That's what I suspect!

1021
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:07,925
Cut out the nonsense. I expect
he'll scamper away sooner or later.

1022
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:11,595
He's a bloody communist.
They don't scamper like you lot.

1023
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,433
They might make a tactical retreat,
but they'll fight till their last breath.

1024
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:19,270
Look what they're doing in Belfast.
This is incredible.

1025
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:23,190
Read that.
"The Falls and Shankill Unite."

1026
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:27,236
Stirring up fraternity between poor
Catholics and unemployed Protestants.

1027
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:31,282
I'm not clear.
Is that a good thing now or a bad thing?

1028
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:33,200
20,000 strikers.

1029
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,870
They even fought against police
issued with 800 rifles.

1030
01:29:35,954 --> 01:29:40,041
Two killed, Father, and 70 injured.
Over 100,000 on the streets.

1031
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:42,960
Protestants and Catholics
united at the funerals.

1032
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:47,715
Workers challenging the leaders of
their own trade unions as sell-outs.

1033
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:50,217
- That's the Reds for you.
- No, that's poverty!

1034
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:53,804
- Don't be so goddamn naive!
- Calm down, gentlemen.

1035
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:55,556
I apologise for raising my voice.

1036
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:59,560
Speaking of Belfast. Tom Mann.

1037
01:30:00,771 --> 01:30:03,147
And what's he got to do with us
and our problem?

1038
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:15,117
Mr. Gralton. You're under arrest.

1039
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:17,661
What for?

1040
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:21,499
I've an order here signed personally
by a member of Cabinet.

1041
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:25,920
You are to be deported from the country,
forthwith, as an illegal alien.

1042
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:28,672
Illegal alien?
Have you been drinking, officer?

1043
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:30,841
- Watch your mouth.
- An alien?

1044
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:32,009
Sorry, Mrs. Gralton.

1045
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:35,179
He was born in this house.
He's my son.

1046
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:37,515
He also holds an American passport,
Mrs. Gralton.

1047
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:39,016
Let me see that.

1048
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:42,353
This is terrible.

1049
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,438
- All the way from Dublin?
- It is.

1050
01:30:45,524 --> 01:30:47,274
Minister of Justice.

1051
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:51,695
What date is the hearing?

1052
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:55,449
There'll be no hearing for you,
Mr. Gralton. It's a deportation order.

1053
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:57,952
- He's not a criminal.
- Come on.

1054
01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:00,037
No, you can't take my son.

1055
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:03,040
I'm sorry, Mrs. Gralton,
we're under strict instructions.

1056
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:05,459
Sorry, we're under strict instructions
to take him in.

1057
01:31:05,544 --> 01:31:09,130
Well, let him change his jacket.
And let me say goodbye to my son.

1058
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:10,339
You have two minutes.

1059
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,645
Get up those stairs and watch that door.

1060
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:26,021
Yes, sir.

1061
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:31,861
I've made some tea.
You're welcome to a tea.

1062
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:34,196
Thanks, Mrs. Gralton.

1063
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:52,423
Mrs. Gralton, I remember
when I was a young fella,

1064
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:54,925
you used to bring books
round our school.

1065
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:58,429
- What school was that?
- Sacred Heart.

1066
01:31:58,555 --> 01:32:01,432
It was the best part of the month.
We all looked forward to that.

1067
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:03,934
Treasure Island, now, was my favourite.

1068
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:07,438
Robert Louis Stevenson.
It was always very popular.

1069
01:32:07,564 --> 01:32:10,024
I always liked
White Fang meself.

1070
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:17,114
What's going on, son?
What's going on here?

1071
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:24,288
We were told that the British deported
a fella in Belfast called Tom Mann,

1072
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:29,210
some English trade union activist
over to agitate,

1073
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:32,379
start a general strike
after those workers were shot.

1074
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:36,300
No trial? That's some "fair play".

1075
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:40,971
So somebody can be taken away
from their own home without a trial

1076
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:42,723
or being allowed to have a say?

1077
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:44,808
Mr. Gralton!

1078
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:48,312
Mr. Gralton. Are you ready yet?

1079
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:50,272
Get up there.

1080
01:32:51,107 --> 01:32:53,150
What's going on?

1081
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:55,653
- Door's jammed.
- Then break it down.

1082
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:57,905
It's stuck. He's got something...

1083
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:00,241
Put your back into it,
it's only a small door.

1084
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:05,746
He's gone
through the feckin' thatch!

1085
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,623
What do you mean he's gone?

1086
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:11,168
There he is!
He's off across the fields!

1087
01:33:11,253 --> 01:33:12,670
Jesus' sake!

1088
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:15,256
Shower of useless bastards!

1089
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:18,133
I'm gonna get youse all fired, I swear.

1090
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:22,429
Where's the key, Mrs Gralton?

1091
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:24,848
I don't know. Don't know where I put it.

1092
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:27,351
Oh, shite! Smash it through!

1093
01:33:29,688 --> 01:33:30,771
Feckin' door!

1094
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:33,274
- Please, Mrs Gralton.
- I don't know where I put it.

1095
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:36,110
- They'll have our guts for garters!
- I can't help that.

1096
01:33:36,194 --> 01:33:38,195
Come on!
Get yourself through.

1097
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:40,781
- What's going on here?
- Breathe in.

1098
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:43,200
- What's going on here?
- The feckin' door is locked!

1099
01:33:43,285 --> 01:33:45,202
- Where's the key?
- Down her drawers!

1100
01:33:45,287 --> 01:33:48,539
He's out the back,
he went through the roof.

1101
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:52,209
You get after him,
you gobshite! He's round the back!

1102
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:53,877
Get after him, would you?

1103
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:58,132
Get up, you eejit,
and get after him, for God's sake.

1104
01:33:58,216 --> 01:33:59,466
Will I pull you out, sir?

1105
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:02,886
What are you coming back to me for?
You should be going after him!

1106
01:34:20,739 --> 01:34:23,741
Sean Maguire! Come out, Sean Maguire!

1107
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:27,036
Get out of my fucking house!
What the hell are you doing?

1108
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:29,663
- Get out! Get out!
- Out you come.

1109
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:32,166
Jesus Christ! Bastards!

1110
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:36,045
- Where's Jimmy? Where's Jimmy Gralton?
- Get off me!

1111
01:34:36,171 --> 01:34:38,255
- Get off me!
- Put your hands up!

1112
01:34:38,381 --> 01:34:40,883
- God, you fuckers!
- Get the cuffs on him.

1113
01:34:41,885 --> 01:34:43,427
- House empty.
- Fuck.

1114
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:45,346
- Where's Jimmy, Sean?
- I don't fucking know!

1115
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:47,097
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

1116
01:34:47,223 --> 01:34:49,433
Get off me! You're hurting me!

1117
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:52,603
Get out! Stay away from my children!

1118
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:54,271
You stay away from my children!

1119
01:34:54,356 --> 01:34:56,023
Come out, Mossie!

1120
01:34:57,859 --> 01:34:59,526
- Get out!
- Where is he?

1121
01:34:59,611 --> 01:35:01,695
- Where's who?
- Where's Gralton?

1122
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:05,783
What's going on?
Leave him alone. Leave him alone!

1123
01:35:05,867 --> 01:35:08,786
He's away in Dublin
having a pint with de Valera!

1124
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,324
- Whoa.
- Ah, Tommy Gilroy.

1125
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:48,826
Whoa, Dixie. Whoa.

1126
01:35:48,952 --> 01:35:51,578
Stop there now.
We're gonna have a look around, OK?

1127
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:53,664
That's fine. What are you looking for?

1128
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:56,333
- What is it you're looking for?
- What's in the hay, Tommy?

1129
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:58,669
- How are you, Tommy?
- Doherty.

1130
01:35:58,795 --> 01:36:01,588
- Where's Gralton, Tommy?
- I don't know where Gralton is.

1131
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:05,008
Leave my hay alone. You won't find him
in there, whatever you do.

1132
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:07,344
- Sweeney, let me away up the road.
- What's your rush?

1133
01:36:07,429 --> 01:36:11,098
I have no rush. I'm just trying to do
a man's job and just take me hay home.

1134
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:14,601
I don't have James Gralton.
Let me away up the road, Sweeney!

1135
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:22,443
Gentlemen.
Sean, great to see you.

1136
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:25,279
- You all right?
- Aye. Hanging in there.

1137
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:26,947
I'm freezing.

1138
01:36:30,118 --> 01:36:32,786
There's some eggs there.
Bread and milk.

1139
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:36,039
Good man.

1140
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:42,379
- You're still in one piece anyway.
- Still breathing.

1141
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:14,411
We're here now.

1142
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:30,052
The town hall was packed
for the meeting. Two to a seat.

1143
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:34,264
We presented the letters of support
from around the country first.

1144
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:39,019
But what really infuriated them
were the petitions from America.

1145
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:41,271
The Mayor was there all puffed up,

1146
01:37:41,397 --> 01:37:45,526
and one eejit talked about a communist plot
to nationalise women and children.

1147
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:49,446
They didn't want to let
your mother speak,

1148
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:53,200
but the gallery started chanting
"fair play", so they gave in.

1149
01:37:56,454 --> 01:37:58,914
Her hands were shaking
holding her notes.

1150
01:37:59,582 --> 01:38:01,708
But her voice was steady.

1151
01:38:02,544 --> 01:38:04,628
You should have seen
the look in her eye.

1152
01:38:09,133 --> 01:38:12,135
"What can a mother say
when about to lose a son?

1153
01:38:13,429 --> 01:38:17,057
"Part of me wants to scream again
as in childbirth,

1154
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:21,728
"and part of me wants to ask
'What is his crime? '.

1155
01:38:21,813 --> 01:38:24,648
"Why is an old tin hall so dangerous?

1156
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:28,986
"Am I to blame for giving him books,

1157
01:38:29,112 --> 01:38:31,822
"teaching the boy to think
and ask questions?

1158
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:38,161
"He brought back the world
which he had seen to the hall he built.

1159
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:40,664
"Is that the crime?

1160
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:45,002
"If we can take a man
from his home without a trial,

1161
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:47,754
"send him off because of
what is in his head.

1162
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:54,511
"I may lose my child,
but Ireland loses much, much more."

1163
01:38:56,389 --> 01:38:57,848
The gallery cheered.

1164
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:01,476
The Council ignored her.

1165
01:39:03,396 --> 01:39:06,607
They took the letters of support
and they burned them outside.

1166
01:39:09,277 --> 01:39:11,903
All those meetings
up and down the country.

1167
01:39:13,364 --> 01:39:17,784
The truth is, your support is confined
to the trade unions and usual friends.

1168
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:21,872
The IRA are even on the fence.
They don't want to upset the Church.

1169
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:23,790
And the deportation stands.

1170
01:39:26,669 --> 01:39:29,129
Father Seamus came to see me.

1171
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:31,965
He fears it'll turn the youth
against the Church.

1172
01:39:32,050 --> 01:39:34,551
I prefer the Sheridans.

1173
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:37,471
At least he has the courage
of his convictions.

1174
01:39:37,555 --> 01:39:41,183
He said he'd go over Sheridan's head
to talk to the bishop.

1175
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:43,644
He'd even go to Dublin
to try and make peace.

1176
01:39:44,937 --> 01:39:46,188
If?

1177
01:39:47,315 --> 01:39:49,775
If you promised
not to build the hall again.

1178
01:39:51,194 --> 01:39:53,737
And lived a quiet, private life.

1179
01:40:23,309 --> 01:40:25,352
A quiet, private life.

1180
01:40:27,397 --> 01:40:28,939
With you, Oonagh.

1181
01:40:35,947 --> 01:40:38,949
I wish with all my heart
we had another life to live.

1182
01:40:44,622 --> 01:40:49,126
Jimmy, they've drafted in more soldiers.
By the dozen.

1183
01:40:50,545 --> 01:40:52,838
It's only a matter of time.

1184
01:40:54,382 --> 01:40:56,174
God, this hurts so much.

1185
01:41:01,723 --> 01:41:04,891
These are our last moments, I know it.

1186
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:09,104
I'm never gonna see you again.

1187
01:41:43,139 --> 01:41:44,514
Gardai! Gardai!

1188
01:41:44,599 --> 01:41:46,933
Don't move, Jimmy, don't move!
Don't move!

1189
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:50,395
We have you now, you dirty bastard, ya!
We have you now, boy!

1190
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:53,940
We have you now, Jimmy!
There'll be no getting away this time!

1191
01:41:54,317 --> 01:41:56,985
Let him stand up.

1192
01:41:58,404 --> 01:42:00,071
Come on now. Out.

1193
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:03,825
What's going on here?
Get out of my house!

1194
01:42:13,795 --> 01:42:16,046
We're nearly done here.
Thanks.

1195
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:20,592
Three pounds, nine shillings
and thrupence ha'penny, Sergeant.

1196
01:42:20,676 --> 01:42:22,594
- Is that all you have?
- Aye.

1197
01:42:23,846 --> 01:42:26,389
And the good news is
we don't confiscate it.

1198
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:29,267
The bad news is it'll be going
towards paying your fare.

1199
01:42:38,778 --> 01:42:40,487
So, how did you find me?

1200
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:55,460
Can I visit my mother to say goodbye?

1201
01:42:55,545 --> 01:42:57,128
Not a hope in hell.

1202
01:42:57,213 --> 01:42:59,798
She's frail. My last chance to see her.

1203
01:42:59,882 --> 01:43:03,635
I've strict orders to get you out
of here and before the riff-raff come.

1204
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:08,473
- Where are you taking me?
- You're going straight to Cork,

1205
01:43:08,558 --> 01:43:11,142
and then to Cobh
where we have a ship waiting for you.

1206
01:43:18,276 --> 01:43:21,069
Should have kept your big mouth shut,
Gralton.

1207
01:43:21,153 --> 01:43:24,406
You always had to be cock of the walk.
You had this coming to you.

1208
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:27,367
Can I have a sheet of paper
to write her a note?

1209
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:29,786
Save your tears for the crossing.

1210
01:43:29,871 --> 01:43:31,955
There's a fine postal service
from New York.

1211
01:43:32,582 --> 01:43:34,082
There he is.

1212
01:43:41,257 --> 01:43:43,800
- There's the bollocks!
- You antichrist!

1213
01:43:43,885 --> 01:43:46,011
You won't set foot in our land again!

1214
01:43:46,095 --> 01:43:48,388
Good riddance to you Gralton,
you Red bastard.

1215
01:43:50,182 --> 01:43:52,726
You're like Charlie Chaplin
with a jacket on.

1216
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:56,229
This'll cheer you up. The ship waiting
for you is called the Britannic.

1217
01:43:56,314 --> 01:43:58,189
Please. Please!

1218
01:43:58,274 --> 01:43:59,858
Show the man some respect!

1219
01:43:59,942 --> 01:44:03,695
He has more courage and decency
than all of you put together.

1220
01:44:16,042 --> 01:44:18,043
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy!

1221
01:44:19,921 --> 01:44:21,463
- Marie.

1222
01:44:21,547 --> 01:44:24,591
- Jimmy!
- Marie! Stay where you are!

1223
01:44:25,718 --> 01:44:28,345
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy!

1224
01:44:32,934 --> 01:44:36,227
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy!

1225
01:44:36,312 --> 01:44:38,897
- Get back, you little fecker!
- Get back!

1226
01:44:38,981 --> 01:44:41,107
Go on, clear off!

1227
01:44:48,074 --> 01:44:50,075
- Clear off, the lot of you!
- BOY: Jimmy!

1228
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:52,035
Clear off!

1229
01:44:52,954 --> 01:44:54,913
You're under arrest for kidnap!

1230
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:59,250
Get off the road
or we'll run you over.

1231
01:44:59,335 --> 01:45:00,669
Go home!

1232
01:45:00,795 --> 01:45:03,004
Get off the road. Get off the road!

1233
01:45:05,466 --> 01:45:06,800
Get away from him.

1234
01:45:06,884 --> 01:45:10,095
- Don't let the bastards get you!
- We won't stop dancing.

1235
01:45:10,179 --> 01:45:13,807
- Don't forget to send us more records.
- We'll keep dancing and dreaming.

1236
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:16,768
I'm gonna teach my daughter
the shim sham. We'll miss you.

1237
01:45:16,852 --> 01:45:19,562
- You'll write to us?
- I'll send you back money for a party.

1238
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:21,982
Get this truck going.

1239
01:45:22,066 --> 01:45:24,985
- You're a good man, Jimmy!
- Don't forget us, Jimmy.

1240
01:45:25,069 --> 01:45:28,446
- You won't forget us, Jimmy, will you?
- Drive over 'em!

1241
01:45:28,531 --> 01:45:31,324
Get off the road!
Get off the road! Get off the road!

1242
01:45:31,409 --> 01:45:33,159
Get off!

1243
01:45:33,244 --> 01:45:35,203
You don't deserve this, Jimmy!

1244
01:45:39,375 --> 01:45:40,709
Go on, Jimmy.

1245
01:45:45,923 --> 01:45:50,844
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain

1246
01:45:50,928 --> 01:45:55,932
I wish I had my heart again

1247
01:45:56,017 --> 01:46:02,063
And vainly think I'd not complain

1248
01:46:02,148 --> 01:46:09,237
Is go dte tu mo mhuirnin slan

1249
01:46:10,406 --> 01:46:15,952
Siuil, siuil, siuil a ruin

1250
01:46:16,037 --> 01:46:21,833
Siuil go socair agus siuil go ciuin

1251
01:46:21,917 --> 01:46:27,756
Siuil go doras agus ealaigh lium

1252
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:36,097
Is go dte tu mo mhuirnin slan
