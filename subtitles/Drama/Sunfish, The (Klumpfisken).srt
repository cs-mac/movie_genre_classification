FILM MAKER WITH SUPPORT FROM
NEW DANISH SCREEN

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,445
A FILM BY SØREN BALLE

3
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,126
Lars!
Check that it's running properly.

4
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,530
It's okay!

5
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,080
Yes!

6
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,128
THE SUNFISH

7
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,966
So Lise was down at the inn.

8
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,202
- Is she the wee fat one?
- She's not fat. Just a bit heavy.

9
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,884
So I'm talking to her at the inn
and it's going alright.

10
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,450
I'm thinking I'm halfway in,
but it turns out she has a boyfriend.

11
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,563
She could have told me that.

12
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,923
I sat there for an hour.
What a cockteaser.

13
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,888
14, 15, 20.

14
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,521
Two for you! 25!

15
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,725
- Kesse!
- Yes.

16
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:39,371
- Come to the meeting room, okay?
- Yes.

17
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,289
Listen. The technical university
wants to do some studies.

18
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,688
They want to send biologists out.
They'll repay with 3 tons cod.

19
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,929
- I'll take a handful then.
- Easy now.

20
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,404
- They want the Danish seines.
- That's you Kesse.

21
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,282
- I'm not taking anyone.
- It's 3 tons fish.

22
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,607
- They're just making our life hard.
- Times are changing, Kesse.

23
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,361
Yeah, in the old days
they'd be thrown in the water.

24
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,723
You're such a dinosaur, Kesse.

25
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,009
- See you tomorrow.
- Sorte! Fisherman's swim!

26
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,850
Kesse!

27
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,371
Phuket, Thailand. Lisbeth will book
tickets tomorrow. How about that?

28
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,407
- Say you want to come.
- No, thanks.

29
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,243
You need to get out
and go on a holiday.

30
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,364
I'm not going anywhere.

31
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,602
Oh. Suit yourself.

32
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,965
Okay! Everybody come over here.

33
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,408
Hey! Throw the balls to me.

34
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,161
I'm not going to say this again.
Get out of the water.

35
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,526
We'll continue we're we left off.
It was backstrokes.

36
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,404
Move your arms like mill wheels near
the ears. No talking while you swim.

37
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,127
The legs go like this. Okay?

38
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,250
Yes! Balls up here, please!

39
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,886
You do backstrokes on your back,
okay?

40
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,887
Minor detail. Push your stomach up.
That's it.

41
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:25,168
And put your head down.
And now the arms. Okay?

42
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,569
I've told you before. No smoking!

43
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,487
We have a smoking ban.
Smoke outside or stop coming here.

44
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,207
Kesse!

45
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,801
- You're very quiet today.
- Yes.

46
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,890
Come on. Cough it up.

47
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,207
- It's the finances.
- Oh.

48
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,611
- Could you help me out?
- How much is it?

49
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,810
Well

50
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:18,047
100 or 150 to shut Ole up
until I'm back on track.

51
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,290
- 150,000?
- Yes.

52
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,209
Or 100,000.
Or maybe just 80,000. I don't know.

53
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,930
- I don't have that much, Kesse.
- I doesn't matter.

54
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,445
- Focus, Lars.
- All right, all right.

55
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,405
No undersizes.
We need a good price.

56
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,360
- All right, all right.
- Drop that. Do your job properly.

57
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,451
All right, all right. All right.

58
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:57,886
Why are you so cranky today? Did
you get up on the wrong side of bed?

59
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,806
- Are there more?
- They were the last ones.

60
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,210
I think we have visitors, Kesse.
Inspections.

61
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,807
- Hi there.
- Hello.

62
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,530
- I'll check up here.
- Yes.

63
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,125
- Did you unload?
- Yes. There's nothing left.

64
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,443
- Can we have a look below?
- Sure.

65
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,807
Everything looks okay.
There's nothing down here.

66
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,686
- Did you think you'd find anything?
- I had hoped.

67
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,488
- There's always hope.
- No, everything is okay.

68
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,843
Goodbye.

69
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,125
Hello, Pia. The usual.

70
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,722
- Didn't you see the new menu?
- No.

71
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,845
- Do you like it?
- What's wrong with the old one?

72
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,206
- Do you want to try a new dish?
- No, just the usual for me.

73
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,643
All right.

74
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:32,562
Things have changed lately. Kirsten
no longer handles the accounts.

75
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,286
- Milk?
- No, just black coffee.

76
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,721
You had two incomes then. Plus
you were generous in the divorce.

77
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,329
I couldn't think straight back then.

78
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:53,529
We can conclude that the cod quotas
from 2005 were an over-investment.

79
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,323
- What's this about?
- Maybe you should sell the quotas.

80
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,404
- Sublease them for a while?
- No.

81
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,400
Sell them to one of the bigger boats.

82
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,004
You could still make a profit.
Many others have done it, Kesse.

83
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,966
Are you telling me
to wind everything up?

84
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,449
We can't keep investing in a failure.

85
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,245
If I sell the quotas
I'll have absolutely nothing left.

86
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,241
You haven't shown a constant profit
for a long period of time.

87
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,967
I need time to find a solution
and turn this around.

88
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,482
I can't give you that, Kesse.

89
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,685
Is that how you treat
a lifelong loyal customer?

90
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,050
I'm under pressure too.
It's not like I'm enjoying this.

91
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,528
At least give me six months.

92
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,489
- At least give me that.
- Okay. One month. That's all.

93
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,762
Shit!

94
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,084
- You put all the receipts in, right?
- I think so.

95
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,363
Did you sod them by date?

96
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,884
- Just January and February.
- I don't have time for that.

97
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,405
- That just makes it easier for her.
- That's easy for you to say.

98
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,721
- Did you sort by category?
- I didn't have time.

99
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,851
Oh ... she just prefers that.

100
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,489
- Yes.
- She just hates the mess.

101
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,850
Why don't you go outside
instead of just standing there?

102
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,566
We'll leave it
to the finance minister.

103
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,888
Søren!

104
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,920
All right.

105
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:47,201
You're a good fisherman, Kesse.
But that's not enough today.

106
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,287
- You need to be a businessman too.
- That's for sure.

107
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:59,728
Sell everything while you still can.
And just wipe the slate clean.

108
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,602
Wipe the slate clean? And do what?
This is all I know.

109
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,010
- Come work at the fish factory.
- No, thanks.

110
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,524
- You hate filleting all day.
- I'm doing just fine.

111
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,963
Do you expect me to believe that?

112
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,241
Numbers, quotas. That stuff is gone.
I could be in this garden all day.

113
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,808
I get holiday allowance.
Do you know what that is?

114
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,528
And I can go to Thailand with my wife
without a care. That's life.

115
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,929
That's your life.

116
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,008
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

117
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,971
- It's fascinating, right?
- Yes.

118
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,686
And it can jump.

119
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,761
It suddenly rushes to the surface,
jumps and does a belly flop.

120
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,443
- Have you seen it do that?
- Not yet. But I've heard about it.

121
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,610
Perhaps you also heard,
that I'm the one who caught it.

122
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,407
- Right ...
- It's true.

123
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,047
Okay. How?

124
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,608
With something we call a net.

125
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,491
Sure.

126
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,048
It resembles our situation back then.
I'd advise you to get out.

127
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,411
- It's a vicious spiral.
- I'll work myself out of it.

128
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,729
- I just need new quotas.
- You'll need a loan for that.

129
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,527
- I have the house.
- Choose your battles.

130
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,766
- You can still wipe the slate clean.
- Drop the clean slate talk!

131
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,691
- It's aggravating.
- All right.

132
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,044
- Sorry about that.
- Don't be.

133
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,687
Hello there, Alf. How are things?

134
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,446
Just fine.
The weather could be better.

135
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,881
- Do you have any cod quotas to spare?
- It's too soon to say.

136
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,050
- How about plaice?
- No.

137
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,285
Well I need them myself
until I know how it looks.

138
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,404
- Why don't you try the inn?
- I will.

139
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:53,290
- Let me know if you hear anything.
- Yes, I'll call you. Take care.

140
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,729
- Hello.
- Hello.

141
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,286
Hello, Kesse! Good to see you.

142
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,371
- Did you miss me?
- Yes! It's your round.

143
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,485
I'm sure it is.
Katrine, give me five cold beers.

144
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,163
It's too soon to sublease.

145
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,921
- What about you, Poul?
- No.

146
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,727
- Help me out here.
- I'm holding on to mine.

147
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,810
- Boxer?
- It's too soon.

148
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,686
I can't believe this.
I shouldn't have bought beer.

149
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,647
- Yes, you should.
- Cheers.

150
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,084
Oh, it's you. What are you doing?

151
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,246
- I'm searching for quotas.
- Any luck?

152
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:04,642
No. It's either the wrong species
or zone. And they're expensive.

153
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,402
- Price is relative.
- No, it's a fact.

154
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,007
Kjeld!

155
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,846
Kjeld?

156
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,164
Kjeld? Is that offer
with the biologists still on?

157
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,408
What do you mean?

158
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,964
- 3 tons cod as a bonus, right?
- Kesse, I don't want any trouble.

159
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,331
- I'll have to clean up after you.
- I really need that bonus.

160
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,001
- It's 5 trips in all.
- All right.

161
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,446
- Fine.
- Thank you.

162
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,286
"Just give it up.
You're not getting any."

163
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,728
And I had just given her
a Tequila Sunrise.

164
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,244
So I took it back and drank it all
right in front of her.

165
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,490
It tastes like shit
but I wasn't giving it to her.

166
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,486
- Are you listening?
- Huh? Yes.

167
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,251
No, you're not. What did I say then?

168
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,611
- Something you didn't want to drink.
- You're not listening.

169
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,331
Kesse!

170
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,649
It's a woman. It's a god damn woman!

171
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,164
- Are you coming on more sails?
- Yes. The agreement is five.

172
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,567
- Five?
- That's what we agreed.

173
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,366
- He didn't tell me.
- No.

174
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,002
- I didn't know anything about this.
- Oh, it's you?

175
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,766
- Hello again.
- Do you know each other?

176
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,480
- Get moving, Lars.
- Aye aye, captain.

177
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,844
You must be Kristian.
I'm Gerd Bertelsen.

178
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:05,650
I'm doing regulation research.
I'll measure catch and mesh width ...

179
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,325
I don't care what you do. Just stay
out of the way. We're leaving now.

180
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,570
- Do you need help?
- Yes, please.

181
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,531
We look at the population and
try to make it more sustainable.

182
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,009
- So are you measuring all the fish?
- No. We don't have time for that.

183
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,965
So what do you need it for?

184
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,006
Primarily to improve the catch
according to the mesh width.

185
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,366
- Will we need to get new gear?
- Some of it is very outdated.

186
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,446
Lars! You can't be here. Go up there!

187
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,120
- Move away.
- Yes.

188
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,683
- It is rolling okay?
- Just fine!

189
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,200
- Do you have a minute?
- Yes.

190
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,443
- My work is for your sake too.
- Oh.

191
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,521
Our calculations are the basis
of a sustainable population.

192
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,405
- What do you know about fishing?
- A lot.

193
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,605
Sure. From university.
I've been fishing for 30 years.

194
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,811
- I know all about the population.
- Good. Then how does it look?

195
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,004
One day there's none.
The next there's plenty.

196
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,205
But if you saw the slow day,
you think that's how things are.

197
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,082
Stop it. All species are decreasing
in numbers. You know that.

198
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,762
- It's a livelihood for me.
- And when the fish are gone?

199
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,891
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

200
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,762
If you have a problem with me
I'll just find another boat.

201
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,122
- I don't.
- It seems like it.

202
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,406
This is a workplace. It's dangerous.
When I tell you to move, you move.

203
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,082
- But I have to stand somewhere.
- All right.

204
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,366
- All right what?
- I'll find a spot for you.

205
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,562
Good.

206
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,042
See you tomorrow.

207
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,684
Look at that ass.

208
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,521
I might invite her to a steak
restaurant or to some Italian place.

209
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,164
- Don't. I don't want any trouble.
- There won't be any trouble.

210
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,968
- A Copenhagener and a biologist.
- So? I'll just screw her.

211
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,529
- Do you not understand me?
- But ... Yes.

212
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,247
- Good. Now go finish up.
- All right, all right.

213
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,961
Just go! I'll be home soon!

214
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,563
Don't talk to me like that.
I want to talk to Kesse. Not you.

215
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,525
- Well, you can't.
- Hello, Inga.

216
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,568
- I brought you something.
- Are you done already?

217
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,647
- He's almost fully fledged.
- And I do feel like pushing him out.

218
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,522
- I got two different cakes here.
- You're too kind.

219
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,403
You need to gain weight.
Women like men with a bit of flesh.

220
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,004
- I'll see you at home, Lars.
- Don't come down here! Just go!

221
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,002
Kesse!

222
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,200
- That's a fancy new vehicle.
- We need to live a little.

223
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,842
- I hear you're in need of quotas.
- Oh?

224
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,005
- Plaice. 4.5 per kilo. 60 tons.
- I have all I need now.

225
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,650
Oh, that's right.
You like biologists after all.

226
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:30,250
- Did you want something else?
- No. That's it. Take care.

227
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,446
- How long have you had the boat?
- For a long time.

228
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,566
- Lars, can you fix the net?
- Yes.

229
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,441
- So how long is that?
- I don't have time to talk now.

230
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,442
Let's get moving, Lars.

231
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,008
- Fishermen don't like biologists.
- I know that.

232
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,491
- But I'm only the deck hand.
- Okay ...

233
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,561
- And I happen to like biologists.
- I see.

234
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,924
Especially when they look
as cute as you.

235
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,289
- And I thought ...
- Now, Lars!

236
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,405
- You probably find this hilarious.
- Not at all.

237
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,171
Drink some of this. Tiny gulps.

238
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,161
I found some patches.
I don't know if they can expire.

239
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,328
It goes behind the ear.

240
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,684
You might need
to pull your hair away.

241
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:18,447
There. And don't sit in here.
Go outside in the fresh air.

242
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,484
And keep your eye on the horizon.

243
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,766
You'll be fine.
Do you want to come outside?

244
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,082
- Thank you.
- What about that?

245
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,762
Just leave it. I'll be back.

246
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,123
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

247
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,449
- Do you want some fish?
- Sure.

248
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,843
Lars, can you put them in a bag?

249
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,125
- How many do you want?
- Just a couple.

250
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,167
- Just use flour and butter.
- How much do you want?

251
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,129
- For you, 500 kroner.
- That's an illegal sale.

252
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,766
Someone's feeling all better.

253
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,045
Okay, so they're for free.
But the bag is 100 kroner.

254
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,011
See you.

255
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,608
- You're here?
- Yes.

256
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,481
- Hello, Kesse. The usual?
- Yes, please.

257
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,089
- What about the plaice?
- I'm afraid I burnt them.

258
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,450
Don't say that out loud.
This town will have your head.

259
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,601
- I just can't multitask.
- So how long are you here for?

260
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,401
A couple of months for now.
It might get extended.

261
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,565
I thought someone like you
would hurry back to Copenhagen.

262
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,882
- Someone like me?
- Yes.

263
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,842
Would you like
to show me around some day?

264
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,682
- Like some sod of tour guide?
- Yes.

265
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,129
Did you hear that, Pia?
A tour guide. What do you think?

266
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,449
You'll scare off
the rest of the tourists.

267
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,728
You don't have to do it.

268
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,970
I should be able to spare
the 15 minutes that'll take.

269
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,362
How about Sunday?

270
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,849
- So there you go.
- Thanks. Sure.

271
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,201
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

272
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,687
Goodbye, Kesse.

273
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,004
Come in!

274
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,088
- Hi!
- Hello.

275
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,682
I'll be there in a second.
Come on in.

276
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,090
- I'll just wait here.
- No, come on in.

277
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,651
- Thanks for this. It's nice of you.
- Don't mention it.

278
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,850
I can start by showing you
one of our greatest sights.

279
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,203
This roundabout.
We're very proud of it.

280
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,645
Yes ... it's very nice.

281
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,841
- There's only one way in and out.
- That can't be true.

282
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,809
- I'll show you.
- That is so stupid. Go round again.

283
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,724
- One more? Okay, let's do it.
- Yes.

284
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:09,927
There's a bunker in the middle.
I don't know why.

285
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,010
- It's nuts.
- Crazy.

286
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,967
- One more time?
- No, let's go.

287
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,560
Did you always
want to be a fisherman?

288
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:28,722
My dad and granddad were fishermen
so it was kind of expected.

289
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,561
Wow! Oh my God.

290
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,409
This is so cool.

291
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,649
- It's not like Copenhagen.
- No.

292
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,731
- Actually I've never been there.
- Never?

293
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:01,445
I was one week in Tenerife
about 15 years ago. But that's it.

294
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,843
- You're a real adventurer.
- Yes.

295
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,766
- You have to see Copenhagen.
- Really?

296
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,281
Maybe you're right.

297
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,884
- I think I'd get lost.
- I'll show you around.

298
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,968
- Then maybe I should go some day.
- That's a deal.

299
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,241
- Oh my God.
- Yup.

300
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,611
Where's the open sign?
I hope they're not closed.

301
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,925
That's too bad.
I wanted to take you up there.

302
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,966
Why are they closed
when the weather is so nice?

303
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,163
I think we can get in here.

304
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:08,605
- Don't do that.
- Relax. I'll try and get in.

305
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,491
Do you want to get in trouble?

306
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,641
How long have you and Lars
been fishing together?

307
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,844
A long time.

308
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,647
- He's a funny character.
- Aren't we all more or less?

309
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,003
Yes, I guess so.

310
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,010
Lars is a good guy.
He's had a rough life.

311
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,922
His dad Gunnar and my dad were
fishing partners for many years.

312
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:47,331
One night we'd been out all night.
We were going for the last catch.

313
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,321
Gunnar got caught in the net.
There was nothing we could do.

314
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,125
Lars was just 13 or 14 years old.

315
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,689
For a few years
he had trouble readjusting.

316
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,965
Then his mum asked me
if I could take him on the boat.

317
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,128
He's been with me ever since.

318
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,770
So he's an okay guy.

319
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,120
- There we go.
- Thank you.

320
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,047
- Bye.
- Bye.

321
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,491
- Hello, Pia.
- The usual?

322
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,091
- No, wait. I'll try something new.
- Really?

323
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,529
- Which one do you want then?
- What's a Hawaii mix?

324
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,123
Sausages and fries with pineapple.
And with curry.

325
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:18,008
- It's good.
- Then get me one of those.

326
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,771
- Do you believe in clean slates?
- What do mean?

327
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,325
I don't know.
I'm just talking rubbish.

328
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,570
You don't get how serious this is.
A bonus is just a drop in the ocean.

329
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,445
It's a step in the right direction.

330
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,291
Will you take a biologist
with you every month?

331
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,370
You need to look
at the operations and costs.

332
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:57,966
Do you still have that deck hand on
fixed wages? No one else does that.

333
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,041
- I gave you a chance.
- I found the solution. More quotas.

334
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,007
More quotas? You need to
cut down on the costs and optimize.

335
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:13,730
Then go fish yourself, wise ass!
7 years ago I could easily get a loan.

336
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,403
You told me to buy the cod quotas.
I come here with a solution.

337
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,844
The least you can do is help me.
The house is my collateral.

338
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,042
- Did you find the quotas?
- I have an offer.

339
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,210
- At a good price?
- It's okay.

340
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,206
It's a temporary overdraft.
And I need to approve them.

341
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,081
- You have to cut down the costs.
- Wherever possible.

342
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,208
You know what I mean.

343
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,408
- Lars. We need to talk.
- Yes.

344
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:04,448
- I'm sorry but I have to fire you.
- Shut up.

345
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,850
- I can't afford you anymore.
- Everything is okay.

346
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,688
- Everything is going to hell.
- We're catching fish. It's all good.

347
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,402
No. Listen to me.
I wouldn't just say this.

348
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,962
I might be able
to take you on again at some point.

349
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,291
What am I supposed to do then?
There are no other jobs out there.

350
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,927
- I was always with you.
- I don't want this either.

351
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,926
- I just can't help you right now.
- You never did!

352
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,600
Don't do this, Lars. Lars!

353
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,560
I get why Kirsten left you.
You're worthless!

354
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,251
- Morning!
- Morning.

355
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,171
Can you take this? Thanks.

356
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,046
- Can you let go the moorings?
- Is Lars not coming? Is he ill?

357
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,561
Yes.

358
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,685
- Let go the moorings and let's go.
- Yes.

359
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,931
- Do you need help?
- Grab a hold here.

360
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,363
Grab a good hold.
I'll count to three.

361
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,962
One, two, three! One more time.

362
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,802
One, two, three! There!

363
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,886
I couldn't have done that alone.
Now loosen the line.

364
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,129
Watch out for the flood.

365
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,529
Come on now. Pull!
You can do this. Yes.

366
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:36,403
So that was it then. You don't have
to go out to sea for a long time now.

367
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,168
- It was a nice experience.
- I'm glad you think that.

368
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,051
I hope you got the data you need.

369
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:57,286
If not, you can come with me again.
We can arrange that.

370
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:38,163
<i>You bastard! I need to talk to you!
Kesse!</i>

371
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,450
- What the hell are you doing?
- Shut up! We need to talk!

372
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,849
Go home and sleep it off.

373
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,328
- Stop that!
- I want to talk to you!

374
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,645
I don't want to talk to you
when you're drunk. You know that.

375
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,525
- Stop that, damn it!
- We need to talk!

376
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,248
- What do you want to say?
- You're a bastard.

377
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:09,209
Is that all?
Damn it! Stop that! Lars.

378
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,168
Stop it. Come here. Don't.

379
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,330
Go away!

380
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,408
Don't!

381
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:25,007
- Go home!
- Bastard.

382
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,729
Go home.

383
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,085
Can I get a beer?

384
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,089
- Thanks.
- Katrine ...

385
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:52,123
- Give me 3 beers. What's up?
- What's up with what?

386
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,602
What's it like
taking a biologist with you?

387
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,402
- It's okay.
- You told us to not do it.

388
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,564
- Did I?
- Yes. But you did.

389
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,486
- Even on your spare time.
- You people talk a lot.

390
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,440
- Don't get things mixed up.
- Did you want anything else?

391
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,325
I'm just saying.

392
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,528
- Hello, Kesse.
- Hello, Carsten.

393
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,361
Do you still have those quotas?

394
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:42,851
- Wait. Can you hear that? Listen.
- What?

395
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,206
- It's the tune. It's changed.
- Funny. Do you want to sell or not?

396
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,847
- How many do you need?
- Your 60 tons of plaice.

397
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,362
You'll be busy on that wee boat.

398
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:01,209
- How much do you want for them?
- For you, 4.5 kroner per kilo.

399
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,364
You must be crazy.

400
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,361
- I'll pay 1.5 kroner per kilo.
- This isn't a gift shop.

401
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,291
- 2.5 then?
- No.

402
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,609
- 2.5. Come on.
- No.

403
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,570
3 then. That's a good offer.

404
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,209
- That's 180.000 in your pocket.
- Why should I lose money on you?

405
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,570
- Come on.
- No. I'll talk to you later.

406
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,328
- Now what?
- I have another suggestion.

407
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:59,369
Give me the quotas for 1.5 per kilo
and I'll bring in extras for you.

408
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:05,010
- What are you talking about?
- I know how you got that car.

409
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,882
- Is that biologist still with you?
- No.

410
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:31,563
Give me a couple of days.
I'll see if can work something out.

411
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,248
Thanks.

412
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,922
It's too risky.
It's not the 80's anymore.

413
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,805
There are more inspectors
than fishermen.

414
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,049
- I'll lose it all.
- It's a slippery slope.

415
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:01,246
- You'll end up in Carsten's pocket.
- I don't want to talk about it!

416
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:07,049
You just want me to shut down
and rot to death at the fish factory.

417
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,050
His name is Preben.
This is his number.

418
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:23,088
Call him when you bring extras in.
He'll come down and get it.

419
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,644
- Is he an okay guy?
- Sure. He's done this for years.

420
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,402
- And he's never been caught?
- No.

421
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:38,721
He'll pay you in cash.
Then we'll settle our account.

422
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,323
I have to say
that this surprised me.

423
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,729
- What?
- This. You.

424
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:52,006
You were always against
illegal fishing. You were a saint.

425
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,802
Was it all just hot air?

426
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,362
This is not something I'll brag about.

427
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,086
See you, Kesse.

428
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:20,123
- Hello, Inga.
- Hello, Kesse. What do you want?

429
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:25,804
- Is Lars here?
- Yes. Lars. Lars!

430
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,210
- All right, all right. Calm down.
- Hello, Lars.

431
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,803
- What do you want?
- I can take you back on.

432
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,851
- What happened?
- Do you want to come?

433
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,721
- Yes. Of course.
- See you tomorrow at 4 then.

434
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,601
Aye aye, captain.

435
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,929
- Do you want a cup of coffee?
- No, thanks.

436
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:58,127
I need to go. Take care.

437
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,931
- See you, Kesse!
- Yes.

438
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,404
- Was that all?
- Yes. 8 cod crates.

439
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,486
Put them over here and cover them.

440
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,491
- Do you have the fishing report?
- Yes. Here you go.

441
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,963
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes. Thanks.

442
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,127
- What do we do now?
- We sail back.

443
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,721
Preben will pick up the rest there.

444
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,205
Are you Preben?
Can you park over here?

445
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,769
- Sure. Let's have a look at it.
- Yes.

446
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,166
- So that was it.
- Yes.

447
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,921
- So I'll see you next week.
- We'll see.

448
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:16,205
Call me when you have something.

449
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,088
- So was everything okay?
- Yes. No problems.

450
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,086
- Let's see.
- I hope they're all there.

451
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,409
- Everything looks okay.
- Good.

452
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,851
Nothing to worry about then.

453
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,080
There.

454
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,690
- Do you want a beer?
- No, thanks.

455
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,884
- See you next week.
- Yes.

456
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,086
- Hello.
- Hi. What are you doing here?

457
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,689
- Will you help me with these?
- Sure.

458
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,487
- Did you pay for them?
- No.

459
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,846
- Can I come in?
- Yes, of course.

460
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,402
Then you cut it along the spine.

461
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,645
Then we remove this bone.
It's not nice to eat that.

462
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,322
- Are you getting it?
- Sure.

463
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:40,408
Cut the sides and then ...
Then you cut along the spine and ...

464
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:45,367
I'm in the wilderness here.

465
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:50,088
- I'll fillet them. You cook them.
- Or I could just eat them.

466
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:56,762
I don't have any dessert

467
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,249
I'm too full anyway.
It was really good.

468
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,444
Yes. You never go wrong with fish.

469
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,448
So ...

470
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,687
Now I know how to cook fish.

471
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,166
- Next time they might not burn.
- Right.

472
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,602
Yes ...

473
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,849
Anyway ... Yes ...

474
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,726
- Are you going home?
- Yes.

475
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,207
All right.

476
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,450
- Should I clear the table?
- No, I'll do it.

477
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:01,928
- I had a really good time.
- Me too.

478
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,882
What are you laughing at?

479
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,651
- It's good for my back.
- I hope I don't get seasick.

480
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,161
Come here.

481
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:17,567
- How long were you married?
- 19 years.

482
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,082
Then she met a guy from Aalborg.

483
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,005
I didn't know anything
for about a year.

484
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,205
- Ouch.
- Yes.

485
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,726
And then she left me for him.

486
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:44,043
- Have you ever worn a ring?
- No.

487
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:49,883
- No one ever stayed that long.
- Why?

488
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,249
It all ...

489
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,843
- It all has to fall into place.
- Yes.

490
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,890
I can't really explain it.

491
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:07,846
- Sounds like they were foolish.
- Very foolish.

492
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:22,491
- That's not true.
- Yes. Yes it is.

493
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,690
- So it's still working?
- Damn right.

494
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,844
Congratulations.
Have you called her?

495
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,771
- No.
- Why not?

496
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:37,251
- I'm not really her type.
- But is she not your type?

497
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,250
She's nice. Very nice actually.

498
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,922
- What's the problem then? Call her.
- No.

499
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:49,723
- Then text her.
- Text her? And write what?

500
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:53,441
Write: "Hello, sweetie."

501
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,047
Hello sweetie?
I'm not going to write that.

502
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,966
- That's how you do it.
- Hello, sweetie?

503
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,124
- I'll just write "Hey there".
- No.

504
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,921
- Why not?
- Hey there?

505
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:12,642
Can you not hear it?
Just write "Hey, sweetie".

506
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,802
- Okay. "Hey, sweetie".
- Yes.

507
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,881
- This is stupid.
- What?

508
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,970
- That's how you do it.
- That's not how I do it.

509
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:28,809
Hello, it's Kesse. Hi.

510
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:33,762
Yes, me too. I had a good time.

511
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:39,370
So I was thinking ...
Do you want to go out again?

512
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,568
Oh.

513
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,802
- So this is where you're hiding.
- Hello.

514
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,169
- I'm happy you called.
- Yes.

515
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,726
- Should we go?
- Are you in a hurry?

516
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,527
No. It's just ...
There are a lot of biologists here.

517
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,923
- Yes, you're on hostile territory.
- Yes.

518
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:37,681
Why don't we have
a look at the sunfish before we go?

519
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,521
- Sunny? Sure.
- Great.

520
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,446
Is this such a good idea?
I'm not sure I want to do this.

521
00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:01,801
- Don't I need a certificate?
- I'll take good care of you.

522
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,888
If a fisherman is under water
it's because he's drowning.

523
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,366
That was incredible! Fantastic!

524
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,562
Wasn't it?

525
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,808
You deserve a kiss.

526
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,211
- Let's go down again.
- Sure.

527
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,447
Here we go.

528
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:11,486
Try Pia's new specialty.

529
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,963
- Hawaii mix.
- Hawaii mix?

530
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:27,326
- So what do you think?
- It's okay.

531
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,930
Is it good?

532
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:35,004
It's different.

533
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,722
- Don't you want any?
- No. It tastes like shit.

534
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,321
I hate you.

535
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:48,287
The fries go all soft because
of the pineapple. They're sloppy.

536
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,643
- What?
- Nothing.

537
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,731
You're not easily knocked down,
are you?

538
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,241
I don't plan to.

539
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:17,330
2 hours before is just a guideline.
We have plenty of time.

540
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,569
- You'd better take these.
- Let me.

541
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:24,691
- You should get moving then.
- Yes, we need to get in there.

542
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:29,129
- I think that was all of it.
- That's it. Thank you.

543
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:34,451
- Have a nice holiday.
- It'll be good to get away.

544
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,847
Okay. How does this shit world

545
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:41,602
Take care. I'll see you, when Sorte
comes home all hot and tanned.

546
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,883
- Let's go, Søren!
- All right, all right.

547
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:10,569
- Was that all?
- Yes. That's all we got today.

548
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,561
Kesse! Inspections.

549
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,607
- Hello there.
- Hello.

550
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,644
- Good catch?
- I'm not complaining.

551
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:54,083
- What did you catch?
- Plaice.

552
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,326
- Did you unload them all?
- Yes, were done.

553
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,488
That's nice.

554
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,566
- The weather was nice today.
- It was fine.

555
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,843
- That wind yesterday was worse.
- Yes.

556
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:14,250
- Hello, Kesse. Let's go.
- Have a nice day.

557
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,408
You too.

558
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:25,568
Jesus Christ. My pulse is racing.
Feel it.

559
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,685
- Shut up, damn it!
- That was damn close.

560
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:34,044
Your number was almost up.

561
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,367
- We're on a roll, Kesse.
- Sure.

562
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,362
- What's up?
- What's up.

563
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,561
Jesus Christ. It's my mother.

564
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:39,885
- She's so afraid you'll starve.
- That looks good.

565
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:43,482
- Tell Inga I said thanks.
- Hello, Lars.

566
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:49,326
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Well ... I ...

567
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:55,801
What's she doing here? Huh?

568
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:05,803
Lars ... Lars, damn it!

569
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,647
What does she think
about your illegal fishing?

570
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,161
Don't be stupid, Lars.

571
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:23,731
You weren't supposed to know
that we're seeing each other.

572
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,848
I don't care about that.

573
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:33,561
- I should have told you.
- "Stay away" you said. No trouble.

574
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,242
- That's because you wanted her.
- I didn't plan it.

575
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,047
I don't care. I don't care.

576
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,567
- Is she a good ride?
- Lars ...

577
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,850
- You must have fucked her.
- Just shut up.

578
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,451
This is Kesse.
Where were you, Preben?

579
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,850
We unloaded a long time ago.
I've been waiting for over an hour.

580
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,805
Call me when you get this message.

581
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,801
I don't want to stay much longer.

582
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:58,361
- Should we throw them in the water?
- Don't be an idiot.

583
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:17,360
Carsten, this is Kesse.
I know it's late but it's important.

584
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:21,121
Preben didn't show up. No!

585
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,688
I have 11 crates
that I don't know what to do with.

586
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:28,890
I tried that! He's not answering!

587
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,401
I am calm, it's just ...

588
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:35,167
Can you call him and tell him
to get his ass over here?

589
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:39,684
Yes. Good.

590
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,407
Let's go, Lars.

591
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,168
Put that one there.
There's no room for ...

592
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:10,171
We'll have to come back for the rest.
Put the last one back.

593
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:59,201
I'll go get the rest and more ice.
You stay here.

594
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,370
God damn it!

595
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,600
Come help me with the crates.

596
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:31,288
- Are you deaf?
- You have a visitor.

597
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,930
What are you doing here?
Were we supposed to meet up?

598
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:49,603
- What's this?
- I'm just keeping them here ...

599
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,451
I'm not stupid.
How long have you done this?

600
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:57,043
- Long enough to get by.
- You're destroying your livelihood.

601
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:00,130
- It's nothing.
- What do you want me to say?

602
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:04,370
- I don't know!
- I thought you were better than this.

603
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:08,525
Well you thought wrong.
What a shame.

604
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,971
That pissed her off.

605
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,806
Butt out, Lars.

606
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,520
What the hell happened to your hand?

607
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:46,003
Damn it.

608
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:52,049
This was the last time, Lars.
I can't do this.

609
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,441
What do you mean?

610
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:00,249
I'm sorry
but I can't take you with me anymore.

611
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,687
It's shit. I know that.

612
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:30,366
So ...
I'll just be getting home then.

613
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,609
You might as well. Take care.

614
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,888
Thanks.

615
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:47,526
Where the hell were you?
You could've at least called.

616
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,530
I had to bring the crates home.

617
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:54,361
You have the address.
Come as quick as you can.

618
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,925
- Good evening. Fishing inspections.
- I can see that.

619
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:26,409
We received an anonymous tip
about you keeping fish here.

620
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,883
Can we look in your garage?

621
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,651
- I can't stop you, can I?
- No.

622
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,201
It's all cod.

623
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:54,082
We're going to make a report now
and report a crime.

624
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,648
You'll get a fine
equal to the value of the catch.

625
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:03,244
You might risk having
your license withdrawn for some time.

626
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:07,286
We're taking the fish
to sort and weigh them.

627
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:11,246
You're welcome to watch.

628
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,081
We can press charges against you -

629
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,090
- but you have
the right to remain silent.

630
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,408
You'll receive a letter ...

631
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,523
Hello!

632
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:33,009
- You should get that looked at.
- Yes.

633
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,965
Push your thumb up.

634
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:39,084
- Good. Does this feel normal?
- Yes.

635
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,966
And here? You can feel that? Good.

636
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:25,644
Give me two more. Of the shots.

637
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,963
No! The shots.

638
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,247
You're ugly.

639
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,361
Damn ugly.

640
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:10,248
- Jesus Christ, Kesse.
- Leave!

641
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:14,081
I didn't mean to. Sorry, damn it.

642
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:19,411
Don't be like that.
I didn't do it on purpose.

643
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,528
Jesus.

644
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,886
What the hell are you looking at?
Huh?

645
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:03,007
- We're looking at you.
- You're so busy.

646
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:06,488
- So are you.
- Just say it to my face.

647
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,122
- Go home and sleep it off.
- You gossiping bitches.

648
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:16,606
- Calm down and drink your beer.
- Do you want to say something?

649
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:22,250
Just say it to my face.
Don't sit there and gossip.

650
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:26,525
- Kesse, listen to me. Look at me.
- You're asking for it.

651
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:30,725
- We don't want this here.
- You had this coming!

652
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:34,242
- Pretending to be such a damn saint!
- Let me ...

653
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,483
Get out now! This way!

654
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,808
Get up.

655
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:42,486
Let's go. Come on.

656
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:47,846
Get out.
That's it. Get out of here.

657
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,644
Kesse? What the hell happened?

658
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,208
- Nothing.
- You need to put ice on that.

659
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:13,485
- Huh?
- Ice! It looks horrible.

660
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:18,641
There you go. Come over here.

661
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:22,561
Come here. Is that good?

662
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:25,081
I have nothing left, Pia.

663
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:29,080
- That's not true.
- I don't.

664
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:31,368
- Not a damn thing.
- Not true.

665
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,291
- It's not true.
- Yes, it is.

666
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,689
- I have nothing.
- Come here.

667
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,768
Come here, Kesse.

668
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,771
Come here.

669
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,850
Come on. Come on.

670
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,126
Yes.

671
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,288
Wait.

672
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:13,010
Yes. That's it.

673
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:18,565
- No, this is no good.
- Yes, Kesse. You ...

674
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:22,845
- Come here, Kesse.
- No, it's no good, Pia.

675
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,083
- Yes, it is.
- I have to get home.

676
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:30,683
- No, don't. Stay here.
- No. Stop it, damn it!

677
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:36,683
You ... Kesse! Kesse!

678
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,450
<i>Open the door!
I know you're in there!</i>

679
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:02,610
<i>Kesse, damn it!</i>

680
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:15,362
You might want to find
a new spot for the spare key.

681
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,767
Oh yeah?

682
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,451
You've really been at it.

683
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,728
You look like shit.

684
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:31,005
Huh?
You're not a pretty sight yourself.

685
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:35,529
- No.
- Here. A souvenir from paradise.

686
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:41,642
- Thanks.
- Let's go. Get up, damn it.

687
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:46,243
My license is withdrawn for 3 months
and I got a huge fine.

688
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:50,610
The bank will take all of it.
The house and the car.

689
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,122
- Then it's really bad.
- Damn right.

690
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,370
She should stay
away from the docks.

691
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:04,487
I was just stupid. Stupid and naive.

692
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,131
I'll never fish again.

693
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,967
Can you ask if there are any jobs
at the fish factory?

694
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:28,291
Sure. Sure.

695
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:31,330
We have a uniform, you have to wear.

696
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:36,287
And to make sure,
that you're always clean and tidy -

697
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:40,121
- you'll get 11 work suits.

698
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:09,890
Today you'll be at the station
where they cut the heads off.

699
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:17,447
This is after that station.
The ladies here are filleting.

700
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,321
Your job is at the next station.

701
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,810
This is our new employee.

702
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,122
- Kristian.
- I'm Keld.

703
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:40,484
- Do you want to learn this?
- I might as well.

704
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:44,850
This chops the head off.
You push here and here.

705
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:18,007
Kesse!

706
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:22,161
What's up?

707
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:27,286
I just wanted to check in on you.

708
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,807
I'm not talking. Don't worry.

709
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,086
- Who tipped the inspectors?
- I have no idea.

710
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:41,084
I'll find out who it was.
Someone owes me a wee favor.

711
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:44,682
It doesn't matter anymore.

712
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:56,641
- We had a good business going.
- What do you want?

713
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,925
I'll pay that fine.

714
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:07,245
When you get your license back
we'll slowly settle the account.

715
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:12,651
You'll get your boat and quotas back.
Everything will be as before.

716
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,963
I think you need to go now.

717
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:24,286
- Think about it.
- I've thought about it.

718
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:27,091
Think about it.

719
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:30,323
I've thought about it.

720
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,807
Goodbye, Carsten.

721
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:50,604
What's up? Are you coming
to fisherman's swim tonight?

722
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:57,160
- Why? I'm not a fisherman anymore.
- Stop that. Neither am I.

723
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,887
Did you hear about Lars?
He got beat up.

724
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:04,482
- That wouldn't be a first.
- No, a proper beating.

725
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,881
Some say it was hired goons.

726
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,964
- What the hell did he do?
- I don't know.

727
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:17,366
I met Inga at the supermarket.
She was shook up and crying.

728
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:21,121
Hey! Where are you going? Kesse!

729
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:29,169
Did you tip the inspection? Huh?

730
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:35,887
Did you?
Do you even know what you did?!

731
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:40,529
- You had it coming!
- Did I? Did I really?

732
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:45,044
Kesse! Leave him alone.

733
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:07,489
- So ...
- Take care.

734
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:10,160
Thanks.

735
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:23,604
- Put it down for a second.
- Just step down.

736
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,768
- No.
- You're a wimp.

737
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:29,282
Go on.

738
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,806
Hello, Pia. Just the usual.

739
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:53,409
- Hello.
- Hi.

740
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:57,611
- It's been a while.
- Yes.

741
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:03,568
- Are you doing okay?
- Just fine.

742
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:07,486
I'm working at the fish factory.
I get benefits and all.

743
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:11,924
So that's all good.

744
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,686
- What about you?
- Fine.

745
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:21,881
- How did the project go?
- Good. It's done.

746
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:26,409
- Well, congratulations then.
- Thanks.

747
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,365
- I'm going back to Copenhagen.
- Oh.

748
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:36,127
- When are you leaving?
- At 4 o'clock.

749
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,642
- Today?
- Yes.

750
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:51,045
- Bye, Kesse.
- Bye. Do you need a ride?

751
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,971
- What?
- How will you get to the airport?

752
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:57,369
I can borrow Sorte's car
and take you there.

753
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:02,765
- I'm taking the train.
- Oh, okay.

754
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,521
Then it's ...

755
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:12,482
- Bye.
- Bye.

756
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,726
- At least we got rid of her.
- Huh?

757
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:30,324
It's not that I just think,
