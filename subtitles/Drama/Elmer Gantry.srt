1
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,405
(laughter)

2
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,653
So, anyway... anyway,
this guy comes home, you see,

3
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,162
and he finds his wife with his best friend.

4
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:52,377
And the husband says
"Harry, how could you do this?"

5
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:57,665
And the wife, she says "Why should you
complain? Harry didn't do it to you!"

6
00:03:01,096 --> 00:03:05,011
- What did I tell you? Isn't he a card?
- Class. Real class.

7
00:03:05,142 --> 00:03:07,633
With his gift of the gab
he could go places.

8
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,605
Hey, pal, you oughta quit
that punk job of yours.

9
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:14,229
- Why don't you join a sales outfit?
- It's no use, boys.

10
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:18,570
Every time I'm in town, I ask him to go
on the road for our company. Right, pal?

11
00:03:18,696 --> 00:03:21,733
Sure, Ed, sure. Listen, fellas, listen.

12
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:26,611
Two dames at a bar. One dame says to
another "If I don't get to bed pretty soon,

13
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:29,616
I'm goin' home and go to sleep!"

14
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,747
Would you make it a merry Christmas
for some poor orphan?

15
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,077
Here you are, lady.

16
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:38,586
That oughtn't to be allowed
in a place like this.

17
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:42,216
- Religion don't belong in a speakeasy.
- I know it's Christmas, but...

18
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:45,880
Mac, wait a minute. Excuse me,
Sister. Excuse me. Excuse me.

19
00:03:46,015 --> 00:03:48,553
Don't tell me we're gonna let
these angels of mercy

20
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:51,436
go away from here
empty-handed on Christmas Eve.

21
00:03:51,562 --> 00:03:54,398
This joint is the home
of fine bourbon and fast women,

22
00:03:54,524 --> 00:03:57,940
and we need plenty of religion
to keep 'em both in line. So, come on.

23
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:03,194
Get it up, now. Come on. Oh, come on.
A little action here. What's the matter?

24
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:07,112
Oh.

25
00:04:09,372 --> 00:04:11,281
Hey!

26
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,785
Hey, Lord? Can you hear me
up there, Jesus?

27
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,706
You didn't think we'd forget
your birthday, did you?

28
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,501
There you are, Jesus. And if I had
any more, you'd be welcome to it.

29
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:26,216
- Thank you, brother.
- (laughter)

30
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:31,342
The Bible says "Never let your left hand
know what your right hand is doing. "

31
00:04:31,477 --> 00:04:35,557
What's your beef, mister?
You ashamed of bein' a Christian?

32
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,518
I see. You think religion is for suckers
and easy marks and mollycoddles, huh?

33
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:43,690
You think Jesus was some kind
of a sissy, eh? Let me tell you,

34
00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:47,772
Jesus wouldn't be afraid to walk in here
or any speakeasy to preach the gospel.

35
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:52,322
Jesus had guts! He wasn't afraid
of the whole Roman army.

36
00:04:52,456 --> 00:04:55,741
Think that quarterback's
hot stuff? Well, let me tell you,

37
00:04:55,876 --> 00:05:00,372
Jesus would have made the best little
all-American quarterback in history.

38
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:06,010
Jesus was a real fighter. The best little
scrapper, pound for pound, you ever saw.

39
00:05:06,136 --> 00:05:09,386
And why, gentlemen? Love, gentlemen.

40
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:13,464
Jesus had love in both fists.
And what is love?

41
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:20,140
Love is the mornin' and the evenin' star
that shines on the cradle of the babe.

42
00:05:20,274 --> 00:05:22,599
Hey, sinners!

43
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:26,649
Love is the inspiration
of poets and philosophers.

44
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:31,399
Love is the voice of music.

45
00:05:31,535 --> 00:05:36,078
I'm talkin' about divine love,
not carnal love.

46
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:39,741
- That was a beautiful sermon, Parson.
- (laughter)

47
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:41,751
- Beautiful.
- Thank you, sister.

48
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,999
- I gotta get home to the little woman.
- Here you are, Sister.

49
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:48,466
Merry Christmas. Thank the Lord,
Sister. Thank the Lord.

50
00:05:48,594 --> 00:05:50,919
- Gotta go. Gotta catch a rattler.
- Me too.

51
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:54,922
Time to take up a little female
companionship. Wait a minute.

52
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:57,467
That's a swell preacher act you got, pal.

53
00:05:57,603 --> 00:06:02,680
I gotta catch a rattler myself. Ed,
we still got the whole night ahead of us.

54
00:06:02,817 --> 00:06:06,649
Whatever you do, never lose
that little black address book.

55
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,818
Merry Christmas!

56
00:06:10,032 --> 00:06:11,443
Mr. Gantry?

57
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:18,789
And a merry Christmas to you too, sir.

58
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,951
You'll have to chalk it up.
The rest of these drinks, too.

59
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:23,745
Charity.

60
00:06:23,878 --> 00:06:26,666
I oughta get myself a tambourine.

61
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:31,043
That's the trouble with this stinking world.

62
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:33,419
Nobody loves nobody.

63
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:38,057
Mac... the lady's glass is empty.

64
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:48,941
(phone rings)

65
00:06:52,824 --> 00:06:54,864
(knocking at door)

66
00:06:59,164 --> 00:07:00,788
(groans)

67
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:06,836
OK.

68
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:13,802
- Long-distance phone call.
- What time is it?

69
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:16,466
The phone call you made
to Mrs. Gantry last night?

70
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:18,389
Oh. Yeah, thanks.

71
00:07:18,516 --> 00:07:21,885
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Gantry.
- You too.

72
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,890
And a happy New Year, Mr. Gantry.

73
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:32,852
Well, I'll take...
I'll take care of you downstairs.

74
00:07:32,989 --> 00:07:35,658
Get my bags out now.

75
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:44,538
Hello? Hello?

76
00:07:57,513 --> 00:07:59,919
(woman) Ready with your call, Mr. Gantry

77
00:08:00,056 --> 00:08:03,591
Hello? Oh, hello, Mom. Merry Christmas.

78
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:06,300
Me, Elm!

79
00:08:06,437 --> 00:08:08,644
Just a sec, Mom.

80
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,810
I just got back from church myself.

81
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:18,105
I prayed for you too.

82
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:20,483
How'd you like my present?

83
00:08:20,618 --> 00:08:22,658
You sure? Gee, that's funny.

84
00:08:22,787 --> 00:08:25,456
Well, maybe it got held up
in the holiday rush.

85
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:30,742
I just called up to wish you merry
Christmas, that's all, to tell you I love you.

86
00:08:32,672 --> 00:08:34,878
Don't start crying.

87
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:36,751
Ma...

88
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:42,175
I know I promised, but I couldn't get away.
I've been busy. Yeah, business.

89
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:47,383
Guaranteed and delivered. I'll be home
next Easter. My absolute promise.

90
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,560
Ma, don't cry.

91
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:59,312
Ma, I gotta go. I really gotta go, Ma.
I gotta catch a train.

92
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:02,734
Sure. Sure. I'll talk to you. Take care.

93
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:04,493
Bye.

94
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:01,380

95
00:10:12,104 --> 00:10:14,143

- You'd better get at this while it's still hot.
- Thank you, brother.

146
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:20,256
Would you look at this filthy magazine,
Reverend? Shameful. Shameful.

147
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:25,051
Burn, ye naked Jezebel, burn.
Like a blindin' flash.

"Suddenly there shined round
about him a light from heaven,

- "Saul. Saul. "

Excuse me, but you sound
like a preacher.

- If you'll be needing a place to sleep...

I haul these ashes, I'll be on my way.

- Well, God be with you, brother.
- Put in a good word for me, brother.

158
00:15:05,892 --> 00:15:08,181
- Back again, Mr. Gantry?
- Yes, indeed.

159
00:15:08,311 --> 00:15:11,182
Come spring, come the drummer man.

160
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:16,273
Good morning, good morning,
good morning - and a hot morning it is.

161
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:19,736
Sam, as the blind man said
to the elephant, long time no see.

162
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:21,573
Last March.

163
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,033
I got a great new item for you -
an electric toaster that pops.

164
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:27,320
- No.
- An egg beater that's a lulu.

165
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:29,495
No sale.

166
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:33,868
This little devil's
gonna clean up America.

167
00:15:34,004 --> 00:15:36,709
You sold me nine of them
vacuum cleaners last year.

168
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,675
There they are, all nine of 'em.

169
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:43,502
Well, no harm done. How about
a free snort on the house?

170
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:47,767
(laughs) That's how you
stuck me the last time.

171
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:54,022
Ever hear the one about the missionary,
the cannibal and the chorus girl?

172
00:15:54,148 --> 00:15:57,599
This Sister Sharon -
she any good at preachin'?

173
00:15:57,735 --> 00:16:00,984
I don't know. I don't go
to prayer meetings. I mean...

174
00:16:01,112 --> 00:16:05,573
unless business is bad
or I get sick. Times like that.

175
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,240
Say, how about the missionary and
the cannibals and the chorus girl, hm?

176
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:17,248
There she was in the wildest jungles
of Borneo, without a stitch on,

177
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:20,463
except her dancin' shoes
and her pith helmet.

178
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:29,555
Can I speak to Mrs. Wilson,
please? Thank you.

179
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,222
Hello? Hello, Sally?
Me. Elmer. Who do you think?

180
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:42,057
Swell, just swell. How's every
little thing with you, honey?

181
00:16:42,195 --> 00:16:44,864
- Baby, I just got into town.
- (knocking at door)

182
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,659
Hold it a sec, Sal. Come in.

183
00:16:48,827 --> 00:16:52,243
- How did we do?
- Ran out of the money in both races.

184
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:57,495
Sally? How about tonight, baby?

185
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:01,506
What time does your husband get home?

186
00:17:02,507 --> 00:17:05,259
But, honey, I won't be here tomorrow.

187
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:09,513
Well, look, can you come over
for an hour? A half an hour, huh?

188
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:12,179
Oh.

189
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:14,597
Sure, Sal. Sure I understand.

190
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:19,722
Think nothin' of it, honey. I'll catch
you next time around. Bye, now.

191
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:21,560
- Did you get the bottle?
- Nah.

192
00:17:21,693 --> 00:17:24,943
You know bootleggers.
They do a cash business.

193
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:30,151
- Toss you. Double or nothin'.
- No. You're too lucky, Mr. Gantry.

194
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:33,653
- Thank you. Anything else I can do?
- Thanks, kid.

195
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:45,335
(woman)? Just now,
your doubting give o'er

196
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:51,718
# Just now, reject Him no more

197
00:17:52,556 --> 00:17:59,934
# Just now, throw open the door

198
00:18:00,272 --> 00:18:08,018
# Let Jesus come into your heart

199
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:12,864
# Lay we every burden down

200
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:17,157
# Grace our spirits will deliver

201
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:22,117
# And provide a robe and crown

202
00:18:22,795 --> 00:18:27,255
# Yes, we'll gather at the river

203
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:32,336
# The beautiful, the beautiful river

204
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,092
# Gather with the saints at the river

205
00:18:37,226 --> 00:18:42,385
# That flows by the throne of God

206
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:47,392
# Yes, we'll gather at the river

207
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:52,521
# The beautiful, the beautiful river

208
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:56,986
# Gather with the saints at the river

209
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,324
# That flows by the throne of God

210
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,752
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

211
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:14,256
Welcome to the house of God.

212
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,425
(fanfare)

213
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:22,801
# Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord

214
00:19:22,936 --> 00:19:27,598
# He is trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored

215
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:32,026
# He hath loosed the fateful lightning
of His terrible swift sword

216
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:37,611
# His truth is marching on

217
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,657
# Glory, glory, hallelujah!

218
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:46,791
# Glory, glory, hallelujah!

219
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,255
# Glory, glory, hallelujah!

220
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:56,589
# His truth is marching on

221
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,346
# Glory, glory, hallelujah!

222
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,432
# Glory, glory, hallelujah!

223
00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:10,179
# Glory, glory, hallelujah!

224
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:17,363
# His truth is marching on

225
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:32,665
Oh, my dear, beautiful people.

226
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,747
When I arrived here and I saw
your gracious countryside,

227
00:20:36,885 --> 00:20:40,798
I said to myself "I won't.
I just won't be cooped up

228
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,473
with a lot of stodgy old ministers
discussing hell and damnation!"

229
00:20:50,189 --> 00:20:52,478
So I sneaked out,

230
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:57,899
and I've been doing what most
of you have been doing - farming.

231
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,700
Milking the cows, lying in the clover,

232
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:06,067
and letting the joy of God's nature
flow into my heart.

233
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,500
And here's the proof
there's a happy, joyful God,

234
00:21:12,628 --> 00:21:15,748
a bountiful God, a generous God.

235
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,173
Milk!

236
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:25,052
Here, Reverend. The Lord's nectar.

237
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:28,266
And pass it along to those
dear newspaper reporters

238
00:21:28,393 --> 00:21:31,643
so they can wash out the taste of whisky.

239
00:21:36,026 --> 00:21:37,224
Tonight...

240
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,318
tonight I feel gloriously happy,
and I want you to feel happy too.

241
00:21:42,449 --> 00:21:45,865
We're gonna sing together,
laugh together, rejoice together

242
00:21:45,994 --> 00:21:48,401
like carefree children of a happy God.

243
00:21:48,705 --> 00:21:52,916
We're going to rejoice that inside
of us lives the veritable spirit

244
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:56,043
of the everlasting
redeeming Christ, Jesus.

245
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:58,744
- Hallelujah!
- Praise the Lord!

246
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,182
Bill, see how many of those dear people
can match God's bountiful gift

247
00:22:08,308 --> 00:22:09,885
with their own offerings.

248
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:14,644
You darlings can't make milk,
and God just won't make money.

249
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:19,561
# Stand up, stand up for Jesus

250
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,107
# Ye soldiers of the cross

251
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:28,189
# Lift high His royal banner

252
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:30,699
No preaching tonight. No sermonising.

253
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:34,115
No sad faces or tears, just happiness.

254
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,865
Tomorrow...

255
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:38,788
tomorrow is the last night
of our revival here,

256
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:41,791
but when I leave,
you're going to carry on my work.

257
00:22:41,924 --> 00:22:45,672
You're all of you evangelists,
every blessed one of you.

258
00:22:45,803 --> 00:22:50,097
Shake hands with the person on your
right. Go on! Ask them if they're saved.

259
00:22:50,224 --> 00:22:52,382
Won't you shake hands for Jesus?

260
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:55,851
Bless you, brother.
Sing, everybody! Sing his praises!

261
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,348
- Sister Falconer!
- Won't you find happiness in Jesus?

262
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:02,852
It's happiness to hear your wondrous
message. Can I have a moment?

263
00:23:02,987 --> 00:23:05,656
Excuse me, please. Excuse me.

264
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:08,857
- Excuse me, please.
- Thank you, brother.

265
00:23:08,993 --> 00:23:12,907
Oh, uh, yes... Sorry. No change.

266
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:15,078
Thank you.

267
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,339
(car horn)

268
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,473
I picked some flowers for you.

269
00:23:35,602 --> 00:23:39,600
Sister, my son saw the Virgin Mother
on the roof last night after your sermon.

270
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:41,356
Can you spare me an hour?

271
00:23:41,483 --> 00:23:45,351
I simply can't. Aren't our counsellors
taking care of you? Sister Rachel?

272
00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:49,651
Sister Rachel, see what you can do. Every
one of these lovely people is important.

273
00:23:49,783 --> 00:23:53,531
- May I have your names, please?
- I must congratulate you again.

274
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:55,203
- Thank you.
- I'm a preacher.

275
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,080
- I know how inspired you must've been.
- What church?

276
00:23:58,206 --> 00:24:01,955
What church? Well, uh, at present,
I don't exactly have a church, but...

277
00:24:02,085 --> 00:24:04,659
What is it this time, brother?
Booze or women?

278
00:24:04,796 --> 00:24:07,287
Why, Sister Falconer. Me?

279
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:10,581
Whichever one it is,
you have my blessing. Jim?

280
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:13,636
- Uh, Sister, I, uh...
- Nice try, brother.

281
00:24:20,646 --> 00:24:23,812
- Will prayer cure diabetes?
- Would you give me your address?

282
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,898
- Sister?
- Just a moment.

283
00:24:26,026 --> 00:24:28,184
- What denomination?
- I must talk to you.

284
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,318
- If you'll just leave your name.
- I have an important message for you.

285
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:34,655
A message? From Sister Falconer?

286
00:24:34,785 --> 00:24:37,110
- I heard you sing last night.
- Oh?

287
00:24:37,245 --> 00:24:40,412
I know flattery don't mean much
to a talented person like you,

288
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,458
but when you sang that
inspiring song "Beulah Land",

289
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:46,123
it made me realise that music
is the voice of love.

290
00:24:46,254 --> 00:24:48,745
- Oh.
- And what is love?

291
00:24:48,882 --> 00:24:51,634
Love is the morning and the evening star.

292
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,844
America. A land of great opportunity.

293
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:58,423
Take me. I've been with the Central
States Appliance Company a year.

294
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,936
I'm their crack salesman already. They
wanna make me a partner. It's a great life.

295
00:25:03,063 --> 00:25:08,270
Folks in 14 states know me by my
first name. Makes a fella feel humble.

296
00:25:08,402 --> 00:25:12,351
- Would you like to start with a cocktail?
- A cocktail in the middle of the day?

297
00:25:12,489 --> 00:25:17,032
Don't you know that drinkin' is sinful
and against the principles of Coolidge?

298
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,441
I meant shrimp cocktail.

299
00:25:18,578 --> 00:25:21,366
Just bring us some of
Mother's apple pie and coffee.

300
00:25:21,498 --> 00:25:22,873
Yes, sir.

301
00:25:24,209 --> 00:25:26,201
I'm sorry.

302
00:25:27,294 --> 00:25:31,126
Tell me, when did you
first start servin' God?

303
00:25:31,257 --> 00:25:36,215
Two years ago. In Cato, Missouri. Sister
Sharon's gospel singer got hurt in a riot.

304
00:25:36,345 --> 00:25:39,880
A riot? In a Christian town like...
What was the name?

305
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:41,261
Cato.

306
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:45,805
Cato, Missouri. Yes, some roughnecks
started yellin' and screamin' and hollerin'.

307
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:47,349
During the services?

308
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:52,724
Sister Sharon yelled to a farmer on our
side "Hit him one for the Lord, brother!"

309
00:25:52,862 --> 00:25:55,982
Apple pie. They ought to write
a song about apple pie.

310
00:25:56,115 --> 00:25:58,784
A gospel song. And you should sing it.

311
00:26:22,808 --> 00:26:24,931
(whistle blows)

312
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:27,302
(conductor) All aboard!

313
00:26:37,698 --> 00:26:40,947
- Godspeed the good work, Sister!
- Good luck, Sister Sharon!

314
00:26:41,076 --> 00:26:43,946
Godspeed, Sister Sharon! Good luck!

315
00:26:59,302 --> 00:27:01,045
Shara?

316
00:27:01,178 --> 00:27:05,507
Our advance man in Lincoln, Nebraska,
got drunk, and he's disappeared.

317
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:08,262
No more business tonight.

318
00:27:10,437 --> 00:27:14,731
- Thank heavens. When I didn't see you...
- Thinkin' about you every second.

319
00:27:14,858 --> 00:27:18,726
The fire department in Lincoln say
that we can't put up a tent our size.

320
00:27:18,862 --> 00:27:22,563
- The church committee are bickering...
- Please, Bill.

321
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:25,984
The gentleman with Sister Falconer.

322
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,780
- Mr. Morgan?
- Yes.

323
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:32,207
Tell him Mr. Lefferts would like to see him
out back on the observation platform.

324
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:34,374
Thank you, sir.

325
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,851
Mr. Lefferts? My name is Gantry.

326
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:58,650
Congratulations.

327
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,447
- Sorry I woke you up.
- Then why did you do it?

328
00:28:01,572 --> 00:28:03,399
Oh, I recognised you.

329
00:28:03,532 --> 00:28:07,316
I had to congratulate you on those
articles you wrote about evolution.

330
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,534
Not only scarifyin' and sensational,
but very funny.

331
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:18,083
Tell me somethin', Jim boy. I know
you got one of them Pulitzer prizes,

332
00:28:18,213 --> 00:28:21,962
but you don't really believe in
all that evolution junk, now do you?

333
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:25,093
- Devoutly.
- Then you must believe

334
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,633
- that God himself is a gorilla.
- How did you arrive at that conclusion?

335
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:33,467
It says in the Bible
"God created man in his own image. "

336
00:28:45,615 --> 00:28:48,865
Sister Sharon -
she's pretty important news, eh?

337
00:28:49,744 --> 00:28:52,116
What's your interest in her?

338
00:28:54,374 --> 00:28:56,746
- Can I be frank with you?
- Try.

339
00:28:57,126 --> 00:29:00,994
- She fascinates me.
- You'll have to get in line.

340
00:29:01,297 --> 00:29:05,461
You also have to get over
a hurdle first, name of Bill Morgan.

341
00:29:05,593 --> 00:29:10,054
Say, I almost forgot. He's comin' out
to see you, right about now.

342
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,802
He's got some secret information.

343
00:29:18,814 --> 00:29:21,435
Thanks a lot, Jim boy. Thanks a lot.

344
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:32,535
- You all right?
- Yes, fine. I was just wondering...

345
00:29:32,661 --> 00:29:34,903
Later, honey.

346
00:29:49,386 --> 00:29:51,711
I'm sorry, this seat is taken.

347
00:29:51,847 --> 00:29:54,254
Even the Lord never turned
his back on a sinner.

348
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:58,258
I am not the Lord, but I am tired.
Now, will you please go away?

349
00:30:00,897 --> 00:30:05,773
You weren't so tired and all of life
two years ago in Cato, Missouri.

350
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:09,729
- That's where we met.
- Met?

351
00:30:09,865 --> 00:30:13,030
Yes. On a Friday night, it was.
Remember? Remember the riot?

352
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:17,619
Some roughnecks got to whoopin'
and hollerin' and fightin', and you yelled

353
00:30:17,747 --> 00:30:20,368
- "Hit him one for the Lord!"
- That's what I said.

354
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:24,283
And that's exactly what I did.
I busted him one for the Lord.

355
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,172
Oh, it was a lovely fight!

356
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:35,221
When I saw you in Cato, I thought I was
seein' an angel, and you haven't changed.

357
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:38,218
- A very tired angel.
- It's no wonder,

358
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:42,598
givin' everybody else hope and courage,
nobody to lean on yourself.

359
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:46,229
I suppose this is a generous offer
to let me lean on you.

360
00:30:47,568 --> 00:30:50,569
I wouldn't have the nerve, Sister.

361
00:30:50,696 --> 00:30:52,238
- Yesterday, Mr...
- Gantry.

362
00:30:52,365 --> 00:30:54,404
. . you said you were a preacher.

363
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:59,409
Well, uh, practically, yes. Uh, you see,
the semester I was to be ordained...

364
00:30:59,538 --> 00:31:02,112
They kicked you out of college.

365
00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:05,665
Well, it was a... a tragedy, kind of.

366
00:31:05,795 --> 00:31:07,834
A girl.

367
00:31:08,756 --> 00:31:10,464
Yeah. A girl.

368
00:31:12,468 --> 00:31:13,927
A girl named Lulu Bains.

369
00:31:14,053 --> 00:31:17,801
- Does she work for you, or you for her?
- We work together.

370
00:31:17,932 --> 00:31:22,973
Would it be unethical to ask just what
you'll write about Sister Sharon?

371
00:31:23,104 --> 00:31:25,227
- It would.
- Oh?

372
00:31:25,356 --> 00:31:28,025
- I'm sorry.
- She's brilliant.

373
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,523
"Inspired" is a more appropriate word.

374
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:34,188
- It means "touched by the hand of God".
- Precisely.

375
00:31:34,323 --> 00:31:36,530
Now, get the picture.

376
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:41,202
It's Christmas Eve. God's pure snow
driftin' down, and joy in the air.

377
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:45,494
I enter the Schoenheim church
late at night to pray for guidance.

378
00:31:45,626 --> 00:31:48,662
And what do I find, right behind the altar?

379
00:31:48,795 --> 00:31:51,915
Lulu Bains, my betrothed, my bride-to-be,

380
00:31:52,048 --> 00:31:57,421
half-naked, locked in the arms of
her lover, a cardsharp from Chicago.

381
00:31:58,512 --> 00:32:03,139
A couple of years later he was bumped
off in a gang war, God rest his soul.

382
00:32:03,267 --> 00:32:06,683
Well, that's it, I guess.
I lost all interest in religion.

383
00:32:06,812 --> 00:32:09,303
But when I saw you,
it was like a call from beyond.

384
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,812
Could I see you again?
Have breakfast with me?

385
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:15,311
What's your hotel room number
in Lincoln, hm? Tell me.

386
00:32:15,446 --> 00:32:21,282
You're so completely... so outrageous.
I... I think I like you.

387
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:24,364
I guess I've been around
sanctimonious folks too long.

388
00:32:24,496 --> 00:32:27,865
You're amusing,
and you smell like a real man.

389
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,412
Yes, I'll meet you by my tent.
That's where I breakfast. Good night.

390
00:32:33,547 --> 00:32:36,382
- Oh, but, Sister...
- Oh, this time I mean it.

391
00:32:38,052 --> 00:32:40,091
Pleasant dreams.

392
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:49,977
Evening, Brother Morgan. Oh, I wouldn't
bother her now. She's resting, poor child.

393
00:32:56,612 --> 00:33:02,531
The wind will come from there, so keep
the centre poles where you've got them.

394
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,111
That way the canvas won't snap
and crackle all through the sermon.

395
00:33:06,246 --> 00:33:08,286
Here they come.

396
00:33:10,376 --> 00:33:13,211
Morning, Sister! Jim boy!
A lovely morning it is.

397
00:33:13,337 --> 00:33:15,543
- Good morning.
- I woke with a terrific idea.

398
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:17,630
Later. Good morning, Captain.

399
00:33:17,758 --> 00:33:21,008
- You can't erect that tent here, ma'am.
- Why not?

400
00:33:21,136 --> 00:33:23,093
- Fire laws.
- Nonsense.

401
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:25,593
No, ma'am. No nonsense
at all. No, ma'am.

402
00:33:25,723 --> 00:33:28,558
"Ma'am" is a contraction for "madam".
I am not a madam,

403
00:33:28,685 --> 00:33:32,184
a calibre of woman I'm sure you
know well and do business with.

404
00:33:32,313 --> 00:33:34,887
How many have been put out
of business by fire laws?

405
00:33:35,024 --> 00:33:38,892
- Your tent holds over 1,000 people...
- Captain, this is Mr. Lefferts,

406
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:43,322
- a reporter for the Zenith Times-DisPatch
- Zenith? Welcome. This is Fire Chief...

407
00:33:43,449 --> 00:33:47,198
Isn't it a fact, Mr. Lefferts, that the whisky
big shots want me closed down?

408
00:33:47,328 --> 00:33:50,365
They certainly don't think
you do their business any good.

409
00:33:50,498 --> 00:33:55,409
Know why? I'm not afraid to fight whisky
and repeal with police help or without it.

410
00:33:55,545 --> 00:33:59,377
- If you're accusing me of not...
- I am. Do you enforce prohibition?

411
00:33:59,507 --> 00:34:00,752
I certainly do.

412
00:34:00,883 --> 00:34:04,299
How many speakeasies could you
take the captain to in his home town?

413
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:08,094
- Without a membership card? 50.
- (Sharon) Fire laws!

414
00:34:08,224 --> 00:34:10,549
Do you see any of my workmen smoking?

415
00:34:10,685 --> 00:34:13,176
Do you mind? This might start a fire.

416
00:34:13,313 --> 00:34:16,847
- If they don't smoke inside...
- You're welcome to see tonight.

417
00:34:16,983 --> 00:34:20,399
A little bit of salvation
will do you both some good.

418
00:34:22,447 --> 00:34:27,358
Sister Sharon! Never did I ever see
anybody handle the cops the way you did.

419
00:34:27,493 --> 00:34:30,993
All right. What's this terrific idea
you woke up with?

420
00:34:31,122 --> 00:34:35,535
Yes, well... How would it be if I addressed
your meetin' as a saved businessman?

421
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:39,001
I could talk on the hard,
practical dollars-and-cents value

422
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:42,046
of Christ in commerce.

423
00:34:42,174 --> 00:34:44,416
Tom, slacken off that rope. It's too tight.

424
00:34:44,551 --> 00:34:47,422
By the way, what is
your business? Hold-ups?

425
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:50,175
You're a card. I sell
for Central Appliances.

426
00:34:50,307 --> 00:34:53,723
- Don't you like your job?
- Why, sure. It's a great life.

427
00:34:53,852 --> 00:34:58,098
I'm their crack salesman. Only last month
they wanted to make me a junior partner.

428
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:03,272
Would you believe that people in 14 states
call me by my first name? Elmer.

429
00:35:06,989 --> 00:35:10,654
No use kiddin' you, is there?
It's no life at all.

430
00:35:10,785 --> 00:35:14,118
Filthy, dreary hotel rooms.
Always chasin' trains.

431
00:35:15,373 --> 00:35:19,869
Always tellin' dirty stories
to keep the buyers laughin'.

432
00:35:20,002 --> 00:35:23,371
Always the pint bottle
to prove you're a sport.

433
00:35:23,506 --> 00:35:28,547
That kind of fella's no success at all.
He's just a tramp in a silk shirt.

434
00:35:28,678 --> 00:35:30,302
Well...

435
00:35:33,724 --> 00:35:38,517
I could tell the sinners
I'm a... I'm a salesman, just like that.

436
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:43,438
I come into one of them...
miserable hotel rooms.

437
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:47,232
I'm discouraged.
I got no sales to chalk up.

438
00:35:47,363 --> 00:35:50,150
Nothin' to read. I'm lonely.

439
00:35:50,783 --> 00:35:55,943
I'm just dyin' for a drink. Some of them
salesmen drink somethin' terrible.

440
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:01,075
And I reach my hand into
a dresser drawer... and what do I find?

441
00:36:02,169 --> 00:36:05,040
A Gideon Bible. That's what I find.

442
00:36:05,172 --> 00:36:07,842
Yes. Yes, go on.

443
00:36:09,051 --> 00:36:14,638
I reached my hand into a dresser drawer,
and I found a Gideon Bible.

444
00:36:14,765 --> 00:36:15,797
(man) Louder!

445
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:18,424
I found a Gideon Bible.

446
00:36:18,561 --> 00:36:21,930
I was so lonely and miserable,
I might as well have been in hell.

447
00:36:22,064 --> 00:36:25,564
I was in hell. I knew
all the salesman's tricks.

448
00:36:25,693 --> 00:36:28,694
Why wasn't I rich?
Why wasn't I successful?

449
00:36:28,821 --> 00:36:32,439
I opened the Bible,
and I read the 18th Psalm.

450
00:36:33,867 --> 00:36:36,572
"The Lord is my rock and my fortress. "

451
00:36:37,537 --> 00:36:40,573
"The Lord is my fortress. "
Do you hear that? The Lord.

452
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:43,245
- Praise the Lord!
- The Lord is my rock!

453
00:36:43,376 --> 00:36:45,914
The next mornin'
I walked into a general store.

454
00:36:46,046 --> 00:36:49,082
"What are you sellin' today?
Gold-plated vacuum cleaners?"

455
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:52,875
"No, sir. You can get better vacuum
cleaners at Sears and Roebuck,

456
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:57,056
and you can get 'em cheaper, but
you can't beat our electric toasters. "

457
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:59,887
He sat down and wrote me
the biggest order of the year.

458
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:01,346
(man) Hallelujah!

459
00:37:01,811 --> 00:37:05,061
Can you hear me, Lord? Thank you, Lord.

460
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,606
I didn't make that sale, Lord.
You did. Thank you.

461
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:13,986
(man) Hallelujah!

462
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:17,356
And when I told my pals...

463
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:21,621
when I told my pals I was
comin' to Jesus, they laughed.

464
00:37:21,747 --> 00:37:24,285
But Sister Falconer didn't laugh.

465
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:27,203
She said "Go ahead, brother.
Give 'em hell. "

466
00:37:27,336 --> 00:37:29,827
I'm going to give you
all the hell in the Bible,

467
00:37:29,964 --> 00:37:33,878
and if you don't like it, fix it up with
the Lord because the Lord put it there.

468
00:37:34,009 --> 00:37:35,753
Listen to me, sinners.

469
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,843
Listen to me, sinners.

470
00:37:37,972 --> 00:37:42,883
You can't pray to kingdom come
and play bridge or poker. And, Mother,

471
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:46,802
you can't say your psalms and look
at God through the bottom of a beer mug.

472
00:37:46,939 --> 00:37:47,970
And you, brother,

473
00:37:48,107 --> 00:37:52,733
you can't go to church on Sunday
and cheat at business on Monday.

474
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:57,737
We're comin' back to you, God. We're
comin' back to the old-time religion!

475
00:38:01,954 --> 00:38:04,659
And what is religion?

476
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,913
What is religion?

477
00:38:07,042 --> 00:38:09,164
Religion is love.

478
00:38:09,294 --> 00:38:12,129
And love is the morning
and the evening star.

479
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:15,007
Love, the eternal glorious musicmaker.

480
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:18,418
Love! Not the carnal love,
but the divine love.

481
00:38:18,553 --> 00:38:23,345
And where does this great love
come from? It comes direct from God!

482
00:38:27,603 --> 00:38:30,521
I admit I'm not smart like some of them...

483
00:38:30,648 --> 00:38:34,693
some of them smart-alecky professors,
wise-guy writers and agitators.

484
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:38,947
I know nothing of theosophy, philosophy,
psychology, ideology or any other ology.

485
00:38:39,073 --> 00:38:40,781
But I know this.

486
00:38:40,908 --> 00:38:46,069
With Christ, you're saved,
and without him, you're lost.

487
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:48,494
And how do I know
there's a merciful God?

488
00:38:48,624 --> 00:38:51,744
Because I've seen the devil
plenty of times!

489
00:39:06,434 --> 00:39:09,103
Any punk ball player
can make a slide like that.

490
00:39:09,228 --> 00:39:12,763
But how many folks have got the guts
to play ball on God's team?

491
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:18,320
And listen to this. The captain
of that team is Jesus Christ himself.

492
00:39:18,446 --> 00:39:20,486
So, come on, man, woman, child.

493
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:24,066
Who'll be the first
to shake hands for Jesus?

494
00:39:24,702 --> 00:39:26,742
Come on, now! Everyone!

495
00:39:29,957 --> 00:39:34,287
Are you gonna make me beg and beg
when I'm offerin' you my Jesus?

496
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:40,001
Did the Saviour die in vain?
Did he suffer on the cross for nothin'?

497
00:39:40,134 --> 00:39:43,088
Argh! My God, I can't stand it!

498
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,545
Oh, my God, no! Not any more!

499
00:39:45,681 --> 00:39:49,892
Sinner, I'll fight you every day in the week
for God and twice on Sundays!

500
00:39:50,018 --> 00:39:53,352
Help me. Brother Gantry, save me.
I sin every day!

501
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,647
Tell me what to do, please.
Tell me what to do!

502
00:39:57,608 --> 00:40:00,479
- "Lifeline. "
- (band plays and people sing)

503
00:40:01,362 --> 00:40:04,067
# Throw out the lifeline

504
00:40:04,198 --> 00:40:09,655
# Somebody's drifting away

505
00:40:09,787 --> 00:40:12,539
# Throw out the lifeline

506
00:40:12,748 --> 00:40:15,370
# Throw out the lifeline

507
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:19,414
Bless you for bringing us
such a wonderful man.

508
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:22,667
- Sister Sharon.
- Bless you, Brother Gantry.

509
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,928
You've changed my whole life.
You're such a good man.

510
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:38,101
- This light supposed to be kept burnin'?
- Yep.

511
00:40:38,232 --> 00:40:42,693
Sometimes folks come just to touch
where Sister Sharon stands.

512
00:40:43,654 --> 00:40:46,359
Say, I heard you talk tonight.

513
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:50,654
- How'd you like it?
- Mister, I've been converted five times.

514
00:40:50,786 --> 00:40:56,373
Billy Sunday, Reverend Biederwolf, Gypsy
Smith, and twice by Sister Falconer.

515
00:40:57,335 --> 00:41:00,917
I get terrible drunk,
and then I get good and saved.

516
00:41:01,047 --> 00:41:05,755
Both of them done me a powerful lot
of good - gettin' drunk, and gettin' saved.

517
00:41:05,885 --> 00:41:07,924
Well, good night.

518
00:41:23,234 --> 00:41:25,904
Are you praying, or planning to take over?

519
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:27,653
Shara!

520
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,612
Did I do all right?
I mean, did I do all right for you?

521
00:41:31,743 --> 00:41:34,910
Yes, you were fine. Really fine.
I cried like everybody else.

522
00:41:35,038 --> 00:41:37,493
No, but... Tell me the truth, please.

523
00:41:37,624 --> 00:41:41,207
450 converts out of 1200 people?

524
00:41:41,336 --> 00:41:43,874
That's a truth of some kind.

525
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,006
- Morgan thought you were vulgar.
- Do you?

526
00:41:49,135 --> 00:41:50,843
- Think I'm vulgar?
- Yes.

527
00:41:50,971 --> 00:41:52,381
- But you like me.
- Yes.

528
00:41:52,514 --> 00:41:54,756
- Very much.
- Not very much.

529
00:41:56,351 --> 00:41:57,975
Shara.

530
00:42:26,214 --> 00:42:27,412
Forgive me, Sharon.

531
00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:31,381
- You've got me plumb hypnotised.
- No, you're just hungry, that's all.

532
00:42:31,511 --> 00:42:34,512
But I can hypnotise, because
God chose me to do his work.

533
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,963
- Sure, me too.
- No.

534
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:41,393
I chose you. The big difference
between you and me is that I believe.

535
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,560
I really believe.

536
00:42:45,858 --> 00:42:48,479
- You'd like to join us, wouldn't you?
- Oh, yes.

537
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,560
- Report at nine. We'll discuss salaries...
- I got swell ideas for promotions.

538
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:56,445
- Radio, the third ear of the human race...
- You smoke, don't you?

539
00:42:56,576 --> 00:42:59,992
- Well...
- I can smell it. Will you stop it altogether?

540
00:43:00,121 --> 00:43:02,030
- Well, yes...
- The drinking, too?

541
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:05,082
- Oh, sure. If that's what you want, I...
- It is.

542
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:07,249
Good night.

543
00:43:16,763 --> 00:43:19,004
Evening, Brother Gantry.

544
00:43:20,975 --> 00:43:25,518
Jim boy! Say, all the time Shara and me -
uh, Sister Falconer and me...

545
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:28,268
Yep. Sitting right over there.

546
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:33,690
- You're not gonna write about this?
- Boy kisses girl? Hell, that's not news.

547
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:38,033
You're slipping, brother. You know,
when you first hooked me on that train,

548
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:43,664
I thought you were a friendly,
likeable, self-respecting first-class bum.

549
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,622
And now... now look at you.
Where'd you get your style?

550
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:53,625
- Just let her rip, I guess.
- I've heard powerful Bible-wallopers,

551
00:43:53,758 --> 00:43:57,969
but you not only put the fear of God
into them, you scared the hell out of 'em.

552
00:43:58,096 --> 00:44:02,093
And the way you strung certain words
together - "America, home, mother".

553
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:05,641
"Heaven, hell... Love, hate, sin".

554
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:11,226
You know, it's a funny thing, Jim.
I get up here and I... I see them out there.

555
00:44:12,527 --> 00:44:15,943
Next thing you know,
I'm howlin', they're moanin'.

556
00:44:16,072 --> 00:44:18,610
It's like a mighty spirit
movin' inside of me.

557
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:24,495
Words and ideas come pourin' out
like... like riled-up strangers.

558
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:28,916
I feel so powerful and full of love,
I'm about to explode.

559
00:44:29,043 --> 00:44:31,082
I do explode.

560
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:34,960
And then I just about love everybody

561
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:39,250
Especially the girls.

562
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:46,801
Yes, this is where I belong, all right.
Right here, in religion.

563
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:48,975
Even if it is a tent.

564
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:51,677
Every circus needs a clown,
Brother Gantry.

565
00:44:51,815 --> 00:44:57,402
And you might turn out to be the funniest
clown of 'em all. And the most successful.

566
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:00,113
Clown!

567
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:03,322
Jim boy, you're terrific. Terrific.

568
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:13,541
Some of them smart-aleck college
professors are trying to prove

569
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,706
that this here ape is your
great-great-grandfather.

570
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,247
Come back here. Let folks see you.

571
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:23,796
Well, he might be Darwin's uncle,
but he certainly ain't yours or mine.

572
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,969
Right, Grandpop?

573
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,908
Just a monkey, folks. Just a monkey.

574
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,831
Would Jesus play poker?

575
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:53,957
Would St. Paul play the stock market?

576
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:57,785
What do you think will get you
into God's own glorious heaven?

577
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,045
This ace of spades?

578
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,131
Your bank book?

579
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,129
Or this pledge to be a good Christian?

580
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:10,927
Sin, sin, sin.

581
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:15,187
You're all sinners!
You're all doomed to perdition.

582
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:20,478
You're all goin' to
the painful, stinkin', scaldin',

583
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,445
everlastin' tortures of a fiery hell,

584
00:46:23,571 --> 00:46:26,359
created by God for sinners, unless...

585
00:46:27,325 --> 00:46:29,033
unless...

586
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,028
unless you repent!
Repent with Sister Falconer!

587
00:46:33,164 --> 00:46:35,204
(howls)

588
00:46:40,213 --> 00:46:42,585
(barks)

589
00:46:44,175 --> 00:46:46,845
Let that man alone! Let him alone!

590
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:51,095
Go ahead and bark, brother.
Go right ahead and bark!

591
00:46:51,224 --> 00:46:55,222
There he is! The devil!
Bark that devil outta this tent!

592
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,893
(rhythmic clapping)

593
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:18,031
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

594
00:47:23,798 --> 00:47:27,250
(Morgan). . the most disgusting display
of bad taste in my experience.

595
00:47:27,385 --> 00:47:31,134
A human barking dog.
A monkey in the pulpit.

596
00:47:31,264 --> 00:47:34,135
It's preposterous.
That's why it can't go on.

597
00:47:34,267 --> 00:47:39,178
And it's obvious to everyone - even
dangerous. Especially before Jim Lefferts.

598
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:43,013
And our newspaper friend...
He's about as friendly as a rattlesnake.

599
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,934
- Then you think it's wrong.
- Not wrong. Ridiculous.

600
00:47:47,071 --> 00:47:49,941
One minute you're preaching
a happy, perfumed heaven,

601
00:47:50,074 --> 00:47:53,573
the next, Gantry's damning everyone
to a scalding, stinking hell.

602
00:47:53,702 --> 00:47:57,070
- I'd say we make a pretty good team.
- Yes.

603
00:47:57,205 --> 00:48:00,408
Yes, like two cops
working over a criminal.

604
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:04,788
Gantry scares him with the electric chair,
you save him if he confesses.

605
00:48:05,129 --> 00:48:08,878
The point is, our sinner does confess,
and he is saved.

606
00:48:10,468 --> 00:48:14,382
- (Morgan) But it was ridiculous.
- Does the method really matter?

607
00:48:16,516 --> 00:48:21,557
Who is this, uh, this Elmer Gantry?
And what do you really know about him?

608
00:48:23,147 --> 00:48:25,473
His background, his reputation?

609
00:48:25,608 --> 00:48:29,357
What does he want?
Money? My job? You? What?

610
00:48:29,487 --> 00:48:32,903
- Bill...
- In 1917, Mr. Gantry

611
00:48:33,032 --> 00:48:35,903
was expelled from
a theological seminary in Kansas

612
00:48:36,035 --> 00:48:38,787
for seducing
the deacon's daughter in the church

613
00:48:38,913 --> 00:48:42,827
where he had that day
delivered a Christmas sermon.

614
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:45,532
And there's more. Do you wanna hear it?

615
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:47,995
Ta-da!

616
00:48:48,923 --> 00:48:52,043
Ladies and gentlemen,
you see before you a magic carpet.

617
00:48:52,176 --> 00:48:56,340
A heavenly summons.
A ticket to the big time. Listen to this.

618
00:48:56,472 --> 00:48:59,972
"Would you consider meeting with
the church committee and myself

619
00:49:00,101 --> 00:49:04,929
about bringing your revival to our fair city
of Zenith, capital of America's Midwest?"

620
00:49:05,064 --> 00:49:08,979
"Kindly telegraph reply immediately.
Signed, George F Babbitt, Secretary,

621
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:12,645
Zenith Chamber of Commerce,
Chairman of the Church Board. "

622
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,610
Zenith.

623
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,656
- We're not ready for Zenith.
- Mr. Babbitt thinks we are.

624
00:49:16,783 --> 00:49:19,950
I know we are. Next stop, Zenith.
Then Chicago, New York, London.

625
00:49:20,078 --> 00:49:22,783
Straight to the top
on the Sharon Falconer Express!

626
00:49:22,914 --> 00:49:25,750
- In a tent? They'll laugh at us.
- Not at Shara.

627
00:49:25,876 --> 00:49:29,576
It's pitchman's talk. What do you know
about the background of our work?

628
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:32,797
The nature of revivalism is rural.
It grew out of frontier life.

629
00:49:32,924 --> 00:49:36,293
- Big-city people are more cynical...
- They're more sinful, too.

630
00:49:36,428 --> 00:49:39,133
And more lonely
and more unhappy. And...

631
00:49:39,264 --> 00:49:41,886
And, Shara, they need you more.

632
00:49:44,645 --> 00:49:47,729
- I'm against this.
- Bill boy, you're an old sourpuss.

633
00:49:47,856 --> 00:49:51,806
- This is a passport to the Promised Land.
- Gantry, I am not your boy.

634
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:55,735
You deluded her, but to me,
everything about you's offensive.

635
00:49:55,864 --> 00:50:01,071
You're a crude, vulgar show-off, and
your vocabulary belongs in an outhouse.

636
00:50:09,795 --> 00:50:11,205
Crude.

637
00:50:11,338 --> 00:50:12,962
Vulgar.

638
00:50:14,049 --> 00:50:19,209
Show-off, huh? You know something?
You're right, Bill. Let's put it this way.

639
00:50:19,513 --> 00:50:23,593
You're a five-dollar textbook.
Me, I'm a two-cent tabloid newspaper.

640
00:50:23,725 --> 00:50:25,801
You're too good for the people.

641
00:50:25,936 --> 00:50:29,934
I am the people. Sure, I'm common -
just like most people.

642
00:50:30,732 --> 00:50:34,148
The common people put Christianity
on the map in the first place.

643
00:50:34,444 --> 00:50:38,737
What are you saying, Shara?
That you want to go to Zenith? Now?

644
00:50:40,032 --> 00:50:43,033
I wonder what God wants.

645
00:50:44,287 --> 00:50:48,450
All right, Shara. All right.
Maybe you are ready for Zenith.

646
00:50:48,582 --> 00:50:52,911
- Thank you. I'll be with you in a minute.
- Just think of it, Shara. Zenith.

647
00:50:54,713 --> 00:50:57,630
I think the answer to Mr. Babbitt
ought to come from you.

648
00:50:57,757 --> 00:51:02,585
Tell 'em we're ready to talk, but they gotta
act fast. Only don't say it as crude as that.

649
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:07,596
No, no. I'll use some of my
sweet-smelling five-buck words, huh?

650
00:51:07,726 --> 00:51:09,683
I knew we could work together.

651
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:14,140
Gantry, uh... I just hope you don't
have any ideas about who's boss.

652
00:51:14,274 --> 00:51:15,898
Boss?

653
00:51:16,026 --> 00:51:19,311
Why, the boss is God.
I'm just his messenger boy.

654
00:51:20,739 --> 00:51:23,693
I'm sure God will be relieved.

655
00:51:23,825 --> 00:51:25,533
Yes.

656
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:29,740
- Leave the money matters to me.
- If they get a guarantee, what do we get?

657
00:51:29,873 --> 00:51:32,162
- Why is cash necessary at all?
- Order!

658
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:35,376
Gentlemen, without a guarantee,
a revival is impossible.

659
00:51:35,503 --> 00:51:36,250
Kee-rect!

660
00:51:36,379 --> 00:51:42,168
As chairman, I can say I want the revival,
but we're ministers, not financiers.

661
00:51:42,302 --> 00:51:45,007
- I agree. After all, $30,000...
- Will be raised.

662
00:51:45,138 --> 00:51:48,056
- How, Mr. Babbitt?
- By decent, respectable people

663
00:51:48,183 --> 00:51:50,721
- who want to see old-time religion...
- I agree.

664
00:51:50,852 --> 00:51:53,010
- Please let me finish.
- Of course, George.

665
00:51:53,146 --> 00:51:55,139
- Thank you, Charlie.
- OK, then.

666
00:51:55,273 --> 00:51:57,598
Everybody knows that I contribute more

667
00:51:57,734 --> 00:52:01,732
to charity and poverty and things
than anybody, hm?

668
00:52:01,863 --> 00:52:06,359
Hey, now, didn't my real-estate company
give you that corner lot rent-free

669
00:52:06,493 --> 00:52:11,653
for your church baseball team, huh? Hm?
And I'm not even a Methodist! (laughs)

670
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:18,378
All right, then. I always say, business
is business - that's the American way!

671
00:52:18,505 --> 00:52:21,874
- Now, if you boys...
- Why do you want a revival in Zenith?

672
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:26,254
Oh, I know what you're gettin' at, Phil.
You don't fool me for a second.

673
00:52:26,387 --> 00:52:30,135
- We're aware of the financial problems.
- Are we aware, sir?

674
00:52:30,265 --> 00:52:33,551
- My church hasn't been painted for years.
- Whose fault is that?

675
00:52:33,686 --> 00:52:35,595
What about the gymnasium?

676
00:52:35,729 --> 00:52:38,932
In my area, getting milk for
the children is the problem.

677
00:52:39,066 --> 00:52:42,067
Your problem is
empty churches, gentlemen.

678
00:52:42,194 --> 00:52:43,985
That is a fact.

679
00:52:44,113 --> 00:52:47,529
The fact is that church attendance
is falling off everywhere.

680
00:52:47,658 --> 00:52:52,119
Sister Falconer can fill your churches.
That's why you're here in the first place.

681
00:52:52,246 --> 00:52:54,073
- Kee-rect!
- Tea, Mr. Babbitt?

682
00:52:54,206 --> 00:52:58,074
- I always say, if you're sick, call a doctor.
- I agree.

683
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:01,128
Now, uh, let's look at
the record, gentlemen.

684
00:53:01,255 --> 00:53:05,418
Sister Sharon has been in Lincoln -
this is going on the fifth week now.

685
00:53:05,551 --> 00:53:08,836
275 new church members,

686
00:53:08,971 --> 00:53:11,177
- in one church alone.
- My church.

687
00:53:11,307 --> 00:53:14,889
More than 2700
decisions for Christ, gentlemen.

688
00:53:15,019 --> 00:53:18,967
Actual converts who signed pledges.
Not our statistics,

689
00:53:19,105 --> 00:53:21,940
but printed in
your own Zenith newspaper.

690
00:53:22,066 --> 00:53:25,850
And written up by... by Jim Lefferts,
a Pulitzer prizewinner.

691
00:53:25,987 --> 00:53:30,400
Does the record show how long your
converts remain church members?

692
00:53:31,034 --> 00:53:34,734
Well, I always say,
when in doubt, take action.

693
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:36,658
- Let's vote.
- Second.

694
00:53:36,789 --> 00:53:37,821
- All in favour?
- Aye.

695
00:53:37,957 --> 00:53:40,579
- Uh, just a moment, please.
- You're out of order.

696
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:43,877
- There's a motion on the floor.
- May I say something, please?

697
00:53:44,005 --> 00:53:46,626
You have our...
undivided attention, Sister.

698
00:53:46,758 --> 00:53:51,918
Wouldn't it be a much happier world if
money was not the third arm of religion?

699
00:53:52,055 --> 00:53:55,139
He can't paint his church.
You can't have your gymnasium.

700
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:57,591
No child should be without milk.

701
00:53:57,894 --> 00:54:02,021
And my expenses are high enough to run
a factory - I practically do run a factory.

702
00:54:02,147 --> 00:54:06,892
Who do you think pays for my staff? The
musicians, the men who put up the tent.

703
00:54:07,027 --> 00:54:12,104
Truck transportations, railroad fares,
food bills. Advertising and printing bills.

704
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,989
Electric bills, insurance bills, hotel bills.

705
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:19,488
The church committees always
expect a contribution from me,

706
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:25,412
and they always get it. And when I leave
town five weeks later, you get the benefit.

707
00:54:25,545 --> 00:54:29,246
You have the flock,
and I have to start all over again.

708
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:34,635
No, gentlemen, you don't want a revival.

709
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:38,676
And I'm afraid you don't want me, either.

710
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:52,519
I think these gentlemen would like
a little privacy to kick things around.

711
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:54,814
- Thank you, Mr. Gantry.
- Excuse me.

712
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:57,785
I'm not ashamed to admit
our churches are half-empty.

713
00:54:57,911 --> 00:55:01,114
- The ball parks are full.
- So are the races.

714
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:02,577
Let's vote.

715
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:06,408
Vote to do what? Marry the Church
to a three-ring circus?

716
00:55:06,545 --> 00:55:09,083
To barkers who say
they're messengers of God?

717
00:55:09,214 --> 00:55:13,627
Who reduce frightened farmers to howling
dogs? All very entertaining, I'm sure.

718
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,964
We are in competition
with the entertainment business.

719
00:55:17,097 --> 00:55:19,968
- I'm not.
- Then you ought to be. Huh?

720
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:22,886
How about your bingo games?

721
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:26,020
And how about your baseball games
and square dances?

722
00:55:26,148 --> 00:55:29,065
Now, ain't that entertainment?
What's the difference?

723
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:33,273
It's up to us to make a success out of
Christianity, keep the churches full.

724
00:55:33,655 --> 00:55:37,237
What has religion
to do with filling churches?

725
00:55:37,366 --> 00:55:40,782
Once there were only
13 Christians in the entire world.

726
00:55:40,911 --> 00:55:44,327
Was Christianity a failure?
Did God go out of business?

727
00:55:44,457 --> 00:55:50,412
Kee-rect! Christianity is a going concern,
a successful international enterprise.

728
00:55:50,921 --> 00:55:53,543
If you boys don't get
young people back into church,

729
00:55:53,674 --> 00:55:56,343
if you don't keep the train on the tracks,

730
00:55:56,468 --> 00:56:00,168
your church boards are gonna
find somebody else who will.

731
00:56:00,305 --> 00:56:02,974
Isn't that clear, Reverend Garrison?

732
00:56:08,855 --> 00:56:13,067
Speaking for myself,
not my congregation or its church board,

733
00:56:13,193 --> 00:56:17,025
religion is not a business.
And revivalism is not religion.

734
00:56:17,155 --> 00:56:19,195
And my vote is no.

735
00:56:21,117 --> 00:56:23,869
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Phil!

736
00:56:24,245 --> 00:56:25,870
Harvard!

737
00:56:26,748 --> 00:56:31,955
Well, look around you, boys. Young folks
crying out they're the lost generation.

738
00:56:32,087 --> 00:56:37,425
Godless anarchists on every street
corner, and he walks out on a crisis.

739
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:42,343
Do you realise that practically
every president of the United States

740
00:56:42,472 --> 00:56:44,381
was a Mason and a Protestant?

741
00:56:44,516 --> 00:56:47,185
And every session of Congress
opens with a word

742
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:49,801
from the King James version of the Bible.

743
00:56:49,938 --> 00:56:54,814
And right now, in our enlightened age,
a Catholic is running for president.

744
00:56:54,943 --> 00:56:56,437
- Mr. Babbitt...
- And...

745
00:56:56,569 --> 00:56:57,980
Mr. Babbitt!

746
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:01,481
Don't say another word.

747
00:57:06,162 --> 00:57:08,653
George, I agree with you.

748
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:12,459
Please, John.
If revivalism can do the job...

749
00:57:12,584 --> 00:57:13,913
Paul.

750
00:57:14,044 --> 00:57:18,753
Zenith had a revival 40 years ago.
It saved everybody in sight for miles,

751
00:57:18,882 --> 00:57:21,504
but today we still have
the same problems.

752
00:57:21,635 --> 00:57:23,794
Please, John.

753
00:57:23,929 --> 00:57:25,092
Please.

754
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,387
(Babbitt) Order, order. Now, now, now.

755
00:57:27,516 --> 00:57:31,430
Gentlemen, if you'll only
leave the money matters to me.

756
00:57:33,731 --> 00:57:34,893
Kee-rect!

757
00:57:35,024 --> 00:57:37,063
(knocking at door)

758
00:57:43,157 --> 00:57:46,989
- Welcome to Zenith, Sister.
- Congratulations. A wise decision.

759
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:52,326
Gentlemen, all your churches will be
closed while the revival is in progress.

760
00:58:18,484 --> 00:58:22,398
- Great folks, aren't they?
- Swell, George, just swell.

761
00:58:33,457 --> 00:58:38,533
When Sister Falconer says "Shake hands
for Jesus", the chorus starts singing.

762
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:42,963
- Brother Gantry...
- Just a sec. Ushers wear these badges.

763
00:58:43,091 --> 00:58:46,045
The minute folks start comin' in,
you go into action.

764
00:58:46,177 --> 00:58:50,505
Keep 'em movin'. Get pledge cards into
their hands, and don't forget the pencils.

765
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:54,850
Now, you counsellors, you'll wear
these lapel pennants. Pretty, eh?

766
00:58:54,977 --> 00:58:58,642
German-speaking, hold up your hands.
Swedish-speaking? Fine.

767
00:58:58,772 --> 00:59:01,892
Ask if they're regular church
members. Also, what church.

768
00:59:02,025 --> 00:59:07,186
And it don't matter what church. Now,
some folks are gonna wanna cry. Let 'em.

769
00:59:09,408 --> 00:59:10,950
"God is love. "

770
00:59:11,076 --> 00:59:12,867
Jim-dandy, huh?

771
00:59:12,995 --> 00:59:16,944
Well, that's it, I guess.
Tonight's the big night.

772
00:59:17,082 --> 00:59:20,914
Are we gonna make a touchdown for
Jesus Christ? Any further questions?

773
00:59:21,044 --> 00:59:24,413
- Brother Gantry...
- OK, then. At 7. 30, we hit the line.

774
00:59:24,548 --> 00:59:28,296
God is love. Sister Sharon's sanctuary.
May I help you?

775
00:59:28,427 --> 00:59:31,511
Yes, sir, that's right.
Every evening at 8. 30.

776
00:59:31,638 --> 00:59:35,007
Yes, you may take a trolley car.
The line's 14th Street.

777
00:59:35,142 --> 00:59:39,091
Yes. Yes, I understand.
Well, if you're lonesome and restless,

778
00:59:39,229 --> 00:59:43,772
Sister Sharon recommends that
you read Psalm 23 or Psalm 27.

779
00:59:46,737 --> 00:59:50,022
Do you know of a better
product to sell than God?

780
00:59:51,783 --> 00:59:54,072
Uh, Sister, one more question.

781
00:59:54,202 --> 00:59:56,990
- I'm sorry, what was that question again?
- I said...

782
00:59:57,122 --> 00:59:59,993
Sister, in what branch
of the Church were you baptised?

783
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:02,367
Hold it, Sister!

784
01:00:02,502 --> 01:00:06,286
Sister, I'm afraid you have a problem
with the fire department again.

785
01:00:06,423 --> 01:00:08,332
- The fire department?!
- Bill!

786
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:11,384
- I've got the chief on the phone.
- Oh, Sister...

787
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:14,263
- Excuse me.
- . . could I just ask one more question?

788
01:00:14,389 --> 01:00:17,675
What you'll be wearing
for the opening night?

789
01:00:19,895 --> 01:00:23,678
You looked as if you had about enough
of "who, what, when, where".

790
01:00:23,814 --> 01:00:25,854
Thank you.

791
01:00:27,526 --> 01:00:29,982
May I have some water, please?

792
01:00:33,532 --> 01:00:36,237
- You tired?
- Oh, these last two days.

793
01:00:39,789 --> 01:00:42,244
The aspirin age.

794
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:45,245
Nervous about opening tomorrow night?

795
01:00:48,172 --> 01:00:51,422
- I don't know.
- What about Gantry?

796
01:00:53,386 --> 01:00:57,218
He's got all the nerve
in the world, but no nerves.

797
01:00:59,684 --> 01:01:05,022
You want to know the truth?
I'm scared to death of you city people.

798
01:01:05,147 --> 01:01:09,726
Don't be. The women will worship you,
and the men will love you.

799
01:01:10,736 --> 01:01:13,062
And you?

800
01:01:13,197 --> 01:01:15,319
I'll be there, too.

801
01:01:17,784 --> 01:01:20,192
Good night.

802
01:01:20,704 --> 01:01:22,328
Good night.

803
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,871
Just as sure as God plagued the earth
with pestilence and locusts,

804
01:01:32,007 --> 01:01:34,628
you and I... to doom!

805
01:01:35,427 --> 01:01:40,883
I tell you, the end of the world is comin'.
It's coming this September 15th!

806
01:01:41,016 --> 01:01:45,724
- It says so in the Bible!
- Revivals are against organised labour!

807
01:01:45,854 --> 01:01:48,345
(congregation sings "Marching to Zion")

808
01:01:55,739 --> 01:01:58,857
(college boys sing
"The Star-Spangled Banner")

809
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:12,918
Hallelujah! The Lord's name be praised!
Stop it, you scallywags! Stop!

810
01:02:26,268 --> 01:02:29,637
Come on, boys.
All right, the locomotive. Here we go.

811
01:02:29,772 --> 01:02:31,764
(whistle) Boom!

812
01:02:32,399 --> 01:02:34,439
(whistle) Boom!

813
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:38,438
- Sis-boom, Sister!
- Play Sister's introduction.

814
01:02:38,572 --> 01:02:40,446
Sis-boom, Sister!

815
01:02:40,574 --> 01:02:42,816
(band plays)

816
01:02:42,952 --> 01:02:44,529
Captain Holt!

817
01:02:44,662 --> 01:02:46,738
(# "The Battle Hymn of the Republic")

818
01:02:46,872 --> 01:02:49,197
Arrest them. Arrest all of them.

819
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:53,995
I don't know who started the fuss inside.
The ones outside ain't breakin' any laws.

820
01:02:54,129 --> 01:02:57,581
- First arrest them. Then we'll find out...
- I wouldn't do that.

821
01:02:57,716 --> 01:02:59,673
You wanna start a riot?

822
01:02:59,802 --> 01:03:03,336
Folks have gotta have
stretchin' room for their feelings.

823
01:03:03,472 --> 01:03:07,933
Now, why don't you sit down
and get close to God? It'll be all right.

824
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:08,842
It's OK.

825
01:03:08,978 --> 01:03:13,474
# Glory, glory, hallelujah

826
01:03:13,691 --> 01:03:17,640
# Glory, glory, hallelujah

827
01:03:17,778 --> 01:03:23,365
# His truth is marching on

828
01:03:23,492 --> 01:03:27,905
# Glory, glory, hallelujah

829
01:03:28,122 --> 01:03:32,784
# Glory, glory, hallelujah

830
01:03:35,295 --> 01:03:41,333
- They're ready for you, Shara.
- You certainly promoted us into Zenith.

831
01:03:41,467 --> 01:03:45,512
You certainly filled our tent,
didn't you? But with what?

832
01:03:45,638 --> 01:03:49,636
You and your people.
Those aren't people. They're a mob.

833
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:54,725
They're one big animal. I'm not letting
Shara go out there to be humiliated.

834
01:03:54,855 --> 01:03:58,935
And what's your plan? To run?
Where? Back to the sticks?

835
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:03,112
If we don't win them over tonight,
there'll be no place to run.

836
01:04:03,238 --> 01:04:07,106
- Shara, you've got to face them.
- And do what? Blow them kisses?

837
01:04:07,242 --> 01:04:12,070
Tell them all to be nice little boys
and girls? No, Gantry. No. No.

838
01:04:12,205 --> 01:04:16,120
Zenith is your idea.
Those are your people. You face 'em.

839
01:04:23,383 --> 01:04:24,961
They want Shara.

840
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:29,046
Listen to me, Shara.

841
01:04:29,181 --> 01:04:32,265
Big-city people have got
a coat of hard varnish,

842
01:04:32,392 --> 01:04:36,224
but underneath, they're just as sick
and scared as anybody else.

843
01:04:36,355 --> 01:04:41,729
People everywhere are the same
in one thing - they're all afraid to die.

844
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:45,359
They hope you can save them.
And you can, Shara.

845
01:04:47,032 --> 01:04:49,071
You can.

846
01:04:49,826 --> 01:04:52,282
You can, Shara.

847
01:04:52,412 --> 01:04:54,701
You can.

848
01:04:54,831 --> 01:04:56,871
You can, Shara.

849
01:04:58,377 --> 01:05:00,416
You can.

850
01:05:04,257 --> 01:05:08,006
(college boys) Hip, hip, hooray!
Hip, hip, hooray!

851
01:05:08,136 --> 01:05:10,377
Hip, hip, hooray!

852
01:05:11,597 --> 01:05:13,637
(boys cheer)

853
01:05:23,567 --> 01:05:25,809
(singing dies out)

854
01:06:00,396 --> 01:06:02,768
Some of you are troubled.

855
01:06:04,859 --> 01:06:06,816
Sceptical...

856
01:06:06,944 --> 01:06:08,984
of my motives.

857
01:06:10,573 --> 01:06:12,779
You want to know my credentials.

858
01:06:13,743 --> 01:06:15,285
Who am I?

859
01:06:15,911 --> 01:06:18,153
Who sent me?

860
01:06:18,748 --> 01:06:22,164
Some of you have come
to sit in judgement of me.

861
01:06:23,669 --> 01:06:28,912
But who among you is wise enough
to be a judge in the house of God?

862
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:36,216
For even though you speak with the
tongue of an angel and have not charity,

863
01:06:36,348 --> 01:06:38,803
you are as sounding brass.

864
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:44,058
If I have sinned...

865
01:06:45,689 --> 01:06:47,931
then God will punish me.

866
01:06:50,402 --> 01:06:53,771
If I am lost in the wilderness,

867
01:06:53,906 --> 01:06:56,776
then God will show me the way back.

868
01:06:59,453 --> 01:07:02,122
Will you pray with me for guidance?

869
01:07:03,874 --> 01:07:06,116
Will you?

870
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:11,539
God won't mind if you get
a little dirt on your knees!

871
01:07:11,674 --> 01:07:14,247
(old man) I believe in you, Sister.

872
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:18,378
- Oh, bless you, brother.
- I believe in you, Sister.

873
01:07:18,514 --> 01:07:21,634
(choir sings "What a Friend
We Have in Jesus")

874
01:07:24,561 --> 01:07:26,720
No. No. No music.

875
01:07:27,314 --> 01:07:30,564
Please. Please, no singing, no music.

876
01:07:30,693 --> 01:07:32,732
Let us just pray.

877
01:07:34,029 --> 01:07:36,271
Will you pray with me?

878
01:08:00,848 --> 01:08:02,887
Dearest God...

879
01:08:10,316 --> 01:08:13,270
Are you too proud to kneel, Mr. Lefferts?

880
01:08:14,528 --> 01:08:17,529
You may not believe in God...

881
01:08:17,656 --> 01:08:20,111
but God believes in you.

882
01:08:44,807 --> 01:08:46,847
Dear God...

883
01:08:50,813 --> 01:08:54,147
I am set upon by enemies
and I know not why.

884
01:08:56,402 --> 01:09:01,645
The Lord has said "He that believeth
on me believeth not on me...

885
01:09:03,034 --> 01:09:05,276
but on him that sent me. "

886
01:09:07,705 --> 01:09:10,872
"And if any man hear my words
and believe not...

887
01:09:12,335 --> 01:09:17,292
I judge him not.
For I came not to judge the world,

888
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:20,377
but to save the world. "

889
01:09:22,427 --> 01:09:24,669
Now is my soul troubled.

890
01:09:26,807 --> 01:09:29,013
But what shall I say?

891
01:09:30,477 --> 01:09:33,146
Shall I say "Father, save me"?

892
01:09:35,816 --> 01:09:40,774
But it is for this cause
that I came unto this hour.

893
01:09:47,494 --> 01:09:50,945
- Dearly beloved...
- (congregation) Dearly beloved...

894
01:09:51,081 --> 01:09:54,414
. . avenge not yourselves, for it is written...

895
01:09:54,542 --> 01:09:55,953
. . for it is written...

896
01:09:56,085 --> 01:09:59,205
- . . if thine enemy hunger...
- . . if thine enemy hunger...

897
01:09:59,338 --> 01:10:01,710
- . . feed him.
- . . feed him.

898
01:10:01,841 --> 01:10:04,462
- If he thirst...
- If he thirst...

899
01:10:04,593 --> 01:10:06,882
- . . give him drink.
- . . give him drink.

900
01:10:08,806 --> 01:10:13,302
- Be not overcome with evil...
- Be not overcome with evil...

901
01:10:13,436 --> 01:10:16,721
. . but overcome evil with good.

902
01:10:16,939 --> 01:10:20,355
. . but overcome evil with good.

903
01:10:20,484 --> 01:10:21,480
Amen.

904
01:10:21,611 --> 01:10:24,611
# Glory, glory, hallelujah

905
01:10:24,739 --> 01:10:28,571
# His truth is marching on

906
01:10:30,703 --> 01:10:32,742
(man) Hallelujah!

907
01:10:36,834 --> 01:10:38,874
Hallelujah, Sister!

908
01:10:55,061 --> 01:10:56,934
- Brother Gantry...
- Sister Rachel.

909
01:11:00,942 --> 01:11:03,349
She'll be out in a moment.

910
01:11:03,486 --> 01:11:06,321
Didn't I tell you?
Didn't I spot her genius first?

911
01:11:06,447 --> 01:11:09,816
There's been nothing like her
since Joan of Arc! I always say -

912
01:11:09,951 --> 01:11:15,241
and you can quote me on this one, boys -
there's nothing succeeds like success.

913
01:11:15,373 --> 01:11:18,907
- Let's get 'em outta here.
- A triumph over doubt and dissension.

914
01:11:19,043 --> 01:11:22,293
- Biggest thing in Christianity.
- Can I have a picture?

915
01:11:22,421 --> 01:11:25,292
Not me, and Sister's had
a tryin' ordeal, but thank you.

916
01:11:25,424 --> 01:11:27,666
I was saying, if it doesn't get you here...

917
01:11:27,802 --> 01:11:31,383
The poor child's practically out
on her feet. Let's give her a break.

918
01:11:31,513 --> 01:11:35,593
Sure. Sure. Sure. Come on, boys, let's
give the little lady a break, shall we?

919
01:11:35,725 --> 01:11:40,268
Time to say good night. We appreciated
all of you. Thanks for your cooperation.

920
01:11:40,397 --> 01:11:42,057
Good night, Sister.

921
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:45,393
- Good night, Mr. Morgan.
- Good night.

922
01:11:45,527 --> 01:11:47,235
- Good night, Bill.
- Mr. Babbitt.

923
01:11:47,362 --> 01:11:51,858
- Never have made it without you.
- Thanks, Elmer. Good night. Good night.

924
01:11:51,992 --> 01:11:53,949
- Brother Gantry...
- Sister Rachel.

925
01:11:54,077 --> 01:11:57,611
Here's a young lady who deserves
your attention - our maestro of music.

926
01:11:57,746 --> 01:12:00,416
Captain Holt - a real Trojan.
Thank you. Good night.

927
01:12:00,541 --> 01:12:03,495
- Thank you, sir.
- Bill, I'll see if she needs anything.

928
01:12:03,627 --> 01:12:05,999
Gantry... thank you.

929
01:12:06,839 --> 01:12:08,499
Bill boy.

930
01:12:08,632 --> 01:12:11,302
- Yes. Yes.
- Good night.

931
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:13,135
Bill boy. Yes.

932
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,504
- Good night.
- Good night.

933
01:12:31,322 --> 01:12:32,946
Shara?

934
01:12:34,491 --> 01:12:36,531
Are you decent?

935
01:13:12,987 --> 01:13:15,027
Zenith Times-Dispatch? Just a moment.

936
01:13:15,156 --> 01:13:18,074
Slug this "Lead all, article one. "

937
01:13:18,201 --> 01:13:21,036
Revivalism came to Zenith last night.

938
01:13:21,162 --> 01:13:26,287
After six years of backwoods success,
Sister Sharon Falconer -

939
01:13:26,417 --> 01:13:29,122
F-A-L-C-O-N-E-R -

940
01:13:29,253 --> 01:13:33,334
faced a fractious,
overflowing, metropolitan crowd.

941
01:13:33,466 --> 01:13:36,004
- Paragraph.
- (phone rings)

942
01:13:36,135 --> 01:13:38,258
Jim Lefferts. Uh, later, please.

943
01:13:38,388 --> 01:13:40,760
- "Metropolitan crowd. "
- Um...

944
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:43,298
Many came to jeer...

945
01:13:43,434 --> 01:13:45,890
but stayed to cheer.

946
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:50,813
Sister Sharon tamed the Philistines
with a simple prayer.

947
01:13:52,068 --> 01:13:56,529
The big-city hicks swallowed the
chocolate-coated pill with hosannas.

948
01:13:56,656 --> 01:14:00,274
- Give me a start on that, would you?
- Yeah, yeah.

949
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:02,034
But...

950
01:14:03,204 --> 01:14:07,332
if simple prayer was
the main attraction of revivalism...

951
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:16,298
Sister's tent would soon be as empty
as the churches she claims she can fill.

952
01:14:17,385 --> 01:14:19,010
Paragraph.

953
01:14:22,932 --> 01:14:25,602
What... is a revival?

954
01:14:27,395 --> 01:14:30,729
Is it a church? Is it a religion?

955
01:14:33,443 --> 01:14:36,193
Or is it a circus sideshow

956
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:39,486
complete with freaks, magic,

957
01:14:39,615 --> 01:14:41,820
and rabble-rousing?

958
01:14:45,703 --> 01:14:49,404
Why does a revival attract thousands?

959
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:53,787
To see a miracle? To be saved from
a lifetime of sin in five minutes?

960
01:14:53,919 --> 01:14:58,249
To be entertained, cured, cuddled,
in quick, painless salvation?

961
01:14:58,382 --> 01:15:00,007
Paragraph.

962
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:06,385
Zenith is the heart of the Bible Belt. This
is an age that likes noise and whoopee.

963
01:15:06,515 --> 01:15:09,053
We're a fertile land
for corn, beans, squash,

964
01:15:09,185 --> 01:15:14,013
rumble-seat sex, and revivalism.
Hallelujah, brother.

965
01:15:17,026 --> 01:15:22,233
(Lefferts) What qualifies someone to be
a revivalist? Nothing Nothing at all

966
01:15:22,365 --> 01:15:24,938
There is not one law
in any state in the Union

967
01:15:25,076 --> 01:15:28,824
Protecting the public from the
hysterical onslaught of revivalists

968
01:15:28,955 --> 01:15:33,415
But the law does permit them
to invest in tax-free property,

969
01:15:33,542 --> 01:15:37,754
and collect money,
without accounting for how it is used

970
01:15:38,965 --> 01:15:41,634
What do you get for your money?
Can you get into heaven

971
01:15:41,759 --> 01:15:44,546
by contributing one buck or 50?

972
01:15:44,679 --> 01:15:48,842
Can you get life eternal by shaking hands
for Jesus with Elmer Gantry?

973
01:15:48,975 --> 01:15:51,548
"Continued on page three. "

974
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:54,144
So...

975
01:15:54,272 --> 01:15:59,728
"I watched this unholy trinity - Falconer,
Gantry, Morgan - save Nebraska. "

976
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:05,650
"Has sin in that state been washed away?
Is there less envy, lust or adultery?"

977
01:16:05,783 --> 01:16:07,325
- Ah.
- Gee, I hope not.

978
01:16:07,451 --> 01:16:10,618
- Break it up. A party of johns want action.
- Keep readin', honey.

979
01:16:10,746 --> 01:16:13,416
- But, Lulu, they'll be right over.
- Drop dead!

980
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:16,245
- Cigarette me, Pete, honey.
- Honey, read!

981
01:16:17,043 --> 01:16:23,378
"To Elmer Gantry, God is an all-American
football player with a long white beard,

982
01:16:23,508 --> 01:16:27,720
who carries lightning in one hand,
and a bag of tricks in the other. "

983
01:16:27,846 --> 01:16:31,760
"And Gantry has the high-pressure
style and personality to sell this God

984
01:16:31,891 --> 01:16:34,845
even to big-city slickers. "

985
01:16:35,645 --> 01:16:38,730
"He can make
innocent people feel guilty...

986
01:16:39,608 --> 01:16:42,312
and bad people feel good. "

987
01:16:42,444 --> 01:16:45,148
"Gantry has a voice made for promises. "

988
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,197
- Can he save anybody?
- Can he?

989
01:16:51,286 --> 01:16:55,236
Can he? Anywhere, any time.

990
01:16:55,373 --> 01:16:59,751
In a tent, standin' up,
layin' down, or any other way.

991
01:16:59,878 --> 01:17:02,203
And he's got plenty of ways!

992
01:17:02,339 --> 01:17:05,542
Lulu? Was you saved
by him, Lulu, honey?

993
01:17:05,675 --> 01:17:10,218
Sister, I was saved by him
way back in Schoenheim, Kansas.

994
01:17:10,347 --> 01:17:14,842
"Love... love is the mornin'
and the evenin' star. "

995
01:17:14,975 --> 01:17:20,266
"And what is love?
Not the carnal, but the divine love!"

996
01:17:20,397 --> 01:17:23,932
Oh, he gave me special instructions
back of the pulpit Christmas Eve.

997
01:17:24,068 --> 01:17:26,819
He got to howlin' "Repent. Repent!"

998
01:17:26,946 --> 01:17:29,900
And I got to moanin' "Save me. Save me. "

999
01:17:30,032 --> 01:17:34,990
He rammed the fear of God into me so
fast I never heard my old man's footsteps.

1000
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:40,281
The next thing I knew, I was out in the
cold, hard snow in my bare little soul.

1001
01:17:41,919 --> 01:17:44,789
Oh, Brother Gantry, save me!

1002
01:17:55,390 --> 01:18:00,431
Don't do it, Shara. Don't get yourself
mixed up in an alley fight. Listen to me...

1003
01:18:00,561 --> 01:18:02,186
(click)

1004
01:18:04,983 --> 01:18:06,940
Why, Georgie, hello!

1005
01:18:07,068 --> 01:18:10,817
- You shut up. I am crucified to pieces.
- What's the matter?

1006
01:18:10,947 --> 01:18:14,482
What's the matter? "Why did
George F Babbitt underwrite a guarantee

1007
01:18:14,617 --> 01:18:16,942
of $30,000 to bring a revival to Zenith?"

1008
01:18:17,078 --> 01:18:19,913
"Is Sister Sharon
preaching the word of Jesus

1009
01:18:20,039 --> 01:18:23,491
or the gospel of Babbitt's
real-estate business?"

1010
01:18:23,626 --> 01:18:26,711
For God's sakes! I don't want any trouble.

1011
01:18:26,838 --> 01:18:30,586
I am in business.
I'm a 32nd-degree Mason.

1012
01:18:30,717 --> 01:18:33,421
George boy, don't take
this thing so seriously!

1013
01:18:33,553 --> 01:18:37,337
- I just sure as hell don't think it's a joke!
- We'll lick it, Georgie!

1014
01:18:37,473 --> 01:18:40,309
"Georgie!" My telephone
has not stopped ringing.

1015
01:18:40,435 --> 01:18:44,729
Everybody's mad at me or laughing at me.
Even my own family's turned against me.

1016
01:18:44,856 --> 01:18:46,480
As of right now,

1017
01:18:46,608 --> 01:18:51,104
I am cancelling out on my support -
financial and every other way.

1018
01:18:51,237 --> 01:18:53,811
George, you've got to fight back!

1019
01:18:56,784 --> 01:18:58,694
- Fight the press?
- Yes.

1020
01:18:58,828 --> 01:19:01,829
Mister, do you know anybody
ever licked the newspapers?

1021
01:19:01,956 --> 01:19:04,281
Me and you.

1022
01:19:04,417 --> 01:19:08,878
Besides, I am for a free press,
and for free enterprise,

1023
01:19:09,005 --> 01:19:12,540
and for... whatever the hell
the other freedoms are!

1024
01:19:12,675 --> 01:19:14,964
But, Reverend, you invited us here.

1025
01:19:15,094 --> 01:19:19,472
If you withdraw your support now, you're
endorsing this vicious newspaper smear.

1026
01:19:19,599 --> 01:19:22,090
- These telegrams of protest...
- There's always a lunatic fringe...

1027
01:19:22,226 --> 01:19:27,101
These are from my parishioners. These
are complaints from my church board.

1028
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:30,682
Even my national superior
telephoned me long-distance.

1029
01:19:30,817 --> 01:19:32,893
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan.

1030
01:19:33,028 --> 01:19:36,112
- If you turn against us now...
- What I do doesn't matter.

1031
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:39,608
Public opinion has turned against you.
That does matter.

1032
01:19:39,743 --> 01:19:43,361
- Tell him it's Sister Sharon Falconer.
- (knocking at door)

1033
01:19:43,497 --> 01:19:46,118
- No, I'll wait.
- (knocking)

1034
01:19:48,293 --> 01:19:51,128
- Did you find Mr. Gantry?
- Nobody's seen him since he left.

1035
01:19:51,255 --> 01:19:53,923
- His hotel room?
- Hasn't been there all day.

1036
01:19:55,007 --> 01:19:57,545
Yes? Mr. Eddington?

1037
01:19:58,594 --> 01:20:01,928
I want to see you. No, sir, at once.

1038
01:20:03,015 --> 01:20:07,761
No, your office will be fine.
Will you please have Mr. Lefferts there?

1039
01:20:08,521 --> 01:20:10,560
Thank you.

1040
01:20:11,983 --> 01:20:15,398
Maybe... something
happened to Mr. Gantry.

1041
01:20:15,528 --> 01:20:16,808
Forget Mr. Gantry.

1042
01:20:41,137 --> 01:20:44,091
- Evening, George.
- I'm busy.

1043
01:20:44,223 --> 01:20:48,719
I had a busy day myself.

01:21:03,366 --> 01:21:06,569
- Business: prostitution.
- On my property?

1049
01:21:06,703 --> 01:21:10,653
- Well, I'll have them evicted.
- Of course. Of course.

1050
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:13,163
You've been victimised, George.

1051
01:21:13,293 --> 01:21:15,665
- Same as me.
- Yeah.

1052
01:21:17,047 --> 01:21:22,385
Evening, boys. Never bet into an open
pair... unless you've got the lock!

1053
01:21:23,595 --> 01:21:26,002
- Say good night, George.
- Oh, this?

1054
01:21:26,139 --> 01:21:30,718
Well, we're just playing for chips -
you know, sociable.

1055
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:35,181
- You takin' me for a ride or somethin'?
- To the publisher of the Times-Dispatch

1056
01:21:35,315 --> 01:21:38,067
- You got somethin' on him, too?
- I got you.

1057
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:41,063
- Yeah, sure, but...
- It's getting late, George.

1058
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:44,481
The point is, why did he write this trash,
and why did you publish it?

1059
01:21:44,616 --> 01:21:47,570
- Are you suggesting censorship, Miss?
- Only fair play.

1060
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:49,909
- This is muckraking!
- Is it true?

1061
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:51,829
- No!
- Then sue us for libel.

1062
01:21:51,957 --> 01:21:56,250
Oh, you're much too clever for that.
It's what you imply - the veiled slurs.

1063
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:59,663
- Hints that I misused collection money.
- I never said that.

1064
01:21:59,798 --> 01:22:03,795
Did I ever preach anything
but God's word? Well? Did I?

1065
01:22:03,927 --> 01:22:06,085
- Are you ordained?
- What?

1066
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:10,088
Do you hold a degree from any
recognised theological seminary?

1067
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:13,142
- Does Gantry?
- No.

1068
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:16,473
Are you sanctioned
to preach by any church?

1069
01:22:16,606 --> 01:22:21,564
No, Mr. Lefferts, but... neither was Peter
or Paul or any of the other apostles.

1070
01:22:21,695 --> 01:22:25,360
Ah, but they said that they lived with
the Son of God, were taught by him,

1071
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:27,898
were sanctified by him.

1072
01:22:28,034 --> 01:22:31,534
What gives you
the right to speak for God?

1073
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:39,456
I couldn't possibly be doing
God's work without his approval.

1074
01:22:39,586 --> 01:22:41,958
How did you get his approval?

1075
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:46,711
Did God speak to you personally?

1076
01:22:48,928 --> 01:22:51,300
Did he send you a letter?

1077
01:22:52,348 --> 01:22:54,839
Did you have a visitation from God?

1078
01:22:54,976 --> 01:22:57,218
A burning bush, perhaps?

1079
01:22:59,272 --> 01:23:04,432
Where in the New Testament does it say
that God spoke to anyone except his son?

1080
01:23:07,322 --> 01:23:09,991
But it does say in the First Corinthians

1081
01:23:10,116 --> 01:23:13,532
"Let your women
keep silence in the churches. "

1082
01:23:13,661 --> 01:23:16,496
"It is a shame for women
to speak in the church. "

1083
01:23:16,623 --> 01:23:20,667
Congratulations, Jim boy. I see you're
a student of the Bible. I'm delighted.

1084
01:23:20,793 --> 01:23:25,254
What is it? Are you responsible for some
of these crackpot calls I've been getting?

1085
01:23:25,381 --> 01:23:28,585
- You want Mr. Lefferts fired, too?
- Fired?

1086
01:23:28,718 --> 01:23:31,719
Why, I'd give Jim a bonus
for boostin' circulation.

1087
01:23:31,846 --> 01:23:34,218
I thought you came to bury Caesar,
not to praise him.

1088
01:23:34,349 --> 01:23:39,343
Shakespeare. Ah, yes. A moment ago you
used the Bible... to whip Sister Sharon.

1089
01:23:39,479 --> 01:23:43,346
- I merely quoted it as a source.
- Of course. As a good newspaperman,

1090
01:23:43,483 --> 01:23:46,816
you wouldn't use information
unless it was fact, would you?

1091
01:23:46,945 --> 01:23:49,696
Tell me somethin', Jim.

1092
01:23:49,822 --> 01:23:51,815
Is the Bible fact?

1093
01:23:51,950 --> 01:23:53,230
Hm?

1094
01:23:53,368 --> 01:23:56,902
Well, come on, Jim boy.
Did God create the universe in six days?

1095
01:23:57,038 --> 01:24:00,489
Did He make the sun stand still
to help Joshua lick the Amalekites?

1096
01:24:00,625 --> 01:24:02,167
No.

1097
01:24:02,293 --> 01:24:04,582
- You don't believe Moses parted the sea?
- No.

1098
01:24:04,712 --> 01:24:07,998
- God wrote the Ten Commandments?
- Nope.

1099
01:24:08,132 --> 01:24:10,884
Or that the dead were raised
and the blind cured?

1100
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:14,544
And 5,000 people were fed
with five little fishes

1101
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:17,005
and two little itty-bitty loaves of bread?

1102
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:18,220
No.

1103
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:21,766
You don't believe in any of the miracles
in the Holy Bible, do you?

1104
01:24:21,895 --> 01:24:26,806
No more than I believe that black cats or
spilt salt or broken mirrors are bad luck.

1105
01:24:26,942 --> 01:24:31,438
Or that God can be jealous
or bloodthirsty or vengeful.

1106
01:24:31,571 --> 01:24:35,700
Or that Jehovah sanctions bigamy
and stupidity and slavery.

1107
01:24:35,826 --> 01:24:39,076
In other words,
you don't believe in the Bible.

1108
01:24:40,289 --> 01:24:44,156
I believe that the Bible is a book
of beautiful poetry and wisdom...

1109
01:24:44,293 --> 01:24:46,332
But it's not fact.

1110
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:50,876
And if it's not fact,

1111
01:24:51,008 --> 01:24:54,626
why would he use it as information,
except to destroy her character?

1112
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:58,261
I heard you say it,
and you'll burn in hell for it.

1113
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:01,676
No, Georgie.
You can't scare Jim that way.

1114
01:25:02,811 --> 01:25:08,731
You see, if you don't believe in the Bible...
you don't believe there's a real hell.

1115
01:25:08,859 --> 01:25:10,057
Hey.

1116
01:25:10,193 --> 01:25:14,321
And it follows if there's no real hell, there
can't be a real heaven. Right, Jim boy?

1117
01:25:14,447 --> 01:25:17,483
Why don't you get to the point?

1118
01:25:17,617 --> 01:25:21,745
Do you believe Jesus Christ
can give us life everlasting?

1119
01:25:29,754 --> 01:25:33,882
Do you believe Jesus Christ
can give us life everlasting?

1120
01:25:36,385 --> 01:25:39,172
- I'd love to believe it.
- But you don't?

1121
01:25:40,222 --> 01:25:41,847
No.

1122
01:25:45,853 --> 01:25:49,553
Then you don't accept
Jesus Christ as divine, do you?

1123
01:26:00,617 --> 01:26:01,613
Well?

1124
01:26:04,955 --> 01:26:10,459
Jesus was a great, virtuous teacher.
His faith and courage changed the world.

1125
01:26:10,585 --> 01:26:13,622
Do you accept Jesus Christ as divine?

1126
01:26:17,759 --> 01:26:21,175
Let me say... I have doubts.

1127
01:26:21,304 --> 01:26:25,516
- That's blasphemy!
- Mr. Babbitt, to doubt is not blasphemy.

1128
01:26:25,642 --> 01:26:29,474
When you say "blasphemy", you mean
"Don't dare disagree. Don't think. "

1129
01:26:29,604 --> 01:26:31,763
"Don't doubt. "

1130
01:26:31,898 --> 01:26:37,355
But Tolstoy, Darwin, Jefferson, Lincoln -
they had the same doubts.

1131
01:26:37,487 --> 01:26:40,156
Then they'll burn in hell, too!

1132
01:26:41,074 --> 01:26:44,906
Mr. Eddington, in spite of
Mr. Lefferts' confessed bigotry,

1133
01:26:45,036 --> 01:26:48,701
I defend your right to publish these
articles. But give us equal rights.

1134
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:52,960
- Your reply'll be published prominently.
- Mr. Eddington, I'm no writer.

1135
01:26:53,086 --> 01:26:56,336
Now, Jim is brilliant and witty.
Uses words like a stiletto.

1136
01:26:56,464 --> 01:27:00,083
He learned from Mencken, Ingersoll,
Sinclair Lewis, other atheists.

1137
01:27:00,218 --> 01:27:02,460
- Atheists!
- But you own a radio station.

1138
01:27:02,596 --> 01:27:05,550
Set the time. Half an hour.
Tonight? Tomorrow? Name it.

1139
01:27:05,682 --> 01:27:09,300
Every day for two weeks -
half-hour in the morning and evening.

1140
01:27:09,436 --> 01:27:14,145
- Just to answer this article?
- I don't intend to answer anything.

1141
01:27:14,274 --> 01:27:16,313
You don't debate the existence of God.

1142
01:27:16,443 --> 01:27:19,859
Jim, here, has spread
the poison of doubt and disbelief.

1143
01:27:19,988 --> 01:27:24,779
Just give me a chance to spread the
gospel, to raise the banner of Christianity,

1144
01:27:24,908 --> 01:27:27,779
to restore the faith he stole.

1145
01:27:27,912 --> 01:27:31,530
Now, sir, I realise time means money -
especially radio time.

1146
01:27:31,665 --> 01:27:33,539
Right.

1147
01:27:34,335 --> 01:27:36,576
So our good citizen, George F Babbitt,

1148
01:27:36,712 --> 01:27:41,707
has kindly consented to pay for every
minute of radio time. Right, George?

1149
01:27:41,842 --> 01:27:43,882
Georgie boy?

1150
01:27:46,555 --> 01:27:49,722
- Right.
- Thank you, sir. Good night.

1151
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:51,475
Sister.

1152
01:27:52,603 --> 01:27:55,519
Good night, Mr. Eddington. Mr. Lefferts.

1153
01:27:55,647 --> 01:27:58,897
- Jim boy.
- Congratulations.

1154
01:27:59,025 --> 01:28:01,433
I bear you no malice. Mr. Babbitt.

1155
01:28:01,861 --> 01:28:05,562
Blasphemy! Good night, Mr. Eddington.

1156
01:28:05,698 --> 01:28:09,363
And you... you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

1157
01:28:23,633 --> 01:28:26,753
Oh, it was... glorious.

1158
01:28:26,886 --> 01:28:30,136
Outrageously, blissfully glorious.

1159
01:28:31,224 --> 01:28:36,930
Oh, you really are an alley fighter.
You hit Brother Jim both sides of the belt!

1160
01:28:37,063 --> 01:28:40,230
You murdered 'em. You knocked
'em flat with a celestial bolt -

1161
01:28:40,358 --> 01:28:43,229
eight, nine, ten, and out! Oh, darling!

1162
01:28:49,617 --> 01:28:55,122
You didn't fight fair but you've seen
your duty and you've done it. Oh, darling!

1163
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:05,084
Stop it. Stop it. I was crazy.
I was so happy you delivered me!

1164
01:29:05,215 --> 01:29:10,376
Can't you understand? God sent you
to me as his instrument, not as my lover.

1165
01:29:12,723 --> 01:29:18,144
No, I don't understand. You got me
half-crazy, talkin' to myself.

1166
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:21,686
One minute you're a howling banshee,
the next, you're cold potatoes.

1167
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:24,520
I don't understand anything,
but I worship you.

1168
01:29:25,611 --> 01:29:29,478
Well, then, stop treating me
like one of your tramps!

1169
01:29:29,615 --> 01:29:33,030
There's no such thing. There's
honest women and dishonest women.

1170
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,651
And you want to make
an honest woman out of me. Men!

1171
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:38,705
Don't knock 'em if you haven't tried 'em.

1172
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:41,288
- Encyclopaedia sexualis
- I never read it.

1173
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:45,665
You wrote it! You've just got to have
every woman - old, young, stupid. Even...

1174
01:29:46,632 --> 01:29:50,464
Even poor, starved Rachel
with her wet calf eyes.

1175
01:29:51,762 --> 01:29:54,965
- May God strike me dead...
- Be careful, or he'll strike you dead

1176
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:59,807
for being the ungrateful liar that you are.
Can't you ever tell the truth?

1177
01:29:59,937 --> 01:30:05,013
You wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.
It's you I want, Shara. No one else.

1178
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:08,068
I want you so bad,
I'm in pain half the time.

1179
01:30:08,195 --> 01:30:10,946
I'd tear your holy wings off,
make a woman out of you.

1180
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:15,948
I'd show you what heaven is - no golden
stairways or harp music or silvery clouds.

1181
01:30:16,078 --> 01:30:18,865
Just ecstasy, comin' and goin'.

1182
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:23,119
Do you really think I'd compete
for your glorious body?

1183
01:30:23,252 --> 01:30:27,960
Damn right. Every woman competes
with every other woman for every man.

1184
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:34,466
It's the truth, Shara. You want it.
You want it as much as I do.

1185
01:30:34,594 --> 01:30:39,137
You want it with me. When are you
going to make up your mind to take it?

1186
01:30:47,274 --> 01:30:49,943
Get in the car. Go on, do as I say.

1187
01:31:07,627 --> 01:31:10,297
Turn on the lights, please.

1188
01:31:30,025 --> 01:31:31,649
There.

1189
01:31:33,153 --> 01:31:36,070
That's what I've been working for.

1190
01:31:36,197 --> 01:31:40,242
No more tents. No more
running around like a circus.

1191
01:31:40,368 --> 01:31:42,990
No more haggling with committees.

1192
01:31:43,705 --> 01:31:46,077
My own tabernacle.

1193
01:31:47,167 --> 01:31:52,161
A permanent home. A clinic for
sick bodies. A free soup kitchen.

1194
01:31:52,297 --> 01:31:56,129
A place of worship for
everybody of every faith.

1195
01:31:57,552 --> 01:31:59,545
That's my first love.

1196
01:32:04,768 --> 01:32:07,306
What have you got to match that?

1197
01:32:08,896 --> 01:32:11,434
Nothin'. Nothin' at all.

1198
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:15,851
I'm just a hick from Kansas,
and you're real class, Shara.

1199
01:32:15,986 --> 01:32:20,233
The only class I've got is the name
Falconer. That's why I picked it.

1200
01:32:21,367 --> 01:32:24,321
I'm Katie Jones from shantytown.

1201
01:32:26,622 --> 01:32:29,789
That's right. Shantytown.

1202
01:32:29,917 --> 01:32:35,338
But does that make a liar out of me?
I am Sharon Falconer now. I've made her.

1203
01:32:35,464 --> 01:32:39,711
I've put her together piece by piece
till I've got a right to be her. I am her.

1204
01:32:40,261 --> 01:32:43,546
I started building this tabernacle
two years ago,

1205
01:32:43,681 --> 01:32:47,513
and when this revival is ended,
I'll have enough money to own it.

1206
01:32:47,893 --> 01:32:51,807
Do you think it was blind luck
that brought us to Zenith?

1207
01:32:56,193 --> 01:32:58,233
Do you?

1208
01:33:00,030 --> 01:33:02,189
Of course not.

1209
01:33:02,324 --> 01:33:05,574
- It was God's will.
- Of course.

1210
01:33:14,794 --> 01:33:18,329
- Now do you understand why we... ?
- Of course. Of course.

1211
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:21,038
- Nothing's going to take it away from me.
- Nothing.

1212
01:33:21,175 --> 01:33:23,417
- Nobody must spoil it.
- Nobody.

1213
01:33:24,679 --> 01:33:27,135
- I've never...
- Of course.

1214
01:33:27,265 --> 01:33:29,304
- Never.
- Naturally.

1215
01:33:30,393 --> 01:33:32,433
Yes.

1216
01:33:35,315 --> 01:33:37,272
(man) Sister Sharon?

1217
01:33:38,067 --> 01:33:39,265
Sister Sharon?

1218
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:51,826
Jim Lefferts is an honourable man.
But so was Brutus.

1219
01:33:51,955 --> 01:33:56,368
And we all know that Brutus was
an anarchistic, alcoholic assassin.

1220
01:33:59,546 --> 01:34:05,667
Jim "Lucifer" Lefferts calls you good
People of Zenith suckers, slickers, saps

1221
01:34:05,802 --> 01:34:11,177
He attacks the way you worship I don't
notice him attackin' booze or prostitution

1222
01:34:12,893 --> 01:34:15,384
Lucifer Jim says he wants to save you

1223
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:18,936
How? By stabbin' Jesus with dirty lies?

1224
01:34:19,983 --> 01:34:22,059
By assassinatin' God?

1225
01:34:23,528 --> 01:34:26,482
I have here in my pocket -

1226
01:34:26,615 --> 01:34:29,022
and thank heaven you can't see them -

1227
01:34:29,159 --> 01:34:31,946
lewd, dirty, obscene...

1228
01:34:33,038 --> 01:34:34,532
And I'm ashamed to say this.

1229
01:34:34,665 --> 01:34:36,704
. . French postcards.

1230
01:34:39,211 --> 01:34:43,291
They were sold to me, in front of
your own innocent high school,

1231
01:34:43,423 --> 01:34:47,421
by a man with a black beard. A foreigner!

1232
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:49,878
- Shocking!
- And last night...

1233
01:34:50,013 --> 01:34:56,632
last night, right here on Main Street,
I was accosted by three painted women!

1234
01:34:56,770 --> 01:34:59,688
- The tramps.
- Your streets are made unsafe

1235
01:34:59,815 --> 01:35:02,222
by shameless, diseased hussies,

1236
01:35:02,359 --> 01:35:07,270
rapacious pickpockets,
and insidious opium-smokers

1237
01:35:07,406 --> 01:35:09,612
And Elmer Gantry.

1238
01:35:11,535 --> 01:35:13,326
(bell rings)

1239
01:35:13,453 --> 01:35:18,411
This newspaper... this newspaper
says everybody's against me.

1240
01:35:18,542 --> 01:35:23,002
The mildewed Methodists, Episcopalians,
and Baptists are against me.

1241
01:35:23,129 --> 01:35:25,702
Even the ossified, petrified, horizontal,

1242
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,675
perpendicular presbyterians
are against me!

1243
01:35:28,801 --> 01:35:31,209
But this newspaper lies!

1244
01:35:31,345 --> 01:35:33,753
Some of the preachers
might be against me.

1245
01:35:34,098 --> 01:35:38,427
Unitarianism, Russellism,
Spiritualism - they hate me!

1246
01:35:38,561 --> 01:35:41,562
And what hates me
most of all is Harvardism,

1247
01:35:41,689 --> 01:35:44,560
Yaleism, and Princetonism!

1248
01:35:45,568 --> 01:35:48,652
But you're some of God's best people.

1249
01:35:48,779 --> 01:35:51,484
- And you don't hate me, do you?
- No!

1250
01:35:51,616 --> 01:35:55,114
- Smack 'em down, preacher!
- Kill 'em! Murder 'em!

1251
01:36:01,082 --> 01:36:03,324
Can you hear me, Jesus?

1252
01:36:05,378 --> 01:36:10,289
I'd like you to save this
old friend of mine, Jim Lefferts,

1253
01:36:10,425 --> 01:36:15,467
who's been writin' all these dirty, black
lies about me. But I'll warn you, Jesus.

1254
01:36:15,597 --> 01:36:19,297
You better wear rubber gloves
and use a strong disinfectant.

1255
01:36:19,434 --> 01:36:23,135
But if you can save sinner Jim...
I'd like for you to do it.

1256
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:26,900
What the hell's he trying to do?

1257
01:36:28,944 --> 01:36:30,983
(bell rings)

1258
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:37,568
Shara, they've played
your introduction twice now.

1259
01:36:37,702 --> 01:36:40,158
This is the biggest crowd we've ever had.

1260
01:36:43,416 --> 01:36:45,954
Please, Shara.

1261
01:36:46,086 --> 01:36:50,664
# Glory, glory, hallelujah

1262
01:36:50,882 --> 01:36:55,627
# Glory, glory, hallelujah

1263
01:36:58,264 --> 01:37:02,392
(Gantry) We're all sinners,
every blessed one of us

1264
01:37:08,816 --> 01:37:13,110
Booze! Booze put a bullet
through Lincoln and McKinley!

1265
01:37:14,863 --> 01:37:21,577
Booze is the way white slavers rob the
virtue of 60,000 American girls every year!

1266
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:28,077
The bootleggers, the white slavers,

1267
01:37:28,210 --> 01:37:31,662
and that newspaper are tryin'
to scare me and Sister outta town!

1268
01:37:31,797 --> 01:37:33,873
(crowd boos)

1269
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,587
But as long as I got a foot, I'll kick booze!

1270
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:40,471
As long as I got a fist, I'll punch it!

1271
01:37:40,598 --> 01:37:43,634
And as long as I've got a tooth, I'll bite it!

1272
01:37:43,767 --> 01:37:47,350
And when I'm old and grey
and toothless and bootless,

1273
01:37:47,479 --> 01:37:52,818
I'll gum it, till I go to heaven,
and booze goes to hell!

1274
01:37:57,615 --> 01:38:00,236
That's a hell of a speech.

1275
01:38:00,367 --> 01:38:04,946
It's been eight days. It's been eight days
since I gave you the addresses

1276
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:08,948
of 11 blind tigers, two cocaine peddlers,

1277
01:38:09,084 --> 01:38:11,754
and 16 brothels.

1278
01:38:11,879 --> 01:38:13,670
And what's been done about it?

1279
01:38:13,797 --> 01:38:16,253
- Nothing, Captain.
- (cheering)

1280
01:38:18,636 --> 01:38:22,087
We're gettin' sick and tired of scoldin' sin.

1281
01:38:22,222 --> 01:38:24,511
We're gonna abolish it!

1282
01:38:24,642 --> 01:38:28,176
We'll show 'em how to clean up
this town tonight! Right now!

1283
01:38:28,312 --> 01:38:30,304
Charge!

1284
01:38:34,107 --> 01:38:35,899
Elmer, be careful.

1285
01:38:36,026 --> 01:38:37,817
Courage, Sister. Courage.

1286
01:38:38,987 --> 01:38:42,072
(crowd sings
"Onward Christian Soldiers")

1287
01:38:51,708 --> 01:38:55,872
Brother Jim! Glad to see you
on the side of the angels.

1288
01:38:56,004 --> 01:39:00,168
Aren't you afraid some of these
desperate bootleggers carry guns?

1289
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:04,512
- No bullet could pierce the Holy Bible.
- They might not aim at the Holy Bible.

1290
01:39:04,638 --> 01:39:06,880
Very good! Onward!

1291
01:39:25,075 --> 01:39:28,859
- Smash that speakeasy door!
- What for? Just knock. They'll open up.

1292
01:39:28,996 --> 01:39:31,202
Captain. My good man.

1293
01:39:32,666 --> 01:39:35,122
Hold it! All right, Reverend.

1294
01:39:42,301 --> 01:39:44,174
(women scream)

1295
01:39:44,303 --> 01:39:47,754
- Sinful woman!
- That's a dirty lie! We pay protection!

1296
01:39:47,889 --> 01:39:50,345
- Shame! Shame!
- Take 'em away, men!

1297
01:39:50,475 --> 01:39:53,679
- Whisky!
- Why didn't you give me a phone call?

1298
01:39:53,812 --> 01:39:56,303
Don't break the furniture!

1299
01:40:01,194 --> 01:40:06,354
- Should've seen what this one was doing.
- Harlot! You ought to be asha...

1300
01:40:09,201 --> 01:40:11,443
Arrest this woman!

1301
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:23,131
#. . soldiers, marching as to war

1302
01:40:25,384 --> 01:40:29,762
Captain Holt, may I suggest you release
these poor unfortunate creatures?

1303
01:40:29,889 --> 01:40:31,798
- What? But you told me...
- I know.

1304
01:40:31,933 --> 01:40:34,969
But throwing a prostitute into jail
will not remove her sin.

1305
01:40:35,102 --> 01:40:39,811
And it certainly won't get rid of
prostitution. No pictures. No publicity.

1306
01:40:39,941 --> 01:40:44,318
Captain Holt, I want to compliment
you and your men on a fine, patriotic job.

1307
01:40:44,445 --> 01:40:46,936
Why, thank you, sir.

1308
01:40:47,073 --> 01:40:49,480
See these girls leave town. And quick.

1309
01:40:49,617 --> 01:40:51,740
(applause)

1310
01:40:57,875 --> 01:41:00,117
Excuse me, Mr. Gantry.

1311
01:41:02,004 --> 01:41:05,207
That Mr. Gantry,
he's absolutely incredible.

1312
01:41:05,341 --> 01:41:09,042
The fabulous thing about Mr. Gantry
is, he's absolutely credible.

1313
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:14,678
- (man) Excuse me, please.
- She's here, Mr. Gantry.

1314
01:41:16,142 --> 01:41:19,594
- (man) Oh, Mr. Gantry...
- Not now. Not now. Later. Later.

1315
01:41:19,729 --> 01:41:23,727
There you are. Sister'll see all of you
as soon as she's had a moment's rest.

1316
01:41:26,695 --> 01:41:30,229
Mayor, congressman, the governor,
and lookie here, Shara.

1317
01:41:30,365 --> 01:41:34,315
Offers... from England, Japan,
Australia, Madison Square Garden...

1318
01:41:34,452 --> 01:41:36,825
- From me to you.
- . . the circus.

1319
01:41:37,998 --> 01:41:40,405
Shara, you shouldn't have.

1320
01:41:40,542 --> 01:41:44,373
How about you sneaking away
with Katie Jones on a real fun picnic?

1321
01:41:44,503 --> 01:41:47,208
No telegrams,
no newspapers, no sermons.

1322
01:41:47,339 --> 01:41:50,340
The only business of the day will be us.
Just the two of us.

1323
01:41:50,467 --> 01:41:52,092
Oh, Shara.

1324
01:41:53,178 --> 01:41:55,800
- We can't.
- But why? I've got the escape planned.

1325
01:41:55,931 --> 01:42:00,640
The car's out front. We'll disappear
before they even know we've gone.

1326
01:42:00,769 --> 01:42:03,973
You're gonna cinch a contribution
from the ladies' committee.

1327
01:42:04,106 --> 01:42:07,557
At 11 o'clock, we dedicate your
Waters of the Jordan Tabernacle -

1328
01:42:07,693 --> 01:42:10,528
the mayor, fireworks,
the brass band, everything.

1329
01:42:10,654 --> 01:42:14,866
12. 30, lunch, Rosen's department store,
where you say grace for 200 salesmen.

1330
01:42:14,992 --> 01:42:19,321
- And at two o'clock...
- I'll be exhausted, irritable and hateful.

1331
01:42:20,247 --> 01:42:23,450
Shara... we'll celebrate tonight.

1332
01:42:23,792 --> 01:42:26,118
- Late.
- Tonight's a thousand years away.

1333
01:42:26,253 --> 01:42:28,293
Shara, baby...

1334
01:42:29,465 --> 01:42:35,420
Oh, very well. Bring in those smug
little ladies with their fat little hands,

1335
01:42:35,554 --> 01:42:41,141
- fat little souls and fat little...
- Don't forget their fat little chequebooks.

1336
01:42:44,563 --> 01:42:48,264
- Ladies. Dear ladies.
- Mr. Gantry? You're wanted on the phone.

1337
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:53,109
Thank you. Bill. I'll take it right here.
Lovely morning, isn't it?

1338
01:42:53,239 --> 01:42:55,564
- Hello?
- Mr. Gantry, it's so nice meeting you.

1339
01:42:55,699 --> 01:42:58,736
- Sister joyously awaits you.
- Oh, Mr. Gantry.

1340
01:42:58,869 --> 01:43:03,661
Thank you very much. Hello? Yes,
this is Dr Gantry - uh, Mr. Gantry. Who?

1341
01:43:03,999 --> 01:43:07,202
Elmer, honey? It's Lulu.

1342
01:43:08,712 --> 01:43:10,954
- Who?
- I just called to say thanks

1343
01:43:11,090 --> 01:43:13,960
for gettin' me out of that jam last night.

1344
01:43:19,973 --> 01:43:22,724
What's the address?

1345
01:43:22,850 --> 01:43:27,014
Mr. Gantry, I just had to congratulate you.
You were marvellous last night.

1346
01:43:27,146 --> 01:43:29,816
Last night? Oh. Yes.

1347
01:43:35,613 --> 01:43:37,985
- Get hold of Benny.
- Now, wait a minute.

1348
01:43:38,116 --> 01:43:41,615
- This Gantry bum's a preacher.
- Get hold of Benny.

1349
01:43:47,083 --> 01:43:48,708
OK.

1350
01:44:02,931 --> 01:44:05,303
Are these pictures for
divorce or blackmail?

1351
01:44:05,434 --> 01:44:08,351
- Benny, come on!
- Remember, position is everything.

1352
01:44:08,478 --> 01:44:09,558
No!

1353
01:44:09,688 --> 01:44:14,184
Without any flash powder, you gotta get
this guy to freeze for a couple of seconds.

1354
01:44:14,318 --> 01:44:18,814
Time exposure takes time.
So keep him still... and quiet.

1355
01:44:18,947 --> 01:44:21,865
- But that's so dull!
- And keep the radio playin'.

1356
01:44:21,992 --> 01:44:24,993
- So he don't hear this.
- (camera clicks)

1357
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:26,365
- OK?
- OK.

1358
01:44:26,496 --> 01:44:28,121
OK, OK. Let's go!

1359
01:44:32,336 --> 01:44:36,120
Hey, chick. This preacher fella.
You think you could get him into bed?

1360
01:44:36,256 --> 01:44:38,415
- Are you kiddin'?
- (knocking at door)

1361
01:44:38,550 --> 01:44:40,626
Hey, Benny. Come on!

1362
01:44:45,557 --> 01:44:47,182
(knocking)

1363
01:44:49,019 --> 01:44:50,643
(knocking)

1364
01:44:53,981 --> 01:44:55,606
(knocking)

1365
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:16,832
- You look swell, kid.
- Likewise.

1366
01:45:16,963 --> 01:45:19,002
Just swell.

1367
01:45:28,516 --> 01:45:31,185
- Sorry about last night.
- Forget it.

1368
01:45:35,773 --> 01:45:39,771
- If I'd known I'd run into you, I'd have...
- Oh, that's OK.

1369
01:45:51,455 --> 01:45:53,946
- What the hell's the big idea?
- Elmer, honey...

1370
01:45:54,083 --> 01:45:58,330
- You think I'll sit still for a shakedown?
- How could I put the squeeze on you?

1371
01:45:58,462 --> 01:46:02,543
- Who'll take the word of a hooker?
- The old badger game, huh?

1372
01:46:02,675 --> 01:46:05,676
- I only wanted to see you for...
- For what?

1373
01:46:05,803 --> 01:46:08,045
- Well, for...
- For what?

1374
01:46:09,181 --> 01:46:14,805
Gee, honey, look. Look, I'm almost
packed. The cops gave me notice.

1375
01:46:14,937 --> 01:46:17,607
I got a ticket on the midnight bus.

1376
01:46:30,911 --> 01:46:33,151
I got no beef against you.

1377
01:46:34,288 --> 01:46:37,242
I only wanted to see you once more,

1378
01:46:37,374 --> 01:46:41,502
kick around some old memories,
maybe have a few laughs.

1379
01:46:41,629 --> 01:46:43,668
Go on.

1380
01:46:48,594 --> 01:46:50,800
Who am I kiddin'?

1381
01:46:52,222 --> 01:46:56,719
When you first hit town, I figured
you could go to hell without my help.

1382
01:46:56,852 --> 01:47:00,720
When you came bustin' in last night
like God Almighty wearin' a tin star,

1383
01:47:00,856 --> 01:47:06,017
I got mad, boilin' mad. All I could think of
was how you took me and ditched me.

1384
01:47:06,153 --> 01:47:09,902
That's all I could think of.
Me, little Miss Lulu, the dumb pushover.

1385
01:47:10,032 --> 01:47:12,784
And when the cops said
"Get out of town in 24 hours",

1386
01:47:12,910 --> 01:47:15,235
all I wanted to do was spit in your eye,

1387
01:47:15,371 --> 01:47:18,905
blackmail you, a shakedown -
anything to hurt you.

1388
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:23,085
But...

1389
01:47:24,713 --> 01:47:27,383
But when you walked in just now...

1390
01:47:29,635 --> 01:47:32,090
Gee, honey...

1391
01:47:32,221 --> 01:47:35,720
it was like the first time
between us all over again.

1392
01:47:37,309 --> 01:47:39,765
All goose pimples and...

1393
01:47:44,441 --> 01:47:46,564
You'd better beat it.

1394
01:47:48,612 --> 01:47:50,854
I'm sorry I phoned.

1395
01:47:51,865 --> 01:47:55,032
I won't make any trouble.
Not even if I could.

1396
01:47:58,581 --> 01:48:00,822
Please go now.

1397
01:48:04,961 --> 01:48:08,377
I did run out on you
back there in Kansas, didn't I?

1398
01:48:09,674 --> 01:48:13,375
It's nobody's fault.
Except maybe my old man's.

1399
01:48:13,511 --> 01:48:16,263
- Ever hear from him?
- Once, last Christmas.

1400
01:48:16,389 --> 01:48:21,728
The letter said "Daughter, read
1st Kings, Chapter 21, Verse 23. "

1401
01:48:21,853 --> 01:48:27,096
I looked it up. It said "And the dogs
in the street shall eat Jezebel. "

1402
01:48:28,943 --> 01:48:31,315
My old man and his Bible.

1403
01:48:32,947 --> 01:48:34,987
Tell me...

1404
01:48:35,825 --> 01:48:39,241
how is it some people can
only find hate in the Bible?

1405
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:48,459
- Where will you be going to?
- I think I'll go tramping through Paris.

1406
01:48:48,588 --> 01:48:51,672
Can you use some cash?
Sort of tide you over?

1407
01:48:56,804 --> 01:48:59,556
Just... just kiss me goodbye.

1408
01:49:00,892 --> 01:49:02,766
Just once.

1409
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:48,350
What's she doin'?

1410
01:49:58,531 --> 01:50:00,570
Stay awhile.

1411
01:50:02,743 --> 01:50:04,783
Talk to me.

1412
01:50:06,122 --> 01:50:08,909
Oh, don't go yet. Please don't go.

1413
01:50:11,669 --> 01:50:13,875
Tell me anything.

1414
01:50:14,005 --> 01:50:17,587
Tell me a good, strong lie
I can believe, but hold me.

1415
01:50:17,717 --> 01:50:20,671
Just hold me like you used to.

1416
01:50:20,803 --> 01:50:22,428
Please.

1417
01:50:37,069 --> 01:50:39,358
- No use, Lu.
- Why?

1418
01:50:39,488 --> 01:50:41,528
Because I...

1419
01:50:42,408 --> 01:50:46,655
- I don't know. I...
- Because of what? Because of her?

1420
01:50:46,787 --> 01:50:48,447
That Bible broad?

1421
01:51:06,432 --> 01:51:08,970
I'm sorry. No hard feelings.

1422
01:51:10,102 --> 01:51:13,305
- Please. Don't go yet.
- Lu, I...

1423
01:51:13,438 --> 01:51:17,815
You know, I... I could use
some of that cash after all.

1424
01:51:18,777 --> 01:51:24,897
Why, sure. Maybe I could send you some
from time to time. Till you get a job, or...

1425
01:51:25,033 --> 01:51:28,283
or maybe meet some nice
respectable man, huh?

1426
01:51:28,411 --> 01:51:31,282
I meet nice respectable men every night.

1427
01:51:36,503 --> 01:51:38,875

- Likewise, hon.

Class. She's got real class.

1430
01:52:11,745 --> 01:52:14,283
Wake up! Wake up, Miss Katie Jones!

1431
01:52:15,791 --> 01:52:20,833
You see before you the captain of the
SS Happiness, fishing boat extraordinary.

1432
01:52:20,963 --> 01:52:24,581
All aboard for a glorious,
carefree, happy cruise.

1433
01:52:24,717 --> 01:52:28,168
Fun, fish, frolic... and romance.

1434
01:52:28,888 --> 01:52:30,547
Guaranteed.

1435

Bill! Not one word, not one, about legal
documents, tents, moneys or lost souls.

1439
01:53:00,168 --> 01:53:03,703
We're going on a picnic, see,
and if you squeal, we'll rub you out.

1440
01:53:03,838 --> 01:53:06,080
Do you think I'd rat on a couple of pals?

1441
01:53:06,215 --> 01:53:08,588
It will be all right, won't it, for one day?

1442
01:53:08,718 --> 01:53:11,719
In that outfit, the fish'll jump
into the boat to look at you.

1443
01:53:11,846 --> 01:53:13,471
Yes.

1444
01:53:14,599 --> 01:53:17,553
We're going! We're going on a picnic!

1445
01:53:18,645 --> 01:53:21,729
I've been promising
to take her on a picnic.

1446
01:53:23,274 --> 01:53:26,228
You got that look, Bill. What's the matter?

1447

Elmer the Great. Elmer the Grifter.

The con man conned with
the oldest badger game in the world.

1449

- I don't want Shara to see these.
- She'll have to.

1450
01:53:48,508 --> 01:53:52,719
Bill, I'll do anything you say.
I'll... I'll quit. I...

1451
01:53:53,471 --> 01:53:56,009
- Don't let Shara see these.
- She's got to see them.

1452
01:53:56,349 --> 01:54:00,975
Darling, don't you think we ought
to take Bill on the picnic with us?

1453
01:54:40,766 --> 01:54:42,391
I...

1454
01:54:45,187 --> 01:54:48,722
- I suppose they're for sale?
- $25,000.

1455
01:54:51,068 --> 01:54:53,191
25,000.

1456
01:54:53,613 --> 01:54:56,982
Two o'clock today. Cash. In small bills.

1457
01:54:57,116 --> 01:55:01,410
And she wants Shara
to bring her the money, nobody else.

1458
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:08,742
Her name is Lulu Bains.

1459
01:55:20,181 --> 01:55:22,220
Get the money.

1460
01:55:25,645 --> 01:55:29,594
One more thing. She wants you to bring
the money to 721 Lombard Street.

1461
01:55:29,732 --> 01:55:32,935
That's where she worked

May I have the negatives, please?

Extra, Jack!

1472
01:57:56,918 --> 01:58:01,746
Yeah. Yeah, I read the story,
I saw the pictures.

1473
01:58:01,881 --> 01:58:04,752
- Thank you very much.
- Did you see this?

1474
01:58:06,135 --> 01:58:08,175
I saw it.

1475
01:58:08,805 --> 01:58:11,343
- Did you see this?
- Yeah.

1476
01:58:11,474 --> 01:58:14,760
Now, I understand she brought
these pictures to you first.

1477
01:58:14,894 --> 01:58:16,768
- Yeah.
- And you turned her down?

1478
01:58:16,896 --> 01:58:18,521
Mm-hm.

1479
01:58:22,485 --> 01:58:24,110
Why?

1480
01:58:25,154 --> 01:58:29,448
These pictures prove only one thing -
that Gantry's as human as anybody else.

It's the obligation of a free press to print...

1482
01:58:32,161 --> 01:58:36,740
You're right, Mr. Eddington. A free press
can print anything, including lies.

1483
01:58:36,874 --> 01:58:41,501
And that's exactly what
that pornography is: blackmailing lies.

Thank you for coming here tonight.

1489
01:59:41,271 --> 01:59:44,605
You have every right to an explanation.

1490
01:59:45,275 --> 01:59:47,813
I will try to give it to you.

1491
01:59:48,153 --> 01:59:50,441
Tell us about sin, Sister!

1492
01:59:50,571 --> 01:59:53,821
(woman) Antichrist! You Judas, you!

1493
01:59:53,950 --> 01:59:56,156
- You false prophet!
- You faker, you!

1494
01:59:56,285 --> 01:59:58,278
- Boo!
- Yeah!

1495
01:59:58,412 --> 02:00:03,869
- Liar! Damn your own soul, Mr. Gantry!
- You call yourself a preacher?

1496
02:00:08,297 --> 02:00:10,124
Come on, Rachel.

1497
02:00:16,013 --> 02:00:18,136
Rachel, you've gotta get outta here.

1498
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:21,932
(trumpeter plays jazz version
of "Onward Christian Soldiers")

1499
02:01:02,142 --> 02:01:04,514
Hey, Mr. Gantry!

1500
02:01:38,511 --> 02:01:40,551
(phones ringing)

1501
02:01:58,448 --> 02:02:01,069
- Hello?
- My name is Mrs. Welmer

1502
02:02:01,201 --> 02:02:03,870
I go to church every Sunday

1503
02:02:05,330 --> 02:02:07,786
You tell that Sister Sharon

1504
02:02:20,386 --> 02:02:24,715
- Get outta town, preacher woman!
- Go home, Sister!

1505
02:02:24,848 --> 02:02:26,888
- Poor Sister!
- (laughter)

1506
02:02:35,275 --> 02:02:37,600
O my God...

1507
02:02:39,153 --> 02:02:41,395
why hast thou forsaken me?

1508
02:02:46,327 --> 02:02:48,534
We'll take you home.

1509
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:22,943
Why'd you do it?

1510
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:26,238
Did... did she show with the money?

1511
02:03:27,327 --> 02:03:28,951
Well?

1512
02:03:30,288 --> 02:03:31,912
Yes.

1513
02:03:34,292 --> 02:03:37,459
Why didn't you go through with it? Why?

1514
02:03:39,881 --> 02:03:42,123
You wouldn't understand.

1515
02:03:50,225 --> 02:03:53,843
I know. You took
the pictures to the paper

1516
02:03:53,978 --> 02:03:56,729
cos they were gonna pay you more, huh?

1517
02:03:56,855 --> 02:03:58,931
How much did you get for 'em?

1518
02:03:59,066 --> 02:04:00,774
Nothing.

1519
02:04:00,901 --> 02:04:02,940
I didn't sell them.

1520
02:04:06,531 --> 02:04:09,201
You were never gonna sell 'em...

1521
02:04:09,326 --> 02:04:12,280
not even to that Sister woman, were you?

1522
02:04:12,412 --> 02:04:15,366
You hate Gantry that much?

1523
02:04:15,499 --> 02:04:18,120
Or do you love him that much?

1524
02:04:22,506 --> 02:04:25,127
And you're no good to me.

1525
02:04:25,259 --> 02:04:27,584
Or yourself.

1526
02:04:27,719 --> 02:04:30,175
You're no good to anybody!

1527
02:04:31,223 --> 02:04:32,717
(slap)

1528
02:04:32,933 --> 02:04:33,846
(slap)

1529
02:04:43,610 --> 02:04:46,280
Don't you know that hurts?

1530
02:06:05,941 --> 02:06:08,514
I'm sorry, Lu.

1531
02:06:08,652 --> 02:06:11,024
I'm sorry for everything.

1532
02:07:08,085 --> 02:07:10,327
Brothers and sisters...

1533
02:07:12,172 --> 02:07:13,631
goodbye.

1534
02:07:13,757 --> 02:07:14,837
Amen.

1535
02:07:17,177 --> 02:07:18,292
Jim boy!

1536
02:07:18,429 --> 02:07:21,430
You look like a man
who could use a drink.

1537
02:07:21,557 --> 02:07:27,311
Booze. You know somethin', Jim?
There oughta be a law against drinkin'.

1538
02:07:27,438 --> 02:07:30,723
- There is. Prohibition.
- That's against sellin', not drinkin'.

1539
02:07:30,858 --> 02:07:32,269
Amen.

1540
02:07:33,110 --> 02:07:35,648
- Happy days!
- I'll drink to that.

1541
02:07:37,573 --> 02:07:39,612
God, that's good.

1542
02:07:42,161 --> 02:07:44,568
Would you look at this place, Jim?

1543
02:07:47,291 --> 02:07:50,540
What were they so mad about, anyhow?

1544
02:07:50,668 --> 02:07:54,168
The mob don't like
their gods to be human.

1545
02:07:54,297 --> 02:07:57,630
- They hurt you?
- Not as much as you hurt me.

1546
02:07:57,759 --> 02:08:00,332
Nothing personal.

1547
02:08:00,470 --> 02:08:03,221
What'll you do now?

1548
02:08:03,348 --> 02:08:07,559
Well, the way I got it figured, you're up,
you're down, you sin, you're saved.

1549
02:08:07,685 --> 02:08:11,185
You do the best you can,
and you leave the rest to the Lord.

1550
02:08:11,314 --> 02:08:14,019
You really do believe
in the Lord, don't you?

1551
02:08:14,150 --> 02:08:18,942
Damn right I do. It does a man good
to get down on his knees once in a while.

1552
02:08:19,072 --> 02:08:21,479
That's why people
come to a place like this,

1553
02:08:21,616 --> 02:08:26,444
because they're scared, or sick,
or... because they got no money,

1554
02:08:26,579 --> 02:08:30,280
or too much money.
Or before a war, or after a war.

1555
02:08:32,210 --> 02:08:36,338
Praying's the cheapest
first-rate medicine I know.

1556
02:08:36,464 --> 02:08:38,920
That's why Shara was so good for them.

1557
02:08:41,552 --> 02:08:43,793
She's a lotta woman.

1558
02:08:45,973 --> 02:08:47,597
Yeah.

1559
02:08:49,059 --> 02:08:51,384
You oughta marry her.

1560
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:56,680
- You believe in holy matrimony?
- I can recommend it, never having tried it.

1561
02:08:57,776 --> 02:09:00,148
Too late now, Jim boy.

1562
02:09:01,154 --> 02:09:03,194
Maybe not.

1563
02:09:04,116 --> 02:09:08,113
Miss Bains was waiting for me
at the paper with that story.

1564
02:09:20,215 --> 02:09:23,133
- How'd you get her to do it?
- I didn't.

1565
02:09:25,637 --> 02:09:28,508
The Lord sure moves in mysterious ways.

1566
02:09:35,606 --> 02:09:40,149
Any minute now, you will hear
the voice of Sister Sharon Falconer,

1567
02:09:40,277 --> 02:09:42,685
but not that, I'm afraid, of Elmer Gantry.

1568
02:09:43,030 --> 02:09:46,564
For Mr. Gantry has completely vanished
since three nights ago.

1569
02:09:46,700 --> 02:09:49,950
I've checked the police,
hospitals, railroads, bus depots...

1570
02:09:50,078 --> 02:09:51,621
Where is he? Where?

1571
02:09:51,747 --> 02:09:56,872
Every wire service in the country's asking
the same question. He's page-one news.

1572
02:09:57,002 --> 02:10:00,086
If anything happened to him,
you'd know it.

1573
02:10:04,551 --> 02:10:06,176
Yes.

1574
02:10:07,304 --> 02:10:09,546
Yes, I would know it.

1575
02:10:11,934 --> 02:10:16,062
He'll be here, I'm... I'm sure of it.
We'll wait for him.

1576
02:10:16,188 --> 02:10:21,691
We can't wait. Some of those people
have been out there since early morning.

1577
02:10:21,817 --> 02:10:25,317
- I won't go on without him.
- Maybe he won't be back.

1578
02:10:27,823 --> 02:10:29,862
Just a feeling.

1579
02:10:34,246 --> 02:10:36,203
We'll wait for him.

1580
02:10:41,836 --> 02:10:44,921
(congregation sings
"Onward Christian Soldiers")

1581
02:11:08,697 --> 02:11:10,321
Elmer?

1582
02:11:16,496 --> 02:11:18,240
Oh, darling!

1583
02:11:18,373 --> 02:11:20,116
Darling!

1584
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:23,787
- Gantry's back.
- How do you know?

1585
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:27,621
Somebody just saw him.
Where's a phone around here?

1586
02:11:28,300 --> 02:11:32,167
- What about your friend Gantry?
- Quite a guy! Son of a...

1587
02:11:32,304 --> 02:11:34,545
(band plays fanfare)

1588
02:11:36,641 --> 02:11:38,930
Let me look at you.

1589
02:11:39,060 --> 02:11:42,061
Three endless days without a word.

1590
02:11:42,188 --> 02:11:43,932
Why?

1591
02:11:44,065 --> 02:11:47,600
Don't you realise how much I need you?

1592
02:11:50,405 --> 02:11:53,239
Are you angry? With me?

1593
02:11:53,365 --> 02:11:56,651
- No, Shara.
- Don't ever leave me again. Ever.

1594
02:11:58,370 --> 02:12:00,328
Shara.

1595
02:12:00,456 --> 02:12:02,080
Yes?

1596
02:12:03,334 --> 02:12:05,706
What would happen if we chucked it all,

1597
02:12:05,836 --> 02:12:10,000
beat it across the state line,
get good and married, like most folks?

1598
02:12:10,132 --> 02:12:14,461
Have a bunch of kids, take 'em
to a ball game like most folks.

1599
02:12:14,595 --> 02:12:19,636
Go dancin'. We've never gone
dancin' together, not even once.

1600
02:12:19,767 --> 02:12:22,222
Let's do it, Shara. Tonight. Right now.

1601
02:12:22,353 --> 02:12:25,852
- But all those people...
- If they wanna pray...

1602
02:12:26,732 --> 02:12:29,305
let 'em go to church.

1603
02:12:29,443 --> 02:12:31,068
But...

1604
02:12:32,571 --> 02:12:34,813
this is their church.

1605
02:12:37,368 --> 02:12:39,325
Look!

1606
02:12:39,453 --> 02:12:41,659
Look! A shooting star!

1607
02:12:42,873 --> 02:12:44,533
It's a sign,

1608
02:12:44,667 --> 02:12:48,201
an omen for the glory that begins tonight.

1609
02:12:49,713 --> 02:12:51,587
Ready, Shara.

1610
02:12:51,715 --> 02:12:56,212
(choir)? Glory, glory, hallelujah

1611
02:12:56,428 --> 02:12:59,465
# Glory, glory, hallelujah

1612
02:12:59,598 --> 02:13:01,009
Wish me luck.

1613
02:13:01,141 --> 02:13:05,139
# Glory, glory, hallelujah

1614
02:13:05,271 --> 02:13:11,687
# His truth is marching on

1615
02:13:15,446 --> 02:13:18,447
If you believe in the faith
of your own Sister Sharon...

1616
02:13:18,575 --> 02:13:19,488
Yes!

1617
02:13:19,617 --> 02:13:22,239
. . if you believe in
the innocence of Elmer Gantry...

1618
02:13:22,370 --> 02:13:23,568
Yes!

1619
02:13:23,705 --> 02:13:27,239
- . . and if you believe in God Almighty...
- Yes!

1620
02:13:27,374 --> 02:13:30,660
. . reassure them with
a mighty "hallelujah"!

1621
02:13:30,794 --> 02:13:32,372
(loud cheering)

1622
02:13:51,356 --> 02:13:54,061
- Hallelujah, Sister!
- Hallelujah!

1623
02:14:12,502 --> 02:14:14,376
At this very moment,

1624
02:14:15,130 --> 02:14:19,424
the power of the Holy Ghost
has descended on this tabernacle.

1625
02:14:21,970 --> 02:14:24,010
He is here.

1626
02:14:24,932 --> 02:14:26,971
Here right now.

1627
02:14:27,267 --> 02:14:32,475
Just now, across the heavens,
towards the end of the world,

1628
02:14:32,981 --> 02:14:34,641
I saw an omen...

1629
02:14:35,150 --> 02:14:40,061
a fiery line written by the hand of God,
a glorious shooting star.

1630
02:14:41,031 --> 02:14:44,067
Thus, God has told us of his coming.

1631
02:14:44,785 --> 02:14:49,612
Have we lost God? Have we lost
contact with the supernatural?

1632
02:14:49,957 --> 02:14:54,250
Have we lost faith? Because
without faith, we are morally sick.

1633
02:14:54,586 --> 02:14:58,370
Faith... is the strongest force in the world.

1634
02:14:58,507 --> 02:15:00,630
Faith can raise the dead.

1635
02:15:00,759 --> 02:15:04,044
Faith can heal. Faith is the...

1636
02:15:04,178 --> 02:15:06,669
Help me, Sister! Help me!

1637
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:09,679
Help me.

1638
02:15:10,768 --> 02:15:13,306
He can't hear, Sister. He's deaf.

1639
02:15:14,939 --> 02:15:17,512
Let him alone, please.

1640
02:15:28,953 --> 02:15:31,622
Help me, Sister.

1641
02:15:31,747 --> 02:15:34,155
Heal me.

1642
02:15:34,292 --> 02:15:36,368
(Morgan) You should take him to a doctor.

1643
02:15:36,502 --> 02:15:39,124
God is the greatest healer of all.

1644
02:15:39,839 --> 02:15:41,630
Was he born deaf?

1645
02:15:41,757 --> 02:15:45,458
A storm woke him up one night. He
screamed he couldn't hear the thunder.

1646
02:15:45,595 --> 02:15:48,595
- He could feel it but he couldn't hear it.
- You're his wife?

1647
02:15:48,723 --> 02:15:51,806
Yes, Sister. I'm sorry to trouble you.

1648
02:16:04,279 --> 02:16:08,193
Do you believe in the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost?

1649
02:16:12,120 --> 02:16:16,414
Do you believe that Jesus
could heal by the laying on of hands,

1650
02:16:16,750 --> 02:16:20,700
and that he passed
this gift on to his disciples?

1651
02:16:22,005 --> 02:16:24,211
Pray with me, everyone.

1652
02:16:24,341 --> 02:16:27,674
Please pray with me. I need your faith.

1653
02:16:31,014 --> 02:16:33,386
O Lord...

1654
02:16:33,516 --> 02:16:36,553
O God, be merciful.

1655
02:16:41,190 --> 02:16:42,601
Heal.

1656
02:16:43,442 --> 02:16:44,640
Heal.

1657
02:16:50,533 --> 02:16:52,988
O God, help us in our weakness.

1658
02:16:53,911 --> 02:16:57,410
Punish us for our sins,
but reward us for our faith.

1659
02:17:01,293 --> 02:17:02,372
Heal.

1660
02:17:03,587 --> 02:17:05,212
Heal.

1661
02:17:08,884 --> 02:17:12,633
Let thy spirit fill this tabernacle.

1662
02:17:13,264 --> 02:17:16,549
Let thy holiness bless this house,

1663
02:17:16,934 --> 02:17:19,686
created for thy glory,

1664
02:17:19,812 --> 02:17:22,481
and thine alone.

1665
02:17:27,152 --> 02:17:28,528
Heal!

1666
02:17:28,654 --> 02:17:30,896
Pray for God to heal!

1667
02:17:31,031 --> 02:17:32,194
Heal!

1668
02:17:34,451 --> 02:17:36,491
God...

1669
02:17:43,878 --> 02:17:46,333
Can you hear me?

1670
02:17:49,091 --> 02:17:51,131
God, I...

1671
02:17:51,886 --> 02:17:54,886
I... I think I...

1672
02:17:57,683 --> 02:18:01,894
- Repeat after me. Blessed is the Lord.
- Blessed is the Lord.

1673
02:18:02,021 --> 02:18:06,433
- We thank thee, O Lord, for thy mercy.
- We thank thee, O Lord.

1674
02:18:07,401 --> 02:18:09,441
I can hear.

1675
02:18:10,404 --> 02:18:13,737
O God... I can hear!

1676
02:18:13,865 --> 02:18:17,364
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

1677
02:18:17,493 --> 02:18:20,613
(choir sings "The Hallelujah Chorus")

1678
02:18:50,943 --> 02:18:53,019
Please wait. Please wait.

1679
02:18:53,946 --> 02:18:56,401
Don't... don't... don't get excited.

1680
02:18:58,075 --> 02:19:00,198
Oh, my God.

1681
02:19:03,163 --> 02:19:06,828
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Take care of the others, please.

1682
02:19:06,959 --> 02:19:09,414
You're in the house of God!

1683
02:19:25,852 --> 02:19:29,933
Those who believe in God will be saved.
Trust in the Lord!

1684
02:19:30,065 --> 02:19:32,223
Oh! Oh!

1685
02:20:07,810 --> 02:20:10,764
Are you all right, Shara? Shara? Shara?

1686
02:20:17,987 --> 02:20:20,858
- No. No. No. No. No!
- Shara!

1687
02:20:25,119 --> 02:20:26,744
Help!

1688
02:20:27,872 --> 02:20:29,070
No, please wait.

1689
02:20:31,584 --> 02:20:34,122
No, wait! Please, wait!

1690
02:20:44,764 --> 02:20:47,385
Wait! You must have faith!

1691
02:20:47,516 --> 02:20:49,556
- Wait!
- Shara!

1692
02:20:51,938 --> 02:20:52,969
Shara!

1693
02:20:55,608 --> 02:20:57,316
Shara!

1694
02:20:57,902 --> 02:20:59,313
Shara!

1695
02:21:00,655 --> 02:21:02,694
Shara! Shara!

1696
02:21:04,951 --> 02:21:06,231
Shara! Shara!

1697
02:23:05,527 --> 02:23:07,768
It's hers.

1698
02:23:10,198 --> 02:23:12,440
It's all we could find.

1699
02:24:00,539 --> 02:24:05,913
People everywhere would appreciate a
word from you, Mr. Gantry. Anything at all.

1700
02:24:07,629 --> 02:24:10,500
Speak to us, Mr. Gantry.

1701
02:24:12,926 --> 02:24:15,464
Please ask Sister Sharon to forgive us.

1702
02:24:15,596 --> 02:24:19,011
There ain't nothin' to forgive.
It was mighty hot in there.

1703
02:24:19,141 --> 02:24:21,299
Hotter than the fires of damnation.

1704
02:24:21,435 --> 02:24:23,723
I ran. I was afraid.

1705
02:24:24,813 --> 02:24:27,600
Please ask Sister not to hate me.

1706
02:24:29,985 --> 02:24:32,274
Can you hear me up there, Sister?

1707
02:24:33,447 --> 02:24:35,688
Do you hate these folks?

1708
02:24:36,908 --> 02:24:39,944
She don't hate you. She loves you.

1709
02:24:40,077 --> 02:24:42,782
Praise the Lord and his love.

1710
02:24:42,914 --> 02:24:45,321
And what is love?

1711
02:24:45,458 --> 02:24:48,743
Love is the mornin' and the evenin' star.

1712
02:24:48,878 --> 02:24:51,998
Love is the voice of music. So sing.

1713
02:24:52,131 --> 02:24:54,503
Sing out the Lord's love.

1714
02:24:59,430 --> 02:25:02,550
# I'm on my way

1715
02:25:02,683 --> 02:25:05,850
# Up to Canaan land

1716
02:25:06,812 --> 02:25:10,063
# I'm on my way

1717
02:25:10,191 --> 02:25:13,227
# Up to Canaan land

1718
02:25:14,320 --> 02:25:17,487
# I'm on my way

1719
02:25:17,615 --> 02:25:21,695
# Up to Canaan land

1720
02:25:21,827 --> 02:25:23,405
# On my way

1721
02:25:23,538 --> 02:25:25,198
# Glory, hallelujah

1722
02:25:25,331 --> 02:25:28,000
# I'm on my way

1723
02:25:28,543 --> 02:25:31,994
# It's a mighty hard climb

1724
02:25:32,129 --> 02:25:35,545
# But I'm on my way

1725
02:25:35,675 --> 02:25:38,878
# It's a mighty hard climb

1726
02:25:39,011 --> 02:25:41,051
That was inspired.

1727
02:25:41,889 --> 02:25:45,092
- Think that was inspired, Jim boy?
- I think it was real friendly.

1728
02:25:45,226 --> 02:25:49,010
You know, Shara would...
want you to go on with her work.

1729
02:25:49,146 --> 02:25:52,231
We'll get a tent - a bigger one this time.

1730
02:25:53,568 --> 02:25:57,897
"When I was a child, I spake as a child.
I understood as a child. "

1731
02:25:58,781 --> 02:26:01,319
"When I became a man,
I put away childish things. "

1732
02:26:01,450 --> 02:26:04,736
St. Paul, First Corinthians, 13:11.

1733
02:26:07,915 --> 02:26:10,073
So long, Bill.
