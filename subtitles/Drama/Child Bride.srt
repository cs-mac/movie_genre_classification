4
00:00:25,205 --> 00:00:26,928
What do you see?

5
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:29,159
Are birds flying?

6
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:30,550
Yeah.

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,879
They're flying beyond the sun.
Where are they flying to?

8
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:36,272
I'm sure they're flying
to the world over yonder.

9
00:00:36,272 --> 00:00:38,187
Can you see it?
Take a good look.

10
00:00:38,187 --> 00:00:40,525
No, I can't see.

11
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:42,266
Want me to allow you to see it?

12
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:43,267
Yes.

13
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:47,409
Here. Take a good look.

14
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:53,733
The world we live in is composed of the
our world, and the world over yonder.

15
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:58,716
We live in this world,
and the gods live in that other world.

16
00:00:58,716 --> 00:01:00,076
Gods?

17
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:04,538
<i>The world that the gods live in</i>

18
00:01:04,538 --> 00:01:10,365
<i>is composed of Water Country,
Sky Country, and Earth Country.</i>

19
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:12,909
<i>Those from the Realm of the Gods
send gods over to our world</i>

20
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:16,514
<i>in order to look after the environment
in the human world.</i>

21
00:01:17,604 --> 00:01:20,109
They don't look after
human beings, though?

22
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:23,026
Humans can take care of themselves.

23
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:26,365
<i>The kings of Water Country,
Sky Country, and Earth Country</i>

24
00:01:26,365 --> 00:01:29,865
<i>were fated to be kings from birth.</i>

25
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:33,367
<i>The king of Water Country, in particular</i>

26
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:38,151
<i>is also given the special power of being
the emperor of the Realm of the Gods.</i>

27
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:42,204
<i>The new emperor must bring the three
god stones together and make a royal seal</i>

28
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:44,576
<i>in order to become the next emperor.</i>

29
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:46,802
<i>However, the gods
who have those god stones</i>

30
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:48,836
<i>are the guardian gods
who reside in the human world.</i>

31
00:01:48,836 --> 00:01:50,981
<i>So he has to come here
to find those stones</i>

32
00:01:50,981 --> 00:01:53,413
to become the emperor of the gods?

33
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,891
Yes.

34
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:57,962
What happens if the guardian gods
won't give up the stones?

35
00:01:57,962 --> 00:02:01,634
Well, that's something that
only humans would do.

36
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:04,484
But there's something strange about this.

37
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:08,583
Why did they leave the god stones
in the human world?

38

<i>[The Bride of the Water God]</i>

<i>[One year ago]</i>

43
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:53,406
High Priest.

44
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:56,182
It's about time that the red water came.

45
00:03:56,182 --> 00:04:00,710
Looks like the Realm of the Gods will
welcome a new emperor after 3,200 years.

46
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,735
Where is Lord Habaek?

47
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:39,425
For my lowly self to be given this honor
truly is quite gracious of you, my lord!

48
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:44,324
To think that I'd be
painting a portrait of you...

49
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:50,095
I understand why the heavens chose you
to be the next in line for the throne!

50
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:55,158
It's time... for me to do your eyes, sir.

51
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,021
<i>He's sleeping.</i>

52
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:07,586
The... finishing touches...

53
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:15,165
Lord Habaek.

54
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:17,639
You have a call from the High Priest.

55
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,672
Tell him to stop calling me so much.

56
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:22,730
Why does he have to ask me so many
insignificant things every day?

57
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,035
The water of Water Country
has turned red.

58
00:05:27,956 --> 00:05:30,319
So he said that you
should make preparations.

59
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:44,677
Does the king know about this, too?

60
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,233
He is quite happy.

61
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:49,704
He has been eagerly awaiting
the red water for a long time.

62
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:53,605
I understand how he could be exhausted,
seeing as how he was king for so long.

63
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:57,588
These are the locations of the
guardian gods who have the god stones.

64
00:05:57,588 --> 00:06:00,853
These coordinates will lead you to them.

65
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:06,127
Lord Habaek.

66
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:18,189
Moo Ra will be the god
from Water Country

67
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:20,009
and Joo Dong will be the god
from Earth Country.

68
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:22,319
- Who is the god from Sky Country?
- Lord Bi Ryeom.

69
00:06:23,504 --> 00:06:24,653
Bi Ryeom?

70
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:28,338
We must have the coronation by the
seventh time the red water flows

71
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:32,328
so all you have to do is get the
god stones and return before then.

72
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:33,406
I will return immediately.

73
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:37,774
Why, my lord? The  is
far more interesting than you'd think.

74
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:40,528
You will have quite a lot of time
before the seventh red tide

75
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:42,139
so enjoy yourself while you are there.

76
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:43,336
I have no interest in that.

77
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:50,514
Also, why do such archaic and
meaningless formalities still exist?

78
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:56,603
There is no such thing as a
meaningless thing in this world.

79
00:06:58,504 --> 00:07:01,691
At any rate, the first thing
I will do as king

80
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:04,396
is get rid of these archaic
and meaningless rituals.

81
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:08,425
Yes, go ahead and do that
when you become king.

82
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:12,105
It sounds like you're implying that
I may not be able to become the king.

83
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:13,509
Of course not, my lord.

84
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,879
You were fated to become king
from the moment you were born.

85
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,167
You'd become king even if you
lay still and did nothing.

86
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:25,090
How could that possibly happen
unless your fate were twisted?

87
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,605
What relevance does becoming the emperor
of the Realm of the Gods have with humans

88
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:30,788
that the god stones
are kept in their realm?

89
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:32,043
What a nuisance.

90
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:33,370
Oh ho.

91
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,187
Since you've asked that question...

92
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:40,002
you may linger there and
find the answer for yourself.

93
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:42,711
It isn't a question.

94
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:48,639
Oh, you've heard of the
gods' servants, haven't you?

95
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,040
The humans who have promised
to become the gods' servants

96
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,554
generation after generation?

97
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:55,994
If you get into a tricky situation,
seek out a descendant from this family.

98
00:07:57,105 --> 00:07:59,054
All you need to do is show them this

99
00:07:59,054 --> 00:08:03,530
and exchange a few words with them
for them to accept you as a god.

100
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,406
I do not need it,
since I won't be seeking them out.

101
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:11,934
It is a woman.

102
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:13,704
Shall I show you her face?

103
00:08:13,704 --> 00:08:15,747
She's not from the Shin family.

104
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:17,158
No thanks.

105
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:19,954
Nam Soo Ri will be serving you.

106
00:08:19,954 --> 00:08:23,640
It may be difficult, but please
keep that with you at all times.

107
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,147
And don't just leave it
in your clothes somewhere!

108
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,545
Sky Country is doomed.

109
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:31,905
They've sent Bi Ryeom as
the guardian god of the skies.

110
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:33,962
There's no way he'll carry
out his duties properly.

111
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:35,878
Why do you hate
Lord Bi Ryeom so much, sir?

112
00:08:35,878 --> 00:08:37,478
You were so close as children.

113
00:08:38,348 --> 00:08:39,996
He has no decorum.

114
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:44,127
And... he's not trustworthy.

115
00:08:44,127 --> 00:08:46,549
You'll have to study up on the
human world before you go, sir.

116
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:48,542
That's precisely why
I'm bring you with me.

117
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:51,285
I heard that you've
been to the human world.

118
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:54,618
Well, yes. I do know everything
there is to know about that place.

119
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,546
You'll feel a bit of a shock when
you pass through the Gate of the Gods.

120
00:08:57,546 --> 00:08:59,051
It can actually be kind of addictive.

121
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:03,901
Prepare the finest human clothing for me.
And a present for Moo Ra, too.

122
00:09:07,104 --> 00:09:08,864
Have you seen your servant's face?

123
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:10,085
I heard that it's a woman.

124
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:11,391
Is she pretty?

125
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:12,824
<i>Yes, I see.</i>

126
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:17,758
Aliens from the planet Intro-Q2544
delivered a divine message to me.

127
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:22,141
My leader is TF1004, but this
seemed to be quite an urgent matter.

128
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:24,252
I see. Anything else?

129
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:27,923
On Earth, there are Earth Partners like
me who carry out these divine messages.

130
00:09:27,923 --> 00:09:30,830
There are people who belong to
our organization all over the world.

131
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:33,315
But the strange thing is...

132
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:40,030
why did they deliver this message to me,
instead of a partner in the States?

133
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,077
That's what baffles me.

134
00:09:41,077 --> 00:09:44,176
Yes, I wonder why
it was delivered to you.

135
00:09:47,596 --> 00:09:52,561
Oh, "Tell Obama that
world peace is at risk."

136
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:54,127
That's what this means, huh?

137
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:57,039
Doctor, are you...

138
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,074
What should I do,
since I don't know his address?

139
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:07,141
Do you know about the thing that
came out of the White House?

140
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,415
You don't believe me either,
do you, Doctor?

141
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:26,869
No, of course not. Patient--

142
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:29,061
Patient? Did you just call me a patient?

143
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:34,478
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

144
00:10:34,478 --> 00:10:35,638
Hey!

145
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:38,222
- Patient!
- Who's a patient here, huh?

146
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,642
Um, Ma Bong Yeol.

147
00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:41,743
I'll try to find Obama's address
in any way I can, so--

148
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:42,846
Goodness!

149
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:45,649
Stop lying when you
don't even believe me!

150
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:51,979
Oh... Doctor. Doctor!
Nobody will believe me!

151
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:55,852
- World peace is at risk, here!
- Stop it!

152
00:10:55,852 --> 00:10:58,173
Sir, sir!

153
00:10:58,173 --> 00:11:00,441
Please let go of her before
you continue speaking!

154
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:03,708
It's true that world peace is at risk.

155
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,614
You... understand our language?

156
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:11,866
Of course. Nice to meet you.

157
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,847
Oh, it's nice to meet you!

158
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:19,522
All right, let's go. Let's go.

159
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:22,085
Let's go.

160
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,032
How did you learn his language?

161
00:11:29,032 --> 00:11:30,407
I did some research.

162
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:34,199
His language has a rough system,
just like the alphabet.

163
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:36,007
Bong Yeol is quite
intelligent, after all.

164
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:37,750
He's better off than me.

165
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:42,575
His guardian wanted to
have him checked in here, right?

166
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:44,844
I can't do it. Schedule
another appointment with him.

167
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:47,295
How could you give up so easily, Doctor?

168
00:11:47,295 --> 00:11:48,781
Give up easily?

169
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:51,233
Hey, I've been seeing him for a year now.

170
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:52,649
You think it's easy
for me to admit defeat?

171
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:55,073
Am I supposed to hold on to him
just because of my pride?

172
00:11:56,204 --> 00:11:57,789
I'm worn out, too.

173
00:11:57,789 --> 00:11:58,801
Yes, Doctor.

174
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,948
Here's half of the notices
to you from the banks.

175
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,921
The bank said that they can't
extend your payment due date

176
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:08,146
and they want you to
come in tomorrow.

177
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:09,346
What?

178
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:10,815
Why not?

179
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:12,768
Well, the psychiatric hospital
isn't doing too well

180
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:14,016
and you haven't been
paying the interest on time.

181
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:16,108
Are they telling me to
shut down my practice, then?

182
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:17,638
That's what it sounds like to me.

183
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,654
Leave.

184
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:22,758
Give me your coat.
I'll wash it for you by tomorrow.

185
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:23,829
No thanks.

186
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:26,856
Want me to have a drink with you?

187
00:12:26,856 --> 00:12:28,753
Why would I have a drink with you?

188
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:34,564
Oh yeah, you forgot this before.
It's for your land in Gangwon-do.

189
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:42,130
<i>[Land Tax Notice]
[Taxpayer name: Yoon So Ah]</i>

190
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:46,194
You still haven't sold that land yet?

191
00:12:46,194 --> 00:12:48,893
Who'd buy a useless field of gravel?

192
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,334
Why did they have to leave me
things like this behind?

193
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:53,208
The hospital is behind on
a lot of its bills, too.

194
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,585
I'm sure you've lost half of
the security deposit already.

195
00:12:55,585 --> 00:12:57,806
So why are you sticking by my side?

196
00:12:57,806 --> 00:12:58,988
Just leave!

197
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:01,252
Well, I'm trying to
repay my debts, of course!

198
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:02,944
- After all, you--
- That's enough!

199
00:13:05,064 --> 00:13:06,786
I don't want to hear it.

200
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:15,535
Is that still your dream, Doctor?

201
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:17,040
- To leave Korea?
- Yeah.

202
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,359
As soon as my debts are repaid,
I'm going to go live in Vanuatu.

203
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:24,098
Just get yourself a man who
will take care of your debts for you.

204
00:13:24,098 --> 00:13:25,722
And just live here.

205
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,458
No, I don't want to. I hate Korea.

206
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:32,447
Are you sure that it's
not just men that hate you?

207
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:37,221
Hey. I even once got a diamond ring
from a second-generation heir!

208
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:48,532
Oh, I found it!

209
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:53,761
Geez, why won't he believe me?
I definitely got one!

210
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:58,671
You were still here so that you could
become mine eventually, huh?

211
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,746
Also, what kind of name is An Bin?

212
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:05,061
How childish.

213
00:14:05,518 --> 00:14:09,207
Take care of my bills and the
interest on my loans, okay?

214
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:20,179
Vanuatu, my love.

215
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:44,373
<i>Now that's what I call living life.</i>

216
00:14:51,305 --> 00:14:56,003
I can't even see a single star properly
in this disgusting country, ugh.

217
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,463
Please, please let me get tons of money!

218
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:28,558
Hey, woman.

219
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:30,671
Woman!

220
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:01,386
I will grant you the honor of allowing
you to lend this to me for a bit.

221
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:28,840
Hey, woman.

222
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,128
Wake up!

223
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,883
You shouldn't be sleeping here, right?

224
00:16:37,905 --> 00:16:40,098
What a bothersome woman.

225
00:16:50,347 --> 00:16:51,829
What happened?

226
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,359
What's going on?

227
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:02,360
Ow.

228
00:17:07,383 --> 00:17:08,832
Oh... ow!

229
00:17:10,704 --> 00:17:11,983
Oh man.

230
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,203
Huh?

231
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:39,440
You damned thief!

232
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:45,300
"Thief"? Why, that insolent woman!

233
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:52,370
I'll see you next time.

234
00:17:57,405 --> 00:18:00,048
<i>What in the world happened?</i>

235
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:03,091
<i>Nam Soo Ri.
Where did Nam Soo Ri go?</i>

236
00:18:04,004 --> 00:18:06,105
Lord Habaek! Lord Habaek!

237
00:18:06,105 --> 00:18:07,471
You're safe!

238
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:08,590
What happened?

239
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,575
I don't know. I fell over there.

240
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:14,460
Why do you look like this, sir?

241
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,281
And why are you wearing my clothes?

242
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:18,584
Pardon?

243
00:18:20,004 --> 00:18:22,509
Oh... what's going on?

244
00:18:25,025 --> 00:18:26,663
Trade outfits with me.

245
00:18:27,743 --> 00:18:29,587
This is strange.

246
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:33,186
The location of the Gate of the Gods
is different than last time.

247
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:34,550
Take a good look around.

248
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,807
I heard that this place can change
a lot, even in 10 years' time.

249
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:41,781
No, the land used as the
Gate of the Gods never changes.

250
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:46,186
Then something must have gone wrong
while we were on our way here.

251
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:56,653
Where are the coordinates?

252
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:58,586
What? You don't have them?

253
00:18:59,298 --> 00:19:00,495
Oh no!

254
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:03,955
Oh dear! Geez!

255
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:05,738
Use your divine powers to find them.

256
00:19:19,714 --> 00:19:21,120
Did you find them, my lord?

257
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,768
What's wrong?

258
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:26,277
It's strange.

259
00:19:26,277 --> 00:19:27,774
It feels as if...

260
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:32,268
something seeped out of my body.

261
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:00,326
How could this have happened?

262
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:02,140
How could you have lost
your divine powers?

263
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,788
First, let's return to Water Country.

264
00:20:03,788 --> 00:20:05,130
Take me to another gate.

265
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,196
I can't, my lord.

266
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:09,177
A god who comes here can only return
once he finishes his duties.

267
00:20:09,177 --> 00:20:11,013
I told you to study up...

268
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:13,404
First, let's look for the
descendant of the god's servant.

269
00:20:13,404 --> 00:20:15,393
It's times like these
when we need their help.

270
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:26,142
You don't have it?

271
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:29,428
Oh no! What are we going to do?

272
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:37,819
I'll look for some clothes
to change into first.

273
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,877
- I'm all right.
- Well, I'm not.

274
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:45,084
Don't go anywhere. Stay here.

275
00:20:45,084 --> 00:20:50,244
You can't just act haughty and confident
and give commands to just anyone, okay?

276
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:52,346
All right.

277
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:55,009
Oh, damn it!

278
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:04,267
No, there's no way.

279
00:21:07,742 --> 00:21:10,206
<i>I'm sure that this is only temporary.</i>

280
00:21:10,206 --> 00:21:15,720
<i>I couldn't do as I wished when I
first went to Sky Country, either.</i>

281
00:21:40,804 --> 00:21:43,607
So how close are you, exactly?

282
00:21:45,183 --> 00:21:48,406
How many times do I have to tell you?
I had my diamond ring stolen!

283
00:21:50,304 --> 00:21:52,375
I'm not drunk, okay?

284
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,315
<i>I am Habaek.</i>

285
00:21:54,315 --> 00:21:55,941
Why did I come to the park?

286
00:21:58,245 --> 00:22:02,307
I told you, I came here
to find my diamond ring.

287
00:22:02,307 --> 00:22:04,600
What? Delusional?

288
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,002
Hey.

289
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,316
Where are you now?

290
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:11,502
<i>I am Habaek.</i>

291
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:15,105
Just answer my question, okay?

292
00:22:15,105 --> 00:22:18,139
<i>I am Habaek.</i>

293
00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:20,066
Where are you, you idiot?

294
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:21,663
<i>I am Habaek.</i>

295
00:22:21,663 --> 00:22:24,279
- Where?
- <i>I am Habaek!</i>

296
00:22:38,105 --> 00:22:39,835
That surprised me.

297
00:22:48,204 --> 00:22:50,537
<i>See, I told you that I'm Habaek.</i>

298
00:22:58,204 --> 00:22:59,858
Yeah, it's working fine.

299
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:02,043
There aren't any issues with it.

300
00:23:02,043 --> 00:23:05,846
Turn it off for now. Let's try turning
it on and off two more times or so.

301
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:24,347
<i>It's that woman.</i>

302
00:23:28,704 --> 00:23:31,550
<i>What's going on?
Is he walking toward me?</i>

303
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,278
<i>Do I know him?</i>

304
00:23:49,404 --> 00:23:51,496
<i>No, I don't know him.</i>

305
00:23:56,004 --> 00:23:57,165
Woman.

306
00:23:58,204 --> 00:23:59,990
You were mistaken.

307
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,643
I just borrowed it
for a bit, is all.

308
00:24:01,643 --> 00:24:02,815
Pardon?

309
00:24:04,463 --> 00:24:05,498
Are you talking to me?

310
00:24:05,498 --> 00:24:09,225
If you tell me your name and residence,
I will have Nam Soo Ri compensate you.

311
00:24:11,146 --> 00:24:12,758
What is it that you need?

312
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:16,855
<i>Mental illness can strike anyone
regardless of their appearance, huh?</i>

313
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:21,598
Your family must be quite
worried about you, so go home.

314
00:24:21,598 --> 00:24:22,841
Don't decline. Just tell me.

315
00:24:22,841 --> 00:24:24,144
It's all right.

316
00:24:24,144 --> 00:24:26,230
You dare defy me?

317
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,385
I told you to tell me, not to leave!

318
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,760
<i>Damn it all.</i>

319
00:24:42,506 --> 00:24:44,616
<i>Maybe he's delusional?</i>

320
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,496
I asked you what you needed.

321
00:24:52,811 --> 00:24:54,447
Money?

322
00:24:55,804 --> 00:24:57,506
Money?

323
00:24:59,304 --> 00:25:00,774
Money?

324
00:25:02,392 --> 00:25:03,615
What is that?

325
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,153
It's fine.

326
00:25:06,153 --> 00:25:08,389
Please go home soon. Goodbye.

327
00:25:11,404 --> 00:25:13,756
- Let go of me!
- Your name and place of residence.

328
00:25:14,748 --> 00:25:16,915
I'll report you if you don't let go!

329
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,586
- I said let go!
- Doctor!

330
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:20,595
What are you doing?
I said let go! Ow!

331
00:25:21,463 --> 00:25:23,336
- Ow!
- Whoa, let go, sir!

332
00:25:23,336 --> 00:25:24,578
Don't be like this, sir!

333
00:25:24,578 --> 00:25:27,159
How dare you defy me,
and then do this?

334
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,838
What's wrong with your forehead?

335
00:25:28,838 --> 00:25:30,710
Did you hit her?

336
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,956
No. Let's go.

He has delusions of grandeur.

345
00:26:10,977 --> 00:26:11,977

346
00:26:13,678 --> 00:26:15,572
Our clinic isn't too far,
so stop by sometime.

347
00:26:15,572 --> 00:26:17,489

You know that your life's calling
was to be a psychiatrist, right?

351

always finding you, day or night.

352

Shut it.

353
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:41,238
I bet you'll only meet people like that
at "Banana Boat" or wherever, too.

354
00:26:41,238 --> 00:26:43,102
It'd be better for you not to go.

355
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,263
Still, isn't Korea better--

356
00:26:45,263 --> 00:26:46,665
Where's the closest police station?

357
00:26:46,665 --> 00:26:48,558
Why? Are you going to report him?

358
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,039
- Yeah.
- Take the high road. He's ill.

359
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,008
I'm going to file a report
for my diamond ring.

360
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:55,541
Are you still drunk?

361
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:57,794
They said they'll give you
a call after investigating.

362
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:00,851
Are you mad?

363
00:27:00,851 --> 00:27:03,025
I feel like they don't believe me!

364
00:27:04,194 --> 00:27:08,100
Okay, let's say you did bury a diamond
ring under a tree many years ago.

365
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,120
But you also said that
a shooting star stopped

366
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,573
and went back and forth three times!

367
00:27:11,573 --> 00:27:15,047
And then a robber fell from the sky
and stole the ring from you?

368
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:17,082
And yet, they left your wallet behind?

369
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:18,451
I'm telling you, it's the truth!

370
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:20,744
Do you want a glass of cold water?

371
00:27:20,744 --> 00:27:22,273
Oh wait, she doesn't like cold water.

372
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,715
How about some hot water, then?

373
00:27:27,775 --> 00:27:29,210
Where were you?

374
00:27:30,044 --> 00:27:34,036
I was collecting information from humans
and finding lodgings for tonight.

375
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:36,764
Let us go. I've found us an
adequate place for tonight.

376
00:27:36,764 --> 00:27:38,454
- It's close to the water, too.
- There's no need.

377
00:27:38,454 --> 00:27:40,329
- My powers came back.
- Really?

378
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:45,033
This water behind me heeded
my command and shot upward.

379
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:46,613
I knew it.

380
00:27:46,613 --> 00:27:48,753
All right, then.
Please make that into gold.

381
00:28:08,694 --> 00:28:11,694
This is the closest place to water,
so I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.

382
00:28:11,694 --> 00:28:12,938
Here we are.

383
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:16,200
I already blew it up,
so it's too late.

384
00:28:20,493 --> 00:28:23,637
A human male gave this to me
and told me to visit.

385
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:25,147
You spoke with humans?

386
00:28:25,147 --> 00:28:27,898
Oh, I told you not to
say anything to them.

387
00:28:28,893 --> 00:28:34,094
Happy Psychiatric Clinic,
Nurse Yoo Sang Yoo?

388
00:28:34,094 --> 00:28:36,024
What?

389
00:28:36,024 --> 00:28:38,069
Oh, I was just reading this.

390
00:28:38,069 --> 00:28:40,485
You don't know how to read
the human language, do you?

391
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:49,214
Sleep well, my lord.
I will keep watch over you all night.

392
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:54,542
As for the coordinates,
I'll continue searching once day breaks.

393
00:29:03,694 --> 00:29:06,855
<i>Pretty much anything in the
human world can be solved with money.</i>

394
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:08,338
I asked you what you need.

395
00:29:08,338 --> 00:29:10,563
Money?

396
00:29:10,563 --> 00:29:15,233
It's not "money,"
but "mo-ney," you idiot.

397

from Happy Bank, too.</i>
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

398
00:30:41,869 --> 00:30:43,475
Did you borrow money from there, too?

399
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:45,161
I wasn't the one
who took out that loan.

400
00:30:51,694 --> 00:30:53,271
Yeah.

401
00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:58,800
I wouldn't have been able to take care
of this just by selling a diamond ring.

402
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:02,498
Money?

403
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:05,744
What is that?

404
00:31:09,473 --> 00:31:12,124
Yeah, his mind must be at ease.

405
00:31:13,394 --> 00:31:15,620
That's all you need in life.

406
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:42,892
Let us talk while taking
a walk around the resort.

407
00:31:42,892 --> 00:31:44,437
You start, Food and Beverage Team.

408
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:47,429
We have 300 Chinese guests here today
for the construction of a harbor.

409
00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:49,803
A Chinese heir named
Li Woi will be here.

410
00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:51,185
Please go, CEO, and--

411
00:31:51,185 --> 00:31:53,311
No need for me to go,
since this isn't an official state visit.

412
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,676
What about you,
Business Strategy Team?

413
00:31:54,676 --> 00:31:55,697
Yes, sir.

414
00:31:55,697 --> 00:31:57,284
This is a proposal from
Block Company from England

415
00:31:57,284 --> 00:31:58,697
for the construction of Block World.

416
00:31:58,697 --> 00:32:01,880
There haven't been any changes
to the land we inspected before.

417
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,063
It's not bad, as long as
the issue with the land is settled.

418
00:32:05,063 --> 00:32:06,269
I'll take a look at it.

419
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:07,998
Is your report about
the bank, Intel Team?

420
00:32:07,998 --> 00:32:11,893
Yes, there is a bank that says they will
lower their interest for several loans.

421
00:32:11,893 --> 00:32:14,743
And they wish to have
a meal with you, CEO.

422
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,694
Must I really go?

423
00:32:18,378 --> 00:32:20,712
I think it'd be good for you
to meet them once, sir.

424
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:25,042
<i>Scientists have succeeded in detecting
a second wave of gravitational forces.</i>

425
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:28,989
<i>There may be a third or fourth wave
of gravitational forces coming at us</i>

426
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,402
<i>at this very moment.</i>

427
00:32:30,402 --> 00:32:34,917
<i>The time-space continuum in Seoul

428
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:38,496
<i>Today on "Fascinating Science,"
we'll talk about gravitational forces.</i>

429
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:40,896
You're here, Doctor?

430
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:42,427
No calls from the police station?

431
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,450
None.

432
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:47,396
They say that the time-space continuum
in Seoul may have shifted yesterday.

433
00:32:47,396 --> 00:32:50,707
Do you think that's when the
diamond ring disappeared?

434
00:33:11,793 --> 00:33:14,121
I went to Dongdaemun Market
early this morning to buy it.

435
00:33:14,121 --> 00:33:15,361
Just wear that for now.

436
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:16,665
You should've just gotten some sleep.

437
00:33:16,665 --> 00:33:19,073
A doctor's coat is so
important to a doctor.

438
00:33:19,594 --> 00:33:21,513
- Don't you feel sick?
- I didn't get drunk.

439
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:22,514
What about breakfast?

440
00:33:22,514 --> 00:33:23,967
Again with your nagging.

441
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:25,521
There's nothing for you
to eat at home, right?

442
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:27,473
I'll have to go make
some side dishes for you.

443
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:28,506
Do you have a death wish?

444
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,611
Someone rear-ended
your car last month, right?

445
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:31,867
Named Park Sang Chul.

446
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:32,973
They called again.

447
00:33:32,973 --> 00:33:34,865
I already took care of things
with my insurance company.

448
00:33:34,865 --> 00:33:37,723
I don't know. They said they'd come
to meet you, then said never mind.

449
00:33:37,723 --> 00:33:39,108
It's so confusing.

450
00:33:39,108 --> 00:33:41,169
When are you going to go to the bank?

451
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:43,810
You won't be able to solve this
by pushing it aside it for later.

452
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:44,908
I know that.

453
00:33:47,214 --> 00:33:48,937
Are there any appointments this morning?

454
00:33:48,937 --> 00:33:50,293
Of course not.

455
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:53,184
You don't have any in the afternoon
either, so go whenever you want to.

456
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:03,515
You delayed payment on your
loan's interest many times.

457
00:34:04,082 --> 00:34:07,013
And you haven't taken care of
your credit at all, Customer.

458
00:34:07,013 --> 00:34:10,642
Your income for last month
was far too low.

459
00:34:13,193 --> 00:34:15,086
Please look this over one more time.

460
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,803
I always paid my taxes properly.

461
00:34:16,803 --> 00:34:18,818
I'm only going through
difficulties for the time being.

462
00:34:18,818 --> 00:34:21,167
So many people go to
psychiatric hospitals now.

463
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:26,200
Then... we can start charging you
only seven percent interest

464
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,254
after you repay the first loan

465
00:34:28,254 --> 00:34:31,993
but... I'm not sure if the
Examination Division will accept this.

466
00:34:31,993 --> 00:34:33,566
Seven percent?

467
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:36,780
How can it go up from
four to seven percent?

468
00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:42,649
Please look into this for me, then.

469
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:55,546
Where did that guy go now?

472
00:35:11,622 --> 00:35:14,144
Gosh, why is it taking so long?

473
00:35:16,794 --> 00:35:20,626
Excuse me! Excuse me? Excuse me...

474
00:35:30,937 --> 00:35:34,374
How much longer will it take? I have
a patient waiting for me at the hospital.

475
00:35:34,374 --> 00:35:36,839
Please wait a little bit longer.

476
00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:44,073
Oh my, what do I do? What do I do?

477
00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:49,952
President, did you enjoy your lunch?

478
00:35:49,952 --> 00:35:54,428
Would you like a cup of
Ethiopian hand drip coffee?

479
00:35:54,428 --> 00:35:57,787
If you borrow money from our bank,
we'll offer an interest of one percent...

480
00:35:57,787 --> 00:36:00,459
What? One percent?

481
00:36:03,066 --> 00:36:04,772
Excuse me.

482
00:36:05,812 --> 00:36:08,839
- I told you to wait!
- For how much longer?

483
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:11,908
All I've done is wait
since early this morning.

484
00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:14,903
All I want is an extension on my loan.

485
00:36:14,903 --> 00:36:17,363
Is it really that hard to do?

486
00:36:17,363 --> 00:36:21,028
Why are you going all over the place
with my personal information?

487
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,254
How about... how about you wait outside?

488
00:36:27,254 --> 00:36:28,926
I'm not waiting!

489
00:36:28,926 --> 00:36:32,173
And why do I get seven percent
when he gets one percent?

490
00:36:32,173 --> 00:36:35,135
- Why are you discriminating?
- Well, that's because--

491
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:38,841
I know. I get it. But this is too much!

492
00:36:38,841 --> 00:36:41,658
The difference between seven
and one percent is too much!

493
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,336
Please help her first.

494
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:46,868
We'll continue our talk
through my finance team later.

495
00:36:48,403 --> 00:36:51,441
Wait, President. Don't go...

496
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:54,120
Apologize to the president!

497
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,305
What did you say?

498
00:36:55,305 --> 00:36:59,597
He's upset because
of you rudely butting in!

499
00:37:00,854 --> 00:37:03,218
I don't agree with that.

500
00:37:03,218 --> 00:37:06,330
It's your fault for exposing
my interest rates to another client.

501
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,959
- I think you should apologize.
- Pardon?

502
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:12,968
I'll make a request to the bank
so you can get the loan that you want.

503
00:37:12,968 --> 00:37:14,689
Why would you do that?

504
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,649
It was simply out of
the kindness of my heart.

505
00:37:19,649 --> 00:37:22,664
Then stop harassing the employees
about the interest rates

506
00:37:22,664 --> 00:37:25,394
and work harder to make more money.

507
00:37:34,526 --> 00:37:37,443
Please visit our clinic. Please visit...

508
00:37:37,443 --> 00:37:39,484
Please visit...

509
00:37:42,191 --> 00:37:45,193
Hey, wait! Stop!

510
00:37:46,457 --> 00:37:49,138
Why did you wipe off the bird crap
with our business card?

511
00:37:49,138 --> 00:37:53,539
I mean, why?

512
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:57,133
- What's going on?
- It's nothing.

513
00:37:57,133 --> 00:38:01,008
- What happened?
- Why did you wipe it with our card?

514
00:38:01,008 --> 00:38:02,986
Don't do this.

515
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:08,240
If you contact me separately,
I'll resolve it.

516
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,155
This business card is our face,
and you wiped bird crap with it!

517
00:38:12,155 --> 00:38:14,519
- Stop, let's just go.
- I mean...

518
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:18,832
What are these wipers for?
They're here to clean your windshield!

519
00:38:18,832 --> 00:38:21,062
If your car is big,
is that all that matters?

520
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,789
I'm sorry...

521
00:38:29,077 --> 00:38:31,738
Psychiatric clinic?

522
00:38:31,738 --> 00:38:34,731
I'll contact you after I get a quote.

523
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:53,830
Sir!

524
00:38:56,526 --> 00:38:59,044
What about the coordinates?
Did you find them?

525
00:38:59,696 --> 00:39:03,457
No, I think I lost them
on the streets earlier today.

526
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:04,888
On the streets?

527
00:39:05,497 --> 00:39:07,756
Then there's no hope of finding them.

528
00:39:07,756 --> 00:39:12,316
I guess not. But why did you come out
when I told you to stay home?

529
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:15,667
Home?

530
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,613
I noticed you sleeping well last night.
I thought you were going to stand guard.

531
00:39:23,613 --> 00:39:27,211
I couldn't help it because
I was sleepy and hungry.

532
00:39:27,211 --> 00:39:29,155
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

533
00:39:29,155 --> 00:39:32,426
Newbies like me get hungry,
just like a human.

534
00:39:32,426 --> 00:39:34,725
I'm sure a god like yourself
can't understand.

535
00:39:34,725 --> 00:39:38,129
Do I... have to continue
listening to that?

536
00:39:38,129 --> 00:39:39,707
No.

537
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:44,229
Are you really hungry?

538
00:39:45,401 --> 00:39:47,361
I am.

539
00:39:49,325 --> 00:39:51,147
I'm sorry.

540
00:39:51,147 --> 00:39:54,611
This is all because I lost my powers.

541
00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:58,104
I can't even take care of
a devoted servant like you

542
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,510
so I don't know how I can ever
be a good king in the future.

543
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,624
Excuse me? No, that's not true!

544
00:40:03,624 --> 00:40:06,452
Did you really
expect me to tell you that?

545
00:40:07,524 --> 00:40:11,171
- No.
- But what is that used for?

546
00:40:13,736 --> 00:40:16,582
Oh, that is...

547
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:19,173
It's not food...

548
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:27,109
- Let's go there.
- Pardon? Where?

549
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:30,707
The land of the Gate of the Gods.
It's protected by my servant's descendant

550
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:33,263
so if we go there,
we'll know where to go.

551
00:40:33,263 --> 00:40:35,841
Pardon? Are you going
to meet the descendant?

552
00:40:35,841 --> 00:40:39,908
Giving my servant an
opportunity to fulfill a mission...

553
00:40:39,908 --> 00:40:44,111
As a god, it's my generosity and my duty.

554
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:49,276
What do we do?
Don't those wipers cost millions of won?

555
00:40:49,276 --> 00:40:52,140
I might have to move out
of my one-room apartment.

556
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,211
Then why did you go
into a raging fit like that?

557
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:58,307
Because he wiped bird crap
with our precious business card.

558
00:40:58,307 --> 00:41:01,035
I didn't know you were so devoted.

559
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:06,691
But why did it have to be his car?

560
00:41:10,655 --> 00:41:13,796
Are you calling Secretary Min?
Ask him for a discount.

561
00:41:13,796 --> 00:41:16,004
I'm not calling him.

562
00:41:22,678 --> 00:41:26,964
Gosh, why isn't the real estate agent
answering his phone again?

563
00:41:31,926 --> 00:41:35,133
- I'm going to Gangwon-do.
- Right now?

564
00:41:35,133 --> 00:41:37,477
If you're taking the expressway,
change your tires.

565
00:41:37,477 --> 00:41:41,423
And the oil for your brakes,
and your navigation...

566
00:41:44,138 --> 00:41:46,325
Wipers...

567
00:41:52,073 --> 00:41:54,984
Gosh, why isn't it working?

568
00:41:56,048 --> 00:41:58,870
Don't act like a used navigator, okay?

569
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:02,354
There.

570
00:42:26,397 --> 00:42:29,073
Did you say you're going
to Chungbong Village?

571
00:42:29,073 --> 00:42:32,298
Go straight that way. All the way down.

572
00:42:32,298 --> 00:42:36,361
And when you feel
that it's right, turn left.

573
00:42:36,361 --> 00:42:40,709
Then go straight, and when you
feel like it's right, turn right.

574
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:44,336
If you do that, you'll see it.
Do you understand?

575
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,265
What did that human just say?

576
00:42:57,265 --> 00:42:59,763
Oh, he said we're close.

577
00:42:59,763 --> 00:43:03,193
Don't worry. I've been here
multiple times already.

578
00:43:08,937 --> 00:43:11,363
I didn't get a call
from anyone for five years.

579
00:43:11,363 --> 00:43:14,207
That's why I made a request last time.

580
00:43:14,207 --> 00:43:17,082
I asked you to post some advertisements
and take extra care of it.

581
00:43:17,082 --> 00:43:20,280
Geez, I got it. I got it.

582
00:43:20,964 --> 00:43:24,711
I came here today to lower
the price for an urgent sale.

583
00:43:24,711 --> 00:43:29,111
No matter how cheap it is,
who will buy that useless piece of land?

584
00:43:29,111 --> 00:43:34,238
Sir, you're not wrong, but you shouldn't
say that in front of the land owner.

585
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,930
Fine, are you going to
sell it for half the price?

586
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:39,443
Half...

587
00:43:46,426 --> 00:43:50,591
We were supposed to enter through
that gate. Humans can't see it.

588
00:43:50,591 --> 00:43:53,609
It looks quite shabby
for the Gate of the Gods.

589
00:43:53,609 --> 00:43:56,620
But the descendant of your servant
doesn't know anything. What will we do?

590
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,957
We need to give her the crest
we lost to wake her up naturally.

591
00:43:59,957 --> 00:44:02,823
Don't worry. There are other ways.

592
00:44:02,823 --> 00:44:04,912
Like what?

593
00:44:04,912 --> 00:44:06,700
She'll fall for my charms.

594
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,417
There's no way she won't listen to me.

595
00:44:10,533 --> 00:44:14,925
And if that woman doesn't fall for it,
I'll use my last resort.

596
00:44:14,925 --> 00:44:17,593
And what's that?

597
00:44:18,747 --> 00:44:21,776
Pardon? No, not that, sir.

598
00:44:21,776 --> 00:44:24,399
- Why not?
- That mustn't be used.

599
00:44:24,399 --> 00:44:26,979
We can recover the crest
when we go back.

600
00:44:26,979 --> 00:44:29,385
That way, she'll forget everything.

601
00:44:29,385 --> 00:44:31,410
But not if you use that method.

602
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:35,285
That... will be too difficult
for a human to handle.

603
00:44:35,285 --> 00:44:38,180
Ever since last night,
until this very moment...

604
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,501
you've continued to display foolish acts

605
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:44,905
so what is this foolish thing
you're saying now?

606
00:44:44,905 --> 00:44:48,707
And, above all else,
you lost your powers.

607
00:44:48,707 --> 00:44:51,508
- So will it work?
- Why does it matter?

608
00:44:51,508 --> 00:44:53,678
If I don't have powers, am I not a god?

609
00:44:55,053 --> 00:44:57,464
Then, why don't you act as my master?

610
00:44:57,464 --> 00:45:01,423
How could you say that?
I didn't mean it like that.

611
00:45:01,423 --> 00:45:03,026
Excuse me!

612
00:45:04,941 --> 00:45:07,577
Excuse me, why are you here?

613
00:45:10,673 --> 00:45:12,834
This is my land.

614
00:45:31,048 --> 00:45:32,814
<i>It was you.</i>

615
00:45:34,004 --> 00:45:36,405
Let go! Don't do this!

616
00:45:36,405 --> 00:45:38,705
I am the god of the water,
to-be king of Water Country

617
00:45:38,705 --> 00:45:40,966
and to-be emperor of
the Realm of the Gods!

618
00:45:41,986 --> 00:45:44,106
I am Habaek.

619
00:45:44,106 --> 00:45:46,133
<i>Why is he here?</i>

620
00:45:46,133 --> 00:45:49,725
- Are you the land owner?
- Yes, I am.

621
00:45:51,597 --> 00:45:54,205
- Are you thinking of buying it?
- Why would I buy my own land?

622
00:45:54,205 --> 00:45:55,428
Pardon?

623
00:46:12,104 --> 00:46:15,908
I've looked for you for a
very long time, my servant.

624
00:46:15,908 --> 00:46:18,903
It's so very nice to meet you like this.

625
00:46:18,903 --> 00:46:21,376
Be deeply touched...

626
00:46:23,294 --> 00:46:25,417
that I'm happy to see you.

627
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:37,403
- What the heck are you doing?
- How dare you?

628
00:46:37,403 --> 00:46:40,030
<i>Don't you realize you were
destined to be a psychiatrist?</i>

629
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,705
<i>People who need your help
are always finding you.</i>

630
00:46:42,705 --> 00:46:46,238
I need to see Yeom Mi.
I think it's time to see Yeom Mi.

631
00:46:49,138 --> 00:46:50,863
Sir.

632
00:46:50,863 --> 00:46:53,995
I wish you'd give me a signal
before you did anything.

633
00:46:55,935 --> 00:46:58,816
Hey, Yeom Mi! Do you have time tonight?

634
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,513
No, you need to make time.
Let's meet tonight.

635
00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:05,687
I'm in Gangwon-do right now. Oh my gosh!

636
00:47:06,952 --> 00:47:09,667
<i>What? What happened?</i>

637
00:47:09,667 --> 00:47:12,745
Hey, I'll call you back later.

638
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,506
Are you all right? Let me see.

639
00:47:18,506 --> 00:47:21,573
- Don't worry, I'm fine.
- No, you're not.

640
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:23,823
I don't think I'm okay.

641
00:47:23,823 --> 00:47:25,428
I'm not fine.

642
00:47:37,926 --> 00:47:41,321
<i>Please enter the road
in the three o'clock direction.</i>

643
00:47:42,423 --> 00:47:44,653
I'll drop you off at a nearby hospital.

644
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,408
Let's call the insurance company there.

645
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:49,682
No, I will follow you
wherever you're going.

646
00:47:49,682 --> 00:47:54,133
Excuse me, if he's hurt,
how will he make it to Seoul?

647
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:55,622
And why are you being informal?

648
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:59,506
I don't know what you mean,
but wake up so you can understand.

649
00:47:59,506 --> 00:48:02,334
Everything will be easier
once you understand.

650
00:48:03,138 --> 00:48:04,640
<i>What did he say?</i>

651
00:48:05,408 --> 00:48:08,714
Excuse me, is there a hospital
you visit regularly?

652
00:48:08,714 --> 00:48:12,691
If not, come to our hospital...
What am I saying?

653
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,586
Excuse me.

654
00:48:15,586 --> 00:48:18,111
I'm a doctor, and your friend--

655
00:48:18,111 --> 00:48:20,606
He's not my friend. He's my servant.

656
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,392
Then, your servant...

657
00:48:23,955 --> 00:48:26,751
No, this man...

658
00:48:26,751 --> 00:48:29,231
is completely fine in my opinion.

659
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:32,102
I'm just driving you because
I hit him, so let's cooperate.

660
00:48:32,102 --> 00:48:34,562
I don't know what you're talking about.

661
00:48:37,575 --> 00:48:40,522
This isn't the road I took earlier.

662
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:49,142
<i>Please turn right.</i>

663
00:48:50,903 --> 00:48:53,917
I don't see a road to my right.

664
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,736
<i>Please go straight.</i>

665
00:49:01,736 --> 00:49:04,890
It feels like we're driving
into the mountains.

666
00:49:07,446 --> 00:49:10,470
<i>Please turn right.</i>

667
00:49:11,539 --> 00:49:14,240
<i>Please turn left.</i>

668
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,537
<i>Please drive straight.</i>

669
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:20,102
<i>Please make a U-turn.</i>

670
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,379
<i>Please enter the road
in the 11 o'clock direction.</i>

671
00:49:36,379 --> 00:49:39,506
- I'm going crazy.
<i>- Please be careful of the curb.</i>

672
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,086
<i>Please go straight
in the 12 o'clock direction.</i>

673
00:49:44,086 --> 00:49:46,707
- The road is blocked!
<i>- Please go straight.</i>

674
00:49:46,707 --> 00:49:49,910
- Where am I supposed to go?
<i>- Please go straight.</i>

675
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:51,687
<i>Please drive safely.</i>

676
00:49:58,062 --> 00:50:00,602
- Are you tired?
- Yes.

677
00:50:01,394 --> 00:50:04,718
What... should I do to help?

678
00:50:06,102 --> 00:50:09,680
- Nothing.
- Should I drive?

679
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,760
Do you have a driver's license?

680
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,390
What's that?

681
00:50:19,595 --> 00:50:21,062
No.

682
00:50:21,908 --> 00:50:25,169
Doctors don't let their
patients drive the car.

683
00:50:39,562 --> 00:50:42,341
<i>Please turn right.</i>

684
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:08,948
No!

685
00:51:11,292 --> 00:51:12,381
What's the matter?

686
00:51:12,381 --> 00:51:14,910
This? Her car stopped
because she ran out of gas.

687
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:17,102
Then give her some gas.

688
00:51:17,102 --> 00:51:19,481
How?

689
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:27,060
Lend me your cell phone.

690
00:51:28,269 --> 00:51:31,946
A cell phone. Don't you have one?

691
00:51:39,582 --> 00:51:42,988
Fine, let's walk.
I'm sure we'll run into someone.

692
00:51:42,988 --> 00:51:46,890
We'll borrow a phone and call
the insurance company or buy gas.

693
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:51,044
I don't know what you're saying,
but get some rest.

694
00:51:51,044 --> 00:51:54,504
- Pardon?
- You're tired. Get some rest.

695
00:51:54,504 --> 00:51:56,155
Nam Soo Ri will go by himself.

696
00:51:57,104 --> 00:51:59,470
But, he's hurt.

697
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:01,647
- That's right, I'm hurt.
- No, you're not.

698
00:52:01,647 --> 00:52:04,754
I don't think I'm hurt. I'm not hurt.

699
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:06,236
Go.

700
00:52:07,437 --> 00:52:10,939
No, it'll be quicker if I go.

701
00:52:10,939 --> 00:52:13,993
Oh my! Wait, excuse me!

702
00:52:16,794 --> 00:52:19,475
I don't even know where anything is.

703
00:52:22,783 --> 00:52:26,122
- Excuse me!
- Yes?

704
00:52:26,122 --> 00:52:29,448
This is my license plate number
and insurance policy number.

705
00:52:29,448 --> 00:52:33,528
And this is money for gas... Hold on.

706
00:52:36,124 --> 00:52:37,562
This.

707
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,461
I almost forgot.

708
00:52:42,513 --> 00:52:43,894
Okay.

709
00:53:32,812 --> 00:53:34,905
Why...

710
00:53:34,905 --> 00:53:37,385
am I so unlucky today?

711
00:54:45,305 --> 00:54:46,765
Excuse me!

712
00:54:51,102 --> 00:54:53,140
Wait in the car.

713
00:55:01,709 --> 00:55:04,265
I'm fine out here, so get some rest.

714
00:55:04,265 --> 00:55:07,443
My name is Habaek, not "Excuse me."

715
00:55:07,443 --> 00:55:09,450
I am the god of water,
to-be king of Water Country

716
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,464
and to-be emperor of
the Realm of the Gods.

717
00:55:11,464 --> 00:55:15,013
And I'm your owner...

718
00:55:15,013 --> 00:55:18,876
Habaek.

719
00:55:21,821 --> 00:55:25,084
<i>Gosh, I keep forgetting he's a patient.</i>

720
00:55:26,086 --> 00:55:28,205
Excuse me, Patient...

721
00:55:28,205 --> 00:55:29,796
I mean, Habaek.

722
00:55:29,796 --> 00:55:33,153
Why do you think you're the water god?

723
00:55:33,153 --> 00:55:35,928
What kind of question is that?
Then what about you?

724
00:55:35,928 --> 00:55:38,729
Why do you think of yourself as human?

725
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:46,111
Fine.

726
00:55:46,111 --> 00:55:50,245
Then, what is the god of water?

727
00:55:50,245 --> 00:55:52,629
What are you trying to do with me?

728
00:55:55,347 --> 00:55:58,426
As a human, do you want me
to teach you a lesson?

729
00:55:59,066 --> 00:56:03,086
It seems like you want to talk about
the principles of the world.

730
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:05,343
Listen well.

731
00:56:05,343 --> 00:56:08,312
The god of water, the god of the sky,
and the god of earth.

732
00:56:08,312 --> 00:56:11,207
We're... nature.

733
00:56:11,207 --> 00:56:12,807
I'm...

734
00:56:14,017 --> 00:56:16,439
nature.

735
00:56:18,243 --> 00:56:21,573
- A natural person?
- I'm nature.

736
00:56:21,573 --> 00:56:23,249
A natural person?

737
00:56:23,249 --> 00:56:25,635
I'm nature, and on top of that...

738
00:56:25,635 --> 00:56:28,504
I'm the most natural of nature.

739
00:56:44,468 --> 00:56:47,912
He looks totally normal on the outside.

740
00:56:49,662 --> 00:56:52,238
Stop glancing over.

741
00:56:52,238 --> 00:56:54,477
I can see it with my eyes closed.

742
00:56:56,022 --> 00:56:58,180
I'm very used to getting looks like that.

743
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:02,039
<i>Yes, I'm sure you are.</i>

744
00:57:05,216 --> 00:57:07,921
Do you... have a family?

745
00:57:07,921 --> 00:57:11,028
I could say I do,
and I could say I don't.

746
00:57:11,028 --> 00:57:14,327
We don't have the same family
relations that humans have.

747
00:57:14,327 --> 00:57:17,910
- Then who was that friend--
- I told you, he's my servant.

748
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:20,682
He's like you. Nam Soo Ri is
my servant in the Realm of the Gods

749
00:57:20,682 --> 00:57:23,229
and you're my servant in the human world.

750
00:57:25,222 --> 00:57:28,022
- Look here, Servant.
- Yes?

751
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:32,006
- Excuse me!
- It's Habaek!

752
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:40,073
Do you really need money
more than anything else?

753
00:57:40,073 --> 00:57:41,113
Why?

754
00:57:41,113 --> 00:57:44,892
Why do humans need money so badly?

755
00:57:47,493 --> 00:57:51,314
Because money means happiness.

756
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:56,361
- For you too?
- Yes, why do you ask?

757
00:57:56,361 --> 00:58:00,412
I... think I can do that for you.

758
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:07,381
Not right away,
because of my current circumstances.

759
00:58:08,841 --> 00:58:11,417
<i>Why do I keep falling for it?</i>

760
00:58:13,106 --> 00:58:14,845
Hey, Servant.

761
00:58:14,845 --> 00:58:19,113
If you need money
more than anything else

762
00:58:20,028 --> 00:58:22,236
because money will make you happy

763
00:58:22,236 --> 00:58:25,575
that means what you need is happiness.

764
00:58:28,216 --> 00:58:30,604
What do you really know about me?

765
00:58:30,604 --> 00:58:34,285
However, I have no interest
in the happiness of humans

766
00:58:34,285 --> 00:58:36,756
so I'll reward you with money.

767
00:58:42,423 --> 00:58:44,941
I think we should help him.

768
00:58:50,571 --> 00:58:53,530
- Are we going the right way?
- No.

769
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,582
It looks like we're lost.

770
00:58:56,211 --> 00:58:58,544
You're calmer than I expected.

771
00:58:59,191 --> 00:59:01,004
Of course.

772
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:03,725
Right now, I'm your guardian.

773
00:59:03,725 --> 00:59:06,294
- My guardian?
- Yes.

774
00:59:07,408 --> 00:59:10,821
I might not look the part,
but I'm a doctor.

775
00:59:12,457 --> 00:59:16,888
I hope that subordinate or colleague
of yours went the right way.

776
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:25,941
I don't think this is right.
We should go back.

777
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:29,178
- That's what I wanted to say.
- Excuse me, I'll take the lead.

778
00:59:29,178 --> 00:59:30,970
Hey, Servant!

779
00:59:36,408 --> 00:59:39,738
This is my last warning.
Listen carefully.

780
00:59:39,738 --> 00:59:42,568
I'm Habaek, not "Excuse me."

781
00:59:42,568 --> 00:59:45,229
I am the god of water,
to-be king of Water Country

782
00:59:45,229 --> 00:59:47,798
and to-be emperor
of the Realm of the Gods.

783
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:49,841
Habaek.

784
00:59:59,466 --> 01:00:00,975
Then listen to me.

785
01:00:00,975 --> 01:00:04,249
My name is Yoon So Ah, not "Servant."

786
01:00:04,249 --> 01:00:08,892
And since I'm your guardian,
I'd like you to call me Doctor Yoon

787
01:00:08,892 --> 01:00:12,347
but if you don't like that,
call me Yoon So Ah.

788
01:00:12,347 --> 01:00:14,218
Do you understand?

789
01:00:14,218 --> 01:00:15,988
I see.

790
01:00:31,238 --> 01:00:33,287
- What?
- Run!

791
01:01:23,678 --> 01:01:26,216
Let's get in the car! Oh my!

792
01:01:40,957 --> 01:01:43,810
Let's get in the car! Oh my!

793
01:01:56,687 --> 01:01:58,225
The trunk!

794
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:31,618
Why do we have to be quiet?

795
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:36,243
I think it left.

796
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:40,118
- How are you?
- I'm very uncomfortable.

797
01:02:40,118 --> 01:02:41,472
Pardon?

798
01:02:45,336 --> 01:02:47,464
Don't move. That's even
more uncomfortable.

799
01:02:49,111 --> 01:02:50,530
Okay.

800
01:02:56,164 --> 01:02:59,658
I think it left, so let's open it.

801
01:03:08,669 --> 01:03:11,562
What's... that?

802
01:03:17,046 --> 01:03:18,506
Oh my!

803
01:03:20,126 --> 01:03:24,836
That pig smiled at me!
That pig must be crazy!

804
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,305
Habaek!

805
01:04:26,903 --> 01:04:30,504
- Can you move?
- I need to sit for a while.

806
01:04:31,472 --> 01:04:33,122
What happened?

807
01:04:33,122 --> 01:04:35,763
I was lost and ran into a hunter.

808
01:04:35,763 --> 01:04:38,437
Good thing he was here.

809
01:04:38,437 --> 01:04:41,972
- What about the hunter?
- He went after the pig.

810
01:04:41,972 --> 01:04:43,698
Are you hurt?

811
01:04:59,106 --> 01:05:02,841
Excuse me, I thought you couldn't drive.

812
01:05:02,841 --> 01:05:06,292
- I couldn't.
- Then, what's this?

813
01:05:06,292 --> 01:05:08,274
I'm good at it now.

814
01:05:08,274 --> 01:05:12,060
This is my first time.
But driving is quite fun.

815
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,452
What?

816
01:05:16,341 --> 01:05:19,202
Then, do you really not have a license--

817
01:05:19,202 --> 01:05:21,339
What is this license that you speak of?

818
01:05:21,339 --> 01:05:23,990
Excuse me! Let me drive!

819
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:25,560
Rest!

820
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:29,582
I'm in the middle of gracing you
with a divine blessing.

821
01:05:29,582 --> 01:05:34,001
This is also my generosity
and duty as a god.

822
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:35,410
Excuse me!

823
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:39,620
Don't worry too much.

824
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:44,553
Habaek has abilities that
humans can't even imagine.

825
01:05:44,553 --> 01:05:46,975
I don't care, so stop the car!

826
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,908
Stop the car!

827
01:06:14,908 --> 01:06:16,885
Is this where you live?

828
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:26,740
- Did you trick me?
- Who tricked whom?

829
01:06:30,622 --> 01:06:35,568
Anyway, thank you for
what you did for me today.

830
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:38,307
It happened a long time ago.

831
01:06:41,693 --> 01:06:44,667
A god made a promise with your
ancestor, whose name I don't know.

832
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:48,533
He promised that your family
would forever live as my servants.

833
01:06:48,533 --> 01:06:50,660
It doesn't matter that
you didn't make the promise.

834
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:53,488
If it's what the gods want,
as the descendant of my servant

835
01:06:53,488 --> 01:06:56,064
you must assist me as promised.

836
01:06:57,006 --> 01:06:58,763
Take me to your residence.

837
01:06:59,316 --> 01:07:03,392
No, the hospital will assist you.

838
01:07:03,392 --> 01:07:05,202
If you refuse,
it'll only get harder for you.

839
01:07:05,202 --> 01:07:08,682
It's hard enough as it is,
so I don't care.

840
01:07:08,682 --> 01:07:13,247
You were right. Happiness
might be what I need the most.

841
01:07:13,247 --> 01:07:15,600
Because I'm exhausted.

842
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:19,930
So please... just go.

843
01:07:21,064 --> 01:07:22,823
I'm begging you.

844
01:07:25,981 --> 01:07:30,749
After explaining everything to you,
you haven't awakened.

845
01:07:30,749 --> 01:07:33,352
How slow-witted you are.

846
01:07:33,352 --> 01:07:35,109
Then I have no choice.

847
01:07:35,109 --> 01:07:40,267
Nam Soo Ri, I wasn't going to use
this method because of what you said

848
01:07:40,852 --> 01:07:42,798
but I have no choice.

849
01:07:42,798 --> 01:07:45,370
Habaek, but your powers--

850
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:46,814
Hey, Servant!

851
01:08:02,914 --> 01:08:05,417
I'll grace you with a divine blessing

852
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,039
so you may awaken.

853
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:32,983
Subtitles by illogist

<i>[The Bride of the Water God]</i>

855
01:08:47,736 --> 01:08:50,352
<i>She sneakily pinched my heart
as she entered...</i>

856
01:08:50,352 --> 01:08:52,892
<i>Why did I close my eyes when he did that?</i>

857
01:08:52,892 --> 01:08:56,182
<i>- It feels like a hit on your head.
- No!</i>

858
01:08:56,182 --> 01:08:59,315
<i>- Hey, you dumb woman! Over here!
- He's crazy!</i>

859
01:08:59,315 --> 01:09:01,993
<i>- It was fate.
- You're a god's person now.</i>

860
01:09:01,993 --> 01:09:04,440
<i>- No!
- "God. God. God."</i>

861
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,618
<i>If you don't accept it,
you'll suffer everything.</i>

862
01:09:06,618 --> 01:09:08,887
<i>When he said I'll suffer everything...</i>

863
01:09:08,887 --> 01:09:11,789
<i>- No!
- You'll fall!</i>

864
01:09:11,789 --> 01:09:13,694
<i>Servant!</i>

865
01:09:13,694 --> 01:09:16,423
<i>Please... please save me.</i>

866
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:21,757
- Are we leaving right away?
- Yes, my portrait was disrupted.

867
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:26,467
I know. He just need to dot your eyes.
Why are you punishing him?

868
01:09:29,074 --> 01:09:30,645
Punishing him?

869
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:36,298
When is Habaek coming back?

870
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:39,062
I wish I had dotted his eyes
before he left!
