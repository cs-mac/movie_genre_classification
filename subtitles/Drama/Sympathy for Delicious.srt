00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,625
AND WALK ONE DAY, RENE?

159
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,918
YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

160
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,171
- YES, I DO.

161
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,603
- GUY'S A FUCKING IDIOT.

162
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,564
- HE'S JUST TRYING TO HELP.

163
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,692
- WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
LIKE, I KNOW...

164
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,868
LIFE'S BULLSHIT, MAN.

165
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,620
THERE'S NO WAY OUT.

166
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,912
- THERE IS A WAY OUT,

167
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,624
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FIND IT.

168
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,955
[Cheers and applause]

169
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,752
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GIVE IT UP

170
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,295
SO THERE'S ONE MORE.

171
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,799
- HEY, DJ SHY,

172
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,884
MY BAND IS AUDITIONING

173
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,719
I WOULD LOVE
TO CHECK YOU OUT.

174
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:23,098
- LET'S GIVE IT UP
FOR DJ "DELICIOUS" DEAN.

175
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,136

176
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,430
THAT WAS SO GUTTER, MAN.
KEEP GOING.

177
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:07,350
- L-I CAN'T.
THE... THE TABLE'S TOO HIGH.

178
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,437
- OH, SHIT.
WELL, I'LL FIX THAT.

179
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,188
- NO, NO, NO.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

180
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,441
I WAS JUST MESSING AROUND.
LEAVE IT. YOU CAN LEAVE IT.

181
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,736
- JUST GET THAT SIDE.
- WAIT. WHOA WHOA WHOA.

182
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,362

HEY, DON'T TOUCH THAT.

183
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,905
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

184
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:21,990
- LOWERING THE TABLE.

185
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,450
- COULD YOU PUT IT BACK,
PLEASE?

186
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,076
- I'M HELPING MY FRIEND.
- OH, YOU'RE HELP...

187
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,161
- WILL YOU LOWER IT
ON THAT SIDE?

188
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,370
- I'M NOT GONNA TOUCH IT.

189
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,747
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF IT
AND PUT IT BACK.

190
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,956
THESE DESKS ARE SET

191
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,124
AT REGULATION HEIGHT,
ALL RIGHT?

192
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,792
THIS IS FOR DJS
THAT COULD STAND.

193
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,044
- DON'T GO THERE, MAN.
THAT'S SO UNCOOL.

194
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,713
HE'S THE BEST THING
WE'VE HEARD ALL NIGHT.

195
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,214
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GIVE HIM
A CHANCE?

196
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,425
- THIS IS HIS CHANCE, OKAY?
I'M SORRY.

197
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,802
- YOU KNOW, YOUR BAR
IS NOT ACCESSIBLE.

198
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,471
I COULD TOTALLY REPORT
YOUR ASS.

199
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,222
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT UP
WITH LEMMY, ALL RIGHT?

200
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,057
I DON'T OWN THE PLACE.
- I'M SUPPORTING TALENT.

201
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,350
WHO YOU SUPPORTING?

202
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,145
THE FUCKING FUCK HEAD COMMITTEE

203
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,023
- GOOD NIGHT. THANK YOU.
DON'T COME BACK.

204
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,358
- DELICIOUS,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

205
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:01,029
THAT GUY IN THERE
WAS A JACKASS!

206
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,071
CHECK IT OUT.

207
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,823
I HAVE A BAND

208
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:09,496
AND I REALLY WANT YOU
TO COME JAM WITH US TOMORROW.

209
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,791
- WELL, I DON'T PLAY
WITH BANDS.

210
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,751
- BULLSHIT.

211

ONLY ON THE SNYDE DIVER REMIX
AND THE INDIE FATIGABLE

213
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,261
YOU ARE

214
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:29,891
OR IS THERE...
IS THERE ANOTHER ONE?

215
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:34,145
- YEAH.
IT'S ANOTHER GUY.

216
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:38,024
- I KNOW I'M GOING
TO SEE YOU TOMORROW.

217
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,979
- BRENDEL?

218
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,151
BRENDEL.

219
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:29,826
BRENDEL?

220
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,286
- OH, I WAS TRYING TO GET

221
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,079
I'M JUST FEELING
A LITTLE BIT LOST.

222
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:37,083
CAN YOU GIVE ME A HAND?

223
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,044

224
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,505
- YOU... YOU DON'T KNOW ME?

225
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,217
- I CAN'T SAY I DO.

226
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,219

COME ON. COME ON HERE.
THIS WAY.

228
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,911
- THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT.
THE GUY'S GOT NO SOUL.

229
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,955
WE NEED SOMEBODY
WITH A GROOVE.

WHAT FUCKING MELODY?
WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT A MELODY.

WHENEVER THEY WANT?

312
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,452
- NO. NO.

313
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:28,124
- THAT WAS REALLY FUCKED UP
THE WAY YOU TALKED TO NINA.

314
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,751
I MEAN, BECAUSE LIKE IT OR NOT,
SHE DOES SHIT FOR OUR BAND.

315
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,296
AND, YOU KNOW...

316
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,630
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT,
ARIEL.

317
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,798
I SAID THAT, OKAY?

318
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,800
- I MEAN, I WANT YOU
IN THE BAND.

319
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,177
I REALLY DO, DEAN.

320
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,345
AND I THINK
YOU HAVE SOMETHING

321
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,556
THAT'S REALLY AMAZING.

322
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,602
BUT YOU'D HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO NAVIGATE YOUR,

323
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:51,522
YOU KNOW, YOUR HOSTILITIES
AND SHIT.

324
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,316
'CAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH SHIT
COMING UP

325
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,276
AND YOU CAN'T JUST BE, LIKE,
FLYING OFF THE HANDLE.

326
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:59,822
I MEAN, WE'RE GONNA GET SIGNED
AND WE'RE GONNA PLAY OUT

327
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,490
AND DO AMAZING THINGS.

328
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,159
- I CAN DO IT.

329
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,452
- I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'D BE READY FOR IT.

330
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,872
- I WILL NOT FUCK IT UP.

331
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,500
- I LIKE PAIN KILLERS.
DO YOU MIND?

332
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,211
- NO.

333
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,346
- I DON'T THINK
I HEARD YOU SAY SORRY.

334
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,766
- ARIEL, I'M SORRY.

335
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,438
- OKAY.

336
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,900
I COULD TALK TO THE STAIN.

337
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,360
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE A WAY WITH HIM

338
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:42,531
AND HE RESPECTS MY OPINION.

339
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,951
- WH... ARE YOU SERIOUS?

340
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,702
- YEAH.

341
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:52,375
SHOW UP AT THE GIG AT 9:00

359
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,527

WHAT YOU...

- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK I CAN DO.

363
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,658
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.
- YOU CAN DO IT. YOU CAN DO IT.

364
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,868
- ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!

365

WHAT HAPPENED?

I SEE YOU, FATHER.

FUCK! FUCK!

PLEASE. PLEASE. COME ON, MAN.

COME ON. I KNOW YOU CAN.

JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE,

- PLEASE HELP US.

390

- [Groans]
- OH, SHIT!

391
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:44,023
WHAT THE...?
- OH, I'M SORRY.

392
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,525
L-I JUST... I WAS AFRAID
THAT THINGS

393
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,027
WERE GOING
TO GET STOLEN AGAIN.

394
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,737
OH.
- THANKS. THANK YOU.

395
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,864
- MY GOODNESS,
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU...

396
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,157
HOW YOU SLEEP ON THIS THING.

397
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,160
IT'S LIKE SLEEPING
ON A BOARD.

398
00:24:56,203 --> 00:25:00,956
OH. GOODNESS ME.

399
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,168
- THANKS.
- EXCUSE ME.

400
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:09,924
SO DID YOU HEAR THE ONE
ABOUT THE BLIND WOMAN

401
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:13,928
WHO WAS HEALED BY A MAN
IN A WHEELCHAIR?

402
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,058
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA.

403
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,228
AN INCURABLE DISEASE.
BUT SHE'S CURED.

404
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,815
- [Exhales]

405
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,108
YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

406
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:32,821
I MEAN YOU...

407
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,949
PEOPLE CAN DO THAT?

408
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:38,077
- WELL, DEAN, I-I HAVE NEVER
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT

409
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:43,040
IN ALL MY DAYS.

410
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,960
- IT DOESN'T WORK ON ME.

411
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,837
- FATHER JOE?
YOU GONNA HELP ME? HUH?

412
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,131
YOU... FATHER JOE.
- MORNING HARV.

413
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,008
- YOU GOING TO SHARE THAT?

414
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,552
YOU GOT A MINUTE,
DON'T YOU?

415
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:55,886
- NO, I DON'T.
I GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

416
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,054
- OKAY, HARV.
- CAN YOU HELP ME?

417
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,639
- I CAN'T HELP YOU, MAN.
- NO?

418
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,808
- I CAN'T HELP YOU.
I CANNOT HELP YOU.

419
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,518
- LET ME JUST TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE, HARV.

420
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,270
- OKAY.

421
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,814
AH... AH, HELL.

422
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:11,277
HE'S GOT NO TIME FOR ME.

423
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,153
- JESUS.

424
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,531
- HARV'S...
HARV'S GOT A TERRIBLE HEART.

425
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,032
YOU THINK
YOU COULD JUST TOUCH HIM?

426
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,993
- DON'T DO THAT TO ME, MAN.
DON'T DO THAT.

427
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,620
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY. SORRY.

428
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,247
IT WAS WRONG OF ME.
I'M SORRY.

429
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,624
DEAN, I KNOW SOMEONE
YOU COULD TALK TO

430
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,793
WHO KNOWS MUCH MORE ABOUT THIS
THAN I DO.

431
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:31,922
JUST THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

432
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,716
- IN OUR FAITH,

433
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:37,219
THERE'S A LONG HISTORY
OF THESE VERY SPECIAL MOMENTS.

434
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:41,932
AND GOD HAS FREQUENTLY CHOSEN
THE MOST UNEXPECTED PERSON

435
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,851
TO CARRY THEM THROUGH.

436
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,645
- IT'S A REAL,
A REAL PRIVILEGE, DEAN.

437
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,981
- WELL, IF IT'S SO REAL,
WHY DOESN'T IT ALWAYS WORK?

438
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:52,568
- AH, WELL,
THERE'S A DUAL VIEW HERE.

439
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,653
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE WITH GOD,

440
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,573
BUT GOD MAY NOT WANT TO GIVE YOU
WHAT YOU WANT.

441
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,074
- WHY?

442
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,244
- BECAUSE GOD CARES
FOR YOUR SOUL.

443
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,914
AND WHAT YOUR SOUL NEEDS
MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU WANT.

444
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,334
- BUT COME ON, MAN,
THAT'S NOT COOL.

445
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,587
- WELL, I THINK YOU'RE ASKING
THE RIGHT QUESTIONS, DEAN,

446
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,131
BUT YOU'RE NOT WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT ANSWERS.

447
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:18,594
THERE'S ONLY ONE ANSWER.
PRAY.

448
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,888
- LOOK, MAN, I DID PRAY.
ALL RIGHT?

449
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,931
I TRIED PRAYING.
IT DOESN'T WORK.

450
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:27,603
- I THINK YOU WERE BARGAINING
FOR THE HEALING, DEAN.

451
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,605
AND THAT IS NOT
THE SAME THING.

452
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,775
I THINK YOU SHOULD SAY HELLO
TO GOD.

453
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,277
- YEAH, WHAT IF I'M PISSED OFF
AT GOD?

454
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,238
WHAT IF I THINK GOD'S
BULLSHIT?

455
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:42,117
- I WOULD SAY HELLO FIRST
AND THEN TELL HIM HE'S BULLSHIT

456
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,038
AND YOU'RE PISSED OFF.

457
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,749
LOOK AT ME, SON.

458
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,878
GOD IS TRYING TO SAY HELLO
TO YOU

459
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:57,299
AND TO TELL YOU
THAT HEALING IS POSSIBLE.

460
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,343
NOW HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO RESPOND?

461
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,970
BECAUSE
THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION.

462
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:06,308
SOMETHING MAGICAL,

463
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,895
WONDROUS IS HAPPENING
THROUGH YOU.

464
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:17,236
YOU'RE HAVING A CALLING
IN THIS LIFE

465
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:23,158
AND THAT, MY SON,
IS YOUR HEALING.

466
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,187

HOW ABOUT $48?

644
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,831

ABOUT THAT?

BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T FIX
EVERYBODY ON THE SKID.

660

AND BESIDES THAT,
YOU'RE WAY OVERDUE ON A RETREAT.

YOU'RE A LITTLE TENSED UP,

- I'M STARVING.

669

"WITH ALL I HAVE,

00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,683
STAIN, MAN...

965
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,018
- YOU'RE A FUCKIN'
ROCK STAR BRO.

966
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,355
- I AM THE FUCKING LORD

967
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,649
THY WANT OF COME.

968
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:48,028
- OH!
- THAT'S FUCKIN' RIGHT.

969
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,364
I FUCKIN' CHRISTEN THEE

970
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,699
DOUBLE D DELICIOUS.

971
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,035
NINA, NINA,
IT FUCKIN' WORKS.

972
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:59,415
I TOLD YOU IT WOULD WORK,
YOUR DOUBTER, AND IT WORKS!

973
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,500
- I SMELL IT.

974
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:06,380
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT?

975
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,382
YOU ALL GAVE BIRTH TONIGHT.

976
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,135
AND NOW WE HAVE A CHILD.

977
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:13,595
- DUDE, WE HAVE A CHILD.

978
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:17,850
WE... WE BROUGHT A NEW LIFE

979
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:21,770
INTO THE STALE FUCKIN' WORLD
OF ROCK.

980
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:24,815
- YOU WERE ALL BRILLIANT.

981
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:28,610
STAIN,
IT WAS YOUR NIGHT, BABY.

982
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,488
- TOO FUCKIN' RIGHT, IT WAS.
- YOU DID IT.

983
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,908
YOU TOOK YOUR PLACE.
- TOO FUCKIN' RIGHT, I DID.

984
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:39,413
- CHUCK, A POWER MAN.
BRASH.

985
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,458
OOGIE, I COULD TASTE YOU.

986
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:50,549
ARIEL, YOU HAD WINGS
ON YOUR BACK.

987
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:54,887
I COULD SEE YOUR WINGS.

988
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:58,807
AND YOU...

989
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,935
YOU SEXY MOTHERFUCKER.

990
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,645
- THAT IS RIGHT.

991
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:06,815
I CALLED HIM FORTH.

992
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,151
I PLUCKED HIM HENCE.

993
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,987
- STAIN, MY LOVE,

994
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,781
YOU HAVE TO WRITE A SONG.

995
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:17,659
A SONG
THAT WILL SUPPORT OUR D

996
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:20,621
AS HE ROLLS DOWNSTAGE.

997
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:25,042
BECAUSE WHEN WE TOUR,
WHICH WE WILL,

998
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:29,171
OUR BABY'S GONNA BE NAMED...

999
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:32,216
"HEALAPALOOZA."

1000
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,968
- HEALAPALOOZA, EH?

1001
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,846
- HEALA-FUCKIN'.

1002
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,140
OUR BABY.

1003
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,643
OUR FUCKIN' BABY.

1004
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,521
I AM BRINGING ABOUT
THE DIPHTHONGS EXPERIENCE

1005
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,481
TO THE PEOPLE.

1006
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,025
LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT,
NINA, LOVE, ALL RIGHT?

1007
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,152
I WANTED DEAN IN THE BAND
FROM THE BEGINNING

1008
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,862
BECAUSE OF HIS SCRATCHING.

1009
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:58,992
THIS MAN IS AN ARTIST.
NOT SOME SIDESHOW FREAK.

1010
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:03,664
HE'S NOT GONNA SELL HIMSELF OUT
TO A LITTLE MAGIC HANDS TRICK.

1011
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:06,667
THE BAND IS THE MUSIC.

1012
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:09,044
WE WILL OVERRIDE THE SHOW
INTO SOME DISPLAY

1013
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,671
AND BE RESPECTED.

1014
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:15,676
BUT, D, DUDE, YOU MAY END UP
A PATHETIC JOKE.

1015
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:20,847
ARE YOU COOL WITH THAT,
MAN?

1016
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:26,853
- FUCK IT.
LONG AS I'M GETTING PAID.

1017
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:31,275
- DO Y'ALL HEAR THAT?
ARE WE CLEAR, NINA?

1018
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:34,528
- YEAH.
- GOOD.

1019
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:38,699
- I'VE GOT PHONE CALLS
TO MAKE.

1020
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:50,794
- YOU THINK I'M A SELL-OUT
SIDESHOW FREAK?

1021
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,087
- WHAT DO YOU CARE?

1022
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,964
AS LONG AS YOU'RE GETTING PAID,
RIGHT?

1023
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,049
- OH, FUCK IT, ARIEL.

1024
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,593
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

1025
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:00,554
GO BACK TO LIVING
IN MY FUCKIN' CAR?

1026
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,056
- THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.

1027
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,309
YOU'RE OWED. YOU'RE OWED.
YOU'RE OWED, RIGHT?

1028
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:08,228
YEAH, EVERYBODY OWES YOU.
- YOU'RE SO FULL OF SHIT!

1029
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,105
I'M ABOUT TO PUT
YOUR CRAP ASS BAND

1030
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,690
ON THE FUCKING MAP!

1031
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,108
I'M GONNA GIVE EVERYTHING
YOU WANTED!

1032
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,277
WHAT'S ALL THIS PURITY
COMING FROM YOU?

1033
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,613
- YEAH, MYBAND! MYBAND!

1034
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:20,741
MY FUCKIN' BAND,
YOU MOTHERFUCKER!

1035
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:24,202
YOU FUCKIN' PIECE OF SHIT!

1036
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:27,289
YOU HAVE GOD'S GIFT!
YOU HAVE GOD'S GIFT!

1037
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:30,792
DO YOU EVEN CARE
ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE, DEAN?

1038
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:33,712
DO YOU EVEN CARE WHAT HAPPENS
TO THEM?

1039
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:37,883
WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?
I KNOW MY PLACE IN THE WORLD.

1040
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:43,096
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU?
PIECE OF SHIT.

1041
01:00:55,193 --> 01:01:02,324
- I'M SO GLAD YOU DECIDED
TO LEGALLY JOIN THE FOLD.

1042
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:06,953
- I CAN NEVER FIRE YOU EVER.

1043
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:12,626
DEAN, LOOK, THERE WERE 17 SICK
OR INFIRM PEOPLE

1044
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,795
IN THE AUDIENCE
THE OTHER NIGHT.

1045
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,963
TWELVE OF THEM SAID
THEY WERE HEALED.

1046
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,632
NOW IF THAT'S AN INDICATOR,

1047
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,301
THEN YOU'RE MISSING 28%
OF THE TIME,

1048
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,638
WHICH IS A MARKETING
NIGHTMARE.

1049
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:28,684
AND THAT MEANS
THAT I HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT,

1050
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,143
WHICH YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO KNOW ABOUT.

1051
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,396
BUT I'M THE ONE WHO'S TAKING
THE RISK.

1052
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,690
I NEED SECURITY.

1053
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,400
YOU'LL SEE.
IT'S A PRETTY STANDARD CONTRACT.

1054
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,735
SEVEN-YEAR NEGOTIATION CLAUSE
ON MY END,

1055
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:42,739
PLUS A FEW EXTRAAMENITIES,
BECAUSE I'M SO HANDS-ON.

1056
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,784
AND WE CAN TALK
ABOUT SWEETENING YOUR END.

1057
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:49,830
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT A SIGNING BONUS, HMM?

1058
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:02,384
GOOD. YOU READY?

1059
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,942
- IT'S CALLED "HEALAPALOOZA."

1060
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,194
DOWNTOWN,
THERE'S A BUZZ GOING ON.

1061
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:24,322
A NEW BAND CLAIMS TO HEAL PEOPLE
DURING THEIR SHOW,

1062
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:26,199
ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY
HEAL THEM.

1063
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,410
FANS ARE SWEARING UP AND DOWN
THEY'VE RECEIVED HEALINGS

1064
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:32,372
FROM THE TOUCH OF THE BAND'S DJ,
DELICIOUS DEAN.

1065
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,424
- THE CONTROVERSIAL
HEALAPALOOZA TOUR

1066
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:28,011
IS GAINING MOMENTUM
OF TRUE BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS.

1067
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,430
ARTY PUNK-ROCK BAND,
BURNT THE DIPHTHONGS,

1068
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,767
DENIED ACCUSATIONS
THAT THEIR ONSTAGE MIRACLES

1069
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,269
ARE NOTHING MORE
THAN A PUBLICITY STUNT.

1070
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,854
IN FACT,
THEY CLAIMED THE SHOW

1071
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,315
IS REALLY
ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC.

1072
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:43,193
HE TOUCHED ME
IN DIFFERENT PLACES,

1073
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,237
BUT THEN HE FOCUSED
HIS ENERGY

1074
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:46,780
WHERE I TOLD HIM
I HAD MY TUMOR.

1075
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,198
I WOULDN'T SLEEP WITH HIM
THE WHOLE TIME.

1076
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,992
- THE BIZARRE SCRATCH ROCK
HEALING PUNK SHOW

1077
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:54,120
HAS SPARKED A RIOT
AND EVEN A RELIGIOUS PROTEST.

1078
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:57,165
BUT IT'S ALSO BEING CALLED
"NEW CHURCH"

1079
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:00,043
BY ITS SURPRISINGLY DIVERSE
FANS.

1080
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,962
- DELICIOUS DEAN IS GOD.

1081
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:04,214
- DESPITE THE GROWING NUMBER
OF ATTACKS FROM DOCTORS

1082
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:07,968
AND THE AMA DENOUNCING
THE SHOW AS A HOAX

1083
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:11,137
AND PROJECTED TICKET SALES
REACHING INTO THE MILLIONS,

1084
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,807
IT'S NOT HARD TO SEE
WHAT FANS ARE LOOKING FOR.

1085
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,350
A NEED TO BELIEVE.

1086
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:18,144
A NEED FOR SOMETHING MORE
FROM THEIR MUSIC.

1087
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,397
SOMETHING IN THE FORM
OF A TOUCH

1088
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:24,943
FROM THE BAND'S MESSIANIC
SUPERSTAR.

[Cheers and applause]

1090
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:55,849
- SHE JUST PULLED ME
RIGHT OUT OF THE CROWD,

1091
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,059
SAID "JUST PUT
THE NECK BRACE ON."

1092
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:02,939
UGH. SHIT. EASIEST $100
I'VE EVER MADE.

1093
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,107
SHE MADE YOU
SAY SOMETHING TOO?

1094
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,192
- MM-HMM.

1095
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:13,366

- NOTHING.

[Crowds cheering]

1097
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:01,414
- WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?
AND WHERE THE FUCK IS ARIEL?

1098
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:05,126
WE FUCKING REHEARSED THIS.
YOU ENTER BEFORE ME.

1099
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:06,962
LISTEN TO ME, FUCK HEAD.

1100
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:08,922
I MADE YOU, YOU CUNT.

1101
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,132
I PUT ON THAT FUCKING STAGE.

1102
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:14,511
YOU JUST GET OUT THERE

A LITTLE CRACKER JACK ACTION

THAT'S RIGHT, DEAN.

GIVE THEM A HEALING, DEAN.
- SHUT THE FUCK UP.

HEAL THEM, DEAN.

DUDE, DUDE, DUDE,
GET THE FUCKING PARAMEDICS.

1142

SHE'S OD'ING.
SHE'S FUCKING OD'ING MAN.

- HERE.

1145
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:04,157
RIGHT HERE
IS WHERE HOMICIDE BEGINS.

1146
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,242
IN THESE PRECIOUS MOMENTS,

1147
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:10,872
WHEN LIFE-SAVING DECISIONS
COULD HAVE BEEN MADE,

1148
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:14,292
WHAT WAS ON THE MIND
OF THE ROCK STAR,

1149
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:17,921
DEAN O'DWYER?

1150
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:21,424
WHAT WAS HE THINKING

1151
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,551
AS ARIEL LEE
LAY AT HIS FEET,

1152
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:28,306
TAKING HER LAST BREATH?

1153
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:32,936
WAS HE THINKING,
"WOW, WHAT A SHOW.

1154
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:36,189
HOW ARE WE GOING
TO RECREATE THIS?"

1155
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:37,357
BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU THIS,

1156
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:39,317
HE WAS NOT THINKING
ABOUT ARIEL LEE

1157
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,861
BECAUSE IF HE WAS,

1158
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,947
HELP WOULD HAVE GOTTEN
TO ARIEL LEE

1159
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:45,573
AND SHE MIGHT BE HERE TODAY.

1160
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:49,452
AND THAT, BY DEFINITION,
IS MANSLAUGHTER.

1161
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:55,375
- THIS IS A TRAGEDY
TO SAY THE LEAST.

1162
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:58,670
WE ARE ALL ABSOLUTELY
DEVASTATED.

1163
01:10:58,712 --> 01:11:01,923
DELICIOUS D'S ACTIONS
WERE SELFLESS AND HEROIC

1164
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:05,927
AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SENSITIVITY
AT THIS TIME.

1165
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:10,306
ARIEL LEE DID NOT DIE
BECAUSE OF NEGLECT.

1166
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:13,559
ARIEL LEE DIED
BECAUSE SHE OD'D.

1167
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:19,315
- THEY WERE...
PEOPLE SAID THEY WERE HEALED.

1168
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,401
- DEAN, MAN, YOU SHOULD HAVE LET
THE PARAMEDICS AT HER

1169
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,528
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T HEAL HER
OR WHATEVER HAPPENED.

1170
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:26,906
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
MAYBE YOU DID TOO MUCH.

1171
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,408
- JUST REMEMBER,
YOU ARE UNDER OATH,

1172
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,368
SO JUST...
JUST TELL US THE TRUTH.

1173
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:32,245
- I SAY
HE IS THE LIVING EMBODIMENT

1174
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,998
OF ALL THAT IS GOOD
IN HUMANKIND.

1175
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,544
- WE ALL WANT TO KNOW
THERE'S GOOD IN PEOPLE.

1176
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:42,338
AND I'M NO EXCEPTION
TO THAT.

1177
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:48,594
THE CROWD WAS CHANTING
FOR HER TO BE HEALED.

1178
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:52,015
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS ALL PART
OF THE SHOW.

1179
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:54,559
I GRABBED THE MIKE
TO CALL FOR HELP,

1180
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:58,354
BUT POWER HAD BEEN CUT
TO THE STAGE

1181
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:00,857
AND THE PARAMEDICS
HAD BEEN BLOCKED.

1182
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:02,775
I DIDN'T GET TO SAY

1183
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:05,611
WHAT NEEDED
TO BE SAID THAT NIGHT.

1184
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:09,615
SO I'M GOING TO SAY
WHAT NEEDS TO BE SAID NOW.

1185
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:11,784
AND IT'S SOMETHING
I'VE BEEN ASKED NOT TO SAY

1186
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:14,329
BY DEAN O'DWYER
AND NINA HOGUE.

1187
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:17,290
OBJECTION.
- YOUR HONOR, SIDEBAR PLEASE.

1188
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,708
- AND THAT IS THAT HE'S A FAKE.
- SIDEBAR.

1189
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:19,959
- HE'S A PHONY.
- OBJECTION!

1190
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,669
- HE'S A FRAUD.
- ORDER!

1191
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:24,380
- THIS CHARLATAN SON OF A BITCH!
- BAILIFF, REMOVE HIM.

1192
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:28,009
- HE CAN'T HEAL SHIT!
IT WAS ALL A FUCKING ACT!

1193
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:30,345
YOU WERE ALL DUPED!
- ORDER!

1194
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:33,890
- HE NEVER COULD HEAL!
YOU BOUGHT A FUCKING LIE!

1195
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:37,643
WELL, WELCOME
TO THE FUCKING SHOW!

1196
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:40,313
- AS THE RELIGIOUS
AUTHORITY FIGURE

1197
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,899
WHO FIRST ENCOURAGED
THIS GIFT,

1198
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:45,651
YOU CAN TESTIFY TO DEAN'S
HEALING TECHNIQUE

1199
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,820
AND HIS INTENSE
CONCENTRATION,

1200
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:51,407
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN
INTERRUPTED BY THE PARAMEDICS.

1201
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:56,079
IN THAT REGARD, THAT MAKES YOU
OUR EXPERT WITNESS.

1202
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:59,582
- AND CHARACTER WITNESS

1203
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,502
DESCRIBING DEAN'S EARLY HEALINGS
ON SKID ROW.

1204
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:07,590
HOW SELFLESS HE WAS.
HOW PURE HIS MOTIVES WERE.

1205
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:11,469
MR. O'DWYER HAS GRACIOUSLY
AGREED FREE OF CHARGE

1206
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:15,681
AND FOR A DESIGNATED PERIOD
OF TIME

1207
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:17,558
TO COME DOWN TO SKID ROW

1208
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:22,939
AND LAY HANDS
ON WHOMEVER YOU WISH.

1209
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:24,899
- IN EXCHANGE
FOR MY TESTIMONY?

1210
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:28,903
- YES.
- NO. NO.

1211
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:36,035
- CAN I SPEAK TO DEAN ALONE
FOR A MOMENT PLEASE?

1212
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,037
- YOU DO WHAT YOU THINK
IS RIGHT, FATHER.

1213
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,791
BY THE WAY,
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

1214
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:45,878
I'M A MARYMOUNT GIRL

1215
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:48,881
AND I-I HAD THE CALLING

1216
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:51,384
TO BE A NUN,

1217
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,719
BUT I LOST MY WAY.

1218
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:58,808
MAYBE SOMETIME WE'D GET TOGETHER
AND TALK ABOUT THAT.

1219
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,978
- CERTAINLY.

1220
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:06,732
- THANK YOU, FATHER.
- THANK YOU, FATHER.

1221
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:23,082
- SOMETHING ELSE, HUH?

1222
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:32,800
- I, UM,
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING.

1223
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:36,012
SHOW YOU SOME OF THE GOOD WORK
YOU DID.

1224
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:40,558
THAT MEXICAN WOMAN
WHOSE HANDKERCHIEF YOU TOUCHED,

1225
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:42,852
YOU HEALED HER HUSBAND,
DEAN.

1226
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:45,104
YOU HEALED HIM.

1227
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:48,691
THE CLOTH,
IT CARRIED THE POWER.

1228
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:53,196
I SHOULD HAVE TOUCHED
HEALAPALOOZA HANKIES, HUH?

1229
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:56,115
SOLD THEM
AT THE T-SHIRT BOOTHS.

1230
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:04,957
THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY
THAT I KILLED SOMEBODY.

1231
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,960
THAT'S BULLSHIT.

1232
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:12,465
THEY'RE JUST COMING AFTER ME
BECAUSE OF WHO I AM.

1233
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,800
ARIEL WAS A JUNKIE.

1234
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:17,970
SHE TOOK A BUNCH OF PILLS.

1235
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:20,139
AND I DID EVERYTHING I COULD.

1236
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:23,518
I THOUGHT IT WAS WORKING.

1237
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:28,606
- IT'S HARD TO KNOW,
ISN'T IT?

1238
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:32,902
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
LET'S MAKE IT RIGHT.

1239
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:37,657
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOUR SHELTER?

1240
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:41,536
HOW ABOUT THIS?

1241
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:52,255
[Tears out check]

1242
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:05,601
THE LORD WORKS
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.

1243
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:10,189
THINK OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HELP.

1244
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:25,538
- I-I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY,
DEAN.

1245
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:33,045
I MISUSED YOU.
- IT'S OKAY. I FORGIVE YOU.

1246
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:37,592
YOU WANT TO HELP ME?
DO THIS.

1247
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:41,262
DO THIS FOR ME.

1248
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,600
- I'LL TESTIFY FOR YOU.

1249
01:16:45,642 --> 01:16:47,727
I'LL TESTIFY
TO THE HEALINGS THAT I SAW,

1250
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:48,978
BUT THAT'S IT.

1251
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:50,313
I WON'T BE
YOUR CHARACTER WITNESS

1252
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:51,897
BECAUSE I-I WON'T GET
ON THAT STAND

1253
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,609
AND SAY THAT...
THAT YOUR MOTIVES WERE PURE.

1254
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:58,070
- WHAT WERE MY MOTIVES?
- I DON'T KNOW, DEAN.

1255
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:00,698
ALL I KNOW IS THAT YOU ABANDONED
THOSE PEOPLE

1256
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:02,033
WHEN THEY NEEDED YOU.

1257
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:05,578
YOU ABANDONED THEM
TO BECOME A ROCK STAR.

1258
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:06,871
- THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA SAY?

1259
01:17:06,913 --> 01:17:09,957
- I'M NOT GONNA LIE.
- OH! NO!

1260
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,918
NO, YOU CAN'T LIE.
YOU'RE TOO GOOD FOR THAT.

1261
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:14,295
YOU CAN'T CON PEOPLE.

1262
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:16,589
YOU DON'T USE PEOPLE
FOR YOUR OWN GLORY.

1263
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,257
YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.

1264
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,092
WHAT IF ON CROSS-EXAMINATION,

1265
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:23,304
MY LAWYER ASKS
WHAT WERE YOUR MOTIVES?

1266
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:26,098
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY GRAND.

1267
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:28,100
- THAT HAS NO BEARING
ON ANY OF THIS, DEAN.

1268
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:29,352
- OH, YES, IT DOES.
- NO, IT DOESN'T.

1269
01:17:29,394 --> 01:17:31,062
- OH, YES IT DOES.
- NO.

1270
01:17:31,104 --> 01:17:34,649
- YOU ARE THE INSPIRATION
FOR THIS WHOLE THING.

1271
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:37,693
PAYING FOR MIRACLES.
WHERE DID I GET THAT FROM?

1272
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,320
SO LET'S JUST SAY, FATHER,

1273
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:41,030
THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET
ON THE STAND

1274
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,157
AND YOU'RE GONNA TELL
THE FUCKING TRUTH.

1275
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,160
- THE TRUTH IS IS THAT YOU
PROSTITUTED YOUR GIFT.

1276
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:49,622
- NO, THE TRUTH
ISYOUPROSTITUTEDME.

1277
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:52,333
- THAT IS NOT TRUE.
- PROVE IT ISN'T.

1278
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:53,751
CAN YOU PUT YOUR HAND
ON YOUR BIBLE

1279
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:55,127
AND SAY YOU DIDN'T DO THAT?

1280
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:58,923
- DEAN, I HAVE ADMITTED
MY WRONGS, ALL RIGHT?

1281
01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:00,341
BUT I AM NOT
GONNA REPEAT THEM.

1282
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:02,635
- [Scoffs] THAT'S GREAT.

1283
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:06,138
THAT'S REALLY FUCKING HOLY
OF YOU, FATHER.

1284
01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:15,106
[Tears check]

1285
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:22,655
I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL.

1286
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:26,701
- FUCK YOU. FUCK YOU.
FUCK YOU!

1287
01:18:26,743 --> 01:18:28,160
FUCK YOU, DEAN O'DWYER.

1288
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:31,080
YOU THINK, WHAT... YOU THINK...
YOU THINK...

1289
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:32,957
YOU THINK THIS MEANS ANYTHING
TO ME?

1290
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:35,042
YOU THINK YOU CAN BUY ME?

1291
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:36,669
YOU THINK I'M FOR SALE?

1292
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:39,171
I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

1293
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:41,340
YOU'RE NOT GONNA RUIN
MY LIFE TWICE.

1294
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:44,760
- YOU SOLD ME OUT!
FOR YOUR OWN FUCKING SAINTHOOD!

1295
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:46,137
- I TRIED...

1296
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:47,888
- AND YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN
RIGHT NOW!

1297
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:49,181
- I TRIED TO SAVE YOU.

1298
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:50,850
I TRIED TO GIVE THAT GIFT
TO THE PEOPLE...

1299
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,059
- YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
FOR ME!

1300
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:53,227
- WHO IT BELONGS TO.

1301
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:54,353
YOUR GOD-GIVEN GIFT,
MY FRIEND.

1302
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,355
- YOU'RE A BULLSHIT PRIEST!

1303
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:59,024
YOU ARE A FUCKING FRAUD!

1304
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:01,235
- HOW DARE YOU.
YOU ARE THE MOST SELFISH...

1305
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,028
- I AM OUT THERE EVERY NIGHT
FOR THE MASSES!

1306
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,864
YOU'VE GOT A GOD-GIVEN GIFT.
AND WHAT DID YOU DO?

1307
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:07,825
YOU USED IT FOR YOURSELF!
- IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

1308
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:44,361
- FORGIVE ME.

1309
01:19:44,404 --> 01:19:49,742
EXCUSE ME.

1310
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,411
- AND THAT IS WHY YOU ARE HERE
TODAY, FATHER.

1311
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,038
NOW, FATHER,
I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE

1312
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:57,333
THAT YOU ARE IN YOUR CIVILIAN
CLOTHES TODAY.

1313
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:58,876
- YES.
- MM-HMM.

1314
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:02,922
NOW, IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR
REASON FOR THAT?

1315
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:05,049
- I'M ON A LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
- OKAY.

1316
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:07,510
BUT YOU ARE AN ORDAINED
CATHOLIC PRIEST

1317
01:20:07,552 --> 01:20:08,886
THESE PAST 16 YEARS.

1318
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:10,095
- THAT'S CORRECT.
- OKAY.

1319
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:12,056
NOW, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
BELIEVES

1320
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:14,058
IN HANDS-ON HEALING.

1321
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:18,521
IT IS DESCRIBED AS A GENUINE
GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.

1322
01:20:18,563 --> 01:20:23,275
SO NOW, FATHER ROSSELLI,
CAN YOU, AS A MODERN PRIEST,

1323
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:25,903
COME BEFORE US TODAY
AND SAY

1324
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:30,115
THAT HE HAS THE POWER
TO HEAL?

1325
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,952
BECAUSE IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO THIS:

1326
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:36,121
IF DEAN O'DWYER CANNOT HEAL,

1327
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:38,791
THEN THIS WAS A SHOW

1328
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:43,796
AND A TALENTED YOUNG WOMAN
IS DEAD BECAUSE OF IT.

1329
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,799
SO, FATHER,

1330
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:49,969
IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION,

1331
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:54,515
DOES DEAN O'DWYER
HAVE THE ABILITY TO HEAL?

1332
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:05,943
- GOD.

1333
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:07,319
GOD IS THE ONLY HEALER.

1334
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:10,155
- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.
SPECULATION.

1335
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:11,490
- HOW CAN THAT BE SPECULATION

1336
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:13,158
WHEN I'VE ASKED
YOUR OWN WITNESS TO...

1337
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:16,370
- WE ARE NOT SPEAKING
OF A METAPHORICAL HEALING HERE,

1338
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:17,538
YOUR HONOR.

1339
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:19,081
- ORDER. ORDER!

1340
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:20,374
- HE IS MAKING A MOCKERY
OF THIS COURT.

1341
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:21,834
- I'LL HAVE ORDER IN MY COURT,
COUNSEL.

1342
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,043
- PERMISSION TO REDIRECT
THE HONOR...

1343
01:21:23,086 --> 01:21:24,044
- COUNSEL!
- THE WITNESS.

1344
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:25,045
YOUR HONOR, PLEASE.

1345
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:28,048
[Jail door shuts]

1346
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:33,155
- WHAT'S UP?

1347
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:03,978
- HOW ARE YOU?

1348
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:11,276
I WANNA HELP YOU GET OUT OF HERE
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

1349
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:17,950
PROGRAMS
FOR DISABLED PRISONERS

1350
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:20,661
ARE LIMITED OBVIOUSLY,

1351
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:22,079
BUT THERE ARE SOME,

1352
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:23,288
AND I THINK
YOU SHOULD GET INVOLVED.

1353
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:27,334
- I GOT NOTHING BUT TIME
IN HERE.

1354
01:23:27,377 --> 01:23:32,965
AND I WANTED
TO BE SO PISSED AT YOU.

1355
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:36,468
BUT ALL I CAN THINK IS HOW BAD
I FUCKED EVERYTHING UP.

1356
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:40,014
NAH, JUST TAKE YOUR TIME,
DEAN.

1357
01:23:40,056 --> 01:23:41,640
KEEP YOUR NOSE CLEAN.

1358
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:45,477
- WHAT THE HELL
WAS I THINKING?

1359
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,731
YOU KNOW,
WHAT WAS I DOING?

1360
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:52,484
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

1361
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:55,237
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO LET THE PARAMEDICS COME UP

1362
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,073
AND DO THEIR JOB.

1363
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:00,576
THERE'S... THERE'S ONE PROGRAM
IN PARTICULAR

1364
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:03,996
THAT I... THAT I THINK
YOU'D BE GOOD FOR.

1365
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,999
IT'S A... IT'S A WORK DETAIL.

1366
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:09,668
YOU GET TO LEAVE PRISON GROUNDS
TO DO COMMUNITY SERVICE.

1367
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:15,674
- YOU KNOW IF I GOT OUT OF HERE,
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'D START.

1368
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:19,762
I GOT NOTHING.

1369
01:24:19,804 --> 01:24:22,097
I CAN'T HELP MYSELF.

1370
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:25,768
I CAN'T...

1371
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:29,021
I NEED HELP.

1372
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,523
I NEED...

1373
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:38,363
- SORRY, DEAN.

1374
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:47,206
I TRIED
TO CONTROL YOUR GIFT.

1375
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:55,297
I WANTED TO BE MORE
THAN WHAT I WAS

1376
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:57,382
AND I WANTED YOU
TO BE SOMEONE YOU WEREN'T.

1377
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:05,724
I'M NOT A PRIEST ANYMORE,
DEAN.

1378
01:25:10,146 --> 01:25:12,397
- LOOK...

1379
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:20,239
I KNOW YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE HELPING ME,

1380
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:24,743
BUT NOTHING HELPS.

1381
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:27,246
MAYBE YOU CAN'T HELP
EVERYBODY.

1382
01:25:32,877 --> 01:25:37,089
- NO, NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HELPED ME?

1383
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:43,220
