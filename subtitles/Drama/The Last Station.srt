1
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,195
Darling?

2
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:05,401
Oh, darling.

3
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:33,218
But sex.

4
00:02:33,218 --> 00:02:35,221
You are 23.

5
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:38,390
Not an easy age
for abstinence, is it?

6
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,644
Tolstoy does not approve
of sexual relations.

7
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:43,230
I know this.
He despises them, in fact.

8
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,524
Well, I don't mean
to belabor the point,

9
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:50,110
but last summer
I arranged for a manservant

10
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:53,156
who proceeded to ruin
two housemaids, just like that.

11
00:02:53,157 --> 00:02:54,366
He was very upset.

12
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:57,242
This would not be a problem
with me. I'm a vegetarian.

13
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,870
I am celibate.

14
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:00,580
I'm also a vegetarian.

15
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:04,709
My dear boy, if you were to become
Tolstoy's private secretary,

16
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,503
you would be given a great gift.

17
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:08,420
Vladimir Grigorevich,
please know

18
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,592
that I understand what a privilege this
position presents.

19
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:17,264
But since becoming a Tolstoyan,
I have become so eager to learn,

20
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:20,182
to discuss ideas,
to perfect my very soul.

21
00:03:20,182 --> 00:03:22,769
Yes. Well...

22
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,188
We have a lot to do if we are to get his
work to the people.

23
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:29,568
We?
Yes, we.

24
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:34,281
If we can encourage the spread
of passive resistance,

25
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:36,866
just think of it, Valentin.

26
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:40,412
Thousands of ordinary
Russians

27
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:43,789
casting off centuries of political
and spiritual oppression.

28
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:48,086
In the name of truth and freedom.
Truth and freedom. Yes, yes.

29
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:52,007
But, still, there are
many, many enemies.

30
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:54,634
Enemies?
Come.

31
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,926
The czar's police.

32
00:03:56,927 --> 00:03:59,139
Now, you will be followed
when you leave here,

33
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,974
and the Church will stop at nothing
to bring him back into the fold.

34
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:06,271
And then, of course,
there is the countess.

35
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,649
Her dogged attachment
to private property,

36
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,444
her public criticism
of our movement.

37
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,528
But the point is

38
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,489
he needs a man of your
intellectual gifts around him.

39
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,743
Someone who understands
his goals.

40
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:23,078
And they still won't
let me see him.

41
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,790
They keep me under
house arrest.

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,295
I have another task for you,
my dear.

43
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:35,925
I want you to keep
a diary for me.

44
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:39,846
I need to know what goes on
at Yasnaya Polyana.

45
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,054
Mm-hm.

46
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:43,181
You let me know
who visits the house,

47
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:47,019
any talk of the copyright to his work,
any contact with the Church,

48
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:49,395
anything the countess says.

49
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:52,567
Anything?
She's very, very dangerous.

50
00:04:56,322 --> 00:04:59,197
Whoa, whoa.

51
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,241
Godspeed, my boy.

52
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:03,786
And remember what I said.
Mm-hm.

53
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:07,206
Write everything down.

54
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,334
Driver!

55
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:11,877
Walk on. Whoa, whoa.

56
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,485
Good morning, countess.

57
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:38,697
Are you rolling? Are you rolling?
I am.

58
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:41,949
Countess? Countess?

59
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:48,037
It doesn't matter.

60
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:50,748
If my heart stopped beating,
I'd still go riding today.

61
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,376
Your pulse is
my responsibility.

62
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:54,419
No. It's mine.
Fine.

63
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,588
If you must ride,
I insist you wear a coat.

64
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,507
Even the sun is cold today.
Oh, this!

65
00:05:58,507 --> 00:06:02,596
This is impossible!
These people are parasites!

66
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,056
"The Countess Tolstoy
is estranged from her husband.

67
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:08,600
They barely speak."

68
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,811
And they gossip
about us in Paris.

69
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:13,688
"They do not share a similar view of
religion or politics."

70
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:15,149
You think that's inaccurate?

71
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:17,275
I think it's none of the world's
bloody business.

72
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:20,028
What are you doing? Why do you write down
everything we say?

73
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:21,237
Don't do that.

74
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:24,533
Dushan Petrovich,
you are scribbling again.

75
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:28,746
Oh, Leovochka, why do you insist on
dressing like that?

76
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:32,040
What do you mean, like what?
Like the man who looks after sheep.

77
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,209
It wasn't meant to offend you.

78
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:37,463
You're a count, for God's sake.

79
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,963
Darling,
where are you going?

80
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:41,633
Riding with Sasha.
Don't expect us for lunch.

81
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,885
Lev Nikolayevich,
you've forgotten your coat.

82
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:45,221
Dushan, are you fretting?

83
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:48,516
Yes, because you refuse
to look after yourself.

84
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:36,313
Telyatinki was created
by Vladimir Grigorevich

85
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:38,608
as a center for the movement.

86
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:43,528
We're all equals here, you know,
as Tolstoy teaches us.

87
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,822
This is a place of freedom.

88
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:52,328
It's a beautiful day.

89
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:55,209
Yes, but we'll pay for it.

90
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:57,417
Toolshed is there.

91
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:00,878
That's the meeting room,
and this is the dormitory.

92
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,673
I found it!

93
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:05,049
Afternoon.
Yes, hello.

94
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,846
You are expected at Yasnaya Polyana
in the morning,

95
00:08:07,846 --> 00:08:09,346
first thing.
First thing?

96
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:12,181
You'll need to be on the road early.
It's nearly two hours away.

97
00:08:12,182 --> 00:08:16,061
I look forward to it.
Yes. You're lucky.

98
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,939
We're all envious.

99
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,365
I'll see you in the morning.

100
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:30,617
If we're spared.

101
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,375
Right.

102
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:42,548
And out.

103
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:46,009
In.

104
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:51,847
Emma, can you come?
We need you in the house.

105
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,187
Come in.

106
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,947
Brought you a glass of tea.
That's very kind of you.

107
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,451
It's your first day.

108
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,581
Enjoy it.

109
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,961
You met Sergeyenko?

110
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:25,756
Last night, yes.

111
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,466
What do you think?

112
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,927
I thought he seemed
very sincere.

113
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:32,429
Thank you.

114
00:09:33,597 --> 00:09:35,139
What?

115
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,226
Is that what you think?
I think that...

116
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:43,231
I think I've just arrived.
What was your name?

117
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:46,653
Masha. But you should
still say what you think.

118
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,072
I mean, not just about him.

119
00:09:49,072 --> 00:09:50,697
Like we all should.

120
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,576
Yes.

121
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,667
Excuse me.

122
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,004
Thank you for the tea.

123
00:10:11,885 --> 00:10:14,971
He's a sorry, old, tight-assed
stick-in-the-mud,

124
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:18,519
but, yes, he's sincere.

125
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,942
Hello?

126
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:12,197
Out of the way.

127
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:16,576
Hello?

128
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:20,120
Ah. Excuse me.

129
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,497
You.

130
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:23,667
You're the new secretary?
Yes.

131
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:25,625
Valentin Fedorovich Bulgakov.

132
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:29,715
Papa is out. You can wait
upstairs in the library.

133
00:12:09,672 --> 00:12:13,381
I am so glad you're here.

134
00:12:16,596 --> 00:12:18,971
I'm so glad.

135
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:25,312
God bless you.
Pardon me. I'm mortified.

136
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,730
I sneeze sometimes
when I get nervous.

137
00:12:29,774 --> 00:12:31,942
Yes.

138
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:35,487
Now, Vladimir Grigorevich has already
written about you at lengths.

139
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:39,576
I don't need that.
What I do need is your help.

140
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:42,370
My manifesto against
the government is hard work.

141
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,167
They commit their idiotic abuses
faster than I can catalog them.

142
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:48,459
Yes.

143
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:50,961
And then there's the new book,
the compendium.

144
00:12:50,961 --> 00:12:52,797
Vladimir Grigorevich
told me all about it.

145
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:56,759
He says that you say that all the world's
religions share common truths.

146
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,552
It's very exciting.
No, one truth.

147
00:12:58,552 --> 00:13:02,889
One single organizing principle.
And can you guess what that is?

148
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:05,100
Um...
Eh?

149
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,895
Love. Love. Simple.

150
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:12,149
Yeah, but I want
to talk about you.

151
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:14,985
How are you?
And how was your journey?

152
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:16,989
Come, sit down.

153
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:21,492
I was born on that sofa.
No, no, sit, sit.

154
00:13:21,494 --> 00:13:24,827
Myself, my brother, my children,

155
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:27,538
five or six of them, at least.
Right here.

156
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:29,332
Congratulations.

157
00:13:31,504 --> 00:13:35,215
Well, I've read your essays.

158
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:38,552
How's the work progressing?

159
00:13:44,182 --> 00:13:46,769
My boy, what is it?

160
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,144
Oh, I've upset you in some way.
No.

161
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:52,981
Was it the sofa?
I mean, it's only a sofa.

162
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:55,400
The sofa's wonderful.

163
00:13:55,943 --> 00:13:57,194
I...

164
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:59,572
I'm very happy.
Mm-hm.

165
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,616
You're very kind to me.

166
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:06,413
You see, I am no one,

167
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:09,706
and you are Lev Tolstoy.

168
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:13,086
And you ask me
about my work.

169
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:16,088
I'll fetch you a glass of tea.

170
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,298
Yes.
Now, you rest.

171
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:24,053
Yeah, because there's work
for both of us to do, together!

172
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:25,598
Yes.

173
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,643
Yes.

174
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,102
God.

175
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,606
This machine, it really is
the most extraordinary thing.

176
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,483
Mama, these people have nothing.

177
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:39,571
No, it's not for lack of land
that the muzhiks live in poverty.

178
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:42,322
It's because they have no willpower and
they drink too much.

179
00:14:42,323 --> 00:14:45,783
I am not suggesting
they be given land.

180
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,952
Private property is the root
of the problem.

181
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,999
We should be giving ours away.
God. Giving it to whom?

182
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,250
Yes, exactly.
I mean, this is ridiculous.

183
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,504
You think because the peasants are poor,
they're somehow morally superior.

184
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:58,755
I believe that wealth
corrupts us all.

185
00:14:58,756 --> 00:15:00,007
Yes, I do.

186
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:02,216
Mm. It's a keystone
of the movement.

187
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:04,678
Oh, God, I know
all about the movement.

188
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:07,139
If the peasants
had money,

189
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,643
they wouldn't surround
themselves, as we do,

190
00:15:09,644 --> 00:15:11,937
with footmen costing
10 rubles a month.

191
00:15:11,937 --> 00:15:15,566
No, they'd spend it
on drink and whores.

192
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:18,192
Valentin Fedorovich.
Mm.

193
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:19,735
What do you think?
Tea.

194
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:23,781
You think that 50 years from now, people
will eat while grown men walk around

195
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:26,033
waiting on them
hand and foot?

196
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:27,745
I th... I think...
That's good.

197
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,788
Bless you.
Stop scribbling.

198
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:34,668
I mean, you all think
he's Christ, don't you?

199
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:38,629
He thinks he's Christ.
I'm not...

200
00:15:38,673 --> 00:15:41,673
I don't believe Lev Nikolayevich
is Christ.

201
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,550
Christ is Christ,
but, uh...

202
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:44,970
But what?

203
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:47,346
I do believe
he's one of the prophets.

204
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,846
God speaks through him.

205
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,807
I recognize the cadence
in his voice.

206
00:15:50,808 --> 00:15:52,850
Oh, God, this is unbearable.

207
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:56,146
No wonder I feel lonely.
I'm surrounded by morons.

208
00:15:56,148 --> 00:15:59,024
Ma, you're being ridiculous.
Oh, am I?

209
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:03,153
I have to sit here and listen to this talk
of love and God and equality,

210
00:16:03,153 --> 00:16:05,697
knowing all the time,
full well,

211
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,867
that Count Generosity
here is about to give away
everything we own.

212
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:12,163
Now, why do you keep
going on about this?

213
00:16:12,163 --> 00:16:15,874
Why do you think that we should profit from
the work I'm doing now?

214
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,504
Which is only meant
for the sake of the people.

215
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,172
Stop writing!

216
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:25,717
Stop writing now!

217
00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:41,067
In defense of my gift,
please let me demonstrate.

218
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,568
It's quite remarkable, really.

219
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:52,661
<i>In the same way now,
a society of hunger,</i>

220
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:55,831
<i>full of segregation...</i>

221
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,957
<i>I understand,</i>

222
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,922
<i>not only with my mind, or heart,
It's... It's your voice.</i>

223
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:04,841
<i>but with my soul,
that the existence</i>

224
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:07,009
<i>of tens of thousands...
It's your voice.</i>

225
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:09,345
It's wonderful.
It's wonderful!

226
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:11,765
It's tiresome.

227
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:14,559
Another remarkable invention
will supersede it.

228
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,062
Please excuse me.

229
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:21,107
<i>No matter what all the learned men
in the world say...</i>

230
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,985
Lev Nikolayevich is
something of a Luddite, I fear.

231
00:17:23,986 --> 00:17:26,028
<i>It is a crime.</i>

232
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,449
<i>And one committed not once,
but constantly.</i>

233
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,829
<i>I knew that I, with my luxury...</i>

234
00:17:59,104 --> 00:18:00,688
That's better.

235
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,445
That's nice.

236
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,872
That's very nice indeed.

237
00:18:51,407 --> 00:18:54,533
Do your parents often speak
to each other so bluntly?

238
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:57,786
Mama doesn't understand
my father's goals,

239
00:18:57,787 --> 00:19:00,998
not since his work as a novelist
became secondary.

240
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:05,711
His commitment to the
spiritual life offends her.

241
00:19:05,713 --> 00:19:08,631
They've fought
about it for years.

242
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:11,843
Well, I'm sure
she means well by it.

243
00:19:14,513 --> 00:19:19,016
I see a fine young man
before me. Clear eyes,
nice features,

244
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:21,393
rather handsome
in a peculiar sort of a way.

245
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:22,937
Th... Thank you,
countess.

246
00:19:22,938 --> 00:19:25,148
Oh, please, call me
Sofya Andreyevna.

247
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:29,360
We don't stand on formality here,
as you may have noticed.

248
00:19:29,361 --> 00:19:31,321
No, no. So many
young men nowadays

249
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:35,867
spoil their good looks
with loose living, but you...

250
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:40,455
Ooh, you're a real
Tolstoyan, I can tell that.

251
00:19:40,456 --> 00:19:43,667
Well, thank you. I have to say,
I admire your husband immensely.

252
00:19:43,668 --> 00:19:45,418
Oh, very good.

253
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,795
Excellent. He likes that.

254
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:51,548
Well, his ideas are beautiful.
Social justice, the very concept...

255
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,552
Yes, yes, he's very grateful for the help
you've been giving him.

256
00:19:54,553 --> 00:19:56,971
He told me that himself.
I think he's rather surprised

257
00:19:56,973 --> 00:19:59,640
that a young man like you
can be quite so diligent.

258
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:02,226
You know, when he was your age, he was
whoring in the Caucasus.

259
00:20:02,227 --> 00:20:04,728
Couldn't get enough of it.

260
00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:07,274
Yes, he wrote all about it.

261
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:11,902
He even gave me a copy,
so I could read all the details.

262
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,031
Would you like some more jam?
Yes, thank you.

263
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:18,243
<i>Have you read War and Peace?
Yes, many times.</i>

264
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:20,036
Hmm.

265
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:22,206
Twice.

266
00:20:23,082 --> 00:20:25,875
You know, when Lev was writing it...
Oh, this was ages ago,

267
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:29,879
long before Chertkov created that
monstrosity
at Telyatinki,

268
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,758
over all that fake religion
and revolutionary nonsense.

269
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,844
What do you think of
Chertkov, by the way?

270
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:38,596
Well, I think that he's...

271
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:43,267
I think he's given me
a wonderful opportunity.

272
00:20:43,268 --> 00:20:45,687
Yes, but you can see
what a pompous fool he is,

273
00:20:45,688 --> 00:20:49,107
what a self-serving
puritanical idiot.

274
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:52,067
I must say, it's been very pleasant
since he's been locked away in his house.

275
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:53,821
Right.

276
00:20:54,613 --> 00:20:57,698
So, anyway, when he was
writing it, in the mid-'60s,

277
00:20:57,699 --> 00:21:00,701
he used to bring me pages
to copy every day

278
00:21:00,703 --> 00:21:04,331
because I was the only one who could
understand his handwriting or his notes.

279
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:06,957
<i>Do you know I copied out
War and Peace six times?</i>

280
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,209
Six times?

281
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,129
I could understand
his intentions too.

282
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,216
So every afternoon, we'd have tea
and we'd discuss changes.

283
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:17,468
And I'd say to him,

284
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:21,305
"You know, Natasha wouldn't speak to Prince
Andrei like that. No woman would."

285
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:24,309
Or, "Pierre's too simple here.
He's not an idiot."

286
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,519
You know,
things like that.

287
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,526
But I don't count anymore.

288
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:56,800
You must help me,
Vladimir Fedorovich.

289
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:59,134
Oh, Valentin Fedorovich.

290
00:21:59,136 --> 00:22:01,720
I only want what's best for
my husband and my family.

291
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:04,724
If it was for me alone,
I could tolerate the situation,

292
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:08,186
but I cannot stand by while they steal my
children's inheritance.

293
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:11,605
Well, I don't believe anybody
wants to do that.

294
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:13,524
I don't. I mean...

295
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:16,151
Theft goes against the very
principles of Tolstoyan thought.

296
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:18,863
I have a little gift
for you.

297
00:22:20,408 --> 00:22:22,993
You...?
Mm.

298
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,704
It's a diary.

299
00:22:25,705 --> 00:22:29,457
You know, everyone
should always keep a diary.

300
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:32,877
Yes, it's a very popular
activity around here.

301
00:22:32,878 --> 00:22:34,670
You're teasing us.

302
00:22:34,964 --> 00:22:37,841
But I trust you'll
write the truth.

303
00:22:38,383 --> 00:22:40,302
Well, that may
not be so easy.

304
00:22:40,303 --> 00:22:43,470
Oh, nonsense. You've been listening to
your friends at Telyatinki.

305
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:47,141
No, no, just write what
you see around you.

306
00:22:47,893 --> 00:22:50,687
What you see.

307
00:23:08,496 --> 00:23:11,248
You're finished
for the day?

308
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:13,584
Yes, he didn't need me
this afternoon.

309
00:23:13,585 --> 00:23:17,339
I thought I'd come back here

310
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,466
and lend a hand.

311
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:25,804
You know, Lev Nikolayevich
considers himself a liberal

312
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:29,767
but he doesn't approve of
women doing physical labor.

313
00:23:31,187 --> 00:23:33,437
Don't you find that reactionary?
No.

314
00:23:33,438 --> 00:23:35,649
I find it sweet.

315
00:23:36,525 --> 00:23:38,986
I find you reactionary.

316
00:23:43,783 --> 00:23:46,576
What do you talk about
when you're with him?

317
00:23:47,453 --> 00:23:49,329
We, uh...

318
00:23:51,457 --> 00:23:53,876
Why are you blushing?
I'm not.

319
00:23:56,795 --> 00:23:58,296
We talk about me.

320
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,298
Really?
Yes.

321
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,884
He wants to know about
my family, my upbringing.

322
00:24:03,886 --> 00:24:06,263
My connection to God
and my relations with women.

323
00:24:06,264 --> 00:24:07,973
Ooh.

324
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,934
What relations
are these?

325
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,993
All right, it's all right.

326
00:24:45,011 --> 00:24:46,553
Phew.

327
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,514
Well done.

328
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:58,689
I had a lover
before I came here.

329
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,569
He was headmaster of
the school where I taught.

330
00:25:02,695 --> 00:25:04,946
He was married.

331
00:25:04,947 --> 00:25:09,408
He was happily married.
It was difficult.

332
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:11,244
We could make love
only at school.

333
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:12,954
At school?

334
00:25:12,955 --> 00:25:16,332
In the gymnasium,
after the girls had gone.

335
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:19,335
I see. I see.

336
00:25:21,922 --> 00:25:25,050
Oh! There you are.
Have I upset you?

337
00:25:25,051 --> 00:25:27,052
No.

338
00:25:28,345 --> 00:25:32,264
No, I find you...I... I appreciate
your frankness.

339
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:34,059
But you disapprove of me?
No!

340
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,102
I see it in your eyes.
Not at all.

341
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:41,524
No. Pfft. I think
sexual behavior

342
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:43,067
and intercourse,

343
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:46,028
how two men,
or two women,

344
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,947
or men and women,

345
00:25:47,948 --> 00:25:50,242
animals,
combine their physical parts,

346
00:25:50,243 --> 00:25:52,453
I find it completely neutral.

347
00:25:54,162 --> 00:25:56,081
Listen to you.

348
00:25:56,082 --> 00:25:58,582
You're a prig.

349
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:02,711
You're just like Sergeyenko. I mean, why
else would they have hired you?

350
00:26:02,713 --> 00:26:04,630
That's not fair.

351
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:06,800
I don't care if it's fair.
It's true.

352
00:26:07,342 --> 00:26:08,886
That's it.

353
00:26:09,762 --> 00:26:13,599
I'm going.
Do as you like.

354
00:26:15,935 --> 00:26:18,896
Valentin
Fedorovich?

355
00:26:19,021 --> 00:26:20,647
Yes?

356
00:26:21,774 --> 00:26:23,525
You forgot
your horse.

357
00:26:25,026 --> 00:26:26,570
Yes.

358
00:26:57,476 --> 00:26:59,644
Where's Papa?

359
00:27:01,898 --> 00:27:06,651
I had a dream last night,
about a Tartar girl I knew in the war.

360
00:27:06,694 --> 00:27:07,985
A girl who died?

361
00:27:07,986 --> 00:27:11,197
No, no, no. Just a girl
I had sexual intercourse with.

362
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:12,615
Oh?

363
00:27:12,617 --> 00:27:15,619
Sometimes, we did it
twice a day.

364
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:18,246
God bless you.

365
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:21,373
I've never forgotten
our time together.

366
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:25,085
The positions of our bodies,
and the taste of her.

367
00:27:25,086 --> 00:27:28,047
It was a long time ago. Really,
you mustn't torture yourself.

368
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:31,051
Torture? You are a virgin,
aren't you?

369
00:27:31,052 --> 00:27:33,386
Well, I try to be.
I mean, I try to be...

370
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:35,346
To what,
to be a good Tolstoyan?

371
00:27:35,348 --> 00:27:39,016
Let me assure you that
I'm not a very good
Tolstoyan myself.

372
00:27:39,017 --> 00:27:44,355
You should think twice before asking
my advice on anything.

373
00:27:44,857 --> 00:27:46,775
"Torture."

374
00:27:58,536 --> 00:28:01,290
Kalya was her name.

375
00:28:02,123 --> 00:28:04,292
She's an old woman now.

376
00:28:04,293 --> 00:28:08,045
White hair, old body,
like me.

377
00:28:08,046 --> 00:28:10,631
Hardly remember
my name, I suspect.

378
00:28:10,632 --> 00:28:13,259
She may even be dead.

379
00:28:14,387 --> 00:28:16,929
Do you think all that
meant something?

380
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,139
What do you mean?

381
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,641
Well, I mean,
that little romance.

382
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:23,562
Was there
some meaning to it?

383
00:28:23,563 --> 00:28:25,980
Well, I think you
would say...

384
00:28:25,982 --> 00:28:30,276
I mean, I think I've read where you say
that the physical body is not real.

385
00:28:30,277 --> 00:28:31,902
That it's all
an illusion.

386
00:28:31,903 --> 00:28:35,282
Oh, I say a lot of things.
But what do you say?

387
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:37,743
What do you think?

388
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,455
I don't know.

389
00:28:42,915 --> 00:28:45,542
I don't know, either.

390
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:49,755
Oh, smell that.

391
00:28:50,089 --> 00:28:53,841
Lilac.
Precisely. Lilac.

392
00:28:53,842 --> 00:28:55,968
Scent gets stronger
when the sun goes down.

393
00:28:55,969 --> 00:28:57,845
Does it?

394
00:28:58,139 --> 00:29:00,265
Papa!

395
00:29:03,894 --> 00:29:05,978
He's free!

396
00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:08,439
He's free!

397
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:10,609
He's coming back!

398
00:29:27,627 --> 00:29:29,961
My friend.

399
00:29:30,795 --> 00:29:34,466
He has come to try again to persuade
your father to change the will,

400
00:29:34,467 --> 00:29:37,468
to give the copyright
as a gift to humanity.

401
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:39,638
The reptile.
Papa's not in his right mind.

402
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:41,931
He can't defend himself
against these thieves.

403
00:29:41,932 --> 00:29:44,184
You're a fine son, my darling.

404
00:29:44,185 --> 00:29:47,271
None of this fake chastity
or made-up religion.

405
00:29:47,604 --> 00:29:51,150
I wish all my children
had turned out like you.

406
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:56,487
Vladimir Grigorevich,
what a surprise.

407
00:29:56,488 --> 00:29:58,489
Sofya Andreyevna.

408
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:02,828
I'm happy to see you.
And I'm happy to make you happy.

409
00:30:03,955 --> 00:30:06,247
Come, come, my friend.

410
00:30:06,248 --> 00:30:10,127
Now, we have a great deal
to talk about.

411
00:30:15,216 --> 00:30:18,217
I'm happy to have a moment
alone with you, Valentin.

412
00:30:18,218 --> 00:30:21,470
There seems to be some confusion.
What do you mean?

413
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:23,848
Well, you send me neverending
commentary on Tolstoy's writing,

414
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:27,351
and that's all very interesting,
but not very useful.

415
00:30:27,352 --> 00:30:31,063
See, I need to know what
goes on with Sofya Andreyevna.

416
00:30:31,064 --> 00:30:33,190
You must see by now
how committed she is

417
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:35,735
to undermining her husband's
best intentions.

418
00:30:35,736 --> 00:30:38,322
It's not quite so obvious to me.

419
00:30:38,363 --> 00:30:42,034
The woman understands
nothing of what we're doing.

420
00:30:42,243 --> 00:30:44,703
We simply want to distribute
Tolstoy's writing

421
00:30:44,704 --> 00:30:47,538
to the widest audience
possible.

422
00:30:48,457 --> 00:30:51,376
I can only be of limited use
to the master

423
00:30:51,377 --> 00:30:54,088
if I don't know
what's going on.

424
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,425
The survival of our movement
depends upon it.

425
00:30:58,426 --> 00:31:00,759
You value our work?
I do.

426
00:31:00,761 --> 00:31:04,723
The ideals we share?
It's why I'm here.

427
00:31:05,557 --> 00:31:07,892
Very good.

428
00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:34,835
Good morning, darling.
Good morning.

429
00:31:34,836 --> 00:31:39,425
Do you mind if I join you?
No, of course, of course, my dear.

430
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:02,697
You know,

431
00:32:02,698 --> 00:32:07,034
it's quite insane, my darling, how people
are making fun of you.

432
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:09,495
Hm? What are you talking about?
Even the muzhiks.

433
00:32:09,496 --> 00:32:12,040
I heard them laughing
about it in the horse barn.

434
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:14,083
Hm? About what?

435
00:32:14,084 --> 00:32:16,544
Laughing about what?

436
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:22,132
About the fact that you've
developed a senile crush

437
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:24,636
on a fat,
middle-aged flatterer.

438
00:32:24,637 --> 00:32:27,514
Your passion for Chertkov
has become a standing joke.

439
00:32:27,515 --> 00:32:30,307
I have a great affection
for Vladimir Grigorevich.

440
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:32,768
Let them laugh
if they find it so amusing.

441
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:36,022
It's not amusing, darling.
It's sick. It's not normal.

442
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:38,024
I mean, you hang on
his every word.

443
00:32:38,025 --> 00:32:39,734
We have a great deal
in common.

444
00:32:39,735 --> 00:32:42,070
You have nothing
in common.

445
00:32:42,071 --> 00:32:45,657
You are a genius, and he is
a sycophant and a pervert.

446
00:32:45,658 --> 00:32:48,534
Because he understands
what I'm trying to do?

447
00:32:48,535 --> 00:32:50,661
Because he tries to
help me accomplish it?

448
00:32:50,662 --> 00:32:53,747
He's just using you.
You just can't seem to see it.

449
00:32:53,748 --> 00:32:55,166
Oh, this is
absolute nonsense.

450
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:58,419
That bald, obese, idiotic man, you...
It is impossible for you

451
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,254
not to distract me!

452
00:33:00,255 --> 00:33:04,634
Now, leave me alone, for God's sake.
You're like a spoiled child.

453
00:33:06,928 --> 00:33:10,389
Do you love me, Leovochka?
Of course I do.

454
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,434
Then why do you
betray me like this?

455
00:33:12,435 --> 00:33:14,602
Why do you say that?

456
00:33:14,603 --> 00:33:17,022
Because of the will.

457
00:33:17,023 --> 00:33:19,024
The new will.

458
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:22,735
There's no new will.

459
00:33:22,736 --> 00:33:25,155
Does Chertkov have it?
There is no new will.

460
00:33:25,156 --> 00:33:27,197
Yes, but that's why
he's here, isn't it?

461
00:33:27,198 --> 00:33:30,368
You talk about it, you and your boyfriend.
You plan for it.

462
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:32,954
You have no heart for the people who
really love you.

463
00:33:32,955 --> 00:33:36,541
You'd rather be seduced by charlatans and
deluded by flatterers,

464
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:40,336
all in the name of love. You can't even
love your own children.

465
00:33:40,338 --> 00:33:42,839
You can't even love me.
Where is it?

466
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,175
There is no new will!

467
00:33:45,176 --> 00:33:47,719
Then promise me
there never will be.

468
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,936
I have told you the truth.

469
00:33:57,063 --> 00:33:59,480
Now let me work.

470
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:02,275
Will you?

471
00:34:07,073 --> 00:34:10,240
Fine, I'll go to the station
and I'll throw myself under a train.

472
00:34:10,242 --> 00:34:12,409
Madam Tolstoy
becomes Anna Karenina.

473
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,911
See how the press
will like that.

474
00:34:13,912 --> 00:34:17,916
Oh, this is unbearable. You don't need
a husband, you need a Greek chorus!

475
00:34:39,104 --> 00:34:41,273
Masha...?
Shh.

476
00:35:11,345 --> 00:35:14,139
Masha...
Shh.

477
00:35:37,162 --> 00:35:38,996
Mmph!
Hm?

478
00:35:38,997 --> 00:35:40,331
Move your book.

479
00:35:40,331 --> 00:35:42,583
What?
Your book.

480
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:46,796
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ahem.

481
00:36:07,193 --> 00:36:08,608
Is it okay?

482
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,860
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

483
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,822
Yeah?
Mm-hm.

484
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:29,298
What? What is it?

485
00:36:30,048 --> 00:36:33,260
What is it?
You really are a virgin?

486
00:36:33,718 --> 00:36:38,097
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm teasing, I'm teasing.

487
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:40,976
It was wonderful, really.
I could do it again.

488
00:36:40,977 --> 00:36:43,186
Let me try again.
It was wonderful.

489
00:36:43,311 --> 00:36:44,979
Really?
Yes.

490
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:48,066
Hold me.

491
00:36:55,615 --> 00:36:57,700
And up.

492
00:36:58,285 --> 00:37:00,119
That's good. Pull it, your side.

493
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:01,747
There.

494
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:03,748
Keep it tight.

495
00:37:03,749 --> 00:37:06,916
That's it, stretch it
so we can read it.

496
00:37:06,918 --> 00:37:10,671
Right, push it right firmly down
into the ground.

497
00:37:14,968 --> 00:37:17,012
We don't want it to blow over.

498
00:37:19,347 --> 00:37:21,432
That's good.

499
00:37:23,269 --> 00:37:25,561
I'm sorry.

500
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:30,150
Hi.

501
00:37:41,244 --> 00:37:43,414
Oh...

502
00:37:44,456 --> 00:37:47,291
Why did you come here,
Masha?

503
00:37:48,793 --> 00:37:51,295
What do you mean?
What do you mean?

504
00:37:51,296 --> 00:37:54,340
You don't follow any
of the rules here.

505
00:37:55,383 --> 00:37:59,471
Because... Because
it's not about rules.

506
00:37:59,472 --> 00:38:01,347
Not for Tolstoy, anyway.

507
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:04,016
Valentin Fedorovich.

508
00:38:04,017 --> 00:38:05,726
What is it?
Open the door.

509
00:38:05,727 --> 00:38:08,563
I'm currently indisposed.

510
00:38:08,564 --> 00:38:11,440
Yes, well,
Lev Nikolayevich
is downstairs.

511
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:13,777
He wants to see you.

512
00:38:13,778 --> 00:38:17,739
Tell Lev Nikolayevich
I'll be down in a moment.

513
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:22,034
Yes. And tell Maria Filipovna
we could use another hand
in the kitchen.

514
00:38:22,035 --> 00:38:25,496
If I see her, I will.
If you see her, yes.

515
00:38:25,497 --> 00:38:30,461
And if you're going to behave like
rabbits, you should go live in the woods.

516
00:38:32,338 --> 00:38:34,798
Shh!

517
00:38:36,383 --> 00:38:41,220
I'll go first. Give me
five minutes, yes?

518
00:38:44,182 --> 00:38:47,768
Come on. That's a boy.

519
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:49,979
That's my boy.

520
00:38:50,314 --> 00:38:52,231
You too, come on.

521
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:56,403
You're wonderful, you're
just wonderful, wonderful.

522
00:39:01,032 --> 00:39:03,535
And you too, you too, son.

523
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:10,291
Look at the love
in him. It's like...

524
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:14,545
Jesus suffering
the children.

525
00:39:14,546 --> 00:39:16,338
All that.
I know, an old man's

526
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,383
a very ugly thing. Yes.

527
00:39:19,385 --> 00:39:21,635
Hey, my boy! Hey!

528
00:39:21,637 --> 00:39:24,180
Come and kiss me.

529
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:30,311
And who's this?
Maria Filipovna.

530
00:39:31,021 --> 00:39:33,565
Oh, you're both
looking so well.

531
00:39:33,566 --> 00:39:35,901
Life here obviously
agrees with you.

532
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:41,155
God bless you, boy. What are you nervous
about now?

533
00:39:41,157 --> 00:39:44,074
Sit down. Sit down.

534
00:39:44,075 --> 00:39:45,910
Oh, Masha, my dear.

535
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:53,960
Valentin tells me that you are the great
treasure of Telyatinki.

536
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:58,006
He claims you're
a very gifted teacher.

537
00:39:58,965 --> 00:40:00,925
We're happy to have you with us.

538
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,264
What are you doing?

539
00:40:07,264 --> 00:40:10,894
What do you mean?
You just killed a living thing.

540
00:40:12,438 --> 00:40:15,023
Do you have
something to say?

541
00:40:15,608 --> 00:40:18,817
It's absurd, that's all.
What are you saying?

542
00:40:18,818 --> 00:40:22,028
I'm sorry, but it's a mosquito.
Forgive him. He can't help it.

543
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,492
He's a much better
Tolstoyan than I am.

544
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,329
That's not the message
we want to send.

545
00:40:30,872 --> 00:40:33,166
Please, have your seat.

546
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:37,628
Very well.

547
00:40:40,258 --> 00:40:42,423
Papa, from Mother:

548
00:40:42,425 --> 00:40:45,760
"Nerves dreadful. Stop.
Insomnia. Stop.

549
00:40:45,762 --> 00:40:48,764
Pulse 100. Stop.

550
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:50,684
Please come home."

551
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,945
So...

552
00:41:01,988 --> 00:41:05,115
are you ill? Or what is it?

553
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,660
Oh, I'm much better,
now you're here.

554
00:41:10,704 --> 00:41:14,456
It's no good, you know, all this.
You frightened everyone.

555
00:41:14,456 --> 00:41:18,836
Really? No, I don't
believe you. Not you.

556
00:41:19,671 --> 00:41:23,465
I'm your little bird.
You know the sounds I make.

557
00:41:23,467 --> 00:41:26,802
Then that was some
sort of love call, I suppose.

558
00:41:26,802 --> 00:41:29,264
Brought you back to me.

559
00:41:31,267 --> 00:41:35,019
Why? Why, why,
why do you do it?

560
00:41:35,021 --> 00:41:38,606
We live in the country, you insist on
making it an opera house!

561
00:41:38,608 --> 00:41:40,442
What's wrong with
a little peace now and then?

562
00:41:40,443 --> 00:41:42,358
Look at me!

563
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,825
This is who I am.
This is what you married.

564
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:51,537
We may be older,
maybe we're old,

565
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:54,954
but I'm still your
little chicken.

566
00:41:54,956 --> 00:41:58,793
And you're still my big cock.
Oh, for pity's sake.

567
00:42:00,421 --> 00:42:03,715
Let me make you crow.
Hm?

568
00:42:06,218 --> 00:42:09,135
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

569
00:42:09,137 --> 00:42:12,889
Oh, come on,
let me make you sing.

570
00:42:12,892 --> 00:42:14,934
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
No. No.

571
00:42:14,936 --> 00:42:16,894
No, no, no.

572
00:42:18,146 --> 00:42:21,191
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

573
00:42:23,985 --> 00:42:27,238
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

574
00:42:41,086 --> 00:42:43,756
Let me make you sing.

575
00:42:54,224 --> 00:42:57,184
Do you love me?
I do, I do. I do.

576
00:42:57,186 --> 00:43:01,398
I want you to love me.

577
00:43:03,066 --> 00:43:05,151
I do.

578
00:43:19,874 --> 00:43:23,921
I must say you do look
beautiful in the firelight.

579
00:43:24,296 --> 00:43:27,423
You mean
I look beautiful in the dark.

580
00:43:43,566 --> 00:43:45,608
Masha.

581
00:43:46,651 --> 00:43:48,818
You wouldn't look at me.

582
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,695
Heh. I...

583
00:43:50,697 --> 00:43:52,865
It was difficult,
in front of the others...

584
00:43:52,867 --> 00:43:55,076
It wasn't difficult
in your bed

585
00:43:55,077 --> 00:43:57,369
when it was just
you and me in front of God.

586
00:43:57,371 --> 00:43:58,996
I'm not sure
I was aware of God.

587
00:43:58,997 --> 00:44:01,206
So I made you forget God?
No. Never.

588
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:02,625
Yes. Yes.
Only for a moment.

589
00:44:02,626 --> 00:44:06,170
You forgot your rules
and you remembered love.

590
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:09,507
You make it sound very simple.
It is simple.

591
00:44:09,508 --> 00:44:12,800
I mean, what we did
is what men and women do.

592
00:44:12,802 --> 00:44:16,014
It's what they have done,
it's what they'll continue doing.

593
00:44:16,932 --> 00:44:19,682
We touched each other.

594
00:44:19,684 --> 00:44:24,313
When we stayed close together,
something passed between us.

595
00:44:24,314 --> 00:44:26,275
Something real.

596
00:44:27,276 --> 00:44:29,860
And that's a betrayal
of what?

597
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,405
Nothing.

598
00:44:32,572 --> 00:44:34,740
But you're afraid.

599
00:44:34,742 --> 00:44:37,494
All your ideas.

600
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:01,517
Ah, she wants to question
you about the new will.

601
00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:04,269
But how does she
even know it exists?

602
00:45:04,271 --> 00:45:08,776
Well, she claims that Lev Nikolayevich
said she could look at the draft.

603
00:45:10,026 --> 00:45:14,153
Well, uh, he is obviously
not thinking clearly.

604
00:45:14,155 --> 00:45:16,824
And now we have to contend
with her petty grasping.

605
00:45:16,825 --> 00:45:18,409
It doesn't seem
that petty to me.

606
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,662
I beg your pardon?

607
00:45:21,204 --> 00:45:23,164
Ah...

608
00:45:24,624 --> 00:45:28,586
He's her entire life. The work,
in her mind, is theirs, together.

609
00:45:28,588 --> 00:45:30,130
And you're her advocate?

610
00:45:30,131 --> 00:45:32,757
You have been taken in
by her celebrity.

611
00:45:32,758 --> 00:45:34,425
I was worried about this.

612
00:45:34,427 --> 00:45:36,927
I'm simply talking
about their history.

613
00:45:36,927 --> 00:45:40,264
Nothing... Nothing more.
We have to see her. Hm?

614
00:45:40,264 --> 00:45:41,974
Act as if nothing has happened.

615
00:45:41,976 --> 00:45:44,436
Nothing has
happened.

616
00:45:45,438 --> 00:45:50,275
Sofya Andreyevna. At last, you honor us
with a visit.

617
00:45:50,276 --> 00:45:53,777
Well, I'm curious to see how things are
progressing here at Telyatinki.

618
00:45:53,778 --> 00:45:55,738
Well...

619
00:45:56,115 --> 00:45:57,449
What is it?

620
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:59,575
Ah, your mustache is...

621
00:46:00,535 --> 00:46:03,079
No, it's just a problem
with the wax.

622
00:46:04,456 --> 00:46:07,291
Vladimir Grigorevich, let me come straight
to the point.

623
00:46:07,293 --> 00:46:09,085
I don't wish to
be your enemy.

624
00:46:09,086 --> 00:46:12,963
On the contrary, I am delighted that my
husband has found a friend

625
00:46:12,965 --> 00:46:16,759
who understands
and shares his ideals.

626
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,179
I just want
what's reasonable.

627
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:24,309
I want an opportunity
to evaluate the new will.

628
00:46:25,061 --> 00:46:27,603
If you agree, then I'm sure
we can be friends.

629
00:46:27,604 --> 00:46:32,858
You are very kind, Sofya Andreyevna,
but I can't help you.

630
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:37,072
Not without specific instructions from
your husband.

631
00:46:39,575 --> 00:46:41,784
Oh, he has agreed.
Hasn't he, Valentin?

632
00:46:41,785 --> 00:46:46,163
No witness you produce can change my
position, I'm afraid.

633
00:46:46,164 --> 00:46:47,414
But I will, of course,

634
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:50,753
speak to Lev Nikolayevich
at the first opportunity.

635
00:46:53,923 --> 00:46:56,007
Very well.

636
00:46:56,008 --> 00:46:58,634
I want us to be
friends too, Sofya.

637
00:46:58,635 --> 00:47:03,264
Lev Nikolayevich is the most valuable
thing in the world, to both of us.

638
00:47:03,264 --> 00:47:05,307
We should endeavor to set things right
between us.

639
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:08,771
Give him peace.
Let him work.

640
00:47:09,854 --> 00:47:11,356
Yes.
Mm.

641
00:47:18,613 --> 00:47:22,740
Valentin Fedorovich, would you
accompany me to the house, please?

642
00:47:22,742 --> 00:47:24,577
I...

643
00:47:25,787 --> 00:47:28,956
Uh, I'll accompany the, ahem, countess back
to the house

644
00:47:28,956 --> 00:47:32,293
and be back in time
for supper.

645
00:47:33,253 --> 00:47:35,713
Masha will be overjoyed.

646
00:47:44,682 --> 00:47:48,226
Valentin Fedorovich, you've been keeping
something from me.

647
00:47:48,227 --> 00:47:50,354
Have I?

648
00:47:50,479 --> 00:47:53,648
You can tell me anything,
Valentin.

649
00:47:53,983 --> 00:47:56,401
I love a romance.

650
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,737
That's... It's nothing.
Really, it's nothing.

651
00:47:59,738 --> 00:48:01,822
A young woman
in your life is nothing?

652
00:48:01,822 --> 00:48:04,074
Masha is a friend.

653
00:48:04,075 --> 00:48:08,704
A lover?
A very... A very good friend.

654
00:48:08,706 --> 00:48:11,123
See, you forget that
I'm an experienced reader,

655
00:48:11,124 --> 00:48:15,461
so I can read your face,
every letter.

656
00:48:15,463 --> 00:48:18,088
It's beautifully clear.

657
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:19,633
Really?

658
00:48:20,468 --> 00:48:22,635
Do you love her?

659
00:48:24,262 --> 00:48:27,474
I think perhaps I do.
Yes.

660
00:48:32,063 --> 00:48:33,605
It's not something
they'd understand,

661
00:48:33,606 --> 00:48:35,773
these so-called disciples
of my husband's.

662
00:48:35,775 --> 00:48:39,278
They've never understood
a word he's ever written.

663
00:48:42,657 --> 00:48:45,492
What do they
know about love?

664
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:10,726
Let's try to be as efficient
as possible, get the job done,
and get back.

665
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:23,989
Whoa!

666
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:27,159
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

667
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,202
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

668
00:49:30,204 --> 00:49:32,371
Did I scare you? Are you all right?
Fine.

669
00:49:32,372 --> 00:49:34,623
I'm sorry.

670
00:49:34,624 --> 00:49:36,501
I got back as soon
as I could.

671
00:49:37,918 --> 00:49:40,880
It was a strange day.
Lev Nikolayevich is...

672
00:49:40,881 --> 00:49:46,470
I love to listen to him talk, but today
I could barely concentrate.

673
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,887
All...

674
00:49:48,889 --> 00:49:51,682
All I could think about
was you.

675
00:49:52,517 --> 00:49:56,019
I think I've confused you.
No.

676
00:49:56,021 --> 00:49:58,648
I think I've confused us both.
No.

677
00:49:58,816 --> 00:50:02,443
I... I was stupid.

678
00:50:03,195 --> 00:50:05,778
I was afraid,
but I'm not afraid anymore.

679
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,907
Whoa.
What are you...?

680
00:50:11,077 --> 00:50:13,122
Masha.

681
00:50:14,414 --> 00:50:17,084
I love you, Masha.

682
00:50:40,273 --> 00:50:42,316
Here.

683
00:50:48,782 --> 00:50:50,659
Masha.

684
00:50:53,246 --> 00:50:56,081
Masha! I have...

685
00:50:57,706 --> 00:51:00,125
In my heart,

686
00:51:00,126 --> 00:51:04,923
I have committed the act
of copulation many times!

687
00:51:10,762 --> 00:51:14,014
Please know it was never
like it was with you.

688
00:51:20,439 --> 00:51:22,733
I'll wait for you, then.

689
00:51:22,733 --> 00:51:24,610
You will?

690
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:27,153
Give me this.

691
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,617
What?
What are you laughing at?

692
00:51:32,325 --> 00:51:34,410
It's a problem with the wax.

693
00:51:39,206 --> 00:51:42,503
I think I look just like him.

694
00:51:45,673 --> 00:51:47,338
You're happy.

695
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,093
Well, of course I am.

696
00:51:49,677 --> 00:51:54,014
Love and be loved. That's the only reality
there is in the world.

697
00:51:54,139 --> 00:51:56,517
He said that?

698
00:51:56,976 --> 00:52:00,396
Yes, Tolstoy said it,
but I'm saying it.

699
00:52:02,064 --> 00:52:05,442
I'm saying it, Masha,
because you make me know it.

700
00:52:05,443 --> 00:52:09,278
I look into your eyes
and I can see the future.

701
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:14,492
I think you're the bravest
person I've ever met.

702
00:52:15,827 --> 00:52:18,372
You amaze me.

703
00:52:18,872 --> 00:52:22,376
You believe more
than I know how to.

704
00:52:24,043 --> 00:52:26,213
I love you.

705
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,552
You're pure, Valya.

706
00:52:37,514 --> 00:52:40,519
You're what
I came here to find.

707
00:52:57,369 --> 00:53:00,539
Ivan, who's wearing
that awful perfume?

708
00:53:06,253 --> 00:53:10,047
I understand this is difficult.
It is a delicate situation.

709
00:53:10,048 --> 00:53:11,967
This way.

710
00:53:11,968 --> 00:53:16,555
This must be discussed now.
It cannot wait any longer.

711
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:18,722
Whatever happens,
Mother mustn't find out.

712
00:53:18,724 --> 00:53:20,224
Shh.

713
00:53:20,726 --> 00:53:24,563
I hate to say it, but the countess has
become more and more dangerous.

714
00:53:24,564 --> 00:53:28,606
Oh, not dangerous. She's concerned for
the welfare of the family.

715
00:53:28,608 --> 00:53:31,985
And we're concerned
with the welfare of mankind.

716
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:38,701
You've been more
than reasonable.

717
00:53:38,702 --> 00:53:40,244
Have I?

718
00:53:40,246 --> 00:53:41,954
Of course you have.

719
00:53:41,956 --> 00:53:44,456
She already controls
the income from your property.

720
00:53:44,456 --> 00:53:47,585
Please, listen to him, Papa.
He has our best interests at heart.

721
00:53:47,586 --> 00:53:50,922
We are speaking only of the rights to
your words, your ideas.

722
00:53:50,923 --> 00:53:53,090
With all love and respect,

723
00:53:53,092 --> 00:53:57,220
the countess is too interested
in making a profit from your work.

724
00:54:02,642 --> 00:54:06,438
She's my wife. She's part of me.
We've been together all these years.

725
00:54:06,439 --> 00:54:10,065
But you're more than a husband and father.
She must understand that.

726
00:54:10,066 --> 00:54:12,777
The best interests of the people
are one with your own.

727
00:54:12,778 --> 00:54:13,943
You belong to them.

728
00:54:13,945 --> 00:54:17,447
She won't.
She'll never understand.

729
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,326
What is she doing?

730
00:54:20,327 --> 00:54:22,952
She's unstable.
I wonder if she isn't ill.

731
00:54:22,954 --> 00:54:24,121
It's sadly more
than probable.

732
00:54:24,122 --> 00:54:27,083
I know it's hard for you, Papa,
but you must be realistic.

733
00:54:27,084 --> 00:54:29,711
Her behavior is extremely alarming.

734
00:54:30,296 --> 00:54:34,257
Do you truly think that she is fit to
control the final disposition of this will?

735
00:54:34,258 --> 00:54:35,759
Well, I don't... I don't...

736
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,385
How dare... Aah!

737
00:54:38,302 --> 00:54:41,055
God!
Oh, God.

738
00:54:41,182 --> 00:54:43,516
What are you doing?

739
00:54:43,517 --> 00:54:48,063
You're all plotting against me,
in my own house too!

740
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:51,190
I bear you 13 children.

741
00:54:51,191 --> 00:54:55,068
How can you
betray me like this?

742
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,990
Somebody, help me up.

743
00:55:00,867 --> 00:55:03,829
Go ahead. Go ahead.

744
00:55:04,037 --> 00:55:06,623
Why don't you give everything
we've got to him?

745
00:55:06,624 --> 00:55:07,914
Your fat little catamite!

746
00:55:07,916 --> 00:55:12,211
"What will it be, my dearest darling,
my Vladimir Grigorevich?

747
00:55:12,213 --> 00:55:15,882
My wife's heart on a platter?
Her kidneys, with salt?

748
00:55:15,883 --> 00:55:18,675
But of course, my dear Chertkov.
Whatever pleases you.

749
00:55:18,677 --> 00:55:19,969
The china, the estate,

750
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:22,556
permanent copyright
on anything I've ever written?

751
00:55:22,557 --> 00:55:25,976
Oh, anything for you,
my love."

752
00:55:31,691 --> 00:55:33,356
Give that to me.
No.

753
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:36,027
Give it to me, you little weasel!
Sofya!

754
00:55:36,028 --> 00:55:38,572
Give it to me! Give it to me!
Sofya.

755
00:55:39,197 --> 00:55:40,447
Now...
Can I have...?

756
00:55:40,447 --> 00:55:42,865
Can I not have some...?

757
00:55:42,867 --> 00:55:47,579
Can I not have some...?
You'll kill him, Mama.

758
00:55:47,581 --> 00:55:51,876
Well, that's what you want,
isn't it? You want him to die!

759
00:55:51,878 --> 00:55:53,836
Lev.

760
00:55:56,506 --> 00:56:00,177
It's all right, it's all right.
Let's get him out of here.

761
00:56:08,102 --> 00:56:10,769
You don't deceive me
for one moment.

762
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:14,358
I know exactly
what you're doing.

763
00:56:17,985 --> 00:56:20,322
I want to see the will.

764
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:24,701
It is my right as his wife
in the sight of God.

765
00:56:24,702 --> 00:56:26,994
What are you afraid of?

766
00:56:26,996 --> 00:56:29,039
You.

767
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:31,081
I'm afraid of you.

768
00:56:33,043 --> 00:56:34,835
The press are
bloodthirsty, Sofya.

769
00:56:34,836 --> 00:56:38,047
Had I wished,
I could have demolished you.

770
00:56:38,048 --> 00:56:39,257
You make it easy.

771
00:56:39,258 --> 00:56:41,800
Then tell them anything
you want. Go ahead. Ruin us!

772
00:56:41,802 --> 00:56:45,221
I have too much respect
for Lev Nikolayevich!

773
00:56:45,222 --> 00:56:46,597
You're lucky!

774
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:49,182
Why can't my husband
see you for what you are?

775
00:56:49,184 --> 00:56:54,438
If I had a wife like you,
I would've blown my brains out!

776
00:56:54,439 --> 00:56:57,735
Or gone to America.

777
00:57:40,985 --> 00:57:43,278
I hope you're feeling better.

778
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,822
Mm.

779
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:50,871
Do you like the opera?

780
00:57:50,954 --> 00:57:52,914
Yes.

781
00:57:57,836 --> 00:58:01,840
I'm very sorry
about everything.

782
00:58:07,177 --> 00:58:10,224
This aria is so beautiful.

783
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:14,684
It's about a woman who's been abandoned
by the man she loves.

784
00:58:14,686 --> 00:58:17,648
Everyone finds that
very moving...

785
00:58:18,316 --> 00:58:20,608
in the opera.

786
00:58:31,537 --> 00:58:35,164
Our life together
has become intolerable.

787
00:58:35,331 --> 00:58:36,875
Sit down, Valentin.

788
00:58:36,876 --> 00:58:38,250
Really, I'm expected
at Telyatinki.

789
00:58:38,251 --> 00:58:40,211
No, no, no, please.
Come, enjoy your dinner.

790
00:58:40,213 --> 00:58:44,298
We've just had a disagreement,
like all married couples.

791
00:58:44,717 --> 00:58:48,510
Despite good cause for it,
I have never stopped loving you.

792
00:58:48,512 --> 00:58:50,387
Of course.

793
00:58:50,389 --> 00:58:52,306
But God knows
you don't make it easy.

794
00:58:52,307 --> 00:58:53,516
Why should it be easy?

795
00:58:53,517 --> 00:58:55,934
I am the work of your life,
you're the work of mine.

796
00:58:55,936 --> 00:58:58,689
That's what love is.

797
00:58:59,273 --> 00:59:01,150
I should go.
No, sit down.

798
00:59:02,276 --> 00:59:07,238
Oh, so that's what love is?
Eh?

799
00:59:07,365 --> 00:59:08,572
Does that surprise you, boy?

800
00:59:08,572 --> 00:59:10,534
I thought it might be
a touch quieter, but...

801
00:59:11,452 --> 00:59:12,952
God bless you.
Bless you.

802
00:59:12,954 --> 00:59:15,539
He's right, though.

803
00:59:16,081 --> 00:59:19,333
If we can't live a decent, quiet life,

804
00:59:19,334 --> 00:59:24,130
if I can't work and find some
peace, then I shall go away.

805
00:59:24,131 --> 00:59:27,592
Go?
Not to Chertkov, but I shall go.

806
00:59:27,593 --> 00:59:31,305
Go where?
Dushan says you're killing me!

807
00:59:32,847 --> 00:59:35,642
Then go!
Go anywhere you please!

808
00:59:36,352 --> 00:59:39,271
Go anywhere you please!

809
00:59:39,564 --> 00:59:42,273
I hate you!

810
00:59:43,108 --> 00:59:45,068
I hate what you've become!

811
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:48,320
Countess.
Go. No.

812
00:59:48,322 --> 00:59:49,865
Dushan!

813
00:59:50,447 --> 00:59:53,827
Oh, God.
Countess?

814
00:59:53,827 --> 00:59:56,746
Countess! Is she all right?

815
00:59:56,747 --> 00:59:58,289
Is she all right?

816
00:59:58,291 --> 01:00:02,960
Sofya. Sofya, are you all right?
Open your eyes.

817
01:00:02,961 --> 01:00:04,671
Open your eyes.

818
01:00:05,798 --> 01:00:08,048
Oh! Oh, my back!

819
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:09,802
Oh, my... Oh!

820
01:00:09,802 --> 01:00:11,552
Oh, my back.

821
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:14,639
You're lying on a fork.

822
01:00:17,142 --> 01:00:20,061
Sit up and you'll
improve markedly.

823
01:00:20,271 --> 01:00:22,980
If you'll be good enough
to take her upstairs.

824
01:00:22,981 --> 01:00:26,110
Come along, countess,
come with me.

825
01:00:45,588 --> 01:00:47,296
Masha.

826
01:00:59,852 --> 01:01:01,769
I'm sorry.

827
01:01:04,231 --> 01:01:06,023
It was terrible there today.

828
01:01:06,983 --> 01:01:10,818
They loved each other so much,
I'm sure of it, I'm sure they do,

829
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:14,532
but you see what it becomes,
and you just wish that you could...

830
01:01:18,662 --> 01:01:20,831
Is something
the matter?

831
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:22,916
Masha?

832
01:01:25,418 --> 01:01:29,088
I'm... I'm going back
to Moscow.

833
01:01:29,381 --> 01:01:30,548
What?

834
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:33,884
Chertkov spoke with me
this afternoon.

835
01:01:33,885 --> 01:01:37,054
He said I could
be more useful there.

836
01:01:37,055 --> 01:01:39,266
Which means...
Means he's punishing us.

837
01:01:39,267 --> 01:01:41,893
He's punishing me.

838
01:01:41,894 --> 01:01:44,728
He's punishing me for befriending
Sofya Andreyevna.

839
01:01:44,729 --> 01:01:46,021
This is Chertkov.

840
01:01:46,023 --> 01:01:48,231
We've both disappointed him,
but I don't care.

841
01:01:48,233 --> 01:01:50,402
I don't care either,
but you can't leave.

842
01:01:50,403 --> 01:01:53,528
I'm going to talk to him. I'm going to
make him make you stay.

843
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:57,409
No. I want to go.
Yes. What?

844
01:01:57,577 --> 01:02:00,079
I'm leaving the movement.

845
01:02:05,543 --> 01:02:08,043
Sit down, sit down.

846
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:11,088
You can't leave Tolstoy.
I'm not.

847
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:14,008
You can't leave.
No, I'm not.

848
01:02:15,177 --> 01:02:17,596
When I read his confession,
it moved me, Valya.

849
01:02:17,597 --> 01:02:18,804
Yes.

850
01:02:18,805 --> 01:02:21,097
When he was searching
for freedom.

851
01:02:21,099 --> 01:02:24,434
Freedom from anger,
freedom from attachment,

852
01:02:24,436 --> 01:02:28,188
freedom from all the superstition
and the nonsense of the Church.

853
01:02:28,189 --> 01:02:31,358
I mean, it moved me
so much.

854
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,903
And that's what I thought
it would be about.

855
01:02:33,905 --> 01:02:36,447
I mean, isn't that
what it's about?

856
01:02:36,447 --> 01:02:39,075
Freedom and love?

857
01:02:40,912 --> 01:02:43,914
They mix it all up.

858
01:02:49,293 --> 01:02:51,505
Come with me.

859
01:02:53,798 --> 01:02:55,758
Please?

860
01:03:10,316 --> 01:03:11,858
I can't.

861
01:03:22,662 --> 01:03:26,497
I'm going to my room.
Wait.

862
01:03:27,499 --> 01:03:29,459
Masha.

863
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,845
Masha, please. I can't.

864
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:43,097
I need you.

865
01:03:48,144 --> 01:03:50,189
I know you do.

866
01:03:52,023 --> 01:03:54,485
I know.

867
01:04:06,037 --> 01:04:09,874
A-Y. A-Y.

868
01:04:10,668 --> 01:04:13,378
A-Y.

869
01:04:14,881 --> 01:04:17,800
What was it?
I don't remember.

870
01:04:18,633 --> 01:04:22,721
Was it your...?
No, no, no.

871
01:04:22,722 --> 01:04:25,432
You rest now.

872
01:04:26,474 --> 01:04:28,519
You rest.

873
01:05:02,845 --> 01:05:05,514
Is everything in order?

874
01:05:21,363 --> 01:05:23,405
Good afternoon,
Lev Nikolayevich.

875
01:05:23,407 --> 01:05:25,242
Is it?

876
01:05:40,298 --> 01:05:43,259
Remember that this will ensure

877
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:46,135
that your complete works
will live in the public domain.

878
01:05:46,137 --> 01:05:47,806
Monumentous.

879
01:05:47,807 --> 01:05:52,018
Your works are the birthright
of the Russian people.

880
01:05:52,019 --> 01:05:56,773
And now they will
possess them forever.

881
01:05:58,276 --> 01:06:00,235
Yes?

882
01:06:00,485 --> 01:06:02,653
I need a pen.

883
01:06:02,655 --> 01:06:05,990
Oh. Of course, of course.

884
01:06:06,617 --> 01:06:09,244
I, uh...
What?

885
01:06:13,499 --> 01:06:15,125
I don't seem
to have a pen.

886
01:06:15,126 --> 01:06:17,543
You're a secretary.
How can you not have a pen?

887
01:06:17,543 --> 01:06:20,798
He's a secretary too.
Ask him.

888
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:24,384
Valentin Fedorovich,
do you have a pen?

889
01:06:24,385 --> 01:06:26,387
I...

890
01:06:34,269 --> 01:06:36,188
Yes.

891
01:06:36,856 --> 01:06:39,273
Yes, I have a pen.

892
01:06:53,372 --> 01:06:55,624
Are you all right?

893
01:06:57,168 --> 01:06:59,168
I'm a conspirator.

894
01:06:59,543 --> 01:07:01,255
Nothing more.

895
01:07:35,581 --> 01:07:37,914
Lev Nikolayevich.

896
01:07:37,916 --> 01:07:40,960
May I ask you a question that has nothing
to do with the work?

897
01:07:40,961 --> 01:07:42,921
Of course, my dear.

898
01:07:43,421 --> 01:07:46,090
Do you love your wife?

899
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:50,844
You see, when I was
courting Sofya,

900
01:07:50,845 --> 01:07:54,639
she was so young
and so pure

901
01:07:54,849 --> 01:07:58,353
it just seemed impossible
that I could ever have her.

902
01:07:58,354 --> 01:08:02,106
I didn't want to tell her
how I felt, and yet...

903
01:08:02,108 --> 01:08:05,277
I wanted to tell her
nothing else.

904
01:08:05,278 --> 01:08:07,278
So I wrote down
a string of letters

905
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,030
and asked her
if she would decipher them.

906
01:08:10,032 --> 01:08:14,242
At first, she was completely
confused and thought it was
some sort of game or something.

907
01:08:14,244 --> 01:08:16,829
So I gave her a clue.
One clue.

908
01:08:17,289 --> 01:08:22,126
"The first two Y's," I said,
"stand for 'your youth,"'

909
01:08:22,127 --> 01:08:24,086
and that was all I said.

910
01:08:24,087 --> 01:08:25,670
And then...

911
01:08:26,088 --> 01:08:29,217
the most miraculous thing
happened.

912
01:08:29,676 --> 01:08:32,929
She simply spoke
the phrase:

913
01:08:33,637 --> 01:08:38,057
"Your youth and your desire
for happiness

914
01:08:38,058 --> 01:08:40,728
cruelly remind me of my age

915
01:08:40,728 --> 01:08:44,774
and the impossibility
of happiness for me."

916
01:08:45,609 --> 01:08:48,652
The entire phrase, my phrase.

917
01:08:48,777 --> 01:08:51,780
As if she'd read my mind.

918
01:08:52,824 --> 01:08:56,828
In that moment, we both knew
we would always be together.

919
01:08:57,494 --> 01:09:00,914
And for the first few years,
we were

920
01:09:00,915 --> 01:09:03,083
incredibly,

921
01:09:03,085 --> 01:09:05,670
terrifyingly...

922
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:09,841
happy.

923
01:09:16,932 --> 01:09:19,475
And now this.

924
01:09:36,661 --> 01:09:38,411
I'm leaving Telyatinki.

925
01:09:38,828 --> 01:09:40,037
Really?

926
01:09:40,038 --> 01:09:42,623
Yes. I'm going to Moscow.

927
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:45,042
She's leading you around
by the nose, my boy.

928
01:09:45,043 --> 01:09:48,503
Look, you say that
the movement is about love.

929
01:09:48,504 --> 01:09:51,715
And it is. The love
that he teaches us.

930
01:09:51,716 --> 01:09:54,677
The love that binds
all mankind together.

931
01:09:54,679 --> 01:09:56,679
I've never met mankind.

932
01:09:56,679 --> 01:10:00,557
I've only ever met men or women.
Imperfect men, imperfect women.

933
01:10:00,558 --> 01:10:03,310
Yes. But Lev Nikolayevich
also teaches us

934
01:10:03,311 --> 01:10:08,149
that love cannot be weak-minded.
It cannot be stupid.

935
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:15,239
Go. We will miss you.

936
01:10:16,156 --> 01:10:19,201
Our naive sentimentalist.

937
01:10:20,829 --> 01:10:23,205
Keep clear.

938
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:26,960
BO Y:
Give it to me.

939
01:10:35,094 --> 01:10:37,637
Leovochka?
Hm?

940
01:10:43,393 --> 01:10:47,354
Kashnikov wants to buy the rights to
your work after your death.

941
01:10:47,355 --> 01:10:49,940
Oh, then I shall try and die
as soon as is convenient.

942
01:10:49,942 --> 01:10:52,318
Oh, come on, don't be silly.
Come, look.

943
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:56,739
Look, he has offered
1 million rubles.

944
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:00,242
How can you not be pleased?

945
01:11:00,243 --> 01:11:02,286
I don't write for publishers,
I write for people.

946
01:11:02,286 --> 01:11:03,703
Well, where are
you going?

947
01:11:03,704 --> 01:11:06,664
Valentin is in the library.
He wants to see me.

948
01:11:06,665 --> 01:11:10,795
Fine! Fine, go ahead and let your
wretched family starve.

949
01:11:10,878 --> 01:11:14,256
I don't see anyone starving
in this house.

950
01:11:14,257 --> 01:11:16,091
On the contrary,

951
01:11:16,092 --> 01:11:18,844
our privilege revolts me.

952
01:11:18,844 --> 01:11:21,097
Well, you're the first
to the trough!

953
01:11:22,973 --> 01:11:25,476
Always have been.

954
01:12:04,014 --> 01:12:06,809
Now, what is it, my boy?

955
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:09,228
You look unhappy.

956
01:12:10,187 --> 01:12:12,690
What do you
want to tell me?

957
01:12:22,284 --> 01:12:24,326
Sofya!

958
01:12:24,536 --> 01:12:26,661
Sofya!

959
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:33,835
What are you doing?

960
01:12:33,962 --> 01:12:37,589
How could you
do this to me?

961
01:12:38,048 --> 01:12:39,382
You're not well.

962
01:12:39,384 --> 01:12:43,596
You... You just hurt me
again and again.

963
01:12:43,597 --> 01:12:47,893
You tear pieces off me
until there's nothing left.

964
01:12:49,393 --> 01:12:52,896
I don't know who I am anymore.

965
01:12:55,734 --> 01:12:58,652
I read your diary.

966
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,989
I know what
you've done.

967
01:13:02,615 --> 01:13:04,951
You behave like this,
I have no choice.

968
01:13:06,869 --> 01:13:08,537
Now give me the gun.
No!

969
01:13:08,538 --> 01:13:11,625
Please, countess.
Give me the gun, please.

970
01:13:56,002 --> 01:13:59,088
I'd like you to
stay here tonight.

971
01:14:01,634 --> 01:14:03,134
Yes, of course.

972
01:14:27,659 --> 01:14:28,909
Valentin.

973
01:14:28,911 --> 01:14:30,202
Get up.
What?

974
01:14:30,203 --> 01:14:32,454
He's leaving.

975
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:38,460
Shh!

976
01:14:42,841 --> 01:14:46,009
Pack essentials only.

977
01:14:46,177 --> 01:14:49,762
Nothing that isn't
absolutely necessary.

978
01:14:49,763 --> 01:14:51,515
Please, we must hurry.

979
01:14:51,516 --> 01:14:53,391
Where will you go?
Your coat, Papa.

980
01:14:53,393 --> 01:14:55,101
We don't need a plan,
we just go.

981
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:58,230
A lantern, I think.
It's very dark tonight.

982
01:14:58,231 --> 01:15:01,484
And the apparatus
for giving an enema.

983
01:15:09,451 --> 01:15:11,911
Everything's ready.

984
01:15:16,958 --> 01:15:19,210
Dushan, you all right?

985
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:20,877
Please, go steady.

986
01:15:20,878 --> 01:15:22,587
You all right?

987
01:15:22,588 --> 01:15:24,548
Papa?

988
01:15:27,886 --> 01:15:29,886
He's changed
his mind.

989
01:15:29,887 --> 01:15:32,264
He's going back
to the house.

990
01:16:03,504 --> 01:16:06,382
Do you want
to go back?

991
01:16:08,009 --> 01:16:10,094
No.

992
01:16:11,304 --> 01:16:15,768
This life is behind me now.

993
01:16:30,865 --> 01:16:33,451
Help me up.
Yes, of course.

994
01:16:43,128 --> 01:16:45,296
Give this to Sofya.

995
01:16:45,297 --> 01:16:47,423
Yes.

996
01:16:52,262 --> 01:16:55,263
Be well, be well.

997
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:07,025
Don't cry, don't cry.

998
01:17:07,027 --> 01:17:09,570
I'll send for you when I can.

999
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:24,627
Drive on.

1000
01:17:47,942 --> 01:17:50,237
He's gone.

1001
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:53,780
For good?
I think so, yes.

1002
01:17:55,909 --> 01:17:59,369
Oh, Sasha, darling, I know you know
where your father is.

1003
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:02,539
So, darling, please,
this is not a time to
play games, please?

1004
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:07,335
Countess, I have this for you.

1005
01:18:15,887 --> 01:18:21,141
<i>My position in the house
has become intolerable.</i>

1006
01:18:21,143 --> 01:18:26,188
<i>What I'm doing now is what
people have commonly done,</i>

1007
01:18:26,313 --> 01:18:28,399
<i>leave their worldly life behind</i>

1008
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:33,780
<i>to spend their last days
in peace and solitude.</i>

1009
01:18:38,786 --> 01:18:41,454
The pond.

1010
01:18:42,496 --> 01:18:44,707
Mama!
Countess!

1011
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:45,916
Please, Mama!

1012
01:18:45,917 --> 01:18:48,752
<i>Please understand this
and don't come after me,</i>

1013
01:18:48,753 --> 01:18:51,505
<i>even if you find out where I am.</i>

1014
01:18:51,505 --> 01:18:54,382
<i>Your coming would only
make our position worse</i>

1015
01:18:54,384 --> 01:18:56,760
<i>and would not alter my decision.</i>

1016
01:18:56,761 --> 01:18:59,137
Mother!

1017
01:19:00,264 --> 01:19:04,226
<i>I beg you to forgive me
for everything I've done to you,</i>

1018
01:19:04,228 --> 01:19:07,230
<i>just as I forgive you
with all my soul</i>

1019
01:19:07,563 --> 01:19:10,525
<i>for everything you've done to me.</i>

1020
01:19:18,826 --> 01:19:20,451
Countess!

1021
01:19:26,333 --> 01:19:28,585
Mama!

1022
01:19:29,545 --> 01:19:31,670
Mama!

1023
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,217
Mama!
I have her!

1024
01:19:38,554 --> 01:19:44,350
Here! Here! Take her! Take her.
Mama!

1025
01:19:48,812 --> 01:19:53,442
Ivan, Ivan, go to the house.
Get a doctor, quickly, quickly!

1026
01:19:53,735 --> 01:19:57,446
Turn her.
Turn her over, come on.

1027
01:20:02,244 --> 01:20:04,911
Oh, God. Thank God.

1028
01:20:19,761 --> 01:20:24,766
Ivan, go to the station.
Find out which train he took.

1029
01:20:24,932 --> 01:20:26,851
For God's sake.

1030
01:20:27,393 --> 01:20:30,520
Come, come, come.
Let's get you to bed.

1031
01:20:30,521 --> 01:20:34,232
Ready and up. There we...
Let's go, there.

1032
01:20:37,654 --> 01:20:39,905
Thank you.

1033
01:21:01,386 --> 01:21:04,763
Here, tea.

1034
01:21:05,432 --> 01:21:07,850
She's exhausted
herself.

1035
01:21:07,851 --> 01:21:10,185
She slept for
nearly four hours.

1036
01:21:10,186 --> 01:21:14,355
Well, I'm glad she can sleep.
The pain subsides a little.

1037
01:21:14,356 --> 01:21:17,652
The noise subsides
a little.

1038
01:21:20,989 --> 01:21:23,031
Come in.

1039
01:21:23,408 --> 01:21:26,576
A message, miss.
For me?

1040
01:21:26,869 --> 01:21:28,663
From your father.

1041
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:35,961
<i>My darling Sasha, I have stopped
to rest at Shamardino.</i>

1042
01:21:35,962 --> 01:21:39,047
<i>I'll wait for you to join me here.</i>

1043
01:21:39,048 --> 01:21:42,676
<i>Please ask Valentin to stay
and look after your mother.</i>

1044
01:21:42,677 --> 01:21:47,222
<i>When you arrive, we'll continue
the journey south together.</i>

1045
01:21:47,223 --> 01:21:48,975
<i>Your loving father.</i>

1046
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:07,243
They've all gone.

1047
01:22:07,701 --> 01:22:09,870
I'm here.

1048
01:22:12,289 --> 01:22:14,166
Oh...

1049
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:18,671
You're writing to your girl.
Oh, how lovely.

1050
01:22:18,672 --> 01:22:21,465
I'm not sure she is my girl.

1051
01:22:21,466 --> 01:22:23,717
But you believe
you'll see her again.

1052
01:22:23,719 --> 01:22:26,011
I very much hope so.
Yes.

1053
01:22:26,012 --> 01:22:27,929
Yes.

1054
01:22:28,807 --> 01:22:32,310
I know you know
where he is, Valentin.

1055
01:22:33,353 --> 01:22:38,148
Sofya Andreyevna...
I won't ask you to betray his trust.

1056
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:41,735
I just need you
to go to him. I do.

1057
01:22:41,737 --> 01:22:44,738
I have to see him.
I have to talk to him.

1058
01:22:44,739 --> 01:22:48,951
I won't make a scene.
You can promise him that. I...

1059
01:22:50,786 --> 01:22:53,539
I just want to see him.

1060
01:23:04,634 --> 01:23:08,721
"Tolstoy abandons home,
whereabouts unknown."

1061
01:23:08,722 --> 01:23:12,056
"The sage of Yasnaya Polyana
takes flight."

1062
01:23:12,057 --> 01:23:14,518
That's Tolstoy.

1063
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:18,146
I hope it's not
too much for him.

1064
01:23:25,696 --> 01:23:27,655
Ah... Where are we?

1065
01:23:27,656 --> 01:23:29,741
It's all right.
Everything's fine.

1066
01:23:30,994 --> 01:23:33,870
Shh, shh, shh.
Let me take your temperature.

1067
01:23:36,081 --> 01:23:38,210
Come on.

1068
01:24:06,404 --> 01:24:09,197
Be mindful of these steps.

1069
01:24:21,962 --> 01:24:25,213
We've come
to the end of the world.

1070
01:24:47,612 --> 01:24:49,445
This is the stationmaster.

1071
01:24:49,446 --> 01:24:52,324
He's very kind. He said we may have
his home for as long as we want it.

1072
01:24:52,326 --> 01:24:55,118
There are no inns nearby,
so we are lucky.

1073
01:24:55,119 --> 01:24:57,453
Yes, very lucky.
Yes.

1074
01:24:57,454 --> 01:24:59,707
You'll be comfortable
here, Papa.

1075
01:24:59,708 --> 01:25:03,793
The rest of us, we'll find cots,
or sleep in the station.

1076
01:25:03,795 --> 01:25:05,296
And then we'll be on our way.

1077
01:25:05,297 --> 01:25:09,759
Yes. Yes, Papa.
We'll be on our way.

1078
01:25:16,516 --> 01:25:18,058
Excuse me?

1079
01:25:19,518 --> 01:25:21,771
I'd like to send
a telegram, please.

1080
01:25:22,646 --> 01:25:24,315
Uh...

1081
01:25:24,317 --> 01:25:26,567
At Astapovo. Stop.

1082
01:25:27,652 --> 01:25:30,987
Tolstoy ill. Stop.

1083
01:25:31,697 --> 01:25:33,240
Temperature high.

1084
01:25:33,616 --> 01:25:37,661
<i>You can send it to Countess Sofya
Andreyevna Tolstoya,</i>

1085
01:25:37,661 --> 01:25:40,748
<i>Yasnaya Polyana, Tula Province.</i>

1086
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:44,835
Please come back.
Please come back.

1087
01:25:56,097 --> 01:25:59,141
Concern for Lev Nikolayevich's
health has been expressed

1088
01:25:59,143 --> 01:26:02,269
by people as diverse as
Mr. Henry James

1089
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:04,355
and Mr. Joseph Conrad.

1090
01:26:04,356 --> 01:26:08,317
Lev Nikolayevich's temperature currently
stands at 40 degrees Celsius.

1091
01:26:08,317 --> 01:26:10,485
That is 104 degrees
Fahrenheit.

1092
01:26:10,487 --> 01:26:13,948
His blood pressure, which is hypertonic,
is 180 over 100.

1093
01:26:13,949 --> 01:26:15,908
However, it should be added,

1094
01:26:15,909 --> 01:26:18,202
Lev Nikolayevich's manner

1095
01:26:18,203 --> 01:26:19,994
and mental acuity
Bulgakov!

1096
01:26:19,995 --> 01:26:22,373
is as great as ever.

1097
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:24,875
Where is he? Take me to him.
This way.

1098
01:26:24,875 --> 01:26:27,670
He left. It's astonishing.
He actually finally left.

1099
01:26:27,670 --> 01:26:32,174
He was very sick, too sick to travel.
It's a triumph for the movement.

1100
01:26:42,893 --> 01:26:45,480
He looks so small.

1101
01:26:46,021 --> 01:26:48,149
Papa.

1102
01:26:49,652 --> 01:26:52,195
Oh, it's you.

1103
01:26:52,404 --> 01:26:55,530
My dear friend,

1104
01:26:55,531 --> 01:26:57,783
what is all of this?

1105
01:26:57,784 --> 01:27:01,411
Well, I needed
to see you.

1106
01:27:02,289 --> 01:27:04,039
Thank you.

1107
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:07,835
We have so much to do.

1108
01:27:09,378 --> 01:27:12,255
Have you seen Sofya?

1109
01:27:12,423 --> 01:27:15,009
I've made a point not to.

1110
01:27:15,176 --> 01:27:17,052
She'll come.

1111
01:27:17,054 --> 01:27:20,597
I don't know when she'll come,
but she'll come. I know that.

1112
01:27:20,598 --> 01:27:23,976
And we'll be ready.
Ready for what?

1113
01:27:27,105 --> 01:27:29,899
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
it's time for your enema.

1114
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,942
Don't apologize,
my friend.

1115
01:27:31,942 --> 01:27:34,945
Your enemas have become the
news of the world.

1116
01:28:27,831 --> 01:28:31,460
My only concern is getting
the copy back to London in time.

1117
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:33,503
Good morning, gentlemen.

1118
01:28:37,174 --> 01:28:39,592
I'm sure you will all be
as relieved as I am

1119
01:28:39,594 --> 01:28:44,598
that Lev Nikolayevich slept
a relatively peaceful night.

1120
01:28:44,891 --> 01:28:48,601
His temperature remains
40 degrees Celsius.

1121
01:28:48,603 --> 01:28:50,980
And his blood pressure
is also hypertonic.

1122
01:28:50,981 --> 01:28:53,356
That having been said, however,

1123
01:28:53,357 --> 01:28:57,194
his mind remains agile
and full of fortitude.

1124
01:28:57,195 --> 01:28:59,904
It's the countess.
Of course, we have to remember...

1125
01:28:59,905 --> 01:29:01,739
Is she here?
It's the countess.

1126
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:04,243
Let's see.
Where is she?

1127
01:29:04,244 --> 01:29:07,829
It's the countess!
Which car is it?

1128
01:29:26,391 --> 01:29:29,268
The Countess!
There she is.

1129
01:29:29,728 --> 01:29:31,937
Countess Sofya.

1130
01:29:33,272 --> 01:29:34,731
She's coming this way.

1131
01:29:34,732 --> 01:29:38,444
Not before she stops to tell them lies,
catalog my atrocities.

1132
01:29:38,445 --> 01:29:40,904
Let me talk to her.

1133
01:29:40,905 --> 01:29:42,990
I want to see my husband.

1134
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:44,574
Yes.

1135
01:29:44,576 --> 01:29:46,244
I'll, um...

1136
01:29:46,453 --> 01:29:48,703
I want to see him now!

1137
01:29:48,704 --> 01:29:50,830
Countess! Countess!

1138
01:29:50,831 --> 01:29:53,833
Oh, Valentin.
I want to see him, please.

1139
01:29:53,835 --> 01:29:56,086
I'm not sure now
is the right time, countess.

1140
01:29:56,087 --> 01:29:58,756
Yes, it is.
It's the right time for me.

1141
01:29:58,757 --> 01:30:01,174
Have you had any contact?

1142
01:30:02,302 --> 01:30:05,386
It might be a better idea, countess,
I really think, if you just waited...

1143
01:30:05,387 --> 01:30:06,846
He only left because of you.

1144
01:30:06,847 --> 01:30:08,725
Countess!

1145
01:30:16,106 --> 01:30:17,565
I want to see my husband.

1146
01:30:17,567 --> 01:30:19,818
He's too weak
to see you now, Mother.

1147
01:30:19,819 --> 01:30:22,946
He's not too weak to see you.
Not too weak to see that... Pfft.

1148
01:30:22,947 --> 01:30:25,574
Do you really want
to do this here?

1149
01:30:25,576 --> 01:30:30,328
So I am the leper outside the gate, while
he sleeps with the devil himself.

1150
01:30:30,329 --> 01:30:34,542
Chertkov is here because Father
asked him to be here.

1151
01:30:35,627 --> 01:30:39,504
Is that true?
Yes.

1152
01:30:42,259 --> 01:30:46,262
Well, did you tell him that
I nearly drowned in the pond?

1153
01:30:46,512 --> 01:30:49,681
We didn't need to.
It's been in all the papers.

1154
01:30:49,682 --> 01:30:52,393
Please, let me take you back.
What did he say?

1155
01:30:53,311 --> 01:30:57,106
He said that if you killed
yourself, he'd be upset.

1156
01:30:58,275 --> 01:31:02,987
He'd be upset?
Horribly upset.

1157
01:31:03,362 --> 01:31:05,823
But he could not have
acted other than he did.

1158
01:31:05,824 --> 01:31:07,991
I want to see him.

1159
01:31:09,578 --> 01:31:12,162
He's my husband.
He's not your husband.

1160
01:31:12,163 --> 01:31:13,454
Oh, you're unbearable.

1161
01:31:13,455 --> 01:31:17,085
And you are a stone-hearted
bitch of a daughter.

1162
01:31:19,253 --> 01:31:20,753
I lost five children!

1163
01:31:20,754 --> 01:31:23,298
Why couldn't one of them
have been you?

1164
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:27,179
Did she just say that?

1165
01:31:27,721 --> 01:31:30,181
Are you finished?

1166
01:31:36,353 --> 01:31:38,521
Valentin, would you
take me back, please?

1167
01:31:38,522 --> 01:31:40,817
Yes, of course.

1168
01:31:42,862 --> 01:31:46,780
Please, make way.
Make way. Make way.

1169
01:31:48,451 --> 01:31:52,578
I've behaved rather badly, haven't I?
No, countess.

1170
01:31:52,579 --> 01:31:54,830
No, don't worry.

1171
01:33:04,567 --> 01:33:08,154
Here. For you.

1172
01:33:14,869 --> 01:33:17,914
Is this clean?
Of course it's clean.

1173
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,252
Dushan,
what's the matter?

1174
01:33:23,253 --> 01:33:25,462
Listen to him.

1175
01:33:25,463 --> 01:33:28,673
I'm supposed to be
a doctor, for God's sake.

1176
01:33:28,674 --> 01:33:31,009
Sofya?

1177
01:33:31,177 --> 01:33:32,970
Sofya?

1178
01:33:32,971 --> 01:33:35,263
What is it?

1179
01:33:35,598 --> 01:33:37,393
What is it?

1180
01:33:42,313 --> 01:33:45,274
She's come, hasn't she?

1181
01:33:45,775 --> 01:33:49,028
She's here.
You're imagining things.

1182
01:33:49,029 --> 01:33:50,737
Sasha!

1183
01:33:51,947 --> 01:33:54,201
Where is your mother?

1184
01:33:54,868 --> 01:33:57,286
She's at home.

1185
01:33:59,289 --> 01:34:02,833
If she wants to see me,
I can't refuse her.

1186
01:34:02,835 --> 01:34:04,960
Yes.

1187
01:34:05,337 --> 01:34:08,004
Is she going to come here?

1188
01:34:08,505 --> 01:34:10,634
I don't...

1189
01:34:10,926 --> 01:34:13,177
There's no way to...

1190
01:34:14,262 --> 01:34:17,306
There's no way to what?

1191
01:34:38,453 --> 01:34:41,121
I'd like to send
another telegram, please.

1192
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:44,542
At Astapovo. Stop.

1193
01:34:45,877 --> 01:34:48,503
Tolstoy ill. Stop.

1194
01:34:48,504 --> 01:34:51,298
Heartbreaking. Stop.
Please come.

1195
01:34:53,344 --> 01:34:55,804
You can send it to Masha...

1196
01:34:56,137 --> 01:34:58,347
Maria Filipovna Melinova.

1197
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:04,520
You lied to him.

1198
01:35:04,521 --> 01:35:06,145
Keep your voice down.

1199
01:35:06,146 --> 01:35:08,567
He wants to see her.
You heard him say it.

1200
01:35:08,942 --> 01:35:11,235
And what exactly do you
think she'll bring him here?

1201
01:35:11,237 --> 01:35:13,737
I don't know. They've been
married for 48 years.

1202
01:35:13,737 --> 01:35:16,574
I'll tell you exactly what she'll bring.
Vanity, fuss and noise.

1203
01:35:16,576 --> 01:35:17,992
She promised me
she would not...

1204
01:35:17,993 --> 01:35:20,077
Promised you what?
What, what?

1205
01:35:20,078 --> 01:35:22,162
You've seen her at
close quarters, my boy.

1206
01:35:22,163 --> 01:35:25,666
Do you really think that she's
capable of restraining herself
from acting like a madwoman?

1207
01:35:25,667 --> 01:35:27,918
They have a whole life together.
Why do you have to deny that?

1208
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:30,922
You have become a victim
of her romantic nonsense.

1209
01:35:31,298 --> 01:35:34,842
And you willfully forget that she wants
to destroy everything we do.

1210
01:35:34,844 --> 01:35:37,094
She travels here with that
unctuous little priest.

1211
01:35:37,094 --> 01:35:40,722
We'll keep the priest away.
These people are vultures, Valentin.

1212
01:35:40,723 --> 01:35:43,350
And they wait to descend
till the very last moment

1213
01:35:43,351 --> 01:35:45,310
to welcome him back
to the Church.

1214
01:35:45,311 --> 01:35:47,645
This is their fantasy.
Keep the priest away.

1215
01:35:47,646 --> 01:35:49,189
A deathbed recantation.

1216
01:35:49,190 --> 01:35:53,819
Do you have any idea
the damage that that will do?

1217
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,738
Everything that he has
dreamed of,

1218
01:35:55,739 --> 01:36:01,869
everything that we have
worked for will be gone.

1219
01:36:01,911 --> 01:36:05,247
A simple, noble death

1220
01:36:05,248 --> 01:36:07,875
is what we want.

1221
01:36:08,125 --> 01:36:10,795
That's what he wants.

1222
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:16,134
No, you want
to create an icon.

1223
01:36:16,219 --> 01:36:19,677
And you want people
to kneel in front of an
image that you create.

1224
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:21,305
But he doesn't want that.

1225
01:36:21,306 --> 01:36:25,183
He never has wanted that.
It'll give him no peace.

1226
01:36:26,645 --> 01:36:30,063
He wants to see her.
Let her come.

1227
01:36:31,692 --> 01:36:35,612
I will do everything in
my power to prevent that.

1228
01:36:37,905 --> 01:36:40,074
That image
you want to create,

1229
01:36:41,536 --> 01:36:44,411
it's going to look
more like you than him.

1230
01:37:47,808 --> 01:37:49,936
Valentin?

1231
01:38:06,911 --> 01:38:09,495
It can't be right.
His fever is down.

1232
01:38:09,496 --> 01:38:11,164
Yes.

1233
01:38:11,165 --> 01:38:13,000
But, uh...

1234
01:38:13,125 --> 01:38:17,504
his pulse,
you see, it's...

1235
01:38:24,762 --> 01:38:26,931
My dear.

1236
01:38:31,186 --> 01:38:33,770
Shall I call her?

1237
01:38:33,771 --> 01:38:36,524
He wouldn't know
who she is anyway.

1238
01:38:36,525 --> 01:38:38,359
Yes.

1239
01:39:02,842 --> 01:39:05,594
Bring a coat. It's cold.

1240
01:39:14,478 --> 01:39:18,399
Countess. Countess, could you
give me some information?

1241
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,817
Countess, is he dying?

1242
01:39:20,987 --> 01:39:22,904
Is he dead?

1243
01:39:33,748 --> 01:39:38,002
Leovochka!
Leovochka, my darling.

1244
01:39:38,003 --> 01:39:40,754
Oh, my darling,
please forgive me, please!

1245
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:45,885
I'm a fool. I'm a selfish woman,
but I love you, darling.

1246
01:39:45,886 --> 01:39:48,386
Please believe me.

1247
01:39:48,387 --> 01:39:52,016
Please, please understand me,

1248
01:39:52,018 --> 01:39:55,019
and please forgive my
wickedness and my badness.

1249
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:57,312
Mother.

1250
01:39:57,688 --> 01:39:59,856
Control yourself.

1251
01:39:59,857 --> 01:40:03,737
Am I shouting?
You have to control yourself.

1252
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:08,073
Yes.

1253
01:40:08,074 --> 01:40:10,536
Yes, I will.

1254
01:40:25,967 --> 01:40:30,387
You don't speak, but I hear you.

1255
01:40:31,388 --> 01:40:34,518
Do you love me, Leovochka?

1256
01:40:39,813 --> 01:40:43,192
I never stopped,
my little bird.

1257
01:40:46,154 --> 01:40:48,990
And you will never stop?

1258
01:40:50,451 --> 01:40:52,284
No.

1259
01:40:52,286 --> 01:40:54,328
Never.

1260
01:40:56,748 --> 01:40:59,292
Nor ever leave me again?

1261
01:41:01,835 --> 01:41:06,214
No, never again.

1262
01:41:06,591 --> 01:41:08,551
Good.

1263
01:41:08,802 --> 01:41:10,762
Good.

1264
01:41:12,097 --> 01:41:13,597
Let's go home.

1265
01:41:49,092 --> 01:41:51,552
First cessation.

1266
01:42:03,315 --> 01:42:05,982
Second cessation.

1267
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:27,338
Shh. Shh.

1268
01:42:55,451 --> 01:43:00,329
Ten minutes after 6
in the morning,

1269
01:43:01,664 --> 01:43:04,750
a great soul passed
from our world.

1270
01:43:06,170 --> 01:43:09,880
Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy...

1271
01:44:06,228 --> 01:44:08,313
Masha.

1272
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:19,283
Masha. Oh, Masha.

1273
01:44:20,911 --> 01:44:24,204
I'm sorry, but he is gone.
I know.

1274
01:44:27,417 --> 01:44:30,460
But I came for you, Valya.

1275
01:44:31,545 --> 01:44:33,463
I came for you too.

1276
01:45:22,931 --> 01:45:25,599
God go with you,
Sofya Andreyevna.

1277
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:28,061
God bless you!

1278
01:45:29,896 --> 01:45:33,067
We'll pray for you, countess!
