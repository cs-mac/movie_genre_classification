What?

8
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:53,844

What did you steal?

11
00:02:57,604 --> 00:02:59,124
Hand it over immediately!

12
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:00,484
Immediately!

13
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:08,364
Follow him!

14
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:15,244
What?

15
00:03:20,794 --> 00:03:21,764
Darn it!

16
00:03:21,764 --> 00:03:23,804
Darn it!

17
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:26,804
How could this be?

18
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:32,964
Did you lose him?

19
00:03:34,374 --> 00:03:38,344
Did you lose all of them?

20
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:40,764
I'm sorry.

21
00:03:51,884 --> 00:03:53,664
Did they steal

22
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:56,744
the bronze mirror pieces?

23
00:03:58,524 --> 00:04:00,604
Did you already know

24
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:03,694
about the bronze mirror pieces?

25
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:14,284
Please tell me all about them.

26
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,644
Aren't I on your side already?

27
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:25,644
Yes.

28
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:35,024
Yes, I'll tell you everything.

29
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:38,104
The bronze mirror pieces

30
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:42,624
is a pact between me

31
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:46,844
and five other noblemen.

32
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:50,484
Our pact is, <i>'sal jae su ho guk,'

33
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:55,214
meaning, “the noblemen
will kill the King and rule the nation.”

34
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:57,404
These five words are engraved on there,

35
00:04:58,204 --> 00:05:00,184
along with our names.

36
00:05:02,724 --> 00:05:05,044
We put our lives on the line

37
00:05:08,004 --> 00:05:12,434
for the pact.

38
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:22,774
Five years ago on that night,

39
00:05:23,244 --> 00:05:25,274
were you in Father's room, too?

40
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:32,684
Can I tolerate all of this

41
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:37,754
and rise to the throne?

42
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:42,944
Nonetheless,

43
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:47,744
I'll still go with you.

44
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:50,864
What can you give me?

45
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:52,904
What do you want?

46
00:05:54,044 --> 00:05:55,384
Become completely

47
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:00,544
loyal to me.

48
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:15,624
How could you become
Wang Sik Ryeom's sword,

49
00:06:16,404 --> 00:06:18,024
the man who killed my father?

50
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:22,504
How could you?

[Episode 18]

53
00:06:32,904 --> 00:06:36,064
I heard the virtuous men
infiltrated here last night!

54
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:38,024
What's happening?

55
00:06:38,824 --> 00:06:40,884
What did they steal?

56
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:43,704
Could it be?

57
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:49,724
They stole our bronze mirror pieces.

58
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:51,744
Then

59
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:54,664
doesn't this mean
they have all 5 pieces?

60
00:06:54,944 --> 00:06:56,424
What do we do now?

61
00:06:57,444 --> 00:06:59,044
The bronze mirror pieces have

62
00:06:59,644 --> 00:07:02,474
our pact engraved on it.

63
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:05,904
As I've told you before,

64
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:10,174
they won't be able to
figure it out that easily.

65
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:12,484
What if they do?

66
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:17,864
Right now, there's
an order to arrest them.

67
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:20,154
They won't be able to reveal

68
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:23,624
the bronze mirror pieces that easily.

69
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:28,734
They'll have to admit
that they're thieves

70
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:31,224
who killed Kim Jong Sik and Hong Gui Ui,

71
00:07:31,224 --> 00:07:33,934
and broke into my house
before doing that.

72
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:42,104
I'll find ways to counterattack them.

73
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,384
Trust me.

74
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:48,514
Trust me.

75
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:21,184
I'll contribute

76
00:08:21,944 --> 00:08:23,484
to the war with Wang Sik Ryeom.

77
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:28,284
Thank you for your sincerity.

78
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:30,744
I'm planning on releasing Cheong Ok

79
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,294
and her younger sister.

80
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:36,794
Cheong Ok will be our
emergency messenger.

81
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,504
And we must find out
the noblemen's plans,

82
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:44,374
so it's better for Cheong Ok
to stay at Wolhyanglu.

83
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:46,844
Okay.

84
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:51,844
Have you seen the bronze mirrors?

85
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,414
You'll have to see them with me.

86
00:09:07,104 --> 00:09:11,334
These people are
Goryeo's rotten roots.

87
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:16,504
But their names alone
aren't enough as evidence.

88
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:18,784
There's a pact to kill the First King

89
00:09:18,784 --> 00:09:21,464
on this bronze mirror.

90
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:24,604
That's why Wang Sik Ryeom
was obsessed with it.

91
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:27,304
After we find it,

92
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:29,444
the problem is the antidote.

93
00:09:30,124 --> 00:09:34,314
The next great meeting
must be held by the King.

94
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:38,484
Will it be possible
to make the antidote?

95
00:10:18,444 --> 00:10:21,294
No middlemen will give
us advance payments.

96
00:10:22,984 --> 00:10:25,664
Pungwoo Trading Company is too powerful.

97
00:10:27,664 --> 00:10:28,664
Yool.

98
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:34,104
Has anyone agreed to
a credit transaction?

99
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:37,164
Us neither.

100
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:38,444
Nothing is working out.

101
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:39,804
Right.

102
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:42,104
Did you hear the news, Miss?

103
00:10:42,364 --> 00:10:45,624
Last night, the virtuous men infiltrated
Wang Sik Ryeom's house.

104
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:49,024
What are you talking about?

105
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,964
They mobilized the palatial soldiers
and they pursued them.

106
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:54,894
So were they captured or hurt?

107
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:55,864
No.

108
00:10:56,144 --> 00:10:57,594
They said they ran away safely.

109
00:11:00,844 --> 00:11:02,204
Is anyone here?

110
00:11:04,604 --> 00:11:05,884
Why is that guy here?

111
00:11:05,884 --> 00:11:07,284
And who's that person beside him?

112
00:11:12,424 --> 00:11:14,684
- What brings you here?
- Yes, Shin Yool.

113
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:17,404
Mr. Yang is here too, I see.

114
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:19,864
Say hello.

115
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:23,704
He runs everything at
Pungwoo Trading Co.

116
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:24,664
Never mind.

117
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:26,324
What brings you here?

118
00:11:26,324 --> 00:11:28,164
- You're done with us.
- What do you mean?

119
00:11:28,844 --> 00:11:32,224
All of your wealth was given
to Pungwoo Trading Co.

120
00:11:32,644 --> 00:11:34,564
but why are you still here?

121
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:38,404
You want us to hand over our homes?

122
00:11:38,404 --> 00:11:41,344
You need to move out,
so that we can move in.

123
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:44,814
That's ridiculous!

124
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:46,324
Give us some time.

125
00:11:46,684 --> 00:11:48,764
Then we'll pay for our land here.

126
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:50,664
You have 15 days.

127
00:11:50,664 --> 00:11:52,624
If you don't pay within 15 days,

128
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:54,784
you'll have to leave.

129
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:56,284
Look here!

130
00:11:56,284 --> 00:11:58,684
- How could we do that in 15 days?
- If we pay,

131
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:01,964
then this land
and the house is ours.

132
00:12:01,964 --> 00:12:03,394
You've promised.

133
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:05,464
How can we get the money in 15 days?

134
00:12:06,384 --> 00:12:08,564
Now we're really going down!

135
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:10,984
Miss.

136
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:13,374
Is there a way for our
company to survive?

137
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:17,504
It's not impossible.

138
00:12:21,064 --> 00:12:22,314
What is it?

139
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:25,854
We need to get the spices
that are being delivered on the ship.

140
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:29,624
The spices do yield a lot of money.

141
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:33,084
The prices of spices have skyrocketed
in the central districts.

142
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:35,464
It's probably risen more than 10 fold.

143
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:38,764
With that money, we
can pay for our house,

144
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:40,894
and we'll have seed money as well.

145
00:12:41,224 --> 00:12:44,634
But you said we need
30,000 ginseng roots.

146
00:12:44,984 --> 00:12:49,064
There is one person in the capital

147
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:51,944
who has 30,000 ginseng roots.

148
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:54,924
Who is it?

149
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:57,264
It's Princess Yeo Won.

150
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,184
Miss.

151
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:03,124
So you're going to meet her right now?

152
00:13:03,704 --> 00:13:05,984
She's Prince Wang So's wife!

153
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:07,784
Do you think she'll help us?

154
00:13:07,784 --> 00:13:10,084
We'll be lucky if she
doesn't treat us badly!

155
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:11,064
I'm against it, too.

156
00:13:11,064 --> 00:13:12,364
It won't work anyway.

157
00:13:12,364 --> 00:13:15,924
I hate all of the Hwang family!

158
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:21,784
Gaebong!

159
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:27,844
Don't worry, you fool!

160
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:30,984
Everything will be returned.

161
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:33,764
The world's most interesting goods

162
00:14:33,764 --> 00:14:37,644
will be stocked in
the magical storage room,

163
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:39,024
and at this inn,

164
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:42,944
Goryeo's, I mean,
all the world's men

165
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:47,544
will come here and make a ruckus.

166
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:50,044
Chunghae Trading Co.
is no ordinary company.

167
00:14:50,044 --> 00:14:51,744
Don't worry.

168
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:56,404
What are you doing?

169
00:14:56,404 --> 00:14:58,364
- Are you okay?
- What are you talking about?

170
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,784
Didn't you get hurt

171
00:14:59,784 --> 00:15:01,684
when the soldiers chased after you?

172
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:05,504
My shoulder, my back!

173
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:07,604
Even my legs!

174
00:15:11,904 --> 00:15:13,444
Does it hurt a lot?

175
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:15,284
Of course it does!

176
00:15:15,284 --> 00:15:17,654
- Not there, but a little lower.
- Here?

177
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:20,424
Or…

178
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:22,724
Or here?

179
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:26,224
You keep touching where
it hurts, go left.

180
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:27,404
Go right!

181
00:15:27,904 --> 00:15:29,384
Yeah, a little lower.

182
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:31,194
Go a little lower.

183
00:15:33,004 --> 00:15:34,384
Why did you hit me?

184
00:15:34,804 --> 00:15:36,844
I don't think you got hurt.

185
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:38,574
What do you mean?

186
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:41,364
I wasn't hurt at all.

187
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:46,744
- *<i>Hyungnim!
- Why are you so gullible?

188
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:46,744
[Hyungnim: formal version
of older brother or male.]

189
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:48,744
I'm only gullible with you.

190
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:51,204
Is that so?

191
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:53,484
Gaebong.

192
00:15:54,824 --> 00:15:58,304
What are you thinking about?

193
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:00,594
What are you imagining about?

194
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:03,064
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

195
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:10,464
Gaebong.

196
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:12,804
Everything is almost done.

197
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:15,384
Just hold on a little longer.

198
00:16:16,124 --> 00:16:20,404
I'll return everything
to where it once was.

199
00:16:20,874 --> 00:16:22,814
Don't you trust me?

200
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,624
I do.

201
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:29,784
- It just feels weird.
- What does?

202
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:34,704
It's the first time
someone's said to me,

203
00:16:35,524 --> 00:16:37,204
“Don't worry,” “Trust me.”

204
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:41,064
and “I'll take care of it.”

205
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:44,364
I always used to say that.

206
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,824
Weren't the weight of those words

207
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:49,004
quite heavy?

208
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:51,964
They were heavy at times,

209
00:16:52,624 --> 00:16:54,984
But thinking that
I could protect my people

210
00:16:54,984 --> 00:16:57,644
on my own,

211
00:16:58,144 --> 00:16:59,784
I was happy.

212
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:04,264
So whenever there was a problem,

213
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:05,964
I found a solution.

214
00:17:08,954 --> 00:17:10,404
But this time,

215
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:12,524
I just can't find a way.

216
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:14,104
No.

217
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:16,804
I know there is a way,

218
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:21,984
but I can't decide

219
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:25,444
if I should keep going or give up.

220
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:31,064
That's why you can't
scratch your own back.

221
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:33,584
What?

222
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:35,854
Didn't you say that to me before?

223
00:17:36,204 --> 00:17:37,984
When you have a lot on your mind,

224
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:40,624
it's best to simply make calculations.

225
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:42,424
Make calculations?

226
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:43,924
What do you mean?

227
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:46,104
Compare the pros and the cons,

228
00:17:46,624 --> 00:17:48,364
and choose the pros.

229
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:52,424
You already know the answer,

230
00:17:52,424 --> 00:17:55,064
you don't need to complicate things.

231
00:17:56,364 --> 00:17:59,744
Seeing your expression,
it seems you've found the solution.

232
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:02,524
Now that I'm thinking about the pros,

233
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:04,364
I think I can see a way.

234
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:09,144
But what if I can't
compare the pros and cons?

235
00:18:09,484 --> 00:18:11,904
Aren't you a trader, Gaebong?

236
00:18:12,654 --> 00:18:15,744
Then there should be
a standard for traders.

237
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:18,164
You just need to follow that.

238
00:18:19,024 --> 00:18:21,524
Do you really think so?

239
00:18:21,844 --> 00:18:23,734
Of course, I think so.

240
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:27,234
Thank you for understanding.

241
00:18:27,624 --> 00:18:29,164
You brat.

242
00:18:30,464 --> 00:18:33,004
Then you may leave now.

243
00:18:33,844 --> 00:18:34,944
You want me to leave?

244
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:36,644
I can't walk you out.

245
00:18:36,644 --> 00:18:38,074
I have work to do.

246
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,004
Wait.

247
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,044
Hey, Gaebong!

248
00:18:42,044 --> 00:18:43,364
Gaebong!

249
00:18:44,854 --> 00:18:46,984
That brat.

250
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:52,544
Thank you

251
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:56,684
for always being by my side.

252
00:18:57,924 --> 00:18:59,204
Thank you.

253
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:06,784
Oh man, we were alone in this room.

254
00:19:24,224 --> 00:19:26,464
- Father!
- My son!

255
00:19:27,924 --> 00:19:29,344
Okay, okay.

256
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:31,484
Welcome back.

257
00:19:32,224 --> 00:19:34,104
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

258
00:19:34,104 --> 00:19:35,644
I've been well, Father.

259
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:42,344
Tomorrow, I'll give
a requisition order at the meeting.

260
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:46,204
We must admit all men
to compulsory service,

261
00:19:46,564 --> 00:19:49,624
so that we won't run into a problem
with the move to the west.

262
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:50,644
Yes.

263
00:19:51,004 --> 00:19:53,504
I know very well what I must do, Father.

264
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:56,154
I'm so proud of you.

265
00:19:57,804 --> 00:19:59,024
Yes.

266
00:20:00,384 --> 00:20:05,624
You must be tired from
your long journey here, General Gwak.

267
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:12,044
Here, here.

268
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,284
Sit down.

269
00:20:16,764 --> 00:20:18,944
How long has it been?

270
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:21,644
It's the first time
we've seen one another

271
00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:24,484
since we defeated the Khitans.

272
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:32,454
I'm still alive because
you fought with us.

273
00:20:34,184 --> 00:20:36,324
You don't need to thank me.

274
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:42,544
Goryeo needed to defeat the Khitans too.

275
00:20:45,064 --> 00:20:46,664
But

276
00:20:47,884 --> 00:20:49,904
you speak the language of Goryeo.

277
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:55,244
Thanks to one Goryeo man,

278
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:58,844
I became furious and
learned the language.

279
00:20:59,844 --> 00:21:02,604
That man must have some guts

280
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:05,264
to make the great General Gwak furious.

281
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,644
Should we catch and put
him to death for you?

282
00:21:10,324 --> 00:21:14,094
So, what is your request?

283
00:21:14,094 --> 00:21:15,164
Father.

284
00:21:16,624 --> 00:21:19,944
General Gwak is going to
attack his surroundings

285
00:21:20,264 --> 00:21:22,524
so he can establish a nation
in the central districts.

286
00:21:22,524 --> 00:21:25,044
He's planning a blitz attack,

287
00:21:25,624 --> 00:21:27,904
so he needs you to provide the soldiers.

288
00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:31,944
So please let me meet the King.

289
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:34,384
I will persuade him.

290
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:36,784
Well

291
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:41,404
you don't need to meet the King.

292
00:21:42,224 --> 00:21:46,084
He's not in stable
mental health right now.

293
00:21:47,124 --> 00:21:49,824
He can't make any judgments.

294
00:21:56,844 --> 00:22:00,104
The one you must meet isn't the King,

295
00:22:00,664 --> 00:22:03,884
but it's Prince Wang Wook.

296
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:06,604
He's the next in line,

297
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:13,014
and the noblemen and I support him.

298
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:15,204
Is that so?

299
00:22:21,244 --> 00:22:25,084
He'll be the new King
of the central districts.

300
00:22:26,204 --> 00:22:28,884
Make him one of your men.

301
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:52,484
Do you know Chunghae Trading Co.?

302
00:22:55,524 --> 00:22:58,394
You're asking for Chunghae
Trading Co. again?

303
00:22:58,584 --> 00:22:59,564
Father.

304
00:23:00,604 --> 00:23:02,804
It was a trading company in Gaebong,

305
00:23:03,484 --> 00:23:06,974
but 5 years ago, the assistant
head of the company

306
00:23:06,974 --> 00:23:08,964
and General Gwak were arranged to wed.

307
00:23:09,904 --> 00:23:14,124
But the assistant head
married a Goryeo man,

308
00:23:14,674 --> 00:23:16,974
and she went to Goryeo with him.

309
00:23:21,104 --> 00:23:22,324
Your Highness.

310
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:26,424
She's already married.

311
00:23:27,024 --> 00:23:30,394
And 5 years ago, too.

312
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:36,004
Isn't she absurd?

313
00:23:36,534 --> 00:23:41,644
How could brothers
fight over one woman?

314
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:49,584
That assistant head was
a magnificent woman.

315
00:23:52,204 --> 00:23:56,144
I heard she established
a company in Goryeo.

316
00:23:57,284 --> 00:23:59,124
Have you heard of it?

317
00:24:00,804 --> 00:24:02,724
Of course I have.

318
00:24:04,004 --> 00:24:08,064
Prince Wang Wook knows about it well.

319
00:24:09,004 --> 00:24:10,564
You can ask him about the details.

320
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:23,224
Is the assistant head still doing well

321
00:24:23,784 --> 00:24:25,444
with that Goryeo man?

322
00:24:29,604 --> 00:24:33,454
We shall talk about this again later.

323
00:24:51,104 --> 00:24:53,534
Could I disturb you for one moment?

324
00:24:57,044 --> 00:24:59,144
After what Wang Sik Ryeom said,

325
00:24:59,144 --> 00:25:02,184
you must be close with
the assistant head?

326
00:25:02,924 --> 00:25:07,284
Have you seen her Goryeo husband?

327
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:10,404
He was ragged looking,

328
00:25:10,964 --> 00:25:13,224
but the look in his eyes and his spirit

329
00:25:13,224 --> 00:25:15,344
was like that of a tiger.

330
00:25:16,104 --> 00:25:18,694
I was disappointed to have lost her,

331
00:25:19,824 --> 00:25:25,704
but I understand why she chose that man.

332
00:25:27,084 --> 00:25:29,004
Wang Sik Ryeom mentioned

333
00:25:29,004 --> 00:25:33,014
that brothers fought over one woman.

334
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,104
What does that mean?

335
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:58,004
Sit down.

336
00:25:58,384 --> 00:26:02,324
Chunghae Trading Co. is not involved
in the move to the west anymore.

337
00:26:02,724 --> 00:26:04,004
What brings you here?

338
00:26:04,324 --> 00:26:06,484
I have something to ask you.

339
00:26:07,184 --> 00:26:08,244
Sit down.

340
00:26:13,724 --> 00:26:14,914
Please go ahead.

341
00:26:16,244 --> 00:26:17,224
Have you

342
00:26:19,004 --> 00:26:23,244
ever been married?

343
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,444
What are you talking about?

344
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:32,504
Why do you talk of
a marriage, all of a sudden?

345
00:26:32,504 --> 00:26:34,064
<i>If she was married,

346
00:26:34,764 --> 00:26:36,674
<i>she wouldn't not talk about it.

347
00:26:37,324 --> 00:26:38,724
<i>There has to be a reason

348
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:40,424
<i>she can't talk about her marriage.

349
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:44,104
<i>It's because the identity
of that Goryeo man

350
00:26:44,684 --> 00:26:46,844
<i>can't be revealed.

351
00:26:49,104 --> 00:26:50,084
<i>Could it be?

352
00:26:57,304 --> 00:26:58,544
I understand.

353
00:27:00,004 --> 00:27:03,604
We've talked about marriage before.

354
00:27:05,604 --> 00:27:07,284
I've asked an unnecessary question.

355
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:10,324
I'll be leaving.

356
00:28:41,224 --> 00:28:42,924
It was a difference in temperature.

357
00:28:43,844 --> 00:28:45,104
A difference in temperature.

358
00:29:43,544 --> 00:29:45,444
I've found evidence.

359
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:47,904
I'll reveal it at the great meeting

360
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,664
and let the world know!

361
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:52,984
Wang Sik Ryeom is leading the meeting.

362
00:29:52,984 --> 00:29:54,194
Subtitles Ripped By www.vikisubtitle.com
Will it be okay?

363
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:58,934
No, we must make
the King lead the meeting.

364
00:29:59,224 --> 00:30:01,524
That way the bronze mirror
will be recognized

365
00:30:01,524 --> 00:30:03,044
as evidence.

366
00:30:03,684 --> 00:30:06,204
If Wang Sik Ryeom leads the meeting,

367
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:08,074
he might try to find
faults in the evidence.

368
00:30:08,964 --> 00:30:10,684
Thus the most important thing is

369
00:30:11,164 --> 00:30:12,964
to find the antidote.

370
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:17,214
The antidote that Wang Wook has.

371
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,124
Five years ago,

372
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:34,504
was that the man

373
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:38,184
who wed the assistant head?

374
00:30:42,404 --> 00:30:44,104
Yes, that's right.

375
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:47,014
But considering his appearance,

376
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:48,944
he must be of the royal family.

377
00:30:49,824 --> 00:30:52,084
Brothers, I see.

378
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:56,744
I have a favor to ask of you.

379
00:31:03,204 --> 00:31:05,104
Please don't reveal to anyone

380
00:31:08,804 --> 00:31:10,904
about this marriage.

381
00:31:12,444 --> 00:31:14,864
That means erasing all memories

382
00:31:16,864 --> 00:31:20,644
related to the assistant head.

383
00:31:22,744 --> 00:31:23,964
Then

384
00:31:28,604 --> 00:31:30,284
when I become King,

385
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,994
I'll repay you.

386
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:43,344
I'm very greedy.

387
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:44,984
I'll give you

388
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,044
anything you want.

389
00:32:02,144 --> 00:32:03,444
It's you.

390
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:09,104
Here.

391
00:32:22,564 --> 00:32:25,404
Soon the great meeting will take place.

392
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:27,044
So?

393
00:32:27,044 --> 00:32:28,884
I have all of the evidence

394
00:32:28,884 --> 00:32:31,604
to punish Wang Sik Ryeom.

395
00:32:33,144 --> 00:32:35,454
I'll reveal it during
the great meeting,

396
00:32:35,844 --> 00:32:38,024
and then the whole world know.

397
00:32:38,544 --> 00:32:41,394
Then I'll remove him from his position

398
00:32:41,964 --> 00:32:43,564
and punish him.

399
00:32:45,324 --> 00:32:46,684
In order to do that,

400
00:32:47,704 --> 00:32:52,004
the King must lead the great meeting.

401
00:32:53,164 --> 00:32:58,504
Wook, try to change the fate of Goryeo

402
00:32:59,304 --> 00:33:01,664
with me, your own brother.

403
00:33:02,844 --> 00:33:04,684
Please give me the antidote.

404
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:09,324
<i>If the marriage is found out,

405
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:11,964
<i>Shin Yool will die.

406
00:33:12,684 --> 00:33:14,504
<i>How will you protect her?

407
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:17,244
<i>How will you save her?

408
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:25,504
Wook.

409
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,104
It's the last chance.

410
00:33:29,484 --> 00:33:31,504
It's the last chance to stop the war

411
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:34,864
between the royal family,

412
00:33:34,864 --> 00:33:38,404
so that everyone can live humanely!

413
00:33:41,464 --> 00:33:43,504
It's the last chance.

414
00:33:56,644 --> 00:33:58,744
Please take my hand.

415
00:34:01,044 --> 00:34:05,124
<i>The antidote is the last opportunity

416
00:34:05,764 --> 00:34:07,644
<i>to save Shin Yool.

417
00:34:10,464 --> 00:34:15,004
The hand I should take isn't yours.

418
00:34:55,654 --> 00:34:57,684
You must show your respect

419
00:34:58,704 --> 00:35:00,684
to Prince Wang Wook

420
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,864
when you're in front of other people.

421
00:35:04,884 --> 00:35:08,344
He's the one who'll be King.

422
00:35:09,164 --> 00:35:11,604
Don't trust Wook that much.

423
00:35:11,604 --> 00:35:12,904
The way I see it,

424
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:15,964
I don't think he'll
stay loyal to you.

425
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:19,664
Poong.

426
00:35:20,464 --> 00:35:22,664
Loyalty, you see,

427
00:35:23,304 --> 00:35:28,324
depends on what I have
against the opponent.

428
00:35:30,104 --> 00:35:31,544
Wook has no choice

429
00:35:32,604 --> 00:35:37,364
to be loyal to me

430
00:35:38,364 --> 00:35:41,844
until the assistant head is dead.

431
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:46,924
Wook has been bewitched by that woman?

432
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:50,374
What kind of woman is she?

433
00:35:50,374 --> 00:35:52,784
She's an impudent woman.

434
00:35:54,104 --> 00:35:56,024
Don't keep her close to you.

435
00:35:56,624 --> 00:35:59,614
That makes her more interesting.

436
00:35:59,614 --> 00:36:00,944
Don't you dare!

437
00:36:04,004 --> 00:36:07,554
The problem right now isn't Wook,

438
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:09,124
but So.

439
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:14,804
He meddles in everything I do,

440
00:36:14,804 --> 00:36:17,464
and now he's trying to take my life?

441
00:36:17,464 --> 00:36:20,184
So why did you stand idle?

442
00:36:20,734 --> 00:36:22,024
You must kill him.

443
00:36:22,844 --> 00:36:24,804
The best defense is to attack.

444
00:36:24,804 --> 00:36:26,544
That attack needs a deadly weapon

445
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:31,544
that will destroy the enemy instantly

446
00:36:31,544 --> 00:36:36,144
in order to gain victory.

447
00:36:40,384 --> 00:36:41,864
I'm looking for it.

448
00:36:42,584 --> 00:36:46,984
I'm looking for a deadly weapon

449
00:36:46,984 --> 00:36:49,224
to destroy Wang So!

450
00:36:51,624 --> 00:36:53,044
Why are you alone?

451
00:36:53,804 --> 00:36:56,304
I had to go somewhere.

452
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,444
- Was it Chunghae Trading Co.?
- Yes.

453
00:37:00,984 --> 00:37:01,844
Yes.

454
00:37:02,124 --> 00:37:04,474
Did you meet that woman?

455
00:37:05,564 --> 00:37:09,114
What did she say when she saw you?

456
00:37:14,464 --> 00:37:15,584
Now.

457
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:21,594
Let's talk about our
offers to one another.

458
00:37:22,184 --> 00:37:23,034
Sure.

459
00:37:25,184 --> 00:37:26,644
Leave us now.

460
00:37:42,484 --> 00:37:47,064
What can you offer me?

461
00:37:48,664 --> 00:37:50,204
Before that,

462
00:37:51,484 --> 00:37:53,424
I have something to ask you.

463
00:37:54,704 --> 00:37:56,004
Before,

464
00:37:56,004 --> 00:38:01,124
you said that two brothers
fought over one woman.

465
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:06,644
Is one of those brothers
Prince Wang Wook

466
00:38:07,624 --> 00:38:09,184
and the other…?

467
00:38:21,044 --> 00:38:22,344
It's So.

468
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:24,924
It's a man named Wang So.

469
00:38:28,104 --> 00:38:29,284
Wang So.

470
00:38:33,464 --> 00:38:38,904
It a letter saying that
the King hasn't improved.

471
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,944
The great meeting is
right around the corner.

472
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:46,214
Is there really no other way?

473
00:38:49,724 --> 00:38:51,544
Princess Yeo Won.

474
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,504
She's given me her sincerity.

475
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,754
I've given her my sincerity as well.

476
00:39:00,224 --> 00:39:02,724
If we still can't save him,

477
00:39:04,024 --> 00:39:06,964
then I must take action myself.

478
00:39:06,964 --> 00:39:08,184
You can't.

479
00:39:09,524 --> 00:39:12,124
The evidence we've
gathered for 5 years

480
00:39:12,124 --> 00:39:13,764
could all go to waste.

481
00:39:15,344 --> 00:39:17,244
Don't worry, Eun Chun.

482
00:39:19,244 --> 00:39:21,804
I will win, no matter what.

483
00:40:28,964 --> 00:40:30,244
This won't do.

484
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:33,704
I can't provide soldiers for you

485
00:40:33,704 --> 00:40:36,084
with that offer.

486
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,254
Come on.

487
00:40:38,884 --> 00:40:40,064
Wait.

488
00:40:42,804 --> 00:40:45,304
If I tell you an interesting story,

489
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,494
will you fulfill my request?

490
00:40:58,744 --> 00:40:59,964
Don't forget

491
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:02,444
the promise you made with me.

492
00:41:02,884 --> 00:41:08,024
I don't forget promises,
Your Highness.

493
00:41:31,584 --> 00:41:34,484
This man, this man!

494
00:41:47,684 --> 00:41:49,424
I heard you were looking for me.

495
00:41:51,304 --> 00:41:52,304
Yes.

496
00:41:52,984 --> 00:41:54,484
You're just as I've heard.

497
00:41:56,004 --> 00:41:58,444
Brothers would fight over you.

498
00:41:59,544 --> 00:42:00,504
Yes.

499
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:04,404
Try to seduce me with your skills.

500
00:42:04,944 --> 00:42:06,534
What are you doing?

501
00:42:06,534 --> 00:42:07,934
What do you mean?

502
00:42:07,934 --> 00:42:09,204
I just want to play with you.

503
00:42:11,574 --> 00:42:12,574
What are you?

504
00:42:15,474 --> 00:42:16,384
Ouch!

505
00:42:16,384 --> 00:42:18,384
Let me go.

506
00:42:19,754 --> 00:42:22,284
Hey, let me go.

507
00:42:22,704 --> 00:42:24,424
Do you know who I am?

508
00:42:24,424 --> 00:42:26,424
I'm Wang Sik Ryeom's son, let me go!

509
00:42:29,944 --> 00:42:31,184
Gyeong!

510
00:42:31,484 --> 00:42:32,564
Come here!

511
00:42:39,964 --> 00:42:43,404
Did you just hit me, Prince Wang So?

512
00:42:51,624 --> 00:42:54,524
Next time, that'll be in your body.

513
00:42:55,664 --> 00:42:59,084
Poong, leave now.

514
00:43:28,744 --> 00:43:31,354
You could've just used your words.

515
00:43:32,864 --> 00:43:34,844
You have to treat people
like him like that,

516
00:43:34,844 --> 00:43:36,594
so that they won't
come back again.

517
00:43:38,264 --> 00:43:40,564
You must be in control of your temper.

518
00:43:40,924 --> 00:43:44,664
You said that I have fire above my head.

519
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:47,764
It's not like I have a fire for a hat.

520
00:43:55,264 --> 00:43:59,084
Is the King doing well?

521
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:16,784
I feel so tired, all of a sudden.

522
00:44:21,204 --> 00:44:22,204
Oh, boy.

523
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:27,964
Oh, boy, I feel so
tired, all of a sudden.

524
00:45:03,604 --> 00:45:05,304
Don't worry.

525
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,184
I'm trying.

526
00:45:12,024 --> 00:45:13,414
Do you need anything?

527
00:45:14,104 --> 00:45:14,984
You.

528
00:45:16,304 --> 00:45:19,594
You just need to be by my side.

529
00:45:20,944 --> 00:45:24,844
You're my greatest source of energy.

530
00:45:35,664 --> 00:45:36,944
Gaebong.

531
00:45:38,484 --> 00:45:40,014
Is Baek Myo gone?

532
00:45:49,984 --> 00:45:51,104
Did she leave?

533
00:46:04,884 --> 00:46:05,904
Thank you.

534
00:46:05,904 --> 00:46:08,244
It's not an antidote, per se.

535
00:46:09,204 --> 00:46:12,944
I obtained a medicinal
herb that's most similar

536
00:46:13,384 --> 00:46:15,144
and I've made the antidote.

537
00:46:15,784 --> 00:46:17,544
But you should only expect

538
00:46:17,544 --> 00:46:20,114
a temporary neutralization
of the poison.

539
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:22,084
Thank you so much.

540
00:46:31,124 --> 00:46:33,384
It's already been 15 days

541
00:46:33,384 --> 00:46:35,104
since he last left his room.

542
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,764
He must attend
the great meeting tomorrow.

543
00:46:39,764 --> 00:46:41,344
I'm worried.

544
00:46:41,344 --> 00:46:44,784
I'll be with him until the meeting,

545
00:46:44,784 --> 00:46:46,524
and I'll escort him there.

546
00:46:47,904 --> 00:46:51,064
I've obtained the antidote.

547
00:46:51,514 --> 00:46:53,184
- Is that true?
- Your Highness!

548
00:46:55,064 --> 00:46:58,584
Please keep this a secret for now.

549
00:46:59,664 --> 00:47:03,284
Please prepare for the great meeting.

550
00:47:03,284 --> 00:47:06,344
Wang Sik Ryeom and those in favor

551
00:47:06,344 --> 00:47:08,784
of the move the west
will object strongly.

552
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:10,334
We must be prepared.

553
00:47:11,124 --> 00:47:12,824
I understand, Your Highness.

554
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:22,544
- Ji Mong.
- Yes, Your Highness.

555
00:47:22,544 --> 00:47:24,924
The antidote is temporary.

556
00:47:27,604 --> 00:47:31,414
Now, we must try to change
Goryeo with the King.

557
00:47:49,424 --> 00:47:50,564
Your Majesty!

558
00:47:51,064 --> 00:47:53,004
So is here, Your Majesty.

559
00:47:58,144 --> 00:47:59,814
I'm here.

560
00:48:00,084 --> 00:48:01,684
It's you, So.

561
00:48:04,184 --> 00:48:05,784
So is here.

562
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:08,324
You must take your medicine, <i>Hyungnim.

563
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,084
Here's the medicine.

564
00:48:10,084 --> 00:48:10,884
Here.

565
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:27,134
- Medicine?
- Yes.

566
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:32,664
It will clear your head, <i>Hyungnim.

567
00:48:32,664 --> 00:48:36,084
Here, slowly.

568
00:48:38,684 --> 00:48:40,604
Chew it well.

569
00:48:40,604 --> 00:48:41,984
Yes, chew it well.

570
00:48:41,984 --> 00:48:44,204
Drink some water, too.

571
00:48:46,384 --> 00:48:47,624
Here.

572
00:48:50,604 --> 00:48:53,604
There we go.

573
00:48:58,684 --> 00:49:00,644
I'm sleepy.

574
00:49:00,644 --> 00:49:03,004
How am I always so sleepy?

575
00:49:03,364 --> 00:49:05,064
If you're sleepy,
then you should sleep.

576
00:49:05,064 --> 00:49:06,784
You should sleep comfortably.

577
00:49:06,784 --> 00:49:08,564
I'll wake you up,

578
00:49:08,564 --> 00:49:11,044
so you can lean on me and sleep.

579
00:49:11,524 --> 00:49:14,684
What are you doing with this?

580
00:49:16,184 --> 00:49:18,604
Let's put this aside, here.

581
00:49:21,284 --> 00:49:24,764
Go to sleep, lean on me.

582
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:28,494
Here's your blanket.

583
00:49:31,484 --> 00:49:35,604
There you go.

584
00:49:36,504 --> 00:49:38,384
Now that I'm doing this,

585
00:49:39,304 --> 00:49:43,664
I remember when we were young.

586
00:49:45,164 --> 00:49:46,124
Well

587
00:49:46,644 --> 00:49:48,804
I lost my way in the palace

588
00:49:49,184 --> 00:49:52,524
and I was so scared,

589
00:49:53,384 --> 00:49:56,644
but you held my hand so tight

590
00:49:57,344 --> 00:49:59,984
and told me,
“It's okay, you little boy.”

591
00:49:59,984 --> 00:50:01,984
“It's okay, So.”

592
00:50:02,644 --> 00:50:06,284
“If we follow that
road, we'll be okay.”

593
00:50:07,024 --> 00:50:11,844
“If we follow that road to
the end, we'll be okay.”

594
00:50:12,984 --> 00:50:18,314
Then you took my hand and kept going.

595
00:50:19,304 --> 00:50:20,284
Do you remember that?

596
00:50:22,824 --> 00:50:24,524
Did I do that?

597
00:50:24,984 --> 00:50:27,624
Yes, you did.

598
00:50:29,844 --> 00:50:30,984
Yes.

599
00:50:31,884 --> 00:50:33,964
I guess I did.

600
00:50:35,024 --> 00:50:36,104
<i>Hyungnim.

601
00:50:37,224 --> 00:50:41,964
This time, you can hold
my hand and follow me.

602
00:50:43,044 --> 00:50:47,244
I'll lead you to where you need to go.

603
00:50:51,324 --> 00:50:53,424
I was scared then, too.

604
00:50:54,984 --> 00:50:57,424
What if you're scared too, So?

605
00:50:58,324 --> 00:50:59,684
What do you mean?

606
00:50:59,684 --> 00:51:01,824
That's ridiculous!

607
00:51:01,824 --> 00:51:03,684
I'm not scared at all!

608
00:51:06,204 --> 00:51:08,204
So please wake up.

609
00:51:08,844 --> 00:51:10,624
You need to wake up soon,

610
00:51:11,724 --> 00:51:13,994
so you can walk down that path.

611
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:18,964
I'll walk with you by your side.

612
00:51:22,004 --> 00:51:23,904
It's okay, <i>Hyungnim.

613
00:51:24,824 --> 00:51:26,044
Yes.

614
00:51:31,744 --> 00:51:33,564
It's okay.

615
00:51:35,144 --> 00:51:36,624
It's okay.

616
00:51:45,004 --> 00:51:46,564
The sun is up.

617
00:52:01,214 --> 00:52:03,944
When will you get out of my bed?

618
00:52:33,074 --> 00:52:35,484
As the supervisor of the move to west,

619
00:52:35,484 --> 00:52:38,514
I'll report to you the progress.

620
00:52:39,104 --> 00:52:41,854
Yes, what was the result?

621
00:52:41,854 --> 00:52:45,784
I have a lot to tell you, Your Majesty.

622
00:52:47,984 --> 00:52:50,004
I've been asleep for too long.

623
00:52:50,964 --> 00:52:52,594
I must have a lot to do.

624
00:52:53,344 --> 00:52:56,964
You must take care of everything.

625
00:52:57,624 --> 00:52:59,284
Have you found a way

626
00:52:59,284 --> 00:53:00,824
to capture Wang Sik Ryeom?

627
00:53:04,684 --> 00:53:06,884
He killed the First King?

628
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:07,904
Wang Sik Ryeom did?

629
00:53:07,904 --> 00:53:09,264
The noblemen did?

630
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,214
This is the evidence.

631
00:53:17,854 --> 00:53:20,164
<i>Sal jae su ho guk.

632
00:53:22,744 --> 00:53:24,224
They'll kill the King

633
00:53:24,624 --> 00:53:27,044
and rule the nation.

634
00:53:27,044 --> 00:53:29,104
You'll lead the great meeting this time,

635
00:53:30,404 --> 00:53:32,584
and you must punish them for treason.

636
00:53:33,044 --> 00:53:34,604
Even if it's Wang Sik Ryeom,

637
00:53:35,084 --> 00:53:40,344
no one will take the side
of a treasonous man.

638
00:53:41,064 --> 00:53:44,684
Soon the requisition
order will commence,

639
00:53:44,684 --> 00:53:46,684
and if the move to the
west is accomplished,

640
00:53:46,684 --> 00:53:49,144
the people will suffer greatly.

641
00:53:49,544 --> 00:53:53,424
We must catch them before that happens.

642
00:53:55,424 --> 00:53:56,764
I will.

643
00:53:57,924 --> 00:54:00,594
I will punish those men no matter what.

644
00:54:02,564 --> 00:54:03,584
Ji Mong.

645
00:54:04,764 --> 00:54:07,304
Go to the Great Hall and get ready.

646
00:54:07,304 --> 00:54:08,264
Yes, Your Majesty!

647
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,304
Here are the documents
you've asked me to prepare.

648
00:54:16,304 --> 00:54:19,084
I've prepared how much money

649
00:54:19,084 --> 00:54:20,244
the spices will yield.

650
00:54:20,644 --> 00:54:21,844
Thank you.

651
00:54:23,324 --> 00:54:25,944
Don't tell my brother or Baek Myo

652
00:54:25,944 --> 00:54:28,584
that I'm going to
meet Princess Yeo Won.

653
00:54:29,084 --> 00:54:33,294
Okay, but I'll accompany you today.

654
00:55:04,584 --> 00:55:08,844
You must win, Your Highness.

655
00:55:10,824 --> 00:55:14,884
And hold on, Your Majesty.

656
00:55:16,134 --> 00:55:20,334
You must hold on.

657
00:55:25,944 --> 00:55:31,084
The King must've confined
himself in his room again today.

658
00:55:31,084 --> 00:55:35,014
They say he can't leave his room
because he's afraid of the sun.

659
00:55:35,014 --> 00:55:36,514
It's a big problem.

660
00:55:36,514 --> 00:55:38,244
What do you mean?

661
00:55:38,564 --> 00:55:40,954
Wang Sik Ryeom takes care of everything.

662
00:56:33,774 --> 00:56:34,884
For a while,

663
00:56:35,384 --> 00:56:37,014
there's been some disorder,

664
00:56:37,364 --> 00:56:39,284
so I couldn't give
the requisition order

665
00:56:39,284 --> 00:56:42,184
for the move to the west.

666
00:56:42,184 --> 00:56:43,444
Thus, today

667
00:56:43,444 --> 00:56:45,414
I will proclaim the requisition order

668
00:56:45,414 --> 00:56:48,884
for wartime mobilization!

669
00:56:51,144 --> 00:56:54,144
Before that, the ruler
of the central districts,

670
00:56:54,764 --> 00:56:58,644
General Gwak will come here

671
00:56:59,084 --> 00:57:02,464
and introduce himself to you all.

672
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:05,034
Now, come in.

673
00:57:09,664 --> 00:57:11,614
What are you doing, Wang Sik Ryeom?

674
00:57:11,614 --> 00:57:14,304
How dare you bring a foreigner
to a great meeting of Goryeo?

675
00:57:23,804 --> 00:57:25,864
What's the matter, Your Highness?

676
00:57:26,354 --> 00:57:28,584
Leave immediately, General Gwak!

677
00:57:37,404 --> 00:57:38,864
<i>It's that man.

678
00:57:39,244 --> 00:57:42,424
<i>The man who was trying to marry Gaebong

679
00:57:42,424 --> 00:57:43,864
<i>five years ago.

680
00:57:43,864 --> 00:57:47,674
Here comes the King!

681
00:58:39,404 --> 00:58:40,664
Your Majesty!

682
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,804
This is General Gwak,

683
00:58:43,244 --> 00:58:47,004
who rules the central districts.

684
00:58:51,744 --> 00:58:55,844
General Gwak is my old friend.

685
00:58:56,474 --> 00:59:00,164
I invited him here

686
00:59:00,164 --> 00:59:02,354
for he has something to share with us.

687
00:59:04,524 --> 00:59:07,384
<i>He'll cover up his crimes
with Gaebong's marriage.

688
00:59:07,384 --> 00:59:09,784
<i>I won't let that happen.

689
00:59:10,244 --> 00:59:14,364
<i>I will take Wang Sik Ryeom down today.

690
00:59:15,944 --> 00:59:18,044
- Testify?
- Your Majesty.

691
00:59:18,664 --> 00:59:21,784
Even if he's an old
friend of Wang Sik Ryeom,

692
00:59:21,784 --> 00:59:25,344
I think it's wrong that
he's attending this meeting!

693
00:59:26,344 --> 00:59:28,404
Please make him leave!

694
00:59:28,824 --> 00:59:34,004
I invited him because he has
something to share with us!

695
00:59:35,384 --> 00:59:37,004
Please wait a moment.

696
00:59:38,444 --> 00:59:41,584
Since you're here, please
enjoy your time here.

697
00:59:52,284 --> 00:59:55,904
I haven't been able
to attend the meetings,

698
00:59:56,164 --> 00:59:57,824
but my health has improved,

699
00:59:58,404 --> 01:00:01,224
and starting today, I'll
attend all meetings.

700
01:00:04,244 --> 01:00:05,664
Please prepare the fire,

701
01:00:06,424 --> 01:00:08,424
and call my royal bodyguards.

702
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:15,204
Your Majesty.

703
01:00:15,204 --> 01:00:18,304
Why do you need a fire all of a sudden,

704
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:21,244
and why do you need
the royal bodyguards?

705
01:00:21,524 --> 01:00:24,164

Why do you need them at this meeting?

706
01:00:25,324 --> 01:00:27,784
Pull yourself together, Your Majesty!

707
01:00:27,784 --> 01:00:33,574
There's rumor that
you've gone insane.

708
01:00:33,574 --> 01:00:34,704
Look, Wang Sik Ryeom.

709
01:00:36,124 --> 01:00:38,404
How dare you make such
ludicrous remarks?

710
01:00:39,664 --> 01:00:43,504
The King is well and healthy.

711
01:00:43,884 --> 01:00:45,414
How dare you say he's insane?

712
01:00:51,664 --> 01:00:52,904
Your Highness.

713
01:00:55,424 --> 01:00:57,764
Aren't you meeting General Gwak again

714
01:00:59,184 --> 01:01:02,104
after a long time?

715
01:01:06,644 --> 01:01:11,104
It's been about 5 years, hasn't it?

716
01:01:14,844 --> 01:01:16,204
Five years ago,

717
01:01:17,724 --> 01:01:21,364
the secret of the First King's death,

718
01:01:27,524 --> 01:01:29,464
do you know anything about that?

719
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:31,284
What?
