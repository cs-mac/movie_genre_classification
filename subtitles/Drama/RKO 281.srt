1
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:58,756
"Orson, come into the light. "

2
00:00:59,382 --> 00:01:02,343
Never stand in the shadows.

3
00:01:02,468 --> 00:01:04,637
You were made for the light.

4
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:06,681
Always remember that.

5
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,688
"Now, turn around"
and make a wish. Go on.

6
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:17,024
You must blow out your candles.

7
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:28,285
"One breath, now. "

8
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,704
That's all you get.
One chance.

9
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:33,832
Are you ready?

10
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:37,961
Now.

11
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:42,674
He came to the town
of magic and dreams...

12
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,719
a flashing star blazing
through the firmament of illusion.

13
00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:49,431
"He was 24 years old,"
and his name was orson welles.

14
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:51,474
"Sound the trumpets,"
"unfurl the banners, hollywood. "

15
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:53,560
The boy wonder has arrived.

16
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:55,645
"May 6, 1915."

17
00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:59,399
The prodigy makes his debut on
"the world stage in kenosha, wisconsin. "

18
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:03,403
"May 7. he speaks his first words,"
"and they are, "i am a genius. "

19
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:06,489
Subsequent developments
confirm this opinion.

20
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:11,494
"At 18 he goes to new york,"
the cauldron of the world.

21
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:14,872
"Watch out, cauldron. "
Orson has arrived.

22
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:16,707
Like hannibal over the alps...

23
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:21,337
the boy genius invades the great white
way with production after production.

24
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:24,465
And then he takes to the airwaves...

25
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,385
step two in his plan
for global domination.

26
00:02:28,552 --> 00:02:32,598
This is the end now.
They're running toward the east river

27
00:02:32,723 --> 00:02:36,476
"thousands of them,"
dropping in like rats.

28
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:38,395
The war of the worlds broadcast...

29
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,439
sends this nation into a frenzy.

30
00:02:40,564 --> 00:02:43,442
"Yes, the boy wonder has fooled us all. "

31
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:45,485
We had no idea
any of this was happening.

32
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:49,489
I feel just horrible.

33
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:51,408
Mr. Welles~ mr. Welles~

34
00:02:54,703 --> 00:02:57,622
how long can it possibly be
before the sunny land of dreams.

35
00:02:57,747 --> 00:03:01,626
Tries to harness the combustible power
of this showman extraordinaire?

36
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:06,047
The winner in the welles derby is
"george schaefer, head of rko pictures. "

37
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,550
With a contract unimaginable
before the days of orson...

38
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:13,095
"mr. Schaefer captures the whirlwind,"
snares the beast.

39
00:03:14,388 --> 00:03:18,059
Eyebrows raise and jaws drop
when terms of the deal come forth.

40
00:03:18,142 --> 00:03:21,520
"The boy wonder can write, direct"
and star in his own projects.

41
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:24,523
The studio?
"Well, they just pay the bills. "

42
00:03:26,984 --> 00:03:28,527
So cometh orson.

43
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:31,947
He met the biggest of the big
and charmed his way through the town.

44
00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:35,826
From the brown derby
to the copacabana.

45
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:37,578
From louella parsons to hedda hopper...

46
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:40,038
those rival maidens
of hollywood gossip.

47
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:43,083
"And so today, almost a year"
after his arrival...

48
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,919
we leave the boy wonder
still hard at work...

49
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:48,755
developing his much-anticipated
first feature.

50
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:50,840
"We're waiting, orson. "

51
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:51,675
Genius?

52
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:53,802
Who does that cocksucker
think he is?

53
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:57,972
"Word is glory boy's all finished,"
mr. Mayer. Can't come up with a movie.

54
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,143
They're laying bets at rko this deal
ends up with him never doing a picture.

55
00:04:02,477 --> 00:04:04,896
Back to new york he goes.

56
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,981
"After rko boots him,"
let's pick him up cheap.

57
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:09,776
Have him do that war of the worlds crap
as a feature.

58
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:14,071
It's money in the bank for us
"and, bingo, no more genius. "

59
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:19,076
"This is hollywood, junior. "
What did you expect?

60
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:22,830
And you keep coming up
with the same elitist crap.

61
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:24,623
"Enough, mank. "

62
00:04:24,748 --> 00:04:27,042
God~ i hear this from schaefer
and everyone else.

63
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,711
I don't need to hear it from you.

64
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:31,588
"Heart of darkness,"
million-dollar budget.

65
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:34,675
No one wants to see that
"that's nonsense, and you know it. "

66
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:37,886
What do you think movies are about?
"Don't start this, please. "

67
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:40,597
I'm interested.
What do you think movies are about?

68
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:43,684
Life's rich pageant.

69
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:46,770
"Life's rich pageant, my ass. "

70
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:48,939
People are sick to death of life.

71
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:51,024
They want make-believe.

72
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:56,571
"They want tarzan and jane,"
not tristan and isolde.

73
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,615
You know what they want?

74
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,866
Magic.

75
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:03,578
You know what your job is in hollywood?
Put butts in seats.

76
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,751
It's all about selling popcorn
and pepsi-colas.

77
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:11,586
Not for me it isn't.

78
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:13,921
Then you're about to become
the youngest never-was...

79
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:15,548
in the history of hollywood.

80
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,925
Better than the oldest has been.
Is it?

81
00:05:24,723 --> 00:05:27,560
What are we going to write?
I don't know. You tell me.

82
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:28,769
You're the boy wonder.

83
00:05:30,604 --> 00:05:31,730
Well?

84
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:34,983
Jesus christ. Come on.

85
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:38,237
The old man
doesn't cotton to lateness.

86
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:44,618
"Good evening, mr. Hearst. "

87
00:05:45,952 --> 00:05:47,662
My name is orson welles.

88
00:06:05,221 --> 00:06:08,057
"So we set traps everywhere, right?"

89
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:11,728
"And every morning,"
the traps would be sprung...

90
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:13,938
but there would be no mice.

91
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:15,648
What?
So one night...

92
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:17,984
i noticed pops here
getting out of bed...

93
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:20,903
i've got it.
"'Sigmund freud, life and times. "

94
00:06:20,987 --> 00:06:24,198
That's a great idea. Just got
your ass kicked on joseph conrad

95
00:06:24,323 --> 00:06:26,534
and now it's the id
and the superego.

96
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:28,953
I'll be goddamned if he
isn't springing the traps...

97
00:06:29,078 --> 00:06:31,538
and leaving cheese
for the goddamn mice.

98
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,211
"You. You and that guy disney,"
in love with the damn rats.

99
00:06:37,336 --> 00:06:38,879
"Okay, then, manolete. "

100
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:40,547
Who?

101
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:43,550
"Manolete,"
the great spanish bullfighter.

102
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:45,969
Imagine clark here
in a glittering suit of lights...

103
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:48,055
on the andalusian plains.

104
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,724
Mr. Welles
is attempting semaphore.

105
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:52,559
"Bullfighting, miss davies. "

106
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:55,687
Is dear mank your bull?

107
00:06:55,854 --> 00:07:00,108
"My factotum,"
"comrade-in-arms, ally. "

108
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:01,025
"Flunky, pimp. "

109
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:02,902
Writer.
That too.

110
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:05,655
You fight many bulls in new york?

111
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:07,574
"No, when i was a tender lad... "

112
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:11,577
my father and i made a tour
of the grand boulevards of europe.

113
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:13,037
When we were in spain...

114
00:07:13,204 --> 00:07:15,665
i had the good fortune
to sit at the knee of manolete...

115
00:07:15,832 --> 00:07:18,751
the greatest bullfighter
of the age.

116
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:21,295
'What is the matador's
greatest enemy?" he asked me.

117
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:23,381
"Of course, i naively responded,"
"the bull. "

118
00:07:23,714 --> 00:07:25,925
"No, the bull"
is merely his adversary.

119
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,886
His greatest enemy
is his own fear.

120
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:32,598
"You see, to kill the bull,"
one must first learn to think like him. "

121
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:37,811
"Having said that, he strode forth"
gallantly into the ring.

122
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:40,814
"He flourished, flourished again. "
Suddenly the bull charged.

123
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:43,859
"It thundered towards him,"
its calamitous hooves...

124
00:07:44,026 --> 00:07:46,236
shaking the earth
beneath manolete's feet...

125
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:49,114
"and as it was almost upon him,"
he stepped to the side...

126
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:51,116
flourished again and struck.

127
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:54,786
And when the dust cleared...

128
00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:58,331
the sword was gone...

129
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:00,959
vanished in the bloody eye
of the beast.

130
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:06,923
That is barbaric.

131
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:10,802
Of all man's sadism...

132
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:14,305
none is more depraved
than his cruelty to animals.

133
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:21,938
"In spain, sir, the cruelty would be"
in denying the beast a fighting end

134
00:08:22,063 --> 00:08:24,857
"as in your magnificent zoo,"
for instance.

135
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:31,697
"And who are you, sir?"
"Orson welles, sir. "

136
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,116
"Ah, the actor. "

137
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,787
And director.
I wish you luck.

138
00:08:39,955 --> 00:08:43,709
"In hollywood, the bull"
and the matador are both slaughtered.

139
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:50,215
Why the crack about the zoo?
Why not just let it lie?

140
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,300
Because he's a hypocrite.
So what?

141
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,886
I like to come here.
I want to be asked back.

142
00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:56,805
Why? You have no place here.

143
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,890
Because marion's my friend.

144
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:01,726
Did you hear what he said to me?

145
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:04,854
Preaching against man's cruelty
"to animals. I mean, come on~"

146
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,773
come here.
I want to show you something.

147
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:16,949
The old man owns the biggest
publishing empire in the world.

148
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:20,203
"When you have all that,"
you can preach whatever you want.

149
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:22,288
Like appeasing hitler.

150
00:09:22,455 --> 00:09:26,459
A lot of people agree with him.
He tells them what they want to hear.

151
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,836
As if that was
something to be proud of.

152
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:30,254
Can't smoke here.

153
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:32,173
Of course.

154
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:34,174
How could i forget?

155
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,218
"No smoking, no drinking... "

156
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,345
no moral vices whatsoever.

157
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:42,224
I suppose keeping an alcoholic mistress
half your age...

158
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:43,851
is considered a virtue here.

159
00:09:45,102 --> 00:09:47,854
The old man has his own way
of doing things.

160
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:50,107
I'll say.

161
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:02,869
"Oh, god,"
these parties are awful.

162
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:06,164
"You need to get out of here,"
rapunzel.

163
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:08,208
That's why he has the parties.

164
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:11,878
He says it's like
bringing the world to me.

165
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,842
But it's not so bad here. What girl
doesn't want to live in a castle?

166
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:22,263
Mr. Welles certainly is
"a caution, isn't he?"

167
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:26,225
"And attractive,"
in a hammy sort of way.

168
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:31,147
Listen. Why don't you come down
and stay with us for a few days?

169
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,190
Just tell the old man...

170
00:10:33,315 --> 00:10:34,942
he needs me here.

171
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,492
How big is this monstrosity?
The estate?

172
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:46,203
Half the size of rhode island.
You're kidding.

173
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:49,873
No. It's the place god
would have built if he'd had the money.

174
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:51,917
Hello.
Manky.

175
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:55,170
Will you dance with me?

176
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:57,839
I'll dance with you.
"Oh, good. Thank you. "

177
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,216
You've been naughty.
Can you smell it?

178
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:03,845
"So, are you ever"
gonna do a picture?

179
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:05,513
"Not you too, carole. "

180
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:09,267
"It's gonna be fine, orson. "
You're gonna do just great.

181
00:11:12,228 --> 00:11:13,271
You're just scared.

182
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:16,232
Am i?

183
00:11:18,943 --> 00:11:21,863
"And what am i scared of, carole?"

184
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:22,989
Of being found out.

185
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,950
Of not being a genius.

186
00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:29,829
"Goddamn it, pops. "
You gotta do something.

187
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:32,123
There's no need for such language.
Goddamn it.

188
00:11:37,878 --> 00:11:39,088
You missed the beat.

189
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:19,644
I've got it.
I know what we're going to do.

190
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:22,730
Imagine a man
who has shaped his time.

191
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:25,983
A titanic figure
of limitless ambition.

192
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:27,985
A man with an empire
at his feet...

193
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:30,071
controlling the perceptions
of everyone beneath him.

194
00:13:31,072 --> 00:13:33,074
A modern feudal lord.

195
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:38,621
"The great american biography,"
a journey into the heart of the beast.

196
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:40,205
"Oh, no. "
Don't you see it?

197
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:42,291
He's spent a lifetime
making entertainment...

198
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,085
"out of other people's lives,"
and now we turn the tables on him.

199
00:13:45,252 --> 00:13:47,296
It's perfect.
It's perfectly suicidal.

200
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:49,339
How long have i been looking
for the answer...

201
00:13:49,464 --> 00:13:51,425
when all this time it's been
right here under my nose?

202
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,427
"Every day in the newspapers,"
on the radio...

203
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:55,429
waiting for us
in that ridiculous castle~

204
00:13:55,554 --> 00:13:56,680
"orson, stop. "

205
00:13:57,013 --> 00:13:59,599
I've talked to arnie.
He says it's all right.

206
00:13:59,724 --> 00:14:02,644
He says he's a public figure who sought
"out that publicity, so legally... "

207
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:04,980
"listen to me, you child. "

208
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:07,440
He doesn't worry about legalities.
Do you know why?

209
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:11,069
Because he has more power than you
could even begin to imagine.

210
00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:14,030
- All the more reason to do it~
because he insulted you at a party?

211
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:17,575
Because he's a hypocrite.
Because he's a political turncoat.

212
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:19,452
He claims to care
about the common man...

213
00:14:19,577 --> 00:14:21,412
when nothing could be
further from the truth.

214
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:24,248
He's a journalist.
He owns hollywood.

215
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:27,084
We're the shit on his shoes.

216
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,004
You better go back to broadway.
I expected more from you.

217
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:32,590
"Yeah, me too,"
but i got used to it.

218
00:14:32,757 --> 00:14:36,218
"How does that feel,"
getting used to it?

219
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:39,096
"How does that feel, going up"
to the palace and amusing the lords

220
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,725
and ladies with the same stories
they've heard a hundred times before?

221
00:14:42,808 --> 00:14:46,311
How does it feel being the ugly monkey
they keep around to amuse themselves?

222
00:14:46,478 --> 00:14:50,190
"I remember a man who wrote, a writer who"
dazzled me with his wit and insight

223
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:52,442
who hasn't had a credit
in four years...

224
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:55,570
because he's been so busy
wasting himself amusing his keepers...

225
00:14:55,654 --> 00:14:58,281
because he's a sycophant who's been
thrown out of every hollywood studio

226
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:00,367
and no one will hire him
because he's a drunk.

227
00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:02,369
"I'm sorry, mank. "
You must be thirsty.

228
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:05,789
Here. Have another. I wouldn't want
to stand in the way of progress.

229
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:09,167
Do you honestly expect me
to believe you care about me?

230
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:11,628
You don't give a fuck
about anyone but yourself.

231
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:15,381
Hearst was right about you.
You're just another goddamn actor.

232
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:22,180
I'm sorry.

233
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:25,057
"Orson, i don't have it"
in me anymore.

234
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,811
"I used to have dreams too,"
but that's over now.

235
00:15:29,103 --> 00:15:30,438
It doesn't have to be.

236
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,649
No studio would hire me.
I'll hire you.

237
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:36,235
I just know this is the story.
Everything in my life...

238
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,863
"all the potential, all the promise"
has led to this moment...

239
00:15:39,196 --> 00:15:40,406
to you and me.

240
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:44,284
"Orson, he will destroy us. "

241
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:48,789
"Take my hand, mank. "

242
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,584
We'll make history.

243
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:56,338
We'll scorch the earth.
We will astonish them all.

244
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:02,260
Notes for a novel.
My great modern tragedy.

245
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:06,139
On hearst.
You're joking.

246
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:09,225
I guess great minds think alike.

247
00:16:09,392 --> 00:16:12,520
You've never told me about this before.
I haven't looked at it in ten years.

248
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,190
"More importantly,"
i never showed it to anyone else

249
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:17,567
you know why?
Because i wanna go living

250
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:23,489
time to let go
"of that ambition, old boy. "

251
00:16:26,868 --> 00:16:28,244
"Rosebud. "

252
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:31,372
What?

253
00:16:32,873 --> 00:16:35,292
"Marion told carole lombard...

254
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:39,338
that the old man's pet name for it
is 'rosebud. "'

255
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:45,636
"My god, mank. He has a pet name"
for her pussy and you never told me?

256
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:49,890
"Orson, you can't do a picture"
where you have a pet name for a pussy.

257
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:53,560
"In fact, you can't do a picture"
where you have any name for a pussy.

258
00:16:53,727 --> 00:16:55,854
"Oh, i think we can find a way. "

259
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:58,648
"You just don't get it, do you?"

260
00:16:58,732 --> 00:17:01,276
Why do you think
i scrapped all this stuff?

261
00:17:01,443 --> 00:17:04,529
You can't scrap this.
It's too good. This is gold.

262
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:07,657
Gold. You want gold?
I'll give you some gold.

263
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:10,702
This is a story you won't find
written down in there or anywhere else.

264
00:17:10,785 --> 00:17:12,787
It's 1924 or so...

265
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:18,334
and hearst is giving a birthday party
for an old hollywood producer...

266
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:19,669
called thomas ince...

267
00:17:20,878 --> 00:17:22,714
on his yacht.

268
00:17:22,797 --> 00:17:27,718
And all the usuals are there...
"charlie chaplin, louella, etcetera. "

269
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:30,179
And at this time
marion was screwing everyone...

270
00:17:30,304 --> 00:17:32,431
and so she slips off
with chaplin.

271
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:35,184
Hearst sees this.

272
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,479
He goes absolutely nuts.

273
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:40,773
He's there on the deck
with a revolver...

274
00:17:40,898 --> 00:17:43,817
just blasting away
like tom mix...

275
00:17:43,984 --> 00:17:47,363
and he hits thomas ince
"right in the chest, and he is dead. "

276
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:48,781
Dead.

277
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,451
The empire snaps into action.

278
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:55,329
Ince is cremated lickety-split.

279
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:57,414
No police. No inquest.

280
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:00,876
The hearst papers
cover it up nice and quiet.

281
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:05,755
"The next morning, hearst offers louella"
a lifetime contract...

282
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,799
to keep her all hush-hush.

283
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:10,844
Now you tell me.

284
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:13,888
You still want to take a shaft
to a man like that?

285
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:19,519
Are you kidding me?
More than ever.

286
00:18:19,686 --> 00:18:21,646
It's supposed to be siam...

287
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:25,400
some kind of balinese temple.

288
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:28,986
Does it look like
a temple to you?

289
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,620
"Marion,"
i've spoken to millicent.

290
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:44,460
She said no... again.

291
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:48,547
She believes it would put
her soul in peril.

292
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:52,593
"Divorce is a very serious sin,"
evidently.

293
00:18:52,718 --> 00:18:54,678
It's bullshit.

294
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:58,432
It's bullshit. She just cares
"about the money, you know?"

295
00:18:58,557 --> 00:19:01,643
She thinks i'll make you
cut her out of the will.

296
00:19:01,768 --> 00:19:04,020
I do wish you wouldn't
use that language.

297
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:06,523
"He's a monster,"
an unfeeling monster...

298
00:19:06,606 --> 00:19:07,691
like all great men.

299
00:19:07,816 --> 00:19:09,985
"Yeah, but how"
do we dramatize that?

300
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:12,404
Say we say there was a time
when he was innocent.

301
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:15,407
There was a time when he...
when he lost something.

302
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,785
Something he loved?

303
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:23,706
You're off there.
Men like hearst don't love.

304
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:27,585
"All men love, orson,"
or have loved.

305
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,295
What about marion?

306
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:33,424
She's just another piece
in his collection.

307
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,843
She's just like one
of the animals in his zoo.

308
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:39,722
"To hearst, that is love. "i love you. "
I built you a beautiful cage. "

309
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:46,478
Love on his own terms.

310
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,399
No?

311
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,865
Love on your own terms.

312
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,495
Those are the only terms
anybody ever knows.

313
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:13,004
There's your tragedy.

314
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,407
"Orson, i'm in. "

315
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,451
What?
I'll write it.

316
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,414
"Mank, that is the sweetest thing"
you've ever said to me.

317
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,750
I'll call george. I'll get a secretary.
"No, i'll get two secretaries. "

318
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,836
We can get houseman.
Don't sit there. Start writing~

319
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,463
i just wanna know
when i'm gonna see a script.

320
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:00,133
How about a month? Is that acceptable?
'Acceptable"? No.

321
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,552
Anything more than three weeks
is totally unacceptable.

322
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:03,929
What do you want me to do?

323
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,972
"I've got new york on the phone,"
a fiscal quarter...

324
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,016
mank and houseman are writing already.
Who?

325
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:11,770
Herman mankiewicz.
Mank? That'd be a goddamn miracle

326
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,025
"a toast, then, jedediah,"
to love on my own terms.

327
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:21,571
Because those are the only terms
"anybody has ever known, his own. "

328
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:26,492
Telegram from the christ child.

329
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,660
"Schaefer loves the idea. Stop.

330
00:21:27,785 --> 00:21:30,580
Keep writing. Stop.
Stop drinking. Stop.

331
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:33,541
Did you work on the jigsaw puzzles?
Question mark.

332
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:36,669
Don't stop. Stop.
"Love you madly, orson. "

333
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:38,170
Asshole. Stop.

334
00:21:54,853 --> 00:21:58,607
So gregg toland plunks his oscar down
for wuthering heights and says...

335
00:21:58,732 --> 00:22:01,693
"mr. Welles,"
i want to shoot your picture. "

336
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,780
"Mr. Toland," i said, "you are the"
finest cinematographer in hollywood.

337
00:22:04,905 --> 00:22:08,492
Why would you want to work
with a stumbling neophyte?"

338
00:22:08,617 --> 00:22:10,076
"Mr. Welles," he replied... "

339
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:11,745
"the only way
to learn anything new...

340
00:22:11,912 --> 00:22:13,538
is to work with someone
who doesn't know a thing. "

341
00:22:13,705 --> 00:22:15,040
Priceless.

342
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,960
"The whole point, hedda,"
is to use the language of cinema

343
00:22:19,085 --> 00:22:21,129
as though it's never
been spoken before...

344
00:22:21,254 --> 00:22:22,755
to challenge the audience.

345
00:22:22,881 --> 00:22:25,592
Why does anyone go
to the movies in the first place?

346
00:22:25,717 --> 00:22:26,551
To see themselves.

347
00:22:27,593 --> 00:22:29,637
"To see their own bizarre, complex,"
fascinating and paradoxical lives...

348
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:32,140
"orson, talk english, will you?"

349
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:35,601
The most powerful narrative tool
ever invented...

350
00:22:35,726 --> 00:22:37,603
and it's fallen
into the hands of bankers.

351
00:22:37,728 --> 00:22:40,898
"Come on, louella. There's got to be"
something more to movies than money.

352
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:42,566
What's your favorite picture?

353
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,027
"Gold diggers, 1933."

354
00:22:48,614 --> 00:22:50,574
So the transition
is somehow less painful...

355
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:53,160
as the audience leaves the theater
and returns to reality.

356
00:22:53,285 --> 00:22:55,913
They feel as if their own lives
have been touched upon...

357
00:22:56,038 --> 00:22:58,832
"that they have been given, well,"
at least a rendition of the truth...

358
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:00,667
that finally
they have been treated with...

359
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:02,753
this is all terribly interesting...

360
00:23:02,878 --> 00:23:05,756
but what's all this i hear
about you and dolores del rio?

361
00:23:12,637 --> 00:23:16,975
"Now, orson, you know,"
i'm just dying to see your picture...

362
00:23:17,058 --> 00:23:18,977
and i know
it's gonna be boffo.

363
00:23:19,102 --> 00:23:22,605
But the story's about a publisher.
"You're not doing hearst, are you?"

364
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,774
"Good god, no. "

365
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:26,901
Our character
"is more an amalgam, really... "

366
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:29,988
look into my eyes and tell me
you're not doing hearst.

367
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:37,245
I'm not doing hearst.

368
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:08,692
Well?

369
00:24:16,783 --> 00:24:17,784
It's too long.

370
00:24:19,035 --> 00:24:22,038
Talk to houseman.
He's the one who wanted wide margins.

371
00:24:22,205 --> 00:24:24,249
The flashback scheme
isn't working...

372
00:24:24,374 --> 00:24:26,292
and keep susan and leland
separate at the end...

373
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:27,919
or there's no sense
of time lapse.

374
00:24:28,044 --> 00:24:30,797
"If you do that,"
then the logic breaks down.

375
00:24:30,922 --> 00:24:33,758
"Look, mank. "
It's a brilliant script.

376
00:24:33,883 --> 00:24:36,177
No question.
Absolutely brilliant.

377
00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:39,222
"It needs some shaping, that's all. "
Yeah. Sure.

378
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:41,223
We should celebrate.
"Drinks, housey. "

379
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:43,809
I still have three weeks left
on my contract.

380
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:46,729
"If you prepare some notes,"
i'll do the revisions.

381
00:24:46,854 --> 00:24:49,106
I don't have three weeks.
Schaefer wants it yesterday.

382
00:24:49,231 --> 00:24:51,192
I'll send you the revisions.
And we need to change the name.

383
00:24:51,317 --> 00:24:53,986
What? The title?
"No, no. "

384
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:56,030
It's a grand title.
"American. "

385
00:24:56,113 --> 00:24:58,073
I was thinking more
the character name.

386
00:24:58,198 --> 00:25:03,620
Charles foster craig doesn't have the
'knives-out" poetry i was looking for.

387
00:25:03,745 --> 00:25:05,956
I was thinking of "kane. "

388
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:08,834
As in "abel"?

389
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:10,752
K- a-n-e.

390
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:12,754
One strong syllable. Kane.

391
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:15,257
'Craig" is one syllable.
Yes...

392
00:25:15,382 --> 00:25:16,883
but it's not a great syllable.

393
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,134
"Thanks, housey. "

394
00:25:21,846 --> 00:25:24,641
"No, i haven't been drinking"
since i started this.

395
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:33,107
To my invaluable comrades.

396
00:25:40,114 --> 00:25:41,782
Good-bye.

397
00:25:43,784 --> 00:25:45,745
"American"?

398
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:49,081
"It's an awful title, of course,"
but i can't think of anything better.

399
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:53,877
Someone came up with
"a sea of upturned faces"...

400
00:25:54,003 --> 00:25:57,715
"which has a nice,"
sort of operatic ring to it.

401
00:25:57,881 --> 00:25:59,133
I thought
"of"john citizen, u. s. a. "... "

402
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:02,344
but that struck me
as a bit warner brothers...

403
00:26:02,469 --> 00:26:04,888
"or, god forbid, capra-esque. "

404
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:08,767
Citizen.
What?

405
00:26:08,892 --> 00:26:10,102
"Citizen kane. "

406
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,187
That's your title.

407
00:26:12,312 --> 00:26:13,939
"Citizen kane. "

408
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,817
A "z" and a "k. " wouldn't look half bad
"on a poster, would it?"

409
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,235
Don't get ahead of yourself.

410
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:21,780
These budget projections
i know.

411
00:26:21,905 --> 00:26:25,241
I don't know what you want me to do.
I've cut the script down to the bone.

412
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:27,327
"Listen, and don't throw a fit. "

413
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,915
I want you to seriously think
about doing war of the worlds.

414
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,960
"Oh, god, george, please, no. "
Do war of the worlds as a feature

415
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,087
and everybody will be happy.

416
00:26:38,212 --> 00:26:41,841
Don't ask me to do this.
You're a 24-year-old novice director.

417
00:26:42,842 --> 00:26:45,136
"This is difficult material,"
maybe impossible.

418
00:26:45,261 --> 00:26:47,972
And old man hearst is gonna
come down on us with all he's got.

419
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:51,433
Think of the free publicity.
"Oh, please~"

420
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:54,144
"look, george,"
every idea has its moment.

421
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,106
This one is right now.
If it's half as good as i think it is...

422
00:26:57,189 --> 00:27:00,192
it's not a matter of good or bad.
At the end of the day...

423
00:27:00,317 --> 00:27:02,319
why did you got into
"this business, george?"

424
00:27:02,486 --> 00:27:03,904
Why?

425
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:06,156
Wasn't there a time when making pictures
meant something to you...

426
00:27:06,323 --> 00:27:07,908
that it mattered
just a little bit...

427
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:10,160
that they were worth
taking risks for?

428
00:27:12,496 --> 00:27:15,457
If you look into my eyes right now and
tell me to go make war of the worlds

429
00:27:15,832 --> 00:27:17,876
i will.

430
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:19,169
I'll make it.

431
00:27:19,294 --> 00:27:21,796
"And, yes, it'll make you money,"
and i honestly...

432
00:27:23,214 --> 00:27:26,760
i can't think of a reason why
you should let me make this picture

433
00:27:26,968 --> 00:27:27,844
except that you should.

434
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:33,516
"You know, i'd do anything"
to get you the hell out of my office.

435
00:27:36,102 --> 00:27:39,105
Here.
Go make the goddamn picture.

436
00:27:40,898 --> 00:27:42,066
Tracking...

437
00:27:44,402 --> 00:27:46,529
"medium shot, close-up. "

438
00:27:46,904 --> 00:27:48,030
Reverse.

439
00:27:48,114 --> 00:27:49,907
Medium shot.

440
00:27:50,908 --> 00:27:52,910
Reverse. What lens is that?
- 24

441
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:55,037
open aperture.

442
00:27:55,204 --> 00:27:57,122
We used it on long voyage.

443
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:00,542
Could you run
"that reel again, frank. "

444
00:28:13,055 --> 00:28:14,264
That's the one there.

445
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:18,935
"I'm not sure, mr. Welles. "
"I'll try. Yeah, mr. Welles. "

446
00:28:55,596 --> 00:28:57,056
You fuck.

447
00:28:57,181 --> 00:28:59,141
You selfish fuck.

448
00:29:01,477 --> 00:29:05,314
"A studio pal, if that's"
"not an oxymoron, sent it to me. "

449
00:29:08,108 --> 00:29:11,528
"I thought we did it together, orson,"
i thought it was the two of us...

450
00:29:11,653 --> 00:29:17,409
"but, you see,"
citizen kane by orson welles.

451
00:29:17,492 --> 00:29:21,329
You took my name
off the fucking script?

452
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:24,916
It's a mistake. Some steno girl
obviously made a mistake.

453
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,336
You took my name off the script?
You can't do that.

454
00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:32,382
I fucking well can. I own your goddamn
"script, and i can do anything i want~"

455
00:29:32,507 --> 00:29:34,550
don't forget for one minute
that i took...

456
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:37,929
your 350 pages of drunken rambling
and made a movie out of them.

457
00:29:38,054 --> 00:29:41,891
And now i've got to shoot
"the son of a bitch, so thank you"

458
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,518
"thank you very much,"
but i have all i need.

459
00:29:43,643 --> 00:29:45,144
And stop calling me.

460
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:55,654
Today...

461
00:30:01,285 --> 00:30:03,996
today we are beginning
a great adventure.

462
00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:09,001
"Together, we're going to tell a story"
that i think is of some importance.

463
00:30:09,168 --> 00:30:13,922
"Now, i won't lie to you. I have"
absolutely no idea what i'm doing.

464
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:19,052
Every one of you has had more time
on a soundstage that i have.

465
00:30:19,177 --> 00:30:21,179
Every one of you
knows your job...

466
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:23,932
"and i, of course,"
am still learning mine.

467
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,103
I ask for your patience
and your help.

468
00:30:31,064 --> 00:30:33,066
That you...

469
00:30:34,442 --> 00:30:36,986
allow yourselves
to get a little lost with me...

470
00:30:38,196 --> 00:30:41,491
to travel into the dark wood
of uncertainty...

471
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:44,160
to take a few wrong turns.

472
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,371
"Because along the way, I... "

473
00:30:47,538 --> 00:30:51,042
i think we just might discover
something amazing together.

474
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,047
"That's swell, orson. Now, where"
do you want to put the camera?

475
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:12,479
It's a director's contract.
Why the hell did you sign this?

476
00:31:12,563 --> 00:31:16,733
"This is a suicide note, george. "
The bastard's got us by the balls~

477
00:31:16,817 --> 00:31:18,110
"i trust him, harry, deep down. "

478
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,613
- Have you seen 24?
- Yeah. I've never seen anythinglike 24

479
00:31:21,738 --> 00:31:22,989
i don't believe it.

480
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:24,532
What?

481
00:31:24,658 --> 00:31:27,202
"He shot three scenes,"
two with dialogue...

482
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,287
when he was only supposed
to be doing camera tests.

483
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,165
"George, the man is obviously"
an anarchist.

484
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,500
Yeah.

485
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,127
Who's two days
ahead of schedule.

486
00:31:36,252 --> 00:31:39,255
Son of a bitch~ 281.

487
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,678
Look right in the lens. Don't take
"your eyes off it till i yell, " cut. "

488
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:49,390
"Thank you, darling. The lines aren't"
important right now. Sit right here.

489
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:52,476
See if you can get your...
she's fine~ thank you.

490
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:55,187
Look right into the camera and
you'll be fine. All right? Great.

491
00:31:57,565 --> 00:32:00,150
I still think we should under-crank
and play it backwards.

492
00:32:00,276 --> 00:32:02,111
"When i want your opinion,"
i'll ask for it.

493
00:32:02,152 --> 00:32:04,488
"Collaboration, orson. "
"Make it fast, andy~"

494
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:05,781
"call it, kit~"
roll camera~

495
00:32:06,156 --> 00:32:08,075
and action~

496
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:21,296
"thank you, ladies and gentlemen. "
That was terrific.

497
00:32:21,379 --> 00:32:24,174
"Wonderful, dot, really. "
Really wonderful. Top-notch.

498
00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:28,219
"On the next one, maybe you"
could close your mouth.

499
00:32:28,303 --> 00:32:30,305
We can go for
a slightly more subtle version.

500
00:32:30,472 --> 00:32:32,057
"Well done, though. "

501
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,185
Right.

502
00:32:37,312 --> 00:32:39,147
Obviously we need to go again.

503
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:43,359
I'll be in makeup.

504
00:32:49,865 --> 00:32:52,326
"Orson, you cannot just"
"destroy a camera, for chrissakes. "

505
00:32:52,493 --> 00:32:54,537
You know what these things cost?

506
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,163
"I know, george. "
I feel terrible about it.

507
00:32:57,373 --> 00:32:59,291
What about this one?
Black tie.

508
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:01,377
We borrowed one from next door.
"Stole it, really. "

509
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:03,504
I don't think
they'll notice till monday.

510
00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:05,839
"Look, i need"
"perhaps this, mr. Welles?"

511
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:09,093
Try the other one. I'm sorry.
I need agnes for another day.

512
00:33:09,218 --> 00:33:11,178
Do you think you could
fix it for me?

513
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:14,097
"Good. Thanks, george. "
I've got to run.

514
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,227
What?

515
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:24,816
Action.

516
00:33:25,692 --> 00:33:26,776
Rosebud?

517
00:33:28,695 --> 00:33:30,822
I'll tell you about rosebud.

518
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:32,866
Cut. Let's go again.

519
00:33:35,577 --> 00:33:36,578
Action.

520
00:33:36,744 --> 00:33:38,538
Rosebud?

521
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:39,539
Keep rolling.

522
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:40,790
Rosebud?

523
00:33:43,418 --> 00:33:46,212
I'll tell you about rosebud.

524
00:33:46,248 --> 00:33:48,631
Cut. Again.

525
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:57,890
"Orson, you cannot shoot"
56 takes of one line.

526
00:33:58,265 --> 00:34:00,226
It's the climax of the picture.

527
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:03,395
The audience has been waiting for
two hours to find out what rosebud is.

528
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,439
"If they don't believe they're about to,"
we've let them down.

529
00:34:05,564 --> 00:34:07,441
The trick doesn't work.
The whole picture depends on it~

530
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:08,484
it's one line.

531
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:11,612
"Cut, print, end of story. "

532
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:51,901
Drunk. What do you care?

533
00:34:52,235 --> 00:34:54,862
You don't care about anything
except you.

534
00:34:54,987 --> 00:34:59,366
You just want to persuade people
that you love 'em so much...

535
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:01,494
that they ought
to love you back.

536
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,288
Only you want love
on your own terms.

537
00:35:16,383 --> 00:35:17,467
Orson?

538
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:20,971
You want to cut?

539
00:35:21,346 --> 00:35:22,639
"No, keep rolling. "

540
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:24,891
"Right. Sorry, joe. "

541
00:35:25,016 --> 00:35:27,018
Anywhere in your speech.

542
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:31,815
Action.

543
00:35:33,858 --> 00:35:36,736
Drunk. What do you care?

544
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:39,739
"And i'm looking at them,"
and they're looking back at me

545
00:35:39,864 --> 00:35:42,825
waiting for something brilliant.

546
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:46,287
"The only thing is, so am i. "

547
00:35:46,371 --> 00:35:49,373
Waiting for some moment of inspiration
that will finally convince them all

548
00:35:49,499 --> 00:35:54,587
that i'm worth all the time and trouble
and money they've invested in me.

549
00:35:55,796 --> 00:35:57,798
"But i'm not, am i, mank?"

550
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:04,388
I'm just a fraud who couldn't care less
about anyone except himself.

551
00:36:04,513 --> 00:36:05,723
Isn't that right?

552
00:36:06,682 --> 00:36:09,393
I don't know.
Is that what you think?

553
00:36:10,477 --> 00:36:14,314
I don't know what i think.
That's the problem.

554
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,737
I just know
that i miss you and...

555
00:36:24,491 --> 00:36:27,869
i was wondering if you
might consider coming back.

556
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:32,290
First you wanted me out.
I'm out.

557
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:42,759
I'm sorry.

558
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:47,597
This is the shooting script
we've been using every day.

559
00:36:47,764 --> 00:36:49,891
I thought you'd like to see it.

560
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:04,446
Did i ever tell you
about my father?

561
00:37:05,781 --> 00:37:08,909
"He was a drunk, my dad. "

562
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:13,580
"When my mother died,"
i was obliged to accompany him

563
00:37:13,747 --> 00:37:15,999
on his business trips...
"europe, china. "

564
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:19,044
"I suppose, in one sense,"
it was a way of seeing the world.

565
00:37:19,378 --> 00:37:22,422
Richard head welles
and his amazing boy genius.

566
00:37:22,589 --> 00:37:26,510
"But he would drink,"
and it would get embarrassing and...

567
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:31,598
"well, i began to resent him because"
"i was so sparkling, you see. "

568
00:37:31,765 --> 00:37:34,476
So when we got home
and i went off to school...

569
00:37:35,935 --> 00:37:37,854
i decided to cut him off.

570
00:37:39,856 --> 00:37:41,983
I turned my back on him
because...

571
00:37:44,485 --> 00:37:46,446
i couldn't have him
getting in the way of my genius.

572
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,492
He would write me letters
that i would never answer.

573
00:37:53,703 --> 00:37:55,746
"He would call me,"
and i would ignore his calls.

574
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:01,460
"When he eventually visited me at school,"
i would manage to find myself...

575
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:03,462
conveniently indisposed.

576
00:38:04,672 --> 00:38:07,132
"When i finally did see him again,"
he was in a coffin.

577
00:38:08,509 --> 00:38:09,718
I was 15.

578
00:38:12,471 --> 00:38:13,639
And...

579
00:38:14,807 --> 00:38:17,100
"all of a sudden,"
he wasn't the...

580
00:38:18,018 --> 00:38:20,020
the embarrassing drunk anymore.

581
00:38:22,814 --> 00:38:24,691
He was my father.

582
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:30,030
He was the man
who showed me the world.

583
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:38,580
Have you shot
the beach scene yet?

584
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:44,586
Good. It occurred to me
the other day...

585
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:48,673
that we're starting that scene
completely incorrectly.

586
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,605
Closer.

587
00:39:05,564 --> 00:39:06,857
Closer. Stop.

588
00:39:07,024 --> 00:39:08,567
Can you see my shoes?

589
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:10,945
"Yeah, but we lose your head. "

590
00:39:12,237 --> 00:39:15,240
Joe. Do me a favor
"and stand in here, will you?"

591
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:29,212
"Look, gregg,"
it has to be lower.

592
00:39:29,588 --> 00:39:32,048
This is the scene. We have
to look up at these two men...

593
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:34,134
as pillars soaring to the sky...

594
00:39:34,259 --> 00:39:35,802
towering virtues in combat...

595
00:39:35,927 --> 00:39:38,680
orson~
we've been through this.

596
00:39:38,805 --> 00:39:41,975
"We can't get the camera any lower,"
so find another goddamn shot~

597
00:39:49,941 --> 00:39:53,027
what the fuck are you doing?
Looks like he's tearing out the floor

598
00:40:17,926 --> 00:40:19,845
it's four in the goddamn morning.

599
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,139
"My favorite time of day, gregg. "

600
00:40:22,306 --> 00:40:25,934
I've set back the sacred cause
"of reform, is that it?"

601
00:40:29,104 --> 00:40:30,272
All right.

602
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:35,527
If that's the way they want it.
People have made their choice.

603
00:40:35,652 --> 00:40:38,029
It's obvious the people
prefer jim gettys to me.

604
00:40:38,154 --> 00:40:41,699
You talk about the people
as though you own them...

605
00:40:41,783 --> 00:40:44,077
as though they belong to you.

606
00:40:46,788 --> 00:40:48,623
"Orson, i'm so goddamn tired. "

607
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,708
"Keep rolling, gregg. "
I can't remember the lines.

608
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:53,169
"Come on, joe. You're drunk,"
you're angry. Use it.

609
00:40:53,294 --> 00:40:57,715
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine.
Some of us humans need sleep.

610
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,676
That's good.
Now give me the goddamn line.

611
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:03,637
You've been waiting for weeks to say
something to me. Don't go soft now.

612
00:41:03,804 --> 00:41:05,806
You don't care about anything
except you.

613
00:41:07,016 --> 00:41:09,643
You just want to persuade people
that you love 'em so much...

614
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,729
that they ought
to love you back.

615
00:41:12,688 --> 00:41:13,647
Only you want love
on your own terms.

616
00:41:13,814 --> 00:41:15,816
"A toast, then, jedediah. "

617
00:41:17,234 --> 00:41:19,736
To love on my own terms.

618
00:41:19,862 --> 00:41:21,989
Those are the only terms
anybody ever knows.

619
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,283
His own.

620
00:41:24,366 --> 00:41:27,202
Cut. Print.
"What's next, gregg?"

621
00:41:27,327 --> 00:41:28,745
That's it.
We're done.

622
00:41:29,162 --> 00:41:29,746
What?

623
00:41:29,871 --> 00:41:31,206
We're done.

624
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:40,924
"How 'bout a real drink, then?"

625
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,726
"Mr. Welles,"
compliments of mr. Schaefer.

626
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,731
Daylight. Hey.

627
00:42:20,441 --> 00:42:23,361
Orson? Hedda here.
"Hedda, what a surprise. "

628
00:42:23,486 --> 00:42:25,363
You naughty boy.

629
00:42:25,571 --> 00:42:28,366
You told me that i would be the first
human soul to see your masterpiece

630
00:42:28,491 --> 00:42:31,494
and i read in the reporter there's
a screening for the magazines tonight.

631
00:42:32,495 --> 00:42:34,038
That's only a rough cut.
"Oh, rough cut. "

632
00:42:35,998 --> 00:42:39,460
"Been there, orson. Know the drill. "
See you tonight.

633
00:42:46,008 --> 00:42:48,635
This is awful. There's no music.
The sound isn't even synced.

634
00:42:48,761 --> 00:42:52,389
Relax. They've all seen
a rough cut before.

635
00:42:52,598 --> 00:42:54,474
"I know, but why hedda, george?"
The magazines are one thing...

636
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,854
"if hedda says she's coming, you just"
mix up a batch of martinis and pray.

637
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:34,555
What did that mean?

638
00:43:36,182 --> 00:43:38,601
"Oh, mr. Hearst~"

639
00:43:39,894 --> 00:43:43,606
hello. I am so delighted
you could take my call.

640
00:43:44,732 --> 00:43:46,692
I just wanted
to let you know...

641
00:43:46,817 --> 00:43:50,696
that i saw this orson welles picture
last night.

642
00:43:51,864 --> 00:43:54,700
"First screening ever,"
don't you know.

643
00:43:54,825 --> 00:43:58,704
"And, mr. Hearst, i just"
don't understand something.

644
00:43:59,955 --> 00:44:04,918
I do not understand
why louella has not told you...

645
00:44:06,503 --> 00:44:07,963
that it's all about you.

646
00:44:08,088 --> 00:44:09,756
About me?
Yes.

647
00:44:09,923 --> 00:44:11,841
In detail?
Yes.

648
00:44:11,967 --> 00:44:14,886
Thank you for this information.
"No, it's my pleasure, sir. "

649
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,559
Yes?

650
00:44:21,684 --> 00:44:24,103
"Mr. Schaefer,"
miss louella parsons is here.

651
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,647
Here? As in right outside?

652
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:27,732
"Yes, sir. "

653
00:44:27,857 --> 00:44:29,901
Tell her to wait a minute.
Yes

654
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,152
shit~

655
00:44:43,998 --> 00:44:46,917
i gotta see this welles picture.
I was just fixing something to drink.

656
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:50,629
You drink at 10:00 a. m.?
"No, i meant... "

657
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:52,256
and i want to see
the picture today.

658
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:55,968
That may be a tad difficult.
"Cut the malarkey, buddy. "

659
00:44:56,134 --> 00:44:58,637
The boss himself wants me
to see the picture today.

660
00:44:58,804 --> 00:45:01,848
He asked you personally?
That's right.

661
00:45:01,974 --> 00:45:02,933
Hearst?

662
00:45:03,058 --> 00:45:05,268
Bingo~
i'll be back at noon.

663
00:45:06,311 --> 00:45:07,854
"Oh, joy. "

664
00:45:07,979 --> 00:45:10,190
"Continue with your singing, susan. "

665
00:45:10,315 --> 00:45:13,276
I don't propose
to have myself made ridiculous.

666
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,279
You don't propose
to have yourself made ridiculous?

667
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,657
What about me? I'm the one
that's gotta do the singin'.

668
00:45:20,658 --> 00:45:23,202
I'm the one that gets the raspberries.
Why don't you let me alone?

669
00:45:23,328 --> 00:45:24,871
It's all you.

670
00:45:24,996 --> 00:45:29,083
"The war with pulitzer,"
"the castle, marion. "

671
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:34,589
How so?
The jigsaw puzzles and the career.

672
00:45:34,714 --> 00:45:38,926
A man spending a fortune to make her
a star. Only it's opera and not movies.

673
00:45:40,177 --> 00:45:42,596
And
yes?

674
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:45,307
The drinking.

675
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:51,689
Go on.
The whole picture's a mess.

676
00:45:51,855 --> 00:45:54,817
Jumps all over the place.
Very arty.

677
00:45:54,983 --> 00:45:58,195
It's all built around this sled
called "rosebud" that the guy had

678
00:45:58,362 --> 00:45:59,696
when he was a kid.

679
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:02,699
What did you say?
"Yeah, the guy's last words... "

680
00:46:02,824 --> 00:46:04,826
are about a sled he had as a kid
called rosebud.

681
00:46:04,993 --> 00:46:06,870
Makes no sense at all.

682
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:09,748
Rosebud.
Yeah.

683
00:46:15,712 --> 00:46:18,131
"So, our life is the subject"
for mockery.

684
00:46:19,048 --> 00:46:21,342
All of it...

685
00:46:21,718 --> 00:46:23,720
every personal detail.

686
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:30,059
Thank you for your time.

687
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:33,688
"Thank you, sir. "

688
00:46:35,398 --> 00:46:37,316
Miss parsons...

689
00:46:39,068 --> 00:46:42,613
i have one additional question
for you.

690
00:46:42,822 --> 00:46:43,823
Sir?

691
00:46:43,989 --> 00:46:46,367
Why were we not informed
of this sooner?

692
00:46:48,202 --> 00:46:48,744
Sir?

693
00:46:49,912 --> 00:46:53,832
I pay you a good deal of money
to be my eyes and ears in hollywood

694
00:46:53,957 --> 00:46:55,876
do i not?

695
00:46:55,959 --> 00:46:59,213
If you cannot provide this simple
"service, then you are of no use to me. "

696
00:46:59,379 --> 00:47:01,798
"But, sir"
"please, be quiet. "

697
00:47:03,759 --> 00:47:07,846
This young man has made
a motion picture detailing my life.

698
00:47:08,972 --> 00:47:13,226
This motion picture was made
at a not-insignificant studio...

699
00:47:13,393 --> 00:47:15,854
and you knew nothing about it.

700
00:47:15,979 --> 00:47:21,401
He lied to me. He looked me in the face
and told me it wasn't about you.

701
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:26,406
And how do you feel
when you are lied to?

702
00:47:26,781 --> 00:47:28,658
I want blood.

703
00:47:28,783 --> 00:47:29,951
Good.

704
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:32,829
Retain that feeling.

705
00:47:34,122 --> 00:47:35,790
Let it nourish you.

706
00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:40,962
It shall nourish us both.

707
00:47:42,129 --> 00:47:44,090
Randolph.

708
00:47:44,215 --> 00:47:47,343
Louie. I hope you don't mind
my popping in like this.

709
00:47:47,468 --> 00:47:49,386
Not at all.
Come on. Sit down.

710
00:47:52,848 --> 00:47:55,392
What a wretched place this is.

711
00:47:55,768 --> 00:47:58,854
I never come to town
without feeling filthy.

712
00:47:59,897 --> 00:48:03,859
You really must buy that piece of
property near the castle and come north.

713
00:48:04,818 --> 00:48:07,237
"I wish i could, but business. "

714
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,448
Which is why i'm here.

715
00:48:09,823 --> 00:48:12,367
You've heard of
this citizen kane picture?

716
00:48:12,492 --> 00:48:15,328
Yeah. Rko.

717
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:21,918
Evidently it details the exploits
of a newspaper publisher...

718
00:48:22,293 --> 00:48:23,211
much like myself.

719
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:27,382
Entirely too much like myself.

720
00:48:29,175 --> 00:48:31,469
No one wants their private life
paraded about...

721
00:48:31,803 --> 00:48:34,138
for the curiosity
of the moviegoing public...

722
00:48:35,348 --> 00:48:37,391
if you catch my drift.

723
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:43,898
I don't see how the release of this
"picture will do anyone any good, really. "

724
00:48:45,024 --> 00:48:48,944
So sue him.
That's what i'd do.

725
00:48:49,028 --> 00:48:50,946
"Thank you, louie. "

726
00:48:51,906 --> 00:48:53,824
I'll keep it in mind.

727
00:48:53,991 --> 00:48:58,829
"Say, while i'm in town, why don't we"
stop by the I.a. Country club...

728
00:48:58,954 --> 00:48:59,913
and play 18 holes?

729
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:08,171
Maybe we could get mr. Warner
to join us...

730
00:49:08,255 --> 00:49:10,424
and mr. Cohn...

731
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:12,467
and mr. Selznick...

732
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:14,803
and mr. Goldwyn.

733
00:49:19,891 --> 00:49:21,518
The club is restricted.

734
00:49:21,976 --> 00:49:23,061
"Oh, so it is. "

735
00:49:24,979 --> 00:49:29,859
How silly of me. I sometimes forget
that you're all jews.

736
00:49:31,361 --> 00:49:33,363
Apparently quite a number
of people forget...

737
00:49:33,529 --> 00:49:35,531
if they ever knew.

738
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:43,247
See what you can do
about this citizen kane picture.

739
00:49:43,372 --> 00:49:47,042
"Will you, louie?"
"That's right, fella. "

740
00:49:47,209 --> 00:49:49,879
Mr. Hearst has authorized me
to tell you that you're looking

741
00:49:50,004 --> 00:49:52,882
at the most beautiful lawsuit
in history if you release this picture.

742
00:49:53,048 --> 00:49:56,051
"He'll bleed your little studio dry,"
and you can all go back to new york

743
00:49:56,218 --> 00:49:58,137
and do shakespeare
with the boy wonder.

744
00:49:59,221 --> 00:50:03,267
Can i talk to hearst?
You are talking to him.

745
00:50:09,981 --> 00:50:13,151
The journal was particularly harsh
on roosevelt today.

746
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,987
"You really oughta lay off him, pops. "

747
00:50:16,404 --> 00:50:18,490
"He is the president, you know?"

748
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:21,326
He's a bolshevik.

749
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:24,120
He'll have us at war with germany
within the year.

750
00:50:25,163 --> 00:50:27,415
I think i'll run that picture
of him in a wheelchair.

751
00:50:27,582 --> 00:50:28,958
Please don't.

752
00:50:31,961 --> 00:50:33,504
What do you think?

753
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:41,345
"Sir, we got the call. "

754
00:50:47,268 --> 00:50:49,145
"Thank you, joseph. "

755
00:50:55,025 --> 00:50:58,946
"What is it, pops?"
Nothing for you to worry about

756
00:50:59,113 --> 00:51:01,031
what is it?

757
00:51:02,074 --> 00:51:05,536
The s. e. c. Has turned down my request
for relief on the debts.

758
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:08,997
How much?

759
00:51:09,122 --> 00:51:11,291
It's not something
how much?

760
00:51:14,377 --> 00:51:16,004
$125 million.

761
00:51:16,171 --> 00:51:19,382
We're $125 million in debt?

762
00:51:21,009 --> 00:51:22,218
Yes.

763
00:51:25,972 --> 00:51:26,431
Wow.

764
00:51:28,474 --> 00:51:31,978
How does one get
$125 million in debt?

765
00:51:33,604 --> 00:51:37,024
One buys things.

766
00:51:59,505 --> 00:52:01,465
We open on monument valley.

767
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,675
Towering stalagmites
reaching towards heaven...

768
00:52:04,009 --> 00:52:06,220
as we track in
"on a single, solitary figure. "

769
00:52:06,345 --> 00:52:08,597
A quiet man.
Come here.

770
00:52:08,722 --> 00:52:10,223
A lonely man.

771
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:12,267
Who is he?

772
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,271
I don't want a hot sound.
No vibrato.

773
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:20,066
You wanna do the life of christ?

774
00:52:20,191 --> 00:52:22,694
"You have to admit,"
it has a built-in audience.

775
00:52:23,028 --> 00:52:25,572
We shoot it like a western...
"vibrant, stark, modern. "

776
00:52:26,573 --> 00:52:29,200
All on location in the mojave desert.

777
00:52:29,367 --> 00:52:31,244
His next picture.
He wants to play christ.

778
00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:34,289
I hope he's planning to start
with the crucifixion. You read louella?

779
00:52:35,248 --> 00:52:37,417
I am trying to work.

780
00:52:38,376 --> 00:52:41,087
"Sorry, bernie,"
we'll take it outside.

781
00:52:41,212 --> 00:52:42,421
Sounds wonderful.

782
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:48,010
"So, what am i today, a puny upstart"
or a spoiled dilettante?

783
00:52:48,135 --> 00:52:50,346
It wouldn't be that.
She probably can't spell dilettante.

784
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:54,225
"And how is the country to feel
when this industry...

785
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:57,645
continues to employ bedraggled
foreigners and swarthy refugees

786
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,688
instead of real americans?

787
00:52:59,772 --> 00:53:02,357
Doesn't hollywood know
there's a depression on?

788
00:53:02,524 --> 00:53:06,069
Don't real americans
deserve work?"

789
00:53:06,195 --> 00:53:07,112
At least she's off kane.
Off kane?

790
00:53:07,237 --> 00:53:10,699
"Orson, this is code language"
to the studio bosses.

791
00:53:11,074 --> 00:53:14,077
"Bedraggled foreigners
and swarthy refugees. "

792
00:53:14,244 --> 00:53:17,581
Who do you think that could be?
I don't know. Peter lorre?

793
00:53:17,747 --> 00:53:22,002
Who owns this town?
Who runs every studio? Jews.

794
00:53:22,127 --> 00:53:25,130
"Okay, they're jews. So what?"
"They're jews, just like you. "

795
00:53:25,255 --> 00:53:29,092
"Listen, you idiot. "
This is just the first shot.

796
00:53:29,259 --> 00:53:31,678
"The next time, she will"
actually use the "j" word...

797
00:53:31,803 --> 00:53:35,765
and the studio bosses will do anything
to keep that word from going into print.

798
00:53:36,099 --> 00:53:37,308
And hearst knows it.

799
00:53:37,475 --> 00:53:41,104
"What are they gonna do, mank? Are they"
gonna kill me? Is that what you think?

800
00:53:41,229 --> 00:53:44,190
Why don't you ask thomas ince
that question?

801
00:53:44,607 --> 00:53:45,775
"Sorry, mr. Welles,"
we need to be able to hear.

802
00:53:55,284 --> 00:53:57,536
He knows. Do you understand
what that means?

803
00:53:57,661 --> 00:53:59,663
That he knows?
He knows.

804
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:03,125
What are you afraid of? It's in the can.
There's nothing they can do.

805
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:07,504
"Yeah, and it will stay in the can. "
That film will never come out.

806
00:54:07,629 --> 00:54:10,799
Hearst will not allow it.
The studio heads will not allow it.

807
00:54:11,133 --> 00:54:13,176
That film will never see
the light of day.

808
00:54:13,302 --> 00:54:15,470
"Are you on their side, mank?"
What?

809
00:54:15,595 --> 00:54:18,223
That's what it sounds like to me.
Are you on their side?

810
00:54:19,516 --> 00:54:22,143
"For chrissakes, you wrote the script. "
You fought for the credit.

811
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:26,147
"That's right, and i told you"
"that this would happen, didn't i?"

812
00:54:26,272 --> 00:54:27,232
Didn't i tell you? Huh?

813
00:54:27,357 --> 00:54:31,444
"Right. Listen, i got my check. "
You got yours. Let's move on.

814
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:33,488
I will not move on~

815
00:54:35,657 --> 00:54:37,825
"who are they, mank?"

816
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:42,371
Who are these men you're so afraid of?
Who are these tiny little fucking men?

817
00:54:44,874 --> 00:54:47,335
They're accountants.

818
00:54:47,418 --> 00:54:49,462
We're ready.
You wanna hear it?

819
00:55:18,198 --> 00:55:19,866
Switch it off.

820
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,168
Would everybody please leave?

821
00:55:47,518 --> 00:55:52,606
"They got us, didn't they, pops?"
"I mean, they nailed us, didn't they?"

822
00:55:53,941 --> 00:55:56,527
Crazy old man and his whore.

823
00:55:56,652 --> 00:55:59,321
Marion
bought and paid for...

824
00:55:59,738 --> 00:56:02,408
just like one of his
goddamn statues.

825
00:56:04,576 --> 00:56:07,246
"At least in the movie,"
he marries her.

826
00:56:08,956 --> 00:56:12,668
- That picture...
- i-i'm not that woman.

827
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:16,380
"I know what i could've been, and i know"
what i gave up to be with you.

828
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,886
"I mean, they've even got"
the goddamn jigsaw puzzles in there.

829
00:56:26,431 --> 00:56:29,768
Why did they do that to us?
Why would they do that to us?

830
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,943
Has he no idea
of the power that controls him?

831
00:56:43,364 --> 00:56:46,284
Get me louella parsons.
Now.

832
00:56:47,994 --> 00:56:51,455
Fancies himself an artist.
That's not art.

833
00:56:51,622 --> 00:56:55,376
It's an abomination.
The man's a charlatan...

834
00:56:55,501 --> 00:56:58,629
gossipmonger and a fraud.

835
00:57:00,673 --> 00:57:02,258
Miss parsons.

836
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:05,803
Use the file.

837
00:57:05,886 --> 00:57:08,430
"So, what have we got here, I.b.?"

838
00:57:09,807 --> 00:57:12,434
We got faggots
and commies and junkies.

839
00:57:12,809 --> 00:57:16,688
We got movie stars
screwing niggers and little girls.

840
00:57:16,813 --> 00:57:18,857
We got jews.

841
00:57:19,024 --> 00:57:24,362
"We got mgm, warner brothers,"
"columbia, disney and fox. "

842
00:57:24,487 --> 00:57:26,281
We got hollywood.

843
00:57:26,406 --> 00:57:28,658
What do you want?
Kill citizen kane.

844
00:57:28,825 --> 00:57:32,245
How?
I don't give a shit.

845
00:57:32,328 --> 00:57:35,456
"The boss has been working on some stuff,"
and i've been working on some stuff.

846
00:57:35,582 --> 00:57:39,335
Now i want all you boys
working on some stuff...

847
00:57:39,502 --> 00:57:42,463
'cause if it looks like this movie
is ever gonna come out...

848
00:57:42,588 --> 00:57:45,800
i start running down the street
with these pictures...

849
00:57:45,925 --> 00:57:49,845
like a screaming woman
"with her throat cut, you follow?"

850
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:04,443
How bad is it?

851
00:58:05,361 --> 00:58:07,363
Ms. Davies
"come on, joe, how bad is it?"

852
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:10,699
It's bad.

853
00:58:17,623 --> 00:58:21,001
I've been thinking about
the examiner in chicago.

854
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:23,420
It's not making any headway
against the tribune.

855
00:58:24,087 --> 00:58:26,756
Circulation is way down.

856
00:58:27,132 --> 00:58:30,885
I think we should buy the tribune.
Eliminate the competition.

857
00:58:31,011 --> 00:58:36,057
And i'm starting a campaign against
mr. Welles and his tawdry little film.

858
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:41,062
Yeah.

859
00:58:41,854 --> 00:58:43,731
"Sure, pops. "

860
00:58:45,733 --> 00:58:49,320
What do you want me to do?
No one's willing to open this movie.

861
00:58:49,445 --> 00:58:53,324
"So we open in dallas, detroit,"
kalamazoo. It doesn't matter.

862
00:58:53,532 --> 00:58:55,034
"For god's sakes,"
we could show it in a circus tent.

863
00:58:55,409 --> 00:58:57,078
"Come on, orson. "
We have to go public.

864
00:58:57,411 --> 00:59:00,498
"If they see kane, he's exposed. "
The film is our best defense.

865
00:59:00,915 --> 00:59:03,918
- If we get the press on our side...
- he is the press~

866
00:59:04,084 --> 00:59:05,961
goddamn it~

867
00:59:06,962 --> 00:59:08,505
"george, wait. "

868
00:59:10,883 --> 00:59:14,386
You don't understand. The stockholders
in new york are scared shitless.

869
00:59:14,553 --> 00:59:16,430
We start a publicity campaign
against hearst now...

870
00:59:16,555 --> 00:59:19,891
and he'll destroy every rko picture
that's out there.

871
00:59:20,017 --> 00:59:22,436
I'm about this far away
from being fired myself...

872
00:59:22,602 --> 00:59:24,479
and i'm the only friend
you have in the world.

873
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:27,524
You must trust. I'll do what i can.
We have to fight them.

874
00:59:27,607 --> 00:59:31,778
We have to go on the radio...
radio? You think this is a game?

875
00:59:31,861 --> 00:59:34,364
You have any idea
how many people rko employs?

876
00:59:34,489 --> 00:59:36,491
"You wanna shoot yourself in the head,"
go ahead and do it.

877
00:59:36,616 --> 00:59:40,537
I can't stop you. But you're not gonna
drag this company down with you.

878
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:45,625
We need to make a statement. We have to
tell people what's he's trying to do.

879
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:48,878
There's not gonna be
any statements.

880
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:52,590
I'm talking about jobs.
I'm talking about food on the table.

881
00:59:52,757 --> 00:59:55,509
"No, you're not. You're talking about"
letting them bury my picture.

882
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:58,971
"My picture. "
"My picture. "

883
00:59:59,138 --> 01:00:01,557
I'm so sick and tired
of hearing you say that.

884
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:03,517
It's my picture too~

885
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:05,728
it's his life.
Did you ever think about that?

886
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:09,148
"How can you defend him, george,"
after what he's done to us?

887
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:11,734
"He's a monster,"
a soulless monster.

888
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:14,736
"Oh, come on. "
"Who are you kidding, kid?"

889
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,531
Huh? You're the soulless monster.

890
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:20,158
"George, please. "
"George, listen to me. "

891
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:21,702
It's all i've got~

892
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:35,507
"it's all i've got, george. "

893
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:38,593
Whose fault is that?

894
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:49,479
Explain it to me then.
There is nothing to explain.

895
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:53,566
Millions of dollars a year
on art and statues...

896
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,693
and there's nothing to explain?

897
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,737
I will not defend
my life to you.

898
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,197
I'm not asking you
to defend anything...

899
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:04,994
"but we're in a pickle here,"
and we need to talk about it.

900
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,664
"We are in no "pickle,"
as you so euphemistically put it.

901
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:15,504
"You gotta wake up now, pops. "

902
01:01:16,672 --> 01:01:18,715
There is nothing more to discuss.

903
01:01:19,716 --> 01:01:22,594
"You don't have any money left, okay?"

904
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:25,555
That's what no one else will tell you.
You are broke. You spent it all.

905
01:01:25,722 --> 01:01:29,976
You cannot buy the goddamn chicago
tribune. You can't buy a goddamn thing.

906
01:01:30,101 --> 01:01:32,604
You are being
"excessively theatrical, marion. "

907
01:01:32,729 --> 01:01:35,565
"As it just so happens,"
i need the tribune.

908
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:39,235
That's just it. You don't need it.
You don't need any of it.

909
01:01:39,569 --> 01:01:43,948
"I mean, that statue, for instance. "
How much did that cost?

910
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:46,743
It's 17th-century from avignon.
That's in france.

911
01:01:46,868 --> 01:01:49,495
I know where fucking avignon is.

912
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:52,081
There is no need for you
to use that kind of language with me.

913
01:01:52,248 --> 01:01:56,002
Did you need it?
Did you need any of it?

914
01:01:57,128 --> 01:01:59,588
I wanted it.

915
01:01:59,755 --> 01:02:03,592
And there is a difference
between want and need.

916
01:02:03,717 --> 01:02:05,928
Not to me~

917
01:02:06,762 --> 01:02:09,682
why? Just so you could show
what a big man you are?

918
01:02:09,807 --> 01:02:11,558
Is that it?

919
01:02:11,684 --> 01:02:15,604
That's right.
You've captured me exactly.

920
01:02:16,605 --> 01:02:17,606
So good night.

921
01:02:20,025 --> 01:02:22,903
Where are you go...
hey~

922
01:02:22,986 --> 01:02:27,783
"pops, you will... you will not"
walk out on me this time.

923
01:02:27,949 --> 01:02:30,827
You're repellent to me
when you drink.

924
01:02:32,162 --> 01:02:36,750
"Well, tough shit,"
because we have to talk about this.

925
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:40,837
"You are crude, slovenly"
and unattractive...

926
01:02:40,962 --> 01:02:43,590
and this discussion
is at an end.

927
01:02:43,756 --> 01:02:45,633
"Fuck you, mr. Kane. "

928
01:02:49,762 --> 01:02:51,639
I will not have this in my home.

929
01:02:51,764 --> 01:02:54,642
- I'm just trying to understand...
"- no, you're not. "

930
01:02:54,725 --> 01:02:57,645
"You want to condemn me,"
like everyone else.

931
01:02:57,728 --> 01:03:00,314
You want to point your finger
at the pathetic old man...

932
01:03:00,648 --> 01:03:04,568
"grown lunatic with his spending,"
trapped in his ridiculous castle

933
01:03:04,693 --> 01:03:06,695
still fighting old battles
he will never win.

934
01:03:06,821 --> 01:03:09,073
"No, pops. "
There is nothing to understand

935
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:12,326
only this:

936
01:03:13,786 --> 01:03:16,288
I am a man
who could've been great...

937
01:03:19,124 --> 01:03:20,876
but was not.

938
01:03:25,172 --> 01:03:30,093
I was 18 when he was 50.
Really?

939
01:03:30,218 --> 01:03:33,847
"I just saw that big old gold ring,"
and i just grabbed right on...

940
01:03:34,014 --> 01:03:35,932
'cause he was gonna make me a star.

941
01:03:36,016 --> 01:03:37,934
And he did.

942
01:03:38,018 --> 01:03:39,894
Yeah.

943
01:03:40,019 --> 01:03:42,856
I wanted to do comedies...

944
01:03:42,939 --> 01:03:44,983
"silly stuff, you know?"

945
01:03:46,401 --> 01:03:48,945
"But, pops... "

946
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:53,199
he doesn't get comedies too good.

947
01:03:53,282 --> 01:03:56,077
He kept putting me
in those period pieces.

948
01:03:58,287 --> 01:04:03,292
"Carole, you know"
this citizen kane movie?

949
01:04:03,417 --> 01:04:07,087
The one that's supposed to be
about pops...

950
01:04:07,796 --> 01:04:12,801
and everything and the character of
susan alexander is supposed to be me?

951
01:04:13,218 --> 01:04:15,971
"Marion, everyone knows"
you're not like that.

952
01:04:16,096 --> 01:04:18,015
That's just the thing.

953
01:04:19,892 --> 01:04:21,810
I am like that.

954
01:04:25,105 --> 01:04:29,818
This little girl comes from nowhere
and meets this...

955
01:04:30,777 --> 01:04:33,113
this guy.

956
01:04:33,238 --> 01:04:35,865
"He rules the world, you know?"

957
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:42,372
"And somewhere along the line,"
she gets lost.

958
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,877
Thinking like that
is only gonna drive you nuts.

959
01:04:49,087 --> 01:04:51,339
You were a great star.

960
01:04:52,965 --> 01:04:54,884
You had a good run.

961
01:04:55,927 --> 01:04:58,346
That ought to be enough.

962
01:04:58,471 --> 01:05:00,806
"All of a sudden, it's not. "

963
01:05:03,768 --> 01:05:05,436
You know?

964
01:05:05,895 --> 01:05:10,774
It's hell when you
gotta look back and you say...

965
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,276
"what i could've been. "

966
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:44,099
Can i help you?

967
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:48,770
My god.

968
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:52,857
How much for all of it?

969
01:06:05,786 --> 01:06:08,998
...of the nazi weapons
of destruction.

970
01:06:09,081 --> 01:06:12,418
It is unmistakably apparent
to all of us...

971
01:06:12,543 --> 01:06:18,257
that unless the advance of hitlerism
is checked now...

972
01:06:18,382 --> 01:06:20,300
the western hemisphere...

973
01:06:36,274 --> 01:06:39,819
you got my memo.
What do we do?

974
01:06:39,944 --> 01:06:43,865
He's a fucking pisher.
Why does hearst give a shit?

975
01:06:43,948 --> 01:06:46,201
It's enough that he does.
Would louella really do it?

976
01:06:46,951 --> 01:06:49,454
In a new york minute.
I say to hell with louella and hearst.

977
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:53,916
"This hits all of us. It's our business,"
and we can't take it lying down.

978
01:06:54,876 --> 01:06:56,419
We all didn't make
"gone with the wind, you know?"

979
01:06:56,544 --> 01:06:59,463
Some of us can't afford
your principles.

980
01:06:59,547 --> 01:07:02,174
We gotta look at this
checkbook-wise.

981
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:05,219
Who isn't hurting already?

982
01:07:05,302 --> 01:07:07,847
All this jew talk?

983
01:07:07,972 --> 01:07:10,182
Now he's boycotting rko ads.

984
01:07:10,266 --> 01:07:13,561
"Next week, it's warners,"
"fox or columbia, right?"

985
01:07:13,894 --> 01:07:16,313
Goddamn right.
Got us nailed.

986
01:07:16,438 --> 01:07:21,068
"Dates, times, photographs,"
for god's sake.

987
01:07:21,235 --> 01:07:25,280
"I don't mean to be funny,"
but what could he have on mickey mouse?

988
01:07:25,405 --> 01:07:27,324
He's got you so tied in with
j. Edgar hoover and america first

989
01:07:27,407 --> 01:07:31,161
you might as well put on a brown shirt
and kiss those kiddies good-bye.

990
01:07:31,286 --> 01:07:34,247
"Relax, walt. At least he don't"
have you screwing snow white.

991
01:07:34,414 --> 01:07:36,541
I got fuckin' errol flynn
on my payroll.

992
01:07:37,876 --> 01:07:39,586
"You're a smart man, louie. "

993
01:07:39,878 --> 01:07:43,965
I suspect you didn't call us
all here without a plan.

994
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:45,091
Give over.

995
01:07:45,258 --> 01:07:49,929
"We will buy this movie,"
and we will destroy it.

996
01:07:51,097 --> 01:07:53,558
We will assemble a fund between us...

997
01:07:53,933 --> 01:07:55,601
and we will go
to george schaefer...

998
01:07:57,103 --> 01:08:00,356
and we will buy the negative
and every print of citizen kane

999
01:08:00,481 --> 01:08:02,400
and we will burn them.

1000
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:07,071
If i don't hear an objection to
this agenda in the next five seconds

1001
01:08:07,154 --> 01:08:09,573
i'll assume the motion is carried.

1002
01:08:15,454 --> 01:08:16,163
Very well.

1003
01:08:16,288 --> 01:08:20,209
What does it profit a man
to gain the whole world...

1004
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:23,128
if he loses his soul?

1005
01:08:23,212 --> 01:08:26,131
"And john the baptist says,"
"a night with rita hayworth. "

1006
01:08:29,259 --> 01:08:31,178
Just the man we're looking for.
Look.

1007
01:08:32,179 --> 01:08:34,181
Not a single scene
shot in the studio.

1008
01:08:34,306 --> 01:08:37,475
You'll have to help me with account...
i think you should sit.

1009
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:42,230
I don't want to sit down.
"All right, don't sit down. "

1010
01:08:42,355 --> 01:08:45,650
The bosses of the other studios...

1011
01:08:46,109 --> 01:08:47,152
"have made an offer of $800,000... "

1012
01:08:47,318 --> 01:08:50,905
to buy the negative
and all the prints to burn them.

1013
01:08:52,156 --> 01:08:55,201
They went to the stockholders
in new york. I've talked to swanbeck.

1014
01:08:57,495 --> 01:08:58,287
I think they're going to take it.

1015
01:09:16,096 --> 01:09:17,348
You shit.

1016
01:09:19,475 --> 01:09:21,435
You treacherous little shit.

1017
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,605
"Orson, this isn't george's fault. "
Shut up.

1018
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:31,069
"You wanna take my movie, george?"

1019
01:09:31,194 --> 01:09:34,197
Is that it?
Is that what you came here for?

1020
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:41,663
Take it. Why not
"take it all, george, hmm?"

1021
01:09:42,038 --> 01:09:45,417
Why not take everything?
Jesus.

1022
01:09:46,126 --> 01:09:49,212
"Everything i am,"
everything i could be is in that film.

1023
01:09:49,379 --> 01:09:51,589
"Take it, george. "
Here. I offer it up to you.

1024
01:09:53,216 --> 01:09:57,136
"No, george, wait. Please. "

1025
01:09:57,553 --> 01:09:59,722
"George, i'm sorry. "
I'm sorry.

1026
01:10:00,181 --> 01:10:02,016
"Look, i am... "

1027
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,561
"george, please just, just... "

1028
01:10:05,686 --> 01:10:08,105
give me one more chance.

1029
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:11,108
"Let me go to new york. Please,"
let me go talk to the stockholders.

1030
01:10:12,068 --> 01:10:15,529
"I promise you... i promise you,"
you will never see me again.

1031
01:10:57,654 --> 01:11:00,364
Ace of spades.

1032
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:11,125
Ace of spades.

1033
01:11:34,314 --> 01:11:36,191
Good afternoon.

1034
01:11:38,819 --> 01:11:44,574
"Today, a man from germany"
invaded greece.

1035
01:11:45,158 --> 01:11:48,620
He's already swallowed poland...

1036
01:11:48,745 --> 01:11:52,207
"denmark, norway and belgium. "

1037
01:11:52,832 --> 01:11:55,251
He's bombing london
as i speak.

1038
01:11:57,253 --> 01:12:01,174
"Everywhere this man goes, he crushes"
the life and freedom of his subjects.

1039
01:12:01,299 --> 01:12:04,343
He sews yellow stars
in their lapels.

1040
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:06,387
He takes their voices.

1041
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:11,851
"In this country,"
we still have our voices.

1042
01:12:13,269 --> 01:12:15,855
"We can argue with them,"
and we can sing...

1043
01:12:16,188 --> 01:12:20,526
"and we can be heard because we are,"
"for the moment, free. "

1044
01:12:24,697 --> 01:12:30,160
No one can tell us what to say
"or how to say it, can they?"

1045
01:12:31,703 --> 01:12:33,288
Gentlemen...

1046
01:12:34,748 --> 01:12:36,458
i am one voice.

1047
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:40,295
That is all.
My picture is one voice.

1048
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:43,340
"One view, one opinion,"
nothing more.

1049
01:12:45,675 --> 01:12:49,179
"Men are dying in europe now,"
and americans soon will be...

1050
01:12:49,346 --> 01:12:53,141
so that we can surmount
the tyrants and the dictators.

1051
01:12:54,684 --> 01:12:57,895
Will you send a message
across america...

1052
01:12:58,229 --> 01:13:02,900
that one man
can take away our voices?

1053
01:13:04,861 --> 01:13:07,196
So...

1054
01:13:07,363 --> 01:13:10,241
who is mr. Hearst...

1055
01:13:10,366 --> 01:13:13,244
and who is mr. Welles?

1056
01:13:13,327 --> 01:13:16,705
"Well, mr. Hearst built"
a palace of brick and mortar...

1057
01:13:16,831 --> 01:13:21,335
and little wars and corpses
piled high.

1058
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:26,256
Mr. Welles built a palace
of illusion.

1059
01:13:27,508 --> 01:13:32,179
It's what we call
a matte painting.

1060
01:13:32,304 --> 01:13:34,348
It's a camera trick.
It's nothing.

1061
01:13:35,474 --> 01:13:37,434
Nothing but a dream.

1062
01:13:41,938 --> 01:13:43,356
Today...

1063
01:13:45,275 --> 01:13:47,819
you have the chance...

1064
01:13:47,944 --> 01:13:50,947
to let the dream triumph.

1065
01:13:52,741 --> 01:13:53,658
Thank you.

1066
01:14:17,431 --> 01:14:19,308
We open may 1.

1067
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,775
"It was a pretty speech, orson,"
but you got lucky.

1068
01:14:28,901 --> 01:14:31,445
Hearst is going bankrupt.
It's all over the wire.

1069
01:14:35,365 --> 01:14:37,451
Pretty speeches
"change the world, george. "

1070
01:14:40,328 --> 01:14:40,829
"You meant it, right?"

1071
01:14:42,956 --> 01:14:45,292
Does it matter?

1072
01:14:55,844 --> 01:14:57,428
Yes~

1073
01:14:59,597 --> 01:15:01,516
it matters.

1074
01:15:12,026 --> 01:15:15,780
We will be immediately closing 12
of the papers and the wire services

1075
01:15:15,905 --> 01:15:19,867
and we will be liquidating
some other assets as soon as possible

1076
01:15:19,992 --> 01:15:24,872
and most of your land in mexico
and your art and antiquities.

1077
01:15:24,997 --> 01:15:28,459
Mr. Hearst spent his life
collecting this art.

1078
01:15:28,584 --> 01:15:30,502
We've been in touch
with gimbel's in new york...

1079
01:15:30,586 --> 01:15:32,880
and they've agreed to hold
a special sale.

1080
01:15:33,046 --> 01:15:35,591
They've given over an entire floor
to the merchandise.

1081
01:15:35,716 --> 01:15:39,886
You'll have to go there in person
"to sign the bill of sale, by the way. "

1082
01:15:42,055 --> 01:15:46,351
We don't know yet whether we'll
be able to retain the castle.

1083
01:15:46,476 --> 01:15:48,478
The land has some capital.

1084
01:15:48,603 --> 01:15:52,357
We might be able to keep it
on as an investment.

1085
01:15:52,482 --> 01:15:54,401
Maybe break it up into smaller units
for housing.

1086
01:15:57,070 --> 01:15:58,488
When will it come out?

1087
01:15:58,571 --> 01:16:01,574
"We can't keep it a secret, sir... "

1088
01:16:01,699 --> 01:16:04,786
once we announce the gimbel sale
and start liquidating the assets.

1089
01:16:13,794 --> 01:16:16,756
"Let it go, pops. "
Let it go.

1090
01:17:10,725 --> 01:17:13,436
"Mr. Hearst, i'm not sure"
if you remember who i am.

1091
01:17:13,561 --> 01:17:15,563
My name's orson welles.
I know who you are.

1092
01:17:19,817 --> 01:17:24,738
Then you probably also know that i've
got a picture opening tomorrow night.

1093
01:17:24,864 --> 01:17:27,866
Be happy to arrange some tickets
"for you, if you'd like to come. "

1094
01:17:36,917 --> 01:17:42,005
I wonder... have you any idea
the damage you've done?

1095
01:17:45,967 --> 01:17:46,885
Do you?

1096
01:17:47,803 --> 01:17:49,596
Intimately.

1097
01:17:49,721 --> 01:17:52,140
For every sin
you've placed on my head...

1098
01:17:52,223 --> 01:17:54,476
i could give you
a hundred others.

1099
01:17:55,518 --> 01:17:58,897
But i believe a man's private life
should not be made public property.

1100
01:17:59,022 --> 01:18:01,774
Despite what you may have read
in your papers...

1101
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:05,737
i'd like to think that my film was more
than a cheap expose of one man's life.

1102
01:18:06,863 --> 01:18:09,490
And what would you call it?

1103
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:14,495
My man gains the world
and loses his soul.

1104
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:18,916
"I suppose, in some circles, that would"
be considered a fair exchange.

1105
01:18:24,755 --> 01:18:28,550
It's not my life you sabotaged
"with your film, mr. Welles. "

1106
01:18:29,677 --> 01:18:32,554
My battle with the world
is almost over.

1107
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:36,725
"Yours, i'm afraid,"
has just begun.

1108
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:43,607
"Good luck, mr. Welles. "

1109
01:18:52,115 --> 01:18:54,659
Kane would've taken the tickets.

1110
01:19:22,937 --> 01:19:27,525
It's my birthday this week.
"Do you know that, george? Twentysix. "

1111
01:19:27,733 --> 01:19:29,652
Happy birthday.
Ain't it the bee's knees...

1112
01:19:29,735 --> 01:19:34,198
to see all the high muckety-mucks dolled
up like aztecs for human sacrifice?

1113
01:19:34,323 --> 01:19:38,160
You gonna watch?
I know how it ends. Rosebud's the sled

1114
01:19:38,285 --> 01:19:40,996
mank.
Rosebud's the sled.

1115
01:19:41,121 --> 01:19:43,123
Come on. It doesn't matter.
They'll hate it anyway.

1116
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:46,668
"Not enough close-ups,"
too many new york actors.

1117
01:19:46,752 --> 01:19:50,213
"Knock it off, mank. "
"Relax, kid. You made a great picture. "

1118
01:19:54,175 --> 01:19:56,886
Now we have to convince them.

1119
01:19:57,012 --> 01:19:59,222
"So, does this mean you're in"
for the life of christ?

1120
01:20:00,014 --> 01:20:01,808
I got the ax this morning.

1121
01:20:03,101 --> 01:20:03,852
"Oh, you're kidding?"

1122
01:20:03,977 --> 01:20:08,648
It's all right.
"I made my choices, same as you. "

1123
01:20:08,815 --> 01:20:12,068
This whole hearst nightmare

1124
01:20:12,193 --> 01:20:14,737
who's gonna remember it?
Nobody.

1125
01:20:16,656 --> 01:20:18,324
We'll be lucky if they remember
the goddamn movie.

1126
01:20:25,664 --> 01:20:27,625
What have i done?
Come on.

1127
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:30,669
He'll land on his feet.
He always does.

1128
01:20:30,753 --> 01:20:32,671
Let's get a drink.

1129
01:20:47,894 --> 01:20:50,856
"We pulled it off,"
"didn't we, mank?"

1130
01:20:50,939 --> 01:20:53,358
Depends on what side you're on.

1131
01:20:57,696 --> 01:20:59,155
"Look, mank, i never meant to... "

1132
01:21:01,032 --> 01:21:05,870
sure you did.
"Anyway, was it worth it?"

1133
01:21:07,705 --> 01:21:08,164
I don't know.

1134
01:21:09,916 --> 01:21:12,752
I can't imagine doing it
any other way.

1135
01:21:12,835 --> 01:21:16,339
I suppose
it's just my character.

1136
01:21:16,714 --> 01:21:19,884
"It won't be easy,"
having made your masterpiece at 26

1137
01:21:21,177 --> 01:21:23,262
is that what you think?

1138
01:21:23,387 --> 01:21:28,142
That i'm just gonna burn out
at the ripe old age of 26?

1139
01:21:29,977 --> 01:21:33,731
"All stars burn out, orson. "
It's the flame that counts.

1140
01:21:40,946 --> 01:21:44,032
To the flame
to the flame
