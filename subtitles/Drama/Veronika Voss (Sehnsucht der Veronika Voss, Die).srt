1
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,258
Well, let's see.

2
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:07,191
After you decide that I'm depressed or
whatever, you'll throw me a med, right?

3
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,704
And I know, hundreds of people
who swallow them,

4
00:01:10,705 --> 00:01:13,304
they're all doing
just fine, really.

5
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:20,072
I go back to work and take
my new antidepressants.

6
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:23,682
Have dinner with my parents, persuade
them that I'm back to being normal...

7
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,251
and it never gives
me in any trouble.

8
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:38,619
Then one day,
some man ask me to marry him.

9
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:44,930
He'd be nice enough and that'll
make my parents very happy.

10
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:56,006
The first year we make
love all the time.

11
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,614
Then the second and third
less and less.

12
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:06,118
But, just as we're getting sick
of each other, I'll be pregnant.

13
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,431
Taking care of kids,
working on the jobs, paying mortgages...

14
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,225
that'll keep us on even keel
for a while.

15
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:21,306
And then, ten years into it,
he'll have an affair...

16
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,808
because I'm... too busy
and I'm too tired.

17
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,307
And when I find out...

18
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:35,478
I'd like to kill him...
his mistress... myself.

19
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,449
We'll get passed it.

20
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,988
In a few years,
he going to have another one.

21
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,931
And this time, I just pretend
that I don't know, because...

22
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:49,558
somehow giving in to fast just doesn't
seem worth the trouble this time.

23
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,967
And you know, I'm happy
at least a few days.

24
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,937
Sometimes, wishing my kids
could have the life that I never had.

25
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:03,442
Other times... secretly pleased
their trying to be duplicates of me.

26
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:12,052
I'm fine... really.

27
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,481
Green is not the new black.

28
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,978
Hasn't anyone else noticed that
everyone has gone completely insane?

29
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:05,624
Why is everyone so afraid
to look at things as they really are?

30
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,427
Slogans like these have succeeded
in distracting...

31
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:13,231
all the things that really matter.
There's no other escape.

32
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,934
I want people to know I believe
in killing myself rather than to join...

33
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:20,767
this collective madness
in the world we all live in.

34
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,969
This is not the real world.

35
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,641
Goodbye,
Veronika Deklave.

36
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,876
Call 911!

37
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,723
Audrey, call 911!

38
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,656
The syringe is going in.

39
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,892
- Pressure is 100 over 60.
- I need for you to back up.

40
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,898
Pressure is down
to 80 over 40.

41
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,398
Bring her inside.

42
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,466
Move her
into intensive care.

43
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,792
Could you please
send in my 9:15.

44
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,124
Edward!

45
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,844
Come on now, Edward.

46
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:22,042
I wanted to let you know that your fathers
annual visit is scheduled for next week.

47
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:30,310
He will ask then
if you've made any progress.

48
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,184
Have you made any progress, Edward?

49
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,797
You know Villette, works for the great
majority of people who come here.

50
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:51,810
The last few times your father visited,
I suggested to bring you home...

51
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,302
but...

52
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:59,649
well... I'm certain he believes
you being here, is for the best.

53
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,383
What'd you think of that, Edward?

54
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,660
Nurse!

55
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:01,512
Relax. We're going to take
good care of you.

56
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,848
Take it easy.

57
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:10,848
Here we are.

58
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,747
Veronika?

59
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,991
You were in coma
and in intensive care, for 2 weeks...

60
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,753
before being well enough
to be with us here.

61
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,794
Where am I?

62
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,695
Villette.

63
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,627
Villette?

64
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:04,676
A privately funded psychiatric
facility on the Hudson River.

65
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,546
Our director, Dr. Blake has taken
special interest in your case.

66
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,171
You're psychiatrists!

67
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,149
Why am I here?
Who brought me here?

68
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,313
Your parents approved it.

69
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,887
Veronika, can I ask you
a few questions?

70
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,761
Your date of birth?

71
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,766
December 24, 2000...

72
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,982
Um...

73
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:37,073
19... 81.

74
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,501
Your address?

75
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,482
Your place of employment?

76
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,986
Freeman and Stanley.

77
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,889
Your position?

78
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,598
Assistant Account Executive.
Seventy-five thousand a year...

79
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,463
plus additional
health benefits included.

80
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,671
The colour of your mothers' hair?

81
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,944
I don't remember.

82
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,316
The colour of my hair?

83
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:29,952
Blond.

84
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,489
Are you sure?

85
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:42,073
"Deklava" is Slovenian?
Your parents are from...

86
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,268
My parents left
before I was born.

87
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,009
We get along just fine,
if that's what you're wondering.

88
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,477
Look, how long
do I have to stay here?

89
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,546
Unfortunately...

90
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,658
we have some difficult news...
in that regard.

91
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,124
Somebody want to tell me
what's going on?

92
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,008
That's yours.

93
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:20,908
Oh...

94
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:30,480
We're ready to begin, when you took
the overdose, your heart stopped.

95
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:35,519
And the infarct of a heart attack,
which caused a ventricular aneurysm.

96
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:39,614
In layman's terms,
you've damaged the mechanism...

97
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:44,167
that pumps blood into the heart, which
has caused irreversible damage to it.

98
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:50,369
Your heart attack produced a scar,
which in time became an aneurysm.

99
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:55,609
I'm afraid the aneurysm is so large,
it's... inoperable.

100
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:01,818
It will get bigger and bigger
every day, until it finally ruptures.

101
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,160
So, I'm going to die after all?

102
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,995
I'm afraid so.

103
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:26,573
Well, how long do I have?
A year... years?

104
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,610
Exact estimates are impossible.
Not years.

105
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:38,817
Okay. So, six months?
Five months, four months?

106
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,824
It could be any time, um...

107
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:48,262
It may only be
a matter of weeks... at most.

108
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,526
I have to wait that long?

109
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,664
Well...

110
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,637
If I succeeded,
why don't you just kill me now?

111
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,681
It might be
too much for you to take in.

112
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,874
Yes.

113
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,313
I think we've said
enough for now.

114
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,724
We think this is
the best place for you.

115
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,040
We'll be giving you
regular shots in your heart,

116
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,419
which may make you feel
that you're tired.

117
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:23,698
But we'll do everything we can
to make your last days here as...

118
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:26,066
pleasant as possible.

119
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,401
Do my parents know?

120
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,108
No. Not yet.

121
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,238
Will you tell 'em?

122
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,311
I think we said
enough for now.

123
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,592
Natasha, would you... please?

124
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,160
Yes, doctor.

125
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,079
Eight hundred sixty.
Eight hundred and sixty.

126
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,115
Eight hundred sixty-two.
Eight hundred sixty-three.

127
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,651
Eight hundred sixty-four.
Eight hundred sixty-five.

128
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,288
There you are!

129
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,751
Better?

130
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:05,087
I'm your new roommate, Claire.

131
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,638
This place isn't so bad, you know.

132
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,107
They have really good drugs.

133
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,087
I'm leaving any day now.

134
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,521
But not before I have more round
of my coma treatment.

135
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,225
You're really pretty.

136
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,451
I'm going to tell you a trick
of this place.

137
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,656
It's a story.

138
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,563
Once, upon a time...

139
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:22,206
there was a powerful wizard
who wanted to destroy a whole kingdom.

140
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,607
And to do this...

141
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:28,412
he poured a magic potion into the well
from which all the citizens drank.

142
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,515
Everyone who tasted it
would go mad.

143
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:35,953
And the King... when he saw
his people so changed...

144
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,385
he was terrified.

145
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,258
He was preparing
to leave the city...

146
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:44,794
but the Queen stopped him,
saying:

147
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:50,794
"Let us drink from the well,
we'll be the same as they are".

148
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:56,907
And so, they drank from
the communal well of madness...

149
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:01,137
and they were immediately
as insane as their subjects.

150
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:06,984
And so, the King was allowed
to continue ruling in peace...

151
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,246
the rest of his days.

152
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,383
So...

153
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:20,164
learn to think like those
around you think...

154
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:23,233
and you can pass
yourself of with anything.

155
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:27,832
You think outsiders
are any less crazy then we are?

156
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,665
I'm not crazy.

157
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,171
Are you really going to die?

158
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,839
Who told you that?

159
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,485
Oh, you know,
you talk... talk... talk...

160
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,917
Blah... blah... talk... talk.

161
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,050
I don't want to wait.

162
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,422
Do you know how
to get my hands on something?

163
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,929
Really?

164
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,602
Come have a smoke with me.

165
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:05,771
No thanks.

166
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:11,474
Oh, come on... get dressed. You don't
want them to think you're crazy.

167
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,000
Do you want to go
outside with me, Ed?

168
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:53,320
Ask Mari, she'll tell you
how you can get pills.

169
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:57,119
She's been here longest
out of all the patients.

170
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,267
Her clique
has the best in here.

171
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:06,359
They don't take their medications,
unless they feel like it.

172
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:10,674
She was a lawyer on the outside,
and she was married to one too.

173
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:15,575
But when she lost her job, she had
a break-down and she ended up here.

174
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,874
Her marriage is over too.

175
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,885
And she's really close
to Dr. Blake.

176
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,680
You think she'll help me?

177
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,487
I don't know.

178
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:30,220
If she doesn't want to talk to you,
she won’t.

179
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,640
What about him?

180
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,312
Ed. I know...

181
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:52,542
He's gorgeous... but you can't
actually talk to him.

182
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:56,280
Mari has a way with him,
no one else does.

183
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:01,156
He was dumped here
a few years ago.

184
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:03,321
Years?

185
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,556
That's what happened.

186
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,934
He was in an accident, and against the
time he was ever since...

187
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,025
he stopped talking.

188
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:17,264
His girlfriend was in the car
with him, she died instantly.

189
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,903
He thinks he killed her.

190
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,913
What do they say
is wrong with him?

191
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,649
Oh God, it changes all the time.

192
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,552
Catatony, Schizo,
all these names.

193
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:32,782
It's no use getting interested in him,
he doesn't care about anybody.

194
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,752
I'm not interested
in anyone right now.

195
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,355
Not even me?

196
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,900
I'm freezing.

197
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,676
Hey! Hey, do you know
what astral travel is?

198
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:56,981
I use it in my coma treatment. I have the
Moon was still not achieved, but I do.

199
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,983
!I have my last treatments
the next few days.

200
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:02,018
You can take all you want.

201
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,195
How are you?

202
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,211
Your parents
are waiting outside.

203
00:27:28,484 --> 00:27:30,106
No!

204
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:34,876
I can't see them!

205
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,112
I won't see them!

206
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,221
But they want to see you.
They've come all this way.

207
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,929
Did you tell 'em?

208
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,421
No.

209
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,132
No, you told me not to.

210
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,302
I thought,
I leave it up to you.

211
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,071
How can I tell 'em?

212
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,108
I think you should see them.

213
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:23,327
Someone please send in,
Mr. and Mrs. Deklava.

214
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:41,279
Veronika always had good grades
and... made friends with nice people.

215
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,814
Always had good paying jobs.

216
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:50,157
Never had a speck
of trouble with her. Never.

217
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,519
She...

218
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:58,224
You always made us...
very proud.

219
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:06,874
Doctor, help to make her
get better, I mean...

220
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,804
back to normal.

221
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,344
He's a good doctor.

222
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,246
Well...
you see, first of all...

223
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,004
your daughter tried
to kill herself,

224
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:24,894
now that's nothing for you
to be ashamed of.

225
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:30,287
In our society, we feel we must
be happy, if we're not happy...

226
00:29:30,288 --> 00:29:33,301
we feel hopeless,
we feel like... failures.

227
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:42,479
The plan... is to talk
with Veronika, mainly.

228
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,978
Talk?

229
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,044
We have to go back...

230
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,013
Why would you listen?

231
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,509
Dad, how much you think they are
charging you for this place?

232
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,061
Oh, it's nothing. Forget it.

233
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:01,392
The most important thing
is your health now.

234
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,036
Of course it would be better
if you stayed home with us...

235
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:07,137
- and rest with us, but...
- Sometimes,

236
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:11,104
being away from everyone,
even loved ones,

237
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,567
will help people
to get calm.

238
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:19,080
This... this place...
is worth it.

239
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,854
I even noticed on the way here,
they have a nice piano.

240
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,392
You play piano?

241
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:29,560
No.

242
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:34,064
- Oh yes, Doctor, she...
- She used to play lovely...

243
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:37,634
- Mozart... Bach...
- Oh, yeah.

244
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:38,936
Debussy.

245
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,004
Every teacher said
she has a gift.

246
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,768
It doesn't matter, I don't play
any more. It's nothing.

247
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,327
Well, she even had a scholarship...

248
00:30:47,328 --> 00:30:49,897
- from the Juilliard.
- Oh, yeah...

249
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:53,450
But we really expected her to go
to a bigger school, so that she...

250
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:57,487
So, she would never have to... uh,
be lacking for a good-paying job.

251
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,791
Could... could we not have
this conversation, please?

252
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,793
We just want you to be happy.

253
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:05,055
Could we just not.

254
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,498
I'm sorry.

255
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:12,660
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay.

256
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,302
Sorry.

257
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,905
Veronika.

258
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:31,777
There's nothing else you want to say,
while your parents are still here?

259
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:41,895
Are you sure?

260
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,340
Well, it's a long drive
back to Brooklyn...

261
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:53,236
if you want to beat
the rush-hour traffic.

262
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,808
Yeah, I guess.

263
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:04,950
Getting back to Brooklyn
at this hour, could be... horrible.

264
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,575
Listen.

265
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,588
When Dr. Blake says
it's okay...

266
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,552
you come home.

267
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:48,354
Then you'll spend
some time with us, okay?

268
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,717
- Thank you.
- Good bye.

269
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,285
See you soon.
Take care.

270
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,727
Is this it?

271
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,072
There she is.

272
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,479
You gave us a startle, young lady.

273
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:20,189
We're going to try adjusting
the dosage on your medication.

274
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:31,194
We wouldn't even be involved,
if she'd succeeded.

275
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:35,625
But fortunately she didn't, okay?
We're talking about a woman’s life.

276
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:42,102
And jobs like this have always been taken
over by these Ad-Agency’s when you look...

277
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,934
None of you all
sell fruit-cake.

278
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:57,352
Honey, I'm a fruit-cake.

279
00:35:59,352 --> 00:36:03,052
They're dicing on all the publicity
around this and they're trying to...

280
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:07,531
Well?... Aren't you going to
react at all?

281
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:12,269
No. You won't be with us...
much longer...

282
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,666
anyhow.

283
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,426
Good thing about being
in a crazy hospital...

284
00:36:34,427 --> 00:36:36,726
so you can get away
with slapping Fred...

285
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,760
when he yells something.

286
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,559
- I was looking for you.
- Hm?

287
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,528
Claire said that you might...

288
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,694
Be somebody who can help you?

289
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,598
I need pills.

290
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,768
I want to die on my own terms.

291
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:07,490
When those two geniuses changing
shifts at the end of the day...

292
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:10,321
at dinner time, around 7...

293
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:13,855
that's when you come over
when the door's unlatched.

294
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,659
I don't understand.

295
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,762
The medicine closet.

296
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,056
How can you stand it here?

297
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,400
Edward!

298
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,506
Edward!

299
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,944
Edward, come on.
It's time for your treatment.

300
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,516
Come on.

301
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,743
Come on.

302
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,120
Edward, come on.

303
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,494
Dinnertime.

304
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,760
Dinnertime.

305
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,004
Come on, let's go.

306
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,285
George, this way.

307
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,691
Veronika! Get out there!
You better not. No!

308
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,123
Spit it out, spit it out, spit it out.
All of it, all of it!

309
00:39:57,124 --> 00:39:59,529
Come on! Spit it out!
All of it, all of it.

310
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,799
Come on. All of it!
All of it! All of it!

311
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,027
Is that all? Let me see.

312
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:10,223
Come on, look at me.
Look at me, great. Come on.

313
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:12,268
Let's get her to Dr. Blake.

314
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:24,754
So you really thought, it would be
that easy to steal some pills?

315
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,344
You're shit.

316
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:29,159
Because I won't cooperate
in you killing yourself?

317
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,990
Because you love playing
with peoples mind.

318
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,229
I hate you.

319
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:40,227
Really?
Tell me about it.

320
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:46,672
Fine. I hate your stupid desk...

321
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,612
and I hate your ugly tie.

322
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,408
And I hate your
ridicules socks.

323
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:56,352
And I hate everyone locked up in
this place, and I hate my parents...

324
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:59,622
for spending their very last penny
to keep me in this zoo.

325
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:03,560
God forbid, they should ever
for one moment, live their own life.

326
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:08,064
Is that what they come here for?
To be the fucking same as everybody else?

327
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,733
And I hate the jerks
in my office, who think...

328
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:12,802
the money they earn
makes them be "shit".

329
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,581
And more than anything,
I hate the zombies on the subway...

330
00:41:15,582 --> 00:41:17,841
who have forgotten
all of their dreams...

331
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:21,172
or the fact that
they ever had any to begin with!

332
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,375
I have some
terrifying news for you.

333
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,217
Don't really much care
for news.

334
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:36,182
You sound like you might be
feeling better.

335
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,118
Answer me honestly, please.

336
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,800
Doesn’t it feel better,
to feel better?

337
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:51,806
Have you ever heard the story
of the King and the poisoned well?

338
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:56,574
You mean...
Claire's absurd story?

339
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,007
Do you think she invented it?

340
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,541
Oh, I should've
guessed this one.

341
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,614
That's your brilliant take
on reality?

342
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:08,892
Well...

343
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,794
reality is what the majority
deem it to be.

344
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:13,897
Not necessarily the best,
or the most logical...

345
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:17,901
but the one that has become adopted
to the desirers of society as a whole.

346
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:21,638
Some things are governed by
common sense, and others become fixed...

347
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,274
until more and more people believe
that's the way it should be.

348
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:28,411
Like the QWERTY keyboard. Do you know...
do you know why... it's like that?

349
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,705
Haven't really had time
to give it much thought.

350
00:42:30,706 --> 00:42:31,948
Well...

351
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,651
when the typewriter
was first invented...

352
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:37,353
the letters were arranged
in alphabetical order.

353
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:41,457
Now, when a person typed
to quickly... keys became jammed.

354
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:45,695
So this man... uh, Schools,
he invented the QWERTY keyboard...

355
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:49,925
whereby people were obliged
to type... more... slowly.

356
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,329
And?

357
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,000
Well, it's...

358
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,307
it's a true story.

359
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,111
You're a bat-shit crazy,
you know that?

360
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,882
You sell those patients
on the optimistic belief...

361
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,451
that they're no different
than the people on the outside...

362
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,815
because they're
no different than you.

363
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:14,924
Well, I consider that a simple matter
of fact, only a truly crazy person...

364
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,925
would call it reassuring,
or optimistic.

365
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:23,266
Besides... aren't you the one
who accused fashion industry...

366
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:27,633
of posting pathological and
dehumanising values on our society?

367
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,970
Well, I was high
when I wrote that.

368
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,401
Then I take it,
an ad campaign...

369
00:43:35,402 --> 00:43:38,347
was not the real reason
you tried to kill yourself.

370
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,674
I had a point.

371
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,609
You almost laughed.

372
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,746
Another sign of improvement.

373
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:49,747
Go to hell!

374
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:38,714
She's beginning to experience
the reality of death...

375
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:41,315
is something
beyond her control.

376
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,717
Edward's noticed her.

377
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:47,981
Whatever that means
to Edward.

378
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:51,394
Have you grown so attached to your guild
about the fix you're in with Edward...

379
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:53,724
you can't see yourself
living without him?

380
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:57,867
Since you are so close to leaving,
you'd want to construct...

381
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:00,636
a happy ending for Edward
to match your own?

382
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:04,340
I don't think Edward being
interested in a suicidal girl...

383
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:07,439
with a few days to live,
is much of a happy ending.

384
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,312
Perhaps they are
if you're jealous.

385
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:11,614
You mean counter transference?

386
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,683
Just because it's a cliché,
doesn't mean it isn't true.

387
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:21,185
Anyway...
who says I'm ready to go?

388
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,836
In order to lose someone,
you must first experience...

389
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:36,234
authentic attachment.

390
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:40,743
Now if Edward could recover normal
affect to the point of being capable...

391
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:46,543
of general loss, I think I use that
as my finest hour as a doctor.

392
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:27,520
You're free to go.

393
00:51:50,612 --> 00:51:54,093
Yeah, a mystery.
Yeah, I know, really.

394
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,543
Okay Claire,
I'm going to swap you down.

395
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,344
Here we go.

396
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,488
- It's 100 over 80.
- Good.

397
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:12,953
- The numbers are all good.
- Very good.

398
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,588
Okay, stay still.

399
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,271
Goodbye.

400
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,405
100 over 80.

401
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:53,269
One of your patients,
Veronika Deklava...

402
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:55,771
is getting considering
media play...

403
00:52:55,772 --> 00:53:00,206
from some rather unfair things she said
about one of our advertising campaigns.

404
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:04,180
Of course our first and...
foremost concern is...

405
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,578
for the wellbeing
of the young lady.

406
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,905
Well, now, she is a patient
undergoing active treatment here...

407
00:53:09,906 --> 00:53:13,018
and the details of her condition
are confidential.

408
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:17,919
But she is recovered enough for a...
well wishing statement to pay our respect?

409
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,961
Look...

410
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:22,298
you want to put Veronika in
some sort of dog and pony show.

411
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,696
that's not going to happen.

412
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:27,803
We're under a great deal
of pressure over this matter...

413
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:29,672
as I'm sure you understand.

414
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:33,174
I'm sorry, she's not available
to be put on display.

415
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:37,346
We did some inquiries.

416
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:43,112
The State Board Health,
which gives you a license to operate.

417
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:48,357
Apparently three years ago
a patient died here...

418
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,357
of a drug overdose?

419
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:54,428
And the families of other patients
have complained about...

420
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:56,994
irregular methods of treatment.

421
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:00,903
What the families of patients
complain about by enlarge...

422
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:04,696
is that not every mentally ill
person can be cured.

423
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:08,436
Now, what is it exactly
you want from me?

424
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:12,775
You have very...
unorthodox methods, Dr. Blake.

425
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,818
I can shine a spot-light...

426
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:19,183
on the unusual activity
that's taken place in here.

427
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:24,020
I have absolutely
nothing to hide.

428
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:42,038
Two hundred and seventy-four,
Two hundred and seventy-five...

429
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:45,447
Two hundred and seventy-six,
Two hundred and seventy-seven...

430
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,817
Two hundred and seventy-eight,
Two hundred and seventy-nine...

431
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:52,321
Two hundred and eighty,
Two hundred and eighty-one...

432
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:55,324
Two hundred and eighty-two,
Two hundred and eighty-three...

433
00:54:55,325 --> 00:55:00,362
Hey, Claire, honey, come on.
You haven't been released.

434
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:06,030
Okay, get your bags,
and go let's sit at the table.

435
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:14,339
Okay, I'll go get Dr. Thompson.
He'll come and talk to you, okay?

436
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:20,706
No, not now, Edward.

437
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,546
I... I don't feel
like playing.

438
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,958
You okay?

439
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:15,627
I'll get to the moon next time,
they didn't let me leave.

440
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:03,445
Are you OK?
You should be careful.

441
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,775
It doesn't really matter,
does it?

442
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:14,819
Hey, there is an expert in Sufi spiritual
teaching talking with us tonight.

443
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:19,994
Some people say Sufi spirituality
is beautiful... and helpful.

444
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:21,997
I'm one.

445
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:33,141
~Maybe you should take the time to
gather yourself if a hurry, you know.

446
01:00:00,974 --> 01:00:05,635
Ooohmm...

447
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:17,635
Insanity... is the inability
to communicate our ideas.

448
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:22,907
So, all of us...
are to one degree or another insane.

449
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:26,755
But don't confuse insanity
with the loss of control.

450
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:28,584
You have two choices:

451
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:33,954
To control your mind
or let your mind control you.

452
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,843
And allow the real "I"...

453
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:10,385
to revealed... itself.
The real "I" is... what you are...

454
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:13,887
not what others...
think of you.

455
01:06:54,313 --> 01:06:56,643
I...

456
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:59,943
I could fall in love with you,
right now.

457
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,919
And you can see me
won't see me again.

458
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,420
But that's okay.

459
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:39,380
It's very early.

460
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:42,048
I need to talk you.

461
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,544
I need your help.

462
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:48,988
You didn't have your injection
last night.

463
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:52,885
I know.
I'm feeling much better.

464
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:56,923
Well, you don't look it.

465
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:05,102
If you want to make the most of the time
you have left, you do as I say.

466
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:12,139
I don't want to.

467
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:17,251
And that's why I need to know exactly
how much time I have left.

468
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,681
I told you
I can't be sure.

469
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:26,527
Everything is happening
as I anticipated.

470
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:32,494
Dr. Blake, I need you
to do two things for me.

471
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:37,364
I need a shot or something
so I can stay awake.

472
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:39,871
I want to be conscious
of every moment.

473
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:44,242
What's the other thing?

474
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:48,641
I want to leave here.

475
01:09:49,949 --> 01:09:51,941
No... I don't know...

476
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:56,854
You can't just go. You're not well enough.
Besides you're under my care.

477
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:01,359
You're looking very pale.

478
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,754
I'm tired, that's all.

479
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:09,903
Look, if I have even a little time left,
there's so much I can do.

480
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:15,843
I want to go to the beach. I want to see
the ocean and I want to feel the sand.

481
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:19,743
I want to have a huge taco
at my favourite taco stand.

482
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:23,751
I want to walk into an Irish pub
and I want to order a Guinness.

483
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:25,614
I've never done that.

484
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:31,292
I want to see my mom, I want to
talk to her, really talk to her.

485
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:35,989
Look, get some rest and conserve
what little energy you have left.

486
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,732
Dr. Blake there's...

487
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:52,111
Last night...

488
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:56,007
I knew I had to live.

489
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:01,321
There's so much about myself
I don't know.

490
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:06,651
When desire comes, that's fear.

491
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:12,262
These days, most people replaced
almost all their emotions with fear.

492
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:17,469
And everyone has dreams, but only
a few realises them,

493
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:21,232
makes cowards of the rest of us.

494
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:25,045
Even if they feel their right?

495
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:28,277
Particularly then.

496
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:39,059
Veronika, go get some rest.
I have other patients to attend to.

497
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:47,768
If everyone would realise their dreams,
this place would be empty.

498
01:12:12,997 --> 01:12:14,734
Ha...

499
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:19,634
The Martians just send me a message
it's not a war anymore...

500
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:24,763
we must go forward and bring peace
to the Nations. That's what I'm doing!

501
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:28,576
You think I'm making this up?
This was reported on CNN!

502
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:31,577
You can hear their words as plain,
as the nose on your face!

503
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:58,773
I recall you're telling me
that Panic attacks aren't fatal...

504
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:01,001
even if they feel anything.

505
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,339
"Positive Compaction".

506
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:09,217
All that textbook stuff is
beginning to sound rather old.

507
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:11,185
Maybe it's time for you
to leave this place.

508
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:12,320
Oh, don't be silly.

509
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:15,556
I do actually help people here,
in case you haven't notice.

510
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:18,625
Helping people?
Like Veronika?

511
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:22,391
Edward's benefiting, isn't he?

512
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:26,300
Yes, but to get that benefit
you're torturing a dying woman...

513
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:30,271
making her recover her will to live
just means too late to do any good?

514
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:32,806
All in the name of research?

515
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:36,667
Well, it's not a perfect science.

516
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:42,075
Perhaps with everyone seems to me
to lie then say what it is.

517
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:47,902
And when will you finally drop those
tedious notions of right and wrong...

518
01:13:47,903 --> 01:13:50,520
you never really believed in
to begin with?

519
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:57,589
Or are you still a lawyer at heart
with fantasies about truth and justice?

520
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:03,571
Look, if Veronika can help Edward
by giving him the illusion...

521
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:05,473
he's helping her, through love...

522
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:09,043
then her life and dead would
not have been completely meaningless.

523
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:13,637
My god! Is that the only
consolation you can manage?

524
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:19,720
Anyway... I made
a few phone-calls...

525
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:23,779
I found a nice legal-aid office
on West End Avenue in Manhattan.

526
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:27,462
No Billionaire Corporate clients.
just needy defendants...

527
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,553
without a pot to piss in.

528
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:34,735
Down the block is a decent takeout deli,
I can bring my lunch to the park.

529
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:40,263
Who knows? Maybe I'll... call up
my ex-husband see how he's keeping.

530
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:45,270
Well, it sounds all very normal.

531
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,911
It's time I got away from you.

532
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:53,519
I mean... from here.

533
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:57,915
That's like I been saying,
for how many years is it now?

534
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,933
This is my office address.

535
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:09,401
I stay with my sister
until I can find a place.

536
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:12,105
I get you the number
when I have one.

537
01:15:13,142 --> 01:15:14,567
Thank you.

538
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:18,140
You can come sit with me
in the park one day.

539
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,480
If my schedule let's up, maybe.

540
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:26,911
You can't hide here
forever, Alex.

541
01:15:58,053 --> 01:15:59,410
Yeah?

542
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,056
Hey.

543
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:07,223
Want some help?

544
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:09,863
You can put
those clothes in there.

545
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,523
- Okay.
- Thanks.

546
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:23,001
You know,
I heard you last night...

547
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:26,706
playing the piano in a way
I've rarely heard before.

548
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:30,117
And I that you played
with so much soul...

549
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:32,743
because you know
you're going to die.

550
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:38,726
I thought... when I'm going to die,
where's my soul?

551
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:43,161
I lost it...

552
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,834
to my husband and a job
and a house...

553
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:49,164
and I never had the courage
to leave.

554
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:54,605
And now today,
I feel like I can.

555
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:02,413
I wasn't myself last night.

556
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:06,750
Only maybe,
I really was.

557
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:10,852
Nothing makes
any sense anymore.

558
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:16,197
Some people go their whole lives,
searching for one moment...

559
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:19,494
like the one you had...
never achieve it.

560
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:23,326
You got a thousand in you.

561
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:40,983
- Sorry, I...
- No, it's okay,

562
01:18:40,984 --> 01:18:42,283
it's time
for Edward his treatment.

563
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:46,320
You two can see each other later in
the playroom. So, what you working today?

564
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,958
Come on.
It's time for your treatment.

565
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:52,382
Come on.

566
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:48,646
I need to leave Villette.

567
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:55,321
Were you talking?

568
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,053
I want to leave.

569
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:11,001
Assistance, please. Northeast corridor.
Immediate assistance.

570
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:29,989
It's okay Ed,
it's okay.

571
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:32,785
Hey Eddie,
everything okay?

572
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,925
I need to talk to Dr. Blake.

573
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:38,665
Wow! You're talking up
a storm there, huh?

574
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:40,899
I want to go.

575
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:42,903
Why don't you take a few of these,
calm down a little bid.

576
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:44,801
Go here something very
of grand?

577
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:46,707
Don't touch me.

578
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:49,376
- Where's Blake?
- You got a hot appointment in the city?

579
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:52,046
Dr. Thompson, you need to get here
right the way.

580
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:54,114
You're just having a little crisis.

581
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:58,018
- Whoa! What's going on?
- He talked!

582
01:20:58,019 --> 01:21:01,144
Edward, that's wonderful!
Let's get him out the hallway, okay?

583
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:08,295
Everybody, just calm down.
Edward, let's get you to the room.

584
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:11,432
Relax!
Everybody calm down.

585
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:13,834
- Veronika!
- Keep your hands off him, okay?

586
01:21:13,835 --> 01:21:15,792
- Veronika!
- Keep your hands off of him.

587
01:21:15,793 --> 01:21:18,002
Get back, leave him alone.

588
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,571
You just spoke.

589
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:31,310
I believe that you just started
to become important to me.

590
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:36,023
- Ed, you need to come with me.
- Take him to emergency.

591
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,358
You need to go find Blake.

592
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:41,087
We do the treatment
as planned?

593
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,125
Wait!

594
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:48,627
I'm coming with you.

595
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:52,371
- I'm going with him.
- Go.

596
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,600
Go back to your rooms now.

597
01:23:38,515 --> 01:23:39,972
Hey.

598
01:23:57,995 --> 01:23:59,772
Hey.

599
01:24:04,606 --> 01:24:06,332
Are you back, huh?

600
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:17,144
You don't remember, do you?

601
01:24:36,971 --> 01:24:38,697
Veronika.

602
01:28:08,983 --> 01:28:10,572
How you feel?

603
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:13,548
Like I could live forever.

604
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:54,628
It's like you're a part of me now,
like you're inside of me.

605
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:59,101
You better
take good care of me.

606
01:33:04,512 --> 01:33:06,413
It's too cold for you
to be out here.

607
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:10,177
No, I like to see the sunrise.

608
01:33:10,914 --> 01:33:13,077
Okay?

609
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:34,574
If you close the door...

610
01:33:34,575 --> 01:33:38,178
the night
could last forever.

611
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:41,714
And no sun shining in.

612
01:33:42,183 --> 01:33:45,952
and say hello to never.

613
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:49,923
All the people are dancing
and they're having so much fun.

614
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:53,425
I wish it would happen to me.

615
01:33:53,761 --> 01:33:57,262
If you close the door...

616
01:33:58,065 --> 01:34:01,361
the night
could last forever.

617
01:34:01,902 --> 01:34:03,764
I'll get the wine...

618
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:09,538
we shall toast to never.

619
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:11,978
But, sometimes, I know.

620
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:15,946
Your eyes,
say hello.

621
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:19,447
You're a very special girl.

622
01:34:19,587 --> 01:34:23,782
But if you close the door...

623
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:27,025
I'll never have to see
the day again.

624
01:34:34,969 --> 01:34:36,463
Veronika?

625
01:34:37,238 --> 01:34:38,697
Veronika?

626
01:34:41,175 --> 01:34:42,637
No!

627
01:34:57,591 --> 01:35:00,819
Dr. Thompson.
Greetings.

628
01:35:03,297 --> 01:35:07,492
This office and Villette
are now in your care.

629
01:35:12,673 --> 01:35:16,606
I hope you will conduct yourself wisely,
as I have tried to do.

630
01:35:20,214 --> 01:35:24,580
I want to bring you up to speed with
a few things, clear up a few matters.

631
01:35:36,764 --> 01:35:40,366
In a few more days,
I've anticipated telling Veronika...

632
01:35:40,367 --> 01:35:43,670
that our injections
had cured her heart condition.

633
01:35:43,671 --> 01:35:47,474
But in light of her unscheduled
departure from Villette...

634
01:35:47,475 --> 01:35:51,135
my telling her a particular lie
will not be required.

635
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:57,147
The majority of people
who attempt suicide...

636
01:35:57,148 --> 01:36:00,647
repeat that attempt
until they succeed.

637
01:36:02,189 --> 01:36:05,849
I took a risk in lying to her
about her condition.

638
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:10,519
I decided to test the only remedy
I've come to have any faith in.

639
01:36:14,101 --> 01:36:16,396
Awareness of life.

640
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:21,202
Hey, look.

641
01:36:22,743 --> 01:36:24,173
We made it.

642
01:36:30,886 --> 01:36:32,185
We did.

643
01:36:32,186 --> 01:36:36,556
Until she finds out from some doctor
that she's perfectly healthy...

644
01:36:36,557 --> 01:36:39,853
She'll consider each day
a miracle.

645
01:36:40,261 --> 01:36:43,753
Which, in my view, it is.
