00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,975
Episode 21

2
00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:04,482
My dish is fish soup.

3
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:06,445
Amy, is it yours?

4
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:07,799
It's mine.

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,278

6
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:11,685
you have to give me a reward.

7
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:13,118

8
00:00:13,118 --> 00:00:15,550
Chris is planning on
retiring from cooking.

9
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,411
I've turned my cooking into
something that can hurt people.

10
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:22,178

11
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:23,547

12
00:00:23,547 --> 00:00:26,010

13
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,047

14
00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:28,600

15
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,925

16
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:31,045
Why are you being so mean?

17
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:34,326

18
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,990

19
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,338

20
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:38,500
We're going to lose.

21
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,570

22
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,137

23
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:47,506

24
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,317
I cannot assess Si Ping's dish.

25
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:51,493
I added Chinese pepper, which you hate.

26
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:53,189

27
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,338

28
00:00:57,338 --> 00:00:59,637
Shi Wen High!

29
00:00:59,637 --> 00:01:02,168
Although I didn't win this
competition with glory

30
00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:03,799
but if I don't have a choice

31
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,009

32
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:08,058
Your competition's professionalism
has nothing to do with me anyway.

33
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,694
We certainly neglected
some factors in our scoring.

34
00:01:10,694 --> 00:01:12,873
The winning team of this
competition should be...

35
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,409
Si Ping.

37
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,699

38
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:53,090

39
00:02:53,745 --> 00:02:56,158
Spit out the seeds from our friendship?

40
00:02:56,158 --> 00:02:59,263
Just remove the seeds.

41
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,364
Remove them...
That makes "girlfriend"?

42
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:04,306
Girlfriend?

43
00:03:04,307 --> 00:03:05,997
Hold it!

44
00:03:05,997 --> 00:03:07,752
Don't say it out so loudly!

45
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:11,116
If Ma Chong Sheng and the guys hear you,
it will be so embarrassing.

46
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:21,405
If it's Liu Xuan standing here today

47
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:23,516
you wouldn't be embarrassed.

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,882
Wang Mai Zhi, thanks for
taking care of me.

49
00:03:27,882 --> 00:03:30,959
But I don't wish to make you
embarrassed anymore.

50
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,269
We'll just stay classmates.

51
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:35,901
You... Wait a minute!

52
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:39,275
I didn't mean to say that
you embarrass me.

53
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:43,286
So you mean that being
with me is embarrassing?

54
00:03:43,286 --> 00:03:45,483
It's not that.

55
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:48,408
I'm just worried that our
classmates might gossip.

56
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:49,604
What about?

57
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,658
Gossip about...

58
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:54,058
About some...

59
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:57,560
I'm heading home now. Goodbye!

60
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,979
Weirdo Zhen!

61
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:04,901
What was I talking about?

62
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,151
Meng Chen! Slow down!

63
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:14,599
Why are you running off?

64
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,115
We're going to have pizza to celebrate.

65
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:19,615
Don't bother. I don't want to have pizza.

66
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,300
Come with us.

67
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,317
It's better to have pizza
with a group of people.

68
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:26,326
I'm not shameless like you.
I know that everyone dislikes me!

69
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:30,560
Why don't you just apologize
to everyone and it'll be fine?

70
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,021
Why should I apologize?

71
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,540
You went a bit overboard today.

72
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,002
We all worked so hard.

73
00:04:36,002 --> 00:04:38,672
- You shouldn't have scolded us...
- I don't need to be preached.

74
00:04:38,672 --> 00:04:40,083
Go away! I'm going home.

75
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,110
- I'll walk you home?
- No!

76
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,154
I must!

77
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:44,930
Otherwise, you might ignore me tomorrow.

78
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,824
So what if I do?

79
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:48,199
You have so many close classmates.

80
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,810
It's best that all of you ignore me!

81
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:52,387
Meng Chen!

82
00:04:56,615 --> 00:04:57,879
What are you doing?

83
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:06,836
Behave yourself.

84
00:05:06,836 --> 00:05:08,946
You really think that I won't smack you?

85
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:11,420
Han Jie, do you have to be so adorable?

86
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,533
All right then.

87
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:14,634
Since you won't let me near Fang Xia Rou

88
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:16,959
I'll have to give all my love to you.

89
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,975
What are you doing? Hey!

90
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,627
What are you doing?

91
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:23,646
- Give me a wet tissue.
- Here.

92
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:26,699
- And the hand sanitizer.
- Hey! Am I that filthy?

93
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,081
Here, I'll wipe it off for you.

94
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:29,089
Here?

95
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:31,110
He gave you such a wet kiss?

96
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,293
Fine, you're showing off
your affection that much?

97
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:35,161
Are you trying to piss this bachelor off?

98
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:39,202
I'm sorry. We didn't mean to show
off our affection on purpose.

99
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:41,709
We're always like this in our daily life.

100
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,160
Right?

101
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:47,523
All right, since you said so

102
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:49,858
I'll tell you the truth
about something else.

103
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:56,045
Xiao Rou, aren't you
going to tell Han Jie?

104
00:05:56,891 --> 00:06:01,379
Yesterday, you left this little under...

105
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:05,132
Hold it! I don't care what
you have in your hand.

106
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,625
It has nothing to do with me.

107
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:08,401
Han Jie, I didn't go
to his place yesterday.

108
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,665
You have to trust me.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,632
All right! This isn't hers.

110
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:16,107
This belongs to my cute pet.

111
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,934
Han Jie, would you like
to meet my cute pet?

112
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:21,651
Your cute pet?

113
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:33,278
Here...

114
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:37,310
It's a baby!

115
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:39,564
You have a child?

116
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:42,165
Exactly. I'm not as slow as you are.

117
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:46,649
In this aspect, you're way behind me.

118
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:50,512
Am I right, darling? Laugh at him!

119
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:52,904
You'll need to make more effort.

120
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:54,622
What's good in just
displaying public affection?

121
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:58,035
If you can, why don't you work
harder and catch up to me?

122
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:04,519
Han Jie, take care.

123
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:07,473
This new dad is off to pursue my dreams.

124
00:07:07,473 --> 00:07:09,425
I'll leave Taiwan to you.

125
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:12,050
We'll are out to challenge the world.

126
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,922
My darling and I are off
to tour the world.

127
00:07:15,922 --> 00:07:17,692
Don't miss me too much.

128
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:19,901
Who will miss you?

129
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:20,935
Get going!

130
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:24,336
I know that Uncle Han Jie
likes my bum the most.

131
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:36,442
You mustn't forget me.

132
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:39,721
I'll add you to my Facebook friends
and like your page!

133
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,889
It's a deal!

134
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,557
I love you! Bye!

135
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:47,211
Bye.

136
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:54,956
Why would you add him to your Facebook?

137
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:56,963
You never liked my posts.

138
00:07:56,963 --> 00:07:59,447
We know each other so well.

139
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,254
- Why should I like your posts?
- How well?

140
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:02,951
I was even teased for
displaying affection.

141
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:04,290
What now?

142
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,709
What about that?

143
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:07,245
We have to catch up with him.

144
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:10,338
Why don't we make a schedule?

145
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:11,970
What schedule?

146
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,601
I don't know what
you're talking about?

147
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:15,766
The students are waiting for me.
I have to go.

148
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,148
If you have no objections, here I come?

149
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:21,985
I mustn't lose to that guy.

150
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:24,435
What is it with you both?
Do you have to compete about that?

151
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,024
You're so competitive!

152
00:08:39,993 --> 00:08:43,457
The contest finally ended so well.

153
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,157
I hope that when we meet Chris again

154
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:48,246
you can be friends.

155
00:08:48,246 --> 00:08:50,081
Stop competing about everything.

156
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:51,950
We're competitors and enemies.

157
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,836
Who told you that we're friends?

158
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:56,268
Are you kidding me?

159
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:59,456
I only treated him as a friend
because of you.

160
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,760
If not, I'd have thrown a fit.

161
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,976
Really?

162
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,187
You seem so easily bullied.

163
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:07,645
Show me your angry face.

164
00:09:09,293 --> 00:09:11,568
Han Jie, you'd better watch it.

165
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,717
You don't seem fierce at all.
You're still so cute.

166
00:09:16,986 --> 00:09:18,020
Forget it.

167
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,333
Chris is off to tour the world anyway.

168
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,682
Would someone suddenly
hop out to scare me again?

169
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,899
One trouble is solved, but there's
another left to be resolved.

170
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:30,842
What is it?

171
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:33,636
You saw how the contest went.

172
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:35,269
I'm worried about them.

173
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:39,421
Then what do you plan to do?

174
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:44,155
The result of the contest won't ever
be as important as the process.

175
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:46,139
That's why I have to take some measures.

176
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:48,177
It might be a bit risky

177
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:50,129
and it might affect the final outcome

178
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,899
but I have to do it.

179
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:54,100
You'll support my decision?

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,273
Of course!

181
00:09:56,273 --> 00:09:58,474
I'll surely support any
decision that you make.

182
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:01,261
I haven't even said what I'm planing
and you're giving me your support?

183
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:04,398
- Isn't that being a bit blind?
- Blind?

184
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:06,299
I'm like a parasite in your stomach.

185
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:08,216
I already know what you have in mind.

186
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:12,013
It's just that it's indeed a bit risky.

187
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:14,875
It might also affect
the outcome of the contest.

188
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,279
You're so sharp?

189
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,793
You read my mind.

190
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:20,888
Why don't you read my mind now?

191
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,361
You've had a hard day. Go to bed early.

192
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:32,994
You're not to dream of me.

193
00:10:32,994 --> 00:10:35,200
Why can't I dream of you?

194
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,769
You overthink so easily.

195
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,509
What should I do if you speed up
on our relationship in your dreams?

196
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:40,985
Who would have such dreams?

197
00:10:40,985 --> 00:10:43,245
You're so annoying.
I'm getting out of the car.

198
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,565
I've installed a new mechanism.

199
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:54,893
You can only get out of my car
after doing this.

200
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:56,518
You can get out of the car now.

201
00:10:56,518 --> 00:10:58,504
You're so annoying. I'm off.

202
00:10:58,504 --> 00:10:59,792
- Bye.
- Bye.

203
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,010
Han Jie, if that student is upset

204
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,823
can you leave her to me?

205
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,461
I'm not worried at all with you around.

206
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,264
Bye.

207
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:39,971
Ma Chong Sheng.

208
00:11:40,754 --> 00:11:43,484
Do you know why
we got called here so early?

209
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:45,532
It should be about
preparing ahead of time

210
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:47,399
and training for the semi-final?

211
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,839
We're competing tomorrow.

212
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:50,801
Are we still in time for extra training?

213
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:54,053
We aren't.

214
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:57,520
With your standard, it's useless even
if we train three more months.

215
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,168
It's also too late to ask around
about the competitor now?

216
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:04,794
Shi Wen High School used to gather
all the competitors' information

217
00:12:04,794 --> 00:12:06,501
three months before the contest.

218
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,000
What's the use of having information?

219
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,620
They still lost yesterday.

220
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,653
What's there to be happy about?

221
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:18,147
I heard that a lot of schools
improved a lot this year.

222
00:12:18,147 --> 00:12:19,500
So?

223
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,080
We're definitely going to lose?

224
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,822
You want to lose

225
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:24,495
but I don't want to.

226
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:29,008
Mr. Han is arriving soon.

227
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:30,696
It's not good for him to see us fight.

228
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:31,933
Who wants to argue with her?

229
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:34,942
- If she shuts up, we will.
- Exactly.

230
00:12:34,942 --> 00:12:36,296
What have I done wrong?

231
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:39,008
I might even have a better idea
than our teachers

232
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,850
about which schools are tougher.

233
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,000
Shi Wen High School has been
the champion for years.

234
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,240
But their instructor's strategy
means everything.

235
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,735
The students just follow orders
without ideas of their own.

236
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:51,125
- But Qiang Ren and Yong Sheng--
- Will that help?

237
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,589
That's just aiming to strike
at others' weaknesses

238
00:12:57,589 --> 00:12:59,562
but it won't fortify your strengths.

239
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:01,150
Mr. Han. Ms. Fang.

240
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,654
What should we do then?

241
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:07,081
The point of having a contest is to
have the students work as a team.

242
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:09,750
You're all training to work as cooks.

243
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,703
You'll need your teammates
to work with you and help you.

244
00:13:12,703 --> 00:13:14,703
Only then could you run a restaurant.

245
00:13:14,703 --> 00:13:17,177
We might have won yesterday

246
00:13:17,177 --> 00:13:20,623
but sadly, a regrettable
incident occurred.

247
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:24,388
Ms. Fang and I have decided
to replace a contestant.

248
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,345
Chen Meng Chen, I'm very sorry.

249
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,714
I have to ask you to leave.

250
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:36,956
Your performance affected
my team greatly.

251
00:13:36,956 --> 00:13:40,741
Sir, how do we compete
with one less member?

252
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:42,065
I'd also like to know

253
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:44,426
who is capable enough to replace me?

254
00:13:44,426 --> 00:13:48,799
Don't worry, I've already asked
Kong Meng Zhe, Wei Qi Zhen

255
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,542
and Amy Fan to attend a test.

256
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,173
I've already selected the replacement.

257
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:54,469
Come in!

258
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:05,572
Weirdo Zhen!

259
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,880
I can't accept this!

260
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,278
Mr. Han, aren't you afraid that
this will affect the contest?

261
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:15,179
Wei Qi Zhen's skills are
too inferior to mine.

262
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:17,918
- Si Ping High School might lose!
- I'll take the responsibility.

263
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:20,822
Meng Chen, you may return
to the classroom now.

264
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:22,220
Bye.

265
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:51,139
Meng Chen.

266
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,222
Ms. Fang, what is it?

267
00:15:05,222 --> 00:15:07,484
I just wish to tell you

268
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:09,239
that if you feel wronged

269
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:12,705
you should work even harder
to make it back on the team.

270
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:14,934
How have I not worked hard enough?

271
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:18,048
My culinary skills are
the best in the class.

272
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:20,309
In a contest,
what matters more than skills

273
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:21,907
is team work.

274
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:24,445
But it was Liu Xuan who made
a mistake yesterday.

275
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:26,162
Why am I getting punished for it instead?

276
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:27,548
This is so unfair!

277
00:15:27,548 --> 00:15:31,197
I don't mind that other classmates
edge me out or dislike me.

278
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,033
But even Mr. Han does that to me.

279
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,409
This is so mean.

280
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:38,720
I don't give a damn about
this stupid contest!

281
00:15:42,368 --> 00:15:46,505
Fine. If you wish to run away
from your problems, do as you wish.

282
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:50,196
It's just that once you do it

283
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:53,364
you'll surely just keep
running away from all your problems.

284
00:15:53,364 --> 00:15:56,563
If that is so, I'd advise you
to give up on cooking.

285
00:15:56,563 --> 00:15:58,399
I'm not running away from anything.

286
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,988
I was forced to leave!

287
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:02,365
Who said that you can't
make it back on the team?

288
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:06,974
Meng Chen, you were flustered
when Liu Xuan made a mistake.

289
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:09,470
You said to give up the contest
and admit defeat.

290
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,933
Wasn't that a grave mistake you made?

291
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:14,024
Shouldn't Mr. Han punish you?

292
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,000
You've always been the most
outstanding student in class.

293
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,067
Are you going to admit defeat
or start all over again?

294
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,710
It's up to you.

295
00:16:26,046 --> 00:16:27,684
I won't admit defeat!

296
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:30,639
I'll prove that I'm the most
qualified contestant.

297
00:16:51,065 --> 00:16:53,923
Weirdo Zhen, what are you doing?

298
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:56,537
Are you still mad at me?

299
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:02,115
Come here. I have to talk to you.

300
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:04,913
You can say it here.

301
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:09,242
There are too many people around.

302
00:17:09,242 --> 00:17:12,198
You don't want me to apologize?

303
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,567
Wang Mai Zhi, you don't
have to apologize.

304
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,540
I was too stupid.

305
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,229
I thought that sincerity is all
it takes to move someone.

306
00:17:20,229 --> 00:17:24,709
But I didn't realize that
some people don't care for it.

307
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:28,473
Wait a minute!

308
00:17:28,473 --> 00:17:30,938
What should I do to get
you to talk to me?

309
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:36,200
I just realized that I'm not fit
to be Wang Mai Zhi's good friend.

310
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,464
Why not?

311
00:17:38,344 --> 00:17:41,673
This secretive friendship
won't do you any good

312
00:17:41,673 --> 00:17:44,307
if others know about it.

313
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:48,817
I'd rather just stay classmates.

314
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,961
At least I won't have to worry about
being discovered by anyone.

315
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:56,710
Or else you'll be mad at me
and dislike me even more.

316
00:17:58,058 --> 00:18:00,699
Weirdo Zhen...

317
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:06,020
Did I make you sad?

318
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,296
No!

319
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:11,657
I just know very clearly
if my existence matters.

320
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:14,057
I've had a great time.

321
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:16,712
- Goodbye.
- Weirdo Zhen!

322
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:50,377
Can't you ride a bike? Turn!

323
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,886
Free tempo.

324
00:19:03,886 --> 00:19:05,452
You can dance whatever you want.

325
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,748

326
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:49,792
Me? Girlfriend?

327
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,614
What should we do?

328
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:15,134
The rules of the semi-final states

329
00:20:15,134 --> 00:20:17,694
that the instructor can
only instruct, but not cook.

330
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:22,409
It means that the students can
only depend on themselves?

331
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:24,520
Are you worried about
Ah-Sheng's abilities?

332
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,365
I'm actually worried about Qi Zhen.

333
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:33,320
Other than doing well in desserts

334
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,701
it's still a bit worrying when
it comes to her other cuisine.

335
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:37,910
She's been practicing hard.

336
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,469
I think that she will catch up soon.
We should give her a chance.

337
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:44,818
Han Jie, can I ask you a question?

338
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:49,778
Why did you choose Qi Zhen over
Amy or Meng Zhe?

339
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:54,406
Because she's a lot like you.

340
00:20:54,406 --> 00:20:56,900
You both share a very important trait.

341
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,685
It's sincerity.

342
00:20:58,685 --> 00:21:01,150
Her cuisine is very heart-warming.

343
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,315
And she has a very sensitive heart.

344
00:21:03,315 --> 00:21:05,202
That's what the others don't have.

345
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:08,851
I hope that all five of them can make
the best of their unique traits

346
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,344
to make it through this contest.

347
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:14,663
You actually think that Weirdo Zhen
and I are very alike?

348
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:17,057
Her hair is quite cute.

349
00:21:17,057 --> 00:21:19,104
Why don't I get the same perm?

350
00:21:19,104 --> 00:21:21,898
Sure. No matter what you become

351
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:24,555
you'll always be my Fang Xiao Rou.

352
00:21:24,555 --> 00:21:25,951
Do whatever you like.

353
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,275
Yours?

354
00:21:27,275 --> 00:21:29,354
It's as if you had some seal over me?

355
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:30,634
I do.

356
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:32,400
I'll give you one right now.

357
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,588
Report!

358
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,666
I'm sorry, Ms. Fang, Mr. Han!

359
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,278
I didn't see a thing!

360
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:40,740
- Please continue.
- Ma Chong Sheng, turn around.

361
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,511
Mr. Han and I weren't doing anything.

362
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,799
What is it?

363
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,299
Why do you seem so nervous?

364
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,421
When the five of us were
getting ready to practice

365
00:21:51,421 --> 00:21:53,650
we suddenly found Qi Zhen missing.

366
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,446
Someone saw Chen Meng Chen
taking Qi Zhen away.

367
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,094
- Chen Meng Chen!
- Qi Zhen!

368
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,212
- Chen Meng Chen!
- Qi Zhen!

369
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:20,275
Weirdo Zhen!

370
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:28,817

371
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,465

372
00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:33,980
What is she doing?

373
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,166
Chen Meng Chen!

374
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:39,099
- Qi Zhen!
- Chen Meng Chen!

375
00:22:39,882 --> 00:22:41,756
Weirdo Zhen!

376
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:49,115
How is it? Did you see Weirdo Zhen?

377
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:50,438
We searched a lot of places

378
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:51,910
but we still haven't seen her.

379
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:57,135
Mai Zi, Meng Chen and Weirdo Zhen
disappeared together.

380
00:22:57,135 --> 00:22:58,568
Why aren't you concerned about Meng Chen?

381
00:22:58,568 --> 00:23:00,115
Of course not.

382
00:23:00,115 --> 00:23:02,067
It doesn't take much to figure out

383
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:05,181
that Chen Meng Chen was displeased
with Weirdo Zhen replacing her

384
00:23:05,181 --> 00:23:08,135
so she took her away
to bully her as a revenge.

385
00:23:08,135 --> 00:23:09,319
That's impossible!

386
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:11,421
Although Chen Meng Chen is a bit...

387
00:23:11,421 --> 00:23:12,882
A bit what?

388
00:23:12,882 --> 00:23:14,076
A bit straightforward.

389
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:15,548
But she won't bully anyone.

390
00:23:15,548 --> 00:23:17,767
You're bullying her by accusing her.

391
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:20,273
Mai Zi, why don't we search
in different directions again?

392
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,079
Forget it.

393
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,362
It's more important to save her.

394
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:25,563
I'll call the police myself.

395
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:30,400
Tang Xiao Niu, what are you doing?

396
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,599
Didn't you say that you want a "hug"?
(Sounds like "calling the police".)

397
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:35,465
You're still in the mood to joke?

398
00:23:35,465 --> 00:23:37,488
- Get off!
- What are you doing?

399
00:23:37,488 --> 00:23:39,067
Why are you arguing?

400
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:41,500
- He accused Meng Chen!
- He won't let me find Weirdo Zhen!

401
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,826
All right, I know that you're all
eager to find them.

402
00:23:44,826 --> 00:23:47,684
Have you tried calling
Meng Chen or Qi Zhen?

403
00:23:47,684 --> 00:23:51,131
I've asked around for Meng Chen's
cell phone number, but nobody has it.

404
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:53,299
I called Weirdo Zhen a hundred times!

405
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,906
But she won't pick it up.

406
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,200
I'll give it a try.

407
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:08,356
Hello?

408
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:10,191
Hello, Qi Zhen?

409
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:11,919
That's strange?

410
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,699
Weirdo Zhen didn't answer when you called

411
00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:14,980
but she answered Ms. Fang.

412
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,095
Qi Zhen, are you and Meng Chen all right?

413
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:20,303
What's wrong, Ms. Fang?

414
00:24:20,303 --> 00:24:22,636
Your classmates said that
you suddenly disappeared, so--

415
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:25,432
Weirdo Zhen, why did you purposely
refuse to answer my calls?

416
00:24:25,432 --> 00:24:26,637

417
00:24:26,637 --> 00:24:28,369
Mr. Han and Ms. Fang

418
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,993

419
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:32,262

420
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,055
Wei Qi Zhen!

421
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,103
Get back to your practice quickly!

422
00:24:36,103 --> 00:24:38,961
I'm sorry. I have to get back
to my training.

423
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:40,827
Qi Zhen!

424
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:43,199
Luckily, they are both fine.

425
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,844
Exactly. I was almost scared to death.

426
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:47,241
Since they are both fine

427
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:49,268
we should tidy up the classroom first.

428
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:51,403
I still have to head home
to help my grandma.

429
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:54,184
Mai Zi, where are you going?

430
00:24:54,184 --> 00:24:56,299
I'm just a bit upset.

431
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:57,579
I'm going for a walk.

432
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,531
Wait a minute.

433
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,398
Where are you going?

434
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:06,048
Are you just going to leave
Wei Qi Zhen and Chen Meng Chen alone?

435
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:14,051
Although Wei Qi Zhen and Chen Meng Chen

436
00:25:14,051 --> 00:25:17,682
don't perform as well
in skills or team work

437
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,476
they both share a trait that I admire.

438
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:26,356
They are willing to make an effort
and spend time on accomplishing a task.

439
00:25:26,356 --> 00:25:28,170
What about you?

440
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,443
Do you really think that
you're all much better than them?

441
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:34,599
Do you think that you can get
through the second round?

442
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:38,578
Mr. Han, I almost cost everyone
the first round of the contest.

443
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,509
I wish to apologize to everyone.

444
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:42,653
I'll surely practice even harder.

445
00:25:42,653 --> 00:25:46,300
I was really nervous that day as well.

446
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,348
I should also stay behind to practice

447
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:50,238
- to avoid making the same mistake.
- Exactly.

448
00:25:50,238 --> 00:25:52,099
Meng Chen was right to scold me.

449
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:53,351
I should practice more

450
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,895
so as not to lose to Meng Chen.

451
00:25:54,895 --> 00:25:56,528
Let's go practice now.

452
00:26:04,805 --> 00:26:08,099
I'm used to practicing at home.

453
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,041
Bye.

454
00:26:10,993 --> 00:26:12,836
Wang Mai Zhi!

455
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:15,556
The main gate is over there.
Where are you going?

456
00:26:15,556 --> 00:26:20,973
No... I just recall that I should keep
an eye on Chen Meng Chen and Weirdo Zhen

457
00:26:20,973 --> 00:26:22,948
so that they won't slack off.

458
00:26:26,979 --> 00:26:29,208
Having mentored these students
for so long

459
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,680
they have finally matured.

460
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,718
They are going to practice voluntarily.

461
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:35,651
Practice doesn't guarantee good results.

462
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:39,404
No matter how the outcome might be

463
00:26:39,404 --> 00:26:42,561
I believe that this will be
a great experience for them.

464
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:45,538
As long as they do their best,
it is a good contest.

465
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:48,727
You're right. The process is
much more important than...

466
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:50,667
The result.

467
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,788
Wrong!

468
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,589
How many times do you want me to repeat?

469
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,173
It's still wrong!

470
00:27:09,051 --> 00:27:10,250
Wrong!

471
00:27:10,758 --> 00:27:12,169
Wrong!

472
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:14,356
Did I teach you that?

473
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,603
I'm sorry. I'm too nervous!

474
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:18,461
I'll do it again!

475
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:26,799
How is this a thin slice?

476
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,570
This is a thick slice!

477
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:31,468
Seriously...

478
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,680
Your fingers have to push
against the blade

479
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,801
so that you won't cut yourself. Get it?

480
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:40,298
- Try it again.
- Okay, I got it.

481
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,018
Let me have a look.

482
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,719
It's bandaged. Keep going.

483
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,394
Okay.

484
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,587
After you've practiced knife skills

485
00:28:03,587 --> 00:28:05,407
I'll train you in seasoning techniques.

486
00:28:05,407 --> 00:28:08,010
You have to win the semi-final.

487
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,333
I'll do my best!

488
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,211
Meng Chen, thank you

489
00:28:11,211 --> 00:28:13,417
for taking to time to train me.

490
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:14,880
Why are you thanking me?

491
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,258
I'm only helping you for my own sake.

492
00:28:17,258 --> 00:28:19,433
You have to make it into the finals

493
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:21,790
in order for me to get back on the team.

494
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,093
You're not to lose. Hear me?

495
00:28:23,093 --> 00:28:24,809
I understand!

496
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:43,795
Chen Meng Chen, why are you
torturing our Weirdo Zhen?

497
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:46,403
Do you know who she is to me?

498
00:28:46,403 --> 00:28:48,313
I don't know. Who is she to you?

499
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,020
Anyway, I'm the only person in
the world who can bully her!

500
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,506
Weirdo Zhen, let's go.

501
00:28:56,506 --> 00:28:58,063
I...

502
00:28:58,063 --> 00:28:59,523
I don't want to!

503
00:28:59,523 --> 00:29:01,329
Weirdo Zhen, what are you doing?

504
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:19,262
I'm the only person in
the world who can bully her!

505
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,826
Weirdo Zhen, let's go.

506
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,256
I...

507
00:29:23,256 --> 00:29:24,837
I don't want to!

508
00:29:24,837 --> 00:29:26,586
What are you doing?

509
00:29:26,586 --> 00:29:29,071
Is this the Stockholm Syndrome?

510
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:32,123
Why are you staying to be tortured
by that Pretentious Chen?

511
00:29:32,123 --> 00:29:33,540
She's not torturing me!

512
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,592
Meng Chen is training me very seriously.

513
00:29:36,592 --> 00:29:38,053
See?

514
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:42,020
She's not a teacher.
Who is she to train you?

515
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,462
Fine, if you want training

516
00:29:44,462 --> 00:29:45,999
I can help you with it.

517
00:29:45,999 --> 00:29:47,556
No!

518
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:52,750
Weirdo Zhen, you'd rather practice
with that Pretentious Chen

519
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,169
than practicing with me?

520
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,799
Meng Chen is stricter.

521
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,596
I'll improve faster.

522
00:30:00,756 --> 00:30:03,789
Fine. You said it.

523
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:05,368
Don't regret it.

524
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:08,140
Are you done yet? Get going.

525
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,884
We have a lot to practice.

526
00:30:09,884 --> 00:30:11,079
Time is precious.

527
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,253
Wei Qi Zhen, get back here.

528
00:30:13,253 --> 00:30:14,644
Hurry up.

529
00:30:14,644 --> 00:30:16,869
Keep practicing. Hurry up.

530
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:19,451
Chen Meng Chen, just wait and see.

531
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:22,202
Chop quickly.

532
00:30:27,377 --> 00:30:28,666
Let me have a look.

533
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:33,953
It's very thin.

534
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Keep working hard on it.

535
00:30:41,192 --> 00:30:43,136
Weirdo Zhen is such a silly girl.

536
00:30:43,136 --> 00:30:44,726
How dare she turn me down?

537
00:30:44,726 --> 00:30:46,599
It's fine to turn me down

538
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,654
but did she have to do it
in front of Chen Meng Chen?

539
00:30:48,654 --> 00:30:50,392
She didn't even save me some face.

540
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:53,295
Do you have weapons in your bag?

541
00:30:53,295 --> 00:30:54,948
What is it that's so heavy?

542
00:30:54,948 --> 00:30:57,510
My ribs and internal organs are broken...

543
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,400
- Is this funny?
- Medical fees...

544
00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:03,627
- It's not funny.
- Then?

545
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:05,163
Do you want to be bashed up?

546
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,819
- No.
- Then stay away from me.

547
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:09,612
I'm in a foul mood today.

548
00:31:09,612 --> 00:31:12,662
First, you knock into me
and now you scold me?

549
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,592
You want to be bashed up?

550
00:31:19,103 --> 00:31:20,519
You're really...

551
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,934
Get lost!

552
00:31:22,934 --> 00:31:24,492
I'm off...

553
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,811
Friend? What friend?

554
00:31:39,811 --> 00:31:41,134
It's all a lie!

555
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:44,472
She changes her mind so quickly
and turns on me!

556
00:31:44,472 --> 00:31:45,988
What friend is that?

557
00:31:46,845 --> 00:31:48,306
Lousy dictionary!

558
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,203
You're just a book of deception!

559
00:31:51,635 --> 00:31:54,133
Forget it.
Your owner doesn't want you anymore.

560
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:56,159
Why don't you kill yourself?

561
00:32:10,855 --> 00:32:12,883
Who threw this in without
finishing the food?

562
00:32:12,883 --> 00:32:14,883
That's so inconsiderate.

563
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,291
More? Are you trying
to stink me to death?

564
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:24,894
What are you doing?

565
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,478
Found you!

566
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,200
Mr. Han...

567
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:42,356
Sir.

568
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,494
Can you give me two more wet tissues?

569
00:32:47,494 --> 00:32:50,089
You washed your hands three times
and used the hand sanitizer.

570
00:32:50,089 --> 00:32:53,759
- You still find it dirty?
- It's not for me.

571
00:32:54,455 --> 00:32:56,893
It's for this.

572
00:32:58,656 --> 00:33:00,150
Thank you.

573
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,590
It this dictionary very important?

574
00:33:03,288 --> 00:33:06,039
No... It's not important...

575
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:08,634
I'll throw it away then. It stinks.

576
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:11,471
Wait a minute, sir!

577
00:33:11,471 --> 00:33:15,310
No! You can't throw it away.

578
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:18,400
The contest is coming up soon
and you're not practicing?

579
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,299
Why were you going through the bin?

580
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:22,019
What for?

581
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:25,295
I'm so skilled that I don't need to
practice to defeat Qiang Ren High School.

582
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:26,650
Don't worry.

583
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,578
You're very confident. Good.

584
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,538
All your teammates are practicing
but you're idling around.

585
00:33:34,538 --> 00:33:36,675
Aren't you worried that
they would say you're lazy?

586
00:33:36,675 --> 00:33:38,211
How am I lazy?

587
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:40,835
- I was going to ask--
- Ask who?

588
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:47,400
No, I was just going to ask
some classmates to practice.

589
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,534
So...

590
00:33:48,534 --> 00:33:51,766
it isn't that you don't need to practice,
but that you don't want to.

591
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:54,342
I guess it must be that

592
00:33:54,342 --> 00:33:57,700
you asked someone to practice
with you but was rejected.

593
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,880
So now our World's Most Handsome Guy
is upset and doesn't want to practice?

594
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:03,599
You can even guess that right?

595
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,257
You're remarkable.

596
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:08,840
Mr. Han, why don't you become
a detective instead?

597
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,298
Let's try and guess who
you wanted to practice with?

598
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,664
Could it be Chen Meng Chen?

599
00:34:14,664 --> 00:34:16,778
How is that possible?

600
00:34:16,778 --> 00:34:19,014
How wants to practice with
that pretentious, arrogant

601
00:34:19,014 --> 00:34:20,284
and rude person?

602
00:34:20,284 --> 00:34:22,268
She's like a female version of me!

603
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:25,030
Version...

604
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,800
This is so infuriating!

605
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,849
It's fine that Ma Chong Sheng
misunderstood me.

606
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:30,778
Even Mr. Han misunderstands me?

607
00:34:31,934 --> 00:34:34,750
Are we really such a good match?

608
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:38,195
You should ask yourself why
others would misunderstand you.

609
00:34:38,195 --> 00:34:41,543
You're right. Why?

610
00:34:42,782 --> 00:34:45,202
is it because I'm too handsome?

611
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,144
It's not my fault that I'm so handsome.

612
00:34:48,144 --> 00:34:49,786
You should blame my parents.

613
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,373
Or is it because I'm too snobbish?

614
00:34:56,807 --> 00:34:59,443
I know that I have a bad attitude

615
00:34:59,443 --> 00:35:01,440
and I have a sharp tongue.

616
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,255
But this bad habit is hard to quit.

617
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,766
It's not about making the change

618
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:10,672
but if you've met that person
whom you'd change for?

619
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:15,643
Take me for example.

620
00:35:15,643 --> 00:35:18,246
I didn't like desserts,
but now I have them every day.

621
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:20,838
Is it because of Ms. Fang?

622
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:21,844
Yes.

623
00:35:21,844 --> 00:35:24,797
Have you met your Ms. Fang?

624
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,507
I think so...

625
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:30,059
No wonder I don't feel like coming
to school in my car anymore.

626
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:32,574
I find it more amusing to ride a bike.

627
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,047
It's not the bike.

628
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:39,759
It's the person who rides the bike
with you that makes it interesting.

629
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:42,916
It's not about doing something

630
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:44,931
but who you do it with?

631
00:35:44,931 --> 00:35:46,699
You got it.

632
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:48,846
Okay, I got it.

633
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,989
Sir, thanks.

634
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:53,806
I'll surely practice
very hard from now on

635
00:35:53,806 --> 00:35:56,856
to show that silly girl
how cool and capable I am.

636
00:35:56,856 --> 00:35:59,949
Then she'll surely agree to
practice with me in the future.

637
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,666
Go.

638
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,396
Fang Xiao Rou?

639
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,847
What is it? Why the long face?

640
00:36:14,847 --> 00:36:16,458
It's nothing.

641
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:18,346
I'm trying to draft a strategy.

642
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:21,695
In the semi-final, the supervising
teacher can only instruct.

643
00:36:21,695 --> 00:36:26,333
I'm very troubled about delegating
the duties among the five students.

644
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,445
When you can't come up with any ideas

645
00:36:28,445 --> 00:36:30,753
the best idea is not to think about it.

646
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:32,565
And bury my head in the sand?

647
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,043
Just have a drink and listen to gossips.

648
00:36:36,043 --> 00:36:38,378
You might think of something
once you're relaxed, right?

649
00:36:39,338 --> 00:36:40,864
You have a lot of weird ideas.

650
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:43,936
What gossip is it?

651
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:46,559
You want to hear about it as well, right?

652
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,300
I heard that our principal
has a mysterious son.

653
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,530
Have you heard about it?

654
00:36:52,268 --> 00:36:53,804
I might have heard about it

655
00:36:53,804 --> 00:36:55,056
or maybe I hadn't.

656
00:36:55,056 --> 00:36:56,088
I don't remember.

657
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:59,063
How can you forget about
such an important matter?

658
00:36:59,063 --> 00:37:00,610
Do you have to get so agitated?

659
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,938
Is it important whether
our principal has a son or not?

660
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:06,262
It has nothing to do with us anyway.

661
00:37:06,262 --> 00:37:08,268
It has nothing to do with you

662
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:11,168
- but it concerns me greatly.
- Why?

663
00:37:12,182 --> 00:37:15,599
Mr. Wen hasn't updated his
Facebook status for two weeks already.

664
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,856
That's why I've decided
to find myself a backup.

665
00:37:18,856 --> 00:37:21,000
You obviously care a lot about him.

666
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,742
Why do you have to put on
the mask of a witch?

667
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,900
Are you trying to conceal your feelings?

668
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,911
I'm not!

669
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:30,346
It's because you don't understand.

670
00:37:30,346 --> 00:37:33,994
A popular woman like me
has too many suitors to choose from.

671
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:35,806
I have too many suitors.

672
00:37:35,806 --> 00:37:37,951
I'm worried about picking out a bad guy.

673
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:41,001
I have to be more careful

674
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:43,144
and compare as many men as I can.

675
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:47,561
Come on. You don't even know
what the Principal's son look like.

676
00:37:47,561 --> 00:37:50,184
- You're already putting him on the list?
- Of course.

677
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:53,074
No man can escape my claws.

678
00:37:53,074 --> 00:37:55,581
All right, go and ask around then.

679
00:37:55,581 --> 00:37:57,342
I wish you happiness.

680
00:37:58,059 --> 00:37:59,570
Fang Xiao Rou.

681
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,394
What bosom friend are you?

682
00:38:02,394 --> 00:38:05,840
Be careful that your man
will fall for me as well.

683
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:09,282
That's impossible.

684
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:13,105
That's because I have a conscience!

685
00:38:13,105 --> 00:38:14,407
You wait and see.

686
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:24,000
Mr. Han!

687
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,253
What is it?

688
00:38:26,786 --> 00:38:28,365
Don't say that I'm not a good friend.

689
00:38:28,365 --> 00:38:33,583
I got hold of Qiang Ren
High School's strategy.

690
00:38:34,436 --> 00:38:35,737
So?

691
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:37,942
Come here.

692
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:40,235
Have a seat.

693
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,635
All right, listen up.

694
00:38:42,635 --> 00:38:47,500
I'm here to talk to you about
defeating them in the semi-finals.

695
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,219
It's all right.

696
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:53,721
I don't need such information.
I have faith in my students.

697
00:38:53,721 --> 00:38:56,739
I believe that they can win this round.

698
00:38:57,507 --> 00:39:02,275
Mr. Han, why are you so confident?

699
00:39:02,275 --> 00:39:03,916
I have confidence in my students.

700
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:06,300
It's so nice to be
the supervising teacher.

701
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,344
It's so easy.

702
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:10,429
Unlike us, as counselors,
it's so stressful.

703
00:39:10,967 --> 00:39:14,668
You know that the Principal handed
the huge responsibility of managing

704
00:39:14,668 --> 00:39:16,108
National Culinary Contest to me.

705
00:39:16,108 --> 00:39:18,592
I have to meet
the Principal's expectations.

706
00:39:18,592 --> 00:39:20,148
I mustn't make him look bad

707
00:39:20,148 --> 00:39:21,576
and also not let Si Ping down.

708
00:39:21,576 --> 00:39:23,309
Wow...

709
00:39:23,309 --> 00:39:26,829
Aren't the students at Si Ping
blessed to have you?

710
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:29,293
Don't worry, the students
won't let you down.

711
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,882
Mr. Han, on that note...

712
00:39:39,914 --> 00:39:41,076
Come here.

713
00:39:42,971 --> 00:39:47,599
Have you heard about
the Principal's mysterious son?

714
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,827
Do you know who he is?

715
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:08,753
Come here.

716
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:14,737
Have you heard about
the Principal's mysterious son?

717
00:40:14,737 --> 00:40:16,092
Do you know who he is?

718
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,516
The principal's son?

719
00:40:20,476 --> 00:40:22,342
Is that important?

720
00:40:22,342 --> 00:40:23,440
Of course!

721
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,534
He's my strong competitor.

722
00:40:26,534 --> 00:40:28,913
The candidates for
the next principal election

723
00:40:28,913 --> 00:40:32,271
would be me and that Daddy's boy!

724
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,380
I think it's still too early to tell.

725
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,893
Really? Why?

726
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:39,677
First of all, I don't think
that the Principal is so old

727
00:40:39,677 --> 00:40:40,893
that he's retiring soon.

728
00:40:40,893 --> 00:40:42,329
Secondly, between you, Counselor Li

729
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:44,775
and the Principal's son

730
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,215
I'll surely support you.

731
00:40:46,215 --> 00:40:47,677
Daddy's boy isn't any good.

732
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:48,989
It's really not good.

733
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:52,594
Mr. Han, I didn't know that
you're such a good friend!

734
00:40:52,594 --> 00:40:56,338
You'd go against
the Principal's son for my sake.

735
00:40:56,896 --> 00:40:59,882
Just for that reason,
I'll totally have your back!

736
00:41:00,949 --> 00:41:07,221
May the two most handsome guys in
Si Ping lead the team to victory!

737
00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:09,731
Okay, deal!

738
00:41:10,806 --> 00:41:13,400
Mr. Han, who is "deal"?

739
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,000
Han Jie!

740
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:27,728
I thought about it long and hard.

741
00:41:27,728 --> 00:41:30,130
I finally figured out
how to delegate everyone.

742
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,208
Listen.

743
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:33,394
Ah-Sheng is quick-witted.

744
00:41:33,394 --> 00:41:34,880
Liu Xuan is very stable.

745
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,070
They could work together on seasoning.
What do you think?

746
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,202
Are you listening?

747
00:41:47,536 --> 00:41:49,445
Anybody home?

748
00:41:49,445 --> 00:41:50,920
Who are you looking for?

749
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:53,612
- I'm looking for you?
- Who am I?

750
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:56,289
You're Han Jie.

751
00:41:56,289 --> 00:41:59,500
No, I'm your...

752
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:05,199
You're my boyfriend.

753
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:09,998
Someone finally remembers
that I'm her boyfriend?

754
00:42:09,998 --> 00:42:13,476
It's not that. I really need your help.

755
00:42:13,476 --> 00:42:15,427
Boyfriend.

756
00:42:15,427 --> 00:42:16,706
Like I just said

757
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:18,733
Ah-Sheng can team up with Liu Xuan

758
00:42:18,733 --> 00:42:20,344
then Mai Zi and Xiao Niu...

759
00:42:20,344 --> 00:42:23,512
No, they both of them will argue.

760
00:42:23,512 --> 00:42:26,755
Mai Zi should team up with Qi Zhen.
What do you think?

761
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:29,101
Do as you said then.

762
00:42:30,052 --> 00:42:31,960
Are you sure?

763
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,380
You don't seem to care much about it.

764
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,655
You know the students so well,
I should go along with your decision.

765
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:42,070
What I care about is that you've
been too busy to eat properly.

766
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,811
That's not very important...

767
00:42:45,572 --> 00:42:47,545
I disagree.

768
00:42:47,545 --> 00:42:50,927
Your health matters more to me
than anything else.

769
00:42:52,282 --> 00:42:54,375
All right, I understand.

770
00:42:55,217 --> 00:42:59,195
Someone is actually too busy
to care about me.

771
00:43:01,356 --> 00:43:04,385
Is my ingenious chef acting cute?

772
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:07,844
Am I the cute pet or you?

773
00:43:09,103 --> 00:43:10,873
What do you say?

774
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:19,139
Let me have a look!

775
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,389
It's me!

776
00:43:21,389 --> 00:43:23,181
I'm so tired from carving that.

777
00:43:23,181 --> 00:43:26,295
Shouldn't you express some concern?

778
00:43:26,295 --> 00:43:29,271
Aren't you nervous that the semi-final
is just around the corner?

779
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:31,365
- Are you changing the topic?
- No, it's just...

780
00:43:31,365 --> 00:43:33,552
I'm really worried about the contest.

781
00:43:33,552 --> 00:43:35,226
There's nothing to worry about.

782
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:36,998
If we can't figure out the theme

783
00:43:36,998 --> 00:43:40,623
we'll just be fully prepared
to tackle any theme.

784
00:43:40,623 --> 00:43:42,436
- But...
- But we should

785
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:46,570
place the students in a stressful
environment to train them to adapt.

786
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:49,219
- But...
- But, however, and?

787
00:43:49,219 --> 00:43:52,322
Stop thinking if you can't come
up with anything else.

788
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:53,757
I'm hungry.

789
00:43:53,757 --> 00:43:55,509
Let's go for lunch.

790
00:43:56,563 --> 00:44:00,286
What kind of boyfriend only worries
about being hungry?

791
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,085
Don't display such affection
in front of me.

792
00:44:18,878 --> 00:44:20,222
Everyone!

793
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,416
Get ready for the contest.

794
00:44:31,806 --> 00:44:34,358
I'll wait outside. Come on out
when you're ready.

795
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:36,697
Don't forget to take it easy.

796
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:38,675
Yes!

797
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:52,393
Ah-Sheng, if I make a mistake again

798
00:44:52,393 --> 00:44:53,673
don't help me out.

799
00:44:53,673 --> 00:44:56,766
- Why?
- Then I can remind myself

800
00:44:56,766 --> 00:44:59,070
to be more serious and careful.

801
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:02,302
I think that you can do very well today.

802
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:04,628
I'll do my best!

803
00:45:12,489 --> 00:45:14,092
Tang Xiao Niu!

804
00:45:14,831 --> 00:45:16,809
The Empress Dowager beckons.

805
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:19,570
Eunuch Niu is finally summoned.

806
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:22,730
At your service.

807
00:45:24,313 --> 00:45:25,945
Reach out your hand.

808
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,351
Lightly.

809
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,400
I'm worried that I can't cook later.

810
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,661
Are you insane? Who's going to hit you?

811
00:45:34,152 --> 00:45:35,541
What is this?

812
00:45:35,541 --> 00:45:37,610
It's Chen Meng Chen's sachet.

813
00:45:38,192 --> 00:45:39,483
You made it for me?

814
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:43,244
You'd better perform so well
as if you'd been possessed by me.

815
00:45:43,244 --> 00:45:47,344
If you lose the contest, you have
to stay five meters away from me.

816
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:48,922
If I win this round?

817
00:45:48,922 --> 00:45:51,983
Can I stay by your side, Miss Quiet?

818
00:45:53,028 --> 00:45:54,309
Whatever.

819
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,806
Weirdo Zhen, come with me.

820
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:21,188
Wang Mai Zhi, what is it?

821
00:46:21,188 --> 00:46:24,099
Nothing. This is just
something in return.

822
00:46:24,099 --> 00:46:26,023
You gave me an amulet last time.

823
00:46:26,023 --> 00:46:29,416
It's my turn to give you one this time.

824
00:46:31,996 --> 00:46:35,762
Why does this amulet look so strange?

825
00:46:35,762 --> 00:46:37,393
Did you jinx it?

826
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:39,101
Strange?

827
00:46:39,101 --> 00:46:40,242
That's rude.

828
00:46:40,242 --> 00:46:43,217
I made this by hand.

829
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,143
Put it on.

830
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,574
- I'd better not take it.
- Why not?

831
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:52,617
I want to finish this contest
with my own abilities.

832
00:46:52,617 --> 00:46:53,780
I don't care.

833
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,369
If you don't wear it,
you'll affect my mood.

834
00:46:56,369 --> 00:46:59,782
Do you want me to lose the contest
because I'm in a bad mood?

835
00:46:59,782 --> 00:47:02,139
- No.
- No?

836
00:47:02,139 --> 00:47:04,070
Then you should just wear it.

837
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,418
Very good.

838
00:47:15,418 --> 00:47:18,181
You're not to take it off
without my permission.

839
00:47:18,181 --> 00:47:19,514
Do you hear me?

840
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,516
Si Ping, go, go, go!

841
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:46,126
The semi-finals of
the National Culinary Contest

842
00:47:46,126 --> 00:47:49,599
is between Si Ping Vocational High School

843
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,590
and Qiang Ren High School!

844
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:57,534
Si Ping defeated their tough opponent
Shi Wen High School in the first round

845
00:47:57,534 --> 00:47:58,786
right at the end.

846
00:47:58,786 --> 00:48:02,434
Now that they are up against
a strong team like Qiang Ren

847
00:48:02,434 --> 00:48:05,197
I believe that this must be
a very exciting contest!

848
00:48:05,197 --> 00:48:08,438
The guys have crew cuts
and the girls are in bobs.

849
00:48:08,438 --> 00:48:12,161
They are almost as scary as
the devil's team in movies.

850
00:48:12,161 --> 00:48:14,500
Their aprons are even
in camouflage colors.

851
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,043
They are like an army.

852
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:20,090
Our theme is seafood cuisine.

853
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:23,487
The rule in the semi-finals is that
supervising teachers can only instruct

854
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:26,041
but they aren't allowed to cook.

855
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:27,652
All right. Are you ready?

856
00:48:27,652 --> 00:48:30,735
Okay, ninety minutes...

857
00:48:30,735 --> 00:48:33,072
The contest starts now!

858
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,282
The menu is...

859
00:48:45,282 --> 00:48:47,557
up to you.

860
00:48:48,788 --> 00:48:52,766
Is that... Is that okay?

861
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:55,099
Weirdo Zhen, what are you afraid of?

862
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,556
You have me.

863
00:48:56,556 --> 00:48:59,244
You've learned so many different
dishes over the past three years.

864
00:48:59,244 --> 00:49:01,019
This is the best time to see the results.

865
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:03,726
I'll leave the five of you
solely in charge.

866
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I remember when we were looking
for ingredients in mountains and ocean

867
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,677
Mr. Han taught us how to make
fish balls from Taiwanese snappers.

868
00:49:10,677 --> 00:49:14,670
We learned that all ingredients
are equally valuable. Then it was...

869
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:15,885
Mai Zi seafood gratin!

870
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,885
I mean durian seafood gratin.

871
00:49:18,887 --> 00:49:20,864
It taught us that nothing is impossible.

872
00:49:21,563 --> 00:49:24,443
And... During the Universiade

873
00:49:24,443 --> 00:49:26,992
we made exotic first-class soup

874
00:49:26,992 --> 00:49:29,114
fresh fish soup,
and lemon konnyaku jelly.

875
00:49:29,114 --> 00:49:31,059
Which one should we make?

876
00:49:31,059 --> 00:49:34,501
Mr. Han used to teach us
different dishes.

877
00:49:34,501 --> 00:49:36,699
It's exotic dishes
that don't seem exotic.

878
00:49:36,699 --> 00:49:39,594
Why don't we make our
seafood cuisine not seem like one?

879
00:49:39,594 --> 00:49:40,626
How about that?

880
00:49:40,626 --> 00:49:42,978
That's right. I thought so as well.

881
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,800
All right then.

882
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,715
Let's make seafood cuisine
that doesn't seem like one?

883
00:49:50,152 --> 00:49:53,545
This is the first time that
you're cooking on your own.

884
00:49:53,545 --> 00:49:55,358
I know that you're a bit nervous

885
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:57,469
but both Mr. Han and I trust in you.

886
00:49:57,469 --> 00:49:59,134
So just give it your all.

887
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,110
Ms. Fang and I will be
watching you on the side.

888
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:06,382
Don't be afraid to make mistakes.
This is your contest.

889
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,289
- Take your positions!
- Yes!

890
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:22,018
Meng Chen gave me a sachet.

891
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,949
How can I forget about it?

892
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:29,409

893
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,333
It's Chen Meng Chen indeed.

894
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:34,943
I feel so inspired.

895
00:50:34,943 --> 00:50:37,567
I have so much fight in me now.

896
00:51:06,413 --> 00:51:09,304
Pei Ying, could you make me a promise?

897
00:51:10,583 --> 00:51:11,938
No.

898
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,141
It's very simple.

899
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:17,445
If we win today

900
00:51:17,445 --> 00:51:20,815
can you promise me a reward?

901
00:51:22,222 --> 00:51:23,652
Sure.

902
00:51:25,905 --> 00:51:29,391
Pei Ying, we've known each other
for so long already.

903
00:51:29,391 --> 00:51:31,418
You finally know how much effort I made.

904
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:34,862
Have you thought of the reward?

905
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:39,992
If we don't lose this round

906
00:51:39,992 --> 00:51:42,449
I'll decide not to kill you.

907
00:51:42,449 --> 00:51:44,561
How do you like this reward?

908
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:31,664
Meng Chen, thanks for training Qi Zhen.

909
00:52:31,664 --> 00:52:33,820
Let's cheer for Qi Zhen together.

910
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:38,527
Qi Zhen, you can do it!

911
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,094
Go, go, go!

912
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:46,478
You still end up cheering
for them with us.

913
00:52:46,478 --> 00:52:49,827
Even without you,
We'll still win the semi-finals.

914
00:52:49,827 --> 00:52:53,559
Just sit here and cheer
for our classmates.

915
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:57,500
I've sent out my apprentice, Wei Qi Zhen.
She alone can defeat Qiang Ren!

916
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,826
Just wait and see!

917
00:53:00,257 --> 00:53:02,623
Qi Zhen, you can do it!

918
00:53:02,623 --> 00:53:04,827
Qi Zhen, you can do it!

919
00:53:25,264 --> 00:53:27,353
Next, it's the really difficult part.

920
00:53:27,353 --> 00:53:30,469
It's the flounder sashimi
that's 0.1 centimeter thick...

921
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,730
It's just a flounder.

922
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:35,170
How difficult could it be?

923
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,313
I don't think that
it will be an issue for me.

924
00:53:42,443 --> 00:53:43,909
Can you do it?

925
00:53:43,909 --> 00:53:45,664
If I can't, can you?

926
00:53:47,505 --> 00:53:49,643
I recommend Liu Xuan.

927
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:53,684
I think that she's agile with her hands.
She's also attentive to details.

928
00:54:00,873 --> 00:54:02,762
Mai Zi, let me give it a try.

929
00:54:17,268 --> 00:54:21,706
Mr. Han, how should we slice
the perfect flounder sashimi?

930
00:54:22,804 --> 00:54:25,378
Think of your fingers as
the extension of your blade.

931
00:54:25,378 --> 00:54:26,885
Lower the core of your body weight.

932
00:54:26,885 --> 00:54:29,873
Don't put weight on your hands,
but your waist. Do it in one stroke.

933
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:32,360
Quickly.

934
00:54:40,576 --> 00:54:43,186
Why is it turning out like that?

935
00:54:50,143 --> 00:54:53,976
We only have ten more minutes to go.

936
00:55:10,925 --> 00:55:13,626
We only have ten more minutes to go.

937
00:55:22,809 --> 00:55:26,019
Wei Qi Zhen! I just taught you!

938
00:55:26,019 --> 00:55:27,320
Have you forgotten all about it?

939
00:55:37,806 --> 00:55:40,753
My dictionary doesn't have the words
"defeat", "failure", or "cowardice".

940
00:55:40,753 --> 00:55:42,500
There's nothing that I can't do.

941
00:55:49,402 --> 00:55:52,262
Qi Zhen, believe in yourself.

942
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,588
Qi Zhen, you're awesome!

943
00:55:55,588 --> 00:55:56,606
Go!

944
00:55:56,606 --> 00:56:04,925
Go, go, go!

945
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,978
Both teams used the same concept
of a seafood platter.

946
00:56:49,978 --> 00:56:52,230
But they used completely
different culinary methods.

947
00:57:08,204 --> 00:57:11,021
Which team has won the judges over?

948
00:57:26,063 --> 00:57:30,373
The teams of the semi-finals of the
National High School Culinary Contest

949
00:57:30,373 --> 00:57:31,652
have very close scores.

950
00:57:31,652 --> 00:57:33,659
But...

951
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:39,726
Si Ping Vocational High School excelled
in creativity and knife skills.

952
00:57:39,726 --> 00:57:42,981
Therefore, the winner is Si Ping!

953
00:57:58,815 --> 00:58:00,425
Wait a minute!

954
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,500
Meng Chen, thank you.

955
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,931
If you hadn't trained me

956
00:58:07,931 --> 00:58:09,369
we might not have won the contest.

957
00:58:11,431 --> 00:58:14,974
Meng Chen, you might not have
represented the school in this round

958
00:58:14,974 --> 00:58:17,586
you've contributed greatly. Well done.

959
00:58:17,586 --> 00:58:19,606
We won the contest together.

960
00:58:19,606 --> 00:58:22,208
Meng Chen, you deserve to
take credit for it as well.

961
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:23,905
I didn't do anything.

962
00:58:25,226 --> 00:58:26,655
Wait a minute.

963
00:58:26,655 --> 00:58:28,842
I have to thank you as well.

964
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:31,519
I also want to apologize to you.

965
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:35,125
I didn't mean to sound so bitter.
You're really very outstanding.

966
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:37,664
I just didn't want to admit it.

967
00:58:37,664 --> 00:58:39,572
I'm sorry.

968
00:58:39,572 --> 00:58:41,855
- It's fine.
- Thank you, Meng Chen!

969
00:58:41,855 --> 00:58:44,670
- Let's cheer for Meng Chen!
- Don't touch me!

970
00:58:46,346 --> 00:58:48,373
Don't be so nice to me.

971
00:58:48,373 --> 00:58:51,210
I'm still used to having you dislike me.

972
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:52,789
Where are you going?

973
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,911
Forget it. She's too proud.
It's best not to push her.

974
00:58:57,911 --> 00:59:00,077
We'll go for hamburgers later.

975
00:59:00,077 --> 00:59:01,335
It's on me.

976
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:23,400
Meng Chen!

977
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,471
What?

978
00:59:25,471 --> 00:59:27,443
We're going to celebrate
and have hamburgers.

979
00:59:27,443 --> 00:59:30,195
- Aren't you going to join us?
- Why should I?

980
00:59:30,195 --> 00:59:36,072
It proves that Si Ping can still make it
into the finals without me.

981
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,768
Our class don't need me anymore.

982
00:59:38,722 --> 00:59:40,489
But I do.

983
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,139
Who cares about you?

984
00:59:43,762 --> 00:59:46,800
Why are your eyes red?

985
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,041
They aren't!

986
00:59:48,041 --> 00:59:51,356
Are you upset that you
can't get back to the team?

987
00:59:51,356 --> 00:59:53,570
I'll talk to Mr. Han to...

988
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:55,224
You're not to go!

989
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:56,407
But...

990
00:59:58,418 --> 01:00:00,625
It's fine as long as
Si Ping can win the contest.

991
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:02,972
I don't matter that much.

992
01:00:27,344 --> 01:00:29,135
Weirdo Zhen!

993
01:00:29,135 --> 01:00:32,293
Weirdo Zhen, stop right there.

994
01:00:32,293 --> 01:00:33,661
What is it?

995
01:00:33,661 --> 01:00:36,277
- You don't listen to me anymore?
- That's not it.

996
01:00:36,277 --> 01:00:38,291
Stop right there, Weirdo Zhen!

997
01:00:46,541 --> 01:00:49,101
Wang Mai Zhi, let go of me right away!

998
01:00:49,101 --> 01:00:50,967
The students are coming out soon.

999
01:00:50,967 --> 01:00:53,079
- You'll find this very embarrassing.
- No!

1000
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:54,701
I won't let you go no matter what.

1001
01:00:54,701 --> 01:00:56,418
What's embarrassing to be seen with you?

1002
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:35,286
Goodbye.

1003
01:01:38,411 --> 01:01:42,987

1004
01:01:42,987 --> 01:01:44,054

1005
01:01:44,054 --> 01:01:46,699

1006
01:01:46,699 --> 01:01:49,920
won't do you any good if
others know about it.

1007
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,378
I'd rather that we just stay classmates.

1008
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:58,677
At least, I won't have to worry about
being found out by others

1009
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:02,099
and you won't get mad at me
or dislike me even more.

1010
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:04,286
Have I made you very sad?

1011
01:02:04,286 --> 01:02:06,465
No.

1012
01:02:06,465 --> 01:02:10,338
I just know clearly what
my existence means.

1013
01:02:10,338 --> 01:02:12,159
I've been very happy.

1014
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:14,880
- Goodbye.
- Weirdo Zhen!

1015
01:02:24,628 --> 01:02:26,815
Weirdo Zhen!

1016
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,463
Weirdo Zhen, I like you!

1017
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:22,634
This... This can't be true...

1018
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:26,568
Who said that you can hug me?

1019
01:03:26,568 --> 01:03:27,811
Player Zhe!

1020
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:29,507
The truth is finally out!

1021
01:03:29,507 --> 01:03:31,318
Mai Zi has been picking on me recently.

1022
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:33,900
That's because he likes Weirdo Zhen!

1023
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,737
Mai Zi, cool!

1024
01:03:38,737 --> 01:03:41,083
Of course! I'm so cool that
the gods and men are furious.

1025
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:42,289
Do I need you to tell me this?

1026
01:03:43,858 --> 01:03:46,909
I can't breathe.

1027
01:03:47,818 --> 01:03:48,871
Really?

1028
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:51,461
Don't worry, if you faint

1029
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:53,009
I'll do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

1030
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,661
Wang Mai Zhi finally figured it out.

1031
01:04:21,764 --> 01:04:22,894
That's not right?

1032
01:04:22,894 --> 01:04:25,177
What's with that paternal
look in your eyes?

1033
01:04:25,177 --> 01:04:26,670
Is that the right reaction?

1034
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:29,521
What's wrong with them being
honest about their feelings?

1035
01:04:29,521 --> 01:04:33,077
it's all fine apart from the fact
that they are still minors.

1036
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,536
Stay apart!

1037
01:04:40,353 --> 01:04:42,304
If Counselor Li sees you

1038
01:04:42,304 --> 01:04:44,021
you'll have to write a repent letter.

1039
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:49,056
Counselor Jiang!

1040
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:51,519
Please don't walk away so quickly!

1041
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:53,193
Get lost!

1042
01:04:54,179 --> 01:04:56,039
We already won the semi-finals.

1043
01:04:56,039 --> 01:04:57,789
What about a candle-lit dinner?

1044
01:04:57,789 --> 01:04:59,500
See?

1045
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,052
He nearly saw you.

1046
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:05,521
Ms. Fang, thanks for covering up for us.

1047
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,382
What is it? You've been pouting.
What are you worried about?

1048
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:31,891
I'm worried about the students
falling in love so early.

1049
01:05:31,891 --> 01:05:33,523
It's not good.

1050
01:05:33,523 --> 01:05:38,224
Do you think that we set
a bad example and affected them?

1051
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,641
When did we set a bad example?

1052
01:05:40,641 --> 01:05:42,902
We're adults. It's normal to be in love.

1053
01:05:42,902 --> 01:05:45,248
The point is that the students
are still minors.

1054
01:05:45,248 --> 01:05:47,925
We keep displaying
public affection in school.

1055
01:05:47,925 --> 01:05:49,739
Would they learn from us?

1056
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:52,601
This is really bad.

1057
01:05:52,601 --> 01:05:55,139
What should we do if the Principal
sees this when he gets back?

1058
01:05:55,139 --> 01:05:59,471
Didn't we say that we're going to report
to the Principal about our relationship?

1059
01:05:59,471 --> 01:06:01,123
You really want me to tell him?

1060
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:05,099
That's not a good idea?
I'm really bad with words.

1061
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:07,018
You're better with words.
Why don't you do it?

1062
01:06:07,018 --> 01:06:08,478
It's not a speech contest.

1063
01:06:08,478 --> 01:06:12,170
Just report to the Principal honestly
about our relationship. That's all.

1064
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:13,614
You make it sound so easy.

1065
01:06:13,614 --> 01:06:16,297
Just the thought of it
makes my palms sweat.

1066
01:06:16,297 --> 01:06:18,398
Is the Principal that scary?

1067
01:06:18,398 --> 01:06:19,835
What are you afraid of?

1068
01:06:19,835 --> 01:06:21,286
You're not scared?

1069
01:06:21,286 --> 01:06:22,704
Why don't you tell him then?

1070
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,302
You're quite good with words?

1071
01:06:27,302 --> 01:06:30,132
I'll leave that to you then.
I feel so relieved.

1072
01:06:30,132 --> 01:06:32,773
- It's a deal.
- No...

1073
01:06:32,773 --> 01:06:34,351
Let's discuss about it, please?

1074
01:06:34,351 --> 01:06:35,824
What did you say?

1075
01:06:35,824 --> 01:06:37,847
Let's discuss about it.

1076
01:06:37,847 --> 01:06:39,030
No.

1077
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:42,768
You're quite pleased to see me nervous?

1078
01:06:45,648 --> 01:06:47,454
All right, I'll stop teasing you.

1079
01:06:47,454 --> 01:06:49,141
If you're really worried

1080
01:06:49,141 --> 01:06:51,284
we can report to the Principal together.

1081
01:06:51,284 --> 01:06:53,748
- Really?
- Yes, I'll be in charge.

1082
01:06:55,721 --> 01:06:59,617
Do you know that I've panicked
about this matter for a long time?

1083
01:06:59,617 --> 01:07:01,992
What's there to panic about? Silly.

1084
01:07:01,992 --> 01:07:03,572
Give me your hand.

1085
01:07:10,242 --> 01:07:11,715
Your turn!

1086
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,766
Is this really okay?

1087
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,398
What's not okay about this?

1088
01:07:27,398 --> 01:07:31,067
Weren't you afraid that
the others will know about it

1089
01:07:31,067 --> 01:07:32,699
and you'll find it embarrassing?

1090
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:34,809
I...

1091
01:07:34,809 --> 01:07:37,757
I have courage now.

1092
01:07:37,757 --> 01:07:39,478
I'm not scared anymore.

1093
01:07:39,478 --> 01:07:40,771
Is that okay?

1094
01:07:40,771 --> 01:07:43,411
In the future, we'll...

1095
01:07:43,411 --> 01:07:45,778
We'll be...

1096
01:07:47,315 --> 01:07:50,110
In the future, you're mine.

1097
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:51,880
Even if the sky comes crashing down

1098
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,831
I'll be there to protect you.

1099
01:07:53,831 --> 01:07:55,090
Get it?

1100
01:07:57,644 --> 01:08:02,172
And in the future,
only I can bully you.

1101
01:08:02,172 --> 01:08:06,983
Only I can hold your hand.

1102
01:08:06,983 --> 01:08:08,987
Hear me?

1103
01:08:08,987 --> 01:08:10,855
Okay.

1104
01:08:12,108 --> 01:08:14,842
Lend me your cell phone.

1105
01:08:38,039 --> 01:08:40,600

1106
01:08:42,997 --> 01:08:45,975
Boy...

1107
01:08:45,975 --> 01:08:47,277
Hello?

1108
01:08:47,277 --> 01:08:49,463
You're not to hide from me

1109
01:08:49,463 --> 01:08:51,554
and you're not to run away
when you see me.

1110
01:08:51,554 --> 01:08:53,484
You also have to answer my calls

1111
01:08:53,484 --> 01:08:57,996
because I am your boyfriend.

1112
01:09:02,199 --> 01:09:06,305
By the way, open up
that amulet I gave you.

1113
01:09:15,413 --> 01:09:17,301
The world's most handsome guy!

1114
01:09:17,301 --> 01:09:20,256
Do you now know how much
effort I've made?

1115
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:23,658
When you were competing,
I was dangling by your chest

1116
01:09:23,658 --> 01:09:24,868
to cheer you on.

1117
01:09:26,403 --> 01:09:27,939
Thank you!

1118
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:31,000
Is it your turn to say thank you?

1119
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,298
It should be my turn.

1120
01:09:33,298 --> 01:09:34,908
Where's my gift?

1121
01:09:34,908 --> 01:09:37,452
But... I didn't prepare any gifts.

1122
01:09:37,452 --> 01:09:41,630
And I've only had NT$100 left
of pocket money this month...

1123
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:43,676
Who wants you to spend your pocket money?

1124
01:09:43,676 --> 01:09:46,024
I want that...

1125
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,721
I want the gift that you
can't get from just a friend.

1126
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:20,882
- Counselor...
- What are you doing?

1127
01:10:22,056 --> 01:10:25,853
Wang Mai Zhi... Wei Qi Zhen!

1128
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:28,668
You're doomed!

1129
01:10:38,849 --> 01:10:45,849
