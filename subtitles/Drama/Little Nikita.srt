1
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,563
Where is he?

2
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,063
He promised.

3
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,134
You know his promises.

4
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,295
He's not gonna miss this, is he?

5
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,973
He'll be here, sweetheart.

6
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:37,799
But...

7
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:38,633
Well, that's okay, Joaquin,

8
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,172
just put them all on
the front of the float.

9
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,673
Where's all the flags?

10
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:42,504
Okay.

11
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:50,515
See ya later.

12
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,249
Jeff, for Gods sake.

13
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:54,082
I'm here.

14
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,452
I'm ready, I'm going.

15
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:56,693
Jeffrey, Jeff.

16
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:57,758
General Grant, right?

17
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:58,587
Get dressed.

18
00:01:58,852 --> 00:01:59,421
I'm getting dressed.

19
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:00,426
Go. Go!

20
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:01,256
He had a beard, you know.

21
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:02,090
Jeffrey.

22
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,165
Never mind, never mind!

23
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,301
I love it, it's fabulous!

24
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,670
Hurry up!

25
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,284
Yes!

26
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,545
That looks like a blue ribbon.

27
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:26,950
You say that every year.

28
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:27,851
I know.

29
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,354
We're right up front between Valley Realty

30
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,390
and Darrell's Body Shop.

31
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:31,822
I'm telling you.

32
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,831
You're not dressed!

33
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:38,796
What do you mean, I'm not dressed?

34
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,060
I'm dressed great.

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,065
This is a parade.

36
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,203
And I'm ready to march.

37
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,066
You look like you're ready to dance.

38
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,310
That outfit does not spell defense.

39
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:47,476
What does it spell?

40
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:48,371
Barbara.

41
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,431
Do you still prefer McDonald's

42
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:10,326
for work experience?

43
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,159
Miguel.

44
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:12,096
McDonald's for work experience?

45
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,029
I'm having second thoughts.

46
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,031
Not now, Miguel.

47
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:14,862
Ms. McLaughlin.

48
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,106
I'm considering Long John Silver's.

49
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,000
I looked into the future
and it may be fish.

50
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:20,006
Miguel, after the parade.

51
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:23,441
I'm busy with other
people's futures right now.

52
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,216
Looks like you're doing
fine, Sergeant Leathers.

53
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,540
I'll be over at the Army booth,

54
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,841
they always need help.

55
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:28,779
And what are you gonna
do after the parade,

56
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:29,611
Ms. McLaughlin?

57
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,615
I think I'm gonna lie down.

58
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,515
Alone?

59
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:34,284
Standby!

60
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,218
Ten-hut!

61
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:07,317
Hey, Jeff.

62
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:08,285
Come on down here.

63
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,117
Jeff.

64
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,224
Hey, what are you guys doing?

65
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,121
Air Force Academy.

66
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,089
They're setting up interviews.

67
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:12,920
We gotta sign up.

68
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,426
Look here, cadet, how many fingers?

69
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:15,392
What, what?

70
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,224
Four, the man said.

71
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:16,991
Correct.

72
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,132
Now, what's the color
of your white jacket?

73
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,563
You've lost it totally.

74
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:20,395
The man said white.

75
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,730
White is A-okay.

76
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:22,996
Certify him for night flying.

77
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:23,831
You're in!

78
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,075
Congratulations, cadet.

79
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,402
Sign right here.

80
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,474
Give me it.

81
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,304
Applicant, that's me.

82
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:31,975
Alright.

83
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,000
What are you doing here?

84
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,900
You shouldn't be here.

85
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,174
What do you want?

86
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,411
Are you crazy?

87
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,177
No!

88
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:13,777
It was the first

89
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:14,609
summit handshake...

90
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:15,886
His tie comes from Paris.

91
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:19,123
Certainly an improvement on Brezhnev.

92
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,016
The suit is Italian.

93
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,728
Madam sends to Milan for her clothes.

94
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,588
What about my roof?

95
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:27,422
Your what?

96
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,893
My...

97
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,963
His cover.

98
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,571
San Diego County Agricultural Exchange.

99
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,410
Do you know the area?

100
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,541
Intimately.

101
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:43,814
When you reach San Diego
you have not only

102
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,084
the FBI to deal with.

103
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,250
Also the Navy Investigative Service,

104
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,986
the Defense Investigative Service,

105
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,723
plus Customs and Immigration officials.

106
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,890
San Diego is very active.

107
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,623
You do understand?

108
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,989
Young man, I was crossing into the west

109
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,824
before you could spell Bolshevik.

110
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,468
A cannon is loose in San Diego.

111
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,263
You'll know him, he belongs to us.

112
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,509
The Americans have coded him Scuba.

113
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,779
Their attempt to be amusing.

114
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,173
You are to apprehend Scuba.

115
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,950
He has killed one of our best agents.

116
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,413
Scuba is an embarrassment to the premier.

117
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,314
The premier prepares for the summit.

118
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,851
A sideshow.

119
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,592
This IRS man was working for us.

120
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,623
Scuba is blackmailing us.

121
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:31,918
He will keep killing our agents

122
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,823
until we give him money.

123
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,930
Return Scuba to Russia alive.

124
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,192
That is your assignment.

125
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,802
You have seen the
dossier on your backups.

126
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,097
I prefer our man in Vancouver.

127
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,275
The operative word is discretion.

128
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,477
No press.

129
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:48,643
No publicity.

130
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,339
No news at all.

131
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,450
What we fear most is the American media.

132
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:59,452
I remember when we used to fear the CIA.

133
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,954
Everything changes, Karpov.

134
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:05,956
This latest series of talks

135
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,825
between the two great superpowers.

136
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,795
Nothing changes.

137
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:11,865
The first historic meeting

138
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,694
between these two world leaders signals

139
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,200
the beginning of a new chapter.

140
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,340
More applications, Roy.

141
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,414
These didn't come up kosher, either.

142
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,277
I say that we've got a run on

143
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,783
the Air Force Academy this year.

144
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,355
That's one way to beat Army.

145
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,963
Chief, you're drowning me in paper.

146
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,426
Stats, Roy, stats.

147
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,396
The inspector's going to pay us a visit.

148
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:19,260
Did you see the thing about

149
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,300
the IRS man at Caliente?

150
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,301
What IRS man?

151
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,041
The one they found
behind the pari-mutuel

152
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,777
with his throat cut.

153
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:30,742
What do you and Totten do in here

154
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,311
every morning at 6 a.m.?

155
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,481
Check the Hong Kong prices?

156
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,549
I know a horseplayer.

157
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,482
Oh, forget about Scuba, Roy.

158
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,950
The man is a burnt out double agent.

159
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,453
Scuba has been turned so many times,

160
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,285
he looks like an omelet.

161
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,564
The man killed my partner.

162
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,633
You don't know if he killed him or not.

163
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:01,805
Jesus, Roy.

164
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,740
That was 20 years ago.

165
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,079
So what?

166
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,075
I gotta go.

167
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,653
I'm presenting the
hole-in-one trophy tonight.

168
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,761
Hey, hang in there, Roy.

169
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,764
Grant.

170
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:26,933
Jeffrey N.

171
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,601
Okay, let's see this kid.

172
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,095
What have we got here?

173
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:39,440
I need a reading on Richard
and Elizabeth Grant.

174
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:40,437
Fountain Grove, California.

175
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,541
Son Jeffrey.

176
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:44,743
Yeah.

177
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,385
It doesn't track for me.

178
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,716
Did these people die or what?

179
00:11:58,952 --> 00:11:59,862
Go Air Force!

180
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,120
Yeah, go, Air Force.

181
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,900
Will you sit down.

182
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:04,794
Turn the radio off.

183
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,071
Look at this guy.

184
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,032
Jeffrey Grant.

185
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,706
Alright!

186
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:15,605
Go get 'em.

187
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:17,974
Good luck, buddy.

188
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:18,806
And remember,

189
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,984
you live in fame, go down in flame!

190
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:22,810
Off we go...

191
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,486
Into the wild blue yonder.

192
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,656
Climbing high into the sun.

193
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,427
Here they come zooming
to meet our thunder.

194
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:31,889
At 'em boys...

195
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,893
Give 'er the gun...

196
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,671
Excuse me, Corporal.

197
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,331
What do you think?

198
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,933
I'm sorry?

199
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,036
Corporal Holden.

200
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,603
Oh, her.

201
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,673
Yeah, she was very nice.

202
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:21,777
Yes, very nice.

203
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,379
Sometimes I slip up and
call her Corporal Hogans.

204
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,975
Roy Howe, Jeff,
Air Force Reserve Liaison.

205
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,484
I'll be conducting your academy interview.

206
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:33,883
You got a wet palm there, son.

207
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,124
What's the matter, nervous?

208
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,155
Yeah, I'm nervous, sir.

209
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,120
What are you nervous about?

210
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,555
I don't know, I want to pass.

211
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,388
There's nothing to pass,
this isn't a test.

212
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:42,496
Relax.

213
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,166
Be yourself.

214
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:45,060
Okay.

215
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,406
You are nervous, aren't you.

216
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:52,335
Why?

217
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,539
Because you told me to be myself.

218
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,371
Whenever people tell me to be myself,

219
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,705
I don't know what to do.

220
00:13:59,005 --> 00:13:59,540
How come?

221
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,820
Because I don't know what myself is.

222
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:05,647
You like girls, Jim?

223
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,016
Jeff.

224
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,350
How do you feel about girls, Jeff?

225
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,354
I love 'em.

226
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,185
You got a girl?

227
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,019
You bet.

228
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:12,853
You have one girl?

229
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:13,687
Yeah.

230
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:14,521
No.

231
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:15,356
Yeah.

232
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:16,861
Yeah, I do have one girl.

233
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:17,691
And I like her a lot.

234
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,095
But I love girls in general.

235
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,766
You're doing fine.

236
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,871
Why do you wanna go to the
Air Force Academy, John?

237
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:28,702
Jeff.

238
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:29,706
Jeff, Jeff.

239
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,381
I hear you.

240
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:36,449
You hear me?

241
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,284
I wanna fly.

242
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,183
I wanna be a pilot.

243
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,755
That's it?

244
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,256
I love my country.

245
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,928
That's all?

246
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:47,857
Hey, what can I tell ya?

247
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:48,929
I gotta fly.

248
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,360
Why?

249
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,102
I like to go fast.

250
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,898
I can see that.

251
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,138
Only three tickets.

252
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,237
In a month.

253
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,099
40 in a 35.

254
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,604
I was on a freeway at five in the morning,

255
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,434
alone on the road.

256
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,610
Oh, you don't deserve the citation.

257
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,607
No!

258
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,608
Yeah, I do.

259
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,951
I drive too fast, but I'm a good driver.

260
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,050
Sorry.

261
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,413
I'm working on it, sir.

262
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:12,485
Work hard.

263
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,215
Yes, sir.

264
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,289
I will, sir.

265
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,890
You suckin' up to me?

266
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:22,895
Yes, sir.

267
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:24,801
No, sir.

268
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:25,728
I...

269
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:30,397
What do your folks say
about your heavy foot?

270
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,075
Dad, you know how fathers are.

271
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,142
No, I don't know how fathers are.

272
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,440
Well, he's not crazy about it.

273
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:40,274
Neither is Mom.

274
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:41,142
I can understand it,

275
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,284
they don't want me to get hurt.

276
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,418
What about your folks?

277
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,418
What about them?

278
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,353
There're not much to tell.

279
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,354
They're Mom and Dad.

280
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,288
They run a garden nursery and...

281
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:53,655
And what?

282
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,159
And I love 'em.

283
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:00,964
What do your folks think about

284
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,830
you're going to the academy?

285
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,166
They don't know about it.

286
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,837
I wanna surprise them
with some good news.

287
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,711
Did I say the wrong thing?

288
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:18,618
No.

289
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,380
Not at all, comrade.

290
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,729
I'm sorry.

291
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,525
I don't understand.

292
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,301
Is that all?

293
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:39,201
For now.

294
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,478
Jeffrey N. Grant.

295
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,839
What does the N stand for?

296
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:47,674
Nicholas.

297
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,351
Nicholas.

298
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,087
You of Greek extraction?

299
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,152
Or is your birthday near to Christmas?

300
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:53,981
I don't know.

301
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:54,816
I used to hate the name.

302
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:55,684
Then I went through this period that

303
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:56,722
that's all I wanted to be called.

304
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:57,551
Nick.

305
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,419
I thought it was tough.

306
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,163
But now I hate it again.

307
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,159
We'll be talking again.

308
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,194
Great.

309
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,558
About something else.

310
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,760
I thought I passed.

311
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:06,934
For now.

312
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:07,761
Blue skies, Jeff.

313
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,041
Happy landings and pack a tight chute.

314
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,378
What was that?

315
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:16,840
No good?

316
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,446
I practiced this morning,
I thought I'd do it.

317
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,115
Now I blew it.

318
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,612
Wasn't too bad.

319
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,684
Bye, Corporal Hogans.

320
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:28,956
Good, Jeff, good.

321
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,192
You must be tired, Comrade Karpov.

322
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,327
No, just have nothing to say.

323
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,496
I still do not understand why

324
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,665
they sent you here.

325
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,732
To get the job done.

326
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,060
I think we should go through the list

327
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,338
of your contacts again.

328
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,163
What for?

329
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,340
To make sure you remember them all.

330
00:19:58,597 --> 00:19:59,667
Even you could forget.

331
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:00,501
I doubt it.

332
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,904
I put them here.

333
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,872
Too bad about our lovely water skier.

334
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,708
She was a good agent.

335
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:13,422
Scuba made contact with you only once.

336
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,283
As I told you, a brief message.

337
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,185
Pay $200,000 or I'll kill

338
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,124
every agent on the list.

339
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,126
Only four more to go.

340
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,935
I heard you gave him
the code name Scuba.

341
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,069
No.

342
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,567
An FBI agent did.

343
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:32,738
But why?

344
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,478
He loves water.

345
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,140
Like a shark.

346
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,645
No, like a rat.

347
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,716
Stop here before we get to the border.

348
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,124
We have organized a pickup
on the other side.

349
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,097
I prefer public transportation.

350
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,166
I guess that's okay,

351
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,495
but I don't have to tell you.

352
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:03,933
No, you don't.

353
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,121
Welcome aboard
the San Diego Trolley.

354
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,489
Bound for the Sante Fe
depot in Center City.

355
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,859
We appreciate having you
on board today

356
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:33,763
and hope you have a pleasant trip.

357
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:57,954
You call taxi?

358
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,333
Are you the man who wants to go

359
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:11,903
to Fountain Grove?

360
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:25,018
They crossed the border yesterday.

361
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:28,087
Turned up in a coffee
shop in Fountain Grove.

362
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,417
He didn't give up on
public transportation, did he?

363
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,694
Meaning?

364
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,327
He was at the Union Station stakeout

365
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,361
in D.C. 20 years ago when Scuba...

366
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:36,257
Oh yeah, right.

367
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,330
Look at that son of a bitch.

368
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,502
He still looks real good.

369
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,403
Why did you ask me in here

370
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:43,765
before everyone else?

371
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,373
Because you're the best, Roy.

372
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:47,939
I should be reporting to you
instead of

373
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,235
the other way around.

374
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,570
Don't stroke me, Jim.

375
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,507
What do you want me to tell you?

376
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,408
That I got Scuba.

377
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:54,684
You know there's a case.

378
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,112
You can feel it inside just like I do.

379
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,547
Karpov is here to get Scuba.

380
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,784
The bureau is maintaining
a hands-off policy.

381
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:03,685
Screw the bureau.

382
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:04,757
What is your policy, Jim?

383
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,085
You know I'm right.

384
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,363
I don't give a damn
whether you're right

385
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,724
or wrong, Roy.

386
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,967
I just wanna see you
get on with your life.

387
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:12,793
Get it resolved.

388
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,129
You owe it to yourself.

389
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,428
So I got Scuba.

390
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,201
Yeah.

391
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,376
You got Scuba, he's all yours.

392
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:22,806
But you're on your own.

393
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,480
It is strictly unofficial.

394
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,978
No one but me knows about it.

395
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:28,979
Understand?

396
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:33,915
Thanks, Jim.

397
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:40,764
Don't forget your
Air Force applications.

398
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,499
So...

399
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:53,997
They spotted him in a coffee shop

400
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,295
in Fountain Grove.

401
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:57,973
Fountain Grove?

402
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,208
Wait a minute.

403
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:01,862
What's the big deal?

404
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,265
I'm just applying for traffic school.

405
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,802
Down the hall, Grant.

406
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:05,802
Room one.

407
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:06,701
Please.

408
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,308
All I want is Saturday's class.

409
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,637
If I don't get in,
I don't get my license back.

410
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:11,880
Sorry, Grant.

411
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:12,774
Room one.

412
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,248
Room one.

413
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:26,756
Hello, Jeff.

414
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:27,757
Hi, Major.

415
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,896
What are you doing here?

416
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,930
Let's take a ride.

417
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,066
Take a ride?

418
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,429
Take a ride where?

419
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,935
Why do I wanna take a ride with you for?

420
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,107
Because I asked you to.

421
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:47,343
Did you read it?

422
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:48,811
I'll show you my I.D.

423
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,587
It gets me a beer in a disco
in Encinitas.

424
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:51,651
What does yours get you?

425
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,423
Mine gets me this.

426
00:26:57,182 --> 00:27:00,857
I could fix the license
but not that picture.

427
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:03,964
Am I under arrest?

428
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:05,360
What for, did you do something wrong?

429
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,192
No.

430
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:07,300
What's the matter then?

431
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:08,128
Nothing.

432
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:12,034
Relax, I just wanna
ask you a few questions.

433
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:15,607
See that storefront over there?

434
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,506
That's Congressman
Larkin's suburban office.

435
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,180
Someone in there is selling
nominations

436
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,508
to the service academies.

437
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,218
If someone's selling,
someone's buying.

438
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:24,954
Bingo, A plus.

439
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,781
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

440
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,350
How long have you known
Tony Stanton

441
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,856
and Tom Stubblefield?

442
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,358
All my life, they're my friends.

443
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,064
Friends have a way of changing.

444
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:36,992
Now wait a minute.

445
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:38,461
How about their parents?

446
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:39,794
Their parents are my friends too.

447
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,196
If you think someone did
something funny,

448
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,302
go talk to someone else.

449
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,570
Okay.

450
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,848
Which brings us to the Grants.

451
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:56,983
Folks working late?

452
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,050
Yeah, they're in the potting shed.

453
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:02,017
I guess the mushrooms are coming up.

454
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,156
Can I go now?

455
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,393
Keep your ears open.

456
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,890
You mean sneak around my friends?

457
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,756
You wanna go to the Air Force
Academy, don't you?

458
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,228
You think it's fair for
a guy to buy his way in?

459
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,594
Take your place?

460
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,200
Oh, no, no.

461
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:16,097
Okay.

462
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,217
And don't mention anything
to your folks.

463
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:33,546
What do you mean?

464
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,620
Let's just keep this between us.

465
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:36,551
Why?

466
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:40,189
You wanted to surprise your
parents, didn't you?

467
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,726
Yeah.

468
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,623
Okay.

469
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:46,732
And Jeff?

470
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:51,805
I'm glad you got your license back.

471
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,082
Oh, this is pretty.

472
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:03,648
I think I'll take this one too.

473
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:04,784
No, if I take this one,

474
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,055
I'll have to have another one.

475
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,722
Oh, that one!

476
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,459
That one over there.

477
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,423
Jeffrey.

478
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,425
Jeff.

479
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:16,426
Jeff, Jeff!

480
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,260
Did I tell you fruit trees?

481
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,092
Fruit trees?

482
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:20,335
I thought this was a cactus sale.

483
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:21,627
I wanna dress it up a little bit

484
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:22,803
with a pair of dwarf persimmons.

485
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,073
Dwarf persimmons?

486
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,899
Fruit trees for short people.

487
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,940
Bring out a Mexican old man.

488
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,077
Now I'm a social worker.

489
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,178
You can take these right
to the cashier.

490
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:33,472
Alright.

491
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,410
Thank you very much.

492
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:39,012
There's nothing to be
afraid of with plants, sir.

493
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:39,846
I know what's coming.

494
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:40,919
Talk to them.

495
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,590
I don't wanna talk to them.

496
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:44,020
But I will water.

497
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:44,953
But not a whole lot, however.

498
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,196
I don't have the time.

499
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,090
How is the light in your nook?

500
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:49,923
Don't start that.

501
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,098
That's what the last guy asked me

502
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,926
and I was doing sun studies
for a month.

503
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:57,139
I guess what I'm looking
for is something fat.

504
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,102
A fat plant?

505
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,002
All fat with leaves.

506
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,835
Bushy?

507
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:02,669
You tell me.

508
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:03,810
Hold on, hold on.

509
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:05,172
Richard?

510
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,507
The gentleman is looking
for a fat plant

511
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,683
to fill a nook, lots of leaves.

512
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:10,510
And he doesn't want to worry

513
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,015
about water or light.

514
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:12,846
Plastic.

515
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:13,680
You want a plastic plant.

516
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:14,514
K-Mart.

517
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,621
No, I don't want plastic.

518
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:16,450
I want real.

519
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:17,352
Excuse me.

520
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,151
What are you doing, mister?

521
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:19,986
What do you think I'm doing?

522
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,958
Not what I told you to do.

523
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,665
You told me to find
the Mexican old man.

524
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:24,797
That's not a Mexican old man.

525
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:25,865
That's a candelabra cactus.

526
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,365
Now put it back, put it back.

527
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,906
What is this?

528
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,684
That's a meditation tree,
they're from India.

529
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,509
To help you relax.

530
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,152
That's for me.

531
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:45,979
What do you think, son.

532
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,245
Will it help me relax?

533
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,025
Certainly hope so.

534
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,028
Now, let them off there, folks.

535
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:55,025
Then come on aboard,
they're really biting today.

536
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,321
What'd you get, Richard?

537
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,693
Bonita, sheepshead, mackerel, bass.

538
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,333
What about you, Jeff?

539
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:01,866
Tell him, Jeff, tell him.

540
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,695
Tell him what?

541
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,371
Tell him what you got.

542
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:06,199
I got a tire and a tin can.

543
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:07,374
Hey, next time.

544
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,907
Okay, hit the smoker, anglers.

545
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:10,907
Oh, thanks.

546
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:26,887
Eight pounds.

547
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,459
Okay.

548
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:29,858
Where's Aurelio?

549
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:31,533
Yeah, three-time loser.

550
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,530
Border patrol grabbed him.

551
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,795
Someone blew the whistle on him.

552
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:36,731
Hello.

553
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:39,806
I like your new helper.

554
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:40,974
Yeah, he's Joe.

555
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,438
Yugo out of Vancouver.

556
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,269
Wouldn't you believe it.

557
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,774
Talks less English than Aurelio.

558
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,242
Why don't you just get
another bracero?

559
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:47,812
I don't know, this guy
just showed up.

560
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:48,948
I'll see ya in a couple weeks, Bucky.

561
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,481
Yo, Richard.

562
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:53,450
Do you have a file on Jeffrey Grant?

563
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,281
What kind of file?

564
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,217
Grades.

565
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,819
Extracurricular activities going back,

566
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,494
say a couple years.

567
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:05,126
Why would I show you
Jeffrey Grant's file!

568
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,934
I'm FBI.

569
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:13,807
You could be NFL for all I care.

570
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:14,736
Please.

571
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:17,742
Good kid?

572
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:18,981
Straight A's.

573
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,114
Tells his friends he gets C's.

574
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:22,350
Wonderful kid.

575
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:25,316
What about his parents?

576
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,250
PTA, the Rotary, the United Way.

577
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,155
They love their kid,
their kid loves them.

578
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,327
It's a close family.

579
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,255
Close?

580
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:37,128
Pardon?

581
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,331
It's close in here.

582
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,705
If there's no window,
there's no air.

583
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:46,975
An old saying.

584
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,105
Well, that do it for you?

585
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,613
How'd a pretty girl
like you get mixed up

586
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,617
in guidance counseling?

587
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,660
How'd a nice guy like
you get mixed up in FBI?

588
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:06,622
You ever guided any students

589
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,523
towards the bureau, Verna?

590
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,060
I hope not.

591
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,893
How about me guiding you
towards dinner?

592
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,682
Richard!

593
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:40,659
Mom?

594
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,525
You okay, Mom?

595
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:46,698
Mom?

596
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,715
Looks like a one dash.

597
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:20,546
No.

598
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,482
Dash one.

599
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:26,827
Two three...

600
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,768
Six seven eight nine dash one.

601
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:44,238
Kirov opening.

602
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:10,770
Okay, Cindy, go get the ball.

603
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:11,870
Diego, the ring.

604
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,609
Starbuck, the block.

605
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,308
Okay, good girl, Cindy.

606
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,104
Great, guys.

607
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,475
That a boy, good boy, Diego.

608
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,582
Yeah, that's a good boy.

609
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,659
Where'd this come from?

610
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,988
Where'd you get this,
you little devil?

611
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:37,459
There's a body
in the water!

612
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,134
Call the harbor police!

613
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:41,961
Let's get the police!

614
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:21,861
Jeff!

615
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,667
What happened?

616
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:25,703
Is he hurt?

617
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:26,771
Oh, honey.

618
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:28,570
Are you okay?

619
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:29,402
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

620
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:30,839
Fine, I'm fine.

621
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,012
Howdy, folks.

622
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,374
Roy Parmenter here.

623
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:34,741
Your new neighbor from
across the street.

624
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,848
Oh, I'm Richard Grant.

625
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,947
This is my wife, Elizabeth.

626
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:41,121
And this is our son, Jeffrey.

627
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,015
Are you okay, Jeff?

628
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,260
Yeah, yeah, fine.

629
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:48,897
Have we met somewhere?

630
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:49,961
You look so familiar.

631
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:50,790
Sure.

632
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:54,366
I swung by once to buy
a plant for my office.

633
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:55,696
Hi, Jeff.

634
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,938
Put her there.

635
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,302
Oh, now that's what I call
a handshake!

636
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,543
And I could use
the other hand too.

637
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,245
Help me load in over there,
know what I mean?

638
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:05,206
I don't think so.

639
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,074
He'd love to, Mr. Parmenter.

640
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:07,907
Call me Roy.

641
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:09,116
May I call you Richard?

642
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,408
And you're Betty, right?

643
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:11,948
Elizabeth's good enough.

644
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,483
What happened to Sergeant Juckett?

645
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,223
Oh, he got transferred
back to Paris Island.

646
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,458
Lucky me, hey.

647
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:18,757
I pay well.

648
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,893
You don't have to pay
Jeff a thing.

649
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,324
You're in Fountain Grove
now, Roy.

650
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,964
Oh, and it's real pleasant
to be here.

651
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,496
Where do you hail from?

652
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:27,769
Philadelphia.

653
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:28,935
Navy.

654
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:31,833
I write specs for ships and they

655
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,132
transferred me out here.

656
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,342
Talk about a break.

657
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:36,976
Oh, great weather, San Diego.

658
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:38,774
And nice neighbors.

659
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,013
And someone to shoot baskets with.

660
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:45,288
You ready to go one-on-one, Jeff?

661
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:46,418
Nope.

662
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:47,816
Jeff.

663
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:48,647
Come along now.

664
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,654
Help out Mr. Parmenter.

665
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,534
What the hell are you doing here?

666
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,637
Every time I turn around
you're around.

667
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,341
Just trying to get to
the bottom of something.

668
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:08,940
Yeah, well, the last
guy kept running into me

669
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,202
accidentally on purpose
was Maurice.

670
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,004
A waiter I bussed for
at the country club.

671
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,146
You gay, Roy?

672
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:15,315
Can't say as I am.

673
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:16,141
Then why the hell are you breathing

674
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:17,215
down my neck?

675
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,043
Go live with Tom.

676
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:18,878
Go live at Tony's.

677
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,178
They have pools in the neighborhood.

678
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,219
Please, get off my block.

679
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,015
Ease this baby a little to the left.

680
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,219
What the hell kind of investigation
is this anyway.

681
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,225
Are you gonna tell me or aren't you?

682
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,830
You're asking all the
right questions, Jeff.

683
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:34,330
Something big is coming down.

684
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:55,717
Come on, Dad.

685
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:58,585
I'm coming, I'm coming.

686
00:41:58,883 --> 00:41:59,418
Hi, Bill.

687
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:00,252
Hi, girls.

688
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,086
Hi.

689
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:03,093
You girls gonna say hi?

690
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,225
Now look both ways.

691
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,433
I wanna go on the slide.

692
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,101
Me too, me too.

693
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:32,117
Dad, can you get in trouble
with the IRS

694
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:35,523
if you don't report
all of your cash sales?

695
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:37,528
It's impossible to report all of them.

696
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:38,961
Why, you gonna turn me in?

697
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:41,259
Never in a million years.

698
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:45,770
Have you ever been arrested?

699
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,372
No.

700
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:49,373
Now why would you wanna know that?

701
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:51,045
Oh, just curious.

702
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,882
Are you trying to
tell me something, Jeff?

703
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:54,775
No, why?

704
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,917
What do you mean?

705
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:01,379
What's on your mind, Jeff?

706
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:03,057
How about everything?

707
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,385
Can we narrow it down
a little bit?

708
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:06,993
See, now you're making
fun of me.

709
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:07,820
C'mon, Jeffrey.

710
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,120
Relax.

711
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,458
Can't worry about the whole world.

712
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:13,758
Okay, Dad.

713
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,265
I'll just stick to our block.

714
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:18,468
Hey!

715
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:31,818
And it's fruit juice
for Mr. Morose.

716
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,180
Thank you.

717
00:43:33,478 --> 00:43:35,754
See you guys in a bit, okay?

718
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:37,185
Do you wanna watch the movie?

719
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:38,119
No.

720
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,826
Were you troubled at home, Roy?

721
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,191
I had a great home.

722
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:47,026
I can't imagine you as a kid.

723
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:49,999
Oh, I was a wonderful kid.

724
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:51,697
What did your father do?

725
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:52,633
Cop.

726
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:55,638
Good cop or bad cop?

727
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:56,536
Bad cop.

728
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:00,180
Wouldn't kiss ass.

729
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,779
Good father.

730
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,513
You're making me revise
my opinion of the FBI.

731
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:16,794
Barbara?

732
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:20,563
You don't have to say anything.

733
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:23,838
You love me?

734
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,975
Only two left, Konstantin.

735
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:43,547
The money, comrade.

736
00:45:43,808 --> 00:45:44,445
The money.

737
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:07,304
Jesus.

738
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:16,614
Come on, give me the ball.

739
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:17,681
That's 11.

740
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:22,123
Don't you have to win by two?

741
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:24,017
I already won by four.

742
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:30,327
Want something cold to drink?

743
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,292
What have ya got?

744
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:33,330
Everything, help yourself.

745
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,763
I got chips to go with that.

746
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,209
Jeffrey Nicholas Grant.

747
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:44,536
Well, that sounds official.

748
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,372
Your parents are Russian spies.

749
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,448
Your parents are KGB agents.

750
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:51,550
Sleepers, they're called.

751
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:52,377
Deep cover.

752
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:54,046
They blend with the country

753
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:54,880
they're assigned to.

754
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,022
Own homes, hold jobs, raise families.

755
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,316
They sleep for years.

756
00:46:58,616 --> 00:47:01,392
But when they awake, they're lethal.

757
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:03,996
Let's go back to your Air
Force Academy investigation.

758
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,665
What happened to that?

759
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:06,696
What about it?

760
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,471
What happened to your investigation?

761
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:11,138
There wasn't any.

762
00:47:12,697 --> 00:47:14,335
Richard and Elizabeth
Grant entered this country

763
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:15,167
through Canada.

764
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:16,467
Took their IDs off headstones in

765
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:17,576
a Spokane cemetery.

766
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,314
Three years later, you were born.

767
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:22,915
Wanna see your birth certificate?

768
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,083
No, thanks.

769
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:30,486
Sure you don't want some chips?

770
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,762
I exist on corn chips and jalapenos.

771
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,589
I'm not too swift around a stove.

772
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,567
Your dad loved western music.

773
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:46,197
Hustled Beatles records
in Central Army Park.

774
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:47,874
What they call a fartsovsnchi,

775
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:49,371
black marketeer.

776
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:51,510
Can you spell that for me?

777
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:55,073
He did two years
in Lubyanka prison

778
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,784
then they shipped him to Gaczyna,

779
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:58,553
KGB's Quantico.

780
00:47:58,843 --> 00:48:00,686
Dad liked Gaczyna better.

781
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,183
That's where he met Mom.

782
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:04,084
I see.

783
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:07,122
Your mother was a dancer in the

784
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:09,227
Bolshoi Children's School.

785
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,591
She toured the U.S. when
she was 17.

786
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,259
Picked up English so fast
and so well,

787
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:18,438
they shipped her to Gaczyna,
American Department.

788
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,975
A marriage was approved.

789
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:28,881
KGB likes husband-wife teams.

790
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,821
Are you finished?

791
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:39,594
I'd like to go home.

792
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,496
Go ahead.

793
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:43,424
Okay.

794
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,002
Hi.

795
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:51,132
I'm Larry.

796
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,134
This is my brother Daryl.

797
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,808
This is my other brother Daryl.

798
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:48,528
Hey, Jeff.

799
00:50:12,243 --> 00:50:13,153
Hello?

800
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,218
Hello?

801
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:15,320
Who is this?

802
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:25,426
Hello?

803
00:50:25,723 --> 00:50:26,827
Barbara, I gotta see you.

804
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:27,933
What's wrong?

805
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:29,260
I'm leaving, I gotta get outta here.

806
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,095
Calm down.

807
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:30,997
What's going on?

808
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:32,741
I don't know anymore.

809
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:33,906
I just wanna run away.

810
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:34,733
What happened?

811
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:35,567
You get another ticket?

812
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:36,401
I wish.

813
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,008
Listen, Barbara.

814
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:39,213
Will you come with me?

815
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:41,540
I can't leave now.

816
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:42,715
I thought you loved me.

817
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:43,542
Don't do that.

818
00:50:43,841 --> 00:50:44,945
That's not fair.

819
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:47,253
Yeah, you're right.

820
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:48,250
I'm sorry.

821
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:49,547
Go home, please.

822
00:50:49,847 --> 00:50:50,587
Yeah, I will.

823
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:51,791
You promise?

824
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:53,026
I do.

825
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:54,922
Listen, get some rest.

826
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:57,028
I love you.

827
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:36,795
You had me there for a moment.

828
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:46,739
What time will you be home?

829
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:48,984
Five, six, something like that.

830
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:50,013
Could you be a little more specific?

831
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:53,083
I get tired of cooking dinner twice.

832
00:51:53,344 --> 00:51:55,654
I'm gonna take my
truck to the shop, Mom.

833
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,857
Your truck, again?

834
00:51:58,148 --> 00:51:58,683
It's my clutch.

835
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:00,018
My clutch is all mushy.

836
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:01,421
Remember, I told you about it.

837
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:02,595
What about it?

838
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:03,957
The lining for the clutch.

839
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:04,857
Brett's gonna do the work for me.

840
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:06,532
He only needs $50 for the parts.

841
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:07,427
$50?

842
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:10,035
I gave you $50 for your truck
last month.

843
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:10,998
I told you about it, Mom.

844
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:11,864
You said okay.

845
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:12,970
I didn't say okay.

846
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:14,867
You didn't say okay,
she said okay.

847
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:15,700
What are we doing here?

848
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,671
Sitting in Parliament?

849
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:17,877
Might as well.

850
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:18,703
Forget the clutch.

851
00:52:19,003 --> 00:52:19,538
Forget you promised me.

852
00:52:19,837 --> 00:52:21,145
I'll just strip my gears
and scrap my 4x4.

853
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:22,041
Hey, hold on.

854
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:22,874
I gotta go.

855
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:23,708
Jeff.

856
00:52:24,008 --> 00:52:24,543
You know what it takes to run

857
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:25,377
that truck of yours.

858
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:26,211
Do you have any idea
what a teenagers

859
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,319
insurance costs?

860
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:31,058
Do you know what a promise is?

861
00:52:32,116 --> 00:52:33,220
What promise?

862
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,656
Mom promised me
she'd advance me $50.

863
00:52:35,953 --> 00:52:36,727
Okay, now she's unpromising.

864
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:37,624
Dad's right, Jeff.

865
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,128
It wasn't a promise.

866
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:40,130
Forget the truth.

867
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:41,563
Why bother with the truth.

868
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:42,530
Where'd that word come from?

869
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,361
Exactly.

870
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:44,401
What's truth got to do with it?

871
00:52:44,695 --> 00:52:46,470
Truth has no meaning in this house.

872
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:47,299
You're yelling, Jeffrey.

873
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:48,372
I'm not yelling at you.

874
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:49,303
I'm yelling at her.

875
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:50,135
Lower your voice, Jeff.

876
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:51,209
Act like a human being.

877
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:52,503
That's right, I'm an animal.

878
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:54,840
Well, this animal tells the truth.

879
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:56,345
Alright, apologize to your mother

880
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,516
and then you apologize to me.

881
00:52:57,808 --> 00:52:58,343
I will not.

882
00:52:58,642 --> 00:52:59,643
You're both liars.

883
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:00,854
You watch, you watch
what you're saying.

884
00:53:01,145 --> 00:53:01,748
Glad to.

885
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:03,320
You're both a pair of fucking liars.

886
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,650
Go on!

887
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,019
- Hit the animal!
- Stop it!

888
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:09,388
- Hit the animal!
- Stop, for God's sake!

889
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,769
Go to school, Jeffrey.

890
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:25,744
Here's $40.

891
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,212
It's all I have until
I get to the bank.

892
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:31,281
I'll leave $10 with Mrs. Valdez

893
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:32,110
in the principal's office.

894
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:32,944
I think I got $10.

895
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:33,846
It's okay, it's okay, Dad.

896
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:35,454
It's okay, Dad.

897
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:37,054
You can't go around
with a busted clutch.

898
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,122
You'll have an accident.

899
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:43,690
Here's your lunch.

900
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:53,102
Thanks.

901
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:36,277
On your starboard,

902
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,985
notice those cigar shapes
over there?

903
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,256
Those aren't cigars,
ladies and gentlemen.

904
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:43,082
They're nuclear subs.

905
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:46,323
The big mamas next to them,

906
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:47,755
they're tenders.

907
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,292
Floating machine shops
that keep these

908
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:51,930
deadly defenders
of our underseas...

909
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:39,006
Did you check your
personal belongings, folks?

910
00:55:39,303 --> 00:55:41,180
Watch your step off the gangplank.

911
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:42,814
Carry on, mates.

912
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,849
Remember to tell your friends
about the SS Margarita.

913
00:55:46,143 --> 00:55:47,178
Bye, everybody.

914
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:50,685
Hey, friend.

915
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:52,153
The tour's over.

916
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:54,487
The next cruise is two hours away.

917
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,992
Are you trying to beat
the price of a ticket?

918
00:55:57,254 --> 00:55:57,823
They've tried that before,

919
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:59,260
it's not gonna work.

920
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:01,035
Hey, do you hear me?

921
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:16,715
Dead.

922
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:17,610
Dead.

923
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:20,416
Dead.

924
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:23,553
Dead.

925
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:26,189
Dead.

926
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:43,037
Jesus.

927
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:47,244
I just saw this guy the other day.

928
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:49,539
Did he talk with you?

929
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:50,580
No.

930
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:51,409
What about your father.

931
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:52,311
Did he talk to him?

932
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:55,488
No, I don't think he spoke English.

933
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:57,224
He just gave us our fish.

934
00:56:57,481 --> 00:56:58,391
What fish?

935
00:56:58,649 --> 00:56:59,252
Smoked fish.

936
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:02,655
We traded our catch for the smoked fish.

937
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:09,296
What do my parents have
to do with all of this?

938
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:10,731
You remember I told you
about sleepers,

939
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:12,302
the inactive agents?

940
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,303
They were all sleepers.

941
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:18,309
Your parents are the only two left.

942
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,513
Well, who's killing all these people?

943
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:22,408
Us?

944
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:23,947
No, of course not.

945
00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:26,915
A renegade Soviet agent
named Scuba.

946
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:29,487
Oh, this is too much.

947
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,657
What do you want from me?

948
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:33,989
Stay around the house.

949
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,092
Watch them.

950
00:57:35,352 --> 00:57:36,422
Look out for new faces.

951
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:39,759
Someone's got to contact them.

952
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,934
Spy on my parents?

953
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:44,035
You've gotta be kidding me.

954
00:57:44,328 --> 00:57:47,207
You want me to help you
put 'em away.

955
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:48,134
Never.

956
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:51,675
Look, Jeff.

957
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:52,606
I know it's hard.

958
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:55,509
But you're gonna have to
face the facts.

959
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,308
Look, Mr. FBI man.

960
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:59,177
If you're so sure,
and if you're so right,

961
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,854
then why don't you arrest them?

962
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:06,618
Because they haven't done
anything yet.

963
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:08,885
You manipulating son of a bitch.

964
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:09,994
Calm down.

965
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:11,830
You don't have much choice.

966
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:13,294
They could be next.

967
00:58:13,557 --> 00:58:14,194
Wouldn't break your heart.

968
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,868
They're just bait for
your Scuba guy, right?

969
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,832
All you care about is nailing him.

970
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:21,166
You can come and identify
the bodies.

971
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:50,998
Good evening.

972
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,111
We can't help you.

973
00:58:59,403 --> 00:59:02,384
We haven't done anything
for 20 years.

974
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,013
I know what you haven't done.

975
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,847
That is precisely what makes you

976
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:10,853
so valuable right now.

977
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:14,027
Comrade Karpov,
we are at your disposal.

978
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:15,388
But we're ill-equipped.

979
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:17,460
Just follow the story.

980
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:21,959
It's all right there
in front of you.

981
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:26,630
A prick of a thorn and
the princess sleeps.

982
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:30,271
And many years later,

983
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:33,874
the handsome prince awakens her.

984
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:36,713
It's all quite simple.

985
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:37,772
It's a true ensemble, the Kirov.

986
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:41,775
I prefer it to the stars
of the Bolshoi,

987
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:44,109
don't you agree, Elizabeth?

988
01:01:17,574 --> 01:01:18,416
We can't!

989
01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:20,247
Don't you see?

990
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:21,648
We can't anymore.

991
01:01:21,912 --> 01:01:23,721
It's been too long.

992
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:25,084
We can't serve you now.

993
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:27,089
We are of no use.

994
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:28,158
We can't.

995
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:29,829
Please understand, we can't.

996
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:32,362
Elizabeth is understandably
upset.

997
01:01:32,656 --> 01:01:34,033
But why be upset?

998
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:38,765
You're merely going to pay
a man some money.

999
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,877
How much money?

1000
01:01:51,608 --> 01:01:53,246
What kind of man?

1001
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:54,078
Scuba.

1002
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,617
Who?

1003
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:58,415
Your old classmate from Gaczyna.

1004
01:01:58,715 --> 01:01:59,352
Gaczyna.

1005
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,795
English.

1006
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:09,532
English.

1007
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:15,600
English.

1008
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,142
Please.

1009
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:22,378
I almost forgot.

1010
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:26,413
I brought you a little something.

1011
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:27,654
From Beriozka.

1012
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:32,222
The good Beriozka on Gorky Street.

1013
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,224
How is...

1014
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,229
What is his name, Jeff?

1015
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:46,766
It's a good likeness,
don't you think?

1016
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:55,567
Don't shoot!

1017
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,672
Ms. McLaughlin.

1018
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:02,316
Is this work experience?

1019
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:06,044
Go out in the yard.

1020
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,152
I'll be out in a minute.

1021
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,652
Life's little surprises.

1022
01:04:15,919 --> 01:04:16,590
No problem.

1023
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:17,887
I'll just go topless for the rest

1024
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:19,667
of the student body.

1025
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,545
What are their names?

1026
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:38,017
It's not important.

1027
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:38,843
What are their names?

1028
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:41,180
What are my parents' names?

1029
01:04:42,846 --> 01:04:44,519
Elizabeth Lazarova.

1030
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:47,895
Mikhail Stropovich.

1031
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,390
And what's my name?

1032
01:04:49,686 --> 01:04:50,221
Jeff.

1033
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,693
That's not a Russian name.

1034
01:04:52,956 --> 01:04:53,866
You took a walk tonight, didn't you?

1035
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:57,970
You found something you
didn't wanna find, right?

1036
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,309
Battle of Stalingrad.

1037
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:14,217
Probably belonged to one
of their fathers.

1038
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:15,649
They're pretty common.

1039
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:17,390
So many men went down.

1040
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:20,127
Hey, do I detect a
little admiration there?

1041
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:21,157
For who?

1042
01:05:21,451 --> 01:05:21,986
Your parents?

1043
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:22,820
Yeah.

1044
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:23,756
Why?

1045
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,233
'Cause they had you.

1046
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,092
Spare me the violins, G-Man.

1047
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:30,598
No violins.

1048
01:05:30,894 --> 01:05:31,929
Just a lot of hard work.

1049
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:33,138
You gotta be crazy to bring a child

1050
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,670
into this ugly world.

1051
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:36,466
What's so hard about it?

1052
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,609
Making a buck, raising a family.

1053
01:05:38,902 --> 01:05:41,007
Keeping it all together takes talent.

1054
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:41,941
Love.

1055
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:49,853
Put these back where
you found them.

1056
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:51,784
Back to business, huh?

1057
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:54,527
G-Man's on to something big.

1058
01:05:54,818 --> 01:05:56,297
I'm trying to look out for you.

1059
01:05:56,586 --> 01:05:57,656
Don't give me that crap.

1060
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:58,523
You're out for yourself.

1061
01:05:58,822 --> 01:05:59,766
The big collar, the major bust.

1062
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:02,264
The two-bit G-Man will
shove it up your ass.

1063
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:03,765
Hey, hey, hey, hey, easy!

1064
01:06:04,027 --> 01:06:05,802
You're not my father.

1065
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:08,041
You're not even my friend.

1066
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,240
Now we have to tell him.

1067
01:06:44,534 --> 01:06:45,171
No, no.

1068
01:06:46,903 --> 01:06:48,177
It would destroy him.

1069
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:49,006
You're wrong.

1070
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:51,046
He would understand,
I know he would.

1071
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:52,649
We must send him away.

1072
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:53,478
Where?

1073
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,347
I don't know.

1074
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:56,316
We should call Bill.

1075
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:58,024
Have him put everything in Jeff's name.

1076
01:06:58,314 --> 01:06:59,418
It always was.

1077
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:01,993
You knew this would happen?

1078
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:03,230
We both did.

1079
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,195
I'll never regret it.

1080
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,264
We had Jeff.

1081
01:07:09,826 --> 01:07:11,669
I don't think it's over.

1082
01:07:11,928 --> 01:07:13,066
Oh, yes it is.

1083
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:15,774
It can never be the same.

1084
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:17,669
We could run with Jeff.

1085
01:07:17,934 --> 01:07:20,175
It wouldn't be fair to him.

1086
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:24,048
He has his whole life ahead of him.

1087
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:30,586
We have to tell him.

1088
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:36,189
He probably wouldn't believe us.

1089
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:39,756
How could he?

1090
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:00,247
Hi, Mom.

1091
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:01,487
Hi, Dad.

1092
01:08:01,778 --> 01:08:03,758
How was the ballet?

1093
01:08:04,047 --> 01:08:05,082
Very nice.

1094
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:05,882
Dad?

1095
01:08:06,149 --> 01:08:08,459
Yeah, it was very nice.

1096
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,958
Well, I think I'll turn in.

1097
01:08:12,055 --> 01:08:14,626
How's the new clutch?

1098
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:15,561
Great.

1099
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:20,135
Here, I almost forgot your change.

1100
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:30,944
What's my name?

1101
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:34,310
Come on, Dad.

1102
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:36,346
What could the head of
the Grant family have

1103
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:40,355
to hide from his first
and oldest and only son?

1104
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:43,490
What's my name?

1105
01:08:46,318 --> 01:08:47,490
Nika.

1106
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:54,631
J. Nicholas Grant.

1107
01:08:54,931 --> 01:08:55,534
Nick.

1108
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:00,040
Nikita.

1109
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:09,218
Hello.

1110
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,223
Your moment has come.

1111
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:16,023
I told you we're not ready.

1112
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:19,789
You've had 20 years to get ready.

1113
01:09:20,056 --> 01:09:21,000
Who is it?

1114
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:21,825
It's him.

1115
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:23,297
Let's get outta here.

1116
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:24,697
It's too late.

1117
01:09:26,396 --> 01:09:27,841
How about if you give us time?

1118
01:09:28,131 --> 01:09:29,201
Hang up the phone.

1119
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:30,534
How can we prevail?

1120
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,073
For God's sakes, Dad!

1121
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:33,574
We beseech you.

1122
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:37,308
Your discipline is sorely wanting.

1123
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,814
The directorate will be most unhappy.

1124
01:09:40,076 --> 01:09:42,556
You must go to work immediately.

1125
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,153
And if we don't?

1126
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,085
If we choose not to.

1127
01:09:48,084 --> 01:09:49,586
If we have the strength
to turn our back

1128
01:09:49,886 --> 01:09:52,230
on Elizabeth's father and my mother!

1129
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:53,159
Roy!

1130
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:55,230
Roy!

1131
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:58,434
Roy!

1132
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,070
Roy!

1133
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:06,745
You have neither the
strength nor the choice.

1134
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,413
They are both dead.

1135
01:10:12,075 --> 01:10:13,019
Our parents are dead.

1136
01:10:13,276 --> 01:10:13,913
Yes.

1137
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:19,091
And to answer your next question,

1138
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:20,087
of old age.

1139
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:22,293
Roy!

1140
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:25,293
Now, are you ready to proceed?

1141
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:26,123
Roy!

1142
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:28,299
Give me your answer.

1143
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:29,126
The answer is no.

1144
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:29,960
Roy!

1145
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:31,237
Roy, where are you?

1146
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:32,471
It's me, Jeff.

1147
01:10:33,463 --> 01:10:36,034
Then we will have to skip
a generation.

1148
01:10:36,299 --> 01:10:36,936
Roy!

1149
01:10:43,139 --> 01:10:44,277
Come in, Nikita.

1150
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:45,211
Sit down.

1151
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:50,480
Oh, my God.

1152
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:53,151
No, no, not God.

1153
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:54,257
Just Nikita.

1154
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:58,995
You will make contact
this morning at 5:30.

1155
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:00,494
Meanwhile, Nikita and I will

1156
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:02,428
keep each other company.

1157
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:03,328
Please.

1158
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:08,265
Please, Konstantin
Ivanovich, I beg of you.

1159
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:10,507
Leave Jeff.

1160
01:11:12,235 --> 01:11:13,680
Anything you say!

1161
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:15,244
You have heard what I said.

1162
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:18,179
5:30 a.m. the G Street Pier.

1163
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:19,748
You give him the money.

1164
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:23,346
The boy, he is charming.

1165
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:25,956
He looks just like his mother.

1166
01:11:31,254 --> 01:11:33,325
You speak Russian, Nikita?

1167
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:35,497
No.

1168
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,138
And the name's Jeff.

1169
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:39,303
Jeff?

1170
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:41,969
To me, you're Nikita.

1171
01:11:42,265 --> 01:11:44,302
And I am Konstantin.

1172
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,637
You may call me tovarich.

1173
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:49,644
It's our Russian word for friend.

1174
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:55,050
Do you have another
cigarette, Konstantin?

1175
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:57,153
You smoke, Nikita?

1176
01:11:57,446 --> 01:12:00,154
What would the Surgeon General say?

1177
01:12:03,286 --> 01:12:04,788
Russian cigarettes.

1178
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:09,527
You will acquire the taste, Nikita.

1179
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:12,534
As you will for all things Russian.

1180
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:17,644
I once had some Popov Vodka.

1181
01:12:19,035 --> 01:12:20,139
Did you?

1182
01:12:20,403 --> 01:12:22,314
Bully for you, Nikita!

1183
01:12:22,572 --> 01:12:23,312
What a guy!

1184
01:12:27,043 --> 01:12:28,215
On your feet.

1185
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,489
We're leaving.

1186
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:40,366
Where are you going?

1187
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:41,930
To the bathroom.

1188
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:51,874
You have a weak bladder, Nikita?

1189
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:55,538
Come again, Konstantin?

1190
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:57,412
Go.

1191
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,512
Make it snappy.

1192
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:04,248
Leave the door open.

1193
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,799
Stick this up your bladder, Boris.

1194
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:30,881
Let's go.

1195
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:23,756
Karpov?

1196
01:15:24,053 --> 01:15:24,997
He's got him.

1197
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:25,857
You're next.

1198
01:15:26,155 --> 01:15:27,099
You stay out of it.

1199
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:29,734
You're the bait,
Karpov wants Scuba.

1200
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,061
We want Jeff.

1201
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:33,935
Alive.

1202
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:36,176
You've got to take me with you.

1203
01:15:36,432 --> 01:15:37,706
- You need me!
- Step aside.

1204
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,105
The payoff is a trap!

1205
01:15:40,403 --> 01:15:41,381
Here's the passports.

1206
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:42,944
He wants money, Karpov wants him.

1207
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:44,377
If Scuba doesn't like
the rendezvous,

1208
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:45,879
you are next.

1209
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:46,880
We'll take that chance.

1210
01:15:47,176 --> 01:15:48,120
What do you think your odds are?

1211
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:49,116
He'll kill you!

1212
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:50,390
He'll kill anybody.

1213
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:51,384
Okay?

1214
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,351
Okay, okay what?

1215
01:15:52,615 --> 01:15:54,617
Okay, you tell me
where the rendezvous is.

1216
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:55,691
Okay?

1217
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:56,520
Okay what?

1218
01:15:56,786 --> 01:15:57,355
What?

1219
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:58,189
You're not his father!

1220
01:15:58,454 --> 01:15:59,023
Hey, hey!

1221
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:00,028
You've got to trust me!

1222
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:01,029
Wait, wait!

1223
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:03,630
Stop this damn truck!

1224
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:35,298
There's no...

1225
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:36,228
Roy!

1226
01:16:44,233 --> 01:16:46,304
Come in, Nikita, sit down.

1227
01:16:47,837 --> 01:16:48,679
Oh, my God.

1228
01:16:50,406 --> 01:16:51,908
You are entering the
United States illegally.

1229
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:42,522
Out, out, out, out.

1230
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:56,771
Hey!

1231
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,942
No more monkey business!

1232
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:06,879
Drive!

1233
01:20:56,385 --> 01:20:58,558
Come, come, come.

1234
01:20:58,854 --> 01:20:59,764
We go, we go.

1235
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:01,762
Welcome aboard
the San Diego Trolley.

1236
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:05,266
Bound for San Ysidro
International Border.

1237
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:07,366
Go.

1238
01:21:07,663 --> 01:21:08,368
Go, go, go!

1239
01:21:23,178 --> 01:21:24,020
Up there.

1240
01:21:46,435 --> 01:21:48,278
Where the hell is he?

1241
01:22:00,783 --> 01:22:01,420
Richard!

1242
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:05,095
- Jeff!
- Hey!

1243
01:23:17,559 --> 01:23:18,230
Richard, there it is.

1244
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:19,062
Alright.

1245
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:19,896
Over there!

1246
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:20,730
- Faster!
- I see it.

1247
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:23,009
- Alright, alright.
- Faster!

1248
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:50,598
Richard!

1249
01:23:57,099 --> 01:23:58,442
Your attention please.

1250
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:01,112
I'd like to remind all
passengers that there is

1251
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:03,781
no smoking, drinking
or eating permitted

1252
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:05,676
while onboard the trolley.

1253
01:24:05,941 --> 01:24:08,114
And in consideration
of other passengers,

1254
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:10,754
please do not place
your feet on the seats.

1255
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:11,683
Thank you.

1256
01:24:59,161 --> 01:25:00,606
Take a seat, please.

1257
01:25:00,896 --> 01:25:01,499
Please.

1258
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:09,914
We did our best.

1259
01:25:10,172 --> 01:25:11,583
Don't take our son.

1260
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,917
Wasn't good enough.

1261
01:25:15,177 --> 01:25:15,814
Take us.

1262
01:25:17,012 --> 01:25:21,791
But you are of no use
to me in Russia, Mikhail.

1263
01:25:22,084 --> 01:25:23,427
Our next station is Byer.

1264
01:25:23,685 --> 01:25:24,595
Byer is next.

1265
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:31,860
Anybody got any change?

1266
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:32,934
Anybody got any change?

1267
01:25:33,195 --> 01:25:33,764
Hey, how about you, lady?

1268
01:25:34,029 --> 01:25:34,803
You got change?

1269
01:25:35,097 --> 01:25:36,701
Hey, you got any change?

1270
01:25:36,999 --> 01:25:38,637
Hey, how about you guys,
you got any change?

1271
01:25:38,934 --> 01:25:40,311
Hey, how about you guys.

1272
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:41,137
You look like buddies.

1273
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:41,971
You wanna chip in together
and make

1274
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:43,214
change for me?

1275
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:48,010
Oh, that's okay, hombre.
I'll manage.

1276
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:49,653
Don't move, folks.

1277
01:25:49,945 --> 01:25:51,151
Everybody steady.

1278
01:25:59,788 --> 01:26:00,630
Konstantin.

1279
01:26:01,556 --> 01:26:02,899
Roy, my friend.

1280
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:05,337
I lost you.

1281
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:07,072
1967, Union Station.

1282
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:14,043
And now we have found each other.

1283
01:26:15,904 --> 01:26:17,247
On the trolley.

1284
01:26:19,141 --> 01:26:21,587
A chance encounter of old friends.

1285
01:26:25,414 --> 01:26:27,257
You bring me my assignment?

1286
01:26:27,549 --> 01:26:29,358
What a friendly gesture.

1287
01:26:30,986 --> 01:26:31,726
No?

1288
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:34,690
Did I presume too much?

1289
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:36,867
Ah, of course, of course.

1290
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:39,061
I'm mistaken.

1291
01:26:42,264 --> 01:26:44,107
You hold all the cards.

1292
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:48,447
And all I have is a 17-year-old boy.

1293
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:56,082
Get up, Jeff.

1294
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:02,517
How?

1295
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:04,855
Like you always did, kid.

1296
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:08,557
What are you laughing at, scum?

1297
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:17,242
What did he say?

1298
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:21,747
How can he let me go
after I killed your friend.

1299
01:27:22,037 --> 01:27:23,414
No, not friend.

1300
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:24,308
Partner.

1301
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:31,287
He tried to be...

1302
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,389
I heard what he said.

1303
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:35,389
He tried to be a hero.

1304
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:37,061
He ended up a fool.

1305
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:51,743
You heard me, kid.

1306
01:27:53,068 --> 01:27:55,139
Plant your feet and rise.

1307
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:56,074
Now.

1308
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:09,661
On your feet, shithead.

1309
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:10,827
On your feet!

1310
01:28:16,191 --> 01:28:17,829
Alright, Jeff.

1311
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:19,264
Cross the aisle.

1312
01:28:20,929 --> 01:28:21,999
Nice and slow.

1313
01:28:33,208 --> 01:28:34,380
I would never give up a man

1314
01:28:34,676 --> 01:28:36,314
who killed my partner.

1315
01:28:38,547 --> 01:28:40,618
You never had a partner.

1316
01:28:49,391 --> 01:28:50,836
I like you, Roy.

1317
01:28:59,968 --> 01:29:00,844
Our last station

1318
01:29:01,136 --> 01:29:03,480
is San Ysidro
International Border.

1319
01:29:03,738 --> 01:29:05,217
All returning passengers
are reminded

1320
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:07,578
to purchase new tickets
or validate

1321
01:29:07,876 --> 01:29:10,720
multi-ride tickets just
prior to de-boarding.

1322
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:13,549
You stay with me to the border.

1323
01:30:29,324 --> 01:30:30,598
You stay here.

1324
01:30:32,961 --> 01:30:34,235
Stay out of this.

1325
01:30:34,496 --> 01:30:35,065
Come on.

1326
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:35,899
You walk in front of us, kid,

1327
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:36,904
and hide this mess.

1328
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:37,802
No, no!

1329
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:41,137
You don't want the cops here,
do you?

1330
01:30:44,306 --> 01:30:45,080
Jeffrey!

1331
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:24,719
Nikita, I'm going to miss you.

1332
01:31:25,013 --> 01:31:27,653
We could have had such a
pleasant trip together.

1333
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:30,156
Come visit me sometime.

1334
01:31:30,452 --> 01:31:32,989
And by all means,
bring Barbara with you.

1335
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:53,850
Goodbye, Mr. Parmenter.

1336
01:31:55,643 --> 01:31:57,987
Keep an eye out for me.

1337
01:31:58,246 --> 01:32:00,385
I always have, Konstantin.

1338
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:21,608
You know, Roy.

1339
01:32:23,271 --> 01:32:26,218
Russians don't shoot their children.

1340
01:33:15,457 --> 01:33:17,630
What's new, Roy?

1341
01:33:17,926 --> 01:33:19,428
Nothing much.

1342
01:33:19,727 --> 01:33:20,762
Tamales and cock fights.

1343
01:33:21,062 --> 01:33:21,733
Yeah, I know.

1344
01:33:21,996 --> 01:33:23,566
Same ole, same ole.

1345
01:33:23,832 --> 01:33:25,402
Same ole, same ole.

1346
01:33:47,922 --> 01:33:49,128
Let's go home.
