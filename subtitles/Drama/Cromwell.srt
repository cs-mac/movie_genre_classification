1
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,851
Is that him?

2
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,092
Yes.

3
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,698
Oliver!

4
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,775
God be with you, Oliver.
And you too, John.

5
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,538
This is Henry Ireton, a good friend.

6
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,810
Good day to you, sir. Mr. Ireton.

7
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,934
I've just been taking
a last look at my land.

8
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,655
We had heard you were leaving, Mr.
Cromwell. We came from London directly.

9
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,374
You could have saved yourself
the effort, Mr. Ireton.

10
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,899
If we could discuss
it, Oliver, I'm sure-

11
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,489
There is nothing to discuss, John.

12
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,295
Well, come back to my house.
You've got a long journey back.

13
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,740
You must forgive the manner
of our table, Mr. Pym.

14
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,613
Our best crockery is
packed for the voyage.

15
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,015
Bridget, fetch the bread. Yes, Mother.

16
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,051
We had hoped to persuade your husband

17
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,491
to change his mind about
going to America, ma'am.

18
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,056
I should have thought you would know
Oliver better than that, Mr. Pym.

19
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,978
It was not an easy decision, John.

20
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,297
This is my country, my land.
God has been good to me here.

21
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,011
Then, sir, why are you leaving?
I have a family, Mr. Ireton.

22
00:03:57,421 --> 00:03:59,855
I owe it to my sons to
make a better life for them.

23
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,449
England is no longer a
country for a young man.

24
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,458
I recall you often spoke out
strongly in Parliament for the rights

25
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,649
and privileges of the common people.

26
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:08,778
Ah.

27
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,858
That was a long time ago, Mr. Ireton.

28
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,652
I had a vision then.

29
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,293
A great nation.

30
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,369
Prosperous, God-fearing,
good laws, strong,

31
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,696
respected throughout the world.

32
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,414
That was the England I dreamed of.

33
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,619
Well, sir, you are a squire
now, a man of property.

34
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,812
Perhaps you no longer
care for the common people.

35
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,216
Perhaps I've been misinformed, sir.

36
00:04:35,421 --> 00:04:38,936
I thought, as a Puritan, you
would see it as your God-given duty

37
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,530
to do the Lord's work in this
land, regardless of sacrifice.

38
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,018
Mr. Ireton, I was fighting for
the liberty of the common people

39
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,051
when you were in knee breeches.

40
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,129
Then why are you leaving?

41
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,012
I am leaving because this country
crawls with greed and corruption.

42
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,938
It is governed by
adventurers and profiteers

43
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,052
who think more of their
pockets than their principles.

44
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,179
I am leaving, sir, because we have a
king who taxes the rich beyond its means

45
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,735
and steals land from
the poor to maintain

46
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,573
his lavish court and his Catholic wife.

47
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,818
Now, when Parliament objected
against these injustices

48
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,857
he closed his Parliament down.

49
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,330
And our man dare not speak his
mind for fear of imprisonment.

50
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,939
Oh, yes.

51
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,928
All my life I believed it was God's
work to fight against such tyranny.

52
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:34,409
But God has turned his back upon
this nation, and we are leaving it.

53
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,737
And what if Parliament should
be recalled, Mr. Cromwell?

54
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,057
And why should a king do
that? He needs money, Oliver.

55
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,253
What? To build another palace? No.

56
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,769
To fight a war.

57
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,413
A war, John?

58
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,296
A war against whom?

59
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,809
The Scots have assembled
and army on our border.

60
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:02,858
They may invade us at any moment.

61
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,051
The king needs money to raise an army.

62
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,619
Ah.

63
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,809
By the king's own decree, Parliament
has not sat these past 12 years.

64
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,933
And now the king needs money.
Once Parliament has assembled,

65
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,291
it will lie within our power to change

66
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,856
the whole structure of
government in this country.

67
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,255
John, how many times did we sit
in Parliament in the old days

68
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,178
and how many resolutions did we pass?

69
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,808
And how many times did
this king overrule us?

70
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,057
Oh, the king can have
his war with Scotland.

71
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,814
We will be in America. There
will be a war, Mr. Cromwell,

72
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,211
but it will not be with Scotland. Henry.

73
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,775
With whom, Mr. Ireton?

74
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,931
Henry, we have argued
this matter many times.

75
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,095
I'm convinced of it.

76
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,897
A war against whom, Mr.
Ireton? Against the king, sir.

77
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,292
The king?

78
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,450
You mean a civil war? In England?

79
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,619
You know not the ways of this nation, Mr.
Ireton. Such things do not happen here.

80
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,420
And in my opinion, it is long overdue.

81
00:07:05,621 --> 00:07:07,657
I will not have such talk in my house.

82
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,175
It is common enough
talk these days, I fear.

83
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,692
Then it is treasonable talk! And
I will not have it in my house!

84
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,972
I mark the time when you were much against
the king and never feared to say so.

85
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,375
In truth, there is much in
this king that does offend me.

86
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,419
Yet, with all, I would not take up arms against
him, and I would oppose any move to do so.

87
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:26,612
In such a cause, our swords
will be in God's hands.

88
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,659
It's an odd thing, Mr. Ireton. Every man
who wages war believes God is on his side.

89
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,570
I warrant God should often wonder
who is on his. Good evening, sir.

90
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,776
Well, if I did give you
offence, sir, I beg your pardon.

91
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,939
You're a young man, Mr. Ireton. It's fitting
a young man should want to change the world.

92
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,331
Not the world, sir. Only England.

93
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,299
With a civil war.

94
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,815
Good evening, Mrs. Cromwell.
Good evening, Mr. Ireton.

95
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:58,176
I'll get your cloak, Mr. Ireton.

96
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,731
I hope you'll forgive him.

97
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,976
Goodbye, John.

98
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,015
God be with you, Oliver.

99
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,893
You've no right to do
this. Leave them animals be.

100
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,056
This is the common land.

101
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,169
Any man who raises a hand against
the king's men will be arrested.

102
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,941
You have no right to do
this. This land is ours.

103
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,932
Well, now it belongs to
the Earl of Manchester.

104
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,255
By whose authority?

105
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,890
By the authority of the king.
Then I say the king is a thief!

106
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,858
You're under arrest. Take him away!

107
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,170
Bastards! Look at him,
now. What's he done?

108
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,450
He's done nothing. Release that man!

109
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,616
Who the devil are you?
This man works for me.

110
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,572
Whatever he has done, I will
take full responsibility.

111
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,699
He has spoken treason against the king.
Will you take responsibility for that?

112
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,850
The rights to pasture
belong to the common people.

113
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,335
By what authority, Lord
Manchester, do you take that away?

114
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,174
By the authority of His
Majesty's commissioners,

115
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,015
granting me and my friends full rights to
this land for the purpose of improvement.

116
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,219
Such a contract cannot be legal. It is
in violation of the law of this land.

117
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,135
As a magistrate, you should know
the king is the law of this land.

118
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,373
On the contrary, my Lord Manchester. It
is the king's duty to maintain the law.

119
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,735
This is common land. It
belongs to the people.

120
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:32,331
This is my land, and
you are trespassing.

121
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,771
It's only out of respect for your rank I don't
have you arrested for obstructing the law.

122
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,618
Captain Lundsford! My lord?

123
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,812
See that no unauthorized
person enters this area.

124
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,336
Yes, my lord. Remove these people.

125
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,374
Good morrow to you, squire.
Good morrow, Mrs. Cromwell.

126
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,937
Squire, have you news of my husband?

127
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,698
It's in God's hands, Mrs. Carter.

128
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:15,610
And in the king's. Aye.

129
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,732
PRIEST: Let us pray.

130
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:26,848
Almighty God, look down upon this
thy house and we, thy humble servants.

131
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:33,019
Grant us the spirit of thy grace
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

132
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,329
Amen.

133
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,929
Who has done this?

134
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,858
Answer me. Who has done
this? An edict, squire,

135
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,655
from the archbishop himself
and by order of the king.

136
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,619
By order of the king.

137
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,171
Is the Church of England
not a Protestant church?

138
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:58,295
Would the king turn the house
of God into a Roman temple?

139
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,850
Mr. Cromwell, I beseech you.
Does the king think that God

140
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,298
can be bought with gold,
trinkets and gilded rubbish?

141
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,855
I know only that I have been instructed.

142
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,568
Has this king forgotten the Reformation?

143
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,136
Mr. Cromwell-
Away with it.

144
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,810
Popish idolatry!

145
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,696
Did the Lord not say unto Moses:

146
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,893
"Thou shalt not make unto
thyself any graven image

147
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,813
nor bow down to them"?

148
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,619
Has this king forgotten
the Spanish Inquisition?

149
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,940
Is the Roman Catholic Church
to have a seat in Westminster?

150
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,168
Oh, my God.

151
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:00,137
My God. Oh, my God!

152
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,098
Goddamn this king.

153
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,410
King's guard, attention!

154
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,329
Here we are, my lord.

155
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,089
That'll do, damn it.
I'm not a damned cripple.

156
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,372
Me sticks, where are me
sticks? Come over here, boy.

157
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,612
Here they are, my lord.
Give me the damned things.

158
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,015
And who the devil are you? Edward Hyde.

159
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,931
Let's in to His Majesty. Where is he?

160
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:11,893
He's at prayers, my lord. Aye.

161
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,649
He might do well to pray and
all. We're gonna need some help.

162
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,374
First the Irish and now the Scots.

163
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,333
You doesn't turn your
back on either of them.

164
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,654
Let us give thanks to our mighty God,
that he has seen fit to bless this table

165
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,495
with the fruits of his bounty. In the
name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, amen.

166
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,492
Amen.

167
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,696
I did remark, madam, with some distress

168
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,933
that His Highness, Prince Charles,
was absent from prayers this morning.

169
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,374
He was with me, my lord.

170
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,180
He did pray with you? In your chapel?

171
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,850
Yes, my lord. I am most displeased.

172
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,096
It is not fitting that
a future king of England

173
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,774
should make his devotions
in a Catholic chapel.

174
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,979
Your private beliefs are respected.
But this is a Protestant country

175
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,208
and as head of both church and state, it is
my God-given duty to see that it so remains.

176
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,732
His Highness found the whole business
so boring, my lord, that he fell asleep.

177
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,090
Didn't you, Charles? Yes, madam.

178
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,852
I believe you will find your
church as solid as ever, my lord.

179
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,690
Nevertheless, you will kindly
see that it does not happen again.

180
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,209
Yes, my lord.

181
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,618
Your Majesty, the Earl of
Strafford awaits your pleasure.

182
00:14:58,021 --> 00:15:01,377
My good Lord Strafford,
welcome back to England.

183
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,698
Thank you, my lord.

184
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,291
Your Majesty. Your Royal Highness.

185
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,258
Most noble sovereign.

186
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,896
A chair for his lordship.
Thank you, my lord.

187
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,091
I'm sorry to see you in pain.

188
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:22,057
It is the agues from the bogs of
Ireland, my lord. Godforsaken place.

189
00:15:22,261 --> 00:15:24,172
Saving your presence, my lord bishop.

190
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,979
We would not have summoned you, Lord
Strafford, had the situation here

191
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,818
not been of a greatest urgency.

192
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,370
You've doubtless heard that the Scottish
rebels are marching on Newcastle?

193
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,535
Aye, my lord.

194
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,016
You will whip these
barbarians to their senses.

195
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,657
But what of Ireland, my lord? We'll
deal with Ireland in good time.

196
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,537
You'll march an army on
Scotland. Army. What army?

197
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,052
Most of your army lies rotting
beneath the bogs of Ireland.

198
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,935
What's left of it is hard-pressed
to keep law and order.

199
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,410
Then we will raise a second army.

200
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,777
I fear Your Majesty may find
that easier said than done.

201
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,212
What? I guarantee I could raise
3000 men under arms inside a month!

202
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:09,730
But could you guarantee
their loyalty, my lord?

203
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,534
Is there an Englishman living
who wouldn't draw a sword

204
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,735
against his king's enemies?

205
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,090
There would be many
Englishmen, my Lord Strafford,

206
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,575
who would more readily draw
swords against the king.

207
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:24,373
My God, who is this jackanapes that mouths
such treason in your presence, my lord?

208
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,775
You've been away a long time, Strafford.

209
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,534
Much here has changed.

210
00:16:29,741 --> 00:16:31,618
Aye, I can see it has.

211
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,778
I fear Sir Edward but speaks the truth.

212
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,253
To put an effective army in the field against
the Scots will cost almost a million pounds.

213
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,850
The Crown does not
have a million pounds.

214
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,369
Are we just going to sit
here then and do nothing?

215
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:54,177
Then I will summon Parliament and
instruct them to provide money.

216
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,695
Parliament?!

217
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:02,568
The king of England go cap in hand
to the common people, like a-?

218
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,533
A beggar. Aye! A beggar?

219
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,575
I have no choice. I say take the money.

220
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,171
You, my lord, are absolved before God
and before man from any such action.

221
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:24,179
For in extreme necessity, the king is
acquitted from all rule of government

222
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,814
and can do all that his power permits.

223
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,093
Power? Where is the power
of a king without an army?

224
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,532
I'll warrant you, I'll raise an army.

225
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,699
We'll reduce this kingdom
to submission in one summer!

226
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:44,169
Do you mean, sir, that I should
declare war on my own people?

227
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,371
Aye!

228
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,095
Before they declare war on you.

229
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,413
Well, sons, there it is.

230
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,611
Parliament House.

231
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,130
Upon that place rests all
the hopes of this nation

232
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,450
for a settlement of its ills in peace.

233
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,299
Do you think it could
come to war, Father?

234
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,173
Well, Oliver, when men run out of words,

235
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,251
they reach for their swords.

236
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,577
Let's hope we can keep them talking.

237
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,299
The king demands
money to raise an army.

238
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,498
This House demands
redress for grievances.

239
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:03,968
Grievances which the past 12 years have
laid heavy upon the nation. I say that-

240
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,854
Might I be heard? I say, therefore,
this House is resolved that we'll vote...

241
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,732
Welcome back to Parliament.

242
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,738
...no money for the king!

243
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,970
Order! Order!

244
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,970
Neither will we take up arms against
our Scottish brethren, unless...

245
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,095
Unless this Parliament
is allowed to function

246
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,010
as the true voice of
the people of England.

247
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,293
And not as a gathering
of lackeys to the king.

248
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,732
Sir Edward Hyde, Your Majesty.

249
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,378
Well, Sir Edward? Your Majesty.

250
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,936
I believe the House will
grant a loan to the Crown.

251
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,853
But only on certain conditions.

252
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,973
Conditions? What do
you mean, conditions?

253
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,853
What are these conditions, Sir Edward?

254
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,652
In essence, sire,

255
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,535
that the Crown relinquishes
all authority over Parliament.

256
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,896
And who put forward this proposal?

257
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,373
John Pym, Henry Ireton, John Hampden.

258
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,013
The Puritans.

259
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,172
They were well supported, my lord.

260
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,969
And they call themselves Englishmen?

261
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,172
My God, it's enough to make
a man deny his birthright.

262
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:49,612
Yet, withal, they still be Englishmen.

263
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,209
They make a mockery of the Crown!

264
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:57,414
They abuse the privilege of free
speech with sedition and treason.

265
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:02,410
You're too loud, Lord Strafford.
It is most unpleasant to the ear.

266
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,096
So it has come to this, my lord.

267
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:12,773
That you now bargain for your
Crown. What would you have me do?

268
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,290
Arrest every man who
opposes me? Hang them?

269
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,653
Would you rather make a
gift of the Crown of England

270
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,970
to the rabble in the street?

271
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,214
It lies beyond my power to arrest
a citizen without proper charges.

272
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,139
Charges are immaterial.

273
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,129
Such an act would subvert the
fundamental laws of this land, madam.

274
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,778
Such an act might save the
Crown of England, my lord.

275
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,976
I've governed this country
justly and fairly these 12 years

276
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,257
without reference to any Parliament.

277
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,497
You may be assured, I do not intend
now to be schooled in my high office

278
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,659
by illiterate farm hands, cobblers

279
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,175
and basket weavers.

280
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,613
My Lord Strafford, you will
rid us of these troublemakers:

281
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:06,216
Pym, Ireton, all of them.

282
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:09,773
I'll arrest every one of
them, my lord. As you will.

283
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,336
I shall need a warrant.
That is imperative.

284
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,737
And what will the charges be, my lord?

285
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,330
You're an experienced officer
of the Crown, Strafford.

286
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:24,010
You do not need to be instructed by me.

287
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,649
Mr. Speaker.

288
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,930
May I have permission
to address the House?

289
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,091
By all means, sir. Gentlemen.

290
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,452
A matter has come to my notice,
which is of deep concern to me

291
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:43,609
and will, I am sure, be to every
single member of this House.

292
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,729
The Earl of Strafford has, this
day, put his hand to a warrant

293
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,659
for the arrest and impeachment of myself

294
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,892
and four other honourable
members of this House

295
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,291
upon a charge of high treason.

296
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,811
Though Strafford's hand
be upon this warrant,

297
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:09,413
I see in this business, not the hand
of Strafford, but that of the king.

298
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,851
My lords!

299
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:18,096
I beseech you, do not
condemn this king too hastily.

300
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,929
For I am persuaded he has been
ill-advised upon this course.

301
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,456
Is not a king to be judged by
those from whom he seeks counsel?

302
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,814
He is not!

303
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,769
It is not the function of this House
to sit in judgement upon this king.

304
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,576
The fault lies with those very people
from whom the king has sought counsel.

305
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:42,854
I therefore move that this House demands

306
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,373
the arrest and impeachment
of the Earl of Strafford

307
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:51,290
upon a charge of high treason
against the people of this nation.

308
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,698
Silence! Order!

309
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,849
The motion has been proposed.
Let it be put now to the question.

310
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,530
Is the motion agreed? MEN: No!

311
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,929
In favour of the motion?

312
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:10,254
Aye! Aye! Aye!

313
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,538
The ayes have it.

314
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,290
I think my Lord Strafford's condition

315
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,096
will soon be far happier than mine.

316
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,010
Do you see, madam?

317
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,292
Do you see now what you've made me do?

318
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,212
Gentlemen, His Majesty.

319
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,296
Pray be seated.

320
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,729
Your coming is nothing if not timely.

321
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:15,050
My Lord Strafford's head
has but barely fallen.

322
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,733
Now, gentlemen, it is for you to speak.

323
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,448
Your Majesty, you see here the
leaders of all parties of the House.

324
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:30,336
And though we be divided on many
issues, we are of one accord.

325
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,779
In that we place above all
else, our allegiance and loyalty

326
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,289
to our most gracious sovereign.

327
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,736
For which reason we are deeply anxious

328
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,095
for a settlement of the
differences between us.

329
00:26:42,341 --> 00:26:45,697
I share your sentiment, Sir Edward.

330
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,779
The issue be this, my lord.

331
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,691
Parliament is persuaded that without
the right to govern this nation

332
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,257
by the will of the people
and with God's guidance,

333
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,218
we be not a Parliament at all.

334
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,737
And that unless some constitutional
reformation be brought about,

335
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:12,139
we would as well go back to our
homes and our farms as pursue this

336
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,900
mockery of a government one more day.

337
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,171
In short, Mr. Pym, you're asking me

338
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,816
to relinquish my sovereign
power over Parliament.

339
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,329
It does amount to that, Your Majesty.

340
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,293
I do swear that I hold
this England and its laws

341
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,928
dearer to my heart than any here.

342
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,338
But gentlemen, if you were to reduce
me to a figurehead, a puppet king

343
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,810
manipulated by Parliament, how
then would I serve my country?

344
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:40,138
What manner of king would I be?

345
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,218
I am persuaded, Your Majesty,

346
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,538
that England must move forward to a
more enlightened form of government

347
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,409
based upon a true
representation of a free people.

348
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,454
Such an institution is
known as democracy, sir.

349
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:00,379
A democracy, Mr...? Cromwell, sir.

350
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,974
Democracy, Mr. Cromwell,
was a Greek drollery

351
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,298
based on the foolish notion that
there are extraordinary possibilities

352
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,331
in very ordinary people.

353
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,979
It is the ordinary people, my lord, who
would most readily lay down their lives

354
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,937
in defence of your realm.

355
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,970
It is simply that being ordinary,

356
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,411
they would prefer to
be asked and not told.

357
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,252
You know, as I do, that even as we sit
here, the Scots rebels are invading this land

358
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:37,774
and not an English sword is raised against them.
I beg you, therefore, let us bury our differences

359
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,619
in defence of both
our church and kingdom.

360
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:47,168
The Scots invade our land
and all is urgency and alarm.

361
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,770
In the past 12 months our Irish
colonists have been slaughtered,

362
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,292
our churches desecrated,
our clergy persecuted.

363
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,331
The Crown has been oddly reluctant

364
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,651
to defend our church and
kingdom over there, sir.

365
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,892
By my guard, I would as soon
take up arms against Rome

366
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,250
than against the Scots.

367
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,456
Would you have me declare war

368
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,180
on the entire Catholic
world, Mr. Cromwell?

369
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,492
It is your duty to
defend our church, sir.

370
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,056
We are speaking now of a
matter of international policy.

371
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:28,575
Is Your Majesty sure that it's not
a matter of domestic expediency?

372
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,412
Come, sir! I would remind you, sir,

373
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,133
that you are addressing your king.

374
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:37,135
Mr. Cromwell, you are impertinent.

375
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:42,537
Such issues are beyond
good manners, sir.

376
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,490
Catholicism is more than a
religion, it is a political power.

377
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,569
Therefore, I am led to believe
there will be no peace in Ireland

378
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,857
until the Catholic Church is crushed.

379
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,656
Your Majesty.

380
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,779
These gentlemen
are from the Parliament.

381
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,618
Your Majesty, Parliament
has drawn up this document

382
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,653
in which are set out
our main grievances.

383
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,693
It is our belief that
the demands made here

384
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,175
are only those that are just and lawful

385
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,009
and in the best interests
of both Crown and kingdom.

386
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,055
I shall examine these proposals
most carefully, Mr. Pym.

387
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,937
Gentlemen.

388
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,018
It is not too late, my lord.

389
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,334
You have the power still.

390
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,091
And with God's help, the
strength to use that power.

391
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,414
Oh, my dearest Charles.

392
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,329
I married you as a king and as a man.

393
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:47,095
I beseech you, do not
disappoint me in either aspect.

394
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,532
"This House has time and again

395
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,733
expressed its wholehearted
loyalty to the Crown.

396
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,168
Yet...

397
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:11,293
doth Parliament await
in vain for a gesture... "

398
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,771
The king is coming with a warrant to
arrest you, John Hampden, Henry Ireton,

399
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,733
Sir Arthur Haselrig and Oliver
Cromwell under charge of high treason.

400
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,214
I suggest you leave immediately.

401
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,179
"- that if the issues that
divide the king from his country

402
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,652
be not soon resolved, then these
issues may soon divide the nation. "

403
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,778
The king is coming with
a warrant for our arrest.

404
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,097
What? We must leave at once.

405
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,139
Oliver, your name is on it.

406
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,258
Come!

407
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,612
My lords! My lords!

408
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,291
Gentlemen! The king comes.
He comes with 100 men-at-arms.

409
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,738
The doors! The doors! Bolt the doors!

410
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,450
Stand aside, gentlemen,
if you please. MAN: Halt!

411
00:33:19,661 --> 00:33:21,538
Open in the name of the king!

412
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,416
Mr. Speaker.

413
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,250
Gentlemen, you must pardon this
infringement of your privilege

414
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,059
but I will not detain you long.

415
00:34:25,261 --> 00:34:28,014
Mr. Speaker, I must make
bold with your chair.

416
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:43,936
I have here a warrant for the
arrest of five members of this House.

417
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,458
John Pym, Henry Ireton, John Hampden,

418
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,817
Oliver Cromwell and Sir Arthur Haselrig

419
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,619
upon a charge of treason.

420
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,050
I see that the birds have flown.

421
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,210
Mr. Speaker, where are these gentlemen?

422
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,211
May it please Your Majesty,

423
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,531
I have neither eyes to
see nor tongue to speak

424
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,970
except as this House gives me leave.

425
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,179
Well, sir, I have eyes. I
see that one of them is here.

426
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,179
Captain.

427
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,172
Take him!

428
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,850
Any action against a member of
this House is a breach of privilege.

429
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,053
I move this House
declares as public enemies

430
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,893
any who lay hands upon its members.

431
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,135
And I further move...

432
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,176
I further move that any such
action against this House

433
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,774
be considered a crime against the people

434
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,053
and treason against this nation.

435
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,937
So be it.

436
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,050
Mr. Speaker, you will inform
the members of this House

437
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,855
that their presence is no
longer required by the nation.

438
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:19,215
This Parliament is, by my
authority, terminated, dissolved.

439
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,094
Your Majesty!

440
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,379
Are you aware that by your
action in this House today

441
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,095
you may have pushed this nation
to the brink of civil war?

442
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,412
Now do we see

443
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:08,296
in what contempt this king
holds this House and this nation?

444
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:16,094
It be either your king
or your Parliament.

445
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:22,100
Honourable members,
the decision is yours.

446
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:29,169
But I beseech you, in the
name of God, think well on it.

447
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,611
Fairfax.

448
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,010
Gentlemen.

449
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,657
I move that this House demand
the control of the militia

450
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,217
and that this country be put in
an immediate posture of defence.

451
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,131
Mr. Speaker.

452
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,491
My lords.

453
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:35,293
Honourable members. This nation
is now in a state of civil war.

454
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,409
And let us pray that God in
his mercy will give us strength

455
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:47,171
in this terrible and most unhappy hour.

456
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,818
Morning, William.

457
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,931
Give you good day,
squire. Why the coffin?

458
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,775
If it be God's will I die, squire, then
I would have a decent Christian burial.

459
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,699
Let's hope it doesn't come to that,
William. I need you in the farm.

460
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,455
Hello, Father. Father.

461
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,412
Morning. Where's your sword, Richard?

462
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,814
I have no sword, Father.

463
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,092
You must get one and wear it.
It's a mark of your rank, captain.

464
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,370
Yes. MAN: God bless thee!

465
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:59,889
Hallelujah, hallelujah, brethren.
It is the Lord's work we do this day!

466
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,813
The Lord's work- This
is no place for you, Hugh,

467
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,975
though you be welcome.

468
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:07,815
I've consulted God on
this matter, Mr. Cromwell.

469
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,653
I asked him, "Lord,
whose side are you on?"

470
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:16,093
And he answered me, saying, "On
the side of truth and justice. "

471
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,297
So here I am.

472
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,493
Company, forward!

473
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:28,891
<i>MEN SINGING: Lift up your
heads ye gates of brass</i>

474
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:33,332
<i>Ye bars of iron yield</i>

475
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,215
<i>And let the king of glory</i>

476
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:42,653
<i>Pass the crosses in the field</i>

477
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,057
<i>That banner brighter</i>

478
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:52,256
<i>Than the star that
leaves A trail of light</i>

479
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,250
Greetings, Uncle.

480
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,133
'Tis a fair day for a
fight. Where be the enemy?

481
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,338
My lords, I present my nephew.

482
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,492
His Highness, Prince Rupert,
Count Palatine of the Rhine.

483
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,134
My lords, I give you
greetings. LORDS: Your Highness.

484
00:41:33,461 --> 00:41:36,339
And good Cousin Charles,
most noble Prince of Wales.

485
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,378
How fare you, young sir? I
am well, thank you, cousin.

486
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,973
So let us to action. For
I do swear by this sword

487
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,895
that within a week we will have severed
every round head from its shoulders!

488
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,058
Well said, Your Highness.
Let the standard be raised.

489
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,859
Get those guns moving!

490
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:21,410
<i>Thou shalt proclaim his life</i>

491
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,895
<i>Though granted...</i>

492
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,339
Halt!

493
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,292
Halt!

494
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,251
Where the devil are we?
Edgehill, my lord, over there.

495
00:43:37,501 --> 00:43:39,492
Morning, Robert. Morning, Edward.

496
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,975
Damn me, they've got
a lot of fellows there.

497
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,014
Where's Cromwell?
Approaching now, my lord.

498
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,571
Morning, Cromwell. Morning, my lord.

499
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,931
Your men fit, colonel?
My men are ready, my lord.

500
00:44:03,181 --> 00:44:05,900
You seem damned eager to get
into this business, Cromwell.

501
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,531
We all enter this reluctantly,
but the die is cast.

502
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,210
Is that not so, Lord
Essex? You are right.

503
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,696
Well, to your position. Let no
man move except upon my signal.

504
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,374
And may God look
kindly upon us this day.

505
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,649
Amen to that.

506
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,530
Missed my breakfast. Damned
tricky things, stomachs.

507
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,969
God be with you, men.
God bless you.

508
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,489
God be with you. Take
care of yourself, William.

509
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,498
The Lord'll take care of
me, squire. Have faith, John.

510
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,373
I have, squire. Come on,
lads. Look to your muskets.

511
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:45,174
Have your muskets at
the ready. Come on, now.

512
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,896
Father. May God take
care of you, Richard

513
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:54,412
and be with you, Oliver.
And with you too, Father.

514
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:01,849
"O Lord, defend our cause
against the face of the enemy.

515
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:06,611
Save us from the violence
of the enemy. O Lord of hope,

516
00:45:06,861 --> 00:45:09,978
fight for us that we may glorify thee. "

517
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,688
O Lord, God of mercy.

518
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,256
Put thy strength in our hands this day.

519
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:20,373
Give not the battle to the
strong, but to the righteous.

520
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:25,859
And be thou, O merciful God,
our saviour and mighty deliverer.

521
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,733
Defend me from them
that rise up against me.

522
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,170
In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

523
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,530
Amen.

524
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,452
Amen. Amen.

525
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:38,254
Father, look. It's Lord Essex.

526
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,412
Come, cousin.

527
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:57,899
Let's take a good look at
these Roundheads. Your Majesty.

528
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:14,258
God's teeth, have we not
parleyed enough these past months?

529
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,015
Well, Essex, are you prepared?
We are. Shall we begin at 10?

530
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,615
Make it 9, my lord.
I'm positively starving.

531
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,373
Then in God's name, let's to it.

532
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,851
It is agreed then, 9:00. And
by my faith, which I have not,

533
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:30,292
I swear that within the hour, this
field will be strewn with English dead.

534
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:34,415
If this be so, they will have
been killed by Englishmen.

535
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:40,252
For we have not seen fit to import
foreign mercenaries into our ranks.

536
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:46,254
I will mark you well for that
insult, sir. Be on your guard!

537
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,090
Colours to the rear!

538
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,808
Colours to the rear!

539
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:08,094
The Lord is our
strength. Praise the Lord!

540
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:23,809
What in the name of
God are we waiting for?

541
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:25,976
Ireton!

542
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:31,058
I thought we came here to do battle.
We're waiting for the appointed time.

543
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,569
The appointed time?

544
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:46,939
Colonel Hampden, commence firing! Fire!

545
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,257
What the devil is that fool doing?

546
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,578
Artillery, commence firing!

547
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,890
Fire!

548
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:13,419
O Lord, thou knowest how
busy I must be this day.

549
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:18,694
If I forget thee, do not thou forget me.

550
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,338
Fire!

551
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,530
Fire!

552
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,978
You'd better send Fairfax in. Mm.

553
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,896
Bugler, sound the charge.

554
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,973
Troop at the gallop.

555
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,892
Advance!

556
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,533
Signal Astley to advance.
Bugler, sound the advance.

557
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,973
The sport begins.

558
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,810
Tallyho!

559
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,298
Troops rear left. At a gallop, charge!

560
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,937
Give fire!

561
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,329
Advance!

562
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,491
Advance!

563
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,459
Fire!

564
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:41,690
Advance pike!

565
00:50:44,301 --> 00:50:46,769
Charge pike!

566
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,890
Fire! Second rank forward!

567
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,818
At the gallop!

568
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,689
It's getting too damned
close for my liking.

569
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:48,053
Sound general retreat.
Sound general retreat.

570
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,094
My lord, why in the name of
Christ did you sound the retreat?

571
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:13,454
Colonel, you've countermined my orders
once today. You'll do as you're told, sir.

572
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,535
Hold your ground, in the name of God!

573
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:35,698
Hold your ground!

574
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:06,933
Well, Uncle, did you ever see a
quarry so swiftly put to flight?

575
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:11,258
The king will forever keep this
field and this day's service

576
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,735
in grateful remembrance.

577
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,970
Come nightfall, we shall bury our dead.

578
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:57,217
And then, by God, we
shall bury this army.

579
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:01,214
With such pitiful men in our ranks, it
were better this war were never fought.

580
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,814
Not a drop of English blood
soiled this English land.

581
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:07,052
It's a bad officer who
blames his men, Cromwell.

582
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:10,372
I blame them not, my lord,
for they are simple men.

583
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,652
But what match are farmer's
boys against gentlemen's sons?

584
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,891
The battle is not yet lost, Cromwell.

585
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,529
This battle were lost
before it began, my lord.

586
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:21,015
And in like manner, so will this war.

587
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,290
In the morning, I'm
returning to Cambridge.

588
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,338
If you desert the field,
I'll have you arrested.

589
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,379
This war will not be won
with untrained ploughmen,

590
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:32,299
apprentices, old, decaying serving men.

591
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:37,290
We need men with fire in their bowels
who fear the Lord, but not the enemy!

592
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,970
As God is my witness, I am resolved
that this battle will be won.

593
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,939
Therefore, it's my intention
to return to Cambridge,

594
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,693
and raise an army of handpicked men,

595
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,289
the like of which this
nation has never seen!

596
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:52,971
With or without your
permission, my Lord Manchester.

597
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:15,968
Bristol will not be permitted to fall.
It is our only seaport in the west,

598
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,495
and if General Goring is
incapable of holding it,

599
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,378
then I will dispatch someone who can.

600
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:23,737
I've a mind to see Bristol, my
lord. It is a fair city, I hear.

601
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,256
Then I shall place Bristol in your command,
nephew. Now, my lord general, should our forces-

602
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,819
Your Majesty. Yes, what is it?

603
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,936
News of Cromwell's army, Your Majesty.

604
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:34,212
Come forward. At last, Old
Ironsides ventures forth.

605
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,375
Well, speak, man.

606
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,292
They're about six miles
away, Your Majesty.

607
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,819
Just south of Naseby.

608
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:42,330
By my reckoning, there be
about 1000 horse and 2000 afoot.

609
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:47,660
And what news of Manchester's army?
I saw no other army, Your Majesty.

610
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,818
Was not Cromwell to join
Manchester's forces at Naseby?

611
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:52,612
That was our intelligence, Your Majesty.

612
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,412
Then Manchester be still in Lincoln.

613
00:57:54,780 --> 00:58:00,889
So Cromwell comes with his
army of 3000 to our 7000.

614
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:04,775
By your leave, Uncle. Your Highness.
General Astley, sound the alert.

615
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,578
I want every man in full
battle order at once.

616
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:10,500
By God, we have him!

617
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,650
Manchester!

618
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,810
Where in the name of Christ is he?

619
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,858
Know you not we are at war?

620
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:34,733
In God's name I do swear we
fight this war single-handed.

621
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,771
Oliver.

622
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:53,733
What bloody treachery is this?

623
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:57,933
We came to meet Manchester and
instead we find the king's army.

624
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,653
Well, I shall take on the king.

625
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:03,535
And after that if needs must,
I'll take on Manchester as well!

626
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:28,132
Before you stands the enemy,
his three to every one of us.

627
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,848
And where, in God's name, is Manchester?

628
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,969
My Lord Manchester will rue the
day he has not joined us here.

629
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,852
And now to your positions.

630
00:59:37,061 --> 00:59:39,894
These tactics we have practiced
often enough these past six months

631
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,091
now let us put them to the test.

632
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:48,170
For upon this field of Naseby, we'll
turn the tide of this unhappy war.

633
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,096
God be with you all.

634
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,449
Is this wise, Oliver?
We're heavily outnumbered.

635
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,574
Was not Gideon outnumbered
by the Amalekites?

636
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:09,137
It is not numbers that
count, but speed and surprise.

637
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:14,537
Let no man move, except upon
the word of his commander!

638
01:00:15,775 --> 01:00:19,768
Though we be outnumbered,
we shall win this battle!

639
01:00:19,975 --> 01:00:22,170
I promise you!

640
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:28,007
So now put your faith in
God and keep your powder dry.

641
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:13,047
Halt!

642
01:01:47,735 --> 01:01:50,932
Attack order. Double line abreast.

643
01:01:51,135 --> 01:01:54,332
Forward. MAN: Forward!

644
01:02:11,335 --> 01:02:13,405
The man must be mad.

645
01:02:13,655 --> 01:02:14,883
Prepare to attack.

646
01:02:15,095 --> 01:02:18,167
Prepare to attack!

647
01:02:22,895 --> 01:02:25,250
Our swords are in God's hand.

648
01:02:25,455 --> 01:02:28,288
And our faith is in the Lord.

649
01:02:28,535 --> 01:02:30,651
Charge!

650
01:02:33,295 --> 01:02:34,774
Fire!

651
01:02:40,535 --> 01:02:43,891
Forward!

652
01:03:10,135 --> 01:03:12,046
Colonel!

653
01:03:19,055 --> 01:03:22,172
Regroup! Regroup!

654
01:03:25,016 --> 01:03:28,213
After them!

655
01:03:49,615 --> 01:03:51,526
Advance!

656
01:03:59,015 --> 01:04:01,290
To the rear!

657
01:04:11,735 --> 01:04:14,533
Forward!

658
01:04:24,415 --> 01:04:25,973
Come on, lads!

659
01:04:26,135 --> 01:04:28,330
At the gallop!

660
01:04:54,735 --> 01:04:57,203
Your Majesty, may I
suggest that we withdraw?

661
01:04:57,415 --> 01:04:58,928
No.

662
01:06:06,335 --> 01:06:08,053
Who goes there?

663
01:06:09,775 --> 01:06:12,812
RICHARD: Captain Cromwell, 3rd Cavalry.

664
01:06:13,015 --> 01:06:14,573
Richard.

665
01:06:15,015 --> 01:06:16,926
Thanks be to God.

666
01:06:17,135 --> 01:06:19,524
Where is Oliver?

667
01:07:21,975 --> 01:07:26,446
The outrageous incompetence
and inefficiency

668
01:07:26,655 --> 01:07:29,044
of the high command
have tried my patience

669
01:07:29,255 --> 01:07:33,214
and that of my hard-pressed
army long enough.

670
01:07:33,415 --> 01:07:38,489
By my faith, I swear it would be
better that those gallant generals

671
01:07:38,695 --> 01:07:42,370
Essex and Manchester, took
up swords with the king.

672
01:07:42,575 --> 01:07:45,487
For then might we be assured of victory.

673
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:46,810
Hear, hear.

674
01:07:47,015 --> 01:07:52,089
For by their reluctance to pursue
this war with the intensity it demands,

675
01:07:52,295 --> 01:07:56,891
they have proved treacherous both
to our cause and to this nation.

676
01:07:57,095 --> 01:07:59,211
Hear, hear.

677
01:07:59,415 --> 01:08:02,566
If we beat the king 99 times,

678
01:08:02,775 --> 01:08:05,653
he will still be our
king and we his subjects.

679
01:08:06,735 --> 01:08:10,887
If he beats us but once,
we shall all be hanged.

680
01:08:11,495 --> 01:08:15,727
If that is so, then why
in the bowels of Christ

681
01:08:15,935 --> 01:08:20,486
did we take up arms against
him in the first place?

682
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,092
Gentlemen,

683
01:08:29,575 --> 01:08:33,853
honest men have served us faithfully

684
01:08:34,055 --> 01:08:36,410
and many have died

685
01:08:36,615 --> 01:08:42,212
that this House may sit in freedom
and this nation live in liberty.

686
01:08:42,415 --> 01:08:46,374
In the name of God, I beseech you,

687
01:08:46,575 --> 01:08:50,170
do not desert them now.

688
01:08:56,055 --> 01:08:59,445
Unless Parliament supports
this war to the full,

689
01:08:59,655 --> 01:09:03,614
I am bound to say, in all conscience,
that I will lay down my sword

690
01:09:03,775 --> 01:09:06,573
and let this House make
its peace with the king,

691
01:09:06,736 --> 01:09:09,728
be that peace ever so base.

692
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:21,005
Then, it is for this House to decide.

693
01:09:21,215 --> 01:09:22,967
I move that this House demands

694
01:09:23,175 --> 01:09:26,247
the immediate resignation
of the high command

695
01:09:26,415 --> 01:09:29,088
upon the grounds that
they be no longer competent

696
01:09:29,255 --> 01:09:32,327
to command the armed
forces of this Parliament.

697
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:37,890
Order. Order. Order!

698
01:09:38,096 --> 01:09:41,372
The motion has been proposed.
Let it now be put to the question.

699
01:09:41,535 --> 01:09:43,810
Those against Cromwell's
motion. MEN: No!

700
01:09:44,015 --> 01:09:46,813
Those in favour of the motion. MEN: Aye!

701
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:49,370
The ayes have it. The motion be carried.

702
01:09:52,095 --> 01:09:54,290
I move...

703
01:09:54,495 --> 01:09:57,692
I move that Colonel
Cromwell be appointed

704
01:09:57,895 --> 01:09:59,647
commander in chief of the army.

705
01:09:59,855 --> 01:10:02,369
Yeah!

706
01:10:25,495 --> 01:10:29,568
Bristol. We must dispatch aid to
Bristol with all possible speed,

707
01:10:29,775 --> 01:10:32,847
for as long as Rupert holds
Bristol, this war be not lost.

708
01:10:33,055 --> 01:10:36,286
General Digby, if you can
detach your forces in this area

709
01:10:36,495 --> 01:10:38,690
and approach Bristol
from the east-

710
01:10:38,895 --> 01:10:44,094
To do that, my lord, would be to
expose this city to immediate attack.

711
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:48,530
Then we move the Marquis
of Huntly's army southward.

712
01:10:48,735 --> 01:10:53,763
The marquis, my lord, surrendered
to Cromwell's forces yesterday.

713
01:10:53,975 --> 01:10:57,411
Cromwell. I hear nothing
but Cromwell, Cromwell.

714
01:10:57,615 --> 01:10:59,845
My lord, it is but a game we play here,

715
01:11:00,015 --> 01:11:03,325
a game with wooden
armies and paper flags.

716
01:11:05,135 --> 01:11:07,569
'Tis but a block of wood
you hold in your hand.

717
01:11:07,735 --> 01:11:13,890
My lords, all I ask for is a little
time. Time, my lord, costs us heavily.

718
01:11:16,135 --> 01:11:19,207
If we can hold on here
in Oxford for six weeks,

719
01:11:19,415 --> 01:11:22,930
the Scots have promised
an army of 20,000 men.

720
01:11:23,136 --> 01:11:27,766
Her Majesty is in communication
with my cousin, the king of France,

721
01:11:28,775 --> 01:11:32,927
and I have good reason to
hope for support from Ireland.

722
01:11:33,655 --> 01:11:36,249
An army from Ireland, Your Majesty?

723
01:11:36,455 --> 01:11:39,333
I would as soon join
forces with Cromwell himself

724
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:41,451
as take up arms with the Catholics!

725
01:11:41,615 --> 01:11:44,004
I am the king and defender of my people

726
01:11:44,215 --> 01:11:47,969
and I maintain the right to seek
relief from no matter what quarter.

727
01:11:48,175 --> 01:11:51,292
As king, my lord, it is your God-given
duty to defend the faith of this nation.

728
01:11:51,455 --> 01:11:53,207
I do what I think to be right, sir.

729
01:11:53,455 --> 01:11:55,810
Catholics as allies! It is unthinkable!

730
01:11:56,015 --> 01:11:57,926
My God, if it has come to this,

731
01:11:58,095 --> 01:12:03,328
let us rather sue for an honourable
peace than fight a dishonourable war.

732
01:12:03,935 --> 01:12:07,132
I will not countenance defeat.

733
01:12:08,015 --> 01:12:10,609
Rather than abandon my
kingdom to Parliament,

734
01:12:10,815 --> 01:12:15,047
I would come to terms
with the devil himself.

735
01:12:16,455 --> 01:12:19,367
Since you came to the
throne, Your Majesty,

736
01:12:19,575 --> 01:12:23,614
your armies have persistently
persecuted our Church in Ireland.

737
01:12:24,015 --> 01:12:28,964
And yet, now that your need is
great, you turn to us for help.

738
01:12:30,255 --> 01:12:32,644
The king's actions in
Ireland, Your Excellency,

739
01:12:32,855 --> 01:12:36,245
will seem as nothing should
these Puritans come to power.

740
01:12:36,455 --> 01:12:41,245
It is not only the Crown of England
that is in peril, Excellency.

741
01:12:41,455 --> 01:12:43,650
All institutions of established order

742
01:12:43,855 --> 01:12:46,574
throughout the countries
of Europe are threatened.

743
01:12:46,735 --> 01:12:51,490
An Irish army of 20,000
men, even 15,000,

744
01:12:51,695 --> 01:12:53,686
would forestall such a threat

745
01:12:53,896 --> 01:12:57,935
and bring this wretched
war to a speedy end.

746
01:12:58,735 --> 01:13:02,171
I am instructed to say that His Holiness

747
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:07,290
would permit an Irish force to
take up arms in this country.

748
01:13:08,335 --> 01:13:10,451
But there are certain conditions.

749
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:15,012
First, the Catholic Church in
Ireland must be completely restored

750
01:13:15,735 --> 01:13:20,206
and permitted to practice freely
without interference or oppression.

751
01:13:20,415 --> 01:13:25,045
Secondly, all Protestant
churches in Ireland must be closed

752
01:13:25,495 --> 01:13:30,285
and all Protestant bishops and
ministers removed from office.

753
01:13:30,655 --> 01:13:35,445
Oh, there are one or two other minor
conditions of little consequence.

754
01:13:35,655 --> 01:13:38,453
What you demand, Excellency,
would be a betrayal

755
01:13:38,655 --> 01:13:42,489
of my coronation oath as
head of the English Church.

756
01:13:42,695 --> 01:13:45,209
You have a duty, Charles, to the Crown.

757
01:13:45,415 --> 01:13:48,612
For without that, you
will be head of nothing!

758
01:13:48,815 --> 01:13:52,603
May I tell His Holiness that you
will agree to these conditions?

759
01:14:01,295 --> 01:14:03,286
You have something to
say to me, Sir Edward?

760
01:14:03,735 --> 01:14:07,284
Your Majesty, His Highness Prince
Rupert attends in the council chamber.

761
01:14:07,775 --> 01:14:11,609
Rupert? Here in Oxford? Yes, my lord.

762
01:14:12,575 --> 01:14:14,008
I fear Bristol has fallen.

763
01:14:21,575 --> 01:14:25,887
Your Excellency will
excuse me. Your Majesty.

764
01:14:28,095 --> 01:14:31,405
My lords, His Majesty.

765
01:14:38,735 --> 01:14:41,772
Do you not rise, sir,
when your king approaches?

766
01:14:41,975 --> 01:14:46,605
Rise, sir! Or to your knees in shame.

767
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:53,168
You did give me your most solemn promise

768
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:55,969
that you would hold
Bristol for four months.

769
01:14:56,175 --> 01:14:58,166
Yet you have not held it for four weeks!

770
01:14:58,375 --> 01:15:02,766
You promised mountains,
yet you perform molehills.

771
01:15:02,975 --> 01:15:05,284
You make a knave of your king.

772
01:15:05,495 --> 01:15:07,167
My lord,

773
01:15:07,375 --> 01:15:10,094
we were besieged on all sides.

774
01:15:10,296 --> 01:15:14,528
Our men are foot-weary from battle,
ailing with plague and sickness.

775
01:15:15,056 --> 01:15:19,368
Yet you contrived to
escape with your life.

776
01:15:19,575 --> 01:15:22,647
I have brought you an army, my lord.

777
01:15:22,855 --> 01:15:27,975
An army 2000 strong, ready and
willing to fight on for their king!

778
01:15:28,175 --> 01:15:32,487
In exchange for all the corn and stores
you held in Bristol and 200 cannon.

779
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:34,174
That was the price of your freedom, sir.

780
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:36,286
I did what I considered to be right!

781
01:15:36,535 --> 01:15:40,323
You deserted your command, sir.

782
01:15:40,535 --> 01:15:42,571
I made a military decision.

783
01:15:42,775 --> 01:15:46,563
A decision that may
have cost us this war.

784
01:16:01,415 --> 01:16:06,409
Your action in this matter is
of such affliction to me, sir,

785
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:10,844
that it is the greatest trial
that has yet befallen me.

786
01:16:13,895 --> 01:16:16,284
My conclusion is

787
01:16:16,495 --> 01:16:22,047
to desire you to seek subsistence
elsewhere, not in my kingdom.

788
01:16:29,615 --> 01:16:32,129
Most gracious lord,

789
01:16:32,335 --> 01:16:35,566
I do not crave forgiveness,
for by all as I hold most dear,

790
01:16:35,735 --> 01:16:38,374
I do solemnly swear that
I acted only in good faith!

791
01:16:38,895 --> 01:16:41,363
The matter is at an
end. I will hear no more.

792
01:16:41,615 --> 01:16:43,810
My lord!

793
01:16:44,055 --> 01:16:46,774
My lord, I beseech you.

794
01:16:47,935 --> 01:16:52,326
In God's name, allow that I may die
with honour. Condemn me not to live.

795
01:16:52,535 --> 01:16:53,490
Captain Lundsford.

796
01:16:53,735 --> 01:16:57,774
Do not put upon these shoulders the
terrible shame of exile and dishonour.

797
01:16:57,975 --> 01:17:02,014
I beg you, take my
life, most noble lord.

798
01:17:03,015 --> 01:17:04,971
Good Uncle,

799
01:17:05,175 --> 01:17:07,848
for pity's sake!

800
01:17:08,055 --> 01:17:10,523
His Highness is to be
kept under close guard

801
01:17:10,735 --> 01:17:13,488
until such time as he is deported.

802
01:17:14,495 --> 01:17:16,565
Very well, Your Majesty.

803
01:18:57,375 --> 01:19:02,085
Father, Mother says I'm to
go with her tonight to France.

804
01:19:02,415 --> 01:19:05,851
Is that your wish, Father? Yes.

805
01:19:06,055 --> 01:19:09,411
My duty is to stay here with
you and fight beside you.

806
01:19:09,615 --> 01:19:12,368
Your place now is at your
mother's side, Charles.

807
01:19:12,575 --> 01:19:17,251
You will help her raise
money, perhaps an army.

808
01:19:17,735 --> 01:19:22,411
Should I meet my death, and
you are safely in France,

809
01:19:22,615 --> 01:19:27,848
then England will still
have, in you, a lawful king.

810
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:29,727
You will go with your mother.

811
01:19:38,735 --> 01:19:41,613
I love this land.

812
01:19:42,255 --> 01:19:46,692
And when this great
responsibility becomes yours

813
01:19:46,895 --> 01:19:50,012
then I pray that with God's help,

814
01:19:50,215 --> 01:19:54,686
you will reign more
happily than I have done.

815
01:19:58,615 --> 01:20:03,564
Now go, with God's speed
and your father's blessing.

816
01:20:11,055 --> 01:20:13,011
Oh, Charles.

817
01:20:35,655 --> 01:20:38,328
I love you.

818
01:21:27,935 --> 01:21:32,531
Your Majesty, it is my most solemn
duty to place you under arrest.

819
01:21:33,775 --> 01:21:38,644
By whose command, sir? By the
command of Parliament, sir.

820
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:44,407
I know of no authority in
England above that of the king.

821
01:21:46,975 --> 01:21:50,012
It is upon that issue
that this war was fought.

822
01:21:53,815 --> 01:21:57,125
Whither am I to be
taken? To London, sir.

823
01:21:59,295 --> 01:22:03,049
You must grant me a little time
to- We leave for London at once.

824
01:22:03,255 --> 01:22:07,248
And my children, what of them? We
will take care of your children.

825
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:11,209
His Majesty will have
all the time he requires.

826
01:22:11,415 --> 01:22:14,293
As for your children, sir,
you may take them with you.

827
01:22:18,575 --> 01:22:21,214
I thank you, sir.

828
01:22:35,855 --> 01:22:38,415
<i>PEOPLE SINGING: Him serve with fear</i>

829
01:22:38,615 --> 01:22:42,847
<i>His praise foretell</i>

830
01:22:43,055 --> 01:22:46,411
<i>Come ye before him</i>

831
01:22:46,615 --> 01:22:51,006
<i>And rejoice</i>

832
01:22:51,215 --> 01:22:54,093
<i>The Lord ye know</i>

833
01:22:54,295 --> 01:22:58,527
<i>Is God indeed</i>

834
01:22:58,735 --> 01:23:01,408
<i>Without our aid</i>

835
01:23:01,615 --> 01:23:05,972
<i>He did us mak e</i>

836
01:23:06,175 --> 01:23:08,131
<i>We are his flock</i>

837
01:23:08,335 --> 01:23:11,486
General, John Pym is dead.

838
01:23:13,135 --> 01:23:15,808
<i>And for his sheep</i>

839
01:23:16,016 --> 01:23:20,771
<i>He doth us tak e</i>

840
01:23:22,695 --> 01:23:24,811
When did it happen? This morning.

841
01:23:25,015 --> 01:23:28,690
What is it? John Pym is dead.

842
01:23:28,895 --> 01:23:31,693
Parliament is discussing
peace terms with the king.

843
01:23:31,895 --> 01:23:33,726
Does the army have no say in this?

844
01:23:33,895 --> 01:23:36,011
The army has been ordered to disband.

845
01:23:36,175 --> 01:23:38,245
In God's name, did we fight this war

846
01:23:38,415 --> 01:23:41,407
that the politicians should
take over behind our backs?!

847
01:23:41,575 --> 01:23:44,089
If Parliament has decided
the army will disband,

848
01:23:44,255 --> 01:23:45,813
then the army will disband.

849
01:23:46,055 --> 01:23:47,807
I say we take the army
and march on Parliament.

850
01:23:48,055 --> 01:23:50,967
The sword will not rule this land.

851
01:23:51,175 --> 01:23:53,530
We fought to institute
a parliamentary system

852
01:23:53,735 --> 01:23:58,331
and overthrow the very
tyranny which you now propose.

853
01:23:58,535 --> 01:24:00,765
And who is talking to
the king? Parliament?

854
01:24:00,975 --> 01:24:04,047
I doubt it. I warrant I know
who is doing all the talking.

855
01:24:08,695 --> 01:24:13,849
I have these past three days been in
consultation with His Majesty the king.

856
01:24:14,055 --> 01:24:16,444
And I am pleased to inform the House

857
01:24:16,655 --> 01:24:19,772
that the king is now prepared
to discuss peace terms

858
01:24:19,975 --> 01:24:24,446
provided that the army stand down.

859
01:24:25,215 --> 01:24:31,211
I have given this House's assurance
that his wishes will be complied with.

860
01:24:31,415 --> 01:24:34,054
Further, in recognition
of the very great debt

861
01:24:34,255 --> 01:24:37,133
this House owes its
commander, General Cromwell,

862
01:24:37,335 --> 01:24:40,771
it is proposed to award him a
pension of 3000 pounds a year

863
01:24:41,455 --> 01:24:44,094
together with certain estates
in the county of Cambridge.

864
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:51,691
It is further proposed that
the sum of 2000 pounds-

865
01:24:54,935 --> 01:25:00,771
Such low treachery is not worthy
even of you, my Lord Manchester.

866
01:25:01,975 --> 01:25:05,206
Am I to believe my ears?

867
01:25:05,415 --> 01:25:07,770
Did this nation win a bloody civil war

868
01:25:07,975 --> 01:25:11,172
in order the king should
dictate the terms of peace?

869
01:25:11,535 --> 01:25:14,686
I have already discussed the matter
at great length with His Majesty-

870
01:25:14,895 --> 01:25:18,649
You have discussed it? It is a
matter for this House to discuss.

871
01:25:18,855 --> 01:25:20,254
Hear, hear!

872
01:25:20,455 --> 01:25:24,573
The king will not come to terms,
sir, until the army stand down.

873
01:25:24,775 --> 01:25:26,174
Hear, hear.

874
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:31,608
And the army will not stand down
until the king comes to terms.

875
01:25:31,815 --> 01:25:34,124
So if the king will
not talk to this House,

876
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:36,251
then let the king talk to the army.

877
01:25:37,095 --> 01:25:40,007
Out of the question. The
king would never agree.

878
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:46,132
Parliament is behind us, sir, and on
this occasion, we have the majority.

879
01:25:51,535 --> 01:25:54,095
Sir Thomas Fairfax.

880
01:26:07,215 --> 01:26:11,254
He's bringing in the
army! SPEAKER: Order! Order!

881
01:26:11,495 --> 01:26:13,611
Order, I say!

882
01:26:14,055 --> 01:26:17,172
Order! Silence! Order!

883
01:26:18,095 --> 01:26:19,847
Order!

884
01:26:20,055 --> 01:26:21,613
Silence!

885
01:26:21,815 --> 01:26:23,248
Order!

886
01:26:24,535 --> 01:26:28,813
I believe, my Lord Manchester,
that now I have the majority.

887
01:26:29,295 --> 01:26:32,605
This is dictatorship. It
will mean a new civil war.

888
01:26:33,895 --> 01:26:35,851
Order!

889
01:26:37,215 --> 01:26:39,649
Honourable members,

890
01:26:40,615 --> 01:26:44,927
I swear before my God that
you give me no alternative.

891
01:26:45,136 --> 01:26:48,014
When those liberties for
which this army and this nation

892
01:26:48,215 --> 01:26:52,367
have fought so hard are
most solemnly guaranteed

893
01:26:52,575 --> 01:26:55,043
then this army will stand down.

894
01:26:55,255 --> 01:26:59,771
And upon that, you have
my most sacred promise.

895
01:27:26,655 --> 01:27:30,011
And who have we here? It is I, my lord.

896
01:27:30,215 --> 01:27:33,093
You were supposed to have run,
Sir Edward, not let me catch you.

897
01:27:33,295 --> 01:27:37,368
I'm afraid I'm getting a little
too old for such games, my lord.

898
01:27:37,575 --> 01:27:41,409
Cromwell is here to see you. Oh.

899
01:27:44,615 --> 01:27:46,810
You must play on your own now, children.

900
01:27:46,975 --> 01:27:50,729
Your father has other games to play.

901
01:27:50,935 --> 01:27:55,053
Prince Henry, you will be good
enough to give me back my hat.

902
01:27:55,775 --> 01:27:57,606
Sir.

903
01:28:10,935 --> 01:28:14,564
Gentlemen, His Majesty.

904
01:28:22,175 --> 01:28:24,370
We came to present our terms, my lord.

905
01:28:24,575 --> 01:28:28,284
If Your Majesty will be so kind
as to study these proposals.

906
01:28:28,495 --> 01:28:31,965
Has Parliament approved this
treaty? Parliament no longer truly

907
01:28:32,135 --> 01:28:34,808
represents the people of
this nation, Sir Edward.

908
01:28:34,975 --> 01:28:36,374
And you, Mr. Cromwell,

909
01:28:36,535 --> 01:28:39,447
do you truly represent
the people of this nation?

910
01:28:40,415 --> 01:28:42,645
I represent the army, sir,

911
01:28:42,855 --> 01:28:46,291
and the army is the heart
and conscience of the people.

912
01:28:46,455 --> 01:28:51,370
So having failed to come
to terms with Parliament,

913
01:28:51,575 --> 01:28:54,726
you would now negotiate with the king.

914
01:28:54,935 --> 01:28:58,450
I am not bound to negotiate with anyone.

915
01:28:58,655 --> 01:29:00,532
<i>With 50,000 men under my command</i>

916
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:04,125
I could impose a government
on this nation overnight.

917
01:29:04,335 --> 01:29:08,806
One is given to wondering, Mr.
Cromwell, why you do not do that.

918
01:29:09,015 --> 01:29:11,768
I am deeply convinced, my lord,
it be the duty of Parliament

919
01:29:11,975 --> 01:29:15,365
to frame a constitutional
government, and not the army.

920
01:29:15,575 --> 01:29:18,294
Then I do not see that you
have any need of me at all.

921
01:29:18,775 --> 01:29:20,925
On the contrary, sir.

922
01:29:21,135 --> 01:29:24,844
An England without a
king is unthinkable.

923
01:29:25,055 --> 01:29:28,127
But withal, a king
that can command respect

924
01:29:28,335 --> 01:29:30,769
a monarch who governs, not from fear,

925
01:29:30,935 --> 01:29:33,654
but by the affection of a free people.

926
01:29:34,735 --> 01:29:38,330
Such a king could reunite
this great nation of ours

927
01:29:38,935 --> 01:29:44,009
and make the name of England
the noblest in all Christendom.

928
01:29:44,215 --> 01:29:46,490
Should you adorn that
inheritance, my lord,

929
01:29:46,695 --> 01:29:49,653
all Englishmen would be
proud to call you king.

930
01:29:51,215 --> 01:29:55,413
Mr. Cromwell, I do confess
that I did greatly misjudge you,

931
01:29:55,615 --> 01:29:58,288
for I did mark you as an ambitious man.

932
01:29:59,615 --> 01:30:03,767
To these ends, my lord, I am ambitious.

933
01:30:03,975 --> 01:30:06,887
Then you have my respect, sir.

934
01:30:07,535 --> 01:30:09,173
Thank you, my lord.

935
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:16,846
We shall return in the morning, sir. I
shall require a little longer to study

936
01:30:17,055 --> 01:30:18,852
this document. Perhaps a week.

937
01:30:19,415 --> 01:30:21,406
As Your Majesty pleases.

938
01:30:21,615 --> 01:30:26,166
I sincerely hope that our future
relations may be equally amiable, sir.

939
01:30:27,095 --> 01:30:30,326
That is my hope also, my lord.

940
01:30:35,695 --> 01:30:37,492
A cunning fellow.

941
01:30:37,695 --> 01:30:39,413
I believe him to be a
sincere man, my lord.

942
01:30:39,615 --> 01:30:40,604
Indeed.

943
01:30:40,815 --> 01:30:43,010
If these proposals be acceptable,

944
01:30:43,215 --> 01:30:47,128
there never was a Crown so
nearly lost, so easily recovered.

945
01:30:47,335 --> 01:30:50,532
Whatever these proposals
may be, Sir Edward,

946
01:30:50,735 --> 01:30:54,330
they are not acceptable to the king.

947
01:30:59,935 --> 01:31:02,005
Cromwell has
betrayed us! CROWD: Aye!

948
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:06,573
We have given our blood and our lives
in this war to put down this king!

949
01:31:06,775 --> 01:31:08,970
If Cromwell comes to terms with him now,

950
01:31:09,535 --> 01:31:11,969
what price our freedom then?

951
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:14,370
Get back, will you?!

952
01:31:14,575 --> 01:31:19,649
I have served General Cromwell
faithfully all my life,

953
01:31:19,855 --> 01:31:25,373
and I reckoned him to be a man who
feared God and did honour his word!

954
01:31:25,975 --> 01:31:31,572
But in this business he has shown
himself to be a man of no honour!

955
01:31:31,775 --> 01:31:32,890
Aye!

956
01:31:33,735 --> 01:31:38,809
We fought this war to remove this king,

957
01:31:39,015 --> 01:31:41,290
not to put him back on the throne!

958
01:31:41,535 --> 01:31:45,767
Aye! I say, let us march on London,

959
01:31:45,976 --> 01:31:47,807
let us take Parliament,

960
01:31:48,335 --> 01:31:50,929
and then let the king
try to negotiate with us!

961
01:31:56,775 --> 01:31:58,413
Make way for Cromwell.

962
01:31:58,615 --> 01:32:02,051
Traitors! Mutineers!

963
01:32:02,735 --> 01:32:06,728
I don't have to tell you, any of
you, you could all be hanged for this.

964
01:32:06,975 --> 01:32:09,728
We are not serfs,
general, nor mercenaries.

965
01:32:09,975 --> 01:32:13,524
We fought for the Lord in our cause,
and now we have a right to speak.

966
01:32:13,775 --> 01:32:18,291
You have no rights to
preach revolt and mutiny.

967
01:32:18,495 --> 01:32:22,852
As for you, John Carter, I did expect
a greater degree of loyalty from you.

968
01:32:23,095 --> 01:32:26,690
I am still loyal to what I fought
for, sir. Can the same be said of you?

969
01:32:26,935 --> 01:32:31,292
I have not betrayed my God,
country, Parliament or my conscience.

970
01:32:31,535 --> 01:32:35,164
Where was your conscience this day,
when you parleyed with the king?

971
01:32:35,415 --> 01:32:38,327
I tell you, all of you,

972
01:32:38,535 --> 01:32:42,767
I do most honestly believe that
we have taught this king a lesson.

973
01:32:42,975 --> 01:32:47,685
And he will prove most honourable.
Upon that I would stake my life.

974
01:32:48,335 --> 01:32:50,485
Traitor! Traitor!

975
01:32:50,695 --> 01:32:53,767
This is a military camp,
sir, not a debating chamber.

976
01:32:54,055 --> 01:32:57,127
Under military law, any man
inciting mutiny can be hanged.

977
01:32:57,335 --> 01:32:58,814
Colonel Harrison. Yes, General.

978
01:32:59,055 --> 01:33:02,570
These three men will draw lots.
One of them will be hanged.

979
01:33:02,775 --> 01:33:06,290
Captain Lancing, get a
length of rope. Yes, sir.

980
01:33:06,495 --> 01:33:07,450
You, man. Yes, sir.

981
01:33:07,655 --> 01:33:08,610
Pick up some straws.

982
01:33:30,815 --> 01:33:34,854
General, there is a Sir
Edward Hyde to see you.

983
01:33:42,895 --> 01:33:46,046
Sir Edward, has the king
considered our terms?

984
01:33:46,255 --> 01:33:48,815
The king, sir, has not
even read your terms.

985
01:33:49,015 --> 01:33:53,088
Nor, will I venture, has he
any intention of so doing.

986
01:33:53,295 --> 01:33:56,367
He has, this day, drawn up a secret
treaty with Manchester and Essex

987
01:33:56,535 --> 01:34:00,448
to raise a Scottish army
against the Parliamentary forces.

988
01:34:00,655 --> 01:34:04,694
He has already consented to
a Catholic army from Ireland.

989
01:34:04,895 --> 01:34:07,329
While you negotiate
a settlement with him,

990
01:34:07,535 --> 01:34:11,244
he is planning a second civil war.

991
01:34:16,095 --> 01:34:20,885
I do confess that I have these many
years given my allegiance to a man

992
01:34:21,375 --> 01:34:24,924
not worthy of the
title, king of England.

993
01:34:30,335 --> 01:34:32,769
Colonel Harrison!

994
01:34:53,775 --> 01:34:56,608
I will have this king's head..

995
01:34:56,815 --> 01:35:01,935
Aye, and the Crown upon it.

996
01:35:04,455 --> 01:35:08,607
This obstinate king, this man of blood,

997
01:35:08,815 --> 01:35:13,252
whose heart God has hardened,
can no longer be trusted.

998
01:35:13,455 --> 01:35:18,085
For in prodigious treason, he has
revealed himself to be a traitor.

999
01:35:18,295 --> 01:35:20,445
A man of no honour.

1000
01:35:20,655 --> 01:35:25,410
A man unfitted to bear
the title, king of England.

1001
01:35:25,615 --> 01:35:27,890
Hear, hear.

1002
01:35:28,095 --> 01:35:30,689
I demand, therefore,
in the name of the army

1003
01:35:30,895 --> 01:35:34,683
and the people of this nation
that Charles I, king of England,

1004
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:41,084
be brought hence to stand trial
for his life on a charge of treason.

1005
01:35:45,175 --> 01:35:48,690
Oyez, oyez, oyez.

1006
01:35:48,895 --> 01:35:50,123
All manner of persons

1007
01:35:50,295 --> 01:35:52,525
having anything to do with this court,

1008
01:35:52,695 --> 01:35:55,255
come forward and give your attendance.

1009
01:35:55,415 --> 01:35:59,203
Every man to keep silence
upon pain of imprisonment.

1010
01:35:59,415 --> 01:36:02,293
God save the king.

1011
01:36:23,455 --> 01:36:26,652
Let the prisoner be brought in.

1012
01:37:03,175 --> 01:37:06,724
The clerk of arraigns
will read the charges.

1013
01:37:09,695 --> 01:37:12,607
"Charles Stuart, king of England,

1014
01:37:12,815 --> 01:37:16,091
you stand before this court
charged with high treason.

1015
01:37:16,295 --> 01:37:20,083
In that being admitted king of
England, and therein trusted with power

1016
01:37:20,295 --> 01:37:24,334
to govern according to the laws,
you did out of wickedness and design

1017
01:37:24,535 --> 01:37:28,926
erect and uphold in yourself an
unlimited and tyrannical power.

1018
01:37:29,135 --> 01:37:33,333
To rule at your will and overthrow
the rights and liberties of the people.

1019
01:37:33,575 --> 01:37:38,695
And that you did traitorously
and maliciously levy a cruel war

1020
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:40,806
against Parliament and the people.

1021
01:37:41,055 --> 01:37:46,766
And are therefore guilty of all the
treasons, rapings, burnings, spoils,

1022
01:37:46,975 --> 01:37:51,765
desolations, damages and mischiefs to
the nation committed in the said war.

1023
01:37:52,015 --> 01:37:55,087
Thus, on behalf of
the people of England,

1024
01:37:55,295 --> 01:37:57,729
this court impeaches you as a tyrant,

1025
01:37:57,935 --> 01:38:02,884
traitor, murderer and public enemy
to the Commonwealth of England. "

1026
01:38:03,095 --> 01:38:05,051
God save the king!

1027
01:38:05,255 --> 01:38:07,132
Silence!

1028
01:38:10,215 --> 01:38:14,766
Sir, you have heard
the charges against you.

1029
01:38:15,215 --> 01:38:17,445
The court expects an answer.

1030
01:38:17,655 --> 01:38:22,570
First, I would know by what
authority, I mean lawful authority,

1031
01:38:22,775 --> 01:38:26,688
I am brought here and carried from
place to place, and I know not what.

1032
01:38:26,895 --> 01:38:30,888
And by what authority you
presume to sit in judgement on me.

1033
01:38:31,615 --> 01:38:34,493
Remember, I am your lawful king.

1034
01:38:35,375 --> 01:38:37,127
Think well upon it.

1035
01:38:37,335 --> 01:38:41,806
I have a trust committed to me
by God, by old and lawful descent.

1036
01:38:42,015 --> 01:38:45,644
Therefore, let me know by what
authority I am brought here,

1037
01:38:45,855 --> 01:38:47,288
and I shall answer.

1038
01:38:47,775 --> 01:38:50,335
It is not for the prisoner
to question the court.

1039
01:38:53,295 --> 01:38:56,412
I am no ordinary prisoner, sir.

1040
01:38:57,495 --> 01:39:00,805
An answer, sir, the
court demands an answer.

1041
01:39:02,775 --> 01:39:04,493
Then I refuse an answer.

1042
01:39:04,695 --> 01:39:07,687
Sir, you are before a court of justice.

1043
01:39:09,295 --> 01:39:11,206
Well, sir...

1044
01:39:11,415 --> 01:39:13,770
I see that I am before a power.

1045
01:39:16,255 --> 01:39:18,485
The court will keep silent.

1046
01:39:19,695 --> 01:39:22,448
Mr. Solicitor General, are
your witnesses prepared?

1047
01:39:22,655 --> 01:39:25,328
They are, my lord. Then
let them be brought forth.

1048
01:39:25,535 --> 01:39:28,766
Call Sir Edward Hyde.

1049
01:39:34,935 --> 01:39:39,963
And you saw the king and his
wife alone in their chambers

1050
01:39:40,175 --> 01:39:44,214
with this Catholic Archbishop Rinuccini?

1051
01:39:44,415 --> 01:39:45,894
I did.

1052
01:39:46,095 --> 01:39:49,485
And what did you assume was
the purpose of this meeting?

1053
01:39:58,575 --> 01:40:00,645
You are obliged to answer, Sir Edward.

1054
01:40:02,775 --> 01:40:04,527
To raise an Irish army, my lord.

1055
01:40:04,975 --> 01:40:08,490
To fight against the
Parliamentary forces?

1056
01:40:09,935 --> 01:40:13,325
And at this time, was
the king in communication

1057
01:40:13,535 --> 01:40:16,049
with any other foreign power?

1058
01:40:18,015 --> 01:40:23,009
Yes. Yes, with the king of
France and with the Dutch.

1059
01:40:23,215 --> 01:40:26,287
For the same purpose? Yes.

1060
01:40:27,055 --> 01:40:32,049
To raise a foreign army
to invade this country,

1061
01:40:32,255 --> 01:40:37,887
and to perpetuate the war against
the people of this kingdom.

1062
01:40:44,015 --> 01:40:46,290
Sir Edward?

1063
01:40:49,615 --> 01:40:50,968
Yes.

1064
01:40:53,215 --> 01:40:55,729
To the block with him!

1065
01:41:37,135 --> 01:41:40,730
Sir, throughout the three
days of this hearing,

1066
01:41:40,935 --> 01:41:44,211
this court has patiently
awaited your pleasure

1067
01:41:44,415 --> 01:41:47,930
to hear what you have to say in
answer to the charges against you.

1068
01:41:48,135 --> 01:41:50,046
Yet you have declined to speak.

1069
01:41:50,255 --> 01:41:54,487
I am most willing, sir, to
answer before Parliament,

1070
01:41:54,695 --> 01:41:57,448
but not before this assembly

1071
01:41:57,775 --> 01:42:01,370
whose authority I refuse to acknowledge.

1072
01:42:02,055 --> 01:42:05,684
Sir, what answers you may offer
the commons can be given here.

1073
01:42:05,895 --> 01:42:09,171
For this court does sit in the
name of the House of Commons.

1074
01:42:09,775 --> 01:42:13,927
Sir, if, as you have said, you do
love the liberty of the subject,

1075
01:42:14,135 --> 01:42:18,333
you will grant me, your king,
a hearing before Parliament,

1076
01:42:18,535 --> 01:42:22,130
which is the lords
and commons assembled.

1077
01:42:23,055 --> 01:42:26,252
Sir, I submit you seek only
to delay the course of justice.

1078
01:42:26,615 --> 01:42:29,607
By your favour, sir, I
seek only those rights

1079
01:42:29,815 --> 01:42:34,889
which, as your king, I would
grant to any one of my subjects.

1080
01:42:36,935 --> 01:42:38,573
Silence!

1081
01:42:40,855 --> 01:42:44,086
Sir, this court requires to
know if you have anything to say

1082
01:42:44,295 --> 01:42:47,128
before judgement is passed upon you.

1083
01:42:47,495 --> 01:42:50,567
I have nothing to say to you.

1084
01:42:51,975 --> 01:42:55,047
Then this court will
retire to judgement.

1085
01:42:58,775 --> 01:43:01,335
What ails thee? Art thou mad?

1086
01:43:01,535 --> 01:43:04,049
Have we come thus far that
you would betray us now?

1087
01:43:04,255 --> 01:43:08,009
There is nothing in the Constitution
of this land that entitles us

1088
01:43:08,215 --> 01:43:11,446
to bring a king to trial. Is he
not answerable to his subjects?

1089
01:43:11,655 --> 01:43:13,168
The trial is clearly
illegal, and I will have-

1090
01:43:13,375 --> 01:43:16,253
Is not the king
answerable to his subjects?

1091
01:43:16,455 --> 01:43:19,253
The king, sir, is
answerable only to God.

1092
01:43:19,455 --> 01:43:22,015
Then, by God, when he dies, he
shall have much to answer for.

1093
01:43:22,215 --> 01:43:25,207
We have gone too far in this matter.
This commission has no authority-

1094
01:43:25,455 --> 01:43:28,094
Our authority lies
with the Parliament, sir.

1095
01:43:28,295 --> 01:43:29,853
Parliament is
the law in this land.

1096
01:43:30,055 --> 01:43:33,365
If the charges against
this king be not proven,

1097
01:43:33,575 --> 01:43:37,045
what terrible retribution may
he not bring down upon our heads?

1098
01:43:37,255 --> 01:43:38,973
In the name of God!

1099
01:43:39,175 --> 01:43:42,372
What are we all? Men?

1100
01:43:43,335 --> 01:43:48,967
Cowering and quivering
like downtrodden serfs.

1101
01:43:49,415 --> 01:43:55,763
The king is not England,
and England is not the king!

1102
01:43:58,335 --> 01:44:04,171
It is not the survival of the
king that is at issue here.

1103
01:44:04,735 --> 01:44:08,887
It is the survival of England.

1104
01:44:09,735 --> 01:44:16,083
And this king, by his
dishonesties, by his treasons,

1105
01:44:16,295 --> 01:44:19,492
and by his secret treaties
with foreign powers,

1106
01:44:19,695 --> 01:44:25,804
has shown himself to be ill-fitted
to govern this great nation!

1107
01:44:28,775 --> 01:44:33,849
As God is my witness, Oliver,
I desire not the king's death,

1108
01:44:34,055 --> 01:44:36,808
but the settlement of
this nation in peace.

1109
01:44:37,335 --> 01:44:42,853
Do you think I don't desire that?
Go back to my farm and my family?

1110
01:44:52,655 --> 01:44:56,967
Very well. Go again to this king.

1111
01:44:57,175 --> 01:44:59,735
Offer him once more our terms.

1112
01:44:59,935 --> 01:45:03,245
Though God knows, he should be
well acquainted with them by now.

1113
01:45:03,456 --> 01:45:05,845
Tell him he may sit upon his throne,

1114
01:45:06,055 --> 01:45:09,047
but that this country will
be governed by Parliament,

1115
01:45:09,255 --> 01:45:12,565
and Parliament will be
elected by the people.

1116
01:45:12,935 --> 01:45:18,373
Now, Sir Thomas, if you can
achieve this where we have failed,

1117
01:45:18,575 --> 01:45:21,373
this trial will end.

1118
01:45:36,055 --> 01:45:38,853
Here is a warrant demanding
the death of the king

1119
01:45:39,055 --> 01:45:42,047
upon the charge of high
treason against this nation.

1120
01:45:43,376 --> 01:45:48,450
It will require all your
signatures. Sir Thomas.

1121
01:45:51,456 --> 01:45:55,972
I have come thus far with you,
Oliver, in our great cause...

1122
01:45:56,175 --> 01:45:59,804
but I will not sign this warrant.

1123
01:46:21,175 --> 01:46:23,166
Oliver, I cannot. Is
he guilty or not guilty?

1124
01:46:23,375 --> 01:46:24,933
He is the king. Is he guilty?

1125
01:46:25,135 --> 01:46:27,251
Yes. Sign it.

1126
01:46:58,215 --> 01:47:02,845
Charles Stuart, king of England...

1127
01:47:03,575 --> 01:47:06,169
you have been found
guilty of high treason

1128
01:47:06,375 --> 01:47:08,684
against the good people of this nation

1129
01:47:08,895 --> 01:47:11,455
represented in Parliament,
by whose authority

1130
01:47:11,655 --> 01:47:14,567
this court does sit
in judgement upon you.

1131
01:47:14,775 --> 01:47:18,654
Upon this charge, it is
the sentence of this court

1132
01:47:18,895 --> 01:47:21,125
that you be taken hence to an...

1133
01:47:23,775 --> 01:47:26,130
appointed place

1134
01:47:27,295 --> 01:47:30,173
and put to death by the severing
of the head from the body.

1135
01:47:30,935 --> 01:47:32,971
And that is the sentence
of the whole court.

1136
01:47:35,815 --> 01:47:38,249
Remove the prisoner. MAN: Silence.

1137
01:47:39,415 --> 01:47:41,883
Will you hear me a word, sir?

1138
01:47:42,095 --> 01:47:43,972
No, sir, you are not to
be heard after sentence.

1139
01:47:44,175 --> 01:47:46,131
By your favour, sir.

1140
01:47:46,335 --> 01:47:50,294
I know as much law as any man
here. I have the right to be heard.

1141
01:47:50,575 --> 01:47:54,170
No, sir. Guard! Remove your prisoner!

1142
01:47:56,655 --> 01:48:01,410
I demand to be heard!
I am your lawful king!

1143
01:48:03,295 --> 01:48:05,570
Blood for the traitor!

1144
01:49:08,495 --> 01:49:12,852
General. Sir Thomas.

1145
01:49:17,695 --> 01:49:20,926
I have been this past
night to the commissioners.

1146
01:49:21,375 --> 01:49:23,809
They have instructed
me to lay before you

1147
01:49:24,015 --> 01:49:27,564
this warrant for 40,000 pounds

1148
01:49:27,975 --> 01:49:31,092
in return for the king's life.

1149
01:49:40,015 --> 01:49:46,090
How little you know me that you
think you can buy my principles.

1150
01:49:48,895 --> 01:49:52,444
You insult me with that cheap bribe.

1151
01:49:58,895 --> 01:50:01,204
Will you not think on it?

1152
01:50:01,415 --> 01:50:07,524
I have thought on it. And well.

1153
01:50:09,295 --> 01:50:14,494
By my God, I have thought on it.

1154
01:50:16,575 --> 01:50:20,534
"Then the soldiers of the
governor took Jesus into the common hall.

1155
01:50:20,735 --> 01:50:23,807
And they stripped him and
put on him a scarlet robe.

1156
01:50:24,055 --> 01:50:28,492
And when they had platted a crown
of thorns, they put it upon his head.

1157
01:50:28,695 --> 01:50:30,686
And they bowed the knee
before him and mocked him

1158
01:50:30,895 --> 01:50:35,491
saying, 'Hail, king of the
Jews!' And they spit-"

1159
01:50:35,695 --> 01:50:37,526
Your Majesty. Is it time?

1160
01:50:37,735 --> 01:50:42,013
No, Your Majesty. Her Royal
Highness, the Princess Elizabeth,

1161
01:50:42,255 --> 01:50:45,327
and his Royal Highness, Prince Henry.

1162
01:50:47,375 --> 01:50:49,889
Elizabeth, sweetheart.

1163
01:50:53,855 --> 01:50:57,131
Don't grieve for me. Henry.

1164
01:51:02,295 --> 01:51:05,731
Now, both of you...

1165
01:51:10,815 --> 01:51:13,568
mark what I say.

1166
01:51:19,535 --> 01:51:24,211
They will cut off thy
father's head. Shh, there now.

1167
01:51:24,415 --> 01:51:28,374
Henry, pay careful
attention to what I say.

1168
01:51:29,215 --> 01:51:31,968
You must not let them make you king,

1169
01:51:32,175 --> 01:51:35,611
not while your brother
Charles is still alive.

1170
01:51:35,815 --> 01:51:39,888
I would be torn to pieces
first. That's my son.

1171
01:51:41,375 --> 01:51:44,526
Today, your brother will be king.

1172
01:51:46,535 --> 01:51:49,174
Elizabeth, now.

1173
01:51:50,375 --> 01:51:54,004
It's a glorious death to which I go.

1174
01:51:55,775 --> 01:51:58,005
Tell your mother...

1175
01:52:01,935 --> 01:52:06,804
that my love for her
was the same to the last.

1176
01:52:08,975 --> 01:52:14,003
And remember me in your prayers.

1177
01:52:18,615 --> 01:52:21,925
The king's escort,
Your Majesty. Thank you.

1178
01:52:23,935 --> 01:52:26,813
God bless you both.

1179
01:52:44,855 --> 01:52:46,971
What kind of morning is it, colonel?

1180
01:52:47,175 --> 01:52:51,009
Indeed it is somewhat
chilly, Your Majesty.

1181
01:52:51,215 --> 01:52:54,764
Then I was wise to
put on a second shirt.

1182
01:52:55,695 --> 01:52:59,449
For if I trembled with the cold, my
enemies would say it was from fear.

1183
01:52:59,655 --> 01:53:03,933
I would not expose
myself to such a reproach.

1184
01:53:06,575 --> 01:53:11,285
Please keep them. Oh, Your Majesty.

1185
01:53:12,295 --> 01:53:15,367
I do not fear death, Sir Thomas.

1186
01:53:15,695 --> 01:53:18,892
It is not at all terrible to me.

1187
01:53:21,056 --> 01:53:24,207
I thank my God I have prepared for it.

1188
01:53:24,415 --> 01:53:27,487
Are we to ride to Westminster, or walk?

1189
01:53:27,695 --> 01:53:31,404
My orders are that
we walk, Your Majesty.

1190
01:53:31,615 --> 01:53:37,133
Admirable. The morning
air will do me good.

1191
01:53:47,135 --> 01:53:49,695
The king's coming.

1192
01:53:50,455 --> 01:53:54,687
He's coming now. The king's
coming! Hey, you. Stop him!

1193
01:53:54,935 --> 01:53:58,211
Gentlemen, the king comes.

1194
01:54:06,375 --> 01:54:08,684
Traitor! MAN 2: Execute him!

1195
01:54:12,695 --> 01:54:14,811
Execute him!

1196
01:54:19,895 --> 01:54:24,047
And a true, urgent sword in our
hand. God bless, Your Majesty.

1197
01:54:24,255 --> 01:54:26,769
God bless you.

1198
01:54:33,495 --> 01:54:36,532
Escort, halt!

1199
01:55:50,175 --> 01:55:55,488
Well, gentlemen, are you afraid to
kill your king with an open face?

1200
01:56:07,775 --> 01:56:12,212
I will not delay you long,
but will say only this to you:

1201
01:56:12,695 --> 01:56:18,406
As God is my witness, I have forgiven
those that have brought me here

1202
01:56:19,015 --> 01:56:23,486
and pray that my death be
not laid to their charge.

1203
01:56:23,695 --> 01:56:26,334
For I do endeavour, even to the last,

1204
01:56:26,535 --> 01:56:32,405
to maintain the peace of my kingdom.

1205
01:56:33,536 --> 01:56:34,810
I go now

1206
01:56:35,015 --> 01:56:41,011
from a corruptible to
an incorruptible crown.

1207
01:56:42,415 --> 01:56:45,725
To everlasting peace.

1208
01:57:09,255 --> 01:57:11,894
Will that suffice?

1209
01:57:25,255 --> 01:57:29,567
Permit me, sir, that I may pray
a while before the blow is struck.

1210
01:57:30,015 --> 01:57:33,690
Then when I put out my hands so:

1211
01:57:34,975 --> 01:57:37,648
That will be the sign.

1212
01:57:49,215 --> 01:57:52,127
Lord, let us now, thy servant,
depart in peace according to thy word.

1213
01:57:52,455 --> 01:57:55,970
For mine eyes have seen thy salvation which
thou has prepared before the face of all people.

1214
01:57:56,175 --> 01:57:58,484
Glory be to the Father and to
the Son and to the Holy Ghost.

1215
01:57:58,695 --> 01:58:01,289
As it was in the beginning
is now and ever shall be.

1216
01:58:14,175 --> 01:58:20,523
Behold the head of a traitor!

1217
01:58:48,175 --> 01:58:50,814
We did not assassinate.

1218
01:58:51,015 --> 01:58:54,405
Nor was this thing done in a corner,
it was done in the face of God

1219
01:58:54,615 --> 01:58:56,333
and of all men.

1220
01:58:56,895 --> 01:59:01,411
The office of king is now
abolished. Long live Parliament.

1221
01:59:01,615 --> 01:59:06,769
Long live the Republic. MEN:
Aye, long live the Republic.

1222
01:59:16,815 --> 01:59:20,854
Richard, I want to go back to Cambridge.

1223
01:59:21,055 --> 01:59:25,253
Will you come with me,
son? If you wish, Father.

1224
01:59:25,455 --> 01:59:29,050
It will be peace and quiet there now.

1225
01:59:29,535 --> 01:59:33,448
God knows, my soul
craves a little peace.

1226
02:00:11,975 --> 02:00:15,285
You must not think on it, Oliver.

1227
02:00:15,975 --> 02:00:21,174
'Tis over now. The war, everything.

1228
02:00:21,655 --> 02:00:24,453
'Tis over and done.

1229
02:00:31,455 --> 02:00:35,653
Oliver, you're home now.

1230
02:00:35,855 --> 02:00:39,165
There's nothing more to think on.

1231
02:00:39,815 --> 02:00:44,252
Save that we two may grow
old together in peace.

1232
02:00:51,535 --> 02:00:53,491
Peace.

1233
02:01:25,255 --> 02:01:27,291
Father.

1234
02:01:28,295 --> 02:01:32,254
Henry Ireton is at the house
with some men from Parliament.

1235
02:01:35,695 --> 02:01:38,334
I'll be along shortly.

1236
02:02:20,895 --> 02:02:22,886
Tom.

1237
02:02:24,535 --> 02:02:26,491
Arthur.

1238
02:02:28,815 --> 02:02:30,692
Henry.

1239
02:02:36,335 --> 02:02:38,371
Well, you all seem solemn enough.

1240
02:02:38,895 --> 02:02:41,170
It is a solemn business
that brings us here, Oliver.

1241
02:02:41,855 --> 02:02:45,291
Well, speak of it.

1242
02:02:47,095 --> 02:02:50,212
The country needs a head of
state, Oliver. It must be governed.

1243
02:02:50,575 --> 02:02:54,090
Is it not governed by Parliament?
There must be a figurehead.

1244
02:02:54,295 --> 02:02:58,083
It is our tradition. The
country needs a king, Oliver.

1245
02:02:58,295 --> 02:03:01,526
God knows, you've said
so many times yourself.

1246
02:03:06,575 --> 02:03:09,647
The country will be ruled by Parliament.

1247
02:03:09,855 --> 02:03:14,371
Now, in the name of Christ,
how often must I say that?

1248
02:03:14,575 --> 02:03:18,773
And who will control Parliament?
The people, the people, the people!

1249
02:03:19,015 --> 02:03:24,408
It's not practical. It won't work.
It will work and it must work.

1250
02:03:25,015 --> 02:03:28,803
We are here, on behalf of
Parliament, to offer you the Crown.

1251
02:03:34,735 --> 02:03:36,771
To offer...

1252
02:03:40,895 --> 02:03:46,094
Me, king of England?

1253
02:04:09,935 --> 02:04:14,247
King Oliver I of England.

1254
02:04:20,175 --> 02:04:24,612
Elizabeth, tell me, do
you see before you a king?

1255
02:04:24,815 --> 02:04:29,252
This tired, sickening
man, this country oaf,

1256
02:04:29,455 --> 02:04:32,447
crude in speech and manner?

1257
02:04:37,535 --> 02:04:41,244
This rough fellow,

1258
02:04:42,655 --> 02:04:46,887
does he display the bearing of a king?

1259
02:04:50,135 --> 02:04:52,285
You are the one man who
can govern this country.

1260
02:04:53,255 --> 02:04:55,450
In the name of God,

1261
02:04:55,655 --> 02:05:00,046
did we cut the head off this
king only to steal his Crown?

1262
02:05:00,255 --> 02:05:04,533
This hollow golden ring,
this worthless trinket.

1263
02:05:04,735 --> 02:05:08,205
Give it to a whore for
the price of her bed!

1264
02:05:08,415 --> 02:05:11,930
If you would find a head to fit
it, let it adorn some court jester

1265
02:05:12,135 --> 02:05:17,163
or some strolling player that
he may play your king, but not I.

1266
02:05:17,495 --> 02:05:20,567
Power must be absolute,
or it be no power at all.

1267
02:05:20,815 --> 02:05:26,208
It was not for power that we did this
thing. Have you not understood that yet?

1268
02:05:26,415 --> 02:05:29,805
Now, Ireton, mark me, and mark me well.

1269
02:05:30,015 --> 02:05:32,848
That you be hard-set upon ambitious
courses has not escaped me,

1270
02:05:33,215 --> 02:05:35,888
and if you seek to use
me towards such ends,

1271
02:05:36,095 --> 02:05:39,451
though I love you like a brother,
I swear, I will destroy you.

1272
02:05:51,295 --> 02:05:56,494
Every freeborn Englishman, be
he the lowest of the lowest,

1273
02:05:56,695 --> 02:06:00,813
is entitled to a voice in
the governing of this country.

1274
02:06:01,015 --> 02:06:04,325
But there is no vote for the
poor, for the underprivileged,

1275
02:06:04,535 --> 02:06:06,810
no vote for all those who took up arms

1276
02:06:07,015 --> 02:06:13,363
to put down the very autocracy that
this Parliament now imposes upon us.

1277
02:06:13,935 --> 02:06:17,484
You did not vote this
Parliament into office.

1278
02:06:17,695 --> 02:06:21,085
This gaggle of buffoons, these villains!

1279
02:06:21,455 --> 02:06:24,970
Much has been said in this House
about the so-called inequity

1280
02:06:25,175 --> 02:06:29,009
of certain members being financially
involved in national projects.

1281
02:06:29,215 --> 02:06:35,051
Members have ascribed to this state
of affairs dark and sinister motives.

1282
02:06:35,295 --> 02:06:39,288
I say if we in Parliament cannot
gain from ruling the country,

1283
02:06:39,495 --> 02:06:43,727
there's really very little
point in our being here at all.

1284
02:06:45,375 --> 02:06:48,765
No member of this House should
be permitted to profit from his office.

1285
02:06:48,975 --> 02:06:50,374
Hear! Hear!

1286
02:06:50,575 --> 02:06:53,089
If this House knew its duty to the
nation, it would terminate its sitting

1287
02:06:53,295 --> 02:06:55,490
and let a new Parliament be elected.

1288
02:06:55,695 --> 02:06:58,653
Order! Gentlemen,
I move that this House

1289
02:06:58,855 --> 02:07:04,612
be given power to remain in office a
further three years without re-election.

1290
02:07:09,335 --> 02:07:12,247
In my opinion, a committee of inquiry
should be set up to investigate

1291
02:07:12,455 --> 02:07:17,131
the financial involvement
of certain members.

1292
02:07:19,335 --> 02:07:21,291
Order!

1293
02:07:29,495 --> 02:07:34,649
Mr. Speaker. May I have your
permission to address this assembly?

1294
02:07:34,855 --> 02:07:36,334
By all means, sir.

1295
02:07:37,655 --> 02:07:42,445
My lords, honourable members,

1296
02:07:43,655 --> 02:07:48,171
I have always desired, above
my life, a free Parliament

1297
02:07:48,375 --> 02:07:52,812
sitting by the authority of
the good people of this nation.

1298
02:07:53,015 --> 02:07:58,408
A Parliament open and
visible, to be seen by all men.

1299
02:07:58,855 --> 02:08:04,009
It is six years since I handed over
to you this great responsibility

1300
02:08:04,255 --> 02:08:07,770
in the hope that you would
make good and wholesome laws

1301
02:08:07,975 --> 02:08:10,569
which the people of this
nation expected of you.

1302
02:08:12,175 --> 02:08:18,523
I must confess to some
abatement of my hopes

1303
02:08:18,975 --> 02:08:22,411
for what has happened in my absence.

1304
02:08:23,695 --> 02:08:29,167
Instead of uniting the
good people of this nation

1305
02:08:29,375 --> 02:08:32,048
with righteousness and peace,

1306
02:08:32,255 --> 02:08:36,487
which would have been a glorious
and Christian thing to have done,

1307
02:08:36,695 --> 02:08:39,163
what do I find?

1308
02:08:41,695 --> 02:08:46,132
Anarchy, corruption,

1309
02:08:46,335 --> 02:08:51,284
division and dissatisfaction.

1310
02:08:54,055 --> 02:08:56,933
I say that the enemies of this nation

1311
02:08:57,135 --> 02:09:01,447
have flourished under your protection.

1312
02:09:02,255 --> 02:09:05,452
You were from the beginning
a provisional government

1313
02:09:05,655 --> 02:09:08,089
not truly representative of the people.

1314
02:09:08,295 --> 02:09:10,650
For have the people elected you?

1315
02:09:10,855 --> 02:09:15,326
Has this House gone once to the
people it purports to represent?

1316
02:09:15,535 --> 02:09:21,167
No, it has not! And after six years
of misgovernment, what do we find?

1317
02:09:21,375 --> 02:09:25,527
Sir Thomas Fairfax moves a bill
to give this House a further lease

1318
02:09:25,735 --> 02:09:30,126
of its worthless and dishonourable life!

1319
02:09:30,495 --> 02:09:35,011
Gentlemen, an immovable
Parliament is more obnoxious

1320
02:09:35,215 --> 02:09:38,207
than an immovable king!

1321
02:09:40,175 --> 02:09:45,852
You are drunkards, tricksters,
villains, whoremasters,

1322
02:09:46,055 --> 02:09:49,684
godless, self-seeking,
ambitious tricksters.

1323
02:09:49,895 --> 02:09:53,046
You are no more capable of
conducting the affairs of this nation

1324
02:09:53,255 --> 02:09:55,007
than you are of running a brothel!

1325
02:09:56,495 --> 02:10:00,693
You are scum, sir, and not
truly elected scum at that.

1326
02:10:01,175 --> 02:10:03,689
This is no Parliament. I shall
put an end to your sitting.

1327
02:10:03,895 --> 02:10:06,967
I hereby declare this
Parliament dissolved!

1328
02:10:07,175 --> 02:10:10,531
Colonel Harrison! Yes,
sir. Troops forward!

1329
02:10:11,375 --> 02:10:13,093
Rubbish.

1330
02:10:21,495 --> 02:10:25,283
Remove them! Come on, get them out.

1331
02:10:29,735 --> 02:10:32,807
This is dictatorship, sir! Dictatorship!

1332
02:10:33,015 --> 02:10:36,087
Dictator! Dictatorship!

1333
02:10:36,455 --> 02:10:38,127
This is illegal! Come, sir.

1334
02:10:38,335 --> 02:10:41,771
I refuse to quit this
chair. By your leave, sir.

1335
02:10:46,735 --> 02:10:50,648
Away with this bauble!

1336
02:10:58,815 --> 02:11:03,411
I seem to recall that
we cut off a king's head

1337
02:11:03,615 --> 02:11:06,049
for such as this.

1338
02:11:08,215 --> 02:11:13,209
You are a traitor, sir. It is the likes
of you who have turned my hand to this.

1339
02:11:14,215 --> 02:11:17,764
I have sought the Lord's guidance
night and day in this matter.

1340
02:11:17,975 --> 02:11:22,127
It is not idly done, for this
nation will be justly governed.

1341
02:11:38,295 --> 02:11:43,085
I will give this nation
back its self-respect.

1342
02:11:43,295 --> 02:11:47,811
We will walk in this world
with our heads held high.

1343
02:11:48,015 --> 02:11:52,327
I will liberate man's souls
from the darkness of ignorance.

1344
02:11:52,535 --> 02:11:56,084
I will build schools
and universities for all.

1345
02:11:56,295 --> 02:12:00,208
This will become the
golden age of learning.

1346
02:12:00,415 --> 02:12:04,454
I will bring the law within
the reach of every common man.

1347
02:12:04,655 --> 02:12:07,852
There'll be work and bread for all.

1348
02:12:08,055 --> 02:12:13,083
This nation will prosper
because it is a godly nation

1349
02:12:13,255 --> 02:12:18,375
and because we walk hand
in hand with the Lord.

1350
02:12:31,855 --> 02:12:34,494
I swear by the name of the living God

1351
02:12:34,695 --> 02:12:37,528
that I will see this nation

1352
02:12:37,735 --> 02:12:39,851
properly governed

1353
02:12:40,215 --> 02:12:43,525
if I have to do it myself.

1354
02:12:49,895 --> 02:12:54,173
Dear God, give me the
strength to do it...

1355
02:12:54,735 --> 02:12:57,010
alone.

1356
02:13:03,375 --> 02:13:07,573
<i>Oliver Cromwell ruled the
nation as lord protector for five years.</i>

1357
02:13:07,775 --> 02:13:10,528
<i>In that short time, he raised
England to be a great power,</i>

1358
02:13:10,735 --> 02:13:13,203
<i>feared and respected
throughout the world.</i>

1359
02:13:13,415 --> 02:13:15,770
<i>Under his hand were laid the foundations</i>

1360
02:13:15,935 --> 02:13:17,687
<i>of a truly democratic nation.</i>

1361
02:13:17,895 --> 02:13:20,204
<i>In 1658, he died.</i>

1362
02:13:20,415 --> 02:13:24,533
<i>Three years later, Charles,
prince of Wales, was crowned king</i>

1363
02:13:24,735 --> 02:13:27,772
<i>and a monarch sat once more
upon the throne of England.</i>

1364
02:13:27,975 --> 02:13:30,443
<i>But an England never
to be the same again.</i>
