1
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,711
I have left  many Ages ...

2
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,289
as salmon,

3
00:01:17,324 --> 00:01:19,171
deer,

4
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:21,598
and wolf.

5
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:29,450
I have seen the dark man invading Ireland
destroying homes, In search gold.

6
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,634
I saw the Samurai in the dark.

7
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:54,885
yet ... I have seen the beauty
emerge from the most fragile.

8
00:01:57,559 --> 00:02:03,559
I have seen the book ... the book
turn darkness into light.

9
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,625
<i> The Secret of Kells </ i>


10
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:26,000
Brendan? Do not let it get away!

11
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,640
Come here! gosling, gosling, gosling ...

12
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:45,366
Become back, I'm gonna get!

13
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,646
Where was it?

14
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,016
Brendan! The scaffold is not safe!

15
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:20,073
Do not worry, brother Assou, I will be careful.

16
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,946
Sorry.

17
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,872
Brendan!

18
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:42,797
Coming!

19
00:03:51,224 --> 00:03:52,226
Brendan!

20
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:54,426
Are you hurt?

21
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,522
Mantel quiet, Brendan!
We are in an abbey.

22
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:36,148
Sorry, but we have to do this.
End in a minute.

23
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:41,943
That was not so difficult, is it?

24
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:44,765
Aver lucky.

25
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Your feathers will become the tools
create pages with that immortal
sacred texts.

26
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:08,436
Father! Let me explain ...

27
00:05:08,437 --> 00:05:12,413
We tried to catch this
goose ... but he ran too fast.

28
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,355
And I fell in the mud ...

29
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:17,814
Forgive us, father.

30
00:05:17,823 --> 00:05:20,335
Brendan! Where are the
plans, I asked?

31
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:24,150
The plans ... I left them in the
Hall writes.

32
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:26,563
- Bring them to the castle!
- Yeah, man.

33
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:31,753
Tomorrow, going to work on the wall.
From sunrise to sunset.

34
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:33,924
Brother Leonardo ...

35
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:37,740
... wipe, for God's sake.

36
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:49,158
I do not know why it bothers you so much
when all he wants is to build that wall.

37
00:05:49,193 --> 00:05:54,373
Yes, it's the only concern
yet you keep defending, Brendan!

38
00:05:54,374 --> 00:05:57,159
The guy just wants to protect us from outside.

39
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,296
The Vikings will not make a distinction
between young and old. So ...

40
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:04,492
Preparenme me too!

41
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,215
You do not understand ...

42
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:15,132
But Brendan, they have never been outside these walls.

43
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,693
However, I know how dangerous it is.

44
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:22,923
- Where were they?
- Bringing it to you.

45
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:25,762
You must be his brother Sergio,

46
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:28,718
its wings outstretched,
as a beautiful swan.

47
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:30,991
This is not funny.

48
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:35,419
The father saw us very angry.
Why do not we work on the wall.

49
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:40,453
Enough of that! And the book
What are not valuable?

50
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:45,453
Without any knowledge books
will be lost ... forever.

51
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,469
You can not build walls forever!

52
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:50,617
People who need books,
which expect to get.

53
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:53,776
A master illuminator
would be necessary.

54
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,900
Pray that
God will bring us!

55
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:58,048
Yes! Pray!

56
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:02,405
But I need a teacher
your work is so perfect ...

57
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,738
Thanks Brendan, but
we are merely scribes

58
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:09,463
- Close to a true master.
- A teacher? One as ...

59
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:13,716
Brother Aidan from Iona.

60
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:15,733
Aidan is the largest.

61
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,716
Who is the brother Aidan?

62
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:19,022
A sage.

63
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:21,129
The wisest of all.

64
00:07:21,164 --> 00:07:23,201
Illuminator perfect.

65
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:24,279
And where is it?

66
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:27,052
He lives in the small island of Iona.

67
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:33,917
There is an abbey on the island, where he works
in a wonderful book: The book of Iona.

68
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:41,184
The book 200 years ago, began to be written
 of the Orders of Columbanus.

69
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:47,574
Iona's book to epclipsa
all others.

70
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:49,870
For the miraculous third eye
Columbanus

71
00:07:49,905 --> 00:07:55,381
Not for the third eye, but by their
three hand with 12 fingers each.

72
00:07:55,484 --> 00:07:58,347
Not true! There were three eyes
not three hands!

73
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:00,624
Never heard of the third eye
Columbanus

74
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:04,179
Yes, yes, but the third eye was
to make prophecies

75
00:08:04,214 --> 00:08:07,699
while the third hand
was to write the book.

76
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,960
Enough! Just tell us about
Brother Aidan.

77
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:16,220
Light of his writings out of the pages.

78
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,310
Evil beings have been blinded
with only perch on them.

79
00:08:20,345 --> 00:08:23,499
These pages were conceived
in the same sky.

80
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:25,610
The Book of Iona.

81
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,445
But where is Iona?

82
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,786
Far away at sea, too far away. Each
island should be.

83
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:35,196
A beautiful place

84
00:08:35,197 --> 00:08:39,092
where the illuminators
should not build a wall.

85
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:45,092
But the father said that the
islands are easier to attack.

86
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:59,299
Brendan! Are you still here?

87
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,611
Bring plans to Abbot,
or you'll be in trouble!

88
00:09:02,612 --> 00:09:03,612
Uncle!

89
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:05,217
Hurry up, boy!

90
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:15,476
I came, man.

91
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:21,437
Brendan! How can I trust you
if you still disappointed?

92
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,712
One day you run the monastery.

93
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:28,734
But it takes you hours to complete
a simple task.

94
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:29,997
Sorry.

95
00:09:30,032 --> 00:09:35,370
The monks told me about Iona.
I had a dream that was destroyed.

96
00:09:35,405 --> 00:09:37,620
Ta was real, man!

97
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:40,658
Brendan is real.

98
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:45,180
One day, look at us.

99
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,710
So we must be prepared.

100
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:11,368
This section is supported by
three pillars: here, here and here.

101
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,075
Man, someone has arrived!

102
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,717
It has a white cat with him!

103
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:19,213
No doubt, another victim of the Vikings.

104
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:21,073
Let's see.

105
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:34,496
<i> Why? Beyond Africa </ i>

106
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:39,799
No, no, no ... not so far.
But due to the expiration of the foot.

107
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,528
But from where How far?

108
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:47,261
No, but if you live only once

109
00:10:47,262 --> 00:10:49,563
the road seems half as long.

110
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,045
Not true Pangur Ban?

111
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:57,689
Welcome to Kells, brother.

112
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,242
- Abad Cellach
- Peace be with you!

113
00:10:59,277 --> 00:11:04,410
Brothers and sisters, give welcome
one of the greatest illuminators of our time.

114
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:06,572
You're sure there must be a mistake.

115
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:08,699
Brother Aidan of Iona.

116
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:15,732
One question at a time.

117
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:21,767
As St. Columba, "The questions will not burn
your tongue if you wait for them "

118
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,406
Welcome to Keller, brother Aidan!

119
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:27,300
Over here, brother.

120
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,755
Hello! Welcome to Kells!

121
00:11:37,286 --> 00:11:38,800
Hey, wait!

122
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:45,761
<i> just talking about you and the code. </ I>

123
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,039
Good spacious room!

124
00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:55,679
Fresh air, bright light
through the windows ...

125
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,091
Brother!

126
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,961
Is that where you save the workbook?

127
00:12:02,574 --> 00:12:06,684
Here ... that ... a. ..

128
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,016
And you see they have younger siblings?

129
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,799
Although short stature never falls short
Question.

130
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,996
Why do you care about the Book?

131
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:24,127
Well ... brothers, said they
St. Columba who began ...

132
00:12:24,162 --> 00:12:29,630
Brothers and sisters, the brother of Aidan
must take part

133
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:35,099
strengthening work Kells.
They have work to do.

134
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,167
Plans are in my office.

135
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:40,462
- I thought, I could stay here
and ... - Over here, brother.

136
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:45,229
Boy! Search for something to eat ...

137
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,873
You know, I plan to finish the job
within two years.

138
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:52,482
So you're Pangur
Ban. My name is Bre ...

139
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:55,572
Hey! Wait! I'm supposed to feed you

140
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,960
Wait!

141
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,628
Pangur Ban!

142
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:05,170
Pangur Ban!

143
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,593
You should not have come here.
The Vikings will follow.

144
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:10,937
"I would have stayed to die?

145
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:15,030
I ran away from the Vikings and left far behind.
brother Cellach



146
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:18,226
I mean ... Father Cellach.

147
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:21,574
The book is savlo, and can be completed.

148
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,385
Yes, well ... we have more pressure to complete
other things here.

149
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,518
- You mean your wall?
- Not my wall!

150
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:33,617
A wall to save civilization.

151
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:35,812
A wall to save your book!

152
00:13:37,646 --> 00:13:38,791
Heathens ...

153
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,780
Worshipers of Crom ...

154
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,800
The strength of the village
shows how strong our faith.

155
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,698
I've always drawn well, Cellach.

156
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:56,767
Yes, sorry, but
I have many things to attend to.

157
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:01,360
There is no wall that can
stop the Vikings.

158
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:03,932
When they come here, we can only run

159
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:07,361
and hope that
are fast enough.

160
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,039
Come Pangur.

161
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,900
Pangur!

162
00:14:51,906 --> 00:14:54,164
I did not want to hurt the work.

163
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:57,223
I've never been on the outside wall.

164
00:14:57,258 --> 00:15:00,106
I wanted to see
at least one page.

165
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,315
Please.

166
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,449
Good!

167
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:12,322
Is not it the little brother
the big questions?

168
00:15:12,357 --> 00:15:14,558
- I did not want ...
- I understand.

169
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:20,593
You tired of spying on the conversation of the father
and decided to come here.

170
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,683
No, no, that's it!

171
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:25,594
Quiet boy, do not tell anyone.

172
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,509
Maybe not ...

173
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,299
The brothers said that sinners are
remain blind to look at the book.

174
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,745
So maybe I should not

175
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,659
Do you really think
of that happening?

176
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,299
Life is full of doubts, do not you boy?

177
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,880
This is your decision.

178
00:15:53,795 --> 00:15:57,855
It does not cover the real treasure. Open up!

179
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,503
The work of angels.

180
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:10,987
"The work of the angels"
Did you hear that? Pangur

181
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,813
I did not know that angels painted
as funny as me.

182
00:16:14,814 --> 00:16:17,964
Maybe it's the boy has gone blind.

183
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,630
I also thought the same,
when I first saw it.

184
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:27,317
However, it is the work of
Mere mortals like you and me.

185
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:31,488
The book is light in these dark times.

186
00:16:31,988 --> 00:16:34,881
Would you like to see the most beautiful pages?

187
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:39,681
Where darkness becomes light.

188
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,991
This is the website "Chi Ro".

189
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:51,765
But not even have anything!

190
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,129
No, but it is the most glorious page
the entire book.

191
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,765
Brendan, would you like help?

192
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,058
Yes, please! I help brothers
all the time.

193
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:04,256
Calm down, brother.

194
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:09,796
First, you bring me some of this,
of a very old tree.

195
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:11,198
But what is that?

196
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:16,630
It's a little soft, but makes the ink
darker emerald green you've ever seen.

197
00:17:16,631 --> 00:17:22,631
If I get a dozen in the woods
I'll show you how to make it, come on!

198
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,334
What?

199
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:32,063
I can not go beyond the wall.

200
00:17:32,463 --> 00:17:34,505
It's too dangerous.

201
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:37,473
It's dangerous.

202
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,367
Iona

203
00:17:40,402 --> 00:17:44,488
I lost my brothers
by the invaders.

204
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:48,161
Now only is the book to remember.

205
00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:54,162
But if they were here now
I would say that you can learn more in the forest

206
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,095
with trees and stones
that on any other place.

207
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,715
You can see miracles.

208
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,586
That was a long time ago, the father knew.

209
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,799
I've never seen anything like it, Pangur.

210
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,643
I would love
help his brother, Aidan.

211
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:26,084
I think I can get
berries alone.

212
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:30,525
I enter the woods.
Brother Aidan will be surprised ...

213
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:32,405
But the father ...

214
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,495
I'll be back before noticing.

215
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,020
But .. What if I get lost ...

216
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:39,223
... in the dark?

217
00:18:39,224 --> 00:18:42,662
No! I can not leave!

218
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,450
But if I keep thinking
in the book

219
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:53,137
Do not be afraid to darkness.

220
00:18:53,138 --> 00:18:56,226
On the contrary, can not wait
to go.

221
00:18:56,261 --> 00:19:01,419
Well, Pangur Ban.
Tomorrow go into the woods!

222
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:20,963
Pangur!

223
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:46,287
It would be easier if he knew as
is an oak.

224
00:21:03,427 --> 00:21:07,052
It might be better to go home ...

225
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,312
Was it here? Do not you remember?

226
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:20,816
Do not worry, Pangur. We only have
get back before it gets dark earlier.

227
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:35,894
Is not that enough? ...

228
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:37,699
Is this your cat?

229
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,725
Well?

230
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,521
I heard of creatures like you

231
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:50,760
You're a fairy, right?

232
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:57,567
What are you doing in my forest?
They have come to ruin it right?.

233
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Are you orguilloso because your family sends
for food? right?

234
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:07,720
Well, you can go where you came.

235
00:23:07,755 --> 00:23:11,291
If not, the wolves will catch you!

236
00:23:11,326 --> 00:23:12,291
No!

237
00:23:14,016 --> 00:23:17,639
I did not want ... Hey, sorry.

238
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,050
I'm not here to put food
my family. I am here for ink.

239
00:23:21,085 --> 00:23:24,442
There is no family, and there
enough food in Kells.

240
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:27,799
I only lost in the shuffle.

241
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:30,089
Do not have a family?

242
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,184
None.

243
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:34,219
No mother?

244
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:39,600
I'm single too.

245
00:23:41,556 --> 00:23:44,605
If this is your forest, no doubt
know everything about him.

246
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,745
Well, of course.

247
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,039
Wait!

248
00:23:47,074 --> 00:23:48,298
Hello!

249
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,084
Not so hard! Go!

250
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,542
Hold on! Please! Do you know where
you can find this?

251
00:23:56,543 --> 00:23:58,220
Yes

252
00:23:58,255 --> 00:23:59,840
But you can not eat.

253
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:03,980
I do not want to eat, are for ink.

254
00:24:06,286 --> 00:24:08,291
What is that?

255
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:10,953
It is for the book ...

256
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:12,243
To make drawings.

257
00:24:12,515 --> 00:24:15,938
Color liquid that is put on paper.

258
00:24:15,973 --> 00:24:20,060
As the leaves ... hard to explain,
I guess you'd have to see it.

259
00:24:20,095 --> 00:24:24,147
I do not know what you're talking about,
but I do not know ...

260
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:25,468
But the brother Aidan ...

261
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:29,430
I'll help, on one condition ...

262
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:36,109
You have to promise that you and your
pet will never return here.

263
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,179
Okay. I promise.

264
00:24:44,214 --> 00:24:47,934
Come then, to forests.

265
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:51,270
What ...?

266
00:24:51,305 --> 00:24:53,045
Hey, wait!

267
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,425
My name is Brendan. What is yours?

268
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,899
It's a miracle, as Aidan said.

269
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,100
Aidan is my friend.

270
00:25:11,101 --> 00:25:15,526
Assists in the preparation of
world's most beautiful book.

271
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:20,719
Change of darkness into light You'll see!

272
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,115
You wait until you see
the rest of the woods!

273
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,081
Wow, you're quick.

274
00:25:39,116 --> 00:25:42,456
Yes, I'm the fastest.

275
00:25:42,695 --> 00:25:43,695
So ...

276
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:46,294
Where are the berries?

277
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,339
They climbed a tree, right?

278
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,326
Yes, of course. Easy.

279
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:01,103
So come on!

280
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,926
Second time in the day I saved your life.

281
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:37,049
You said you could climb trees.

282
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,263
I know. Only small.

283
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,693
Of course ... shrubs.

284
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:45,207
Do not look down. Come on!

285
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,905
Look!

286
00:26:56,724 --> 00:26:59,729
Insects recognize each other.

287
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:27,665
Come on!

288
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,165
If you open your eyes
I'll tell you my name.

289
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,946
Aisling.

290
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:43,370
This is my forest.

291
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:56,674
I asked them to not bite you.

292
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,904
This is what you want ...

293
00:27:58,905 --> 00:28:02,055
... parachute but not all berries.

294
00:28:02,225 --> 00:28:04,298
Rather, as a waste of wild boar.

295
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,207
And it smells bad too.

296
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,081
If you've done?, It's time to lose.

297
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,282
Download ...

298
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,999
A little to the left.

299
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,999
Do not wait! Do not go to the ...

300
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,286
... branch.

301
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:28,629
I regret that it took so long to download.

302
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,438
With the exception of the last stage ...

303
00:28:30,473 --> 00:28:34,599
You better go. I know a secret way
to get home
304
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,761
Come on!

305
00:28:43,808 --> 00:28:45,430
Look!

306
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:49,100
Brendan?

307
00:29:04,856 --> 00:29:07,386
What are you doing? Come on!

308
00:29:09,418 --> 00:29:11,663
This is the place of suffering.

309
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:14,389
Suffering? What do you mean?

310
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:17,899
Just stay away! It's too dangerous.

311
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:21,132
It can be dangerous
like climbing an oak.

312
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:24,000
This is the cave of darkness.

313
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:25,478
Crom Cruach cave?

314
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,713
But it's just a story for children.

315
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:32,813
The Abbot of Kells, says you should not
fear of imaginary things.

316
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:35,183
This is not imaginary.

317
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:40,779
He's waiting in the dark.

318
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,686
Aisling, you only scare yourself.

319
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:46,344
The father said that this
only a pagan.

320
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:48,874
Crom Cruach there.

321
00:29:53,013 --> 00:29:55,305
Prnuncies not that name!

322
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,598
Do you really have fear?

323
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,071
Aisling!

324
00:30:18,228 --> 00:30:19,658
Are you hurt?

325
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:24,718
What was that?

326
00:30:24,753 --> 00:30:26,346
I told you ...

327
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:27,443
Crom!

328
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,965
- Brendan?
- Huh?

329
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,828
You can visit the forest again, if you wish.

330
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,557
Pangur can come too.

331
00:30:54,906 --> 00:30:58,315
- Iona But we always do ...
- This is not Iona.

332
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:01,284
The room will be arranged according to scripture
my instructions.

333
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,389
But this is not good ...

334
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,730
It will be as I said.

335
00:31:07,373 --> 00:31:10,138
Brother Aidan! I found them!

336
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,841
Brendan. It was time.

337
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,895
Where were you?

338
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,975
I'm listening. Where were you?

339
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,238
Yes ..

340
00:31:33,273 --> 00:31:34,861
I went to the woods.

341
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:38,431
But only for a while, not much.

342
00:31:39,213 --> 00:31:40,315
It was by Brother Aidan ...

343
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:45,270
Brendan. Have I not warned enough
about what lies beyond these walls?

344
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:46,363
Do not listen.

345
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:47,386
I know, but the book ...

346
00:31:47,421 --> 00:31:52,464
Brendan. You can not leave
the monastery without permission.

347
00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:53,801
But, man, you should have seen the book ...

348
00:31:53,836 --> 00:31:55,822
Understand?

349
00:31:55,857 --> 00:31:57,809
Yes, uncle.

350
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,226
That's good.

351
00:31:59,525 --> 00:32:04,580
Now come with me, there are things to fix in the room.

352
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,091
- Look!
- What, what happened?
- I found them.

353
00:32:50,126 --> 00:32:53,028
Really. You found.

354
00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:54,938
I did it with a little help.

355
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:57,274
A friend of forests.

356
00:32:58,731 --> 00:33:02,004
There is nothing you can do
with friends at your side, right?

357
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:03,565
Let's see.

358
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,574
Yes, yes ... seems
This corresponds very well ...

359
00:33:07,609 --> 00:33:11,548
Small berries to large images.

360
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:12,549
Come on!

361
00:33:39,422 --> 00:33:42,162
It is a lot of smoke ... a good sign.

362
00:33:42,197 --> 00:33:44,185
- Yes?
- Sure.

363
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,335
- It's beautiful.
- From a soft foul.

364
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:52,370
Make ink is fine, but it's useless ...

365
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:54,351
... without any of this.

366
00:33:54,386 --> 00:33:55,651
I am not allowed to do that.

367
00:33:55,686 --> 00:33:58,400
Nobody here but us.

368
00:33:58,401 --> 00:34:00,451
Only you

369
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:02,280
and ta imagination.

370
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,286
Are you afraid?

371
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:12,996
Me? No. I'm not afraid of
imaginary things.

372
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:20,985
Go! Finish what you started.

373
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,600
Gold!

374
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,265
Not bad.

375
00:35:32,022 --> 00:35:34,499
I could say that you are doing
well enough.

376
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,766
What?

377
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,719
I must confess something, my son.

378
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,249
I have not been honest with you tally.

379
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:46,066
I can not draw the Chi-ro page.

380
00:35:46,101 --> 00:35:49,882
My eyes are old.
My hands are trembling.

381
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:51,403
But .. said ...

382
00:35:51,438 --> 00:35:53,833
You must be the one who does that page!

383
00:35:53,868 --> 00:35:55,814
Me? No! I'm just a ...

384
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,726
Must be someone else

385
00:35:57,761 --> 00:36:00,699
You should.
I would ruin it.

386
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,699
No, no, no. You can do it.

387
00:36:02,734 --> 00:36:04,699
You found the berries

388
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,757
Your hands are firm.

389
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,990
Before I arrived they had already learned a lot
the work of the other brothers.

390
00:36:12,025 --> 00:36:14,257
Only your imagination loose.

391
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:15,547
I gotta go.

392
00:36:24,107 --> 00:36:26,299
Where have you been so early?

393
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,880
Come on, there is much work to do.

394
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:34,261
Pangur do not know ...

395
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,786
I can not see something stops him.

396
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,775
If ever he illumination in the Chi-ro

397
00:36:46,168 --> 00:36:52,168
will face whatever it takes.

398
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
Brendan!

399
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:18,640
So we are moving the scaffolding
the west wall. Hurry!

400
00:38:28,929 --> 00:38:33,984
I think it's time to discover the secret of Columban.

401
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,249
The fascinating details ...

402
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,757
Of course, you need another eye.

403
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:40,063
Well ...

404
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:44,557
- Once I found a crystal.
- Brother ...

405
00:38:44,592 --> 00:38:47,418
Small miracles are brand new


406
00:38:47,453 --> 00:38:53,453
Columbano, said crystal is not
should never be used.

407
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,396
Nobody has used.

408
00:38:55,431 --> 00:38:57,218
What is a ... glass?

409
00:38:57,253 --> 00:39:01,263
This is not a crystal, glass.

410
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,853
Colombano eyes.

411
00:39:04,317 --> 00:39:08,801
Columbano, wrote over 300 books in his life.

412
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:10,282
With your hands!

413
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,824
The deathbed, prayed
so clear that the wizard

414
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:16,699
had wonderful visions
to be like him.

415
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,610
And as your last breath ...

416
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,776
dropped from his hand ...

417
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,827
... Colombia's eyes!

418
00:39:24,136 --> 00:39:28,269
Colombano want it to be yours.

419
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,271
Where is it?

420
00:39:29,272 --> 00:39:30,549
Forgive me, Pangur.

421
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,080
Have not you seen?

422
00:39:34,882 --> 00:39:35,975
Is lost.

423
00:39:36,953 --> 00:39:38,569
Lost!

424
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,895
When was the last time you saw her?

425
00:39:53,031 --> 00:39:54,700
I do not understand.

426
00:39:54,735 --> 00:39:57,699
If I could show the crystal
everything will be cleared.

427
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,035
... all understand.

428
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,137
- But ...
- But I can still continue training, can I?

429
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:07,121
Have you ever studied the small employer
of the wings of a fly?

430
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:11,299
- No.
- And you never will without the glass

431
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,870
How about if we pray for a miracle?

432
00:40:13,905 --> 00:40:15,821
As Colombano made

433
00:40:15,822 --> 00:40:21,747
Some people say that before the glass
was known as the eye of Columbanus

434
00:40:21,748 --> 00:40:23,399
had an ancient name.

435
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:29,400
A name like the creature from which
Colombano was awarded the crystal.
Deep inside your home.

436
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,155
Cruach Crom!

437
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,530
It was called the eye of "Crom Cruach"

438
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,876
Do not know which part of the story
is true and what part ...

439
00:40:39,877 --> 00:40:41,547
... is covered by darkness.

440
00:40:43,973 --> 00:40:46,743
Ah, life is full of darkness ...

441
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:51,619
And only a short time
while we're on this earth.

442
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,599
Do not worry, Pangur.

443
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,605
I will not be alone.

444
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,926
Rohibido you leave the abbey.

445
00:41:29,961 --> 00:41:32,772
Now you have forbidden to enter the
room scriptures.

446
00:41:32,807 --> 00:41:34,600
Please, Uncle, do not understand.

447
00:41:34,635 --> 00:41:37,349
I understand perfectly!

448
00:41:37,384 --> 00:41:39,057
No more trips.

449
00:41:39,092 --> 00:41:42,996
No more room and no more scripts brother Aidan.

450
00:41:43,496 --> 00:41:44,994
No.

451
00:41:47,431 --> 00:41:49,057
What?

452
00:41:49,457 --> 00:41:51,051
I can not do that.

453
00:41:51,655 --> 00:41:53,957
I can not give in to the book.

454
00:41:53,992 --> 00:41:56,295
If you see only one page
understand why.

455
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,599
Have you forgotten how important it is?

456
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,722
Only cares about the wall.

457
00:42:00,757 --> 00:42:03,777
Aidan's brother told me you
Lit once was.

458
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:07,212
- He said ...
- Stop!

459
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:15,600
If I can not trust you
'll stay here until they regained consciousness.

460
00:42:32,332 --> 00:42:36,353
Cellach, do not blame
the boy. I'll talk to him ...

461
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:39,048
- You will not.
- You can ...

462
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:43,989
Tang's brother brought him food once
there is nothing here to distract ...

463
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:46,751
Let me save the workbook

464
00:42:46,752 --> 00:42:48,360
I have been entrusted to me.

465
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,951
Okay.

466
00:42:52,326 --> 00:42:58,326
On one condition: You will leave with the first Kelles
outbreak of spring.

467
00:43:45,712 --> 00:43:48,198
Brendan <i> </ i>

468
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:54,675
Aisling!

469
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,178
How can I get you?

470
00:44:03,213 --> 00:44:04,400
Do not know.

471
00:44:05,403 --> 00:44:07,223
The tower is closed.

472
00:44:07,258 --> 00:44:10,287
And my door is locked from outside.

473
00:44:10,288 --> 00:44:13,583
The key is in the room of the abbot.

474
00:44:14,259 --> 00:44:19,264
Maybe ... can carry a message
brother Aidan.

475
00:44:42,861 --> 00:44:48,861
You have to go where I can not go ...

476
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,831
Pangur in ...

477
00:46:15,447 --> 00:46:17,544
Why the father has locked you in there?

478
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:19,641
Because I was naughty.

479
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:20,641
Why?

480
00:46:21,249 --> 00:46:22,889
Look!

481
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:26,565
- The Eye of Crom!
- No, this is a crystal.

482
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,020
I think he's in the dark cave.

483
00:46:29,055 --> 00:46:30,740
I have to go.

484
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:36,339
No Brendan, you are cheating.
You were safe in the tower.

485
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:40,393
Crom Cruach take my people, my mother took.

486
00:46:40,428 --> 00:46:44,178
Take everything. Going to die!

487
00:46:44,213 --> 00:46:50,213
Aisling, if not try the book
will never be completed.

488
00:46:55,311 --> 00:46:57,369
The book ...

489
00:46:58,643 --> 00:47:01,600
Well, I'll help.

490
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:35,266
Aisling! This place is hurting you,
you must go back.

491
00:47:35,301 --> 00:47:37,260
Find another way.

492
00:47:37,295 --> 00:47:40,833
I need help ...

493
00:47:50,931 --> 00:47:53,360
Now retgresa please!

494
00:47:53,395 --> 00:47:57,160
Turn the darkness into light.

495
00:50:28,246 --> 00:50:29,246
Aisling!

496
00:50:32,107 --> 00:50:34,040
Aisling!

497
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,484
Fool!

498
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,423
The old fool had to maintain
mouth shut ...

499
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:03,698
But the young fool would listen ...

500
00:51:03,733 --> 00:51:06,939
There you are! How ... How ...?

501
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:09,145
How did you leave the tower?

502
00:51:09,146 --> 00:51:11,633
You must come back before the father finds out.

503
00:51:11,634 --> 00:51:15,938
This is no place for you,
there is nothing for you here.

504
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:18,574
But you're here, the book is here ...

505
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:21,101
and here is the eye.

506
00:51:31,135 --> 00:51:34,640
How is this possible?!

507
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:37,228
There are more than a story about the eye.

508
00:51:37,263 --> 00:51:40,072
More than a dwelling for the dead ...

509
00:51:40,107 --> 00:51:42,881
and over one eye.

510
00:51:43,978 --> 00:51:47,531
Did you go to dark cave?

511
00:51:47,566 --> 00:51:51,085
You can not learn everything from books.

512
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,299
I think I read that somewhere ...

513
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:57,546
Well ... is time to start.

514
00:52:27,642 --> 00:52:29,650
His breakfast, father.

515
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,460
Take it to Brendan.

516
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,999
See if ...

517
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,295
See if you are gaining a better understanding.

518
00:55:09,951 --> 00:55:12,585
It's like heaven.

519
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:15,220
Heaven on Earth.

520
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,460
Please ... was my fault, father.

521
00:55:21,762 --> 00:55:22,999
Little fool.

522
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,340
The Vikings are upon us
and you ... drawing

523
00:55:29,736 --> 00:55:32,265
We have a day before the Vikings
Vikings attack Kells

524
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,760
- We stand at the door.
- We must flee!

525
00:55:34,795 --> 00:55:38,255
Aguantaremos
Will guide the refugees to the chapel.

526
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:41,656
We must prepare ourselves for when the attackers
move.

527
00:55:41,691 --> 00:55:45,022
Tang! Tell people
stay at home.

528
00:55:45,023 --> 00:55:46,692
Cellach!

529
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:53,310
You'll be safe here with your beautiful book.

530
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,567
No, not yet!

531
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,922
Stay inside!

532
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,958
Tang! Open the door!

533
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:49,956
The tower!

534
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:05,230
One at a time!
The staircase is not strong enough!.

535
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,284
Tango, there are many!

536
00:58:11,098 --> 00:58:13,150
Too late.

537
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:26,348
Close the door!

538
00:58:31,835 --> 00:58:33,586
Brendan!

539
00:59:15,345 --> 00:59:17,565
Ink! we have to ink!

540
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,175
- Brendan! you can not ...
- Fast!

541
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,599
Uncle!

542
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,371
No!

543
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,600
No! We must save him!

544
00:59:53,635 --> 00:59:56,600
Brendan, where is the
secret passage into the woods?

545
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,217
We must save him!

546
00:59:58,252 --> 01:00:01,067
I can not help it.

547
01:00:04,776 --> 01:00:07,112
Brendan!

548
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,510
We can not stop.

549
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,607
I have to go back.

550
01:00:54,642 --> 01:00:59,299
The Vikings did not let anyone in Iona
not let anyone in Kells

551
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:02,324
- He is my uncle.
- He did it to protect you.

552
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:05,348
The only way I could ...

553
01:01:05,383 --> 01:01:08,337
Now I have to protect

554
01:01:08,372 --> 01:01:11,824
by Cellach and for the book.

555
01:01:13,843 --> 01:01:16,290
Gold!

556
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,500
Brendan!

557
01:02:46,323 --> 01:02:48,410
Aisling!

558
01:02:55,074 --> 01:03:01,074
We gotta go, Brendan,
hopefully be fast enough.

559
01:03:19,098 --> 01:03:21,038
He's alive!

560
01:03:25,918 --> 01:03:28,600
I'm so tired.

561
01:03:31,094 --> 01:03:32,996
Tang, leave me be.

562
01:03:34,682 --> 01:03:35,708
Please ...

563
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,022
Let me be.

564
01:03:44,131 --> 01:03:46,600
You are the abbot of Kells!

565
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,420
Ue has lifted.

566
01:05:24,185 --> 01:05:27,816
The book should be kept beyond any reason
within the walls ...

567
01:05:27,817 --> 01:05:32,022
... journeys through the world with your inspiring creation.

568
01:05:32,023 --> 01:05:33,023
Brendan,

569
01:05:33,752 --> 01:05:36,220
You should take people

570
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:38,815
To give hope ...

571
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:44,850
to light the way in these dark times.

572
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:23,899
"Aisling?

573
01:06:40,684 --> 01:06:43,249
I'm so tired.

574
01:06:43,284 --> 01:06:45,779
Please, father, rest.

575
01:06:45,814 --> 01:06:50,830
Rest?, How our most important
treasure destroyed?!.

576
01:06:50,865 --> 01:06:52,699
But how would know?

577
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,203
How could he know he was going to die?

578
01:06:55,238 --> 01:06:57,056
Please, Father.

579
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:05,507
It was only a child ...

580
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:19,685
Angel of Darkness! Not yet!

581
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:24,071
I need time!

582
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,501
Uncle!

583
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:47,590
Brenda?

584
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,176
Am I dreaming? ...

585
01:07:55,009 --> 01:07:56,839
This is not a dream.

586
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:00,599
I'm so glad to find you here.

587
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,985
I thought I'd lost long ago.

588
01:08:04,124 --> 01:08:05,504
Brendan!

589
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:08,933
Only a small child ...

590
01:08:08,934 --> 01:08:11,649
A lot of innocent people ... lost.

591
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:14,580
- It was all my fault.
- Please, baby ...

592
01:08:14,615 --> 01:08:16,277
... Do not blame yourself

593
01:08:16,312 --> 01:08:18,142
You do not understand.

594
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,673
No time, Brendan.

595
01:08:20,674 --> 01:08:22,154
You were right ...

596
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,178
About Kells ...
597
01:08:24,589 --> 01:08:25,879
About Aidan ...

598
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,294
About the book ...

599
01:08:27,329 --> 01:08:29,619
There should ...

600
01:08:30,249 --> 01:08:32,494
This is all that remained.

601
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:38,816
This is the only consolation I have in this world.

602
01:08:38,817 --> 01:08:41,289
Aidan's brother was right ...

603
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:44,490
And I tried to stop him.

604
01:08:45,218 --> 01:08:49,033
Aidan never heard you, man.

605
01:08:51,334 --> 01:08:53,470
Probably not ...

606
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:59,505
Aidan's brother alive to see
his work through ... and be completed.

607
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,786
Iona's book!

608
01:09:15,821 --> 01:09:17,753
Is the Book of Kells?

609
01:09:20,061 --> 01:09:23,150
Book of Kells.
