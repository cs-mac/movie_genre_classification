1
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:20,486
<i>Well, here I am.</i>

2
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,479
<i>Fuck you, Serking!</i>

3
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:29,496
<i>Hey, watch it, I've been
working out with weights.</i>

4
00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:32,616
<i>Down from the stage, you drunk!</i>

5
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:35,442
<i>I will just drink my wine and leave.
Right?</i>

6
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:42,012
<i>Ok! Let us forget the bullshit
and get into the so called "art".</i>

7
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:48,754
Style...

8
00:01:48,754 --> 00:01:49,648
<i>We love you Charlie.</i>

9
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:55,248
Style is the answer to everything.

10
00:01:56,907 --> 00:01:59,563
A fresh way to approach
a dull or dangerous thing.

11
00:02:01,215 --> 00:02:05,828
To do a dull thing with style is preferable
to doing a dangerous thing without style.

12
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:10,638
To do a dangerous thing
with style is what I call "art".

13
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:15,337
Bull fighting can be an art.

14
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,648
Boxing can be an art.

15
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,199
Loving can be an art.

16
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:24,397
Opening a can of sardines
can be an art.

17
00:02:26,857 --> 00:02:28,358
Not so many have style.

18
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,262
Not many can keep style.

19
00:02:32,383 --> 00:02:34,906
I have seen dogs
with more style than men.

20
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:37,453
Although, not many dogs
have style.

21
00:02:38,695 --> 00:02:40,253
Cats have it with abundance.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,007
When Hemingway put his brains
to the wall with a shotgun...

23
00:02:53,364 --> 00:02:55,736
...that was style.

24
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:58,154
Well... sometime people
give you style.

25
00:02:58,732 --> 00:03:00,661
Joan of Arc had style.

26
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:04,089
John the Baptist, Jesus, Socrates...

27
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:07,039
...Caesar, Garcia Lorca.

28
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:10,119
I have met men
in jail with style.

29
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:14,871
I have met more men in jail
with style than men out of jail.

30
00:03:16,778 --> 00:03:21,655
Style is a difference. The way
of doing. The way of being done.

31
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:27,594
Six herons, standing quietly
in the pool of water,

32
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,827
Or you, walking naked out
of the bathroom - without seeing me.

33
00:03:36,554 --> 00:03:37,590
[APPLAUD]

34
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:21,798
Hi!

35
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:34,734
- You are real?
- Aha

36
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,834
I am a run away.
And this is my bedroom.

37
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:47,864
You wont kick me out, will you?

38
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:50,814
Don't worry kid.
I can't even find my way out.

39
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,470
How old are you, anyway?

40
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:55,849
Twelve.

41
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:34,573
Twelve years over. Early boomer.

42
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:38,225
I was born in Virginia.
Where are you from?

43
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:40,458
Los Angeles.

44
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:46,295
I'm going home tomorrow.

45
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,747
Los angeles.
Is that near Hollywood?

46
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:52,568
Right next door, little button.

47
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:54,973
Oh! Take me with you!
I want to go to Hollywood too.

48
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:02,222
So, What is your name, Ms. Ambitious?

49
00:07:02,998 --> 00:07:04,502
I will tell you mine
if you tell me yours.

50
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,365
Serking. Mr. Charles Serking.

51
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,792
Nice to meet you Chuck.

52
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:19,182
Aha, aha! That's what I thought.

53
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:26,285
Your tits are too big. Atleast 8 years
old a piece. That adds up to 16.

54
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:29,715
You liar.

55
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:36,584
Sometimes I just say I am 12.
I can be anything I want.

56
00:07:41,514 --> 00:07:43,355
I am almost 14 actually.

57
00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:58,066
Rock-a-bye baby,
on the treetop,

58
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:03,413
When the wind blows,
the cradle will rock,

59
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:09,361
When the bough breaks,
the cradle will fall,

60
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:15,661
And down will come baby,
cradle and all.

61
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,303
Rock-a-bye baby...

62
00:09:27,907 --> 00:09:30,606
love you.

63
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:20,212
Hey boys! Seen a girl run out
of here with a sleeping bag?

64
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:23,090
As tall as a midget.
She stole my ticket.

65
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:38,005
Thank you. Thank you.

66
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:43,797
<i>I come to the conclusion that

80
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:55,948
Hey Sarah! Did you miss me?
You missed me?

81
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:41,090
Ohhh...

82
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,668
Fuck you!

83
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:46,694
Just where the hell have you been
for the last 6 weeks?

84
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:51,478
I am tired of having to cover your rent, 
your bar tabs every time you disappear. 
I am tired.

85
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:58,160
Then don't do it like my mother, Viki. 
You are not my wife any more. 
So get hell outta here! Leave me alone.

86
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:02,632
I am just trying to help. 
Rememeber what doctor said 
last time when you were in the hospital.

87
00:14:02,987 --> 00:14:04,201
Hey, give that back!

88
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:09,438
He said that if you don't cut on drinking your
stomach will crumble like wet Kleenex.

89
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:12,401
Cunt!!

92
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:51,289
Hey! Hey! Hey! Cut it out!

93
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:54,049
Cut it out.

94
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:56,913
What I wanted were couple
of bucks not a fists fight.

No, I am not letting you in here.

Because... Why are you here?
You are here to evict me. That you are not gonna do.

Next time, I want you to...

142

...use your belt.

143
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:14,542

Get him!!

Violence.

00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:07,425
Carnal-Violence.

158
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,889
<i>Carnal-Violence. She ate me up like an
enchilada and spit me into the police car.</i>

159
00:30:17,062 --> 00:30:19,339
<i>The next day Vera
dismissed the charges.</i>

160
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:22,991
<i>A brand of psycho-drama can
make a man a little paranoid.</i>

161
00:30:24,229 --> 00:30:28,670
<i>As far as that goes I always considered the
paranoid man with all the thanks.</i>

162
00:30:29,668 --> 00:30:31,664
<i>Besides, I had my ambition
to comfort me.</i>

163
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:35,210
<i>This desire to be unknown,
unwanted and un-noticed.</i>

164
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,352
<i>I was not about to chase the great
American wet dream. I rather get drunk.</i>

165
00:31:29,816 --> 00:31:31,374
You look at me Cass.

166
00:31:32,793 --> 00:31:34,450
I am tired of looking at you.

167
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:36,496
You bitch.

168
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:40,034
Don't give me. I am too beautiful
to bother with' routine.

169
00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:42,392
You are nothing but a whore.

170
00:31:43,645 --> 00:31:46,814
Now get your ass out
on the street and sell it.

171
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,375
I told you I am not working
today and thats it.

172
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,123
No baby, thats not it.

173
00:31:57,689 --> 00:31:59,987
Oh yes, it is.

174
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:07,053
Stanley, give me another one.

175
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:36,945
Hey, watch out.

176
00:32:37,746 --> 00:32:39,850
Listen, turn around
from my job business, asshole!

177
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:41,685
I am talking to the lady.

178
00:32:41,685 --> 00:32:45,195
Ok, whatever you are up to with
the lady. just don't fuck up with my drinks.

179
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,695
If you are around my subject
I will fuck you

180
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:48,229
No problem. You will get
another one on the house.

181
00:32:48,307 --> 00:32:51,717
You are 86 down. Now get outta here!
I will call your parole officer. Brie...

182
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:54,446
I will see you back in the motel.

183
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:58,146
You cunt!

184
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:17,549
Why did you sit next to me?

185
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:19,798
I don't know.

186
00:33:21,044 --> 00:33:22,258
May be because you are ugly.

187
00:33:23,187 --> 00:33:24,714
And you're beautiful.
- Maybe

188
00:33:25,764 --> 00:33:27,821
- Maybe, the most beautiful girl in town.
- Maybe.

189
00:33:30,314 --> 00:33:31,524
So you think I am pretty, ha?

190
00:33:33,901 --> 00:33:37,640
Yes, but 'pretty' is not the word.
Devestating is more likely.

191
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:49,645
Jesus Christ!

192
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:17,974
Cass. I told you not to pull out
that shit in here. It's bad for business.

193
00:34:18,779 --> 00:34:19,662
It's my face, isn't it?

194
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,719
And it's my bar.
You do it again and you are out.

195
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:26,138
Yes, he is right. You shouldn't do it.
You shouldn't hurt yourself.

196
00:34:26,786 --> 00:34:27,673
Why shouldn't I?

197
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,248
Because it hurts me.

198
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,968
So you wanna be a sensetive type.

199
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,368
Yeah, that's right.

200
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:39,019
Ok. Buy me a drink.
Maybe I will behave.

201
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:01,554
God damn it!
She changed the lock.

202
00:35:03,391 --> 00:35:04,350
I can't get in.

203
00:35:04,904 --> 00:35:06,014
You are three months behind.

204
00:35:06,434 --> 00:35:08,066
Stop embarassing me,
give me the key please.

205
00:35:08,403 --> 00:35:09,015
No.

206
00:35:10,661 --> 00:35:11,698
Give me the fucking key.

207
00:35:11,968 --> 00:35:12,897
I said 'no'.

208
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:22,691
We gonna join
my landlady for a drink.

209
00:35:23,108 --> 00:35:24,069
His ex-wife.

210
00:35:31,521 --> 00:35:32,451
Make yourself comfortable.

211
00:35:35,686 --> 00:35:37,623
Want some brandy? Aha.

212
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,193
- What is your name honey?
- Cass.

213
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,111
Cass!

214
00:35:47,505 --> 00:35:49,254
You want some...

215
00:35:50,554 --> 00:35:51,742
Thank you.

216
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,352
He used to call me beautiful once.
You are still beautiful.

217
00:35:56,127 --> 00:35:57,750
I'm just an old nymphomaniac.

218
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:00,847
And I am a whore.

219
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:04,300
You have an accent.
Where are you from?

220
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:06,247
Lots of places.

221
00:36:07,994 --> 00:36:09,050
Where did your parents live?

222
00:36:09,822 --> 00:36:12,423
They died when I was little.
I grew up in a convent.

223
00:36:13,368 --> 00:36:16,445
Are you going to give me the key?
Give me the key.

224
00:36:16,445 --> 00:36:18,067
It hurts. God damn it.

225
00:36:22,373 --> 00:36:23,496
Crazy man.

226
00:36:24,717 --> 00:36:25,398
Let's go.

227
00:36:32,793 --> 00:36:36,259
What's it like to live in the convent?
I wanna hear all about it.

228
00:36:38,414 --> 00:36:39,581
we will talk about later.

229
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:42,251
I think he wants to fuck.

230
00:36:43,627 --> 00:36:44,706
Good luck.

231
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:43,465
You made that up, didn't you?
Story about the convent.

232
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,951
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

233
00:38:22,035 --> 00:38:24,403
You want to make it now
or you gonna be busy all night?

234
00:38:28,691 --> 00:38:30,129
Let us do it first thing
in the morning.

235
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,218
Well... as long
as you don't die on me.

236
00:38:42,463 --> 00:38:44,948
I am not about to die... yet.

237
00:38:58,151 --> 00:39:12,498
<i>Love he said. Kiss me. Kiss my lips. Kiss my ear.
My fingers, my cock, my balls, my eyes, my brains.</i>

238
00:39:15,074 --> 00:39:16,772
<i>Make me forget.</i>

239
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:27,844
See you in the morning.

240
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:17,186
My bull pulled out there.
I don't know what I am gonna do.

241
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:21,345
You are the only man I have
ever known who wasn't in a rush.

242
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:28,804
Come on my man.

243
00:42:27,862 --> 00:42:29,177
Love.

244
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,099
Is your mom okay?

245
00:44:04,566 --> 00:44:06,277
Very very very elegant.

246
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:10,621
Very elegant, haan?

247
00:44:11,533 --> 00:44:12,588
Carry the fur.

248
00:44:15,792 --> 00:44:16,571
Why should I?

249
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:21,025
- Why?
- Yeah, why?

250
00:44:21,654 --> 00:44:22,996
Because I want to fuck you.

251
00:44:24,781 --> 00:44:27,975
I want to be fucked until
I have nothing left for the others.

252
00:44:28,879 --> 00:44:29,878
Nothing.

253
00:44:39,113 --> 00:44:40,011
Beautiful.

254
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,509
I get it.

255
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:59,134
You want me to service you, haan?

256
00:45:01,012 --> 00:45:02,301
Yeah, fill it up.

257
00:45:03,251 --> 00:45:09,393
Well... you have to pay. Her too!

258
00:45:12,947 --> 00:45:17,560
Why not?
I will even pay for the room.

259
00:45:29,455 --> 00:45:32,239
I kill you. You understand?

260
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:51,115
I am paying for this. Now lay down
and take your pants off, slave.

261
00:47:00,996 --> 00:47:02,570
Now give it to me.

262
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:07,416
Take my soul with your cock.

263
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:25,357
Cass is in jail.
It's probabaly your fault.

264
00:47:26,512 --> 00:47:27,231
Ya.

265
00:47:28,475 --> 00:47:30,621
I need a favor lover man.
I got busted for hasselling...

266
00:47:31,001 --> 00:47:32,981
...and I want you to come down
and bail me out, ok?

267
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,350
I am in County Jail. Thanks.

268
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,144
You have the money?

269
00:48:51,812 --> 00:48:52,890
You can go fuck yourself.

270
00:49:03,066 --> 00:49:05,656
Now you are my man... forever.

271
00:49:12,781 --> 00:49:15,087
<i>Cass had that special look
that got to me... </i>

272
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:19,978
<i>...while she's been blown away by the winds of
eternity and was swimming back against the currrent.</i>

273
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,273
<i>There was something mysterious
going on and I plunged right in.</i>

274
00:49:25,912 --> 00:49:28,345
<i>I was in over my head
my mind kept telling me...</i>

275
00:49:29,053 --> 00:49:30,996
<i>...I had to come up
for some air.</i>

276
00:49:31,287 --> 00:49:35,170
<i>The Cass was like a fluid fire and
her flesh had already sucked me in.</i>

277
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:38,352
<i>I had to get away from
her before I got burnt.</i>

278
00:49:39,399 --> 00:49:42,677
<i>That was like trying to
climb out of the whirlpool.</i>

279
00:50:04,508 --> 00:50:06,330
Well... hello stranger.

280
00:50:20,334 --> 00:50:22,903
Hey, don't go away...
I'll be rigth back.

281
00:50:50,197 --> 00:50:51,581
- Are you ready?
- Just a second.

282
00:51:24,718 --> 00:51:27,086
Good! Got any wine?

283
00:51:27,225 --> 00:51:28,777
Gallon in the cabinet.

284
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,477
Let's see what we have got here.

285
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:26,795
You devil.

286
00:52:41,096 --> 00:52:44,692
Mike! Hi!
How was your school today?

287
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:45,605
Terrible.

288
00:52:45,897 --> 00:52:50,095
Terrific! Here... here...
go ahead with a Bimbo Pie.

289
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:12,715
I had this friend once.
He had this desire...

290
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,259
...this obsession to return
to his mother's womb.

291
00:53:21,548 --> 00:53:22,914
And one day...

292
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:27,996
...that obsession became a reality.

293
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:08,657
It's okay...it's okay.
Come to me my baby.

294
00:54:25,631 --> 00:54:26,859
It wasn't true.

295
00:54:28,938 --> 00:54:30,069
I made it up.

296
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:43,857
<i>Ever heard the sound
of one mouth screaming?</i>

297
00:54:44,784 --> 00:54:47,123
<i> I had for years. My own.</i>

298
00:54:50,564 --> 00:54:53,645
<i>I didn't wanna go home.
I didn't wanna see anybody.</i>

299
00:54:55,134 --> 00:54:57,360
<i>I just needed to be invisible
for a few days...</i>

300
00:54:58,787 --> 00:55:02,097
<i>...to get down in the dirt.
Booze myself with all the others.</i>

301
00:55:03,207 --> 00:55:06,459
<i>The defeated, the demented
and the damned!</i>

302
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:09,803
<i>They are the real people
of this world.</i>

303
00:55:11,089 --> 00:55:13,546
<i>And I was proud
to be in their company.</i>

304
00:55:40,688 --> 00:55:41,687
Hi!

305
00:55:43,115 --> 00:55:45,673
You know I was born
on the same day as President Regan?

306
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:51,586
I was invited to the White House for the party
but when I got there...They wouldn't let me in.

307
00:55:53,346 --> 00:55:55,535
Yeah.. what that luck makes you!

308
00:56:17,443 --> 00:56:20,940
Born on the same day
but a lot of good it did me.

309
00:56:50,097 --> 00:56:50,985
You are all right?

310
00:56:52,101 --> 00:56:54,232
You go ahead and have a drink.
I don't think I can make it.

311
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:56,266
Where is it?

312
00:56:56,716 --> 00:56:59,755
Just in the back,
around the corner.

313
00:57:38,511 --> 00:57:39,289
So what are your holding man?

314
00:57:41,344 --> 00:57:42,163
Come on, sit down.

315
00:57:45,594 --> 00:57:46,299
Thanks.

316
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:01,894
Why so quiet?

317
00:58:03,653 --> 00:58:04,942
I don't have much to talk about.

318
00:58:15,786 --> 00:58:16,601
Come on boys...

319
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:20,169
Cheer up.

320
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:22,288
Here, to us!

321
00:58:29,602 --> 00:58:30,431
Mad!

322
00:58:32,207 --> 00:58:33,490
- Mad!
- Sometimes!

323
00:58:34,055 --> 00:58:34,832
- We are all mad.
- Naturally.

324
00:58:36,124 --> 00:58:38,197
Mad for glory, mad for freedom...

325
00:58:39,827 --> 00:58:43,715
...and we are gone mad
you know we laugh or cry...

326
00:58:45,684 --> 00:58:50,007
...lying to the fate and
fact of illusion and insanity.

327
00:58:55,313 --> 00:58:58,898
All meaningless, all ego.

328
00:59:01,576 --> 00:59:04,342
For all that madness,
madness is our fate.

329
00:59:04,342 --> 00:59:05,123
Hey you!

330
00:59:06,398 --> 00:59:07,225
Wake up!

331
00:59:08,694 --> 00:59:09,661
Get out of the car!

332
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:16,666
Out!

333
00:59:20,209 --> 00:59:22,190
Easy... easy.

334
00:59:26,777 --> 00:59:28,258
Sorry. I had one of those nights.

335
00:59:29,711 --> 00:59:31,015
Fucked and came running here...
Free hotel?

336
00:59:31,847 --> 00:59:32,836
Son of a bitch!

337
00:59:33,233 --> 00:59:34,088
- Let me do it Dad... let me.
- Go ahead.

338
00:59:35,035 --> 00:59:36,111
Easy... easy.

339
00:59:36,516 --> 00:59:37,251
Don't touch that boy!

340
00:59:50,051 --> 00:59:52,019
Let me kill him Dad...
Let me kill him.

341
00:59:53,733 --> 00:59:55,712
Heyyyyaaaa!

341
00:59:57,733 --> 00:59:59,712
Enough, Dale!

341
00:59:56,733 --> 00:59:57,712


341
00:59:56,733 --> 00:59:57,712


341
00:59:56,733 --> 00:59:57,712


342
01:00:50,506 --> 01:00:51,064
Get the fuck out of here.

343
01:00:55,331 --> 01:00:56,323
What do you want? I am busy.

344
01:00:56,592 --> 01:00:58,120
Out of my way!
Gotta get my medicine.

345
01:01:03,184 --> 01:01:04,343
What's up Pepito?

346
01:01:25,665 --> 01:01:27,299
You won't believe
how he eats my pussy.

347
01:01:28,687 --> 01:01:32,437
We are getting married next month.
It's ok for you?

348
01:01:33,271 --> 01:01:34,252
is there any coffee?

349
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,978
Welcome back stranger.

350
01:01:59,334 --> 01:02:00,905
It's been a while there, I didn't
think I was gonna make it back.

351
01:02:03,371 --> 01:02:04,378
Let's have a club soda.

352
01:02:05,127 --> 01:02:06,219
I must be hearing that.

353
01:02:08,137 --> 01:02:09,187
Cass' been around?

354
01:02:09,594 --> 01:02:11,388
Cass? Who is Cass?

355
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:40,490
- But she is my girl now. All right, Cass?
- Right.

356
01:02:40,997 --> 01:02:42,557
Mind if I borrow your girl
for a minute, Mike?

357
01:02:42,557 --> 01:02:43,637
But she is my girl now.

358
01:02:47,184 --> 01:02:48,434
But she is my girl now.

359
01:03:00,612 --> 01:03:01,570
You look sensational.

360
01:03:02,693 --> 01:03:03,387
Thanks.

361
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,180
Did you miss me?

362
01:03:07,348 --> 01:03:08,226
Yes.

363
01:03:10,718 --> 01:03:11,826
I thought about you a lot.

364
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:14,957
I thought what you were doing.

365
01:03:17,914 --> 01:03:20,804
Terrible. Club soda.
For the stomach.

366
01:03:22,571 --> 01:03:23,694
I am hassling again.

367
01:03:25,612 --> 01:03:26,859
I'm sad to hear that.

368
01:03:27,441 --> 01:03:30,437
Life is sad.
So let's not talk about that.

369
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:35,151
Let's have a happy moment.
Please!

370
01:03:36,252 --> 01:03:39,610
Sure why not? Who knows,
maybe we will get lucky.

371
01:04:06,602 --> 01:04:07,697
Are you going to work?

372
01:04:08,526 --> 01:04:10,446
Work? I never work.

373
01:04:20,127 --> 01:04:21,355
You want a little attention,
don't you?

374
01:04:57,842 --> 01:04:58,936
Leave it alone.

375
01:05:07,796 --> 01:05:08,997
Fuck!

376
01:05:11,793 --> 01:05:13,131
Oh, fuck!

377
01:05:14,479 --> 01:05:16,325
I tried it with a broken bottle
one night.

378
01:05:16,707 --> 01:05:17,583
Fuck.

379
01:06:01,331 --> 01:06:02,617
Kiss me.

380
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:06,456
Kiss my lips.

381
01:06:07,832 --> 01:06:09,680
And my hair.

382
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:15,296
My fingers.

383
01:06:20,225 --> 01:06:22,250
Make me forget.

384
01:07:23,129 --> 01:07:24,042
Good morning ladies.

385
01:07:54,849 --> 01:07:56,302
This is where I used to write
before I got famous.

386
01:07:58,344 --> 01:07:59,375
Saw a wild scene once.

387
01:08:01,013 --> 01:08:02,798
Seagulls died bombing
flock of geese.

388
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:06,956
They were flying South
beating with their wings.

389
01:08:09,514 --> 01:08:11,010
I thought they wanted to eat them.

390
01:08:12,842 --> 01:08:16,440
They were doing it out of meanness.

391
01:08:31,872 --> 01:08:33,623
- Anybody in the blue room?
- No.

392
01:08:37,013 --> 01:08:40,348
But I had to raise the price.
It will be thirty dollars with your meals.

393
01:08:41,396 --> 01:08:42,956
Wine not include.

394
01:10:18,416 --> 01:10:19,852
Why do you keep
doing this to yourself?

395
01:10:22,044 --> 01:10:24,382
What's the matter?
Don't you like me any more?

396
01:10:26,986 --> 01:10:28,221
Am I not so beautiful?

397
01:10:29,038 --> 01:10:31,888
Cass, you bitch! I love you.

398
01:10:33,074 --> 01:10:34,840
You are the most alive woman
I've ever met.

399
01:11:18,009 --> 01:11:19,534
Will you marry me?

400
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:06,758
Shit!

401
01:12:11,865 --> 01:12:14,745
<i>I guess I had fallen asleep
after we made love again.</i>

402
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:17,134
<i>Cass had been crying. </i>

403
01:12:18,199 --> 01:12:20,506
<i>She didn't make a sound
but I could feel the tears.</i>

404
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,465
<i>They were wet and hot.</i>

405
01:12:24,514 --> 01:12:27,861
<i>Pouring from some mortal wound
in her soul as she held on to me.</i>

406
01:12:29,405 --> 01:12:33,119
<i>Her long hair... spilling out across
the sand, like a flag of death. </i>

407
01:13:43,747 --> 01:13:45,920
Why the fuck did you take off
leaving me on the sand bar?

408
01:13:47,394 --> 01:13:48,713
I could have drowned out there.

409
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,879
Huh!

410
01:14:22,974 --> 01:14:23,858
I can't believe it.

411
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,393
They won't bullshit me.

412
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,035
They really want me
to come to New York.

413
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,833
Love he said...make me forget.

414
01:14:42,659 --> 01:14:44,621
I will always remember that.

415
01:14:46,178 --> 01:14:47,785
I will call you from New York
tomorrow night.

416
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:50,507
You stay here.

417
01:14:52,914 --> 01:14:55,219
If things look good out there,
I send you a ticket.

418
01:14:58,424 --> 01:14:59,595
Spend sometime together.

419
01:15:03,638 --> 01:15:05,316
Maybe your luck's turned around.

420
01:15:57,611 --> 01:15:58,809
Oh my God!

421
01:16:02,674 --> 01:16:04,204
Oh my God!

422
01:16:11,305 --> 01:16:12,569
What the fuck did you do to yourself?

423
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:16,323
Huh? What did you do?

424
01:16:17,003 --> 01:16:19,035
I have closed it.
For you. For everybody.

425
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:20,936
Forever!

426
01:17:59,513 --> 01:18:00,054
Lord God.

427
01:18:02,588 --> 01:18:04,086
Jesus.

428
01:19:17,236 --> 01:19:19,881
We would like to think we are island
of calm in the middle of the city...

429
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:23,466
You know where writers can come and
relax, enjoy a bit of solitude.

430
01:19:25,585 --> 01:19:26,664
Modern shoes?

431
01:19:27,078 --> 01:19:29,918
Yeah! I think I got the wrong size.
They are killing my feet.

432
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,064
No problem.
We can fix some new ones.

433
01:19:32,262 --> 01:19:34,596
Yeah, that's right. Can we go inside?
I am fucking freezing here.

434
01:19:35,106 --> 01:19:36,301
Yeah, sure. Right this way.

435
01:19:40,441 --> 01:19:41,455
We have got lots of space here.

436
01:19:41,747 --> 01:19:42,805
Yeah, I can see that.

437
01:19:46,984 --> 01:19:49,802
Hi, Alexander! I would like you
to meet one of our new authors.

438
01:19:50,684 --> 01:19:52,079
Someone, we are lucky enough
to get out of Russia.

439
01:19:52,667 --> 01:19:53,544
Alexander Konchalovski.

440
01:19:53,913 --> 01:19:54,827
Charles Serking.

441
01:19:55,194 --> 01:19:56,098
Pleasure!

442
01:19:58,363 --> 01:20:00,008
Where is your toilet?
I can't hold it much longer.

443
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:01,927
Right this way.

444
01:20:09,274 --> 01:20:10,835
Welcome to World Land Mr. Serking.

445
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:13,379
- Arthur!
- Peter!

446
01:20:15,147 --> 01:20:16,197
Mr. Strange, I presume.

447
01:20:17,575 --> 01:20:18,950
It is pronounced Straunch.

448
01:20:20,152 --> 01:20:21,214
Join me for a glass of wine.

449
01:20:21,531 --> 01:20:22,747
I don't drink. Thank you.

450
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:25,307
Ah... all the more for me then!

451
01:20:36,994 --> 01:20:38,589
Peter, you sit here.
I will sit there.

452
01:20:43,596 --> 01:20:44,727
I want to see our poet.

453
01:20:49,448 --> 01:20:50,308
Shall we eat?

454
01:20:59,194 --> 01:21:03,880
I realize that all this is a bit sudden
for you. Coming to New York... you know.

455
01:21:04,684 --> 01:21:05,451
Well... you can say that again.

456
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:08,463
Well, I want you
to feel comfortable with us.

457
01:21:09,554 --> 01:21:10,960
We have been aware of your work
for quiet a while.

458
01:21:12,579 --> 01:21:13,959
And we feel that your time has come.

459
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:18,155
Maybe.

460
01:21:18,723 --> 01:21:19,882
No 'maybe' is a 'but'.

461
01:21:21,242 --> 01:21:22,321
Would you like some quiche?

462
01:21:23,987 --> 01:21:25,907
No thanks. I can't get anything
down this time of the day.

463
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:31,226
The wine would do fine.

464
01:21:38,492 --> 01:21:41,378
You should know that we are here
to help you in our way.

465
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:44,559
For example, you should
stay and work here.

466
01:21:45,614 --> 01:21:49,488
The talent like yours, needs
other kinds of nourishment.

467
01:21:50,907 --> 01:21:51,954
A lot of attention.

468
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,097
(burp).., I am sorry.

469
01:21:59,476 --> 01:22:03,662
No need to be! It's an old Chinese
custom. A sign of contentment.

470
01:22:08,554 --> 01:22:10,165
It's been an interesting convo,
won't you say?

471
01:22:10,594 --> 01:22:13,794
Definitely strange!
I mean "Straunch"!

472
01:22:15,411 --> 01:22:15,980
Na... now it's time to see Rock...

473
01:22:16,226 --> 01:22:17,533
No! It's okay. its okay.

474
01:22:19,288 --> 01:22:20,429
Okay.

475
01:22:20,656 --> 01:22:22,004
You speak...

476
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:38,845
Beautiful vine. How long
did it take it to grow them?

477
01:22:39,438 --> 01:22:40,360
Ten years.

478
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:32,195
<i>You need a doctor
not a publisher, he said.</i>

479
01:25:33,222 --> 01:25:34,242
<i>Fuck you, I said.</i>

480
01:25:35,146 --> 01:25:36,440
<i>That was the end of that. </i>

481
01:25:36,908 --> 01:25:38,204
<i>I was back to square zero.</i>

482
01:25:55,255 --> 01:25:56,546
Here comes a guy who
knows everything about women.

483
01:25:59,959 --> 01:26:03,037
This truth you know all right.
The asshole who knows everything.

484
01:26:05,334 --> 01:26:07,993
Let me tell you something Mister.
He don't know a shit!

485
01:26:16,821 --> 01:26:17,741
Hey... whiskey Kenny.

486
01:26:21,699 --> 01:26:22,568
Have you seen Cass?

487
01:26:23,256 --> 01:26:24,143
Haven't you heard?

488
01:26:27,616 --> 01:26:28,499
Heard what?

489
01:26:29,111 --> 01:26:30,492
She killed herself.

490
01:26:35,136 --> 01:26:36,178
How did she do it?

491
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,150
She slashed her throat.

492
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,726
This is desecration!
Have you no shame?

493
01:27:39,777 --> 01:27:42,202
You are committing a sacrilege,
a sacrilege!

494
01:27:42,887 --> 01:27:44,444
- A sacrilege!
- Leave me alone.

495
01:27:48,717 --> 01:27:50,397
Let me say, my good byes in peace.

496
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,763
You are too beautiful.
Too beautiful...

497
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:09,005
You are too beautiful.
Too beautiful...

498
01:28:28,424 --> 01:28:31,001
<i>When the bottom drops out,
it's a terrifying ride.</i>

499
01:28:32,546 --> 01:28:35,904
<i>Throughout my life, I had always
challanged the death of the soul of everybody.</i>

500
01:28:37,027 --> 01:28:40,070
<i>The fools, the fiends,
the friends, the fakers.</i>

501
01:28:41,436 --> 01:28:44,782
<i>My mouth has always been big but
I like to think my words are beautiful.</i>

502
01:28:46,051 --> 01:28:48,583
<i>But now there were no words.
Only emptiness.</i>

503
01:28:49,947 --> 01:28:54,506
<i>And I was blinded by the ambers of memory and a
million thoughts about the most beautiful girl in town.</i>

504
01:28:56,202 --> 01:29:00,192
<i>She was gone. Cass,
that whore of an angle who...</i>

505
01:29:00,193 --> 01:29:04,988
<i>flew too close
to the ground and crashed.</i>

506
01:30:02,885 --> 01:30:04,541
I'll take care of my poor.

507
01:30:12,043 --> 01:30:16,123
Look at his state. Lift up.

508
01:31:11,746 --> 01:31:13,340
Are you Serking,
the man who writes poems?

509
01:31:14,164 --> 01:31:16,273
I don't write poems.
I am a drunk and I enjoy it.

510
01:31:17,002 --> 01:31:17,972
Will you write me a poem?

511
01:31:20,970 --> 01:31:22,616
What you will give me for?

512
01:31:55,385 --> 01:31:56,469
Where does poetry come from?

513
01:32:02,971 --> 01:32:05,271
You show me your tities
and I will compose a poem.

514
01:32:05,983 --> 01:32:06,822
Just for you.

515
01:32:44,385 --> 01:32:46,576
Come to my island!
Come on! Come!

516
01:33:01,399 --> 01:33:03,856
You might know about poetry
but you don't know the road.

517
01:33:34,657 --> 01:33:36,155
And the Sun wheels mercy...

518
01:33:37,024 --> 01:33:38,733
but like a torch carried too high.

519
01:33:41,162 --> 01:33:43,018
And the jets sweep across it's sight...

520
01:33:44,057 --> 01:33:45,655
and the rockets leap like toads.

521
01:33:48,675 --> 01:33:50,900
Peace is no longer,
for some reason,  precious.

522
01:33:52,439 --> 01:33:55,006
Madness drifts like
lilypads on the pond...

523
01:33:55,642 --> 01:33:56,846
circling senselessly.

524
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:20,512
The painters paint.

525
01:34:20,943 --> 01:34:22,802
They paint their
reds and greens and yellows.

526
01:34:24,341 --> 01:34:25,886
Poets rhyme their lonliness.

527
01:34:27,326 --> 01:34:29,056
Musicians starve as always.

528
01:34:30,535 --> 01:34:32,063
And novelists miss the mark.

529
01:34:35,705 --> 01:34:38,089
But not the pelican, the gull.

530
01:34:43,249 --> 01:34:45,240
Pelicans dip and dive.

531
01:34:48,771 --> 01:34:52,713
Rise, shaking, shocked as dead...

532
01:34:54,195 --> 01:34:56,115
radio-active fish in their beaks.

533
01:34:58,573 --> 01:35:00,519
The sky breaks radiant arch.

534
01:35:01,978 --> 01:35:03,719
Flowers open as
they have always opened.

535
01:35:05,209 --> 01:35:06,836
But covered with a thin dust...

536
01:35:07,553 --> 01:35:08,815
with rocket fuel.

537
01:35:09,921 --> 01:35:11,269
And mushrooms... 

537
01:35:12,921 --> 01:35:14,269
poison mushrooms.

538
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:17,760
And in a million rooms...

539
01:35:18,585 --> 01:35:20,669
lovers lie intwined...

540
01:35:21,491 --> 01:35:24,221
and lost in sickest peace.

541
01:35:27,578 --> 01:35:28,765
Can't we awaken?

542
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:31,801
Must we, forever, dear friends...

543
01:35:33,125 --> 01:35:35,909
die in our sleep?
