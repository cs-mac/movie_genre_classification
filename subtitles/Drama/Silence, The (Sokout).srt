2
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,461
Starling!

3
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,048
Starling!

4
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:57,720
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

5
00:02:58,096 --> 00:02:59,514
Thank you, sir.

6
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,980
Clarice.
Hey.

7
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,781
So there shouldn't be any problem
if you could...

8
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:41,324
You looking for Crawford?
Yes, sir.

9
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:42,533
He should be back in a couple minutes.

10
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:43,718
Why don't you wait in his office?

11
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:44,994
Okay.

12
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:48,206
And I think they were over in Flushing...

13
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,011
Starling...

14
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,972
Clarice M. Good morning.

15
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,473
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.

16
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:50,852
Sorry to pull you off of the course
at such short notice.

17
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:52,895
Your instructors tell me you're doing well.

18
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,355
Top quarter of your class.

19
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,400
I hope so. They haven't posted
any grades yet.

20
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:00,361
A job's come up, and I thought about you.

21
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:01,571
Not a job, really.

22
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:03,322
More of an interesting errand.

23
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:04,615
Sit down.

24
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,284
Yes, sir.

25
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:10,329
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.

26
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:13,332
You grilled me pretty hard, as I recall,

27
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,877
on the Bureau's civil rights record
in the Hoover years.

28
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,295
I gave you an

29
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:18,796
A-minus, sir.

30
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:24,719
Let's see. Double major, psych and criminology.
Graduated magna.

31
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:27,513
Summer internships at the Reitzinger Clinic.

32
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:29,474
It says here when you graduate,

33
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:32,560
you want to come to work for me
in Behavioral Science.

34
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,812
Yes, very much, sir.
Very much.

35
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,941
We're interviewing all the serial killers
now in custody

36
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:41,110
for a psycho-behavioral profile.

37
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:43,905
It could be a real help in unsolved cases.

38
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,824
Most of them have been happy to talk to us.

39
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,118
Do you spook easily, Starling?

40
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,828
Not yet, sir.

41
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:53,915
See, the one we want most,
refuses to cooperate.

42
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:56,793
I want you to go after him again today
in the asylum.

43
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:58,503
And who's the subject?

44
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,880
The psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter.

45
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:03,007
Hannibal the Cannibal.

46
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:06,010
I don't expect him to talk to you,

47
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:10,181
but I have to be able to say we tried.

48
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,682
So if he won't cooperate,

49
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,267
I want just straight reporting.

50
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:15,353
How's he look? How's his cell look?

51
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,063
Is he sketching, drawing?

52
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,357
If he is, what's he sketching?

53
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,113
Here's a dossier on Lecter.

54
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:31,035
A copy of our questionnaire
and a special ID for you.

55
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,038
Have your memo on my desk
by 0800 Wednesday.

56
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:35,289
Okay.

57
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,878
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?

58
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,922
Lecter's been in prison for
so many years now.

59
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:46,175
Is there some connection between him
and Buffalo Bill maybe?

60
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,885
I wish there were.

61
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:50,471
I want your full attention, Starling.

62
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:52,140
Yes, sir.

63
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:54,851
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

64
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,103
Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over

65
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,981
all the physical procedures used with him.

66
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:03,317
Do not deviate from them for any reason
whatsoever,

67
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,320
and you're to tell him nothing personal,
Starling.

68
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:09,991
Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter
inside your head.

69
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:12,827
Just do your job, but never forget
what he is.

70
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,078
And what is that?

71
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:16,581
Oh, he's a monster.

72
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:18,583
A Pure psychopath.

73
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,419
So rare to capture one alive.

74
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:22,837
From a research point of view,

75
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,214
Lecter is our most prized asset.

76
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,050
Well.

77
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,679
You know, we get a lot of detectives here,

78
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:34,473
but I must say, I can't ever remember
one as attractive.

79
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:39,687
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

80
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:44,108
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.

81
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:47,820
Well, I'm sure this is a great town,
Dr. Chilton,

82
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:51,115
but, uh, my instructions
are to talk to Dr. Lecter

83
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,783
and report back this afternoon.

84
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:54,285
I see.

85
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:56,704
Let's make this quick, then.

86
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,456
We've tried to study him, of course,

87
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,417
but he's much too sophisticated
for the standard tests.

88
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,878
Oh, my, does he hate us!

89
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,963
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

90
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,426
Crawford's very clever, isn't he?
Using you.

91
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:11,886
What do you mean, sir?

92
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:15,097
A pretty young woman to turn him on.

93
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:18,017
I don't believe Lecter's even seen a woman
in eight years.

94
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,353
And, oh, are you ever his taste.

95
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:22,063
So to speak.

96
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:23,898
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.

97
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,233
It is not a charm school.

98
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:28,527
Good. Then you should be able to remember
the rules.

99
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:32,657
Do not touch the glass.

100
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,783
Do not approach the glass.

101
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,534
You pass him nothing but soft paper.

102
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,245
No pencils or pens.

103
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:39,413
No staples or paper clips on his paper.

104
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:41,874
Use the sliding food carrier.
No exceptions.

105
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,085
If he attempts to pass you anything,
do not accept it.

106
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,211
Do you understand me?

107
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:46,545
Yes, I understand, sir.

108
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:51,592
I'm going to show you why we insist
on such precautions.

109
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:54,303
On the afternoon of July 8,1981,

110
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:55,596
he complained of chest pains

111
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,306
and was taken to the dispensary.

112
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,101
His mouthpiece and restraints
were removed for an EKG.

113
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:03,020
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

114
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:09,026
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less,

115
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,611
save one of her eyes.

116
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:12,905
His pulse never got above 85,

117
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,449
even when he ate her tongue.

118
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,035
I keep him in here.

119
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,662
Dr. Chilton.

120
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:24,500
If Lecter feels that you're his enemy,

121
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,961
then, uh, well, maybe we'll have more luck

122
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,421
if I go in by myself.

123
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,089
What do you think?

124
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,969
You might have suggested this in my office

125
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,345
and saved me the time.

126
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:40,141
Yes, sir, but then I...I would have missed

127
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,393
the pleasure of your company, sir.

128
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:47,106
When she's finished, bring her out.

129
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:17,595
Hi. I'm Barney.

130
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:20,598
He told you, don't get near the glass?

131
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:22,808
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

132
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:25,144
Mmm..hmm. Nice to meet you, Clarice.

133
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,688
You can hang your coat up here if you like.

134
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:29,440
Thank you. I will.

135
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:33,861
He's past the others.
The last cell.

136
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:35,780
You keep to the right.

137
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,950
I put out a chair for you.

138
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:42,578
Oh, yes. That's very good.
Thank you.

139
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:46,624
I'll be watching.
You'll do fine.

140
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:58,552
Hi.

141
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:19,532
I can smell your cunt.

142
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,547
Good morning.

143
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:36,966
Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling.

144
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,300
May I speak with you?

145
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,679
You're one of Jack Crawford's, aren't you?

146
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,097
I am, yes, sir.

147
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,724
May I see your credentials?

148
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:47,935
Certainly.

149
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,527
Closer, please.

150
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:00,072
Closer.

151
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,882
That expires in one week.

152
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,634
You're not real FBI, are you?

153
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,429
I'm still in training at the Academy.

154
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,349
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

155
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,560
Yes. I'm a student.

156
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,854
I'm here to learn from you.

157
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,272
Maybe you can decide for yourself

158
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,483
whether or not I'm qualified enough
to do that.

159
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:36,567
Mmm.

160
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:41,697
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

161
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:46,911
Sit, please.

162
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,128
Now, then. Tell me,

163
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:58,464
what did Miggs say to you?

164
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,966
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.

165
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:02,927
He hissed at you.

166
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,595
What did he say?

167
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:08,724
He said, <i>I can smell your cunt.</i>

168
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,267
I see.

169
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:13,562
I myself cannot.

170
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,241
You use Evyan skin cream.

171
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,788
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps,

172
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:33,666
but not today.

173
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:38,045
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?

174
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,129
Ah!

175
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:44,134
That is the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere.

176
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,263
You know Florence?

177
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,558
All that detail just from memory, sir?

178
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:54,562
Memory, Agent Starling, is what
I have instead of a view.

179
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:55,771
Well,

180
00:14:55,854 --> 00:15:00,693
perhaps you'd care to lend us your view
on this questionnaire, sir.

181
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:03,153
Oh, no, no, no, no.

182
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:05,239
You were doing fine.

183
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:08,450
You had been courteous and receptive
to courtesy.

184
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:13,122
You had established trust with the embarrassing
truth about Miggs.

185
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:17,376
And now this ham-handed segue line
into your questionnaire.

186
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,504
It won't do.

187
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:22,756
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor.

188
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,925
Either you will or you won't.

189
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,051
Yeah.

190
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,804
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed,

191
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,724
if he is recruiting help from
the student body.

192
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:34,602
Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill.

193
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:36,812
What a naughty boy he is.

194
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:40,733
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?

195
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:43,986
Please tell me. The newspapers won't say.

196
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,906
Well, it started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

197
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,744
They said, <i>This one likes to skin his humps.</i>

198
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:57,249
Why do you think he removes their skins,

199
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,792
Agent Starling?

200
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:01,211
Enthrall me with your acumen.

201
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,380
It excites him.

202
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:07,468
Most serial killers keep some sort
of trophies from their victims.

203
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:08,844
I didn't.

204
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,054
No.

205
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,805
No, you ate yours.

206
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,393
You send that through now.

207
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,834
Hmm.

208
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,463
Oh, Agent Starling,

209
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:48,050
you think you can dissect me
with this blunt, little tool?

210
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:49,635
No.

211
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,595
I...I thought that your knowledge...

212
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,931
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

213
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,557
You know what you look like to me

214
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,060
with your good bag and your cheap shoes?

215
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,937
You look like a rube.

216
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,358
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste.

217
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,569
Good nutrition has given you
some length of bone,

218
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:10,989
but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash,

219
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,991
are you, Agent Starling?

220
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,869
And that accent you've tried
so desperately to shed,

221
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,705
pure West Virginia.

222
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:19,431
What does your father do?

223
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,541
Is he a coal miner?

224
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,626
Does he stink of the lamp?

225
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,337
And, oh, how quickly the boys found you.

226
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:28,966
All those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars,

227
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,803
while you could only dream of getting out,
getting anywhere,

228
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:36,598
getting all the way to the FBI.

229
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,770
You see a lot, Doctor.

230
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,149
But are you strong enough to point

231
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,735
that high-powered perception at yourself?

232
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,195
What about it? Why don't you...

233
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,365
why don't you look at yourself
and write down what you see?

234
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,535
Maybe you're afraid to.

235
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,922
A census-taker once tried to test me.

236
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:12,676
I ate his liver with some fava beans,

237
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,803
and a nice Chianti.

238
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:26,523
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

239
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,692
Fly, fly, fly...

240
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:47,711
I bit my wrist so I could die.

241
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:50,839
Look at the blood!

242
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,549
Gotcha!

243
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,677
Miggs! You stupid fuck!

244
00:18:58,055 --> 00:18:59,640
Hannibal the Cannibal!

245
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,308
Agent Starling!
Come back!

246
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,602
Agent Starling!
Agent Starling!

247
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,270
I would not have had that happen to you.

248
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,147
Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly to me.

249
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:08,482
Then do this test for me.

250
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:09,817
No, but I will make you happy.

251
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,735
I'll give you a chance for what you love most.

252
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:12,820
And what is that, Doctor?

253
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:14,947
Advancement, of course.
Now listen carefully.

254
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,491
Look deep within yourself, Clarice Starling.

255
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,577
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine.

256
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,995
M-O-F-E-T. Go now.
Doctor.

257
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,997
I don't think Miggs could manage again
quite so soon,

258
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,290
even though he is crazy.

259
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:26,667
Go now!

260
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,793
Hey, Bill.

261
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,423
Hey.

262
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:15,549
Daddy!

263
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:16,633
Hey, Clarice.

264
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,511
How are you?

265
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,472
Did you get any bad guys today, Daddy?

266
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,391
No, angel they all got away.

267
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,893
Aw, shoot.

268
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:48,415
FBI! Hands up!
Don't move!

269
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:49,625
Turn around!

270
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,044
Hands behind your back!
Thumbs up.

271
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,674
You're dead, Starling.

272
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:01,178
Johnson, good job. Good entry.
Good commands.

273
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,305
Starling, where's your danger area?
In the corner, sir.

274
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:04,765
Did you check the corner?
No, sir.

275
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,016
That's the reason you're dead.

276
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,851
3109.

277
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,353
3109.

278
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:13,774
Breaking doors or windows
to enter or exit.

279
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,151
Rule 404...

280
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,421
Clarice, phone.

281
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:37,923
It's the guru.
Crawford?

282
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,132
Yeah.
Thanks, Ardelia.

283
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:40,634
Starling?

284
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:41,885
<i>Sir?</i>

285
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,720
Miggs is dead.

286
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:47,474
Dead? How?

287
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,811
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him
all afternoon,

288
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:51,937
and Miggs crying...

289
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,146
They found him at bed check.

290
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,023
He'd swallowed his own tongue.

291
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:58,860
Starling?

292
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:01,196
Yeah, I'm...I'm still here, sir.

293
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,241
I just...I don't know how to feel
about this.

294
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,493
You don't have to feel any way about it.

295
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:08,662
Lecter did it to amuse himself.

296
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,790
<i>Look, I know it got ugly today,</i>

297
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:15,252
but you mentioned a name at the end.
Mofet.

298
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,586
Any follow-up on her?

299
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,631
Uh, well, Lecter altered or destroyed

300
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:21,466
most of his patients' histories
prior to capture,

301
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,343
so there's no record of anyone named Mofet.

302
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:27,681
But, uh, I thought the <i>yourself</i> reference

303
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,558
was, uh, too hokey for Lecter,

304
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:32,185
so I figured, he's from Baltimore,

305
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,687
and I looked in the phone book,

306
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,274
and there's a <i>Your Self Storage</i> facility,

307
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,609
<i>right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.</i>

308
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:45,741
Unit 31 was leased for 10 years,

309
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,367
prepaid in full.

310
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:48,994
The contract

311
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:53,123
is in the name of a Miss Hester Mofet.

312
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:56,460
So nobody's been in here since 1980?

313
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:58,503
Not to my knowledge.

314
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:02,924
Privacy is a great concern to my customers.

315
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,802
Yes, I won't disturb anything.
I promise.

316
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,096
I'll be out of here before you know it.

317
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:11,725
Yes, actually, you can.

318
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:18,398
It's stuck.

319
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:21,234
We could return tomorrow with my son.

320
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:22,986
What about him?

321
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,573
I would ask my driver to help you,

322
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,992
but he detests physical labor.

323
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:31,161
Great.

324
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,498
You just stay here. I'll be back
in one minute.

325
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,281
It's stuck.

326
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:09,950
Hand me that flashlight, sir.

327
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:22,212
Oh.

328
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:23,588
Um...

329
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,466
If this door should fall down

330
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,052
or anything else, uh,

331
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,806
this is the number for our Baltimore
field office.

332
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:34,683
Now, they know that you're with me.

333
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,810
You call them if anything should happen.

334
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:38,562
Yes, Miss Starling.

335
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,174
They're waiting for you.
Watch yourself.

336
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:14,718
Thank you.

337
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:16,678
Hester Mofet.

338
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,388
It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?

339
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:22,642
Hester Mofet, <i>The rest of me.</i>

340
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:26,396
<i>Miss The Rest Of Me,</i> meaning that
you rented that garage?

341
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:03,808
Thank you.

342
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:06,436
Your bleeding has stopped.

343
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,023
How did you...

344
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,151
It's nothing.

345
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,278
It's just a scratch.

346
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:18,948
Dr. Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

347
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:22,202
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

348
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,287
Why, do you know something about him?

349
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:26,498
I might, if I saw the case file.

350
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:28,500
You could get that for me.

351
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,210
Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?

352
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:32,295
You wanted me to find him.

353
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,882
His real name is Benjamin Raspail.

354
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:38,176
A former patient of mine,

355
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:42,722
whose romantic attachments ran to,
shall we say, the exotic.

356
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,891
I did not kill him, I assure you.

357
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:47,685
Merely tucked him away very much
as I found him,

358
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,313
after he'd missed three appointments.

359
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,775
If you didn't kill him, then who did, sir?

360
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,151
Who can say?

361
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:56,903
Best thing for him, really.

362
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:59,197
His therapy was going nowhere.

363
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:02,742
His dress, uh, makeup...

364
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:05,203
Raspail was a transvestite?

365
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:07,664
In life? Oh, no.

366
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:10,083
Garden variety manic-depressive.

367
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,210
Tedious. Very tedious.

368
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:15,338
And I just think of him as
a kind of experiment,

369
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:18,842
a fledgling killer's first effort
at transformation.

370
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,761
How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice?

371
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:24,264
Scared at first, then,

372
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:26,641
exhilarated.

373
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:29,561
Jack Crawford is helping your career,
isn't he?

374
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:32,689
Apparently, he likes you,
and you like him, too.

375
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,024
I never thought about it.

376
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:38,236
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you sexually?

377
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:39,863
True, he is much older,

378
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:43,575
but do you think he visualizes
scenarios, exchanges,

379
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:45,034
fucking you?

380
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:49,289
That doesn't interest me, Doctor.

381
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:53,042
Frankly, it's...it's the sort of thing
that Miggs would say.

382
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:56,296
Not anymore.

383
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:05,638
Thank you, Barney.

384
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,895
What happened to your drawings?

385
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:15,565
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.

386
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:17,859
Just like that gospel program.

387
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:20,987
When you leave, they'll
turn the volume way up.

388
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:24,115
Dr. Chilton does enjoy
his petty torments.

389
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:27,785
What did you mean by transformation, Doctor?

390
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:39,672
I've been in this room for
eight years now, Clarice.

391
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:43,343
I know they will never, ever let me out
while I'm alive.

392
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:46,179
What I want is a view.

393
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:50,558
I want a window where I can see a tree,
or even water.

394
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:54,187
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr. Chilton.

395
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,814
What did you mean by fledgling killer?

396
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:59,192
Are you saying that he's killed again?

397
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:02,529
I'm offering you a psychological profile
on Buffalo Bill,

398
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:04,656
based on the case evidence.

399
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,497
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

400
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:21,381
You know who he is, don't you?

401
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:25,051
Tell me who decapitated your patient, Doctor.

402
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:27,845
All good things to those who wait.

403
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:29,681
I've waited, Clarice,

404
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:32,642
but how long can you and
old Jackie boy wait?

405
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,061
Our little Billy must already be searching

406
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:38,064
for that next special lady.

407
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:42,193
<i>After all it was a great big world</i>

408
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:46,155
<i>With lots of places to run to</i>

409
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:49,367
<i>Yeah, and if she had to die</i>

410
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:51,411
<i>Trying she</i>

411
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:55,582
<i>Had one little promise she was gonna keep</i>

412
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:57,792
<i>Oh, yes</i>

413
00:31:58,376 --> 00:31:59,877
<i>Alright</i>

414
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:01,963
<i>Take it easy, baby</i>

415
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,465
<i>Make it last all night</i>

416
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:08,636
<i>She was an American girl</i>

417
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:43,212
Hey, little cheeper.

418
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,640
I'll be right there.

419
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:55,600
Oh, shoot.

420
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:03,900
Goddamn it.

421
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:14,494
Perfect! Jesus.

422
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:22,126
Can I help you with that?

423
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,212
Would you?

424
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:25,421
Sure.

425
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,007
Thank you.
That's alright.

426
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:29,258
You look kind of handicapped.

427
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:30,468
Yeah.

428
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:31,886
I got it this far.

429
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,805
I just can't get it up in the truck.

430
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:35,431
Here. Just grab this.

431
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:36,974
Okay.

432
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:39,227
Good. Just set it down.
That's good.

433
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,770
Uh, get in the truck.

434
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:42,939
I want to push it all the way up.

435
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,942
I really appreciate this.
Thank you. Alright.

436
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:47,026
Yeah.

437
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,194
Thank you.

438
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,196
Just go all the way back.

439
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,865
Okay. Is this good?

440
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:54,450
Yeah, that's good.

441
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:57,370
That's great.

442
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:58,538
Okay.

443
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:01,124
Say, are you about a size 14?

444
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:02,667
Sorry?

445
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,189
Good.

446
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:47,211
Oh, good. Good.

447
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:04,353
Hold!

448
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:18,326
Starling!

449
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,538
Outside. Let's go.

450
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:26,626
Cindy, in the ring for Starling. Let's go!

451
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:36,886
FBI! Hold it! Hold it right there!

452
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,679
Saddle up. Pack your field gear.
You're moving out.

453
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:40,181
You're going with Crawford.
Where?

454
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:41,974
Found a girl's body down in West Virginia.

455
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:43,142
Been in the water about a week.

456
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:44,852
Looks like a Buffalo Bill-type situation.

457
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:58,491
He keeps them alive for three days.

458
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,034
We don't know why.

459
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:03,287
There's no evidence of rape or
physical abuse prior to death.

460
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:06,415
All the mutilation you see there
is postmortem.

461
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:08,417
Okay, three days.

462
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:12,171
Then he shoots them, skins them,
and dumps them.

463
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:14,257
Each body in a different river.

464
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,510
The water leaves us no trace evidence
of any kind.

465
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:20,221
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

466
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:23,307
Her body was the only one he took
the trouble to weight down,

467
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:26,102
so actually, she was the third girl found.

468
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:28,229
After her, he got lazy.

469
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:33,025
Okay. Let's see.

470
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:35,695
Circles where the girls were abducted,

471
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:38,030
arrows where their bodies were found.

472
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:41,284
This new one today washed up here.

473
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,994
Elk River, West Virginia.

474
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:04,849
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

475
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,894
Well, he's a white male.

476
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:09,061
Serial killers tend to hunt

477
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:10,771
within their own ethnic groups.

478
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:12,773
He's not a drifter.

479
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:16,402
He's got his own house somewhere,
not an apartment.

480
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:17,612
Why?

481
00:37:17,695 --> 00:37:19,864
What he does with them takes privacy.

482
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:22,283
He's in his 30s or 40s.

483
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:24,827
He's got real physical strength,

484
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:27,747
combined with an older man's,
uh, self-control.

485
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,207
He's cautious, precise.

486
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:33,753
And he's never impulsive.
He'll never stop.

487
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,379
Why not?

488
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,382
He's got a real taste for it now.

489
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:40,176
He's getting better at his work.

490
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:43,930
Not bad, Starling.

491
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:45,431
Questions?

492
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:46,641
Yes, sir.

493
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:48,976
You haven't mentioned anything

494
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,770
about the information contained
in my report

495
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:52,939
or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.

496
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:54,774
I'm considering it.

497
00:37:54,857 --> 00:37:57,818
That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?

498
00:37:57,902 --> 00:38:00,071
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

499
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,993
Well, if that was the case, then I just...

500
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:08,746
I just wish I was in on it. That's all.

501
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:11,290
If I had sent you in there
with an actual agenda,

502
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:13,250
Lecter would have known it instantly.

503
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:16,045
He would have toyed with you,
then turned to stone.

504
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:53,749
Excuse me. Sheriff Perkins,
these are the FBI people.

505
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:56,502
Sheriff Perkins. Jack Crawford, FBI.

506
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:59,422
Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling.

507
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,091
We appreciate being invited
to your jurisdiction.

508
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:05,469
I didn't call you. That was somebody
from the State Attorney's office.

509
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:07,680
We'll extend you every courtesy,
but right now...

510
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:12,184
Sheriff, this type of sex crime
has certain aspects

511
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:14,603
I'd just as soon discuss in private.

512
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:16,480
You know what I mean?

513
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:08,801
Oscar, fetch Dr. Akin from the chapel.

514
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:09,969
Yes, sir.

515
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:11,053
Starling, we're back here.

516
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:14,056
Tell Lamar to come on when he's finished
playing his music.

517
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,934
Yeah. We'll be sending in a minute.

518
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:18,894
Is this working?

519
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:21,647
I need a six-way linkup.

520
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,440
Chicago, Detroit...

521
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:24,900
What? What?

522
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:32,825
Excuse me! Excuse me, gentlemen.

523
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:35,161
You officers and gentlemen,
listen here now.

524
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:36,829
There's things we need to do for her.

525
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,747
I know that you all brought her this far

526
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:41,500
and that her folks would thank you
if they could

527
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:43,836
for your kindness and your sensitivity.

528
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:46,630
And now, please, go on now
and let us take care of her.

529
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:49,508
Go on, now.

530
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:53,929
Thank you.

531
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:59,018
Thank you.

532
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:02,062
Okay, good.

533
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:13,157
Yeah, that's right. West Virginia.
Elk River.

534
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,242
Stand by for transmission.

535
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:20,247
Ray.

536
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:35,429
Doctor, Lamar, let's take a look at her.

537
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:53,280
Oh, Jesus.

538
00:43:01,038 --> 00:43:02,623
Okay, Starling.

539
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,796
Bill.

540
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:29,316
Star-shaped contact entrance
wound over the, uh, sternum.

541
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:33,612
Uh, muzzle stamp at the top.

542
00:43:33,696 --> 00:43:34,989
Wrongful death.

543
00:43:35,072 --> 00:43:36,240
<i>Wrongful death.</i>

544
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:40,369
She'll have to go to the state pathologist
at Claxton.

545
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:42,746
Well, I better get back to that service.

546
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,581
Lamar will help you.

547
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:46,417
Lord Almighty.

548
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:53,215
What else do you see, Starling?

549
00:43:54,008 --> 00:43:56,552
Well, she's not local.

550
00:43:57,761 --> 00:44:00,889
Her ears are pierced three times,
and there's, uh...

551
00:44:02,141 --> 00:44:04,893
Glitter nail polish.
It looks like town to me.

552
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,609
Two of her fingernails are broken off,

553
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:16,238
and there's, uh, there's dirt
or grit under them.

554
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:19,408
It looks like she's tried to claw her way
through something.

555
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:21,952
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.

556
00:44:22,036 --> 00:44:23,370
We'll fax them through Missing Persons.

557
00:44:23,454 --> 00:44:24,621
Right.

558
00:44:34,423 --> 00:44:36,091
Let's do another.

559
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,852
She's got something in her throat.

560
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,730
When a body comes out of the water,

561
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:52,941
lots of times there's, like, leaves
and things in the mouth.

562
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:26,975
What is that, some kind of seedpod?

563
00:45:27,768 --> 00:45:30,187
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

564
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:33,690
There's no way that could get way down
in there like that.

565
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:36,151
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

566
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:41,323
She'll be easier to print
when we turn her over.

567
00:45:41,407 --> 00:45:42,825
Lamar, will you give me a hand with this?

568
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:44,493
Yes, sir, I Will.

569
00:45:48,497 --> 00:45:52,042
Oh, Jack. What do
you make of these?

570
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:54,586
Different configuration
than the other victims.

571
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:55,921
Get close-ups.

572
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:57,423
Victim's skin removed

573
00:45:57,506 --> 00:46:00,926
this time in two large diamond-shaped
sections above the buttocks.

574
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:04,680
Stellate exit wound level with the second
or the third thoracic vertebrae

575
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:07,224
<i>approximately six inches from
the right shoulder blade.</i>

576
00:46:07,307 --> 00:46:08,600
Starling?

577
00:46:09,977 --> 00:46:12,229
When I told that sheriff

578
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:13,605
we shouldn't talk in front of a woman,

579
00:46:13,689 --> 00:46:15,524
that really burned you, didn't it?

580
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,025
It was just smoke, Starling.

581
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:18,777
I had to get rid of him.

582
00:46:19,236 --> 00:46:20,988
It matters, Mr. Crawford.

583
00:46:21,071 --> 00:46:23,574
Cops look at you to see how to act.

584
00:46:23,657 --> 00:46:24,950
It matters.

585
00:46:25,242 --> 00:46:26,326
Point taken.

586
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:34,877
Ligature marks found around the wrists,

587
00:46:35,002 --> 00:46:36,628
<i>not around the ankles.</i>

588
00:46:36,712 --> 00:46:39,381
<i>This would indicate that the skinning
was postmortem.</i>

589
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,740
Time, Pilch.
My move.

590
00:47:04,823 --> 00:47:06,575
No fair. You lured him with produce.

591
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:08,911
Tough noogies.
Still my turn.

592
00:47:10,162 --> 00:47:11,955
Nice and slow, baby.

593
00:47:12,706 --> 00:47:15,584
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

594
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:19,421
Of course it counts.
How do you play?

595
00:47:20,756 --> 00:47:22,341
Agent Starling?

596
00:47:23,926 --> 00:47:25,844
Where the heck did this come from?

597
00:47:25,928 --> 00:47:27,638
It's practically mush.

598
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:29,973
It was found behind the soft palate
of a murder victim.

599
00:47:30,057 --> 00:47:32,309
The body was in the Elk River,
West Virginia.

600
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:33,727
It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?

601
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,562
I'm afraid I can't tell you
any more about that.

602
00:47:35,646 --> 00:47:36,946
We heard about it on the radio.

603
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:40,317
You mean this is like a clue from
a real murder case? Cool!

604
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,444
Just ignore him.
He's not a Ph.D.

605
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,448
A <i>Sphingid. Ceratomia, maybe.</i>

606
00:47:46,532 --> 00:47:48,450
Boy, he's a big sucker.

607
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,994
Okay.

608
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,038
Let's check morphology.

609
00:47:57,459 --> 00:48:00,128
Uh..huh.

610
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,550
What do you do when you're not detecting,
Agent Starling?

611
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:08,345
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

612
00:48:09,096 --> 00:48:11,515
You ever go out for cheeseburgers and beer?

613
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:14,560
The amusing house wine?

614
00:48:14,977 --> 00:48:16,937
Are you hitting on me, Doctor?

615
00:48:17,229 --> 00:48:18,564
Yes.

616
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:19,731
Got you.

617
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:20,857
What do you got, Roden?

618
00:48:20,941 --> 00:48:25,153
<i>Agent Starling, meet Mr. Acherontia styx.</i>

619
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:27,197
Weird.

620
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:30,492
Better known to his friends
as the Death's Head Moth.

621
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:32,035
And where does it come from?

622
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:33,287
That's what's strange.

623
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:35,080
They only live in Asia.
Asia?

624
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:36,297
In this country, they'd have to be

625
00:48:36,373 --> 00:48:38,041
specially raised from imported eggs.

626
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:41,628
Somebody grew this guy, fed him honey
and nightshade,

627
00:48:41,712 --> 00:48:43,255
kept him warm.

628
00:48:44,006 --> 00:48:45,757
Somebody loved him.

629
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,501
Where are you?

630
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:24,796
Let me out of here!

631
00:49:34,014 --> 00:49:35,932
Please don't leave!

632
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:40,604
Talk to me, please!

633
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:43,815
Why won't you answer me?
Please!

634
00:49:46,777 --> 00:49:48,654
<i>Good morning. I'm Donna Ferucchi.</i>

635
00:49:48,737 --> 00:49:50,238
<i>I'm Gene Cassel with sports.</i>

636
00:49:50,322 --> 00:49:51,740
<i>And I'm Tim Langhorn.</i>

637
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:53,408
<i>Our top story for this morning.</i>

638
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,993
<i>Catherine Martin,</i>

639
00:49:55,077 --> 00:49:57,788
<i>the 25-year-old daughter
of Senator Ruth Martin,</i>

640
00:49:57,871 --> 00:49:59,581
<i>listed first as a missing person,</i>

641
00:49:59,665 --> 00:50:01,333
<i>is now believed to have been kidnapped</i>

642
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:04,169
<i>by the serial killer known only
as Buffalo Bill.</i>

643
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:05,504
<i>Memphis police sources indicate</i>

644
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:06,838
<i>that the missing girl's blouse</i>

645
00:50:06,922 --> 00:50:08,882
<i>has been identified, sliced up the back</i>

646
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:10,759
<i>in what has become a kind of grim,</i>

647
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:12,594
<i>all-too-familiar calling card.</i>

648
00:50:12,678 --> 00:50:14,304
<i>Young Catherine Martin, as we've said,</i>

649
00:50:14,388 --> 00:50:16,640
<i>is the only daughter of U.S. Senator
Ruth Martin,</i>

650
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:18,975
<i>the Republican junior senator
from Tennessee.</i>

651
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:20,894
<i>And while her kidnapping is not,
at this point,</i>

652
00:50:20,977 --> 00:50:22,646
<i>considered to be politically motivated,</i>

653
00:50:22,729 --> 00:50:25,816
<i>nevertheless, it has stirred the government
to its highest levels.</i>

654
00:50:25,899 --> 00:50:28,819
<i>Reached for a comment on the ski slopes
of Stowe, Vermont,</i>

655
00:50:28,902 --> 00:50:30,946
<i>the president himself said to be,</i>

656
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:32,864
<i>and I quote, 'intensely concerned.'</i>

657
00:50:32,948 --> 00:50:34,449
<i>Just moments ago, Senator Martin</i>

658
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:37,452
<i>taped this dramatic personal plea.
Excuse me.</i>

659
00:50:37,536 --> 00:50:41,206
<i>I'm speaking now to the person
who is holding my daughter.</i>

660
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:45,293
<i>Catherine is very gentle and kind.</i>

661
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:48,630
<i>Talk to her, and you'll see.</i>

662
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:53,301
<i>You have the power.
You are in charge.</i>

663
00:50:56,555 --> 00:50:59,641
<i>I know you can feel love and compassion.</i>

664
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:04,646
<i>You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world</i>

665
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:08,233
<i>that you can be merciful as well as strong,</i>

666
00:51:08,859 --> 00:51:11,278
<i>that you're big enough to treat Catherine</i>

667
00:51:11,361 --> 00:51:13,739
<i>better than the world has treated you.</i>

668
00:51:14,281 --> 00:51:16,032
<i>You have that power.</i>

669
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:17,784
<i>Please.</i>

670
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,620
<i>My daughter is Catherine.</i>

671
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:21,705
Boy, that's smart.

672
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:22,914
<i>Release her unharmed.</i>

673
00:51:22,998 --> 00:51:24,458
Jesus, that's really smart.

674
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:26,752
She keeps repeating the name.

675
00:51:26,835 --> 00:51:30,255
If he sees Catherine as a person
and not just an object,

676
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:32,507
it's harder to tear her up.

677
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,760
<i>Please. Release my little girl.</i>

678
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:37,304
What you're doing, Miss Starling,

679
00:51:37,387 --> 00:51:39,598
is coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview

680
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:42,809
and refusing to share information with me
for the third time.

681
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:45,854
Sir, I told you,

682
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:48,106
this is just a routine follow-up
on the Raspail case.

683
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:50,317
He is my patient.
I have rights.

684
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,610
I understand that, sir.

685
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:55,864
Look, I am not just some turnkey,
Miss Starling.

686
00:51:57,115 --> 00:51:59,493
This is the number for the U.S. Attorney's
office.

687
00:51:59,576 --> 00:52:01,828
Please, either you discuss this with him,

688
00:52:01,912 --> 00:52:04,206
or you let me do my job.
Do you understand?

689
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:12,214
<i>If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill</i>

690
00:52:12,714 --> 00:52:15,175
in time to save Catherine Martin,

691
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:18,470
the senator promises you a transfer

692
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:21,515
to the V.A. Hospital at Oneida Park,
New York,

693
00:52:21,598 --> 00:52:22,933
with a view of the woods nearby.

694
00:52:23,016 --> 00:52:25,727
Maximum security still applies, of course.

695
00:52:25,936 --> 00:52:28,605
You'd have reasonable access to books.

696
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:31,233
Best of all, though.

697
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:33,318
One week of the year,

698
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:37,489
you get to leave the hospital and go here.

699
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:42,410
Plum Island.

700
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:46,998
Every day of that week you may walk
on the beach,

701
00:52:47,082 --> 00:52:49,668
you may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour,

702
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:53,171
under SWAT team surveillance, of course.

703
00:52:53,797 --> 00:52:55,674
And there you have it.

704
00:52:58,301 --> 00:53:01,930
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

705
00:53:03,515 --> 00:53:05,767
A copy of the senator's offer.

706
00:53:06,101 --> 00:53:09,396
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

707
00:53:10,105 --> 00:53:11,940
If Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

708
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:26,162
<i>Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center.</i>

709
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:30,959
Sounds charming.

710
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:32,878
That's only part of the island.

711
00:53:32,961 --> 00:53:35,463
There's a very, very nice beach.

712
00:53:35,547 --> 00:53:38,008
Terns nest there. There's beautiful...

713
00:53:38,091 --> 00:53:40,093
Terns? Hmm.

714
00:53:41,136 --> 00:53:44,264
If I help you, Clarice, it will
be <i>turns</i> with us, too.

715
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:45,390
Quid pro quo.

716
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:47,475
I tell you things, you tell me things.

717
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:50,478
Not about this case, though.
About yourself.

718
00:53:50,562 --> 00:53:53,231
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

719
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:57,611
Yes or no, Clarice?

720
00:53:57,694 --> 00:53:59,487
Poor little Catherine is waiting.

721
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:02,032
Go, Doctor.

722
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:05,994
What is your worst memory of childhood?

723
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:09,456
The death of my father.

724
00:54:10,457 --> 00:54:13,543
Tell me about it. And
don't lie, or I'll know.

725
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:16,546
He was a town marshal,

726
00:54:17,881 --> 00:54:21,301
and one night he surprised two burglars

727
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:24,054
coming out of the back of a drugstore.

728
00:54:25,013 --> 00:54:26,139
They shot him.

729
00:54:27,057 --> 00:54:29,017
Was he killed outright?

730
00:54:29,476 --> 00:54:31,978
No. He was very strong.

731
00:54:32,062 --> 00:54:33,855
He lasted more than a month.

732
00:54:34,856 --> 00:54:37,484
My mother died when I was very young,

733
00:54:39,152 --> 00:54:41,404
so my father had become
the whole world to me,

734
00:54:41,488 --> 00:54:43,990
and when he left me, I had nothing.

735
00:54:44,074 --> 00:54:45,825
I was ten years old.

736
00:54:46,826 --> 00:54:48,954
You're very frank, Clarice.

737
00:54:49,746 --> 00:54:53,750
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

738
00:54:56,544 --> 00:54:58,254
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

739
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:01,633
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.

740
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:03,718
Was she a large girl?

741
00:55:06,513 --> 00:55:07,639
Yes.

742
00:55:07,722 --> 00:55:10,266
Big through the hips? Roomy?

743
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,060
They all were.

744
00:55:12,227 --> 00:55:13,478
What else?

745
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:17,357
She had an object deliberately inserted
into her throat.

746
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:20,360
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.

747
00:55:20,443 --> 00:55:22,487
We don't know what it means.

748
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:24,155
Was it a butterfly?

749
00:55:25,448 --> 00:55:27,409
Yes. A moth.

750
00:55:28,618 --> 00:55:32,747
Just like the one we found in Benjamin
Raspail's head an hour ago.

751
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:36,543
Why does he place them there, Doctor?

752
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:40,672
The significance of the moth is change.

753
00:55:41,423 --> 00:55:44,342
Caterpillar into chrysalis or pupa,

754
00:55:45,051 --> 00:55:47,095
and from thence into beauty.

755
00:55:48,013 --> 00:55:50,348
Our Billy wants to change, too.

756
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,309
There's no correlation in literature

757
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:55,020
between transsexualism and violence.

758
00:55:55,103 --> 00:55:56,688
Transsexuals are very passive...

759
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:58,356
Clever girl.

760
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,316
You're so close to the way
you're gonna catch him.

761
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,776
Do you realize that?

762
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:03,486
No. Tell me why.

763
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:06,906
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

764
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:08,450
What happened next?

765
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:16,458
I don't imagine the answer is on those
second-rate shoes, Clarice.

766
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:20,837
I went to live with my mother's cousin
and her husband in Montana.

767
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,589
They had a ranch.

768
00:56:22,881 --> 00:56:24,549
Was it a cattle ranch?

769
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:26,009
Sheep and horses.

770
00:56:26,843 --> 00:56:28,470
How long did you live there?

771
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:30,638
Two months.

772
00:56:30,722 --> 00:56:32,057
Why so briefly?

773
00:56:32,432 --> 00:56:33,683
I ran away.

774
00:56:33,975 --> 00:56:35,727
Why, Clarice?

775
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:38,063
Did the rancher make you perform fellatio?

776
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:40,190
Did he sodomize you?

777
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:43,735
No. He was a very decent man.

778
00:56:45,612 --> 00:56:47,447
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

779
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:52,035
Billy is not a real transsexual.

780
00:56:52,118 --> 00:56:54,287
But he thinks he is.
He tries to be.

781
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,623
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

782
00:56:57,499 --> 00:56:58,750
And you said that I was very close

783
00:56:58,833 --> 00:56:59,959
to the way we would catch him.

784
00:57:00,043 --> 00:57:01,419
What did you mean, Doctor?

785
00:57:01,503 --> 00:57:04,089
There are three major centers
for transsexual surgery.

786
00:57:04,172 --> 00:57:08,635
Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota,
and Columbus Medical Center.

787
00:57:08,718 --> 00:57:12,013
I wouldn't be surprised if Billy had applied
for sex reassignment

788
00:57:12,097 --> 00:57:15,016
at one or all of them and been rejected.

789
00:57:16,142 --> 00:57:17,977
On what basis would they reject him?

790
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:21,564
<i>Look for severe childhood disturbances</i>

791
00:57:21,648 --> 00:57:23,650
<i>associated with violence.</i>

792
00:57:23,733 --> 00:57:26,736
<i>Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.</i>

793
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:30,365
<i>He was made one through years
of systematic abuse.</i>

794
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:34,619
<i>Billy hates his own identity, you see,</i>

795
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:37,455
<i>and he thinks that makes him a transsexual.</i>

796
00:57:37,539 --> 00:57:41,459
<i>But his pathology is a thousand times
more savage</i>

797
00:57:41,543 --> 00:57:43,378
<i>and more terrifying.</i>

798
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:48,967
It rubs the lotion on its skin.

799
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:51,219
It does this whenever it's told.

800
00:57:51,886 --> 00:57:53,805
Mister, my family will pay cash.

801
00:57:53,888 --> 00:57:56,850
Whatever ransom you're asking for,
they'll pay it.

802
00:57:57,684 --> 00:57:59,894
It rubs the lotion on its skin,

803
00:57:59,978 --> 00:58:02,147
or else it gets the hose again.

804
00:58:04,357 --> 00:58:06,943
Yes, she will, Precious.
She will get the hose.

805
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:09,946
Okay, okay, okay.

806
00:58:11,406 --> 00:58:13,449
Okay. I'm there.

807
00:58:13,575 --> 00:58:14,742
Okay.

808
00:58:16,244 --> 00:58:18,413
Mister, if you let me go,

809
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:20,165
I won't...I won't press charges.

810
00:58:20,248 --> 00:58:21,624
I promise.

811
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:25,128
See, my mom is a real important woman.

812
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:27,422
I guess you already know that.

813
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:30,216
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

814
00:58:30,884 --> 00:58:34,762
Please! Please! I want to go home.

815
00:58:35,263 --> 00:58:39,058
I want to go home, please!
Please, I want to...

816
00:58:39,142 --> 00:58:41,686
It places the lotion in the basket.

817
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:46,316
I want to see my mommy!
Please.

818
00:58:47,025 --> 00:58:49,986
I want to see my mother again.

819
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:53,281
I want to...I want
to see my mommy.

820
00:58:54,449 --> 00:58:56,951
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

821
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,030
You still think you're gonna walk

822
00:59:34,113 --> 00:59:35,865
on some beach and see the birdies?

823
00:59:35,949 --> 00:59:38,326
No, I don't think so.

824
00:59:39,786 --> 00:59:42,330
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

825
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:45,041
She never heard of any deal with you.

826
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:47,961
They scammed you, Hannibal.

827
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:51,422
Stand outside

828
00:59:52,674 --> 00:59:54,384
and shut the door.

829
00:59:54,634 --> 00:59:55,843
Barney.

830
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:06,145
There never was a deal with Senator Martin,
but there is now.

831
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:07,981
I designed it.

832
01:00:08,064 --> 01:00:11,818
Of course, I worked in a few conditions
for my own benefit as well.

833
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:15,196
Identify Buffalo Bill by name

834
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,115
and if the girl is found in time,

835
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:19,033
Senator Martin will have you transferred

836
01:00:19,117 --> 01:00:21,244
to Brushy Mountain State Prison
in Tennessee.

837
01:00:22,787 --> 01:00:24,580
Answer me, Hannibal.

838
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:28,376
You answer me now,

839
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:30,712
or by God, you'll never leave this cell.

840
01:00:33,298 --> 01:00:35,091
Who is Buffalo Bill?

841
01:00:36,384 --> 01:00:38,386
His first name is Louis.

842
01:00:39,012 --> 01:00:42,473
I'll tell the rest to the Senator herself,
but only in Tennessee,

843
01:00:42,557 --> 01:00:45,226
and I have a few conditions of my own.

844
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:50,189
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

845
01:00:51,065 --> 01:00:54,152
<i>Jack, Hannibal Lecter is being transferred
to Memphis.</i>

846
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:55,820
Transferred?

847
01:00:55,903 --> 01:00:57,780
Did you have a trainee make some sort of

848
01:00:57,864 --> 01:01:00,533
phony offer to Lecter in the Senator's name?

849
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:02,410
Yeah. I rolled the dice. I had to.

850
01:01:02,618 --> 01:01:04,871
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.

851
01:01:04,954 --> 01:01:06,956
Paul Krendler's over here from Justice.

852
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,417
She's asking him to take over in Memphis.

853
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:36,277
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.

854
01:01:36,361 --> 01:01:37,737
I'm Lieutenant Boyle.

855
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,155
This is Sergeant Patrick.

856
01:01:39,238 --> 01:01:41,366
Now, we're gonna treat you
as good as you treat us.

857
01:01:41,449 --> 01:01:44,452
You be a gentleman, you gonna
get three hots and a cot.

858
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:47,330
Sir. If you sign right here,

859
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:49,165
we'll have us a legal transfer.

860
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:53,711
Where is it?

861
01:01:54,962 --> 01:01:56,756
Here, sir. Use mine.

862
01:02:43,845 --> 01:02:47,723
Senator Martin, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

863
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,397
Dr. Lecter,

864
01:02:55,064 --> 01:02:58,401
I brought an affidavit guaranteeing
your new rights.

865
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,028
You'll want to read it before I sign.

866
01:03:04,907 --> 01:03:06,909
I won't waste your time or Catherine's time

867
01:03:06,993 --> 01:03:08,953
bargaining for petty privileges.

868
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:11,456
Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford

869
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:13,666
have wasted far too much time already.

870
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:16,794
I only pray they haven't doomed
the poor girl.

871
01:03:17,879 --> 01:03:21,632
Let me help you now and I will trust you
when it is all over.

872
01:03:21,716 --> 01:03:23,634
You have my word. Paul?

873
01:03:26,179 --> 01:03:29,015
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

874
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:31,309
I met him just once.

875
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:34,312
He was referred to me
in April or May, 1980,

876
01:03:34,395 --> 01:03:36,731
by my patient Benjamin Raspail.

877
01:03:37,315 --> 01:03:39,066
They were lovers, you see.

878
01:03:39,525 --> 01:03:42,945
But Raspail had become very frightened.

879
01:03:43,738 --> 01:03:46,949
Apparently, Louis had murdered a transient

880
01:03:47,408 --> 01:03:50,495
and done things with her skin.

881
01:03:51,537 --> 01:03:54,624
We need his address and
a physical description.

882
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:57,376
Tell me, Senator.

883
01:03:57,919 --> 01:04:00,379
Did you nurse Catherine yourself?

884
01:04:00,546 --> 01:04:01,631
What?

885
01:04:01,714 --> 01:04:03,216
Did you breast-feed her?

886
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:04,509
Now, wait a minute!

887
01:04:04,592 --> 01:04:05,968
Yes, I did.

888
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:08,179
Toughened your nipples, didn't it?

889
01:04:08,262 --> 01:04:10,056
You son of a bitch!

890
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:13,726
Amputate a man's leg, and
he can still feel it tickling.

891
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:17,605
Tell me, Mom, when your little girl
is on the slab,

892
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:19,690
where will it tickle you?

893
01:04:19,774 --> 01:04:22,735
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

894
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:27,365
Five-foot-ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds.

895
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:29,659
Hair, blond. Eyes, pale blue.

896
01:04:30,243 --> 01:04:31,536
He'd be about 35 now.

897
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:34,664
He said he lived in Philadelphia,
but may have lied.

898
01:04:34,747 --> 01:04:36,707
That's all I can remember, Mom.

899
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:39,335
But if I think of any more,
I will let you know.

900
01:04:41,963 --> 01:04:44,423
Oh, and, Senator, just one more thing.

901
01:04:46,759 --> 01:04:48,302
Love your suit.

902
01:04:50,555 --> 01:04:52,723
I tell you now that in a meeting
earlier this evening

903
01:04:52,807 --> 01:04:54,058
with Senator Ruth Martin,

904
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:57,186
Dr. Lecter agreed to assist
in the investigation

905
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:58,646
of trying to find the abductor

906
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:00,064
of Catherine Martin, Buffalo Bill.

907
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:01,190
How do you fit in, sir?

908
01:05:01,274 --> 01:05:02,775
Well, it's only through my own unique insight

909
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:04,902
into Lecter's mind that this breakthrough
was possible.

910
01:05:04,986 --> 01:05:06,070
And Buffalo Bill's real name...

911
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:08,823
Buffalo Bill's real name is now
a matter of record

912
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:10,032
with the proper authorities.

913
01:05:10,116 --> 01:05:11,409
Can you give us any more information?

914
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:12,702
My name is Dr. Frederick Chilton.

915
01:05:12,785 --> 01:05:14,287
How do you spell that?
C-H...

916
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:18,124
Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?

917
01:05:18,207 --> 01:05:20,459
Oh, well, I just saw him outside, sir.

918
01:05:20,835 --> 01:05:22,587
Access to Lecter is strictly limited.

919
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:24,255
We've been getting death threats.

920
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:26,007
I understand, sir.

921
01:05:32,138 --> 01:05:34,181
Log in. Check your weapon.

922
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:37,393
Well, I can't take all the credit
for myself.

923
01:05:37,476 --> 01:05:40,021
Senator Martin, the Justice Department,
the people at the FBI,

924
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:42,273
the folks at the Baltimore State Hospital.

925
01:05:42,356 --> 01:05:45,192
And now for the hard part,
apprehending the suspect.

926
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:48,404
Excuse me, folks, I'm gonna
have to catch a flight.

927
01:05:52,408 --> 01:05:54,660
Command desk.
Officer Jacobs.

928
01:06:03,336 --> 01:06:05,296
Is it true what they're saying?

929
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:06,797
Huh?

930
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:09,425
He's some kind of vampire?

931
01:06:11,761 --> 01:06:13,471
They don't have a name for what he is.

932
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:17,058
You do know the rules, ma'am?

933
01:06:17,475 --> 01:06:20,061
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle. I've
questioned him before.

934
01:06:23,439 --> 01:06:24,732
Go ahead.

935
01:07:01,727 --> 01:07:03,604
Good evening, Clarice.

936
01:07:05,189 --> 01:07:08,109
I thought you might like your
drawings back, Doctor.

937
01:07:10,778 --> 01:07:12,613
Just until you get your view.

938
01:07:13,447 --> 01:07:15,241
How very thoughtful.

939
01:07:16,575 --> 01:07:19,662
Or did Jack Crawford send you
for one last wheedle

940
01:07:19,745 --> 01:07:21,956
before you're both booted off the case?

941
01:07:22,373 --> 01:07:24,709
No. I came because I wanted to.

942
01:07:29,296 --> 01:07:31,590
People will say we're in love.

943
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:37,972
Anthrax Island.

944
01:07:38,556 --> 01:07:41,475
That was an especially nice touch, Clarice.

945
01:07:41,809 --> 01:07:43,102
Yours?

946
01:07:43,394 --> 01:07:44,478
Yes.

947
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:48,023
Yeah! That was good.

948
01:07:48,983 --> 01:07:50,818
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

949
01:07:50,943 --> 01:07:53,404
Tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock.

950
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:55,990
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.

951
01:07:56,866 --> 01:07:58,367
Louis Friend?

952
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:02,204
Iron sulfide, also known as Fool's Gold.

953
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:03,581
Oh, Clarice.

954
01:08:03,664 --> 01:08:06,500
Your problem is you need to
get more fun out of life.

955
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:10,045
You were telling me the truth
back in Baltimore, sir.

956
01:08:10,129 --> 01:08:11,922
Please continue now.

957
01:08:12,214 --> 01:08:15,092
Well, I have read the case files, have you?

958
01:08:15,176 --> 01:08:16,427
Everything you need to find him

959
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:18,262
is right there in those pages.

960
01:08:18,345 --> 01:08:19,430
Then tell me how.

961
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:23,184
First principles, Clarice.
Simplicity.

962
01:08:23,392 --> 01:08:24,894
Read Marcus Aurelius.

963
01:08:24,977 --> 01:08:28,272
Of each particular thing,
ask what is it in itself?

964
01:08:28,606 --> 01:08:30,107
What is its nature?

965
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:34,570
What does he do, this man you seek?

966
01:08:36,197 --> 01:08:37,698
He kills women.

967
01:08:37,782 --> 01:08:40,534
No! That is incidental.

968
01:08:41,494 --> 01:08:43,287
What is the first and principal thing
he does?

969
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:46,665
What needs does he serve by killing?

970
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:48,417
Anger.

971
01:08:48,501 --> 01:08:52,296
Um, social acceptance

972
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:54,465
and, uh, sexual frustrations...

973
01:08:54,548 --> 01:08:57,468
No! He covets.

974
01:08:58,844 --> 01:09:00,596
That is his nature.

975
01:09:00,971 --> 01:09:03,599
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

976
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:06,477
Do we seek out things to covet?

977
01:09:07,186 --> 01:09:09,230
Make an effort to answer now.

978
01:09:09,313 --> 01:09:11,565
No. We just...

979
01:09:12,024 --> 01:09:15,486
No. We begin by coveting
what we see every day.

980
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:18,864
Don't you feel eyes moving
over your body, Clarice?

981
01:09:19,615 --> 01:09:22,827
And don't your eyes seek out
the things you want?

982
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:26,455
Alright. Yes. Now please tell me how.

983
01:09:26,539 --> 01:09:30,501
No. it is your turn
to tell me, Clarice.

984
01:09:30,584 --> 01:09:33,045
You don't have any more vacations to sell.

985
01:09:33,754 --> 01:09:36,006
Why did you leave that ranch?

986
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:40,261
Doctor, we don't have any more time
for any of this now.

987
01:09:40,678 --> 01:09:43,347
But we don't reckon time the same way,
do we, Clarice?

988
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:45,349
This is all the time you'll ever have.

989
01:09:45,432 --> 01:09:47,852
Later. Now, please, listen to me.
We've only got five...

990
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:51,105
No! I will listen now.

991
01:09:53,524 --> 01:09:55,359
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

992
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:56,694
You were ten years old.

993
01:09:56,777 --> 01:10:00,531
You went to live with cousins on a
sheep and horse ranch in Montana.

994
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:01,740
And?

995
01:10:03,868 --> 01:10:06,036
And one morning, I just ran away.

996
01:10:06,829 --> 01:10:09,915
Not <i>just</i>, Clarice.
What set you off?

997
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:12,209
You started at what time?

998
01:10:12,835 --> 01:10:14,295
Early. Still dark.

999
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:15,838
Then something woke you, didn't it?

1000
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:18,382
Was it a dream? What was it?

1001
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:21,468
I heard a strange noise.

1002
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:24,179
What was it?

1003
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:28,183
It was screaming.

1004
01:10:30,311 --> 01:10:33,272
Some kind of screaming,
like a child's voice.

1005
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,107
What did you do?

1006
01:10:35,608 --> 01:10:39,153
I went downstairs, outside.

1007
01:10:41,989 --> 01:10:43,991
I crept up into the barn.

1008
01:10:44,658 --> 01:10:47,661
I was so scared to look inside,
but I had to.

1009
01:10:48,871 --> 01:10:50,748
And what did you see, Clarice?

1010
01:10:50,831 --> 01:10:52,333
What did you see?

1011
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:57,338
Lambs. They were screaming.

1012
01:10:58,547 --> 01:11:01,342
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

1013
01:11:01,634 --> 01:11:03,636
And they were screaming.

1014
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:06,639
And you ran away?

1015
01:11:06,722 --> 01:11:07,932
No.

1016
01:11:08,557 --> 01:11:10,684
First I tried to free them.
I...

1017
01:11:11,226 --> 01:11:13,687
I opened the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.

1018
01:11:13,771 --> 01:11:15,981
They just stood there, confused.

1019
01:11:16,065 --> 01:11:17,399
They wouldn't run.

1020
01:11:17,483 --> 01:11:20,152
But you could and you did, didn't you?

1021
01:11:20,861 --> 01:11:24,323
Yes. I took one lamb, and I
ran away as fast as I could.

1022
01:11:24,406 --> 01:11:25,699
Where were you going, Clarice?

1023
01:11:25,783 --> 01:11:26,992
I don't know.

1024
01:11:27,076 --> 01:11:29,912
I didn't have any food, any water,

1025
01:11:29,995 --> 01:11:32,539
and it was very cold, very cold.

1026
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:36,585
I thought...

1027
01:11:36,669 --> 01:11:39,213
I thought if I could save just one, but,

1028
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:42,716
he was so heavy.

1029
01:11:43,842 --> 01:11:45,469
He was so heavy.

1030
01:11:50,599 --> 01:11:52,434
I didn't get more than a few miles

1031
01:11:52,518 --> 01:11:54,645
when the sheriff's car picked me up.

1032
01:11:57,731 --> 01:11:58,983
The rancher was so angry,

1033
01:11:59,066 --> 01:12:02,569
he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage
in Bozeman.

1034
01:12:02,653 --> 01:12:04,571
I never saw the ranch again.

1035
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:08,033
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

1036
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:11,745
They killed him.

1037
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:14,206
You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

1038
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:18,877
Wake up in the dark and hear
the screaming of the lambs.

1039
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,046
Yes.

1040
01:12:22,756 --> 01:12:25,467
And you think if you save poor Catherine,

1041
01:12:25,551 --> 01:12:27,136
you could make them stop, don't you?

1042
01:12:27,219 --> 01:12:29,513
You think if Catherine lives,

1043
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:32,766
you won't wake up in the dark ever again

1044
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:35,769
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

1045
01:12:36,979 --> 01:12:39,940
I don't know. I don't know.

1046
01:12:42,026 --> 01:12:45,654
Thank you, Clarice.
Thank you.

1047
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:48,657
Tell me his name, Doctor.

1048
01:12:55,539 --> 01:12:57,458
Dr. Chilton, I presume.

1049
01:12:58,417 --> 01:13:00,586
I think you know each other.

1050
01:13:02,129 --> 01:13:03,422
Okay.

1051
01:13:04,214 --> 01:13:05,382
We found her.

1052
01:13:05,466 --> 01:13:06,592
Let's go!

1053
01:13:06,675 --> 01:13:08,552
It's your turn, Doctor.

1054
01:13:08,635 --> 01:13:09,720
Out.

1055
01:13:09,803 --> 01:13:10,846
Tell me his name.

1056
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:12,139
Sorry, ma'am, I've got orders.

1057
01:13:12,222 --> 01:13:13,599
I have to put you on a plane.

1058
01:13:13,682 --> 01:13:15,059
Come on now.

1059
01:13:15,142 --> 01:13:16,685
Brave Clarice.

1060
01:13:17,352 --> 01:13:21,148
You will let me know when those lambs
stop screaming, won't you?

1061
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:23,233
Tell me his name, Doctor!

1062
01:13:23,317 --> 01:13:24,568
Clarice!

1063
01:13:25,903 --> 01:13:27,905
Your case file.

1064
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:34,369
Goodbye, Clarice.

1065
01:14:40,352 --> 01:14:42,521
Ready when you are, Doc.

1066
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:44,773
Just another minute, please.

1067
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:55,909
The son of a bitch demanded a second dinner.

1068
01:14:55,993 --> 01:14:57,995
Lamb chops, extra rare.

1069
01:14:58,078 --> 01:15:00,038
Wonder what he wants for breakfast.

1070
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:02,583
Some damn thing from the zoo?

1071
01:15:24,188 --> 01:15:25,981
Good evening, gentlemen.

1072
01:15:26,064 --> 01:15:28,192
Okay, Doc. Grab some floor.

1073
01:15:28,275 --> 01:15:29,610
Same drill as before, please.

1074
01:15:29,693 --> 01:15:30,694
Mmm..hmm.

1075
01:15:37,159 --> 01:15:39,453
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

1076
01:15:55,928 --> 01:15:57,054
Okay.

1077
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:05,395
Hand me that, would you?

1078
01:16:11,151 --> 01:16:12,319
Thanks.

1079
01:16:16,156 --> 01:16:18,242
Mind the drawings, please.

1080
01:16:21,328 --> 01:16:22,663
Thank you.

1081
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:49,356
Jimmy, watch it!
He's got me!

1082
01:16:56,321 --> 01:16:57,823
Jesus Christ!

1083
01:18:16,443 --> 01:18:18,653
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

1084
01:18:28,288 --> 01:18:29,956
What is this shit?

1085
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:34,586
Did somebody go up on five?

1086
01:18:34,669 --> 01:18:36,588
No. Nobody went up.

1087
01:18:36,671 --> 01:18:37,881
Call Pembry. Ask him...

1088
01:18:41,343 --> 01:18:44,096
<i>GP, shots fired on five.
Repeat.</i>

1089
01:18:44,471 --> 01:18:45,639
Shots fired on five.

1090
01:18:45,722 --> 01:18:46,932
Sergeant Tate.

1091
01:18:49,768 --> 01:18:51,061
Holy shit.

1092
01:18:51,144 --> 01:18:52,979
What the hell? Bitch!

1093
01:18:53,522 --> 01:18:54,773
Shut up.

1094
01:18:55,065 --> 01:18:56,274
Bobby, get the vest.

1095
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,609
Right, Sarge.

1096
01:18:57,984 --> 01:18:58,985
Brady, Howard...

1097
01:18:59,069 --> 01:19:00,487
Look!

1098
01:19:03,281 --> 01:19:04,491
It stopped.

1099
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:07,869
Seal off a 10 block radius.

1100
01:19:07,953 --> 01:19:10,747
Get me the SWAT team and
an ambulance double-quick.

1101
01:19:10,831 --> 01:19:12,040
We're going up.

1102
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:42,779
Pembry!

1103
01:19:44,281 --> 01:19:46,032
Boyle!

1104
01:19:58,670 --> 01:19:59,880
Oh, God!

1105
01:20:07,179 --> 01:20:08,221
Go.

1106
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:17,481
Clear!
Clear!

1107
01:20:17,564 --> 01:20:20,442
Command post, two officers down.

1108
01:20:20,525 --> 01:20:21,526
Clear!

1109
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:22,777
Clear!

1110
01:20:23,153 --> 01:20:24,488
Lecter's gone, Sarge.

1111
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:26,406
The prisoner is missing.

1112
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:28,408
Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.

1113
01:20:28,492 --> 01:20:31,077
Repeat. Lecter is missing and armed.

1114
01:20:31,161 --> 01:20:32,621
He stripped the bed.

1115
01:20:32,746 --> 01:20:34,206
Might be making a rope.

1116
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:35,957
Check all windows.

1117
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:38,418
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

1118
01:20:39,085 --> 01:20:40,462
He's alive.

1119
01:20:41,171 --> 01:20:43,256
Sergeant Tate, he's alive!

1120
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:45,509
Get a hold of him where you
can feel his hands, son.

1121
01:20:45,592 --> 01:20:47,093
Talk to him.

1122
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:48,637
What do I say?

1123
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:51,515
It's Jim Pembry! Now talk to him, damn it!

1124
01:20:52,516 --> 01:20:54,976
Lecter is missing and armed.

1125
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:57,062
Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me?

1126
01:20:57,145 --> 01:20:58,605
He took Boyle's gun.

1127
01:20:58,730 --> 01:21:00,148
Pembry got off one round.

1128
01:21:00,232 --> 01:21:02,192
There's a chance Lecter was hit.

1129
01:21:02,275 --> 01:21:04,402
Keep breathing in and out.
That's it.

1130
01:21:04,486 --> 01:21:06,071
You're doing a good job.

1131
01:21:06,154 --> 01:21:07,739
You look real good there.

1132
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:11,284
Yeah, you look...you look real good.

1133
01:21:28,593 --> 01:21:29,719
You ready?
Let's go.

1134
01:21:29,803 --> 01:21:30,804
Let's do it.

1135
01:21:30,887 --> 01:21:31,972
Let's go.

1136
01:21:42,774 --> 01:21:44,943
Looking good, Pembry.
You're gonna make it.

1137
01:21:45,026 --> 01:21:47,112
You're just fine. You're doing alright.
That's right.

1138
01:21:47,195 --> 01:21:48,321
Okay, I need that IV now.

1139
01:21:48,488 --> 01:21:49,614
Lactated ringers.

1140
01:21:49,698 --> 01:21:50,949
Can we get the strap?

1141
01:21:51,032 --> 01:21:52,075
Where's the fucking oxygen?

1142
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:53,868
Looking good, buddy. That's right.
Bob!

1143
01:21:53,952 --> 01:21:55,787
Stay with me. Stay with me here.

1144
01:21:57,455 --> 01:21:59,666
We're losing him. Downstairs. Take him!

1145
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,668
And up!

1146
01:22:03,253 --> 01:22:04,379
Elevator! Out of the way!

1147
01:22:04,462 --> 01:22:06,006
Out of the way!

1148
01:22:10,802 --> 01:22:12,178
<i>OP to Tate.</i>

1149
01:22:12,846 --> 01:22:14,764
Roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.

1150
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:18,018
I'm on the elevator bringing Pembry down.

1151
01:22:18,852 --> 01:22:20,895
He seems to be hanging on.

1152
01:22:21,521 --> 01:22:23,523
Top three floors secured.

1153
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:26,067
Main stairwell secured.

1154
01:22:27,152 --> 01:22:28,945
We think he's on two.

1155
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:44,377
<i>Tate, are you still with me?</i>

1156
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:48,757
We're pretty sure he's somewhere on two, sir.

1157
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,675
That's all for now. Over.

1158
01:23:10,278 --> 01:23:12,614
He's on the roof of the elevator.

1159
01:23:15,492 --> 01:23:16,910
Okay, guys...

1160
01:23:33,468 --> 01:23:34,803
I see him.

1161
01:23:34,886 --> 01:23:37,472
There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.

1162
01:23:38,139 --> 01:23:40,016
One warning. We need him alive.

1163
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:41,226
<i>Got him.</i>

1164
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:43,269
Lecter.

1165
01:23:43,645 --> 01:23:45,230
<i>Put your hands on your head.</i>

1166
01:23:47,941 --> 01:23:48,983
One in the leg.

1167
01:24:00,453 --> 01:24:01,871
No movement.

1168
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:05,709
Johnny, hold your fire. We're coming
into the car.

1169
01:24:06,376 --> 01:24:07,961
We're opening the hatch.

1170
01:24:08,503 --> 01:24:09,879
Watch his hands.

1171
01:24:09,963 --> 01:24:13,049
If there's any fire, it'll
come from us. Affirm.

1172
01:24:13,133 --> 01:24:14,342
<i>Got it.</i>

1173
01:24:40,326 --> 01:24:42,412
Memphis General, this is Medical Unit 26.

1174
01:24:42,495 --> 01:24:45,081
We're inbound with a 50-year-old
male police officer

1175
01:24:45,165 --> 01:24:47,584
with severe facial lacerations.
Weapon unknown.

1176
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:50,628
We've got grand mal seizure activity,
but he's postictal now.

1177
01:24:50,712 --> 01:24:51,755
<i>Copy that.</i>

1178
01:24:51,838 --> 01:24:53,256
Vital signs are good.

1179
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:54,758
Pressure is 130 over 90.

1180
01:24:54,841 --> 01:24:56,301
90?
Yeah, that's right. 90.

1181
01:24:56,384 --> 01:24:57,677
Pulse, 84.

1182
01:24:57,761 --> 01:24:59,429
We've got him on lactated ringers running.

1183
01:24:59,512 --> 01:25:02,056
And the patient is on 10 liters...

1184
01:25:09,022 --> 01:25:10,190
They found the ambulance

1185
01:25:10,273 --> 01:25:12,525
in a parking garage at Memphis Airport.

1186
01:25:12,609 --> 01:25:14,110
The crew was dead.

1187
01:25:15,195 --> 01:25:16,863
He killed a tourist, too.

1188
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:18,698
Got his clothes, cash.

1189
01:25:19,324 --> 01:25:21,159
By now he could be anywhere.

1190
01:25:21,242 --> 01:25:22,285
He won't come after me.

1191
01:25:22,368 --> 01:25:23,328
Oh, really?

1192
01:25:23,411 --> 01:25:25,872
No, he won't. I can't explain it.

1193
01:25:25,955 --> 01:25:28,583
He...he would consider that rude.

1194
01:25:29,793 --> 01:25:31,669
It's over. She's dead.

1195
01:25:31,878 --> 01:25:33,797
It's not your fault it worked out like this.

1196
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:36,174
The thing is that, Lecter said everything
we need to catch him with

1197
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:38,301
is right here in these pages, only I can't...

1198
01:25:38,384 --> 01:25:40,762
Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.

1199
01:25:40,929 --> 01:25:42,222
He's here, Ardelia.

1200
01:26:11,918 --> 01:26:13,545
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

1201
01:26:15,755 --> 01:26:18,424
<i>Clarice, doesn't this random
scattering of sites</i>

1202
01:26:18,508 --> 01:26:20,426
<i>seem desperately random?</i>

1203
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:22,679
<i>Like the elaboration of a bad liar.</i>

1204
01:26:22,762 --> 01:26:24,389
<i>Ta, Hannibal Lecter.</i>

1205
01:26:24,472 --> 01:26:27,183
Desperately random?
What does he mean?

1206
01:26:27,267 --> 01:26:28,726
Not random at all maybe.

1207
01:26:28,810 --> 01:26:30,562
Like there's some pattern here.

1208
01:26:31,813 --> 01:26:33,189
Yeah, but there is no pattern,

1209
01:26:33,273 --> 01:26:35,066
or the computers would have nailed it.

1210
01:26:35,149 --> 01:26:36,985
They're even found in random order.

1211
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:39,320
Random because of the one girl.

1212
01:26:39,821 --> 01:26:41,364
The one he weighted down.

1213
01:26:41,656 --> 01:26:42,699
Fredrica Bimmel...

1214
01:26:42,782 --> 01:26:43,825
Right.

1215
01:26:43,908 --> 01:26:47,203
From Belvedere, Ohio.

1216
01:26:47,662 --> 01:26:51,291
First girl taken, third body found.
Why?

1217
01:26:51,457 --> 01:26:53,751
Well, she didn't drift.
He weighted her down.

1218
01:26:53,835 --> 01:26:56,921
What did Lecter say about the first principles?

1219
01:26:57,297 --> 01:26:58,673
Simplicity.

1220
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:01,634
What does this guy do?
He covets.

1221
01:27:02,552 --> 01:27:04,846
How do we first start to covet?

1222
01:27:05,471 --> 01:27:07,140
We covet what we see...

1223
01:27:07,223 --> 01:27:08,474
Every day.

1224
01:27:10,768 --> 01:27:12,395
Hot damn, Clarice.

1225
01:27:12,478 --> 01:27:13,688
He knew her.

1226
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:30,598
Mr. Bimmel?

1227
01:28:30,682 --> 01:28:31,724
That's me.

1228
01:28:32,392 --> 01:28:34,936
Hello. I'm Clarice Starling.
I'm with the FBI.

1229
01:28:38,606 --> 01:28:40,066
I sure appreciate you letting me

1230
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:41,693
take a look around, Mr. Bimmel.

1231
01:28:42,652 --> 01:28:44,904
I don't know nothing new to tell you.

1232
01:28:44,988 --> 01:28:47,448
Police been back here so many times already.

1233
01:28:48,574 --> 01:28:52,161
Fredrica went into Chicago on the bus
to see about a job.

1234
01:28:52,912 --> 01:28:54,414
She left the interview okay.

1235
01:28:54,914 --> 01:28:56,290
She never come home.

1236
01:28:59,252 --> 01:29:00,920
Her bedroom's how she left it.

1237
01:29:01,796 --> 01:29:04,424
Upstairs. Door to the left.

1238
01:31:50,173 --> 01:31:52,383
He's making himself a woman suit,
Mr. Crawford,

1239
01:31:52,466 --> 01:31:53,551
out of real women.

1240
01:31:53,634 --> 01:31:56,345
And he can sew, this guy.
He's very skilled.

1241
01:31:56,429 --> 01:31:58,014
He's a tailor or a dressmaker or...

1242
01:31:58,097 --> 01:31:59,140
<i>Starling.</i>

1243
01:31:59,223 --> 01:32:01,309
That's why they're all so big.
He has to keep them alive

1244
01:32:01,392 --> 01:32:02,476
so he can starve them a while,

1245
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,561
so he can loosen their skin and take...

1246
01:32:03,644 --> 01:32:04,645
<i>Starling.</i>

1247
01:32:04,729 --> 01:32:07,190
<i>Starling. Starling, we know who he is
and where he is.</i>

1248
01:32:07,273 --> 01:32:08,524
<i>We're on our way right now.</i>

1249
01:32:08,608 --> 01:32:09,650
<i>Where?</i>

1250
01:32:09,775 --> 01:32:11,903
Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

1251
01:32:11,986 --> 01:32:14,488
Be on the ground in 45 minutes with HRT.

1252
01:32:14,572 --> 01:32:16,991
Oh, that's great news, sir, but how...

1253
01:32:17,074 --> 01:32:19,035
<i>Johns Hopkins came up with some names.</i>

1254
01:32:19,118 --> 01:32:20,661
<i>We fed him into
'Known Offenders'.</i>

1255
01:32:20,745 --> 01:32:24,916
Subject's name is Jamie Gumb,
a.k.a. John Grant.

1256
01:32:24,999 --> 01:32:27,585
<i>Lecter's description is accurate.
He just lied about the name.</i>

1257
01:32:27,668 --> 01:32:31,172
Listen to this. Customs
had some paper on him.

1258
01:32:31,255 --> 01:32:34,175
They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX.

1259
01:32:34,425 --> 01:32:36,719
Live caterpillars from Surinam.

1260
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:39,472
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

1261
01:32:40,306 --> 01:32:41,891
Well, Chicago's only 400 miles from here.

1262
01:32:41,974 --> 01:32:43,017
I'll be there in...

1263
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:44,143
<i>No, no, no, Starling.</i>

1264
01:32:44,227 --> 01:32:45,269
There's not enough time.

1265
01:32:45,353 --> 01:32:47,605
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.

1266
01:32:47,688 --> 01:32:50,107
I need you to link him to the Bimmel girl
before he's indicted.

1267
01:32:50,191 --> 01:32:51,943
See what you can dredge up in Belvedere.

1268
01:32:52,026 --> 01:32:54,278
Yes, sir. You bet.
I'll do my best.

1269
01:32:54,362 --> 01:32:57,990
Starling, we wouldn't have found him
without you.

1270
01:32:58,199 --> 01:33:01,494
Nobody's gonna forget that.
Least of all me.

1271
01:33:03,079 --> 01:33:04,413
Thank you, sir.

1272
01:33:04,497 --> 01:33:06,499
Thank you very much,
Mr. Crawford.

1273
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,460
Mr. Crawford?

1274
01:33:22,014 --> 01:33:24,475
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.

1275
01:33:24,558 --> 01:33:26,269
I got a better idea.

1276
01:33:47,915 --> 01:33:50,334
Okay, Precious. Time for a little treat.

1277
01:34:03,431 --> 01:34:04,724
Precious!

1278
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:08,811
Come on, girl!

1279
01:34:10,062 --> 01:34:12,315
Come on, Precious.
Come on, Precious!

1280
01:34:12,398 --> 01:34:14,108
<i>I see you rise</i>

1281
01:34:15,192 --> 01:34:20,031
<i>But it always falls</i>

1282
01:34:21,782 --> 01:34:23,492
Come on, Precious!

1283
01:34:23,784 --> 01:34:26,329
I got a yummy, yummy snack for you.

1284
01:34:26,662 --> 01:34:28,122
Come on. Come and get it.

1285
01:34:29,415 --> 01:34:30,666
<i>He said</i>

1286
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:35,004
<i>All things pass into the night</i>

1287
01:34:35,087 --> 01:34:36,380
Precious!

1288
01:34:37,298 --> 01:34:39,759
Are you up there, you little shit?

1289
01:34:40,593 --> 01:34:42,845
Come and get it, pretty girl.

1290
01:34:43,429 --> 01:34:45,598
<i>I must disagree</i>

1291
01:34:45,681 --> 01:34:47,224
<i>Oh, no, sir</i>

1292
01:34:47,975 --> 01:34:49,852
<i>I must say</i>

1293
01:34:49,935 --> 01:34:53,522
Precious. Please come. Come on.

1294
01:34:53,773 --> 01:34:55,566
<i>You told me</i>

1295
01:34:56,442 --> 01:35:00,237
<i>I've seen it all before</i>

1296
01:35:01,489 --> 01:35:02,948
Come on...

1297
01:35:04,450 --> 01:35:06,369
<i>I've seen my hopes and dreams</i>

1298
01:35:06,452 --> 01:35:08,996
<i>Are lying on the ground</i>

1299
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:11,248
<i>I've seen the sky</i>

1300
01:35:12,083 --> 01:35:14,293
<i>Just begin to fall</i>

1301
01:35:15,294 --> 01:35:16,962
Would you fuck me?

1302
01:35:17,254 --> 01:35:19,673
Come on. Take that bone. Come on.

1303
01:35:20,925 --> 01:35:23,677
Come on. Come. Come on.

1304
01:35:24,095 --> 01:35:25,513
I'd fuck me.

1305
01:35:26,138 --> 01:35:27,390
Come on.

1306
01:35:31,435 --> 01:35:33,145
I'd fuck me hard.

1307
01:35:33,562 --> 01:35:35,398
I'd fuck me so hard.

1308
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:41,362
No.

1309
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:49,912
<i>Goodbye horses</i>

1310
01:35:49,995 --> 01:35:52,832
<i>I'm flying over you</i>

1311
01:35:52,915 --> 01:35:56,460
<i>Goodbye horses</i>

1312
01:35:57,586 --> 01:36:00,589
<i>I'm flying over you</i>

1313
01:36:00,673 --> 01:36:04,760
<i>Goodbye horses</i>

1314
01:36:05,511 --> 01:36:10,474
<i>I'm flying, flying, flying over you</i>

1315
01:36:42,381 --> 01:36:44,633
Is that a good job, FBI agent?

1316
01:36:44,717 --> 01:36:46,594
You get to travel around and stuff?

1317
01:36:46,677 --> 01:36:48,721
I mean, better places than this?

1318
01:36:50,556 --> 01:36:52,224
Sometimes you do.

1319
01:36:53,058 --> 01:36:56,770
Freddie was so happy for me when
I got this job at the bank.

1320
01:36:57,563 --> 01:37:01,317
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.

1321
01:37:01,567 --> 01:37:04,028
She thought it was such hot shit.

1322
01:37:04,612 --> 01:37:06,864
What did she know? Big dummy.

1323
01:37:07,114 --> 01:37:09,366
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man

1324
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:13,078
named Jamie Gumb or a Jame Gumb?

1325
01:37:13,913 --> 01:37:15,247
How about John Grant?

1326
01:37:15,331 --> 01:37:16,332
No.

1327
01:37:16,415 --> 01:37:18,709
Oh, would she have had a friend
that you didn't know about, or...

1328
01:37:18,792 --> 01:37:21,587
No way. If she had a guy, I'd have known,
believe me.

1329
01:37:21,712 --> 01:37:23,464
Sewing was her life.

1330
01:37:24,048 --> 01:37:25,883
Did you two ever work together?

1331
01:37:25,966 --> 01:37:27,676
Oh, sure. Me and Pam Malavesi used

1332
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,429
to help her do alterations
for old Mrs. Lippman.

1333
01:37:31,055 --> 01:37:32,515
Can you give me Mrs. Lippman's address?

1334
01:37:32,598 --> 01:37:34,016
I need to talk to her.

1335
01:38:02,795 --> 01:38:05,881
So powerful. So beautiful.

1336
01:38:11,345 --> 01:38:12,638
Precious!

1337
01:38:18,602 --> 01:38:19,645
Precious!

1338
01:38:19,728 --> 01:38:21,981
Down here, you sack of shit!

1339
01:38:30,781 --> 01:38:31,865
Put her in that bucket.

1340
01:38:31,949 --> 01:38:35,494
No! You get me a telephone and
lower it down here. Now!

1341
01:38:38,205 --> 01:38:40,583
Poolie-poo. Precious.

1342
01:38:40,874 --> 01:38:42,543
Darling heart, are you alright?

1343
01:38:42,626 --> 01:38:44,169
She's in a lot of pain, mister.

1344
01:38:44,253 --> 01:38:45,754
She needs a vet.

1345
01:38:49,842 --> 01:38:51,468
She broke her leg on the way down.

1346
01:38:51,552 --> 01:38:52,761
I know it. She's been licking...

1347
01:38:52,845 --> 01:38:54,888
Hey, don't you hurt my dog!

1348
01:38:54,972 --> 01:38:56,974
Don't you make me hurt your dog!

1349
01:38:57,057 --> 01:38:59,184
Oh, you don't know what pain is!

1350
01:39:04,607 --> 01:39:08,402
Get me a live telephone line down here
or the dog's dead!

1351
01:39:12,823 --> 01:39:13,824
Damn fuck.

1352
01:39:13,907 --> 01:39:15,826
Get me that telephone!

1353
01:39:17,369 --> 01:39:19,330
I'm gonna do it, mister!

1354
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:22,916
I'll snap her neck off.
I swear to God!

1355
01:39:24,043 --> 01:39:25,544
You little fuck.

1356
01:39:32,635 --> 01:39:35,179
Down here!
Down here!

1357
01:39:35,262 --> 01:39:36,555
Help!

1358
01:39:49,234 --> 01:39:51,570
Okay, I'm coming.

1359
01:39:53,238 --> 01:39:54,782
We're going in.

1360
01:39:59,453 --> 01:40:01,914
Good afternoon. Uhm..sorry to bother you.

1361
01:40:01,997 --> 01:40:04,083
I'm looking for Mrs. Lippman's family.

1362
01:40:04,875 --> 01:40:06,001
FBI! Everybody down!

1363
01:40:06,085 --> 01:40:07,419
Everybody down, now!

1364
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,505
No. The Lippmans don't live here anymore.

1365
01:40:09,588 --> 01:40:10,964
No. Excuse me, sir.

1366
01:40:11,048 --> 01:40:12,591
I really need to speak with you.

1367
01:40:13,425 --> 01:40:14,551
Clear!

1368
01:40:14,635 --> 01:40:15,761
Clear!

1369
01:40:16,261 --> 01:40:18,472
What's the problem, Officer?

1370
01:40:18,597 --> 01:40:21,100
Well, I'm investigating the death
of Fredrica Bimmel.

1371
01:40:24,770 --> 01:40:26,271
There's no one here, Jack.

1372
01:40:28,774 --> 01:40:30,025
Clarice.

1373
01:40:30,275 --> 01:40:31,485
Your name is?

1374
01:40:31,568 --> 01:40:32,986
Oh, Jack Gordon.

1375
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:34,947
Mr. Gordon. Good. Um...

1376
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:37,074
Well, Fredrica used to work
for Mrs. Lippman.

1377
01:40:37,157 --> 01:40:38,283
Did you know her?

1378
01:40:39,243 --> 01:40:40,911
No. Uh..uh.

1379
01:40:41,453 --> 01:40:42,746
Oh, wait.

1380
01:40:43,205 --> 01:40:45,499
Was she a great, big fat person?

1381
01:40:46,333 --> 01:40:48,043
Yes. She was a big girl, sir.

1382
01:40:48,127 --> 01:40:49,294
Yeah, I...

1383
01:40:49,378 --> 01:40:50,379
I may have...

1384
01:40:50,462 --> 01:40:52,131
No, I read about her in the newspaper.

1385
01:40:52,631 --> 01:40:53,632
Um...

1386
01:40:54,216 --> 01:40:56,677
Mrs. Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help you.

1387
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:58,512
I got his card in here someplace.

1388
01:40:58,595 --> 01:41:00,097
Do you want to come in while I look for it?

1389
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:01,390
May I?
Yeah, sure.

1390
01:41:01,473 --> 01:41:02,808
Thank you.

1391
01:41:21,493 --> 01:41:23,996
Are you close to catching somebody,
you think?

1392
01:41:25,164 --> 01:41:27,124
Yes. We may be.

1393
01:41:29,543 --> 01:41:30,794
Did you...

1394
01:41:31,712 --> 01:41:34,840
take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Is that right?

1395
01:41:36,633 --> 01:41:40,679
Yeah. I bought this house,
uh, two years ago.

1396
01:41:42,181 --> 01:41:45,350
Did she leave any records,
any business records,

1397
01:41:45,768 --> 01:41:49,021
tax forms, list of employees?

1398
01:41:50,063 --> 01:41:52,274
No. Nothing like that at all.

1399
01:41:54,526 --> 01:41:57,029
Say, has the FBI learned something?

1400
01:41:57,446 --> 01:42:00,324
The police around here don't seem
to have the first clue.

1401
01:42:10,334 --> 01:42:13,796
I mean, have you got, like,
a description, fingerprints,

1402
01:42:13,879 --> 01:42:15,380
anything like that?

1403
01:42:16,381 --> 01:42:17,424
No.

1404
01:42:20,219 --> 01:42:21,720
No, we don't.

1405
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:33,857
Yeah. Here's that number.

1406
01:42:35,901 --> 01:42:37,653
Very good, Mr. Gordon.

1407
01:42:37,736 --> 01:42:39,363
May I use your phone, please?

1408
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:49,873
Sure you can use my phone.

1409
01:42:51,083 --> 01:42:52,501
Freeze!

1410
01:42:53,252 --> 01:42:54,962
<i>Put your hands over your head!</i>

1411
01:42:55,087 --> 01:42:56,797
And turn around!
Spread your legs!

1412
01:42:58,423 --> 01:43:00,008
Spread your legs!

1413
01:43:00,092 --> 01:43:01,885
Put your hands in the back!
Thumbs up!

1414
01:43:01,969 --> 01:43:03,011
Freeze!

1415
01:44:16,001 --> 01:44:17,502
Catherine! Hey!

1416
01:44:37,522 --> 01:44:39,483
Hello! Are you there?!

1417
01:44:41,610 --> 01:44:43,946
I'm down here!
I'm down here!

1418
01:45:04,049 --> 01:45:05,342
Catherine Martin?

1419
01:45:05,467 --> 01:45:06,760
Yes!

1420
01:45:08,887 --> 01:45:11,306
FBI! You're safe!

1421
01:45:11,890 --> 01:45:14,559
Safe, shit! Get me out of here!

1422
01:45:29,908 --> 01:45:31,994
You're alright, Catherine.
Where is he?

1423
01:45:32,077 --> 01:45:33,578
How the fuck should I know?

1424
01:45:33,662 --> 01:45:35,080
Just get me out of here!

1425
01:45:35,163 --> 01:45:38,291
Catherine, you've got to be quiet.
Now shut that dog up!

1426
01:45:38,375 --> 01:45:40,460
Just get me out of here!

1427
01:45:41,586 --> 01:45:42,963
Oh, my God.

1428
01:45:45,382 --> 01:45:47,843
Catherine, I'm going to get you out of there,

1429
01:45:47,926 --> 01:45:49,511
but right now, you listen to me.

1430
01:45:49,594 --> 01:45:51,930
I've got to leave this room.
I'll be right back.

1431
01:45:52,014 --> 01:45:54,850
No! Don't you leave me here,
you fucking bitch!

1432
01:45:54,933 --> 01:45:57,561
No! Don't you leave me here!

1433
01:45:57,644 --> 01:46:00,022
This guy's fucking crazy!

1434
01:46:02,816 --> 01:46:04,443
Please!

1435
01:46:04,526 --> 01:46:07,779
I've got to get out of here!

1436
01:46:10,282 --> 01:46:14,244
Catherine, the other officers will be here
any minute now!

1437
01:46:15,245 --> 01:46:16,496
Wait!

1438
01:46:17,122 --> 01:46:18,957
Don't go! Please!

1439
01:46:19,082 --> 01:46:20,250
Quiet!

1440
01:46:22,794 --> 01:46:24,212
Oh, God!

1441
01:50:21,241 --> 01:50:22,367
You okay?

1442
01:50:22,492 --> 01:50:23,618
Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm okay.

1443
01:50:23,702 --> 01:50:27,038
Agent Starling, how did you track
Buffalo Bill to this address?

1444
01:50:33,044 --> 01:50:35,547
Clarice M. Starling.

1445
01:50:38,049 --> 01:50:39,676
Congratulations.

1446
01:50:52,897 --> 01:50:55,066
Ernest W. Stevens.

1447
01:51:13,710 --> 01:51:15,295
Special Agent Starling.

1448
01:51:15,378 --> 01:51:16,838
Oh, Special Agent Mapp.

1449
01:51:16,921 --> 01:51:18,506
Phone call.
Thank you.

1450
01:51:18,590 --> 01:51:19,674
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1451
01:51:19,758 --> 01:51:20,884
Starling.

1452
01:51:23,678 --> 01:51:26,139
Pilch, could you take our picture?

1453
01:51:26,681 --> 01:51:27,766
Sure.

1454
01:51:29,267 --> 01:51:32,103
Look, I just wanted to say congratulations.

1455
01:51:32,479 --> 01:51:34,439
And I'm not much good at this kind of thing,

1456
01:51:34,522 --> 01:51:36,232
so I'm gonna duck out of here.

1457
01:51:36,316 --> 01:51:37,609
Okay, sure.

1458
01:51:39,319 --> 01:51:41,237
Thank you, Mr. Crawford.

1459
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:51,873
Your father would have been proud today.

1460
01:51:54,542 --> 01:51:56,753
Don't forget your phone call.

1461
01:52:00,965 --> 01:52:02,258
Starling.

1462
01:52:02,467 --> 01:52:06,805
Well, Clarice, have the lambs
stopped screaming?

1463
01:52:07,555 --> 01:52:08,723
Dr. Lecter.

1464
01:52:08,973 --> 01:52:11,893
Don't bother with a trace.
I won't be on long enough.

1465
01:52:15,522 --> 01:52:17,440
Where are you, Dr. Lecter?

1466
01:52:17,524 --> 01:52:19,734
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice.

1467
01:52:19,818 --> 01:52:22,320
The world's more interesting with you in it.

1468
01:52:22,862 --> 01:52:26,032
<i>So you take care now to extend me
the same courtesy.</i>

1469
01:52:26,116 --> 01:52:28,535
You know I can't make that promise.

1470
01:52:29,119 --> 01:52:31,788
I do wish we could chat longer,

1471
01:52:32,831 --> 01:52:35,375
but I'm having an old friend for dinner.

1472
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:38,002
Bye.

1473
01:52:38,670 --> 01:52:40,088
<i>Dr. Lecter...</i>

1474
01:52:42,424 --> 01:52:43,800
Dr. Lecter.

1475
01:52:46,177 --> 01:52:47,554
Dr. Lecter.

1476
01:52:49,556 --> 01:52:50,974
Dr. Lecter.

1477
01:52:51,516 --> 01:52:53,643
Hey, what? Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

1478
01:52:53,935 --> 01:52:55,395
Is the security system all set up?

1479
01:52:55,478 --> 01:52:56,896
We have the big-shot security.

1480
01:52:56,980 --> 01:52:58,440
Thank you. I appreciate that.
