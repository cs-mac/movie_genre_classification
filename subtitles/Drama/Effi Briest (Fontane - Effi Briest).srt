1
00:00:01,491 --> 00:00:03,721
You speak so strangely, Geert.

2
00:00:04,827 --> 00:00:08,388
There<i>'</i>s a hidden reproach in your words,
and l sense why.

3
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:13,061
lt irks you that Crampas came
and offered us his help.

4
00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:14,159
Us?

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,438
Yes, us. You and me.

6
00:00:18,107 --> 00:00:21,474
Have you forgotten?
The major helped at your request.

7
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:25,678
Why shouldn<i>'</i>t l drive with him
in his carriage, then?

8
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:31,382
Where l come from...

9
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:33,721
one says it is wrong...

10
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:36,248
to mistrust a gentleman.

11
00:00:36,526 --> 00:00:37,925
A gentleman!

12
00:00:38,427 --> 00:00:39,894
lsn<i>'</i>t he one?

13
00:00:42,598 --> 00:00:45,226
You yourself said how gallant he is...

14
00:00:45,635 --> 00:00:47,364
a perfect cavalier.

15
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:50,564
Yes, he<i>'</i>s gallant enough...

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,667
a perfect cavalier.

17
00:00:52,742 --> 00:00:55,233
No doubt about it. But a gentleman?

18
00:00:55,945 --> 00:00:59,108
My dear Effi,
a gentleman is something different.

19
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:02,140
Do you see anything noble about him?

20
00:01:02,218 --> 00:01:03,446
l don<i>'</i>t.

21
00:01:04,954 --> 00:01:07,684
lt would seem we<i>'</i>re of the same opinion.

22
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:09,686
Anyway...

23
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:12,619
as you remarked, it<i>'</i>s my fault.

24
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,461
l won<i>'</i>t say it was a faux pas.
That<i>'</i>s not the appropriate expression.

25
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:19,159
lt was my fault.

26
00:01:19,702 --> 00:01:22,728
And it won<i>'</i>t happen again if l can prevent it.

27
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:24,363
But you, too...

28
00:01:24,473 --> 00:01:27,670
should be on your guard,
if you<i>'</i>ll take my advice.

29
00:01:28,644 --> 00:01:30,635
He<i>'</i>s an unscrupulous man.

30
00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:34,676
He has his own ideas about young women.
l know him of old.

31
00:01:36,552 --> 00:01:38,577
l shall heed your words...

32
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:41,580
but l must say...

33
00:01:41,657 --> 00:01:43,648
l think you misjudge him.

34
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:49,128
l do not misjudge him.

35
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:55,196
Perhaps me, then.

36
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:57,169
Nor you, my dear Effi.

37
00:01:57,573 --> 00:01:59,768
You<i>'</i>re a delightful little woman...

38
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:02,834
but steadfastness is not your strong point.

39
00:02:10,953 --> 00:02:14,889
NOT A DAY PASSED WlTHOUT

40
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:19,223
HER TAKlNG THE PRESCRlBED WALK.

41
00:02:29,905 --> 00:02:31,304
Roswitha...

42
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:34,774
l<i>'</i>m going down to the square
where the merry-go-round is.

43
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:36,812
l<i>'</i>ll wait for you there.

44
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:56,361
<i>The first day, they met as arranged.</i>

45
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,166
<i>UsuaIIy, though, when Roswitha</i>
<i>reached the merry-go-round...</i>

46
00:03:01,303 --> 00:03:03,032
<i>nobody was there...</i>

47
00:03:03,105 --> 00:03:06,768
<i>and when she entered the haII</i>
<i>at home again...</i>

48
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:09,204
<i>Effi wouId come toward her and say.:</i>

49
00:03:09,278 --> 00:03:12,645
<i>''Where have you been, Roswitha?</i>
<i>I got back ages ago.''</i>

50
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:15,246
<i>It went on Iike this for weeks.</i>

51
00:03:18,754 --> 00:03:23,020
<i>''</i>Forgive my sudden departure, lnnstetten.
lt all happened so quickly.

52
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:25,625
<i>''</i>l shall try to spin it out.

53
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:28,156
<i>''</i>lt<i>'</i>s good to get away for a while.

54
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,256
<i>''</i>My regards to your charming wife
and my benefactress.

55
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,925
<i>''</i>Major Crampas<i>.''</i>

56
00:03:33,436 --> 00:03:35,097
A good thing, too!

57
00:03:35,638 --> 00:03:38,334
-What do you mean?
-That he<i>'</i>s gone away.

58
00:03:38,574 --> 00:03:41,065
He<i>'</i>s always saying the same things.

59
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:45,341
When he comes back, at least
he<i>'</i>ll have something new to talk about.

60
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:48,944
l must go away as well. To Berlin.

61
00:03:50,286 --> 00:03:53,187
Perhaps l can bring back
something new, too.

62
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:56,590
My Effi always likes to hear something new.

63
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,257
She<i>'</i>s bored in dear old Kessin.

64
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,462
l<i>'</i>ll be away for about a week...

65
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:05,866
perhaps one day longer.

66
00:04:07,103 --> 00:04:08,866
And don<i>'</i>t be afraid.

67
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:10,934
lt won<i>'</i>t come back.

68
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,340
You know what l mean...

69
00:04:13,642 --> 00:04:15,405
that thing upstairs.

70
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:17,446
<i>Effi smiIed to herseIf...</i>

71
00:04:17,513 --> 00:04:20,346
<i>and in her smiIe was a hint of meIanchoIy.</i>

72
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,977
<i>She recaIIed the day</i>
<i>Crampas had Iast toId her...</i>

73
00:04:24,386 --> 00:04:28,186
<i>Innstetten was enacting a comedy</i>
<i>with the ghost and her fear.</i>

74
00:04:28,257 --> 00:04:30,122
<i>''The born schooImaster!''</i>

75
00:04:30,192 --> 00:04:33,559
<i>But wasn't he right?</i>
<i>Wasn't the comedy justified?</i>

76
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:37,593
<i>ConfIicting thoughts, good and eviI,</i>
<i>went through her mind.</i>

77
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,601
<i>Three days Iater, Innstetten Ieft.</i>

78
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:44,105
<i>He said nothing about</i>
<i>his reasons for going to BerIin.</i>

79
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,941
SHE GAVE UP HER WALKS

80
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,877
TO THE BEACH AND THE PLANTATlON

81
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:53,642
WHlLE CRAMPAS WAS lN STETTlN,

82
00:04:53,716 --> 00:04:56,742
BUT SHE RESUMED THEM ON HlS RETURN.

83
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,413
NOT EVEN lNCLEMENT WEATHER

84
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,693
COULD DETER HER.

85
00:05:02,462 --> 00:05:06,523
Either it was unrequited love,
or it might have been requited...

86
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,469
and the Chinaman couldn<i>'</i>t bear
the thought that it was suddenly all over.

87
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:17,035
The Chinese are human beings as well.
They feel everything just as we do.

88
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:18,608
Everything.

89
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,248
-l need the leather varnish.
-l<i>'</i>ll bring it out to you, Kruse.

90
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:37,258
Everything as we do.

91
00:05:37,564 --> 00:05:39,896
There<i>'</i>s a time and place for everything.

92
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:43,231
But that business with the Chinaman
is very strange.

93
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:45,632
lt<i>'</i>s a load of nonsense.

94
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:48,037
And instead of attending
to what<i>'</i>s important...

95
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:50,075
my wife talks about things like that.

96
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:53,635
When l need a clean shirt,
there<i>'</i>s a button missing.

97
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:55,874
Then there<i>'</i>s the black chicken!

98
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:57,940
lt doesn<i>'</i>t even lay eggs.

99
00:05:59,386 --> 00:06:00,853
And anyway...

100
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:03,452
how should it lay eggs?

101
00:06:03,523 --> 00:06:05,491
lt doesn<i>'</i>t even get out.

102
00:06:05,558 --> 00:06:08,391
You men are worse than one thinks.

103
00:06:09,462 --> 00:06:11,828
l ought to take the brush...

104
00:06:12,232 --> 00:06:14,223
and paint your moustache.

105
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:17,095
Well...

106
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,230
l could accept that from you, Roswitha.

107
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:22,703
Roswitha!

108
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:48,833
l must remind you
that Kruse is a married man.

109
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:51,693
l know, ma<i>'</i>am.

110
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:57,065
One knows so many things
and behaves as if one didn<i>'</i>t.

111
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:03,743
lf you<i>'</i>re reckoning on her illness,
you<i>'</i>ll be disappointed.

112
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,682
Sick people live longest of all.

113
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:11,580
How was it the first time with you?

114
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:15,091
ls it something you can tell me?

115
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:19,427
Yes, l can tell you.

116
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,394
lt was terrible...

117
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:24,628
and for that reason...

118
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:28,333
you can set your mind at rest
as far as Kruse is concerned.

119
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:33,005
When you<i>'</i>ve been through
what l<i>'</i>ve been through, you<i>'</i>ve had enough.

120
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:37,406
The next day, l always feel shattered.
And such terrible anxiety!

121
00:07:38,718 --> 00:07:40,743
Tell me, then. How was it?

122
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:46,219
l know from at home, with women like you,
it<i>'</i>s always the same story.

123
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:50,455
Yes...

124
00:07:51,131 --> 00:07:54,032
in the end, it probably is always the same.

125
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:58,564
l don<i>'</i>t want to pretend
my case was anything special.

126
00:07:58,638 --> 00:08:00,265
Not in the least.

127
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:03,132
But when they accused me to my face...

128
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:05,439
and l suddenly had to admit:

129
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:07,173
<i>''</i>Yes, it<i>'</i>s true<i>.''</i>

130
00:08:07,714 --> 00:08:09,375
That was dreadful.

131
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:11,981
My mother wasn<i>'</i>t too hard on me.

132
00:08:12,352 --> 00:08:16,254
But my father, the village blacksmith,
was strict and terrible.

133
00:08:17,624 --> 00:08:22,186
When he heard about it, he went for me
with an iron bar from the fire.

134
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:24,059
He wanted to kill me.

135
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:26,392
l had a younger sister...

136
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,427
who used to point at me and say,
<i>''</i>Shame on you!<i>''</i>

137
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:34,572
When the child was due,
l went into a nearby barn...

138
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:38,009
because l didn<i>'</i>t dare show my face at home.

139
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:40,639
Strangers found me half dead.

140
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:44,845
They carried me into the house
and put me to bed.

141
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:46,814
On the third day...

142
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:49,045
they took my child away...

143
00:08:49,856 --> 00:08:52,950
and when l asked later where it was...

144
00:08:53,893 --> 00:08:56,191
they said it was in good hands.

145
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:01,031
Oh, ma<i>'</i>am...

146
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:06,236
may the Holy Virgin
protect you from such heartache!

147
00:09:07,707 --> 00:09:09,436
The things you say!

148
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:12,807
l<i>'</i>m a married woman.

149
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:17,972
You shouldn<i>'</i>t say things like that.

150
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:20,312
lt<i>'</i>s out of place.

151
00:09:21,221 --> 00:09:22,711
lt<i>'</i>s unseemly.

152
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:31,163
Oh, ma<i>'</i>am<i>....</i>

153
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:42,605
Tell me...

154
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:46,006
how do you imagine a ministry?

155
00:09:46,846 --> 00:09:48,211
A ministry?

156
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:52,140
That can mean two things.

157
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:56,521
lt may mean clever, distinguished men
who govern the country...

158
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:59,817
or it could be a building, a palazzo.

159
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:04,886
Would you like to live in such a palazzo?

160
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:06,929
l mean...

161
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:08,862
in such a ministry?

162
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:10,832
Heavens above, Geert!

163
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:13,804
They haven<i>'</i>t made you a minister?

164
00:10:14,874 --> 00:10:17,570
Gieshuebler said something of the kind.

165
00:10:17,944 --> 00:10:20,242
And the prince is all-powerful.

166
00:10:21,114 --> 00:10:23,014
He<i>'</i>s done it at last...

167
00:10:25,885 --> 00:10:27,477
and l<i>'</i>m only 18!

168
00:10:32,325 --> 00:10:34,316
No, Effi, not a minister.

169
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:36,692
We haven<i>'</i>t come that far yet.

170
00:10:36,763 --> 00:10:38,560
To tell the truth...

171
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:41,623
we won<i>'</i>t even live in a ministry...

172
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:44,760
but l<i>'</i>ll be going to one every day.

173
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:50,166
And you<i>'</i>ll be the wife of
a leading official and live in Berlin...

174
00:10:51,144 --> 00:10:53,476
Soon, you<i>'</i>ll hardly remember...

175
00:10:53,546 --> 00:10:55,571
you once lived in Kessin...

176
00:10:55,648 --> 00:10:58,116
with only Gieshuebler...

177
00:10:58,418 --> 00:10:59,976
and the dunes...

178
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:02,351
and the plantation for company.

179
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:10,726
Thank God!

180
00:11:11,064 --> 00:11:13,396
Get up, Effi! What<i>'</i>s the matter?

181
00:11:16,936 --> 00:11:18,597
What<i>'</i>s the matter?

182
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:21,368
l thought you were happy here.

183
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:25,538
You say <i>''</i>Thank God<i>''</i>
as if it had been an affliction here.

184
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,947
Was l the affliction?

185
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:34,914
Tell me!

186
00:11:37,924 --> 00:11:40,449
How can you ask such a thing, Geert?

187
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:00,878
Oh, ma<i>'</i>am...

188
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:03,747
Kessin is...

189
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:06,680
all well and good...

190
00:12:06,753 --> 00:12:08,516
but it<i>'</i>s not Berlin.

191
00:12:10,123 --> 00:12:13,422
Some days, you see no more
than half a dozen people.

192
00:12:15,728 --> 00:12:17,889
And nothing but the dunes...

193
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:20,032
and the sea out there...

194
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:22,797
rushing and surging.

195
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:27,406
But that<i>'</i>s all there is.

196
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:31,135
Yes, you<i>'</i>re right, Roswitha.

197
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:34,545
lt rushes and surges...

198
00:12:35,515 --> 00:12:37,278
but that<i>'</i>s not life.

199
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:43,545
One has all kinds of foolish ideas.

200
00:12:47,193 --> 00:12:48,956
You have to admit...

201
00:12:50,263 --> 00:12:52,527
that matter with Kruse was not right.

202
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:08,041
Yes, my dear Gieshuebler,
but just for a moment.

203
00:13:13,152 --> 00:13:15,143
l<i>'</i>ve come to say goodbye.

204
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:18,518
But, my dear lady, surely you<i>'</i>ll be back.

205
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:22,353
l heard it was for just 3 or 4 days...

206
00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:25,093
Yes, l should return.

207
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:30,468
ln a week at the latest,
l<i>'</i>m supposed to be back in Kessin.

208
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:35,871
But who knows if l shall return?

209
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,009
l don<i>'</i>t have to tell you,
so many things can happen.

210
00:13:43,516 --> 00:13:45,882
You want to say l<i>'</i>m too young...

211
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,312
but even young people die.

212
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:09,667
And if l lived to be a hundred,
l<i>'</i>d never forget you.

213
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:18,246
There were times when l felt lonely here.

214
00:14:18,784 --> 00:14:22,345
Sometimes my heart was heavy,
more than you can imagine.

215
00:14:24,624 --> 00:14:27,252
l haven<i>'</i>t always done the right thing.

216
00:14:29,795 --> 00:14:31,888
But whenever l saw you...

217
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:35,695
l felt better, a better person, too.

218
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:38,866
But, my dear lady<i>....</i>

219
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,807
And l want to thank you for that.

220
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:50,449
Goodbye, my dear friend!

221
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,310
Give my regards to your friend,
Miss Trippelli.

222
00:14:57,056 --> 00:15:00,958
l have thought of her a lot recently
and of Prince Kotschukoff.

223
00:15:03,262 --> 00:15:05,389
lt<i>'</i>s a strange relationship.

224
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,868
Yet l can understand it.

225
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:25,580
Let me hear from you.

226
00:15:28,888 --> 00:15:30,515
Or l shall write.

227
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:47,263
<i>''I am Ieaving tomorrow by boat,</i>
<i>and this is a fareweII note.</i>

228
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:51,401
<i>''Innstetten expects me back in a few days,</i>
<i>but I shaII not return.</i>

229
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:53,972
<i>''You know why.</i>

230
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,409
<i>''It wouId have been better</i>
<i>if I had never seen this pIace.</i>

231
00:15:58,951 --> 00:16:01,886
<i>''I beg you not to take this as a reproach.</i>

232
00:16:02,555 --> 00:16:04,352
<i>''It was aII my fauIt.</i>

233
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:07,221
<i>''In view of your home Iife...</i>

234
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:10,327
<i>''your actions may be excusabIe,</i>
<i>but not mine.</i>

235
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:14,298
<i>''I bear a heavy burden of guiIt,</i>
<i>but perhaps there's a way out.</i>

236
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:17,934
<i>''Being transferred from here</i>
<i>seems Iike a sign...</i>

237
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:20,199
<i>''that I may stiII find mercy.</i>

238
00:16:20,906 --> 00:16:22,271
<i>''Forget me.</i>

239
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:23,874
<i>''Your Effi.''</i>

240
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:22,799
What a lovely place you have, Mama!

241
00:17:22,868 --> 00:17:25,200
But what<i>'</i>s wrong with your eyes?

242
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:28,572
ln the carriage, all we talked about...

243
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:30,871
was lnnstetten and our career.

244
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:33,378
Far too much.

245
00:17:34,113 --> 00:17:36,206
There must be an end to it.

246
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:39,015
Your eyes are more important to me.

247
00:17:40,286 --> 00:17:42,948
ln one respect, they<i>'</i>re unchanged.

248
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,650
They have the same old kindness
when you look at me.

249
00:17:46,726 --> 00:17:49,422
You<i>'</i>re so impetuous. The same old Effi!

250
00:17:52,064 --> 00:17:53,326
No, Mama.

251
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:56,894
Not the old Effi.

252
00:17:58,371 --> 00:17:59,861
l wish l were.

253
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,665
Marriage changes a person.

254
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,272
lnnstetten is impatient for me to return.

255
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:16,185
To cut matters short,
l suggest we rent the apartment today...

256
00:18:16,622 --> 00:18:18,647
and l<i>'</i>ll go back tomorrow.

257
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:21,889
lt<i>'</i>s so hard to leave you.

258
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:24,691
Which apartment will you take?

259
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:27,122
The one in Keithstrasse...

260
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:30,234
which we both liked
from the very beginning.

261
00:18:31,537 --> 00:18:34,199
lt<i>'</i>s probably not quite dried out yet...

262
00:18:34,273 --> 00:18:37,800
but it<i>'</i>s summer now,
which is some consolation.

263
00:18:39,478 --> 00:18:41,878
lf l feel a twinge of rheumatism...

264
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:43,938
there<i>'</i>s always Hohen-Cremmen.

265
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:45,574
Don<i>'</i>t tempt providence!

266
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:48,745
Suddenly one has rheumatism
without knowing why.

267
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,829
Dr. Rummschuettel...

268
00:18:58,898 --> 00:19:01,594
l don<i>'</i>t know how to describe it.

269
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:04,596
lt keeps changing.

270
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:07,903
At the moment, it seems to have gone.

271
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:11,371
At first, l thought it was rheumatism...

272
00:19:12,478 --> 00:19:15,106
but now l think it might be neuralgia.

273
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:18,173
Very likely, my dear lady.

274
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:21,546
Rest and warmth...

275
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:23,950
are the best thing.

276
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:26,925
And a little medicine...

277
00:19:26,992 --> 00:19:29,620
nothing bad, will do the rest.

278
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,121
But no mental exertion...

279
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:34,832
no visits...

280
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:37,132
-no books.
-lt<i>'</i>s Scott.

281
00:19:37,603 --> 00:19:40,037
Oh, l<i>'</i>ve no objection to him.

282
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,705
Travel books are best.

283
00:19:44,243 --> 00:19:46,040
l<i>'</i>ll call again tomorrow.

284
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:51,981
<i>The question of costs has to be considered.</i>

285
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:54,585
<i>Our expenses wiII increase anyway.</i>

286
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:58,753
<i>RummschuetteI wiII have to be paid</i>
<i>if he remains our doctor.</i>

287
00:19:59,892 --> 00:20:02,486
<i>He's a very pIeasant oId gentIeman...</i>

288
00:20:03,128 --> 00:20:06,120
<i>aIthough medicaIIy,</i>
<i>he's not considered top rank.</i>

289
00:20:06,198 --> 00:20:11,192
<i>His detractors caII him a ''Iadies' doctor, ''</i>
<i>but there's an eIement of praise in that.</i>

290
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,458
A NEW ERA lS DAWNlNG,

291
00:20:41,534 --> 00:20:44,833
AND l<i>'</i>M NO LONGER AFRAlD.

292
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:48,135
l SHALL TRY TO BE BETTER

293
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:51,904
AND COMPL Y MORE WlTH YOUR WlSHES.

294
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:01,981
How are Gieshuebler and all the others?

295
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:04,145
Who are <i>''</i>all the others<i>''</i>?

296
00:21:05,357 --> 00:21:07,917
Crampas sends you his regards.

297
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:10,623
That<i>'</i>s nice of him.

298
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,755
And Frau von Padden sends her respects.

299
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:16,357
She said you are a charming woman...

300
00:21:16,502 --> 00:21:18,993
but l should take good care of you.

301
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:21,633
And when l replied...

302
00:21:21,707 --> 00:21:25,234
you regarded me more
as a teacher than a husband...

303
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:27,902
she murmured...

304
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:30,008
almost absently:

305
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,677
<i>''</i>A little lamb...

306
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:35,113
<i>''</i>white as the driven snow<i>....''</i>

307
00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:37,317
Then she broke off.

308
00:21:51,236 --> 00:21:53,761
Has Johanna ever shown you
her Chinaman?

309
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:58,373
Which one?

310
00:22:00,512 --> 00:22:02,412
Ours, of course.

311
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:07,642
Before she left our old home,
she detached him from the chair...

312
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,911
and put him in her purse.

313
00:22:10,055 --> 00:22:12,615
When she changed a mark for me recently...

314
00:22:12,691 --> 00:22:13,953
l saw it.

315
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,121
And...

316
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,191
she admitted it with embarrassment.

317
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,476
She told me...

318
00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:45,880
that her sense of
being a stranger had gone...

319
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,051
and that she was very glad.

320
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:51,491
Kessin wasn<i>'</i>t the right place for her...

321
00:22:51,764 --> 00:22:54,255
with its spooky house and the people.

322
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,268
Some were too pious, others too pedestrian.

323
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:02,830
Since her move to Berlin,
she says she feels at home.

324
00:23:03,642 --> 00:23:05,667
He<i>'</i>s the best of husbands...

325
00:23:05,744 --> 00:23:08,235
a bit too old and too good for her.

326
00:23:09,048 --> 00:23:11,073
But now the worst is over.

327
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:15,610
That was the expression she used...

328
00:23:15,954 --> 00:23:18,047
and it rather surprised me.

329
00:23:20,325 --> 00:23:24,193
Why? lt may not be
the best of expressions, but<i>....</i>

330
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,160
There<i>'</i>s something behind it...

331
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,763
which she wanted to allude to.

332
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,037
You think so?

333
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:35,038
Yes, Briest.

334
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:38,809
You think butter wouldn<i>'</i>t melt in her mouth.

335
00:23:39,745 --> 00:23:41,372
But you<i>'</i>re wrong.

336
00:23:43,749 --> 00:23:46,377
She likes to drift with the current...

337
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,718
and if the current is good, so is she.

338
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:55,891
Fighting and resistance
are not her strong points.

339
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:03,266
<i>She recaIIed the day...</i>

340
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,563
<i>scarceIy two years before...</i>

341
00:24:05,637 --> 00:24:07,298
<i>when the visitor had come...</i>

342
00:24:07,372 --> 00:24:09,863
<i>and she had cIimbed</i>
<i>the steps beside the bench...</i>

343
00:24:09,942 --> 00:24:12,467
<i>and an hour Iater she was betrothed.</i>

344
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:17,504
<i>Images of her Iife in Kessin</i>
<i>rose unbidden before her inward eye.</i>

345
00:24:18,183 --> 00:24:20,879
<i>There was Crampas coming to greet her...</i>

346
00:24:20,953 --> 00:24:23,080
<i>then Roswitha with the baby.</i>

347
00:24:23,155 --> 00:24:26,022
<i>She took the chiId,</i>
<i>heId her up and kissed her.</i>

348
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,924
<i>''That was the first day,</i>
<i>when everything had begun.''</i>

349
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:31,792
<i>The nearby cIock began to strike...</i>

350
00:24:31,997 --> 00:24:33,794
<i>and Effi counted the strokes.</i>

351
00:24:33,866 --> 00:24:35,094
<i>''10.:00.</i>

352
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:37,601
<i>''This time tomorrow, I'II be in BerIin.</i>

353
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:40,001
<i>''It's our wedding anniversary.</i>

354

357

358
00:24:50,249 --> 00:24:53,275
<i>''but does it weigh on my souI?</i>
<i>No, it doesn't...</i>

359
00:24:53,352 --> 00:24:56,219
<i>''and that's what frightens me about myseIf.</i>

360
00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:59,456
<i>''What weighs on me is something different.</i>

361
00:24:59,525 --> 00:25:02,085
<i>''Fear, a mortaI dread...</i>

362
00:25:02,327 --> 00:25:04,522
<i>''that aII wiII be discovered.</i>

363
00:25:04,596 --> 00:25:07,258
<i>''And on top of the fear, I feeI ashamed.</i>

364
00:25:07,332 --> 00:25:11,166
<i>''But I don't feeI true repentance.</i>
<i>Nor do I feeI true shame.</i>

365
00:25:11,837 --> 00:25:15,568
<i>''I'm tormented by fear</i>
<i>and ashamed of the whoIe web of Iies.</i>

366
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:20,437
<i>''But I feeI no shame for my guiIt,</i>

00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:29,385
<i>''And if they're not, as I hope,</i>

370
00:25:29,454 --> 00:25:33,550
<i>''Then something's wrong with my souI.</i>
<i>I Iack the right sentiments.</i>

371
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,093
<i>''OId Niemeyer once said to me...</i>

372
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:38,254
<i>''when I was onIy a chiId...</i>

373
00:25:38,363 --> 00:25:41,355

<i>''If one didn't have them,</i>

<i>''MercifuI God, is that how I am?''</i>

378
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,677
<i>She Iaid her head on her arms</i>
<i>and wept bitterIy.</i>

379
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,686
l thought you might not keep your word.

380
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:13,023
Really, Geert! That<i>'</i>s the least l can do.

381
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:16,467
Don<i>'</i>t say that. lt<i>'</i>s not always easy.

382
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:19,863
Sometimes one can<i>'</i>t. Just think back.

383
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:24,700
l was expecting you back in Kessin,
after you<i>'</i>d rented the apartment...

384
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:26,835
and who didn<i>'</i>t come? Effi.

385
00:26:28,313 --> 00:26:30,508
That was something different.

386
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:49,633
Our life in Berlin is just beginning, Effi.

387
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:53,864
ln April, when we moved in...

388
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:56,271
the season was coming to an end.

389
00:26:56,508 --> 00:26:59,033
We hardly had time to pay our calls.

390
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:01,341
And Woellersdorf...

391
00:27:01,847 --> 00:27:04,247
the only person we know better...

392
00:27:04,316 --> 00:27:06,443
is a bachelor unfortunately.

393
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:11,646
From June onward, everything<i>'</i>s dead.

394
00:27:12,724 --> 00:27:14,624
The lowered shutters...

395
00:27:15,227 --> 00:27:16,990
tell you everything.

396
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:19,793
<i>''</i>Everyone<i>'</i>s gone<i>''...</i>

397
00:27:20,332 --> 00:27:22,857
regardless whether it<i>'</i>s true or not.

398
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,262
So...

399
00:27:26,672 --> 00:27:28,162
what was left?

400
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:31,968
A chat with cousin Briest...

401
00:27:32,044 --> 00:27:33,807
dinner at Hiller<i>'</i>s...

402
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:36,006
That<i>'</i>s not real Berlin life.

403
00:27:36,348 --> 00:27:38,839
But now things will change.

404
00:27:46,725 --> 00:27:51,389
l<i>'</i>ve noted the names of all top officials
who are active enough to entertain.

405
00:27:52,864 --> 00:27:55,697
We shall entertain, too.

406
00:27:57,569 --> 00:28:01,403
And when winter comes,
the whole ministry should be saying:

407
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,873
<i>''</i>The most charming woman in our circle...

408
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:11,441
<i>''</i>is the wife of lnnstetten<i>.''</i>

409
00:28:17,823 --> 00:28:20,758
Oh, Geert, l hardly know you like this.

410
00:28:22,027 --> 00:28:24,461
You<i>'</i>re talking like a ladies<i>'</i> man.

411
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,225
lt<i>'</i>s our wedding anniversary.

412
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:32,269
You must allow me that.

413
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:47,481
First and foremost, Crampas...

414
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:50,210
Major Crampas, quite the beau...

415
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,084
and something of a Barbarossa
to whom my wife...

416
00:28:57,229 --> 00:29:00,198
understandably or not...

417
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:02,762
had taken a liking.

418
00:29:04,436 --> 00:29:06,631
Let<i>'</i>s say <i>''</i>understandably<i>''...</i>

419
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:11,767
because l assume he was chairman
of the club and playing a role...

420
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:14,512
the lover or bon vivant.

421
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:17,345
Perhaps something even grander.

422
00:29:17,849 --> 00:29:20,079
He may have been a tenor, too.

423
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,488
<i>A second year passed...</i>

424
00:29:28,794 --> 00:29:31,388
<i>and when a new foundation</i>
<i>was estabIished...</i>

425
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:34,364
<i>the empress chose</i>
<i>the ''privy counciIIor's wife''...</i>

426
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:35,957
<i>as a Iady-in-waiting.</i>

427
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:40,232
<i>At the court baII, the oId Kaiser</i>
<i>addressed appreciative words...</i>

428
00:29:40,305 --> 00:29:44,537
<i>to the IoveIy young woman,</i>
<i>of whom he had heard so much.</i>

429
00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:51,512
Well then...

430
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,880
Schwalbach to begin with, let<i>'</i>s say...

431
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:56,986
three weeks.

432
00:29:57,389 --> 00:29:59,914
Then the same length of time in Ems.

433
00:30:00,158 --> 00:30:03,355
During the cure in Ems,
your husband may join you.

434
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:06,254
ln other words...

435
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:08,492
three weeks<i>'</i> separation.

436
00:30:09,868 --> 00:30:12,894
That<i>'</i>s the best l can do for you, lnnstetten.

437
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:28,782
Tell me, Roswitha...

438
00:30:30,022 --> 00:30:31,683
you<i>'</i>re a Catholic.

439
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:37,659
Don<i>'</i>t you ever go to confession?

440
00:30:38,063 --> 00:30:39,087
No.

441
00:30:39,832 --> 00:30:41,060
Why not?

442
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:44,068
l used to go.

443
00:30:45,404 --> 00:30:48,271
But l didn<i>'</i>t confess the important things.

444
00:30:49,475 --> 00:30:51,943
Didn<i>'</i>t you ever feel it a relief...

445
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,376
to be able to unburden your soul?

446
00:30:55,047 --> 00:30:56,378
No, ma<i>'</i>am.

447
00:31:00,886 --> 00:31:02,547
l was afraid...

448
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:05,784
when my father went for me
with the red-hot iron.

449
00:31:07,726 --> 00:31:08,920
Yes...

450
00:31:09,528 --> 00:31:11,519
l was scared to death...

451
00:31:12,698 --> 00:31:14,893
but it wasn<i>'</i>t more than that.

452
00:31:16,535 --> 00:31:18,400
You have no fear of God?

453
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,869
No, ma<i>'</i>am.

454
00:31:21,473 --> 00:31:25,034
lf you feared your father as much l did...

455
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:28,545
you wouldn<i>'</i>t be so afraid of God.

456
00:31:32,084 --> 00:31:34,518
l always thought God was good...

457
00:31:35,721 --> 00:31:38,417
and would help a poor creature like me.

458
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:03,607
Let<i>'</i>s see who gets up the stairs first.

459
00:32:39,952 --> 00:32:41,544
lt<i>'</i>s nothing, sir.

460
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,611
Annie fell on the stairs.

461
00:32:51,897 --> 00:32:53,364
There, there!

462
00:32:57,636 --> 00:32:59,536
Where were the letters?

463
00:33:00,572 --> 00:33:02,563
Right at the bottom, sir.

464
00:33:04,676 --> 00:33:07,076
Johanna, bring me a cup of coffee!

465
00:33:07,145 --> 00:33:10,444

MY DEAREST EFFl,

473
00:33:51,256 --> 00:33:54,350
BE AT THE USUAL PLACE AGAlN TODAY.

474
00:33:56,695 --> 00:33:59,459
<i>I have asked you to come for two reasons.</i>

475
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:02,263
<i>To issue a chaIIenge on my behaIf...</i>

476
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:04,962
<i>and to act as my second in the dueI.</i>

477
00:34:05,704 --> 00:34:08,730
<i>The first is not agreeabIe,</i>
<i>the second even Iess so.</i>

478
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:10,775
<i>And what is your answer?</i>

479
00:34:11,977 --> 00:34:14,241
You know l am at your service.

480
00:34:15,647 --> 00:34:18,878
But before l know more,
forgive a naive question.

481
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,679
Does it have to be?

482
00:34:20,886 --> 00:34:22,683
We<i>'</i>re both too old...

483
00:34:23,455 --> 00:34:25,946
you to take a pistol in the hand...

484
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:28,254
and l to assist you in the deed.

485
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:30,227
Don<i>'</i>t misunderstand me.

486
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:32,961
That doesn<i>'</i>t mean l<i>'</i>m saying no.

487
00:34:33,732 --> 00:34:36,064
How could l refuse you anything?

488
00:34:36,935 --> 00:34:39,267
But tell me what it<i>'</i>s all about?

489
00:34:39,404 --> 00:34:41,838
lt concerns a suitor of my wife...

490
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,838
who was also a friend of mine, or almost.

491
00:34:45,143 --> 00:34:46,804
That<i>'</i>s impossible!

492
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:49,570
lt<i>'</i>s not only possible, it<i>'</i>s a fact.

493
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:52,247
Read these!

494
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:55,781
Addressed to your wife?

495
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:58,288
l found them in her sewing table.

496
00:34:58,523 --> 00:35:01,014
-And who wrote them?
-Major Crampas.

497
00:35:02,728 --> 00:35:06,459
Then these things happened
when you were still in Kessin...

498
00:35:06,865 --> 00:35:09,493
-six or more years ago?
-Yes.

499
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:14,098
<i>It seems aImost, WuIIersdorf...</i>

500
00:35:14,172 --> 00:35:17,505
<i>as if those 6 or 7 years</i>
<i>make you think differentIy.</i>

501
00:35:19,344 --> 00:35:22,313
<i>There is a theory of Iimitations, of course...</i>

502
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:26,774
<i>but I'm not sure this is a case</i>
<i>where that theory can be appIied.</i>

503
00:35:27,486 --> 00:35:29,249
<i>I don't know either.</i>

504
00:35:29,321 --> 00:35:33,223
<i>But everything wouId seem</i>
<i>to turn on that question.</i>

505
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:35,050
<i>Are you serious?</i>

506
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:37,656
<i>AbsoIuteIy serious.</i>

507
00:35:37,963 --> 00:35:40,454
<i>It's not a matter of jeu d'esprit...</i>

508
00:35:40,532 --> 00:35:42,727
<i>or for sophistry.</i>

509
00:35:43,502 --> 00:35:45,493
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

510
00:35:46,538 --> 00:35:49,371
Tell me frankly. How do you see the matter?

511
00:35:51,576 --> 00:35:55,307
You<i>'</i>re in a terrible situation.
Your happiness is destroyed.

512
00:35:55,547 --> 00:35:57,708
But if you kill the lover...

513
00:35:58,984 --> 00:36:01,452
your happiness will be doubly destroyed.

514
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,249
The pain you have suffered...

515
00:36:03,321 --> 00:36:06,381
will be compounded
by the pain you have caused.

516
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:09,723
lt all turns on the question,
do you have to do it?

517
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:13,287
Do you feel so injured, insulted, incensed...

518
00:36:13,698 --> 00:36:16,223
that one of you must die, he or you?

519
00:36:16,735 --> 00:36:18,532
ls that the position?

520
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,369
l don<i>'</i>t know.

521
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:22,066
You have to know.

522
00:36:23,175 --> 00:36:25,166
No, that<i>'</i>s not how it is.

523
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:38,188
<i>How is it then?</i>

524
00:36:38,256 --> 00:36:39,780
<i>The thing is...</i>

525
00:36:40,225 --> 00:36:42,193
<i>I'm desperateIy unhappy.</i>

526
00:36:42,394 --> 00:36:45,192
<i>I've been injured and shamefuIIy deceived.</i>

527
00:36:45,263 --> 00:36:46,821
<i>NevertheIess...</i>

528
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:50,957
<i>I harbour no feeIings of hatred.</i>
<i>I don't even thirst for revenge.</i>

529
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,897
And if l ask myself why not...

530
00:36:53,972 --> 00:36:56,873
all l can say is, the time that has passed.

531
00:36:57,509 --> 00:37:00,342
People always talk about inexpiable guilt.

532
00:37:00,445 --> 00:37:03,846
ln God<i>'</i>s eyes, that is wrong,
and in man<i>'</i>s eyes, too.

533
00:37:04,883 --> 00:37:08,842
l would never have believed
that time could have such an effect.

534
00:37:09,955 --> 00:37:11,479
What is more...

535
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,214
l love my wife.

536
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:16,994
Strange as it may seem, l still love her...

537
00:37:17,229 --> 00:37:19,754
and however terrible l find these things...

538
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:22,561
<i>I am so captivated by her good nature...</i>

539
00:37:22,634 --> 00:37:24,727
<i>and her own serene charm...</i>

540
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:28,938
<i>that, in spite of myseIf,</i>
<i>in my heart of hearts...</i>

541
00:37:29,007 --> 00:37:31,134
<i>I'm incIined to forgive her.</i>

542
00:37:31,476 --> 00:37:35,207
Can understand you entirely.
Might feel the same way myself.

543
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:39,411
But if that<i>'</i>s how you feel, and you say:

544
00:37:39,484 --> 00:37:42,942
<i>''</i>l love this woman so much
l can forgive everything<i>''...</i>

545
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:46,722
and if one considers
that this happened long, long ago...

546
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:49,316
like something on a distant star...

547
00:37:50,495 --> 00:37:53,464
if that<i>'</i>s the case, lnnstetten, l ask you...

548
00:37:56,768 --> 00:37:58,497
does it have to be?

549
00:37:59,971 --> 00:38:01,836
What<i>'</i>s the good of it?

550
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,701
lt has to be done.

551
00:38:04,543 --> 00:38:06,636
l<i>'</i>ve looked at it all ways.

552
00:38:07,212 --> 00:38:10,773
One does not live alone.
One is part of a larger whole.

553
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:13,545
And we always have
to bear the whole in mind.

554
00:38:13,618 --> 00:38:15,882
We are entirely dependent on it.

555
00:38:15,954 --> 00:38:19,117
lf l lived in isolation,
l could drop the matter.

556
00:38:19,524 --> 00:38:22,186
l would bear the burden assigned to me.

557
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,728
My happiness would be over, but...

558
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,624
so many have to live without happiness...

559
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:30,497
and l would have to as well, and l could.

560
00:38:30,635 --> 00:38:32,865
One does not have to be happy.

561
00:38:32,971 --> 00:38:35,531
Least of all, one has a right to be.

562
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:39,035
One wouldn<i>'</i>t need to remove
from the world the person...

563
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,578
who has robbed us of our happiness.

564
00:38:41,646 --> 00:38:43,136
One could also...

565
00:38:43,214 --> 00:38:46,672
let him go free,
if one turned one<i>'</i>s back on the world.

566
00:38:48,753 --> 00:38:49,913
But...

567
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:54,288
in living together in society,
a certain something has evolved.

568
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,054
lt simply exists...

569
00:38:56,127 --> 00:38:59,654
and we<i>'</i>re accustomed
to judging everything by its rules.

570
00:39:00,031 --> 00:39:01,293
Others...

571
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:02,956
and ourselves.

572
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:05,561
One cannot contravene them...

573
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:07,537
<i>without society despising us.</i>

574
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:10,473
<i>We wouId come to despise ourseIves, too...</i>

575
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:13,366
<i>and uItimateIy bIow our brains out.</i>

576
00:39:15,046 --> 00:39:18,504
Forgive my holding forth like this
and merely saying...

577
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:22,314
what everyone has said
to himself a hundred times.

578
00:39:22,954 --> 00:39:24,319
But then...

579
00:39:24,556 --> 00:39:26,888
who can really say anything new?

580
00:39:27,392 --> 00:39:28,757
<i>I repeat...</i>

581
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:32,858
<i>it's not a matter of hatred</i>
<i>or personaI happiness.</i>

582
00:39:33,531 --> 00:39:36,830
<i>That tyrannicaI sociaI eIement...</i>

583
00:39:37,535 --> 00:39:40,402
<i>is not concerned with charm or Iove...</i>

584
00:39:40,872 --> 00:39:42,669
<i>or the Iapse of time.</i>

585
00:39:42,907 --> 00:39:44,534
<i>I have no choice.</i>

586
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:46,436
<i>I simpIy have to.</i>

587
00:39:47,345 --> 00:39:49,472
<i>I'm not so sure, Innstetten.</i>

588
00:39:49,714 --> 00:39:51,909
<i>You must decide, WuIIersdorf.</i>

589
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:54,214
<i>It's ten o'cIock now.</i>

590
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,080
<i>Six hours ago, I admit...</i>

591
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,150
<i>I stiII had a free hand.</i>

592
00:40:01,226 --> 00:40:03,717
<i>There was stiII a way out.</i>

593
00:40:04,229 --> 00:40:06,993
<i>But not any Ionger. I'm in a bIind aIIey.</i>

594
00:40:07,065 --> 00:40:09,659
<i>I've onIy myseIf to bIame, you might say.</i>

595
00:40:09,734 --> 00:40:13,670
l should have been more on my guard,
kept everything to myself...

596
00:40:13,738 --> 00:40:15,797
fought it out in my own heart.

597
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:19,810
But it all came too suddenly
for me to give myself the blame...

598
00:40:20,278 --> 00:40:23,247
for not having kept my nerves under control.

599
00:40:23,915 --> 00:40:26,850
l went to your place and wrote you a note...

600
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:29,579
and in doing so relinquished control.

601
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:31,484
From that moment...

602
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,750
someone else was half-aware
of my misfortune...

603
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:38,156
and, more importantly,
of the stain on my honour...

604
00:40:38,963 --> 00:40:42,399
and with this discussion,
that person is now fully aware.

605
00:40:42,467 --> 00:40:44,958
And since there is such a person...

606
00:40:45,036 --> 00:40:46,901
there<i>'</i>s no going back.

607
00:40:49,641 --> 00:40:51,404
<i>I wouIdn't say that.</i>

608
00:40:52,477 --> 00:40:55,674
<i>I don't Iike using trite phrases...</i>

609
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:59,080
<i>but I know no better way of putting it.</i>

610
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:01,749
l<i>'</i>ll be as silent as the grave.

611
00:41:02,287 --> 00:41:04,778
That<i>'</i>s what people always say.

612
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:08,256
But there<i>'</i>s no such thing as secrecy.

613
00:41:08,326 --> 00:41:11,056
You may be the soul of discretion...

614
00:41:11,896 --> 00:41:13,454
but you know about it...

615
00:41:13,531 --> 00:41:17,831
and the fact that you express
your consent and understanding...

616
00:41:17,902 --> 00:41:19,961
does not save me from you.

617
00:41:20,472 --> 00:41:22,235
l am, and l remain...

618
00:41:22,574 --> 00:41:25,634
from this moment on,
an object of your sympathy.

619
00:41:26,044 --> 00:41:30,037
Every word you hear me say to my wife
is subject to your control.

620
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:34,279
lf my wife talks about being faithful...

621
00:41:34,352 --> 00:41:36,047
or, as women do...

622
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:38,687
sits in judgement over others...

623
00:41:38,823 --> 00:41:40,950
l shan<i>'</i>t know where to look.

624
00:41:41,526 --> 00:41:43,289
Or suppose l urge...

625
00:41:43,394 --> 00:41:46,227
reconciliation in some
everyday affair of honour...

626
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:48,731
because no ill intent is involved.

627
00:41:49,334 --> 00:41:51,666
A smile will cross your face...

628
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:53,930
or it will twitch, at least...

629
00:41:54,706 --> 00:41:58,039
and in your heart you<i>'</i>ll say,
<i>''</i>Good old lnnstetten...

630
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:03,344
<i>''</i>has a passion for analysing
the chemical content of all insults...

<i>''</i>He can swallow anything<i>.''</i>

633
00:42:12,557 --> 00:42:14,821
Am l right, or not?

634
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:21,530
lt<i>'</i>s a terrible thought, but you<i>'</i>re right.

635
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:25,629
l<i>'</i>ll stop asking, <i>''</i>Does it have to be?<i>''</i>

636
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:28,466
The world is as it is.

637
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:32,374
Things don<i>'</i>t work out as we want them to,
but as others want.

638
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:35,571
All that talk about divine punishment...

639
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:38,138
is nonsense, of course.

640
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,911
On the contrary...

641
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:44,185
our cult of honour is idolatry...

642
00:42:46,057 --> 00:42:49,185
but we have to submit to it,
as long as the idol stands.

643
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:33,829
Crampas wishes
to speak with you, lnnstetten.

644
00:43:33,905 --> 00:43:37,363
Grant him his wish.
He has only a few minutes to live.

645
00:44:00,498 --> 00:44:01,897

THERE lS A LOGlC TO THAT.

648
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:38,666
BUT THE lDEA OF A TlME LlMlTATlON

649
00:44:38,736 --> 00:44:41,261
lS A TERRlBLE HALF-MEASURE.

650

-How is Annie?
-She<i>'</i>s well, sir.

651
00:44:45,476 --> 00:44:48,536

-No, that<i>'</i>ll only excite her.

652
00:44:48,613 --> 00:44:50,911
-Who was here?
-Only the doctor.

653
00:44:51,449 --> 00:44:53,246
<i>''Arrived back this morning.</i>

<i>''I'II see you tomorrow. Yours, W.''</i>

663
00:45:21,512 --> 00:45:23,537
Another thing, Johanna...

664
00:45:25,783 --> 00:45:28,115
my wife will not be coming back.

665
00:45:32,991 --> 00:45:35,425
You will find out why from others.

666
00:45:36,461 --> 00:45:38,452
Annie should not be told.

667
00:45:38,696 --> 00:45:40,926
Not yet, at least, poor child!

668
00:45:41,933 --> 00:45:45,096
Break it to her gradually
that she has no mother.

669

675

677

The things these papers write!

691
00:46:48,866 --> 00:46:49,855
Yes...

692
00:46:49,934 --> 00:46:51,697
and people read it...

693
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:54,499
and say nasty things about my mistress.

694
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:57,337
And the poor major<i>'</i>s dead, too.

695

-Should the master be dead instead?
-No, Johanna.

696
00:47:01,813 --> 00:47:04,748
Our master should live.
Everyone should live.

697
00:47:05,283 --> 00:47:07,046
But don<i>'</i>t forget...

698
00:47:07,185 --> 00:47:09,312
it all happened so long ago.

699
00:47:09,654 --> 00:47:11,986
The letters are yellow with age.

<i>She sought Iodgings in a boarding house</i>
<i>with reasonabIe success.</i>

722
00:48:42,446 --> 00:48:46,576
Do you remember how Gieshuebler came
and had to join us at table...

723
00:48:47,818 --> 00:48:51,276
and said he<i>'</i>d never eaten
anything so delicious?

724
00:48:54,192 --> 00:48:56,490
He was always so well-mannered.

725
00:48:57,695 --> 00:49:01,495
ln fact, he was the only person
who knew anything about food.

726
00:49:03,134 --> 00:49:05,659
The others said everything was nice.

727
00:49:17,348 --> 00:49:19,339
Have you thought it over?

728
00:49:22,053 --> 00:49:24,544
You<i>'</i>ve had it good all these years.

729
00:49:25,523 --> 00:49:27,491
There was always enough.

730
00:49:28,793 --> 00:49:31,660
We never had to think about saving.

731
00:49:34,065 --> 00:49:36,192
But now l have to economize.

732
00:49:37,602 --> 00:49:38,933
l am poor.

733
00:49:40,304 --> 00:49:43,671
All l have is what l receive
from Hohen-Cremmen.

734
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:48,210
My parents are very good to me...

as far as their means allow...

736
00:49:51,682 --> 00:49:53,650

What do you say?

738
00:49:59,257 --> 00:50:02,351
May l move in next Saturday
with my suitcase?

739
00:50:04,428 --> 00:50:06,055
Not in the evening.

740
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:10,089
ln the morning, so as to be here
when you arrange the household.

l<i>'</i>m more robust than you are, ma<i>'</i>am.

Don<i>'</i>t say that, Roswitha. l can do it.

743
00:50:30,154 --> 00:50:32,384
One can do anything if one has to.

744
00:50:32,456 --> 00:50:35,823
And you needn<i>'</i>t worry about me.

745
00:50:37,194 --> 00:50:39,162
As if l could ever think:

746

<i>''</i>That<i>'</i>s not good enough for Roswitha<i>.''</i>

747

For Roswitha, everything is good...

748
00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:47,633
that she can share with you...

749
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:51,904
and most of all the sad things.

750
00:51:00,985 --> 00:51:02,748

<i>It was very hot...</i>

759

<i>and the curtains, fIapping to and fro</i>

761
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:35,818
<i>She Ieaned back in the corner...</i>

762

<i>bIue, with bobs and tasseIs.</i>

<i>The third was dark and serious.</i>

767
00:51:53,037 --> 00:51:54,402
<i>It was Annie.</i>

768
00:51:54,472 --> 00:51:58,306

<i>which she had Iong desired...</i>

770
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:04,010
<i>now fiIIed her with mortaI fear.</i>
<i>What shouId she do?</i>

771
00:52:04,448 --> 00:52:09,010
<i>She opened the door to the front pIatform,</i>

772
00:52:09,286 --> 00:52:12,813

773
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:15,781
<i>''Not aIIowed, miss, '' the driver said...</i>

774
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:19,091

<i>but aII right, just this once.''</i>

777
00:52:26,871 --> 00:52:30,466
<i>And he removed the grating,</i>
<i>and Effi jumped down.</i>

778
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:34,844
She<i>'</i>s half one and half the other.

779
00:52:35,112 --> 00:52:38,513
ln her prettiness, her specialness...

780
00:52:39,216 --> 00:52:41,411
she takes after her mother...

781
00:52:41,552 --> 00:52:43,816
but she has her seriousness...

782
00:52:44,021 --> 00:52:45,579
from her father.

783
00:52:45,656 --> 00:52:49,422
All things considered,
she<i>'</i>s probably more like the master.

784
00:52:51,362 --> 00:52:52,886
Thank goodness!

785
00:52:54,832 --> 00:52:57,630
Well, ma<i>'</i>am, that<i>'</i>s the question.

786
00:52:58,302 --> 00:53:01,169
Many would be more
in favour of the mother.

787
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,440
You think so, Roswitha?

788
00:53:04,842 --> 00:53:06,070
l don<i>'</i>t.

789
00:53:07,211 --> 00:53:09,907
You can<i>'</i>t pull the wool over my eyes...

790
00:53:11,248 --> 00:53:15,275
and l think my mistress knows
the truth of the matter...

791
00:53:15,953 --> 00:53:17,944
and what men really want.

792
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:22,983
Let<i>'</i>s not talk about that, Roswitha!

793
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,492
<i>Effi was oppressed by the notion...</i>

794
00:53:25,596 --> 00:53:28,224
<i>of having run away from her own chiId.</i>

795
00:53:30,868 --> 00:53:34,736
<i>''</i>l<i>'</i>m delighted to be able
to tell you the good news.

796
00:53:35,339 --> 00:53:39,503
<i>''</i>lt worked out as we hoped.
Your husband is a man of the world...

797
00:53:39,577 --> 00:53:43,138
<i>''</i>and would not refuse a lady<i>'</i>s request.

798
00:53:43,881 --> 00:53:47,544
<i>''</i>At the same time,
l should not conceal the fact from you.

799
00:53:47,852 --> 00:53:51,049
<i>''</i>His consent was evidently
not in accordance...

800
00:53:51,121 --> 00:53:53,555
<i>''</i>with what he considered wise and proper.

801
00:53:53,624 --> 00:53:56,718
<i>''</i>But let<i>'</i>s not find fault
when we should be rejoicing.

802
00:53:56,794 --> 00:54:00,662
<i>''</i>lt was agreed that your Annie
should visit you at lunch time.

803
00:54:00,865 --> 00:54:04,062
<i>''</i>May your reunion
stand under a lucky star<i>.''</i>

804
00:54:05,269 --> 00:54:09,603
<i>One makes the bed one Iies on,</i>
<i>and I wish to change nothing in my Iife.</i>

805
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:13,433
<i>It is right as it is. It was my own doing.</i>

806
00:54:14,345 --> 00:54:17,314
<i>But the situation with my chiId is too hard.</i>

807
00:54:17,381 --> 00:54:19,849
<i>I wish to see her from time to time...</i>

808
00:54:19,917 --> 00:54:22,010
<i>not furtiveIy or in secret...</i>

809
00:54:22,086 --> 00:54:24,987
<i>but with the consent of aII those concerned.</i>

810
00:54:33,297 --> 00:54:35,731
Annie, darling, how glad l am.

811
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,132
Come and tell me about yourself!

812
00:54:48,879 --> 00:54:50,506
How you<i>'</i>ve grown!

813
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,383
And that<i>'</i>s the scar?

814
00:55:00,024 --> 00:55:02,049
Roswitha told me about it.

815
00:55:02,259 --> 00:55:05,023
You were always so wild when you played.

816
00:55:06,096 --> 00:55:08,621
You take after your mother in that.

817
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:10,564
She was just the same.

818
00:55:12,102 --> 00:55:14,093
How are things at school?

819
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,707
You look as if you were
always first in your class...

820
00:55:20,811 --> 00:55:22,335
a model pupil...

821
00:55:22,413 --> 00:55:24,711
who always has the best grades.

822
00:55:27,117 --> 00:55:29,813
-What are you best at?
-l don<i>'</i>t know.

823
00:55:30,654 --> 00:55:32,645
Oh, you must know.

824
00:55:33,357 --> 00:55:35,120
Everyone knows that.

825
00:55:36,026 --> 00:55:38,460
What do you get the best marks in?

826
00:55:38,596 --> 00:55:42,157
-ln religious instruction.
-There, you see. You do know.

827
00:55:43,634 --> 00:55:45,033
That<i>'</i>s good.

828
00:55:46,804 --> 00:55:48,931
l wasn<i>'</i>t so good at that...

829
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:53,437
but that may have been the teacher.
We only had an ordinand.

830
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:55,478
We had an ordinand, too.

831
00:55:57,348 --> 00:55:58,940
Has he left now?

832
00:55:59,283 --> 00:56:00,875
Why did he leave?

833
00:56:00,951 --> 00:56:03,920
l don<i>'</i>t know.
We have the preacher again now.

834
00:56:03,988 --> 00:56:05,421
Whom you all like?

835
00:56:05,489 --> 00:56:08,686
Yes. Two girls in the first class
want to convert.

836
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,119
l see.

837
00:56:10,694 --> 00:56:12,093
That<i>'</i>s good.

838
00:56:13,831 --> 00:56:15,458
And how is Johanna?

839
00:56:15,532 --> 00:56:17,500
Johanna brought me here.

840
00:56:17,568 --> 00:56:20,230
l shouldn<i>'</i>t keep her waiting too long.

841
00:56:24,208 --> 00:56:27,735
You<i>'</i>re very considerate,
and l suppose l should be glad.

842
00:56:29,613 --> 00:56:32,446
lt<i>'</i>s all a matter of apportioning things.

843
00:56:33,484 --> 00:56:35,475
Now tell me how Rollo is.

844
00:56:35,719 --> 00:56:37,186
Rollo<i>'</i>s very well.

845
00:56:37,254 --> 00:56:41,384
But Papa says he<i>'</i>s getting lazy,
always lying in the sun.

846
00:56:41,792 --> 00:56:45,558
l can believe it.
He was like that when you were very young.

847
00:56:47,831 --> 00:56:49,458
Tell me, Annie...

848
00:56:51,101 --> 00:56:54,537
-will you come and see me often?
-Certainly, if l may.

849
00:56:55,572 --> 00:56:58,769
We could go for a stroll
in Prince Albert Gardens.

850
00:56:58,842 --> 00:57:00,605
Certainly, if l may.

851
00:57:02,179 --> 00:57:04,875
Or go to Schilling<i>'</i>s and eat ice cream.

852
00:57:05,582 --> 00:57:08,312
Pineapple and vanilla were your favourites.

853
00:57:08,385 --> 00:57:10,148
Certainly, if l may.

854
00:57:10,888 --> 00:57:13,220
l think it<i>'</i>s time for you to go.

855
00:57:13,857 --> 00:57:16,291
Johanna will be getting impatient.

856
00:57:18,762 --> 00:57:21,697
Roswitha, go with Annie
as far as the church!

857
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,768
Johanna<i>'</i>s waiting there.

858
00:57:27,604 --> 00:57:30,698
Let<i>'</i>s hope she hasn<i>'</i>t caught cold.

859
00:57:36,113 --> 00:57:38,206
Give my regards to Johanna.

860
00:57:45,055 --> 00:57:48,957
Oh, God in heaven,
forgive me for what l<i>'</i>ve done!

861
00:57:49,026 --> 00:57:50,516
l was a child.

862
00:57:52,029 --> 00:57:54,224
No, l wasn<i>'</i>t a child anymore.

863
00:57:55,399 --> 00:57:58,163
l was old enough to know what l was doing.

864
00:57:58,235 --> 00:58:00,669
l don<i>'</i>t want to diminish my guilt.

865
00:58:01,705 --> 00:58:03,502
But this is too much!

866
00:58:05,342 --> 00:58:07,833
What is happening with the child...

867
00:58:09,146 --> 00:58:12,206
is not You, God, punishing me. lt is he...

868
00:58:14,118 --> 00:58:15,585
and he alone.

869
00:58:17,654 --> 00:58:21,021
And l thought he had a noble heart!

870
00:58:22,426 --> 00:58:25,259
l always felt small beside him.

871
00:58:27,231 --> 00:58:29,256
But now l know it<i>'</i>s he...

872
00:58:31,635 --> 00:58:33,535
who is small and petty.

873
00:58:34,371 --> 00:58:36,862
And because he<i>'</i>s petty, he<i>'</i>s cruel.

874
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:40,441
Everything that<i>'</i>s petty is cruel.

875
00:58:42,646 --> 00:58:45,376
He taught the child to behave like that.

876
00:58:49,019 --> 00:58:51,214
He was always a schoolmaster.

877
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:56,124
That<i>'</i>s what Crampas called him...

878
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:59,224
sarcastically perhaps, but he was right.

879
00:59:02,866 --> 00:59:04,731
<i>''</i>Certainly, if l may<i>''</i>!

880
00:59:07,771 --> 00:59:10,706
You don<i>'</i>t have to ask if you <i>''</i>may<i>''</i> anymore.

881
00:59:12,042 --> 00:59:14,135
l don<i>'</i>t want either of you.

882
00:59:15,212 --> 00:59:16,873
l hate you both...

883
00:59:17,781 --> 00:59:19,612
even my own child.

884
00:59:21,018 --> 00:59:23,179
Too much is too much!

885
00:59:26,623 --> 00:59:28,523
He was ambitious...

886
00:59:29,927 --> 00:59:31,554
and that was all.

887
00:59:32,763 --> 00:59:34,663
Honour, honour, honour...

888
00:59:35,732 --> 00:59:40,066
and then he shoots the poor man dead,
whom l didn<i>'</i>t even love.

889
00:59:41,638 --> 00:59:43,606
Nothing but stupidity...

890
00:59:45,342 --> 00:59:47,003
and then blood...

891
00:59:48,278 --> 00:59:49,643
and murder.

892
00:59:50,647 --> 00:59:52,274
And l<i>'</i>m to blame.

893
00:59:54,218 --> 00:59:56,311
Now he sends me my child...

894
00:59:57,054 --> 00:59:59,989
because he can<i>'</i>t refuse a minister<i>'</i>s wife.

895
01:00:01,491 --> 01:00:05,552
But before he sends her,
he trains her to answer like a parrot...

896
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:08,790
and teaches her to say, <i>''</i>lf l may<i>.''</i>

897
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,130
What l did disgusts me...

898
01:00:13,003 --> 01:00:16,063
but your virtuousness
disgusts me even more.

899
01:00:17,107 --> 01:00:19,075
Be gone the pair of you!

900
01:00:19,309 --> 01:00:21,334
l have to go on living...

901
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:29,118
but it won<i>'</i>t be forever.

902
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:34,384
Ma<i>'</i>am!

903
01:01:17,434 --> 01:01:19,766
<i>When RummschuetteI was caIIed...</i>

904
01:01:19,836 --> 01:01:22,236
<i>he was concerned about Effi's condition.</i>

905
01:01:22,306 --> 01:01:25,469
<i>The hectic state</i>
<i>he had observed for some time...</i>

906
01:01:25,542 --> 01:01:28,033
<i>seemed more pronounced than before.</i>

907
01:01:29,546 --> 01:01:32,014
<i>''But it must be at Hohen-Cremmen.</i>

908

<i>''She's pining away. AII she has is Roswitha.</i>

912

<i>''that are no concern of a doctor.</i>

913
01:01:49,433 --> 01:01:52,664
<i>''And yet, it is as a doctor</i>

915

916
01:01:58,709 --> 01:02:02,577
...l love her at least as much as you do.
Each in his own way.

917
01:02:02,879 --> 01:02:06,337
But we<i>'</i>re not here just to be
kind and understanding...

918
01:02:06,416 --> 01:02:09,908
towards things that are
against laws and commandments...

919
01:02:09,987 --> 01:02:12,285
and that society condemns...

920
01:02:12,356 --> 01:02:15,018
and rightly condemns at present.

921
01:02:15,492 --> 01:02:19,826
-One thing counts above all else.
-Of course one thing really counts.

922
01:02:19,896 --> 01:02:21,420
But what is it?

923
01:02:24,234 --> 01:02:26,930
The love of parents for their children.

924
01:02:27,037 --> 01:02:29,062
Even if there<i>'</i>s only one.

925

928

933
01:03:18,255 --> 01:03:20,849
<i>wouId inherit Hohen-Cremmen.</i>

934
01:03:22,125 --> 01:03:26,425
<i>Effi's spirits revived, and her mother,</i>
<i>who was not averse...</i>

935
01:03:26,496 --> 01:03:31,399
<i>to regarding the matter</i>
<i>as an interesting, but painfuI, incident...</i>

936
01:03:31,701 --> 01:03:36,138
<i>vied with her husband in showering</i>
<i>Iove and attention on their daughter.</i>

937
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,577
lTlS STRANGE,

938
01:03:44,648 --> 01:03:46,445
BUT MANY THlNGS lN MY LlFE

939
01:03:46,516 --> 01:03:48,245
MlGHT APTL Y BE DESCRlBED

940
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:50,013
WlTH THE WORD <i>''</i>ALMOST<i>.''</i>

941
01:03:59,329 --> 01:04:00,921
Pastor Niemeyer!

942
01:04:02,866 --> 01:04:06,063
Effi! You<i>'</i>re the same as ever!

943
01:04:08,004 --> 01:04:09,198
No, no.

944
01:04:13,443 --> 01:04:15,638
That all belongs to the past.

945
01:04:16,613 --> 01:04:19,241
l just wanted to try it out once more.

946
01:04:22,452 --> 01:04:24,249
How wonderful it was!

947
01:04:26,356 --> 01:04:28,324
How stimulating the air!

948
01:04:29,693 --> 01:04:32,025
lt was like flying up to heaven.

949
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,465
Shall l ever go there?

950
01:04:40,704 --> 01:04:43,332
Tell me, dear friend. You should know.

951
01:04:44,274 --> 01:04:46,037
-Please!
-Yes, Effi.

952
01:04:49,246 --> 01:04:50,508
You will.

953
01:05:04,861 --> 01:05:07,329
lMPERlAL OFFlCE OF THE lNTERlOR

954
01:05:07,397 --> 01:05:09,194
DEAR lNNSTETTEN,

955
01:05:09,266 --> 01:05:11,962
l HAVE THE PLEASURE OFlNFORMlNG YOU

956
01:05:12,035 --> 01:05:14,469
THAT HlS MAJESTY HAS CONSENTED

957
01:05:14,538 --> 01:05:16,472
TO YOUR APPOlNTMENT.

958
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:18,770
MY SlNCERE CONGRATULATlONS.

959
01:05:21,344 --> 01:05:24,541
<i>''</i>l<i>'</i>m afraid, Roswitha,
because l<i>'</i>m all alone here.

960
01:05:24,781 --> 01:05:27,545
<i>''</i>But who should accompany me?
Rollo? Yes.

961
01:05:27,751 --> 01:05:31,551
<i>''</i>He bears me no grudge.
That<i>'</i>s the good thing about animals.

962
01:05:32,255 --> 01:05:35,782
<i>''</i>Those were my mistress<i>'</i>s words.
l<i>'</i>ll say no more.

963
01:05:36,259 --> 01:05:40,992
<i>''</i>Please remember me to little Annie
and to Johanna as well.

964
01:05:41,665 --> 01:05:43,599
<i>''</i>Your obedient servant...

965
01:05:43,733 --> 01:05:45,633
<i>''</i>Roswitha Gellenhagen<i>.''</i>

966
01:05:47,604 --> 01:05:50,038
We could learn something from her.

967
01:05:52,542 --> 01:05:54,134
l think so, too.

968
01:05:56,713 --> 01:06:00,376
That<i>'</i>s why everything else
seems so questionable to you.

969
01:06:03,386 --> 01:06:06,947
lt<i>'</i>s been on my mind a long time,
and these simple words...

970
01:06:07,023 --> 01:06:08,820
with their conscious...

971
01:06:08,892 --> 01:06:11,656
or perhaps unconscious
hint of accusation...

972
01:06:11,728 --> 01:06:13,923
have completely unsettled me.

973
01:06:15,165 --> 01:06:17,793
lt<i>'</i>s been tormenting me for some time.

974
01:06:17,934 --> 01:06:20,926
l want to free myself of this whole business.

975
01:06:21,037 --> 01:06:23,471
Nothing gives me pleasure anymore.

976
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:27,699
The more distinctions l gain,
the more meaningless it all seems.

977
01:06:29,746 --> 01:06:31,646
l<i>'</i>ve messed up my life.

978
01:06:35,318 --> 01:06:40,119
<i>May was IoveIy. June even IoveIier.</i>
<i>Once Effi had overcome the heartache...</i>

979
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:43,682
<i>RoIIo's arrivaI aroused in her...</i>

980
01:06:44,027 --> 01:06:47,656
<i>she was deIighted to have</i>
<i>the faithfuI creature with her again.</i>

981
01:06:47,731 --> 01:06:51,462
<i>Roswitha was praised,</i>
<i>and Briest expressed to his wife...</i>

982
01:06:51,534 --> 01:06:53,832
<i>his respect for Innstetten...</i>

983
01:06:53,903 --> 01:06:56,599
<i>who was a perfect gentIeman, not petty...</i>

984
01:06:56,673 --> 01:06:59,369
<i>and whose heart was in the right pIace.</i>

985
01:06:59,542 --> 01:07:02,272
<i>''A pity that stupid affair had to happen!</i>

986
01:07:02,545 --> 01:07:04,843
<i>''They were the perfect coupIe.''</i>

987
01:07:12,522 --> 01:07:14,422
What a glorious summer!

988
01:07:15,759 --> 01:07:19,752
l should never have thought
a year ago that l could be so happy.

989
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:22,393
Just get well again!

990
01:07:22,899 --> 01:07:26,357
Happiness will come.
Not past happiness, but a new one.

991
01:07:27,037 --> 01:07:29,301
There are many types of happiness.

992
01:07:29,372 --> 01:07:32,341
You<i>'</i>ll see, we<i>'</i>ll find something for you.

993
01:07:33,109 --> 01:07:34,872
<i>The summer passed...</i>

994
01:07:34,944 --> 01:07:37,674
<i>and the nights with</i>
<i>shooting stars were over.</i>

995
01:07:37,747 --> 01:07:41,114
<i>On these nights,</i>
<i>Effi had sat Iong at her window...</i>

996
01:07:41,184 --> 01:07:43,152
<i>never tired of watching.</i>

997
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:47,918
<i>''I never was a very good Christian,</i>
<i>but perhaps we do come from up there...</i>

998
01:07:48,258 --> 01:07:51,955
<i>''and when it's aII over here,</i>
<i>we'II return to our heavenIy home...</i>

999
01:07:52,028 --> 01:07:54,394
<i>''to the stars up there, or beyond.</i>

1000
01:07:54,464 --> 01:07:57,160
<i>''I don't know, and I don't want to know.</i>

1001
01:07:57,233 --> 01:07:59,428
<i>''I simpIy feeI a Ionging....''</i>

1002
01:08:00,437 --> 01:08:02,769
You wanted to tell me something.

1003
01:08:03,173 --> 01:08:06,802
Yes, because you spoke
of my being still very young.

1004
01:08:08,311 --> 01:08:11,508
Of course l<i>'</i>m young.
But that makes no difference.

1005
01:08:13,016 --> 01:08:16,747
ln happier days, lnnstetten
would read to me in the evening.

1006
01:08:17,754 --> 01:08:19,745
He had some fine books...

1007
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:23,188
and in one of them there was the story...

1008
01:08:23,293 --> 01:08:26,854
of a man being called away
from a festive table.

1009
01:08:28,098 --> 01:08:30,692
On the following day, the man asked...

1010
01:08:30,767 --> 01:08:33,201
what had happened after he<i>'</i>d left.

1011
01:08:34,604 --> 01:08:36,595
He received the reply:

1012
01:08:37,574 --> 01:08:39,667
<i>''</i>Oh, all sorts of things...

1013
01:08:39,743 --> 01:08:42,371
<i>''</i>but you didn<i>'</i>t really miss anything<i>.''</i>

1014
01:08:44,748 --> 01:08:47,649
You see, Mama,
those words stuck in my mind.

1015
01:08:49,686 --> 01:08:54,180
lt doesn<i>'</i>t matter if one<i>'</i>s called away
from the table earlier than others.

1016
01:08:58,461 --> 01:09:02,056
And since l mentioned
old times and lnnstetten...

1017
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,898
l must tell you something else.

1018
01:09:06,136 --> 01:09:08,434
You<i>'</i>re exciting yourself, Effi.

1019
01:09:09,305 --> 01:09:11,967
No. Getting something off one<i>'</i>s mind...

1020
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:14,441
doesn<i>'</i>t excite one. lt<i>'</i>s calming.

1021
01:09:18,248 --> 01:09:20,443
l wanted to tell you, Mama...

1022
01:09:21,451 --> 01:09:24,511
l shall die reconciled
with God and mankind...

1023
01:09:25,255 --> 01:09:26,745
with him, too.

1024
01:09:27,524 --> 01:09:31,358
Did you feel such bitterness
in your heart towards him?

1025
01:09:32,162 --> 01:09:33,527
ln a way...

1026
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:36,125
forgive my saying this now...

1027
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:39,768
you really brought
these sorrows on yourself.

1028
01:09:40,437 --> 01:09:42,268
Yes, sadly enough.

1029
01:09:44,707 --> 01:09:46,868
But when misfortune befell me...

1030
01:09:46,943 --> 01:09:50,106
and finally there was
that business with Annie...

1031
01:09:51,915 --> 01:09:53,143
then...

1032
01:09:54,083 --> 01:09:56,711
if l may use the absurd expression...

1033
01:09:57,086 --> 01:09:59,316
l simply turned the tables...

1034
01:10:01,791 --> 01:10:05,420
and convinced myself he was to blame...

1035
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:12,024
because he was sober and calculating
and cruel, too, in the end.

1036
01:10:15,071 --> 01:10:17,631
l cursed him.

1037
01:10:19,142 --> 01:10:21,736
And now it weighs on your conscience?

1038
01:10:22,445 --> 01:10:24,675
Yes, and l want him to know...

1039
01:10:26,349 --> 01:10:28,943
that during the days l<i>'</i>ve been ill...

1040
01:10:30,687 --> 01:10:34,179
which have been almost
the loveliest days of my life...

1041
01:10:36,326 --> 01:10:38,089
l<i>'</i>ve come to see...

1042
01:10:39,629 --> 01:10:41,961
that he was right in everything.

1043
01:10:43,533 --> 01:10:46,525
ln the matter concerning
poor Major Crampas...

1044
01:10:48,538 --> 01:10:50,733
what else could he have done?

1045
01:10:53,343 --> 01:10:56,073
The thing with which he hurt me most...

1046
01:10:58,615 --> 01:11:00,480
was the way he raised...

1047
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:02,541
my own child against me.

1048
01:11:05,288 --> 01:11:07,722
But as much as it grieves me...

1049
01:11:08,224 --> 01:11:10,351
as hard as it affects me...

1050
01:11:12,161 --> 01:11:14,186
he was right in that, too.

1051
01:11:19,002 --> 01:11:22,062
Let him know l died convinced of that.

1052
01:11:24,407 --> 01:11:28,309
lt will console him, give him new heart,
reconcile him perhaps.

1053
01:11:31,514 --> 01:11:34,483
For there was a lot of good in his nature...

1054
01:11:36,753 --> 01:11:39,654
and he was as fine a man
as anyone can be...

1055
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:42,683
who doesn<i>'</i>t know true love.

1056
01:11:47,864 --> 01:11:51,595
<i>A smaII change had occurred</i>
<i>in the circuIar fIowerbed.</i>

1057
01:11:51,834 --> 01:11:55,497
<i>The sundiaI was gone,</i>
<i>and its pIace had been taken...</i>

1058
01:11:55,905 --> 01:11:58,203
<i>by a white marbIe sIab...</i>

1059
01:11:58,441 --> 01:12:01,171
<i>which bore onIy the words ''Effi Briest''...</i>

1060
01:12:01,244 --> 01:12:04,873
<i>with a cross beneath.</i>
<i>That was Effi's Iast request.</i>

1061
01:12:05,315 --> 01:12:08,478
<i>''I'd Iike to have</i>
<i>my oId name on my gravestone...</i>

1062
01:12:08,585 --> 01:12:10,951
<i>''I did no honour to my other name.''</i>

1063
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:13,147
<i>And her request was granted.</i>

1064
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:16,982
Look, Briest...

1065
01:12:17,327 --> 01:12:19,727
Rollo<i>'</i>s lying by the stone again.

1066
01:12:20,797 --> 01:12:23,527
lt has affected him more deeply than us.

1067
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:26,398
He won<i>'</i>t eat a thing.

1068
01:12:27,937 --> 01:12:30,497
Yes, Luise, these creatures!

1069
01:12:31,274 --> 01:12:33,401
That<i>'</i>s what l always say...

1070
01:12:35,645 --> 01:12:38,170
we<i>'</i>re not as remarkable as we think.

1071
01:12:40,016 --> 01:12:42,041
We talk about instinct...

1072
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:46,245
and in the end, it<i>'</i>s the best thing.

1073
01:12:49,859 --> 01:12:53,158
Not a day has passed,
since she was buried there...

1074
01:12:53,563 --> 01:12:56,828
-without these questions arising.
-What questions?

1075
01:12:57,934 --> 01:13:00,425
Whether we<i>'</i>re not perhaps to blame?

1076
01:13:01,104 --> 01:13:02,696
Nonsense, Luise!

1077
01:13:02,839 --> 01:13:04,466
What do you mean?

1078
01:13:06,542 --> 01:13:09,841
Whether we shouldn<i>'</i>t
have been stricter with her.

1079
01:13:11,381 --> 01:13:12,905
We most of all.

1080
01:13:13,383 --> 01:13:15,715
Niemeyer is useless really...

1081
01:13:16,052 --> 01:13:18,646
because he casts doubt on everything.

1082
01:13:19,088 --> 01:13:20,578
And then, Briest...

1083
01:13:20,657 --> 01:13:24,252
l<i>'</i>m sorry to have to say it,
your constant equivocation.

1084
01:13:26,796 --> 01:13:28,696
