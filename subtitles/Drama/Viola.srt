00:00:42,198 --> 00:00:44,116
SEA OF VIOLETS

2
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,158
- My father wanted a boy.

3
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:51,080
- Because a girl is a disgrace worse than death.

4
00:00:51,727 --> 00:00:53,319
- My mother was 15.

5
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,762
- She gave birth with a knife to her the throat

6
00:00:56,727 --> 00:00:58,604
- A cry prolonged indefinitely.

7
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,918
- Then... silence.

8
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:08,240
- I was born, dirty and red
like a just-made quince paste.

9
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:15,526
- I was born, a girl
and you did not kill my mother.

10
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:20,557
- Resigned,
I am. I'm Angela.

11
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:28,880
- Angela, wait!

12
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:33,000
- Tommaso, it's not right!

13
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:41,676
- You run fast!

14
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:44,241
- Angela, walk!

15
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:56,279
- go on, go on!
Come on! What It takes to make this load?

16
00:01:57,567 --> 00:02:00,001
- Rosario!
hold better that rope.

17
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:02,001
- Hold tight.

18
00:02:30,607 --> 00:02:34,282
- Take the one stored.
- But it was for Palermo.

19
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:36,205
- We take that one and that's enough.

20
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:39,320
- The Baron expects the tuff
And we will bring it.

21
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:43,082
- Come with me!

22
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:58,604
- You are always the last!
- What do you want??

23
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,603
- Angela, do you smoke?!

24
00:04:13,727 --> 00:04:14,921
- Where have you been??

25
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,925
- Did you hear me?
Where have you been this time, eh?

26
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:21,840
- Collecting Burarran!
- At this time of the night?!

27
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:24,964
- You hurt me!
- Was it good the cigarette you've been smoking?

28
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:27,842
- If you born man,
you could also smoke,

29
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:30,925
- but your mother made you a girl!
Am I right?!

30
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:33,166
- Am I right or not?!

31
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:37,078
- Come on! You must understand!

32
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:45,241
- Do you understand? UNDERSTAND?
- Father!

33
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:48,200
- Come on, put you down!
- Father!

34
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:51,883
- Then I have to give you, eh?
Don't you understand? - No, no!

35
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:02,321
- "Voscenza benedica"
- Here he is.

36
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:13,001
- You did a a serious damage
- I know.

37
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:16,557
- I swear it will not happen again.
- I don't care what you swear.

38
00:05:16,647 --> 00:05:19,036
- I care that I lost my things

39
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:21,436
- And now you you have to repay.
- But i have nothing.

40
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:24,566
- Only today's salary.
- And for you it's enough?

41
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,881
- today, do a long turn when you come home

42
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:32,439
- And say to your wife
to leave the door open.

43
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:36,076
- I will find for you
a way to pay your debt.

44
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,676
- What is happened?
- My husband think to do all alone to correct her,

45
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:05,961
- with his hands.

46
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:09,239
- Ahi!
- He doesn't have to know that i came here.

47
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:16,564
- Full, she is.
I feel them walking under the skin.

48
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:19,366
- Are you sure?
They are doing like ants.

49
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:24,041
- I wanna feel them too.
- Stop, shut up!

50
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:27,199
- Our father, save the souls of penitents,

51
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,005
press the neck of the unbelievers

52
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:33,803
and save from the fear this your
poor sick daughter.

53
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,157
- Our father, save the souls of penitents,

54
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:39,325
press the neck of the unbelievers

55
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:43,357
and save from the fear this your
poor sick daughter.

56
00:06:43,447 --> 00:06:48,123
dryed the tongue, full of worms the teeth,
flabby flesh, every hair is a snake.

57
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:52,845
eyes burned, poison in her bones.
We are already sitting on your vault.

58
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:05,486
- I wash you with this water, pure like Maria.

59
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:07,285
- Purifies the body and my soul.

60
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:10,916
- I wash my hands like Pilate,
to the jew people you gave him.

61
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:32,280
- Careful! that you hurt him!

62
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:34,762
- You'll see how he runs away,
Nicolino is like an eel.

63
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:38,641
- What did i tell you?

64
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:48,006
- What do you feel?

65
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:52,286
- Nothing, What should i feel?
- The worms.

66
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,363
- The old woman told me I'm full.

67
00:07:56,167 --> 00:08:00,604
- The worms? And where do you have them?
Here, here, here!

68
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:04,436
- Ah!
- What have you done? - No, nothing.

69
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:06,518
- Come on, show me.
- Leave me!

70
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:13,562
- What are you doing?
- I took the prize that I won

71
00:08:19,127 --> 00:08:21,846
- The Burarran and "la gira"
must be cut to the roots

72
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:25,523
- Because inside you feel the ground.
We eat them every night.

73
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,800
- All nights?
- The Curator (her father) eats "grass" every night?

74
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:31,880
- Him, when he find boiled "grass",
he is happy.

75
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:35,323
- He drinks wine together, he faint on bed
and he leaves us in peace.

76
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:42,081
- You see?
With you everything seem easy.

77
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:47,636
- Sara, come, soon!
The Piedmonteses take your father!

78
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:05,881
- Father! Father!

79
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:07,958
- Back!

80
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:11,205
- Sara!
- Stop!

81
00:09:11,447 --> 00:09:13,563
- Father!
- Sara!

82
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:17,880
- Sara! I'm here, Sara!

83
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:20,482
- Sara, I'm here! Sara!

84
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,166
- Stop!
- Sara!

85
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:31,316
- Leave me!

86
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:34,996
- You want to grow old
sitting there, Angela?

87
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:36,966
- Think for yourself, Nicolino.

88
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:40,241
- Sara will be back.

89
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,356
- How much tuff is left? - Few.
- Few months of work, not more.

90
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,364
- And in "Scalo Cavallo"?
- Nothing.

91
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,562
- Also there only dust is coming out.

92
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:59,397
- What do you say?
- I say that the Baron expect another reply

93
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:02,200
- These are the facts

94
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:05,638
- We look for the "Facts".

95
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:45,396
- Sara!

96
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,196
- Angela!

97
00:11:57,447 --> 00:12:01,201
- It seems yesterday we were children.
- I'm happy you are back.

98
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:05,322
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

99
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:10,636
- How long will you remain on the island?
- It depends by the Baron.

100
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:13,719
- And how long will the Baron remain?

101
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:18,324
- You seem our "Madonnuzza" in procession!

102
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:31,201
- How nice to see this house open again.

103
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:37,925
- I remembered it bigger.

104
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:42,237
- I passed here along every day
since you went away.

105
00:12:50,527 --> 00:12:51,880
- Nice, right?

106
00:12:56,087 --> 00:12:57,406
- It will suit you.

107
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:01,245
- But this is for Ladies.

108
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:06,515
- And the others?

109
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:10,557
- Ventura work in the quarry,
Nicolino at the port, when he finds.

110
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:13,720
- And Tommaso?
- He is becoming rich.

111
00:13:14,887 --> 00:13:19,722
- rich? How?
- With boats. He has three.

112
00:13:20,287 --> 00:13:24,041
- Sara! Come, the Baroness awaits.
- Coming!

113
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,840
- What does she wants from you?
- That i comb her hair.

114
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:30,522
- She says that how i do it, nobody does.

115
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:32,916
- Why? you're so good?
- The Baroness say so.

116
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:37,483
- Then?
- When? Soon it's time for dinner

117
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:40,720
- Then tomorrow
I'll take you to visit the island.

118
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,438
- Maybe you think it's smaller too!

119
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:53,316
- What do you do, you don't come?
- See you tomorrow.

120
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,164
- What will i do when you leave?

121
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:09,443
- Why should i go away Baroness?

122
00:14:11,207 --> 00:14:12,845
- Becasue soon you will be engaged

123
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:15,640
- and then you will marry.

124
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:18,356
- I can't continue to comb you the same?

125
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:22,796
- And if He will be jealous
and he will keep you locked up?

126
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,001
- This means that i will look for
a not jealous husband.

127
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:31,315
- Impossible!

128
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:35,086
- You are toomuch beautiful.

129
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:04,886
- This island is not little, it's mine!

130
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:17,997
- Why don't you comb my hair
instead of laughing?

131
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:25,044
- You are beautiful.
- Like the Baroness? - More.

132
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:30,245
- In the city they all comb hair so.
- How is the city?

133
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:33,715
- Big. There's a lot of people.

134
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:37,082
- So much that you can't
even imagine.

135
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:41,843
- And do you remember the Burraran?
- Yes.

136
00:15:43,487 --> 00:15:46,206
- Do you still eat it?
- And when my father will changer?

137
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:53,556
- And yours?
- He never came back.

138
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:56,321
- From Where?

139
00:15:57,287 --> 00:15:59,562
- From Trentino, from the war.

140
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:04,362
- They say he is missing,
but I don't believe them.

141
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:12,525
- Take me to the "tonnara" (*tuna-fishing place).
- Do you want to see Tommaso?

142
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:26,516
- Tommaso!

143
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:33,362
- What do you do, you don't come?
- I have to go home.

144
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:38,125
- Why are you in the dark?

145
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:47,401
- What he did?

146
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:55,882
- Things aren't going well at the quarry.
- Not well?

147
00:17:57,687 --> 00:18:01,362
- Tuff begins to finish.
- It's not good.

148
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:05,239
- Is it your fault?
- Is it you to ruin it?

149
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:08,639
- Take care of the fire and shut up.
- I love you.

150
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:13,085
- I told you to shut up.

151
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:39,365
- I don't want a life like this.

152
00:18:43,127 --> 00:18:46,324
- And what life do you want?
- I don't know.

153
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:50,521
- but not so, when everything
is always the same.

154
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:55,199
- We are the same too.

155
00:19:09,087 --> 00:19:11,681
- You were wrong,
There's nothing up there.

156
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:15,718
- Simply clean the first lay.
There's a fortune here.

157
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:20,523
- What do you say? If you talk about a plant
that can grow up there, it's probably.

158
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,845
- But there's no tuff.

159
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:31,837
- But was it needed to call them
from the Continent (Italia)

160
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:33,804
two stupid like those?

161
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:37,719
- He trust them, the Baron.
- What do you wanna do?

162
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:43,921
- I know it's there.
- I trust you.

163
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:55,283
- Is it of the Baroness too?

164
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,796
- She promised me one equal
when i will marry.

165
00:20:05,887 --> 00:20:07,206
- I do it.

166
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:27,800
- And when you will marry?

167
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:32,242
- When someone will "ask" me
to my mother.

168
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:44,806
- I "ask" you.

169
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,202
- You laugh!

170
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:00,806
- And what should i do?

171
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:48,405
- You are here!
I looked for you everywhere.

172
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:54,565
- They needed help
and they asked to my mother.

173
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:56,401
- Why?

174
00:21:57,767 --> 00:22:00,839
- The storm last night
ruined all the nets.

175
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:08,236
- For long?

176
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:11,843
- Until i finish.

177
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:19,119
- They are Tommaso's?
- They are everybody's.

178
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:22,358
- If you want, You can remain and help us.

179
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:44,726
- What do you want?
- Nica, is her name.

180
00:22:47,727 --> 00:22:49,365
- I give her to you.
- Why?

181
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:53,442
- Because you are alike.
She was alone and angry like you.

182
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:56,477
- Then i hugged her
and she started to laugh.

183
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:58,126
- Dogs don't laugh.

184
00:23:07,847 --> 00:23:11,317
- You see, Was i right?
- Why? - Look with your eyes.

185
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:20,440
- You were right.

186
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:23,443
- This is an important day, Ventura.

187
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:27,084
- Important for the land
and important for you.

188
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,521
- Why don't you stop, Angela?
You oppress me.

189
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:21,598
- If i stop,
then you won't look for me anymore.

190
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:26,002
- You are stubborn.

191
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,637
- You are beautiful this way.
- I did it for you.

192
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,086
- Don't start again.

193
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:35,327
- I can't stop,
I love you toomuch.

194
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:39,596
- I love you too,
but not like you.

195
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:42,203
- There's only one way to love.

196
00:24:46,647 --> 00:24:47,796
- Come!

197
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:06,521
- And now?

198
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:15,445
- Don't be shocked.

199
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:42,644
- We are two women, it's a sin.
- What's a sin?

200
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:52,084
- A thing we don't have to do.

201
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:18,395
- Ave Maria,
gratia plena, Dominus tecum,

202
00:27:18,487 --> 00:27:21,957
benedicta tu in mulieribus et
benedictus fructus ventris tui, lesus.

203
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:25,000
Sancta Maria, materDei,
ora pro nobis...

204
00:27:29,527 --> 00:27:32,997
...peccatoribus,
nunc et in hora mortis nostrae. Amen.

205
00:27:47,287 --> 00:27:50,324
- Sancta Maria, materDei,
ora pro nobis peccatoribus.

206
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:53,035
Santa Maria, materDei,

207
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:16,558

00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:50,036
- What are you doing?

209
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,763
- I'm counting the days you didn't come.

210
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:14,715
- Lucia!

211
00:29:15,807 --> 00:29:18,685

Agnese you too, come down!

212

- You become engaged with Ventura.
- Ventura? - Eh!

215
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:44,718

216
00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:47,362
- Drink!

217
00:29:47,927 --> 00:29:52,000

00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:57,595

219
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:15,640
- It has been - diffult to find you.

220
00:30:17,207 --> 00:30:18,879
- I've been always here.

221
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:23,362
- Did you talk with your father?
- Yes.

222
00:30:30,807 --> 00:30:33,002
- You say only "yes"?
- What should i say?

223
00:30:34,687 --> 00:30:37,042
- My father leave us
the farm of Cala Torta.

224
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,645
- There are two rooms
to accomodate, but...

225
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:52,161
- It was only a snake.
- You killed it for nothing.

226
00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:53,999
- Aren't you able to say "thank you"?

227
00:30:57,287 --> 00:30:59,482
- By may I will accomodate those rooms.

228
00:31:01,847 --> 00:31:04,361
- Do you wanna come to see it?
- I know Cala Torta.

229
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:07,244
- I say for the house.

230
00:31:08,887 --> 00:31:10,843
- It's better if you make me a surprise.

231
00:31:22,927 --> 00:31:26,522
- This is the way to enter in the house of god?
Like dogs are chasing you?

232
00:31:26,607 --> 00:31:29,440
- You wanted to see me.
- I wanted to congratulate.

233
00:31:30,407 --> 00:31:33,444
- What wishes?
- Aren't you engaged? - Ah.

234
00:31:34,007 --> 00:31:35,281
- Come on, sit down.

235
00:31:38,887 --> 00:31:40,206
- Look, Angela,

236
00:31:41,647 --> 00:31:46,084
- Now you will have new duties
and we must think about it.

237
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:50,717
- What are these duties?
- Ventura is honest,

238
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:55,680
- God-fearing,
but you have to look your behavior,

239
00:31:56,807 --> 00:31:59,526
- You don't have to kiss.
And you don't have to desire each other!

240
00:31:59,607 --> 00:32:02,917
- I can assure you, I...
- Then, when you will marry...

241
00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:06,044
- But you have to arrive "pure"
to that day.

242
00:32:06,327 --> 00:32:08,079
- But i don't want Ventura!

243
00:32:09,447 --> 00:32:12,120
- What does it mean?
- That i don't Marry him, Father Pantaleo!

244
00:32:14,127 --> 00:32:15,685
- This is a mess, Angela!

245
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:18,841
- He's a good boy,
you must love and must marry him!

246
00:32:18,927 --> 00:32:20,838
- I can't, Father!
- You have to force yourself!

247
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:24,322
- In this way your father decided
and you have to obey him.

248
00:32:24,407 --> 00:32:26,284
- It's written in the commandments too.

249
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,758
- Commandments are for those able to read.

250
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:34,165
- And what i'm doing here?
I'm here to proclaim the words of God.

251
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:37,201
- I wanna read on my own,
these words of God.

252
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:40,803
- Teach me to read! When I will learn...
- You are possessed

253
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,920
- You come to talk in the
House of god in this way!

254
00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:45,963
- You give us obedience,
to your father, understand?

255
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,005
- And you must marry Ventura!
Obedience and respect.

256
00:32:49,847 --> 00:32:51,439
- And me? Who respect me?

257
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:03,805
- I thought you don't come anymore.

258
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:11,397
- You seem your father
when you have a so bad face.

259
00:33:14,807 --> 00:33:16,160
- Where have you been?

260
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:22,005
- What's up, did i offend you?

261
00:33:23,807 --> 00:33:25,445
- Tell me something, I was joking.

262
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:32,164
- My father "made me" engaged.

263
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:36,161
- Who?

264
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:41,395
- With Ventura.

265
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:46,919
- Sooner or later it had to happen.

266
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:56,965
- I want YOU!

267
00:34:00,487 --> 00:34:01,715
- You want the moon.

268
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:10,760
- Is this the moon?

269
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:30,958
- If i can't marry you,

270
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,159
- I won't marry anybody.

271
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:52,120
- Come in.
I need to talk with you.

272
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:54,243
- If you don't come in,
you will spend the whole night here out.

273
00:34:54,327 --> 00:34:55,680
- I won't marry Ventura!

274
00:34:58,647 --> 00:35:00,922
- Really?
- Really.

275
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:05,279
- I don't want him.

276
00:35:07,727 --> 00:35:09,445
- And who do you want? Let's see.

277
00:35:13,247 --> 00:35:14,396
- Sara.

278
00:35:33,207 --> 00:35:34,845
- Angela won't marry anymore.

279
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:38,366
- She doesn't want Ventura.

280
00:35:56,807 --> 00:35:59,640
- No, no! Help!
- WALK!

281
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:02,475
- Walk!
- Help me, leave me!

282
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:06,442
- Go on! Move!

283
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:10,601
- Please!
- Brava, pray the Lord!

284
00:36:12,687 --> 00:36:15,406
- Mather! Mather, He kills me!

285
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:20,921
- Mother He kills me!
- Shut up!

286
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:23,481
- Salvatore! What do you do?
- Go away!

287
00:36:24,887 --> 00:36:28,800
- Come, come! go on!

288
00:36:29,007 --> 00:36:32,397
- Walk! go on!

289
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:36,685

290
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:39,839
- You must understand!
- Help me!, Help me!

291
00:36:47,687 --> 00:36:50,440
- Will you stop?
- No...

292
00:36:50,647 --> 00:36:53,764
- Freak of nature!

293
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:07,397

294
00:37:07,927 --> 00:37:11,124

295
00:38:22,007 --> 00:38:23,645
Don Salvatore...

296
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:25,401
- Don Salvatore!

297
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:30,880
- I thought that tomorrow, after mass,

298
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:33,765
- Ventura and Angela could meet to talk.

299
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:37,044
- Angela isn't fine. - Matter?
- Nothing, some flu.

300
00:38:38,127 --> 00:38:40,197
- Ventura did something wrong?

301
00:38:42,327 --> 00:38:45,125
- Tell me, i will break him, that miserable!

302
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:47,880
- Ventura is a good boy.
We only need to wait.

303
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,563
- It's better if Angela doesn't go out,
for now.

304
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:46,522
- Angela!
- Sara! I'm here! Sara!

305
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:50,006
- Angela!

306
00:39:54,047 --> 00:39:56,402

307
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:59,643
- Sara! Sara!

308
00:40:13,087 --> 00:40:14,236
Angela!

309
00:40:33,527 --> 00:40:35,961
- What did you think?
Smells of roses?

310
00:40:38,607 --> 00:40:40,279
- He keeps me like an animal.

311
00:40:43,287 --> 00:40:45,084
- Stand up!
- I can't.

312
00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:48,637
- Do it for your mother.
- And what she does for me?

313
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,996
- Why she doesn't come?
- If she comes here, your father will kill her.

314
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:04,401
- Leave me!

315
00:41:21,528 --> 00:41:23,962
- What did you think?
Smells of roses?

316
00:41:26,608 --> 00:41:28,280
- He keeps me like an animal.

317
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,085
- Stand up!
- I can't.

318
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,638
- Do it for your mother.
- And what does she do for me?

319
00:41:37,448 --> 00:41:40,997
- Why doesn't she come?
- If she comes here, your father will kill her.

320
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,402
- Leave me!

321
00:41:13,968 --> 00:41:17,483
- You don't have to touch this.
- What is it?

322
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,481
- The baby.

323
00:41:28,088 --> 00:41:30,044
- They killed him.

324
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:32,607
- Who did it?

325
00:41:36,608 --> 00:41:38,519
- And I was with him.

326
00:41:40,008 --> 00:41:43,444
- When did it happen?
- When they forced you to the convent?

327
00:41:46,328 --> 00:41:48,478
- I kept him anyway.

328
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,046
- He has to stay here.

329
00:42:16,008 --> 00:42:17,726
- You don't have to touch him.

330
00:42:26,808 --> 00:42:28,480
- I'll go to talk to her.

331
00:42:47,608 --> 00:42:49,485
- You don't have to come here anymore.

332
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:52,446
- If you continue to come,
I'll use the dogs and they'll tear you to pieces.

333
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:56,480
- I want to know where Angela is?
- She left.

334
00:42:55,694 --> 00:42:57,692
- Where did she go?

335
00:43:03,088 --> 00:43:05,807
- You have to forget this street and this house.

336
00:43:06,448 --> 00:43:08,166
- Angela won't be back anymore.

337
00:43:09,568 --> 00:43:11,160
- At least tell me where she is!

338
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:32,288
- You must tell me, if she is dead.

339
00:43:32,688 --> 00:43:35,566
- Why don't you ask Angela,
you sent her to me.

340
00:43:36,328 --> 00:43:39,877
- You are so powerful,
I ask you for only one thing.

341
00:43:40,448 --> 00:43:42,518
- Have I ever asked you for anything? Nothing!
Only this once.

342
00:43:43,528 --> 00:43:46,201
- I don't want to know why,
I only want to know if she is dead.

343
00:43:46,328 --> 00:43:48,000
- You must tell me if she is dead.

344
00:44:00,728 --> 00:44:04,607
- With Palm Sunday we start to celebrate
the Holy Week,

345
00:44:04,688 --> 00:44:07,361
where we recall,
the last days of life on earth

346
00:44:07,448 --> 00:44:09,120
of Our Lord Jesus Christ,

347
00:44:09,608 --> 00:44:11,087
the tremendous suffering,

348
00:44:11,808 --> 00:44:14,800
the unfair proceedings,
the ascent to Calvary, death,

349
00:44:15,768 --> 00:44:18,965
the grave and ultimately his resurrection.

350
00:44:20,968 --> 00:44:23,880
A week that therefore, gives us hope,

351
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:28,241
as well as the certainty of
the resurrection of Christ.

352
00:44:29,688 --> 00:44:32,202
A resurrection,
that places Christ at the center

353
00:44:32,768 --> 00:44:35,282
of his victory over sin and death,

354
00:44:35,608 --> 00:44:39,647
and gives us the hope of
liberation from sin.

355
00:44:50,368 --> 00:44:51,960
- Can I talk to you?

356
00:45:13,528 --> 00:45:16,201
- I can't stand it anymore!

357
00:45:18,008 --> 00:45:19,760
- how long does it have to last?

358
00:45:21,808 --> 00:45:24,322
Until she understands that she must
obey me.

359
00:45:27,648 --> 00:45:30,720
- Please, Salvatore!

360
00:45:31,488 --> 00:45:35,163
- I implore you Salvatore, get her out!
Before she dies.

361
00:45:36,728 --> 00:45:40,198
- Nobody likes to die, even your daughter.

362
00:45:41,848 --> 00:45:43,679
- Come to bed.

363
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:47,206
- I don't believe she will surrender.

364
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:52,005
- So it will last forever.

365
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:05,322
- Why doesn't she come anymore?

366
00:46:07,728 --> 00:46:09,320
- I don't hear her voice.

367
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:14,599
- You have to forget Sara.
- Why doesn't she look for me anymore?

368
00:46:20,368 --> 00:46:23,644
- She is not like you.
- What do you mean?

369
00:46:26,688 --> 00:46:28,167
- She has been "promised" to Tommaso,

370
00:46:28,968 --> 00:46:31,357
- Giovanni's son, that...
- I know who he is!

371
00:46:34,568 --> 00:46:36,047
- When will they marry?

372
00:46:37,848 --> 00:46:40,442
- Soon. In June.

373
00:48:00,648 --> 00:48:02,001
- What does it mean?

374
00:48:02,968 --> 00:48:04,321
- Where's the dinner?

375
00:48:06,248 --> 00:48:07,476
Answer me!

376
00:48:10,528 --> 00:48:11,961
- Get her out from there!

377
00:48:12,328 --> 00:48:14,922
- Who are you to tell me what I
should or should not to do?

378
00:48:15,008 --> 00:48:16,202
I'm your mother.

379
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,684
- I know that you never wanted her.

380
00:48:20,728 --> 00:48:22,047
- And you are right.

381
00:48:23,088 --> 00:48:26,000
- But I have only Angela,
she has to get out from there NOW!

382
00:48:26,168 --> 00:48:27,521
- Listen...

383
00:48:28,128 --> 00:48:30,961
- Don't use that tone with me
or I'll also put you down there.

384
00:48:31,048 --> 00:48:32,481
and you will both die.

385
00:48:33,048 --> 00:48:36,723
- You always protected her.
That is why she is what she is.

386
00:48:37,928 --> 00:48:40,726
- I would be happier if she was a bitch
than a half man.

387
00:48:41,528 --> 00:48:43,405
- For me she is already dead.

388
00:48:48,168 --> 00:48:51,126
- You are right, I did make a mistake.

389
00:48:52,368 --> 00:48:55,166
- But we can still do ... the right thing.

390
00:48:58,048 --> 00:49:02,439
- Let's "make" her a man, as you wanted her.
- What are you saying?

391
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:06,996
- The Priest is indebted to us.
- Be silent, it is an old story!

392
00:49:08,008 --> 00:49:10,124
- Before Our Lord, today is a historic day.

393
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:12,045
- I told you to keep quiet!

394
00:49:13,888 --> 00:49:15,799
- Sit down, and I'll bring you some food.

395
00:49:17,808 --> 00:49:19,924
- I know what we can say to the Priest.

396
00:49:22,608 --> 00:49:24,519
- I don't need of your advice.

397
00:49:26,488 --> 00:49:27,841
- Good Mother...

398
00:49:33,928 --> 00:49:35,486
- But what are you speaking about?

399
00:49:36,204 --> 00:49:38,888
- The Priest seems like a person
who is willing to play along?

400
00:49:39,248 --> 00:49:42,240
- But how could I be wrong
between a boy and a girl, Donna Lucia?

401
00:49:42,488 --> 00:49:46,640
- It's true, you know the difference very well.
You're an expert.

402
00:49:47,648 --> 00:49:51,436
- But because some of your "experience"
comes also from our family,

403
00:49:51,928 --> 00:49:53,805
- you could repay us.

404
00:49:55,168 --> 00:49:56,567
- You are crazy.
- Why?

405
00:49:56,928 --> 00:49:59,886
- Didn't you "practice", with my sister Agnese?

406
00:50:01,408 --> 00:50:03,126
- Crazy and possessed.

407
00:50:22,408 --> 00:50:25,764
- The "little baby", inside the glass jar,

408
00:50:26,008 --> 00:50:27,646
- He looks like a lizard.

409
00:50:28,088 --> 00:50:31,080
- But perhaps it really is a lizard.

410
00:50:31,848 --> 00:50:34,487
- So, Angela can also be a man.

411
00:50:35,088 --> 00:50:38,239
- I made a mistake, and you missed
my mistake.

412
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:05,402
- I'm dirty.

413
00:51:06,728 --> 00:51:08,639
- You've  become like a little bird!

414
00:51:11,328 --> 00:51:13,159
- What're you doing?
- I'll take you out.

415
00:51:13,568 --> 00:51:16,287
- No, I won't marry Ventura, I won't
marry anybody.

416
00:51:16,528 --> 00:51:18,644
- It doesn't matter, Angela,
it's all over.

417
00:51:20,928 --> 00:51:25,683
- You father wanted a son
and now you will be a man. - Eh?

418
00:51:26,288 --> 00:51:27,562
- It's easy, Angela.

419
00:51:27,888 --> 00:51:30,960
- Just change one letter in the file,
at the end of the name.

420
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,046
and say that the Priest was wrong,
and so was I.

421
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:37,761
- You had a very absentminded mother.

422
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:41,800
Come, let's go.

423
00:51:45,328 --> 00:51:49,037
- Hold on to me, Angela. Come.

424
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:52,480
- Here, Do you see the steps? Here.

425
00:52:05,928 --> 00:52:07,919
- Careful, there's too much light,
Angela.

426
00:52:08,008 --> 00:52:11,125
- Close your eyes,
You can hang on to me. - Mom...

427
00:52:20,288 --> 00:52:22,165
- Here, you're out. Now we'll close this.

428
00:52:33,008 --> 00:52:34,760
- I thought a lot about it.

429
00:52:36,328 --> 00:52:38,364
- I can't go to the quarry forever .

430
00:52:39,888 --> 00:52:42,925
- You will be a man and you take my place.

431
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:45,477
- And how can I do it?

432
00:52:46,528 --> 00:52:49,964
- Don't you have men's thoughts?
- I'm a woman.

433
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:53,843
- It's the only thing
you can do to save yourself.

434
00:52:55,808 --> 00:52:58,402
- You will be a man or you'll go back
to where you were.

435
00:53:00,968 --> 00:53:04,404
- Everybody knows me in town.
- In town, they do what I want.

436
00:53:05,168 --> 00:53:08,285
- If tomorrow I start to bark
because I've become a dog,

437
00:53:08,368 --> 00:53:10,199
- I make them say "Woof, woof."

438
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:14,686
- So, you will be the Curator at once.

439
00:53:15,368 --> 00:53:17,324
- They won't even have time to think

440
00:53:17,408 --> 00:53:21,083
that they have to call you "My lord,
welcom, I'm your servant".

441
00:53:23,128 --> 00:53:25,483
- Leave me for some hours.

442
00:53:34,328 --> 00:53:35,522
Sara!

443
00:53:37,528 --> 00:53:38,961
- Sara!
- Angela!

444
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,401
- You are healed, then?
- E Sara?

445
00:53:43,488 --> 00:53:47,163
On the continent with the baroness,
for the documents.

446
00:53:48,008 --> 00:53:51,398
- When will she be back?
- I don't know, they are time consuming things.

447
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:56,202
- Tell her that I will wait for her
at the Madonna of the Quarry.

448
00:53:57,728 --> 00:53:59,366
- She is thinner.

449
00:55:22,128 --> 00:55:23,800
Welcome.

450
00:55:25,808 --> 00:55:27,161
Welcome.

451
00:55:27,162 --> 00:55:28,162
Come on, come on!

452
00:55:30,384 --> 00:55:34,280
- Don't stop.
Keep your head up and look ahead.

453
00:55:57,009 --> 00:56:00,786
- What are you doing, why are you trembling?
You are a man.

454
00:56:01,488 --> 00:56:02,921
They are like you.

455
00:56:06,408 --> 00:56:08,717
- Come! Come here!

456
00:56:15,448 --> 00:56:16,801
Listen to me.

457
00:56:19,048 --> 00:56:21,562
This is my son: Angelo.

458
00:56:23,728 --> 00:56:26,322
From today, he'll work here with me.

459
00:56:27,928 --> 00:56:32,479
He has followed me for years.
I've told him everything about the quarry.

460
00:56:33,008 --> 00:56:36,159
He has learned everything that he needs
to know.

461
00:56:38,408 --> 00:56:41,559
He works here with me.
I've told him everything about the quarry.

462
00:56:41,688 --> 00:56:43,121
This is my son.

463
00:56:43,328 --> 00:56:47,162
Starting from today, what Angelo tells you,

464
00:56:49,368 --> 00:56:50,687
it's like my own words.

465
00:56:54,048 --> 00:56:56,960
Work well. Come on.

466
00:58:18,808 --> 00:58:20,639
Angela...

467
00:58:29,928 --> 00:58:31,407
Angela!

468
00:58:37,688 --> 00:58:39,599
- Please don't say anything.

469
00:58:42,328 --> 00:58:45,957
- But why is it so?
- So I could always be with you.

470
00:58:47,568 --> 00:58:50,878
- I can I wear these dresses for my
whole life, if we stay together.

471
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,041
- All your life.

472
00:59:17,088 --> 00:59:19,727
- We can't stay together, not
even for one minute.

473
00:59:22,728 --> 00:59:24,605
- A lot of things have changed.

474
00:59:26,528 --> 00:59:28,200
- Has the heart beat changed?

475
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:34,081
- Changed? I don't believe
that it doesn't beat like mine anymore.

476
00:59:35,088 --> 00:59:36,316
- I don't believe it...

477
01:00:09,528 --> 01:00:11,041
- I will marry Sara.

478
01:00:12,768 --> 01:00:13,962
- Are you a man?

479
01:00:15,008 --> 01:00:17,966
- So go down to the Madonna in my place.

480
01:00:21,648 --> 01:00:23,286
- It takes strength. Get up!

481
01:00:34,368 --> 01:00:35,642
Come on!

482
01:00:40,048 --> 01:00:41,163
Get up!

483
01:01:13,488 --> 01:01:16,480
- Do you really want to marry Angelo?
- Yes.

484
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:18,482
- But..How can you do it?

485
01:01:19,728 --> 01:01:23,198
- You say this because you are afraid
of the Priest, the Baron?

486
01:01:23,488 --> 01:01:25,206
- I really love him.

487
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:33,164
- I can't forget that Angelo isn't
what he seems.

488
01:01:34,968 --> 01:01:36,481
- You have to tell me.

489
01:01:37,288 --> 01:01:39,677
- I don't believe what the Priest says
like everybody else in town.

490
01:01:39,768 --> 01:01:42,157
- I want to hear it from you. Is it true?

491
01:01:45,848 --> 01:01:47,998
- No, no, look into my eyes and tell me

492
01:01:48,328 --> 01:01:50,398
that Angelo is a man like me.

493
01:01:52,568 --> 01:01:53,796
- He is a man.

494
01:01:55,008 --> 01:01:56,441
He is a man, Tommaso.

495
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:59,039
They made a mistake when he was born.

496
01:02:01,288 --> 01:02:02,801
- And do you love him?

497
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:08,203
Do you love him so much that you'll marry him?

498
01:03:04,048 --> 01:03:05,481
- Dogs!

499
01:03:29,608 --> 01:03:31,485
- I still don't believe it's true.

500
01:03:37,328 --> 01:03:39,205
- What are you doing?
- I am a man.

501
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:57,880
- I am a man.

502
01:04:02,008 --> 01:04:04,158
- I know it's not true.

503
01:06:43,168 --> 01:06:45,728
- Are you Angelo Vicari?
- Yes.

504
01:06:46,368 --> 01:06:48,086
- I have this letter for you.

505
01:06:59,928 --> 01:07:02,522
- Who's Angelo Vicari?
- It's me.

506
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:06,527
- Come with me.

507
01:07:13,208 --> 01:07:14,960
Stand in front of me.

508
01:07:22,608 --> 01:07:25,202
- Yours, it's a very special case.
- I know, but...

509
01:07:25,288 --> 01:07:28,360
- Shut up! In the army you talk
only if you are questioned.

510
01:07:29,568 --> 01:07:32,207
- I'm sorry.
- Undress yourself.

511
01:07:32,768 --> 01:07:35,726
- I wanted to tell you one thing before...
- No no, Vicari.

512
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:39,442
Here you have to learn
to obey and that's all.

513
01:07:40,688 --> 01:07:43,122
- Come on, undress.
- What should I take off?

514
01:07:44,808 --> 01:07:46,127
Everything.

515
01:08:04,408 --> 01:08:05,807
I said ALL.

516
01:08:05,888 --> 01:08:08,686
- What's that on your face? Have you been hurt?
- No.

517
01:08:31,568 --> 01:08:32,842
I wanted to tell you.

518
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:35,767
- And I knew it.

519
01:08:38,008 --> 01:08:40,078
The Baron thought about everything.

520
01:08:42,328 --> 01:08:44,842
Only that I wanted to see it with
my own eyes.

521
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:47,685
- And now?
- Get dressed.

522
01:08:48,528 --> 01:08:49,961
- for the country you are a man,

523
01:08:50,248 --> 01:08:52,762
But you are not suitable to serve in the army.

524
01:09:17,568 --> 01:09:19,957
- Tonight you can send Ventura to the tavern.

525
01:09:20,048 --> 01:09:23,484
- No tavern. We pay the men here,
at the end of the day.

526
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:27,440
- What do you say, Don Angelo?
What's this novelty?

527
01:09:28,288 --> 01:09:31,280
- If it's because of Ventura that you're ...
- It has nothing to do with Ventura.

528
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:33,800
- Leave us alone, Vincenzo.

529
01:09:35,648 --> 01:09:37,161
What the hell is this?

530
01:09:37,728 --> 01:09:40,640
- If I have to take your place,
I want to do it my way.

531
01:09:40,728 --> 01:09:43,288
- About these things it is neither his way
nor mine.

532
01:09:44,408 --> 01:09:46,603
- It's the Baron that decides.
- It's true,

533
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:50,243
but all the salary the Baron give us,
I want to give it all.

534
01:09:50,568 --> 01:09:52,843
What do we gain
with this beautiful thought?

535
01:09:53,808 --> 01:09:56,481
- If the men are happier, they work better

536
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:58,604
and the Baron too is happier.

537
01:09:59,088 --> 01:10:01,363
- The only happiness that interests me
is my own.

538
01:10:01,928 --> 01:10:04,681
Remember that, if you want to
make your own way.

539
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:14,236
- Bless you.

540
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:21,121
- You think I'm a thief 'cause you
don't want me to manage the salaries.

541
01:10:21,488 --> 01:10:23,956
- If I thought you were a thief,
I'd have already kicked you out.

542
01:10:25,008 --> 01:10:26,805
Things have to change here.

543
01:10:28,648 --> 01:10:29,842
- More than this?

544
01:10:31,008 --> 01:10:32,646
- More than this, Ventura.

545
01:10:33,088 --> 01:10:37,001
- And how should I call you?
Angelo o Angela?

546
01:10:38,408 --> 01:10:42,003
- Curator, for everybody here
I'm only the Curator,

547
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,444
for you and for the others.

548
01:11:23,848 --> 01:11:26,726
- Sorry.
- But what did you expect?

549
01:11:27,448 --> 01:11:29,200
- That to erase everybody's mind

550
01:11:29,288 --> 01:11:30,926
only needed trousers

551
01:11:31,328 --> 01:11:33,523
or a backpack tucked into his pants?

552
01:11:41,008 --> 01:11:43,317
- Don Salvatore, I take you as my son.

553
01:11:44,048 --> 01:11:46,767
- What should I do with him?
- In the town the people say you need help.

554
01:11:46,848 --> 01:11:49,726
- If I need help I'll call you.
- Don Salvatore, I no longer live.

555
01:11:49,808 --> 01:11:52,527
- I have four daughters, give a
job to Nicolino.

556
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:54,997
- By Madonna, make a miracle!
- Let me go.

557
01:11:55,088 --> 01:11:57,044
- Implore Him!
- Let me go, Filippo!

558
01:11:58,048 --> 01:12:01,563
- Don Salvatore, Nicolino is strong as
a mule. Let's try him at least.

559
01:12:21,888 --> 01:12:24,448
- Are you thirsting to give orders,
"Curator"?

560
01:12:24,648 --> 01:12:25,842
- What do you want?

561
01:12:28,048 --> 01:12:30,721
- Go away!
- Why don't you tell me that you are
the boss?

562
01:12:30,808 --> 01:12:34,926
- Go away! Leave me!
- Tell me now that you are a man!

563
01:12:35,008 --> 01:12:36,760
- Tell me now!      No! No!

564
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:40,644
- Tell me! Tell me now!

565
01:12:46,888 --> 01:12:48,082
- Tell me now!

566
01:12:48,808 --> 01:12:50,321
- What are you doing?

567
01:12:58,408 --> 01:13:00,126
You are only a beast.

568
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:03,728
I'm not killing you only because
you're your father's son.

569
01:13:04,048 --> 01:13:09,406
But tomorrow you have to leave the island.
Understand?! - Yes.

570
01:13:10,008 --> 01:13:11,441
Go away!

571
01:13:13,368 --> 01:13:14,642
Go away!

572
01:13:21,408 --> 01:13:22,761
Go home.

573
01:13:27,168 --> 01:13:30,683
"The little baby under the parasol,
imitated Mama. "

574
01:13:31,088 --> 01:13:34,478
"All the pizzas and sandwiches
flew from his hands."

575
01:13:35,048 --> 01:13:38,324
"But sin does not rain here
and he just follows her. "

576
01:13:38,768 --> 01:13:43,000
"If only there was a parasol
to take me from here to there."

577
01:13:46,408 --> 01:13:47,966
- Again.

578
01:14:00,048 --> 01:14:01,925
- Do you want a baby?

579
01:14:03,608 --> 01:14:04,927
- What're you saying?

580
01:14:06,928 --> 01:14:08,964
- Tell me, would you like it or not?

581
01:14:09,768 --> 01:14:10,883
- And you?

582
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:15,484
- When I see pregnant women,

583
01:14:17,048 --> 01:14:19,357
waddling like ducks,

584
01:14:22,928 --> 01:14:25,203
... I miss it.

585
01:14:28,048 --> 01:14:29,447
- Me too.

586
01:14:34,768 --> 01:14:36,326
- What the fuck are you saying?

587
01:14:37,368 --> 01:14:39,248
- You tell me

588
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:42,878
You are a man? So do your manly duties
in bed, like everybody else.

589
01:14:43,288 --> 01:14:45,279
And right here, with my wife at home?

590
01:14:47,048 --> 01:14:50,324
- I could only ask you.
- Why? Because I'm more stupid?

591
01:14:51,048 --> 01:14:54,006
- You made me a fool of me in the past.
Do you think you can keep doing it?

592
01:14:54,088 --> 01:14:55,407
- Who is it, Tommaso?

593
01:14:56,008 --> 01:14:58,283
- It's Angelo. We are talking
about a shipment.

594
01:14:59,128 --> 01:15:00,607
Just coming.

595
01:15:04,008 --> 01:15:07,159
I don't know if you think you can make a
fool of me before God or the whole town,

596
01:15:07,248 --> 01:15:09,637
but if you were a real man,
I would've whipped you dead

597
01:15:09,728 --> 01:15:10,956
for what you are asking me to do.

598
01:15:12,888 --> 01:15:14,719
- And if Sara were to ask you?

599
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:21,361
- It's always YOU.

600
01:15:21,448 --> 01:15:24,645
- If she will ask you?
- It's the same thing. It's alway crazy!

601
01:16:21,088 --> 01:16:22,487
- They deserved it.

602
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:25,284
- What are you saying?
- They were two demons.

603
01:16:25,728 --> 01:16:29,562
- Shut up! D'you want the Baron to hear you?
- Two devils! And they are dead.

604
01:16:30,728 --> 01:16:33,117
Now everybody knows who they were.

605
01:16:33,848 --> 01:16:35,918
- You don't have to stay here if it hurts you.

606
01:16:37,288 --> 01:16:40,041
- Women's odours that your father
took to bed.

607
01:16:40,768 --> 01:16:42,201
That hurt me.

608
01:16:43,568 --> 01:16:47,243
- Now, they know it, now everybody knows it!
- Vincenzo!

609
01:16:48,088 --> 01:16:49,840
- Go home.
- Donna Lucia...

610
01:16:50,688 --> 01:16:52,838
Come with me, please.

611
01:16:53,848 --> 01:16:55,839
- They found a boy with a rifle.

612
01:16:55,928 --> 01:16:57,759
- Where?
- At the "Monte Farro".

613
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:10,678
- Nicolino... - He had this with him
and he wouldn't tell us anything.

614
01:17:10,808 --> 01:17:13,368
- It wasn't me.
- Go out!.

615
01:17:22,088 --> 01:17:24,363
- What did you do?
Why did you have the rifle?

616
01:17:24,688 --> 01:17:26,485
- I wanted to scare him.

617
01:17:27,648 --> 01:17:29,843
My father wanted to kill himself.
It's his fault.

618
01:17:30,168 --> 01:17:32,357
- And I found him with her.
- Where?

619
01:17:32,392 --> 01:17:34,801
- They were near the well.

620
01:17:35,208 --> 01:17:38,280
Your aunt had the skirt up
and the veil was on the ground.

621
01:17:42,368 --> 01:17:44,404
Your father was on top.

622
01:17:45,608 --> 01:17:49,203
Madonnina mia, are you sure
you want to know it? - How did they fall?

623
01:17:50,008 --> 01:17:53,478
Your father saw me and he looked at me
with his eyes full of fire.

624
01:17:54,328 --> 01:17:57,240
He got up up and I....
raised my rifle by accident...

625
01:17:57,528 --> 01:17:59,564
He thought I would shoot him.

626
01:18:01,528 --> 01:18:03,644
So he walked backwards into the well...

627
01:18:06,368 --> 01:18:07,721
- And Agnese?

628
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:14,119
- She lowered her skirt,

629
01:18:15,448 --> 01:18:17,598
made the sign of the cross

630
01:18:20,048 --> 01:18:21,606
and threw herself.

631
01:18:27,448 --> 01:18:29,359
- Is this the truth, Nicolino?

632
01:18:33,248 --> 01:18:34,806
- It's the truth.

633
01:18:37,288 --> 01:18:38,926
It's the truth, you must believe me.

634
01:18:41,768 --> 01:18:43,440
It's the truth.

635
01:19:56,728 --> 01:19:58,286
- I like the sound of your heart beat,

636
01:19:59,328 --> 01:20:01,558
they seem like the drums at
the feast of Madonna.

637
01:20:03,688 --> 01:20:05,918
- Tonight I don't feel any beat.

638
01:20:08,808 --> 01:20:10,924
My father is dead and I feel no pain.

639
01:20:12,288 --> 01:20:13,721
- It's because he hurt you.

640
01:20:16,048 --> 01:20:17,322
It needs time..

641
01:20:18,768 --> 01:20:20,360
- How much time do we have?

642
01:20:23,408 --> 01:20:24,636
- Do you hear it?

643
01:20:25,568 --> 01:20:26,683
- I'll go.

644
01:20:29,568 --> 01:20:31,923
- Who is it?
- I am Tommaso.

645
01:20:43,648 --> 01:20:45,161
- I'll do it.

646
01:20:47,248 --> 01:20:49,000
But I'll do it for her.

647
01:21:17,328 --> 01:21:19,125
- Don't you want to be in a bed?

648
01:21:20,808 --> 01:21:22,799
- Do it soon.

649
01:21:34,968 --> 01:21:36,196
- Go!

650
01:21:54,568 --> 01:21:56,445
- Are you scared?
- No.

651
01:23:05,328 --> 01:23:07,888
- What did you do? - It's not my fault.
The rope, it's old!

652
01:23:08,688 --> 01:23:09,882
The rope?

653
01:23:13,448 --> 01:23:14,961
- You have to stay silent, beast!

654
01:23:19,008 --> 01:23:20,566
- You're like your father today.

655
01:23:58,608 --> 01:24:00,803
- I want to see you happy.

656
01:24:03,888 --> 01:24:05,640
- I am already happy.

657
01:24:59,968 --> 01:25:01,720
- I can't do it.

658
01:25:03,568 --> 01:25:07,402
It's not true.
it's not true, I know it's not true.

659
01:25:31,968 --> 01:25:34,198
- What are you thinking, looking at me
with those eyes?

660
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:37,959
This dress is tight

661
01:25:39,008 --> 01:25:41,283
Each day I'm growing more fat.

662
01:25:42,488 --> 01:25:44,399
- I should change this dress.

663
01:25:49,168 --> 01:25:51,318
- Do you feel sorry when they look at
me with this belly?

664
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:54,876
- A bit.

665
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:13,359
- Sorry for the delay.
- That's nothing, it's just a few minutes.

666
01:26:15,248 --> 01:26:16,522
The Baron?

667
01:26:19,128 --> 01:26:21,642
- The Baron had to go to "Cala Rossa".

668
01:26:22,088 --> 01:26:24,727
He will be back late, not before dinner.

669
01:26:27,768 --> 01:26:30,760
- Are you disappointed?
- For the quarry men,

670
01:26:31,528 --> 01:26:34,361
What I have to ask
is really important for them.

671
01:26:38,168 --> 01:26:39,999
- You really care about them, right?

672
01:26:41,208 --> 01:26:45,121
- I care for what is good for you too.
- So, you can also talk to me then.

673
01:26:47,848 --> 01:26:51,636
- Or you think that the quarries
aren't things for women?

674
01:26:52,528 --> 01:26:54,678
- Sit down.
- No.

675
01:26:59,688 --> 01:27:03,397
- A lot of things have changed for the quarry men
since the time you managed it.

676
01:27:04,768 --> 01:27:06,963
They say you defended them like a lion.

677
01:27:07,048 --> 01:27:11,803
- The counts are better,
but we need new ropes. - Mh-mh.

678
01:27:12,928 --> 01:27:16,045
I'm worried about the shipments,
we loose too many in this way.

679
01:27:17,608 --> 01:27:19,087
- It's a good argument.

680
01:27:27,608 --> 01:27:29,519
- It's a persuasive argument.

681
01:27:30,768 --> 01:27:32,121
- Look at me.

682
01:27:34,768 --> 01:27:37,521
- Do you want drink a little?
- No. What is it?

683
01:27:42,208 --> 01:27:43,960
- It's absinthe.

684
01:27:45,248 --> 01:27:46,840
They drink it in France.

685
01:27:48,968 --> 01:27:50,162
They use it...

686
01:27:53,288 --> 01:27:56,917
to tame the girls.
- I'm not a girl.

687
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:04,799
And even if I were, I wouldn't need to be tamed.

688
01:28:06,488 --> 01:28:08,160
Baroness...

689
01:28:15,168 --> 01:28:17,966
- Don't you sleep?
- I was worried.

690
01:28:18,848 --> 01:28:21,681
- Where have you been?
- To the Tavern.

691
01:28:23,368 --> 01:28:25,928
The Baron promised me
the ropes I had asked for.

692
01:28:26,488 --> 01:28:28,285
I paid for everybody's drink.

693
01:28:29,048 --> 01:28:32,120
- Your father would be happy
that you paid for the quarry men.

694
01:28:34,728 --> 01:28:38,118
- Come here - I will help you.
- No, it doesn't matter.

695
01:28:38,354 --> 01:28:40,928
Come on...

696
01:28:42,728 --> 01:28:44,559
Come closer, because it doesn't reach.

697
01:28:49,048 --> 01:28:50,879
But they are so long!

698
01:28:51,688 --> 01:28:53,679
It's less than a month since you cut them.

699
01:28:57,328 --> 01:28:58,807
I missed you.

700
01:29:04,008 --> 01:29:06,602
Did you put scent on like a girl
to go to the Tavern?

701
01:29:06,888 --> 01:29:08,401
- Eh?
- What are you saying?

702
01:29:10,888 --> 01:29:12,719
- Have you been with a woman?

703
01:29:15,648 --> 01:29:17,286
Yes or no?

704
01:29:17,928 --> 01:29:19,122
- Stop it, Sara.

705
01:29:19,488 --> 01:29:22,958
- Dressing like a man you're now
becoming like them. Right Angela?

706
01:29:52,088 --> 01:29:53,521
It seems I have it too.

707
01:29:54,528 --> 01:29:57,998
- Ah yes? And where do you have it?
Here, and here?

708
01:29:58,088 --> 01:29:59,726
- Ei!
- Here, here, here...

709
01:30:27,368 --> 01:30:28,357
Sara...

710
01:30:29,568 --> 01:30:32,082
- Sara, what're you doing?
- It hurts, it hurts.

711
01:30:33,808 --> 01:30:36,527
Angela! Angela!

712
01:30:38,448 --> 01:30:39,597
Signora Maria!

713
01:30:41,728 --> 01:30:43,400
Signora Maria! Signora Maria!

714
01:30:44,248 --> 01:30:45,363
She is ill.

715
01:30:51,048 --> 01:30:52,401
- It's rust blood.

716
01:30:52,888 --> 01:30:55,925
- The child still isn't near,
I can't do anything.

717
01:31:00,688 --> 01:31:01,723
Angela!

718
01:31:04,408 --> 01:31:05,682
Angela!

719
01:31:16,048 --> 01:31:19,040
Tommaso, open!

720
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:21,523
Tommaso!

721
01:31:23,928 --> 01:31:26,601
- What do you still want from me?
- I need you, come.

722
01:31:29,648 --> 01:31:30,967
- I have to go.

723
01:32:31,968 --> 01:32:34,243
- At least the baby is...
- Can I see her?

724
01:32:36,528 --> 01:32:38,041
Can I see her?

725
01:32:50,568 --> 01:32:52,286
- Do you want to hold him?

726
01:33:44,368 --> 01:33:48,202
"Give them eternal rest, Lord,
and may the perpetual light shine. "

727
01:33:48,688 --> 01:33:50,406
"Rest in peace."
