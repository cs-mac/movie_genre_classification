BOY

19
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:08,647
I'm calling you to come!

20
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:09,893
Land here!

21
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:11,925
Now... I'm "it"

22
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:14,739
Got to hide now.

23
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:20,824
"On the bridge at Kochi,
once there was a priest..."

24
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:28,896
"He bought a woman's hairpin.
Whatever for? Whatever for?"

25
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:50,353
I've hit you!

26
00:02:50,463 --> 00:02:56,311
You're supposed to cry. Whenever
you're hit you cry.

27
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,635
Where are you? All of you?

28
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:21,754
I'll get you all! Yes, each one
of you who's playing hooky.

29
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:56,078
They're coming. Father.
They're coming.

30
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,600
One more.

31
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:23,590
Two more.

32
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:34,677
The money I've been expecting
from Osaka just hasn't arrived yet.

33
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:39,828
That's all right, You've paid
regularly so far.

34
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:42,771
Thank you very much.

35
00:04:43,822 --> 00:04:45,909
Well, boy, shall we go?

36
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:59,101
You want Daddy to carry you?

37
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:07,186
If he sees something sad
happening, he'll start crying.

38
00:05:43,732 --> 00:05:45,588
Mother!

39
00:05:45,796 --> 00:05:46,806
It's no good!

40
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:48,700
The car number was...

41
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:49,879
It's no good.

42
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:55,736
Want to sit on my lap?

43
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:01,957
We have to go on trying,
we have to!

44
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:25,369
Pinch me.

45
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:27,429
Pinch my back.

46
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:33,354
Harder... harder.

47
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:46,680
Mother, are you all right?

48
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,673
But I wasn't speeding, I drove carefully.

49
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:53,718
You hit her!

50
00:06:54,636 --> 00:06:55,646
I hit her?

51
00:06:57,647 --> 00:06:59,608
Mother's been hurt.

52
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:14,826
Show me your license.

53
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,032
You're not a policeman.

54
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:19,031
Don't you have one?

55
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:20,926
Of course I do!

56
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:24,815
I've never had an accident before.

57
00:07:26,824 --> 00:07:29,878
Well... bad luck!

58
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,848
I'm laid up for two weeks.

59
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:39,844
But I can't stay off my job
for two weeks! Impossible!

60
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:43,997
How am I supposed to look after
the kids with a broken hip?

61
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,770
A broken hip?

62
00:07:47,738 --> 00:07:51,722
We'll know after the X-rays.
Then we'll go to the police.

63
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,796
Do we have to?

64
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:56,988
Well, it's somebody's fault,
but it's not mine!

65
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:58,890
It's not mine either.

66
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:01,981
We'd better ask them to look
into this properly.

67
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:03,920
What are you talking about?

68
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:10,745
Mother! Are you all right?
Does it hurt?

69
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,763
Look, this is my first accident.

70
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:23,768
Couldn't we sort of settle
this between us?

71
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:26,790
No, don't do that!

72
00:08:26,867 --> 00:08:30,886
If people like you aren't caught,
there will always be accidents.

73
00:08:30,962 --> 00:08:34,755
Will you come over here, please?

74
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:38,848
Does it really hurt you?

75
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,877
If you get hurt down there, you
can't have babies any more.

76
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:51,800
I can't eat this. It's too greasy.

77
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:53,898
Order something else.

78
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:59,632
I don't feel good. Besides it
hurts down there.

79
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:03,696
You can rest for a couple
of days.

80
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:06,658
Two weeks. That's what the doctor said.

81
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:11,656
We have to go on working, we have to.

82
00:09:11,824 --> 00:09:13,583
And why don't you do it?

83
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:18,639
Me? You know I'm all shot up.

84
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,838
Yes... war-wounds, diaeresis and what else?

85
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,703
It's just right for a goof accident.

86
00:09:26,677 --> 00:09:27,677
What are you doing?

87
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:28,741
Shut up!

88
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:40,592
Does it taste good?

89
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:43,794
Eat this too.

90
00:09:45,558 --> 00:09:46,717
I don't want to.

91
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:57,702
Well, you can always go back...
to your grandmother's house.

92
00:09:59,778 --> 00:10:04,570
Couldn't we stop doing this kind
of work? I don't really like it.

93
00:10:05,506 --> 00:10:07,526
I don't like it either, but...

94
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:15,527
there seems to be no way for
us to go on living together.

95
00:10:19,692 --> 00:10:21,588
Be quiet and sit down.

96
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:37,575
You want to go see your real
mother?

97
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:40,497
You know, she's almost dying.

98
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,950
And what would you do
in the hospital?

99
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:45,535
I won't go.

100
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:48,397
Do you want to go to grandmother's?

101
00:10:48,464 --> 00:10:49,464
No, I don't.

102
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:52,586
You see? He's my child.

103
00:11:46,543 --> 00:11:48,529
You don't have to do it, you know.

104
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:51,436
I can talk to your father.

105
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,517
What do you want?

106
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:10,421
Soup.

107
00:12:10,486 --> 00:12:12,246
Don't be silly!

108
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:15,279
Two orders of noodles and one soup.

109
00:12:38,193 --> 00:12:39,193
That's mine!

110
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,346
If I'm not working, I'm
not hungry.

111
00:13:09,197 --> 00:13:13,125
Want to go to the toilet?

112
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,214
Let's go. You can finish later.

113
00:13:32,175 --> 00:13:35,195
I will go to the station
to get the tickets.

114
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:40,327
After you finished the job, call the
station, and let them page me.

115
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:42,189
But if...

116
00:13:43,131 --> 00:13:48,115
It's no problem, you will succeed.
Anyway, work is work.

117
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:56,083
I'd better buy new glasses.

118
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:59,114
It isn't that I don't want to,
but I get scared.

119
00:13:59,248 --> 00:14:01,237
I used to be, too.

120
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:05,009
If only we could use magic!

121
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:07,039
There isn't any magic.

122
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:09,033
If we were from outer space...

123
00:14:09,073 --> 00:14:12,093
There aren't any such things.

124
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,065
Buy that for me.

125
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,213
No taxis and no fast drivers.

126
00:14:35,247 --> 00:14:40,107
Just delivery trucks or woman drivers.

127
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:20,893
Look, sea gulls... sea gulls.

128
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:22,093
Sea gulls...

129
00:15:22,968 --> 00:15:27,987
Yes, sea gulls. They eat fish.

130
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:30,862
Fish...

131
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:37,817
Yes, big ones and little ones.

132
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,040
And the little ones eat seaweed.

133
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:44,906
S-e-a-w-e-e-d.

134
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,874
Seaweed...

135
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:53,812
Look the sea covers the whole world.

136
00:15:55,049 --> 00:16:02,814
And on the bottom there are mountains,
rivers and roads.

137
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:06,045
And great big monsters, too.

138
00:16:07,086 --> 00:16:08,915
M-o-n-s-t-e-r-s.

139
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:11,877
Monsters.

140
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:16,886
Their eyes light up and fire
comes out of their mouths.

141
00:16:19,923 --> 00:16:23,913
But the men from outer space
defeat them.

142
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,020
I'm a man from the Andromeda galaxy.

143
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:35,886
I've come to save the world.

144
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:40,021
I look like an ordinary human but...

145
00:16:40,998 --> 00:16:47,989
in reality I'm a man from outer space.
From the nebula of Andromeda.

146
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:50,033
Andromeda...

147
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:54,023
Good! You've got it.

148
00:16:54,935 --> 00:17:02,836
I've come to kill all the bad people
who want to destroy the earth.

149
00:17:02,837 --> 00:17:05,805
I'm a Messenger of Justice,
a cosmic messenger.

150
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:18,932
We've done it seven times so far.

151
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,801
Only twice didn't it turn out well.

152
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:27,869
I've gotten much better at it.

153
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:31,837
Now I can get hit without getting hurt.

154
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:35,973
The worst is, when the doctors
examine me.

155
00:17:36,815 --> 00:17:39,783
I always feel they'll know I'm lying.

156
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:45,919
Father taught me how to say "it hurts"
while holding my breath.

157
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,752
Soon we 'Il arrive in Onomichi.
Shikoku can't be seen anymore.

158
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:58,719
Mother gives me a hundred yen
each time and soon...

159
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:00,713
I' II have a thousand yen.

160
00:18:40,904 --> 00:18:41,904
Does it hurt?

161
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:42,971
A little.

162
00:18:56,743 --> 00:18:57,743
Boy!

163
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,673
Does it hurt?

164
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:09,777
You should've been more careful!

165
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,804
Sorry. Boy, I am sorry.

166
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:19,679
You'd better stay here and have
a thorough examination.

167
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:25,681
But we must leave. We already
bought our tickets.

168
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:27,911
Can't we settle this?

169
00:19:27,953 --> 00:19:31,886
All right. I'll settle for fifty
thousand yen... in cash.

170
00:19:31,955 --> 00:19:36,786
How can a simple driver like me find
fifty thousand yen so easily?

171
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:38,942
Then we'll go to the police.

172
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,847
All right, let's go then.

173
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:47,860
Aren't you sorry you hit our boy like that?

174
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:05,756
WAIVER OF LIABILITY

175
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:18,860
Will you have lunch?

176
00:20:19,838 --> 00:20:20,838
None for me.

177
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:22,829
Me neither.

178
00:20:22,904 --> 00:20:23,801
Boy?

179
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:24,838
Later.

180
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:26,758
T ell me when you want some.

181
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:33,808
Can't you do anything but yawn?

182
00:20:33,874 --> 00:20:34,806
What?

183
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:36,808
I don't know.

184
00:20:37,844 --> 00:20:41,742
If I were in Osaka I could play cards.

185
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,741
No gambling! We're not going
to waste any money.

186
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,678
Who said I want to gamble?

187
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:49,839
Go play pachinko.

188
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:52,770
You can't win on that.

189
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,646
It's no fun not having your own home.

190
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:05,777
What are you talking about?
This place is nice enough.

191
00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:08,819
Where are you going?

192
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:09,853
Toilet.

193
00:21:42,764 --> 00:21:48,563
Kokura, Wakamatsu, Tobata, Yahata...

194
00:21:53,634 --> 00:21:56,602
It's all right. Never mind.

195
00:22:03,738 --> 00:22:04,761
Aren't you hungry?

196
00:22:05,572 --> 00:22:06,572
Where is boy?

197
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:08,663
So he's run away?

198
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:09,739
Possibly.

199
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:16,640
He had not enough money so far but
you're the one who gave it to him.

200
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:21,543
But if you're worried take the money back.

201
00:22:22,644 --> 00:22:23,702
I'm pregnant.

202
00:22:29,546 --> 00:22:30,546
What will we do?

203
00:22:30,814 --> 00:22:34,611
We can't do anything about it.

204
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:36,639
Is it all right then?

205
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:37,716
It's all right.

206
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,578
You mean it?

207
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,550
No, go get an abortion.

208
00:22:47,622 --> 00:22:49,694
We can't go on living like this
not with another one.

209
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:51,589
You must get a job.

210
00:22:51,626 --> 00:22:52,684
We need a decent home.

211
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:56,694
We must send the children to school.

212
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,587
Stop it!

213
00:23:02,532 --> 00:23:04,557
Let's not rush things.

214
00:23:05,701 --> 00:23:09,568
We'll go on like we have for a while.

215
00:23:10,705 --> 00:23:12,797
After all, we've saved a little.

216
00:23:13,574 --> 00:23:14,767
I wonder what he thinks.

217
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:16,766
About what?

218
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:18,708
About me.

219
00:23:20,544 --> 00:23:24,640
You were separated from your parents
when you were four, weren't you?

220
00:23:24,815 --> 00:23:27,806
Yes, my stepmother got married four times.

221
00:23:30,585 --> 00:23:31,712
You'll wake the baby.

222
00:23:32,654 --> 00:23:36,713
I hated her. I really thought it was
better to be completely alone.

223
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:39,557
Then he's probably thinking the same.

224
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:42,760
Stop it! Not until we decide
whether I can have this baby.

225
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:45,720
Do whatever you want.

226
00:23:46,663 --> 00:23:47,663
I want it.

227
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,799
But I don't.

228
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,633
Then I' II have an abortion.

229
00:23:53,568 --> 00:23:55,762
I'll get a doctor tomorrow?

230
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:57,795
I won't do it here.

231
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:03,767
I lived a long time in Fukui
I know a good doctor there.

232
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,611
Very well. Let's go to Fukui then.

233
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,703
When?

234
00:24:10,747 --> 00:24:14,545
Right now. I'll pay the
bill, you go and pack.

235
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,551
We don't have to rush.
The boy isn't even here.

236
00:24:17,618 --> 00:24:18,744
You think he ran off?

237
00:24:18,787 --> 00:24:20,616
What if he has?

238
00:24:20,754 --> 00:24:22,687
We'll think about it later.

239
00:24:24,723 --> 00:24:27,749
I'm fed up! Pregnant and all.

240
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:29,751
You're getting an abortion.

241
00:24:30,528 --> 00:24:31,585
When I say no, it's no.

242
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:34,527
Boy can't run away.

243
00:24:34,563 --> 00:24:35,757
Shit, sure he can!

244
00:24:36,732 --> 00:24:38,756
Go look for him, if you're so worried!

245
00:24:40,535 --> 00:24:44,526
I'll take the baby and go to
the station getting the tickets.

246
00:25:14,758 --> 00:25:19,558
Why do you look like that?
You bumped into us.

247
00:25:19,695 --> 00:25:20,752
I'm sorry.

248
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:28,591
What do you mean bumping
into us like that?

249
00:25:28,634 --> 00:25:30,498
I was reading.

250
00:25:30,536 --> 00:25:32,662
Some excuse! You won't get away with it.

251
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:36,729
I really didn't mean to.

252
00:25:37,574 --> 00:25:41,532
All right then, but you have to
give us some... compensation.

253
00:25:42,578 --> 00:25:43,578
Compensation?

254
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:50,481
Yes, money! You hit us and we need
some for the hospital bills.

255
00:25:57,521 --> 00:25:59,751
One thousand! That's all?

256
00:26:01,623 --> 00:26:04,751
Just be careful from now on.

257
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,459
And don't you look at me like that!

258
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:35,605
What are you looking at?

259
00:27:19,546 --> 00:27:20,546
Mother!

260
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,709
Where have you been?

261
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:29,513
Well, I was...

262
00:27:29,652 --> 00:27:30,676
Running away, weren't you?

263
00:27:30,686 --> 00:27:31,551
No.

264
00:27:31,686 --> 00:27:33,551
You won't get away so easily.

265
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:34,615
What's the matter?

266
00:27:34,656 --> 00:27:37,556
We're going away. We have to hurry.

267
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:39,418
My hat...

268
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:40,457
What about it?

269
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:42,527
I was drying it.

270
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:43,619
It's junk! Throw it away!

271
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,447
You want to get killed?

272
00:29:10,656 --> 00:29:12,418
How about here?

273
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:33,627
Wait. Isn't this too expensive?

274
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,605
We're going to have the best.

275
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:41,441
Come on, now. Cheer up, we're
going to have a good time.

276
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,543
I envy you - all together like this.

277
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:52,659
I wish I had a father like him.
Isn't that true, boy?

278
00:30:53,565 --> 00:30:54,622
Yes.

279
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,557
Would you like another song?

280
00:30:57,635 --> 00:30:59,568
Well, let's see...

281
00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:01,528
What would you like?

282
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:03,629
How about a popular song?

283
00:31:04,506 --> 00:31:05,632
Where are you from?

284
00:31:06,441 --> 00:31:07,567
From Fukui.

285
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,377
Actually, we're from Kochi.

286
00:31:10,446 --> 00:31:12,605
Then we'll do a Kochi song.

287
00:31:19,485 --> 00:31:27,452
"On the bridge at Kochi, once
there was a priest..."

288
00:31:28,524 --> 00:31:36,492
"He bought a woman ' s hair pin.
Whatever for? Whatever for?"

289
00:32:11,658 --> 00:32:14,257
"How long it's been..."

290
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:28,400
"Since I left Kochi..."

291
00:32:28,504 --> 00:32:31,503
"I remember my friends..."

292
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:41,503
"That day I left"

293
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:03,485
Even if you go back there, your
grandmother won't be pleased.

294
00:33:05,564 --> 00:33:10,432
They were very happy when you left.

295
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:15,370
It's true. They wrote me that in a letter.

296
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:19,601
They've forgotten all about you at school.

297
00:33:21,476 --> 00:33:23,568
Even your desk is gone now.

298
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:25,602
Understand?

299
00:33:33,473 --> 00:33:37,595
"Since I swore..."

300
00:33:38,403 --> 00:33:43,422
"To serve my country..."

301
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:48,453
"How can I die vanquished?"

302
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:54,289
"When I hear the trumpet sound..."

303
00:33:54,392 --> 00:33:58,584
"I remember my country's flag"

304
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:04,416
"Travelling through the fields..."

305
00:34:04,553 --> 00:34:09,448
"Where trees are burning..."

306
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:14,473
"My brave horse trotting..."

307
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:19,332
"Following my flag..."

308
00:34:20,343 --> 00:34:25,329
"How then can I die vanquished?"

309
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:30,430
"Cannons, tanks, bayonets..."

310
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:35,493
"All left behind..."

311
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,489
"Last night in a dream..."

312
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:46,350
"My father said: Don't die, son,
come back alive..."

313
00:34:47,226 --> 00:34:51,384
"I awoke and saw but the enemy's sky"

314
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:30,254
DEPARTURES

315
00:35:46,256 --> 00:35:48,311
Some bread, please.

316
00:35:50,187 --> 00:35:53,345
Fifteen rolls, please,
and five packs of gum.

317
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:07,199
One thousand four hundred yen...

318
00:36:07,276 --> 00:36:09,137
divided by two...

319
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:11,203
makes seven hundred.

320
00:36:27,263 --> 00:36:30,023
One half-fare to Kochi.

321
00:36:30,128 --> 00:36:31,252
Which Kochi?

322
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,048
The Kochi in Shikoku.

323
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:42,280
1,500 yen.

324
00:36:43,186 --> 00:36:46,242
I'm under twelve, so it's half-fare.

325
00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:49,206
You're older than that.

326
00:36:50,115 --> 00:36:53,102
You're wearing your school
uniform. 1,500 yen!

327
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:56,210
I've only got 1,000 yen.

328
00:36:56,278 --> 00:36:59,037
Then you can't go to Shikoku.

329
00:36:59,109 --> 00:37:01,039
Have you run away?

330
00:37:01,108 --> 00:37:04,004
No. I was lying, when I said Shikoku.

331
00:37:04,107 --> 00:37:06,094
If you want to lie, go home.

332
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:13,133
I want to go to Amano-hashidate.

333
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,062
Another fib?

334
00:37:16,232 --> 00:37:19,128
It's true this time.

335
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:22,085
All right then.

336
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,082
Two hundred thirty yen.

337
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,120
Seven hundred seventy back.

338
00:37:44,215 --> 00:37:49,144
Seven, eight, nine... for the third day...

339
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:57,953
ten, eleven, twelve...
for the fourth day...

340
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:50,332
Grandmother, here I am. I'm back.

341
00:42:04,202 --> 00:42:06,171
See, I'm here.

342
00:42:07,173 --> 00:42:11,306
I rode the train for four days
and was in the boat all alone.

343
00:42:11,382 --> 00:42:16,287
And I only ate bread.
I ate fifteen rolls.

344
00:42:49,382 --> 00:42:52,410
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep now.

345
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:06,211
Good night.

346
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:09,216
Tomorrow...

347
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:13,384
wake me up any time.

348
00:44:44,323 --> 00:44:46,292
How much does a doctor cost?

349
00:44:46,293 --> 00:44:47,386
For what?

350
00:44:47,495 --> 00:44:49,465
For that... abortion.

351
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,494
About this much.

352
00:44:53,306 --> 00:44:57,439
Then an emergency might
cost about that much.

353
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:03,479
Today, we'll get 70,000 yen.

354
00:45:04,292 --> 00:45:06,261
We're getting expensive.

355
00:45:08,267 --> 00:45:09,358
That much, right?

356
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:52,518
I'll go with Mom.

357
00:46:56,593 --> 00:46:58,460
All right, go then.

358
00:47:06,512 --> 00:47:08,640
Does it hurt?

359
00:47:09,417 --> 00:47:10,431
No. I was just clumsy.

360
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:14,452
You should tell me, if it hurts.

361
00:47:15,487 --> 00:47:17,453
Just a little.

362
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,545
Good. It'll look more real and more
serious to the doctor.

363
00:47:24,419 --> 00:47:29,510
And since it's swollen, we won't
have to inject anything.

364
00:47:31,352 --> 00:47:33,408
It's hard for you too, isn't it?

365
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:34,508
You...

366
00:47:36,351 --> 00:47:37,357
You...

367
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:40,310
What is it?

368
00:47:43,415 --> 00:47:45,540
Do I still have to go today?

369
00:47:46,348 --> 00:47:50,303
Of course. That's why we came to Fukui...

370
00:47:50,481 --> 00:47:53,310
and kept this room.

371
00:47:57,312 --> 00:48:00,369
Just don't look up any old friends.

372
00:48:01,446 --> 00:48:05,274
You don't have to tell me.
How could I face them?

373
00:48:07,377 --> 00:48:10,467
I'll take the baby to the
department store with me.

374
00:48:12,276 --> 00:48:14,299
It'll be over in an hour.

375
00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:16,338
Then there's no work today?

376
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:19,370
You go with your mother.

377
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:24,467
What do you mean by that?

378
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:31,267
I'm not so sure, that you're really
going to a doctor.

379
00:48:49,435 --> 00:48:52,264
Why did you come back?

380
00:48:52,501 --> 00:48:54,467
I thought you never would.

381
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:55,506
Why?

382
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,390
I don't know.

383
00:48:58,266 --> 00:48:59,459
But I did come back.

384
00:49:00,233 --> 00:49:02,198
Yes, but...

385
00:49:14,395 --> 00:49:17,327
I've been to this hospital before.

386
00:49:18,428 --> 00:49:22,326
I was with a man. Do you
understand things like that?

387
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,266
A little.

388
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:27,216
Now, go play somewhere.

389
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,383
For about an hour?

390
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:31,187
Be back in about two hours.

391
00:50:52,175 --> 00:50:56,316
Bastard! You were spying on me. You
wanted to tell your father, didn't you?

392
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:01,332
Go on, say something.

393
00:51:01,377 --> 00:51:05,152
I know, I'm just your stepmother...

394
00:51:06,127 --> 00:51:09,366
and you hate me. You're worse
than he is!

395
00:51:12,316 --> 00:51:13,326
Come on, say something.

396
00:51:15,261 --> 00:51:16,230
I'm sorry.

397
00:51:16,264 --> 00:51:20,235
Why apologize? Don't be such
a hypocrite.

398
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:23,154
I know you tell him bad things
about me.

399
00:51:23,357 --> 00:51:24,384
No, I don't.

400
00:51:26,201 --> 00:51:27,262
You're lying.

401
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:31,415
All children hate their
step-parents.

402
00:51:33,194 --> 00:51:34,405
It's natural that you hate me.

403
00:51:35,277 --> 00:51:38,196
You hate me, so you spy on me.

404
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,208
Come on, say that you hate me.

405
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,569
Do I have to say that?

406
00:51:45,451 --> 00:51:46,516
Well, what does it matter!

407
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:49,506
I don't think anything about anything.

408
00:51:50,554 --> 00:51:51,563
Stupid boy!

409
00:51:56,566 --> 00:52:00,356
Anything you would like?
I've got some money.

410
00:52:00,462 --> 00:52:01,471
I'd like a watch.

411
00:52:01,603 --> 00:52:02,576
A wrist watch?

412
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,463
With the date and the day.

413
00:52:05,499 --> 00:52:06,632
That's expensive.

414
00:52:07,479 --> 00:52:08,488
Well, forget it.

415
00:52:08,554 --> 00:52:12,515
I'll get you one, but don't you
tell your father then.

416
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:14,462
You really will?

417
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:18,689
Well... your mother went
to the hospital...

418
00:52:19,568 --> 00:52:22,682
and boy played for two hours
in the park.

419
00:52:22,759 --> 00:52:24,635
Sure... I played in the park.

420
00:52:27,662 --> 00:52:30,672
Don't show it to him. It's our secret.

421
00:52:33,605 --> 00:52:34,614
What day's today?

422
00:52:35,755 --> 00:52:36,764
Wednesday.

423
00:52:37,736 --> 00:52:39,739
No, Friday. The day after tomorrow
is Sunday.

424
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:42,896
Every day's like Sunday.

425
00:52:42,907 --> 00:52:44,888
I'll leave it on Sunday.

426
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:49,650
You'll be able to go to school someday.

427
00:52:49,925 --> 00:52:51,837
I guess so.

428
00:52:51,872 --> 00:52:56,807
You'll go to school, he'll go to
kindergarten and I'll have another baby.

429
00:52:56,842 --> 00:52:58,720
When, though?

430
00:52:58,756 --> 00:52:59,923
Real soon.

431
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:05,830
We'll work hard and save as much as we can.

432
00:53:07,857 --> 00:53:10,844
We need a lot, right?

433
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:12,985
Yes, we need a lot.

434
00:53:13,868 --> 00:53:14,932
We need a lot, right?

435
00:53:22,028 --> 00:53:25,015
We've been to lots of places...

436
00:53:26,091 --> 00:53:27,101
Tsuruga...

437
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,049
Nishimaizuru...

438
00:53:29,953 --> 00:53:32,025
Kanazawa, Toyama

439
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:38,076
If you look at a map, they all
are in the Sea of Japan.

440
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:51,167
Father says we're getting more
and more experience.

441
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,326
Since it really hurts now...

442
00:54:01,148 --> 00:54:04,229
I don't have to lie to the doctor.

443
00:54:05,313 --> 00:54:09,172
Even an ordinary child can
say that it hurts...

444
00:54:09,443 --> 00:54:11,425
when it really hurts.

445
00:54:15,387 --> 00:54:18,272
My younger brother has grown.

446
00:54:18,442 --> 00:54:22,268
He understands more of what I say now.

447
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:25,521
He always asks me to tell him...

448
00:54:26,401 --> 00:54:28,381
about the men from outer space.

449
00:55:23,924 --> 00:55:26,671
Some of these appear to be old.

450
00:55:26,779 --> 00:55:28,782
Have you been hurt before?

451
00:55:30,742 --> 00:55:31,807
It hurts! Stop it!

452
00:55:32,857 --> 00:55:36,979
We'll take X-rays, but he won't
recover before a month.

453
00:55:37,759 --> 00:55:40,943
A month! Look, I didn't hit
him that hard.

454
00:55:42,864 --> 00:55:44,936
May I use the telephone?

455
00:55:46,961 --> 00:55:48,873
Give me the police.

456
00:55:48,942 --> 00:55:51,827
And you're not even sorry?

457
00:55:51,897 --> 00:55:53,936
Look, I'm a car mechanic.

458
00:55:54,046 --> 00:55:56,085
I know what a car looks
like that's hit someone.

459
00:55:59,922 --> 00:56:01,056
Does it hurt?

460
00:56:48,414 --> 00:56:54,321
Stop it! Taking a sick child out like
this... keeping him up so late...

461
00:56:54,524 --> 00:56:56,332
Is this how the police act?

462
00:57:09,603 --> 00:57:11,376
Get things ready.

463
00:57:11,416 --> 00:57:12,548
Everything is settled?

464
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:16,613
He's paying 60,000 yen! I'll get
it at the station.

465
00:57:17,425 --> 00:57:19,499
Then there is no rush.

466
00:57:19,609 --> 00:57:24,405
Yes. We can't stay here. The
police might call us again.

467
00:57:24,478 --> 00:57:25,542
It's that bad?

468
00:57:25,586 --> 00:57:28,541
Just a hunch. They took our pictures.

469
00:57:28,542 --> 00:57:30,454
It's not the first time.

470
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:31,725
I know. That's why.

471
00:57:32,739 --> 00:57:35,751
Come on, get up.

472
00:58:35,131 --> 00:58:36,838
What is it?

473
00:58:36,945 --> 00:58:38,010
Where are we going?

474
00:58:39,094 --> 00:58:40,902
The tickets are for Fukushima.

475
00:58:41,007 --> 00:58:42,141
We've already passed it.

476
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:44,934
Is that so?

477
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:47,111
Really, where are we going?

478
00:58:47,187 --> 00:58:50,140
We'll keep changing trains for two days.

479
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,949
You're joking!

480
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:57,022
You should know better.
You really think I'm joking?

481
00:59:09,315 --> 00:59:11,296
We've been photographed before.

482
00:59:12,204 --> 00:59:14,311
But this was the second time for me.

483
00:59:15,326 --> 00:59:21,361
If they compare them,
they'll know who I am.

484
00:59:22,279 --> 00:59:23,446
The same goes for me.

485
00:59:24,226 --> 00:59:26,264
Yes, but I've got a record.

486
00:59:29,363 --> 00:59:34,493
We're going to stop and
change our clothes too.

487
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:03,641
It's already winter.

488
01:00:05,577 --> 01:00:06,633
Yes, it is.

489
01:00:26,649 --> 01:00:28,478
Can you see?

490
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:30,541
Yes, I can see.

491
01:00:30,617 --> 01:00:34,414
They make you dizzy when
you're not used to them.

492
01:00:48,522 --> 01:00:50,488
Do I have to keep them on?

493
01:00:51,589 --> 01:00:52,612
Except when you sleep.

494
01:00:53,456 --> 01:00:54,456
They hurt my eyes.

495
01:00:54,523 --> 01:01:00,548
Naturally! We bought them for your
mother. They wouldn't fit you.

496
01:01:02,393 --> 01:01:05,359
You wear them instead of her.

497
01:01:07,659 --> 01:01:12,592
We'll put up at different
hotels for a few days.

498
01:01:21,431 --> 01:01:23,397
This isn't getting warm.

499
01:01:32,468 --> 01:01:33,626
It's broken.

500
01:01:40,569 --> 01:01:43,365
The heater's broken! Do you
have another one?

501
01:01:43,404 --> 01:01:47,360
No, we don't. It'll get warmer
after a while.

502
01:01:58,574 --> 01:02:02,371
You can have a stove, but you
must pay for the charcoal.

503
01:02:02,443 --> 01:02:03,465
Where is the telephone?

504
01:02:03,542 --> 01:02:04,542
Over there.

505
01:02:23,415 --> 01:02:27,314
Hotel Prince? Room 312, please!

506
01:02:30,351 --> 01:02:31,351
It's me.

507
01:02:33,419 --> 01:02:35,317
Nothing special, but...

508
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,509
Hello? Hello!

509
01:02:40,353 --> 01:02:42,411
Don't try too hard now.

510
01:02:42,521 --> 01:02:44,544
Mind your own business.

511
01:02:45,522 --> 01:02:47,351
You want the stove?

512
01:02:53,524 --> 01:02:54,547
Mother!

513
01:03:00,459 --> 01:03:01,459
What's wrong.

514
01:03:09,362 --> 01:03:11,420
Nothing! Go on back.

515
01:03:54,508 --> 01:03:58,270
Thirteenth, fourteenth...

516
01:03:58,508 --> 01:04:03,374
fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth...

517
01:04:06,278 --> 01:04:09,336
eighteenth, nineteenth

518
01:04:13,379 --> 01:04:15,403
I won't show it to him, all right?

519
01:04:17,281 --> 01:04:18,473
It doesn't matter now.

520
01:04:19,515 --> 01:04:22,413
Let's go see your father.

521
01:05:03,494 --> 01:05:05,222
Third floor?

522
01:05:09,329 --> 01:05:11,318
Shall I call him?

523
01:05:19,232 --> 01:05:20,232
Daddy!

524
01:06:02,411 --> 01:06:03,411
Be careful, you!

525
01:06:08,445 --> 01:06:11,174
Shall we do it, mother?

526
01:06:36,286 --> 01:06:37,286
Mother!

527
01:06:37,387 --> 01:06:39,216
Are you alright?

528
01:06:39,255 --> 01:06:40,255
Mother!

529
01:06:42,255 --> 01:06:44,313
Are you hurt?

530
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:46,382
Why do you drive at night?

531
01:06:47,289 --> 01:06:50,257
Thank God, you weren't hit!

532
01:06:50,325 --> 01:06:54,257
What do you mean?
I'm in my fourth month.

533
01:06:54,391 --> 01:06:56,290
I'll drive you to the hospital.

534
01:06:56,392 --> 01:07:00,155
Not the hospital.
The police is best.

535
01:07:01,159 --> 01:07:02,353
Go call an ambulance.

536
01:07:03,128 --> 01:07:04,252
No, get in my car.

537
01:07:04,361 --> 01:07:05,384
No, get an ambulance.

538
01:07:07,261 --> 01:07:08,261
Wait, please!

539
01:07:10,163 --> 01:07:12,355
Perhaps... some money...

540
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:16,260
Don't talk like that!
We don't want your money!

541
01:07:17,196 --> 01:07:21,324
I know, but really... it would be better
if we didn't go to the police.

542
01:07:23,132 --> 01:07:24,155
How much?

543
01:07:24,398 --> 01:07:28,229
I'll give you whatever you want.

544
01:08:13,275 --> 01:08:17,107
You go to the department store
and I'll get two hotels.

545
01:08:17,244 --> 01:08:18,244
Not the same?

546
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:19,310
Of course not.

547
01:08:19,344 --> 01:08:22,038
Then we'll do it again tonight.

548
01:08:22,345 --> 01:08:23,345
Again?

549
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:26,068
We did it last night.

550
01:08:30,112 --> 01:08:33,079
Boy, you have to wear your glasses.

551
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:36,179
I made him throw them away.

552
01:08:37,348 --> 01:08:39,246
We'll do it together.

553
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:43,181
Go on, get your two hotels.
Let's go, boy.

554
01:09:12,222 --> 01:09:17,087
I'm still pregnant, you see? I'm going
to save money for the baby.

555
01:09:19,023 --> 01:09:22,081
I'm gonna have that baby!
That's why... you idiot!

556
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,025
Let's go, boy.

557
01:09:38,994 --> 01:09:39,994
Where to?

558
01:09:41,028 --> 01:09:42,221
Some place in an airplane.

559
01:09:42,295 --> 01:09:44,022
An airplane... really?

560
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:48,993
We'll be men from outer space!

561
01:09:49,163 --> 01:09:50,203
You want to fly that much?

562
01:09:50,297 --> 01:09:51,990
Then we're not?

563
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:53,224
Yes, we will!

564
01:09:56,032 --> 01:09:58,191
Where do you think you're going?

565
01:09:58,999 --> 01:10:00,090
Hokkaido.

566
01:10:10,967 --> 01:10:12,059
Even if you say no!

567
01:10:12,968 --> 01:10:15,991
I want to go there, too.

568
01:10:16,203 --> 01:10:19,965
Yes, Hokkaido would be all right.

569
01:10:20,003 --> 01:10:25,995
Look, clouds... a whole
sea of clouds!

570
01:10:26,038 --> 01:10:29,232
And there are monsters
in this sea.

571
01:10:30,238 --> 01:10:33,966
Bird-monsters, butterfly-monsters...

572
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,096
Monsters...

573
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,040
Yes, monsters.

574
01:10:38,073 --> 01:10:42,200
Men from outer space will come
flying out of those clouds.

575
01:10:44,175 --> 01:10:49,199
They always know right away
where the monsters are.

576
01:10:50,009 --> 01:10:55,170
They come all the way from
Andromeda.

577
01:10:56,044 --> 01:10:58,101
All from Andromeda...

578
01:10:59,179 --> 01:11:02,906
We really went to Hokkaido.

579
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:08,977
I had been brought up in Kochi, and
I had never seen snow before.

580
01:11:10,114 --> 01:11:16,014
It was white, very white...
a whole sea of snow.

581
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:28,883
Hakodate, Iwagaiama, Obihira...

582
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:34,984
Kushiro, Abashiri, Ashahikawa
Wakkanai...

583
01:11:35,186 --> 01:11:39,085
Father had told us not to
work, but...

584
01:11:40,021 --> 01:11:42,112
mother and I did anyway.

585
01:11:43,954 --> 01:11:46,079
We worked around the stations.

586
01:11:46,922 --> 01:11:50,082
It was too cold to walk far.

587
01:11:58,957 --> 01:12:00,925
"Furthest Northern Point"

588
01:12:01,058 --> 01:12:03,888
"Latitude 45*31"

589
01:12:03,891 --> 01:12:05,916
"Japan's Northern Point"

590
01:12:06,059 --> 01:12:09,082
"Further East: Sea of Okhotsk"

591
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:11,117
"West: Sea of Japan"

592
01:12:11,893 --> 01:12:15,983
"Meeting of two Seas"

593
01:12:16,859 --> 01:12:24,853
"Sakhalin, 23 miles away, is
visible in clear weather".

594
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:29,117
Come on, eat them.

595
01:12:34,889 --> 01:12:37,047
They are made with real sake.

596
01:12:37,122 --> 01:12:38,322
Makes them taste very special.

597
01:12:45,954 --> 01:12:48,886
I wonder if I'll ever come back here.

598
01:12:48,921 --> 01:12:51,886
Why not, if we have money.

599
01:12:51,987 --> 01:12:53,918
Is this the end of Japan?

600
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:58,817
Yes, over there it's not Japan.
Why do you ask?

601
01:12:58,853 --> 01:13:00,874
We've been everywhere -
nowhere else to go.

602
01:13:02,018 --> 01:13:03,984
Only outer space is left.

603
01:13:04,952 --> 01:13:08,905
Let's get an apartment and
live decently.

604
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:09,974
You mean it?

605
01:13:11,017 --> 01:13:12,915
We've already made a lot of
money.

606
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:18,845
You think, that 600,000 yen
is that much?

607
01:13:18,882 --> 01:13:24,871
If we get an apartment and buy
supplies it'll be gone in three months.

608
01:13:24,948 --> 01:13:26,810
But you'll get a job.

609
01:13:26,847 --> 01:13:29,040
What do you mean?
I'm an invalid...

610
01:13:29,914 --> 01:13:32,879
You knew that from the very first...

611
01:13:33,914 --> 01:13:35,970
I wish Japan were bigger.

612
01:13:42,845 --> 01:13:45,834
Stop it! Don't do it now.

613
01:13:46,811 --> 01:13:51,765
We've done it for two days now.
We should stop for a while...

614
01:13:52,944 --> 01:13:56,807
I'll get a good hotel. We'll
have another party.

615
01:13:56,976 --> 01:13:59,907
This will kill us, if we go on.

616
01:14:00,976 --> 01:14:03,907
It's too late now.

617
01:14:04,009 --> 01:14:07,805
No! We'll hide for three months...

618
01:14:07,974 --> 01:14:11,804
It'll work... even if we start
again from Kyushu.

619
01:14:12,774 --> 01:14:13,774
I've had enough.

620
01:14:13,874 --> 01:14:18,805
That's why I'm working
so hard now.

621
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:24,839
What are you doing?

622
01:14:35,736 --> 01:14:39,691
All right... I understand.
We'll stop.

623
01:14:40,003 --> 01:14:45,697
No, it's too dangerous, let's separate
for a while. All right?

624
01:14:49,834 --> 01:14:50,892
You've understood that much.

625
01:14:50,967 --> 01:14:53,660
Then I'll take the boy.

626
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:54,700
What?

627
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:55,958
You take the baby.

628
01:14:56,934 --> 01:14:58,900
Oh no, you don't!

629
01:14:58,933 --> 01:15:01,727
But it's better this way.

630
01:15:06,765 --> 01:15:10,663
You know damn well that me
and you are done.

631
01:15:10,898 --> 01:15:13,693
We can go on by ourselves.

632
01:15:25,795 --> 01:15:26,761
How old are you?

633
01:15:26,795 --> 01:15:27,795
T en.

634
01:15:27,863 --> 01:15:28,863
Where were you born?

635
01:15:28,898 --> 01:15:29,898
Osaka.

636
01:15:31,731 --> 01:15:32,756
Whose child are you?

637
01:15:34,899 --> 01:15:39,799
You're mine, aren't you?
I'm your father.

638
01:15:43,736 --> 01:15:44,828
What are you doing?

639
01:15:49,639 --> 01:15:50,639
Boy!

640
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,670
Mother, let's go.

641
01:15:56,642 --> 01:15:57,642
Give me that!

642
01:15:59,776 --> 01:16:04,733
Trying to bribe him by buying
him watches like this?

643
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,607
Go pick it up!

644
01:16:07,713 --> 01:16:08,713
Pick it up!

645
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:09,780
What?

646
01:16:10,648 --> 01:16:11,706
Bastard!

647
01:16:16,651 --> 01:16:17,651
Baby!

648
01:16:17,684 --> 01:16:18,843
Go! Out of here!

649
01:19:33,698 --> 01:19:34,698
Boy!

650
01:19:35,599 --> 01:19:37,566
Come, come up here!

651
01:19:48,505 --> 01:19:51,529
Sit... over here!

652
01:20:03,645 --> 01:20:06,737
I've died already once,
during the war.

653
01:20:07,712 --> 01:20:10,736
My left shoulder, arm...
shattered.

654
01:20:12,715 --> 01:20:16,740
And you call that work? You've never
even had a broken arm!

655
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:20,608
Have you ever thought you'd die?

656
01:20:21,753 --> 01:20:26,482
All you do is bump into a
car and then scream.

657
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:29,579
You think I should be
grateful for that?

658
01:20:30,555 --> 01:20:34,511
Then you can go on and say
that I'm not your father?

659
01:20:35,658 --> 01:20:37,716
You don't know what war
is like, do you?

660
01:20:38,693 --> 01:20:42,558
You take a crap and the next
minute your head's blowing off.

661
01:20:42,728 --> 01:20:47,662
I've been there... moments
between life and death.

662
01:20:48,530 --> 01:20:51,621
Not only did I see it, it was
just like being dead myself.

663
01:20:52,665 --> 01:20:55,724
And then you come and say
I'm no good?

664
01:20:55,733 --> 01:20:58,700
- That's nonsense...
- Shut up!

665
01:20:59,534 --> 01:21:05,470
Wouldn't you be sorry to leave
a husband, a father like me?

666
01:21:07,471 --> 01:21:10,564
Boy... you think you can go on
living like this?

667
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:15,607
Dead... she's dead.

668
01:21:15,675 --> 01:21:17,573
In the accident?

669
01:21:18,542 --> 01:21:19,736
Maybe I killed her.

670
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:23,438
Don't think about that!

671
01:21:26,445 --> 01:21:27,469
Throw this crap away!

672
01:21:27,647 --> 01:21:28,647
Idiot!

673
01:21:29,614 --> 01:21:31,637
What do you think you're doing?

674
01:21:35,649 --> 01:21:38,616
Bastard! Why didn't you die
in your war?

675
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:41,518
Father, husband! Some joke!

676
01:21:41,519 --> 01:21:43,542
Just now, you were about
to run away!

677
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:49,450
You're the one who was happy
when the boy really got hurt.

678
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:57,447
All right... then kill us all!

679
01:21:57,491 --> 01:22:00,458
I'll kill you all right!

680
01:22:01,694 --> 01:22:07,595
You can kill me, but not
my unborn child!

681
01:22:07,596 --> 01:22:11,496
Bitch! I'll strangle you...
I will!

682
01:22:12,664 --> 01:22:14,632
What's going on?

683
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:17,602
Nothing.

684
01:22:17,704 --> 01:22:19,541
Shall I take the baby?

685
01:22:19,578 --> 01:22:21,483
No, it's all right.

686
01:23:43,733 --> 01:23:45,867
So, I'll die then.

687
01:23:53,706 --> 01:23:56,843
Good-bye Mother.
Good-bye Father.

688
01:23:56,851 --> 01:23:57,854
Brother!

689
01:24:03,911 --> 01:24:05,781
Brother!

690
01:24:06,721 --> 01:24:08,752
Go on back now... go on.

691
01:24:08,997 --> 01:24:10,902
Brother!

692
01:24:16,024 --> 01:24:17,964
Brother!

693
01:24:19,035 --> 01:24:21,773
Go back... go on back!

694
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:31,945
I'm going where no one else
but I can go.

695
01:24:45,068 --> 01:24:51,856
Brother... brother... brother!

696
01:24:55,944 --> 01:24:58,009
I understand. Don't cry.

697
01:25:25,155 --> 01:25:27,187
You know what this is?

698
01:25:29,037 --> 01:25:34,011
It's not an ordinary snowman.
It's a man from outer space.

699
01:25:35,195 --> 01:25:36,198
Outer space...

700
01:25:37,035 --> 01:25:38,198
That's it. Now watch.

701
01:26:20,233 --> 01:26:26,189
You understand now, don't you?
He came all the way from Andromeda.

702
01:26:28,331 --> 01:26:30,304
Andromeda...

703
01:26:31,175 --> 01:26:34,278
He's a messenger of justice...

704
01:26:36,262 --> 01:26:42,240
who came to destroy all bad men.

705
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:50,372
He's not afraid. Not even of
monsters.

706
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:53,352
Not even of trains and cars.

707
01:26:56,238 --> 01:27:00,277
If he runs into them... they break.

708
01:27:01,392 --> 01:27:05,361
He never gets hurt,
he never cries.

709
01:27:06,378 --> 01:27:08,283
He doesn't even have any tears.

710
01:27:16,516 --> 01:27:20,361
He has no parents, he's all alone.

711
01:27:21,401 --> 01:27:23,432
No mother, no father.

712
01:27:27,358 --> 01:27:33,336
When he's really afraid, then other
outer space men come and save him.

713
01:27:34,351 --> 01:27:37,385
I was going to become
someone just like him.

714
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,334
That's what I wanted.

715
01:27:40,508 --> 01:27:43,542
But I couldn't. I'm just
an ordinary boy.

716
01:27:44,489 --> 01:27:46,463
I don't even know how to die.

717
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:51,438
You stupid thing... you idiot!

718
01:29:25,608 --> 01:29:27,371
Is it Sunday?

719
01:29:27,644 --> 01:29:31,444
Getting ready for Christmas.

720
01:29:31,481 --> 01:29:33,346
The day Christ died?

721
01:29:33,416 --> 01:29:37,410
No, the day he was born.

722
01:29:43,594 --> 01:29:46,461
And then we stopped working.

723
01:29:47,498 --> 01:29:52,527
We went back to Kochi
and then to Osaka.

724
01:29:53,472 --> 01:29:56,408
Now we live in a real house.

725
01:29:57,376 --> 01:30:00,540
One of those new ones,
recently built.

726
01:30:01,381 --> 01:30:05,613
COUPLE FAKES ACCIDENTS WITH OWN CHILD
EARNS 400000 YEN IN COMPENSATIONS

727
01:30:06,453 --> 01:30:11,415
SUSPECTED COUPLE INDICTED

728
01:30:11,526 --> 01:30:13,620
MOTHER BORN IN OSAKA

729
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:19,528
COUPLE DISCOVERED THROUGH
PHOTOGRAPHIC IDENTIFICATION

730
01:30:20,370 --> 01:30:24,432
From October to December a series of
fake accidents happened all over Japan...

731
01:30:24,475 --> 01:30:29,378
staged by a couple, who used their
own child to cash in on compensations.

732
01:30:29,514 --> 01:30:36,546
The police investigated 16 cases with
damages amounting to 747, 200 Yen.

733
01:30:36,622 --> 01:30:40,526
The culprits are a middle-aged
couple with a boy and a baby.

734
01:30:40,594 --> 01:30:45,429
The alleged father, Omura Takeo, 45 years
old, was born in Kochi prefecture.

735
01:30:45,466 --> 01:30:48,493
He is jobless and has a criminal
record with 3 offences.

736
01:30:48,603 --> 01:30:52,597
Since Dec. 20 he and his accomplices are
wanted by Gumma Prefecture Police.

737
01:30:53,442 --> 01:30:56,606
Despite his severe injuries the child
was taken away by the couple.

738
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:59,650
Thus the National Police Agency has
ordered a nationwide search.

739
01:31:42,466 --> 01:31:44,436
Are you Takeko Taniguchi?

740
01:31:47,473 --> 01:31:50,499
You should never have started
using your child.

741
01:31:57,652 --> 01:31:59,415
Father, run away!

742
01:32:35,396 --> 01:32:36,591
You had lots of accidents?

743
01:32:38,532 --> 01:32:41,435
Was it your father
who told you to do it?

744
01:32:41,604 --> 01:32:42,628
Then your mother?

745
01:32:44,473 --> 01:32:45,566
I like my mother.

746
01:32:46,676 --> 01:32:48,439
When did you come to Osaka?

747
01:32:48,477 --> 01:32:49,477
I don't remember.

748
01:32:49,646 --> 01:32:51,511
You went all over Japan?

749
01:32:52,417 --> 01:32:53,645
I was never on a train.

750
01:32:55,453 --> 01:32:57,649
No lies, now. Lies are bad.

751
01:32:59,591 --> 01:33:02,652
This is you here. You have
a hat on, though.

752
01:33:03,662 --> 01:33:05,597
That's a man from outer space.

753
01:33:05,665 --> 01:33:08,567
It must have hurt, getting
hit like that.

754
01:33:09,537 --> 01:33:11,471
I've never gotten hit.

755
01:33:11,572 --> 01:33:14,370
Then how did you get hurt there?

756
01:33:17,479 --> 01:33:18,606
It is just a little scratch.

757
01:33:20,582 --> 01:33:23,416
Why are you doing this?
No one asked you to.

758
01:33:23,519 --> 01:33:26,489
The police asked me to.

759
01:33:26,557 --> 01:33:30,584
If you're hurt, we'll try
to cure you.

760
01:33:30,627 --> 01:33:31,652
I'm not hurt.

761
01:33:32,497 --> 01:33:36,594
Maybe, but if it got worse we'd
have to cut the arm off.

762
01:33:36,668 --> 01:33:39,433
All right then, go ahead.

763
01:34:20,587 --> 01:34:22,612
Omura Takeo, born in 1922...

764
01:34:23,457 --> 01:34:27,690
Third child of six. Mother and father
were fishermen and farmers.

765
01:34:28,463 --> 01:34:29,943
Lost his father at the age of five...

766
01:34:30,499 --> 01:34:32,627
At age eleven, went to Osaka...

767
01:34:33,502 --> 01:34:34,662
Committed a robbery...

768
01:34:35,438 --> 01:34:36,564
and went to reformatory.

769
01:34:36,572 --> 01:34:38,598
Then joins the army.

770
01:34:39,410 --> 01:34:43,506
Wounded in China in 1942...

771
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:46,445
Ended the war in Okayama
Military Hospital.

772
01:34:46,618 --> 01:34:49,415
Sold clothes after the war.

773
01:34:49,554 --> 01:34:52,490
In 1953, he married Kazuyo Yamamoto.

774
01:34:52,524 --> 01:34:57,588
A son, Toshio, was born in 1956
The child is now 10 years old.

775
01:34:58,431 --> 01:35:01,401
Taniguchi Takeko, born in
1939 in Osaka.

776
01:35:01,469 --> 01:35:03,437
Adopted at the age of four...

777
01:35:03,605 --> 01:35:05,663
Step-mother twice remarried...

778
01:35:06,474 --> 01:35:08,534
Lived with four different families.

779
01:35:08,643 --> 01:35:12,513
1958: Married an 18 year old man.

780
01:35:12,516 --> 01:35:17,476
Had a child, then returned to Osaka
and worked in a cabaret.

781
01:35:17,621 --> 01:35:20,522
This is where she met Omura in 1959.

782
01:35:20,625 --> 01:35:22,649
Abandoned her family and began
living with him.

783
01:35:23,528 --> 01:35:26,691
In 1963, she had a child by Omura.
Child is now 3 years old.

784
01:35:56,467 --> 01:35:57,559
Do you like the sea?

785
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:08,580
And you rode on a plane too.

786
01:36:11,517 --> 01:36:12,610
It must have been nice.

787
01:36:36,547 --> 01:36:39,483
Yes, I went to Hokkaido.

788
01:37:10,587 --> 01:37:12,187
THE END
