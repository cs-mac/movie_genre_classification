1
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,322
Is this going too?

2
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:32,692
Yeah.

3
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,900
Don't you want

4
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,402
to say anything to me?

5
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:49,812
Like what?

6
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,776
I don't know...

7
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,847
Like "Stay".

8
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,625
Are you coming with us?

9
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:05,923
Yes.

10
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,895
So...

11
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,428
We'll talk.

12
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,254
Stay.

13
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:39,324
<i>MEDUZOT
(Jellyfish / Les Méduses)</i>

14
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,182
Batya, your buttons.

15
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,789
It's not buttoned right.
And your name tag is crooked.

16
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,195
Not here.

17
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,224
And why's your
hair so messy?

18
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,301
Didn't you
sleep last night?

19
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,202
- I slept.
- Then what's wrong?

20
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,472
Okay,
go wash your face.

21
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:05,773
Batya, either wear nail polish,
or don't, okay?

22
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,420
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the bride and groom are dancing!</i>

23
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,092
<i>Everyone get up and join
Michael and Keren on the dance floor!</i>

24
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:01,933
Congratulations.

25
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,944
Having a good time Sara?

26
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,246
Hi, Joy.

27
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,212
- What are you doing?
- Taking pictures.

28
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,822
Leave the old woman
and go to the dance floor.

29
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,889
Now.

30
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,259
Is there anybody
out there?

31
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,718
Now you're all better.

32
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,982
Doctor, can we
fly with this?

33
00:05:57,156 --> 00:06:00,182
We're supposed to go to the
Caribbean for our honeymoon.

34
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,260
Definitely not.

35
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,467
Why do you need the Caribbean?
You have each other.

36
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,244
Do you want to stay here?

37
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,821
You wanted us to stay,
didn't you?

38
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,427
This place smells like a sewer.
Do you smell it?

39
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:36,686
No.

40
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,065
It's a strong smell.

41
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,060
We can open
the window.

42
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,501
Is there even
a window here?

43
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,615
We can move to
another room.

44
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,646
Never mind.

45
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:07,190
We can move.
We're on our honeymoon!

46
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,591
Good morning...

47
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,627
- Did I wake you?
- No, no.

48
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,501
- Can I come in for a minute?
- Sure...

49
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,038
- Where's your boyfriend?
- Gone.

50
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,203
I see you're cleaning.

51
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,773
Do you want
something to drink?

52
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,970
No, no, I just came to tell you
that I'm raising the rent.

53
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,547
In the entire building.
Just by 30 dollars, that's all...

54
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,613
30 dollars?

55
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,184
The whole market went up,
it's not my doing.

56
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:11,387
You manage a wedding catering service,
don't you? There's money in that.

57
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,952
I'm a waitress,
not a manager.

58
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:17,256
but you will be one day,
you're a smart girl.

59
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,523
I have to run
before they tow my car.

60
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,189
The ceiling is leaking.

61
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,563
- What ceiling?
- Right here, next to the kitchen.

62
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,569
I'll send my plumber over.

63
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,765
When?

64
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,739
You should answer,
it might be important.

65
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,581
- Batya...
- Mom, can we talk later?

66
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,615
<i>Why later?
Did something happen?</i>

67
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:44,723
No.

68
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,920
<i>Did you get
my invitation?</i>

69
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,356
What invitation?

70
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,728
<i>To my fundraiser.</i>

71
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,957
Yeah... I got it.

72
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,434
<i>Do I look
okay in the picture?</i>

73
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,797
Yes.
Pretty.

74
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:03,735
<i>I just want them to buy tickets,
I'm working my ass off on this...</i>

75
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:04,535
Yes.

76
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,169
<i>It's tomorrow,
don't forget.</i>

77
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,314
<i>It's an invitation for two.
Amir should come too.</i>

78
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,972
He won't come.

79
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,781
<i>Why not?</i>

80
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,419
He...
works nights.

81
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,745
<i>That's too bad...</i>

82
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,224
<i>So I'll leave you a single invite.
There's a big demand for them.</i>

83
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,454
<i>I have to make more phone calls.
We'll talk?</i>

84
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,074
- Hi, Menachem.
- Hello.

85
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,114
<i>I won't make it
to Tel-Aviv today.</i>

86
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:23,013
<i>Yaroni is sick
and Ariel is at work...</i>

87
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,622
That's okay.

88
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,248
<i>Tell Mom I'll be over
on the weekend.</i>

89
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,155
I hope she
recognizes you.

90
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,317
<i>What?</i>

91
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,360
What?

92
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,088
<i>What's going on with her?</i>

93
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,501
I'm on my way to her,
I'm bringing her a Philippine woman.

94
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,927
<i>Did she ask for one?</i>

95
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,041
Mom doesn't ask for anything.
You know her.

96
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,210
Mom?

97
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,039
Mom, I want you to meet...

98
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,072
What was your name?

99
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,821
- Is it your woman?
- Yours.

100
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,014
She'll help you.

101
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,681
No... No...

102
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,128
Save your money.
For your home, for your children.

103
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,530
I don't have any
children, Mom.

104
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,256
Why not?

105
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,099
Why not?

106
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,836
What happened
to your face?

107
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,599
It's from a long
time ago, Mom.

108
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,601
Who did this to you?

109
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,268
The Syrians...

110
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,882
The Syrians...

111
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,592
- Your woman?
- Yes, Mom, yes.

112
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,442
What's your name?

113
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,225
What's your name?

114
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,561
Where is your mother?
Your father?

115
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:30,640
Did you run away?

116
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,777
She came out of the sea.
She doesn't speak.

117
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,139
- Please don't interrupt me.
- Sorry.

118
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,479
Let's see...

119
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,924
Hello, this is Sergeant Antebi,
Tel Aviv police.

120
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:50,028
We found a girl wandering on the beach.
She doesn't speak.

121
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,630
Can you send someone over
to get her?

122
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,991
- I don't know how old she is.
- She's five.

123
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:57,994
She's fi...

124
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,937
I see... Thanks.

125
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,270
It's a problem.
It's Friday.

126
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,008
Social services don't
work on weekends.

127
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,345
Can you keep
her for two days?

128
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:21,119
I work nights.
I can't take her to work with me.

129
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,754
I see.

130
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,299
Okay, we'll leave
her here for now.

131
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,469
You can go.

132
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:46,809
Liora...

133
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,617
No, I didn't forget.

134
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,822
Tell me something,

135
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,589
how do you
know she's five?

136
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,094
Why?

137
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,029
We end up throwing
it all away.

138
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,034
So ask each one
to bring something.

139
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,460
Are you coming to bed?

140
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,199
What a strange hotel.

141
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,395
Does it smell here too?

142
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,032
No.

143
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,507
But we are right on the coast,
yet we can't see the sea.

144
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,171
We can't see anything now.
It's dark.

145
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,873
Come to bed.

146
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,251
It's so noisy...

147
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,617
What?

148
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,253
The street,
don't you hear it?

149
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,826
I'm beat.

150
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,828
We're right on
the main road.

151
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:13,600
Tomorrow I'll ask for another room
on a higher floor, okay?

152
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,713
I'll never fall
asleep here.

153
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,979
Are you tired?

154
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,346
Let's take this off.

155
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,727
Okay, we won't.

156
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,600
do you want to sleep?

157
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,110
<i>In this day and
age of plenty,</i>

158
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,975
<i>it's hard to believe
that some people have nothing.</i>

159
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:39,517
<i>Every mother wants to give her child
the world, but not everyone can.</i>

160
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:49,024
<i>For some children,
this is a home and a bed.</i>

161
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:55,397
<i>And this is breakfast,
lunch and dinner.</i>

162
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,471
<i>On October 30th,
fundraising day,</i>

163
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,140
<i>we all open our hearts</i>

164
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,474
<i>and wallets.</i>

165
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,814
<i>Because everyone deserves
a roof over their heads.</i>

166
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,785
<i>To purchase a golden roof pin
or a key chain,</i>

167
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,653
<i>send a text
message to 0606.</i>

168
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:23,933
<i>Did I look okay on TV?</i>

169
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,232
<i>Batya?</i>

170
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,934
Mom?

171
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,507
- What's going on with you?
- I'm fine.

172
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:35,306
<i>No, you're not.
You can talk to me, I'm your mother.</i>

173
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,175
Really, I'm fine.

174
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,318
<i>I couldn't talk to my mother,
but you can.</i>

175
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,114
<i>if you want,
I could pay for therapy.</i>

176
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,256
<i>What's funny?
You don't believe in therapy?</i>

177
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,950
No, no.

178
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,493
<i>What is it, then?</i>

179
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,026
Where are the clothes I had
when I was little?

180
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,493
<i>Your clothes?</i>

181
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,794
<i>At your father's.
Why?</i>

182
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,495
At Dad's?

183
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,568
<i>Knowing him,
he probably threw them away.</i>

184
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,702
Batya?

185
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,878
We came here to relax,
and all we've had is troubles.

186
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:15,384
We're trying our best.
We already moved you to another room.

187
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,819
How about a room with an ocean view?
Do you have any suites?

188
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,459
We have one suite...

189
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:22,821
but it's occupied.

190
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,987
can't you do anything?

191
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,857
I'm sorry.

192
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,459
I just got married.

193
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,005
Congratulations.

194
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,232
Yeah, right...

195
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,411
do you happen to know
how you spell "eternally"?

196
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:51,749
What?

197
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:55,257
"Eternally in disgrace".
One or two L's?

198
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,222
Eternally...
Two, I think.

199
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,091
Thanks.

200
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,634
Maybe just one?

201
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,911
- What did she say?
- Who?

202
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,180
<i>The receptionist.</i>

203
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,422
She said it's the normal sound
of an air conditioner.

204
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,521
It's anything but normal.

205
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:34,227
Are you okay?

206
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,394
I'm fine.

207
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,068
Want an apple?

208
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,542
A rotten one?

209
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,520
What does
"eternally in disgrace" mean?

210
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,991
"Eternally in disgrace"?

211
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:10,194
It's something bad
that goes on and on and never stops.

212
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:11,798
Why?

213
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,111
Thanks.

214
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,256
Why did you bring her a Filipino?
She didn't want anyone.

215
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,885
- How do you know? You're never here.
- I called her twice a day.

216
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,498
I changed her diapers
twice a day!

217
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,898
I offered to move her to Haifa
but you insisted on...

218
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,128
What do you want now?!.

219
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,236
So let's move her to Haifa!

220
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,083
It's okay.

221
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,523
Tell me about yourself.

222
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,354
You still work
in flower arrangement, right?

223
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:14,698
I've been a waitress at weddings, Dad,
for two years already.

224
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,265
That's great.

225
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,492
Eldad told me
so much about you...

226
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,404
What did he say?

227
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,364
That...

228
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,443
You're his only child...

229
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,676
How happy he was
when you were born...

230
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,776
What a beautiful baby you were...

231
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,393
It's good to see you.
Really.

232
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,991
Where are my old clothes?

233
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,397
I'll get them.

234
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,081
Don't all those weddings
give you an urge?

235
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:06,909
An urge for what?

236
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,251
I've been dreaming about my wedding
since I was a kid.

237
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,185
Really?

238
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,685
Funny...

239
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,328
Just like your father.

240
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:28,504
Take what you need.
It's just getting moldy here.

241
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:35,977
What do you think of her?

242
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,507
- Who?
- Her.

243
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:40,710
Nice.

244
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,552
I saved her,

245
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,424
poor girl.

246
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:52,893
Her life was a nightmare.
She came to me all skin and bones.

247
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,827
I took care of her.

248
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,501
Now she wants to
get married.

249
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,837
She's bulimic, poor girl.

250
00:24:58,597 --> 00:24:59,564
Dad, who is this?

251
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:40,031
- Is the girl wet?
- No.

252
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,569
Your daughter
has your eyes.

253
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,139
She's not my daughter.

254
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,777
- Your sister?
- No.

255
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,647
Is 30 shekels okay?

256
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:04,788
- You didn't put the meter on?
- My meter's busted, sweetie.

257
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:27,217
The call time is almost up.
I wanted to tell you...

258
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,376
Your birthday is
coming up soon.

259
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,716
You'll be a big boy,
five years old.

260
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,751
And Mommy doesn't know
what to get you.

261
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,056
What would you like
the most?

262
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,696
I want you
to come home.

263
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,323
I...

264
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:53,874
Why so late?

265
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,138
- I'm sorry...
- Who's this?

266
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:00,182
- I found her in the sea...
- In the sea?

267
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,050
I had nowhere
to leave her...

268
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,451
Batya, you have
one last chance.

269
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,388
Another screw-up
and you're out of here.

270
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,392
In the sea...

271
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,790
Go get changed.

272
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,773
Stay here, okay?

273
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:54,636
Stop it!

274
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,069
- You, stop it!
- Leave me alone!

275
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,638
Three couples complained
about you! Three!

276
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,770
Your pictures come out...
lousy.

277
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,308
- It's not my fault.
- Whose then? My grandmother's?!.

278
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,781
It's easy to take a picture.
You aim, you click...

279
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,385
You're an idiot!

280
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,947
And you're fired!

281
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,698
What are you doing?

282
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,669
Don't move,
you hear me?!.

283
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,709
You hear me?!.

284
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,765
Excuse me, did a little girl
come out of here?

285
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:40,069
- A little girl?
- Wet, red hair.

286
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,007
- Big sad eyes?
- You saw her?

287
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,738
I took her picture.

288
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,880
It was my last shot.

289
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,047
- That's her dress, isn't it?
- Yes.

290
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:54,115
I yelled at her.
I shouldn't have done tha...

291
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,554
You're fired!

292
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,022
It makes you
feel good, huh?

293
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:00,824
Excuse me?

294
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:02,933
Firing people.

295
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:05,731
Get lost.

296
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,232
Make me.

297
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,276
Son of a bitch!

298
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,548
Excuse me,
where's the restroom?

299
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,982
- This way, Madam.
- thank you.

300
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,663
Come, let's look
for the girl.

301
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,740
Business cards. Forget it,
I don't need them anymore.

302
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,708
I don't think
I can get on a motorcycle.

303
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,317
It's a scooter.

304
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,721
No. Really, no.

305
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,850
- I'll drive slowly. Don't you trust me?
- No.

306
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,695
I don't trust anyone.

307
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,231
Fine, whatever.

308
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,282
Oh, these damn heels...

309
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,010
This damn hotel.

310
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,487
Eight flights of stairs
for cigarettes.

311
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:07,317
Eight?

312
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,387
Yes, I'm on
the top floor.

313
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,788
- In the suite?
- Yes.

314
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,124
- You guys are lucky.
- What do you mean, "you guys"?

315
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,826
You and your husband.

316
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,403
I'm alone here.
What about you?

317
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:22,766
I'm on my honeymoon.

318
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,738
- I got married the day before yesterday
- Congratulations.

319
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,003
Thanks.

320
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,710
- This is my floor.
- Bye.

321
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,716
"Eternally in disgrace"
is with two L's.

322
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:35,682
What?

323
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:38,913
It's spelled with two L's.
I asked my wife.

324
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:40,689
Thanks.

325
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,519
You can write
"forever" instead.

326
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:46,121
It's less final,
more optimistic.

327
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,793
I'll think about it.

328
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,200
Good luck.

329
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,473
With what you're writing.

330
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,051
Are you asleep?

331
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:13,885
Almost.

332
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,951
The noise from the road
doesn't bother you?

333
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:23,229
I got used to it.

334
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,368
Scary.

335
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,578
I met that woman again.

336
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:42,052
What woman?

337
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,553
The one who asked me
how to spell "eternally."

338
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:46,621
She's strange.

339
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,761
- Did you talk?
- A little.

340
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,097
She's an author.
She came here to write.

341
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,927
What's she writing?

342
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,163
Maybe she's a poet.

343
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:01,868
Is she pretty?

344
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:03,733
I don't know...

345
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,767
Interesting.
She's staying in a suite.

346
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,340
Is she married?

347
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,174
She's here alone.

348
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,611
Alone in a suite?

349
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,480
She's a writer. She's writing.
She needs space.

350
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,881
- Bullshit.
- Why bullshit?

351
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,524
Come on. She's probably
some bored millionaire.

352
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:21,988
Why do you say that?

353
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,617
You think Dostoyevsky
rented a suite to write?

354
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:25,820
Maybe not Dostoyevsky...

355
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:29,660
if you have something to write
you can do it anywhere.

356
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:32,762
How do you know?
Did you ever write anything?

357
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,534
At least I don't make
spelling mistakes.

358
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,009
In Russian,
I have no spelling mistakes.

359
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,514
I'm going out for a smoke.

360
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,730
We were
cut off yesterday...

361
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,459
Tell me what
you did today...

362
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,598
I don't want to.

363
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,029
Are you angry?

364
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,134
I don't know
where you are.

365
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,542
I'm in Israel.
Did Mirna tell you about Israel?

366
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,213
There's no such place.

367
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,485
Yes, there is,
it's far away...

368
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,712
where the sea ends...

369
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,454
It's okay.

370
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,444
Are you okay?

371
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,353
I'm sorry.

372
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:15,929
She disappeared.

373
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,195
Disappeared?

374
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:23,364
I looked for her all night.
I took her to work and...

375
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,374
I left her alone for a minute.
I yelled at her.

376
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,034
Sit down, relax.

377
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,577
I lost her,
I was responsible for her.

378
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,407
You're not her mother,
you just found her, right?

379
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,512
So, that's that.

380
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,278
What do you mean?
What do we do now?

381
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:39,282
Nothing.

382
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,722
Nothing?

383
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,917
Unless someone comes looking for her.
Her mother, her father.

384
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,494
No one's looking for her.

385
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:47,696
I'm looking for her.

386
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,594
You're not her mother.

387
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,126
So what?
The girl disappeared!

388
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,331
You know how many
people disappear?

389
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,339
Missing people are
at the bottom of the list.

390
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,843
They don't even
get a folder.

391
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,117
Eliyahu Zilka.

392
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:18,618
No family.

393
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,165
83 years old.

394
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,596
Hana Kelman.

395
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:33,409
Alzheimer's.

396
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,377
Mois...

397
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,077
What's this?

398
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,851
Moizo...

399
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,511
Crozskazi...

400
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,960
Can't even say his name,
so how are they gonna find him...

401
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,041
Eliyahu Zilka.

402
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,075
No family.
Lost at sea.

403
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,752
if you had her picture,
maybe I could do something.

404
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:26,920
Like what?

405
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,956
Put out an
all-points bulletin.

406
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,995
Maybe someone
would call.

407
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:35,803
- Take it.
- No, thanks.

408
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,770
- Go ahead, take it.
- No, thanks.

409
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,505
Take it.

410
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:03,590
<i>"My lord, as I was sewing
in my closet, Lord Hamlet,</i>

411
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,565
<i>with his doublet
all unbraced..."</i>

412
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:12,704
Ward F.
End of the corridor.

413
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,286
Where's Galia?

414
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,049
- You don't speak Hebrew?
- A little.

415
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:34,121
Great. She can't even
find a decent care giver.

416
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:38,263
They said I could leave.
I want to go.

417
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,002
I want to go home.

418
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:06,487
I suggest you take a walk on the beach,
it'll do you good.

419
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:07,528
Good?

420
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:11,498
What's on the beach
besides dog shit and jellyfish?

421
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,330
You people eat them, don't you?

422
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,089
Speak to me in
Hebrew or German.

423
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,693
You speak German?

424
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,062
You okay?

425
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,699
Go buy me some water.

426
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,648
The kiosk.
Money? You need money?

427
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,458
The picture...

428
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:12,562
- What?
- Where is it?

429
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:20,096
What in God's name
are you doing?

430
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:41,724
<i>Hi, we are out.
Please leave a message. Thanks.</i>

431
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,961
<i>Hi Batya, it's me.</i>

432
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:47,563
<i>I just wanted to remind you
about my fundraiser.</i>

433
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,928
<i>I'll pick you up on the corner
at five. So be ready.</i>

434
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,466
<i>And look pretty.</i>

435
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:18,855
Come in.

436
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,525
I'll get the little
girl's picture.

437
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,802
- Do you remember that moment?
- No.

438
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,739
I've cleaned
so many tables.

439
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,539
They're all white
with the same food,

440
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:40,216
the same leftovers.

441
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:44,050
Only the bride
and groom change.

442
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:47,649
- Even they don't change.
- What?

443
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:53,530
Now where did I put it?
This place is a mess.

444
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:57,156
- What's this?
- It's a film.

445
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:58,892
- What film?
- Super eight.

446
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,997
Super what?
Is it Sci-Fi?

447
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,803
Kind of...

448
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:06,406
From my childhood,
stuff my dad filmed.

449
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:10,203
- Can I see it?
- It's boring.

450
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,947
Like all those films.

451
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,517
What films?

452
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,845
You must have some too.
Standing next to a giraffe

453
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,853
when you were a kid.

454
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,653
I don't. I don't have
any pictures either.

455
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,059
Really?

456
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:28,664
Can I see it?

457
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,295
Please...

458
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,586
There's no plot
development.

459
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:56,452
I don't like developments.

460
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:12,600
Got any more
of these films?

461
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,205
I think I have something
from an amusement park.

462
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,544
I can look...

463
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,172
You're fired.

464
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:51,705
I don't need you.
I'm fine on my own.

465
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,215
I'm letting you go.
Now.

466
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,985
You can go.

467
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,289
You're fired!
Fired!

468
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,541
It's okay?

469
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,248
Nothing.

470
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,386
Forget it.

471
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:38,694
How are you feeling?

472
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,093
You can see for yourself.

473
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:42,263
Are you in pain?

474
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,593
I got used to it.

475
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,929
How's the play?

476
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:49,967
Final rehearsals,
there's a lot of pressure.

477
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:52,336
Who's the director?

478
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,306
Mahmoud Yasif.

479
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,641
An Arab directing
Shakespeare?

480
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:02,751
do you know him?

481
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,252
Shakespeare?
Who doesn't...

482
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:07,946
No. Mahmoud. have you ever heard
of him? Or seen his work?

483
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,817
- Don't get all upset now.
- Then don't upset me.

484
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,928
Okay, I'll keep quiet.

485
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:22,168
How is she?

486
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:24,672
What can I tell you?

487
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:28,005
That I wish it was you
who picked me up from the hospital?

488
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:29,904
I'm sorry, Mom,
I had a rehearsal.

489
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,570
Never mind.

490
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:35,014
Is she treating you well?

491
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,850
I don't know
where you found her.

492
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,216
She doesn't speak
a word of Hebrew,

493
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,449
walks too slow...

494
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:43,650
It's only till
you're better.

495
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:47,253
Tova had a wonderful
Philippine woman, experienced,

496
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:50,829
- maybe you can find out...
- I'm swamped, Mom. I can hardly...

497
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:54,498
Yeah, yeah. Jumping around
on stage is more important.

498
00:47:57,174 --> 00:48:00,473
If I get you a new one,
will you be happy?

499
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:05,774
Instead of flying to the Caribbean,
we ended up here because of her leg.

500
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,110
They gave us a room
on the ground floor.

501
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,618
And my wife couldn't sleep
because of the sewage.

502
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:14,746
We moved to another room.
Now I can't sleep because of the traffic

503
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,389
I can give you my suite.

504
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:21,029
You don't have to,
but it's nice of you to offer.

505
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,428
It means nothing to me.
Really.

506
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,462
but you write...

507
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,229
I can write anywhere.

508
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:30,897
So could Dostoyevsky.

509
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,267
Dostoyevsky?

510
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,877
Never mind.

511
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:05,671
<i>"A ship inside a bottle</i>

519
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,343
<i>It has no sails,</i>

525
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:13,859
Head injury.

526
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,365
Concussion?

527
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:16,972
Looks like it.

528
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,400
What's your name?

529
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,069
Where's your mother?
Your father?

530
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:40,263
<i>No, no sir, thank you.</i>

531
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:44,258
<i>Later, honey,
he'll be back, I promise.</i>

532
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,494
<i>Go play in the sand.</i>

533
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:50,765
<i>- Why didn't you buy her ice cream?
- Do it yourself.</i>

534
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,508
<i>Are you still mad?</i>

535
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:55,304
<i>- What do you think?
- That we came here to have fun.</i>

536
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:57,947
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

537
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,778
The fact she opened her eyes
doesn't mean a thing.

538
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,624
The nurse said
it's a reflex.

539
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,724
I should have kept in touch
with her.

540
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,521
I'm a lousy father.

541
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,460
I have to throw up.

542
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,128
Go throw up.

543
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:26,139
I can't in a hospital.
It's disgusting.

544
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,142
Can I have a minute
alone with my daughter?

545
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:32,943
Wait...

546
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:38,046
No, I'm really sorry.
Forgive me...

547
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:40,246
Stop.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

548
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,528
<i>do you think
I don't know?</i>

549
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:46,923
<i>Know what?</i>

550
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,394
<i>Not in front of the child.</i>

551
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,493
<i>Want to go
into the water, sweetie?</i>

552
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:03,176
<i>Play nice.
Daddy's coming right back.</i>

553
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,488
<i>Don't play dumb.</i>

554
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:30,764
<i>How old is your new floozy?
20? 18?</i>

555
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:33,332
<i>Batya's age?</i>

556
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:37,337
<i>Nili!</i>

557
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,319
Too bad I don't have a camera.
I'd take a picture with you.

558
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:44,620
Too bad.

559
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:47,655
Excuse me,
do you have any aspirin?

560
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,689
I don't work here.

561
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:53,860
Okay, I won't
bother you anymore.

562
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:55,998
Goodbye.

563
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,069
Go on, knock.

564
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:42,668
My wife, Keren.
This is...

565
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:44,271
I forgot...

566
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,644
I never told you.

567
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:47,908
Nice to meet you.

568
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:49,348
Are we too early?

569
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,453
No, I'm all packed.
Come in.

570
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,680
I'll go get the suitcase
from our room.

571
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:58,924
The towels are clean.

572
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,798
Why did you agree
to switch rooms with us?

573
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:04,490
I thought
it's what you wanted.

574
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:08,036
- Did Michael ask you to?
- No.

575
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:09,933
I felt it.

576
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,203
You're very generous.

577
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,399
No.

578
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:18,811
There are just certain men
I can't resist.

579
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:21,509
We got married
the day before yesterday.

580
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:22,978
Congratulations.

581
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,616
I heard it was
a lovely wedding.

582
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:34,221
I want you to
stay away from him.

583
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:43,668
You can see the sea
from the balcony.

584
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,209
I shut the blinds.

585
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:50,971
I hate light.

586
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:36,950
Thanks.

587
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:19,958
What now?

588
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,962
Galia?
Where?

589
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,706
Look at her.
Everything hanging out...

590
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:31,573
Give me my glasses.

591
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,239
To see.

592
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:45,319
It's tonight.

593
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,457
What?

594
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:53,699
She didn't invite me.
I don't go anywhere uninvited.

595
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,861
At 8, is okay?

596
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,240
Why didn't you tell me
she's so pretty?

597
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,544
- Who?
- The poet.

598
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,647
What difference does it make?
Look at the beautiful view.

599
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:15,549
Come on,
I'll carry you over.

600
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:18,387
Don't you want
to see the sea finally?

601
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:20,587
- What did you give her?
- What?

602
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,392
What did you give her
for the room?

603
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,330
What do you mean?

604
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:28,697
Did you sleep with her?

605
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,538
You're crazy.

606
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:35,940
I'm a woman.
Did you sleep with her?

607
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:40,783
Five flights up for nothing.
It's gonna be shit here too.

608
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:53,927
Remember
our first date?

609
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:58,090
We went to the movies.

610
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:03,934
You wore a white dress.
With thin straps.

611
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:07,335
We had seats
right in the center.

612
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:10,373
But someone was
blocking your view.

613
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,538
So I changed
seats with you.

614
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:14,816
But I couldn't
see either.

615
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:17,581
So we moved
to side seats.

616
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:20,649
But we couldn't
see from there.

617
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,984
Finally, we sat
in the second row.

618
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,589
And your neck hurt.

619
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,893
do you remember?

620
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:35,032
What was the movie about?

621
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,373
Did you sleep with her?

622
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:45,774
I don't remember either.

623
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:51,847
Let's go look at the sea
and talk.

624
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:54,887
Take me out to the balcony.

625
00:59:56,826 --> 01:00:00,091
"Hamlet, Hamlet, Hamlet...

626
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,333
Oh, that this too solid flesh

627
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:15,568
would melt,

628
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:17,372
thaw and resolve itself
into a dew..."

629
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:20,045
I found you a boat.

630
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:21,581
<i>A big boat?</i>

631
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:25,011
A huge boat,

632
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:27,614
with a tall mast

633
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,690
and beautiful sails...

634
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:32,520
<i>When will I get to see it?</i>

635
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:34,253
Soon, it will arrive

636
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,660
on your birthday.

637
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:39,563
<i>Mirna!
Mama bought me a boat!</i>

638
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:42,430
<i>Mama bought me a boat!</i>

639
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:53,844
"...For I must hold my tongue!

640
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:55,908
Tongue, Tongue,

641
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:58,379
Tongue, Tongue."

642
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:49,633
<i>I can't make it...</i>

643
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,330
<i>Taxi...
keep the receipt.</i>

644
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:28,903
Did I wake you?

645
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:32,066
- Can I sleep here tonight?
- Sure.

646
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:36,871
- What happened?
- I ran away from a hospital.

647
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:38,708
Why were
you in a hospital?

648
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:42,541
I'll tell you tomorrow.
Can I sleep on the sofa?

649
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:44,379
I don't have a sofa.

650
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,095
They promised
he'd come back.

651
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:02,265
Who?

652
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:04,801
The ice cream man.

653
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,467
My mother promised
he'd come back.

654
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,606
Did they promise you anything
when you were a child?

655
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:18,446
My parents are Holocaust survivors.
I never asked anything from them.

656
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:20,589
You're second generation?

657
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:23,152
We're all second generation...

658
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:24,850
of something.

659
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:29,124
Don't worry,
he's always around.

660
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:30,626
Who?

661
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,161
The ice cream man.

662
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:38,163
I have pictures of him.
Dozens.

663
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,375
Can I see them?

664
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,004
Tomorrow.

665
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,411
Tomorrow...

666
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,320
I was glad to see you.

667
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:01,221
Yes.
I really liked it.

668
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,126
He's talented,
that director.

669
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:07,360
And me?

670
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:11,705
You're my daughter.
I'm not objective.

671
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:18,912
- Where is the Philippine woman?
- Joy?

672
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:22,642
She's out.
She's leaving today.

673
01:05:25,454 --> 01:05:28,787
But did you
like my acting?

674
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:31,619
Well,

675
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:35,252
half the time
you're lying on the floor dead.

676
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:39,628
And when you were acting, you and that
Hamlet just kept fondling each other.

677
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:42,366
We weren't fondling each other.
It's physical theater.

678
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:46,731
Physical, yes, but why do you have
to touch each other all the time?

679
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:51,712
- You don't like touching at all.
- What?

680
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:55,312
- Nothing, never mind.
- No. What did you say?

681
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:58,282
if you have something to say,
say it.

682
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:03,657
Even on stage no one understands
a word you mumble.

683
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:08,696
I'll never
come here again.

684
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:09,759
Ever.

685
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:45,495
Get me a glass of water.

686
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:50,368
Didn't you hear me?

687
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:03,676
What's with you?

688
01:07:57,873 --> 01:08:01,400
<i>"I thought it
would be simpler to die.</i>

689
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:03,640
<i>I hate hotels.</i>

690
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:07,774
<i>Maybe that's why
I chose to die in one.</i>

691
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:11,084
<i>What am I waiting for?</i>

692
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:15,417
<i>It's all ready,
the pills, my mood.</i>

693
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:18,125
<i>So why doesn't it happen?</i>

694
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:22,259
<i>Is it because I'm not happy
with the suicide note?</i>

695
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:26,763
<i>I can't find words
to express my emotions.</i>

696
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:29,163
<i>And I won't do it
until I find them.</i>

697
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:35,536
<i>Or maybe it's because
I met someone who'll save me.</i>

698
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:58,248
<i>A ship inside a bottle
cannot sink,</i>

699
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,388
<i>or collect dust.</i>

700
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:05,056
<i>It's nice to look at</i>

701
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,927
<i>and floats on glass.</i>

702
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:12,972
<i>No one is small
enough to board it.</i>

703
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,378
<i>It doesn't know
where it's heading.</i>

704
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:21,381
<i>The wind outside
won't blow its sails.</i>

705
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:27,983
<i>It has no sails,</i>

706
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:30,190
<i>only a slip, a dress.</i>

707
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:32,794
<i>And beneath them,
jellyfish.</i>

708
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:52,139
<i>Her mouth is dry
though she's surrounded by water.</i>

709
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:55,442
<i>She drinks it
through the openings in her eyes</i>

710
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:57,851
<i>which never close.</i>

711
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:01,488
<i>When she dies,
it won't be noticeable.</i>

712
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:03,852
<i>She won't crash on rocks.</i>

713
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:06,017
<i>She will remain tall...</i>

714
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:07,927
<i>and proud. "</i>

715
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,621
It's beautiful. Isn't it?

716
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:14,229
<i>if you didn't kiss her
on your way out,</i>

717
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:16,895
<i>my love,</i>

718
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,471
<i>if you can,</i>

719
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:22,533
<i>kiss me
when you return.</i>
