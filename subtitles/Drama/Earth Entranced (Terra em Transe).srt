1
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:37,934
EARTH ENTRANCED

2
00:02:55,675 --> 00:03:01,841
Eldorado Country in the Atlantic

3
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:07,547
Alecrim Province, Governor
Vieira's Palace

4
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:35,742
Calm down!

5
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,406
Any news?

6
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,777
The President demands your
resignation in five hours.

7
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,119
Anything else?

8
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,950
Federal troops
are going to Alecrim.

9
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,194
I don't want any bloodshed.

10
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,302
Now we have to go to the end.

11
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,839
The blood of the people is sacred!

12
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,908
Blood isn't important.

13
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,145
It'll be the beginning
of our history.

14
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,510
If we fail,
Diaz will rise to power.

15
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,344
It's useless,
we'll be crushed.

16
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,111
You cannot betray! We...

17
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,413
Our adventure is over.

18
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,215
Adventure?
You call our work adventure?

19
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,550
Adventure...
adventure.

20
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,055
You call it "adventure"?

21
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,125
Adventure!

22
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,386
Sara!

23
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,124
Write down what I say.

24
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,562
Obey my orders!

25
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,566
Disperse any resistance!

26
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:44,437
The contradiction
that rules our lives

27
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,510
has brought us to this
political stalemate,

28
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:52,844
so familiar to those
who are engaged

29
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,247
in great decisions.

30
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,218
What is this document for?

31
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,621
It's about economic
and social development.

32
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,397
Thus, our fate is sealed,

33
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,124
at the head of great
national decisions...

34
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,702
Speeches, principles,
promises...

35
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,373
We hand our government over
to the Supreme Federal Power.

36
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,371
We're sure
that any resistance

37
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,272
would provoke a civil
war among innocents.

38
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,045
Who are the innocents?

39
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,751
I devote my path to God.

40
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,352
And I hope God,
once again,

41
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,524
blesses us with divine grace,

42
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:38,489
filling our hearts
with love and union.

43
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,260
Do you see, Sara?
Who was our leader?

44
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,665
Our great leader?!

45
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,374
I used to say he was weak.

46
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,940
The time had not arrived.

47
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,667
The struggle would prove much!

48
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,244
People would die.
Blood, Paulo!

49
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,881
History isn't changed by tears.

50
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,518
If they take up arms,
if they do!

51
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,187
Even people like you,

52
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,653
people like us, bourgeois,
weak...

53
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,122
But I accept the risk.

54
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,956
Stop, Paulo, your madness...

55
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,825
My madness is my conscience,

56
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,091
now, in the hour of truth!

57
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,860
Time for decision!
Even in the face of death!

58
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,538
We don't need any heroes.

59
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,833
We might resist,
I need to sing.

60
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,408
I need to sing!

61
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,611
No more condecorations...

62
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,447
This joyful pomp of glories...

63
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,351
This golden hope on the Plateau.

64
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,527
No more this regal parade...

65
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,287
With war and Christ,
side by side!

66
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,160
No more the naiveté
of faith.

67
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,734
The impotence of faith...

68
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,287
""I was not able to ratify
the treaty between

69
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,293
the bloody cosmos and the pure soul.
A gladiator defunct, but intact

70
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,954
(so much violence, yet so much tenderness)
Mario Faustino

71
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,665
I' m dying now,
at this time.

72
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,234
My blood and tears
are shedding.

73
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,133
Oh, Sara!
They' ll say l' m crazy,

74
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,899
a romantic,
an anarchist, as ever...

75
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,237
I don't know, oh Sara...

76
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:35,340
Where I was 2,3,4 years ago?

77
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,807
Sailing with Dom Porfírio Diaz.

78
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:45,416
The god of my youth,
Dom Porfírio Diaz.

79
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:27,183
What I cannot explain
to my enemies

80
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,618
are my reasons for abandoning
the pleasures of solitude,

81
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,520
for the priesthood
of public life.

82
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:41,862
But neither could
Christ explain,

83
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:45,969
but by offering
His own life.

84
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:51,968
And so,
I'd reply to my enemies

85
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,612
that Christ gave
His life for the people

86
00:11:55,848 --> 00:12:01,047
when the exploiters wanted
Him to join

87
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,154
exploitation itself.

88
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,326
He died, but didn't betray!

89
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:17,935
Nor will l, by proclaiming
the greatness of man,

90
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:24,302
of Nature, of God!

91
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:54,572
There he was, dancing
with Silvia, what a happy day!

92
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,901
He was overwhelmingly
elected Senator.

93
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,773
Such a happy day!
He was alone

94
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,710
with Silvia and l, at home.

95
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,249
I was always following him,
almost lost,

96
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,253
in those useless,
empty days in Eldorado.

97
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,551
A hell called Eldorado!

98
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:21,560
Frustrating,
stealing my youth.

99
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,362
I've been following
Diaz for years.

100
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,630
And that night
he came to me

101
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:32,469
so loving and tender...

102
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:40,448
Our poet will be
elected deputy soon.

103
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:45,688
To Silvia,
who will be Mrs. Paulo Martins.

104
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,298
Aren't you happy?

105
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,332
It's not that.

106
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:04,438
You know about my friendship
and admiration.

107
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,676
But, starting with your help,

108
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,644
when I could do it on my own...

109
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,614
Don't you want to be
Dom Diaz's protégé?

110
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,879
Pride?

111
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:20,683
I don't know, but,
it's my poetry...

112
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:23,918
I myself, a new poetry...

113
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,496
If I could write about
serious things,

114
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,564
if I could talk about...

115
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,134
political ideas?

116
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,707
We're radical and extremist
when young...

117
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,110
I've been thinking...

118
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,016
We don't have to meet again.

119
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:49,551
You and your friends...
You and Alvaro!

120
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,051
It was my decision.

121
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:00,523
What can I do about Silvia?

122
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,360
I don't know, I don't care.

123
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,934
At least allow me this.

124
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,634
Let me choose my own path.

125
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,569
I've never been wrong, Silvia.
Never!

126
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:21,515
Some day, one fine day...

127
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:33,265
Good night. Excuse me.

128
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:30,354
I see fields of agony,
I sail seas of denial...

129
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:34,650
On my sword,
I bring remnants of passion,

130
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:39,159
born in those wars,
some more, some less,

131
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:45,667
cloistered witnesses of
the blood that sustains us.

132
00:16:54,213 --> 00:17:01,745
Death growing, flowing
and devouring.

133
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,230
We live with death.

134
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,959
Inside us,
death becomes the failure of

135
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,367
our daily employment,

136
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:27,944
as we advance, we retreat.

137
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:05,206
"AURORA LlVRE" - AN lNDEPENDENT,
NEWS-PACKED NEWSPAPER

138
00:18:59,104 --> 00:18:59,832
Look!

139
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:00,868
I see.

140
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,336
Children without schools,
overcrowded hospitals.

141
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,940
Look at this one.

142
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,940
A campaign must be undertaken.

143
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,373
Oh, my God, look!

144
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,514
The donations aren't enough.

145
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,307
Something must be done.

146
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,349
We need a political leader,
that's it.

147
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:49,553
""For the poor all that is offered
are scraps of fortune.

148
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:53,280
Because no one will
take a stand to defend his kind.

149
00:19:53,525 --> 00:20:00,658
The orphan must have a home,
school, church and rights"".

150
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,025
Martín Fierro.

151
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,305
Someone like you could
never work for Diaz...

152
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,509
I owe him a lot,

153
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,677
you know...

154
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,777
Reading your article,
I never thought

155
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,777
you could be so funny.

156
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,382
Funny, me? I am tragic!

157
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,814
Sara also came to light Alecrim.

158
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:57,817
Really?

159
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,489
She's an efficient teacher.

160
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,659
You're lucky to be with her.

161
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,622
I really liked your last book.

162
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:07,320
Youngster things...
Politics.

163
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,660
I'd like to get involved
to politics.

164
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,199
Really.

165
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,770
It's a tough career.

166
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,373
I came from the bottom,

167
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,416
with my own hands.

168
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,756
Sara knows my struggle.

169
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,253
I started as a simple
town councillor.

170
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:39,794
I had to confront
cynicism, corruption.

171
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,527
Always the most noble causes,

172
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,931
which are the hardest.

173
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,540
Mr. Vieira,
I think you're an excellent candidate.

174
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:51,743
Fine!

175
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,706
I offer you my humble services.

176
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,503
He's formidable.

177
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:57,507
To Vieira.

178
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:07,349
The country needs poets.
The good ones,

179
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:10,561
the revolutionaries,
like the old romantics...

180
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,856
Voices that stirred the crowds.

181
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:18,126
The streets belong to the people,
like the sky belongs to the condors.

182
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:25,772
We'll hold big rallies
throughout Alecrim.

183
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,740
Magnificent!

184
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:41,559
Better days to the poor
and new life for all my people!

185
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,522
So,...

186
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,596
It'll be like this...

187
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,356
Yes...

188
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,502
Viva...

189
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:54,570
My dear, speak, don't be afraid.

190
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,039
How lovely they are,
Your Grace. Write it down.

191
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,269
Take note of everything!

192
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,677
Take note.
All for you, my dear...

193
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,475
Don't worry.

194
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,482
It's going to be all right.

195
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,188
Don't worry, go!

196
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:16,827
Vieira, Vieira, Vieira...

197
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:32,374
Quite! Quite!

198
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,039
Mr. Governor...

199
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,577
Say, son...

200
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,874
In the name of these people,

201
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:42,177
I'd like to ask your attention...

202
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:47,925
Water here, to wet our lands

203
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,790
Now, if you would, you could...

204
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,261
you can, but...

205
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,560
My son, we're going
to stop these abuses.

206
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:01,568
Write down, Marinho.
He's writing down, you see?

207
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,332
Write down.
Isn't it, Your Grace?

208
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,506
I'd like to say one more thing.

209
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,710
Say it... Say.

210
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,686
How is it...?

211
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,079
Attention!

212
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,757
My main objective is
to do peaceful work,

213
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,449
through free elections,
we'll lead to power

214
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,357
the legitimate representatives
of the people!

215
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:02,931
These representatives are

216
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:08,629
those who will fight
for the very needs of the people!

217
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,638
Food, school!

218
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:31,662
Vieira, Vieira, Vieira...

219
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,722
And we won!

220
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:40,322
What I saw in that campaign...

221
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:45,332
A tragedy,
bigger than our strength.

222
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,639
There,
on that calm veranda

223
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:52,240
where we've planned
our struggle joyously,

224
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,674
and then, at your side,

225
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,940
I thought about possible problems

226
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:03,985
and asked myself, "How could
an elected Governor answer

227
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,918
to the candidate's promises?"

228
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:10,958
Mainly,
I asked myself and the others,

229
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,996
"How could we react to that?"

230
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:51,518
'Cause our families arrived
in these lands,

231
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,698
over 20 years ago.

232
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:58,164
And we worked the land,

233
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:04,831
we planted them and our wives
gave birth in these lands.

234
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,807
Now we can't leave

235
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:15,884
just because some "men"
appeared from nowhere

236
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:21,684
showing papers and saying
they're the owners.

237
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,790
That's what
I wanted to tell you, Sir.

238
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:32,401
We trust you, but...

239
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,875
if Justice says we have
to leave the land,

240
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:45,742
we'll die, but we won't!

241
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:50,387
Be quiet, Felicio,
show some respect for the Governor.

242
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:54,786
Mr. Paulo, Mr. Paulo...

243
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,529
We must shout!

244
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,291
How?

245
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,527
With whatever we have,
bones, everything!

246
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,638
Shut up!
You know nothing!

247
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,842
Mr. Paulo,
you used to be my friend,

248
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,636
-you used to promise...
-I never did!

249
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,471
I'm not a liar!

250
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,205
You wretch!
Weak chatterbox! Coward!

251
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,578
Mr. Paulo, don't say that,
Mr. Paulo...

252
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,051
Don't say that,
Mr. Paulo, don't.

253
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,020
Mr.Paulo, don't say that...

254
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,920
Do you see?
You're worth nothing!

255
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,425
Mr. Paulo, you were my friend!

256
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:50,906
I went there.

257
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:54,550
I beat a poor peasant because
he threatened me...

258
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:58,654
He could have cut my head
off with a hoe,

259
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,883
but he was so cowardly
and servile!

260
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,428
And I wanted to show
he was a coward and servile.

261
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:13,902
Weakness!

262
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,900
Weak people!

263
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:27,341
Always feeble and terrified!

264
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,154
blessed is the fruit
of your womb, Jesus.

265
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,552
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

266
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,693
now and at the hour
of our death, Amen.

267
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,829
Hail Mary, full of grace,
The Lord is with thee,

268
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,362
blessed art thou amongst women,
and blessed is the fruit

269
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,624
of thy womb, Jesus.

270
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,529
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

271
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,135
now and at the hour
of our death, Amen.

272
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,306
Hail Mary,
full of grace The Lord is with thee,

273
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,667
blessed are thou amongst women
and blessed is the fruit

274
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,241
of thy womb, Jesus.

275
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:56,038
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

276
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:12,952
I used to tell him not
to get involved,

277
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:16,166
I think it was a disgrace.

278
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:19,564
We were walking that night,

279
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:24,366
he walked forward
and turned another way,

280
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,601
and as he opened the gate,

281
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:31,508
I heard a shot, a scream,
a light!

282
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,483
My husband...

283
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,990
It was Vieira,
he is the murderer.

284
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:43,990
He promised
and didn't keep his word.

285
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,696
This bastard
has betrayed our people.

286
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,058
The murderer works
for the Government.

287
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,790
He works for the Government.

288
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:54,971
Vieira is guilty for everything.
Murderer!

289
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,572
He is the murderer.

290
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:18,852
The people are in the streets.
I await orders.

291
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:26,768
Don't disperse. Everybody
has the right to protest.

292
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,738
I advise you to arrest
Colonel Moreira.

293
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,677
Is there any evidence against him?

294
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,902
The widow's testimony.

295
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:39,674
And, it's not the first time,
we've known it.

296
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:42,283
It has to be done!

297
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,715
We have to choose between electorate

298
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,151
and commitments.

299
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,557
I can't arrest him.

300
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,230
I must warn you,
it' ll have negative repercussions

301
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,402
for you in the
Federal Government.

302
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,614
Where is Paulo?

303
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:24,717
Break off!
Let the boat go!

304
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,430
But first I have to fire
those aides you suggested me...

305
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,599
Professionals of disorder...

306
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:34,271
A man has been killed.
The family, everybody, wants justice!

307
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,941
Politics requires ability.
I am the Governor!

308
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,268
The elected one!

309
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,102
Moreira and the other
farmers financed a great part

310
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,778
of my campaign.

311
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:48,179
And l? And Sara?
And the students?

312
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:52,015
What about the support
of the people?

313
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,417
They knew about
the commitments...

314
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,960
But I have my own commitments,
to myself.

315
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,264
I can't accept such a huge lie.

316
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:12,971
I' m not your government's
police to use

317
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:18,877
force to solve
the conflicts you should confront!

318
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:28,324
The streets belong to the people
Iike the sky belongs to the condors.

319
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:35,294
The brave poet of the slaves
used to say.

320
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:39,094
If we arrange it all,
I might get more money for schools.

321
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:45,970
Funds? Money to be stolen
by your fiends. Funds.

322
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:51,574
Charity only
postpones or worsens poverty.

323
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,185
It's very easy to be reasonable
when you are on top.

324
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:58,320
A leader must take
a moral stand!

325
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,786
Arrest Moreira!

326
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:10,696
Maybe you' re right,
but that's impossible.

327
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:15,031
So, tell me your plan?
How is it?

328
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,605
Waiting would help...

329
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,572
And now? What to do?

330
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,251
Police oppression.

331
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,191
So, I quit!

332
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:43,764
One day,
when it'll be impossible

333
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,834
you'll be devoured by the hungry,

334
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,369
then we'll see that
the lack of courage,

335
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,575
the indecision...

336
00:36:54,612 --> 00:37:00,608
And who are you, Vieira?
Tell me, a leader?

337
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:05,254
If you don't have the abilities,
you should never have gone to the rallies.

338
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,282
Never!

339
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:15,159
Disperse the riot! Do it!

340
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,700
When the woman
was crying in front of me,

341
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:21,234
you know who's the killer?

342
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:24,999
It's your fault, Mr. Paulo,
you're the one to blame!

343
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,235
We have to protest in the streets.

344
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:31,471
Who did it must pay!

345
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:35,152
And it was Governor Vieira.

346
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,212
Something must be done.

347
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,822
We have to fight, he has to die.

348
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,151
Someone must pay for it.

349
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:02,970
But I refuse the certainty,
the logic, the balance...

350
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:06,115
I prefer Porfirio Diaz insanity...

351
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,752
So easy, like this.

352
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:16,450
Easy? Put an end to it all?

353
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:21,463
Sacrifice deepest ambitions.

354
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,431
What do you know about ambition?

355
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:28,332
I wanted to marry, have children,
like any other woman.

356
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,699
But I was thrown into the
heart of my time.

357
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,273
I was raised in
the streets my first banner.

358
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:38,210
And they shot us.
Friends died and they arrested me.

359
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:42,385
And sent me to a filthy jail,
with rats,

360
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,111
and tortured me with
electric shocks.

361
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:51,852
They raped me, and,
set me free with the scars.

362
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,223
And I continued the struggle,

363
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,901
raising banners, never for pride.

364
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:01,070
It was a greater thing,
in the name of logic

365
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,330
of feelings!

366
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,876
And if it's an ordinary
woman's ambition,

367
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,910
what's the other
ambition but happiness?

368
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:14,174
Solidary and happy people.

369
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,726
The hunger of the absolute...

370
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,826
Hunger.

371
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:30,591
I'm hungry. Come with me, Sara.

372
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,395
Don't behave as a fanatic,
waiting for things

373
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,935
that never happen until
we're finished.

374
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,538
Come with me!

375
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,505
Life is bigger than
the time we live in.

376
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:43,043
Life is an adventure!

377
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,271
You don't understand.

378
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:52,554
A man can't be divided this way...

379
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:59,456
Politics and poetry
are too much for only one man...

380
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,999
I'd love you to stay with us.

381
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,193
Return to writing.

382
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,530
I do not announce songs of peace...

383
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:16,074
Neither do I care
for the flowers of style.

384
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,913
Bad news everyday

385
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:26,012
that defines the world
I live in.

386
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,063
Sara...

387
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:41,597
Sunsets do not make
me feel the pain of adolescence.

388
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:49,310
I give back to the landscape,
the vomits of experience.

389
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,873
Poetry is senseless...

390
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,810
Words...

391
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,317
Words are useless...

392
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:46,033
When I came back to Eldorado,
I don't know when...

393
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:50,229
When I saw once again
the same landscape, nature,

394
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:55,810
the same people lost
in its impossible splendour.

395
00:41:56,881 --> 00:42:00,214
I brought the sadness
from lost encounters

396
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,783
and once again,
I got lost

397
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,921
in the depths of my senses.

398
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:09,853
I didn't believe in dreams,
in anything.

399
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:15,430
Only my flesh could burn and there
I could find myself.

400
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,173
I, Julio Fuentes,

401
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:05,542
declare a permanent
state of joy in Eldorado

402
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:12,518
and I greet Paulo Martins,
poet and patriot.

403
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:53,954
Get up, worm!

404
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:56,462
Go on!

405
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,398
Here is the very image
of a ruined man.

406
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,507
A mistake.

407
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:10,305
Take it, genius,
prop up this ruin!

408
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,146
Go.

409
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,185
Paulo, my friend...

410
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,827
Silvia, your man is back.

411
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,736
Paulo, my friend, he's back.

412
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:45,470
Don't touch my wife!

413
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,207
Leave her, you scum!

414
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:50,010
Leave my wife!

415
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:52,053
Take it!

416
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,951
We live with worms...
But it's dangerous,

417
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,526
they can devour our intestines.

418
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:03,927
The people.
They should invade the palaces!

419
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,668
The people, Paulo!

420
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:19,505
The guerrillas!

421
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,485
The guerrillas!

422
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:35,581
When beauty is overtaken by reality,

423
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:40,661
when we lose our purity
in these gardens of tropical diseases

424
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:44,390
when with anaemic people we breathe

425
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:49,334
the same air of the
worms in the animals' pores,

426
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:53,669
or when we flee from the streets
and inside our homes

427
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:58,575
poverty follows us in
it's most lethal forms,

428
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:03,685
Iike food, books,
records, clothes, plates, skin,

429
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:08,119
your liver bursts in rage,
your throat panics

430
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:11,657
and an inexplicable
oblivion of ourselves.

431
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:16,195
Finally
we feel that death converges,

432
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:22,736
into an aggressive form of life.

433
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:53,013
Wild sea that involves
me in this sweet continent...

434
00:49:55,592 --> 00:50:00,029
On this forgetfulness
I bestow my sad Latin voice,

435
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:03,061
sadder than revolt, and more...

436
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:08,932
I vomit in the streets
the acid dollar,

437
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,801
marching amongst dirty children,

438
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:15,739
with their blind birds' eyes.

439
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:19,107
I see the Atlantic dawn with blood,

440
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:22,750
under a constant metal jet threat.

441
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:27,384
War and wars in foreign countries.

442
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,989
I can say, an astronaut
was fulfilled on the moon.

443
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:38,958
Any joke is possible
in everyday tragedy.

444
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:44,139
I, for example,
I do the vain exercise of poetry.

445
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:56,549
I knowyou don"t want weapons

446
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:04,760
not, as well...
not to ask for more

447
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:12,130
that I came to you.

448
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:20,234
I agree,
it"s the best way.

449
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:28,617
There was a time
and time ends.

450
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:34,790
But see,

451
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:41,125
you"re not gone yet,

452
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:49,665
you"re anywhere
I breathe

453
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:56,311
Or I see, I dream,
or I dream about

454
00:51:56,546 --> 00:52:03,475
the mutation of things.
Tell about you

455
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:12,185
about us,
without us.

456
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:19,436
You"ve forgotten
to take yourself...

457
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:23,868
It was Vieira who asked

458
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:26,575
to see you and explain

459
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:34,013
that he can't do all by himself.

460
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:39,587
I know,
l' m worth nothing...

461
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,758
Oh! My beloved...

462
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,094
He's been tortured!

463
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,990
Tortured...

464
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:51,564
Paulo,
the worse things has happen to you...

465
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:54,599
Worst than anything you saw
in Alecrim.

466
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:59,866
I've been writing
about the misery of our souls...

467
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:11,813
You're a kind of anarchist,
but you can be useful.

468
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:15,286
So, please, don't be so kind.

469
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,428
Let me ask you something,

470
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:24,191
What was your deal with Vieira?

471
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:26,868
To change Eldorado.

472
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:29,697
Do the opposite of Diaz...

473
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,999
And what Diaz wanted?

474
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:35,973
To be preserved, as a mummy...

475
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,772
Why did you leave Vieira?

476
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:41,745
Because he doesn't yet have...
You know...

477
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:44,783
Vieira also didn't want a change.

478
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:47,148
Vieira is, at best,
paternalist...

479
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,051
I don't care about
his personal qualities...

480
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:50,224
His qualities...

481
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,586
Historical?

482
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:53,022
Historical!

483
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:56,027
So, historically Vieira can save Eldorado

484
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:57,893
from underdevelopment...

485
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:00,568
from the lnternational
Extraction Company's colonisation...

486
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:05,503
EXPLlNT!
Do they allow it?

487
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,941
Do you think
Explint will let you go on?

488
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,247
Enough theories!

489
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:19,387
Explint supports Diaz.
But if Diaz get weakened...

490
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:21,215
Diaz weakened...

491
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:23,392
Diaz weakened...

492
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:26,752
Diaz...

493
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,863
If you destroy Diaz

494
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,829
Using Julio Fuentes's press.

495
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,161
You know everything about Diaz...

496
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:36,599
I, betray Diaz for...

497
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,707
You knowyou can't ask that of me.

498
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,911
You have a commitment!

499
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:49,108
I have commitments? Which ones?
I've never assumed any...

500
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:54,222
You know better than l.

501
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,984
You know we all have commitments...

502
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:03,188
You know and you write about it.

503
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,697
With time...

504
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:11,498
Before, I wanted to change...
And if we do?

505
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:14,806
Change what for?

506
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:22,347
Go where?
With what weapons?

507
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:29,950
My inspiration
came from the punished flesh,

508
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:36,325
from these travelled eyes.

509
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:43,904
In this oblivion,
horizons searched by other poets...

510
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:01,580
I imported the best equipment...

511
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,885
Look! I was born there.

512
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:06,755
I'll do great campaigns...

513
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:10,227
Even confront Diaz...

514
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:13,932
Diaz will have a new network.

515
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:16,867
With whose money?

516
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:20,304
Our senator is a man with
no material ambition.

517
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:24,871
Sometime
I think he is a kind of

518
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:30,052
saint, genius, martyr...

519
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:32,151
Some day he will hurt you.

520
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:33,816
Never...

521
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,355
Actually, I had dinner

522
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,959
with Mr. Cassius at the Embassy...

523
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:41,322
He visits his friend everyday.

524
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:44,863
They talk about tropical plants.

525
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,701
I've imported some seeds.

526
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:51,733
Marvellous!

527
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:57,847
I gave them to Fernandez,
for the palace's gardens.

528
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:01,376
I've got new funds from
the National Bank.

529
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,714
Fernandez wants to appoint Silvia
to be our Ambassadress of beauty in...

530
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,150
Do you know Vieira?

531
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:10,325
-Vieira?
-He's much more serious.

532
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:11,792
Vieira?

533
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:14,690
Vieira is a provincial, a demagogo.

534
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,161
-Besides, I told the truth.
-He'd show out the farce.

535
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,292
What a farce?

536
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,060
Is there any other solution
for the country?

537
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:22,965
Which one?

538
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,945
Mr. Cassius is travelling?

539
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:39,316
He didn't sign the new contracts?!

540
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:44,454
It's absurd! Absurd!

541
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:47,094
They cancelled
the advertisement contracts.

542
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:54,301
What's the use of working?

543
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:59,668
I want to develop this little country,
I promote the arts,

544
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:03,106
I perform acts of charity,
I do useful things!

545
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:05,712
Paulo, Paulo warned you.

546
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:08,144
Shut up!
What you know about business?

547
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:10,181
I have the right cards.

548
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,445
And when one loses the game?

549
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:22,125
Lose the game? How?

550
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:27,133
It's dangerous to face strong enemies.

551
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:33,002
I'm able to face
any domestic or foreign company.

552
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,939
Can you confront Explint?

553
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:41,116
I ask, if they can confront me!

554
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:45,082
They are already doing it.

555
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:49,781
They've begun by cancelling the
advertisements.

556
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:55,791
My newspaper
and my network are independent.

557
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,067
I'll be supporting
pro-nationalist policies.

558
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:07,341
The Fuentes Empire, the biggest
economic organisation of Eldorado!

559
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:11,739
It claims to defend our wealth

560
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:14,074
from Explint exploitation!

561
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:17,775
But Fuentes have forgotten
one thing:

562
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:24,017
to do a political scheme
to face Explint.

563
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:27,991
And what have you done in politics?

564
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,198
I've been supporting Fernandez.

565
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:30,763
And who keeps him
in the presidency.

566
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:31,864
The constitution.

567
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:33,591
Explint!

568
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:38,102
Listen, Fuentes.
Don't you read your own newspaper?

569
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:41,435
I have warned you,
but rich people never think

570
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:45,011
that one day they'll wake up poor.

571
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:02,229
I've done many favours for Fernandez.

572
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:06,834
He prefers the opulent side.
The sons of the Enlightened City,

573
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,334
the civilised men.

574
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:12,837
They placed him in the presidency,

575
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:15,636
to protect our wealth from
the exploitation

576
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:18,278
you intend to defend.

577
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:23,178
They're all very nice,
as long as you don't threaten them.

578
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:31,293
Júlio Fuentes has grown...
so much...

579
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:34,792
that Explint can't take him anymore.

580
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:39,468
So, if Explint pushes the button,

581
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:42,466
Júlio Fuentes is dead!

582
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:50,469
No! No!
I can't die!

583
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:54,280
I'm richer than all Eldorado.

584
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:57,782
I own gold, silver, uranium mines.

585
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:02,117
I own the fruit fields,
the petroleum reserves...

586
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,653
the steel companies, the network...

587
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:10,866
I can't, I can't die!

588
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:15,765
A few days,
at the height of your glory,

589
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:19,133
you were the most
powerful man of the world!

590
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,070
I need you!

591
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,938
You and everybody!
I can't die!

592
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,705
Be afraid! Suffer!

593
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:29,645
Think!

594
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:45,929
Explint!

595
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:49,268
Diaz!

596
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:51,796
Fernandez!

597
01:01:54,410 --> 01:02:03,478
I'll destroy them all!

598
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:11,343
You'll manage the newspaper
and the TV,

599
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:14,283
I give you full liberty,

600
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:19,757
and full power
to do whatever you want.

601
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:23,557
Even I couldn't say why
I attacked Diaz.

602
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,826
At that moment I'd hurt
the one who had done most for me.

603
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:29,037
I was starting
a political adventure.

604
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:32,002
I couldn't have foreseen the outcome.

605
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:36,109
The only thing I knew was that
I couldn't stand that life,

606
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:39,405
and I had to find new ways.

607
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,277
Anyway, even leaving them

608
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:45,578
half-done, and waiting for others

609
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,620
cleverer than l,
who could reach the end...

610
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:51,349
But, if I wasn't dying now,

611
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:53,391
I also would reach the end.

612
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:57,656
I would,
because my roots aren't putrid.

613
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:01,926
Only one thing I knew, Sara.
I'd go for your love,

614
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,162
Although I was far away,
I loved you more

615
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:07,399
than I hated Eldorado.

616
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:13,639
By destroying Diaz, Sara,
I was to be free to go back to you...

617
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:22,052
To come back to Vieira's promises.
To believe in your love for the country.

618
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,919
You have to link Vieira
to Fuentes and destroy Diaz.

619
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:26,389
You're the only one who can do it.

620
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:27,618
Eldorado can't wait!

621
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,092
And you'll get nothing from it.

622
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:30,663
It's just a job.

623
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,026
Nobody will thank you.

624
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:34,168
Because it's nothing,
facing what you have to do.

625
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:35,870
You have to,
even if you don't believe in it.

626
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:37,129
Even if you adore Diaz.

627
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:38,465
Even if you hate Vieira.

628
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:39,675
Even if you die!

629
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:41,774
Even if everybody dies!

And attention,
Ladies and Gentlemen.

634
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:12,300
See how a politician is made.

635
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:16,477
See how a man, without
any contact with the people,

636
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:21,046
can be great and honoured,
in this Iand, EIdorado.

637
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:43,358
Here"s the main headlines
on Porfírio Diaz's Iife.

638
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,089
1920.

639
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:48,132
He appears as an extremist Ieader,
promoting students" strikes.

640
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,305
EIected to Congress.

641
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:52,530
1933.

642
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:56,006
He betrays the students" movement
and supports Villa FIores"s dictatorship.

643
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:58,406
He is appointed Secretary

644
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:00,547
1937.

645
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:03,684
He betrays Villa FIores and supports
Pancho Morales"s dictatorship.

646
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:06,046
He is appointed Secretary
of Culture.

01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:17,298
He suggests the purchase
of a war arsenal

652
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:18,932
from Explint.

653
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:20,999
He makes one million dollars.

654
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:23,865
1941, 1946.

655
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:27,974
EIdorado goes to war.
13,000 men die.

656
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:31,577
Explint finances his run
to the Senate.

657
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:34,715
1948, 1957.

658
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:37,145
The Senate overthrows EI Redentor.

659
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,946
Diaz Ieads Fernandez's election.

660
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:43,681
He forces Fernandez to agree
with Explint"s demands.

661
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:02,476
So, Ladies and Gentlemen,
the profile

662
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:06,203
of this man, who never
saw the people,

663
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:08,246
plans to overthrow Fernandez

664
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:12,750
and uses any possible weapon
to take him to power.

665
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:16,185
And for that, he will fight
he will manage

666
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:20,122
any policy, affirming
today yesterday"s Iies,

667
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:22,762
denying tomorrow
today"s truths.

668
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:26,764
So, this is the face
of democratic virtue.

669
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:29,994
This is the father of the nation.

670
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:01,368
He was dying like me.

671
01:09:01,603 --> 01:09:04,629
We were both suffering from it,
even before

672
01:09:04,873 --> 01:09:07,535
he asked for me,
and I went to see him.

673
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:10,643
I was full of hate and remorse...

674
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:34,733
I insist on it.

675
01:09:35,904 --> 01:09:39,032
I gave you the first opportunities.

676
01:09:39,274 --> 01:09:45,770
I have been betrayed by the most
sordid and despiteful men!

677
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:53,212
I shouldn't be betrayed by you!
You!

678
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:02,086
And how do you thank me?
How?

679
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:08,101
With gestures full
of political interest.

680
01:10:26,788 --> 01:10:29,655
What is political
interest compared to friendship?

681
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,956
There's nothing above friendship.

682
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:36,387
A friend always accepts another.

683
01:10:36,631 --> 01:10:40,158
Under any conditions,
a friend is a friend.

684
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:43,997
Have you forgotten everything?

685
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:46,298
Won't you apologise?

686
01:10:46,541 --> 01:10:50,739
Neither a "pardon"?
Won't you kiss my feet?

687
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:58,251
Who can save Eldorado but me?

688
01:10:59,721 --> 01:11:03,213
In whose name do you act?
For what?

689
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:06,256
What ideas foment

690
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,986
such hate against me?

691
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:13,566
What do you want? Money?

692
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:16,771
I give you all the money you want.

693
01:11:17,005 --> 01:11:21,704
Power?
Stay with me and it will be yours.

694
01:11:21,943 --> 01:11:24,969
If I wanted...

695
01:11:25,213 --> 01:11:28,080
If I wanted now.

696
01:11:28,316 --> 01:11:30,876
Politics is a weapon for the elect.

697
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:34,484
For the gods.

698
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:39,660
The extremists have created
the mystic of the people,

699
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:42,193
but the people are worthless.

700
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:44,524
The people are blind and vengeful.

701
01:11:44,766 --> 01:11:47,530
If one bothers about the people,
what would they do?

702
01:11:47,769 --> 01:11:50,135
Where is your conscience?

703
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:54,741
Not for all the gold in the world!

704
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:38,414
We're rotten for our crimes.

705
01:12:38,653 --> 01:12:41,645
For your crimes!

706
01:12:43,758 --> 01:12:49,219
I've washed my hands in blood,
but I've been humane!

707
01:12:49,464 --> 01:12:54,333
The blood of students,
peasants, workers!

708
01:12:54,569 --> 01:12:59,666
The blood of the worms!
We wash our souls.

709
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:02,206
We purify the world!

710
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:07,380
Our wealth, our flesh,
lives, everything.

711
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:09,846
You've sold everything!
Our hopes,

712
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:12,679
our heart, our love,
everything!

713
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:14,684
Everything!

714
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:17,084
Last chance, say yes!

715
01:13:17,325 --> 01:13:21,455
An epidemic rage, Diaz!
I destroy!

716
01:13:21,696 --> 01:13:23,527
With your fragile hands?

717
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:33,900
Alone, Paulo? Alone?

718
01:14:34,135 --> 01:14:39,937
Alone!
Paulo, alone!

719
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:11,864
A candidate from the people!

720
01:15:17,712 --> 01:15:23,742
"A LEADER MEETS THE PEOPLE"

721
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:54,306
Accept my support, Vieira.
Our President wants to be

722
01:15:54,549 --> 01:15:59,213
a new Napoleon
and Diaz a new Caesar!

723
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:03,584
Only you could be a new Lincoln!

724
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:06,760
Peter denied Christ three times!

725
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:10,021
But it was he,
who founded God's Church.

726
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:14,793
And Judas, the traitor,
hanged himself naked, naked!

727
01:16:15,036 --> 01:16:16,799
Gentlemen,

728
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:22,474
we will open trails in the forests,

729
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:25,976
we will found cities,

730
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:30,913
where there were savage lands.

731
01:16:31,152 --> 01:16:33,120
Bridges over rivers,

732
01:16:33,354 --> 01:16:35,914
roads crossing the desert,

733
01:16:36,157 --> 01:16:39,854
machines ripping
out minerals from the earth!

734
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:44,361
What would have become
of the Americas without priests?

735
01:16:44,599 --> 01:16:49,764
What about the Aztecs and the Mayas?

736
01:16:50,004 --> 01:16:56,239
What about the Tupis,
Tamoios and all the Amerindians?

737
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:59,743
What about the Faith?

738
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:35,774
What is the meaning of coherency?

739
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:39,741
They say it's wise to observe
history without suffering.

740
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:44,281
Until one day, by conscience,
the people takes over...

741
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:53,051
I walk and see these skinny,
apathetic, depressed people.

742
01:18:53,294 --> 01:18:56,923
These people can't believe
in any party.

743
01:18:57,165 --> 01:19:00,430
These feeble, bloodless people.

744
01:19:00,668 --> 01:19:05,298
These people need death above all.

745
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:08,634
The blood that
incites a brother to grief

746
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:12,210
the feeling of nothing
which leads to love.

747
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:17,544
Death like faith, not like fear.

748
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:37,269
Why, Paulo?

749
01:19:37,505 --> 01:19:39,871
Why do you wallow in this chaos?

750
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:48,105
Which chaos?

751
01:19:48,349 --> 01:19:51,113
Look, Vieira can't speak.

752
01:19:51,352 --> 01:19:55,083
Nobody won't, for over a century.

753
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:57,188
You've thrown Vieira into an abyss.

754
01:19:57,425 --> 01:20:00,451
Me? The abyss is here, wide-open.

755
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:02,959
We all march towards it.

756
01:20:03,197 --> 01:20:04,596
But it's not the people's fault.

757
01:20:04,832 --> 01:20:08,233
It's not the people's fault.
It's not!

758
01:20:10,838 --> 01:20:13,807
But they go after the first

759
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:17,102
who shows them a sword or a cross.

760
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:19,711
Jerônimo is the people.
Speak, Jerônimo.

761
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:22,712
Speak, Jerônimo. Speak!

762
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:41,830
Don't be afraid!
Speak! You are the people.

763
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:45,237
Speak.

764
01:21:10,164 --> 01:21:12,689
I'm a humble man, a worker.

765
01:21:12,934 --> 01:21:15,061
I'm the leader of my Union.

766
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:19,069
I've been in the class struggle.
Everything is wrong.

767
01:21:19,307 --> 01:21:21,639
I really don't knowwhat to do.

768
01:21:21,876 --> 01:21:24,674
The country is in crisis
and the best thing

769
01:21:24,912 --> 01:21:26,743
is to await the President's commands.

770
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:31,342
Do you see what the people are like?
Idiots!

771
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:35,750
An illiterate!
A petty politician!

772
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:40,859
Can you imagine Jerônimo in power?

773
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:04,878
A moment!
A moment, folks!

774
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,615
A moment!

775
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:14,621
Let me speak.

776
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:18,191
I'll speak.

777
01:22:29,777 --> 01:22:33,975
Excuse me sirs! Jerônimo

778
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:38,549
does the people's politics,
but he's not the people.

779
01:22:38,786 --> 01:22:41,584
The people are me.
I have seven children

780
01:22:41,823 --> 01:22:44,553
and have nowhere to live.

781
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:47,590
Extremist!
Extremist! Extremist!

782
01:22:47,829 --> 01:22:53,563
Extremist!
Extremist! Extremist...

783
01:23:06,647 --> 01:23:10,447
Hunger...
And illiteracy...

784
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:13,586
are extremist propaganda!

785
01:23:13,821 --> 01:23:18,884
Extremism is a virus that
infects actions,

786
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:21,994
infects the air, the blood,

787
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:24,994
infects the water and morals...

788
01:23:27,201 --> 01:23:30,227
In Eldorado

789
01:23:30,471 --> 01:23:33,338
there is no hunger,
no violence...

790
01:23:33,574 --> 01:23:35,405
nor poverty!

791
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:38,066
Political irresponsibility...

792
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:39,466
Your anarchism!

793
01:24:39,707 --> 01:24:43,268
Political irresponsibility...

794
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:44,603
political irresponsibility...

795
01:24:44,845 --> 01:24:46,005
Your anarchism.

796
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:49,114
Political irresponsibility.

797
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:50,749
Political irresponsibility.

798
01:24:50,985 --> 01:24:52,452
-Political irresponsibility.
-Your anarchism.

799
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:55,952
-Political irresponsibility.
-Your anarchism.

800
01:24:56,190 --> 01:24:59,455
-Political irresponsibility.
-Your anarchism.

801
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:02,822
-Political irresponsibility.
-Your anarchism.

802
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:05,430
Enough!

803
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:17,978
I'm almost 50 and I haven't
lost my dignity.

804
01:25:18,212 --> 01:25:21,409
Tell me, what you, Fuentes,
and the others want?

805
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:25,210
I'm not here to be
a political clown.

806
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:29,082
If you want power,
you have to bite into the struggle.

807
01:25:29,323 --> 01:25:33,225
I've told you,
inside the masses, there's man.

808
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:39,923
The Man is hard to control...
Harder than the masses.

809
01:25:40,167 --> 01:25:42,101
No more reactionary theories!

810
01:25:42,336 --> 01:25:45,203
Reactionaries?

811
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:02,479
We've gone too far.

812
01:26:02,723 --> 01:26:05,123
Maybe now it's late to go back.

813
01:26:05,359 --> 01:26:06,826
I understand...

814
01:26:18,472 --> 01:26:21,339
The trance of the mystics.

815
01:26:22,576 --> 01:26:26,637
Look in our eyes, our skin.

816
01:26:26,881 --> 01:26:30,339
If we observe it clearly,

817
01:26:30,584 --> 01:26:34,645
or only through violence.

818
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:13,182
Every time I fought
for the underprivileged majorities,

819
01:27:13,427 --> 01:27:17,227
I was stupidly threatened.

820
01:27:17,465 --> 01:27:20,161
I stepped back many times,

821
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:23,837
delaying today's
problems to think of the future.

822
01:27:24,071 --> 01:27:27,199
But if I send the present
to the future,

823
01:27:27,441 --> 01:27:31,935
I'll only find a future
drowned in tragedies.

824
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:36,344
That's why I must now face

825
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:40,418
Eldorado's enemies,
here and abroad.

826
01:27:42,022 --> 01:27:43,853
Unite the masses.

827
01:27:46,193 --> 01:27:48,058
Break away, once and for all.

828
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:53,231
Cast off the boat!

829
01:29:08,542 --> 01:29:09,736
Do you know what he wanted?

830
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:13,469
To use the press to support
the extremists.

831
01:29:13,714 --> 01:29:18,083
Use Vieira for this end.

832
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:20,344
And where is he now?

833
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:25,685
With the President,
saying Vieira leads the populace.

834
01:29:25,926 --> 01:29:28,258
The populace.

835
01:29:28,496 --> 01:29:30,930
Mr. Cassius visited me yesterday

836
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:33,929
to say how disappointed
he was with you.

837
01:29:34,168 --> 01:29:36,500
He was the one who forced
the President

838
01:29:36,737 --> 01:29:39,797
to use freedom of the Press.

839
01:29:40,774 --> 01:29:43,436
But how could
I know you'd surrender

840
01:29:43,677 --> 01:29:47,408
to Paulo Martins madness.

841
01:29:48,616 --> 01:29:52,985
You know, Silvia,
why do they think we're irresponsible?

842
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:56,986
Explint, for example,
helped you to buy the equipment.

843
01:29:57,224 --> 01:30:00,284
Paulo guaranteed me that
their competition would be disastrous.

844
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:03,122
Paulo! Does he have
any political coherency?

845
01:30:03,364 --> 01:30:05,127
And Vieira is a democrat.

846
01:30:05,366 --> 01:30:07,960
Democrat!
He comes from the Extremist Party.

847
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:09,396
You too.

848
01:30:09,637 --> 01:30:11,366
But I met God!

849
01:30:11,605 --> 01:30:13,835
I know,
but the cards have been dealt.

850
01:30:14,074 --> 01:30:15,666
We' re on opposite sides.

851
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:19,903
Opposite!
Bravo! Bravo!

852
01:30:20,147 --> 01:30:22,581
Don't use this proud language.

853
01:30:22,816 --> 01:30:26,081
Because you're not prouder
or more impetuous than Paulo.

854
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:29,881
Silence, Júlio.
Silence!

855
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:33,491
Then, Álvaro came
to tell about the betrayal.

856
01:30:33,727 --> 01:30:35,695
Álvaro came as dead as me.

857
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:38,922
He felt sick on blood.

858
01:30:42,736 --> 01:30:46,900
The revolutionaries...
A bunch of clowns!

859
01:30:47,141 --> 01:30:51,771
Do you know what the result of Paulo,
Vieira and the extremists' pact is?

860
01:30:52,012 --> 01:30:57,416
Vieira, once in power,
they will eliminate you.

861
01:30:58,652 --> 01:31:00,677
They don't respect pacts.

862
01:31:02,356 --> 01:31:03,948
I am left-wing.

863
01:31:04,191 --> 01:31:05,818
Left what?

864
01:31:11,398 --> 01:31:14,060
Look, idiot...

865
01:31:14,301 --> 01:31:16,531
The class struggle exists.

866
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:20,228
What is your class?
Go on, say it!

867
01:31:27,948 --> 01:31:29,848
If we develop industry,

868
01:31:30,084 --> 01:31:32,314
create jobs, perhaps...

869
01:31:32,553 --> 01:31:35,716
Like starving beasts,
they'll want more and more.

870
01:31:35,956 --> 01:31:39,790
Even your own blood.
They want power.

871
01:31:40,027 --> 01:31:44,327
The people in power? Never!

872
01:31:44,565 --> 01:31:47,159
Understand? Never!

873
01:31:48,402 --> 01:31:56,070
For freedom, we' ll die,
for God, for power!

874
01:32:00,314 --> 01:32:03,010
How can I take power without
Paulo and Fuentes's help?

875
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:05,241
Without the best men?

876
01:32:05,486 --> 01:32:08,080
Paulo betrayed me long ago.

877
01:32:08,322 --> 01:32:10,517
Fuentes is reluctant to support me.

878
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:13,758
How?

879
01:32:15,896 --> 01:32:17,261
How can I explain it to my partners?

880
01:32:17,498 --> 01:32:19,159
You have to explain nothing.

881
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:22,335
Let's take the power in a coup.
Change the game.

882
01:32:22,569 --> 01:32:25,538
Let's write history.

883
01:32:27,374 --> 01:32:28,432
But they have the guarantees.

884
01:32:28,676 --> 01:32:30,200
I have the guarantees!

885
01:32:31,245 --> 01:32:32,303
Which ones?

886
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:36,950
By elections, Vieira wins.

887
01:32:37,951 --> 01:32:44,151
Without elections, I win,
overthrowing Fernandez.

888
01:32:44,391 --> 01:32:46,951
Only with your ideas?

889
01:32:48,362 --> 01:32:50,660
With Explint's support,

890
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:54,299
by using its propaganda machine.

891
01:32:56,503 --> 01:32:58,403
Explint will pay.

892
01:33:00,607 --> 01:33:02,472
Paid propaganda.

893
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:10,884
Then, Álvaro came
to tell about the betrayal.

894
01:33:11,118 --> 01:33:13,382
Álvaro came
as dead as me.

895
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:16,384
He felt sick on blood.

896
01:33:16,623 --> 01:33:20,184
While the mini-genius of politics
was planning a revolution,

897
01:33:20,427 --> 01:33:22,054
Fuentes and Diaz...

898
01:33:22,296 --> 01:33:23,854
Fuentes and Diaz?

899
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:27,659
together with Explint to defeat you,
Vieira and Fernandez.

900
01:33:29,369 --> 01:33:30,893
Did you see?

901
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:35,437
With these blind eyes,
these dumb mouths...

902
01:33:35,676 --> 01:33:36,973
Look, Paulo,

903
01:33:37,211 --> 01:33:40,078
all I can do is to advise exile.

904
01:33:42,649 --> 01:33:46,449
And me, working night and day,
Fuentes...

905
01:33:46,687 --> 01:33:48,450
Your naiveté...

906
01:33:48,689 --> 01:33:52,056
So much work, so much effort...

907
01:33:52,292 --> 01:33:54,419
Actually Fuentes and Diaz
want you to quit everything

908
01:33:54,661 --> 01:33:56,094
and go back to them.

909
01:33:56,330 --> 01:33:59,663
And I am dirty, the monster?

910
01:34:01,101 --> 01:34:03,763
I don't know, I'm not interested
in your convictions.

911
01:34:05,773 --> 01:34:07,365
Your life interests me.

912
01:34:07,608 --> 01:34:09,940
What counts is that I am free!

913
01:34:10,177 --> 01:34:12,077
And I won't step back.

914
01:34:12,312 --> 01:34:14,371
Who's free? Who?

915
01:34:16,116 --> 01:34:21,281
Diaz. Diaz is.

916
01:34:22,289 --> 01:34:26,623
Your images, dreams.
You're a poor copy of Diaz.

917
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:35,768
No. Diaz is my enemy.
He's not in my blood.

918
01:34:38,572 --> 01:34:42,099
It's too late!

919
01:34:43,710 --> 01:34:46,406
Maybe we can resist, with Vieira.

920
01:34:47,915 --> 01:34:50,440
He doesn't have the greatness
of a leader.

921
01:34:52,386 --> 01:34:56,686
Álvaro, I don't know, I don't know...

922
01:34:56,924 --> 01:35:00,382
Don't make me smash your face!

923
01:35:00,627 --> 01:35:08,659
Smash it! It's worthless. Smash it!

924
01:35:10,571 --> 01:35:15,531
I have no pride. No vanity.

925
01:35:16,977 --> 01:35:21,914
Nor ambition. Smash it!

926
01:35:37,965 --> 01:35:39,296
My friend...

927
01:35:57,284 --> 01:35:58,615
My friend?

928
01:35:59,953 --> 01:36:03,980
You were my friend?
I was your friend...

929
01:36:04,224 --> 01:36:06,920
But you took advantage
of my weakness

930
01:36:09,129 --> 01:36:10,858
and betrayed your style.

931
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:13,066
React! React!

932
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:15,632
React against what?
Against whom?

933
01:36:17,537 --> 01:36:20,028
Only you can react to survive.

934
01:36:21,074 --> 01:36:23,065
Call Fuentes, sell your soul.

935
01:36:32,419 --> 01:36:36,048
For Silvia, she loves you.

936
01:36:53,273 --> 01:37:00,805
Beyond hate, beyond life, it's late.

937
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:04,341
I'll be with Vieira until the end.

938
01:37:07,587 --> 01:37:09,452
I can do nothing

939
01:37:11,291 --> 01:37:16,319
to avoid these
coming days of darkness.

940
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:20,867
That's why I gave up.

941
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:28,564
That's why I died!

942
01:37:30,911 --> 01:37:34,779
Democracy is the exercise
of the will of the people.

943
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:40,920
We've been elected by the people,
so we' re representatives of their will.

944
01:37:41,154 --> 01:37:43,452
It's a time of decisions.

945
01:37:44,925 --> 01:37:48,827
The reactionaries will eat
the dust of history.

946
01:37:49,062 --> 01:37:52,395
Let's do our historical duty

947
01:37:52,632 --> 01:37:57,695
by forcing the President
to exterminate Vieira

948
01:37:57,938 --> 01:38:02,739
and his agents
all over Eldorado.

949
01:38:02,976 --> 01:38:07,936
I'll defend our wealth from
the foreign invader!

950
01:38:08,181 --> 01:38:13,483
God is my emblem!
Work is my flag!

951
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:16,280
My destiny is happiness!

952
01:38:16,523 --> 01:38:20,755
My principle, purity of character!

953
01:38:20,994 --> 01:38:27,695
With strong arms, clean hands,
conscience at peace,

954
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:32,228
we will build a great nation.

955
01:38:32,472 --> 01:38:35,930
The nation is untouchable!

956
01:38:36,176 --> 01:38:39,668
The family, sacred!

957
01:38:39,913 --> 01:38:44,407
My hope is the sunshine...

958
01:38:44,651 --> 01:38:48,417
Only one force can change history

959
01:38:48,655 --> 01:38:52,523
and nobody will stop it.

960
01:38:52,759 --> 01:38:55,455
This sunshine will light our lives.

961
01:38:55,695 --> 01:39:00,428
Dawn follows every night.
The mornings are never late!

962
01:39:00,667 --> 01:39:03,898
This strength, is the people.

963
01:39:06,673 --> 01:39:12,839
Vieira! Vieira!

964
01:39:31,598 --> 01:39:36,934
He is the people.
He is the people!

965
01:39:37,170 --> 01:39:42,472
The shining mornings, alive, eternal,

966
01:39:42,709 --> 01:39:48,841
everlasting, unchanging, infinite!

967
01:40:43,403 --> 01:40:44,700
Let's divide the country.

968
01:40:44,938 --> 01:40:47,304
If you say so, we'll bombard Eldorado.

969
01:40:48,742 --> 01:40:50,209
I don't care about bloodshed...

970
01:40:50,443 --> 01:40:52,343
I say!
The blood of the masses is sacred!

971
01:40:52,579 --> 01:40:54,376
It will be the beginning
of our history.

972
01:40:54,614 --> 01:40:56,844
If we fail, Diaz will rise to power.

973
01:40:57,083 --> 01:41:00,951
See Sara? Who was our leader?

974
01:41:02,789 --> 01:41:05,349
Our great leader?

975
01:41:05,592 --> 01:41:08,083
Obey my command.
Disperse any resistance!

976
01:41:11,765 --> 01:41:15,701
No more condecorations,

977
01:41:15,936 --> 01:41:18,928
this joyous pomp of glories.

978
01:41:19,172 --> 01:41:22,198
This golden hope on the Plateau.

979
01:41:22,442 --> 01:41:25,969
No more this regal parade

980
01:41:26,213 --> 01:41:29,444
with war and Christ
marching side by side!

981
01:41:29,683 --> 01:41:33,346
No more the impotence of faith,

982
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:35,487
the naiveté of faith...

983
01:41:35,722 --> 01:41:38,452
It's no longer possible...

984
01:41:40,994 --> 01:41:43,428
We are eternal sons of darkness,

985
01:41:43,663 --> 01:41:45,597
of inquisition and conversion!

986
01:41:45,832 --> 01:41:48,892
And we are forever, sons of fear,

987
01:41:49,135 --> 01:41:52,161
of our brother's blood!

988
01:41:52,405 --> 01:41:54,532
And we don't accept our violence,

989
01:41:54,774 --> 01:41:56,639
we don't accept our ideas,

990
01:41:56,876 --> 01:42:00,368
neither our barbarian hate.

991
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:02,912
We don't assume our stupid
and feeble past,

992
01:42:03,149 --> 01:42:07,085
plenty of prayers and laziness.

993
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:10,983
A landscape,
a sound over indolent souls...

994
01:42:11,224 --> 01:42:15,991
These indolent races,
servile to God and the lords.

995
01:42:16,229 --> 01:42:19,995
A typical passive indolence
of indolent people.

996
01:42:20,233 --> 01:42:24,033
Ah, I can't believe it's all true!

997
01:42:24,271 --> 01:42:26,296
How long can we stand it?

998
01:42:26,539 --> 01:42:30,066
How long, beyond faith and hope,
can we stand it?

999
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:34,246
Until when, beyond patience and love,
can we stand it?

1000
01:42:34,481 --> 01:42:37,382
Until when, oblivious to fear,

1001
01:42:37,617 --> 01:42:40,177
beyond childhood and adolescence,

1002
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:42,217
can we stand it....

1003
01:42:49,729 --> 01:42:51,856
What does your death prove?

1004
01:42:52,098 --> 01:42:55,761
The triumph of beauty and justice!

1005
01:43:02,375 --> 01:43:05,606
They will learn! They will!

1006
01:43:05,845 --> 01:43:07,710
I will dominate this land.

1007
01:43:07,947 --> 01:43:11,110
I will put these hysterical
traditions in order!

1008
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:15,515
By force,
by the "the love of force"!

1009
01:43:15,755 --> 01:43:19,623
By hell's universal harmony,

1010
01:43:19,859 --> 01:43:23,659
we will be a civilisation!

1011
01:43:36,543 --> 01:43:38,977
What does your death prove?

1012
01:43:39,212 --> 01:43:45,014
The triumph of beauty and justice!
