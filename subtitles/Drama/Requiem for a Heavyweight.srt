1
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,952
<i>Another hard jolt by Clay...</i>

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,112
<i>and once again the cut</i>
<i>over Mountain Rivera's left eye opens up.</i>

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,556
<i>Mountain moves away, giving ground,</i>
<i>but Clay lands another left.</i>

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,949
<i>Follows it with a slicing right.</i>

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,152
<i>A sudden hook by Mountain</i>
<i>drives Clay against the ropes.</i>

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,915
<i>He follows it up with a series</i>
<i>of staggering rights and lefts.</i>

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,709
<i>The old pro won't quit, even though</i>
<i>his blood's splattered all over Clay.</i>

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,555
<i>Now Rivera's left eye is completely closed</i>
<i>as he leans on Clay, barely hanging on.</i>

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,358
<i>With time running out in Round 7...</i>

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,557
<i>Rivera tries desperately</i>
<i>to get his bloodied eyes in focus.</i>

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,515
Get away from him! Get away!

12
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,873
Go back!

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,309
Three... four...

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,910
five... six...

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,956
seven... eight...

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,515
nine...

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,469
ten.

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,475
Doctor.

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,195
Come on.

20
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,239
Ladies and gentlemen<i>...</i>

21
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,153
Take him to the dressing room.
Dr. Gilbert will look him over.

22
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,199
...and 13 seconds of the seventh round...

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,637
winner by a knockout, Cassius Clay.

24
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,314
Great fight, kid. You were great.

25
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,318
Cassius, when did you really know
you had him?

26
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,472
A guy like Mountain can explode anytime.

27
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,757
I rocked him in the second,
and I figured I had him from then on.

28
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,559
Help me with him, will you?
Thanks a lot, Charlie.

29
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,036
Maish, hang on to him.

30
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,352
Mountain, listen, you<i>'</i>re all right,
you understand?

31
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,593
Pretty cute, Maish.

32
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,759
Mountain, be careful.
Be careful, Mountain.

33
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,396
Mountain, listen, you<i>'</i>re okay.

34
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,232
You<i>'</i>re okay, Mountain.

35
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,035
Yes, boss.

36
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,678
Get out of here.

37
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,433
Sit down.

38
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,756
Mountain, can you hear me?

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,273
Mountain, where are you?

40
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,115
I<i>'</i>m in Pittsburgh and it<i>'</i>s raining.

41
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,310
You<i>'</i>re in New York,
St. Christopher<i>'</i>s Arena.

42
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,589
New York.

43
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,716
Yeah, that<i>'</i>s right. I<i>'</i>m in New York.

44
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,074
Maish...

45
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,753
this boy<i>'</i>s fast, man.

46
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,751
It<i>'</i>s okay, pal. It<i>'</i>s all over.

47
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,828
Gotta stop him!

48
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,675
Stop it!

49
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,478
He<i>'</i>ll be all right.

50
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,719
He<i>'</i>ll be all right.

51
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,710
He<i>'</i>ll come out of it all right.
Now put him on the table.

52
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,869
Gently.

53
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,149
You had no business in there, Maish.

54
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,277
- You hungry or something?
- What do you mean, hungry?

55
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,430
In 1952, he was number five.

56
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,033
1952?

57
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,837
When was that, Maish? Last Thursday?

58
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,911
You take a look at the eye.

59
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,118
Now look at this eye.

60
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,388
You see the pupil? You see the tissue?

61
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,069
That<i>'</i>s known as sclerotic damage.

62
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,114
The inner structure shows
it could lead to a detached retina.

63
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,191
A couple of good rights to that eye...

64
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,192
you can buy him a tin cup
and some pencils.

65
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,039
Or maybe it doesn<i>'</i>t have to happen
that way, Maish.

66
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,557
Maybe some day he<i>'</i>ll bang his head
on a bathroom door and bleed to death.

67
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,632
Either way, Maish.
It could happen either way.

68
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,632
No more. This is it.

69
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,833
- What are you talking about, no more?
- No more.

70
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,309
That<i>'</i>ll be my recommendation
to the Commission.

71
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,630
I got nothing scheduled for him.
He can rest.

72
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,790
He can rest up the rest of his life.

73
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,553
What<i>'</i>s the matter with you?
He<i>'</i>s 17 years in this business.

74
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,393
Suddenly he gets a cut
and I gotta put him out to pasture?

75
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,995
It isn<i>'</i>t one cut and it isn<i>'</i>t suddenly.
It<i>'</i>s 17 years of cuts.

76
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,117
- How long do you expect him to go on?
- He looks good in the ring.

77
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,760
He<i>'</i>s sharp. Sometimes he<i>'</i>s plenty sharp.
He<i>'</i>s a pro.

78
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,717
That<i>'</i>s probably what kept him alive.

79
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,509
Hey, Doc,
you got any of those ammonia things?

80
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,395
You apply some strips to his upper lid.

81
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,358
You let me know
if there<i>'</i>s any change in his condition.

82
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,079
You got any more big, fat suggestions?

83
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,117
Tell him to buy a scrapbook.

84
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,919
Don<i>'</i>t fight!

85
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,676
I know, I know, but don<i>'</i>t fight!

86
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,470
You okay? Come on now.

87
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,118
Come on now.

88
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,151
Take a good deep breath.

89
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,998
That<i>'</i>s right. Inhale.

90
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,552
He stopped me good.

91
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,193
Forget it.

92
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,748
You were beautiful.
He just happened to throw a lucky punch.

93
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,435
Your boy caught it tonight, Maish.

94
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,192
That<i>'</i>s very interesting!
My eye feels funny.

95
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,829
Mountain!

96
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,870
He must have caught me good.

97
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,234
You all right now? Come on, let me see.

98
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,792
What<i>'</i>s the matter with my eye?
My eye feels funny.

99
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,675
No, don<i>'</i>t touch it!

100
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,068
- It<i>'</i>s deep?
- Deep enough.

101
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,799
I got a nice clear view into your head.

102
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,275
Go take a shower. You<i>'</i>ll feel better.

103
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,434
Take a deep breath.

104
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,239
- I<i>'</i>m gonna go straight in.
- No slipping.

105
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,228
There<i>'</i>s something wrong, ain<i>'</i>t there?

106
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,557
Something wrong? What<i>'</i>s going on?

107
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,189
Where were you when the lights went out?
I lost a boy tonight. Get with it.

108
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,111
- Besides that.
- <i>"</i>Besides that<i>"</i> nothing.

109
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,636
- I saw Greeny giving you the eye.
- I told you to forget it.

110
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,599
All I got to do is go hunting and pecking
and find myself another boy.

111
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,719
- Maybe I<i>'</i>ll try a lightweight this time.
- Another boy? What about him, Maish?

112
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,830
Let him do what you did,
become a cut man or something.

113
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,589
Maybe he<i>'</i>s lucky at that.
At least he walks away with his brains.

114
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,193
That<i>'</i>s more than most.

115
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,319
That<i>'</i>s very funny.

116
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,958
Seventeen years. At least he<i>'</i>s lucky
if he walks away with his brains.

117
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,429
It<i>'</i>s a great sport.

118
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,795
Sport? Are you kidding?

119
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,430
If there was headroom,
they<i>'</i>d hold these things in sewers.

120
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,792
- Come in here. Could you get me a shirt?
- Yeah.

121
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,671
I feel better after the shower.

122
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,709
My eye feels kind of funny, though.

123
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,954
Sit down.

124
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,276
What did he catch me with?

125
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,277
- He caught you with an uppercut.
- Uppercut.

126
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,359
Sucker punch.

127
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,074
That kid, a couple of years ago<i>...</i>

128
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,869
My legs get tired lately.

129
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,080
But I can take that kid.

130
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,119
Maish, I want to fight that kid again.

131
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,117
I want you to get me a rematch.

132
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,757
I got something to tell you.

133
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,198
The doc was in here.

134
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,913
He says you got to quit. No more fights.

135
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,236
What do you mean, I got to quit?

136
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,077
He feels you<i>'</i>ve had it.

137
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,076
What are you talking about?

138
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,633
You got to quit, Mountain.
You can<i>'</i>t fight anymore.

139
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,955
Why? Because I got knocked out?

140
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,633
Don<i>'</i>t everybody get knocked out?
Louis, even Patterson?

141
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,193
That<i>'</i>s crazy!

142
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,148
All right, maybe I think it<i>'</i>s crazy,
but that<i>'</i>s what the doc says.

143
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,673
Go fight the Commission.

144
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,399
So you<i>'</i>re gonna take
some lousy horse doctor<i>'</i>s word?

145
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,549
Listen...

146
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,036
the doc said if you take a couple
more bangs on that left eye...

147
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,156
you<i>'</i>ll end up selling pencils.

148
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,311
You got sclerotic damage.

149
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,312
So what do I do now?

150
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,149
A guy<i>'</i>s got to do something.

151
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,909
All right, so you do something.
Do something you like.

152
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,956
All I know how to do is fight.
I<i>'</i>ve been with you guys for 17 years.

153
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,433
Why don<i>'</i>t you go back home
to New Mexico or something?

154
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,831
Why, what<i>'</i>s back there?

155
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,556
I wouldn<i>'</i>t remember nobody
and nobody would remember me.

156
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,193
Maish, maybe we can try
in some other state?

157
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,430
If you don<i>'</i>t pass muster
in New York State...

158
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,478
you don<i>'</i>t pass muster anyplace else.
You know that.

159
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,639
What about some club fights,
tank towns, unofficial?

160
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,356
You got to face up to it, Mountain.
You can<i>'</i>t fight anymore.

161
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,710
Come on, let<i>'</i>s get out of here.

162
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,994
Maish...

163
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,277
I<i>'</i>m sorry about tonight.

164
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,678
I<i>'</i>m sorry I lost.

165
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,517
You don<i>'</i>t have to feel sorry.

166
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,833
As far as I<i>'</i>m concerned,
you were number one.

167
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,319
That<i>'</i>s what you were.

168
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,430
Don<i>'</i>t give it another thought.

169
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,756
I took a bath tonight, Maish.

170
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,073
I don<i>'</i>t want this complicated.

171
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,628
Don<i>'</i>t make no long speech, just tell me...

172
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,553
didn<i>'</i>t you phone me
and say your boy wouldn<i>'</i>t last...

173
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,312
more than four rounds?

174
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,875
Didn<i>'</i>t you make a personal guarantee?

175
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,751
He was up against Clay.

176
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,629
Two rounds, three rounds,
at the outside, four...

177
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,075
but never seven rounds, Ma.
Never seven.

178
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,957
Last question, Maishy.

179
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,356
Didn<i>'</i>t you have us put up a bet
for you of $1,500?

180
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,230
And then on your word,
we put up a bundle of our own?

181
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,833
Aren<i>'</i>t you gonna pay us back now, Maish?

182
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,270
Certainly, I<i>'</i>m going to pay you.

183
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,238
I<i>'</i>ll give you the $1,500.
I just need a couple of months.

184
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,238
This was a bet, not a bank loan.

185
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,272
The bundle, and in cash,
by the first of the month.

186
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,315
Cash for your $1,500, cash for our bundle.

187
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,799
And Maishy...

188
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,672
you had better be ready.

189
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,989
Just one little last reminder,
so Mr. Rennick don<i>'</i>t forget.

190
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,073
Wait a minute. Wait...

191
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,514
Yeah?

192
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,157
Hey, Maish. What<i>...</i>

193
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,197
You know, he was worried about you,
you know?

194
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,469
Okay.

195
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,309
I<i>'</i>ll tell him.

196
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,434
Okay. All right<i>. '</i>Bye.

197
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,871
Mountain, that was Maish on the phone.

198
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,758
- Is he all right?
- He<i>'</i>s fine.

199
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,559
He hung one on last night.
He<i>'</i>s got a head like a balloon.

200
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,675
I was worried.

201
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,799
- He never stayed out all night before.
- You don<i>'</i>t have to worry about him.

202
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,313
Where are you<i>...</i>

203
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,914
Where are you going to go first, Mountain?

204
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,358
- No, the one over here, with the circle.
- Right.

205
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,149
<i>"</i>Wanted: Movie ushers.
No exp. Necessary<i>."</i>

206
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,959
- What does it mean, <i>"</i>exp<i>."</i>?
- Experience.

207
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,270
<i>"</i>Uniforms furnished<i>."</i>

208
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,952
- Can you imagine me in a uniform?
- Yeah.

209
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,758
You<i>'</i>ll look like a general.

210
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,510
- No experience necessary.
- Yeah.

211
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,636
How much <i>"</i>exp<i>"</i> do you need to <i>"</i>ush<i>"</i>?

212
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,199
The same as a butcher needs to <i>"</i>butch<i>."</i>
Wait, Mountain! Wait!

213
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,917
- Here. That<i>'</i>s it.
- Thanks.

214
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,116
- Say, that<i>'</i>s a wild tie you got there.
- Yeah.

215
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,272
- Listen. Maybe there<i>'</i>s a better tie...
- No, I want to wear this.

216
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,920
Maish gave this to me two years ago
for good luck.

217
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,592
Hey, good luck!

218
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,795
Yeah.

219
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,600
Size 40? Step over there, please.

220
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,950
No. I<i>'</i>m sorry, nothing for you.

221
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,597
Can I see your hands, please?
No, I<i>'</i>m sorry.

222
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,995
38? Step over here, please.

223
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,433
Size 40? Step over there, please.

224
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,518
38? Step over here, please.

225
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,354
Size 40.

226
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,319
40? You look more like a 46.

227
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,553
I could probably squeeze into a 40.

228
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,833
No, I<i>'</i>m sorry.
We don<i>'</i>t have a uniform your size.

229
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,037
You didn<i>'</i>t say nothing
about no sizes in this ad.

230
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,917
- Lf you were looking...
- Mountain!

231
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,356
You<i>'</i>re too big for the job.
I like TV better, anyway.

232
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,875
38? Step over here, please.

233
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,636
36? Step over here, please.

234
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,518
Look, George, would I be asking you
unless it was something serious?

235
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,353
Whenever you came to me I had it for you.

236
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,475
I<i>'</i>m in a bind, that<i>'</i>s why.

237
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,029
Look, George.

238
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,309
George?

239
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,113
Mr. Oakland?

240
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,873
Mr. Oakland?

241
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,313
Wait, where are you going?

242
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,596
- Let<i>'</i>s get out of here.
- What do you mean?

243
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,035
- I<i>'</i>ve been waiting a long time.
- I don<i>'</i>t care.

244
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,793
- We got to wait.
- We went to 20 of these places last week.

245
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,314
- Ain<i>'</i>t nothing gonna happen.
- This will be different.

246
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,356
There<i>'</i>s questions
I don<i>'</i>t know how to answer.

247
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,830
If you don<i>'</i>t know how to answer it,
you don<i>'</i>t answer it, that<i>'</i>s all.

248
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,797
- Come on, I<i>'</i>ll buy you a beer.
- No, no.

249
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,711
- Mr. Rivera?
- That<i>'</i>s you.

250
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,756
- Mr. Rivera.
- Right here, ma<i>'</i>am.

251
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,116
- Room 3, please.
- Room 3.

252
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,275
Room 3.

253
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,395
- Come on.
- No. No!

254
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,995
No.

255
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,269
Sorry, the man...

256
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,638
- Sit down. I<i>'</i>ll be with you in a minute.
- He had no business firing me.

257
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,996
Last Thursday, I walked into his office
not five minutes after 8:30...

258
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,833
I<i>'</i>m awfully sorry about the whole thing,
Mr. McNulty...

259
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,390
but our concern here
is finding a job for the applicant.

260
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,792
I<i>'</i>ve got some rights in a situation like this.

261
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,555
You know, I<i>'</i>m going to have a word or two
with your supervisor.

262
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,269
May I look at your form, please?

263
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,035
Thank you.

264
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,028
Lewis Rivera, age 37.
Place of birth: New Mexico.

265
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,192
Now, your education.
You left that blank, Mr. Rivera.

266
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,316
- Education, you mean like school?
- Right.

267
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,515
Sixth grade.

268
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,835
- Sixth grade. And then you left, is that it?
- That<i>'</i>s right.

269
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,035
Now...

270
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,952
past employment record.

271
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,429
You have nothing written down here,
Mr. Rivera.

272
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,511
Who have been your past employers?

273
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,316
You see, all I<i>'</i>ve been doing
for the past 17 years is fighting.

274
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,472
You know, in the ring.

275
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,159
In the prize ring.

276
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,313
- You mean a prizefighter?
- That<i>'</i>s right, a prizefighter.

277
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,676
- A professional prizefighter?
- Yeah, I<i>'</i>m a heavyweight.

278
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,354
That sounds like interesting work,
Mr. Rivera.

279
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,192
Well, it<i>'</i>s a living.

280
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,553
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

281
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,989
Miss Miller.

282
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,908
Hello, Cathy.

283
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,636
Yes, I am, but go ahead.

284
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,873
No, I wasn<i>'</i>t kidding. I had a lovely time.

285
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,311
Not to me, he didn<i>'</i>t.

286
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,950
He was an absolute gentleman.

287
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,508
Well, you know him better than I do.

288
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,349
Cathy, I can<i>'</i>t talk now.

289
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,714
What? I didn<i>'</i>t hear what you said.

290
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,712
No, of course I won<i>'</i>t say anything.

291
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,912
I<i>'</i>ll see you<i>. '</i>Bye.

292
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,399
I<i>'</i>m sorry.

293
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,111
Now, where were we?

294
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,388
Past employers.

295
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,754
- You<i>'</i>re a prizefighter.
- That<i>'</i>s right.

296
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,953
It would be rather difficult to place you
in any kind of related field.

297
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,591
Well, I need a job,
so anything you<i>'</i>ve got is okay.

298
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,636
You know, dishwashing...

299
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,315
maybe a bouncer,
or even maybe a day labourer.

300
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,510
But, you see, we have to take
into account past experience.

301
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,592
What else am I supposed to know
how to do besides fight?

302
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,274
See<i>...</i>

303
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,676
Like that question, there.

304
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,079
You know,
<i>"</i>Why did you leave your last job?<i>"</i>

305
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,594
What am I supposed to write down?

306
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,428
The doc<i>...</i>

307
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,116
I mean the doc said, <i>"</i>No more<i>."</i>

308
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,430
He looked into my eyes.

309
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,911
You can<i>'</i>t see it, but he looked in and said
one or two more and I might go blind.

310
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,596
- I see.
- I mean<i>...</i>

311
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,877
No! Well, it<i>'</i>s just a bum break, that<i>'</i>s all.

312
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,671
You know, in 1952,
they ranked me number five?

313
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,749
I<i>'</i>m not kidding you.
They ranked me number five.

314
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,673
That was no easy year, either.
I mean, there was Marciano...

315
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,116
Walcott and Charles still around.
But they had me up there, number five.

316
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,516
And Maish thought that, maybe...

317
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,271
with a little more experience<i>...</i>

318
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,430
Maish? Who<i>'</i>s Maish, Mr. Rivera?

319
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,518
He<i>'</i>s my manager.
Now, where does that leave him?

320
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,593
That<i>'</i>s a nice thing to do to a guy
who<i>'</i>s kept you going for 17 years...

321
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,513
and all of a sudden you stop cold on him.

322
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,073
It<i>'</i>s not fair to<i>...</i>

323
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,559
I<i>'</i>m sorry, Miss.

324
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,359
I shouldn<i>'</i>t have blown up like that.
But, you know, sometimes<i>...</i>

325
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,835
You should kick me out of here, Miss.
Honest, you should.

326
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,955
Well...

327
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,271
as long as we have your address
written down here...

328
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,750
- we<i>'</i>ll contact you if anything comes up.
- Sure, sure.

329
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,873
Mr. Rivera.

330
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,038
Right after the war,
I did a lot of work with...

331
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,152
disabled veterans.

332
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,789
- Go on.
- Well, I meant<i>...</i>

333
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,317
I meant you<i>'</i>d be surprised at
the different openings that come up for<i>...</i>

334
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,077
- You mean, for cripples and guys like that?
- No, I didn<i>'</i>t mean just that.

335
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,310
I meant for people
who have special problems.

336
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,235
Miss.

337
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,908
Miss, I got no special problem.

338
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,429
To you, I<i>'</i>m a big, ugly slob
and I look like a freak...

339
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,950
but I was almost
the Heavyweight Champion of the World.

340
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,592
Why don<i>'</i>t you put that down
on that paper someplace?

341
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,750
Mountain Rivera was no punk.

342
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,674
Mountain Rivera was almost
the Heavyweight Champion of the World.

343
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,394
Mr. Rivera!

344
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,109
Going down.

345
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,830
Will you stop with that <i>"</i>bum-bum<i>"</i>?
I<i>'</i>m trying to concentrate.

346
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,633
Jack of clubs.

347
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,599
Jack of clubs. Gee, the jack of clubs.

348
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,915
That<i>'</i>s what it looks like, don<i>'</i>t it?

349
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,073
Eight of hearts.

350
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,714
Eight of hearts. That<i>'</i>s good to know.

351
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,040
That is very good to know.

352
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,435
Eight of hearts. That<i>'</i>s good to know.

353
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,558
All right, stop with that,
<i>"</i>It<i>'</i>s good to know<i>."</i>

354
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,155
Everything is good to know to you.
Just play the cards.

355
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,513
I<i>'</i>m going to knock with three points.

356
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,636
You caught me with the store.

357
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,995
I<i>'</i>ve got two kings, two queens, two nines,
a jack, a ten and two fours.

358
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,238
That<i>'</i>s good to know.

359
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,156
What<i>'</i>s the matter with you?

360
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,232
He<i>'</i>s lost, Maish.

361
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,516
I don<i>'</i>t know what to do.

362
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,918
Him and me, both.

363
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,872
Except he<i>'</i>s doing it for you, Maish.

364
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,156
Everything for Maish.

365
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,354
Hello?

366
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,229
Yeah.

367
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,950
No, Perelli didn<i>'</i>t call yet.

368
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,918
Tell him to call me here. Well, I<i>'</i>m here.

369
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,875
Okay.

370
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,671
You want to lodge a complaint?

371
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,352
Perelli handles wrestlers.

372
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,715
You<i>'</i>ve got the longest nose
in the business.

373
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,518
So! So!

374
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,114
So, okay.

375
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,231
So, for kicks, Army,
we let the kid wrestle a few.

376
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,548
Not Mountain.

377
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,758
Why not? They pay good for that stuff.
Just like they pay actors.

378
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,876
We could work up a routine for him.

379
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,589
Like Gorgeous George
or that nut on the coast, the Mad Baron.

380
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,836
- What<i>'</i>s wrong with it? It<i>'</i>s money, ain<i>'</i>t it?
- Sure. What kind of money?

381
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,071
What difference does it make
what kind of money? Money<i>'</i>s money.

382
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,515
A guy like him
don<i>'</i>t take to getting laughed at.

383
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,477
What are you talking about? A guy like him?

384
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,518
What is he, a prima donna?
All of a sudden he<i>'</i>s sensitive?

385
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,591
Since when does a guy like him
get sensitive?

386
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,229
- Since we<i>'</i>ve known him!
- Then you tell me what is for Mountain.

387
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,992
Go ahead, you tell me.

388
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,238
You say he wants to help me?
Well, let him start right now.

389
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,038
But not this, Maish, not this.

390
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,509
We got no time
to give him aptitude tests, Army!

391
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,033
I<i>'</i>ve run out of time, Army.

392
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,078
I was too busy stitching him up
so he could show the next week.

393
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,559
I was on my hands and knees...

394
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,916
pleading with promoters to use him
so we could get groceries.

395
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,357
Now, I<i>'</i>ve run out of time to carry
those poor sensitive boys in my lap.

396
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,635
Maish.

397
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,789
You stink.

398
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,868
You wanna know who owes who, Army?

399
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,110
You want to know who owes who?
I<i>'</i>ll tell you.

400
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,272
Just check the records.
Look at the wins and losses.

401
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,989
Mountain comes out on the short end.
He owes me.

402
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,876
I figure it<i>'</i>s as simple as that.

403
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,314
And what am I asking him to do?
To step in front of a train?

404
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,318
I put it to you, Army,
what do I ask of this guy?

405
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,710
To stick on a costume,
make people laugh a few times?

406
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,758
What is that going to do,
curdle his sensitive insides?

407
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,757
All right, wise guy...

408
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,669
so I<i>'</i>m selling his soul on the street.

409
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,513
You weep for him.
Go light a candle for him.

410
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,029
Maish...

411
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,795
I want to say something, and I want you
to hear me good, understand?

412
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,231
I love this kid
like he was my own flesh and blood.

413
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,792
And if I don<i>'</i>t weep and worry for him,
no one else will.

414
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,553
Least of all you. Why? I don<i>'</i>t know.

415
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,989
If anything happens to him, you be careful.
You understand?

416
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,356
You just be careful, Maish.

417
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,475
Yeah?

418
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,679
Hello, Ma.

419
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,878
I<i>'</i>m right here.

420
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,032
Don<i>'</i>t worry about that.
I<i>'</i>ll have the money.

421
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,156
I know what date it is, Ma.

422
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,792
When I make a deal with Ma Greeny,
I keep it.

423
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,675
As a matter of fact, I got something...

424
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,115
Hello?

425
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,395
- Lf I would have hit him<i>...</i>
- Joe Louis would hit you with a left<i>...</i>

426
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,398
Hey, look at this.

427
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,911
- I was looking for...
- Excuse me, Miss...

428
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,470
- unescorted ladies ain<i>'</i>t permitted.
- I was looking for Lewis Rivera.

429
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,120
The man at the desk
told me I might find him here.

430
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,349
Lewis Rivera?

431
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,996
The Mountain, you mean.

432
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,069
Excuse me.

433
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,555
Hello, Mr. Rivera.

434
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,234
- Hello, Miss<i>...</i>
- Miss Miller. Grace Miller.

435
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,913
I tried to phone you.

436
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,878
- You<i>'</i>re a hard man to get hold of.
- I don<i>'</i>t know why...

437
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,396
- They told me at the desk you were here.
- I usually am.

438
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,078
Can we sit down?

439
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,074
Yeah, sure.

440
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,078
Hey, the round<i>'</i>s over.

441
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,355
- Take a rest.
- Sorry about that.

442
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,034
That goes on all the time around here.

443
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,914
Maish calls this a graveyard.

444
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,517
He says these guys
spend their time dying in here.

445
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,110
That<i>'</i>s not for you, though, Mr. Rivera.

446
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,476
I think you<i>'</i>ve got a lot of better things
in store for you.

447
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,709
I do?

448
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,237
Have you ever thought
of working with children?

449
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,999
- Children?
- Yes. You know, in athletics.

450
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,354
I never gave it much thought.

451
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,710
Well, I like kids.

452
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,549
- Yeah, I like kids all right.
- They<i>'</i>re staffing summer camps now.

453
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,439
I know a couple who run a camp
in the Adirondacks.

454
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,954
They<i>'</i>re in town now
getting their people together.

455
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,511
Would you be available if I could set up an
appointment for you to meet them tonight?

456
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,669
Tonight?

457
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,230
They have to leave town tomorrow
and I told them all about you.

458
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,715
You mean, they<i>'</i>ll have to see me?

459
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,034
You know, I just got over this fight.

460
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,950
You mean, I<i>'</i>ll have to talk to them?

461
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,749
But they<i>'</i>re excited to see you.
They<i>'</i>re looking forward to it.

462
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,115
I told them you were ranked number five.

463
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,669
You know, you<i>'</i>re a hell of a sport.

464
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,156
I mean, you coming in here.
You<i>'</i>re a real sport.

465
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,953
Thank you.

466
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,396
- Then you<i>'</i>ll see them?
- Sure, if you say so.

467
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,758
How about it, Mr. Rivera,
can I have a beer?

468
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,149
A beer?

469
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,637
- In here?
- I kind of like it in here.

470
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,958
Sure, you can have a beer.

471
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,911
- Hey, Charlie!
- Coming.

472
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,274
- Charlie. Two beers.
- Two beers.

473
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,717
- How about some music?
- Music?

474
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,151
Don<i>'</i>t you like to listen to music
when you drink beer?

475
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,074
I never gave it much thought.
Sure, you can have music.

476
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,915
Hey, Mountain.
Play <i>Lover, Come Back to Me.</i>

477
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,359
- Two beers.
- Charlie, how about a glass for the lady?

478
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,634
A glass?

479
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,192
Fancy-shmancy!

480
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,313
That<i>'</i>s pretty.

481
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,232
Yeah, it is pretty.

482
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,877
- Them are violins.
- Beautiful.

483
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,036
I don<i>'</i>t pay much attention.
I don<i>'</i>t have the time.

484
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,439
What is that?

485
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,269
That<i>'</i>s music. Just plain old music.

486
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,234
The only music I know by heart
is <i>The Star-Spangled Banner.</i>

487
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,836
- You don<i>'</i>t go much to fights, huh?
- No.

488
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,639
They play that before the main event.

489
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,836
There was Smiley Collins.

490
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,438
Who<i>'</i>s Smiley Collins?

491
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,239
He was a fighter and he played the violin.

492
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,832
A fighter playing a violin.

493
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,956
He used to play the violin? Seriously?

494
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,029
Real serious.

495
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,917
I don<i>'</i>t know about his violin playing...

496
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,675
but he had a right hand,
he could knock down a wall with it.

497
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,318
What about his violin?

498
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,111
He fought Willie Floyd,
and he had 20 pounds on him.

499
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,236
Willie Floyd had 20 pounds on him.

500
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,990
That<i>'</i>s okay, keep the change.

501
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,271
They don<i>'</i>t get many ladies in here...

502
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,318
that<i>'</i>s why Charlie forgot
to bring the glass.

503
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,039
Thank you.

504
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,994
<i>"</i>Drink hearty!<i>"</i>
That<i>'</i>s what Maish always says.

505
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,151
Drink hearty, Mr. Rivera.

506
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,435
You think a lot of Maish, don<i>'</i>t you?

507
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,799
He<i>'</i>s number one.

508
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,518
He was your manager?

509
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,553
Excuse me.

510
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,232
For 17 years.

511
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,800
He<i>'</i>s not just my manager.

512
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,512
He<i>'</i>s my best friend.

513
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,668
When we were first getting started...

514
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,196
he used to stake me to, you know,
the chow and clothes<i>...</i>

515
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,511
Why aren<i>'</i>t you married?

516
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,629
Should I be?

517
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,073
You should be.

518
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,388
You<i>'</i>re pretty.

519
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,040
You<i>'</i>re not just pretty, you<i>'</i>re beautiful.

520
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,955
Thank you.

521
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,949
You know...

522
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,191
I once fought a guy named Jazzo.

523
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,713
Elmer Jazzo.

524
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,234
You know what?

525
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,075
He looked just like my old man.

526
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,515
He was the spitting image of him.

527
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,989
So I couldn<i>'</i>t hit him.

528
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,395
So the second round, I go out
and I<i>'</i>m just jabbing away kind of easy...

529
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,671
and all of a sudden...

530
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,919
he comes at me strong.

531
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,669
He<i>'</i>s got me up against the ropes
and he<i>'</i>s giving me the elbow...

532
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,151
giving me the legs,
and he<i>'</i>s biting me, and I just cover up.

533
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,391
I notice every time he shoots his left hand,
he drops his right.

534
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,549
So I go<i>...</i>

535
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,993
I knocked him out.

536
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,235
What?

537
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,117
I knocked him out.

538
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,273
How<i>'</i>s the beer?

539
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,394
Fine.

540
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,755
Mountain.

541
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,958
Them are violins.

542
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,757
Drink hearty, Mountain.

543
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,713
Drink hearty.

544
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,918
It<i>'</i>s a garden, ain<i>'</i>t it?

545
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,439
Where are the flowers?

546
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,953
Right here.

547
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,912
I<i>'</i>ve had a real good time.

548
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,388
So have I.

549
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,911
Two beers. My!

550
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,272
When we were coming out of the bar,
I heard Charlie say...

551
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,118
that I had a pretty date.

552
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,918
Thank Charlie for me.

553
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,152
You don<i>'</i>t mind
that he thought you was my date?

554
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,796
I suppose in a way I am.

555
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,754
I don<i>'</i>t think I<i>'</i>ve had a real date
in all this time.

556
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,628
I mean, someone...

557
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,473
I liked.

558
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,198
You know...

559
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,191
someone I wanted to be with.

560
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,752
I think that<i>'</i>s a compliment.

561
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,709
Yeah.

562
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,434
I feel like I<i>'</i>m walking on eggs.

563
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,319
Why, Mountain?

564
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,028
Well...

565
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,508
you know what my old man used to say?

566
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,988
He used to say, <i>"</i>Lewis...

567
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,636
<i>"</i>when you<i>'</i>re out with a lady,
you should act special<i>."</i>

568
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,748
You have.

569
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,316
I<i>'</i>ve enjoyed this evening very much.

570
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,152
I haven<i>'</i>t talked too much, have I?

571
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,270
One thing I wouldn<i>'</i>t want to do
with a lady like you, is get out of line.

572
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,916
You<i>'</i>ve been a perfect gentleman.

573
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,914
You know what?

574
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,870
One thing I<i>'</i>m sorry about...

575
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,913
is that I don<i>'</i>t know music.

576
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,069
Why?

577
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,195
Well...

578
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,992
I feel like singing.

579
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,191
There<i>'</i>s a cab, Mountain.

580
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,828
Hey, cab!

581
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,430
I<i>'</i>ll go back to my place
and phone the Reardons...

582
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,511
and set up an appointment for you
for tonight.

583
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,989
- Then I<i>'</i>ll call you at your hotel.
- Sure, fine.

584
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,674
Hey, buddy...

585
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,195
here.

586
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,033
- No, Mountain, please.
- No, it<i>'</i>s all right, it<i>'</i>s all right.

587
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,475
You take the lady where she wants to go.

588
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,835
When you tell them about me,
don<i>'</i>t build me up too much.

589
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,439
Tell them I had 111 fights
and never took a dive.

590
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,592
I<i>'</i>m kind of proud of that.

591
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,358
Of course you are, Mountain.

592
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,192
You must be very proud.

593
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,956
You<i>'</i>re somebody very nice.

594
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,199
Thank you.

595
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,992
All right, buddy. Good night.

596
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,874
Hey, Maish, look at this.

597
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,674
Solid.

598
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,718
Where<i>'</i>s Mountain?

599
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,637
We<i>'</i>re waiting for him.

600
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,638
You know Perelli.

601
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,392
Yeah, I know him.

602
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,474
So where<i>'</i>s your boy?
I<i>'</i>ve been here a half-hour.

603
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,595
He<i>'</i>ll be here.

604
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,271
I ain<i>'</i>t got all night, Maish.

605
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,715
Maish, I got some great news.

606
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,791
The lady from the employment agency...

607
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,872
she<i>'</i>s getting an interview for me
with this guy that runs a camp.

608
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,599
That<i>'</i>s very nice,
but wait till you hear about the deal...

609
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,830
All you need to work with kids is instinct.

610
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,717
Dandy! We<i>'</i>ll talk about it after.

611
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,870
She says I got to start something new...

612
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,349
on account of I blew my wad in the ring.

613
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,000
I said, <i>"</i>What does a guy like me
know about kids?<i>"</i>

614
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,469
Mountain, I want you to meet Mr. Perelli.

615
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,120
He promotes the wrestling matches
at the Manhattan Arena.

616
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,838
- Glad to see you.
- Likewise.

617
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,150
I said, <i>"</i>What does a guy like me
know about kids?<i>"</i>

618
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,470
- She says, <i>"</i>It<i>'</i>s instinct<i>."</i>
- Let<i>'</i>s get on with it.

619
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,595
She says, <i>"</i>Instinct<i>."</i>

620
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,956
Mountain, come here. Listen to this good.
It<i>'</i>s a beautiful thing.

621
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,952
Sit down, gentlemen.

622
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,073
I think we got something.

623
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,628
Maish thinks you might be a good draw.

624
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,795
Your name<i>'</i>s pretty well-known.

625
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,236
I<i>'</i>ve seen you fight a lot myself.

626
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,232
I think I can wind you up with matches.
It might be worth both our whiles.

627
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,553
Didn<i>'</i>t Maish tell you?
I<i>'</i>m not supposed to fight no more.

628
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,428
This has nothing to do with fighting.
I told you, he promotes wrestling.

629
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,512
I don<i>'</i>t know how to wrestle.

630
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,549
He don<i>'</i>t know how to wrestle,
you get that?

631
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,597
Rivera, you don<i>'</i>t have to know how.

632
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,477
Couple of hours, you learn the holds.

633
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,516
Only two things to learn in my business:

634
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,431
How to fake it, make it look real...

635
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,715
and how to land
so you don<i>'</i>t hurt yourself.

636
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,994
I don<i>'</i>t get it.

637
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,277
What do you mean, you don<i>'</i>t get it?
He<i>'</i>s laying it out for you.

638
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,351
Maish, you know I<i>'</i>ve got a funny idea.

639
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,115
We dress you up
in one of them Indian costumes...

640
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,589
with the crazy feathers and everything.

641
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,109
Hey...

642
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,398
we give him a peace pipe,
and he<i>'</i>ll blow smoke in the referee<i>'</i>s face!

643
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,229
I got it!

644
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,988
We match him off against a cowboy.

645
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,275
You get it? Cowboys and Indians!

646
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,236
I don<i>'</i>t think he goes for it, Maish.

647
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,834
What are you talking about,
<i>"</i>He don<i>'</i>t go for it<i>"</i>?

648
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,314
What do you say?

649
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,354
Maish, I<i>'</i>d lose you a lot of money.

650
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,152
I can<i>'</i>t wrestle.

651
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,276
I don<i>'</i>t think I could win a match.

652
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,960
He couldn<i>'</i>t win a match! I<i>'</i>ll die!

653
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,315
What do you mean?
This whole thing is a setup.

654
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,789
You win one night,
the next night the other guy wins.

655
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,472
It depends on who plays the heavy.

656
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,629
Tank job.

657
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,359
Will you talk sense?
This is an entirely different thing.

658
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,113
- It<i>'</i>s part of the game.
- I never took a dive for nobody!

659
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,272
I won 111 fights.
I never took one single dive.

660
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,437
Mountain, it<i>'</i>s like Maish says.

661
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,590
These ain<i>'</i>t exactly dives.

662
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,951
You guys talk it over.

663
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,112
Give me a ring, Maish.
I got to know definitely by tomorrow.

664
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,795
- I<i>'</i>ll call you in the morning, Perelli.
- Sure.

665
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,916
Nice seeing you, Mountain.

666
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,798
I figure you owe me.

667
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,952
What do you figure?

668
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,639
I guess I do.

669
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,436
Then there<i>'</i>s no more to it.

670
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,148
Maish...

671
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,550
I was almost
the Heavyweight Champion of the World.

672
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,036
And you<i>'</i>ll remember that.

673
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,079
You were almost
Heavyweight Champion of the World...

674
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,832
and I was your manager.

675
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,516
Maish, I<i>'</i>m no stumblebum!

676
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,835
Why do you want to make me out
some kind of stumblebum?

677
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,668
Hello?

678
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,515
Yeah?

679
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,679
Who<i>'</i>s calling?

680
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,718
Yes, he<i>'</i>s here.

681
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,709
Hang on, just a minute. I<i>'</i>ll get him.

682
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,477
Hey, Mountain? It<i>'</i>s for you.

683
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,152
It<i>'</i>s a Miss Miller.

684
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,437
That<i>'</i>s the lady
from the unemployment agency.

685
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,515
Hello?

686
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,069
Hello.

687
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,469
You did?

688
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,235
They do?

689
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,398
The hotel St. Moritz?

690
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,637
I know where that is.

691
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,311
What are their names?

692
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,393
Reardon.

693
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,799
All right.

694
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,879
Miss Miller...

695
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,354
thank you.

696
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,193
Hey, Maish...

697
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,316
that appointment<i>'</i>s for tonight.

698
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,550
These people run this camp
in the Adirondacks...

699
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,316
and they want to see me.

700
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,399
Maish...

701
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,353
come on...

702
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,796
you don<i>'</i>t have to worry
about no wrestling deals no more.

703
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,316
No matter what I do,
you<i>'</i>ve still got a third of my action.

704
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,911
My son, the counsellor.

705
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:42,918
Just make sure those brats don<i>'</i>t hit you
over the head with a hockey stick.

706
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,077
Hey, I got to change.

707
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:49,153
Like you said, you, me and Army,
we<i>'</i>re the Three Musketeers.

708
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,959
He wins, I lose.

709
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,432
Go get some sandwiches.

710
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,993
You mean that, Maish?

711
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:07,237
Can I stop him if he wants
to sit around a campfire?

712
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,073
Get some sandwiches.

713
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,557
Why don<i>'</i>t you break open that jug
and we<i>'</i>ll have a couple of belts, too?

714
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,353
Have you seen Maish around, Steve?

715
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,635
He left about ten minutes ago.

716
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,077
He says, <i>"</i>I<i>'</i>m sorry, buddy,
but I don<i>'</i>t give blue stamps<i>."</i>

717
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,713
That<i>'</i>s great.

718
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,552
Look at the birthday cake.

719
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,110
The girls are having a birthday party
and I<i>'</i>ve got to play host.

720
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,430
Excuse me, please, I<i>'</i>ll be right back.

721
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,112
Come back, Jack.

722
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,390
Remember when I was 22?

723
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,750
I remember the night you were 22.

724
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,829
You fought a guy named Rocky Rocco...

725
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,831
and you took him in three rounds.

726
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,070
You were very strong that night.

727
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,871
And how about that birthday party
you gave me?

728
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,752
With the assorted friends.

729
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,955
Yeah!

730
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,272
And you gave me that tie.

731
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,915
That tie.

732
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,357
You<i>'</i>re never going to get rid
of that crummy thing, you<i>'</i>ll keep it for life.

733
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,550
That<i>'</i>s my lucky piece.

734
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,032
Those were the great days.

735
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,557
We travelled first class.

736
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,556
All the training camps were after us,
bidding for us.

737
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,517
You were on your way up.

738
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,831
Waiter! Bring us another.

739
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:55,199
Hey, look who<i>'</i>s here.
Sit down and have a drink.

740
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,314
Mountain...

741
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,433
weren<i>'</i>t you supposed to be
someplace by 10:00?

742
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,633
Didn<i>'</i>t you have an appointment
someplace?

743
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,309
10:00?

744
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,954
Oh, yeah.

745
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,990
The Reardons, at St. Moritz, that<i>'</i>s right.

746
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,308
Never mind. Forget it.

747
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,915
I<i>'</i>ll call Miss Miller and cancel
the appointment, make it for tomorrow.

748
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,799
- You are in no shape to go now.
- What do you mean?

749
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,395
- Listen to me.
- I got to go, I got an appointment.

750
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,355
Anybody ever tell you
what a prince of a guy you were?

751
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,434
Mr. Reardon...

752
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,954
there<i>'</i>s a gentleman down here.

753
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,877
Says he has an appointment with you.

754
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,439
His name is<i>...</i>

755
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,954
Rivera.

756
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,675
Rivera, sir.

757
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,398
All right, Mr. Reardon, I<i>'</i>ll send him up.

758
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,593
They<i>'</i>re expecting you, Mr. Rivera.
Room 1006.

759
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,750
Take the elevator across the lobby.

760
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,719
I<i>'</i>m going to be a counsellor
at a boys<i>'</i> camp.

761
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,151
I<i>'</i>m delighted, Mr. Rivera.

762
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,879
It<i>'</i>s a big break.

763
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,912
Going up, please.

764
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,795
Tenth floor.

765
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,189
I<i>'</i>m going to see Mr. Reardon.

766
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,432
He runs a summer camp.

767
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,351
You have any boys, lady?

768
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,237
This is my only child.

769
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,073
I like animals.

770
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,915
I like all kinds of animals.

771
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,628
Is that a dog?

772
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,429
Why certainly, she<i>'</i>s a champion.

773
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,519
Hey, you a champ?

774
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,275
Thank you.

775
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,158
Listen, I forgot something.

776
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,794
I forgot the<i>...</i>

777
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,949
Hey!

778
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,549
Mr. Reardon!

779
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,955
Mr. Reardon?

780
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,029
Yes?

781
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,195
My name is Mr. Rivera.

782
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,913
Are you Mr. Reardon?

783
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,276
No. Please, go. Get out.

784
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,431
Do you know where he lives?

785
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,473
Mr. Reardon?

786
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,028
Mr. Reardon!

787
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,271
I<i>'</i>m sorry. I<i>'</i>m sorry.

788
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,670
I couldn<i>'</i>t see where I was going.

789
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,552
I was looking for someone.

790
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,989
Mountain?

791
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,069
Down, please.

792
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,275
Mountain?

793
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,154
Mountain!

794
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,158
Come in, it ain<i>'</i>t locked.

795
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,479
Maish, is that<i>...</i>

796
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,232
Hey, Miss Miller.

797
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,598
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.

798
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,114
I tried to follow you when you left.

799
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,798
There didn<i>'</i>t seem to be much
to talk about.

800
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,314
I think there<i>'</i>s a great deal to talk about.

801
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,512
You want to come in?

802
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,748
Can I take your coat?

803
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:06,989
Thank you.

804
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,475
Why did you get drunk, Mountain?

805
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,319
Maish and me<i>...</i>

806
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,555
I guess I was kind of scared
about meeting those people.

807
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:29,510
Maish and me, we had a few,
and before you knew...

808
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,792
I was potted.

809
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,519
You<i>...</i> Sorry.

810
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,477
- Want me to run and get you a beer?
- No, thanks.

811
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,311
Can you guess who that is?

812
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,513
That<i>'</i>s me.

813
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,351
You know, Miss Miller...

814
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,829
one thing I<i>'</i>m sorry about is...

815
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,908
I didn<i>'</i>t want to make a fool out of you.

816
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,592
That<i>'</i>s not the point.

817
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,796
You lost a job tonight.

818
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,554
You threw it away, and I don<i>'</i>t know why.

819
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,914
Will you tell me?

820
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,951
I guess I realised...

821
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,195
I was just kidding myself.

822
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,718
I couldn<i>'</i>t be no counsellor. Look.

823
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,798
That<i>'</i>s my old man I was telling you about.

824
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,473
Your father?

825
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,952
He<i>'</i>s a good-looking man.

826
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,678
He was a big guy.

827
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:42,231
You know, Miss Miller,
about that counsellor job.

828
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,790
That<i>'</i>s for them good-looking kids
with white sweaters.

829
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,711
I don<i>'</i>t sound so good.

830
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:51,795
I mean...

831
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,629
I sound like an immigrant off a boat.

832
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:56,949
Anyway...

833
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,597
I already got a job.

834
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,113
You did! That<i>'</i>s wonderful!

835
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,438
I<i>'</i>m going to be a wrestler!

836
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,508
A wrestler?

837
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,717
Yeah. You know.

838
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:17,388
I put on this Indian chief costume and...

839
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:22,035
one night I win,
next night the other guy wins.

840
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,315
It<i>'</i>s like in the movies.
The good guys and the bad guys.

841
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,753
Is that what you want to do, be a wrestler?

842
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,714
I never figured to wind up like this.

843
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,191
You<i>'</i>re ashamed of it.

844
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,754
You<i>'</i>re ashamed. Then why do you do it?

845
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,470
I got to do it for Maish.

846
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,039
For Maish.

847
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,470
You do everything for Maish.

848
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,916
You keep him in a shrine.

849
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,949
For 17 years, you<i>'</i>ve prayed to him
as if he was your personal god.

850
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:03,750
And now he wants to strip off your skin
until you<i>'</i>re chewed to death!

851
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,115
It<i>'</i>s not true, you don<i>'</i>t know him like I do.

852
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,354
A long time ago, in Scranton,
I fought Marciano on his way up.

853
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,035
He was a tough kid. He cut me up bad.

854
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,236
I was out of shape and he knocked me out.

855
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:19,711
But as I was being wheeled down the hall
in the hospital, I looked up...

856
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,832
and there was Maish.

857
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,517
He was crying for me.

858
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,798
Do you hear that?

859
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,996
Maish was crying for me.

860
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,990
Because of that, you<i>'</i>ll do anything for him?

861
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,638
What<i>'</i>s so bad about it?

862
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,792
Wrestling is like fighting,
only by different rules.

863
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:40,079
Why don<i>'</i>t you see yourself as I see you?

864
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,109
Look at me.

865
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,789
Boy, am I ugly.

866
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,155
- You<i>'</i>re not ugly.
- What am I, beautiful?

867
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,028
These are scars. They ain<i>'</i>t medals.

868
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,795
You know why I talk so funny?

869
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,153
Because I<i>'</i>ve been hit a million times.

870
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,312
For a while...

871
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,789
you had me thinking...

872
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,273
it could be different.

873
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,828
But, Mountain...

874
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:16,038
I want you to believe it can be different.

875
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,829
You know...

876
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,791
the time would come when<i>...</i>

877
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,630
The time would come when<i>...</i>

878
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,630
What would you do then, Miss Miller?

879
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,951
I don<i>'</i>t know, Mountain.

880
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,559
You better go.

881
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,155
Hey!

882
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,438
Hey, Miss Miller!

883
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,032
You forgot your scarf.

884
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,189
Thank you.

885
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,040
I appreciate your trying to help me.

886
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,676
You understand that it wasn<i>'</i>t<i>...</i>

887
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,354
It wasn<i>'</i>t...

888
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,232
I was out of line.

889
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,193
I belong with dirty towels in locker rooms.

890
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,913
Oh, Mountain.

891
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,273
- Give me my key.
- Mountain<i>'</i>s already up there.

892
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:50,238
And there<i>'</i>s a girl with him. A Miss Miller.

893
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,595
Excuse me.

894
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,993
Are you Miss Miller?

895
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,395
Yes.

896
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:06,829
And you are?

897
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,553
Maish Rennick.

898
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:15,430
Do I have a fighter now
or have I got a counsellor?

899
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,755
He<i>'</i>s whatever you want him to be.

900
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:23,588
You got him drunk, and were successful.
He didn<i>'</i>t get the job.

901
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,638
That<i>'</i>s just too bad.

902
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,990
That<i>'</i>s how the world goes, honey.

903
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,719
The rich get richer and the poor get drunk.

904
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,514
Now you can go out
and find yourself another charity.

905
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,749
Charity?

906
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,038
You don<i>'</i>t give a damn about him!

907
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,348
But you do?

908
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,154
You<i>'</i>re old friends.

909
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,435
All the way back to last Tuesday.

910
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,390
Let me tell you something,
and you<i>'</i>d better dwell on this.

911
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,357
You don<i>'</i>t understand the breed.

912
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:55,194
You think when you put clothes on an ape
you make him a dancing partner.

913
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,994
I<i>'</i>m sorry.

914
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,951
You want to help him?

915
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,434
I<i>'</i>ll tell you how you can help him.

916
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,598
Leave him alone.

917
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20,115
If you got to say anything to him,
tell him you pity him.

918
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,192
Tell him you feel so sorry for him
you could cry.

919
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,952
But don<i>'</i>t con him.

920
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,476
Don<i>'</i>t tell him he can be a counsellor
in a boys<i>'</i> camp.

921
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:32,755
He<i>'</i>s been chasing ghosts so long
he<i>'</i>ll believe anything.

922
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,071
Any kind of a ghost.

923
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,112
Championship belt.

924
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,233
Pretty girl.

925
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:45,317
Maybe just 24 hours without an ache
in his body.

926
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,949
It doesn<i>'</i>t make any difference.

927
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,839
It all passed him.

928
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,871
I just thought that...

929
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:01,512
maybe the next thing he wanted,
he ought to get.

930
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,156
That would only be fair.

931
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:08,712
I wish to God it was something
I could have given him.

932
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,554
You see!

933
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,354
I<i>'</i>ll die. I swear to God, I<i>'</i>ll die.

934
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,431
He<i>'</i>ll knock them dead in that thing.

935
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,793
Where<i>'</i>s the photographer?

936
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,235
I<i>'</i>ve got to get some pictures
of him in that thing!

937
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,469
Hey, Joe!

938
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,389
Maish!

939
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,070
I hear you<i>'</i>re in action again.
Maybe we can still do some business?

940
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:12,232
I want you to meet Maish Rennick.
The wisest man in the business.

941
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,551
I heard you were looking for a fighter.
I can start anytime.

942
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,993
He<i>'</i>s anxious, it<i>'</i>s a good sign.

943
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:20,550
- Get out of here.
- All right, don<i>'</i>t get hot. Come on, kid.

944
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:24,710
I<i>'</i>ll just take my cut
when the kid starts to work, okay?

945
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,471
You don<i>'</i>t have to wear that thing long.

946
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,235
Get into the ring, walk around
a couple of times and you take it off.

947
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,995
Maish, don<i>'</i>t make me.

948
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,436
What do you mean, make you?
Am I your father?

949
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,112
You don<i>'</i>t do what you don<i>'</i>t want to.

950
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,236
If you don<i>'</i>t think you owe it to me, okay.

951
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,959
Anything he owes you,
he<i>'</i>s paid you back 100 times.

952
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,679
If he wants to walk, let him tell me.

953
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:56,272
I<i>'</i>d do anything for you, anything.
But don<i>'</i>t ask me to play a clown.

954
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,672
You cross me now and I<i>'</i>m dead.

955
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,675
Hey, Indian.

956
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,751
Come on, put on the Indian hair!

957
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,751
We<i>'</i>ll take some funny pictures.

958
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,951
I don<i>'</i>t want to be no clown!

959
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:11,912
What are you trying to pull?

960
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,672
He<i>'</i>s taking a walk, ain<i>'</i>t he?

961
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,398
What is he trying to pull?

962
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,392
You<i>'</i>re in deep trouble.

963
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,312
Ma Greeny<i>'</i>s going to know about this.

964
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,358
Will you get these guys out of here
and I<i>'</i>ll straighten it out?

965
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,557
I<i>'</i>ll get them out of here,
but you<i>'</i>d better straighten him out.

966
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:27,596
Let<i>'</i>s go, everybody, out!

967
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,716
You better take care of it.

968
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,754
You better!

969
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,669
I mean it.

970
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:37,479
My life is on the line.
You cross me now and I<i>'</i>m dead.

971
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,272
Like I told you...

972
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,390
I<i>'</i>ll do anything for you.
Anything else, but<i>...</i>

973
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,119
But it bothers you?

974
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,673
It didn<i>'</i>t bother you last week...

975
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,752
in the ring, with your hands
at your side for seven rounds...

976
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,673
and let Clay beat your brains out.
That didn<i>'</i>t bother you!

977
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:58,355
It didn<i>'</i>t bother you that I had
every last nickel I have on that table...

978
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,874
saying that you wouldn<i>'</i>t go four!

979
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:17,954
Maish...

980
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,552
you bet against me?

981
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,479
Why, Maish?

982
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,834
Why did you bet against me?

983
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,313
Would it have made any difference,
Mountain?

984
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,237
Would it have made any difference...

985
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:42,630
if I had gone out and hocked my left leg
to bet on you?

986
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,915
You<i>'</i>re not a winner anymore.

987
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:49,153
There<i>'</i>s only one thing left.
Let<i>'</i>s make some money from the losing.

988
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:01,789
You fink!

989
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,190
You dirty, stinking fink!

990
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,158
You know, Maish...

991
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,029
in all the dirty, crummy 17 years
I fought for you...

992
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,993
I wasn<i>'</i>t ashamed of one single round.

993
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,596
Not one single minute.

994
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,550
Now you make me ashamed!

995
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,151
Where are you going, Hiawatha?

996
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:14,949
Ma...

997
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,998
punchy<i>'</i>s gone wild.

998
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,239
Listen, Greeny...

999
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,788
if this punk don<i>'</i>t show,
Maish, you don<i>'</i>t get paid.

1000
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,075
That means you<i>'</i>re out in the cold, you dig?

1001
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,593
So what did you do?
You beat up two bums?

1002
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,638
That ain<i>'</i>t going to help.

1003
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,796
I got a whole regiment.

1004
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,197
And what did you win for Maish,
an extra eight minutes?

1005
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,312
Get these bums out of here.

1006
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,836
I<i>'</i>m going to see to it you don<i>'</i>t get
a license to walk a dog from now on!

1007
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,514
You don<i>'</i>t think I will? Just try me!

1008
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:46,789
Maishy, darling...

1009
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,474
take a good look at yourself
in the mirror...

1010
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,511
then say goodbye to what you see.

1011
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,319
Where do you want it, here or in the alley?

1012
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,476
Let them do it slow, Ma.

1013
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,677
Let them do it nice and slow.
I want to watch.

1014
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,318
Come on, Maish.

1015
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,953
Hey, Perelli...

1016
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,918
pay that lady off.

1017
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,430
For what? Your good looks?

1018
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:19,357
I pay cash for services rendered,
and so far you ain<i>'</i>t rendered nothing.

1019
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,073
Put me on next.

1020
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,468
You mean you<i>'</i>ll go?

1021
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,835
Eight matches, starting tonight?

1022
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:29,630
- With an option for 16 more?
- Yeah, sure. Anything you say.

1023
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,832
Makes me happy.

1024
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,358
Now everybody<i>'</i>s happy.

1025
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,596
Have a good match, boys.

1026
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,952
I owe you, Mountain.

1027
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,158
I owe you for this.

1028
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:57,792
I swear I<i>'</i>ll pay you back.

1029
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,155
We don<i>'</i>t have to break up now.

1030
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:08,079
We<i>'</i>ll get that kid.

1031
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,037
He<i>'</i>s a good, fast kid.

1032
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,838
Army, you saw him.

1033
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,828
We can make a champ out of this guy.

1034
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,759
The three of us.

1035
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,230
Be partners like we used to be.

1036
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,998
Make a lot of dough.

1037
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,757
The kid could be a champ.

1038
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,800
He could take over where you left off.

1039
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,475
Look, I like you guys.

1040
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:36,955
Mountain.

1041
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,429
Army.

1042
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:41,836
Don<i>'</i>t let it break up like this.

1043
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,112
What do you say, Mountain?

1044
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,394
Army?

1045
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,959
Mountain?

1046
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,320
<i>Next match. Two out of three falls.</i>

1047
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,550
<i>From Morrilton in Arkansas...</i>

1048
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:11,713
<i>weighing 620 pounds, Haystack Calhoun.</i>

1049
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,632
<i>And his opponent, weighing 196 pounds...</i>

1050
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:27,555
<i>former heavyweight contender,</i>
<i>Big Chief Mountain Rivera.</i>

1051
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,753
Mountain, don<i>'</i>t forget this is make-believe.
Don<i>'</i>t get carried away and belt him out.

1052
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,914
Come on, Mountain,
get this show on the road.

1053
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,513
Come on, Mountain.
