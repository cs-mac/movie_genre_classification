1
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,102
Make it a certified
check for $183.28.

2
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:32,772
$183.28? Yes.

3
00:01:33,348 --> 00:01:37,217
And make it payable to the Hartford
Wholesale Produce Company.

4
00:01:37,285 --> 00:01:38,548
The Hartford Wholesale
Produce Company.

5
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,747
Yeah.

6
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:47,554
Shoot that down to Ruth, Fred.

7
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:48,756
Okay.

8
00:01:50,098 --> 00:01:51,098
For Ruth.

9
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,534
Yeah, I know. Hey,
forward pass, frog face.

10
00:01:54,803 --> 00:01:58,240
My check book
positively says $11.21.

11
00:01:58,306 --> 00:01:59,604
You know what happens?

12
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:01,506
This check gets
thrown back in my lap.

13
00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:03,374
For five years
I do business here,

14
00:02:03,445 --> 00:02:04,879
and now I should get insulted?

15
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:07,506
You didn't make any checking
deposit last Saturday,

16
00:02:07,582 --> 00:02:08,606
only savings.

17
00:02:08,683 --> 00:02:10,879
Is that so? Well, I'm laughing.

18
00:02:10,952 --> 00:02:12,580
I was telling Mrs.
Ginsberg this morning

19
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:14,247
that someday
I'll be a millionaire

20
00:02:14,322 --> 00:02:16,348
like this Romer Sheffield.

21
00:02:18,293 --> 00:02:20,159
Goodbye, Mr. Ginsberg.

22
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:26,591
No! Oh, have a heart, Ruth.

23
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:28,466
I get no pleasure out of life.

24
00:02:28,537 --> 00:02:30,802
For the fifth time, no.

25
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:33,605
Just you and me alone.

26
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:36,573
I thought that was
coming. No, thanks.

27
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:38,170
Well, why not?

28
00:02:38,914 --> 00:02:42,476
One session of your football
technique lasts a lifetime.

29
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:45,077
You might as well
give up, frog face.

30
00:02:45,587 --> 00:02:48,682
I'm going to ask Ruth out
this Saturday myself.

31
00:02:51,593 --> 00:02:52,925
Any fleas?

32
00:02:53,495 --> 00:02:55,396
Back in your cage, gorilla!

33
00:02:55,463 --> 00:02:58,524
The girls fluttered when
he asked them to dance.

34
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:00,067
Scram, rube.

35
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:02,564
How about it, baby?

36
00:03:02,804 --> 00:03:04,204
You take a lot for granted.

37
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:06,070
It takes a lot to satisfy me.

38
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:07,734
Shall we make
a hot Saturday of it?

39
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:10,335
Well, that depends upon
the degree of heat.

40
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:12,847
You can run the temperature.
What do you say?

41
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:15,679
The whole crowd's going
out to Willow Springs.

42
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,652
Okay. I'd be bored to
death staying in town.

43
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:30,931
There you are, Eva.

44
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:33,662
Now, run along and drive your Aunt
Minnie around for her shopping.

45
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:35,397
Of course, Father.

46
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:37,796
Thanks a lot. All right.

47
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:43,703
Father, may I have the car
tonight and Saturday night?

48
00:03:47,082 --> 00:03:48,414
It doesn't seem proper for you

49
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:50,349
to take the car out
at night so much.

50
00:03:50,685 --> 00:03:52,313
It may lead to undesirable...

51
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:53,480
Why, Father.

52
00:03:53,555 --> 00:03:56,684
Undesirable gossip.
It's indiscreet.

53
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:59,319
You know I'd never do
anything unbecoming.

54
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:01,522
No, no, no, of course I...

55
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:05,999
Well, I guess
it'll be all right.

56
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:07,829
Thanks, dear. Goodbye.

57
00:04:07,902 --> 00:04:08,961
Goodbye.

58
00:04:11,206 --> 00:04:12,868
Hey, Eva!

59
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:14,773
Hello, Archie.
What's on your mind?

60
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:18,544
Well, look, Eva. Conny's taking
Ruth Saturday, isn't he?

61
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:19,808
So what?

62
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:21,975
Well, how about
you going with me?

63
00:04:22,884 --> 00:04:25,285
It's a date. Oh, that's swell.

64
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:26,987
You haven't been out
with me for a month.

65
00:04:27,055 --> 00:04:28,318
Saturday after lunch.

66
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,154
Dad's giving me the closed car.

67
00:04:30,225 --> 00:04:33,821
Better yet. My feet get cold
when I park in those roadsters.

68
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:35,191
Hey, hey.

69
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,895
And I said to the
Reverend Botts that I...

70
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:46,168
Hello, Eva. How are you, dear?

71
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,470
How do you do?

72
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:50,341
And I told the Reverend Botts
that I thought the City Council

73
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:52,176
should call on
that Romer Sheffield

74
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:53,943
and demand that he leave town.

75
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:57,176
The idea of bringing her out
here to his summer home

76
00:04:57,252 --> 00:04:58,652
and living with her openly!

77
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,313
It's a disgrace
to the community.

78
00:05:00,388 --> 00:05:01,947
You're absolutely right.

79
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,557
He's a vile influence, too. Yes.

80
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:11,489
Look!

81
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,396
Romer, look. What?

82
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:15,495
Well, we must be going.

83
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,594
Goodbye.

84
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,934
Goodbye. Bye.

85
00:05:18,406 --> 00:05:19,430
I'll only be a minute, Camille.

86
00:05:19,507 --> 00:05:21,339
All right.

87
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:32,232
Good morning, Mr. Sheffield.

88
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,327
Hello, Conny, how are you?

89
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:35,517
Just fine, thank you.
I'm pretty busy.

90
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,320
Good. Then the bank's
still solvent, eh?

91
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:38,451
Oh, yes, sir.

92
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:42,054
Yes, Mr. Smith. Yes, Mr. Smith.

93
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,497
I rechecked your
statement personally.

94
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:45,898
The balance is correct.

95
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:47,868
Good morning, Miss Brock.

96
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:49,962
Oh, good morning.

97
00:05:50,472 --> 00:05:53,704
Perhaps you failed to
deduct the government tax.

98
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:57,011
Yes, there's a two cent tax
on every check you write.

99
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:59,507
Oh, no, no,
not just for Democrats,

100
00:05:59,647 --> 00:06:01,809
the Republicans
have to pay it, too.

101
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:05,350
All right. Goodbye, Mr. Smith.

102
00:06:06,721 --> 00:06:08,383
What can I do for you,
Mr. Sheffield?

103
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:11,051
Just talk to me, will you?
I like to hear you talk.

104
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:12,719
I haven't time.

105
00:06:12,794 --> 00:06:14,228
Yes. I've noticed that.

106
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:18,796
Somehow, every time I come into the
bank you always manage to be busy.

107
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,205
You know, I think I'll
phone next time. Phone?

108
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:26,639
Well, you seemed pretty
patient with Mr. Smith.

109
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:29,469
Did you ever talk to Mr. Smith?

110
00:06:29,544 --> 00:06:31,638
No. I imagine it must
be quite an experience.

111
00:06:31,713 --> 00:06:32,874
It is.

112
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:41,687
You know, I like your hair done that way.
It's very becoming.

113
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:46,454
Did you have any
business to transact?

114
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:49,757
Come to think of it, I did. Look,
I want this check deposited.

115
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:52,266
$30,000. Checking or savings?

116
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,995
Checking, by all means.

117
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:56,765
Third window down. Mr. Billings.

118
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:59,840
Look, Miss Brock, don't you think you
could take personal charge of my account?

119
00:06:59,908 --> 00:07:00,967
Why?

120
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:05,176
Well, I'd have an excuse to become
better acquainted with you.

121
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,649
Second, I've already
mentioned your hair.

122
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:09,183
Third, you have blue eyes.

123
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,515
Fourth... Is this an inventory?

124
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:13,714
Now, look, I'm serious.
Let me go on, won't you?

125
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:15,268
I'm more interesting
when I'm serious.

126
00:07:15,857 --> 00:07:19,157
You're considered much too
dangerous for local consumption.

127
00:07:19,227 --> 00:07:20,388
I see. Ruled out, eh?

128
00:07:20,462 --> 00:07:21,657
Uh-huh.

129
00:07:22,197 --> 00:07:25,429
Well, well, Conny Billop
seems more fortunate.

130
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:31,266
Oh, I imagine he'd change
places with you most anytime.

131
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:39,214
Incidentally, it looks as
though there's a man wanted.

132
00:07:39,914 --> 00:07:41,974
I know, I know.
She's glaring in here

133
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,178
and thumping her compact on top
of the car door, isn't she?

134
00:07:44,252 --> 00:07:45,447
Yes.

135
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,182
You know, the enamel's
getting all worn off there.

136
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:50,953
I guess I'll have to go and
see what I can do about it.

137
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:54,020
Say, what's the matter?

138
00:07:54,095 --> 00:07:56,826
Does everyone in this town
have high blood pressure?

139
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:00,560
Oh!

140
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:11,076
Well, how was she today?

141
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:12,443
Purely business, my dear.

142
00:08:12,514 --> 00:08:15,575
Oh, yes? Selling short
or bulling the market?

143
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,476
I suggest we stop talking
about Wall Street, huh?

144
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,579
If you think you can
park me out here

145
00:08:20,655 --> 00:08:22,783
while you go in there and flirt
with some dizzy little bank clerk,

146
00:08:22,857 --> 00:08:24,553
you're crazy!
All right, I'm crazy.

147
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:25,685
Oh!

148
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:31,422
Did she catch
the train all right?

149
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:32,933
Yes, sir.

150
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:35,436
Good. Any parting message?
Yes, sir.

151
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:38,302
She said you could
go to the devil.

152
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:40,638
Well, that's nice of her.
Here you are.

153
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,639
Thank you, sir.
Don't mention it.

154
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,508
Did she say anything else?

155
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:47,811
Yes, sir. She said she was going
to Florida on Mr. Howard's yacht.

156
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:50,418
Good! She'll probably
get a nice coat of tan.

157
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:51,748
Yes, sir.

158
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:56,718
That'll be all, Frank.

159
00:08:58,226 --> 00:08:59,421
Nine, nine, four.

160
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:19,612
Boy, I don't know
my own strength.

161
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:20,808
Yeah?

162
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:22,883
Yeah?

163
00:09:24,152 --> 00:09:26,087
Yeah, he's here.

164
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:28,314
For you, Conny.

165
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:30,358
For me? Okay.

166
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:32,691
Hey, keep your eye
on him, will you?

167
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,059
I don't want him pushing
them in with his hand.

168
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:38,759
Yeah? Oh, hello, Mr. Sheffield.

169
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:42,266
Yeah, that landlady usually
knows where everybody is.

170
00:09:42,337 --> 00:09:44,966
Say, Conny, I've noticed your
crowd goes out to Willow Springs

171
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,166
every Saturday.

172
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,210
Yeah, that's the only excitement
there is around this burg.

173
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:51,576
Well, why don't you all drop
in here Saturday afternoon?

174
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:54,138
There's lots of drinks, and
I'll rummage up some food.

175
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:57,276
Say, that'd be swell.
You bet I'll invite them.

176
00:09:57,352 --> 00:09:58,718
That's fine.
Then I'll expect you.

177
00:09:58,786 --> 00:10:01,085
Stay as long as you like.
No limit.

178
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:02,885
All right. Goodbye.

179
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:06,755
Boy, this Saturday is going
to be some Saturday!

180
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:08,490
What's up?
That was Romer Sheffield.

181
00:10:08,563 --> 00:10:11,658
Wanted me to invite the crowd
out to his place for a party.

182
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:13,065
Well, we can't go out there.

183
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,500
The town would burn
down to the ground

184
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:16,409
if we took the girls
within a mile of that guy.

185
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:19,532
Stop griping. Nobody needs
to see where we're going.

186
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:22,338
We can take the side road up
Willow Creek into his place.

187
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,572
Well, how about the girls?
Do you think they'll go?

188
00:10:24,646 --> 00:10:26,205
Sure. They'll eat it up.

189
00:10:26,347 --> 00:10:27,940
Yeah, I know, but...

190
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:31,118
Listen, Archie. You start
griping every week

191
00:10:31,185 --> 00:10:33,211
about spending three
bucks for bootleg gin.

192
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:36,724
Here you got a swell chance to get
some real liquor for nothing.

193
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,090
Say, that is an idea, isn't it?

194
00:10:58,746 --> 00:11:01,716
Be out in a minute. I'll give
you odds it's 15 minutes.

195
00:11:01,783 --> 00:11:02,842
Fifty cents to a dollar.

196
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:03,941
Taken.

197
00:11:09,724 --> 00:11:11,784
Hello, Dad. Hello, Ruth.

198
00:11:11,859 --> 00:11:14,328
That's funny. I'd forgotten
it was Saturday.

199
00:11:14,395 --> 00:11:16,990
Until you saw this
pay envelope, eh?

200
00:11:17,398 --> 00:11:18,696
Well, what is it this time?

201
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:19,859
Well, to tell the truth,

202
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:21,401
an unusual thing
happened this morning.

203
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:23,028
I found that I'd
run out of cigars.

204
00:11:23,104 --> 00:11:26,074
You better start
smoking cigarettes.

205
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:27,969
Thanks.

206
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,008
Ruth, your mother's
on the warpath.

207
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:41,619
Ruth!

208
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:43,123
Hello, Mother.

209
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:44,853
There's moths in
this house again.

210
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:46,918
I want you to change your dress
and go up to the attic right away

211
00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:49,020
and get them blankets out of the
trunk and hang them in the sun.

212
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:50,588
And you'd better look after
the winter clothes, too.

213
00:11:50,665 --> 00:11:53,100
Mother, I can't, not now.

214
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,499
I promised to go out
with the crowd.

215
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:56,765
Well, that's no excuse when
there's work to be done.

216
00:11:56,838 --> 00:11:59,273
Well, I didn't intend it
as an excuse.

217
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:03,204
You know Saturday is the only
time I ever get to go anywhere.

218
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:06,543
I can think of lots better ways of
spending it than dancing and flirting

219
00:12:06,614 --> 00:12:07,809
till all hours of the night

220
00:12:07,882 --> 00:12:09,942
with a lot of good-for-nothing
young puppies.

221
00:12:10,017 --> 00:12:12,782
Well, I can't. Not in this town.

222
00:12:12,854 --> 00:12:15,983
You mark my words, young lady,
you'll live to regret it,

223
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:18,049
and you won't get any
sympathy from me, either.

224
00:12:19,894 --> 00:12:20,987
Iceman!

225
00:12:21,062 --> 00:12:22,724
You don't have to tell me.

226
00:12:23,498 --> 00:12:25,865
We owe him $3.43.

227
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:27,663
And the milk company
called up today.

228
00:12:27,735 --> 00:12:29,727
Yes, Mother, I know.

229
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:35,670
Where's the rest of it?

230
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:37,268
I gave $2 to father.

231
00:12:37,345 --> 00:12:38,779
Oh, you did?

232
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:42,416
Harry!

233
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:48,488
Iceman!

234
00:12:48,556 --> 00:12:51,890
Stop yelling like that
or you won't get a nickel!

235
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:55,786
Hello, Sis.

236
00:12:56,531 --> 00:12:58,227
What were you doing
in my bureau?

237
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:01,736
Who, me? Why, I wasn't
anywhere near it.

238
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:08,740
Where's that new pair
of shorts I just bought?

239
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,176
New shorts?

240
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:13,748
No, I haven't seen them.

241
00:13:16,818 --> 00:13:18,810
Hey, let go of me!
What's the idea?

242
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:20,377
Let go of me!

243
00:13:20,955 --> 00:13:22,890
Bottoms up, Mrs. Van Astorbilt.

244
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:29,559
I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it.

245
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,189
Have a heart, will you, Sis?

246
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:34,394
A brief pull, and then silence.

247
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:39,930
I didn't mean it,
I didn't mean it.

248
00:13:41,876 --> 00:13:43,742
None the worse for wear.

249
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:47,877
All right, if that's the
way you feel about it.

250
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:50,516
Nobody wears them
nowadays anyhow!

251
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:08,726
Good afternoon, Senator.

252
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:10,795
Have a cigar. Thank you.

253
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:12,352
Any mail from
the Administration?

254
00:14:12,406 --> 00:14:15,205
No, just a letter from Chicago.

255
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:18,307
That's funny. I wrote Herbert last
week about that river project.

256
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:19,677
Well, he may write
to you next week.

257
00:14:19,747 --> 00:14:21,272
He'll probably telegraph.

258
00:14:21,349 --> 00:14:22,840
That's very possible.

259
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:24,010
Have a cigar, Conny.

260
00:14:24,085 --> 00:14:25,109
Thanks.

261
00:14:25,186 --> 00:14:26,245
Thanks again, Senator.

262
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,982
Don't mention it.

263
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:31,358
You know, this public
life is very strenuous.

264
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:41,959
No wonder you smoke
so many cigars.

265
00:14:42,036 --> 00:14:43,265
Well, friends, you know.

266
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:44,396
Yes.

267
00:14:44,872 --> 00:14:46,807
Twelve minutes. Pay up, Conny.

268
00:14:46,874 --> 00:14:48,740
Right you are. Here.

269
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,006
Here you are, Dad. Better
lay in a fresh supply.

270
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,446
Thanks. Have a good time.

271
00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:56,711
The chances are in our favor.

272
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:04,189
Tell Mother I'll murder
the moths tomorrow.

273
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:32,853
Say, Ida! Where's that $2?

274
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:35,183
Wait till you hear this, Ida.

275
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:37,821
Who do you think's
getting here on the 5:15?

276
00:15:37,892 --> 00:15:39,190
Who? Bill Fadden.

277
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,888
He is? Yes. Listen.

278
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:44,465
"Looking forward to seeing
the old stamping ground again."

279
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:47,661
"Going to camp on you Saturday
night unless you lock me out."

280
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,999
"I imagine seven years
have changed Ruth a lot,"

281
00:15:52,073 --> 00:15:56,602
"but somehow I still expect to find
her in pigtails. Regards, Bill."

282
00:15:57,011 --> 00:16:00,277
Isn't that just like Bill? I
wonder if he's changed much.

283
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:02,442
It'll be fine to see him again.

284
00:16:02,984 --> 00:16:06,648
I just wish Ruth had
more friends like Bill.

285
00:16:06,754 --> 00:16:09,986
Wealthy, good family, and he's
got a fine position, too.

286
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:11,252
Mmm-hmm.

287
00:16:14,695 --> 00:16:17,688
Ruthie! Ruthie!

288
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:19,131
She's gone already.

289
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,224
She would be!

290
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:22,065
Well, she can see Bill tomorrow.

291
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:25,334
That's it, go right ahead
and stick up for her.

292
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:27,302
Where's that $2?

293
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,345
Well, I'll need that, you
know, to entertain Bill.

294
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:31,777
Oh!

295
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,279
Well, I swan!

296
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:39,383
<i>Far, far away.</i>

297
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:41,046
One minute more.

298
00:16:41,155 --> 00:16:42,748
Come on, babies, bite!

299
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:45,156
Don't you recognize caviar
when you see it?

300
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:17,625
Have another, won't you?

301
00:17:24,665 --> 00:17:25,963
Yay, the visiting firemen!

302
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:27,399
Park it in the bushes.

303
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:28,731
Hey, hide it behind the house.

304
00:17:28,803 --> 00:17:30,032
Go lay an egg!

305
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:32,198
I haven't got the strength.

306
00:17:39,814 --> 00:17:41,976
I'll go park the bus.

307
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:43,779
Hello, Ruth. Hello.

308
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:45,850
You seem to have a party going on, Mr.
Sheffield.

309
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,252
Yes, so they tell me.

310
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:49,415
Now, look, would you mind
if I do you a great favor?

311
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,391
Yes, but go on.

312
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:53,939
Well, if you'll use the word "Romer"
instead of "Mr. Sheffield,"

313
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:55,274
I'll promise to call you "Ruth."

314
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:56,558
I'm overcome!

315
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,870
Splendid! Then you need a drink.

316
00:17:57,898 --> 00:17:59,127
Come on.

317
00:18:01,168 --> 00:18:03,103
How cute! I'll take vanilla.

318
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,832
Well, vanilla it shall be, lady.

319
00:18:04,905 --> 00:18:06,203
Don't tell... Hello, everybody.

320
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:08,367
Hello, Conny. Here you are.
Thanks for organizing the party.

321
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:09,671
Why, it was no effort at all.

322
00:18:09,743 --> 00:18:11,234
They could hardly
wait till Saturday.

323
00:18:11,312 --> 00:18:13,713
One vanilla coming up
with courtly gesture, lady.

324
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:16,340
Say, this is great stuff.
Bottled in Bond, I bet.

325
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:18,750
Glad you like it, Conny.
There's a lot more.

326
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:21,448
I'm afraid you won't be
saying that by nightfall.

327
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:24,247
She isn't making much
of a play for Romer.

328
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:26,358
Well, it looks like
he's enjoying it.

329
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:30,125
Probably enjoyed
that Renault girl, too.

330
00:18:30,431 --> 00:18:32,161
Hey, One Lung.

331
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:35,465
Bringy two drinky,
very tall, savvy?

332
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:39,773
What will it be, gentlemen,
Scotch, Bourbon or Cognac?

333
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:41,675
Two Cognacs.

334
00:18:43,377 --> 00:18:45,209
Hello, Eve, have a drink?
No, thanks.

335
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,111
How they going?
Not fast enough to keep me

336
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:48,205
from dancing with you.

337
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:50,148
Let's make it later, Eve.
Ruth is waiting.

338
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:53,085
Let Ruth entertain
Romer for a few minutes.

339
00:18:53,154 --> 00:18:55,589
You didn't bring us here
to high-hat us, did you?

340
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:57,247
Don't look at it that way, Eve.

341
00:18:57,324 --> 00:18:58,792
Sure, I wanna dance
with you, but...

342
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:00,487
Well, now's your chance.

343
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:03,393
I've been wanting to thank you
for having Romer invite us here.

344
00:19:03,497 --> 00:19:04,863
I thought Archie said
you were shocked.

345
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:07,401
Well, I didn't know it was
going to be like this.

346
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:09,561
Well, what do you say?

347
00:19:09,637 --> 00:19:10,696
Okay.

348
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:12,239
Come on.

349
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:25,308
That's your boat, isn't it?

350
00:19:25,386 --> 00:19:27,514
Yes. Frank's been taking some
of the crowd for a ride.

351
00:19:27,588 --> 00:19:29,489
Like to go down and watch them?

352
00:19:29,557 --> 00:19:32,152
Yes, I'd love to. Okay, come on.

353
00:19:50,578 --> 00:19:51,705
Come on, let's walk
along the shore.

354
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:54,214
There are lots of lovely rocks
and nice little mud puddles.

355
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:55,561
That doesn't sound
very pleasant.

356
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:56,777
You must be looking for work.

357
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,978
Ah, lady, lady,
will you give me a job?

358
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:00,578
I haven't had work since...

359
00:20:00,654 --> 00:20:02,748
Since Camille left town?

360
00:20:18,372 --> 00:20:19,635
Hey, Joe, where's Ruth?

361
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:21,403
She went somewhere with Romer.

362
00:20:21,475 --> 00:20:23,876
He's got a crust dragging
her away from the party.

363
00:20:23,944 --> 00:20:25,207
Don't be a chump all your life.

364
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,838
She probably did the dragging.

365
00:20:26,914 --> 00:20:28,746
She'd ditch you
any day for Romer.

366
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:32,048
Oh, yeah? Well, I'll find
out when they get back.

367
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,351
Lovely back, darling.

368
00:20:36,624 --> 00:20:38,149
Pleasant here, isn't it?

369
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:39,420
Yes.

370
00:20:39,827 --> 00:20:41,867
It would have been a shame
for you to have missed it.

371
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:44,057
I'd begun to think you
weren't coming to the party.

372
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:46,327
Well, I've begun
to think I didn't.

373
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:51,094
There, now, you see, we'll
have to start all over again.

374
00:20:54,475 --> 00:20:56,444
Pleasant here, isn't it?
Mmm-hmm.

375
00:20:57,278 --> 00:20:58,541
How are your folks?

376
00:20:58,612 --> 00:21:00,911
Father, smoking. Mother, fuming.

377
00:21:01,882 --> 00:21:03,043
Worried about you?

378
00:21:03,117 --> 00:21:04,813
About me? Of course not.

379
00:21:05,686 --> 00:21:07,655
No, I'm supposed to
be murdering moths.

380
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:09,553
Mother hates for me not to.

381
00:21:09,623 --> 00:21:10,921
What a wise mother.

382
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:13,256
She knows what the moths
do when the flame is away.

383
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:14,620
Oh.

384
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:17,221
Does she know you're with me?

385
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:19,995
I'm with Conny. Didn't you know?

386
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:22,103
Well, all's fair, you know.

387
00:21:23,103 --> 00:21:26,073
Why, I'd murder just to see
the soft green shadows

388
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,507
through that pine tree
on your lovely hair.

389
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:32,034
A girl's pretty
helpless alone with you.

390
00:21:32,112 --> 00:21:33,273
Why?

391
00:21:33,347 --> 00:21:35,976
Nothing to resent
but compliments,

392
00:21:36,183 --> 00:21:38,914
and they're said
to paralyze a lady.

393
00:21:39,053 --> 00:21:41,784
Really? Well!

394
00:21:44,358 --> 00:21:48,193
You know, your hair is like the
sun glowing on the waters.

395
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,922
And your eyes are
like the evening skies

396
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:54,969
that send their first
stars down to lovers.

397
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:00,001
Your lovely arms...

398
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:04,510
Isn't this one feeling
just a little paralyzed?

399
00:22:04,912 --> 00:22:06,938
Goodness me, Mr. Sheffield, yes,

400
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:10,147
but I recover just like that!

401
00:22:11,452 --> 00:22:13,887
I think I'm able
to be up and about.

402
00:22:13,954 --> 00:22:15,684
In fact, I'd like
a wee cocktail.

403
00:22:15,756 --> 00:22:17,884
Please don't go so soon.

404
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,227
Well, a girl can't go on forever
calling her little policemen.

405
00:22:21,295 --> 00:22:23,992
All right, I'll promise,
so help me, to be good.

406
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:27,193
But there's the most divine little
spot further along the shore.

407
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:29,236
Let me show you it, will you?

408
00:22:29,303 --> 00:22:31,898
Promise I can have it without
a stroke of paralysis?

409
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,975
Yes, you can see it without
a stroke of any kind.

410
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:37,034
Come on, be a good winner.

411
00:22:37,378 --> 00:22:40,678
I can't resist you, except
when you're dangerous.

412
00:23:14,348 --> 00:23:15,348
Hello, Conny.

413
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:16,850
Well, it's about time
you're getting back.

414
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:19,157
I'm terribly sorry, Conny. I
guess it's entirely my fault.

415
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:20,586
Yeah, I thought it would be.

416
00:23:20,654 --> 00:23:24,352
Yes. Well, you see, we got to
talking about mutual friends.

417
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:27,654
Say, Conny, did you ever
read <i>Alice in Wonderland?</i>

418
00:23:27,728 --> 00:23:29,128
Say, what are you
trying to do, kid me?

419
00:23:29,196 --> 00:23:30,528
Hey, shake a leg!

420
00:23:30,597 --> 00:23:32,725
See you over there.
Don't fail us, Romer.

421
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,199
Has everyone gone?

422
00:23:38,272 --> 00:23:39,900
Nearly everyone. They're
over at the Springs.

423
00:23:39,973 --> 00:23:41,942
Gee, I'm sorry
they broke up so early.

424
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:43,910
They all want you
to come over there.

425
00:23:44,178 --> 00:23:47,342
No, I don't think I will.
Thanks awfully, Conny.

426
00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:51,275
Make it snappy, Ruth.
I'll go get the car.

427
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:52,717
All right.

428
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,111
I'm sorry Conny acted that way.

429
00:23:55,189 --> 00:23:57,215
I don't blame him.

430
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:06,494
Archie!

431
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:07,862
Hello.

432
00:24:10,871 --> 00:24:13,136
Well, you know, I could've
bet that this thing

433
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:16,666
wouldn't hold two quarts,
but it holds four. Look.

434
00:24:17,578 --> 00:24:18,773
Well, Archie, I'm glad
you're still here,

435
00:24:18,846 --> 00:24:20,314
because I want you
to do me a favor.

436
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,643
Oh, sure.

437
00:24:21,882 --> 00:24:23,646
Look, I can't join the
crowd over at the Springs,

438
00:24:23,717 --> 00:24:26,585
but would you mind taking these two
quarts over with my compliments?

439
00:24:26,653 --> 00:24:28,451
Sure I will.

440
00:24:28,522 --> 00:24:30,650
Well, I gotta get the car.

441
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:32,655
Gee, thanks a lot, Romer.
Don't mention it.

442
00:24:32,726 --> 00:24:34,422
It was swell. Goodbye.

443
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:35,656
Goodbye.

444
00:24:36,563 --> 00:24:38,293
So long, Ruth.

445
00:24:42,703 --> 00:24:44,228
That was awfully
decent of you, Romer.

446
00:24:44,304 --> 00:24:47,138
Sometimes I surprise
myself, really.

447
00:24:55,249 --> 00:24:56,911
So you finally got back.

448
00:24:56,984 --> 00:24:59,010
Yes. You sound surprised.

449
00:24:59,887 --> 00:25:01,583
Did you expect me
to be gone all night?

450
00:25:01,655 --> 00:25:04,056
Well, dear, I didn't know.

451
00:25:04,124 --> 00:25:06,684
You see, a girl in your
position can afford to be

452
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,730
so much more unconventional in
her pleasures than I could.

453
00:25:27,481 --> 00:25:29,177
What's the matter? Shut up!

454
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:31,343
I didn't say anything.
I know you didn't.

455
00:25:31,418 --> 00:25:33,910
Then why did you
tell me to shut up?

456
00:25:51,338 --> 00:25:53,534
Well, how do you
like my guest room?

457
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:56,133
Light, airy,
comfortable and modern.

458
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:57,871
Why look further?

459
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:01,605
I wouldn't be interested
in a short-term lease.

460
00:26:01,682 --> 00:26:03,548
Goodbye, Romer. Bye-bye.

461
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:15,923
Well, this is once you
didn't keep me waiting.

462
00:26:15,996 --> 00:26:17,555
I didn't dare.

463
00:27:17,057 --> 00:27:21,791
<i>Open all the windows
Turn the fan on, too.</i>

464
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:26,433
<i>I'm ablaze, I'm in a daze
I'm burning for you.</i>

465
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,836
<i>Call the fire engine
And the whole darn crew.</i>

466
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:36,340
<i>Tell them all to hurry
'Cause I'm burning for you.</i>

467
00:27:36,943 --> 00:27:41,278
<i>I try to cool off
But when you say no.</i>

468
00:27:41,381 --> 00:27:46,251
<i>I'm a volcano What can I do.</i>

469
00:27:46,887 --> 00:27:51,052
<i>Would you let me smother
Leave me in a stew.</i>

470
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:55,794
<i>Go on and tell your mother
That I'm burning for you.</i>

471
00:27:56,797 --> 00:28:01,360
<i>Open all the windows
Turn that fan on, too.</i>

472
00:28:01,668 --> 00:28:05,730
<i>I'm ablaze, I'm in a daze
I'm burning for you.</i>

473
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:11,410
<i>Call that fire engine
And the whole darn crew.</i>

474
00:28:11,645 --> 00:28:15,207
<i>Tell them all to hurry
'Cause I'm burning for you.</i>

475
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:20,650
<i>I try to cool off
But when you say no.</i>

476
00:28:20,721 --> 00:28:24,954
<i>I'm a volcano What can I do.</i>

477
00:28:26,293 --> 00:28:30,526
<i>Would you let me smother
Leave me in a stew.</i>

478
00:28:31,164 --> 00:28:34,999
<i>Go on and tell your mother
That I'm burning for you.</i>

479
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,774
Let's grab a boat and cool off,

480
00:28:41,842 --> 00:28:43,777
or have you run away from the
crowd enough for one day?

481
00:28:43,844 --> 00:28:46,678
Conny, why do you keep
harping on that?

482
00:28:46,747 --> 00:28:49,046
You know I'd love to
go out on the lake.

483
00:28:49,116 --> 00:28:52,951
Okay. Let's get out before somebody
else horns in on the ride.

484
00:28:56,656 --> 00:28:58,716
Conny's a fool. Why?

485
00:28:58,792 --> 00:29:00,522
Letting Ruth drag
him off outside

486
00:29:00,594 --> 00:29:03,063
just like the rest of the
fellows that chase her.

487
00:29:03,396 --> 00:29:04,989
He's no fool.

488
00:29:07,267 --> 00:29:08,496
Enjoy your ride?

489
00:29:08,568 --> 00:29:09,592
It was great.

490
00:29:14,141 --> 00:29:15,905
It's much nicer out here.

491
00:29:15,976 --> 00:29:17,342
I'll say it is.

492
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:19,436
Let's have one of
your best putt-putts.

493
00:29:19,513 --> 00:29:20,981
This is it.

494
00:29:21,081 --> 00:29:25,212
Hop right in, beautiful, and
pick yourself a nice, soft seat.

495
00:29:27,821 --> 00:29:29,619
Okay. All right.

496
00:29:45,972 --> 00:29:47,668
Please don't, Conny.

497
00:29:47,741 --> 00:29:49,334
Come on, you're too far away.

498
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:51,503
No, I'm all right where I am.

499
00:29:51,578 --> 00:29:55,208
Can't you ever enjoy a boat
ride without kissing somebody?

500
00:29:55,782 --> 00:29:57,273
Oh, all right.

501
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:08,553
Pretty cove.

502
00:30:09,596 --> 00:30:11,030
Yes, it is.

503
00:30:22,108 --> 00:30:23,633
What's the idea?

504
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,871
Why not?

505
00:30:24,945 --> 00:30:26,937
You're not going to high-hat
me all day, are you?

506
00:30:27,013 --> 00:30:28,914
Conny, be your age!

507
00:30:28,982 --> 00:30:31,508
You know I don't like
that caveman stuff.

508
00:30:31,585 --> 00:30:33,816
You'll love it, beautiful.

509
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:41,590
I came out here to cool off,
not to have a wrestling match.

510
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:45,291
I see. You like Romer's petting
better than mine, huh?

511
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:47,860
I don't like the way
your ears are put on.

512
00:30:47,934 --> 00:30:49,027
Let's go back.

513
00:30:49,102 --> 00:30:51,901
And make a sap out of me twice in one day?
Nothing doing.

514
00:30:51,972 --> 00:30:54,305
I've got a little coming to me.

515
00:30:55,876 --> 00:30:58,402
What do you expect for a
boat ride, Marlene Dietrich?

516
00:30:58,478 --> 00:31:01,880
Don't play dumb. You've been
on these parties before.

517
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,725
Conny!

518
00:31:34,347 --> 00:31:35,542
Good night, Eva. Good night.

519
00:31:35,615 --> 00:31:38,642
Good night, Archie.
Eva, Conny isn't back yet.

520
00:31:38,718 --> 00:31:40,983
Did you ever know Ruth to bring
a fellow back this early?

521
00:31:41,054 --> 00:31:42,818
Sure. Who?

522
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:44,858
Me. Oh, Archie!

523
00:32:53,994 --> 00:32:56,054
Hello. Why, hello, Ruth.

524
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:10,944
Here, take this cushion.

525
00:33:11,177 --> 00:33:13,305
I'm too tired to move.

526
00:33:14,114 --> 00:33:15,377
Come on.

527
00:33:57,957 --> 00:33:59,118
Thanks.

528
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:14,736
I suppose you're
wondering why I'm here.

529
00:34:15,241 --> 00:34:16,300
Well, you're here.

530
00:34:16,376 --> 00:34:18,971
I can't think of
anything more important.

531
00:34:21,181 --> 00:34:22,274
Ruth!

532
00:34:25,985 --> 00:34:27,112
Ruth!

533
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:34,890
Would it interest you to
know that I've wanted you

534
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:37,658
ever since I first
saw you in the bank?

535
00:34:37,764 --> 00:34:40,859
You're supposed to see
things you want in banks.

536
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:42,334
Yes, and the moment
you go to get them,

537
00:34:42,402 --> 00:34:44,769
burglar alarms start
ringing all over town.

538
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,767
May I pay you a compliment?

539
00:34:48,842 --> 00:34:50,902
No, no, not one
of those haymakers.

540
00:34:51,811 --> 00:34:54,975
It's just this.
I've known many women.

541
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:59,279
Never have I met one
so warm, so desirable

542
00:34:59,853 --> 00:35:01,287
and so unapproachable.

543
00:35:03,857 --> 00:35:06,486
You know, I surprise myself
admiring the mind in you.

544
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:08,799
You don't mind my mentioning
it since it's there, do you?

545
00:35:08,828 --> 00:35:09,852
No.

546
00:35:11,164 --> 00:35:13,395
As a matter of fact,
it all comes down to this,

547
00:35:13,466 --> 00:35:16,129
a man would have
to be very stupid

548
00:35:16,202 --> 00:35:18,364
to touch you without
first knowing your heart.

549
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,572
There, you didn't think brains
could do that for you, did you?

550
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,109
I hadn't given it much thought.

551
00:35:27,013 --> 00:35:28,948
Is Listerine good for brains?

552
00:35:29,149 --> 00:35:31,448
Love, they tell me, is better.

553
00:35:31,618 --> 00:35:33,177
If it lasts.

554
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:36,756
Well, what does it matter, so
long as one finds happiness?

555
00:35:36,823 --> 00:35:39,122
Did you ever regret being happy?

556
00:35:39,692 --> 00:35:40,751
No,

557
00:35:41,427 --> 00:35:43,396
but I would if that
happiness meant being

558
00:35:43,463 --> 00:35:46,558
sneered at and scorned
and talked about.

559
00:35:48,434 --> 00:35:51,598
You don't know what it is
to live in a small town.

560
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:54,069
You can only play
on the surface.

561
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,369
And even if you're
honest about that,

562
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:58,605
you're not safe from
a lot of evil-minded people.

563
00:36:00,146 --> 00:36:02,308
The only security in
a place like this is

564
00:36:02,382 --> 00:36:04,214
settling down
and getting married.

565
00:36:05,451 --> 00:36:07,317
Marriage, ownership.

566
00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:09,853
Dreadful thought, isn't it?

567
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:12,581
One drink for Sheffield!

568
00:36:23,536 --> 00:36:25,095
Say, tell me something.

569
00:36:25,405 --> 00:36:28,341
How can you be so morbid after
what happened last night?

570
00:36:28,408 --> 00:36:30,309
What about last night?

571
00:36:31,244 --> 00:36:34,510
Well, for heaven's sake, girl,
don't you remember where you were?

572
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:37,047
I was home in bed,
asleep at 10:00.

573
00:36:37,116 --> 00:36:40,780
No, no, no, there
must be some mistake.

574
00:36:44,691 --> 00:36:47,024
You and I were in Venice.

575
00:36:49,162 --> 00:36:53,566
And our rooms opened onto the
Gardens and the Grand Canal.

576
00:36:55,001 --> 00:36:57,994
And we watched the moon
play across the walls,

577
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:03,169
and listened to that gondolier singing
as he paddled down the canal.

578
00:37:03,243 --> 00:37:05,109
Romer,

579
00:37:05,411 --> 00:37:08,813
a check of yours for $10,000
came into the bank today,

580
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:11,214
made out to Camille Renault.

581
00:37:12,885 --> 00:37:14,444
It was torn.

582
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,455
You wanted us to put it
through, didn't you?

583
00:37:17,156 --> 00:37:18,249
Yeah.

584
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,054
You know, Ruth, you're strangely
honest, sometimes painfully so.

585
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:27,528
Will you make me a promise?

586
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,761
What is it?

587
00:37:28,835 --> 00:37:30,701
Well, if ever you find
out you're wrong about

588
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,602
what you think is
security and happiness,

589
00:37:32,672 --> 00:37:33,935
would you let me know?

590
00:37:34,007 --> 00:37:36,875
Even if I'm in Switzerland,
will you send me a cablegram?

591
00:37:36,943 --> 00:37:40,038
Well, I'm not wrong,
but I'll promise.

592
00:37:40,813 --> 00:37:42,714
Good. Let's drink to it.

593
00:37:42,782 --> 00:37:44,148
To what?

594
00:37:44,217 --> 00:37:46,186
To your being wrong.
No, thank you!

595
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,913
Somebody's coming.

596
00:37:48,988 --> 00:37:51,423
Sit still.
It's just a car passing.

597
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:07,137
Hello, Conny, I couldn't
imagine who it was.

598
00:38:07,206 --> 00:38:09,971
Yeah, I'll bet you couldn't.
Where's Ruth?

599
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,744
Why, hasn't she been with you?

600
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:15,304
Quit stalling. Now, who was the
girl I just saw go in the house?

601
00:38:15,415 --> 00:38:17,748
You know, Conny, you seem to
have an amazing curiosity.

602
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:19,843
Yeah, enough to find
out if that was Ruth.

603
00:38:21,554 --> 00:38:23,614
Don't you think it's more
agreeable here on the veranda?

604
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,124
No, I don't!

605
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:30,958
I suppose those aren't
Ruth's shoes, huh?

606
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,464
Conny, I think you
ought to go into town.

607
00:38:32,532 --> 00:38:34,558
Yeah? Well, Ruth's going
with me, you big stiff!

608
00:38:38,338 --> 00:38:40,830
You know, it's much
cooler in town.

609
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,674
You'll remember this!

610
00:38:45,745 --> 00:38:49,443
Yeah, that's right. I always
remember pleasant experiences.

611
00:38:52,185 --> 00:38:55,155
Ruth! Ruth!

612
00:38:56,622 --> 00:38:58,420
The young lady has gone, sir.
Where?

613
00:38:58,491 --> 00:39:01,586
She told Frank you wished
him to drive her home.

614
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:10,827
Frank! Wait a minute!

615
00:39:17,143 --> 00:39:18,202
You forgot these.

616
00:39:18,277 --> 00:39:19,905
Thank you.

617
00:39:20,246 --> 00:39:21,339
Good night.

618
00:39:21,414 --> 00:39:22,473
Good night.

619
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,916
Let me out at this corner.

620
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:35,220
Look.

621
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:42,767
Thank you.

622
00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:48,270
So she ditched Conny again
and went back to see Romer.

623
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:49,741
Yeah, it sure looks like it.

624
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:52,244
And afterward he sends her
into town in his car.

625
00:39:52,311 --> 00:39:54,041
Why didn't she stay all night?

626
00:39:54,113 --> 00:39:55,672
Hot potatoes!

627
00:41:03,716 --> 00:41:05,116
Who are you?

628
00:41:08,855 --> 00:41:09,879
Ruth!

629
00:41:12,592 --> 00:41:14,288
Bill Fadden!

630
00:41:16,362 --> 00:41:18,422
I can hardly believe it's you!

631
00:41:18,498 --> 00:41:20,626
It is. Are you sure?

632
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:22,862
Turn around.

633
00:41:26,806 --> 00:41:28,832
Haven't changed a bit.

634
00:41:29,742 --> 00:41:31,438
Where are your pigtails?

635
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:34,913
Well, a girl has to grow up
and bob her hair sometime.

636
00:41:36,616 --> 00:41:39,518
Well, go on, eat your pie
and tell me all about it.

637
00:41:40,052 --> 00:41:42,112
What are you doing here,
and why?

638
00:41:42,188 --> 00:41:45,056
I've got to do a geological
survey for the oil company.

639
00:41:45,124 --> 00:41:47,389
Where? Up around Black Mountain.

640
00:41:49,028 --> 00:41:51,122
I wanna pitch camp
in the old Indian cave.

641
00:41:51,197 --> 00:41:52,290
Oh.

642
00:41:52,798 --> 00:41:55,233
So you turned out
to be a geologist.

643
00:41:55,301 --> 00:41:59,636
Yeah, anticlines, fossils,
sedimentary deposits and all.

644
00:42:00,806 --> 00:42:02,297
Sounds awful!

645
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:06,335
It's a great game, Ruth, I'm out
in the field 10 months a year.

646
00:42:07,013 --> 00:42:09,141
Are you still afraid of girls?

647
00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:13,410
No. I'm not very used to them.

648
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,887
Never see any from
one month to another.

649
00:42:16,956 --> 00:42:20,017
And couldn't figure
them out if you did.

650
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:21,855
Well, anyway, I...

651
00:42:30,336 --> 00:42:32,771
I wanted to see
you again, a lot.

652
00:42:38,411 --> 00:42:39,845
Did you have
a good time tonight?

653
00:42:39,912 --> 00:42:41,175
Sure.

654
00:42:42,848 --> 00:42:44,009
Great.

655
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:45,083
Dance?

656
00:42:45,151 --> 00:42:46,380
Uh-huh.

657
00:42:46,752 --> 00:42:48,311
Your father told me they've
built a new dance hall

658
00:42:48,387 --> 00:42:49,650
right down on the lakefront.

659
00:42:49,722 --> 00:42:50,746
Yes.

660
00:42:50,823 --> 00:42:52,155
Willow Grove, or something.

661
00:42:52,224 --> 00:42:53,248
Yes.

662
00:42:53,326 --> 00:42:54,794
Now, that's too bad.

663
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,022
I guess the lake isn't
the same anymore.

664
00:42:57,096 --> 00:42:58,257
The same?

665
00:42:58,331 --> 00:43:01,563
I was just remembering how
peaceful it used to be.

666
00:43:02,868 --> 00:43:05,428
I guess you'd find
it changed, all right.

667
00:43:09,942 --> 00:43:11,672
Good night.
See you in the morning.

668
00:43:11,744 --> 00:43:13,542
See you at breakfast.

669
00:43:30,463 --> 00:43:31,624
Hello.

670
00:43:32,565 --> 00:43:34,591
Hello, Conny.

671
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:36,431
How about a date this afternoon?

672
00:43:37,203 --> 00:43:39,195
Why don't you call up Ruth?

673
00:43:39,338 --> 00:43:41,364
She ought to be
very interesting now.

674
00:43:42,642 --> 00:43:44,804
I'm fed up with her!

675
00:43:44,877 --> 00:43:48,109
Why? Because she ran out
on you again last night?

676
00:43:49,148 --> 00:43:50,411
Well, how did you know?

677
00:43:50,483 --> 00:43:53,612
Because I saw her coming home
in Romer Sheffield's car.

678
00:43:53,686 --> 00:43:55,655
You did, huh? What time?

679
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:58,256
About 2:30 this morning.

680
00:43:58,324 --> 00:43:59,883
Ruth Brock?

681
00:44:00,893 --> 00:44:02,987
What time did she leave you?

682
00:44:03,229 --> 00:44:04,595
Why, when we left the dance.

683
00:44:04,664 --> 00:44:06,428
She ducked while
I went out to get a boat.

684
00:44:06,499 --> 00:44:08,434
Why, that was only about 10:00.

685
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:10,868
Didn't she even go out
in the boat with you?

686
00:44:10,936 --> 00:44:14,964
Well, if she had, she would have
come back with me, wouldn't she?

687
00:44:16,075 --> 00:44:19,443
Then she must have been at Sheffield's
house for more than four hours.

688
00:44:19,512 --> 00:44:22,072
How awful! All right, Conny.

689
00:44:22,148 --> 00:44:25,676
Come out about 2:30 this afternoon.
Yes. Goodbye.

690
00:44:27,153 --> 00:44:28,849
Do you mean to say
that you actually saw

691
00:44:28,921 --> 00:44:30,549
Ruth Brock in
Romer Sheffield's car?

692
00:44:30,623 --> 00:44:31,955
Yes, Auntie. Isn't it terrible?

693
00:44:32,024 --> 00:44:35,756
Why, she must have been at his
house for more than four hours.

694
00:44:35,828 --> 00:44:38,263
I didn't think Ruth was
that kind of a girl.

695
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,595
I've seen it coming
for a long time.

696
00:44:40,766 --> 00:44:42,826
She's always been
encouraging men.

697
00:44:42,902 --> 00:44:44,165
Number, please.

698
00:44:44,236 --> 00:44:46,364
Hello. Hello. Matilda?

699
00:44:46,539 --> 00:44:48,872
Matilda, I've just heard
the most awful news.

700
00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:52,673
Ruth Brock was in Romer Sheffield's
house with him alone last night.

701
00:44:52,745 --> 00:44:56,876
Yes, yes, from about
10:00 until 2:30.

702
00:44:56,949 --> 00:45:01,216
And then he sent her home
to town in his car. Yes.

703
00:45:01,287 --> 00:45:04,189
Number, please. Number, please.

704
00:45:04,256 --> 00:45:05,849
Number, please.

705
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:08,755
An affair with Romer Sheffield.

706
00:45:08,828 --> 00:45:12,890
Yes, yes.
I'll call you back later.

707
00:45:13,299 --> 00:45:14,665
Number, please.

708
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:16,532
Yes, someone saw
them silhouetted

709
00:45:16,602 --> 00:45:18,901
against the curtain
of the upstairs bedroom.

710
00:45:19,071 --> 00:45:21,267
He was holding her in his arms.

711
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,900
Yes, she was there till 3:30.

712
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:25,778
Number, please.

713
00:45:25,845 --> 00:45:27,040
She spent the night with him.

714
00:45:27,113 --> 00:45:30,641
They saw her coming into town this
morning in his car, just at dawn.

715
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,309
Number, please.

716
00:45:40,526 --> 00:45:42,017
How long are you
going to be gone, Bill?

717
00:45:42,094 --> 00:45:43,357
About a week.

718
00:45:43,429 --> 00:45:46,866
I want to make some pictures and
maps and get some rock specimens.

719
00:45:46,932 --> 00:45:49,492
I wish you didn't
have to go so soon.

720
00:45:49,635 --> 00:45:51,536
It's probably just as well.

721
00:45:51,604 --> 00:45:55,132
If I didn't, I think I'd find myself
falling in love with you again.

722
00:45:55,207 --> 00:45:56,869
Again? Sure.

723
00:45:57,176 --> 00:45:59,611
When we were kids, I used
to think you were swell.

724
00:45:59,678 --> 00:46:01,112
In spite of the pigtails.

725
00:46:04,316 --> 00:46:06,649
But now you know
better, don't you?

726
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:08,745
I'm beginning to doubt it.

727
00:46:09,088 --> 00:46:10,920
I never forgot you.

728
00:46:12,525 --> 00:46:15,154
I've always remembered
you, too, Bill.

729
00:46:15,628 --> 00:46:17,995
But memories can't turn
to love in one day.

730
00:46:18,063 --> 00:46:19,861
All ready, Mr. Fadden.

731
00:46:19,932 --> 00:46:21,423
Right with you.

732
00:46:22,234 --> 00:46:25,170
Wish you could drive up and spend
an afternoon exploring with me.

733
00:46:25,237 --> 00:46:27,706
Around Black Mountain
with compass and camera.

734
00:46:27,773 --> 00:46:30,106
That's about it.
Do you think you could?

735
00:46:30,176 --> 00:46:31,804
Bill, I'm a working girl.

736
00:46:31,877 --> 00:46:33,709
But I may be able
to get a day off.

737
00:46:33,779 --> 00:46:35,543
Good. I hope so.

738
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:39,644
Headquarters, the cave.

739
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:42,045
Goodbye. Goodbye, Bill.

740
00:46:45,424 --> 00:46:46,653
Bye-bye.

741
00:47:27,433 --> 00:47:29,732
Yes, indeed, and I believe
every word of it.

742
00:47:29,802 --> 00:47:31,293
There isn't a doubt.

743
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:34,101
Mrs. Winchell, Mrs.
Starr, how do you do?

744
00:47:59,031 --> 00:48:00,829
Hello, Ruth, darling.

745
00:48:06,772 --> 00:48:10,607
Miss Brock, I've decided to
dispense with your services.

746
00:48:11,076 --> 00:48:14,342
I'm giving you two weeks'
salary in place of notice.

747
00:48:17,182 --> 00:48:18,514
But why, Mr. Randolph?

748
00:48:18,584 --> 00:48:22,544
There isn't enough work for Mr.
Franklin to need you any longer.

749
00:48:26,158 --> 00:48:28,650
That's not the reason,
Mr. Randolph.

750
00:48:28,928 --> 00:48:31,159
I've had plenty of work to do.

751
00:48:32,998 --> 00:48:34,227
What is it?

752
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,737
I don't care to argue the matter
with you, Miss Brock, except to say

753
00:48:37,803 --> 00:48:42,138
that the moral conduct of our employees
is a very important consideration.

754
00:48:42,207 --> 00:48:44,108
That's all, Miss Brock.

755
00:49:47,006 --> 00:49:48,065
Dad.

756
00:49:51,276 --> 00:49:52,710
Hello, Ruth.

757
00:49:54,246 --> 00:49:56,579
Where's Mother? Out somewhere.

758
00:50:05,758 --> 00:50:07,454
Why, what's the matter, honey?

759
00:50:07,526 --> 00:50:09,051
You've been crying.

760
00:50:10,362 --> 00:50:11,990
I just got fired.

761
00:50:15,067 --> 00:50:17,298
You did? What for?

762
00:50:19,104 --> 00:50:21,596
Well, it seems
I'm an immoral woman,

763
00:50:22,508 --> 00:50:25,876
and immoral women shouldn't
work in banks, you know.

764
00:50:26,678 --> 00:50:28,670
They might corrupt
the young dollar bills.

765
00:50:28,747 --> 00:50:31,046
Did Ned Randolph call you that?

766
00:50:33,552 --> 00:50:34,552
What are you going to do?

767
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,986
I'm going to make him
eat every word of it.

768
00:50:36,055 --> 00:50:38,354
The lying, ungrateful dog!
I gave him his...

769
00:50:38,424 --> 00:50:39,824
No, no, Dad,
it wouldn't be any use.

770
00:50:48,834 --> 00:50:52,532
So you got yourself fired from
the bank and came sneaking home.

771
00:50:52,604 --> 00:50:54,937
Bad news sure travels fast.

772
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,942
Well, what have you got
to say for yourself?

773
00:50:58,277 --> 00:51:00,109
Mother, I didn't do
anything to...

774
00:51:00,179 --> 00:51:02,444
Don't you stand there
and lie to me.

775
00:51:02,514 --> 00:51:05,040
Why, the whole town's talking
about you and sneering at you.

776
00:51:05,117 --> 00:51:07,848
I might have known you'd do
something to disgrace the family.

777
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,912
Painting your face
and staying out nights

778
00:51:09,988 --> 00:51:12,423
with a lot of rotten
young whelps!

779
00:51:12,491 --> 00:51:15,222
You would end up in a vile
affair with Romer Sheffield.

780
00:51:15,294 --> 00:51:17,534
Why, Mother, how can you say such a...
Ida, that's a lie!

781
00:51:17,596 --> 00:51:19,155
Is it? Well, ask her.

782
00:51:19,231 --> 00:51:21,757
Weren't you alone in his
house with him at night?

783
00:51:21,834 --> 00:51:23,564
Didn't his car
bring you into town?

784
00:51:23,635 --> 00:51:25,194
Yes, but I... You...

785
00:51:25,471 --> 00:51:27,633
Stop that, Ida!
Don't you try to defend her!

786
00:51:27,706 --> 00:51:29,470
All my life I've
sweated and slaved,

787
00:51:29,541 --> 00:51:31,237
trying to make a decent
woman out of her,

788
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:33,711
to give her every
advantage, and now look.

789
00:51:33,779 --> 00:51:35,714
Look how she repays me!

790
00:51:35,948 --> 00:51:37,746
How're we going to live?

791
00:51:37,816 --> 00:51:40,081
Where's the next
dollar coming from?

792
00:51:41,253 --> 00:51:43,984
So that's all I mean to you!

793
00:51:44,256 --> 00:51:48,489
You're not worried about the
scandal, it's just money!

794
00:51:48,627 --> 00:51:50,425
No one will hire me.

795
00:53:04,102 --> 00:53:05,195
Bill!

796
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,683
Ruth! Ruth!

797
00:55:10,929 --> 00:55:13,160
I'm sorry.

798
00:55:13,865 --> 00:55:16,266
You were drenched, and all in.

799
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,828
I thought that...

800
00:55:17,903 --> 00:55:20,395
You don't have
to apologize, Bill.

801
00:55:20,806 --> 00:55:24,072
You were ice-cold, and I
couldn't bring you to.

802
00:55:34,753 --> 00:55:36,847
You'd better drink this now.

803
00:55:39,024 --> 00:55:42,392
I tried to give you some
before, but it choked you.

804
00:55:51,236 --> 00:55:53,102
Are you all right now?

805
00:55:55,173 --> 00:55:58,666
But I thought I'd shake to
pieces before I got up here.

806
00:56:04,483 --> 00:56:07,453
You probably staved off
a grand case of flu.

807
00:56:19,398 --> 00:56:22,493
You shouldn't have tried
to climb in this storm.

808
00:56:23,335 --> 00:56:27,466
I didn't care about
the rain or anything.

809
00:56:28,373 --> 00:56:30,467
I just wanted to see you.

810
00:56:33,712 --> 00:56:35,203
You wanted to see me that much?

811
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,805
Yes.

812
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:39,782
Don't cry, Ruth, please.

813
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:41,479
I can't help it.

814
00:56:41,853 --> 00:56:45,153
I never wanted to see anyone
so much in all my life.

815
00:56:45,724 --> 00:56:47,784
I'm glad you feel that way.

816
00:56:47,859 --> 00:56:50,328
Ruth, it's been
the same with me.

817
00:56:51,563 --> 00:56:53,589
I'm a clumsy ox around women.

818
00:56:53,665 --> 00:56:55,861
I don't know how to say it,

819
00:56:56,968 --> 00:56:59,904
but I've been in love
with you for a long time.

820
00:57:00,105 --> 00:57:03,337
I wanted to tell you
yesterday and lost my nerve.

821
00:57:05,377 --> 00:57:08,313
Last night I couldn't
sleep thinking of you.

822
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,639
I need you, Ruth.

823
00:57:13,985 --> 00:57:17,149
Are you going to laugh at me
or marry me or cry some more?

824
00:57:20,058 --> 00:57:22,584
I'm going to do
all three at once.

825
00:57:26,631 --> 00:57:27,792
Bill.

826
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,461
Yes?

827
00:57:29,901 --> 00:57:31,961
Can we be married right away?

828
00:57:32,037 --> 00:57:34,529
Sure. We'll tell
your family tonight.

829
00:57:55,193 --> 00:57:57,662
Ruth ought to be home by now.

830
00:57:57,963 --> 00:58:00,990
I'm worried, driving
around in the rain.

831
00:58:01,132 --> 00:58:04,034
Worrying? Well, you better
stop that right now.

832
00:58:04,102 --> 00:58:07,937
I've worried all my life, and you see
all the thanks I get. I'm through.

833
00:58:08,073 --> 00:58:09,632
Annie!

834
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:12,709
Of course I love you, Bill.

835
00:58:13,078 --> 00:58:14,979
Annie, come to dinner.

836
00:58:15,046 --> 00:58:16,571
In a minute.

837
00:58:20,252 --> 00:58:22,585
You swept me off my feet

838
00:58:23,522 --> 00:58:28,017
and carried me away, swooning.

839
00:58:28,126 --> 00:58:29,526
Right now!

840
00:58:31,129 --> 00:58:33,564
Oh, all right.

841
00:58:33,632 --> 00:58:34,793
Soup's getting cold.

842
00:58:34,866 --> 00:58:36,835
Ida, Ruth'll be here
any minute now.

843
00:58:36,902 --> 00:58:39,872
Well, I'm not going to
wait dinner any longer.

844
00:58:41,773 --> 00:58:43,742
Ruth? Yes, Mother.

845
00:58:44,242 --> 00:58:46,473
Well, it's about time
you were...

846
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:54,577
Why, Bill, we didn't
expect you back so soon.

847
00:58:54,653 --> 00:58:56,281
This is a surprise.

848
00:58:56,354 --> 00:58:58,050
We've got a bigger one for you.

849
00:59:00,191 --> 00:59:02,717
Ruth and I are
going to get married.

850
00:59:05,096 --> 00:59:08,828
Bill, that's great news. I'm
tickled to death. Have a cigar.

851
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Thanks.

852
00:59:10,068 --> 00:59:13,368
Ruth, how marvelous!
And Bill! Well!

853
00:59:13,438 --> 00:59:14,497
Dad! My baby!

854
00:59:14,573 --> 00:59:16,667
We're so happy to welcome
you into the family.

855
00:59:16,741 --> 00:59:18,539
He's not in
the family yet, Mother.

856
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:21,079
Well, of course, but it won't
be long now, will it, Bill?

857
00:59:21,146 --> 00:59:23,479
Nobody has long
engagements nowadays.

858
00:59:23,548 --> 00:59:26,040
We're going to file our
application tomorrow, Mother.

859
00:59:26,117 --> 00:59:27,608
We have to wait
three days anyway,

860
00:59:27,686 --> 00:59:30,246
so Bill is going back up to the
mountain to finish up his work.

861
00:59:30,322 --> 00:59:31,346
Oh, that's fine.

862
00:59:31,423 --> 00:59:32,789
And Sunday we leave for Chicago.

863
00:59:32,857 --> 00:59:36,555
Well! Oh, Annie, Annie, come in here,
dear, and congratulate your sister.

864
00:59:36,628 --> 00:59:38,722
She's going to get married.

865
00:59:38,964 --> 00:59:40,933
To Bill? Yes, dear.

866
00:59:41,066 --> 00:59:42,591
Oh, gee!

867
00:59:42,667 --> 00:59:43,965
Annie!

868
00:59:45,103 --> 00:59:47,504
Ruth gets the best
of everything.

869
00:59:48,073 --> 00:59:50,235
Can't you wait
a little while, Bill?

870
00:59:50,308 --> 00:59:51,367
Maybe.

871
00:59:51,443 --> 00:59:53,674
Sure he will, won't you, Bill?

872
01:00:12,964 --> 01:00:14,330
Are you happy?

873
01:00:14,399 --> 01:00:17,995
So much so, I don't know what
I'd do if I ever lost you.

874
01:00:18,069 --> 01:00:19,970
You couldn't lose me.

875
01:00:21,206 --> 01:00:23,437
You talk like a little
girl afraid of the dark.

876
01:00:23,508 --> 01:00:26,910
Well, sometimes the dark can be
pretty awful when you're alone.

877
01:00:26,978 --> 01:00:28,913
You're going to be
with me from now on,

878
01:00:29,047 --> 01:00:31,016
and we're taking
tonight to celebrate.

879
01:00:31,082 --> 01:00:32,914
The world is yours.
Where do we go?

880
01:00:33,051 --> 01:00:34,917
I don't know. Anywhere.

881
01:00:38,823 --> 01:00:41,452
Say, there's some of the crowd
we went to school with.

882
01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:44,529
Bull Con, Eva, Joe!

883
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:46,928
Why, it's Bill Fadden.
Hello, Bill.

884
01:00:46,998 --> 01:00:48,330
Hi, Bill. Howdy.

885
01:00:48,433 --> 01:00:50,197
He's with Ruth. Let's go over.

886
01:00:50,268 --> 01:00:52,828
Sure. Okay. Come on, let's go.

887
01:00:53,938 --> 01:00:55,907
Wonder when he got back.

888
01:00:56,107 --> 01:00:57,473
Hello, Joe. How are you, Bill?

889
01:00:57,542 --> 01:00:58,805
Look, he's grown
out of short pants.

890
01:00:58,877 --> 01:01:00,812
What're you doing, wearing stilts?
Hello, Conny. Hello, Janet.

891
01:01:00,879 --> 01:01:03,007
Hello, Bill. Why, hello,
Eva, how are you?

892
01:01:03,081 --> 01:01:04,811
Fine, thanks. Hello, Ruth.

893
01:01:04,883 --> 01:01:08,149
My, it's nice to see you again,
Bill, after all these years.

894
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:09,380
You're handsomer than ever.

895
01:01:09,454 --> 01:01:11,685
I shaved this morning.

896
01:01:11,956 --> 01:01:13,618
We miss you at the
bank, Ruth, dear.

897
01:01:13,692 --> 01:01:15,285
You'll have to
go on missing her.

898
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,022
We're going to get
married Sunday.

899
01:01:17,095 --> 01:01:18,529
You are? Mmm-hmm.

900
01:01:21,866 --> 01:01:24,563
Well, congratulations, Ruth.
Thanks, Eva.

901
01:01:24,636 --> 01:01:26,832
Congratulations, you big
hound, stealing our prize gal.

902
01:01:26,905 --> 01:01:28,271
We all resent you, Mr. Fadden.

903
01:01:28,339 --> 01:01:29,637
I don't blame you much.

904
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:31,108
Go telephone for
the hearse, Archie,

905
01:01:31,142 --> 01:01:32,974
get the fireman's band.
We'll have a wake.

906
01:01:33,044 --> 01:01:34,603
I'll go you one
better than that.

907
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:36,671
We're going out to Willow
Springs tonight to celebrate.

908
01:01:36,748 --> 01:01:39,240
Why don't all of you join us and
we'll make a real party of it?

909
01:01:39,317 --> 01:01:40,444
How about it, Ruth?

910
01:01:41,653 --> 01:01:43,679
That'll be fine. Yes, won't it?

911
01:01:43,755 --> 01:01:45,383
What about females?

912
01:01:45,457 --> 01:01:46,720
Invite anyone you want.

913
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:47,791
The more, the merrier.

914
01:01:47,859 --> 01:01:49,725
Don't worry, we'll ring in the whole crowd.
It isn't very often

915
01:01:49,794 --> 01:01:51,763
a big butter and egg man comes
to town to give a party.

916
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:54,925
No, we've only had one,
and that was last Saturday.

917
01:01:54,999 --> 01:01:56,331
We'll try to make
this one top it.

918
01:01:56,401 --> 01:01:58,836
Goodbye. See you all about 9:00.

919
01:02:07,378 --> 01:02:09,506
So she hooked Bill Fadden, huh?

920
01:02:09,581 --> 01:02:11,345
Isn't that just lovely.

921
01:02:12,283 --> 01:02:13,876
You know who we'll
invite, don't you?

922
01:02:13,952 --> 01:02:15,215
Who?

923
01:02:15,286 --> 01:02:17,448
Sheffield.
Conny, you're a genius!

924
01:02:17,522 --> 01:02:20,981
No, I just want to see a few
people fall over backward.

925
01:02:47,619 --> 01:02:49,349
Say, when's this
surprise coming off?

926
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:51,048
Don't get excited.
It'll be here.

927
01:02:51,122 --> 01:02:52,715
Just keep your eye on the door.

928
01:02:52,791 --> 01:02:55,090
It better be good. It will be.

929
01:02:56,694 --> 01:02:59,220
I wish we could dance
every dance together, Bill.

930
01:02:59,297 --> 01:03:00,321
So do I.

931
01:03:00,398 --> 01:03:02,924
Catch up a little on the
seven years I've missed.

932
01:03:03,234 --> 01:03:05,114
I hate to think of all the
times you've been here

933
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:07,105
dancing in some other
fellow's arms.

934
01:03:07,272 --> 01:03:08,433
Jealous?

935
01:03:08,573 --> 01:03:09,666
Who wouldn't be?

936
01:03:09,741 --> 01:03:10,800
Oh.

937
01:03:12,844 --> 01:03:14,870
Hello, lovebirds,
having a good time?

938
01:03:14,946 --> 01:03:16,244
We're not exactly bored.

939
01:03:16,314 --> 01:03:18,909
Don't forget. Bill, the next
dance is mine. I won't.

940
01:03:18,983 --> 01:03:20,246
You're at Willow Springs,
you know, Bill.

941
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:22,719
You have to take your
girl for a boat ride.

942
01:03:22,787 --> 01:03:24,221
Is that the custom?

943
01:03:24,289 --> 01:03:26,258
That's a very old custom.

944
01:03:29,794 --> 01:03:31,228
Is that true?

945
01:03:31,296 --> 01:03:33,390
Why, he's exaggerating.

946
01:03:33,865 --> 01:03:35,595
Have you gone riding much?

947
01:03:35,667 --> 01:03:37,795
Why, of course, lots of times.

948
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:40,495
Why?

949
01:03:40,638 --> 01:03:42,163
Nothing, I guess.

950
01:04:15,473 --> 01:04:17,339
Look, there's Romer.

951
01:04:20,945 --> 01:04:22,538
That's him, all right.

952
01:04:22,614 --> 01:04:24,583
So that's what Conny had
up his sleeve!

953
01:04:24,649 --> 01:04:26,709
Well, I think
it's a dirty trick.

954
01:04:26,784 --> 01:04:28,377
You said it.

955
01:04:29,721 --> 01:04:31,019
Where's Miss Randolph's table?

956
01:04:31,089 --> 01:04:32,557
She's with a party
at the end table.

957
01:04:32,624 --> 01:04:34,024
Thanks.

958
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:40,323
Look.

959
01:04:40,632 --> 01:04:41,930
Hello, Romer.

960
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,628
Hello, there. It looks
like a good party.

961
01:04:43,701 --> 01:04:45,602
It will be from now on.

962
01:04:45,737 --> 01:04:48,002
Where's Ruth?
She's dancing somewhere.

963
01:04:48,072 --> 01:04:49,165
Yeah?

964
01:05:05,657 --> 01:05:07,455
What's the matter?

965
01:05:07,525 --> 01:05:08,925
Nothing.

966
01:05:12,697 --> 01:05:16,361
Bill, let's slip away from
the crowd and get a boat.

967
01:05:16,567 --> 01:05:17,933
Now? Yes.

968
01:05:18,036 --> 01:05:20,596
We've got to dance with
the others sometime.

969
01:05:20,672 --> 01:05:22,698
Well, we can do it later.

970
01:05:24,642 --> 01:05:27,635
I want to be alone with you
for some of the evening.

971
01:05:27,712 --> 01:05:31,706
All right, honey, we'll duck out
as soon as we finish this dance.

972
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:41,121
Hello, Ruth. May I cut in?

973
01:05:41,326 --> 01:05:45,263
Bill, this is Mr. Sheffield.

974
01:05:45,596 --> 01:05:47,963
Mr. Fadden, my fiancé.

975
01:05:51,669 --> 01:05:53,729
Mr. Fadden, my congratulations.

976
01:05:53,805 --> 01:05:55,273
Thank you.

977
01:05:56,274 --> 01:05:58,243
May I finish this dance?

978
01:06:00,044 --> 01:06:01,706
Certainly. Thanks.

979
01:06:20,832 --> 01:06:23,461
Well, there's not much
to say, is there?

980
01:06:23,534 --> 01:06:24,661
No.

981
01:06:27,005 --> 01:06:29,770
Well, I've never lied to you, so
I'm not going to congratulate you

982
01:06:29,841 --> 01:06:32,470
or wish you happiness,
just good luck.

983
01:06:33,244 --> 01:06:34,610
Thank you.

984
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:38,149
Seems like a fine fellow.

985
01:06:38,216 --> 01:06:39,741
Yes, he is.

986
01:06:42,453 --> 01:06:44,081
You know, I wouldn't
have come if I'd known.

987
01:06:44,155 --> 01:06:46,556
Eva didn't say
anything about it.

988
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:48,358
Eva invited you here?

989
01:06:48,426 --> 01:06:49,553
Yes.

990
01:06:55,833 --> 01:07:00,601
You know, when I came here tonight I didn't
think our first dance would be our last.

991
01:07:01,105 --> 01:07:02,937
I hope it's a long one.

992
01:07:10,648 --> 01:07:12,617
Well, you see it wasn't.

993
01:07:13,484 --> 01:07:14,782
Do you mind if I leave you here?

994
01:07:14,852 --> 01:07:16,616
Aren't you coming
back to the table?

995
01:07:16,687 --> 01:07:19,054
No, thanks. I think I'll just
step out of the picture.

996
01:07:19,123 --> 01:07:21,957
I've caused you enough
embarrassment already.

997
01:07:22,026 --> 01:07:23,426
You're very kind.

998
01:07:23,694 --> 01:07:26,596
You shouldn't say that.
It hurts my vanity.

999
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:30,660
Hi, Archie.

1000
01:07:30,768 --> 01:07:32,396
So Romer was your surprise?

1001
01:07:32,537 --> 01:07:35,302
Yeah. Did you see Ruth's
face when she spotted him?

1002
01:07:35,373 --> 01:07:36,966
She pushed Bill
all over the floor

1003
01:07:37,041 --> 01:07:38,600
trying to keep them
from meeting.

1004
01:07:38,676 --> 01:07:41,077
Yeah, I saw it, you heel!

1005
01:07:41,145 --> 01:07:43,410
For two cents I'd push your
face down into your neck!

1006
01:07:43,481 --> 01:07:44,481
You don't like it?

1007
01:07:44,549 --> 01:07:45,642
No, I don't like it.

1008
01:07:45,716 --> 01:07:47,776
Ruth's had enough trouble,
getting fired from the bank

1009
01:07:47,852 --> 01:07:49,616
and having the whole
town on her neck.

1010
01:07:49,687 --> 01:07:50,882
Give her a break.

1011
01:07:50,955 --> 01:07:52,685
She's engaged to be married.

1012
01:07:52,824 --> 01:07:54,520
Why should you try
and bust it up?

1013
01:07:54,592 --> 01:07:57,027
Somebody ought
to do the sap a favor

1014
01:07:57,095 --> 01:07:59,223
and tell him he's getting
a second-hand bargain.

1015
01:07:59,297 --> 01:08:02,961
I still hope that someday I'll
have to pay for that cablegram.

1016
01:08:03,101 --> 01:08:04,262
Goodbye, Romer.

1017
01:08:04,335 --> 01:08:07,066
No, not goodbye.
I hate goodbyes.

1018
01:08:14,479 --> 01:08:17,176
What's the matter?
Did he see me coming?

1019
01:08:17,548 --> 01:08:18,948
What do you mean, Bill?

1020
01:08:19,016 --> 01:08:21,679
Afraid of my finding out
about you two?

1021
01:08:24,655 --> 01:08:26,123
There's nothing
to find out, Bill.

1022
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:28,785
Except that you got fired from
the bank on account of him.

1023
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:30,260
Why did you lie to me
if it wasn't true?

1024
01:08:30,328 --> 01:08:32,456
Why were you anxious to leave the
dance when you saw him coming?

1025
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:34,658
Well, I was panicky, Bill.

1026
01:08:35,233 --> 01:08:37,259
I didn't want to see him.

1027
01:08:37,502 --> 01:08:39,494
I was afraid that
you would find out

1028
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:41,539
the things that people
are saying about us

1029
01:08:41,606 --> 01:08:42,767
and believe them.

1030
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,708
If it wasn't true, what did
you have to be afraid of?

1031
01:08:45,776 --> 01:08:48,302
I was afraid of
losing you, Bill,

1032
01:08:48,379 --> 01:08:50,939
and the only happiness
I've ever known.

1033
01:08:51,015 --> 01:08:52,574
So you tried to
rush our marriage.

1034
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:55,279
Even your family tried to hurry
us before I could find out.

1035
01:08:55,353 --> 01:08:57,618
And you expect me
to believe you!

1036
01:08:57,688 --> 01:09:00,180
No, Bill, you've
got to understand!

1037
01:09:21,846 --> 01:09:23,542
Romer!

1038
01:09:33,624 --> 01:09:35,855
I can't understand
their being out all night.

1039
01:09:35,927 --> 01:09:37,953
Well, thank heavens,
she'll soon be married

1040
01:09:38,029 --> 01:09:40,965
and all this worrying
will be over with.

1041
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:42,531
Why, Bill!

1042
01:09:43,134 --> 01:09:45,094
Will you ask Ruth if I can see her?
Well, what's...

1043
01:09:45,136 --> 01:09:46,365
Why, what's the matter, Bill?

1044
01:09:46,437 --> 01:09:48,065
We quarreled last night,

1045
01:09:48,139 --> 01:09:49,471
and I want to talk to her.

1046
01:09:49,607 --> 01:09:50,939
Tell her I've got
to talk to her.

1047
01:09:51,008 --> 01:09:53,910
Well, Bill,
she hasn't come down yet.

1048
01:09:53,978 --> 01:09:57,813
I don't know, maybe
she's still asleep.

1049
01:09:58,049 --> 01:10:00,883
But I tell you, Bill, sit down here,
and I'll go right up and see.

1050
01:10:00,952 --> 01:10:02,443
Give him a cup of coffee, Pa.

1051
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,749
Sure.

1052
01:10:08,759 --> 01:10:11,160
Hello, Mother. Where's Father?

1053
01:10:11,229 --> 01:10:12,356
What are you trying to do,

1054
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:14,058
throw away your only
chance of getting married?

1055
01:10:14,131 --> 01:10:16,430
Coming in at this time of the
morning in an outfit like that!

1056
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,763
Are you insane?

1057
01:10:17,835 --> 01:10:19,804
I'm sane for the
first time in my life.

1058
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:21,110
Now, Bill Fadden's in that room.

1059
01:10:21,172 --> 01:10:23,004
You get upstairs and change
your clothes in a hurry.

1060
01:10:23,074 --> 01:10:24,804
You can do your
explaining later.

1061
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:28,243
I'll do all the explaining
I'm going to do right now.

1062
01:10:31,482 --> 01:10:32,677
Well, Bill?

1063
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:35,549
Ruth, I was a fool to say
those things last night.

1064
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:36,883
It doesn't matter, now.

1065
01:10:37,021 --> 01:10:38,284
Yes, it does.

1066
01:10:38,356 --> 01:10:41,053
We can't let a quarrel like
that stop our marriage.

1067
01:10:41,125 --> 01:10:43,856
We'll be happy.
You've got to forgive me.

1068
01:10:44,962 --> 01:10:48,023
It isn't a case of my
forgiving you now, Bill.

1069
01:10:48,833 --> 01:10:52,133
The things you believed
of me last night were lies,

1070
01:10:53,271 --> 01:10:55,763
but this morning
they're the truth.

1071
01:10:58,876 --> 01:11:01,368
I spent last night
at Romer's house.

1072
01:11:02,647 --> 01:11:05,310
And you couldn't forgive
that, could you?

1073
01:11:09,687 --> 01:11:11,883
No, I didn't think you could.

1074
01:11:13,224 --> 01:11:14,556
Never mind, Dad.

1075
01:11:14,692 --> 01:11:16,058
I only came back to say goodbye.

1076
01:11:16,127 --> 01:11:18,119
Why, where are you going?

1077
01:11:18,195 --> 01:11:20,824
I don't know,
but I'll write, Mother.

1078
01:11:22,266 --> 01:11:23,700
Goodbye, Dad.

1079
01:11:44,755 --> 01:11:46,246
Where to, Romer?

1080
01:11:46,324 --> 01:11:47,485
New York.

1081
01:11:50,695 --> 01:11:52,425
I owe a minister a bet there.

1082
01:11:52,496 --> 01:11:53,862
What about?

1083
01:11:54,198 --> 01:11:58,135
Well, he bet that someday I'd meet
a girl I'd never want to lose

1084
01:11:58,469 --> 01:12:00,370
and that he'd marry us.

1085
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,476
Say, did anyone ever tell
you that your hair is...

1086
01:12:11,549 --> 01:12:13,017
Is beautiful?
