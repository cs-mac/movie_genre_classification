Screenplay & Direction
HONG Sangsoo

16
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,524
It's a wise choice.

17
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,216
And it's cheaper here.

18
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:59,592
It's good to get back to the guitar.
You played bass, didn't you?

19
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,598
It's beautiful.

20
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:08,904
Your exams are over.
Let's go walking in the mountains.

21
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:12,202
Walking?
I don't know.

22
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,404
Keep me posted.

23
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,616
That's typical.

24
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,320
Just say you don't want to come!

25
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,217
Instead of dodging the issue.

26
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,820
It's not that.

27
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,290
Let's go then.
ls walking fun?

28
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,697
Forget it. We'll see.

29
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,096
It's not like before.

30
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:43,605
You see too many unemployed people,
it's not nice.

31
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,300
Which way are you going?

32
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,212
That way.

33
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,312
Okay.

34
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,319
- It's too much.
- Take it.

35
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,488
You're having a tough year.

36
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,294
See you at mom's on Sunday.

37
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,299
Thanks!

38
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,406
Take care!

39
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,511
I made a detour
to avoid going with my brother.

40
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,726
He had given me 200,000 won.

41
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,793
For once, I was planning

42
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,489
to spend it all.

43
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,822
Do you work here?

44
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,188
Yes, it's my uncle's shop.

45
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,386


46
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,087
How long has it been?

47
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,800
It's been two years, hasn't it?

48
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:23,199
I'm so happy to see you!

49
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,910
You don't go to school anymore?

50
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:34,308
No.
I'll study again later.

51
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,920
You haven't changed.
Still good-looking.

52
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,289
I have to go back in.

53
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,297
Go on then.

54
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:56,101
What about you?
What are you doing?

55
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:00,200
What if I invited you
to a nice restaurant?

56
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,608
To celebrate our reunion.

57
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:07,309
You're serious? I finish at seven.
Does that suit you?

58
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:13,513
You'll come back?
You can?

59
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:19,890
Sure.
You work that late?

60
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,893
I'm paid to.

61
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,818
I wasn't sure I wanted to wait.

62
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,821
I decided to take a walk,
I'd see later.

63
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:09,938
THE MOTHER

64
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,786
We haven't eaten for two days.

65
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,488
Will you give me rice for my son?

66
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,100
You again!

67
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,204
When you beg, be polite
and don't stir up trouble!

68
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,307
Take this.

69
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,806
Thank you. Thank you.

70
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:46,974
Chansong, it's rice. Eat it.

71
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:55,017
I want some sugared water.
Keep the rice for yourself.

72
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,891
I'm not hungry. Eat.

73
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:10,503
Chansong!
What's the matter?

74
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,506
- Mom!
- What?

75
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,907
Mom! I want sugared water.

76
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,307
Here.

77
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,317
What's wrong, my baby?

78
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,115
My son is sick.
My son is sick.

79
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,519
It's typhus!

80
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:31,095
Chansong, say: mom.

81
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,595
Say: mom!

82
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:42,396
Mom!

83
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:06,191
Yongsil had waited for me.

84
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,595
We decided to go to a bar
instead of going to eat.

85
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,406
I felt like smoking.
I bought some cigarettes.

86
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:34,824
Personally...l didn't think
I'd see you again, Sangwon.

87
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,689
Me neither.

88
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,795
It's so strange and unexpected.

89
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:48,895
Are you mad at me?
Are you mad at me, Sangwon?

90
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,907
Answer. Tell me the truth.

91
00:08:55,535 --> 00:09:00,211
Give that back, it's my glass.
Drink from your own.

92
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,613
Stop it.

93
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,591
We had realized one day
we were drawn to each other.

94
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,895
But things weren't possible
between us.

95
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:24,206
She was going out
with one of my friends,

96
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,402
so I gave her up.

97
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,119
We'll end up doing something stupid.

98
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:43,694
Do you want me...
to be your mistress?

99
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,794
Very funny!

100
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,200
Don't laugh, please.

101
00:09:55,027 --> 00:10:02,002
Sangwon!
Do you want me to be your mistress?

102
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:23,948
Later, if we live apart
if, when I think of the past

103
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:36,227
I can still tell myself that it was love
That will be enough for me

104
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,113
Now I know
a love that is too deep

105
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:52,992
Comes to an unhappy end

106
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:59,001
I shall pray, my love
for my next love

107
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:05,167
To be different from ours
And so know no suffering

108
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,417
We had obtained permission
to stay out all night.

109
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:23,994
I was embarrassed to hear Yongsil
lie so well on the phone.

110
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,393
Personally, I probably overdid it.

111
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,000
Where shall we go?
Do you want to go home?

112
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,902
I don't feel like it.

113
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,612
But you can if you want.

114
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,818
We decided not to go home.

115
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,622
Do you feel ill?
Are you okay? Do you feel ill?

116
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,093
I think I'm going to die.

117
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,899
Are you okay?
Do you want me to hold you?

118
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,099
Yes, please.

119
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:31,594
Let go of me, I'll do it...
I'll do it.

120
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,998
Sangwon...

121
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,906
Me too...

122
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,096
You're hurting me.

123
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,399
Sorry...

124
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,894
You've had enough, I'm sorry.

125
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:41,988
Why insist when it doesn't work?

126
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,809
I feel good.

127
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,004
Stay like that.

128
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,611
You're tired.

129
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,413
Why did you leave high school?

130
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,214
My teacher was a pervert.

131
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,892
Always feeling me up...

132
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:22,805
I see.
How long have you been working?

133
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,205
I couldn't go on doing nothing.

134
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:31,205
But I'll resume my studies.

135
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:36,309
I'll get my credits transferred.
I'll learn Japanese.

136
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,914
I'd like to live in Japan.

137
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,096
Come here.

138
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,215
Wiped out by exhaustion,

139
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,714
I had a strange dream.

140
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,291
While looking for the toilets,
I reached a landing.

141
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,815
Do you want an apple?

142
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,694
When I woke, I tried again.

143
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:03,500
- You're hurting me.
- Sorry.

144
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,722
You're fed up?

145
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:26,694
No.
But why do you insist?

146
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:35,902
I'd like to die.
End with a flourish.

147
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,300
Dying would be good.

148
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,613
Why do you want to die?

149
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:53,622
I don't know... No reason.
I really want to die.

150
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,191
Me too, I want to die.

151
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,899
Are you serious?

152
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:12,005
Me too, I want to die.
Let's die together.

153
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:21,513
Let's die clean,
let's not make love.

154
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,412
All right...

155
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,498
Enjoy it.

156
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,309
It's delicious.

157
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,503
It is.

158
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,905
Do you want...?

159
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,007
What for?

160
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,011
If you want to write something.

161
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,088
What are you going to write?

162
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,901
I'll say it all before I die.

163
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:51,201
I'll dry my hair.

164
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:19,692
They counted two nights
instead of a day and a half.

165
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,295
We went to several pharmacies

166
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,093
to buy 80 sleeping pills.

167
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,100
You want a coffee?

168
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,503
No, I'm just putting the coins in.

169
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,110
It will make someone happy.

170
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,003
What a nice smell of coffee!

171
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,610


172
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,386
I wanted to be honest with Yongsil.

173
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,913
Wait!

174
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,604
I wanted to throw myself
on the tracks.

175
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:41,789
On our way back up,
I told her: let's die together.

176
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,395
You cry, then you laugh, stupid.

177
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,015
I've never been up there.

178
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:40,923
Some other time.

179
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,905
- Marlboro reds.
- I don't have foreign brands.

180
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:13,621
- No Marlboro reds?
- No.

181
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,494
Some "885" then,

182
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,397
- soju and some dried squid.
- All right.

183
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,809
What are you doing?

184
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,393
I wanted Marlboro reds.

185
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,091
Too bad.

186
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:10,808
They're divided up.

187
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,311
That's a lot of pills.

188
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:18,619
Yongsil, let's not make love.

189
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,425
We won't go to bed.

190
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,083
You're right.

191
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:26,991
I'll go and wash.

192
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,495
Okay.

193
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,610
We wanted to be clean to die.

194
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:54,715
While waiting,
I almost took all the pills.

195
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,597
- Take your shower.
- Yes.

196
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:31,193
I was afraid she would take
all the pills in my absence.

197
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:41,897
What?

198
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,405
- Nothing.
- You want something?

199
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,406
Dry your hair.

200
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,516
Oh, it's snowing...

201
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,320
It's snowing!

202
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,116
It is?

203
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,088
What a coincidence.

204
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:07,696
Is it pretty?

205
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,897
It's pretty.
Very pretty.

206
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,805
I'll look later.

207
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:48,504
She was really
going to die with me.

208
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,804
Hello.

209
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,409
Sangwon has had an accident.

210
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,603
We're in Namsan.

211
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:13,113
Hello? I can't hear you.
What did you say?

212
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:18,916
Sangwon has had an accident?
What kind of accident?

213
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:25,892
An accident.
He's lying here...

214
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:29,794
Come quickly.

215
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:34,893
Where is he?
Where are you?

216
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,097
In Namsan.

217
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,608
She had woken,
she had gone home.

218
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:59,292
She used my cell phone
to alert my family.

219
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:42,503
Sangwon.
Sangwon, wake up.

220
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,707
Wake up!

221
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:54,215
What happened?

222
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,420
Sangwon!

223
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:16,686
CLINIC

224
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,685
Sleep.

225
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,597
You need it. Are you in pain?

226
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:44,700
A little. It's okay.

227
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:52,405
Sir...
Or should I call you father?

228
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,505
What?

229
00:33:56,134 --> 00:34:01,413
What are you talking about?

230
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,315
I'm going for a cigarette.
I'll come back.

231
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,389
Excuse me.

232
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,311
Have I been asleep long?

233
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:40,014
Two hours or so.

234
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,021
Don't talk.

235
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:49,897
I would have liked
to impress the nurse.

236
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,695
Since I was going to live,

237
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:56,203
I'd have liked to find
a girl like her.

238
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,608
Can we remove the IV?

239
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:05,407
Sorry? No.
Wait a little.

240
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,413
You're too impatient.

241
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:20,093
I was worried about
the reception I was going to get.

242
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,788
We'll take a cab.

243
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:31,601
I looked around for Yongsil.

244
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,387
I felt
as if I was starting a new life.

245
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,897
A gift that had been given to me.

246
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:11,307
Who did you want to die with?

247
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,709
A girl, huh?

248
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,315
You need a girl for that too?

249
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,318
It's not that.

250
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:37,402
- Give it to me.
- It's okay.

251
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,008
If you want. Be careful.

252
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,808
So you wanted to kill yourself!

253
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:48,008
Think you're capable of it?

254
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,312
What kind of stupid act is this?

255
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:55,220
Drop dead! Why have you
come back? You're just a clown!

256
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,589
I apologize, mom.

257
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,793
But let me give you my reasons.

258
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:05,992
Your reasons?

259
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:10,196
You have reasons?
Explain!

260
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,509
I...

261
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:20,912
I've always found it hard
communicating with you.

262
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,415
You know that.

263
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,320
For nineteen years now,

264
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:31,291
I've felt you don't understand me.

265
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,396
What a pretty speech! Shut up!

266
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:37,692
I'm hard to communicate with?

267
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:41,201
I've always given you
what you wanted.

268
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,601
And now it's all my fault?

269
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:48,199
He's not entirely wrong.
You can be difficult.

270
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,312
What the hell do you know?

271
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:55,608
You blame your mother
and you call yourself a man?

272
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,515
I killed myself raising you

273
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,521
and you insult me, you little shit!

274
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:04,684
You say it's because of me
that you want to die?

275
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:08,490
So die! Why have you come back?

276
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,098
Mom.

277
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:13,498
Can't you let me speak?

278
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:21,801
I understand.
I fucking understand!

279
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:27,812
I'm going to kill myself for real.

280
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:29,212


281
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,711
I may as well kill myself!

282
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,118
Goddam maniac!

283
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,225
Be polite with mom.

284
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,486
Stay out of this.

285
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,994
Sit down.

286
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,908
Nobody cared.

287
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:49,794
Mom! Mom!

288
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:16,992
I got the letter this morning too.

289
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,991
Is it that serious?

290
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:26,192
He won't last much longer.
There's no hope.

291
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:31,397
His old classmates are meeting tonight
to do a collection.

292
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:36,205
It's to help his family.

293
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,906
Besides, it's a long time
since we last saw you.

294
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,313
Come tonight.

295
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:48,516
Actually, I wanted to see his retrospective.
I'm at the cinema.

296
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:52,389
Really?
I'm thinking of going too.

297
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,689
They're showing all his films?

298
00:40:54,819 --> 00:41:00,895
Three shorts and a feature.
It ends tomorrow.

299
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:06,600
I won't be able to go.
We'll expect you tonight.

300
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:15,411
I have a lot to do,
but I'll come if I can.

301
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:21,319
Thanks for calling me.
Are you well?

302
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:23,789
Me? I'm fine.

303
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:30,495
Right, I'll be going now.

304
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:43,935
YI HYONG SU
RETROSPECTIVE

305
00:42:56,273 --> 00:43:01,722
The hospital and operation costs
have reached one hundred million won...

306
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:05,716
Thank you in advance
for your generosity...

307
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,391
Such details are obscene.

308
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,718
What are you doing here?

309
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:38,190
And you? It's been ages.

310
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,997
You came to see the film,
so did I.

311
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,896


312
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:49,095
You're looking better, healthier.

313
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,600
Marlboro reds?

314
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:58,004
Like in the film?

315
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:01,514
From time to time.

316
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:06,019
Let me have one.
I've always been tempted.

317
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:14,289
Did you see the film?

318
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:19,595
I'd seen it before.
This was the second time.

319
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,202
His films are good.

320
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:24,604
It's charming...

321
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:29,001
Are you coming tonight?

322
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:34,207
I'm not sure.
What should I do?

323
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:42,417
I'm having lunch
with my wife and children.

324
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:43,991
Want to come?

325
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:50,087
- To have lunch?
- Join us, have you eaten?

326
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,100
It's just that...
I have so many people to see.

327
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,294


328
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:58,103
Let's go.

329
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:03,607
How many children?

330
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:06,408
- Two.
- That's good.

331
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:18,383
You can eat a whole portion?

332
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:23,191
- Sure! You bet we can!
- Yes, we can.

333
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,199
Two portions of shrimp then.

334
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:29,099
Two shrimps,
one sweet-and-sour pork,

335
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,207
three noodles.

336
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:36,209
- What an appetite...
- They love shrimps.

337
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,904
You don't want any noodles?

338
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,915
No. We'll see later.

339
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:50,587
- Don't smoke.
- I'm not smoking.

340
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,498
You came to see his film.

341
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:01,193
You were close to him,
weren't you?

342
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:07,898
At university, yes.
But I'd stopped seeing him.

343
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,409
You have things in common.

344
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:11,706
Such as?

345
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:18,013
You act cool,
you love women.

346
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:21,919
Your film would have been
in the same vein, right? Come on...

347
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:29,293
In any case, I've never eaten a beef rib

348
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,990
as good as the one at your place.

349
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,999
A beef rib?

350
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:38,800
- Yes...That was years ago.
- You remember that?

351
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:41,603
It's kind of you to remember.

352
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,609


353
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:47,910
It was really good.

354
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:51,417
The meat melted in your mouth.

355
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:59,087
Do you remember how many times
you complimented your wife?

356
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:00,991
Complimented my wife?

357
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:03,394
You did that?

358
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,399
Six times.
I remember counting.

359
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:08,696
You complimented her six times.

360
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,298
You remember such odd things!

361
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:18,909
I'd never heard anyone
make compliments about food.

362
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:46,699
Mom, I think I have a fever.
I feel cold.

363
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,504
Really? Let me see.

364
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,510
You're hot.

365
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:55,606
Perhaps it's indigestion.
Do you feel cold?

366
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:56,911
What's wrong?

367
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,920
She says she feels cold.
Let's go home.

368
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:04,983
Come here.

369
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,186
There's no need.

370
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:11,390
She's cold.
Feel better?

371
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:12,192
Yes.

372
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:22,609
Thank you. Where are you going?
I'm going home before the meeting.

373
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,407
Want a ride?

374
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:28,414
I haven't made my mind up yet.

375
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:31,815
Get in. I'll drop you off somewhere.

376
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:36,413
- It's at six?
- Yes. Come. They'll all be there.

377
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,885
I like the color of your car.

378
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:41,687
Get in, it's cold.

379
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,401
Thanks.

380
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:33,715
- How do you feel?
- It hurts.

381
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:36,909
We'll soon be home.

382
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:52,894
Can I smoke?

383
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:57,199
Wait a bit.
Because of the children.

384
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,807
All right.

385
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,814
Can you drop me here?

386
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:22,945
- Here? Why?
- No reason. I have to...

387
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,294
- Let me out here.
- All right.

388
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:41,812
Thank you.

389
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,188
I'd let you keep it,

390
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:52,293
but my mother bought it for me.

391
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,394
Sorry.

392
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,588
Bye.

393
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,892
It was good to see you.

394
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:01,400
Okay. Close the door.
Hurry!

395
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,704
I'll close the door.

396
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,093
It's visible all over the city.

397
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:58,893
You're beautiful! Hurry, hurry.
Just a second, please.

398
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:02,588
- What's your name?
- Kanghi.

399
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,198
- Kanghi?
- Yes.

400
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:09,600
You're really beautiful!

401
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:12,104
- Really!
- Thank you.

402
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:18,703
We're big fans! Goodbye.

403
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:37,682
Good bye.

404
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,088
Hello.

405
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:43,097
Hello.

406
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,093
Are you on a pilgrimage?

407
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:53,698
I'm sorry? What do you mean?
Do we know each other?

408
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:58,506
Who doesn't know Choe Yongsil?
I admire you.

409
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:04,617
I'm not a star.
Thank you anyway.

410
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:10,687
We just saw the same film.
Are you returning to the locations?

411
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:13,693
You're so classy.

412
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,491
What makes you say that?

413
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,896
I went to the same film school
as the director.

414
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,901
He spoke about you.
I know things about you.

415
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:25,905
I could even have gone on the set.

416
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:29,602
- Are you going to Namsan next?
- To Namsan?

417
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:34,115
No.

418
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:38,515
Talking of Namsan, is that where

419
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:41,213
his classmates are meeting?

420
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:47,590
Will you be there?
Why?

421
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:52,996
I've been asked
to contribute to the collection.

422
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:57,503
I'd like to go,
but I may not be able to.

423
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,403
I understand.

424
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,204
What about you?

425
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:09,614
I ought to go, but...
not everyone there likes me.

426
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:15,121
I see.
Are you a director too?

427
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,883
Yes, how did you know?

428
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:20,793
You were at the same school.

429
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:26,094
Be in my film when I shoot it.

430
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:27,895
I'm serious.

431
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:33,303
If you were to accept,
that would be a big help.

432
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:38,411
Why not?
Send me the screenplay.

433
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,913
All right.

434
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:43,916
Can I have your address?

435
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,722
I'm not sure.
I don't know you.

436
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:56,786
If I see you this evening, perhaps...
I prefer that.

437
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:02,795
If you want.
Let's shake hands.

438
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:07,504
All right.
Like in the film?

439
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:55,437
We shall not leave in the loved one's
heart nothing but light memories

440
00:56:56,713 --> 00:57:02,391
Now I know
A love that is too deep

441
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:10,519
Comes to an unhappy end
I shall pray, my love

442
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,586
- Here you are.
- It's been ages.

443
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:37,288
Hello.

444
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:41,195
- Sit down here.
- Thanks.

445
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,901
It's really been ages.

446
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,405
You're late.

447
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:50,102
I walked
from the top of the hill.

448
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,509
Really? Why?

449
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:58,313
No reason.
I've lost my wallet. I'm broke.

450
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,512
What about your credit card?

451
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,816
I'm beyond my credit limit.

452
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:05,786
You'll never change.

453
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:11,192
Sorry about earlier. You understand,
it's a gift from my mother.

454
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,598
I didn't know if we'd meet again.

455
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:17,603
That's all right. Forget it.

456
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,799
Vice-chairman,
how much must we donate?

457
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:24,400
I've lost my wallet,
I'm a bit short.

458
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:29,210
Give what you can.
Go ahead. Whatever you can spare.

459
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:34,413
- Here. It's not much.
- Thank you.

460
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:37,491
Do you still drink as much?

461
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:43,496
No, I don't drink anymore.
I have to think of my health.

462
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:47,500
I'm getting older.
I met some people up there,

463
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:50,195
but I didn't drink.

464
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:56,902
You're right, you're no spring chicken.
But you're looking better.

465
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:00,405
I don't like drinking anymore.

466
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,916
Have a glass anyway.

467
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,417
Thank you.

468
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:20,192
Don't get drunk, please.

469
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:28,407
What's your problem?
What's the matter?

470
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:32,502
- It's been ages, hasn't it?
- Stop it!

471
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:36,606
Muscular. Do you work out?
You're muscular.

472
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:43,384
Tongsu! If you plan to get drunk,
say so. Understand?

473
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:48,689
I understand.

474
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:52,288
- I think I've walked too much.
- Have some meat.

475
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,596
Thank you.

476
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:58,001
It looks good.

477
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:06,611
Enjoy it.

478
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:51,481
Miss Choe Yongsil! Good evening.
You're so beautiful!

479
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:53,491
Good evening.

480
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:58,497
How do you do?

481
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:18,010
- What do you want me to sing?
- "If I loved again.", please

482
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:38,103
My name is Choe Yongsil.
I'm an actress.

483
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:49,106
Your older colleague Yi Hyongsu...
Some here are the same age...

484
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:54,517
He allowed me
to make my film debut.

485
01:01:54,644 --> 01:02:00,993
I haven't seen him for a long time.

486
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:05,395
It's his fault as much as mine.

487
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:08,593
But, at this moment in time,

488
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:13,003
I feel as if it's my fault.

489
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:19,603
Mr. Yi, I'm really,
really sorry.

490
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:30,939
We shall make no promises
Even if we part

491
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:39,814
We'll be able to move away from each other
Without too much pain

492
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:49,724
We shall not leave In the loved one's heart
Nothing but light memories easy to cast aside

493
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:59,718
Now I know
A love that is too deep

494
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:07,842
Comes to an unhappy end
I shall pray, my love

495
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:17,318
For my next love to be different
from ours and so know no suffering

496
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:28,709
We're all fans of yours.

497
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:31,216
Thank you for coming.

498
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,410
Thank you.

499
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:35,113
Would you do a commercial for me?

500
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:36,882
I'd be delighted.

501
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,584
- Wonderful! It's been a pleasure.
- For me too.

502
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:42,093
Don't look down on serials.

503
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:46,598
I don't look down on anything.

504
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:48,099
Go back inside.

505
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:50,397
- Take care.
- Goodbye.

506
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:02,607
Where are you going?

507
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:09,512
You scared me.
Where have you been?

508
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:16,389
No reason to be scared.
I was the one who chose the song.

509
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,590
I know.

510
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,502
Where are you going?

511
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,002
Me?

512
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:33,012
I'm going to Kyonghi University Hospital.
To see Yi.

513
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:35,115
I see.

514
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,715
Can you visit this late?

515
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:40,718
I don't know.

516
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:44,882
I'll see.
They're saying it's serious.

517
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:48,689
I must go too.
Shall I come with you?

518
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,090
I'm going alone.

519
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:56,795
- Stay with your friends.
- That's not important.

520
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:10,016
What's the matter?
You're a strange guy.

521
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:18,185
Is it tough being an actress?
Can I tell you about my idea?

522
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:27,200
No. The taxi is here.
Go back in.

523
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:52,893
I didn't know you had a limp.

524
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:55,894
What? You didn't?

525
01:05:56,819 --> 01:06:02,098
Don't talk rubbish.
Has she left?

526
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:05,501
She's really pretty.

527
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:10,407
- She's a good actress. Too bad.
- What?

528
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:18,013
Nobody offers her anything
since her accident.

529
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:21,112
What accident?

530
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:25,191
She had a friend. An artist.

531
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:30,195
When she tried to leave him,
he attacked her.

532
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,593
Is that true?

533
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:35,601
She's covered with scars.

534
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:39,901
She's had several operations
in the USA.

535
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:43,203
But she still has some,

536
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:47,803
especially in intimate places.

537
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,507
Really?

538
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:52,312
What places?

539
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:55,217
How should I know?

540
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:59,486
In certain places...
Intimate places.

541
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:01,288
Give me a cigarette.

542
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,403
You never noticed I limped?

543
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:48,299
I find you everywhere I go!

544
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:55,605
Yes. I'm broke.
I've lost my wallet.

545
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,019
That's a nuisance.

546
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:02,418
I have some cigarettes left
and enough for the subway.

547
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:07,292
Do you want me
to lend you some money?

548
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:11,193
That would be kind.

549
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:20,105
No, forget it.

550
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:26,009
Actually, my heart has a problem.

551
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,809
Buy me a drink instead.

552
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,818
Your heart has a problem?

553
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:40,087
Yes. Yongsil...
you look like an angel...

554
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:51,801
You're laughing?

555
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:55,704
You're saying that
because of that angel statue.

556
01:08:55,831 --> 01:09:00,905
No,
you're my feminine ideal.

557
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:10,438
You're repeating yourself.
It made me cry.

558
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:16,997
You can tell, can't you?

559
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:22,000
Yes, I can.
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.

560
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,897
Come with me, then.

561
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:32,010
It seems
that Yi's condition is serious.

562
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:33,511
What can we do?

563
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:37,718
Did the doctor tell you?

564
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:43,483
Yes, the one treating him.
It's what he implies.

565
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:46,889
Today's dawn could be his last.

566
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,795
I feel so sorry for him.

567
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,099
Today's dawn?

568
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:59,099
Come over here
to smoke a cigarette.

569
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,903
Well, all right.

570
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:28,199
Why did you keep your name
in the film?

571
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:29,997
Was it Yi's idea?

572
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:38,210
For a short film, it didn't matter.

573
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:41,110
Really?

574
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:45,208
Yi himself performed in the film.

575
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:51,087
While we were shooting it,
everyone had a good time.

576
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:53,784
Were you dating each other?

577
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,088
No...

578
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:02,498
He's the one who gave me my start.

579
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:05,003
I'm grateful to him for that.

580
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:10,907
Thanks to that, I've appeared
in some quality productions.

581
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:12,205
Yeah

582
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:23,589
I was shooting my second film,

583
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:31,712
when he called me. And...
he said...l had made a lot of money.

584
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:37,202
That I had succeeded thanks to him.
He was asking me for money.

585
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:41,101
It's tough being an actress!

586
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:50,907
He was preying on your pity.
How much did he want?

587
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:57,685
He talked about a loan
but wanted me to give it to him.

588
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:01,192
20 million won.

589
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:09,995
That's what he wanted.
I hesitated for a few days.

590
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:17,601
He called me back, we saw each other.
He apologized, in tears.

591
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:24,708
He was really crying.
He said he had been drinking.

592
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:31,985
All the same,
I never felt like seeing him again.

593
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:35,584
I see.

594
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:40,596
I have to tell you...

595
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:44,899
That film tells my story.

596
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:49,703
I had told it to him
as a secret.

597
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:56,215
I can't forgive him
for having made it public.

598
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:05,089
I'm shocked. It was your story?
What part? All of it?

599
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:12,598
All of it. Going to a hotel to die.

600
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:15,600
Sharing out the pills one by one.
I told him everything.

601
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:20,400
Even the snow before the suicide,
the Marlboro reds

602
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:22,304
that I couldn't find. All that.

603
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:30,406
I like the bit with the Marlboros.
You told him all that?

604
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:34,213
Not exactly,

605
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:39,383
but, back then,
he saw me smoking them all the time.

606
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,590
Really?

607
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:51,894
When you're part of a filmmaker's entourage,
you tend to think like that.

608
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:57,807
As soon as you spot a coincidence,
you think it's because of you.

609
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:01,608
We all think
the world revolves around us.

610
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:08,519
But does all that really matter now?

611
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:09,987
Does it matter?

612
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:23,303
Tongsu.

613
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:26,895
I was just telling you all that.

614
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,915
What are we going to do?

615
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:43,888
We've had too much to drink.

616
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:51,188
Do you really bear a grudge
against Yi?

617
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:57,293
He was a big influence on me.

618
01:14:57,426 --> 01:15:01,602
He did everything
I'd have liked to do.

619
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:06,509
I was jealous.
He was excessively proud,

620
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:12,017
although he had no reason to be.
I'm as good as him.

621
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:15,417
He acted like my mentor
and wanted me

622
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:21,495
to recognize him as such.
No way! I didn't like that.

623
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:28,495
Don't get angry.
Don't hate him.

624
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:31,901
He's dying.

625
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:35,406
So are we.

626
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:40,412
You're exaggerating.
I don't like that.

627
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:43,707
All right.

628
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:54,087
I'm too fond of drinking.
Life is too tough. It's too...

629
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:14,104
Sorry.

630
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,617
I love you.

631
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:23,689
Do you mean it?

632
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:31,890
You're talking rubbish.

633
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:44,005
- You're forgetting your change.
- Yes.

634
01:16:44,132 --> 01:16:45,702
Good bye.

635
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:48,815
Thank you.

636
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:55,115
- That was delicious. Thank you.
- You're welcome...

637
01:16:57,412 --> 01:17:00,791
Wrap up warmly.

638
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:06,294
I'm drunk.

639
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:24,015
Be careful.
Are you okay?

640
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:29,723
I don't feel good.

641
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:33,593
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

642
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:38,591
How dare you touch me?

643
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,700
It will be all right...

644
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:52,707
You're hurting me.

645
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:57,112
There's nothing special
about an actress, you know.

646
01:17:57,239 --> 01:18:00,914
She's a woman like any other.

647
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:07,085
I know.
I love you.

648
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:09,252
- Is that true?
- That's good.

649
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:22,408
I love you so much.

650
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:25,102
Is that true? You like it?

651
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:28,011
Yes.

652
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:34,416
I'd like to come.
I'd really like to come.

653
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,420
I love you.

654
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:40,987
Make me come.

655
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:46,797
- No... stop it.
- I'm sorry?

656
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:49,198
Stop it.

657
01:18:51,927 --> 01:18:52,997
I love you.

658
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:58,202
Stop it.
Stop it.

659
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:06,612
Stop it.

660
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:31,006
What?
Why are you looking at me?

661
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:35,604
No reason.
You don't have any scars.

662
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:39,312
Scars?

663
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,921
I was told you had scars.

664
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:45,081
Who told you that?
I have scars?

665
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:53,213
I can't tell you.
Wait.

666
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:57,101
Wait.

667
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:06,503
Something wrong?

668
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:12,017
Why are you leaving?
What have I done?

669
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:16,680
Nothing. You haven't done anything.
Why?

670
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,689
No reason.

671
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,992
What if we died?

672
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:32,504
If you want, before dying,
we could live another six months!

673
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:35,699
We'd love each other intensely.

674
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:40,106
Enough.

675
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:47,413
Are you going to stay?
I'm leaving.

676
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:49,522
Don't go.

677
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:52,682
I'd like to rest a little longer.

678
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:56,387
I have to leave.
I need to go somewhere.

679
01:20:56,518 --> 01:21:00,591
But will you come back?

680
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:04,693
Come back. Please.

681
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,804
I'll see.
Go on, sleep.

682
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:12,002
Excuse me, but...

683
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:16,411
Leave me something
that I can keep.

684
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,818
Something...?

685
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:38,002
I don't think
you really understood the film.

686
01:22:55,036 --> 01:22:56,606
Did you sleep well?

687
01:22:57,138 --> 01:23:02,816
I didn't sleep.
I'm coming to see the patient.

688
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:07,186
It's true...
You didn't know I was here.

689
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,989
Did you spend the night here?

690
01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:18,198
Yes. His condition has improved.
The crisis is over.

691
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:22,399
Really?
That's good.

692
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:25,905
But it could start again.

693
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:34,409
I have to go.
Go on.

694
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:38,583
- Wait.
- What?

695
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:42,593
You must be tired,
but give me a second.

696
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:48,590
I'm worn out.
I haven't slept.

697
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:55,699
You had a good time,
so that's enough now!

698
01:24:11,112 --> 01:24:14,787
Go home. Rest.

699
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:51,688
It'll be all right.
What can I do?

700
01:24:56,024 --> 01:25:00,905
Tell me, how are you?

701
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:16,221
How...
What are you doing here?

702
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:24,892
It's tough. It hurts too much.
I think I'm going to die.

703
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:35,001
It'll be all right.
What can I do?

704
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:41,809
I don't want to die.
I really don't.

705
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:50,581
It hurts. I don't want to die.
I really don't.

706
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:58,187
Don't say that! Don't say that!
You're not going to die, trust me.

707
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:10,099
I'm sorry,
it's my fault.

708
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:14,712
Don't die!

709
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:25,238
Tongsu, I don't want to die.
I want to live.

710
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:33,588
I want to live.
I don't want to die.

711
01:26:33,721 --> 01:26:36,497
Don't.

712
01:26:36,624 --> 01:26:40,595
You're not going to die, trust me.

713
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:07,598
I need to think now.
Thinking is necessary.

714
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:12,700
With thought,
I can sort everything out.

715
01:27:12,827 --> 01:27:19,005
And even stop smoking.
I have to think.

716
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:22,410
To get out of all this.

717
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:25,108
To live a long time.
