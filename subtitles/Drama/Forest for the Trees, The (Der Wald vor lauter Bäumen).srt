1
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:27,290
I didn't do it!

2
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:30,376
It's Mr. Lee. He killed him.

3
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:33,879
You have to trust me.

4
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:36,590
I know.

5
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:47,452
Are you saying he gave you a dead phone
and told you to throw it in the water?

6
00:00:47,476 --> 00:00:49,579
"This is the real one.
Put it somewhere at the scene."

7
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:51,564
Are you saying Mr. Lee did that?

8
00:00:58,195 --> 00:00:59,280
Hey.

9
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:03,909
Do you think I wanted to do this?

10
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:07,431
Think about how having to do this
must've made me feel.

11
00:01:07,455 --> 00:01:09,999
I was frustrated to death.

12
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:14,170
What's the evidence that can prove
that Mr. Lee is the culprit?

13
00:01:14,587 --> 00:01:15,671
Can't you tell?

14
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:17,673
Is such a thing necessary between us?

15
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:21,010
Hey, Mr. Hwang. Si-mok!

16
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:24,698
Let's be honest with each other
for once as man to man.

17
00:01:24,722 --> 00:01:28,535
Until when do we have to betray our gut
feelings because of reasons and evidence?

18
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:31,937
Be honest. I know you've also pegged him
as the culprit. Aren't I right?

19
00:01:32,313 --> 00:01:34,625
You're being beyond ridiculous.

20
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:35,650
What?

21
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,004
You're making such a claim
without any evidence. How ridiculous.

22
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:40,547
This is all your fault.

23
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:43,949
None of this would've happened had you not
mentioned Kyung-wan Park knowing the girl!

24
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:46,979
Goodness. Even my ears are ashamed
from what you just said.

25
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:50,182
Cut it out. I guess you like being manly.

26
00:01:50,206 --> 00:01:52,267
- Be a real man and come with us.
- Let go.

27
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,626
Enough is enough.

28
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:55,753
Was Jin-seob Kang not enough for you?

29
00:01:56,462 --> 00:01:58,732
What would've happened
had we not caught you here?

30
00:01:58,756 --> 00:02:00,925
Kyung-wan would surely end up
going to jail.

31
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,595
As a psycho who killed his dad
and stabbed a girl, blinded by jealousy.

32
00:02:05,554 --> 00:02:07,848
Stabbing flesh isn't
the only form of killing.

33
00:02:08,474 --> 00:02:12,311
If you hadn't been caught, you would've
ended up killing Kyung-wan's future.

34
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:17,566
- Prosecutor Seo?
- Is it the room with the light on?

35
00:02:23,155 --> 00:02:24,155
What the...

36
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,992
Well...

37
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,584
What's going on?

38
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:41,632
Gosh.

39
00:02:47,888 --> 00:02:50,242
This can't be happening.
We might be screwed.

40
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,851
I'll talk to Chief first.

41
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:54,895
That girl keeps causing trouble.

42
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
Let go!

43
00:03:15,332 --> 00:03:16,500
Will you be okay by yourself?

44
00:03:17,918 --> 00:03:20,421
- Please take care of that.
- I'll go right away.

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,855
Please put the seat belt on.

46
00:04:00,711 --> 00:04:02,880
Mr. Lee will figure out the reason.

47
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:06,008
I had to do all this very quickly.

48
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:09,261
After that, he'll kill me.

49
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:12,723
Just like what he did to Mr. Park
and to that girl.

50
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:16,328
With me gone, there will be no one left
that remembers how corrupt he actually is.

51
00:04:16,352 --> 00:04:19,032
He can be reborn as an honorable
prosecutor who's always been noble.

52
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,792
You're right.

53
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:22,816
You little...

54
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:27,422
That's why I tried to frame Kyung-wan Park
as the culprit. I wanted to end it.

55
00:04:27,446 --> 00:04:29,716
Mr. Lee would end it
if the culprit has been caught.

56
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,827
I was just trying
to prevent additional murders.

57
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:34,577
I see.

58
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:37,832
Hey.

59
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,686
You know that my mother lives alone
in the countryside, right?

60
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,272
I've been her everything her whole life.

61
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:47,550
She won't want to go on with her life
if something happens to me.

62
00:04:51,262 --> 00:04:52,304
Hey, then let's do this.

63
00:04:52,888 --> 00:04:56,326
You want to catch the culprit, right?
Let's do it together. I'll help you.

64
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,537
After that, I'll gladly accept
any disciplinary action.

65
00:04:58,561 --> 00:05:01,105
Let's please keep it from Mr. Lee, okay?

66
00:05:02,022 --> 00:05:05,585
Will he harm you
if this gets reported to him?

67
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:08,880
Yes. You need to tell
that female cop about it too so that...

68
00:05:08,904 --> 00:05:10,281
If you get harmed too,

69
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:13,284
we can be sure that he's the real culprit.

70
00:05:13,826 --> 00:05:15,586
Please become a sacrificial victim
this time.

71
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:18,872
Sacrifice your life so that
we can catch the culprit.

72
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:21,959
Your sacrificial lamb was Kyung-wan,

73
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:24,795
and mine will be yours.

74
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,673
You piece of...

75
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:31,719
Hey, how dare you. You...

76
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:40,185
Damn it!

77
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:47,877
What is this bullshit right now?

78
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:48,944
APPROVAL REQUIRED

79
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,966
I was going to meet up with her
if I got a call from her.

80
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,990
I was going to report everything to you
after that.

81
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:58,412
Sir, I wouldn't have brought the phone
with me had I known she got abducted.

82
00:05:58,537 --> 00:06:01,182
The incident broke out, and I thought
people would be suspicious of me.

83
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:03,310
I just missed the right moment
to tell you about it.

84
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:04,644
Yes, this is all my fault.

85
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:07,689
However, I went to that house today
to inspect the scene.

86
00:06:07,713 --> 00:06:09,357
I swear, I didn't have
any ulterior motive.

87
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:11,526
Guys from Yongsan Police Station came

88
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,654
because Mr. Seo told them
that Kyung-wan Park...

89
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:16,805
could've hidden the victim's phone
at the scene.

90
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:19,075
However, what we witnessed was Mr. Seo

91
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:20,619
wiping his fingerprints

92
00:06:20,643 --> 00:06:23,330
off the phone and placing it
underneath the bed.

93
00:06:23,354 --> 00:06:24,998
I was just trying to take a photo...

94
00:06:25,022 --> 00:06:27,792
What did you tell me?
You said that you were confident

95
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:29,376
and that you'd pierce through anything.

96
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:32,571
I even summoned
the two-star general for you.

97
00:06:33,364 --> 00:06:36,468
You're the one who exposed
the corruption in the military,

98
00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:37,743
yet you got arrested

99
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:41,497
in front of police officers while trying
to frame someone for murder?

100
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:44,100
And I have to announce it myself?

101
00:06:44,124 --> 00:06:45,209
Is that it?

102
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:47,294
Am I

103
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:49,272
supposed to say that my prosecutors

104
00:06:49,296 --> 00:06:51,900
fabricated evidence again as soon as
I became the chief prosecutor?

105
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:53,008
Sir.

106
00:06:59,223 --> 00:07:00,808
Who knows about this?

107
00:07:03,102 --> 00:07:04,395
Who else knows about this?

108
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,355
Do you think this is 1988 or what?

109
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:09,525
Why did you beat up that guy?

110
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:14,113
You told us to make him confess, so...

111
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:21,036
How much time do we have?

112
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:25,624
Well, we have a day
if he doesn't get arrested.

113
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:29,169
We do have to let him go
by tomorrow night.

114
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:33,412
How much more time do you need?

115
00:07:34,883 --> 00:07:36,945
It'll be all gone in about two weeks.

116
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:39,030
He just got some bruises. That's all.

117
00:07:39,054 --> 00:07:42,016
Why do you guys never understand
what I tell you?

118
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:44,935
Good grief.

119
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,099
Gosh.

120
00:08:06,123 --> 00:08:08,375
He's more screwed than I am.

121
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:19,219
CHANG-JUN LEE

122
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:25,744
<i>Hey, do my guys have to keep being
fooled because of your guys' problems?</i>

123
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:27,495
Yes, I know. I admit it.

124
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,188
So let's put an end to this.

125
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:32,149
One week?

126
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,402
How will we justify it? Why?

127
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:43,678
Go ahead and detain him.

128
00:08:43,702 --> 00:08:45,889
We'll suspend his indictment in a week.

129
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:47,247
Yes, sir!

130
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:49,500
<i>By the way, that girl's phone
has been sent to NFS.</i>

131
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,336
- <i>You have nothing to worry about, right?</i>
- No.

132
00:09:00,803 --> 00:09:01,804
Right.

133
00:09:03,305 --> 00:09:04,389
Yes.

134
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:24,660
Gosh, why is there no empty room
beside his office?

135
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:31,349
All right. You should also make sure
your guys behave themselves.

136
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:33,042
Okay.

137
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:40,151
Even if Kyung-wan just followed the order,

138
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:41,861
fabricating an alibi is subject
to indictment.

139
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:45,347
But considering the fact that the military
is a special environment,

140
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:49,476
we should suspend his indictment
in two weeks. Let Eun-soo handle it.

141
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:53,331
Kyung-wan Park has an alibi
for the day Ga-young Kim got abducted.

142
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:55,555
- With the commander's wife...
- Suspend his indictment.

143
00:09:57,401 --> 00:09:58,694
Yes, sir.

144
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,598
Dong-jae will face a disciplinary action,
so he has to be suspended from his duties.

145
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,009
All cases assigned to his office
must be redistributed,

146
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,833
but tell him to show up
at his office on time.

147
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:09,329
Yes, sir.

148
00:10:10,497 --> 00:10:13,893
Had you told me about him
keeping Ga-young Kim's phone,

149
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:15,210
this wouldn't have happened.

150
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:16,503
My apologies.

151
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:20,299
I couldn't be certain of it
with the ringtone alone.

152
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:22,676
I bet that's not true.

153
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,345
You just couldn't trust me.

154
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:26,906
About the victim's phone.

155
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,225
How did you know
that the other one was fake?

156
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:32,352
Because those who have two cell phones

157
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:34,521
could have additional phones.

158
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:37,703
<i>We went to the golf course
at around 3 p.m.</i>

159
00:10:37,816 --> 00:10:40,616
<i>Private Park drove as usual.
He was like our golf instructor, you know.</i>

160
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:44,906
Si-mok.

161
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:48,553
<i>Because he knew I was suspicious of him
and that I went through his office,</i>

162
00:10:48,577 --> 00:10:51,973
I didn't think he'd expose the phone
easily.

163
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:54,833
Then does it mean
Dong-jae is not the culprit?

164
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:59,171
He even used the victim's phone
to escape my radar.

165
00:10:59,588 --> 00:11:00,964
Were you aware

166
00:11:01,465 --> 00:11:03,651
of the fact that he's suspicious of you?

167
00:11:03,675 --> 00:11:05,155
The ones who are suspicious of others

168
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:07,095
aren't the culprit...

169
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:11,892
No, it could be a trick.

170
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:16,456
By showing that he's suspicious of me,

171
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,024
he might be trying to escape
the suspicion surrounding him.

172
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:24,112
It's just like how you're confused
whether he's the culprit or not.

173
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:29,034
You're telling yourself
that you're not the culprit.

174
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:32,621
People say that a wise word
can solve all of your problems,

175
00:11:34,122 --> 00:11:37,334
yet you bring more trouble on yourself
every time you speak.

176
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:39,896
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,172
Are you really sorry?
From the bottom of your heart?

178
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,888
Did you just say
"from the bottom of your heart"?

179
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:51,263
Yes. What about it?

180
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:55,894
Most people would opt for "sincerely."

181
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:59,999
<i>The assault wasn't caused
by violent tendencies.</i>

182
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:02,143
<i>Something was wrong with his brain
when he was little.</i>

183
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:06,738
<i>It looks like the surgery damaged the part
responsible for perceiving human emotions.</i>

184
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:10,242
Find out if Dong-jae actually found
the phone,

185
00:12:10,534 --> 00:12:12,244
or if he stabbed her and took it from her.

186
00:12:12,494 --> 00:12:14,705
Yes, sir.
And I'll also keep a watchful eye

187
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:17,457
on whether any mishap happens

188
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:20,168
to Mr. Seo or not.

189
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:25,006
Have a good evening.

190
00:13:24,024 --> 00:13:26,151
How can a prosecutor
be such a bad judge of character?

191
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:30,197
I can't believe he thought
this guy stabbed two people.

192
00:13:30,822 --> 00:13:33,283
You also don't think he did it, right?

193
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,636
- Hey.
- Yes.

194
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,846
You really didn't do it, right?

195
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,914
I didn't. I didn't do anything.

196
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,919
Here. Eat more, okay?

197
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:45,837
You'll be released soon.

198
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:49,567
We should just forward him to prosecution,
saying he's been cleared of suspicion.

199
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:53,154
But that prosecutor has a nasty temper.

200
00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:54,697
That's right.

201
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:56,431
It would've been over in a week,

202
00:13:57,015 --> 00:14:01,228
but you called an attorney
and got on that prosecutor's nerves.

203
00:14:01,686 --> 00:14:02,997
He doesn't even have money.

204
00:14:03,021 --> 00:14:05,792
His family had to get into debt
because of the attorney's fees,

205
00:14:05,816 --> 00:14:08,110
and he got on the wrong side
of that prosecutor.

206
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:10,529
- You guys are eating.
- Yes.

207
00:14:11,738 --> 00:14:13,907
What did they say?
Can they revive the phone?

208
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:17,619
All of the deleted files
will be recovered as well.

209
00:14:28,672 --> 00:14:31,025
You got my text, right? We have to pretend

210
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:32,902
we didn't see what happened today.

211
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:34,886
- Yes, sir.
- By the way,

212
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:37,490
I asked you to share information
on what Prosecutor Hwang is up to.

213
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:38,991
What was that today?

214
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:41,895
When you knew about Ga-young Kim's phone,
you should've told me about it.

215
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,497
I would've totally reported it to you
if I had known.

216
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:47,417
I went to the scene because
he just asked me to meet him there.

217
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:49,210
You didn't know either?

218
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:51,170
They're asking us to keep it a secret.

219
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:53,434
They obviously know
that it's something to be ashamed of.

220
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:57,510
Report everything to me, no matter
how insignificant it seems. Got it?

221
00:14:57,534 --> 00:15:00,120
Yes, Captain. I'll leave for the day now.

222
00:15:01,163 --> 00:15:02,163
Get going.

223
00:15:04,082 --> 00:15:05,417
Don't work too hard.

224
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:11,756
Eat up.

225
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:21,433
- I'll take him.
- Sure.

226
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:33,570
You said you've never even
spoken to Ga-young.

227
00:15:33,904 --> 00:15:36,384
Why were her photos on your phone?
And why did you delete them?

228
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,366
Why did you lie?

229
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:42,303
I was afraid they might raise suspicion
during the investigation.

230
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:44,414
I took them secretly.

231
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:46,249
They're creepshots? Why did you do that?

232
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,043
Did you have a crush on her?

233
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:50,521
Many of my friends also took
photos of her secretly.

234
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:52,356
And I took them as I was just
passing by her.

235
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,842
Then you should've told us. Did you think
we wouldn't find out about it?

236
00:15:57,511 --> 00:15:58,511
I'm sorry.

237
00:16:16,655 --> 00:16:17,655
Just a moment.

238
00:16:26,915 --> 00:16:27,916
Lieutenant Han.

239
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,061
- Later.
- It's urgent.

240
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:32,629
- I have to do something now.
- It's about that.

241
00:16:41,263 --> 00:16:43,098
He'll be released in two weeks.

242
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,933
So let's not cause trouble.

243
00:16:46,268 --> 00:16:49,247
Your chief asked us
to keep it to ourselves.

244
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:52,375
If you cause another trouble, you'll be
excluded from the investigation.

245
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,858
Then things will get complicated.

246
00:16:57,821 --> 00:16:58,822
So...

247
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,327
Am I only allowed to rebel when it's about
things that are helpful for the case?

248
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:06,222
Do you not want to bother

249
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:09,126
trying to find another investigator
just because of a guy who's a nobody?

250
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,828
What I'm trying to say
is that no one can replace you.

251
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:13,848
Whether it's a bother is beside the point.

252
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:28,435
Do you know what he said?

253
00:17:30,604 --> 00:17:32,689
He asked me not to tell his grandmother.

254
00:17:35,942 --> 00:17:36,942
I can't

255
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:39,988
understand why he let them do this to him.

256
00:17:41,531 --> 00:17:44,117
But my co-workers whom I see every day,

257
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:48,264
who are completely normal people,
did something like this,

258
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:51,374
and that's what I'm struggling with more.
I can't accept it.

259
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:55,771
Do you think they did such a thing
because they were born evil?

260
00:17:55,795 --> 00:17:57,189
They've become like this

261
00:17:57,213 --> 00:17:59,108
because they can get away with it.

262
00:17:59,132 --> 00:18:00,610
They know people will turn a blind eye.

263
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:03,571
If one person keeps his or her
eyes wide open and speaks up,

264
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:04,679
this can change.

265
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,160
Whether he'll be released in two weeks
or detained for a long period of time,

266
00:18:09,184 --> 00:18:10,560
the choice is yours.

267
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:13,873
What do you mean by that?

268
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:16,917
If we let him go right away
due to human rights issues,

269
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:19,569
we'd be proving that we detained him
even though he's innocent.

270
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,365
If you don't turn a blind eye to it
and open your mouth,

271
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,742
they'll keep him locked up for months.

272
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:27,661
Make your choice.

273
00:18:35,168 --> 00:18:38,213
How many people do you think are told
to make a choice for reasons like this

274
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:42,092
when they're actually being
forced to be silent?

275
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:46,513
I can't compromise. I won't.

276
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,225
Kyung-wan isn't a crucial suspect,

277
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:52,787
but it's true that we have to vet him.

278
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:54,688
I'll investigate it until the end of it.

279
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:02,028
Then let's do this.

280
00:19:02,737 --> 00:19:05,990
Let's have an expert
handle the human rights violation.

281
00:19:09,327 --> 00:19:13,498
Hey, it's me. You still have some
business cards from that law firm, right?

282
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:18,479
<i>Can you go to Southern Seoul
Detention Center tomorrow?</i>

283
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:19,897
SOUTHERN SEOUL DETENTION CENTER

284
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:22,257
<i>Yes, early in the morning.
As early as possible.</i>

285
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:29,389
Here you go.

00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:17,227
Go on.

00:20:21,232 --> 00:20:22,232
Get changed.

292
00:20:26,196 --> 00:20:27,447
This way, please.

293
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,450
Straighten your back.

294
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:34,704
Come here. Squat down.

295
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:39,459
Turn around and bend down.

296
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:42,594
Pull down your underwear
and spread your legs.

297
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:55,809
Are you Mr. Kyung-wan Park?

298
00:20:58,895 --> 00:20:59,895
I'm Jung-bon Kim.

299
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:02,106
How are you holding up?

300
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,679
Did my grandmother send you here?

301
00:21:08,112 --> 00:21:09,298
Yes, sort of.

302
00:21:09,322 --> 00:21:11,491
I don't need an attorney.

303
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,951
Please leave.

304
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:15,221
As you can see...

I'm not an attorney.

00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:23,753
Oh, boy. It's quite chilly here, isn't it?

308
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:27,589
PROSECUTOR DONG-JAE SEO

309
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:31,219
Gosh, they can't be handled like that.

310
00:21:31,844 --> 00:21:34,180
We're colleagues.
You guys can't do this to us.

311
00:21:34,806 --> 00:21:35,806
This is just our...

312
00:21:38,184 --> 00:21:39,561

VOICE RECORD

314
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,127
Did you know the victim
before the incident took place?

315
00:22:06,588 --> 00:22:08,506
Did you know her or not?

316
00:22:11,134 --> 00:22:12,802
Can't you ask a better question?

317
00:22:13,469 --> 00:22:16,222
You should be asking if I saw anything.

318
00:22:17,307 --> 00:22:18,891
What did you see?

319
00:22:20,893 --> 00:22:22,895
What did the driver say when he called?

320
00:22:23,605 --> 00:22:27,025
Did he say that he gave her address
to a psycho around 9 p.m.?

321
00:22:28,526 --> 00:22:29,587
So?

322
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:32,590
If you left Yeoksam-dong around 9 p.m.
to go to Garwol-dong,

323
00:22:32,614 --> 00:22:34,449
it must've taken over 30 minutes.

324
00:22:35,408 --> 00:22:37,577
I beat you by at least 20 minutes.

325
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:42,248
Had you arrived a little sooner,
you could've witnessed the abduction.

326
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,711
Then how did you get her cell phone?

327
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,890
I told you I found it on the street.
Was I not allowed to pick it up?

328
00:22:51,466 --> 00:22:54,236
I guess you pick up
everything that's fallen on the ground.

329
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,488
Or did you see it on the ground

330
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,389
and know whose phone it was right away

331
00:22:59,098 --> 00:23:00,391
because you two were that close?

332
00:23:11,444 --> 00:23:15,281
<i>It looked like she had already fled,
but I thought she could come back.</i>

333
00:23:23,873 --> 00:23:25,917
<i>I parked nearby and waited.</i>

334
00:23:34,008 --> 00:23:35,009
<i>But...</i>

335
00:23:41,391 --> 00:23:43,685
<i>I could tell how much of a rush
she was in when she left.</i>

336
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,106
<i>I thought, "Waiting here is probably
a waste of time."</i>

337
00:23:49,023 --> 00:23:52,485
<i>I figured she'd look for her phone.
I was going to answer it when she called.</i>

338
00:23:53,444 --> 00:23:55,923
<i>Why were you trying so hard to meet her?</i>

339
00:23:55,947 --> 00:23:57,281
<i>Was it Mr. Lee's order?</i>

340
00:23:58,282 --> 00:24:00,451
I was trying to protect her.

341
00:24:00,618 --> 00:24:03,579
Why do you think I didn't tell Mr. Lee
about finding her address?

342
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:07,250
Did you cause a ruckus at the bar
because you wanted to protect her?

343
00:24:10,086 --> 00:24:12,773
At first, I thought it was only natural
that he wanted to track her down.

344
00:24:12,797 --> 00:24:14,358
After sending a girl like her,

345
00:24:14,382 --> 00:24:17,986
Mr. Park used to go, "She's actually
a minor. You guys are screwed now."

346
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,554
I knew that was his tactic.

347
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,284
Then he died. What do you think
I thought when that happened?

348
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:27,395
"Is he asking me
to find his second sacrificial victim?"

349
00:24:27,687 --> 00:24:29,498
So did you decide to hand her to him?

350
00:24:29,522 --> 00:24:32,400
I was trying to warn her.
I wanted to tell her that she should hide.

351
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,300
Was I supposed to do nothing,
fully knowing he was after her?

352
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:38,465
But she didn't call all night,

353
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:41,051
and I didn't hear anything from her
even the next day.

354
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:43,035
Youngsters can't stand a minute
without a phone.

355
00:24:43,745 --> 00:24:45,105
That's when my instinct kicked in.

356
00:24:45,872 --> 00:24:47,832
I thought,
"She didn't just drop her phone.

357
00:24:48,374 --> 00:24:49,374
He got her."

358
00:24:51,878 --> 00:24:53,171
Look at what happened.

359
00:24:54,005 --> 00:24:56,424
What did the phone look like
on the ground?

360
00:24:56,632 --> 00:24:58,152
What kind of question is that?

361
00:24:58,176 --> 00:25:00,154
Would it have been standing up or what?

362
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:01,512
It was just fallen on the street.

363
00:25:02,472 --> 00:25:04,116
All right.

364
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,018
Did you abduct Ga-young Kim
and inflict injuries on her?

365
00:25:10,646 --> 00:25:12,732
Gosh, you're driving me nuts.

366
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:15,818
Then do you think I killed Mr. Park too?

367
00:25:17,528 --> 00:25:18,528
Hey.

368
00:25:19,155 --> 00:25:21,699
I'm going to tell you this just once,
so listen up.

369
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:26,621
There are people who had
some after-hours fun thanks to Mr. Park.

370
00:25:27,371 --> 00:25:29,349
However, he just took care of the bills.

371
00:25:29,373 --> 00:25:33,085
He didn't introduce girls to anyone.
Even not to department chiefs.

372
00:25:33,586 --> 00:25:35,797
I'm sure he entertained people
at other companies too.

373
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,465
However...

374
00:25:39,383 --> 00:25:40,426
That night,

375
00:25:41,844 --> 00:25:44,055
the person to whom I reported
that I found the girl...

376
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:55,107
<i>Mr. Lee was the only one.</i>

377
00:26:02,615 --> 00:26:04,367
<i>But what I don't understand is</i>

378
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:08,996
<i>why he chose public execution
over secret burial.</i>

379
00:26:15,211 --> 00:26:16,504
<i>You should be careful too.</i>

380
00:26:16,963 --> 00:26:20,466
<i>Stop attacking him
unless you want to end up like that girl.</i>

381
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:23,278
Why did you do it?

382
00:26:23,302 --> 00:26:24,679
I said I didn't do it!

383
00:26:28,641 --> 00:26:31,161
Why did you drag Mr. Park into the circle

384
00:26:31,185 --> 00:26:33,396
and spoil your colleagues?

385
00:26:36,482 --> 00:26:37,692
You think I spoiled them?

386
00:26:39,068 --> 00:26:40,611
They did it to themselves.

387
00:26:46,701 --> 00:26:47,886
Please cooperate.

388
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,745
May I please have your car key, Mr. Seo?

389
00:26:50,872 --> 00:26:52,164
What's her problem now?

390
00:26:57,378 --> 00:26:58,605
SEIZURE ORDER

391
00:26:58,629 --> 00:27:01,841
I must collect all physical evidence
that can be damaged.

392
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:04,385
Both of you are suspects.

393
00:28:20,378 --> 00:28:23,714
<i>At 9:14 p.m., Mr. Seo arrived
at Ga-young Kim's place in Garwol-dong.</i>

394
00:28:25,132 --> 00:28:28,135
He left as soon as he confirmed
that she wasn't home.

395
00:28:35,518 --> 00:28:36,998
That must be when he found the phone.

396
00:28:39,063 --> 00:28:40,940
Everything matches his claim.

397
00:28:41,607 --> 00:28:42,608
However,

398
00:28:43,234 --> 00:28:45,128
the record shows

399
00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:48,447
that he called Mr. Lee at 7:47 p.m.,
which was before the incident took place.

400
00:28:49,782 --> 00:28:50,782
So?

401
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:54,207
If that's when Mr. Lee received
a report about Mr. Seo finding Ga-young,

402
00:28:54,328 --> 00:28:57,456
he definitely had enough time
to mobilize his accomplice.

403
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:01,794
Why are you showing me this?

404
00:29:02,378 --> 00:29:05,691
I thought you were supposed to protect
all damageable evidence from me.

405
00:29:05,715 --> 00:29:07,425
Isn't that what Mr. Lee wants you to do?

406
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:09,885
Who cares about what he wants?

407
00:29:12,346 --> 00:29:13,346
Eun-soo.

408
00:29:21,147 --> 00:29:22,315
Can I

409
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:24,525
trust you?

410
00:29:27,987 --> 00:29:29,507
I'm asking if you can be my right arm.

411
00:29:30,948 --> 00:29:32,033
Of course, Mr. Hwang.

412
00:29:36,203 --> 00:29:39,040
How dare you even dream
of becoming my right arm?

413
00:29:39,248 --> 00:29:41,250
I'd just cut off that arm.

414
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:44,628
What... What was that about?

415
00:29:45,296 --> 00:29:47,649
- How do you feel?
- What do you think?

416
00:29:47,673 --> 00:29:49,717
How can you mock someone like this?

417
00:29:50,051 --> 00:29:52,553
You were betrayed in just a minute,

418
00:29:52,887 --> 00:29:54,430
but Dong-jae has invested ten years.

419
00:29:54,764 --> 00:29:57,844
He was Mr. Lee's right arm for a decade
and did everything he was asked to do.

420
00:29:58,476 --> 00:30:01,687
Did you say Mr. Lee had enough time
to mobilize his accomplice?

421
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,440
Do you think he had more time
than Dong-jae?

422
00:30:04,815 --> 00:30:07,360
- So?
- Dong-jae is the culprit.

423
00:30:07,651 --> 00:30:09,111
He instigated his accomplice.

424
00:30:10,946 --> 00:30:12,746
Why are you rushing like this
all of a sudden?

425
00:30:13,532 --> 00:30:17,453
I solved the puzzle that seemed unsolvable
when I thought Mr. Lee was the culprit.

426
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:20,557
The question of why he didn't
finish the girl

427
00:30:20,581 --> 00:30:22,267
or bury her in the woods somewhere remote?

428
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:25,795
Dong-jae must've wanted to get back
at him. That's why he got the idea.

429
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,298
He must've thought he should
expose Mr. Lee's deep, dark secret

430
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,717
in a very shocking way.

431
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:37,056
So you think Mr. Seo is the culprit?
Is that your conclusion?

432
00:30:37,973 --> 00:30:38,974
Yes.

433
00:30:42,061 --> 00:30:44,688
Why? Aren't you happy
that the case is solved now?

434
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:48,401
Do you know something else?

435
00:30:49,026 --> 00:30:51,112
What did you see on the day you tailed us?

436
00:30:52,863 --> 00:30:56,843
- What are you talking about?
- It was captured in the security camera.

437
00:30:56,867 --> 00:30:58,411
The day we went to find Ga-young.

438
00:31:10,381 --> 00:31:13,068
I just followed you out because
I saw you going somewhere in a rush.

439
00:31:13,092 --> 00:31:15,302
That's really all. I did not tail you.

440
00:31:17,388 --> 00:31:20,850
Is that so? That's not what I saw
in the security camera footage.

441
00:31:21,225 --> 00:31:22,518
You're mistaken.

442
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:26,647
That's too bad.
You should've followed me more.

443
00:31:27,481 --> 00:31:30,151
Then you would've witnessed the scene.

444
00:31:30,985 --> 00:31:33,779
Or you could've crossed paths
with Mr. Seo's accomplice.

445
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,075
Then I would've told you about it already.
Why would I keep it to myself?

446
00:32:10,649 --> 00:32:12,776
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

447
00:32:16,989 --> 00:32:18,091
- Officer.
- Yes.

448
00:32:18,115 --> 00:32:20,802
Would there be anything that can be used
as a weapon in the evidence room?

449
00:32:20,826 --> 00:32:21,826
Pardon?

450
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,620
A weapon?

451
00:32:32,755 --> 00:32:35,859
You really can't use it.
You'll get in huge trouble if you do.

452
00:32:35,883 --> 00:32:38,427
Please only use it to scare him.

453
00:33:08,123 --> 00:33:09,559
PROSECUTOR YOUNG

454
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:11,436
<i>I know that you were
trying to kill the girl.</i>

455
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,671
<i>Check the lobby security camera footage
from that day.</i>

456
00:33:16,882 --> 00:33:18,634
SECURITY OFFICE

457
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,221
Where are you now? Let's meet up
and talk in person, okay?

458
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:24,557
You had no idea I was tailing you, right?

459
00:33:25,015 --> 00:33:27,518
But I saw it with my own two eyes.

460
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:30,729
You came straight here
and got her phone first.

461
00:33:31,814 --> 00:33:33,357
Your accomplice must've told you.

462
00:33:33,524 --> 00:33:35,204
Didn't you come here because of her phone?

463
00:33:35,985 --> 00:33:39,029
You said you saw it lying on the street,
but I know that it's a lie.

464
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:43,223
Why do you keep spewing total nonsense?
Hey, where are you...

465
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:55,546
<i>You came straight here
and got her phone first.</i>

466
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,590
"Here"?

467
00:34:20,446 --> 00:34:21,780
You're not even surprised.

468
00:34:28,996 --> 00:34:29,997
Hey, Eun-soo.

469
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:32,684
I'm not sure what you saw here
that day, but...

470
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:34,376
I don't care about that.

471
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:37,171
My target is Mr. Lee.

472
00:34:38,005 --> 00:34:40,341
- What?
- Dump it on him.

473
00:34:43,052 --> 00:34:44,571
Why are you being like this suddenly?

474
00:34:44,595 --> 00:34:47,973
It's not sudden. I've been patiently
waiting for an opportunity like this.

475
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:50,785
It's your specialty.

476
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:53,520
Framing others
and turning people into criminals.

477
00:34:54,146 --> 00:34:56,041
Mr. Hwang is suspicious of you too.

478
00:34:56,065 --> 00:34:58,585
If you don't do as I say,
I'll tell him that you're the culprit.

479
00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:01,528
The culprit had to be Mr. Lee.
Why did you get involved...

480
00:35:02,988 --> 00:35:04,156
Have you lost your mind?

481
00:35:16,043 --> 00:35:17,043
Was it you?

482
00:35:17,503 --> 00:35:19,838
Dump it all on Mr. Lee
and his father-in-law.

483
00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:23,175
Make it happen at all costs.

484
00:35:26,845 --> 00:35:28,055
Then what?

485
00:35:29,515 --> 00:35:30,516
What?

486
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,060
No criminal gets executed in this country.

487
00:35:33,727 --> 00:35:36,814
Those scums will figure out a way
to retaliate even if they're behind bars.

488
00:35:37,106 --> 00:35:39,918
The rich don't get punished even when
they hit someone with a metal pipe.

489
00:35:39,942 --> 00:35:41,860
Do you think they'll actually be
sent to jail?

490
00:35:42,444 --> 00:35:44,172
Both you and I will get killed.

491
00:35:44,196 --> 00:35:45,614
I'm not scared of death.

492
00:35:48,242 --> 00:35:49,243
I am.

493
00:35:49,743 --> 00:35:51,203
I have a kid,

494
00:35:51,995 --> 00:35:53,595
and I mean the whole world to my mother.

495
00:35:54,415 --> 00:35:56,643
I'm sure it will be better for your mother
if you just die

496
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:58,067
rather than become a serial killer.

497
00:36:01,004 --> 00:36:02,214
Then I have no choice.

498
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:04,548
I'll go report that I saw you
with your accomplice.

499
00:36:11,473 --> 00:36:12,473
Hey!

500
00:36:14,226 --> 00:36:17,020
Let go! I said, let go!

501
00:36:20,482 --> 00:36:21,482
Let go!

502
00:36:26,113 --> 00:36:27,113
Let go!

503
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:56,602
Hey.

504
00:37:00,063 --> 00:37:01,063
Eun-soo.

505
00:37:02,691 --> 00:37:04,067
Eun-soo.

506
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:07,821
Eun-soo.

507
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:10,031
Eun-soo!

508
00:37:10,491 --> 00:37:11,676
Eun-soo!

509
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,452
Gosh.

510
00:37:16,872 --> 00:37:18,040
I thought you were dead.

511
00:37:25,172 --> 00:37:27,212
Why did you have to provoke me
with such nonsense...

512
00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:31,345
Are you all right?

513
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:33,514
You really didn't do it, right?

514
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:38,267
You didn't kill him?

515
00:37:39,311 --> 00:37:41,021
What? I did not kill him.

516
00:37:44,983 --> 00:37:46,235
All right, then.

517
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,238
I knew it.

518
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,093
Hey, are you colluding with Si-mok?

519
00:37:54,117 --> 00:37:55,118
No.

520
00:38:27,401 --> 00:38:29,963
Mr. Seo didn't do it.
I confirmed it myself.

521
00:38:29,987 --> 00:38:30,987
He'd never kill anyone.

522
00:38:34,157 --> 00:38:36,493
You'd know what I mean if you saw it.

523
00:38:36,702 --> 00:38:40,622
I wouldn't be able to stand before you
like this if he was the culprit.

524
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,791
You were wrong this time.

525
00:38:43,292 --> 00:38:45,085
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

526
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:20,597
- What is it?
- <i>Can you lend me some clothes?</i>

527
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:23,099
<i>My mom will bombard me with questions
if I show up like this.</i>

528
00:39:23,123 --> 00:39:25,709
Tell her you got punched
while interrogating a vicious criminal.

529
00:39:37,554 --> 00:39:40,057
God, why is it taking so long?

530
00:39:53,737 --> 00:39:54,737
Thank you.

531
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:18,053
<i>I'm sorry, but...</i>

532
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:38,031
I can pull off any clothes, can't I?

533
00:40:43,245 --> 00:40:44,621
I'll give it back tomorrow.

534
00:40:46,123 --> 00:40:49,876
He might have figured out halfway through
that it was a trap.

535
00:40:50,794 --> 00:40:52,713
It's possible he stopped because of it.

536
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:54,548
No, it's not.

537
00:40:56,508 --> 00:40:59,302
I lied to him and threatened him.

538
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:02,198
If he was the killer,
he wouldn't have stopped like that

539
00:41:02,222 --> 00:41:03,765
whether he figured it out or not.

540
00:41:04,975 --> 00:41:06,285
You know how he is.

541
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:09,372
If he was about to be caught
after brutally harming two people,

542
00:41:09,396 --> 00:41:12,482
he would've lost it
and tried to shut me up at all costs.

543
00:41:12,649 --> 00:41:13,734
I'm not sure.

544
00:41:14,026 --> 00:41:17,738
He could be a lot more rational
and methodical than we think.

545
00:41:20,532 --> 00:41:22,325
Then this wouldn't have happened.

546
00:41:22,659 --> 00:41:26,038
He could've just used a stun gun
and dragged me like Ga-young.

547
00:41:26,747 --> 00:41:28,248
What if he thought.

548
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:31,585
I was behind you?

549
00:41:33,462 --> 00:41:35,338
I wish you were behind me there.

550
00:41:35,756 --> 00:41:38,008
You wouldn't be able to say that
if you actually saw it.

551
00:41:39,176 --> 00:41:41,386
I'm certain that Mr. Seo isn't
the culprit.

552
00:41:48,393 --> 00:41:51,104
Be honest with me.
You aren't sure about it either, right?

553
00:41:52,647 --> 00:41:54,649
Your conviction
that Mr. Seo is the culprit

554
00:41:55,484 --> 00:41:57,027
must be fading away because of me.

555
00:42:04,034 --> 00:42:05,285
I'll take that as a yes.

556
00:42:07,162 --> 00:42:08,455
See you tomorrow.

557
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,630
By the way, are you always like this?

558
00:42:18,965 --> 00:42:20,383
You don't even listen to any music?

559
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:47,512
<i>If he was the killer,
he wouldn't have stopped like that</i>

560
00:42:47,536 --> 00:42:49,037
<i>whether he figured it out or not.</i>

561
00:42:51,706 --> 00:42:55,085
<i>He could've just used a stun gun
and dragged me like Ga-young.</i>

562
00:42:55,669 --> 00:42:57,129
Eun-soo. Hey...

563
00:43:00,924 --> 00:43:03,861
<i>Eun-soo emphasized that Dong-jae
isn't the culprit,</i>

564
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:07,740
<i>but by doing so, she actually ended up
revealing how much she wants.</i>

565
00:43:07,764 --> 00:43:09,349
<i>Mr. Lee's family to be the culprit.</i>

566
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:13,353
<i>If she can throw her own life
out there as bait,</i>

567
00:43:13,728 --> 00:43:16,231
<i>how would she feel
about someone else's life?</i>

568
00:43:17,149 --> 00:43:19,317
<i>Between the probability
that Dong-jae isn't the culprit</i>

569
00:43:19,776 --> 00:43:21,736
<i>and the probability
that Eun-soo is a suspect,</i>

570
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:24,322
<i>which is higher now?</i>

571
00:43:32,622 --> 00:43:33,748
<i>Thank you for the sweater.</i>

572
00:43:36,293 --> 00:43:38,336
PROSECUTOR YOUNG

573
00:44:46,237 --> 00:44:48,637
They managed to recover
all the data on Ga-young Kim's phone.

574
00:44:49,366 --> 00:44:51,910
It has nothing but thousands
of her selfies.

575
00:44:52,202 --> 00:44:53,202
There's nothing useful.

576
00:44:53,662 --> 00:44:56,831
She should've taken photos
with those men instead.

577
00:44:57,457 --> 00:44:58,976
<i>They're not crazy.</i>

578
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,228
<i>Why would they do something
that might get them into trouble?</i>

579
00:45:01,252 --> 00:45:03,689
What about the call history?
Has it been retrieved too?

580
00:45:03,713 --> 00:45:05,833
I'm getting another call.
I'll call you back in a bit.

581
00:45:08,802 --> 00:45:10,387
Hey, Sun-chang. What's up?

582
00:45:22,148 --> 00:45:23,191
Salute.

583
00:45:24,401 --> 00:45:27,505
It took you quite a while to get here.
I guess you were somewhere far.

584
00:45:27,529 --> 00:45:28,714
Yes. When did she get here?

585
00:45:28,738 --> 00:45:30,132
A while ago.

586
00:45:30,156 --> 00:45:31,992
I couldn't say no.

587
00:45:32,534 --> 00:45:34,534
- I thought you should...
- I'm glad you called me.

588
00:45:47,507 --> 00:45:48,633
<i>You're doing it again!</i>

589
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,620
- Seriously.
- Okay, I won't smoke.

590
00:45:51,678 --> 00:45:52,738
- Gosh.
- All right, I'll quit.

591
00:45:52,762 --> 00:45:54,740
Get off of me. You reek of smoke.

592
00:45:54,764 --> 00:45:56,117
I'll really quit.

593
00:45:56,141 --> 00:45:58,018
Goodness, you stink.

594
00:46:06,151 --> 00:46:07,151
Ma'am.

595
00:46:12,115 --> 00:46:14,510
Did you come here
right after you saw Kyung-wan?

596
00:46:14,534 --> 00:46:17,471
We should live here when he gets released.
They'll let him go soon, right?

597
00:46:17,495 --> 00:46:18,931
Yes, of course.

598
00:46:18,955 --> 00:46:21,515
I was actually working on
verifying his alibi before coming here.

599
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:23,195
Please wait just a few more days.

600
00:46:29,549 --> 00:46:33,011
Shall I ask the police officer outside
to stay here with you?

601
00:46:41,853 --> 00:46:42,853
Well...

602
00:46:44,939 --> 00:46:46,983
When Kyung-wan gets out...

603
00:46:51,446 --> 00:46:52,739
Never mind.

604
00:46:53,323 --> 00:46:54,657
It's nothing.

605
00:46:55,033 --> 00:46:56,033
Those...

606
00:46:57,035 --> 00:46:58,804
- Do these need to be taken out?
- I'll...

607
00:46:58,828 --> 00:47:02,516
It's okay. If there's anything strenuous,
please ask that police officer for help.

608
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,900
He's my underling, so you can
use him for whatever you need.

609
00:47:05,335 --> 00:47:06,711
I'll see you later at home.

610
00:47:08,171 --> 00:47:09,171
Oh, boy.

611
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:17,347
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

612
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:21,059
She'll collapse if she finds out
what happened to him.

613
00:47:21,351 --> 00:47:22,477
You mean how we beat him up?

614
00:47:39,327 --> 00:47:41,663
I'm sorry. I couldn't stop them.

615
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,040
Were you there too?

616
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:48,710
I speculated.

617
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:53,633
Do you like <i>Astro Boy</i> by any chance?

618
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,552
<i>Astro Boy</i>?

619
00:47:56,177 --> 00:47:59,139
Oh, that cartoon? I've heard of it.

620
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:01,558
You've heard of it?

621
00:48:01,891 --> 00:48:04,227
You've only heard of that cartoon legend?

622
00:48:05,854 --> 00:48:09,834
Anyway, there's something his dad said.

623
00:48:09,858 --> 00:48:11,151
He has a dad?

624
00:48:11,651 --> 00:48:13,111
I thought he was a robot.

625
00:48:14,237 --> 00:48:16,489
I'm talking about the person
who drew it, Osamu Tezuka.

626
00:48:17,615 --> 00:48:19,284
Anyhow, that's not important right now.

627
00:48:20,285 --> 00:48:22,745
He said, "Cartoonists can draw anything",

628
00:48:23,454 --> 00:48:24,789
but there's one exception.

629
00:48:25,707 --> 00:48:28,042
"Things that violate basic human rights."

630
00:48:30,253 --> 00:48:31,588
It's just a cartoon, you know.

631
00:48:32,922 --> 00:48:36,426
We must not violate something that should
be protected even for cartoon characters.

632
00:48:38,094 --> 00:48:40,263
We have a thing called pride
as members of the police.

633
00:48:41,764 --> 00:48:43,099
From next time... I mean,

634
00:48:43,933 --> 00:48:46,477
from now on,
I will be sure to protect our pride.

635
00:48:48,521 --> 00:48:52,209
She wants to live here again. Keep up
the great work until she moves back here.

636
00:48:52,233 --> 00:48:53,526
No problem.

637
00:48:54,152 --> 00:48:55,152
Salute.

638
00:49:04,162 --> 00:49:06,348
So, Kyung-wan Park's indictment
will be suspended.

639
00:49:06,372 --> 00:49:08,100
What about Dong-jae?
Has a decision been made?

640
00:49:08,124 --> 00:49:11,794
I think he was just being overly
ambitious. He had no other intentions.

641
00:49:14,088 --> 00:49:16,216
You think it was done
purely out of ambition?

642
00:49:19,677 --> 00:49:21,822
The division commander is the only one
who's in deep shit.

643
00:49:21,846 --> 00:49:22,846
What's going on with him?

644
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:28,019
I heard the army headquarters will
investigate it, but I have no updates yet.

645
00:49:29,729 --> 00:49:32,774
They must be busy
trying to make sure their words match.

646
00:49:39,447 --> 00:49:41,157
I can't criticize them.

647
00:49:41,741 --> 00:49:43,826
We're also keeping what Dong-jae did
to ourselves.

648
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,419
- Hello.
- Hello.

649
00:50:17,443 --> 00:50:18,963
Please read this.

650
00:50:18,987 --> 00:50:20,321
Have a great day.

651
00:50:20,697 --> 00:50:22,323
- Hello.
- Hello, please read this.

652
00:50:22,824 --> 00:50:23,759
Hello.

653
00:50:23,783 --> 00:50:26,262
CRIME PREVENTION CAMPAIGN

654
00:50:26,286 --> 00:50:27,846
We're doing a crime prevention campaign.

655
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:30,190
- Please spread words about this.
- Have a good day. Hello.

656
00:50:46,472 --> 00:50:47,765
Okay. Get home safely.

657
00:50:59,152 --> 00:51:00,152
Yes.

658
00:51:03,573 --> 00:51:06,451
Is Dad hounding him again?

659
00:51:08,244 --> 00:51:11,205
<i>The line is busy at the moment.
You'll be connected to the voice mail.</i>

660
00:51:15,293 --> 00:51:16,186
Chairman Lee, please.

661
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:18,379
Yes, I just heard about it.

662
00:51:26,012 --> 00:51:28,514
Yes. Father?

663
00:51:31,267 --> 00:51:34,872
<i>Even if Dad scolds you,
just agree with everything he says.</i>

664
00:51:34,896 --> 00:51:36,522
<i>I'll take care of the rest.</i>

665
00:51:40,693 --> 00:51:41,694
Turn on the radio.

666
00:51:42,695 --> 00:51:43,695
<i>Breaking news.</i>

667
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:46,800
<i>This afternoon, Sungmoon Daily published
an exclusive story on suspicions</i>

668
00:51:46,824 --> 00:51:50,179
<i>surrounding the prosecution accepting
bribes, quoting an anonymous informant.</i>

669
00:51:50,203 --> 00:51:52,389
<i>According to the informant, the victim</i>

670
00:51:52,413 --> 00:51:55,184
<i>of the Huam-dong murder
which took place in January this year</i>

671
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:57,936
<i>bribed prosecutors
at Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office</i>

672
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,065
<i>with money and gifts on a regular basis
before his death.</i>

673
00:52:01,089 --> 00:52:03,359
<i>Sungmoon Daily, which reported
the suspicions of bribery,</i>

674
00:52:03,383 --> 00:52:07,112
<i>stated that the tip was received
through a regular registered mail</i>

675
00:52:07,136 --> 00:52:11,367
<i>and that it did not include any details
such as names of the prosecutors</i>

676
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,744
<i>who accepted bribes
or the amounts that were received.</i>

677
00:52:13,768 --> 00:52:16,354
So they ate up all the bribes
and killed him.

678
00:52:16,604 --> 00:52:18,398
How can they be that corrupt?

679
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,502
They're in no position
to judge and prosecute us.

680
00:52:21,526 --> 00:52:22,860
That's what I'm saying.

681
00:52:34,956 --> 00:52:37,017
- Anything on the informant?
- Nothing yet.

682
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:39,228
The newspaper received a typed letter.

683
00:52:39,252 --> 00:52:42,672
The informant used an old-fashioned method
in order to avoid IP tracking.

684
00:52:43,506 --> 00:52:46,226
- From which post office was it sent?
- I sent an investigator there.

685
00:52:52,265 --> 00:52:53,641
It's the former chief prosecutor.

686
00:53:07,447 --> 00:53:09,574
I won't remind you
how your staff should be managed.

687
00:53:10,241 --> 00:53:14,805
I know that some of you went to places
with or through the late Mr. Kim.

688
00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:16,723
Ask the owners to cooperate.
Don't send your staff.

689
00:53:16,747 --> 00:53:18,392
You'll have to make the requests yourself,

690
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:20,936
but don't do it via phone
as your calls can be recorded.

691
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,106
Make sure to let them know that they will
not only have to shut down their business,

692
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:26,567
but will also be doomed for life
if they don't watch their mouths.

693
00:53:26,591 --> 00:53:27,925
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

694
00:53:29,427 --> 00:53:30,696
No more team dinners as of today.

695
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,520
No lunch or dinner
outside the office, either.

696
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:34,283
Every bar and restaurant in the area

697
00:53:34,307 --> 00:53:36,476
will be filled with reporters
disguised as customers.

698
00:53:36,893 --> 00:53:39,037
If anyone provides them
with any gossip-worthy information,

699
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:42,291
I will find out who it is,
going through every division.

700
00:53:42,315 --> 00:53:46,110
Cleaning staff and security guards
are not allowed in prosecutors' offices.

701
00:53:48,946 --> 00:53:49,947
This will

702
00:53:51,574 --> 00:53:52,867
pass quietly.

703
00:53:53,826 --> 00:53:55,161
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

704
00:54:03,503 --> 00:54:07,006
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

705
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:20,728
It's impossible.

706
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:32,031
I apologize, sir.

707
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:35,761
Every time there's a problem,
it's at the western office.

708
00:54:35,785 --> 00:54:38,371
The Prosecutor General
must be sick of hearing it.

709
00:54:40,873 --> 00:54:43,834
I disgraced both of you.

710
00:54:44,252 --> 00:54:45,503
I sincerely apologize.

711
00:54:47,004 --> 00:54:48,297
I apologize too, sir.

712
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,634
My son-in-law dishonored you.

713
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,160
Please don't be like that, Mr. Lee.

714
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,097
Don't go easy on him.

715
00:54:56,556 --> 00:54:58,876
He can't complain even if you decide
to punish him harshly.

716
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:02,269
Is it true?

717
00:55:03,396 --> 00:55:05,082
Absolutely not.

718
00:55:05,106 --> 00:55:07,586
- What about the man who bribed and died?
- I've never met him.

719
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,364
What's your plan?

720
00:55:13,864 --> 00:55:15,199
We'll take the bull by the horns.

721
00:55:15,825 --> 00:55:18,327
We have nothing to hide or fear.

722
00:55:19,745 --> 00:55:22,683
Yes, show us what you can do.

723
00:55:22,707 --> 00:55:24,542
Public sentiment is like waves.

724
00:55:25,084 --> 00:55:28,254
Getting swept away is dangerous,
but it vanishes if you ride it well.

725
00:55:29,046 --> 00:55:30,046
Yes, sir.

726
00:55:31,841 --> 00:55:32,842
Sir.

727
00:55:33,634 --> 00:55:36,914
He'll run like a faithful dog to make sure
there's no more disgrace to prosecution.

728
00:55:49,775 --> 00:55:51,569
Who's the rat that did it?

729
00:55:53,195 --> 00:55:55,823
And why was it sent to <i>Sungmoon Daily</i>
out of all newspapers?

730
00:55:56,324 --> 00:55:57,491
The content seems strange.

731
00:55:58,326 --> 00:55:59,326
It didn't even say much.

732
00:55:59,827 --> 00:56:01,454
That's right. There are no details.

733
00:56:02,038 --> 00:56:04,478
It just talked about bribery.
The core information is missing.

734
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:08,294
But, don't you think it's strange

735
00:56:09,045 --> 00:56:11,273
that it was sent to <i>Sungmoon Daily</i>
out of all the newspapers?

736
00:56:11,297 --> 00:56:14,967
The person obviously knows the story
but doesn't want to reveal the details.

737
00:56:15,259 --> 00:56:16,636
It could be someone

738
00:56:17,219 --> 00:56:19,472
who wants turmoil
but wishes to protect the organization.

739
00:56:20,931 --> 00:56:21,908
Who would...

740
00:56:21,932 --> 00:56:24,477
It's possible the person didn't
reveal everything on purpose.

741
00:56:26,187 --> 00:56:27,730
It could be a warning.

742
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,775
Or it could be for money too.

743
00:56:34,737 --> 00:56:36,798
Are you still working on dumping
everything on Si-mok

744
00:56:36,822 --> 00:56:38,199
and closing the case?

745
00:56:38,866 --> 00:56:39,992
I apologize.

746
00:56:40,534 --> 00:56:42,888
I even finished digging up
some intel on him, but Mr. Park's son

747
00:56:42,912 --> 00:56:44,431
got involved all of a sudden.

748
00:56:44,455 --> 00:56:45,498
Put it on hold.

749
00:56:46,248 --> 00:56:49,752
If we say the culprit took
his own life now, people won't believe us.

750
00:56:51,128 --> 00:56:54,465
But Si-mok is still suspicious of me.

751
00:56:55,925 --> 00:56:58,636
It looks like you picked the one
you wanted to get rid of.

752
00:56:59,095 --> 00:57:00,895
You shouldn't let resentment
hinder your work.

753
00:57:01,305 --> 00:57:03,808
I must say, I can't stop thinking
that he outsmarts you.

754
00:57:04,433 --> 00:57:06,435
Well, there's someone else
who's above you.

755
00:57:06,936 --> 00:57:08,705
How dare she call me

756
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:10,929
and yell at me,
demanding that I should leave you alone?

757
00:57:11,482 --> 00:57:13,401
I have no idea where she got
that temper from.

758
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:18,030
Don't ask her about it
or tell her that I told you.

759
00:57:19,281 --> 00:57:21,593
I buttered up
the Public Prosecutor General for you

760
00:57:21,617 --> 00:57:23,744
and made sure he couldn't
say anything to you,

761
00:57:24,412 --> 00:57:25,955
so just go tell her all about it.

762
00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:29,083
I sincerely appreciate it.

763
00:57:30,167 --> 00:57:32,294
Let's please make sure
that this can pass quietly.

764
00:57:32,795 --> 00:57:35,047
I'd love for us to be able
to enjoy some peaceful days.

765
00:57:35,631 --> 00:57:36,799
I apologize again.

766
00:57:40,761 --> 00:57:43,240
Sponsorship Scandal, Just Like
The Busan Prosecutor Sponsorship Case.

767
00:57:43,264 --> 00:57:47,309
Sponsorship within Prosecution,
Another Utter Embarrassment.

768
00:57:54,608 --> 00:57:59,196
Sponsorship Scandal, Just Like
The Busan Prosecutor Sponsorship Case.

769
00:58:06,245 --> 00:58:07,788
LIEUTENANT HAN

770
00:58:12,668 --> 00:58:14,754
<i>I'm surprised you had a moment to call me.</i>

771
00:58:15,046 --> 00:58:17,465
<i>I thought everyone there would be
in deep trouble by now.</i>

772
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:19,467
I know who the culprit is.

773
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:27,767
Who is it?

774
00:58:29,602 --> 00:58:30,978
Who's the culprit?

775
00:58:32,605 --> 00:58:35,125
"Tortoise, show me your head.

776
00:58:35,149 --> 00:58:37,443
- Otherwise..."
- "I'll eat you up"?

777
00:58:38,027 --> 00:58:39,195
What are you doing now?

778
00:58:39,862 --> 00:58:41,822
The head has finally been revealed.

779
00:58:44,325 --> 00:58:46,094
One bottle of soju
and a bowl of udon, please.

780
00:58:46,118 --> 00:58:47,161
Get ramen.

781
00:58:48,496 --> 00:58:49,747
Actually, I'll get ramen.

782
00:58:55,711 --> 00:58:57,922
- We need water too.
- Sure.

783
00:59:03,844 --> 00:59:05,096
Thank you.

784
00:59:07,932 --> 00:59:09,225
Enjoy.

785
00:59:11,977 --> 00:59:13,729
Even if we develop high blood pressure,

786
00:59:14,188 --> 00:59:16,565
we should see the body
being revealed before we die.

787
00:59:36,001 --> 00:59:37,711
The only head that came out today

788
00:59:38,963 --> 00:59:40,589
was the informant.

789
00:59:42,049 --> 00:59:44,903
The culprit must've been waiting
for this moment from the get-go.

790
00:59:44,927 --> 00:59:47,864
He must've been furious because the fact
that Mr. Park was a financial sponsor

791
00:59:47,888 --> 00:59:49,473
wasn't exposed right after his death.

792
00:59:49,598 --> 00:59:53,912
Now, I can understand why he dealt
with Ga-young Kim like that.

793
00:59:53,936 --> 00:59:55,455
Her cell phone too.

794
00:59:55,479 --> 00:59:58,959
Think about it. He didn't even leave
a single strand of hair.

795
00:59:58,983 --> 01:00:01,402
Dropping it there must not have been
a mistake.

796
01:00:01,694 --> 01:00:03,547
If what Mr. Seo said is true...

797
01:00:03,571 --> 01:00:05,423
He said it could be easily seen.

798
01:00:05,447 --> 01:00:08,742
It was as if the culprit was telling us,
"This is where the abduction took place."

799
01:00:11,287 --> 01:00:12,329
Here you go.

800
01:00:13,247 --> 01:00:14,832
Thank you.

801
01:00:23,299 --> 01:00:24,967
Do you know anyone at <i>Sungmoon Daily</i>?

802
01:00:25,926 --> 01:00:27,720
I looked into it
but couldn't find anything.

803
01:00:27,845 --> 01:00:30,514
I don't even think people there know
who the informant is.

804
01:00:31,515 --> 01:00:32,766
I should go there tomorrow.

805
01:00:34,101 --> 01:00:37,021
Right, tomorrow.
Kyung-wan will be released in the morning.

806
01:00:43,652 --> 01:00:46,947
I haven't been able to tell Mr. Park's
mother about Kyung-wan's situation.

807
01:00:48,574 --> 01:00:49,867
She'll see it in the news.

808
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:56,081
What?

809
01:01:02,421 --> 01:01:04,048
By any chance,

810
01:01:06,258 --> 01:01:07,801
did you tip them off?

811
01:01:09,178 --> 01:01:11,096
I said the informant is the culprit.

812
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,641
If you are the informant,
you should tell me now.

813
01:01:16,435 --> 01:01:17,811
I'm not.

814
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,480
Cheers.

815
01:01:22,858 --> 01:01:26,463
By the way, what makes you think
that you can trust what I'm telling you?

816
01:01:26,487 --> 01:01:28,781
Who says I do? I don't trust you.

817
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:40,268
You smiled.

818
01:01:40,292 --> 01:01:42,795
You smiled just now. You did, right?

819
01:01:43,212 --> 01:01:45,506
- Did I?
- Yes. You have a pretty smile.

820
01:01:45,673 --> 01:01:46,924
Just a second.

821
01:01:50,594 --> 01:01:52,805
- Hang on.
- Well...

822
01:01:53,472 --> 01:01:54,807
Don't give me any gifts.

823
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:08,779
The more clues get revealed,

824
01:02:09,655 --> 01:02:13,575
the more I think the culprit is someone
who suffered because of the sponsorship.

825
01:02:14,743 --> 01:02:17,454
Whether it's toward the prosecution
or Moo-sung Park,

826
01:02:17,871 --> 01:02:19,498
he's holding grudges.

827
01:02:42,896 --> 01:02:43,790
JUNG-BON KIM

828
01:02:43,814 --> 01:02:44,814
<i>I'll get started.</i>

829
01:02:48,235 --> 01:02:49,921
<i>You might be affected.</i>

830
01:02:49,945 --> 01:02:51,322
SOUTHERN SEOUL DETENTION CENTER

831
01:02:54,325 --> 01:02:55,409
There he is.

832
01:03:10,892 --> 01:03:13,144
- It's cold.
- I'm fine.

833
01:03:17,565 --> 01:03:21,068
<i>A civil righter submitted
an investigation request to prosecution,</i>

834
01:03:21,194 --> 01:03:23,297
<i>claiming that police officers
harshly treated a suspect</i>

835
01:03:23,321 --> 01:03:25,761
<i>during an interrogation, which has
aroused a huge controversy.</i>

836
01:03:26,407 --> 01:03:29,452
Yes, I'm at Yongsan Police Station now.

837
01:03:29,577 --> 01:03:32,472
<i>Mr. Park, who was arrested as a suspect
of a murder case,</i>

838
01:03:32,496 --> 01:03:36,268
<i>is claiming that he was tortured
during his interrogation here.</i>

839
01:03:36,292 --> 01:03:39,688
<i>I heard photos that prove his claim
have been disclosed as well.</i>

840
01:03:39,712 --> 01:03:40,588
<i>That's right.</i>

841
01:03:40,713 --> 01:03:44,008
<i>The photos disclosed
by civil righter Mr. Jung-bon Kim</i>

842
01:03:44,258 --> 01:03:46,904
<i>clearly show traces
of the harsh treatments Mr. Park received</i>

843
01:03:46,928 --> 01:03:48,512
<i>during his interrogation.</i>

844
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:51,658
<i>Mr. Park claimed that the police officers
assaulted him while coercing him</i>

845
01:03:51,682 --> 01:03:53,267
<i>to admit the charges.</i>

846
01:03:53,851 --> 01:03:56,079
<i>The information on the late Mr. Park
bribing prosecutors</i>

847
01:03:56,103 --> 01:03:59,148
<i>at Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office
was received less than a day ago.</i>

848
01:03:59,273 --> 01:04:02,127
<i>And now, a suspicion that officers
at Yongsan Police Station coerced.</i>

849
01:04:02,151 --> 01:04:04,296
<i>Mr. Park's son to admit the allegations
on committing</i>

850
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,322
<i>parricide and attempted murder
has been raised.</i>

851
01:04:06,781 --> 01:04:09,101
<i>Which prosecutors' office was
in charge of Mr. Park's case?</i>

852
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:11,661
<i>It was Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.</i>

853
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:20,336
<i>Tell everyone who's fourth grade or higher
to gather at the assembly hall.</i>

854
01:04:53,124 --> 01:04:54,542
As of 10 a.m. today,

855
01:04:55,168 --> 01:04:58,505
our office will launch
a special investigation to thoroughly

856
01:04:58,963 --> 01:05:01,484
investigate the suspicions surrounding
prosecutors and corruption.

857
01:05:01,508 --> 01:05:04,904
I will assign it to a prosecutor
who will investigate everyone fairly

858
01:05:04,928 --> 01:05:06,387
regardless of their positions.

859
01:05:18,441 --> 01:05:21,903
In order to ensure the investigation's
independence, the prosecutor in charge

860
01:05:22,445 --> 01:05:25,085
will only report the final result
to the Public Prosecutor General.

861
01:05:29,702 --> 01:05:31,287
The prosecutor in charge...

862
01:05:44,384 --> 01:05:45,593
The prosecutor in charge

863
01:05:46,136 --> 01:05:48,221
is Si-mok Hwang of Division Three.
