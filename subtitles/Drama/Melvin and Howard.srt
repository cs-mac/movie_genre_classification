927
01:17:13,689 --> 01:17:16,144
- Main thing's the press conference.
- What?

928
01:17:16,358 --> 01:17:18,066
Press conference tomorrow.

929

[Car horns blare]

930
01:17:33,917 --> 01:17:36,668
[Fred] Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr Melvin Dummar,

931
01:17:36,878 --> 01:17:40,128
his wife and children,
his attorney Dwayne Edwards.

932
01:17:40,339 --> 01:17:44,384
I don't want any litigation questions,
only on the basis of the will.

933
01:17:44,594 --> 01:17:48,093
Understand? No litigation questions.
First question.

934
01:17:48,306 --> 01:17:51,674
[Man] Hughes' company, Summa,
claims this will is a forgery.

935
01:17:51,892 --> 01:17:54,644
What did I just tell you?
I'll have you thrown out.

936
01:17:54,854 --> 01:17:57,890
[Fred] Leave the premises.
No litigation questions.

937
01:17:58,107 --> 01:18:00,728
[Man] Was the man
you picked up Howard Hughes?

938
01:18:00,943 --> 01:18:06,068
Well, he said he was Howard Hughes.
He looked like an old bum.

939
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:09,282
- [Man]... Hughes would look?
- Neat, healthy.

940
01:18:09,493 --> 01:18:13,075
This guy was sick.
His hands were all wrinkled up...

941
01:18:13,288 --> 01:18:16,159
[man] Did you think
a dream like this could come true?

942
01:18:16,374 --> 01:18:20,242
Well, when you dream
about something it's no problem, but...

943
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:24,459
[man] Everybody thinks you're lying.
How does that make you feel?

944
01:18:26,426 --> 01:18:28,751
[Confused babble of voices]

945
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:34,723
[Melvin] He was hurt.
Maybe he thinks I saved his life.

946
01:18:34,934 --> 01:18:38,599
No, I did not.
I did not forge that will.

947
01:18:38,813 --> 01:18:42,857
I didn't write the will,
I don't know anything about the will.

948
01:18:43,067 --> 01:18:49,105
Uh... I'm really pleased
he's going to inherit that $156 million,

949
01:18:49,323 --> 01:18:51,446
is that right?

950
01:18:51,659 --> 01:18:54,328
I hope that when he gets the dough

951
01:18:54,536 --> 01:18:58,700
he remembers that
he owes the Rockwood Dairy $4,500.

952
01:18:58,916 --> 01:19:03,376
[Man] What kind of a guy
was Melvin to work with?

953
01:19:03,587 --> 01:19:06,256
[Jim] He was a fine man... uh...

954
01:19:06,465 --> 01:19:11,459
A good worker. Matter of fact,
he was Milkman of the Month.

955
01:19:20,395 --> 01:19:24,262
- Two bucks.
- You remember me, Melvin?

956
01:19:24,482 --> 01:19:28,432
- Huh?
- I was with you. We were all together.

957
01:19:28,653 --> 01:19:31,773
You, me and Howard.

958
01:19:31,989 --> 01:19:35,275
But it was me
that gave him that quarter.

959
01:19:35,493 --> 01:19:38,696
- Oh, you're the one!
- That's right.

Oh, man... Call the police, Bonnie.

965
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:10,983
[Gunman] You're a liar!
You never saw Howard Hughes.

966
01:20:11,194 --> 01:20:15,571
You never saw him,
never met him in his life.

967

You never saw him, Dummar!

- Get him outta here!

- Are you all right?
- Sure, I'm all right.

How's Farron? How's Darcy?

Oh, wow, Melvin. She is so proud.

at school because of this, is she?

the will to the church?

- [Melvin] What might be inside.

Can you give me one reason on earth

991
01:21:56,796 --> 01:22:02,170
why this strange man would leave
that will with you, Melvin Dummar?

- No, I didn't.

995
01:22:12,729 --> 01:22:16,773
Isn't it true you can't find an answer
because it never happened that way?

Please, stand up. Face the judge.

Place your hand on the bible.
Raise your right hand.

that this story about
how you received this will is true?

I do.

Well, Melvin, if it meant...

1002
01:22:40,547 --> 01:22:45,505
...eternal damnation in hell, would
you still say it happened that way?

1003
01:22:45,719 --> 01:22:49,088
It's the truth.
Of course I would say that.

Yes, sir.

- Melvin, are you lying?
- No, sir.

1008
01:23:16,874 --> 01:23:20,658
I want you to know that...

1009
01:23:20,878 --> 01:23:27,461
...there is a still, small voice
that many people are blessed with,

1010
01:23:27,676 --> 01:23:31,888
that tells them
when the truth is being spoken.

1011
01:23:34,433 --> 01:23:38,644
It's been said,
"What doth it profit a man

1012

if he gain the whole world
yet lose his soul?"

1013
01:23:47,571 --> 01:23:51,948
Now, if you're lying, Melvin,
which you are in my opinion,

1014
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:59,371
your soul may be in jeopardy but that's
not really what I'm concerned with now.

1015
01:23:59,582 --> 01:24:02,369
I'm concerned with your hide.

1016
01:24:04,462 --> 01:24:08,625
Because if I find that
you're lying before this court,

1017
01:24:08,841 --> 01:24:13,503
I'll make it a special duty
to have a piece of your hide.

1018
01:24:14,638 --> 01:24:19,384
I'll direct the District Attorney to
bring a criminal case against you.

1019
01:24:20,477 --> 01:24:24,605
And I'll make it my special project
that if you're convicted,

1020
01:24:24,815 --> 01:24:28,682
I will recommend
that you do time in prison.

1021
01:24:32,114 --> 01:24:35,565
And I want you to know
Nevada State Prison's no country club,

01:24:35,784 --> 01:24:40,778
like Gabbs local jail
or wherever it was you served time.

1023
01:24:48,088 --> 01:24:53,923
If you're lying, you go straight
to Nevada State Prison.

1024
01:24:55,178 --> 01:24:57,929
All right, Melvin?

1025
01:24:58,139 --> 01:24:59,882

by the station where I was working.

answers elicited from you this morning?

Yes, sir.

No, I don't

in the preparation of the will?

No, sir.

they determine the validity of the will.

it's the only will we got.

by handwriting experts,

1044

the will's gonna be admitted to
probate. You'll get your inheritance.

- It's gonna be a long road.

What do you say?

1049
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:41,445
No, I don't think so, man.

1050

You can use the cash.

down from the gas station.

I just hope you don't
have any illusions.

will take out taxes, the state...

Yeah, listen, I've known that
since I first found that will.

1060

What do you mean?

1061
01:27:19,568 --> 01:27:23,696
I mean, you think that Melvin Dummar
is gonna get $156 million?

1062
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:26,064
Or anything like it?

1063
01:27:26,283 --> 01:27:28,952
Nah, I'm not gonna see that money.

1064
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:32,029
That's all right.

01:27:33,456 --> 01:27:35,947
Cos you know what happened?

sang Melvin Dummar's song.

That's what happened.

1068
01:27:45,968 --> 01:27:47,760
He sang it.

1069
01:27:51,098 --> 01:27:54,052
He was funny.

1070
01:27:57,855 --> 01:28:02,481
Yeah, he sang it.

1071

1073
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:13,237
That's OK.

up there in the fresh air? Oh, yeah.

comic books and a little toy for Farron.

You're not gonna hassle me when I want
them back at the end of the summer?

1078
01:28:34,182 --> 01:28:36,424
You got my word.

1079
01:28:36,642 --> 01:28:39,846
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- Aww, come on.

1080
01:28:40,062 --> 01:28:43,478
Bonnie sure is gonna have
her hands full this summer.

1081
01:28:43,691 --> 01:28:47,641
- Yeah.
- Give us a kiss.

1082
01:29:07,255 --> 01:29:09,497
[Darcy] Bye, Mom!

1083
01:29:25,982 --> 01:29:28,188
Don't wake him up.

1084
01:29:30,236 --> 01:29:32,561
I'll try not to.

1085
01:29:49,505 --> 01:29:52,755
How about lettin' me drive?

1086
01:29:54,009 --> 01:29:56,465
- You?
- I'm a darned good driver.

1087
01:29:56,678 --> 01:29:59,513
You haven't driven
since they put out the Hudson.

1088
01:29:59,723 --> 01:30:02,640
I'm a darned good driver, I'll bet you.

1089
01:30:06,021 --> 01:30:07,645
All right.

1090
01:30:13,153 --> 01:30:17,020
When we get into Vegas, though,
I'm gonna run it in.

1091
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:19,648
Slide over.
