1
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:30,735
My friends--

2
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,543
- Ready for dessert?
- Yeah!

3
00:03:37,948 --> 00:03:40,883
Specialty of the house
is served chilled...

4
00:03:40,984 --> 00:03:44,078
but it melts very quickly.

5
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:47,419
So I suggest
that we gobble it up.

6
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:29,922
- Yes?
- I'd like to see Stanford White.

7
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:33,400
Who, may I ask,
is calling?

8
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:35,335
Here's my card.

9
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,818
Sir--

10
00:05:01,198 --> 00:05:02,688
Are you in there, White?

11
00:05:07,938 --> 00:05:10,736
Open the door!

12
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:11,830
White!

13
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:15,873
Who is it?

14
00:05:19,116 --> 00:05:22,813
You know who it is.
You know damn well who it is!

15
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:28,515
Harry K. Thaw of Pittsburgh!

16
00:05:29,993 --> 00:05:32,928
Don't you think this is
a bit irregular, Mr. Thaw?

17
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,055
Look, I want to talk to you!

18
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:37,463
Hardly a way to go about it,
Mr. Thaw.

19
00:05:37,568 --> 00:05:42,062
Don't play with me, White!
Look, open the door...

20
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:44,265
or some friends of mine
will open it for me.

21
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:46,638
I'm serious!

22
00:05:46,743 --> 00:05:49,143
What do you want?

23
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:53,579
White, I'm here for the statue.

24
00:05:53,684 --> 00:05:55,675
I'm takin' it down!

25
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:58,414
I'm getting tired
of this ridiculous business.

26
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:00,581
Why don't you go away now...

27
00:06:00,691 --> 00:06:04,058
and save me the trouble
of calling the police?

28
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,506
Goddamn it, Thaw,
that door is priceless!

29
00:06:26,617 --> 00:06:29,177
When are you going to stop
this ridiculous charade?

30
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:31,982
- You're creating the scandal!
- I can see what's goin' on here.

31
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:33,420
Mr. Thaw--

32
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:35,184
I know what you do
with your chorus girls.

33
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:36,623
Mr. Thaw--

34
00:06:36,727 --> 00:06:38,490
I know what all
you people are up to!

35
00:06:38,595 --> 00:06:40,859
I'm sure the police'd
like to know too.

36
00:06:40,964 --> 00:06:45,264
Let me introduce Commissioner
of Police Rheinlander Waldo.

37
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:50,466
I'm sure he'll be fascinated by
all the stories you have to tell.

38
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:53,475
Look, I'm not a fool.

39
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:55,511
You hear me?
I'm not a fool.

40
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:58,775
I know exactly
what I'm doing.

41
00:06:58,882 --> 00:07:01,442
'Cause I'm smart.
I'm smarter than you are.

42
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:13,857
My apologies.

43
00:07:44,194 --> 00:07:47,186
- Are we ready?
- Yes, I think so.

44
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:55,269
Let me see your hands.

45
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:57,272
Other side.

46
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:06,046
So, did anything interesting
happen to anybody this week?

47
00:08:13,357 --> 00:08:18,420
- So I'm the only one, am I?
- What, dear?

48
00:08:19,863 --> 00:08:22,798
I was going over
our accounts the other day...

49
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:26,027
and it seems our factory had
its best quarter ever.

50
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:30,239
And I was rather intrigued
to discover...

51
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,070
that the items which were
moving most rapidly...

52
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:36,270
were the new firework designs
by your brother.

53
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,107
That's right.

54
00:08:42,452 --> 00:08:44,613
You know, not too long ago
I had some doubts...

55
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:47,087
that you had the stuff
to be my partner one day.

56
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,658
But I'm very encouraged.

57
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:52,661
Very encouraged.

58
00:08:54,564 --> 00:08:57,032
And by way of thanks...

59
00:08:57,134 --> 00:08:59,398
I'd like you to say
the family grace today.

60
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:07,609
Could we all
bow our heads?

61
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:17,317
Jesus! Jesus!

62
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,649
What is it, Brigit?

63
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:26,319
What's wrong?

64
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:39,269
Oh, my God.

65
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:49,010
Brigit, what did you do?
Answer me!

66
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:51,883
- I didn't do nothin'.
- Then what is that child--

67
00:09:51,988 --> 00:09:54,650
I was pouring out
the water from the vegetables...

68
00:09:54,758 --> 00:09:56,919
then there was a horrible
screamin' on the ground...

69
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:59,222
and I looks,
and there was a baby!

70
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:10,569
- Call Dr. Mueller.
- I'll do it.

71
00:10:15,212 --> 00:10:17,510
Where are you taking it?

72
00:10:17,614 --> 00:10:19,514
Not in the house?

73
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:33,029
Well, he's breathing fine.
Heartbeat's strong.

74
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:35,654
Seems like a healthy child.

75
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:37,733
Is there anything
we should do?

76
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,768
Well, keep him warm and dry,
and don't worry yourself.

77
00:10:40,804 --> 00:10:44,035
If he needs anything,
he'll be the first to let you know.

78
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,938
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

79
00:10:54,651 --> 00:10:57,620
We found this one hiding
in a cellar a few blocks away.

80
00:10:57,721 --> 00:10:59,621
She won't talk.

81
00:11:03,693 --> 00:11:06,958
You go on to your room.

82
00:11:07,063 --> 00:11:10,089
Miss, is this your baby?

83
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:21,475
Lady, is this your baby
or isn't it?

84
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:28,550
You wanna make life easy for
yourself and tell us yes or no...

85
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:32,717
or do you want me to ask
the doctor here to examine you?

86
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:37,392
Doctor, do you mind?

87
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:41,088
Could I have some privacy?

88
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:52,000
-Jim, would you care for some tea?
- No, no. That's all right.

89
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:56,978
Quite a situation.

90
00:11:58,114 --> 00:12:00,014
Incredible.

91
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:02,744
There you are.

92
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:08,255
These niggers drop babies
like rabbits.

93
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:12,454
Fellow runs off, and, of course,
the woman tries to get rid of it.

94
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:15,258
What's going to happen to her?

95
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:21,601
She'll get six to eight months--
child abuse, abandonment...

96
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:23,935
attempted murder.

97
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,133
And then she'll
get pregnant again.

98
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:31,878
- What'll happen to the baby?
- They've got places for them.

99
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:35,483
Pickaninny farms, I call them.

100
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:42,015
Well, she's given birth recently.
That's about all I can tell you.

101
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,650
I'll give you a report tomorrow.

102
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:48,561
Sorry to see your Sunday dinner
disrupted like this, folks...

103
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:51,327
and I guess I'd better be
getting back to mine.

104
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:54,528
- Good day.
- Good day, Doctor.

105
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:59,940
- Thank you, Doctor.
- We'll need your signature on this.

106
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:03,376
Just a formality, and then
we'll take them off your hands.

107
00:13:13,423 --> 00:13:17,359
Excuse me, dear. Would you mind
if I asked the inspector a question?

108
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,018
Oh, no.
No, you go ahead.

109
00:13:22,132 --> 00:13:24,862
She's going to be
put into prison, isn't she?

110
00:13:24,968 --> 00:13:28,768
- Oh, yes.
- Without her child?

111
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:34,276
Well, a woman who abandons
her baby like this--

112
00:13:34,377 --> 00:13:37,938
I think it's better for the baby
if they were separated, don't you?

113
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:39,913
We're not dealing
with Christians, ma'am.

114
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:41,244
Exactly.

115
00:13:43,186 --> 00:13:46,417
These people don't have the same
sense of family as what we do.

116
00:13:46,523 --> 00:13:47,922
Exactly.

117
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:55,595
Would it make any difference in
her case if we were to take her in?

118
00:13:58,334 --> 00:14:00,234
Temporarily, of course.

119
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:02,566
Dear, you don't mean--

120
00:14:02,672 --> 00:14:05,607
Nobody's even talked to her.

121
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:09,236
Nobody knows what made her do it.
If we knew, maybe we could help her.

122
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:11,279
If, if, if, if.

123
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:15,078
- I'm just asking.
- It's out of the question.

124
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,388
My wife is a very generous woman,
which I appreciate.

125
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:28,995
Excuse us for just a moment,
would you?

126
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:55,957
My wife wants the statue down.

127
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,460
Right, Evie?

128
00:15:06,636 --> 00:15:08,263
Yes, dear, yes.

129
00:15:08,371 --> 00:15:10,771
Yes, what? Tell them.

130
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:13,536
Tell them!
What do you want?

131
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:17,874
Yes, I want
the statue down, please.

132
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:21,781
- See?
- Yes, Mr. Thaw.

133
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:24,479
We quite understand
your feelings in the matter.

134
00:15:24,587 --> 00:15:28,387
No. Look, he put that statue up
there to make me look like a fool.

135
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:32,217
I'm Harry K. Thaw of Pittsburgh!

136
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:34,387
I've got my reputation
to think about.

137
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:36,488
I'm not havin' my wife
on public display!

138
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:40,031
Of course not, Mr. Thaw.

139
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:47,069
Now, regarding the possible
grounds for legal action--

140
00:15:47,177 --> 00:15:49,668
Exactly! Legal grounds.
Now you're talkin'.

141
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:51,406
There aren't any, Mr. Thaw.

142
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:55,109
What the hell
are you talking about?

143
00:15:55,218 --> 00:15:58,312
You're lawyers. Find some.

144
00:15:58,421 --> 00:16:00,321
For God's sake, she's my wife!

145
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:04,382
She's not a chorus girl anymore.
She's not a model.

146
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:07,657
She's not his mistress.
She's my wife!

147
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:11,222
You do whatever the hell you have to
do to get my wife off that building.

148
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:15,998
Yes, Mr. Thaw. We'll do everything
we can within the realm of the law.

149
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:21,710
Because if you don't--

150
00:16:37,994 --> 00:16:41,088
I've heard men say so often
they could love their wives alone

151
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:45,657
But I think that such foolish men
must have hearts made of stone

152
00:16:45,768 --> 00:16:49,704
Now, my heart is made of softer
stuff, it melts at each warm glance

153
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:54,368
A pretty girl can't look my way
without a new romance

154
00:16:55,478 --> 00:16:59,778
I could love a million girls
with every girl, a twin

155
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:03,876
I could love a Chinese girl
an Eskimo, a Finn

156
00:17:03,987 --> 00:17:08,117
I could love a German girl
a girl with golden curls

157
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:11,955
In fact I think that I could love
about a million girls

158
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:16,054
He could love a million girls
a million girls, could he

159
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:20,124
I could love a native girl
from far across the sea

160
00:17:20,236 --> 00:17:25,105
He could love a redhead girl
a girl with raven curls

161
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:29,304
In fact I think that I could love
about a million girls

162
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:42,654
Are you a little warm?

163
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:45,785
- Do you want to take off your coat?
- I'm fine.

164
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:49,858
I'm cool as a cucumber.

165
00:18:18,895 --> 00:18:21,227
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Harry.

166
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:32,202
I loved a girl whose eyes
shone forth just like a crystal mass

167
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:36,142
I loved her till I found out that
her eye was made of glass

168
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:40,409
I loved a girl whose form it was
a gorgeous thing to see

169
00:18:40,516 --> 00:18:44,850
I loved her till I found out
that part of it was a tree

170
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:09,240
White!

171
00:19:47,183 --> 00:19:51,745
Help him! Help!
Help him!

172
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:56,723
- Help him!
- Hey! Hey, you!

173
00:19:56,826 --> 00:19:59,920
All right. Now, don't do
anything stupid.

174
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:03,164
Just give me the gun.

175
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:11,431
Get a doctor! Get a doctor!

176
00:21:57,547 --> 00:22:00,107
Oh, well, do you
want to know everything?

177
00:22:00,883 --> 00:22:02,373
Please.

178
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:06,849
Well, all right.

179
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:11,582
He had these whips.

180
00:22:11,694 --> 00:22:16,791
This was in this castle in Austria
that he took me for vacation.

181
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:20,265
Well, he put me in a room,
and he locked the door.

182
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:23,236
Then he told me that if I made any
noise that he'd do something to me--

183
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:25,466
- something terrible.
- Wait just a minute.

184
00:22:25,575 --> 00:22:28,544
Whom are you talking about?

185
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:30,373
You're talking
about Stanford White!

186
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:38,547
No. No-- Stanny? Stanny would never
do anything like this.

187
00:22:38,654 --> 00:22:41,452
He was lovely. Lovely man.

188
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:43,582
He admired me--

189
00:22:43,693 --> 00:22:45,786
No, I'm talking about
Harry, my husband.

190
00:22:45,895 --> 00:22:49,331
Nonsense! My Harry would
never do anything like that.

191
00:22:49,432 --> 00:22:51,263
Just a minute, Mrs. Thaw.

192
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:55,736
- You say your husband did all this.
- Yes.

193
00:22:55,838 --> 00:22:59,638
He had a whip, a kind of a...

194
00:22:59,742 --> 00:23:02,540
dog whip, and he started
to beat me with it.

195
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:05,705
I fail to see what this has to
do with the defense of my son.

196
00:23:05,815 --> 00:23:09,114
Mrs. Thaw, you don't understand. We
have to prove your son was insane!

197
00:23:09,218 --> 00:23:11,778
My son is not insane!

198
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:14,117
Insane at the time
of the murder, Mrs. Thaw--

199
00:23:14,223 --> 00:23:18,125
I'm sorry. But there is
a world of difference.

200
00:23:18,227 --> 00:23:21,219
There's nothing wrong
with Harry.

201
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,525
All right, Mrs. Thaw.

202
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:25,533
That's fine.

203
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:28,695
Your son will be convicted
of murder in the first degree.

204
00:23:28,804 --> 00:23:31,238
He will be executed
accordingly...

205
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,367
and, if that's what you've hired me
to accomplish, I'm happy to oblige.

206
00:23:35,478 --> 00:23:37,605
He was perfectly all right
until he married her.

207
00:23:37,713 --> 00:23:39,704
She's the only thing
wrong with my son!

208
00:23:39,815 --> 00:23:42,613
Ha! That's a laugh!

209
00:23:42,718 --> 00:23:45,812
All right, stop it, both of you.
Stop it right now!

210
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,388
Mrs. Thaw, would you be kind enough
to leave me alone with Evelyn?

211
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:53,053
With pleasure, Mr. Delmas.

212
00:24:08,878 --> 00:24:12,541
You know, Evelyn,
Mrs. Thaw is a very generous woman.

213
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:15,883
Ha, that's another laugh.

214
00:24:18,954 --> 00:24:23,653
You don't really want to see
your husband electrocuted, do you?

215
00:24:28,064 --> 00:24:32,728
I guess not.
He is crazy, though, you know.

216
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:35,463
Mrs. Thaw is prepared to offer you
a substantial sum of money...

217
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:37,869
if you will
cooperate fully with us.

218
00:24:39,842 --> 00:24:41,400
What do you mean?

219
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,571
I mean, if you testify
as directed in court...

220
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:50,277
and if the trial ends successfully--
for us, that is--

221
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:52,354
you will agree to divorce him.

222
00:24:52,455 --> 00:24:55,219
Divorce Harry?
Are you kidding?

223
00:24:55,324 --> 00:24:58,384
Oh, there's a great deal
of money involved.

224
00:24:58,494 --> 00:25:00,291
Yeah?

225
00:25:00,396 --> 00:25:02,921
A great, great deal.

226
00:25:03,032 --> 00:25:05,626
How much?

227
00:25:05,735 --> 00:25:08,704
One million dollars.

228
00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:20,106
Now, you say that Mr. Stanford White
beat you with a whip?

229
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:22,241
Yes.

230
00:25:22,351 --> 00:25:24,581
A horsewhip.

231
00:25:31,494 --> 00:25:33,394
- A horsewhip?
- Yes.

232
00:25:33,496 --> 00:25:36,260
You say also he gave you a drink
that was drugged. Is that right?

233
00:25:36,365 --> 00:25:38,833
Yes.

234
00:25:40,536 --> 00:25:44,233
Was this before
or after the whipping?

235
00:25:59,655 --> 00:26:02,021
Well, I don't remember.

236
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,157
He wanted to have
his way with me...

237
00:26:06,262 --> 00:26:08,958
so he drugged me,
and then he whipped me.

238
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:12,599
Order! Order!

239
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:19,635
And you suddenly remembered
this horrible story...

240
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:23,303
decided to tell your husband
about it three years later...

241
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:29,214
on the night you knew he was most
likely to encounter Mr. White...

242
00:26:29,318 --> 00:26:32,151
at Madison Square Garden?

243
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,218
- Is that right?
- Yes.

244
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:42,029
No more questions,
Your Honor.

245
00:26:47,703 --> 00:26:49,762
Could you
stay behind that car?

246
00:27:35,684 --> 00:27:38,585
- What's the matter?
- It's not a pretty sight, ma'am.

247
00:27:58,107 --> 00:28:02,237
Missus. Here, here!
Missus, here! It's face cutting.

248
00:28:02,344 --> 00:28:06,405
Missus. Missus!
Come, please. Come!

249
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,517
If you wanted to see,
you have to see.

250
00:28:14,623 --> 00:28:16,523
Come.

251
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:23,896
- Yes, that's pretty.
- This cost about ten cents. Yeah?

252
00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:29,165
What can be cheaper? Missus,
very expensive. Make a discount.

253
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:32,766
Sit down.

254
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:36,402
Very pretty, huh?
You are very pretty.

255
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:39,242
- Thank you.
- This way, your body.

256
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:43,375
Go! It's good.
Down-- uh, to.

257
00:28:43,485 --> 00:28:46,079
It's good. Okay?

258
00:28:47,356 --> 00:28:49,256
Keep your face out.
This girl is my daughter.

259
00:28:49,358 --> 00:28:52,691
- She's beautiful.
- Please, like this.

260
00:28:52,795 --> 00:28:54,854
She's wonderful.

261
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:03,437
She's uh--
Please, keep your face.

262
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:05,973
She's, uh, wonderful.

263
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:13,475
- Why is she on a string?
- She's, uh, very beautiful, yes?

264
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:19,111
- Keep--
- Why is she tied up on a rope?

265
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:21,746
Why do you have her tied up?

266
00:29:21,857 --> 00:29:24,883
I have to be sure she will
be not kidnapped.

267
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:28,896
Will do her better
if she'll be connected with me.

268
00:29:30,165 --> 00:29:32,065
Keep your face.

269
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:34,567
- Hey!
- Go away, you.

270
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:38,071
- A word! A word, please!
- Go your own way.

271
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:42,507
- A very important word for you!
- Do you see I am very busy?

272
00:29:49,418 --> 00:29:53,047
I don't believe it.
Go your own way.

273
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:56,989
- We don't make up--
- Go away, huh?

274
00:29:57,092 --> 00:29:59,822
Will you go?
Will you go away?

275
00:29:59,928 --> 00:30:03,921
You see I make a business?
Go away! Go away!

276
00:30:17,146 --> 00:30:21,378
Do something for me--

277
00:30:21,483 --> 00:30:24,418
Only one five minute.
Only one--

278
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,784
one two minute.

279
00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:24,472
My God, my God!
What the hell you--

280
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:46,067
Katela, come. Come!

281
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:18,692
Where do you get
the chutzpah to judge me?

282
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:07,672
What do you give me?
Nothing but tsuris!

283
00:33:29,805 --> 00:33:33,263
Thank you, that was very nice.
We'll let you know.

284
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,275
Next.

285
00:33:38,981 --> 00:33:42,417
- What's your name?
- Coalhouse Walker, Jr.

286
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:48,053
- Where've you been playing?
- Oh, here and there.

287
00:33:50,225 --> 00:33:53,922
It's a band job, you know,
not a solo act.

288
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:56,259
If it's regular work,
I'm interested.

289
00:33:56,365 --> 00:33:58,424
Okay, let's hear you.

290
00:33:58,533 --> 00:34:00,433
Yes, sir.

291
00:35:07,903 --> 00:35:10,133
You know this book
what I have given you?

292
00:35:12,341 --> 00:35:14,605
We have a lack in money.

293
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,043
- Give me back this book.
- I like it very much.

294
00:35:18,146 --> 00:35:20,137
I make you another.

295
00:35:20,248 --> 00:35:23,081
-Just like this one?
- The same.

296
00:35:25,921 --> 00:35:28,151
- Promise?
- Promise.

297
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:30,918
If you give it to me,
I'll be proud with you, huh?

298
00:35:47,442 --> 00:35:50,673
Now try do it--
try do it myself.

299
00:35:53,648 --> 00:35:55,206
Oh, I see.

300
00:35:55,317 --> 00:35:56,511
Yeah.

301
00:35:56,618 --> 00:35:58,552
Do you like it?

302
00:35:58,653 --> 00:36:01,121
Well, it's very interesting.

303
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:07,457
- Where did you get this thing?
- I do it, alone, with my hands.

304
00:36:07,562 --> 00:36:11,396
- I've create.
- You got any others?

305
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:16,301
I can do more. I can do everything--
what do your heart desire.

306
00:36:16,405 --> 00:36:19,738
What do you want for this thing?

307
00:36:19,841 --> 00:36:21,399
All right.

308
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:26,777
I'll pay four dollars if you agree
not to take this anywhere else...

309
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:29,442
and 40 cents for each one
you make for me.

310
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:00,913
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
It's my pleasure to introduce...

311
00:37:01,016 --> 00:37:03,814
the newest and bluest member
of the Clef Club band...

312
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:05,784
Professor Coalhouse Walker, Jr.

313
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:07,115
Play!

314
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:56,201
Where is that man that usually
sells silhouettes here--

315
00:37:56,304 --> 00:37:58,898
you know, with the little girl?

316
00:37:59,007 --> 00:38:01,134
Oh, yes. Thank you.
This is it.

317
00:38:03,111 --> 00:38:05,443
Ma'am!

318
00:38:05,547 --> 00:38:08,209
Ma'am, I can't stop here.
We're blocking traffic.

319
00:38:08,316 --> 00:38:11,410
That's all right.
You can go back. I'll be back later.

320
00:39:03,305 --> 00:39:06,468
Please, please don't scream.
You don't have to be afraid.

321
00:39:06,575 --> 00:39:08,600
I am not going to hurt you.

322
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:11,941
Don't you move! You stay
right there! You stop! Stop!

323
00:39:12,047 --> 00:39:14,481
I'm not gonna hurt you,
I just--

324
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:18,110
I mean,
you probably think I'm a--

325
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,882
I don't know, but I'm not.
I'm a businessman.

326
00:39:20,989 --> 00:39:23,150
I design fireworks.

327
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,457
- This is my card.
- Don't come near me.

328
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,534
I actually work for my
brother-in-law. He owns the factory.

329
00:39:35,637 --> 00:39:38,606
But I'll be made a full partner
soon, and then when he retires...

330
00:39:38,707 --> 00:39:40,732
the company will go to me.

331
00:39:40,842 --> 00:39:44,938
We do flags, flag buntings...

332
00:39:45,046 --> 00:39:48,345
trims, trophies, medals--
anything for public occasions.

333
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:53,513
See where it says on the card
"consultants for public occasions."

334
00:39:53,622 --> 00:39:56,648
But fireworks is actually
our biggest line.

335
00:39:56,758 --> 00:39:59,420
Please take it.

336
00:40:11,373 --> 00:40:12,931
What do you want?

337
00:40:13,775 --> 00:40:17,211
Well, I want-- if you have
an evening free, I--

338
00:40:17,312 --> 00:40:22,773
I know you're very busy, but
if you do have an evening free...

339
00:40:22,884 --> 00:40:27,253
and you would
like to do-- go--

340
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:32,486
I would very much like
to escort you to something.

341
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:37,496
No, no, no, no.
Please keep it.

342
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,865
I have more.
So, what do you say?

343
00:40:43,938 --> 00:40:46,702
Are you some kind
of a lunatic now?

344
00:40:49,144 --> 00:40:52,739
I'm sorry.
I'm acting like one, aren't I?

345
00:40:52,847 --> 00:40:55,315
You should see me at the office.
I am really not like this.

346
00:40:56,685 --> 00:41:01,247
So, what do you say?
Do you have some free time?

347
00:41:04,626 --> 00:41:06,526
Well...

348
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,358
maybe.

349
00:41:10,465 --> 00:41:13,229
You are?
I mean, might be.

350
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:19,031
I mean, when?

351
00:41:20,842 --> 00:41:22,400
What about right now?

352
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:28,714
Right now? You mean--
Do you mean, just--

353
00:41:28,817 --> 00:41:31,251
Well, is there something wrong
with right now?

354
00:41:31,353 --> 00:41:34,652
No! No, no, no, no.
It's just--

355
00:41:34,756 --> 00:41:38,317
No. Nothing.
Now is fine.

356
00:41:40,495 --> 00:41:43,089
So...

357
00:41:43,198 --> 00:41:46,599
escort me something.

358
00:41:51,473 --> 00:41:55,773
Dear, we're going
to eat without him.

359
00:41:55,877 --> 00:41:58,243
Son, sit down.

360
00:41:58,346 --> 00:42:01,076
Come.
Everyone sit down.

361
00:42:09,824 --> 00:42:12,292
Don't worry, dear.
He'll be back.

362
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:19,057
If anybody should be worried,
it's me, isn't it? And I'm not.

363
00:42:21,336 --> 00:42:23,497
Yes.

364
00:42:23,605 --> 00:42:26,699
You know what he's like sometimes.
It's just his age.

365
00:42:26,808 --> 00:42:28,969
Everybody goes through this.

366
00:42:30,178 --> 00:42:31,736
Three days!

367
00:42:31,846 --> 00:42:34,542
He hasn't slept at home
in three days.

368
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,650
He hasn't even been at work.

369
00:42:39,821 --> 00:42:43,757
He hasn't had the courtesy to phone
and let us know if he's all right.

370
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:48,753
Has he been in touch with you?

371
00:42:49,831 --> 00:42:51,594
Wouldn't I have told you?

372
00:42:53,101 --> 00:42:55,160
I-- Yes.
Yes, you would.

373
00:42:58,606 --> 00:43:00,164
Let us bow our heads.

374
00:43:03,878 --> 00:43:07,780
For what we are about to receive,
dear Lord, we give thanks.

375
00:43:15,824 --> 00:43:18,588
- I'll get it.
- No. No, you stay right there.

376
00:43:21,963 --> 00:43:24,193
I'll take care of this.

377
00:43:35,176 --> 00:43:36,734
Good afternoon.

378
00:43:36,845 --> 00:43:39,643
I wonder if you might
be able to help me.

379
00:43:39,747 --> 00:43:41,840
What do you want?

380
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:44,680
Well, I'm looking for
a young woman of color called Sarah.

381
00:43:44,786 --> 00:43:46,686
I'm told she was
taken in to this house.

382
00:43:48,189 --> 00:43:49,417
Who are you?

383
00:43:49,524 --> 00:43:52,687
Oh, I'm sorry.
My name is Coalhouse Walker, Jr.

384
00:43:53,828 --> 00:43:59,562
- Are you a relative?
- I wouldn't exactly say that.

385
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:04,366
Well, what shall I tell her
is the reason for your visit?

386
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,498
Just tell her that Mr. Walker would
like to have a word with her.

387
00:44:09,611 --> 00:44:12,011
Would you please
wait around the back?

388
00:44:22,323 --> 00:44:25,622
There's a colored gentleman
downstairs.

389
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,388
He wants to have
a word with you.

390
00:44:31,299 --> 00:44:35,895
Well, I think you'd better
go down and talk to him.

391
00:44:41,209 --> 00:44:43,939
- Are you going to go down?
- No, sir.

392
00:44:44,045 --> 00:44:48,539
Well, that's
not very good, is it?

393
00:44:50,018 --> 00:44:52,816
But the man seems to have
some connection with you...

394
00:44:52,921 --> 00:44:55,151
and I think I'd like
to know what it is.

395
00:45:01,996 --> 00:45:04,760
Dear, she doesn't want
to talk to him.

396
00:45:05,934 --> 00:45:07,834
I see.

397
00:45:09,537 --> 00:45:12,199
And I suppose that's the end of it?
Would--

398
00:45:14,008 --> 00:45:16,340
I-- Yes, yes.

399
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:23,749
You're just as sweet
as you can be.

400
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:25,978
Yes, you are.

401
00:45:26,087 --> 00:45:27,645
That's my child.

402
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:33,920
Excuse me, but I don't believe
anyone invited you in.

403
00:45:35,096 --> 00:45:37,929
This is my child.

404
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:40,657
This is a cute little devil,
isn't he?

405
00:45:44,272 --> 00:45:47,605
- It is a boy, isn't it?
- Yes.

406
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:51,804
So you're the father.

407
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:55,176
Yeah.

408
00:45:55,283 --> 00:45:58,218
- Where's Sarah?
- She doesn't want to see you.

409
00:46:01,823 --> 00:46:05,350
Stubborn woman, Sarah.
Very stubborn.

410
00:46:07,261 --> 00:46:11,459
Well, you tell her
I'll be back real soon.

411
00:46:11,566 --> 00:46:13,056
Okay?

412
00:46:13,167 --> 00:46:16,000
And my apologies for the intrusion.
Good afternoon.

413
00:46:25,246 --> 00:46:26,804
All rise!

414
00:46:54,609 --> 00:46:56,941
Gentlemen of the jury...

415
00:46:57,045 --> 00:46:58,910
have you come to a verdict?

416
00:46:59,013 --> 00:47:01,709
Yes, Your Honor, we have.

417
00:47:03,951 --> 00:47:07,751
We find the defendant not guilty
of murder in the first degree...

418
00:47:07,855 --> 00:47:10,221
by reason of insanity.

419
00:47:15,363 --> 00:47:17,763
I'm crazy?

420
00:47:17,865 --> 00:47:19,765
Goddamn it,
they think I'm crazy!

421
00:47:19,867 --> 00:47:23,098
Mr. Thaw,
will you please stand?

422
00:47:28,543 --> 00:47:30,272
You have heard the verdict.

423
00:47:31,879 --> 00:47:33,574
Normally,
in such a case as this...

424
00:47:33,681 --> 00:47:36,115
the bench would retire.

425
00:47:36,217 --> 00:47:39,050
But I think in this instance...

426
00:47:39,153 --> 00:47:41,417
I would have to be
out of my mind...

427
00:47:41,522 --> 00:47:44,286
not to recommend that you be
sent to the asylum...

428
00:47:44,392 --> 00:47:46,917
for the criminally insane
at Matteawan...

429
00:47:47,028 --> 00:47:50,964
until such time as duly
constituted medical opinion...

430
00:47:51,065 --> 00:47:56,059
determines that you are no longer
dangerous to the public at large.

431
00:47:59,674 --> 00:48:01,665
Order. Order.

432
00:48:02,777 --> 00:48:07,180
Mr. Thaw,
do you have anything to say?

433
00:48:17,158 --> 00:48:21,527
This whole trial
has been a fiasco.

434
00:48:21,629 --> 00:48:27,124
Mr. Thaw, please limit your remarks
to the statement I have just made.

435
00:48:27,235 --> 00:48:30,398
No, listen to me.
No, no.

436
00:48:30,505 --> 00:48:33,235
I'm as sane
as any man in this room!

437
00:48:37,111 --> 00:48:38,874
You're the ones
that are insane!

438
00:48:39,981 --> 00:48:42,347
This case is closed.

439
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:47,353
You heard the testimony! She was
1 6 years old! He drugged her!

440
00:48:47,455 --> 00:48:48,854
God, he ruined my wife!

441
00:48:49,957 --> 00:48:52,255
He whipped her, for God's sake!

442
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,352
She was 1 6 years old!

443
00:48:55,463 --> 00:48:58,557
The man was a beast!
You should thank me!

444
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:01,191
Where's your sense of morality?

445
00:49:02,436 --> 00:49:04,165
I did the law a favor!

446
00:49:34,068 --> 00:49:38,027
It's right over there!
Look at that!

447
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,931
- So what should I do?
- Nothing! Absolutely nothing.

448
00:50:09,036 --> 00:50:11,527
- We will do everything for you.
- We'll take care of it all.

449
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:15,700
- You'll teach me routines?
- He is the dance teacher.

450
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:18,904
- He's the manager!
- No, no, I am the manager.

451
00:50:19,013 --> 00:50:20,947
He is the dance instructor.

452
00:50:21,048 --> 00:50:24,074
This is your agent,
and he is your lawyer.

453
00:50:24,185 --> 00:50:28,087
All of us for one person,
for Evelyn.

454
00:50:28,189 --> 00:50:30,919
- That's all we care about.
- This little piggy went to market.

455
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:34,552
This little piggy went home.
This little piggy had roast beef...

456
00:50:34,662 --> 00:50:36,152
and this little piggy--

457
00:50:37,298 --> 00:50:41,462
this little piggy
went wee-wee-wee-wee...

458
00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:43,799
all the way to the bank!

459
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,657
Oh, sweetheart!

460
00:51:07,762 --> 00:51:10,322
Where have you been?

461
00:51:10,431 --> 00:51:11,864
I'm so--

462
00:51:11,966 --> 00:51:14,059
- Oh, you waited for me.
- Yes.

463
00:51:14,168 --> 00:51:17,137
You waited for me
all this time.

464
00:51:22,643 --> 00:51:25,612
- What were their names?
- What?

465
00:51:25,713 --> 00:51:28,614
- Sorry. What were their names?
- Whose names?

466
00:51:28,716 --> 00:51:31,116
The names of the people you just
spent the evening with.

467
00:51:36,057 --> 00:51:38,287
- I forget!
- What?

468
00:51:38,392 --> 00:51:41,828
- I can't remember.
- Evelyn...

469
00:51:41,929 --> 00:51:46,127
these people are deciding your
future, and you forgot their names?

470
00:51:49,203 --> 00:51:51,569
Sweetheart.

471
00:51:51,672 --> 00:51:54,436
- Will you open the champagne?
- Sure.

472
00:51:54,542 --> 00:51:59,912
I'll be right back. One's an agent,
one's a lawyer, one's a manager.

473
00:52:00,014 --> 00:52:02,141
I don't know.
They're so cute.

474
00:52:02,249 --> 00:52:03,580
They're just adorable.

475
00:52:03,684 --> 00:52:06,881
You know what I think you should do?
You should find out their names...

476
00:52:06,988 --> 00:52:11,448
and then I'll have my lawyers
check to see if they're legitimate.

477
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:13,993
Evelyn, are you listening?

478
00:52:16,464 --> 00:52:19,991
You can't be too careful
just now, you know.

479
00:52:20,101 --> 00:52:24,333
You never know when someone might
try to take advantage of you.

480
00:52:24,438 --> 00:52:26,565
Whoops!

481
00:52:26,674 --> 00:52:29,472
All my clothes went away.

482
00:52:40,621 --> 00:52:43,249
Sorry to interrupt.
It's unfortunate timing, I know...

483
00:52:43,357 --> 00:52:47,191
but we had no choice,
as you'll see when you read this.

484
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:50,388
Now, uh, look it over,
and sign at the bottom.

485
00:52:50,498 --> 00:52:53,763
If there's anything you don't
understand, just feel free to ask.

486
00:52:53,868 --> 00:52:58,305
Gentlemen, this is a private
residence, and your presence here--

487
00:52:58,406 --> 00:53:02,103
Shh! Now, wait a minute!
Stop! What is this?

488
00:53:03,377 --> 00:53:06,972
- What's that, Mrs. Thaw?
- Number four.

489
00:53:07,081 --> 00:53:10,278
"In compensation for my agreeing
to divorce Mr. Harold K. Thaw...

490
00:53:10,384 --> 00:53:13,581
I shall receive a sum
of $25,000"? What's that?

491
00:53:13,687 --> 00:53:15,712
I think that's clear enough.

492
00:53:19,393 --> 00:53:22,055
They are not pulling
that one on me.

493
00:53:24,565 --> 00:53:26,465
I'm getting a million
or forget it.

494
00:53:26,567 --> 00:53:28,467
You were there when they said
I'd get a million.

495
00:53:28,569 --> 00:53:32,403
That was when you were
suing him for divorce.

496
00:53:32,506 --> 00:53:36,340
It's quite a different matter
now that you're an adulteress...

497
00:53:37,678 --> 00:53:39,578
and he is suing you.

498
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,614
What-- Harry suing me
for divorce?

499
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:45,075
Mr. Thaw is no longer
mentally competent.

500
00:53:45,186 --> 00:53:47,484
His mother is making
his decisions now.

501
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:52,654
I saved his life, damn it!

502
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:58,130
If I hadn't testified, he would have
gone to the electric chair!

503
00:53:58,232 --> 00:54:01,429
I would have been a widow
with all of his money!

504
00:54:01,535 --> 00:54:04,698
- She knows that!
- Mrs. Thaw--

505
00:54:04,805 --> 00:54:08,366
I earned that million dollars!
I want a million dollars!

506
00:54:08,476 --> 00:54:12,810
Mrs. Thaw, adultery is a serious
charge in a divorce proceeding.

507
00:54:12,913 --> 00:54:16,405
If you sign this now,
you'll get $25,000...

508
00:54:16,517 --> 00:54:18,610
and the divorce'll be
handled very quickly.

509
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,086
If you don't sign it, chances are
you'll wind up with nothing at all.

510
00:54:22,189 --> 00:54:25,716
Now, you've got five minutes
to make up your mind.

511
00:54:25,826 --> 00:54:28,386
I don't know
what this is all about...

512
00:54:28,496 --> 00:54:32,227
but I do know that what you are
doing here is completely illegal.

513
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:36,702
This is trespassing, improper
serving of legal documents...

514
00:54:36,804 --> 00:54:39,068
and before it goes any further,
I think you should leave.

515
00:54:39,173 --> 00:54:41,869
And I will have my lawyers
contact you in the morning.

516
00:54:41,976 --> 00:54:44,206
Well, who's got a pen?

517
00:54:45,579 --> 00:54:48,912
Evelyn, don't. Don't sign it.
You don't have to.

518
00:54:49,016 --> 00:54:51,678
- I'll get my lawyers to handle it.
- When do I get the money?

519
00:54:51,785 --> 00:54:54,948
It's right here-- cash.

520
00:55:11,939 --> 00:55:15,067
Sorry to interrupt.
Good night.

521
00:55:22,283 --> 00:55:24,342
This is incredible.

522
00:55:25,953 --> 00:55:28,080
You shouldn't have signed it,
Evelyn. You shouldn't have.

523
00:55:28,189 --> 00:55:29,417
Honey...

524
00:55:29,523 --> 00:55:32,390
I don't want to have
anything to do with them anymore.

525
00:55:32,493 --> 00:55:36,725
That whole family has been
all over my back for years!

526
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:38,764
Now I have the money.
I just want to forget it.

527
00:55:38,866 --> 00:55:42,927
- But they are using you.
- So we're even.

528
00:55:43,037 --> 00:55:45,267
Look, I can't let you
do this to yourself.

529
00:55:45,372 --> 00:55:50,139
You have to have competent legal
advice from people you can trust.

530
00:55:50,244 --> 00:55:51,302
Like who?

531
00:55:51,412 --> 00:55:53,141
I'll get my company's
lawyers to handle it.

532
00:55:53,247 --> 00:55:55,306
There has to be
something we can do.

533
00:55:55,416 --> 00:55:57,976
Oh, all right.
I'll meet them. When?

534
00:56:00,454 --> 00:56:02,285
Good.

535
00:56:03,991 --> 00:56:06,050
Well, now--

536
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,458
the actual legal side
of the company...

537
00:56:08,562 --> 00:56:11,156
is really more in the hands
of my brother-in-law.

538
00:56:11,265 --> 00:56:15,497
So what I think we should do is
I'll consult with him.

539
00:56:15,603 --> 00:56:20,836
No. You know what might be
a better idea?

540
00:56:20,941 --> 00:56:22,465
I could introduce you to him.

541
00:56:23,877 --> 00:56:26,437
You could come to our house
for dinner one night.

542
00:56:26,547 --> 00:56:31,280
- I'd love you to meet my sister.
- Well, that sounds fine.

543
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:36,017
- You mean you'll come for dinner?
- Sure. Why not?

544
00:56:36,123 --> 00:56:39,149
I mean,
we live in New Rochelle.

545
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,524
Well, that's okay.

546
00:56:52,806 --> 00:56:54,706
They're not gonna
believe this.

547
00:57:12,259 --> 00:57:15,990
- Where is the young lady?
- Well, obviously she isn't here.

548
00:57:19,967 --> 00:57:22,026
Let's eat.

549
00:57:22,136 --> 00:57:25,071
Oh, please, please,
let's just eat.

550
00:57:34,248 --> 00:57:37,151
Aren't we going to get
any kind of explanation?

551
00:57:37,251 --> 00:57:40,186
Well, I really don't want
to talk about it.

552
00:57:42,056 --> 00:57:44,217
I'm afraid that's
not good enough.

553
00:57:44,325 --> 00:57:47,783
I don't want to talk about it, and
if anyone asks another question...

554
00:57:47,895 --> 00:57:50,022
I am just going to leave.

555
00:57:52,032 --> 00:57:53,499
I don't understand.

556
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,261
You create this mystery.

557
00:57:55,369 --> 00:57:59,499
You don't tell us
who this young lady is.

558
00:57:59,606 --> 00:58:02,769
You build up everyone's
expectations. It's very...

559
00:58:05,279 --> 00:58:07,577
disappointing.

560
00:58:07,681 --> 00:58:10,912
Well, I'm disappointed,
too, sir, you know.

561
00:58:11,018 --> 00:58:13,987
Did you ever think of that?
I'm disappointed too.

562
00:58:14,088 --> 00:58:17,023
Why don't you ring
for the soup, dear?

563
00:58:23,897 --> 00:58:25,922
Brigit! Soup.

564
00:58:35,976 --> 00:58:37,876
Yes.

565
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,784
I'll get it.

566
00:58:58,198 --> 00:59:02,066
Dear, Mr. Walker's here
to see Sarah.

567
00:59:02,169 --> 00:59:05,730
I told him he could wait in the
drawing room while I go speak to her.

568
00:59:09,877 --> 00:59:11,435
Who's that?

569
00:59:11,545 --> 00:59:12,944
The baby's father.

570
00:59:13,947 --> 00:59:15,414
Or so he says.

571
00:59:16,283 --> 00:59:18,114
Would you mind
bringing her these?

572
00:59:18,218 --> 00:59:20,118
There's a little note on there.

573
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,781
Oh, they're so beautiful.
Be right back.

574
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:39,635
Excuse me.

575
00:59:44,478 --> 00:59:47,379
Your piano's badly
in need of a tuning.

576
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:50,211
You ought to take better care
of an instrument like this.

577
00:59:50,317 --> 00:59:52,911
Would you mind
closing the piano?

578
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:58,485
Sit down, Mr. Walker.

579
01:00:00,427 --> 01:00:03,362
There are a few things
I'd like to ask you.

580
01:00:17,611 --> 01:00:20,239
Sarah, just say hello to him.

581
01:00:20,347 --> 01:00:23,180
Nothing can happen to you.
You're safe here.

582
01:00:23,283 --> 01:00:26,514
There can't be any harm
in just talking to him.

583
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:29,180
Oh, yes, it is.
Yes, it is.

584
01:00:29,289 --> 01:00:32,156
- Why?
- He say one thing...

585
01:00:32,259 --> 01:00:34,227
and then he say another thing.

586
01:00:34,328 --> 01:00:37,456
And he make it
all sound so good.

587
01:00:37,564 --> 01:00:42,001
It ain't nothin' but talk, ma'am.
It ain't nothin' but talk.

588
01:00:42,102 --> 01:00:44,161
I can marry Sarah...

589
01:00:44,271 --> 01:00:46,535
and I will,
soon as she'll have me.

590
01:00:48,342 --> 01:00:50,708
I couldn't before,
and now I can.

591
01:00:50,811 --> 01:00:52,938
That's very fancy reasoning,
Mr. Walker...

592
01:00:53,046 --> 01:00:56,777
but what it comes down to
is that you behaved abominably.

593
01:00:56,884 --> 01:01:00,945
I wasn't living any kind of life I
could ask a woman to share with me--

594
01:01:01,054 --> 01:01:02,646
playing in beer halls...

595
01:01:02,756 --> 01:01:05,281
moving-picture houses.

596
01:01:05,392 --> 01:01:07,952
Some of those places aren't
even safe for a man to be in.

597
01:01:08,061 --> 01:01:09,722
So you just abandoned her?

598
01:01:10,764 --> 01:01:13,324
That's how you handle
your responsibilities?

599
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:18,770
What kind of music do you play?

600
01:01:21,608 --> 01:01:24,941
Anything they ask me to,
and then I play ragtime.

601
01:01:26,313 --> 01:01:29,771
Well, we have some music here.
Could you give us a tune?

602
01:01:32,185 --> 01:01:34,449
Maybe some other time.

603
01:01:35,656 --> 01:01:39,717
I think what Mr. Walker's trying to
say is that he doesn't read music.

604
01:01:39,826 --> 01:01:41,225
Am I right, Mr. Walker?

605
01:01:43,463 --> 01:01:46,398
I read music so good,
white folks think I'm fakin' it.

606
01:03:35,876 --> 01:03:37,044
No, no. Please, please,
please don't get up.

607
01:03:37,044 --> 01:03:38,272
No, no. Please, please,
please don't get up.

608
01:03:38,378 --> 01:03:40,608
Are you all free next weekend?

609
01:03:41,815 --> 01:03:44,340
I'd like you to be
at the wedding.

610
01:03:44,451 --> 01:03:46,419
What?

611
01:03:47,788 --> 01:03:49,346
Sarah's accepted my hand.

612
01:03:50,457 --> 01:03:52,618
After all you've done for her...

613
01:03:52,726 --> 01:03:55,354
it wouldn't be much of a wedding
if you all weren't there.

614
01:03:55,462 --> 01:03:58,022
Now, I hope you'll accept.

615
01:04:00,734 --> 01:04:03,066
No, no, no,
don't bother yourself now.

616
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:06,071
I have to go now 'cause
it's a long drive back.

617
01:04:06,173 --> 01:04:08,368
I'll see you next Sunday.

618
01:04:38,705 --> 01:04:40,434
And ladylike.

619
01:04:43,009 --> 01:04:45,603
That's it.
And around we go.

620
01:04:45,712 --> 01:04:47,202
And around.

621
01:04:49,116 --> 01:04:51,175
Beautiful.
Now the horsey.

622
01:04:53,353 --> 01:04:55,082
Now another horsey.

623
01:04:55,188 --> 01:04:56,746
And a peekaboo.

624
01:05:01,995 --> 01:05:03,326
There we are.

625
01:05:06,233 --> 01:05:07,700
Quiet, please! Quiet!

626
01:05:07,801 --> 01:05:10,668
Evelyn, I have something
very important to say to you.

627
01:05:10,771 --> 01:05:13,797
You know what this guy
is talking about?

628
01:05:13,907 --> 01:05:15,875
Okay, five minutes.

629
01:05:22,282 --> 01:05:25,183
You moved. You didn't tell me
where you were going.

630
01:05:25,285 --> 01:05:27,583
I was evicted.
It wasn't my fault.

631
01:05:27,687 --> 01:05:30,212
You said you'd come to dinner.
How was I supposed to find you?

632
01:05:31,091 --> 01:05:33,753
Did I do something wrong?
What did I do wrong? Just tell me.

633
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:36,658
- Not now, sweetheart.
- Yes, now!

634
01:05:36,763 --> 01:05:38,492
I want an explanation.

635
01:05:41,168 --> 01:05:43,102
I can't think
about this right now.

636
01:05:43,203 --> 01:05:46,661
- I've got a lot on my mind.
- Well, so do I.

637
01:05:46,773 --> 01:05:49,241
I'm trying to do well
in the firm.

638
01:05:49,342 --> 01:05:50,866
I try so hard.

639
01:05:50,977 --> 01:05:54,777
And sometimes everything seems to be
going fine, and then I don't know.

640
01:05:54,881 --> 01:05:58,112
I don't know what's wrong with me.
It just all falls apart.

641
01:05:58,218 --> 01:06:01,676
I can't even walk
down the street...

642
01:06:01,788 --> 01:06:05,383
without being afraid
that somebody's gonna talk to me.

643
01:06:06,726 --> 01:06:09,058
I need you to be with me.

644
01:06:09,162 --> 01:06:12,188
- You have to, Evelyn.
- Darling, that's it. Back to work.

645
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,290
I've gotta go.

646
01:06:15,402 --> 01:06:18,303
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

647
01:06:18,405 --> 01:06:20,635
That's not very nice, mister.
The lady wants to go.

648
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,640
You don't know what kind
of pressure I've been under.

649
01:06:22,742 --> 01:06:25,142
- I can't do anything about that.
- Yes, you can!

650
01:06:25,245 --> 01:06:29,443
- I just want to know where you live.
- Let go of my arm!

651
01:06:29,549 --> 01:06:32,074
Goddamn it!
I'm not talking to you!

652
01:06:32,185 --> 01:06:34,813
This is none of
your goddamn business!

653
01:06:34,921 --> 01:06:39,017
- This is none of your business!
- Take it easy. Take it easy.

654
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:34,476
Excuse me.

655
01:07:36,917 --> 01:07:39,249
Could you tell me how long
that'll be standing there?

656
01:07:40,787 --> 01:07:42,186
How's that?

657
01:07:42,289 --> 01:07:43,847
I have to pass by.

658
01:07:46,092 --> 01:07:47,684
Well...

659
01:07:47,794 --> 01:07:49,625
you got your toll?

660
01:07:51,598 --> 01:07:54,931
Toll? There's no toll
on this road.

661
01:07:55,035 --> 01:07:56,468
Sure, there is.

662
01:07:56,569 --> 01:07:59,197
This here's a private toll road.
Ain't it, fellas?

663
01:08:03,276 --> 01:08:05,176
I've used this road
several times...

664
01:08:05,278 --> 01:08:07,678
and I've never had
to pay a toll.

665
01:08:07,781 --> 01:08:11,717
Well, somebody must've
been sleeping on duty.

666
01:08:18,325 --> 01:08:21,488
All right.
How much is the toll?

667
01:08:23,163 --> 01:08:24,391
Willie?

668
01:08:30,103 --> 01:08:32,230
How much is the toll today?

669
01:08:40,347 --> 01:08:42,542
What's that, a Model T?

670
01:08:44,317 --> 01:08:46,046
Who you driving it for?

671
01:08:46,152 --> 01:08:48,416
It's my automobile.

672
01:08:48,521 --> 01:08:50,079
I own it.

673
01:08:51,591 --> 01:08:53,923
My God.

674
01:08:54,027 --> 01:08:55,688
Don't that beat all?

675
01:08:56,863 --> 01:08:58,592
How much is the toll?

676
01:08:58,698 --> 01:09:00,097
The toll.

677
01:09:02,202 --> 01:09:04,500
Let's see. Today is Sunday.

678
01:09:04,604 --> 01:09:06,071
Twenty-five dollars.

679
01:09:10,176 --> 01:09:13,407
We're trying to raise a little cash
for a fire wagon with an engine.

680
01:09:13,513 --> 01:09:17,040
Hell, we want to drive
to our fires in style...

681
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:19,618
just like you drive
to your cathouses.

682
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:59,190
Has he got the nigger
with him?

683
01:10:01,861 --> 01:10:03,920
Hey, Frankie.

684
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:07,431
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Where is my car?

685
01:10:09,302 --> 01:10:10,701
Is that it?

686
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:18,910
All right.
Let's just forget about it.

687
01:10:19,012 --> 01:10:20,741
Go get your car.

688
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:25,612
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

689
01:10:25,718 --> 01:10:29,347
- Deal the cards. Let's go.
- How many? I call. Let's go.

690
01:10:29,456 --> 01:10:30,855
Come on.

691
01:10:33,393 --> 01:10:34,792
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

692
01:10:34,894 --> 01:10:37,294
Ain't you got enough fires
to keep you busy, Willie?

693
01:10:37,397 --> 01:10:38,921
What's gotten into you?

694
01:10:39,032 --> 01:10:41,796
- Nobody around here can take a joke.
- Officer!

695
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:46,095
Could you please come here
and look at this?

696
01:11:07,594 --> 01:11:10,222
- That smells.
- I want this cleaned up.

697
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:13,231
Oh, I don't blame ya.

698
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:15,233
It's a hell of a shame.

699
01:11:16,669 --> 01:11:19,604
- Brand-new car like that.
- I want it cleaned up.

700
01:11:19,706 --> 01:11:21,606
Go ahead. Clean it up.

701
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:23,608
Can it, Willie.
Nobody's laughing.

702
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:26,611
What the hell do you boys
think you're up to?

703
01:11:26,713 --> 01:11:29,511
I'll tell you exactly
what happened, Frankie.

704
01:11:29,616 --> 01:11:32,244
This here fancy nigger parked
in front of the firehouse.

705
01:11:32,352 --> 01:11:35,253
Now, if you don't think
that's a serious business...

706
01:11:35,355 --> 01:11:38,256
tell me about it when your house is
burning, we can't get the pump out...

707
01:11:38,358 --> 01:11:41,088
and the road's all blocked
because of a nigger's car.

708
01:11:41,194 --> 01:11:44,095
I had no intention of stopping
in front of the firehouse...

709
01:11:44,197 --> 01:11:46,358
but my way was blocked.

710
01:11:46,466 --> 01:11:49,731
I don't know why you did this.
I never caused you any harm.

711
01:11:50,837 --> 01:11:53,067
You blocked access
to an emergency service...

712
01:11:53,173 --> 01:11:55,141
and I got witnesses here
to prove it!

713
01:11:55,241 --> 01:11:57,368
You're lying.

714
01:11:57,477 --> 01:12:00,378
- Willie, no!
- Don't you say that to me!

715
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,412
Nigger!

716
01:12:01,514 --> 01:12:03,311
Come on, come on, come on.

717
01:12:03,416 --> 01:12:05,384
Over here. Right there.

718
01:12:09,155 --> 01:12:10,383
Look.

719
01:12:11,958 --> 01:12:13,858
There ain't no real damage done.

720
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:16,360
Just... scoop the shit off...

721
01:12:16,462 --> 01:12:18,430
take your automobile,
and get along.

722
01:12:18,531 --> 01:12:19,930
What do you say?

723
01:12:22,702 --> 01:12:25,762
I'm not goin' nowhere
until my car is cleaned.

724
01:12:25,872 --> 01:12:28,932
I don't want no trouble.
Just do as I say.

725
01:12:30,543 --> 01:12:33,103
- You know I'm telling the truth.
-Just get in your car--

726
01:12:33,213 --> 01:12:35,272
Why are you letting
these men intimidate you?

727
01:12:35,381 --> 01:12:37,440
Nobody's intimidating me, mister!

728
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:39,450
You just don't know
what you're getting into...

729
01:12:39,552 --> 01:12:41,452
and I'm trying to keep
your nose clean.

730
01:12:41,554 --> 01:12:44,546
Would you be a good boy
and just get along!

731
01:12:44,657 --> 01:12:47,217
I want my car cleaned.

732
01:12:47,327 --> 01:12:49,386
Clean it then, damn you!
Clean it and go!

733
01:12:49,495 --> 01:12:51,793
I want the man who did it
to clean it!

734
01:12:51,898 --> 01:12:54,890
All right. All right.
Let me put it this way.

735
01:12:55,001 --> 01:12:58,402
I can arrest you for blocking
a public service exit...

736
01:12:58,504 --> 01:13:00,233
for creating a public nuisance...

737
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:02,740
and about ten other things that
I ain't gonna bother to mention.

738
01:13:02,842 --> 01:13:04,776
Am I making myself clear?

739
01:13:06,779 --> 01:13:08,178
- Yes.
- Good.

740
01:13:08,281 --> 01:13:10,511
Officer...

741
01:13:10,617 --> 01:13:13,677
- I still want my car cleaned.
- Oh, for Christ's sakes.

742
01:13:13,786 --> 01:13:17,244
Ain't you got any sense in your head?
I'm trying to help you.

743
01:13:20,793 --> 01:13:22,693
You leave me no choice.

744
01:13:25,098 --> 01:13:26,588
I'm sorry.

745
01:13:28,701 --> 01:13:30,328
You're under arrest.

746
01:13:39,212 --> 01:13:41,271
- It's all right.
- Yes, sir.

747
01:13:41,381 --> 01:13:42,780
Yes?

748
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,119
Yes.

749
01:13:51,357 --> 01:13:53,416
I see. I'll be right down.

750
01:14:04,003 --> 01:14:06,335
Better be getting yourself
some new help.

751
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:10,771
Once a nigger goes wrong,
there's no putting him right.

752
01:14:22,355 --> 01:14:23,913
Thank you, sir.

753
01:14:35,535 --> 01:14:37,833
Whoa! Whoa!

754
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:47,943
What happened? You said there
wasn't any physical damage done.

755
01:14:48,047 --> 01:14:50,106
There wasn't
when I was arrested.

756
01:14:53,319 --> 01:14:57,278
This is what I was saying.
You should have cleaned it up.

757
01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:59,187
Now look what's happened.

758
01:15:00,827 --> 01:15:03,660
Well, the damage
isn't that bad.

759
01:15:03,763 --> 01:15:07,529
It shouldn't take much
to put it right.

760
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:10,101
Please, if you would be kind enough
to tell Sarah what happened...

761
01:15:10,203 --> 01:15:12,103
but tell her not to worry.

762
01:15:12,205 --> 01:15:15,766
And tell her that I'll be
talking with her soon.

763
01:15:17,377 --> 01:15:19,106
Wait a minute! Stop!

764
01:15:21,481 --> 01:15:23,312
I'm talking to you.

765
01:15:23,416 --> 01:15:25,247
Yes?

766
01:15:25,351 --> 01:15:29,151
Well, you can't just leave
this out here all night, you know.

767
01:15:29,255 --> 01:15:31,314
You don't know
who's gonna come along.

768
01:15:31,424 --> 01:15:33,324
It's a little late
for that kind of thinking...

769
01:15:33,426 --> 01:15:36,395
and I have to work tonight.
Good afternoon.

770
01:15:36,496 --> 01:15:39,431
That is not a very helpful
attitude, Mr. Walker.

771
01:15:41,501 --> 01:15:44,163
We're trying to help you,
you know.

772
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:47,797
I've spent a lot of time trying
to get this business cleared up...

773
01:15:47,907 --> 01:15:48,941
not to mention money.

774
01:15:48,941 --> 01:15:50,101
not to mention money.

775
01:15:50,209 --> 01:15:53,440
I think we should work out
exactly what we're going to do now.

776
01:15:55,114 --> 01:15:58,049
I haven't decided yet.

777
01:15:58,151 --> 01:15:59,550
Good afternoon.

778
01:16:08,094 --> 01:16:10,688
Well, what's your
financial situation like?

779
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,558
I have a little laid by.

780
01:16:15,668 --> 01:16:18,694
I planned to use it on my wedding,
but I guess it'll have to wait.

781
01:16:20,506 --> 01:16:22,906
Mr. Walker, let me
give you some advice.

782
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:26,101
You spend the money
on your wedding.

783
01:16:26,212 --> 01:16:30,239
Build yourself a home and a family
where you can find some comfort.

784
01:16:30,349 --> 01:16:34,251
And just forget that some damn
white man caused you offense.

785
01:16:36,355 --> 01:16:37,947
And that's your advice?

786
01:16:39,559 --> 01:16:42,858
That's my advice, and I pray
you take it to heart.

787
01:16:42,962 --> 01:16:45,157
"Just forget it"?
Is that it?

788
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,259
I've spent my whole life
forgetting.

789
01:16:49,368 --> 01:16:52,735
You're a young man.
You better start learning now.

790
01:16:52,839 --> 01:16:56,070
Learning what--
how to be a nigger?

791
01:17:01,447 --> 01:17:04,109
Mr. Walker,
I'll thank you to leave.

792
01:17:04,217 --> 01:17:07,414
I have some charity cases
you know nothing of.

793
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,954
I got clients
with real problems--

794
01:17:10,056 --> 01:17:12,718
starvation, illness...

795
01:17:12,825 --> 01:17:14,816
dispossession.

796
01:17:14,927 --> 01:17:18,522
Yes, I want justice for our people.
Yes, I do.

797
01:17:18,631 --> 01:17:20,895
I want it so bad,
I can taste it.

798
01:17:22,001 --> 01:17:24,231
If you think I'll go
to Westchester County...

799
01:17:24,337 --> 01:17:26,271
pleading on the behalf
of a colored man...

800
01:17:26,372 --> 01:17:28,431
that somebody dirtied
his fancy car...

801
01:17:28,541 --> 01:17:32,068
you are very much mistaken.

802
01:17:32,178 --> 01:17:35,670
Now, please, you take this...

803
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:37,578
and leave my office.

804
01:17:42,288 --> 01:17:44,415
I'm afraid you can't file
a complaint...

805
01:17:44,524 --> 01:17:46,424
against a volunteer fireman.

806
01:17:46,526 --> 01:17:47,788
Why not?

807
01:17:48,861 --> 01:17:51,261
Because they're not
an employee of the city.

808
01:17:51,364 --> 01:17:54,424
We have no jurisdiction
over them.

809
01:17:54,534 --> 01:17:56,798
Well, then whose jurisdiction
are they under?

810
01:17:59,572 --> 01:18:01,039
Well, they got it wrong.

811
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:03,074
You're gonna have to go back
to the police department...

812
01:18:03,175 --> 01:18:06,406
and tell them I said you should
file your complaint with them.

813
01:18:06,512 --> 01:18:08,480
That's instructions
from the county clerk.

814
01:18:08,581 --> 01:18:11,948
I don't care what they told you
at the county clerk's office.

815
01:18:12,051 --> 01:18:14,952
Then tell me what
I'm supposed to do.

816
01:18:15,054 --> 01:18:18,581
Just explain to me exactly
how I should go about it.

817
01:18:18,691 --> 01:18:21,091
The first thing you can do
is go to the county clerk...

818
01:18:21,193 --> 01:18:23,388
and tell the son of a bitch
not to send you back here!

819
01:18:27,366 --> 01:18:28,924
Now, listen.

820
01:18:29,035 --> 01:18:32,937
All I'm saying is that I want you
to talk to Mr. Walker.

821
01:18:34,273 --> 01:18:35,831
I did.

822
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:41,471
He got hisself all crazy
over this thing.

823
01:18:43,416 --> 01:18:47,079
He ain't got no time
for me now.

824
01:18:47,186 --> 01:18:50,644
But... that's what I'm saying.

825
01:18:50,756 --> 01:18:54,692
And we can't keep
you here forever.

826
01:18:54,794 --> 01:18:59,060
I'll do more work around the house,
if that's what you want.

827
01:18:59,165 --> 01:19:01,065
No, I only want one thing.

828
01:19:01,167 --> 01:19:04,694
I want you to make
Mr. Walker understand...

829
01:19:04,804 --> 01:19:07,466
that there's absolutely
no legal means...

830
01:19:07,573 --> 01:19:09,302
for redressing this thing.

831
01:19:10,509 --> 01:19:13,569
Why are you telling her that?
That's not what the lawyers said.

832
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,239
Will you let me
handle this, please?

833
01:19:16,349 --> 01:19:18,408
They said it would take
a lot of time and money...

834
01:19:18,517 --> 01:19:20,815
but they never said
that there was no chance.

835
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,480
I am trying to present
this situation...

836
01:19:23,589 --> 01:19:25,887
in a way she's capable
of understanding!

837
01:19:25,992 --> 01:19:29,484
- But you're lying to her.
- Get out! I told you to get out!

838
01:19:43,175 --> 01:19:45,075
Sarah, now, listen to me.

839
01:19:45,177 --> 01:19:46,166
Listen.

840
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:50,841
Now, you can tell Mr. Walker
that if he'll just marry you...

841
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:53,180
without any more
of this nonsense...

842
01:19:53,286 --> 01:19:56,016
I'll pay to have
his automobile repaired.

843
01:19:57,757 --> 01:19:59,816
That ain't gonna do no good...

844
01:20:01,227 --> 01:20:04,458
'cause he say it got
to be the firemen.

845
01:20:04,563 --> 01:20:08,363
Oh, for pity's sake.
What difference does it make?

846
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:13,100
I told him I'd clean it.

847
01:20:13,205 --> 01:20:16,641
I'd clean it.
But he said no.

848
01:20:16,742 --> 01:20:19,302
Well, if he's not willing
to see reason...

849
01:20:19,412 --> 01:20:23,473
then it's your responsibility
to do something about it.

850
01:20:23,582 --> 01:20:24,981
Do you understand?

851
01:20:28,321 --> 01:20:30,687
It's your responsibility now.

852
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,577
Oh, baby.

853
01:20:56,682 --> 01:20:58,946
Where's your mommy, huh?

854
01:20:59,051 --> 01:21:01,178
Where'd your mommy go?

855
01:22:01,847 --> 01:22:03,610
Ladies and gentlemen...

856
01:22:03,716 --> 01:22:07,846
the vice president of the United
States, Charles Fairbanks.

857
01:22:17,863 --> 01:22:21,196
A few days ago,
I went to the president...

858
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,928
and I said to him, "Colonel...

859
01:22:24,036 --> 01:22:27,130
I'm about to visit the great
northeast of this country...

860
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:28,866
and meet the people.

861
01:22:28,974 --> 01:22:31,772
Is there anything
you want me to tell them?"

862
01:22:31,877 --> 01:22:34,437
You know what he said?
He said to me...

863
01:22:34,547 --> 01:22:36,674
"Charles, just tell them...

864
01:22:36,782 --> 01:22:39,615
that the door to my office
is always open."

865
01:22:44,723 --> 01:22:48,250
You good people of White Plains
voted for us in the last election.

866
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:50,692
You knew what we stood for then.

867
01:22:50,796 --> 01:22:54,527
We haven't changed,
and we hope you haven't either.

868
01:22:54,633 --> 01:22:56,225
Good health...

869
01:22:56,335 --> 01:22:59,566
enterprise, self-reliance.

870
01:22:59,672 --> 01:23:03,506
I'm talking about the man who
wants to get out there and do--

871
01:23:03,609 --> 01:23:07,010
- Stay back, please, Stay back.
- Mr. President!

872
01:23:07,113 --> 01:23:09,479
...who sees an opportunity...

873
01:23:09,582 --> 01:23:12,517
- and grabs it by the tail.
- Mr. President!

874
01:23:13,552 --> 01:23:15,383
You gotta help Coalhouse Walker!

875
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:27,122
Make way. Coming through.
Coming through.

876
01:23:29,135 --> 01:23:31,194
I'm sorry.
Make way. Make way.

877
01:23:36,342 --> 01:23:40,244
Her sternum was crushed, and she's
sustained severe internal injuries.

878
01:23:40,346 --> 01:23:42,712
I'm afraid you'll have
to keep her dry and warm...

879
01:23:42,815 --> 01:23:45,215
and pray that she
doesn't develop pneumonia.

880
01:23:48,954 --> 01:23:50,785
This is her husband.

881
01:24:19,885 --> 01:24:23,184
The president knows
who you are now.

882
01:24:23,289 --> 01:24:27,123
I said your whole name
before they got to me.

883
01:24:27,226 --> 01:24:28,693
That's good.

884
01:24:29,862 --> 01:24:31,591
Don't talk now.

885
01:24:33,532 --> 01:24:36,660
But I didn't get a chance
to tell him what you want.

886
01:24:36,769 --> 01:24:40,227
So you gotta write him a letter.

887
01:24:40,339 --> 01:24:41,931
I will.

888
01:24:45,911 --> 01:24:47,811
I spoke with a minister yesterday.

889
01:24:49,815 --> 01:24:51,976
He said he would marry us...

890
01:24:52,084 --> 01:24:53,984
even with the baby and all.

891
01:24:57,156 --> 01:25:00,648
Now, we're gonna have
the whole Clef Club Orchestra.

892
01:25:00,759 --> 01:25:03,728
They're gonna play for us.
And a choir.

893
01:25:05,331 --> 01:25:08,232
And it's gonna be
in a big, big church...

894
01:25:08,334 --> 01:25:10,393
like you never seen before.

895
01:25:13,572 --> 01:25:14,971
Which one?

896
01:25:17,776 --> 01:25:19,334
You just rest.

897
01:26:15,134 --> 01:26:17,329
- Ace.
- Ace. That's two bits.

898
01:26:17,436 --> 01:26:20,462
Jesus Christ.
You lucky bastard.

899
01:26:20,572 --> 01:26:23,132
It's the luck
of the Irish, me boy.

900
01:26:25,744 --> 01:26:27,735
Three. Answer the phone.

901
01:26:29,515 --> 01:26:31,676
Hold those cards.
Nobody bets.

902
01:26:34,453 --> 01:26:35,852
Emerald Isle Firehouse.

903
01:26:40,092 --> 01:26:43,220
Let's go, guys. This is it.
Come on. Let's go.

904
01:26:43,329 --> 01:26:46,230
Come on. Hey, kid, let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

905
01:26:46,332 --> 01:26:49,859
Come on. Let's go. Move! Move!
Come on. Down the pole.

906
01:27:06,085 --> 01:27:08,212
Where's Conklin?

907
01:27:11,223 --> 01:27:13,157
- Which one of you is Conklin?
- Don't shoot me!

908
01:27:13,258 --> 01:27:16,056
- Tell me which of you is Conklin.
- I don't know!

909
01:27:16,962 --> 01:27:18,361
Where's Conklin?

910
01:27:18,464 --> 01:27:20,659
- Where's Conklin?
- No! No!

911
01:27:20,766 --> 01:27:24,293
- Damn it, where's Conklin?
- He's not here!

912
01:27:25,337 --> 01:27:26,998
Let's go! Let's go!

913
01:27:32,111 --> 01:27:34,102
"I want the infamous...

914
01:27:35,347 --> 01:27:39,784
fire chief, William Conklin,
turned over to my justice.

915
01:27:39,885 --> 01:27:43,514
I want my automobile returned to me
in its original condition.

916
01:27:44,723 --> 01:27:46,953
When you are ready
to meet my demands...

917
01:27:47,059 --> 01:27:49,755
please make it known
in the newspapers.

918
01:27:49,862 --> 01:27:51,329
If you refuse me...

919
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:54,888
I shall continue to burn
firehouses and kill firemen...

920
01:27:57,136 --> 01:27:59,001
until I have satisfaction.

921
01:28:01,306 --> 01:28:04,104
Coalhouse Walker, Jr."

922
01:28:04,209 --> 01:28:06,336
That's that crazy nigger
with the car!

923
01:28:06,445 --> 01:28:10,176
So, you know
all about him, do ya?

924
01:28:10,282 --> 01:28:14,150
- Sure as hell, I do.
- What do you know exactly?

925
01:28:14,253 --> 01:28:17,814
Well, you had him all arrested
for parking his car illegal.

926
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:20,221
You had him behind bars
where he belongs.

927
01:28:20,325 --> 01:28:22,054
Now he's running around loose.

928
01:28:22,161 --> 01:28:25,187
Whose fault do you suppose that is?
Not mine, I'll tell you that.

929
01:28:25,297 --> 01:28:29,097
Well, Willie, we have
a little problem on our hands.

930
01:28:29,201 --> 01:28:31,260
Well, you got a problem, do ya?

931
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:33,600
How do you suppose I feel?

932
01:28:33,705 --> 01:28:35,866
Those were my men he killed!

933
01:28:35,974 --> 01:28:39,102
We heard something
about excrement in his car.

934
01:28:39,211 --> 01:28:42,305
So? What are you messin'
around with me for?

935
01:28:42,414 --> 01:28:45,008
We're just trying
to piece it all together.

936
01:28:45,117 --> 01:28:47,745
Go out and arrest every nigger
in the neighborhood.

937
01:28:47,853 --> 01:28:49,844
One of them's bound
to know where he is.

938
01:28:49,955 --> 01:28:52,355
They all know everything
about each other, right?

939
01:28:52,458 --> 01:28:54,858
That's a grand piece
of thinking, Willie.

940
01:28:56,028 --> 01:28:57,518
But, you see...

941
01:28:59,298 --> 01:29:02,131
we had a different
sort of plan in mind.

942
01:29:04,069 --> 01:29:06,037
What's that?

943
01:29:06,138 --> 01:29:08,333
Offer to turn you
over to him.

944
01:29:10,242 --> 01:29:11,971
You're a funny man, Inspector.

945
01:29:12,077 --> 01:29:15,513
Well, Willie, it's the easiest way
to find him, isn't it?

946
01:29:17,516 --> 01:29:19,848
And the cheapest,
don't you think?

947
01:29:21,653 --> 01:29:24,315
Hey, fellas, be serious,
will ya, huh?

948
01:29:24,423 --> 01:29:26,687
I ain't laughing, you see.

949
01:29:29,161 --> 01:29:31,322
Aren't we all in this together?

950
01:29:32,998 --> 01:29:34,397
Right?

951
01:29:35,767 --> 01:29:37,667
Aren't we all in this together?

952
01:29:45,277 --> 01:29:48,110
Would you say he seemed
fairly attached to the baby?

953
01:29:48,213 --> 01:29:49,111
Yes.

954
01:29:49,214 --> 01:29:51,842
Do you think he'll try
to get the baby back?

955
01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:53,508
I don't know.

956
01:29:55,387 --> 01:29:56,945
I really don't know.

957
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:04,520
Maybe we should post a man
here at the house.

958
01:30:06,899 --> 01:30:09,197
Just so there'll be someone
around who'll know what to do...

959
01:30:09,301 --> 01:30:12,202
in case he tries
to get in touch.

960
01:30:14,907 --> 01:30:16,932
Is that really necessary?

961
01:30:17,042 --> 01:30:19,806
Well, it's for
your own protection too.

962
01:30:19,912 --> 01:30:22,813
You never know with these people,
if he wants the baby badly enough.

963
01:30:24,349 --> 01:30:28,217
Maybe in that case we could take
the baby to my cousin's house.

964
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:33,053
No, ma'am, we prefer that
Mr. Walker knows where the baby is.

965
01:30:35,961 --> 01:30:37,428
I see.

966
01:30:37,529 --> 01:30:39,622
It'd be better,
having someone here.

967
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:00,308
Good evening, sir. A table?

968
01:31:00,419 --> 01:31:03,252
I'm looking for Coalhouse Walker.
He's a piano player.

969
01:31:03,355 --> 01:31:05,789
Sorry. He doesn't work
here anymore.

970
01:31:05,891 --> 01:31:08,792
Do you know where I could get
in touch with him? It's important.

971
01:31:08,894 --> 01:31:11,294
I don't know where he is.
Sorry. He stopped working here.

972
01:31:11,396 --> 01:31:13,193
You don't have any address--

973
01:31:15,567 --> 01:31:17,626
Yes, I see.
Why should you trust me?

974
01:31:17,736 --> 01:31:21,103
I'd like him to know not to come
near the house in New Rochelle.

975
01:31:21,206 --> 01:31:22,605
It's not safe.

976
01:31:22,708 --> 01:31:25,609
Sorry, Mr. Walker
doesn't work here anymore.

977
01:31:25,711 --> 01:31:27,372
I know, I know.

978
01:31:27,479 --> 01:31:30,505
But if you could give him
the message. It's important.

979
01:31:30,616 --> 01:31:32,641
Here's my card.

980
01:31:52,504 --> 01:31:54,165
Yes.

981
01:31:55,607 --> 01:31:57,165
May I come in?

982
01:32:11,657 --> 01:32:14,990
- Can you explain this?
- What is it?

983
01:32:16,895 --> 01:32:20,092
Someone in Harlem
gave it to the police.

984
01:32:20,198 --> 01:32:22,894
They said a young man
was looking for Coalhouse Walker.

985
01:32:25,537 --> 01:32:27,368
Yes, that was me.

986
01:32:29,141 --> 01:32:30,870
Why did you do that?

987
01:32:30,976 --> 01:32:34,241
I wanted to warn Mr. Walker
that our house was being watched.

988
01:32:35,781 --> 01:32:37,681
You damn fool.

989
01:32:39,851 --> 01:32:42,911
You don't seem to realize
how serious this situation is.

990
01:32:43,922 --> 01:32:47,585
- I think I do.
- Then why did you try to help him?

991
01:32:50,996 --> 01:32:52,861
Are you planning
on doing it again?

992
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:58,025
I hope not because I gave
the inspector my word of honor...

993
01:32:58,136 --> 01:33:01,071
that you wouldn't do
anything foolish again.

994
01:33:01,173 --> 01:33:02,538
Can I trust you?

995
01:33:05,343 --> 01:33:08,744
- Yes, you can.
- Do I have your word on it?

996
01:33:08,847 --> 01:33:10,246
Yes.

997
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:35,900
Mr. Walker?

998
01:33:40,378 --> 01:33:43,142
- What do you want with him?
- I want to talk to him.

999
01:33:45,016 --> 01:33:48,144
What do you want
to talk to him about?

1000
01:33:48,253 --> 01:33:50,380
- Who are you?
- Don't worry about who I am.

1001
01:33:50,489 --> 01:33:52,457
What do you want to talk
to Mr. Walker about?

1002
01:33:52,557 --> 01:33:53,956
Get him a chair.

1003
01:33:54,059 --> 01:33:55,720
- Mr. Walker?
- That's right.

1004
01:34:00,499 --> 01:34:04,435
- Do I have to keep this on?
- I think you'd better.

1005
01:34:05,771 --> 01:34:07,636
Okay.

1006
01:34:07,739 --> 01:34:09,502
What can I do for you?

1007
01:34:10,642 --> 01:34:13,042
Well, it's just our house.

1008
01:34:14,179 --> 01:34:16,374
You know your son
is still there.

1009
01:34:17,516 --> 01:34:19,643
The... police...

1010
01:34:19,751 --> 01:34:23,050
have a man watching the place.

1011
01:34:23,155 --> 01:34:25,623
Is that why you came here?

1012
01:34:32,297 --> 01:34:33,525
Well?

1013
01:34:35,801 --> 01:34:37,962
I design fireworks.
That's my job.

1014
01:34:47,979 --> 01:34:49,537
I can make bombs.

1015
01:34:55,754 --> 01:34:58,814
Fireworks, bombs--
it's the same thing.

1016
01:35:46,304 --> 01:35:47,862
What's the idea?

1017
01:36:13,431 --> 01:36:15,661
Get away from our house!

1018
01:36:15,767 --> 01:36:18,998
This is a private residence.
You're all trespassing!

1019
01:36:19,104 --> 01:36:22,232
Sir, let us see
the colored baby, okay?

1020
01:36:25,277 --> 01:36:27,268
- Brigit!
- Dear?

1021
01:36:28,947 --> 01:36:31,575
Thank God you're home.
Come in here.

1022
01:36:31,683 --> 01:36:33,082
Listen to me.

1023
01:36:33,184 --> 01:36:37,587
I want you to tell this man
to make those people go away.

1024
01:36:37,689 --> 01:36:41,352
They're screaming horrible things
that the children can hear them.

1025
01:36:41,459 --> 01:36:44,087
- Calm down, dear.
- He sits there. He does nothing.

1026
01:36:44,195 --> 01:36:46,993
- He's not protecting us.
- Darling, calm down!

1027
01:36:47,098 --> 01:36:50,693
Isn't this trespassing?
I don't want him here.

1028
01:36:50,802 --> 01:36:54,203
- He's not protecting us.
-Just calm down a second.

1029
01:36:55,707 --> 01:36:58,175
Is your brother home?

1030
01:36:58,276 --> 01:36:59,937
No.

1031
01:37:00,045 --> 01:37:01,945
He hasn't called, has he?

1032
01:37:05,483 --> 01:37:06,882
All right.

1033
01:37:08,353 --> 01:37:11,481
I think we should leave New Rochelle
as soon as possible...

1034
01:37:11,589 --> 01:37:13,989
and wait until
all of this calms down.

1035
01:37:14,092 --> 01:37:16,856
-Can you make the arrange--
-What about my brother? Where is he?

1036
01:37:16,962 --> 01:37:18,725
Will he come too?

1037
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:22,664
Your brother will do what
he wants to do, as usual.

1038
01:37:22,767 --> 01:37:26,328
Now, will you make arrangements
to close the house down?

1039
01:38:07,045 --> 01:38:09,275
Wait a minute.
You can't leave that there.

1040
01:38:47,318 --> 01:38:49,946
Don't turn around.
Just keep walking, just like that.

1041
01:38:50,055 --> 01:38:52,853
Don't turn around,
and you won't get hurt.

1042
01:38:56,227 --> 01:38:57,694
Turn around.

1043
01:38:59,364 --> 01:39:01,298
Now run and don't look back.

1044
01:39:01,399 --> 01:39:03,663
Run! Don't look back!

1045
01:39:14,512 --> 01:39:16,412
Whoa! Whoa!

1046
01:39:19,184 --> 01:39:20,583
Good boy, good boy.

1047
01:39:45,410 --> 01:39:47,708
- Come on!
- Goddamn it! Bust it.

1048
01:39:47,812 --> 01:39:50,110
- Come on!
- Bust it!

1049
01:39:51,449 --> 01:39:52,848
Bust it!

1050
01:39:57,388 --> 01:40:00,186
Well, come on!
Get it in! Get it in!

1051
01:40:00,291 --> 01:40:02,521
All right.
Get rid of that wagon!

1052
01:40:17,542 --> 01:40:18,941
Come on!

1053
01:40:37,629 --> 01:40:38,721
Stay back!

1054
01:40:40,565 --> 01:40:42,499
Stay back, I said!

1055
01:41:48,233 --> 01:41:50,667
Yes, give him that whack!
Try, Evelyn!

1056
01:41:50,768 --> 01:41:54,431
Run! Run, run a little bit!
Make run the feet!

1057
01:41:55,940 --> 01:41:58,738
Evelyn, make a--
A little bit more angry!

1058
01:41:58,843 --> 01:42:00,333
More strained!

1059
01:42:00,445 --> 01:42:02,845
Open your eyes!
More! More angry!

1060
01:42:02,947 --> 01:42:05,108
Okay, more--

1061
01:42:05,216 --> 01:42:08,447
You want to kill her!
You will kill her! Evelyn!

1062
01:42:08,553 --> 01:42:11,454
Open your mouth!
You want to be more afraid!

1063
01:42:11,556 --> 01:42:14,650
Open your mouth! Open, open!
Evelyn, you want to be very afraid!

1064
01:42:14,759 --> 01:42:17,159
Extremely! Extremely!

1065
01:42:37,915 --> 01:42:40,816
Play with your eye, with your face.
Show with your tongue.

1066
01:42:40,918 --> 01:42:43,910
Forget about the belly or
the "peedgy-peedgy" with the feet.

1067
01:42:44,022 --> 01:42:46,388
You understand?
Excellent. Wonderful.

1068
01:42:49,327 --> 01:42:51,124
It's good?

1069
01:42:51,229 --> 01:42:52,130
Hello, young gentleman.

1070
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:52,721
Hello, young gentleman.

1071
01:42:52,830 --> 01:42:54,627
- Hello.
- You saw the picture?

1072
01:42:54,732 --> 01:42:56,222
- Yes.
- How do you like?

1073
01:42:56,334 --> 01:42:58,894
What are you doing? Come along.
These people are working.

1074
01:42:59,003 --> 01:43:00,868
- He's your own son?
- Yes.

1075
01:43:00,972 --> 01:43:02,803
- Very charming.
- Oh, thank you.

1076
01:43:02,907 --> 01:43:05,671
- Very nice to see you.
- I'm sorry. Come along, please.

1077
01:43:05,777 --> 01:43:09,008
Don't take him away.
Let him be here.

1078
01:43:09,113 --> 01:43:10,774
That's my daughter.

1079
01:43:10,882 --> 01:43:12,406
How do you do?

1080
01:43:13,418 --> 01:43:15,215
Say hello.

1081
01:43:16,454 --> 01:43:18,513
He's shy.

1082
01:43:18,623 --> 01:43:20,420
I'm shy too.

1083
01:43:23,127 --> 01:43:25,755
- You know what's it?
- A book?

1084
01:43:25,863 --> 01:43:29,094
It's... a majestic book.

1085
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:37,599
That's for you. Take, take.
That's for you.

1086
01:43:39,110 --> 01:43:41,772
- No, we couldn't do that.
- Why?

1087
01:43:41,879 --> 01:43:44,370
I give it like a present.

1088
01:43:45,483 --> 01:43:47,314
Well, thank you.

1089
01:43:47,418 --> 01:43:49,386
Is everything all right?

1090
01:43:49,487 --> 01:43:52,217
Yes. This is my husband.

1091
01:43:53,491 --> 01:43:55,083
Very nice.

1092
01:43:55,193 --> 01:43:57,354
My name, Baron Ashkenazy.

1093
01:43:57,462 --> 01:43:59,362
My "gratulation" to you.

1094
01:43:59,464 --> 01:44:02,399
- Baron. Pardon?
- My "gratulation."

1095
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:05,526
You have very nice wife,
and your son is wonderful.

1096
01:44:07,605 --> 01:44:09,266
Oh, I see. Thank you.

1097
01:44:11,175 --> 01:44:13,302
- Can you dance, my little?
- Yes.

1098
01:44:13,411 --> 01:44:16,141
We'll finish on the film
and I'll make a party.

1099
01:44:16,247 --> 01:44:19,648
And you'll be my guest, and you'll
be together with my daughter.

1100
01:44:21,486 --> 01:44:22,976
And you'll be all my guest.

1101
01:44:24,655 --> 01:44:27,419
Well, if we're still here, perhaps.

1102
01:44:28,693 --> 01:44:31,719
I forget to introduce you
with my better...

1103
01:44:31,829 --> 01:44:34,354
with my star, Evelyn Nesbit.

1104
01:44:34,465 --> 01:44:36,729
She's very--

1105
01:44:36,834 --> 01:44:38,563
a great talent.

1106
01:44:38,669 --> 01:44:40,637
I hope she'll make me great.

1107
01:44:40,738 --> 01:44:42,467
It's very nice to meet you.

1108
01:44:42,573 --> 01:44:45,770
We read about you in the papers.
You're very beautiful.

1109
01:44:45,877 --> 01:44:47,572
Thank you.

1110
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:52,713
It's high time to continue our work.
If you want to, you can watch.

1111
01:44:52,817 --> 01:44:55,285
We don't forbid you.
Evelyn, come.

1112
01:44:57,989 --> 01:45:00,890
Evelyn! Would you please, Evelyn?
We have the light!

1113
01:45:28,519 --> 01:45:30,646
- You all set, Captain?
- The whole building is covered.

1114
01:45:30,755 --> 01:45:34,623
I've got three groups of five men
ready to hit the place at once.

1115
01:45:34,725 --> 01:45:36,716
Let me through.

1116
01:45:36,828 --> 01:45:40,195
Let me through!
That's impossible, gentlemen.

1117
01:45:40,298 --> 01:45:42,789
- That's simply out of the question.
- Who's he?

1118
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:45,061
- I'm Mr. Vernon Elliott.
- Vernon Elliott.

1119
01:45:45,169 --> 01:45:48,070
He's the curator
for the Morgan Library.

1120
01:45:49,507 --> 01:45:51,065
What can I do for you?

1121
01:45:51,175 --> 01:45:53,837
That place is a national treasure...

1122
01:45:53,945 --> 01:45:57,574
and if this climate of violence
continues, I'll go to the president.

1123
01:45:57,682 --> 01:46:01,516
- You will, huh?
- Indeed, if I deem it necessary.

1124
01:46:01,619 --> 01:46:04,816
By the way, I'm Rheinlander Waldo,
commissioner of police.

1125
01:46:04,922 --> 01:46:07,288
Yes? Well, I'm honored.

1126
01:46:07,391 --> 01:46:10,690
And if any harm comes
to any object in that building...

1127
01:46:10,795 --> 01:46:14,856
with all due respect,
there'll be grave consequences.

1128
01:46:14,966 --> 01:46:18,094
- How many are in there?
- We're not sure yet. At least two.

1129
01:46:18,202 --> 01:46:20,193
Maybe more-- maybe much more.

1130
01:46:20,304 --> 01:46:22,329
But who are they?
What are they up to?

1131
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:24,340
Zero.

1132
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:30,806
Well, Mr. Elliott, why don't you
go in and have a word with them?

1133
01:46:32,383 --> 01:46:35,352
-I beg your pardon.
-Explain the value of the library...

1134
01:46:35,453 --> 01:46:38,149
see what they want--
that sort of thing.

1135
01:46:38,256 --> 01:46:41,555
That hardly seems like the
appropriate procedure, Mr. Waldo.

1136
01:46:41,659 --> 01:46:43,889
And if you're making a joke
at my expense...

1137
01:46:43,995 --> 01:46:48,056
I assure you there's nothing amusing
about my responsibilities...

1138
01:46:48,165 --> 01:46:50,395
as the curator
of Mr. Morgan's library.

1139
01:46:50,501 --> 01:46:54,699
Mr. Elliot, as long
as those guys are in there...

1140
01:46:54,805 --> 01:46:59,299
you are not the curator of anything.

1141
01:46:59,410 --> 01:47:01,310
Give me a megaphone.

1142
01:47:19,030 --> 01:47:23,091
I am Rheinlander Waldo.
I am Commissioner of Police.

1143
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:25,430
I'm going to walk toward you.

1144
01:47:25,536 --> 01:47:27,436
I am not armed.

1145
01:47:27,538 --> 01:47:31,099
I want to talk to you.
Can you hear me?

1146
01:47:31,208 --> 01:47:34,439
I want to talk to you
inside the library.

1147
01:47:34,545 --> 01:47:38,379
If you'll let me come in,
please open the door as I approach.

1148
01:47:38,482 --> 01:47:41,713
I am not armed as you can see.

1149
01:47:47,191 --> 01:47:50,354
Cover! Come on!

1150
01:47:51,462 --> 01:47:55,125
That's it! Fall back! Come on.
Down there. That's it. Back!

1151
01:48:01,339 --> 01:48:03,967
What was that?

1152
01:48:04,075 --> 01:48:07,875
Let me have that, please.
Please, please.

1153
01:48:07,979 --> 01:48:10,140
My God!

1154
01:48:11,983 --> 01:48:14,713
- That's a covered goblet.
- What?

1155
01:48:14,819 --> 01:48:18,050
It's from the 1 7th century...

1156
01:48:18,155 --> 01:48:21,420
commissioned by Frederick of Saxony.

1157
01:48:21,525 --> 01:48:24,688
It's silver inlaid with gold...

1158
01:48:24,795 --> 01:48:27,093
and studded with precious gems.

1159
01:48:29,834 --> 01:48:32,234
Captain, go get it.

1160
01:48:33,771 --> 01:48:35,671
Sergeant.

1161
01:48:35,773 --> 01:48:37,172
Sir.

1162
01:48:53,124 --> 01:48:55,752
- Sir.
- Captain, open it.

1163
01:48:55,860 --> 01:48:57,259
Sergeant.

1164
01:49:10,041 --> 01:49:13,533
- Well, what is it?
- "Murray Hill, 8529."

1165
01:49:13,644 --> 01:49:17,546
- What? That's my number.
- What?

1166
01:49:17,648 --> 01:49:21,641
- My office in the library.
- Good.

1167
01:49:23,921 --> 01:49:27,516
- I'll get it, ma'am.
- Police. Open up.

1168
01:49:29,827 --> 01:49:32,557
- Ma'am, do you have a telephone?
- We had nothing to do with it.

1169
01:49:32,663 --> 01:49:34,563
- Do you have a telephone?
- Yes, of course we do.

1170
01:49:34,665 --> 01:49:36,565
- Where? Thank you.
- In there.

1171
01:49:36,667 --> 01:49:39,602
There's the one upstairs,
but it's out of order.

1172
01:49:39,704 --> 01:49:42,400
Ma'am, I would like you to sign
this formal release.

1173
01:49:42,506 --> 01:49:44,667
What are all these policemen
doing here?

1174
01:49:44,775 --> 01:49:47,039
I've never seen so many
policemen in my life!

1175
01:49:47,144 --> 01:49:49,044
- I cannot understand this!
- We'll deal with it later.

1176
01:49:49,146 --> 01:49:51,637
- Where are they going?
- You can't go in there.

1177
01:49:51,749 --> 01:49:54,115
I want to go in my house.

1178
01:49:54,218 --> 01:49:57,153
It's my own room in there. What
do you mean, I can't go in there?

1179
01:49:57,254 --> 01:49:59,722
What are they doing
that I can't see?

1180
01:50:01,792 --> 01:50:04,886
Central, this is a police emergency.

1181
01:50:04,995 --> 01:50:07,896
Give me Murray Hill, 8529.

1182
01:50:07,998 --> 01:50:12,094
- Repeat that, please.
- I repeat, Murray Hill, 8529.

1183
01:50:12,203 --> 01:50:14,501
I don't understand this,
and I'm a moral woman.

1184
01:50:14,605 --> 01:50:17,665
I don't want anything going on
in this house I don't know about.

1185
01:50:17,775 --> 01:50:19,367
- Please open up the door.
- Yes.

1186
01:50:19,477 --> 01:50:23,675
- Sir.
- I never saw anything like this.

1187
01:50:23,781 --> 01:50:27,046
Hello.
This is Rheinlander Waldo speaking.

1188
01:50:27,151 --> 01:50:31,019
Mr. Waldo, I want my car returned
in the same condition it was in...

1189
01:50:31,122 --> 01:50:33,022
when my way was blocked.

1190
01:50:33,124 --> 01:50:35,684
In return
for the life of my Sarah...

1191
01:50:35,793 --> 01:50:39,490
I want Fire Chief Willie Conklin
turned over to my justice.

1192
01:50:39,597 --> 01:50:41,531
Is that clear?

1193
01:50:41,632 --> 01:50:43,998
Who is this? Who am I speaking to?

1194
01:50:45,402 --> 01:50:47,893
You're speaking
to Coalhouse Walker, Jr.

1195
01:50:48,005 --> 01:50:50,906
You have 48 hours
to meet my demands.

1196
01:50:51,008 --> 01:50:55,604
I should warn you that this building
has been mined with explosives.

1197
01:50:59,316 --> 01:51:01,910
Hello! Hello?

1198
01:51:03,854 --> 01:51:06,618
Get that number again,
will you?

1199
01:51:06,724 --> 01:51:08,885
That's the crazy buck
from New Rochelle, isn't it?

1200
01:51:08,993 --> 01:51:10,221
I think so.

1201
01:51:10,327 --> 01:51:12,989
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

1202
01:51:15,366 --> 01:51:18,563
- Get the New Rochelle police chief.
- Right.

1203
01:51:18,669 --> 01:51:21,137
And I want blueprints of the library
and an explosives man.

1204
01:51:21,238 --> 01:51:23,001
- Yes, sir.
- Get the militia ready.

1205
01:51:23,107 --> 01:51:25,905
- Right.
- Where is J.P. Morgan?

1206
01:51:27,011 --> 01:51:30,845
Oh, he's on an expedition
down the Nile in Egypt.

1207
01:51:32,016 --> 01:51:35,747
- Hmm. Lucky him.
- Yes, sir.

1208
01:51:35,853 --> 01:51:40,654
And contact some colored big shots
in case we need to negotiate.

1209
01:51:40,758 --> 01:51:43,249
Very good, sir. Anything else?

1210
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:46,193
Yeah. He said something
about a car and a fire chief.

1211
01:51:46,297 --> 01:51:48,424
Conklin. Willie Conklin.

1212
01:51:48,532 --> 01:51:50,432
Get him in. I want to meet him.

1213
01:51:50,534 --> 01:51:53,196
Sir, that number doesn't answer.
What do you want me to do?

1214
01:51:55,639 --> 01:51:58,108
- Get me some coffee and a roll.
- Yes, sir.

1215
01:51:58,409 --> 01:52:02,106
Does Jesus bear

1216
01:52:02,213 --> 01:52:05,614
The cross alone

1217
01:52:05,716 --> 01:52:09,345
And all the world

1218
01:52:09,453 --> 01:52:12,684
Go free

1219
01:52:12,790 --> 01:52:18,160
Now there's a cross
for everyone

1220
01:52:18,262 --> 01:52:20,162
What do you people think about this?
Mr. Washington!

1221
01:52:20,264 --> 01:52:23,529
- And there's a cross
- Mr. Washington?

1222
01:52:23,634 --> 01:52:26,660
For me

1223
01:52:26,770 --> 01:52:29,898
I want you to know how much
we appreciate this, Mr. Washington.

1224
01:52:30,007 --> 01:52:32,475
I hope and pray
that his mind is open to reason.

1225
01:52:32,576 --> 01:52:34,703
Now, you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

1226
01:52:34,812 --> 01:52:36,712
I'm ready, Mr. Waldo.

1227
01:52:39,083 --> 01:52:42,177
You're a brave man, sir.
You have my blessing.

1228
01:52:45,256 --> 01:52:46,917
What

1229
01:52:47,024 --> 01:52:52,360
A friend we have in Jesus

1230
01:52:52,463 --> 01:52:58,493
All our sins and griefs
to bear

1231
01:52:58,602 --> 01:53:05,064
What a privilege to carry

1232
01:53:05,175 --> 01:53:10,909
Everything to God in prayer

1233
01:53:11,015 --> 01:53:14,007
I think you know me by name,
Mr. Walker.

1234
01:53:14,952 --> 01:53:16,249
Open the door!

1235
01:53:16,353 --> 01:53:19,447
In the name of our people,
open the door!

1236
01:53:58,362 --> 01:54:01,593
I'm honored to meet you,
Mr. Washington.

1237
01:54:03,467 --> 01:54:05,662
Would you care for a seat?

1238
01:54:29,593 --> 01:54:31,527
You seem to know about me.

1239
01:54:32,796 --> 01:54:35,788
Of course I do.

1240
01:54:35,899 --> 01:54:38,993
I have a great admiration
for you, sir.

1241
01:54:39,103 --> 01:54:40,866
- Truly?
- Yes, sir.

1242
01:54:42,072 --> 01:54:44,870
How can you say that
when your actions...

1243
01:54:44,975 --> 01:54:47,671
are a mockery of everything
I stand for?

1244
01:54:51,648 --> 01:54:53,843
I had no choice in that, sir.

1245
01:54:53,951 --> 01:54:56,476
Mr. Walker...

1246
01:54:56,587 --> 01:54:58,646
I have spent a lifetime...

1247
01:54:58,756 --> 01:55:01,316
trying to persuade the white man
that he needn't fear us--

1248
01:55:02,693 --> 01:55:04,820
that all we wanted
was a chance to work...

1249
01:55:04,928 --> 01:55:06,987
and prosper beside him...

1250
01:55:07,097 --> 01:55:10,555
and enjoy with him
the fruits of this great land.

1251
01:55:10,667 --> 01:55:14,262
Now, the example of 1 ,000...

1252
01:55:14,371 --> 01:55:17,829
honest, industrious black men...

1253
01:55:17,941 --> 01:55:21,035
cannot undo the harm
of one like you.

1254
01:55:21,145 --> 01:55:24,444
What you have done here
has set our race back...

1255
01:55:24,548 --> 01:55:27,642
a distance I can't measure.

1256
01:55:29,019 --> 01:55:32,352
And you say you admire me.

1257
01:55:33,490 --> 01:55:35,685
I tried everything, sir--

1258
01:55:35,793 --> 01:55:40,162
every legal means
to get satisfaction--

1259
01:55:40,264 --> 01:55:42,858
and I was humiliated
at every turn.

1260
01:55:44,501 --> 01:55:47,061
The woman who bore my child--

1261
01:55:47,171 --> 01:55:49,435
my child, Mr. Washington...

1262
01:55:50,541 --> 01:55:52,941
whom I may never see again--

1263
01:55:56,780 --> 01:56:00,511
She watched my pride
being snatched away from me...

1264
01:56:00,617 --> 01:56:02,448
piece by piece.

1265
01:56:06,790 --> 01:56:09,520
She believed in justice.

1266
01:56:10,627 --> 01:56:12,390
Oh, yes.

1267
01:56:14,998 --> 01:56:17,592
She went to the white man
and she begged...

1268
01:56:17,701 --> 01:56:20,465
that I be given the justice
entitled to me by law.

1269
01:56:27,344 --> 01:56:29,744
She died begging for it.

1270
01:56:33,684 --> 01:56:37,484
I beg you, Mr. Walker...

1271
01:56:38,589 --> 01:56:41,387
on behalf of our people...

1272
01:56:41,492 --> 01:56:43,392
your young son...

1273
01:56:43,494 --> 01:56:46,054
and all the children of our race--

1274
01:56:46,163 --> 01:56:48,927
I beg you to give yourself up.

1275
01:56:50,134 --> 01:56:53,194
Bring your men and follow me now.

1276
01:56:53,303 --> 01:56:55,965
I will intercede on your behalf.

1277
01:56:56,073 --> 01:56:58,837
Your trial shall be swift...

1278
01:56:58,942 --> 01:57:01,843
and your execution painless.

1279
01:57:08,452 --> 01:57:12,354
If my automobile is restored...

1280
01:57:12,456 --> 01:57:15,516
and delivered
to the front of this building...

1281
01:57:17,761 --> 01:57:21,629
and the fire chief
is handed over to my justice...

1282
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:26,927
I give you my solemn oath I will
come out with my hands raised...

1283
01:57:27,037 --> 01:57:31,167
and no further harm will come
to this place or to any man.

1284
01:57:31,275 --> 01:57:35,109
And you think this revenge
will restore your damaged pride?

1285
01:57:35,212 --> 01:57:37,510
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't think so.

1286
01:57:37,614 --> 01:57:41,277
You are wrong, Mr. Walker. You are
wrong to the depths of your soul.

1287
01:57:41,385 --> 01:57:44,479
- Why do you say that?
- Because vengeance does nothing...

1288
01:57:44,588 --> 01:57:46,988
but perpetuate more vengeance
and on and on...

1289
01:57:47,090 --> 01:57:51,026
until some race can find
the strength to say, "No!

1290
01:57:51,128 --> 01:57:54,325
The wrong done to me
I will not avenge!

1291
01:57:54,431 --> 01:57:58,561
I shall stand with dignity
and Christian love...

1292
01:57:58,669 --> 01:58:00,569
until my enemies are won over...

1293
01:58:00,671 --> 01:58:04,664
because they honor and respect me."

1294
01:58:04,775 --> 01:58:07,767
And only when this happens,
Mr. Walker...

1295
01:58:07,878 --> 01:58:09,971
shall we have our pride back.

1296
01:58:11,381 --> 01:58:13,281
All of us.

1297
01:58:21,325 --> 01:58:25,694
My God, if only Sarah
could be here to listen to you.

1298
01:58:28,465 --> 01:58:30,933
She thought I had a mouth on me.

1299
01:58:33,003 --> 01:58:35,403
But you speak like an angel,
Mr. Washington.

1300
01:58:41,078 --> 01:58:44,605
It's too bad we're living
on the earth.

1301
01:58:49,052 --> 01:58:51,577
You are damned...

1302
01:58:51,688 --> 01:58:53,588
Mr. Walker.

1303
01:59:01,999 --> 01:59:04,058
Sir.

1304
01:59:04,167 --> 01:59:06,067
We're starting, sir.

1305
02:00:07,798 --> 02:00:09,857
Goddamn it!

1306
02:00:16,940 --> 02:00:18,202
Your ear!

1307
02:00:22,079 --> 02:00:24,980
My dear guests,
today we celebrate...

1308
02:00:25,082 --> 02:00:28,415
the ending of my third photoplay.

1309
02:00:28,518 --> 02:00:32,614
My first photoplay had called
The Naive Daughter.

1310
02:00:32,723 --> 02:00:37,524
It cost me $500
and the profit was $ 1 0,000.

1311
02:00:37,627 --> 02:00:41,461
The second was even better
than the first...

1312
02:00:41,565 --> 02:00:43,533
and the profit was more.

1313
02:00:43,633 --> 02:00:47,194
Now, my toast is for this...

1314
02:00:47,304 --> 02:00:49,738
what make me possible
to do everything.

1315
02:00:51,708 --> 02:00:54,472
Do you know what's it? Light.

1316
02:00:54,578 --> 02:00:58,480
You see the light of the candle?
It's very nice.

1317
02:00:58,582 --> 02:01:03,076
It shine through the glass.

1318
02:01:03,186 --> 02:01:07,680
It's refract.
The chandelier. It's convert.

1319
02:01:07,791 --> 02:01:10,658
It's transferring small star.

1320
02:01:12,129 --> 02:01:15,929
And now we make pictures
from the light.

1321
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:18,933
People pay a couple of penny
and they watch...

1322
02:01:19,035 --> 02:01:22,368
in a short time,
the whole life of man--

1323
02:01:22,472 --> 02:01:26,772
how they fight, how they eat,
how they love.

1324
02:01:30,447 --> 02:01:34,611
It's no limits for our
opportunities in the photoplay.

1325
02:01:38,822 --> 02:01:41,382
And now we have a dance, please.

1326
02:02:29,573 --> 02:02:32,906
Dear, you remember these gentlemen?
They're police.

1327
02:02:33,009 --> 02:02:35,443
Yes?

1328
02:02:35,545 --> 02:02:39,379
Well, the feeling seems to be--

1329
02:02:39,483 --> 02:02:43,681
They'd like to take Mr. Walker's
baby back to New York with them.

1330
02:02:48,892 --> 02:02:49,950
Why?

1331
02:02:50,060 --> 02:02:53,427
We don't get explanations,
ma'am. We get orders.

1332
02:02:53,530 --> 02:02:56,522
Well, that doesn't entitle you...

1333
02:02:56,633 --> 02:03:00,626
to just come along and take a child
away without giving any reasons.

1334
02:03:01,705 --> 02:03:04,139
We're dealing with an extremely
dangerous criminal.

1335
02:03:04,241 --> 02:03:05,640
You do you realize that, don't you?

1336
02:03:05,742 --> 02:03:07,835
What does that have to do with it?

1337
02:03:07,944 --> 02:03:10,208
We're talking about the baby,
not the father.

1338
02:03:10,313 --> 02:03:13,214
Ma'am, we don't have time to
stand around and talk it over.

1339
02:03:13,316 --> 02:03:15,511
If you want reasons,
take it up with the commissioner.

1340
02:03:15,619 --> 02:03:18,019
Well, yes.
If he would like to explain to me...

1341
02:03:18,121 --> 02:03:20,715
why he wants the child,
I'd be happy to listen.

1342
02:03:20,824 --> 02:03:23,156
We have a job to do.
Are you going to let us do it?

1343
02:03:23,260 --> 02:03:26,058
I'm not trying to stop you
from doing your job.

1344
02:03:26,162 --> 02:03:28,323
I'm afraid that's exactly
what you are doing.

1345
02:03:28,431 --> 02:03:31,923
Now just a minute, gentlemen.
There's no need for that.

1346
02:03:32,035 --> 02:03:35,300
-What my wife means is that she is--
-What I mean...

1347
02:03:35,405 --> 02:03:38,397
is they cannot have that baby...

1348
02:03:38,508 --> 02:03:40,908
until we get an explanation.

1349
02:03:41,011 --> 02:03:42,911
You're making it
very difficult, ma'am.

1350
02:03:43,013 --> 02:03:47,382
Well, I'm sorry about that.

1351
02:03:47,484 --> 02:03:51,511
Gentlemen, would you please
wait for us in the lobby?

1352
02:03:51,621 --> 02:03:54,920
I want a word with my wife.

1353
02:04:03,867 --> 02:04:05,357
Dear, this is becoming absurd.

1354
02:04:06,469 --> 02:04:08,733
They have no right to bother us.

1355
02:04:09,839 --> 02:04:12,831
That's not the point.
We're involved now.

1356
02:04:12,943 --> 02:04:16,401
In their eyes,
we're helping Walker.

1357
02:04:16,513 --> 02:04:19,243
Well, then they're
just being ridiculous.

1358
02:04:19,349 --> 02:04:23,080
No, we're being ridiculous
if we don't protect ourselves.

1359
02:04:24,187 --> 02:04:25,745
But we are innocent.

1360
02:04:29,392 --> 02:04:32,020
All right.

1361
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:35,359
If that's the way you're going
to be, I'm going back to New York...

1362
02:04:35,465 --> 02:04:37,433
with or without the baby.

1363
02:04:38,568 --> 02:04:43,005
Oh, please...

1364
02:04:43,106 --> 02:04:44,539
don't go.

1365
02:04:46,576 --> 02:04:49,636
Please don't leave me here alone.

1366
02:05:08,732 --> 02:05:10,632
All right, Conklin.
Hold it right where you are.

1367
02:05:10,734 --> 02:05:12,725
You're under arrest! Take him out!

1368
02:05:12,836 --> 02:05:15,304
No, no, no, no!
You're making a mistake!

1369
02:05:15,405 --> 02:05:18,738
For God's sake, I'm not Conklin.
You're making a mistake!

1370
02:05:18,842 --> 02:05:21,743
- There's the man you want!
- You son of a bitch!

1371
02:05:21,845 --> 02:05:25,679
- Hold it! Take that one out too!
- My God!

1372
02:05:35,425 --> 02:05:37,325
All right. Come on.

1373
02:05:39,129 --> 02:05:42,030
All right. Come on.
Straighten up, Willie.

1374
02:05:42,966 --> 02:05:44,490
Are you ready, Mr. Conklin?

1375
02:05:44,601 --> 02:05:47,092
Ready? Ready for what?
What do you mean?

1376
02:05:47,203 --> 02:05:49,865
You know that someone's been
asking for you, don't you?

1377
02:05:51,608 --> 02:05:53,508
What is this?

1378
02:05:53,610 --> 02:05:56,010
It's a joke, huh?
It's a joke, right?

1379
02:05:56,112 --> 02:05:58,580
No joke, Willie.

1380
02:05:58,682 --> 02:06:01,276
The library over there
is worth millions.

1381
02:06:02,385 --> 02:06:06,014
- So?
- And people keep telling me...

1382
02:06:06,122 --> 02:06:08,113
you're a worthless piece of slime.

1383
02:06:08,224 --> 02:06:10,624
- Hold him back!
- Can't talk to me like that!

1384
02:06:10,727 --> 02:06:14,720
Shut up, Willie.
You're going to help us now.

1385
02:06:14,831 --> 02:06:16,731
You're going to talk
to that troublemaker...

1386
02:06:16,833 --> 02:06:19,301
and I mean talk hard
like you never talked before.

1387
02:06:19,402 --> 02:06:21,302
Because he wants you, Willie.

1388
02:06:21,404 --> 02:06:24,202
And if you can't make him
change his demands...

1389
02:06:24,307 --> 02:06:26,468
he's gonna get you.

1390
02:06:27,410 --> 02:06:29,469
I don't have to do this.
I want a lawyer.

1391
02:06:32,148 --> 02:06:35,447
- Waldo. Library, please.
- I got my rights, you know!

1392
02:06:35,552 --> 02:06:38,077
- Walker?
- Speaking.

1393
02:06:38,188 --> 02:06:40,213
We have the fire chief for you.

1394
02:06:41,491 --> 02:06:42,856
Send him over.

1395
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:45,359
Take it.

1396
02:06:47,297 --> 02:06:48,696
Release him.

1397
02:06:51,701 --> 02:06:53,601
Hey, listen to me,
you crazy nigger.

1398
02:06:53,703 --> 02:06:56,069
I've had enough of you,
you hear me?

1399
02:06:56,172 --> 02:06:59,369
You can't be thinking that they're
gonna give me to the likes of you.

1400
02:06:59,476 --> 02:07:02,673
No. I know you ain't that stupid.

1401
02:07:02,779 --> 02:07:05,043
No.
You're one of them smart niggers.

1402
02:07:05,148 --> 02:07:07,275
So how'd you ever own
a car like that, huh?

1403
02:07:07,383 --> 02:07:09,283
So what do you say we just
talk this thing over?

1404
02:07:09,385 --> 02:07:11,910
Yeah, I'm ready to do that. I'll
go halfway with you on this thing.

1405
02:07:12,021 --> 02:07:15,855
I don't mind. Sort of like
you come on over, we'll sit down.

1406
02:07:15,959 --> 02:07:18,018
Have a nice talk, huh?
What do you say?

1407
02:07:18,128 --> 02:07:21,291
The commissioner here says he'll
leave us alone. Gave me his word.

1408
02:07:21,397 --> 02:07:23,126
What do you say, Walker?

1409
02:07:26,102 --> 02:07:28,468
Goddamn it, say something!

1410
02:07:28,571 --> 02:07:31,540
It was a joke, damn you!
Can't you even take a joke?

1411
02:07:31,641 --> 02:07:34,041
You can't talk
to that nigger bastard!

1412
02:07:38,448 --> 02:07:41,212
Jesus to hell!
Say something, would you?

1413
02:07:43,353 --> 02:07:47,119
- Let me speak to Waldo.
- He wants to talk to you.

1414
02:07:53,596 --> 02:07:54,995
Waldo.

1415
02:07:56,299 --> 02:07:57,527
Send him over.

1416
02:07:57,634 --> 02:07:59,534
Walker, listen to me--

1417
02:08:12,749 --> 02:08:15,843
What? No.
What do you think you're doing? No!

1418
02:08:15,952 --> 02:08:19,012
You're not taking me over there!

1419
02:08:19,122 --> 02:08:21,716
Let go of me, you goons!
Let go of me!

1420
02:08:21,825 --> 02:08:23,417
You want to find
your houses burning?

1421
02:08:23,726 --> 02:08:25,819
There's not gonna be
a fireman left in sight.

1422
02:08:25,995 --> 02:08:27,895
You'll see! You'll see!

1423
02:08:27,997 --> 02:08:30,488
Touch one of us, you mess with
every fireman in the country!

1424
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:33,433
Can't somebody please tell me
what is going on?

1425
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:35,629
Can you just give me
a rough idea?

1426
02:08:38,474 --> 02:08:40,840
Good. Tell him
I want to see him right away.

1427
02:08:40,944 --> 02:08:44,141
Would everyone please
leave the room? Thank you.

1428
02:08:44,247 --> 02:08:46,147
Gentlemen? Hurry, please.

1429
02:08:46,249 --> 02:08:48,342
Mr. Elliott, please. Thank you.

1430
02:08:50,353 --> 02:08:53,652
Thank you. Yes.

1431
02:08:53,756 --> 02:08:55,781
The commissioner will see you now.

1432
02:08:57,627 --> 02:08:59,026
Jim.

1433
02:09:40,536 --> 02:09:41,537
Yes? Yes, I'll speak to him.

1434
02:09:41,537 --> 02:09:44,267
Yes? Yes, I'll speak to him.

1435
02:09:56,552 --> 02:09:58,679
Hello, sir. How are you?

1436
02:10:00,123 --> 02:10:01,522
Fine.

1437
02:10:05,028 --> 02:10:08,088
I'd like very much
to have a word with you.

1438
02:10:08,197 --> 02:10:10,665
Would it be all right
if I came over?

1439
02:10:17,206 --> 02:10:19,197
Yes. That'll be fine.

1440
02:10:25,682 --> 02:10:27,741
It's your brother-in-law.

1441
02:10:30,219 --> 02:10:31,709
He wants me to come over.

1442
02:10:32,889 --> 02:10:35,414
Now you know
I can't take the responsibility.

1443
02:10:35,525 --> 02:10:38,016
Yes. Yes, I know.

1444
02:10:41,531 --> 02:10:43,089
I want to go.

1445
02:11:56,939 --> 02:11:58,497
You're a brave man.

1446
02:12:00,777 --> 02:12:03,940
May I ask you a question,
Mr. Walker?

1447
02:12:04,047 --> 02:12:06,208
I can't stop you from asking.

1448
02:12:06,315 --> 02:12:08,340
Do you remember
my brother-in-law...

1449
02:12:09,819 --> 02:12:12,754
the young man
you met at my house?

1450
02:12:12,855 --> 02:12:15,824
Yes. Yes, I believe I do.

1451
02:12:15,925 --> 02:12:19,088
- Was he ever in touch with you?
- Is that why you came over here?

1452
02:12:20,563 --> 02:12:22,929
Well, in part, yes.

1453
02:12:25,068 --> 02:12:27,400
- What's the other part?
- Well...

1454
02:12:27,503 --> 02:12:31,837
I hoped, since we've...

1455
02:12:31,941 --> 02:12:35,274
known each other
under better circumstances--

1456
02:12:35,378 --> 02:12:40,372
I hoped I might prevail on you
to change your--

1457
02:12:48,658 --> 02:12:50,250
to change your mind.

1458
02:12:55,531 --> 02:12:58,762
I haven't seen your brother-in-law.

1459
02:12:58,868 --> 02:13:02,429
But you can go back and tell Mr.
Waldo that I have changed my mind.

1460
02:13:02,538 --> 02:13:04,972
I'm ready to offer him a swap--

1461
02:13:05,074 --> 02:13:07,269
Conklin's life
for the freedom of my men.

1462
02:13:07,376 --> 02:13:10,709
All he's got to do
is deliver my automobile...

1463
02:13:10,813 --> 02:13:12,906
to the front door of this library.

1464
02:13:13,015 --> 02:13:16,542
And when it's dark, my men
will use it to get out of here.

1465
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:20,081
When they're safe...

1466
02:13:20,189 --> 02:13:22,089
and sure they haven't
been followed...

1467
02:13:22,191 --> 02:13:24,091
they'll call me here.

1468
02:13:26,662 --> 02:13:29,722
-And I'll come out with my hands up.
-Hey, Coalhouse!

1469
02:13:29,832 --> 02:13:32,426
You be quiet, you hear?

1470
02:13:36,772 --> 02:13:39,172
Tell Mr. Waldo that,
if he plays it straight with me...

1471
02:13:39,275 --> 02:13:41,675
that's exactly how it will happen.

1472
02:13:42,879 --> 02:13:45,507
- You remember that?
- Yes.

1473
02:13:46,916 --> 02:13:49,578
- Yeah, I think so.
- Good.

1474
02:14:06,702 --> 02:14:10,138
Hey, brother. What is this?
You playing games with us?

1475
02:14:10,239 --> 02:14:14,608
Why you sayin' we leavin' without
you? That ain't gonna happen.

1476
02:14:15,878 --> 02:14:17,778
Zeke, you're a hothead.

1477
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:21,008
You gotta calm down or else
your brains are gonna burn up.

1478
02:14:21,117 --> 02:14:23,017
Well, you said it.

1479
02:14:23,119 --> 02:14:25,110
I mean, Coalhouse, didn't you say--

1480
02:14:25,221 --> 02:14:28,918
didn't you say that you were
gonna stay right here, huh?

1481
02:14:29,025 --> 02:14:30,993
I said a lot of things.

1482
02:14:37,133 --> 02:14:40,330
Then you're messin' with 'em.

1483
02:14:40,436 --> 02:14:43,462
You got somethin' else in mind.

1484
02:14:43,573 --> 02:14:46,064
You see that, Zeke?

1485
02:14:46,175 --> 02:14:50,202
When you calm down, your brain
starts to workin' just fine.

1486
02:14:54,417 --> 02:14:58,046
I don't get it.
I just don't get it.

1487
02:14:58,154 --> 02:15:00,679
It doesn't make sense to me.

1488
02:15:00,790 --> 02:15:03,520
He seemed perfectly rational
and coherent to me.

1489
02:15:03,626 --> 02:15:05,787
Well, maybe he thinks
he can sneak into the car...

1490
02:15:05,895 --> 02:15:07,795
and escape with the rest of them.

1491
02:15:07,897 --> 02:15:11,094
Well, it'll be night, it'll be dark.

1492
02:15:11,200 --> 02:15:12,895
He can't leave the library alone.

1493
02:15:14,270 --> 02:15:16,738
That's all he's got.

1494
02:15:16,839 --> 02:15:20,002
The second we know it's empty,
we can blast that car to bits.

1495
02:15:22,078 --> 02:15:25,673
No. We can't do it.
We can't buy his terms.

1496
02:15:25,781 --> 02:15:27,908
- Why not?
- Look.

1497
02:15:28,017 --> 02:15:29,917
Let's say his men got away.

1498
02:15:30,019 --> 02:15:32,351
All right. There he is,
sitting on the detonator...

1499
02:15:32,455 --> 02:15:34,355
and he knows he's a dead man.

1500
02:15:35,591 --> 02:15:39,425
The only freedom he's got left
is how to die.

1501
02:15:39,528 --> 02:15:41,428
He can let us fry him
in the electric chair...

1502
02:15:41,530 --> 02:15:44,624
or he can go bang and carry
the library to heaven with him.

1503
02:15:44,734 --> 02:15:47,396
I disagree.

1504
02:15:47,503 --> 02:15:49,403
Why?

1505
02:15:49,505 --> 02:15:51,564
I believe he means what he says.

1506
02:15:51,674 --> 02:15:53,574
Well, that's damn big of you...

1507
02:15:53,676 --> 02:15:56,975
but I'm afraid your belief isn't
the iron-plated guarantee I need!

1508
02:15:58,314 --> 02:16:02,512
Well, what if I was in the library
until Mr. Walker gave himself up?

1509
02:16:02,618 --> 02:16:04,813
Would that be sufficient guarantee?

1510
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:10,620
Be a guarantee that you're as crazy
as he is. Are you on the level?

1511
02:16:10,726 --> 02:16:12,785
- Yes!
- You're saying...

1512
02:16:12,895 --> 02:16:16,160
you'd volunteer to go over there
and get yourself blown up?

1513
02:16:16,265 --> 02:16:19,962
If you keep your word and let his
men go free, I have nothing to fear.

1514
02:16:20,069 --> 02:16:23,470
Why, for Christ's sake?
What are you to him?

1515
02:16:24,473 --> 02:16:26,338
I'm no judge of these things,
Mr. Waldo.

1516
02:16:26,442 --> 02:16:30,401
I know the man isn't responsible
for his actions...

1517
02:16:30,513 --> 02:16:33,744
but in everything he's done
there's been a certain logic...

1518
02:16:33,849 --> 02:16:37,945
and, you'll excuse me
for saying it, an integrity.

1519
02:16:40,723 --> 02:16:45,285
I think he wants to be heard.

1520
02:16:45,394 --> 02:16:48,329
That's all. I think that's
what he's wanted all along.

1521
02:16:48,431 --> 02:16:52,299
If he blows himself up,
his story will die with him.

1522
02:16:52,401 --> 02:16:55,495
I think he wants
to bring his case to court.

1523
02:17:13,122 --> 02:17:14,180
Library.

1524
02:17:18,828 --> 02:17:22,696
- Yes?
- I'll accept your new conditions...

1525
02:17:22,798 --> 02:17:25,528
if we can have a man in there
with you until you give yourself up.

1526
02:17:27,103 --> 02:17:29,128
All right then. Send him over.

1527
02:17:29,238 --> 02:17:31,798
Fine, fine.
Thank you, Mr. Walker.

1528
02:17:31,907 --> 02:17:33,807
I'm looking forward to meeting you.

1529
02:17:35,678 --> 02:17:37,578
That's it.

1530
02:17:38,981 --> 02:17:41,575
Keep your fingers crossed,
gentlemen.

1531
02:17:41,684 --> 02:17:43,675
I'll believe it all
when it happens.

1532
02:17:45,688 --> 02:17:47,246
Tell the militia to back off.

1533
02:17:47,356 --> 02:17:49,324
- Keep them on standby
- Yes, sir.

1534
02:17:50,626 --> 02:17:52,821
And get a new Model T
and check that it matches.

1535
02:17:52,928 --> 02:17:55,624
- Right.
- Yes, sir.

1536
02:17:55,731 --> 02:17:59,895
Good luck. Captain,
may I have a word with you?

1537
02:18:00,002 --> 02:18:01,902
Yes, sir.

1538
02:18:04,607 --> 02:18:09,067
Mr. Waldo, may I use the phone?
I want to call my family.

1539
02:18:09,178 --> 02:18:11,078
Of course.

1540
02:18:14,717 --> 02:18:17,550
- What do you think?
- That's okay.

1541
02:18:17,653 --> 02:18:21,555
Essex and Sussex Hotel.
May I help you?

1542
02:18:21,657 --> 02:18:24,558
Room 2 1 6 and 1 8.

1543
02:18:28,397 --> 02:18:31,025
No, I'm sorry.
They checked out this morning, sir.

1544
02:18:31,133 --> 02:18:34,068
Yes, sir. I'm quite sure.

1545
02:18:34,170 --> 02:18:36,468
No. They didn't leave any message.

1546
02:18:36,572 --> 02:18:38,472
You're welcome.

1547
02:18:44,079 --> 02:18:44,213
The area for two blocks
around J.P. Morgan's library...

1548
02:18:44,213 --> 02:18:49,742
The area for two blocks
around J.P. Morgan's library...

1549
02:18:49,852 --> 02:18:53,481
is now an emergency zone.

1550
02:18:53,589 --> 02:18:57,958
Gentlemen, the men you are
following must never suspect...

1551
02:18:58,060 --> 02:19:02,224
repeat, never suspect that
their car is under surveillance.

1552
02:19:02,331 --> 02:19:04,231
And no one makes a move
until you've got...

1553
02:19:04,333 --> 02:19:06,392
the full go ahead from headquarters.

1554
02:19:07,837 --> 02:19:08,895
Understand?

1555
02:19:10,506 --> 02:19:13,669
You shouldn't have any trouble
spotting the target car...

1556
02:19:13,776 --> 02:19:15,971
unless there are a lot
of new Model Ts...

1557
02:19:16,078 --> 02:19:17,978
full of colored people
driving around all night.

1558
02:19:37,399 --> 02:19:39,390
Coalhouse,
they're bringin' it! Look!

1559
02:20:50,673 --> 02:20:52,197
Turn off all the lights.

1560
02:21:10,459 --> 02:21:12,927
Take this.

1561
02:21:13,028 --> 02:21:16,122
It's the telephone number here.

1562
02:21:16,231 --> 02:21:19,098
Call me the minute you're safe
and sure you haven't been followed.

1563
02:21:19,201 --> 02:21:21,533
- Wait a minute.
- I'm staying.

1564
02:21:21,637 --> 02:21:23,628
- What?
- You heard me.

1565
02:21:23,739 --> 02:21:26,640
We ain't goin' nowhere without you,
brother. We just can't do that.

1566
02:21:27,643 --> 02:21:30,908
Think about it.
If I get out of here...

1567
02:21:31,013 --> 02:21:34,676
I'd be hunted every day of my life.

1568
02:21:34,783 --> 02:21:37,217
And that's no kind of life
for a man.

1569
02:21:37,319 --> 02:21:39,412
Is it?

1570
02:21:40,522 --> 02:21:41,784
But no one's seen you.

1571
02:21:43,292 --> 02:21:46,227
No one knows what you look like.

1572
02:21:46,328 --> 02:21:48,660
Tomorrow you'll be free
in the streets.

1573
02:21:48,764 --> 02:21:52,359
And you can start
gettin' folks to talkin'.

1574
02:21:52,468 --> 02:21:55,266
Now that's got to be better
than five dead niggers.

1575
02:21:57,406 --> 02:22:01,604
Look! You all stay here,
and we're all dead men.

1576
02:22:03,512 --> 02:22:05,412
Then what was all of this for?

1577
02:22:08,283 --> 02:22:10,979
You all the only life I got left.

1578
02:22:11,086 --> 02:22:12,986
Now go on.

1579
02:22:17,159 --> 02:22:18,319
Get on out of here!

1580
02:22:26,935 --> 02:22:28,835
Go!

1581
02:23:20,656 --> 02:23:22,556
How's my baby doin'?

1582
02:23:23,759 --> 02:23:25,659
Fine.

1583
02:23:27,896 --> 02:23:29,261
He said any words yet?

1584
02:23:32,601 --> 02:23:34,899
Oh, I mean, I don't know.

1585
02:23:35,003 --> 02:23:38,598
I haven't heard him.

1586
02:23:41,143 --> 02:23:45,045
If I was in prison, I wonder
if they'd let him come and visit me.

1587
02:23:45,147 --> 02:23:46,842
I don't see why not.

1588
02:23:49,585 --> 02:23:52,179
You may find this
hard to believe right now...

1589
02:23:53,522 --> 02:23:55,422
but I believe--
I really do believe...

1590
02:23:55,524 --> 02:23:59,119
that your situation,
legally speaking...

1591
02:23:59,228 --> 02:24:02,857
isn't at all hopeless.

1592
02:24:06,201 --> 02:24:07,225
You think so?

1593
02:24:11,573 --> 02:24:14,770
You're an impressive
and articulate man.

1594
02:24:14,877 --> 02:24:19,041
Certainly nothing like people
have been led to expect.

1595
02:24:26,455 --> 02:24:28,355
I'd like to believe you.

1596
02:24:30,559 --> 02:24:32,891
I really would like that.

1597
02:24:38,300 --> 02:24:42,236
Are you planning to let me
leave this place alive?

1598
02:25:04,660 --> 02:25:07,925
- Sir. Sir, we lost them.
- Where?

1599
02:25:08,030 --> 02:25:11,488
We had them as far as 34th and Lex.
They disappeared...

1600
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:14,501
- before the next lookout post.
- That's one block!

1601
02:25:14,603 --> 02:25:18,004
- Yes, sir.
- Son of a b--

1602
02:25:26,315 --> 02:25:29,807
You sure you weren't followed?

1603
02:25:29,918 --> 02:25:33,012
Good. Good.

1604
02:25:33,121 --> 02:25:36,454
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

1605
02:25:38,961 --> 02:25:41,862
You all take care now, you hear?

1606
02:25:41,964 --> 02:25:43,864
All right.

1607
02:25:55,077 --> 02:25:59,639
Are they safe?

1608
02:26:15,931 --> 02:26:18,491
Well, shouldn't we...

1609
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:20,830
uh, tell them...

1610
02:26:20,936 --> 02:26:23,427
that we're coming?

1611
02:26:26,942 --> 02:26:28,000
Yeah.

1612
02:26:31,613 --> 02:26:35,515
You go on ahead.
Tell 'em I'll be right out.

1613
02:26:39,855 --> 02:26:42,449
- Well--
-Just go on. I'll be with you.

1614
02:26:43,625 --> 02:26:45,525
- Don't--
- Go.

1615
02:26:45,627 --> 02:26:49,859
Don't you think it would be...

1616
02:26:49,965 --> 02:26:51,865
a better idea if we--

1617
02:26:51,967 --> 02:26:54,094
Get the hell out of here!

1618
02:26:54,202 --> 02:26:56,898
Don't you understand anything,
white man?

1619
02:26:59,474 --> 02:27:03,808
Oh, damn it! Damn it!
This is it! I know this is it!

1620
02:27:15,557 --> 02:27:20,358
Lord, I'd hoped I'd have
the courage to know...

1621
02:27:20,462 --> 02:27:23,090
what I should do now.

1622
02:27:23,198 --> 02:27:26,167
You must see
how sick at heart I've been...

1623
02:27:27,869 --> 02:27:31,498
and how I've performed
this thing with little appetite.

1624
02:27:33,175 --> 02:27:37,111
I'd hoped you'd reveal to me
along the way...

1625
02:27:37,212 --> 02:27:40,477
why you put such a rage
in my heart.

1626
02:27:46,254 --> 02:27:48,154
Tell me what to do now!

1627
02:27:51,960 --> 02:27:53,951
Please.

1628
02:27:55,097 --> 02:27:57,258
God, tell me what to do.

1629
02:28:26,395 --> 02:28:28,295
Fire.

1630
02:28:28,397 --> 02:28:30,388
- Sir?
- Fire.

1631
02:30:13,802 --> 02:30:15,235
Champagne!

1632
02:30:25,113 --> 02:30:26,011
Bye-bye!

1633
02:30:40,095 --> 02:30:42,689
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!
