1
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:16,825
Goodness!

2
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:20,725
Hello.

3
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:23,035
Hello.

4
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,815
Congratulations on opening your office.

5
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:30,325
How did you...

6
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:32,575
How did you know about this?

7
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:36,035
Isn't it the opening day of Lawyer Lee Seoyeong's law firm?

8
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:38,815
Yes, it is.

9
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:41,655
Please have a seat and have some tea and rice cakes.

10
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:43,445
It's alright, Yeonhui.

11
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:46,125
It's alright. I won't stay long.

12
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:50,365
I'm going to the bathroom.

13
00:00:55,425 --> 00:00:57,455
What do you think you're doing?

14
00:00:57,455 --> 00:00:59,725
You said we weren't enemies.

15
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:01,675
I came to congratulate the opening of my ex-wife's office.

16
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:03,405
Isn't that cool of me?

17
00:01:03,405 --> 00:01:05,955
- Kang Ujae.
- Seoyeong!

18
00:01:07,495 --> 00:01:09,345
I mean, Lawyer Lee.

19
00:01:09,345 --> 00:01:12,485
We have a visitor. A client.

20
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:17,135
Excuse me.

21
00:01:17,895 --> 00:01:19,795
You're busy already, Lawyer Lee.

22
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:21,825
I'll leave you then.

23
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:47,665
Uin Co.
Oh Bongsu, CEO

24
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:50,845
Our company's working together with the Ilsan county office.

25
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:54,085
We're planning an event to give legal advice to the elderly.

26
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:56,425
I'd like to ask you to help.

27
00:01:56,425 --> 00:01:58,425
I see.

28
00:01:58,425 --> 00:02:02,565
We'll pay for the costs of your consultation fee.

29
00:02:02,565 --> 00:02:05,955
How did you know about my firm?

30
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:11,335
I came to this building for work and happened to see your office.

31
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:18,345
Good bye.

32
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:20,245
Good bye and thank you.

33
00:02:24,635 --> 00:02:26,515
We're going to be successful.

34
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:28,675
A client on the opening day!

35
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:31,925
How did Ujae know?

36
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:36,165
You went to the training institute get together.

37
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:40,225
Rumors spread quickly in our field so Ujae must have heard about it.

38
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:43,515
Hello.

39
00:02:44,725 --> 00:02:46,175
CEO Ko...

40
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:50,455
I know I wasn't invited but I wanted to congratulate you.

41
00:02:51,535 --> 00:02:53,465
How did you know?

42
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,815
We pick up a lot of rumors when we go to court.

43
00:02:55,815 --> 00:02:58,005
I heard you attended the training institute get together too.

44
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:06,385
Thank you.

45
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:08,575
Hey, Mr. Yu.

46
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:10,645
Hi.

47
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:12,245
Wrap up 10 eggs for me.

48
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:15,585
My daughter in law's making omelet rice for me and we're out of eggs.

49
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:20,355
You even run errands for her now.

50
00:03:20,355 --> 00:03:21,935
Wait just a minute.

51
00:03:23,145 --> 00:03:26,905
Pack 3 steamed buns too.
My daughter in law likes them.

52
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,575
WINNERS, donates $100,000 to community welfare

53
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:55,925
"Migyeong, surgical resident at Hanjin University Hospital."

54
00:03:57,425 --> 00:03:59,475
I don't want to marry Migyeong anymore.

55
00:03:59,475 --> 00:04:03,975
Dad, when it comes to men and women,

56
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:06,935
there are a lot of reasons why people decide not to marry.

57
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:23,065
Dad.

58
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:24,745
Migyeong...

59
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:27,885
You said she's an orphan.

60
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:29,675
Is she Ujae's sister?

61
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:33,675
Is that why you broke up?

62
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:39,365
How did you find out?

63
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:42,735
Does Seoyeong know too?

64
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:47,215
She doesn't know about it.

65
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:50,065
How did you find out?

66
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:53,465
What about Hojeong?

67
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:55,845
She knew, didn't she?

68
00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:01,055
Yes.

69
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:08,555
How could this happen?

70
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:12,705
Dad, it's all in the past now.

71
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:15,665
Yes...

72
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:18,325
Yes.

73
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:20,515
That's why...

74
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:24,815
Don't tell me that you're sorry.

75
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:29,035
Okay.

76
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:31,675
Alright.

77
00:05:31,675 --> 00:05:33,275
I won't...

78
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,815
How did you find out?

79
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:40,315
Did Hojeong tell you?

80
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:49,615
Father, you went to buy eggs.
Why are you so late?

81
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:54,585
Did you meet up with Sangu?

82
00:05:54,585 --> 00:05:56,625
Yes. Here.

83
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,845
Father, what took so long?

84
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:03,105
The fried rice got cold.
I heated it up again.

85
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:04,995
Oh, the thing is...

86
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:07,475
I think I have the flu.

87
00:06:07,475 --> 00:06:11,435
You two eat without me.
I need to get some rest.

88
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:17,795
Come inside.

89
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:41,335
Kang Ujae's mother's interview was in the paper.

90
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,365
Oh, no.

91
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,605
Why is that bad things keep happening?

92
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:50,265
Father must be so distressed.

93
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:52,865
I think he blames himself for everything.

94
00:06:52,865 --> 00:06:55,885
Tell him it isn't his fault.

95
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:58,075
Words won't comfort him.

96
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:02,285
Oh, no.

97
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:04,885
I should make him some porridge.

98
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:44,565
Your throat will hurt if you're consulting people all day.

99
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,015
You'll get so tired as well.

100
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:50,725
I've worked 12 hours at a supermarket opening to coax customers in the past.

101
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:54,335
Why does the person in charge want to go with you?

102
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:59,935
They want to brief me and let me travel in comfort.

103
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:01,685
That's good.

104
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:04,265
Good morning.

105
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:05,605
Goodness...

106
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:13,385
It's so early.
What do you think you're doing?

107
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:15,745
Let's go, Lawyer Lee Seoyeong.

108
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:21,315
Aren't you going to Ilsan to give legal advice to the elderly?

109
00:08:21,315 --> 00:08:23,195
I'm the person in charge.

110
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,185
You're the one in charge?

111
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:26,985
Yes.

112
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,605
A company called Uin asked for my services.

113
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:35,265
Why are you in charge, Ujae?

114
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,995
They're our vendor.

115
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:40,265
I guess you've figured it out.
I asked them to hire you.

116
00:08:40,265 --> 00:08:41,445
Why?

117
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:44,805
Why ask your vendor to do that?
Why pretend to be the one in charge?

118
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:46,665
Let's talk about it on the way.

119
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:49,345
The elders are waiting. Let's go.

120
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:51,345
Do you think I'll go with you?

121
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:55,415
You signed a contract to give legal advice.

122
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:58,245
They made reservations.
Everyone's waiting for you.

123
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:02,465
That company holds community events once a year.

124
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:03,915
I decided to butt in.

125
00:09:03,915 --> 00:09:07,565
I'm not using a group of elderly people for my own benefit.

126
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:14,535
Really?

127
00:09:15,675 --> 00:09:17,885
I have business with you.

128
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:21,865
I had to do this so you'd at least show me your face.

129
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:24,755
Then I'll go in my car.

130
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:28,525
We have to go together so we can discuss the event.

131
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:30,385
Kang Ujae...

132
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:32,215
I'll wait for you downstairs.

133
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:39,155
I don't believe this.

134
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,785
I think he's great.

135
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,325
Aren't you going?

136
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:51,295
It's for business.

137
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:52,715
I'm going.

138
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:54,925
We got paid. I have to go.

139
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,365
Cafe mocha.

140
00:10:06,895 --> 00:10:09,535
I don't feel like anything sweet at the moment.

141
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,925
Then Americano.

142
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,885
Ujae, why are you doing this?

143
00:10:14,885 --> 00:10:16,505
Don't get the wrong idea.

144
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:19,445
I'm not going to ask you to get back together with me.

145
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:23,445
But it isn't fair.

146
00:10:23,445 --> 00:10:25,905
I didn't get to explain myself.

147
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:29,155
I never got to tell you how I feel.

148
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:32,935
Why do you have to explain?

149
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:35,725
Are you insisting on hearing an explanation from me?

150
00:10:36,155 --> 00:10:38,055
I said I want to explain.

151
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:41,415
I want to explain myself,
not listen to you.

152
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:43,415
I have to tell you.

153
00:10:47,075 --> 00:10:48,655
You know my personality.

154
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:51,245
If I want to do something, I have to do it.

155
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:54,255
So I used a trick.

156
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:58,185
I won't interfere with your work or take up your time.

157
00:10:58,185 --> 00:10:59,355
Get in.

158
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,235
They're all over 65 years old.

159
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:22,535
It's 30 minutes per person for 8 hours.
That's 16 people.

160
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:24,285
Alright.

161
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:27,765
This is a report of the consultation content.

162
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:27,785
Read it before we get there.
This is a report of the consultation content.

163
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:29,235
Read it before we get there.

164
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:34,295
You wanted to explain yourself.

165
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:36,025
Go on.

166
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:37,435
You're on your way to work.

167
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:40,095
I don't want to be rude and talk about personal affairs.

168
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:44,305
I don't want to talk about it with you afterwards.

169
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:48,725
I won't force you to give me time.
Don't worry about that.

170
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:52,845
Then when are you going to explain yourself?

171
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,615
I'll make time to do it.
Don't worry.

172
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:02,665
Free legal consultation for the elderly

173
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:04,745
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

174
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:06,705
Manager Heo, this is Lawyer Lee Seoyeong.

175
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,025
Lawyer Lee, he's in charge of this event.

176
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:10,865
Hello, I'm Lee Seoyeong.

177
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:13,065
I'm Heo Byeongu.

178
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,185
He'll take care of the event.

179
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:17,625
You just have to give advice to those who've registered.

180
00:12:19,795 --> 00:12:21,525
Please come this way.

181
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:24,375
Yes, Secretary Kim.

182
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,845
I'll be there soon.

183
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:39,555
He was supposed to brief me before the meeting.

184
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:41,365
And he left without telling me?

185
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:51,725
The vice president just got back.

186
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:55,095
Alright.

187
00:12:55,095 --> 00:12:57,735
Tell him to come to my office after the meeting.

188
00:12:58,585 --> 00:13:00,955
I'm sorry I'm late.
Something came up.

189
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:03,055
Sit down.
Let's begin the meeting.

190
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:09,155
Ms. Bang said you could take the day off today.

191
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,295
It's okay. I have to do something.

192
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:16,725
- Still...
- It's alright. I'm fine.

193
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:28,225
If your son got locked up for gambling repeatedly,

194
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,235
he can't just be released.

195
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:31,855
He needs to go to court.

196
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:35,365
Do we need to hire a lawyer then?

197
00:13:35,365 --> 00:13:37,585
If you can afford it.

198
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:40,165
Otherwise, there are also public defenders,

199
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:42,285
lawyers provided by the government.

200
00:13:42,285 --> 00:13:45,395
Legal fees... You don't need to pay them.

201
00:13:45,395 --> 00:13:46,975
Really?

202
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,125
Thank you.

203
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:54,775
- Thank you.
- Good bye.

204
00:13:55,365 --> 00:13:57,025
Good bye.

205
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:59,315
Great work.
There's just one more to go.

206
00:13:59,315 --> 00:14:02,025
Could you call me a taxi to arrive at 5 o'clock?

207
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:03,185
Sure.

208
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:05,735
Sir, please come over here.

209
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:06,625
Welcome.

210
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,135
Hello.

211
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:39,315
- We're finished now.
- Please.

212
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:42,865
- Come next time.
- It won't take long.

213
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:44,115
Ma'am.

214
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:45,305
Lawyer!

215
00:14:45,305 --> 00:14:47,715
You need to make a reservation.

216
00:14:47,715 --> 00:14:49,265
We're done for the day.

217
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:50,865
Here. I have money.

218
00:14:50,865 --> 00:14:53,505
I brought money with me.

219
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:57,265
Manager Heo.

220
00:14:57,265 --> 00:14:58,235
Yes?

221
00:14:58,235 --> 00:15:00,615
It's alright. Please let her in.

222
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:07,755
My grandson is 18 years old.

223
00:15:07,755 --> 00:15:10,975
He's in prison right now.

224
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:13,445
What did he do wrong?

225
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,145
He ran over someone.

226
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:17,375
Excuse me?

227
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:21,565
He's one of the top 5 students in his grade.

228
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:29,095
He drank and took the car out.
He ran over 2 people.

229
00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:33,115
I think I read about it in the papers.

230
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:34,765
Yes.

231
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:37,725
It was on the news and in the papers.

232
00:15:37,725 --> 00:15:47,425
Anyway, he's due for trial now but the brat won't open his mouth.

233
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:51,235
He won't speak? Why not?

234
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:54,895
If I knew, I wouldn't be here.

235
00:15:59,385 --> 00:16:01,225
It's $1,000.

236
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:05,855
I saved up to pay for his university fees.

237
00:16:06,605 --> 00:16:08,555
Lawyer...

238
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:11,145
Please take on his case.

239
00:16:11,145 --> 00:16:16,185
He needs to explain himself.

240
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:19,105
He needs to speak up in order to reduce his penalty.

241
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:24,555
Did you raise him yourself?
He doesn't have any parents?

242
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:30,885
He does but they're just parents on paper.

243
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:41,265
You're late.

244
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:43,065
Isn't she finished yet?

245
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:48,365
We finished but one elderly lady showed up without notice.

246
00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:50,765
Lawyer Lee agreed to see her.

247
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:52,775
Really?

248
00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:57,615
What's his name?

249
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,225
You must've had a hard day.

250
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,415
Here.

251
00:17:12,735 --> 00:17:15,395
It's okay. I got paid for it.

252
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:17,395
My throat does hurt a little.

253
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:32,455
Does it hurt a lot?
Let's go to the pharmacy.

254
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:35,415
I'm asking you to not talk to me.

255
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:39,325
Alright.

256
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,925
I won't talk to you until you open your eyes again. Rest.

257
00:17:56,865 --> 00:17:58,565
I want to treat my lawyer.

258
00:17:58,565 --> 00:18:01,765
I heard you just ate rice rolls for lunch.

259
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:03,675
I don't want to eat. Let's go.

260
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:05,945
I went to Ilsan, went back to Seoul for a meeting.

261
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:09,425
I took care of work and came back.
I missed lunch.

262
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:11,495
I was too nervous for breakfast.

263
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:13,485
I'm starting to feel dizzy.

264
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,855
What do you want to have?

265
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:33,225
Two of whatever takes the least time to make.

266
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:35,755
Two of whatever takes the longest to make.

267
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:40,305
Two of the quickest menu.

268
00:18:40,305 --> 00:18:43,005
Wild herb bibimbap can be prepared almost immediately.

269
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:45,725
- We'll have two of that.
- Yes.

270
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:51,765
I've gotten tamer, haven't I?

271
00:18:59,045 --> 00:19:01,185
I thought a lot about it.

272
00:19:01,185 --> 00:19:05,775
A person's past makes who they are in the present.

273
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:08,475
Ujae.

274
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:09,875
I'm talking about myself.

275
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,825
Listen just until the food arrives.

276
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:18,815
For me...

277
00:19:18,815 --> 00:19:22,145
My father is too charismatic.

278
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:25,335
I lived in an environment where his judgment was law.

279
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:29,445
My parents didn't converse.

280
00:19:29,445 --> 00:19:31,175
I didn't converse with them either.

281
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:36,275
i never spoke to anyone about my feelings.

282
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,835
I never asked what I should do.

283
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:41,905
I never asked for advice or spoke honestly.

284
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:48,885
I guess I ended up being just like my father.

285
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:51,875
I judged and thought about things from only my perspective.

286
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:54,425
I pushed people.

287
00:19:58,075 --> 00:20:01,035
When I found out about your father...

288
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:04,065
It was so typical of me...

289
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:07,175
I thought only from my perspective.

290
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,455
I didn't think that there would be a story.

291
00:20:29,455 --> 00:20:33,815
I thought the Lee Seoyeong I knew had done something unforgivable.

292
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:41,425
The Lee Seoyeong I thought I knew...

293
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:44,045
I didn't even know who you really were.

294
00:20:51,855 --> 00:20:57,365
I thought of you only from within the boundaries I'd created.

295
00:20:57,365 --> 00:21:00,105
I saw you only from my perspective.

296
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:05,065
I didn't think of why you couldn't tell me.

297
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:09,035
I felt betrayed that you didn't trust me.

298
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:13,365
I judged you from my standards.

299
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:20,475
Are you repenting now?
I thought you wanted to explain.

300
00:21:20,475 --> 00:21:21,975
Yes.

301
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:29,945
I thought about when Seongjae's story came out in the open.

302
00:21:29,945 --> 00:21:33,085
Seongjae's my father's son.

303
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:36,525
I wanted to hide that from you too.

304
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:39,505
I didn't want my father to look easy.

305
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:47,805
Aren't you eating?
You said you're hungry.

306
00:21:49,665 --> 00:21:53,235
If I finish eating you might get up.

307
00:21:54,495 --> 00:21:56,865
Then I don't have time to talk.

308
00:21:58,055 --> 00:21:59,575
Talk after you finish.

309
00:21:59,575 --> 00:22:02,105
It's alright.

310
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:04,195
Eat. Listen as you eat.

311
00:22:09,215 --> 00:22:12,635
Eat first. I'll wait until you're done eating.

312
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:16,455
Will you do that for me?

313
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:17,815
How many minutes do I get?

314
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,405
Just 5 minutes.

315
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:37,125
Eat slowly.

316
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:41,825
I won't take responsibility if you choke.

317
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:44,675
I won't choke. This is delicious.

318
00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:56,805
Where did I leave off?

319
00:22:58,365 --> 00:23:01,345
You don't have to keep going.
I've heard enough.

320
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:06,145
Really? That's all for today then.

321
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:12,615
Someone told me this.

322
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:15,745
I'm really good at forcing people into doing things.

323
00:23:15,745 --> 00:23:18,065
I have a way of giving people no other choice.

324
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:21,085
I want to try to fix that.

325
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,955
Where should I drop you off?

326
00:23:27,595 --> 00:23:29,805
At the office.

327
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:31,805
Okay!

328
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:26,305
Sorry we're closed...

329
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:36,575
I came to tell you something.

330
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,325
I'm glad you're still here.

331
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:41,975
How did you know I'd be here?

332
00:24:44,425 --> 00:24:46,865
How did you know?

333
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:49,935
Don't ever come here again.

334
00:24:49,935 --> 00:24:53,305
I didn't get the chance to introduce myself properly last time...

335
00:24:54,145 --> 00:24:55,615
Father.

336
00:24:59,645 --> 00:25:04,185
I'm sorry I didn't speak up despite knowing who you were.

337
00:25:04,185 --> 00:25:06,825
And thank you for helping me to understand Seoyeong.

338
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:10,755
The two of you...

339
00:25:10,755 --> 00:25:12,725
I heard you broke up.

340
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:17,865
I broke up to help her feel at peace.

341
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:21,765
I had no choice but to let her go.

342
00:25:21,765 --> 00:25:24,095
You know what she's like.

343
00:25:31,755 --> 00:25:35,165
I thought about things after listening to you.

344
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:38,385
I understood why she did that.

345
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:41,875
Also why she couldn't keep living with me.

346
00:25:43,105 --> 00:25:46,495
I realized how she must have felt living with me.

347
00:25:46,495 --> 00:25:49,135
I understood how nervous she must have been.

348
00:25:50,545 --> 00:25:52,815
So I couldn't force her into staying with me.

349
00:25:56,225 --> 00:25:57,805
I see.

350
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:01,265
Seoyeong...

351
00:26:01,265 --> 00:26:03,125
She's difficult.

352
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:04,915
She's a fool.

353
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:06,975
She's twisted.

354
00:26:09,355 --> 00:26:11,555
I made her that way.

355
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:18,215
Children should live through the comfort of their parents.

356
00:26:19,405 --> 00:26:26,865
She had to take the burden of her mother and Sangu too.

357
00:26:28,395 --> 00:26:30,825
She hung in there on those frail legs of hers.

358
00:26:32,655 --> 00:26:35,425
How could she be normal?

359
00:26:36,945 --> 00:26:39,965
How much tenacity could she have?

360
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,655
How skilled could she become?

361
00:26:44,655 --> 00:26:46,415
She's human too.

362
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,785
She's human.

363
00:26:52,165 --> 00:26:53,545
Yes.

364
00:26:54,175 --> 00:26:59,175
She hung in there on nothing but her pride.

365
00:27:00,515 --> 00:27:01,875
But...

366
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:06,645
Then she found that you and I were involved.

367
00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:09,095
She must have felt so humiliated.

368
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:12,965
She wouldn't have been able to look at your face.

369
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,375
I'm sorry...

370
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:22,475
To you and to your parents too...

371
00:27:24,335 --> 00:27:26,395
I'm so sorry.

372
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,815
I'm terribly sorry.

373
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:37,705
I didn't come to hear that.

374
00:27:42,085 --> 00:27:44,515
It's also my fault that we ended up this way.

375
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:50,195
You know that.
You know I'm forceful.

376
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:59,775
Seoyeong and I failed in our marriage but this isn't the end for us.

377
00:28:09,435 --> 00:28:10,935
Seoyeong's birthday

378
00:28:12,595 --> 00:28:14,325
Still...

379
00:28:15,405 --> 00:28:17,945
She was a good person, right?

380
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:20,295
Who?

381
00:28:21,915 --> 00:28:23,545
Seoyeong?

382
00:28:24,515 --> 00:28:26,845
There was nothing to criticize.

383
00:28:27,535 --> 00:28:29,335
But that's how it is.

384
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:32,165
That's the thing about con men.

385
00:28:32,165 --> 00:28:35,945
They make their victims fully trust them.

386
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:39,675
Are you saying Seoyeong is a con artist?

387
00:28:39,675 --> 00:28:42,825
Con artists begin by lying to their victims.

388
00:28:43,715 --> 00:28:45,275
By the way...

389
00:28:46,045 --> 00:28:50,915
Are you really going to donate $100,000 every year on Seongjae's birthday?

390
00:28:50,915 --> 00:28:54,025
I have to. It's in the papers.

391
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:56,475
I can't lie to the entire nation.

392
00:29:03,415 --> 00:29:06,635
Make time for me tonight.

393
00:29:07,715 --> 00:29:10,455
I don't want to make time to listen to your excuses.

394
00:29:12,015 --> 00:29:14,745
I have something else to do.

395
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:22,935
It isn't easy to overcome differences in status.

396
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:49,555
Dr. Kang Migyeong.

397
00:29:54,505 --> 00:29:57,075
Why damage the glass?
The glass is innocent.

398
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:02,985
You lied.

399
00:30:02,985 --> 00:30:05,375
Of course people feel betrayed.

400
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:09,795
You'll own this hospital one day.

401
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:13,775
So this glass belongs to you too?

402
00:30:13,775 --> 00:30:17,295
Professor, why are you so mean to me?

403
00:30:17,295 --> 00:30:18,185
What did I do?

404
00:30:18,185 --> 00:30:22,725
You're eccentric when it comes to me. You are.

405
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,895
I admit it.

406
00:30:25,895 --> 00:30:27,175
Why?

407
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:28,845
Why do you do that?

408
00:30:28,845 --> 00:30:32,045
- Responsibility...
Stop talking about doctors' responsibilities.

409
00:30:33,555 --> 00:30:36,365
Responsibility as a doctor!

410
00:30:36,365 --> 00:30:38,805
That comes after personal responsibility.

411
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,615
Excuse me?

412
00:30:43,095 --> 00:30:47,025
The Kang Migyeong I knew wasn't like this.

413
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,005
What?

414
00:30:50,005 --> 00:30:52,295
Do you know me?

415
00:30:52,295 --> 00:30:55,225
The first time I met you was at this hospital.

416
00:30:57,595 --> 00:30:59,215
Are you sure about that?

417
00:31:10,845 --> 00:31:13,275
Seoyeong's birthday

418
00:31:34,925 --> 00:31:37,365
2013 K-POP Super Concert

419
00:32:02,135 --> 00:32:06,355
Pack Seoyeong's things from the closet.

420
00:32:06,355 --> 00:32:09,985
Remove her books, desk and everything else from the study.

421
00:32:17,165 --> 00:32:18,615
Yes, Executive Yun.

422
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:23,155
Can we meet up today?

423
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:26,855
Today?

424
00:32:29,235 --> 00:32:30,835
What time?

425
00:32:52,775 --> 00:32:55,335
Spend an enjoyable time with your husband.

426
00:33:02,385 --> 00:33:05,385
Kang Gibeom

427
00:33:08,805 --> 00:33:11,315
What is it?

428
00:33:11,315 --> 00:33:13,795
Make some time for me this evening.

429
00:33:13,795 --> 00:33:15,225
Come with me to a concert.

430
00:33:15,225 --> 00:33:17,555
What are you talking about?

431
00:33:17,555 --> 00:33:20,785
I have an appointment this evening.
Go with Gangsun.

432
00:33:21,645 --> 00:33:22,785
Alright then.

433
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:30,385
What did you expect?

434
00:33:43,615 --> 00:33:47,985
He's supposed to be acting on this.
He's vanished into thin air!

435
00:33:50,235 --> 00:33:52,505
If he got fired from the home shopping network,

436
00:33:52,505 --> 00:33:55,485
where is he eating and sleeping?

437
00:33:59,615 --> 00:34:02,275
Does he really want a divorce?

438
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,455
Yes, Jiseon. What is it?

439
00:34:09,455 --> 00:34:14,215
Gangsun, come with me to a concert tonight.

440
00:34:15,815 --> 00:34:19,295
Sorry. It's my son in law's birthday tomorrow.

441
00:34:19,295 --> 00:34:20,915
I'm out grocery shopping.

442
00:34:20,915 --> 00:34:23,725
Go with Seongjae. Bye.

443
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:28,455
How can I go to a concert when my husband is missing?

444
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:36,305
You don't go out often.

445
00:34:36,305 --> 00:34:38,775
You don't meet many people.

446
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:41,045
Loneliness is your friend.

447
00:34:45,995 --> 00:34:47,575
Yes.

448
00:34:48,745 --> 00:34:50,855
That's what my life's like.

449
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:53,065
I can't trust anyone.

450
00:34:53,955 --> 00:34:56,115
I can't depend on anyone.

451
00:35:29,455 --> 00:35:32,845
I wanted to meet you and ask you for a favor.

452
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:35,595
A favor?

453
00:35:38,925 --> 00:35:40,805
Just for one day...

454
00:35:42,345 --> 00:35:46,755
Will you join me in doing the things I wanted to do?

455
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:58,035
What are the things you wanted to do?

456
00:36:05,775 --> 00:36:07,835
Excuse me.

457
00:36:10,195 --> 00:36:12,545
- Here, take this one.
- Okay.

458
00:36:15,575 --> 00:36:17,265
Didn't you go to the bathroom?

459
00:36:17,265 --> 00:36:18,845
You have no idea, do you?

460
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:24,035
Cola and popcorn was made for the movies.

461
00:36:24,825 --> 00:36:28,135
Here, it's sweet flavored.
Women like that.

462
00:36:32,895 --> 00:36:34,325
Thanks.

463
00:38:32,245 --> 00:38:34,025
Excuse me.

464
00:38:35,165 --> 00:38:38,215
Aren't you from my music academy?

465
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,595
Don't talk to me.

466
00:38:40,595 --> 00:38:41,655
Excuse me?

467
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:44,835
Your husband could get the wrong idea.

468
00:38:44,835 --> 00:38:47,215
I didn't bring him with me.

469
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:54,245
Did you come with a friend?

470
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:56,425
I came alone.

471
00:38:56,425 --> 00:38:58,265
Alone?

472
00:39:03,145 --> 00:39:05,185
You came alone too.

473
00:39:05,185 --> 00:39:07,705
Why are you so shocked to hear that I came alone?

474
00:39:07,705 --> 00:39:10,475
I gave you the tickets to come with your husband.

475
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:15,085
Why didn't you come with your wife then?

476
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:17,805
I can't come here with "Mrs. No."

477
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:19,195
Excuse me?

478
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:23,125
My wife always says no whenever I ask her to do something.

479
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:25,075
So she's Mrs. No.

480
00:39:26,585 --> 00:39:31,085
Then my husband's name should be Mr. No.

481
00:39:35,925 --> 00:39:37,895
I'm sorry.

482
00:39:37,895 --> 00:39:40,595
I've been rehearsing since morning.
I haven't eaten all day.

483
00:39:48,485 --> 00:39:52,465
You showed me a movie so I'll treat you to a meal.

484
00:39:52,465 --> 00:39:54,215
What would you like?

485
00:39:57,675 --> 00:39:59,365
Can we...

486
00:40:00,495 --> 00:40:03,125
Can we eat at my place?

487
00:40:06,065 --> 00:40:07,695
Your place?

488
00:40:18,785 --> 00:40:21,075
I'm a regular here.
Are you shocked?

489
00:40:22,285 --> 00:40:23,955
This is all I can afford.

490
00:40:25,265 --> 00:40:28,745
Why do you think that I'd be shocked?

491
00:40:28,745 --> 00:40:31,195
Because you've never been to a place like this.

492
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:33,315
"Do people eat standing up?"

493
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:39,025
Do magicians learn to read people's minds too?

494
00:40:39,025 --> 00:40:40,645
How do you know everything?

495
00:40:40,645 --> 00:40:42,065
Me?

496
00:40:42,585 --> 00:40:45,745
It was the same last time with the tarot cards.

497
00:40:45,745 --> 00:40:49,005
You're like a fortune teller.

498
00:40:49,935 --> 00:40:52,255
That's the fun of magic.

499
00:40:52,255 --> 00:40:54,995
Shocking and surprising people gives us pleasure.

500
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:56,755
It's a pleasurable lie.

501
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:58,845
A pleasurable lie.

502
00:40:59,775 --> 00:41:02,305
Lies...

503
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:08,735
They can be pleasurable too.

504
00:41:19,325 --> 00:41:20,255
Oh, my...

505
00:41:27,605 --> 00:41:29,855
Wow, that's amazing.

506
00:41:31,285 --> 00:41:33,375
Here, eat up.

507
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:35,845
When you're lonely, you should pig out.

508
00:41:37,405 --> 00:41:39,195
How did you know that I was lonely?

509
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:41,445
That's right. I'm a hermit.

510
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:43,345
All human are lonely.

511
00:41:44,945 --> 00:41:46,895
You said I'm a hermit.

512
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:48,575
You're breaking out of that.

513
00:41:49,355 --> 00:41:51,135
Me?

514
00:41:51,135 --> 00:41:52,385
When?

515
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:56,085
Today's the first time you've been to a concert by yourself.

516
00:42:00,535 --> 00:42:03,115
I told you it's a charm that will help you break free.

517
00:42:04,345 --> 00:42:06,335
Was it really a lucky charm?

518
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,315
Did you know that I'd come alone?

519
00:42:10,485 --> 00:42:12,235
You didn't.

520
00:42:12,515 --> 00:42:16,295
You hid thinking that I'd come with my husband.

521
00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:21,125
For the first time, you're not eating with family or a friend.

522
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,915
You're eating with someone else and chatting with them right now.

523
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:30,655
Then is the sunshine really entering my life?

524
00:42:31,565 --> 00:42:32,795
For sure.

525
00:43:01,905 --> 00:43:05,465
I wanted to make seaweed soup for you.

526
00:43:09,575 --> 00:43:12,125
You made my favorite dishes.

527
00:43:15,785 --> 00:43:20,305
You've had poor bowels since you were born.

528
00:43:20,305 --> 00:43:23,375
So don't eat cold foods in the summer, alright?

529
00:43:27,175 --> 00:43:28,365
I won't.

530
00:43:39,655 --> 00:43:43,065
The CEO's wife raised you well.

531
00:43:49,965 --> 00:43:54,965
I thought a lot about what you said to me last time.

532
00:43:59,395 --> 00:44:01,885
Everything you said is right.

533
00:44:09,145 --> 00:44:12,065
I fooled myself.

534
00:44:13,515 --> 00:44:18,665
As you said, I was always by your side...

535
00:44:18,665 --> 00:44:21,035
So I...

536
00:44:23,175 --> 00:44:26,035
I fooled myself thinking I was your mom.

537
00:44:31,465 --> 00:44:33,065
I'll leave.

538
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,805
The actions I did for you may not be what you want.

539
00:44:40,805 --> 00:44:44,305
I didn't think about that.

540
00:44:46,245 --> 00:44:51,895
I grew up at an orphanage not knowing who my parents were.

541
00:44:53,145 --> 00:44:56,675
I was so hungry.

542
00:44:58,105 --> 00:45:00,305
I felt so empty.

543
00:45:03,025 --> 00:45:05,175
So...

544
00:45:05,175 --> 00:45:08,195
I wanted you to take over your dad's company.

545
00:45:08,195 --> 00:45:12,025
I wanted you to live in comfort and have an abundant life.

546
00:45:12,775 --> 00:45:15,705
"Why take up acting and live such a hard life?"

547
00:45:15,705 --> 00:45:17,305
That's what I thought.

548
00:45:23,005 --> 00:45:24,845
That's why I did that.

549
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:32,565
Even now, all I want is for you to be happy.

550
00:45:32,565 --> 00:45:40,375
Now, I'm going to try and live a happy life too.

551
00:45:50,835 --> 00:45:52,245
Eat up.

552
00:46:01,305 --> 00:46:05,345
You try the seaweed in sesame oil like this.

553
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,955
Fry the seaweed in the sesame oil.

554
00:46:07,955 --> 00:46:13,085
Then pour water.
Hot, boiling water.

555
00:46:13,085 --> 00:46:15,285
- Into the pot.
- Pour it like this.

556
00:46:15,855 --> 00:46:17,995
Boil the water, pour it.

557
00:46:19,015 --> 00:46:20,655
Then?

558
00:46:20,655 --> 00:46:22,145
Then it's easy.

559
00:46:22,145 --> 00:46:25,845
Season it, add garlic.
It's really easy.

560
00:46:25,845 --> 00:46:31,405
You need to boil it and let it simmer for a long time.

561
00:46:34,465 --> 00:46:37,085
Simmer for a long time.

562
00:46:38,205 --> 00:46:42,725
Father, does simmer mean I have to reduce the heat and boil for a long time?

563
00:46:42,725 --> 00:46:44,455
That's right.

564
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:46,495
But father

565
00:46:46,495 --> 00:46:50,905
why is Sangu's registered birthday different to his real birthday?

566
00:46:51,555 --> 00:46:54,445
Seoyeong was really ill.

567
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:56,655
Seoyeong was sick?

568
00:46:57,065 --> 00:47:03,055
Sangu was okay. Seoyeong had pneumonia and went into the incubator.

569
00:47:03,055 --> 00:47:06,185
The doctor said she could die.

570
00:47:06,755 --> 00:47:09,125
Goodness. What happened?

571
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:12,485
What do you think?
Fortunately, she survived.

572
00:47:13,925 --> 00:47:17,695
Why did you register Sangu's birthday later then?

573
00:47:17,695 --> 00:47:21,285
Did you register the same birthdays because they were twins?

574
00:47:22,755 --> 00:47:27,335
I thought Seoyeong would die if we registered Sangu first.

575
00:47:27,335 --> 00:47:30,495
So we postponed his birthday.

576
00:47:32,075 --> 00:47:35,205
It's a relief that Seoyeong recovered quickly.

577
00:47:36,785 --> 00:47:40,675
I felt like i had earned the entire world.

578
00:47:53,285 --> 00:47:55,985
Thank you.

579
00:48:23,105 --> 00:48:27,035
Are we having seaweed soup for breakfast today?

580
00:48:27,035 --> 00:48:29,915
No, I made dried pollack soup.

581
00:48:30,715 --> 00:48:32,855
Then why does it smell like seaweed soup?

582
00:48:32,855 --> 00:48:34,535
They must have made it next door.

583
00:48:35,945 --> 00:48:38,455
Why does it smell?
We didn't open the windows.

584
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:58,085
Are you having dinner at your in laws place?

585
00:48:58,085 --> 00:48:59,745
Yes.

586
00:48:59,745 --> 00:49:02,345
Go there, cut a cake and light candles.

587
00:49:02,345 --> 00:49:05,395
Have a good birthday party.

588
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,935
We will, father.

589
00:49:43,905 --> 00:49:45,695
Has she gone to work already?

590
00:50:36,595 --> 00:50:38,735
Borrow up to $12,000 on the spot!

591
00:50:41,285 --> 00:50:46,585
How much longer is he going to do this?
It's his son in law's birthday!

592
00:50:49,025 --> 00:50:53,245
Oh! He doesn't know that it's Sangu's birthday.

593
00:50:56,905 --> 00:50:59,045
It's Sangu's birthday today.

594
00:50:59,045 --> 00:51:02,325
They're coming over for dinner so you'd better be here!

595
00:51:05,935 --> 00:51:09,895
He has to come for his son in law's first birthday with us.

596
00:51:12,165 --> 00:51:16,235
It's your first birthday with us.
I'm really sorry.

597
00:51:17,565 --> 00:51:20,015
I can't tell you the reason

598
00:51:20,015 --> 00:51:24,515
but I'm at a turning point in my life right now.

599
00:51:25,635 --> 00:51:27,325
Try to understand, Sangu.

600
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:31,065
I don't mind.

601
00:51:32,315 --> 00:51:33,805
But what is it?

602
00:51:33,805 --> 00:51:36,425
Never!

603
00:51:36,425 --> 00:51:39,015
You don't need to worry at all!

604
00:51:42,325 --> 00:51:44,185
And...

605
00:51:45,555 --> 00:51:47,085
Here.

606
00:51:53,895 --> 00:51:56,205
What's this?

607
00:51:58,225 --> 00:52:00,445
For the first time in my life,

608
00:52:00,445 --> 00:52:03,105
I earned that money doing what I want to do.

609
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,565
It's your birthday gift.

610
00:52:09,295 --> 00:52:10,655
Father...

611
00:52:12,035 --> 00:52:15,625
Don't tell Hojeong about it.
Use it as emergency money.

612
00:52:20,535 --> 00:52:24,335
Don't worry. I made seaweed soup for myself this morning.

613
00:52:24,335 --> 00:52:26,395
It's your birthday today.
What are your plans??

614
00:52:26,395 --> 00:52:28,425
I hope you're not just going to work.

615
00:52:28,425 --> 00:52:30,505
I'm not that hopeless.

616
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,685
Alright then.

617
00:52:33,685 --> 00:52:35,215
Seoyeong!

618
00:52:36,575 --> 00:52:38,285
Happy Birthday.

619
00:52:40,055 --> 00:52:43,215
You too, Sangu. Happy Birthday.

620
00:52:44,725 --> 00:52:47,755
Seoyeong, is it your birthday?

621
00:52:48,735 --> 00:52:50,355
I guess so.

622
00:52:51,105 --> 00:52:52,735
You guess so?

623
00:52:54,175 --> 00:52:55,435
Lee Seoyeong.

624
00:52:55,435 --> 00:52:58,995
Birthdays are so important.
How can you speak that way?

625
00:52:58,995 --> 00:53:03,565
The chance of an egg and sperm fertilizing is 300 million to 1.

626
00:53:03,565 --> 00:53:05,925
Was he always like that.

627
00:53:05,925 --> 00:53:08,455
Yes, he was.

628
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,495
I popped over to say bye before gong to Europe tomorrow.

629
00:53:12,495 --> 00:53:16,145
My first love's birthday stops me from leaving.

630
00:53:16,145 --> 00:53:17,815
What are you going to do for your birthday?

631
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,735
I'm going to hang out with Yeonhui.

632
00:53:20,735 --> 00:53:23,625
Yeonhui, are any potential clients booked to come here today?

633
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:24,905
None.

634
00:53:25,355 --> 00:53:27,775
Then get up, both of you.

635
00:53:27,775 --> 00:53:30,545
Pull down the shutters and follow me. Do it!

636
00:53:30,545 --> 00:53:31,585
What?

637
00:53:31,585 --> 00:53:33,465
What are you doing, Yeonhui?

638
00:53:35,085 --> 00:53:36,125
Yes, sir!

639
00:53:36,735 --> 00:53:40,345
- Get up.
- Come on.

640
00:53:40,345 --> 00:53:43,045
Let's go.

641
00:53:48,015 --> 00:53:49,705
Get changed in the fitting room.

642
00:53:50,205 --> 00:53:52,215
Why should I wear this?

643
00:53:52,795 --> 00:53:55,325
On a special day,

644
00:53:55,325 --> 00:53:58,445
you have to get dressed up to show yourself some respect.

645
00:53:58,445 --> 00:54:00,105
Exactly.

646
00:54:00,105 --> 00:54:01,815
Whose clothes are they?

647
00:54:01,815 --> 00:54:03,525
They're from my friend's new collection.

648
00:54:03,525 --> 00:54:05,575
You can keep it after you wear it.

649
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,435
Wow! Try it on.

650
00:54:07,435 --> 00:54:09,145
Hurry up.

651
00:54:10,055 --> 00:54:12,705
It's so pretty.

652
00:54:12,705 --> 00:54:14,075
I have to go out right now.

653
00:54:14,075 --> 00:54:16,195
Tell the finance team to bring the papers over quickly.

654
00:54:16,195 --> 00:54:17,165
Yes, sir.

655
00:54:41,665 --> 00:54:46,205
Lee Seoyeong

656
00:54:59,245 --> 00:55:02,015
Why isn't he here?

657
00:55:11,785 --> 00:55:13,725
Mom, we're here.

658
00:55:15,605 --> 00:55:17,775
Yes, hi.

659
00:55:17,775 --> 00:55:21,055
Welcome. It's cold outside, isn't it?

660
00:55:21,055 --> 00:55:22,705
Have you been well, mother?

661
00:55:22,705 --> 00:55:25,835
Sure. Thanks for asking.

662
00:55:25,835 --> 00:55:30,295
Father's going to be...

663
00:55:30,295 --> 00:55:32,805
I know. Sangu told me.

664
00:55:33,575 --> 00:55:34,805
Told you what?

665
00:55:34,805 --> 00:55:37,345
He said he can't come for dinner as he has something important to do.

666
00:55:37,345 --> 00:55:39,785
He came to see me at the hospital earlier today.

667
00:55:39,785 --> 00:55:41,125
What?

668
00:55:42,425 --> 00:55:45,905
They're your favorite dishes.

669
00:55:48,455 --> 00:55:51,825
Here. Have some of this.

670
00:55:51,825 --> 00:55:53,405
Thank you.

671
00:55:57,105 --> 00:55:59,325
Mother, why aren't you eating?

672
00:56:02,465 --> 00:56:05,425
Mom, is is because dad didn't come?

673
00:56:05,425 --> 00:56:07,885
It's okay. He met Sangu earlier.

674
00:56:10,095 --> 00:56:12,005
I know!

675
00:56:15,025 --> 00:56:17,865
He went to see his son in law.
What about me?

676
00:56:19,095 --> 00:56:21,315
How could he do this to me?

677
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:24,635
Mom, what's wrong?

678
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,815
Your dad left home.

679
00:56:43,435 --> 00:56:46,075
Dinner was enough.
I haven't been to a place like this before.

680
00:56:46,075 --> 00:56:48,215
That's why we came here.

681
00:56:48,215 --> 00:56:52,375
You have to try everything that other people do.

682
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:53,705
Exactly.

683
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:40,765
I'm sorry.

684
00:58:40,765 --> 00:58:42,665
Were you shocked?

685
00:58:43,535 --> 00:58:47,335
I have a special friend.

686
00:58:47,335 --> 00:58:51,525
It's her first time at a club.

687
00:58:51,525 --> 00:58:53,135
Really?

688
00:58:53,135 --> 00:58:54,865
Who is it?

689
00:58:57,545 --> 00:59:02,465
There's so much Seoyeong hasn't done.
It's her birthday today.

690
00:59:02,465 --> 00:59:04,255
So I dragged her here.

691
00:59:08,785 --> 00:59:10,575
Raise your glass.

692
00:59:12,935 --> 00:59:14,125
Go on.

693
00:59:19,745 --> 00:59:21,585
Lee Seoyeong...

694
00:59:22,515 --> 00:59:23,705
Happy Birthday.

695
00:59:27,055 --> 00:59:30,315
Happy Birthday!

696
01:00:28,935 --> 01:00:30,865
Thanks for today.

697
01:00:30,865 --> 01:00:32,445
I had a good time.

698
01:00:32,445 --> 01:00:35,255
I accompanied the ice princess into the human world.

699
01:00:41,155 --> 01:00:42,925
Have a good business trip.

700
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:45,115
Wait a minute.

701
01:00:45,115 --> 01:00:46,645
What is it?

702
01:00:46,645 --> 01:00:48,095
I want to give you a present for your birthday.

703
01:00:51,425 --> 01:00:52,855
A photo?

704
01:00:52,855 --> 01:00:54,455
Forget it.

705
01:00:54,455 --> 01:00:57,455
I don't take photos of just anyone, you know.

706
01:00:57,455 --> 01:00:59,615
Stand over there in front of the tree, okay?

707
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:01,935
It's nice here. Hurry up.

708
01:01:10,605 --> 01:01:12,875
Come on, Lee Seoyeong.

709
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:14,675
Smile more.

710
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:18,385
Make your arms natural.
You look like a log.

711
01:01:20,705 --> 01:01:22,005
Like this?

712
01:01:24,785 --> 01:01:26,695
Lean against the wall.

713
01:02:01,475 --> 01:02:25,825
