00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,538
<i>This film is freely based on
memories of Uschi Obermaier.</i>

2
00:01:32,996 --> 00:01:35,455
<i>In Paris that summer, the students wrote</i>

3
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:39,111
<i>"Power to the Imagination" on the walls.</i>

4
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:42,120
<i>In San Francisco,
they danced in the streets</i>

5
00:01:42,193 --> 00:01:44,400
<i>and fought for what had become
their way of life.</i>

6
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:51,001
<i>And I was at home in Sendling,
a suburb of Munich.</i>

7
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,780
<i>I felt I was dying,
slow and never-ending.</i>

8
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:59,145
<i>The only thing that kept
me alive was the music.</i>

9
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,285
<i>Without that, I would have died.</i>

10
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:04,524
<i>Or worse,
I would have turned into my parents.</i>

11
00:02:04,593 --> 00:02:07,893
<i>But music alone
wouldn't get me out of Sendling.</i>

12
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:11,477
<i>That much was clear to me.
What I needed was a man.</i>

13
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:13,722
<i>The wilder, the better.</i>

14
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,817
My God, Uschi...

15
00:02:36,832 --> 00:02:38,973
Hey, I stole a record from Steffen.

16
00:02:40,902 --> 00:02:42,464
From London.

17
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:15,503
Have you girls lost your minds?
It's too loud!

18
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:24,355
Uschi, turn off that awful music!

19
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:26,115
Quiet in there!

20
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,863
Hey!
I work for a big magazine, "Twen."

21
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,664
Can I take some pictures of you?

22
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:22,351
Sure.

23
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:11,069
What's the matter?

24
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:15,878
What are these photographs?

25
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,465
How could you?

26
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:22,596
Why? They're cool.
I'm going to be a photo model.

27
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:24,745
What?

28
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:26,966
A photo model?

29
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:30,643
Are you crazy? That's not a job!

30
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,655
And then what?

31
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:40,256
What do you mean?
I'll be a model. Then I'll be famous.

32
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:46,481
You want to be famous?
Nonsense.

33
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:50,611
You think you're better
than everybody else? Well, you're not.

34
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:54,515
What's going on?
What has she done now?

35
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,463
Look at her. She looks like a slut.

36
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:58,817
Shut up!

37
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,693
She's your daughter.

38
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:09,387
Uschi, I want you to become respectable.
Do you understand?

39
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,776
want you to be a lady.
All this is good for nothing!

40
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,270
Carry on like this
and you'll be a nothing!

41
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:24,129
Now take off those clothes!

42
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:27,053
Are you crazy or what?

43
00:06:27,117 --> 00:06:32,340
Does this look like a brothel?
Now clean this pigsty!

44
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,744
What will the neighbors think
when they see what I've raised?

45
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:42,139
Now clean up your damn junk!

46
00:06:47,947 --> 00:06:50,766
Uschi...
What are you doing?

47
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:55,988
What are doing?
Where are you going, Uschi?

48
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:25,256
In California
they walk around nude.

49
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:28,075
Here they get upset
if you even smile. Look!

50
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:32,399
Typical.

51
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,113
Sabine, look.

52
00:08:02,624 --> 00:08:03,738
Where are you going?

53
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,956
We don't care.

54
00:08:09,578 --> 00:08:12,516
- Hello.
- Hello.

55
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,669
Where are you headed?

56
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:50,749
Commune 1, Berlin.

57
00:08:56,206 --> 00:08:58,763
Are you musicians?

58
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,942
Everyone's a musician.

59
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:02,029
Really?

60
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:07,928
There's a musician inside all of us.

61
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:12,315
It's not about being able
to play scales correctly.

62
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:19,471
You see, everyone makes music.

63
00:09:21,202 --> 00:09:23,146
Everyone is music.

64
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,515
Do you play music?

65
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,870
We're musicians.

66
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,046
We can't play scales,
we just live in the moment.

67
00:09:39,115 --> 00:09:43,595
Yeah? We play music, too,
but we can play scales.

68
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,534
We've even made a recording.
We're "The Third Ear."

69
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:49,301
Here, try it.

70
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:58,597
- Hurry up, we're in the East!
- Hold on!

71
00:09:58,664 --> 00:09:59,942
Ever tried this before?

72
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:03,369
Hair tonic?

73
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:06,957
You wait for the perfume
to evaporate and chug it.

74
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:09,934
- And that works?
- It'll blow your mind!

75
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,292
Hurry up! Don't talk.

76
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:22,468
- Damn, the police! Let's go!
- Let's get out of here!

77
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,508
Get rid of the hair tonic!

78
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:28,488
- You drive!
- Hurry up!

79
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:31,023
Get in!

80
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,125
Wake up.

81
00:10:42,535 --> 00:10:44,960
- Don't forget your guitar.
- I'll get it later.

82
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:48,073
We'll leave the instruments in the van.

83
00:10:48,143 --> 00:10:49,738
How do I look?

84
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,793
Good.

85
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:55,831
<i>This is a stupid idea, Rainer, really.
This is nudism.</i>

86
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:57,493
<i>Stop complaining.</i>

87
00:10:57,565 --> 00:10:59,422
<i>Nothing but nudism.</i>

88
00:10:59,488 --> 00:11:04,001
<i>To be subversive,
you have to come up with something else.</i>

89
00:11:04,071 --> 00:11:07,490
<i>Commune 1
polarized public opinion in Germany.</i>

90
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:09,355
<i>There'd never been anything like it.</i>

91
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:10,951
Come in.

92
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:15,023
<i>It was founded with the
intention of abolishing security,</i>

93
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:18,449
<i>property and the concept of privacy.</i>

94
00:11:18,523 --> 00:11:21,178
<i>The communards rejected the work ethic</i>

95
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,160
<i>and preached fun and free love.</i>

96
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:24,829
<i>Here you could do as you pleased,</i>

97
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,839
<i>as long as it was done collectively.</i>

98
00:11:27,914 --> 00:11:30,120
This isn't about being subversive.

99
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:36,138
- Why so critical, Günther?
- I'm not critical, I'm decisive.

100
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:40,528
Mr. Langhans, you turned the courtroom
into a real circus.

101
00:11:40,604 --> 00:11:43,477
Why such contempt for German justice?

102
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,441
No walls, no doors...
I could never live here. You?

103
00:11:50,505 --> 00:11:51,456
I could.

104
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:57,071
The German system of justice
is the justice of the Third Reich,

105
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:01,007
and this trial has revealed that
in a big way.

106
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,573
What's your stance on the use of napalm
against the Viet Cong?

107
00:12:03,644 --> 00:12:05,917
- What's yours?
- I have my opinion, and you?

108
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:08,376
Then why don't you
write it down and print it?

109
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:14,406
Mr. Langhans... do you plan to overthrow
West Germany?

110
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:16,814
We support a cultural revolution,

111
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,951
but we oppose all forms
of aggressive resistance.

112
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,774
We'll play our song
until the system sings along.

113
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,365
And dances along. Write that down.

114
00:12:27,135 --> 00:12:30,653
We're fighting for the
eroticization of life, aren't we?

115
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:34,658
Does everyone sleep with
everyone around here?

116
00:12:39,344 --> 00:12:43,059
We are standing on
the brink of a new age.

117
00:12:43,126 --> 00:12:46,163
The old will be replaced by the new.

118
00:12:46,234 --> 00:12:50,102
You've got to be blind not to see it.
Without a doubt.

119
00:12:50,176 --> 00:12:52,635
And... what will this new age look like?

120
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:56,226
I'm not exactly sure,
but clearly it has long hair.

121
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:58,154
He means me.

122
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:10,172
Welcome. I'm Rainer.

123
00:13:10,237 --> 00:13:11,667
Uschi.

124
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,963
I'm Sabine. Hi.

125
00:13:17,031 --> 00:13:20,713
Nice of you to make it.
I saw you on the cover of "Twen."

126
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:33,373
<i>What's it like being a musician?
It's such a responsibility.</i>

127
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:37,241
<i>Every string you pluck,
every chord you play...</i>

128
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,834
<i>You travel through a tiny universe,
a microcosm...</i>

129
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:44,806
<i>of a soundscape, with highs, lows...</i>

130
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,376
Tape's running.

131
00:14:32,628 --> 00:14:34,091
Nice rattles.

132
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:40,413
Nice hair.

133
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:48,996
I wish I were a musician.

134
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:53,902
Everyone's a musician.

135
00:15:18,775 --> 00:15:20,435
Are you sure?

136
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:23,862
Yes.

137
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:27,387
What should I tell them at work?

138
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:04,463
Yes, breathe... breathe...

139
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:13,277
Slower...

140
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:16,517
No, more like this, please.

141
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:20,906
And now with more feeling, okay?

142
00:16:20,977 --> 00:16:23,403
Yes.

143
00:16:23,476 --> 00:16:27,639
That feels good. That's intense, yes.

144
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:54,874
Now slower. Slow. Slower.
Yes, circular movements.

145
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,170
Is she your girlfriend?

146
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,791
I don't own her.

147
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:18,301
Well, were you ever a couple?

148
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:24,194
For us there are no couples anymore,
only human beings.

149
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:26,213
What do you think about that?

150
00:17:26,288 --> 00:17:28,712
Me? About couples?

151
00:17:28,787 --> 00:17:31,157
I wouldn't mind having a boyfriend.

152
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:34,232
And you?

153
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:42,587
I think that we have to
change ourselves first...

154
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:45,601
before society can change.

155
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:49,772
If we don't change our own lives,
society won't change either.

156
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:54,990
Well, I have no idea about politics.

157
00:17:55,064 --> 00:17:58,616
Uschi, we... us... free love, right?

158
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:03,100
I always felt something like that.

159
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:08,035
She felt something!
How revolutionary!

160
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:14,961
Aren't there any rooms here
where we can be alone?

161
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:19,450
That's how it all starts!

162
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:24,258
How will anything reach the outside
if we always keep the doors shut?

163
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:52,453
Are you afraid to
go without make-up?

164
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:54,217
Why are you such a square?

165
00:18:54,286 --> 00:18:57,904
As a woman, you should help overthrow
the patriarchal system.

166
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:01,107
You're just jealous,
you old wallflower.

167
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:08,248
Just because Rainer digs you,
you think you're hot shit.

168
00:19:08,322 --> 00:19:11,426
But that model crap
doesn't count here. Not at all.

169
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:14,987
Why are you here anyway?

170
00:19:15,052 --> 00:19:16,680
For the experience.

171
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:19,373
I want to take part
in a peaceful renewal.

172
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,151
How did this
imperialist whore's piss get here?

173
00:19:43,222 --> 00:19:46,488
What, you don't like Coke?

174
00:19:46,554 --> 00:19:49,855
I should've known!
The model! No, I don't like Coke.

175
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,459
We have to help her understand
the mechanisms of exploitation.

176
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,467
Coca Cola is a
multinational company.

177
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:01,064
You're turning into
a capitalist stooge.

178
00:20:01,136 --> 00:20:05,517
You know what? I say we exclude Uschi
from our discussions.

179
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,628
Her lying around is distracting us all.

180
00:20:08,698 --> 00:20:11,866
As decoration,
at least she could sit upright.

181
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:16,611
Uschi belongs to our commune
like everyone else.

182
00:20:16,678 --> 00:20:21,419
Exactly. Besides, yesterday I put
3 marks into the cash box.

183
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:24,489
We thank our patroness
with the political mind of an amoeba.

184
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:27,468
Don't let them get to you.

185
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:32,469
Any idea who the publisher
of this magazine is? Axel Springer!

186
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,447
Yeah, "Give Springer a real stinger."

187
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:44,741
I say we launch a real operation.

188
00:20:44,814 --> 00:20:47,152
We should plant rhetorical bombs,

189
00:20:47,218 --> 00:20:49,742
instead of sitting around talking.

190
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:54,066
I think that can be done.

191
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,735
What do you mean?

192
00:20:55,806 --> 00:20:58,990
If you're serious about bombs,
I have connections.

193
00:20:59,065 --> 00:21:03,861
<i>The long-haired ones,
whose appearance is a provocation...</i>

194
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:07,570
What were you thinking,
bringing that spring chick in here?

195
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,941
Günther, it's spring chicken. Chicken.

196
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:13,245
A little more precision, please.

197
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:31,601
Conrad, I think that deep down,
you are actually a little girl

198
00:21:31,676 --> 00:21:34,997
who wants to be put to bed by Mommy.
With a doll.

199
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:36,766
But you don't have that here.

200
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:41,218
So you have to accept
that if it's dark, it's dark.

201
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,294
It's quite clear.
Try it out and you'll see.

202
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:47,022
Everyone's part of
the communal collective...

203
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:56,599
Damn it! It's not your fault.

204
00:21:56,673 --> 00:21:59,360
Look at Günther. What do you notice?

205
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:02,531
Günther is anti-orgasmic.
That's his problem.

206
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,600
Okay, so this is the bomb.
And this is the timer.

207
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:13,039
It creates an electrical circuit,
and sets a detonator.

208
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:15,505
Then you have one hour to get away.

209
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:19,000
This is fucked up!
I only meant a metaphorical bomb!

210
00:22:37,596 --> 00:22:42,458
Kajol! You're back!
Nice to see you again.
How was Hamburg?

211
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:43,262
Good.

212
00:22:46,312 --> 00:22:50,115
No way. I don't believe it...

213
00:22:57,047 --> 00:22:58,423
Hello.

214
00:22:58,489 --> 00:22:59,538
Hello.

215
00:23:27,684 --> 00:23:30,853
Stop it. There's no point.

216
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:34,570
Leave me alone.

217
00:23:34,638 --> 00:23:36,615
You've seen all there is to see.

218
00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:48,151
Uschi! Don't shed your tears
for your lover!

219
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:53,022
Uschi! Out there you will find another...

220
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:56,747
Rainer!
Your woman is trying to overcome

221
00:23:56,813 --> 00:23:59,666
her petty bourgeois conditioning.

222
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:02,582
I'd say she's failing miserably.

223
00:24:09,184 --> 00:24:10,779
Uschi, what is it?

224
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,340
Stop it! You're hurting me!

225
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:21,647
That's a conditioned reaction,
not real feelings.

226
00:24:21,714 --> 00:24:23,921
Look at it as a task I'm giving you,

227
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:28,284
for you to improve yourself.

228
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:30,685
Is that the extent of what you feel?

229
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:43,762
Come on. Don't mind her. Carry on.

230
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:57,178
<i>Open the door! This is the police!</i>

231
00:24:57,253 --> 00:25:00,674
- Let's go, men!
- The cops!

232
00:25:00,746 --> 00:25:02,757
Police! Don't move!

233
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,998
Do not resist
or we will use our guns!

234
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:08,491
Get up! Get dressed!

235
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:09,876
Everyone!

236
00:25:09,944 --> 00:25:11,507
I'm not resisting.

237
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:13,916
Rise and shine!

238
00:25:13,982 --> 00:25:16,570
- Let go of me.
- I'm not resisting.

239
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:19,067
If we all stay calm,
nothing will happen.

240
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:21,730
I'm not resisting.

241
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:28,751
Hold on, I'll get a bladder infection
if I don't get dressed.

242
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:44,740
- Let's go!
- Come on! Move it!

243
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,963
Stop!

244
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:52,755
Justice?! This is justice?!

245
00:25:52,822 --> 00:25:56,088
You preach peaceful protest!
Why do you build bombs?

246
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:59,356
That was just a game.

247
00:25:59,423 --> 00:26:01,915
Rainer, you see that?

248
00:26:01,987 --> 00:26:03,932
Move it out!

249
00:26:06,378 --> 00:26:08,650
POLICE DISCOVER BOMB
IN COMMUNE 1

250
00:26:08,716 --> 00:26:11,371
ENOUGH TO DESTROY
A WHOLE BUILDING

251
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:13,714
WAS THE COMMUNE PLANNING
A BOMBING?

252
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,501
COMMUNARDS REMAIN IN CUSTODY

253
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:20,283
MODEL USCHI OBERMAIER RELEASED

254
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:24,731
<i>Ho! Ho! Ho Chi Minh!
Ho! Ho! Ho Chi Minh!</i>

255
00:26:28,298 --> 00:26:30,789
<i>A thousand-year stench
lingers on the judges' bench!</i>

256
00:26:35,668 --> 00:26:37,393
Cut your hair!

257
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:41,013
Get a job! Go home, rich kids!

258
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:45,018
Look beyond the tips of your noses!

259
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:47,100
Go on over to the East, then!

260
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:50,243
<i>A thousand-year stench
lingers on the judges' bench...</i>

261
00:26:55,345 --> 00:26:58,447
THE FEDS PLANTED THE BOMB!

262
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:01,783
COMMUNARDS DENY ALI L
KNOWLEDGE OF BOMB

263
00:27:33,672 --> 00:27:35,081
Mr. Langhans!

264
00:27:35,145 --> 00:27:39,691
Police line...
March! March!

265
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,224
What now?

266
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:43,189
This is only the beginning!

267
00:27:43,253 --> 00:27:45,296
The state now knows...

268
00:27:45,368 --> 00:27:48,602
They're afraid,
and they're showing it,

269
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:51,740
through these actions... naturally...

270
00:28:17,543 --> 00:28:19,585
Keep moving!

271
00:28:25,939 --> 00:28:28,432
Nazis! Nazis! Nazis!

272
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,698
Piss off!

273
00:28:57,954 --> 00:28:59,614
The press conference has begun.

274
00:28:59,684 --> 00:29:01,345
Hand me the "Stern."

275
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:09,898
Let me see that...
Ah! I should've known.

276
00:29:09,971 --> 00:29:12,112
Even on the "Spiegel" cover.
You see, Rainer?

277
00:29:14,906 --> 00:29:16,403
Our Under-Maier!

278
00:29:17,662 --> 00:29:21,442
Bullshit. Look at this!

279
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,477
It's all Uschi. Typical!

280
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:28,233
The sex-crazed press!
Our agenda goes to the dogs.

281
00:29:28,301 --> 00:29:32,781
No, to the chicks.
'Verbal precision.'Right, Rainer?

282
00:29:32,852 --> 00:29:35,988
On the contrary!
We have to use this.

283
00:29:36,056 --> 00:29:38,482
Yeah, right, let's do more of the same.

284
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:43,352
They won't be able to ignore us...
'Sex sells.'

285
00:29:43,427 --> 00:29:47,525
That's bullshit, Rainer!
'Sex sells! 'What a load of crap!

286
00:29:47,593 --> 00:29:51,341
Everywhere you look is
Under-Maier, but no content!

287
00:29:53,906 --> 00:29:56,365
Hey, the Stones wrote us back!

288
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:02,521
Did they really invite us to London?

289
00:31:11,715 --> 00:31:13,178
What is this all about?

290
00:31:13,254 --> 00:31:15,045
Want to go back?

291
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,051
I'll be right out.

292
00:33:54,124 --> 00:33:59,631
And? How was it? What's Mick like?

293
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:01,262
Must we discuss this now?

294
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:02,994
This won't get us anywhere.

295
00:34:03,064 --> 00:34:06,844
I don't want to get anywhere.
I just want to have fun.

296
00:34:06,909 --> 00:34:10,844
But all your screwing
merely satisfies your animal instincts.

297
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:14,466
I love my animal instincts.

298
00:34:14,537 --> 00:34:17,738
Psychologically speaking,
your relationship to men

299
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:21,323
is a case of ideal sublimation
of childhood rejection

300
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:23,820
by an unreliable and egotistical father.

301
00:34:23,894 --> 00:34:28,090
If you keep this up...
Sex is death. Clearly, it is.

302
00:34:28,156 --> 00:34:32,800
Are you crazy? You don't even know
what it means to let yourself go

303
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:37,150
and to be aware of your partner
and enjoy them... like rock music.

304
00:34:37,226 --> 00:34:41,454
Look at yourself!
What do you see? What's Uschi?

305
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,967
Nothing but a lust machine.
Press here beep, lust. That's it.

306
00:34:46,038 --> 00:34:47,929
- Know what your problem is?
- What?

307
00:34:47,993 --> 00:34:50,517
You're scared of fucking.

308
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,501
Now that's ugly. What a stupid argument.

309
00:34:52,576 --> 00:34:56,893
Listen, Uschi! True freedom
can only come from abstention.

310
00:34:57,736 --> 00:34:59,811
Fine, then I'll abstain from you.

311
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:05,001
Come on, Uschi. Let's talk.

312
00:35:05,074 --> 00:35:07,052
Let go! I don't want to talk to you!

313
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:09,517
Then come on, hit me.
Come on, Uschi.

314
00:35:09,592 --> 00:35:11,253
You really make me sick.

315
00:35:14,207 --> 00:35:17,081
<i>What you just said is nonsense, Rainer.</i>

316
00:35:17,155 --> 00:35:19,526
Conrad just hasn't found himself yet.

317
00:35:19,591 --> 00:35:22,213
The problem is simply that
he never cleans the toilet,

318
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:24,621
and I hate that. Otherwise he's all right.

319
00:35:24,686 --> 00:35:28,467
I don't believe it,
it's the Under-Maier!

320
00:35:28,532 --> 00:35:30,991
I thought we'd gotten rid of you!

321
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:32,472
Hello.

322
00:35:38,562 --> 00:35:40,125
Where've you been for so long?

323
00:35:40,197 --> 00:35:44,743
I'm just picking up my things.
This isn't for me.

324
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:47,270
All this talk,
these endless discussions.

325
00:35:49,203 --> 00:35:50,731
Who gave you the necklace?

326
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:54,932
That chain?

327
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,715
It's from Keith.

328
00:36:03,558 --> 00:36:06,498
Uschi, let's go somewhere else.
You and me.

329
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,641
Rainer, it's pointless.
Don't you get it?

330
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:12,715
How nice! Mommy and Daddy
want to start a family!

331
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:16,084
I thought this was
a serious experiment,

332
00:36:16,153 --> 00:36:18,546
not a matchmaking institute.

333
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,974
I've realized that there are many ways
to reach one's goal.

334
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:26,048
You all have a lot to learn.
You all have a long way to go.

335
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:28,195
That much is clear.

336
00:36:45,827 --> 00:36:50,755
You've capitulated, Rainer.
You've simply capitulated.

337
00:36:50,827 --> 00:36:55,056
Flown the white flag, Rainer.
That photo model, there...

338
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:59,471
Don't give me that look!
You've fucked him stupid!

339
00:36:59,543 --> 00:37:02,230
We could've achieved something,
Rainer Langhans!

340
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,474
But you betrayed the revolution!

341
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,433
For that woman
I would've betrayed any revolution.

342
00:37:10,503 --> 00:37:12,361
Each and every one.

343
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:22,739
You! Go to hell, Rainer Langhans!

344
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:25,049
Intellectuals shouldn't fight!

345
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:28,601
Stop it! Stop it, damn it!

346
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:35,302
Rainer Langhans!

347
00:37:44,728 --> 00:37:47,001
OBERMAIER LEAVES
BERLIN'S COMMUNE 1

348
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:49,657
RADICAL MODEL
MOVES BACK TO MUNICH

349
00:37:49,729 --> 00:37:52,252
THIS IS HOW
THE COMMUNARDS LIVED!

350
00:38:05,847 --> 00:38:07,923
Okay, move, move...

351
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,973
Yes, look at that tummy.

352
00:38:10,045 --> 00:38:11,706
Uschi, yes!

353
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:29,817
Check the exposure.

354
00:38:31,773 --> 00:38:32,953
Eight.

355
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:38,656
Could you perhaps...
turn toward me a bit?

356
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,625
No, a little more shy, perhaps.

357
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:46,351
Like this?

358
00:38:50,263 --> 00:38:56,503
Pretend that you're really
embarrassed by something...

359
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:18,840
Finished?

360
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:29,389
Who is that?

361
00:39:29,456 --> 00:39:33,456
Bockhorn and Lurchi.
They're touring across Africa.

362
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:37,722
Two real freaks.
I just develop their film.

363
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:39,384
What are they doing there?

364
00:39:39,454 --> 00:39:43,651
I don't know.
Traveling, exploring, going on adventures.

365
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:48,197
Bockhorn views his life as
nothing but an endless trip.

366
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:51,403
He's the King of St. Pauli.
He runs the hippest bar

367
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:55,220
and stages happenings.
He does what he wants.

368
00:39:56,824 --> 00:39:58,932
Should I send him a photo of you?

369
00:39:59,004 --> 00:40:03,549
No, thanks.
But you can send him by in person.

370
00:40:10,732 --> 00:40:15,660
Oh, Lurchi! Look!
Look how cute!

371
00:41:02,582 --> 00:41:04,495
What do you think of her?

372
00:41:17,773 --> 00:41:19,269
Who's that?

373
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:21,998
Obermaier from Munich.
Uschi Obermaier.

374
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,525
Not bad, eh?

375
00:41:34,982 --> 00:41:37,506
MUNICH 1973

376
00:41:52,415 --> 00:41:54,076
Mick who?

377
00:41:53,746 --> 00:41:56,204
Jagger.

378
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:57,970
He's coming here?

379
00:42:30,055 --> 00:42:33,573
Keith is coming over, too.

380
00:42:33,644 --> 00:42:36,135
Oh, my God!

381
00:42:36,207 --> 00:42:36,939
Uschi!

382
00:42:37,008 --> 00:42:39,532
You always borrow my things!

383
00:42:39,604 --> 00:42:41,395
They're right here.

384
00:42:41,463 --> 00:42:43,800
- Where's my top?
- Here it is.

385
00:42:43,866 --> 00:42:46,620
- My hair!
- What?

386
00:42:55,756 --> 00:42:57,252
I look like hell!

387
00:44:22,024 --> 00:44:26,154
Uschi? Uschi? Hey, listen!
My name's Bockhorn.

388
00:44:26,223 --> 00:44:28,714
I'm on my way back to Hamburg!

389
00:44:28,785 --> 00:44:33,102
<i>I'm in Africa now! Can you hear me?
The connection's really bad!</i>

390
00:44:33,175 --> 00:44:36,279
<i>I'm throwing a midsummer's night party,
in your honor!</i>

391
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:40,031
<i>I've sent you plane tickets,
they should be arriving by mail.</i>

392
00:44:40,099 --> 00:44:44,578
<i>Hello? Uschi?</i>

393
00:45:08,427 --> 00:45:09,771
How'd it go?

394
00:45:09,837 --> 00:45:13,640
It worked. I got her on the phone.

395
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:29,256
How are you?

396
00:45:34,385 --> 00:45:34,920
Hello.

397
00:45:42,077 --> 00:45:43,322
Hi!

398
00:45:55,984 --> 00:46:03,764
The watch is a metaphor
for a life running out of time.

399
00:46:27,357 --> 00:46:28,537
Lurchi!

400
00:46:31,491 --> 00:46:33,404
Hold Cheetah, will you?

401
00:46:35,977 --> 00:46:40,971
Okay, people! The party's over.

402
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:46,416
Yes, ciao, ciao!
We'll have another one tomorrow,

403
00:46:46,489 --> 00:46:50,204
but for today, it's over.
Come on! Out!

404
00:46:52,899 --> 00:46:55,073
See you tomorrow, dear.

405
00:46:55,141 --> 00:46:57,381
Yeah, see you then. That's it, Angel.

406
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:00,869
Ciao, ciao.

407
00:47:11,486 --> 00:47:13,048
I'm Bockhorn.

408
00:47:15,588 --> 00:47:21,510
So you're Bockhorn. I sure am curious.

409
00:47:23,214 --> 00:47:24,329
So am I.

410
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:29,686
You've been to all those places?

411
00:47:29,752 --> 00:47:32,244
Yeah, all of them.

412
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:35,349
And where will you go with me?

413
00:47:37,443 --> 00:47:40,164
To the end of the world, if you want.

414
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:43,658
You don't even know me.

415
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:47,885
I know our destiny.

416
00:48:13,174 --> 00:48:15,544
Will you shuffle?

417
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:17,369
You do it.

418
00:48:31,665 --> 00:48:34,669
That's you.

419
00:48:34,741 --> 00:48:37,680
I knew it. You're a witch.

420
00:48:38,652 --> 00:48:40,410
That's me.

421
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,668
And this is us together.

422
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:49,667
And this is our future.

423
00:48:51,886 --> 00:48:52,967
Travels...

424
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:56,398
riches...

425
00:48:58,776 --> 00:49:00,305
children...

426
00:49:00,379 --> 00:49:02,237
You can forget about that.

427
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:06,465
Now the last, most important card.

428
00:49:09,993 --> 00:49:11,751
So what does that mean?

429
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:13,065
You know.

430
00:49:16,786 --> 00:49:19,124
'Til death do us part.

431
00:49:26,399 --> 00:49:28,607
You're kinda spooking me.

432
00:50:12,868 --> 00:50:16,648
Kalle! A little more respect for Charlie!
Come on!

433
00:50:26,936 --> 00:50:28,367
That way.

434
00:50:31,711 --> 00:50:34,268
Make room for the King of St. Pauli.

435
00:50:34,339 --> 00:50:36,251
And the new Queen.

436
00:50:44,433 --> 00:50:47,285
Uschi, darling, have a seat.

437
00:50:50,682 --> 00:50:53,469
Lurchi, let's get this started.

438
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:56,762
By the way, Uschi...

439
00:50:56,835 --> 00:51:03,621
That gentleman there, the slugger,
he's our heavyweight boxer.

440
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:07,851
You're the hottest piece of ass
I've ever met.

441
00:51:09,846 --> 00:51:15,834
I say that with all due respect
and humility in the face of beauty.

442
00:51:15,903 --> 00:51:19,453
Really, Uschi, you're simply
the hottest broad in all of Germany,

443
00:51:19,524 --> 00:51:22,016
if I may say so.

444
00:51:22,088 --> 00:51:26,916
Respect, Bockhorn, a real...
Get your hands off me!

445
00:51:27,825 --> 00:51:32,533
Hey, pimp! Leave the slugger alone,
he still has to fight!

446
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:38,246
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie...
Let's drink to Charlie!

447
00:51:38,313 --> 00:51:41,001
To Charlie!

448
00:51:57,189 --> 00:52:00,357
Listen, Angel,
you have a hot body and a sweet ass,

449
00:52:00,425 --> 00:52:02,338
but I'm no pimp.

450
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:03,940
- Come on!
- I'm an artist.

451
00:52:04,015 --> 00:52:08,877
What do you want with that bimbo?
She won't earn you one cent!

452
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:14,074
I'll let the whole gang screw me,
and you can watch.

453
00:52:14,141 --> 00:52:17,692
Stop that before I get horny.
And no one wants to see that.

454
00:52:17,762 --> 00:52:19,008
Yes, everyone does.

455
00:52:19,076 --> 00:52:21,730
No, Angel. Knock it off.

456
00:52:22,569 --> 00:52:27,727
Lurchi!
That old lady is going to make me happy.

457
00:52:27,793 --> 00:52:31,573
Yeah? You think so?

458
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:34,030
Angel! Come here!

459
00:52:34,106 --> 00:52:37,525
Don't call me Angel. I'm no Angel!

460
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,286
Fine, then come here, Witch!

461
00:52:40,355 --> 00:52:42,530
No, you come here.

462
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:47,916
Slap some sense into her!

463
00:52:58,109 --> 00:53:01,015
Alright, Lurchi. I'll take care of it.

464
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:03,394
He should put his old lady in her place!

465
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:09,927
Come on, you and I need to talk!

466
00:53:20,253 --> 00:53:23,072
Uschi, this just won't do!

467
00:53:23,137 --> 00:53:24,830
You're right about that.

468
00:53:27,656 --> 00:53:30,026
If they see that you're out of line,

469
00:53:30,092 --> 00:53:34,506
it won't help anybody at all!

470
00:53:34,577 --> 00:53:38,926
Should I do what you want
so they think you're the greatest?

471
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,245
Bockhorn...

472
00:53:40,314 --> 00:53:41,909
Forget it!

473
00:53:47,556 --> 00:53:50,276
Cheetah! Go!

474
00:53:50,344 --> 00:53:52,070
You stupid little ape!

475
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:56,110
Okay Obermaier,
time to change Cheetah's diapers.

476
00:53:56,176 --> 00:53:58,067
Change them yourself!

477
00:54:00,151 --> 00:54:03,123
Lazy bitch!

478
00:54:03,194 --> 00:54:05,368
A fine mess I'm in!

479
00:54:08,899 --> 00:54:11,292
Come here, Cheetah-baby!

480
00:54:14,539 --> 00:54:19,335
Yes, yes... it's alright, Cheetah.

481
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:21,715
If you don't start developing
some motherly instincts...

482
00:54:21,782 --> 00:54:23,245
I'm throwing you out.

483
00:54:23,321 --> 00:54:26,773
If you want motherly instincts,
run to your mommy in Stuttgart.

484
00:54:31,043 --> 00:54:35,009
He didn't, did he?
Look what your damned monkey did!

485
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:44,435
Hey, Cheetah!
I know, you were here first, right?

486
00:54:44,502 --> 00:54:47,441
That evil woman
wants to come between us!

487
00:54:49,726 --> 00:54:51,190
What are you doing?

488
00:54:51,264 --> 00:54:53,886
Going to the airport.

489
00:54:53,956 --> 00:54:55,365
Why?

490
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:58,216
My agent is waiting.

491
00:54:58,283 --> 00:55:00,042
What agent?

492
00:55:00,109 --> 00:55:04,109
My agent.
I forgot I've a meeting with Ponti.

493
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:06,400
I hear Ponti's drawn up the contract.

494
00:55:06,454 --> 00:55:10,421
- You'll work with Jack Nicholson. -Really?

495
00:55:10,492 --> 00:55:14,141
He's made them all famous.
Brigitte Bardot, Lollobrigida,

496
00:55:14,209 --> 00:55:16,067
Claudia Cardinale...

497
00:55:16,132 --> 00:55:16,667
- Hello?

498
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:18,337
<i>He saw your film, "The Red Sun."</i>

499
00:55:18,407 --> 00:55:20,352
Yes, I'll send them in.

500
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,831
Mr. Ponti will see you now.

501
00:55:37,323 --> 00:55:41,803
Finally! Beautiful! Miss Obermaier,
welcome to Rome.

502
00:55:41,874 --> 00:55:45,841
Mamma mia, you are beautiful!

503
00:55:45,911 --> 00:55:47,889
So beautiful.

504
00:55:52,801 --> 00:55:55,523
Did you get to see Rome?
You like it?

505
00:55:57,192 --> 00:56:02,798
Are they all like this in Germany?

506
00:56:02,865 --> 00:56:06,612
I saw your film, "The Red Sun."

507
00:56:06,678 --> 00:56:08,786
You're a natural actor.

508
00:56:20,938 --> 00:56:23,331
What? Ten years?

509
00:56:23,406 --> 00:56:26,377
I'm hosting dinner
with many important people tonight.

510
00:56:26,451 --> 00:56:27,696
Antonioni will be there.

511
00:56:32,315 --> 00:56:34,106
There's no way. Ten years, Alma, that's...

512
00:56:41,417 --> 00:56:44,138
Ten years... I don't know.

513
00:56:44,204 --> 00:56:47,558
Aren't you happy?
Let me see your laughter!

514
00:56:47,633 --> 00:56:51,086
Antonioni's next film.
We'll work together.

515
00:56:53,017 --> 00:56:54,546
See you tonight!

516
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,532
But Bockhorn and I wanted to...

517
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,794
What's going on?
You sure haven't made much progress.

518
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:18,843
What have you been doing all this time?

519
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:25,309
We took out the radiator.

520
00:57:25,384 --> 00:57:26,564
I can see that.

521
00:57:28,492 --> 00:57:30,087
What's your problem?

522
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:37,106
Uschi!

523
00:57:37,177 --> 00:57:39,035
Bockhorn's busy right now.

524
00:57:52,646 --> 00:57:56,242
Oh, Uschi! There you are. Look, Angel...

525
00:58:00,617 --> 00:58:03,994
Go have a smoke,
then come back and knock.

526
00:58:02,995 --> 00:58:08,594
what did you say?

527
00:58:08,595 --> 00:58:11,447
Get out! Now!

528
00:58:12,785 --> 00:58:14,709
Let her finish!

529
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:17,749
What's the monkey doing here?

530
00:58:18,024 --> 00:58:21,617
The monkey stays. He's watching.

531
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:26,444
This just isn't worth it.

532
00:58:26,446 --> 00:58:28,795
Get out!

533
00:58:28,861 --> 00:58:30,390
Angel, I'll call you.

534
00:58:34,013 --> 00:58:36,132
I mean,
you could've really learned something.

535
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:41,577
I simply don't understand you.
I build you a luxury bus...

536
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:42,944
- Luxury bus?!
- Yeah, luxury bus.

537
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,711
Show me the luxury here!

538
00:58:44,781 --> 00:58:46,441
All you do is complain.

539
00:58:46,311 --> 00:58:48,201
Any idea how much all this shit cost?

540
00:58:48,266 --> 00:58:51,085
I don't care how much it cost!

541
00:58:52,528 --> 00:58:55,598
Bockhorn, I'm not staying.
This just isn't my thing.

542
00:58:56,149 --> 00:58:58,967
All these whores, sluts and players!

543
00:58:59,033 --> 00:59:02,137
Do you think I want to rot here?

544
00:59:02,207 --> 00:59:07,070
You promised to show me the world.
And what do I get?

545
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,695
I'll be gone soon enough.

546
00:59:09,769 --> 00:59:11,627
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

547
00:59:11,692 --> 00:59:12,456
What's that mean?

548
00:59:12,526 --> 00:59:14,438
Keith is taking me on tour.

549
00:59:14,512 --> 00:59:15,625
If you do that...

550
00:59:15,698 --> 00:59:16,747
Then what?

551
00:59:19,352 --> 00:59:20,530
Is that all you can do?

552
00:59:23,965 --> 00:59:29,308
Listen, Lurchi, get her back!
Drag her back inside the café!

553
00:59:29,381 --> 00:59:32,735
Move your ass and get her back.
The monkey is gone!

554
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:33,705
Should I run after her?

555
00:59:33,772 --> 00:59:35,946
<i>Do something! Go out and get her!</i>

556
00:59:36,014 --> 00:59:36,965
Now?

557
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,176
Run out there and bring her inside!

558
00:59:40,245 --> 00:59:41,654
Think of something, dammit!

559
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,724
I'm going out to get her now, okay?

560
00:59:49,122 --> 00:59:52,739
Uschi! Uschi, wait!
Come with me, please!

561
00:59:52,807 --> 00:59:58,827
Bockhorn said I can't let you go!
He'll kill me. Wait! Please!

562
01:02:24,161 --> 01:02:25,244
No thanks, Dieter.

563
01:02:25,315 --> 01:02:29,282
For me, this is pure medicine.
It gives me positive energy.

564
01:02:29,354 --> 01:02:30,817
Dammit!

565
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:39,062
It's all Uschi's fault. She wears me out.

566
01:02:39,128 --> 01:02:43,028
I've no energy left. I did all I could.
I got rid of the monkey...

567
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:46,152
For six months
I tried to turn her around.

568
01:02:46,216 --> 01:02:51,112
I tied her to the bed,
I whipped her, raped her,

569
01:02:51,183 --> 01:02:54,352
dragged her throughout the apartment.
Nothing.

570
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,081
I don't know what to do.

571
01:02:56,151 --> 01:02:59,003
And I don't know what she wants.
No idea what she wants.

572
01:03:03,041 --> 01:03:08,483
She's a cannibal, an evil witch.
She'll eat you alive.

573
01:03:08,553 --> 01:03:14,443
But you know what, Rainer?
I love her. I love her!

574
01:03:14,513 --> 01:03:17,267
Man, I've never loved a woman
like I love her.

575
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:20,687
But Dieter,
what do you love about Uschi?

576
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:24,631
I mean, what does she have
that makes you say, let's go forward?

577
01:03:24,704 --> 01:03:25,917
I'm the one whose will...

578
01:03:25,985 --> 01:03:29,121
That's the real essence of it, isn't it?

579
01:03:29,191 --> 01:03:33,507
Everything. I love everything about her.

580
01:03:33,581 --> 01:03:35,209
Where is Uschi now?

581
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:41,013
With the Stones, I think. Dammit!

582
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:44,820
Come with me, Rainer.

583
01:03:46,944 --> 01:03:48,507
I want to show you something.

584
01:03:56,205 --> 01:03:57,735
Know what those are?

585
01:03:59,538 --> 01:04:01,483
Those are our scalps.

586
01:04:02,487 --> 01:04:04,662
Only shock therapy can help.

587
01:04:06,204 --> 01:04:08,379
How do you plan to shock her?

588
01:06:18,717 --> 01:06:21,175
You have the world's greatest man,

589
01:06:21,248 --> 01:06:26,558
you're a star yourself,
everyone envies you...

590
01:06:26,631 --> 01:06:29,832
So? What if I want something else?

591
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:32,719
I want to see the world, be free,
not do the same old things.

592
01:06:32,785 --> 01:06:37,297
Concert, limousine. Concert, limousine.
It's so boring!

593
01:06:42,751 --> 01:06:44,030
You know what?

594
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:47,742
I think I miss Bockhorn.

595
01:07:06,469 --> 01:07:09,441
<i>Bockhorn? No way!
We were just talking about you.</i>

596
01:07:09,515 --> 01:07:11,820
How'd you get my number?

597
01:07:11,885 --> 01:07:14,344
The bus is ready. I wanted to say bye.

598
01:07:14,418 --> 01:07:16,723
<i>What? But I wanted to come along!</i>

599
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:19,214
I'm leaving without you.
Go jump in a lake!

600
01:07:19,288 --> 01:07:22,971
But... hello? Hello!

601
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:28,931
What is it?

602
01:07:28,999 --> 01:07:30,408
He's leaving without me.

603
01:07:40,055 --> 01:07:43,408
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to the airport.

604
01:07:46,656 --> 01:07:49,027
Yea, yeah, I'm coming.

605
01:07:49,092 --> 01:07:51,233
Hey guys, what do you want?

606
01:07:51,303 --> 01:07:52,679
What? I don't have the money!

607
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:07,251
It's time you paid up!

608
01:08:17,485 --> 01:08:20,654
You can't just leave me alone with them!

609
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:21,835
I'm going with you.

610
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:24,690
Do you have everything?

611
01:08:28,828 --> 01:08:30,424
- My bag.
- I got it.

612
01:09:14,656 --> 01:09:16,568
Café Adler doesn't exist anymore.

613
01:09:16,641 --> 01:09:20,926
Every week another dead body
got carried out of there.

614
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,590
Bockhorn has huge debts.

615
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,479
They want the bus,
and everyone's looking for him.

616
01:09:26,545 --> 01:09:30,577
We're heading out tomorrow.
Bockhorn and I are leaving.

617
01:09:30,647 --> 01:09:33,553
He's taking me along. To India.

618
01:09:44,907 --> 01:09:47,245
Oh, it's you.
Where did you come from?

619
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:48,140
Is Bockhorn here?

620
01:09:49,746 --> 01:09:52,116
No, he's gone. He left already.

621
01:09:52,182 --> 01:09:52,946
What?

622
01:09:54,297 --> 01:09:55,760
Yeah, he's gone.

623
01:09:55,835 --> 01:09:57,397
He really left without me?

624
01:09:57,470 --> 01:10:01,152
Yeah. I'm sorry.

625
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:09,100
Hey, Lurch!
Lurchi, can you do me a favor?

626
01:10:09,165 --> 01:10:13,100
Whiskey's no good for polishing.
I need the Polylux...

627
01:10:22,145 --> 01:10:24,385
I must say I am happy to see you.

628
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:35,469
Wow...

629
01:10:44,801 --> 01:10:50,342
Amazing...
I never thought it'd be this beautiful.

630
01:10:54,511 --> 01:10:55,527
Voilà!

631
01:11:09,958 --> 01:11:11,553
Unbelievable!

632
01:11:13,803 --> 01:11:15,629
How beautiful!

633
01:11:18,194 --> 01:11:20,433
- Just for you, Witch.
- A radio!

634
01:11:21,847 --> 01:11:23,508
All for you.

635
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:38,343
Amazing. Really, you...
I don't know what to say.

636
01:11:38,415 --> 01:11:41,103
Now you see what your
good-for-nothing man can do.

637
01:11:49,215 --> 01:11:50,558
You're so beautiful.

638
01:11:57,194 --> 01:11:59,718
What's going on around here?

639
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:03,986
They're all just jealous, the fools.
They want my money.

640
01:12:04,052 --> 01:12:09,625
And the bus. But they won't get it.
They won't get us.

641
01:12:28,823 --> 01:12:30,452
Stay in touch!

642
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:44,328
USCHI OBERMAIER AND THE PRINCE

643
01:13:33,493 --> 01:13:34,640
What's that you're tearing up?

644
01:13:34,711 --> 01:13:36,918
My contract with Ponti.

645
01:13:56,407 --> 01:13:58,198
Not another road toll...

646
01:14:14,641 --> 01:14:16,651
Get rid of it, Uschi!

647
01:14:20,025 --> 01:14:23,773
Obermaier! Obermaier,
throw the dope away!

648
01:14:23,838 --> 01:14:28,220
No way. It would be truly barbaric
to get rid of it.

649
01:14:28,292 --> 01:14:33,056
Lot of good it'll do you
when you're rotting in jail.

650
01:14:33,132 --> 01:14:35,819
And I know that this is
the worst border in the world.

651
01:14:37,298 --> 01:14:38,544
Then we'll just put it in here.

652
01:15:11,236 --> 01:15:17,540
Yeah, chill out.
Yeah, no worries. Just keep cool.

653
01:15:26,265 --> 01:15:28,919
Hey, get your grimy fingers off of me!

654
01:15:29,726 --> 01:15:32,315
I said,
get your grimy fingers off of me, okay?

655
01:16:12,122 --> 01:16:14,647
Uschi, bring me the photo!

656
01:17:03,942 --> 01:17:06,816
You're the best old lady ever! The best!

657
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,235
Unbelievable!

658
01:18:35,339 --> 01:18:39,239
Bockhorn, this here is paradise.

659
01:18:45,688 --> 01:18:49,272
<i>Don't dream your life, live your dream.</i>

660
01:18:49,342 --> 01:18:52,663
USCHI OBERMAIER AND THE PRINCE
CONQUER THE WORLD

661
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:55,777
LIVING THE DREAM OF A GENERATION

662
01:18:57,130 --> 01:19:00,484
INDIA, 1975

663
01:19:04,854 --> 01:19:09,115
Uschi, come here, quick!
He wants to show us something!

664
01:19:13,121 --> 01:19:14,749
You won't believe this!

665
01:19:28,984 --> 01:19:30,841
That's the goddess Kali.

666
01:19:30,907 --> 01:19:34,173
She looks just like you,
except that I still have my head.

667
01:20:21,444 --> 01:20:24,296
Eh, Witch? King of St. Pauli!

668
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,947
I don't want to get married!

669
01:20:57,015 --> 01:20:58,873
Why not? What is it?

670
01:20:58,938 --> 01:21:00,697
What if they find out?

671
01:21:00,764 --> 01:21:02,907
Find out what?

672
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:05,915
That you're no Prince,
and I'm no Princess.

673
01:21:05,988 --> 01:21:11,594
But we are. Just look at us! We are!

674
01:21:27,203 --> 01:21:28,634
Brass band... the works!

675
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:36,973
It's only symbolic!
A performance. Come on.

676
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:32,945
You're completely stoned!

677
01:24:03,076 --> 01:24:06,627
<i>Bockhorn sweet-talked
the Maharani into giving us</i>

678
01:24:06,698 --> 01:24:10,499
<i>a full fairy-tale wedding.
But I realized that for him,</i>

679
01:24:10,576 --> 01:24:13,067
<i>it was more than just a performance.</i>

680
01:24:13,138 --> 01:24:15,281
<i>And though I loved Bockhorn
more than anything,</i>

681
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:18,136
<i>I never wanted to belong to
one man alone.</i>

682
01:25:18,449 --> 01:25:20,274
Look, it's Uschi!

683
01:25:27,038 --> 01:25:30,688
Hey, kids! I have more in the bus.
I'll get more if...

684
01:25:49,823 --> 01:25:56,641
I'm going to be a father! A father!

685
01:26:08,442 --> 01:26:09,391
Bockhorn?

686
01:26:14,435 --> 01:26:15,330
Bockhorn?

687
01:26:28,503 --> 01:26:29,135
Bockhorn?

688
01:26:30,554 --> 01:26:31,383
Bockhorn!

689
01:26:32,797 --> 01:26:33,976
Bockhorn!

690
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:38,208
Why did you lock me in?

691
01:26:38,789 --> 01:26:41,061
What is it? What happened?

692
01:26:41,129 --> 01:26:43,620
Because you're my wife,
and we're having a baby!

693
01:26:43,693 --> 01:26:45,354
That doesn't make me your prisoner!

694
01:26:45,423 --> 01:26:46,831
It was to protect you!

695
01:28:08,551 --> 01:28:09,481
Bockhorn?

696
01:28:11,628 --> 01:28:12,458
Bockhorn...

697
01:28:59,089 --> 01:29:02,290
It's alright. It's alright now.

698
01:29:10,529 --> 01:29:14,310
You can be proud of yourself.
You did that like a nomad.

699
01:29:17,836 --> 01:29:19,431
We'll make a new one, okay?

700
01:29:22,514 --> 01:29:24,306
We won't have another child.

701
01:29:27,322 --> 01:29:28,698
I'm not a mother.

702
01:29:34,724 --> 01:29:36,187
Sleep.

703
01:29:39,723 --> 01:29:41,220
Let's get out of here.

704
01:29:48,151 --> 01:29:49,331
Off we go.

705
01:29:55,747 --> 01:29:59,494
Hello? Can I ask you a few questions?

706
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:04,870
Miss Obermaier, would you answer
a few questions? Please!

707
01:30:26,607 --> 01:30:28,748
<i>We'd lost our child.</i>

708
01:30:28,818 --> 01:30:32,051
<i>I felt fear for the first time.</i>

709
01:30:32,119 --> 01:30:35,439
<i>Bockhorn always said to
look your fear in the eye</i>

710
01:30:35,516 --> 01:30:38,422
<i>and the fear will disappear.</i>

711
01:30:38,496 --> 01:30:40,539
<i>And so we drove on.</i>

712
01:30:40,611 --> 01:30:44,577
<i>To the end of the world.
Following the endless summer.</i>

713
01:31:44,146 --> 01:31:48,079
Lurchi, go see if there's enough firewood,
and if everyone has enough to drink.

714
01:32:22,218 --> 01:32:24,523
What a long trip it's been, eh, Witch?

715
01:32:25,934 --> 01:32:27,464
But it's not over yet.

716
01:32:27,537 --> 01:32:29,875
We'll do something new,
something different.

717
01:32:32,953 --> 01:32:35,608
Yeah, something new and different.

718
01:32:35,677 --> 01:32:38,266
Really different. No more strife.

719
01:32:40,997 --> 01:32:44,263
I always thought I had to be
stronger than you.

720
01:32:46,252 --> 01:32:47,781
But that's impossible.

721
01:32:49,392 --> 01:32:51,785
You're the strongest old lady ever.

722
01:32:55,705 --> 01:32:56,917
What's wrong with you?

723
01:32:59,007 --> 01:33:01,115
Nothing. It's all good.

724
01:33:01,185 --> 01:33:04,060
I'm going back down to the beach.
You coming?

725
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:47,540
Bockhorn, come here! Look who's here!

726
01:34:56,809 --> 01:34:58,918
Bockhorn, Keith. Keith, Bockhorn.

727
01:35:09,147 --> 01:35:11,092
He just happened to be here.

728
01:35:11,165 --> 01:35:14,104
Oh, yeah? You don't really believe that?

729
01:35:15,555 --> 01:35:19,238
You know what? You can have
whoever you want. You do anyway.

730
01:35:19,306 --> 01:35:21,643
Bockhorn, that's not what this is about.

731
01:37:04,128 --> 01:37:08,445
Lurchi, you old dumbass! Tommi, you stupid...

732
01:37:39,669 --> 01:37:40,979
Stop, you're hurting yourself!

733
01:38:38,088 --> 01:38:41,355
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

734
01:38:56,484 --> 01:38:58,079
Lurchi, give me the knife.

735
01:38:59,495 --> 01:39:01,888
You're going to slit its throat?

736
01:39:06,514 --> 01:39:09,387
No need for that.
You don't even know how.

737
01:39:41,124 --> 01:39:43,648
- You're not riding with me...
- Why not?

738
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:47,467
You ride with the others. Get off!

739
01:39:47,533 --> 01:39:50,800
I want to ride with you,
not with the others!

740
01:39:55,097 --> 01:39:57,271
Come on! Please!

741
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:08,614
Viva Zapata!

742
01:40:18,298 --> 01:40:20,571
Viva Zapata!

743
01:40:42,230 --> 01:40:43,605
Have you see Bockhorn?

744
01:40:44,538 --> 01:40:46,515
He left that way on the motorcycle.

745
01:42:02,121 --> 01:42:13,364
No! No! No! No! No!

746
01:42:16,894 --> 01:42:18,303
Leave me alone!

747
01:44:17,806 --> 01:44:19,531
<i>In the course of a single night,</i>

748
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:22,156
<i>I lost the two most important men
in my life.</i>

749
01:44:23,734 --> 01:44:27,318
<i>The freedom I'd always
dreamed about and lived,</i>

750
01:44:27,387 --> 01:44:29,212
<i>suddenly seemed like a curse.</i>

751
01:44:30,465 --> 01:44:32,802
<i>Suddenly it had turned into loneliness.</i>

752
01:44:34,822 --> 01:44:37,128
<i>I could feel that he still loved me.</i>

753
01:44:38,635 --> 01:44:43,563
<i>I thanked him for everything he gave me
during the life we shared.</i>

754
01:44:45,173 --> 01:44:49,588
<i>I told him that I could've
been a little nicer to him,</i>

755
01:44:49,659 --> 01:44:51,866
<i>instead of being an egotistical monster.</i>

756
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:56,930
<i>I regretted not telling him
more often how much I loved him.</i>

757
01:44:58,344 --> 01:45:01,316
<i>But now he was just lying there,
and it was too late.</i>

758
01:45:03,311 --> 01:45:06,480
<i>I asked myself
if I could've done anything differently.</i>

759
01:45:07,157 --> 01:45:09,299
<i>And my answer was...</i>

760
01:45:09,368 --> 01:45:10,580
<i>no.</i>

761
01:45:28,532 --> 01:45:31,350
Today, Uschi Obermaier
is a successful jewelry designer

762
01:45:31,416 --> 01:45:33,525
living in a small villa
in Topanga Canyon,

763
01:45:33,595 --> 01:45:36,916
between Santa Monica and Malibu.
