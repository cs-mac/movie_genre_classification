1
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:21,643
THE BUTTERFLY'S TONGUE

2
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:39,806
Andrés...

3
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:43,288
Andrés, wake up.

4
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:44,846
What do you want?

5
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:49,291
Did they hit you at school?

6
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:50,851
Of course they did.

7
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,427
Where?

8
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:56,898
To school.

9
00:03:57,936 --> 00:03:59,631
Besides, I can already read.

10
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:03,465
I’ll go to America,
like our uncle did

11
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:04,873
to get out of the war.

12
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:06,376
What are you saying?

13
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:08,609
I don't want to be hit.

14
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:10,546
By who?

15
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:13,015
By the teacher.
He looks mean.

16
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:14,917
Go to sleep.

17
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,050
You don't want
to fall asleep in school.

18
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:21,389
Then you really would get it.

19
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:38,605
Let me ride before
the teacher comes. - No.

20
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:44,082
Look, there he is.

21
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:46,851
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

22
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:48,853
Here he is.

23
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:52,054
So you know how to read?

24
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:55,390
His father taught him
while he was ill.

25
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,552
You said he was asthmatic.

26
00:04:56,628 --> 00:04:58,118
Yes, but he's better.

27
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:01,264
He's shy.

28
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,494
He needs it in case
he has an attack.

29
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:04,296
He can't breathe.

30
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:05,893
A kiss, son.

31
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:09,536
Be patient with him,
he's a sparrow,

32
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:12,475
out of the nest
for the first time.

33
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:13,841
Come on, son.

34
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:56,550
Good morning,

35
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:58,680
Good morning, Don Gregorio!

36
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:06,591
You, the new boy,

37
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:08,257
Stand up!

38
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:12,365
Your name?

39
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,538
Sparrow!
His name's Sparrow!

40
00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:18,570
Please!

41
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:22,908
Come over here.

42
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,987
Answer. Or do you want us all
to call you Sparrow?

43
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:44,292
He's wetting his pants!

44
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:53,738
Wait... Come back here!

45
00:07:33,818 --> 00:07:34,785
What's wrong, son?

46
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,698
Moncho, what are you
doing here?

47
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:24,661
Moncho!

48
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:26,022
Where were you going?

49
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:32,760
Like I said.
His plan was to go

50
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:35,135
to La Coruña and get on
a ship to America.

51
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:36,537
That little devil.

52
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:38,533
Have some cheese.

53
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:41,043
You shouldn't
have bothered, madam.

54
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:44,406
- How is he now?.
- Perfect

55
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:45,972
I can't believe it.

56
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:47,711
All night

57
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:49,253
outside with no food,

58
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,624
freezing, and he didn't
even catch a cold.

59
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:54,524
Why does he think
I hit students?

60
00:09:54,592 --> 00:09:56,719
They hit me at school...

61
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:59,821
I don't.
I’ve never hit anyone.

62
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:01,422
Least of all a child.

63
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,599
Tell him I’ve come
to apologize.

64
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:06,068
Please, Don Gregorio,

65
00:10:06,838 --> 00:10:08,169
it's not your fault...

66
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:10,365
He's a sensitive boy.

67
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,334
I want to apologize

68
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,470
and ask him
to return to school.

69
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,445
You won't have any cheese?

70
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:21,051
- Please call him.
- Yes, sir.

71
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:34,023
I like that name.
Sparrow.

72
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:36,859
We'll only use it
if you like it.

73
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:40,132
And forgive your schoolmates,
they aren't so bad.

74
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:43,606
Someday you'll
laugh at them.

75
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,203
It's very good.

76
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:56,283
Quiet! Quiet!

77
00:10:57,388 --> 00:10:58,116
Sit down!

78
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:01,459
Today we have
a new pupil.

79
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:04,155
That is a joy for all

80
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:07,756
and we shall greet him
with applause.

81
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:12,598
Very good.

82
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:16,299
Pull up that chair
and sit down next to me.

83
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,877
Today we'll begin
with a poem.

84
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:23,140
Who?

85
00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:27,108
Romualdo.
What will you read?

86
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,382
A poem, sir.

87
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:31,786
Which one?

88
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:34,416
Antonio Machado's
"Childhood Memory".

89
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:36,653
Very good. Go ahead.

90
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:37,820
Remember,

91
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:41,923
slowly and clearly.
And watch the punctuation.

92
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:47,699
"A cold and grey winter afternoon.

93
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:50,297
The pupils are studying.

94
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,708
Monotony of rain
behind the windows.

95
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:57,209
The classroom. A picture.

96
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:59,409
shows Cain, fugitive,

97
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:00,610
and Abel dead,

98
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:02,585
next to a crimson stain."

99
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,122
What does...

100
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,351
"monotony of rain" mean,
Romualdo?

101
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:10,655
When it rains, it pours,
Don Gregorio. - Good.

102
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:13,322
Now, a dictation...

103
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:16,395
Hello.

104
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:18,497
Come in, come in.

105
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:19,695
How are you?

106
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:22,865
I’m fine. But the boy isn't.

107
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:25,500
I don't understand.

108
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,708
Yesterday I gave him
a math problem,

109
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,577
and he was hopeless.

110
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:35,378
Yes... It’s true he should
work a bit harder, but...

111
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:37,717
Spare the rod...

112
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:42,890
Get those numbers
into his head.

113
00:12:43,494 --> 00:12:44,586
Give them to the teacher.

114
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:53,267
No, I can't accept them...

115
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:54,737
You won't snub me?

116
00:12:54,806 --> 00:12:57,969
Please, Don Avelino,
I wouldn't...

117
00:12:58,076 --> 00:13:00,374
They're very good.

118
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:04,677
Like I said: make
an effort with the boy.

119
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:05,647
Goodbye.

120
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:16,284
Take these capons.

121
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,195
What?

122
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:25,394
Put them in your desk
and return them to your father.

123
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,233
All right.

124
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:29,899
But he'll be angry.

125
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:35,412
He'll slap me.
Good Lord...

126
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:37,646
Well, then...

127
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:39,706
Tell him I can't
eat meat.

128
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:42,878
Fowl, I mean.

129
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:46,147
Right, tell him that.

130
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:48,992
Speaking of fowl...

131
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:52,928
lf a rooster lays an egg

132
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:56,057
on the border between
Spain and France,

133
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:58,694
which country's egg is it?

134
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:00,866
Spain's!

135
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:02,073
Why Spain?

136
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:03,768
We have bigger balls!

137
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:10,640
- What do you say?
- Roosters don't lay eggs.

138
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:14,978
Very good, Moncho. That's
the right answer.

139
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,216
Moncho,

140
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:19,683
sit there, with Roque.

141
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,622
Romualdo, you can start
the dictation.

142
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:34,894
"A cold and grey...

143
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:40,074
winter..." Next line.

144
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:42,378
"...afternoon."

145
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:45,011
Period.

146
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,677
I shat my pants
my first day of school.

147
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:52,113
- Hello.
- Hello, son.

148
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:54,414
Don Gregorio doesn't hit!

149
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,117
- Really?
- Really.

150
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:58,958
And he returned some capons

151
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,258
to a powerful rich man.

152
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:01,730
Who said that?

153
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,666
His son, José Maria, told me.

154
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:07,534
His dad's more powerful
than the mayor.

155
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:09,205
And the capons?

156
00:15:09,273 --> 00:15:12,834
A gift to the teacher
to make his son learn.

157
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,377
But his son won't study.

158
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:16,970
He says he'll be
a big shot anyway.

159
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:26,989
Know where potatoes
come from?

160
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:29,884
From fields, where else?

161
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:31,757
They come from America.

162
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:34,330
Don't be ridiculous.

163
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:36,764
It’s true!
Don Gregorio said so!

164
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:41,396
Before Colombus,
there were no potatoes in Spain.

165
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:42,996
What did people eat?

166
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:45,599
Chestnuts. There was no corn, either.

167
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:49,074
This teacher
is good.

168
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:50,409
I like him.

169
00:15:53,084 --> 00:15:53,914
Did you pray?

170
00:15:54,018 --> 00:15:56,145
- Where?
- In school.

171
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,053
Yes. Something
about Cain and Abel.

172
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:01,721
You can't trust gossip.

173
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:04,660
Don Gregorio, an atheist!

174
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:06,663
- Atheist?
- One who doesn't believe in God.

175
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:08,221
Like Daddy?

176
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:11,834
How can you say that?

177
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:13,165
He curses God.

178
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:24,170
Well, that's...
That's a sin.

179
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:25,916
Just a sin.

180
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:29,544
But he believes in God,
like all good people.

181
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:42,359
- What about the devil?
- Does he exist?

182
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:43,730
Of course he exists!

183
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:48,239
He was an angel
that rebelled against God.

184
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:50,366
He got pale in Hell.

185
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:52,466
So now he's
the angel of death.

186
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:59,406
Then why didn't God kill him?

187
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:01,585
God doesn't kill, Moncho.

188
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:11,796
They say they burned
churches in Barcelona!

189
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:14,094
Those Republicans
are like that!

190
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:15,900
They don't burn churches.

191
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,563
And thanks to the Republic,
we women can vote.

192
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,662
So what? I’d only vote
for Christ the King.

193
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,799
Kings aren't elected.

194
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:26,706
Things are bad.

195
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:30,336
But I know the solution,
yes, I do.

196
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:32,046
What solution?

197
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:34,378
Set fire to Madrid.

198
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:36,319
Don't be barbarous.

199
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:44,623
-May l, Don Gregorio?
-Of course.

200
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:46,457
Come here, Ramonciño.

201
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:49,489
Listen, Don Gregorio.

202
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:53,436
- Introibo ad altare Dei.
- ad Deum

203
00:17:53,504 --> 00:17:55,802
qui laetificat juventutem meam.

204
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:57,841
Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi,

205
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:59,206
ora pro nobis.

206
00:17:59,277 --> 00:18:01,745
- Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi,
- ora pro nobis.

207
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:03,279
Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi.

208
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:07,016
How many times is that?

209
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:10,585
You see? He can't remember
Dona nobis pacem.

210
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,121
He's going to be an altar boy?

211
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:16,683
He was going
to be an altar boy.

212
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:20,090
Go to your mother.

213
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:24,260
As soon as he started school
he lost interest.

214
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:28,103
You're not saying
I’m responsible?

215
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:31,869
I’m not saying anything.
The facts speak for themselves.

216
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:35,936
Understand him.
After being locked up so long,

217
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:39,346
it's natural for everything
to interest him.

218
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:41,408
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

219
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:44,386
- Your brother?
- He's working. Let's go.

220
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:45,717
All right.

221
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:49,191
Mommy, I’m with Aurora!

222
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:53,556
I see.

223
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,726
Nidos tepentes absilunt aves.

224
00:18:57,535 --> 00:18:59,867
"Birds leave the warmth
of their nests."

225
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:04,738
Libertas virorum fortium
pectora acuit.

226
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:08,540
"Freedom stimulates
the spirits of strong men."

227
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:15,043
God,
that's good.

228
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,191
"Ashes from an arnau lizard

229
00:19:26,264 --> 00:19:29,097
that was burned alive.

230
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,191
lf you mix it

231
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:33,032
with coffee,

232
00:19:33,104 --> 00:19:35,800
it fires the desire

233
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:40,003
of even the
haughtiest woman

234
00:19:40,077 --> 00:19:44,411
and makes her
yours for life."

235
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:48,141
Here, Roque, it's yours.

236
00:19:49,787 --> 00:19:51,379
I started this way
with Carmiña,

237
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:55,356
Carmiña de Saradón!
She's fire, Roque, fire!

238
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:57,518
How come we never see her?

239
00:19:57,995 --> 00:19:59,485
She says she can't leave her mother,

240
00:19:59,563 --> 00:20:01,258
but I think it's shame.

241
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:06,668
Still... She's has
no shame at all in bed!

242
00:20:10,174 --> 00:20:11,664
No, that's for her mother.

243
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:13,772
Carmiña doesn't need
help warming up her body.

244
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:17,871
As soon as I show up,
she lights up

245
00:20:17,948 --> 00:20:20,940
and presses those
rock-hard tits against me.

246
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:26,183
I lay her down, and she melts
like butter in my hands.

247
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:28,157
-You hump her every day?
- I wish.

248
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:29,993
Working in Coruña...

249
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:30,993
What's going on?

250
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:35,395
But Sunday makes up
for the rest of the week.

251
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,168
- You seem stuck on her.
- She's worth it.

252
00:20:38,502 --> 00:20:43,166
lf I touch her,
my vision is blurred.

253
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,607
She kisses me,
my head fills with bells.

254
00:20:46,677 --> 00:20:50,044
She embraces me
and I embrace heaven...

255
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:51,547
And her mother?

256
00:20:51,615 --> 00:20:53,242
I haven't even seen her.

257
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:56,377
She's always in bed,
she can't get up.

258
00:20:59,423 --> 00:21:01,323
But that fucking dog...

259
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:03,986
- The dog?
- It’s named Tarzan.

260
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:06,154
- Does it bite?.
- Almost

261
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,028
The bastard.
I drop my pants

262
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,500
and I feel him gnashing
his teeth behind me.

263
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:13,730
It’s like he was jealous.

264
00:21:13,804 --> 00:21:15,203
Know what Carmiña does?

265
00:21:15,272 --> 00:21:18,469
The more the dog
growls and barks,

266
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:20,942
the more she
presses herself against me.

267
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:22,501
Like it excited her.

268
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:26,106
Well, I’m on my way.

269
00:21:29,887 --> 00:21:32,947
- Careful with the dog.
- I’ll kill that bastard some day.

270
00:21:33,023 --> 00:21:34,752
What will it be?

271
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:35,985
An Orujo.

272
00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:51,172
Where are we going?

273
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:52,900
I told you: to see

274
00:21:52,977 --> 00:21:53,909
him hump her.

275
00:22:45,729 --> 00:22:47,458
That's humping?

276
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:49,495
- Haven't you seen dogs?
- When?

277
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:51,698
When a dog
gets stuck to a bitch.

278
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,236
People do the same thing.

279
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:56,270
But men hump women

280
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,902
when they're in love.

281
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:02,774
When they love each other.

282
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:17,184
Tie up the dog, Carmiña.

283
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:19,955
What do you care?

284
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:35,501
Leave him alone.

285
00:23:53,797 --> 00:23:54,991
He'll hump her now.

286
00:24:10,347 --> 00:24:11,746
The dog will bite him!

287
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:15,110
Goddamn dog...

288
00:24:18,322 --> 00:24:18,879
- Get out!
- Tarzan!

289
00:24:32,636 --> 00:24:33,432
What's wrong?

290
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:34,900
Nothing.

291
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:36,298
Nothing?

292
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:54,687
Tarzan! Tarzan! Tarzan!

293
00:25:05,936 --> 00:25:07,870
You said they
loved each other.

294
00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:11,740
Tarzan!

295
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:15,544
Tarzan!

296
00:25:38,402 --> 00:25:39,630
You know there are races?

297
00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:41,367
Look.

298
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:48,907
I like Chinese girls.

299
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,009
The teacher says
we're all the same.

300
00:25:54,018 --> 00:25:55,610
Chinese girls are prettier.

301
00:25:55,686 --> 00:25:58,849
When I’m older, I’ll go
to China and marry one.

302
00:26:06,964 --> 00:26:09,455
Do you know why
men hump women?

303
00:26:12,302 --> 00:26:14,236
The teacher
taught you that, too?

304
00:26:14,304 --> 00:26:16,397
They kiss and push each other.

305
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:18,072
Who?

306
00:26:18,475 --> 00:26:20,466
Men and women.

307
00:26:21,211 --> 00:26:22,735
Go to sleep.

308
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:40,354
And they touch each other's asses.

309
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,328
And now, the squash...

310
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:48,701
Make your pencils coincide
with the top

311
00:26:48,772 --> 00:26:52,765
of the squash,
and then...

312
00:26:52,843 --> 00:26:58,440
And then use
your finger to mark

313
00:26:58,515 --> 00:26:59,573
where the bottom is.

314
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:04,087
We now transfer the object's
height to the paper.

315
00:27:04,354 --> 00:27:08,120
Gentlemen, quiet please.

316
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,056
lf it doesn't work for you,
raise your hand.

317
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:21,067
Gentlemen...

318
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:24,706
Quiet... Gentlemen,

319
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:27,271
quiet.

320
00:27:30,447 --> 00:27:34,440
Fine. lf you won't be quiet,
I’ll have to be quiet.

321
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:52,861
What?

322
00:28:12,723 --> 00:28:13,712
Andrés!

323
00:28:26,103 --> 00:28:28,731
- What are you doing?
- Roque taught me how.

324
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:32,066
lf Dad sees you...

325
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:34,042
He won't if you don't tell him.

326
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:39,445
How's school?

327
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:41,245
We were drawing.

328
00:28:41,318 --> 00:28:43,650
Today he should have hit us.

329
00:28:44,888 --> 00:28:45,684
Why?

330
00:28:45,823 --> 00:28:48,257
We were shouting
and ignoring him.

331
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:51,385
Instead of hitting us,
he got very quiet.

332
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:52,824
And then?

333
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:55,421
Then bit by bit,
we quieted down.

334
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:58,658
- Didn't he say anything?
- "Thank you".

335
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:03,195
Look. I’m going
to learn to play it.

336
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:36,098
How many times
do I have to tell you?

337
00:29:36,173 --> 00:29:39,540
You have to hold it
like it was a girl.

338
00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:42,539
You've never held a girl?

339
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:45,414
Youth today!

340
00:29:47,684 --> 00:29:51,085
This way. This way,
firm but lovingly.

341
00:29:51,154 --> 00:29:52,212
Like a lover...

342
00:29:52,589 --> 00:29:54,147
Exactly!

343
00:29:54,224 --> 00:29:56,988
Your brother may be
the musician.

344
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:10,602
Music has the face of a woman
you want to love you!

345
00:30:11,808 --> 00:30:13,901
Close your eyes and imagine her!

346
00:30:14,845 --> 00:30:17,814
Imagine her hair,

347
00:30:19,683 --> 00:30:20,911
her eyes.

348
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:30,355
You are doing well.

349
00:30:31,862 --> 00:30:32,794
You are doing very well.

350
00:31:06,697 --> 00:31:08,494
- Can I play?
- No, there are too many of us.

351
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:52,303
Stop!

352
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:54,006
Stop, I said!

353
00:31:58,615 --> 00:31:59,377
What happened?

354
00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:01,246
He hit me with the ball.

355
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:03,149
He ran into Roque.

356
00:32:03,553 --> 00:32:07,182
You're like a couple
of butting rams. Time for class!

357
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,708
Stand up, rams.

358
00:32:29,646 --> 00:32:31,238
You, José Maria,

359
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:33,516
change places with Roque.

360
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
Don Gregorio...

361
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:40,851
But...

362
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:42,656
Yes?

363
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:44,353
Roque is my friend.

364
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:46,092
All right.

365
00:32:47,564 --> 00:32:49,088
Shake hands
with José Maria.

366
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,364
Sit down.

367
00:33:04,147 --> 00:33:08,743
Let's see... I don't know if you've
realized, but it's almost spring.

368
00:33:09,453 --> 00:33:12,047
So as soon as
the weather's better,

369
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:15,819
we'll do the natural history
class outside.

370
00:33:17,327 --> 00:33:19,158
Do you like nature?

371
00:33:21,331 --> 00:33:22,025
Right.

372
00:33:22,632 --> 00:33:24,497
You've never even noticed it.

373
00:33:24,935 --> 00:33:26,994
Nature, my friends,

374
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:31,131
is the most surprising
spectacle man can behold.

375
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:35,440
Did you know ants
have herds of livestock

376
00:33:35,512 --> 00:33:38,640
that give them
milk and sugar?

377
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:41,609
That spiders invented

378
00:33:41,685 --> 00:33:44,210
the submarine
millions of years ago?

379
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:49,486
Did you know
that butterflies have tongues?

380
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:52,121
The tongue of a butterfly

381
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:54,686
is like an elephant's trunk,

382
00:33:54,764 --> 00:33:59,133
but very thin and wound up
like a watch spring.

383
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:15,685
- You know where Australia is?
- In America.

384
00:34:15,685 --> 00:34:17,653
In Oceania.

385
00:34:17,754 --> 00:34:20,052
You know what a
"tilonorrinco" is?

386
00:34:22,392 --> 00:34:24,519
It’s a bird from Australia.

387
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:27,995
When it's in love, it gives
its girlfriend an orchid,

388
00:34:28,064 --> 00:34:31,033
a flower that's beautiful
and very expensive.

389
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:32,930
Hey, kids...

390
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:35,498
You're the tailor's sons, right?

391
00:34:37,274 --> 00:34:38,366
An instrument?

392
00:34:38,441 --> 00:34:39,430
A saxophone.

393
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:41,909
I thought so.

394
00:34:41,978 --> 00:34:45,470
- Do you play well?
- Great. I’ll be a musician, too.

395
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:46,880
What will you play?

396
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,680
The piano. The sax
isn't good for my lungs.

397
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:50,845
Great.

398
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:53,613
I have a band,
"The Blue Orchestra".

399
00:34:54,991 --> 00:34:56,856
Your father made
our costumes.

400
00:34:58,094 --> 00:35:01,257
"From the farthest shore,
the sunset behind us,

401
00:35:01,331 --> 00:35:05,199
The Blue Orchestra, from Galicia!"

402
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:06,200
Come with me.

403
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:14,233
Then we went
to the chocolate factory

404
00:35:14,311 --> 00:35:17,041
and they asked what
he could play

405
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:19,081
and I said "In the World"...

406
00:35:19,149 --> 00:35:24,018
Why did he take you
to the factory?

407
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:27,022
- The orchestra practices there.
- That's news to me.

408
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:27,920
Look!

409
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:32,424
In exchange, they advertise
the chocolate.

410
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:34,656
Between songs,
the musicians say:

411
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:36,562
"Exprés Chocolate, the best!"

412
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:39,796
They all say it together:
"Exprés Chocolate, the best!"

413
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:42,064
That's frivolous.

414
00:35:42,138 --> 00:35:44,368
Why should
a dance band be serious?

415
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:46,338
They'll pay you?

416
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:48,809
Macías said if I’m good,
we'll see.

417
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:50,846
You see?

418
00:35:50,981 --> 00:35:52,778
There's no easy
path to heaven.

419
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:54,646
After all, what has
he got to lose?

420
00:35:54,718 --> 00:35:56,242
Say yes, Mom!

421
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,882
You have to mend this.

422
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:04,250
It’s big enough for both of you.

423
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:10,095
First I’ll wash it.
God knows who wore it.

424
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:11,861
A sax player.

425
00:36:12,235 --> 00:36:14,430
Now I don't want
to play piano, Mom.

426
00:36:14,504 --> 00:36:17,337
Mr. Macías will teach me
the drums.

427
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:18,203
Great.

428
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:21,401
Calm down.

429
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:24,276
- When do you start?
- During the Carnival.

430
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:03,718
Ladies and gentlemen!

431
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:07,220
Ladies and gentlemen!

432
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:10,026
Your attention,
please.

433
00:37:11,328 --> 00:37:15,025
Ladies and gentlemen, we're
going to speak Castillian Spanish,

434
00:37:15,098 --> 00:37:18,499
since we forgot Gallego
on our last tour.

435
00:37:18,568 --> 00:37:20,900
of South America

436
00:37:27,777 --> 00:37:29,074
You don't have to play.

437
00:37:29,145 --> 00:37:30,806
But make it look
like you're playing,

438
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,338
get that body movement going.

439
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:37,884
One, two, three...

440
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:52,159
Peanuts...

441
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:55,870
If you want a little fun,

442
00:37:55,939 --> 00:37:58,601
buy yourself a bag of peanuts.

443
00:38:03,646 --> 00:38:05,637
When the evening is lonely,

444
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:09,617
my lovely little customer,

445
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:15,219
the peanut seller belts out
his pretty tune.

446
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:17,782
If the little girl hears his song,

447
00:38:17,861 --> 00:38:22,230
she'll come down

448
00:38:27,737 --> 00:38:29,898
Little customer, don't go to bed...

449
00:38:30,673 --> 00:38:31,697
You see that?

450
00:38:34,177 --> 00:38:35,974
And you didn't want him to play.

451
00:38:36,045 --> 00:38:38,240
I didn't know he could play so fine.

452
00:38:42,919 --> 00:38:45,820
Peanuts...

453
00:38:47,023 --> 00:38:49,321
Little customer, don't go to bed.

454
00:38:49,392 --> 00:38:51,792
without buying
a bag...

455
00:38:51,861 --> 00:38:53,522
Let's dance!

456
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,756
I don't know how.

457
00:38:55,532 --> 00:38:56,931
It’s time you learn it to.

458
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:02,571
is lonely, my lovely little customer,

459
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,540
the peanut seller belts
out his pretty tune.

460
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:14,413
If the little girl hears his song,
she’ll come down from her balcony...

461
00:39:16,386 --> 00:39:18,581
-You know who I am?
-Yes.

462
00:39:18,655 --> 00:39:20,919
- Who?.
- Aurora

463
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:22,656
How did you recognize me?

464
00:39:23,593 --> 00:39:24,685
I don't know...

465
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:28,360
- Because you're the prettiest.
- You couldn't see my face.

466
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:33,199
Look, the sax player
is my brother.

467
00:39:35,205 --> 00:39:37,799
- Do you know how to dance?
- More or less.

468
00:39:38,575 --> 00:39:39,166
Come on.

469
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,965
Well done, Sparrow.

470
00:40:47,733 --> 00:40:48,529
Wait...

471
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:55,404
Remember what I said
about a butterfly's tongue?

472
00:41:00,379 --> 00:41:02,108
And why?

473
00:41:02,181 --> 00:41:07,847
To reach the nectar
flowers keep in their chalices.

474
00:41:09,388 --> 00:41:11,879
Carefully, without bothering them.

475
00:41:12,825 --> 00:41:14,190
What's nectar?

476
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,287
Nectar is a sugary juice
flowers secrete

477
00:41:18,364 --> 00:41:19,763
to attract insects.

478
00:41:19,832 --> 00:41:22,130
In exchange, insects

479
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:25,371
spread the seed
of the flowers.

480
00:41:25,371 --> 00:41:28,169
Look, there's one.

481
00:41:28,808 --> 00:41:31,743
When you
touch the sugar jar

482
00:41:31,811 --> 00:41:36,771
with a moistened finger,
don't you already taste it

483
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:39,784
as if your finger tip
were your tongue?

484
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:43,213
The tongue of a butterfly
is like that.

485
00:41:43,956 --> 00:41:48,290
Smelling the nectar,
the butterfly

486
00:41:48,361 --> 00:41:51,694
and reaches the bottom
of the chalice.

487
00:41:52,665 --> 00:41:53,791
Look at this anthill!

488
00:42:06,645 --> 00:42:07,805
Don Gregorio!

489
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,541
Don Gregorio!

490
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:13,811
He's choking!

491
00:42:37,543 --> 00:42:40,034
Thank God you thought
of the water thing.

492
00:42:40,546 --> 00:42:43,174
It happened before.

493
00:42:43,249 --> 00:42:44,682
On his First Communion.

494
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,151
He was about to take communion,
and he was so excited

495
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,518
he got an attack.

496
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,350
A miracle!

497
00:42:53,926 --> 00:42:55,894
We got some holy water,

498
00:42:55,961 --> 00:42:56,893
splashed it on his face,

499
00:42:56,962 --> 00:42:59,226
and he was cured.

500
00:42:59,298 --> 00:43:02,028
Well the river water
isn't holy,

501
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:03,898
and it worked, too.

502
00:43:05,771 --> 00:43:08,831
I’ll give you some soup,
to warm you up.

503
00:43:10,776 --> 00:43:12,141
She's mystical.

504
00:43:12,278 --> 00:43:14,212
And you're Republican.

505
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,306
I’m in Manuel Azaña's party.

506
00:43:25,191 --> 00:43:26,385
- Don Gregorio...
- Yes?

507
00:43:26,459 --> 00:43:30,896
lf it's not a problem,
I’d like to measure you...

508
00:43:30,963 --> 00:43:31,588
for a suit.

509
00:43:32,665 --> 00:43:33,427
A suit?

510
00:43:34,433 --> 00:43:35,798
A gift...

511
00:43:36,669 --> 00:43:38,899
It’s just I’d like
to do something for you.

512
00:43:38,971 --> 00:43:41,735
And I know how
to make suits.

513
00:43:41,807 --> 00:43:42,774
It’s my trade.

514
00:43:43,476 --> 00:43:46,309
I have a great deal
of respect for trades.

515
00:43:46,412 --> 00:43:50,143
And I appreciate your offer.
But my principles...

516
00:43:50,216 --> 00:43:52,081
Principles between friends?

517
00:43:52,151 --> 00:43:54,381
We are friends, aren't we?

518
00:44:01,594 --> 00:44:02,788
Fifty-four...

519
00:44:06,165 --> 00:44:07,291
Seventy-one...

520
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:12,034
Forty-three...

521
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:16,033
MEASUREMENTS DON GREGORIO

522
00:44:19,044 --> 00:44:21,774
- What are you thinking about?
- The teacher.

523
00:44:22,915 --> 00:44:24,143
He's such a good person.

524
00:44:24,984 --> 00:44:26,781
I’m glad you're making
him the suit.

525
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:29,579
Teachers don't earn
what they should.

526
00:44:30,956 --> 00:44:33,220
They're the light
of the Republic.

527
00:44:33,292 --> 00:44:34,554
The Republic!

528
00:44:34,627 --> 00:44:37,596
Where will we end up
with that Azaña?

529
00:44:38,063 --> 00:44:39,655
What's wrong with Azaña?

530
00:44:39,732 --> 00:44:42,496
What you hear at Mass,
I’m sure.

531
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:44,000
I go to Mass to pray.

532
00:44:44,103 --> 00:44:47,231
You do, but the priests...

533
00:44:47,373 --> 00:44:48,635
go for another reason.

534
00:44:49,675 --> 00:44:51,939
Well, don't get angry.

535
00:44:53,145 --> 00:44:54,976
Moncho is all right.

536
00:44:55,981 --> 00:44:57,175
Give me a kiss.

537
00:44:59,618 --> 00:45:01,085
Don't be so boring.

538
00:45:29,915 --> 00:45:32,281
Your father
really is an artist.

539
00:45:33,152 --> 00:45:36,383
Look how elegant I am!

540
00:45:39,425 --> 00:45:41,916
My poor wife. I lost her

541
00:45:41,994 --> 00:45:44,121
when she was only 22.

542
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:48,095
As the poet said,
"An abandoned bed,

543
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:50,328
a cloudy mirror,
and an empty heart."

544
00:45:51,837 --> 00:45:53,168
"An abandoned bed,

545
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:55,901
a cloudy mirror and an empty heart."

546
00:45:57,343 --> 00:46:00,039
In other words,
I ended up all alone.

547
00:46:02,047 --> 00:46:02,945
You read much?

548
00:46:03,015 --> 00:46:03,982
Comic books.

549
00:46:04,049 --> 00:46:07,610
It’s time you start
reading real books

550
00:46:08,654 --> 00:46:10,451
Books are
like a home.

551
00:46:10,522 --> 00:46:12,114
THE CONQUEST OF BREAD

552
00:46:16,161 --> 00:46:20,097
In books, our dreams take
refuge so as

553
00:46:20,165 --> 00:46:22,099
not to freeze to death.

554
00:46:25,337 --> 00:46:26,099
Here,

555
00:46:26,171 --> 00:46:27,297
borrow this.

556
00:46:28,107 --> 00:46:30,075
TREASURE ISLAND
You'll like it.

557
00:46:32,578 --> 00:46:35,069
And I have a present
for you.

558
00:46:41,086 --> 00:46:41,916
Open it.

559
00:46:49,094 --> 00:46:50,561
You know what
it's for?

560
00:46:55,801 --> 00:46:56,563
I got it!

561
00:46:58,037 --> 00:46:59,368
Be careful.

562
00:47:00,673 --> 00:47:01,970
Don't hurt it.

563
00:47:04,176 --> 00:47:07,236
It’s an iris. Beautiful!

564
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,942
You see? It has four wings.

565
00:47:11,016 --> 00:47:13,951
The color and shine come from

566
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:16,510
a series of
overlapping plates,

567
00:47:16,588 --> 00:47:20,354
scales placed one over
the other, like roof tiles.

568
00:47:20,459 --> 00:47:21,483
And the tongue?

569
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,462
- The tongue is called "proboscis".
- Let's see it.

570
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:27,464
No, right now it's rolled up,

571
00:47:27,533 --> 00:47:30,297
otherwise it couldn't fly.

572
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:33,133
We'd need a microscope
to see it.

573
00:47:33,205 --> 00:47:34,866
What's that?

574
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:38,432
A device for seeing
infinitely small things.

575
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:40,740
I ordered one for the school,

576
00:47:40,813 --> 00:47:44,010
but you known things
go slowly in Madrid.

577
00:47:47,019 --> 00:47:49,715
lf we get one,
we can see its tongue.

578
00:47:51,357 --> 00:47:52,191
A cricket!

579
00:47:52,191 --> 00:47:54,716
It’s a "Prince Cricket".

580
00:47:54,793 --> 00:47:57,819
- How do you know? - It sings
better than a "King Cricket".

581
00:48:43,108 --> 00:48:44,234
Here it is!

582
00:49:07,666 --> 00:49:10,863
- Who could that be at this hour?
- Go see, son.

583
00:49:23,115 --> 00:49:25,106
This girl wants to see Dad.

584
00:49:26,151 --> 00:49:27,448
She says her mother's died.

585
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,293
Go to your room.

586
00:49:36,361 --> 00:49:38,659
- We're eating...
- So take your food!

587
00:49:47,606 --> 00:49:49,073
How did it happen?

588
00:49:49,141 --> 00:49:52,907
It must have been her heart.
I found her dead.

589
00:49:52,978 --> 00:49:56,470
- Did you call the doctor?
- Why? I went to see the priest.

590
00:49:57,783 --> 00:49:58,306
Right.

591
00:49:59,184 --> 00:50:01,652
The coffin and burial
cost 45 pesetas.

592
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,982
But I have no money.

593
00:50:04,389 --> 00:50:05,083
Wait.

594
00:50:19,638 --> 00:50:21,902
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

595
00:50:21,974 --> 00:50:23,168
Do what you must do.

596
00:50:30,782 --> 00:50:32,545
Why can't we see her?

597
00:50:33,418 --> 00:50:34,476
That's a secret.

598
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,845
- Tell me.
- No.

599
00:50:39,491 --> 00:50:40,958
I have a secret, too.

600
00:50:42,427 --> 00:50:43,724
About Carmiña.

601
00:50:43,795 --> 00:50:46,059
Who told you her name?

602
00:50:46,665 --> 00:50:49,896
Tell me your secret,
I’ll tell you mine.

603
00:50:52,905 --> 00:50:53,997
She's Dad's daughter.

604
00:50:56,475 --> 00:50:58,739
So... Why doesn't
she live with us?

605
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,374
Dad had her with that dead woman
before he married Mom.

606
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:07,444
How do you know her?

607
00:51:09,054 --> 00:51:11,784
Roque and I followed
this man O'Lis

608
00:51:11,857 --> 00:51:13,882
-... up to Carmiña's house.
- And?

609
00:51:13,959 --> 00:51:16,189
They got naked
and he humped her.

610
00:51:16,261 --> 00:51:18,126
That's why Mom sent
us away.

611
00:51:18,196 --> 00:51:19,891
- Why?
- She's a slut.

612
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,729
What does Dad say?

613
00:51:24,803 --> 00:51:26,771
Nothing. What could he say?

614
00:52:41,413 --> 00:52:42,311
Hello, Sparrow!

615
00:52:42,514 --> 00:52:43,811
Hello.

616
00:52:46,218 --> 00:52:48,709
- Is this your garden?
- It’s a friend's.

617
00:52:48,787 --> 00:52:51,585
But he lets me
pick fruit here.

618
00:52:51,657 --> 00:52:53,989
I got some apples.
Want one?

619
00:52:57,195 --> 00:52:58,389
They're delicious.

620
00:52:59,965 --> 00:53:01,125
Very juicy.

621
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:04,191
What are you doing here?

622
00:53:04,302 --> 00:53:07,169
- Watching a funeral.
- Really?

623
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,307
Who died?

624
00:53:13,111 --> 00:53:17,104
When someone dies,
do they die or not?

625
00:53:19,217 --> 00:53:20,275
What do your folks say?

626
00:53:21,086 --> 00:53:23,646
My mom says
good people go to heaven,

627
00:53:23,722 --> 00:53:25,713
and bad people go to hell.

628
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:27,787
And your father?

629
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,452
That if there's a Final Judgment,
the rich will bring

630
00:53:32,531 --> 00:53:35,261
their lawyers. My mother
doesn't find it funny.

631
00:53:36,902 --> 00:53:38,130
What do you think?

632
00:53:42,174 --> 00:53:43,334
I’m afraid.

633
00:53:44,743 --> 00:53:46,938
Can you keep a secret?

634
00:53:49,247 --> 00:53:50,271
Between you and l:

635
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:54,348
An otherworldly hell
does not exist.

636
00:53:55,153 --> 00:53:57,849
Hate and cruelty...

637
00:53:57,923 --> 00:53:59,447
that's hell.

638
00:54:00,792 --> 00:54:03,352
At times,
we ourselves are hell.

639
00:54:11,036 --> 00:54:15,666
APRIL 1 4, 1936
LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC!

640
00:54:18,143 --> 00:54:19,041
Who wants coffee?

641
00:54:20,645 --> 00:54:21,202
Coffee?

642
00:54:38,797 --> 00:54:40,094
A toast!

643
00:54:40,198 --> 00:54:42,166
- Long live the Republic!
- Long live!

644
00:55:25,277 --> 00:55:26,801
The king's lost his crown,

645
00:55:26,878 --> 00:55:28,743
it's only paper.

646
00:55:28,814 --> 00:55:31,044
The gold one was

647
00:55:31,116 --> 00:55:33,016
taken away by Berenguer.

648
00:55:33,185 --> 00:55:35,053
The king's

649
00:55:35,053 --> 00:55:37,521
Lost his crown, it's only cardboard.

650
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:39,420
The Spanish crown

651
00:55:39,491 --> 00:55:41,254
will be worn by no thief!

652
00:55:41,326 --> 00:55:43,954
Ramón... The Civil Guards.

653
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,430
So what?

654
00:56:05,483 --> 00:56:07,974
The doctors had me
on porridge for 7 years.

655
00:56:08,053 --> 00:56:09,987
My stomach got worse.

656
00:56:10,055 --> 00:56:11,989
One day I told my wife

657
00:56:12,624 --> 00:56:16,082
to make me a stew
with ham, sausage, and lard.

658
00:56:16,161 --> 00:56:18,686
- And I was cured.
- Hello.

659
00:56:42,654 --> 00:56:43,848
What's that song?

660
00:56:43,922 --> 00:56:46,482
I don't know.
I heard it on the radio.

661
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:55,030
Rose-colored dawn at sunrise.

662
00:56:55,667 --> 00:57:02,539
Melodious note
of a crying violin.

663
00:57:02,841 --> 00:57:11,078
Like in a novel, the insomnia
where she lived her story of love...

664
00:57:22,661 --> 00:57:23,389
Gentlemen!

665
00:57:23,461 --> 00:57:24,393
Listen up.

666
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,660
We've been hired
in Santa Maria de Lombás.

667
00:57:31,736 --> 00:57:35,934
All expenses paid and 70
pesetas, 70 beautiful pesetas!

668
00:57:43,081 --> 00:57:44,571
Get those shirts clean.

669
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:47,880
Santa Maria de Lombás,
look out!

670
00:57:48,386 --> 00:57:49,114
Me, too?

671
00:57:50,422 --> 00:57:51,081
Of course!

672
00:57:52,123 --> 00:57:52,782
And me?

673
00:59:12,404 --> 00:59:15,740
You won't be hungry here,
I tell you as the mayor.

674
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:19,335
Sausage, ham, cheese,
whatever you want.

675
00:59:22,814 --> 00:59:23,542
I’ll smash
your head in, Carolina!

676
00:59:23,615 --> 00:59:25,344
You know I will!

677
00:59:27,385 --> 00:59:29,717
I chose you because
I don't want

678
00:59:29,788 --> 00:59:30,686
men in my house.

679
00:59:30,755 --> 00:59:33,815
Adult men are
as thick as mules.

680
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:37,526
Baby! Coffee!

681
00:59:53,178 --> 00:59:54,805
Don't be scared.

682
00:59:55,847 --> 00:59:57,678
They make good manure.

683
01:00:04,522 --> 01:00:05,682
She doesn't speak,
but she can hear.

684
01:00:11,362 --> 01:00:14,388
Come on, show
the musicians their room.

685
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:15,823
Be quick.

686
01:00:59,711 --> 01:01:00,405
Thank you.

687
01:01:00,478 --> 01:01:01,843
Thank you very much.

688
01:01:07,085 --> 01:01:08,712
She's the Chinese girl
from the book!

689
01:01:10,221 --> 01:01:11,245
You're right!

690
01:01:25,036 --> 01:01:26,128
No, that's too much.

691
01:01:26,237 --> 01:01:27,761
No one says "no" here.

692
01:01:28,606 --> 01:01:29,470
Eat and grow, kid.

693
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:33,606
And her?

694
01:01:33,711 --> 01:01:34,678
Who?

695
01:01:38,683 --> 01:01:41,311
She already ate.
She eats like a bird.

696
01:01:43,588 --> 01:01:45,283
Want to see something?

697
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:48,455
Come here, baby.

698
01:01:54,299 --> 01:01:55,163
Look!

699
01:01:58,002 --> 01:01:59,993
This is where
the wolf bit her!

700
01:02:03,841 --> 01:02:04,739
Cover yourself.

701
01:02:07,779 --> 01:02:08,871
She was only four.

702
01:02:11,783 --> 01:02:13,774
We were
with the livestock.

703
01:02:15,987 --> 01:02:19,388
The wolves were hungry
and they tricked me.

704
01:02:21,926 --> 01:02:23,291
God did they trick me!

705
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,231
Aren't you going to eat?
I’ll get angry.

706
01:02:36,908 --> 01:02:39,035
We were in a meadow
near the woods.

707
01:02:42,313 --> 01:02:44,781
One of those bastards
appeared and then

708
01:02:44,849 --> 01:02:46,612
went back into the woods.

709
01:02:48,586 --> 01:02:50,781
The dogs tore off
after him

710
01:02:50,855 --> 01:02:52,152
and I went with them.

711
01:02:54,292 --> 01:02:57,022
We left her there, alone,

712
01:02:57,095 --> 01:02:59,655
sitting on a sack.

713
01:03:00,531 --> 01:03:02,021
It was just a moment,

714
01:03:02,934 --> 01:03:03,923
but when we returned

715
01:03:05,937 --> 01:03:06,801
she was gone.

716
01:03:10,942 --> 01:03:12,807
God, but those bastards
tricked me!

717
01:03:15,146 --> 01:03:16,170
But she survived.

718
01:03:17,582 --> 01:03:19,948
The wolf didn't want
to kill her.

719
01:03:20,718 --> 01:03:22,117
He just bit her back.

720
01:03:23,421 --> 01:03:25,548
The old people said the bite
was to silence her,

721
01:03:25,623 --> 01:03:28,524
so she wouldn't scream.

722
01:03:29,694 --> 01:03:31,662
And it sure did work.

723
01:03:34,065 --> 01:03:35,726
We found her in a wolf den.

724
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:40,999
She was fine,
but she never spoke again.

725
01:03:41,973 --> 01:03:43,065
Why is she Chinese?

726
01:03:43,508 --> 01:03:44,099
Who?

727
01:03:44,742 --> 01:03:45,572
Your daughter.

728
01:03:47,812 --> 01:03:49,575
She's my wife.

729
01:04:22,413 --> 01:04:25,940
The wise bird, using
the science of clairvoyance,

730
01:04:26,017 --> 01:04:29,350
picks out your fortune
from the magic box.

731
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:31,820
Want the bird
to tell your fortune?

732
01:07:17,421 --> 01:07:20,083
She came into my room,
took my hand,

733
01:07:20,157 --> 01:07:22,853
and we escaped
on horseback.

734
01:07:22,927 --> 01:07:25,828
- What did he do?
- He went after us with a knife.

735
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:29,299
But in Coruña,
we got on a boat to China...

736
01:07:33,771 --> 01:07:34,738
Look!

737
01:08:00,965 --> 01:08:03,627
I remember something
the teacher said.

738
01:08:04,368 --> 01:08:07,235
A bed, a mirror,

739
01:08:07,872 --> 01:08:09,237
and a heart

740
01:08:09,307 --> 01:08:10,797
are all empty.

741
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:15,411
In other words,
you're all alone.

742
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:20,882
I’m going to marry Roque's sister
when I grow up.

743
01:08:24,422 --> 01:08:27,289
Today, after a lifetime
dedicated to teaching,

744
01:08:27,358 --> 01:08:30,225
Don Gregorio is retiring.

745
01:08:30,695 --> 01:08:32,060
As mayor of this town,

746
01:08:32,129 --> 01:08:34,120
and in the name
of the authorities,

747
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:35,631
students and parents...

748
01:08:36,267 --> 01:08:38,758
I want to make clear our gratitude

749
01:08:38,836 --> 01:08:41,862
for what you've done
for our children:

750
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:44,669
prepare them for life,
and especially,

751
01:08:44,742 --> 01:08:46,505
for being good citizens.

752
01:08:49,413 --> 01:08:51,074
Don Gregorio,

753
01:08:51,182 --> 01:08:53,446
you know I’m not one
for speeches.

754
01:08:53,918 --> 01:08:58,116
Al I can really say...
is thank you.

755
01:08:58,189 --> 01:09:00,248
Thank you from the bottom
of our hearts.

756
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,495
Honorable authorities,

757
01:09:12,837 --> 01:09:13,826
dear children,

758
01:09:14,672 --> 01:09:16,697
and distinguished citizens.

759
01:09:17,908 --> 01:09:19,000
In springtime,

760
01:09:19,076 --> 01:09:24,013
the wild duck returns
to its home to mate.

761
01:09:24,081 --> 01:09:26,982
Nothing can stop him.

762
01:09:27,618 --> 01:09:30,485
lf you cut off his wings,
he'll swim.

763
01:09:30,554 --> 01:09:33,990
lf you cut off his feet,
he'll row with his beak,

764
01:09:34,058 --> 01:09:36,583
like an oar against the stream.

765
01:09:37,662 --> 01:09:38,594
This journey

766
01:09:39,096 --> 01:09:40,586
is his raison d'être.

767
01:09:41,799 --> 01:09:46,259
In the autumn of my life,
I should be skeptical.

768
01:09:46,337 --> 01:09:48,999
And in a way, I am.

769
01:09:49,874 --> 01:09:53,503
The wolf will never lie down

770
01:09:53,577 --> 01:09:54,976
with the lamb.

771
01:09:56,681 --> 01:09:58,478
But I am sure of one thing.

772
01:09:58,816 --> 01:10:01,717
lf we can allow
one generation,

773
01:10:02,386 --> 01:10:06,152
just one generation, to grow up
free in Spain,

774
01:10:06,223 --> 01:10:10,353
then no one will ever
be able to take away

775
01:10:10,428 --> 01:10:11,520
their liberty...

776
01:10:12,797 --> 01:10:13,559
Let's go!

777
01:10:26,043 --> 01:10:29,843
No one will be able to steal
that treasure from them!

778
01:10:38,222 --> 01:10:40,622
Thank you very much.

779
01:10:41,926 --> 01:10:43,917
And now, fly free!

780
01:11:20,965 --> 01:11:23,058
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

781
01:11:23,634 --> 01:11:26,103
We won't go
bug hunting anymore?

782
01:11:26,103 --> 01:11:26,933
Why not?

783
01:11:27,371 --> 01:11:30,966
Now that it's summer,
we can go every day.

784
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:32,008
Look...

785
01:11:32,543 --> 01:11:33,976
Better late than never.

786
01:11:36,547 --> 01:11:38,549
From the Ministry
of Education.

787
01:11:38,549 --> 01:11:41,040
We get the microscope,
Sparrow!

788
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:54,088
What's that?

789
01:11:54,965 --> 01:11:56,762
It’s a Lucanus cervus,

790
01:11:57,835 --> 01:11:58,995
a flying deer.

791
01:11:59,069 --> 01:12:01,663
It’s called that
because its mandibles

792
01:12:01,739 --> 01:12:03,832
look like antlers,

793
01:12:03,908 --> 01:12:06,741
and they fight over
females with them.

794
01:12:07,711 --> 01:12:09,736
They're the biggest
beetles in Europe.

795
01:12:11,782 --> 01:12:12,612
There's one!

796
01:12:16,287 --> 01:12:16,878
Give it to me!

797
01:12:27,798 --> 01:12:29,026
I got it!

798
01:12:31,368 --> 01:12:32,392
Careful...

799
01:12:33,204 --> 01:12:35,798
Very carefully...

800
01:12:39,443 --> 01:12:41,070
Now we'll see the tongue

801
01:12:41,145 --> 01:12:43,113
under the microscope.

802
01:13:00,231 --> 01:13:01,630
Won't you come in?

803
01:13:01,699 --> 01:13:03,257
He's scared!

804
01:13:03,334 --> 01:13:04,301
He's chicken!

805
01:13:04,735 --> 01:13:05,759
Don't let him come!

806
01:13:09,273 --> 01:13:11,070
Remember
the tilonorrinco?

807
01:13:12,243 --> 01:13:15,770
That bird that gives
its girlfriend a flower that's

808
01:13:15,846 --> 01:13:17,973
- very expensive.
- Right!

809
01:13:18,782 --> 01:13:19,646
An orchid.

810
01:13:25,789 --> 01:13:27,017
Come on.

811
01:13:27,091 --> 01:13:28,888
Be like a tilonorrinco.

812
01:13:28,959 --> 01:13:31,587
But this isn't an orchid.

813
01:13:32,263 --> 01:13:33,195
That doesn't matter.

814
01:14:02,293 --> 01:14:03,783
- Can you swim?
- No.

815
01:14:03,861 --> 01:14:04,850
Me, neither.

816
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:07,562
Don't look.

817
01:14:07,631 --> 01:14:08,359
Here.

818
01:14:10,401 --> 01:14:11,368
Shut your eyes.

819
01:14:35,693 --> 01:14:38,890
During his speech, received
with anger in the chamber,

820
01:14:38,963 --> 01:14:41,227
Mr. Gil Robles said

821
01:14:41,298 --> 01:14:44,734
a country can live
as a monarchy or a republic,

822
01:14:44,802 --> 01:14:48,067
with a parliamentary
or presidential system,

823
01:14:48,138 --> 01:14:50,698
soviet or fascist,

824
01:14:50,774 --> 01:14:53,470
but not in utter anarchy.

825
01:14:53,544 --> 01:14:57,981
He affirmed that Spain attends
the funeral of democracy...

826
01:14:58,349 --> 01:15:01,785
That pear-headed bastard!
They want

827
01:15:01,852 --> 01:15:02,580
it dead!

828
01:15:04,521 --> 01:15:05,852
Mr. Calvo Sotelo said
to affirm once again that

829
01:15:05,923 --> 01:15:10,622
a viable government
cannot be based

830
01:15:10,694 --> 01:15:12,389
on the present constitution,
and "instead of this sterile state,

831
01:15:12,463 --> 01:15:18,026
The Republic will survive!

832
01:15:18,102 --> 01:15:23,563
"...Many name this state
'the fascist state'.

833
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:26,939
If this is a fascist state,
then I,

834
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:29,971
Careful...

835
01:15:32,816 --> 01:15:33,305
Careful...

836
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:37,848
An Orujo.

837
01:15:42,793 --> 01:15:43,760
You've already had a few.

838
01:15:44,995 --> 01:15:45,825
I’ve had...

839
01:15:47,965 --> 01:15:48,693
what I’ve had to.

840
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:50,956
Driving oxen?

841
01:15:54,271 --> 01:15:55,238
Maybe.

842
01:15:55,305 --> 01:15:55,669
Come on.

843
01:15:57,141 --> 01:15:58,665
Give me that,
it's dangerous.

844
01:15:59,977 --> 01:16:01,069
I need it.

845
01:16:15,459 --> 01:16:18,087
I’ll pay for it... I’ll pay.

846
01:16:31,608 --> 01:16:32,336
Let's go.

847
01:16:33,811 --> 01:16:35,472
I have to go home
with my dad.

848
01:16:35,579 --> 01:16:37,843
They're talking
about politics.

849
01:17:02,539 --> 01:17:03,233
Let's go.

850
01:18:18,482 --> 01:18:19,141
Tarzán!

851
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:53,778
Moncho!

852
01:18:56,053 --> 01:18:57,020
Moncho!

853
01:19:01,558 --> 01:19:03,048
- What?
- Come to the house.

854
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,050
We're playing a game!

855
01:19:05,162 --> 01:19:07,562
There's a war in Africa.

856
01:19:07,664 --> 01:19:09,256
I heard it on the radio.

857
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:10,300
Why?

858
01:19:10,367 --> 01:19:12,135
Something about Spain
and God...

859
01:19:12,135 --> 01:19:13,864
- Up with Spain!
- Hooray!

860
01:19:18,742 --> 01:19:20,642
Get the newspapers, Ramón.

861
01:19:22,312 --> 01:19:23,040
Thank God!

862
01:19:28,885 --> 01:19:29,579
Your card...

863
01:19:29,653 --> 01:19:30,585
Your card...

864
01:19:36,927 --> 01:19:37,723
It’s the war?

865
01:19:40,497 --> 01:19:41,361
Yes.

866
01:19:41,932 --> 01:19:43,593
They say the
military has risen up.

867
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:51,407
Help me.

868
01:19:52,976 --> 01:19:56,707
lf anyone asks,
Dad never said

869
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:59,772
anything against the priests.
And he's not a Republican.

870
01:20:01,918 --> 01:20:04,887
Moncho, listen carefully
to what I’m saying.

871
01:20:04,955 --> 01:20:08,857
Dad never gave
a suit to the teacher.

872
01:20:08,925 --> 01:20:09,857
You understand?

873
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,325
- Yes, he did.
- No he didn't!

874
01:20:11,395 --> 01:20:13,590
You understand?

875
01:20:13,664 --> 01:20:15,097
He didn't!

876
01:20:15,232 --> 01:20:17,894
No, he didn't give him the suit.

877
01:20:25,842 --> 01:20:26,809
Long live the Republic!

878
01:20:27,811 --> 01:20:28,573
Long live.

879
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:42,815
- Who is it?
- Open the door, ma'am.

880
01:20:46,163 --> 01:20:48,131
- Is your husband here?
- No, he isn't.

881
01:20:48,198 --> 01:20:49,358
Know where he is?

882
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:52,359
Please tell him
the mayor wants to see us.

883
01:20:52,436 --> 01:20:54,529
He needs us.

884
01:20:55,005 --> 01:20:55,869
I’ll tell him.

885
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:45,451
TREASURE ISLAND

886
01:22:05,475 --> 01:22:06,635

887
01:22:09,112 --> 01:22:10,044
Andrés...

888

890
01:24:03,426 --> 01:24:04,791
God forgive us.

891
01:24:05,328 --> 01:24:06,556
God forgive us all.

892
01:24:31,888 --> 01:24:32,752
Ready.

893
01:24:59,115 --> 01:24:59,911
