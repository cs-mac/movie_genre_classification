1
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,300
Singin' in the rain

2
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,300
Just singin' in the rain

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,500
What a glorious feelin'

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,500
We're happy again

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,800
We'll walk down the lane

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,800
With a happy refrain

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,500
And singin'
Just singin' in the rain

8
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,900
This is Dora Bailey...

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,600
talking to you from the front of
the Chinese Theater in Hollywood.

10
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,800
What a night, ladies and gentlemen!

11
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,300
Every star in
Hollywood's heaven is here...

12
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,000
to make Monumental Pictures'
premiere of 'The Royal Rascal'...

13
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,300
the outstanding event of 1927.

14
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,500
Everyone is breathlessly awaiting...
the arrival of Lina Lamont
and Don Lockwood.

15
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,700
Look who's arriving now!

16
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,400
It's that famous
Zip Girl of the screen...

17
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,800
the darling of the flapper set,
Zelda Zanders.

18
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,600
Zelda! Oh, Zelda!

19
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,200
With her new red-hot pash,
J. Cumberland Spendrill III...

20
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,800
that well-known eligible bachelor.

21
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,700
Zelda's had so much unhappiness.

22
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,400
I hope this time it's really love.

23
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,800
And here comes that exotic star,
Olga Mara...

24
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,900
and her new husband,
the Baron de la Bonnet de la Toulon.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,100
They've been married
two months already...
but still as happy as newlyweds.

26
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,200
Well, well, well.

27
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,700
It's Cosmo Brown!

28
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,000
Cosmo is Don Lockwood's best friend.

29
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,900
He plays the piano for Don and Lina
to get them into those romantic moods.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,300
Oh, folks, this is it!

31
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,700
The stars of tonight's picture,
those romantic lovers of the screen...

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,600
Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont!

33
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
when you look at this gorgeous couple...

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,800
it's no wonder they're
a household name all over the world...

35
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,000
like bacon and eggs.

36
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,200
Lockwood and Lamont.

37
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,500
Don, you can tell me confidentially...

38
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,200
are these rumors true that wedding bells
are soon to ring for you and Lina?

39
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,000
Lina and I have no statement to make
right now. We're just good friends.

40
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,300
You've come a long way together, Don.
Won't you tell us how it all happened?

41
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,600
Well, Lina and I have made
a number of pictures together...

42
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,300
No, no, Don.
I want your story from the beginning.

43
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,300
Dora, not in front
of all these people.

44
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes!

45
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,700
But, Don, the story of your success
is an inspiration...

46
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,300
to young people all over the world.

47
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,500
- Please.
- Yes!

48
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,100
Well, to begin with,
any story of my career...

49
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,000
would have to include
my lifelong friend, Cosmo Brown!

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,900
We were kids together,
grew up together, worked together.
Yes?

51
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,400
Well, Dora, I've had one motto
which I've always lived by:

52
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,700
Dignity.

53
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,900
Always dignity.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,500
This was instilled in me by Mom and Dad
from the very beginning.

55
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,800
They sent me to the finest schools,
including dancing school.

56
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,200
That's where I first met Cosmo.

57
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,600
And with him, I used to perform for
all of Mom and Dad's society friends.

58
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,900
They used to make such a fuss over me.

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,900
If I was good, I was allowed to
accompany Mom and Dad to the theater.

60
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,500
They brought me up on Shaw, Moliere...

61
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,600
the finest of the classics.

62
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,100
To this was added musical training
at the Conservatory of Fine Arts.

63
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,600
We rounded out our apprenticeship...
at the most exclusive
dramatics academy.

64
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,900
And at all times...

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,200
the motto remained: Dignity.

66
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,200
Always dignity.

67
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,400
In a few years, Cosmo and I embarked
on a dance concert tour.

68
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,700
We played the finest
symphonic halls in the country.

69
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,100
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love
I can jump over the moon up above

70
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,700
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love

71
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,700
Haven't a worry, haven't a care
Feel like a feather
that's floatin' on air

72
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,300
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love

73
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,100
Soon the church bells
will be ringin'
And a march with Ma and Pa

74
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,900
All the church bells will be ringin'
With a hey-nonny-nonny
and a hot-cha-cha

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,600
Hi-diddle-diddle, my baby's okay
Ask me a riddle, I'm happy to say

76
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,100
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love

77
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,300
Audiences everywhere adored us.

78
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,000
Finally, we decided
to come to sunny California.

79
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,000
We were stranded...

80
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,900
We were staying here when the offers
from movie studios started pouring in.

81
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,700
We sorted them out and decided
to favor Monumental Pictures.

82
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,400
Okay, Lina, you hate him.
Keep that mood music going.

83
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,100
Phil, you come in. Keep on grinding.
Now you see her.

84
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,700
Now here's the bit, Bert,
where you get it on the jaw.

85
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,700
Cut! No, no!
That wasn't right, Bert!

86
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,300
You were supposed to go over the bar
and crash into the glasses!

87
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,200
Try it again, okay, Bert? Bert!

88
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,600
Oh, that's just swell!

89
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,200
Take him away, fellas.
You'll be all right, Bert.

90
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,900
We've lost more darn stuntmen
on this picture!

91
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,100
It'll take hours to get
a new one over from central casting!
Mr. Dexter, I can do that.

92
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,100
- You're a musician!
- That's a moot point.

93
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
No kidding!
What's your name?

94
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,900
Don Lockwood, sir,
but the fellas call me Donald.

95
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,800
Wise guy, huh?
Okay, I'll try you.

96
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,900
Get this guy into Bert's suit!

97
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,300
And remember, Lockwood, you might be
trading that fiddle in for a harp!

98
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,900
Camera!

99
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,800
Phil, come in!
Now you see him!

100
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,600
Here's where you get it
right on the jaw!

101
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,100
Cut! That was wonderful!

102
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,600
You got any more little chores
you want done?
Plenty.

103
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,000
My roles in these films were urbane...

104
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,300
sophisticated, suave.

105
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,500
And of course,
all through those pictures...

106
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,000
Lina was, as always,
an inspiration to me.

107
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,900
Warm and helpful. A real lady.

108
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,200
Hello, Miss Lamont.
I'm Don Lockwood, the stuntman.

109
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,300
It was sure a thrill
working with you, Miss Lamont.

110
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,800
Don, I want you to meet the producer
of the picture, Mr. R.F. Simpson.

111
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,900
I just saw some rushes for the picture
and asked Dexter who the stuntmen were.

112
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,400
He told me they were all you.

113
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,400
I'm putting you and Lina together
in a picture. Come to my office.

114
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,900
- We'll discuss a contract.
- Thanks, Mr. Simpson!

115
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,700
Are you doing anything tonight,
Miss Lamont?

116
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,300
Well, that's funny.
I'm busy.

117
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,700
Lina and I have had the same
wonderful relationship ever since.

118
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,200
But most important of all,
I continue living up to my motto:

119
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,900
Dignity.

120
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,700
Always dignity.

121
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,800
Thank you, Don.

122
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,500
And I'm sure you and Lina will continue
making movie history tonight...

123
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,800
in your greatest picture,
'The Royal Rascal.'

124
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,000
Get enough, boys?

125
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,700
She's so refined.

126
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,200
I think I'll kill myself.

127
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,300
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

128
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,700
We're pretty darn thrilled at your
response to 'The Royal Rascal.'

129
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,800
We had fun making it, and we hope
you had fun seeing it tonight.

130
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,000
We screen actors aren't much good
at speaking in public...

131
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,000
so we'll just act out our thanks.

132
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,300
It's a smash, eh, Mr. Simpson?
It's a smash, eh, Mr. Simpson?

133
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,200
- Don. Lina, you were gorgeous.
- You look pretty good for a girl.

134
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,900
For heaven's sake, what's the big idea?

135
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Can't a girl get a word in edgewise?
After all, they're my public too!

136
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,300
The publicity department, Rod here,
thought it would be much better...

137
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,700
if Don made the speeches
for the team.
Why?

138
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,000
You're a beautiful woman. Audiences
think you've got a voice to match.

139
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,200
The studio's gotta keep their stars
from looking ridiculous at any cost.

140
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,600
- No one's got that much money.
- What's wrong with the way I talk?

141
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,900
What's the big idea?
Am I dumb or something?

142
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,100
No. It's just that Don's
had so much more experience...

143
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,800
Next time, write me out a speech.
I could memorize it.

144
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,100
Why don't you go out now
and recite the Gettysburg Address?

145
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,000
What do you know about it,
you piano player? Are you anybody?

146
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,500
Donnie, how can you let him
talk to me like that, your fiancée?

147
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,300
My fian...

148
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,800
Now, Lina, you've been reading
those fan magazines again.

149
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,300
You shouldn't believe
all that banana oil...

150
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,700
that Dora Bailey
and the columnists dish out.

151
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,800
Now try to get this straight.
There is nothing between us.

152
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,400
There has never been
anything between us. Just air.

153
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,900
Oh, Donnie, you don't mean that.

154
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,300
Come on. We'll be late
for R.F.'s party.

155
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,100
You better go in separate cars
to break up the mobs, huh?

156
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,000
Ta-ta, Donnie! See ya there!

157
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,300
Donnie. What's wrong with that girl?
Can't she take a gentle hint?

158
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,600
Haven't you heard? She's irresistible.
She told me so herself.

159
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,300
I can't shake her. This cooked-up
romance, just for publicity.

160
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,100
The price of fame.
You've got the glory.

161
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,100
You've gotta take the little heartaches
that go with it. Look at me.

162
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,200
I got no glory. I got no fame.
I got no mansions. I got no money.

163
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,800
But I've got...
What have I got?

164
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,000
- I don't know. What?
- I gotta get outta here.

165
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,400
Don't tell me.
It's a flat tire.

166
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,500
I don't understand. This car hasn't
given me trouble for six hours.
There's Don Lockwood!

167
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,900
- Give me your autograph!
- Hi, kids!

168
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,100
I want a souvenir!
- I want a souvenir too!
- Hold on there!

169
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,100
You're tearing my...

170
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,800
Hey, Cos, call me a cab!

171
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,200
Okay, you're a cab.
Thanks a lot!

172
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,200
- Lady, keep driving.
- Get out of here!

173
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,700
- I'll call the police!
- Don't do that.

174
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,800
- Don't hurt me!
- I'm not a criminal.

175
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,000
You are a criminal!
I've seen that face before.

176
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,700
- You're a famous gangster!
- Let me explain...

177
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,200
I've seen your picture
in the post office. Officer!

178
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,600
This man jumped into my car...

179
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,200
- Why, it's Don Lockwood!
- Don Lockwood?

180
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,400
- Out for a joyride?
- Just a lift, Officer.

181
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
My car broke down,
I got surrounded...

182
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,000
You're a lucky lady.
Anything wrong?

183
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
- Why, no.
- I should think not. Good night.

184
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,900
Good night, Officer.

185
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,300
Well, thanks for saving my life.
I'll get out now.

186
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,300
I'm driving to Beverly Hills.
Can I drop you someplace?

187
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,900
I'd like to get out of this torn suit
if you're going by Camden and Sunset.

188
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,200
Yes, I am.

189
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,800
I'd very much like to know
whose hospitality I'm enjoying.
Selden. Kathy Selden.

190
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,000
Enchanted, Miss Selden.

191
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,500
I'm sorry I frightened you.
I was getting a little too much love
from my adoring fans.

192
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,500
Oh, that's what you were
running away from.

193
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,700
They did that to you?
That's terrible.

194
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,100
Yes, it is, isn't it?

195
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,200
It is terrible.

196
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,900
Well, we movie stars get the glory.

197
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,300
I guess we have to take
the little heartaches that go with it.

198
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:11,200
People think we lead lives
of glamour and romance...
but we're really lonely.

199
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,100
Terribly lonely.

200
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,800
Mr. Lockwood, I can't tell you how sorry
I am about taking you for a criminal...

201
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,500
but it was understandable
under the circumstances.

202
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,700
- I knew I'd seen you.
- Which of my pictures have you seen?

203
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,700
I don't remember.
I saw one once.

204
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,700
- You saw one once?
- You were dueling.

205
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,000
There was a girl, Lina Lamont.
Though I don't go to the movies much.

206
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
If you've seen one,
you've seen them all.

207
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,700
- Thank you.
- No offense.

208
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,200
Movies are entertaining
enough for the masses...

209
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,500
but the personalities on the screen
just don't impress me.

210
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,300
They don't talk, they don't act.
They just make a lot of dumb show.
Well, you know.

211
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,300
Like that.

212
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,900
You mean, like what I do?

213
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,300
Well, yes.

214
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,100
Well, yes.
Here we are, Sunset and Camden.

215
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,000
Wait a minute.
You mean, I'm not an actor?

216
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,700
- Pantomime on the screen isn't acting?
- Of course not.

217
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,300
Acting means great parts, wonderful
lines, speaking those glorious words.

218
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,200
- Words.
- Shakespeare, Ibsen.

219
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,600
What's your lofty mission in life that
lets you sneer at my humble profession?

220
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,400
Well, I'm an actress.
On the stage.

221
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Oh, on the stage.

222
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,900
I'd like to see you act.
What are you in now?

223
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,200
I could brush up on my English
or bring along an interpreter...

224
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,500
if they'd let in a movie actor.

225
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,800
I'm not in a play now, but I will be.
I'm going to New York...

226
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,000
You're going to New York.
Someday we'll all hear of you, won't we?

227
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,300
Kathy Selden as Juliet,
as Lady Macbeth, as King Lear.

228
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,300
You'll have to wear a beard
for that one.

229
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,900
Laugh if you want to, but at least
the stage is a dignified profession.

230
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,100
What are you so conceited about?

231
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,300
You're nothing but a shadow on film.
You're not flesh and blood.

232
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,100
- Stop!
- Why? I'm only a shadow.

233
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,400
Just because you're
a big movie star...

234
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,500
you expect every girl to fall
in a dead faint at your feet!

235
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,900
Well, don't you touch me!
Fear not, sweet lady.
I will not molest you.

236
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,300
I am but a humble jester...

237
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,400
and you are too far above me.

238
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,500
Farewell, Ethel Barrymore.

239
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,400
I must tear myself from your side.

240
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,000
- Is this R.F. Simpson's house?
- Yes, miss.

241
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,700
- I'm from the Coconut Grove.
- Around the back, please.

242
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,200
I see. Thank you.

243
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,700
- Nice party, R.F.
- Thanks, Roscoe.

244
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,000
Mr. Brown, do you really think
you could get me in the movies?

245
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,100
- I should think so.
- Really?

246
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,100
There's Don!
I loved the picture tonight.

247
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,800
- Don, did you come by way of Australia?
- Hello, Cos.

248
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,000
Listen, Cos, tell me the truth.
Am I a good actor?

249
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,800
As long as I'm working for Monumental,
you're the greatest.

250
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,500
You're my pal.
You can tell me.

251
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,800
What's the matter?
Of course you're good.

252
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,300
Maybe you should tell me
from time to time.

253
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,600
- I feel a little shaken.
- The new Don Lockwood.

254
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,400
Where have you been?
We've been waiting for you.

255
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,300
There you are, Donnie.
I was lonely.

256
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,100
- Hello, Lina.
- Okay, fellas, hold it.

257
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,600
Together again, like two little stars.
Don and Lina.

258
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,300
No kidding, folks.
Aren't they great?

259
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,600
All right, open that screen.

260
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,200
- A movie? We've just seen one.
- Hollywood law says we have to.

261
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,100
I've got a few little
surprises for you tonight.

262
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,400
All right, everyone, sit down.
This will give you a lot of laughs.

263
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,900
There's a madman coming into
my office now for months, and...

264
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,000
- Got that gadget working, Sam?
- All set, Mr. Simpson.

265
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
- Got that gadget working, Sam?
- All set, Mr. Simpson.
Okay, let her go.

266
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,900
Hello.

267
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,300
This is a demonstration
of a talking picture.

268
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,700
Notice, it is a picture of me,
and I am talking.

269
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,000
Note how my lips
and the sound issuing from them...

270
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,700
are synchronized together...

271
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,700
in perfect unison.

272
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,700
- Who's that?
- Somebody's talking behind that screen.

273
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,800
- Come out from there, Mr. Simpson.
- No, I'm right here.

274
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,600
My voice has been
recorded on a record.

275
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,200
A talking picture.

276
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,200
Thank you. Good-bye.

277
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,300
- Well?
- It's just a toy.

278
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,400
- It's a scream!
- It's vulgar.

279
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,800
- Think they'll ever use it?
- I doubt it.

280
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,100
The Warner Brothers are making a whole
talking picture, 'The Jazz Singer.'

281
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,600
They'll lose their shirts.
What do you think, Dexter?

282
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,900
- It'll never amount to a thing.
- They said that about automobiles.

283
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,400
Let's get on with the show, boys.
Come on, my little starlets.

284
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,200
I have a delicious surprise.
A very special cake.

285
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,200
I want you kiddies
to have the first piece.

286
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,500
Well, if it isn't Ethel Barrymore.

287
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,800
I do hope you're gonna favor us
with something special.

288
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,500
- Please.
- Say Hamlet's soliloquy.

289
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,400
- Or a scene from 'Romeo and Juliet.'
- Mr. Lockwood...

290
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,000
Don't be shy. You'd make about the
prettiest Juliet I've ever seen, really.

291
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,100
All I do is dream of you
the whole night through

292
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,000
With the dawn I still go on
dreaming of you

293
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,100
You're every thought
You're everything
You're every song I ever sing

294
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,000
Summer, winter, autumn and spring

295
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,100
And were there more
than 24 hours a day

296
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,100
They'd be spent in sweet content
dreaming away

297
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,200
When skies are gray
When skies are blue
Morning, noon and nighttime too

298
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,200
All I do the whole day through
is dream of you

299
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
You're the cat's meow!

300
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,600
All I do the whole day through
is dream of you

301
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,500
- I have to tell you how good you were.
- Excuse me.

302
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,200
Now that I know where you live,
I'd like to see you home.

303
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,800
- Listen, Mr. Lockwood...
- Say! Who is this dame?

304
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,900
Oh, someone lofty
and far above us all.

305
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,200
She couldn't learn
anything from the movies.

306
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,500
She's an actress
on the legitimate stage.

307
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,700
Here's one thing
I've learned from the movies!

308
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,900
Lina, she was aiming at me!

309
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,800
- You've never looked lovelier.
- It was just an accident.

310
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,200
It happens to me
five or six times a day.
Where is she?

311
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,900
Donnie?

312
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,500
Excuse me.
Where'd Miss Selden go?

313
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,300
She just grabbed her things and vaulted.
Anything I can do?

314
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,000
Sorry. I don't have time
to find out.

315
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,400
Keep that action going.
Let's have more steam in the kettle.

316
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,800
A little more action, boys.
More steam and water in that kettle.

317
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,500
- Good morning, fellas.
- Did you read 'Variety' today?

318
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,500
'First talking picture, The Jazz Singer,
all-time smash by end of first week.'

319
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,700
- All-time flop by end of the second.
- We start today.

320
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,100
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

321
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,600
I am now Count Pierre de Battaille,
better known as the Dueling Cavalier.

322
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,700
- What's this one about?
- It's a French Revolution story.

323
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,100
You're a French aristocrat,
and she's a simple girl of the people...

324
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,000
and she won't even
give you a tumble.
Well, it's a living.

325
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,600
Hit him. Hit him.

326
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,600
Knock him down.
Get up there and hit him again.

327
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,100
Why bother to shoot this picture?
Release the old one under a new title.

328
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,700
If you've seen one,
you've seen them all.

329
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,900
- What'd you say that for?
- What's the matter?

330
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,900
That's what that Kathy Selden
said to me that night.

331
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,500
That's three weeks ago.
Are you still thinking about that?

332
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,400
- Well, I can't get her out of my mind.
- How could you?

333
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,700
She's the first dame who hasn't fallen
for your line since you were four.

334
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,300
- I guess she's on my conscience.
- It's not your fault she lost her job.

335
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,900
- I've got to find her.
- You've been trying to...

336
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,400
short of sending out
bloodhounds and a posse.

337
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,200
Snap out of it. Don't let
a little thing get you down.

338
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,000
You're Don Lockwood, aren't you?
Donald Lockwood's an actor, isn't he?

339
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,300
What's the first thing an actor learns?
The show must go on!

340
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,500
Come rain, come shine, come snow,
come sleet, the show must go on!

341
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,200
Ridi, Pagliacci, ridi.

342
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,800
The world's so full
of a number of things.

343
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,300
I'm sure we should all
be as happy as...

344
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,300
But are we? No.
Definitely no.

345
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,600
Positively no!
Decidedly no!

346
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Short people have long faces,
and long people have short faces.

347
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,900
Big people have little humor,
and little people have no humor at all.

348
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,700
And in the words of that immortal bard,
Samuel J. Snodgrass...

349
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,200
as he was about to be led
to the guillotine...

350
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,000
as he was about to be led
to the guillotine...
Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh

351
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,400
Don't you know
everyone wants to laugh

352
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,800
My dad said
Be an actor, my son

353
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,200
But be a comical one

354
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,200
They'll be standin' in lines

355
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,600
For those old
honky-tonk monkeyshines

356
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,600
Now you could study Shakespeare
and be quite elite

357
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,500
And you could charm the critics
and have nothing to eat

358
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Just slip on a banana peel
The world's at your feet

359
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,700
Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh
make 'em laugh

360
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,600
Make 'em laugh

361
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,000
Don't you know
everyone wants to laugh

362
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,600
My grandpa said
Go out and tell 'em a joke

363
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,100
But give it plenty of hoke

364
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,900
Make 'em roar
make 'em scream

365
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,300
Take a fall, butt a wall
split a seam

366
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,300
You start off by pretending
you're a dancer with grace

367
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,300
You wiggle 'til they're giggling
all over the place

368
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,200
And then you get
a great big custard pie in the face

369
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,400
Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh
make 'em laugh

370
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,400
Make 'em laugh

371
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,400
Don't you... All the...

372
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,700
My dad...

373
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,600
They'll be standin' in lines

374
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,000
For those old
honky-tonk monkeyshines

375
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,900
Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh

376
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,200
Don't you know everyone...

377
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,500
Make 'em laugh

378
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
Make 'em laugh

379
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,500
Make 'em laugh

380
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,000
Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh

381
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,600
Make 'em laugh

382
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,400
- Ready, Don?
- All set, Roscoe.

383
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Here we go again. I think we have
another smash on our hands.

384
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,900
- I hope so.
- You're darn tootin' we have.

385
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
- Where's Lina?
- Here she is.

386
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,700
Well, well, here comes
our lovely leading lady now.

387
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,200
This wig weighs a ton.
What dope would wear a thing like this?

388
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:17,100
- Everybody used to wear them.
- Then everybody was a dope.
Honey, you look beautiful.

389
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,100
Yes, you look great.
Let's get into the set.

390
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,100
Thanks, Joe.
I looked for you the other night
at Wally Ray's party.

391
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,300
- Where were you?
- I've been busy.

392
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,500
And I know what you've been busy at...
lookin' for that girl.

393
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,100
- As a matter of fact, yes.
- Why?

394
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,700
- I've been worried about her.
- You should've been worried about me.

395
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,800
After all, I'm the one who got
the whipped cream in the kisser.

396
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,400
But you didn't lose your job,
and she did.

397
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,500
You're darn tootin' she did.
I arranged it.

398
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,900
What?

399
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,500
They weren't gonna fire her, so I called
them and told them they'd better.

400
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,300
Okay, Don, remember.

401
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,200
You're madly in love with her, and you
must overcome her shyness and timidity.

402
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,800
Cosmo, mood music.

403
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,500
Roll 'em!

404
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,400
Okay, Don.
Now enter.

405
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,800
You see her.
Run to her!

406
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,500
Why, you rattlesnake, you.
You got that poor kid fired.

407
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,900
That's not all I'm gonna do
if I ever get my hands on her.

408
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,300
I never heard of anything so low.

409
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,100
Fine. Looks great.

410
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,600
What did you do it for?

411
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,800
'Cause you liked her.
I could tell.

412
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,500
So that's it.

413
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,000
Believe me, I don't like her
half as much as I hate you.

414
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,800
You reptile.

415
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Sticks and stones may break my bones...

416
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,400
I'd like to break
every bone in your body.
You and who else, you big lummox?

417
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,100
Kiss her, Don.

418
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,900
That's it! More!

419
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,900
Great! Cut!

420
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,700
You couldn't kiss me like that
and not mean it just a teensy bit.

421
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,100
Meet the greatest actor in the world.
I'd rather kiss a tarantula!

422
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
- You don't mean that.
- I don't...

423
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,700
Joe, bring me a tarantula.
Listen, Lina...

424
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,700
Stop that chitchat, you lovebirds.
Let's get another take.
Hold it!

425
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,700
- Hold it!
- Hello, Mr. Simpson.

426
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,900
- We're really rolling.
- Stop rolling at once.

427
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,100
All right, everybody, save it!
Tell them to go home.
We're shutting down for a few weeks.

428
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,400
- What?
- Don't just stand there, tell them!

429
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,100
Everybody go home until further notice!
What is this?

430
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,600
- What's the matter, R.F.?
- 'The Jazz Singer,' that's what.

431
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,200
My darlin' little mammy
down in Alabamy

432
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,800
This is no joke, Cosmo.
The public is screaming for more.

433
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,500
- More what?
- Talking pictures!

434
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,700
- It's just a freak.
- We should have such a freak here.

435
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,000
I told you talking pictures were
a menace, but no one would listen to me.

436
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Don, we're going to put
our best feet forward.

437
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,800
We're going to make 'The Dueling
Cavalier' into a talking picture.

438
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,900
That means I'm out of a job. I can start
suffering and write that symphony.

439
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,900
We're putting you in as
head of the new music department.

440
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Thanks, R.F.! I can stop suffering
and write that symphony.

441
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,300
Wait a second, Mr. Simpson.
I think you should wait...

442
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,500
Every studio
is jumping on the bandwagon.

443
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,300
Theaters are putting in sound equipment.
We don't want to be left out.

444
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,700
- We know nothing about this gadget.
- What do you have to know?

445
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,500
You do what you always did.
You just add talking to it.

446
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,300
- Yeah?
- Believe me, it will be a sensation.

447
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,600
- Yeah?
- Believe me, it will be a sensation.
'Lamont And Lockwood: They Talk.'

448
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,800
Well, of course we talk.
Don't everybody?

449
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I got a feelin' you're foolin'
I got a feelin' you're havin' fun

450
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,000
I'll get the go-by when you are done
foolin' with me

451
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,600
It's a holiday, today's the wedding
of the painted doll

452
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:02,500
It's a jolly day
The news is spreading
Should I reveal exactly how I feel

453
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,700
Should I confess

454
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,100
Beautiful girl
You're a lovely picture

455
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,700
Beautiful girl
You're a gorgeous picture

456
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,300
Of all that lies
under the big blue skies

457
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,100
My heart cries

458
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,000
That girl on his right
looks familiar.
You're a dazzling eyeful

459
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,800
- I've featured her in nightclub shows.
- That's probably where I've seen her.

460
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,000
She'd be good in the part
of Zelda's kid sister.

461
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,700
- That's a good idea.
- Excuse me.

462
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,800
There may be blondes and brunettes

463
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,900
That are hard to resist

464
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,700
You surpass them like a queen

465
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,500
You've got those lips
that were meant to be kissed

466
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,400
And you're over sweet 16

467
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,200
Oh, beautiful girl
What a gorgeous creature

468
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,000
Beautiful girl
Let me call a preacher

469
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,000
What can I do

470
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,100
But give my heart to you

471
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:33,900
A beautiful girl
is like a great work of art.

472
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
She's stylish.

473
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,800
She's chic.

474
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,400
And she also is smart

475
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,200
For lounging in her boudoir...

476
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,100
this simple, plain pajama.

477
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,600
Her cloak is trimmed
with monkey fur...

478
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,100
to lend a dash of drama.

479
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,100
Anyone for tennis?

480
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,100
Well, this will make them cringe.

481
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:10,400
And you'll knock 'em dead at dinner...
if your gown just drips with fringe.

482
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,700
You simply can't be too modest...

483
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,300
at the beach or by the pool.

484
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,200
And in summertime it's organdy...

485
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,100
that'll keep you fresh and cool.

486
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:30,300
You'd never guess what loud applause...
this cunning hat receives.

487
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,500
And you'd never dream
the things that you could hide...

488
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,200
within these sleeves.

489
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,500
A string of pearls
with a suit of tweed.

490
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,000
It started quite a riot.

491
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,000
And if you must wear fox
to the opera...

492
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,900
Dame Fashion says, 'Dye it.'

493
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,800
Black is best when you're in court.

494
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,300
The judge will be impressed

495
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,900
But white is right
when you're a bride

496
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:09,100
And you want to be well-dressed

497
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,100
Beautiful girl

498
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,800
For you I've got a passion

499
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,600
Beautiful girl

500
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,500
You're my queen of fashion

501
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,800
I'm in a whirl

502
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,800
Over my beautiful

503
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,900
Girl

504
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,100
- That's stupendous!
- Thanks.

505
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,400
- Kathy, come here.
- This'll start a new trend in musicals.

506
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,700
Kathy, Mr. Simpson is thinking of
casting you as Zelda's kid sister.

507
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,100
That's wonderful, Mr. Simpson.

508
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,100
- That's Kathy Selden!
- Thanks anyway.

509
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,300
- Wait a minute.
- That's all right.

510
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Before Mr. Lockwood reminds you,
you might as well know...

511
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,700
I'm the girl who hit
Miss Lamont with a cake.

512
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,700
Believe me,
it was meant for Mr. Lockwood!

513
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,900
Good-bye, Sid.
I should have told you.

514
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,300
Wait a minute.
What's this about, R.F.?

515
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,800
We wanted to use her in Zelda's picture,
but if it made you and Lina unhappy...

516
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,800
I think it's wonderful.

517
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,100
- He's been looking for her for weeks.
- Are you speaking for Lina also?

518
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,400
R.F., the owner of the Coconut Grove
may do what Lina tells him to...

519
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,500
- but you're the head of this studio.
- Yes, I am.

520
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,500
She's hired. But don't let
Lina know she's on the lot.

521
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,000
- Take care of that, Phillips.
- Thank you!

522
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,900
I'm glad you turned up.
We've looked inside every cake in town.

523
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,700
Is it all right for you
to be seen with me?

524
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,600
You mean, lofty star
with humble player?

525
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,100
Not exactly, but for lunch, don't you
usually tear a pheasant with Lamont?

526
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,400
Look, Kathy, all that stuff about
Lina and me is sheer publicity.

527
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,300
Oh? It certainly seems
more than that.

528
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,000
From what I've read in the columns
and the fan magazines...

529
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,600
You read the fan magazines.

530
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,700
I pick them up in the beauty parlor
or the dentist's office...
just like anybody.

531
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,300
Honest?

532
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,700
- Well, I buy four or five a month.
- You buy four or five?

533
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,700
Anyway, to get back
to the main point...

534
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,700
you and Miss Lamont do achieve
an intimacy in all your pictures...

535
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,300
Did you say all my pictures?

536
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,900
I guess now that I think of it,
I've seen eight or nine of them.

537
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,100
Eight or nine. It seems to me
I remember someone saying...

538
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,100
'If you've seen one,
you've seen 'em all.'

539
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,500
I did say some awful things
that night, didn't I?

540
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,200
No. I deserved them.

541
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,300
Of course, I must admit
I was pretty much upset by them.

542
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,900
So upset that I haven't been able
to think of anything but you ever since.

543
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,800
Honest?

544
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,400
Honest.

545
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,000
Well, I've been pretty upset too.

546
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
Kathy, look.

547
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,200
Seeing you again,
now that I...

548
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,500
Kathy, I'm trying to say
something to you, but I...

549
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,200
I'm such a ham.

550
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,100
I guess I'm not able to
without the proper setting.

551
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,700
- What do you mean?
- Well...

552
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,600
Come here.

553
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,900
This is the proper setting.

554
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:47,100
Why, it's just an empty stage.
At first glance, yes.
But wait a second.

555
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,400
A beautiful sunset.

556
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,300
Mist from the distant mountains.

557
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,800
Colored lights in a garden.

558
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,700
Milady is standing on her balcony...

559
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,000
in a rose-trellised bower...

560
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,800
flooded with moonlight.

561
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,300
We add 500,000 kilowatts
of stardust...

562
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,900
a soft summer breeze...

563
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,600
and...

564
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,600
You sure look lovely
in the moonlight, Kathy.

565
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,500
Now that you have the proper setting,
can you say it?

566
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,700
I'll try.

567
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,000
Life was a song

568
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,400
You came along

569
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,900
I've laid awake
the whole night through

570
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,200
If I but dared

571
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,200
To think you cared

572
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:05,300
This is what I'd say to you

573
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:14,000
You were meant for me

574
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,200
And I was meant for you

575
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,700
Nature patterned you

576
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,000
And when she was done

577
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,400
You were all the sweet things

578
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,900
Rolled up in one

579
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:47,100
You're like a plaintive melody

580
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:56,700
That never lets me free

581
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,300
But I'm content

582
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:08,000
The angels must have sent you

583
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:12,900
And they meant you

584
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,400
Just for me

585
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,900
But I'm content

586
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:53,000
The angels must have sent you

587
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:59,500
And they meant you

588
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,100
Just for me

589
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,500
Now...

590
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,600
ta, te, ti, to, tu.

591
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,800
Ta, tay, tee, toe, too.

592
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:40,700
No, no, Miss Lamont.
Round tones, round tones.

593
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,300
Now let me hear you read your line.

594
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,500
And I can't stand 'im.

595
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,800
And I can't stand him.

596
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,100
And I can't stand 'im.

597
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,800
Can't.

598
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,900
Can't.

599
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,300
'Cahn't.'

600
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,900
'Can-t.'

601
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,200
Can't. Can't.

602
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:10,200
Very good. Now...
Around the rocks the rugged rascal ran.

603
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,500
- Around the rocks the rugged...
- No, rocks, rocks.

604
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,400
Around the rocks the rugged rascal ran.

605
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,300
- Shall I continue?
- Go ahead.
Don't mind me.

606
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,100
Sinful Caesar sipped his snifter...

607
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,300
seized his knees and sneezed.

608
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:32,000
- Sinful Caesar snipped his sifter...
- No, sipped his snifter.

609
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,600
- Sipped his snifter.
- Oh, thank you.

610
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:40,000
Sinful Caesar sipped his snifter,
seized his knees and sneezed.

611
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,100
- Marvelous.
- Wonderful.

612
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,000
Oh, here is a good one.

613
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,900
Chester chooses chestnuts,
cheddar cheese with chewy chives.

614
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:53,400
He chews them and he chooses them.
He chooses them and he chews them,
those chestnuts...

615
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,500
cheddar cheese and chives
in cheery, charming chunks.

616
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,700
- Wonderful! Do another one.
- Thank you.

617
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,300
Moses supposes his toeses are roses...

618
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,100
but Moses supposes erroneously.

619
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:13,700
Moses, he knowses
his toeses aren't roses...
as Moses supposes his toeses to be.

620
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,300
Moses supposes his toeses are roses...

621
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,800
but Moses supposes erroneously.

622
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,100
But Moses, he knowses
his toeses aren't roses...

623
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,900
as Moses supposes his toeses to be.

624
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,600
Moses supposes his toeses are roses...

625
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,100
but Moses supposes erroneously.

626
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,600
- A Mose is a Mose.
- A rose is a rose.
A toes is a toes.

627
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,400
Moses supposes his toeses are roses

628
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,200
But Moses supposes erroneously

629
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:50,000
For Moses, he knowses
his toeses aren't roses
As Moses supposes his toeses to be

630
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,700
- Moses
- He supposes his toeses are roses

631
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,100
- Moses
- But Moses supposes erroneously

632
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,100
- Eenie meenie minie Moses
- He knowses his toeses aren't roses

633
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,000
As Moses supposes his toeses to be

634
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,800
A rose is a rose is a rose
is a rose is

635
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,600
A rose is what Moses
supposes his toes is

636
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,300
Couldn't be a lily
or a taffy-daffy-dilly

637
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,400
It's gotta be a rose
'cause it rhymes with Mose

638
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,900
All right, here we go.

639
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
- Quiet!
- Quiet!

640
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,500
Roll 'em!

641
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,500
Oh, Pierre, you shouldn't...

642
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,100
She's gotta talk into the mike.
I can't pick it up.

643
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,800
Cut!

644
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,400
- What's the matter, Dexter?
- It's Lina.

645
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,900
Look, Lina, don't you remember?
I told you.

646
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,400
There's a microphone right there
in the bush.

647
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,600
- Yeah.
- You have to talk into it.

648
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,000
I was talking,
wasn't I, Miss Dinsmore?

649
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:04,500
Yes, my dear, but please remember:
round tones.

650
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,900
Pierre, you shouldn't have come.

651
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,500
Pierre, you shouldn't have come.

652
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,800
- Yes, that's much better.
- Hold it a second!

653
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,700
Now, Lina, look.

654
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,600
Here's the mike,
right here in the bush.

655
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,600
- Yeah.
- Now you talk towards it.

656
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,800
The sound goes
through the cable to the box.

657
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,600
A man records it
on a big record in wax.

658
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,500
But you have to talk
into the mike first...

659
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,100
in the bush!

660
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,100
Now try it again.
- Gee, this is dumb.
- She'll get it, Dexter.

661
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:45,100
Lina, don't worry. We're all
a little nervous the first day.
Everything's gonna be okay.

662
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,500
Roscoe, you know the scene where I say,
'Imperious Princess of the night'?

663
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,300
I don't like those lines there.
Is it okay if I say what I always do?

664
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,000
'I love you, I love you, I love you'?

665
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,500
Sure. Any way it's comfortable.

666
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,500
But into the bush!

667
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,600
Okay, again! Quiet!

668
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,100
- Quiet!
- Roll 'em!

669
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,800
...you shouldn't have...

670
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,500
...flirting with danger.
...surely find you out.

671
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,100
Cut! Lina, we're missing
every other word.

672
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,600
You've got to talk into the mike!

673
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,400
Well, I can't make love to a bush!

674
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,000
All right, all right.

675
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:33,000
We'll have to think
of something else.

676
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,600
What are you doing?

677
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,400
- You're being wired for sound.
- What?

678
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,300
Watch out for those dentalized
D's and T's and those flat A's.

679
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,600
Everybody's picking on me!

680
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:53,300
Okay, Lina,
now look at this flower. See?

681
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,800
The mike is in there.

682
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,400
That's it.

683
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,500
Now the sound will run from it...

684
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,400
through this wire onto the record.

685
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,700
It'll catch whatever you say.

686
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,300
Now, let's hear how it sounds, Lina.

687
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,100
Okay, quiet!

688
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,300
- Quiet!
- Roll 'em!

689
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,300
Oh, Pierre, you shouldn't have come.

690
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,100
You're flirting with danger.
They will surely...

691
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,900
- What's that noise?
- The mike's picking up her heartbeat.
Swell.

692
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,100
Cut!

693
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,600
That's right.
That should do it.

694
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:40,500
Now don't forget, Lina,
the mike is on your shoulder...

695
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,300
and whatever you say goes
through the wire onto the record.

696
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,600
- Now please, Lina, talk into the mike.
- Yeah.

697
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,200
Don't make any quick, jerky movements
or you might disconnect it.

698
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,600
Okay, let's go.
Quiet.

699
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,000
Quiet!

700
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,500
Roll 'em!

701
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,300
Pierre, you shouldn't have come.
You're flirting with danger.

702
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,300
What's this wire doing here?
It's dangerous.

703
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,100
You two shouldn't go
into the theater together.

704
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,200
Lina's probably waiting
right inside the door.

705
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,500
- How I wish...
- Don't worry.

706
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,400
I'll be leading the cheering section
in the balcony. Good luck.

707
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,600
What's that,
the thunderstorm outside?
It's those pearls, Mr. Simpson.

708
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:21,800
I am the noblest lady of the court,
second only to the queen...

709
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,100
yet I am the saddest
of the mortals in France.

710
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,800
What is the matter, my lady?

711
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,300
I'm so downhearted, Theresa.

712
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:35,500
My father has me betrothed
to the Baron de Landsfield...
and I can't stand 'im.

713
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,400
But he is such a catch.

714
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,100
All the ladies of the court wish
they were in your pretty shoes.

715
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,500
My heart belongs to another.

716
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,600
Pierre de Battaille.

717
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,600
Ever since I met him,
I can't get 'im outta my mind.

718
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,800
Sounds good and loud, huh?

719
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,100
Oh, Pierre, you shouldn't have...

720
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,500
You're flirting with danger.

721
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,300
They will surely...

722
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,300
...too valuable.
She never could remember
where the microphone was, boss.

723
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,200
'Tis Cupid himself
that called me here, and I...

724
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,900
smitten by his arrow...

725
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,300
The night is full of our enemies.

726
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:39,900
Hey, Lina, whatcha hittin' him with,
a blackjack?

727
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,100
I love you.

728
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,000
I love you.

729
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,200
I love you. I love you.
I love you. I love you.

730
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,800
Did somebody get paid
for writing that dialogue?

731
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,500
Sounds like a comedy inside.
- It's a Lockwood-Lamont talkie.
- What?

732
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,200
This is terrible.

733
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,500
What's that?

734
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,800
The sound.
It's out of synchronization!

735
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,300
- Tell them to fix it!
- Yes, sir.

736
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,000
What's this?

737
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,500
Yvonne, captured by Rouge Noir
of the Purple Terror?

738
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,300
Oh! Oh, my sword!

739
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,400
I must fly to her side.

740
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,600
Yvonne, Yvonne, my own!

741
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,100
Pierre will save me! Pierre!

742
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,300
Pierre is miles away, you wench!

743
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,700
No, no, no!

744
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,000
Yes, yes, yes!

745
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,800
No, no, no!

746
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,700
Yes, yes, yes!

747
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:01,100
No... no... no!

748
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,700
This is a scream.
This is a scream.

749
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:09,800
Give me pictures
like 'The Jazz Singer.'
I love you! I love you!

750
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,800
We're all ruined.

751
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,800
- You can't release this picture.
- We've got to.

752
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,600
We're booked to open in six weeks
all over the country.

753
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,800
But you're such big stars,
we might get by.

754
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,900
I never want to see
Lockwood and Lamont again.

755
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,900
- Wasn't that awful?
- This is the worst picture ever made.

756
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,400
I liked it.

757
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,200
Take a last look at it.

758
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,800
It'll be up for auction
in the morning.

759
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,500
You're out of your mind.
Besides, it's Saturday.

760
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,500
No bank's gonna foreclose
until Monday.

761
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:51,000
- It wasn't so bad.
- That's what I've been telling him.
There's no use kidding myself.

762
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:55,300
Once they release
'The Dueling Cavalier'...
Lockwood and Lamont are through.

763
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,000
The picture's a museum piece.
I'm a museum piece.

764
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Things went wrong with the sound. If you
straighten out the technical end...

765
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,500
It wasn't that. This is sweet
of both of you, but I...

766
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,700
Something happened
to me tonight. I...

767
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,300
Everything you ever said about me
is true.

768
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,700
I'm no actor.
I never was.

769
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,700
Just a lot of dumb show.
I know that now.

770
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,800
Well, at least
you're taking it lying down.

771
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:26,600
No kidding. Did you ever see anything
as idiotic as me on that screen tonight?

772
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:31,000
Yeah. How about Lina?
All right.
I ran her a close second.

773
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Maybe it was a photo finish.
Anyway, I'm through.

774
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,100
- You're not through!
- Of course not.

775
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,400
With your looks and figure, you could
drive an ice wagon or shine shoes.

776
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,900
- Block hats.
- Sell pencils.

777
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
- Dig ditches.
- Or go back into vaudeville.

778
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:48,700
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love
I could jump over the moon up above

779
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,300
Fit as a fiddle
and ready for love

780
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:55,900
Too bad I didn't do that in 'Dueling
Cavalier.' They might have liked it.

781
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,900
- Why don't you?
- What?

782
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,900
- Make a musical.
- Musical?
Sure. Make a musical.

783
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,200
The new Don Lockwood.
He yodels. He jumps about to music.

784
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,200
The only trouble is that after they
release 'Dueling Cavalier'...

785
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:12,300
nobody would come to see me jump off
the Woolworth Building into a damp rag.

786
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,100
Why don't you turn
'The Dueling Cavalier' into a musical?

787
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,200
- 'Dueling Cavalier'?
- Sure.

788
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,400
They've got six weeks
before it's released.

789
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:24,300
Add songs and dances,
trim the bad scenes, add new ones.
And you got it.

790
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,700
Hey, I think it'll work.

791
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:30,100
Of course!
It may be crazy,
but we're gonna do it.

792
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,800
'The Dueling Cavalier'
is now a musical.

793
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,300
- Hot dog!
- Hallelujah!

794
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:39,200
Fellas, I feel this is
my lucky day. March 23rd.

795
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,700
- No, your lucky day's the 24th.
- What do you mean?

796
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,800
It's 1:30. It's morning.

797
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,400
Yes, and what a lovely mornin'.
Yes, and what a lovely mornin'.

798
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:52,100
- Good mornin'
- Good mornin'

799
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,100
We've talked
the whole night through

800
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,800
- Good mornin'
- Good mornin' to you

801
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,300
Good mornin', good mornin'

802
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,800
It's great to stay up late
Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you

803
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:12,400
When the band began to play
the stars were shining bright

804
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:16,400
Now the milkman's on his way
It's too late to say good night

805
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,400
So good mornin', good mornin'

806
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:24,200
Sunbeams will soon smile through
Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you

807
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:28,700
And you and you and you
Good mornin', good mornin'

808
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,700
We've gabbed
the whole night through

809
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:33,100
Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you

810
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:35,100
Nothin' could be grander
than to be in Louisiana

811
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,400
In the morning
In the morning

812
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,700
It's great to stay up late

813
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:42,200
Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you

814
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:46,700
Might be just as zippy
if we was in Mississippi
When we left the movie show

815
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,800
The future wasn't bright

816
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:54,500
But came the dawn, the show goes on
and I don't wanna say good night
So say good mornin'

817
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,300
Good mornin'

818
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,000
Rainbows are shining through
Good mornin'

819
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,200
- Good mornin'
- Bonjour

820
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:04,600
Monsieur
- Buenos días
- Muchas frías

821
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,900
Buon giorno

822
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,800
Guten Morgen

823
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,400
Good mornin' to you

824
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,900
- ¡Olé!
- ¡Toro!

825
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,700
¡Toro! ¡Ah-ha!

826
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,200
Charleston!

827
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,100
Hey, we can't make this
a musical.

828
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,800
What do you mean?

829
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,500
She can't act, she can't sing
and she can't dance.

830
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,700
- A triple threat.
- Yeah.

831
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,200
What's so funny?
I'm sorry.
I was just thinking.

832
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:37,700
I liked her best when the sound
went off and she said...
'Yes, yes, yes!'

833
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,500
No, no, no!

834
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:47,000
Wait a minute.
I am just about to be brilliant.

835
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,000
Come here, Kathy.

836
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,500
Now sing. I said, 'Sing.'

837
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,700
- Good mornin'
- Good mornin'

838
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,000
- Keep your eyes on my face.
- We talked the whole night through

839
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:59,100
Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you

840
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,700
Watch my mouth.

841
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,500
Good mornin', good mornin'

842
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:07,900
It's great to stay up late
Good mornin', good mornin' to you

843
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,500
Well? Convincing?

844
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,300
Enchanting. What?

845
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:17,300
Don't you get it?
Use Kathy's voice.

846
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,700
Lina moves her mouth, and Kathy's voice
comes over singing and talking for her.

847
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:24,100
- That's wonderful.
- I couldn't let you do it.

848
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,100
- Why not?
- Because you wouldn't be seen.

849
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,500
- You'd be throwing away your own career.
- It has nothing to do with my career.

850
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,500
It's only for this one picture.

851
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:35,100
The important thing now
is to save 'The Dueling Cavalier'...
save Lockwood and Lamont.

852
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,800
All right, if it's only
for this one picture, but...

853
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,000
- Do you think it'll get by?
- Of course it will.

854
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,000
Sure, and it's simple
to work the numbers.

855
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,300
Just dance around Lina
and teach her how to take a bow.

856
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,800
All right, we'll spring it
on R.F. in the morning.
Don, you're a genius.

857
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,000
I'm glad you thought of it.

858
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,700
Good night, Kathy.
See you tomorrow.

859
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:12,300
Good night, Don.

860
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:16,400
Take care of that throat.
You're a big singing star now, remember?

861
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,800
This California dew is just
a little heavier than usual tonight.
Really?

862
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:26,600
From where I stand, the sun
is shining all over the place.

863
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:18,800
I'm singin' in the rain

864
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:22,100
Just singin' in the rain

865
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:25,700
What a glorious feelin'

866
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,300
I'm happy again

867
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,300
I'm laughin' at clouds

868
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,700
So dark up above

869
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,100
The sun's in my heart

870
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,400
And I'm ready for love

871
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:46,100
Let the stormy clouds chase

872
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,600
Everyone from the place

873
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,600
Come on with the rain

874
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:56,600
I've a smile on my face

875
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:00,200
I walk down the lane

876
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,800
With a happy refrain

877
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,800
Just singin'

878
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:09,200
Singin' in the rain

879
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,200
Dancin' in the rain

880
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,800
I'm happy again

881
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:37,700
I'm singin' and dancin'
in the rain

882
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,400
I'm dancin'

883
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,300
And singin'

884
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:37,800
In the rain

885
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,500
That's wonderful!
Now look.

886
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,800
We'll keep it secret until we're ready
to release, in case it doesn't come off.

887
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,600
But I'm worried about Lina.
She doesn't like Miss Selden.

888
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:08,500
- There might be fireworks.
- Lina won't even know she's on the lot.

889
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:12,400
Okay. Boys, this is great.
'The Dueling Cavalier' can be saved.

890
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,900
Now, let's see.
'The Dueling Cavalier' with music.

891
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,300
The title's not right.

892
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,700
We need a musical title. Cosmo?

893
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
'The Dueling Mammy.'

894
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:35,200
I've got it.

895
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:43,300
- 'The Dancing Cavalier.'
- That's it. 'The Dancing Cavalier.'

896
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,300
Cosmo, remind me to make you
a scriptwriter.

897
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,100
- Thanks, R.F. Have a cigar.
- Thanks.

898
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,800
Now what about the story?

899
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,200
We need modern musical numbers.

900
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,200
How's this? We throw
a modern section into the picture.

901
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:05,700
The hero's a young hoofer
in a Broadway show.
He sings and dances.

902
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,500
One night backstage, he's reading
'A Tale of Two Cities'...

903
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,500
and a sandbag falls
and hits him on the head...

904
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,500
and he dreams he's back
during the French Revolution.

905
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,000
This way we get in the modern
dancing numbers... Charleston.

906
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:17,400
But in the dream part,
we can still use the costume stuff.

907
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:20,800
Sensational! Cosmo,
remind me to give you a raise.

908
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,800
Gimme a raise.

909
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:36,300
He holds her in his arms

910
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,700
Would you

911
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,200
Would you

912
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:45,400
He tells her of her charms

913
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,500
Would you

914
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,900
Would you

915
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
They met as you and I

916
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,900
And they were only friends

917
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,700
But before

918
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:09,300
The story ends

919
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:14,000
He'll kiss her with a sigh

920
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,500
Would you

921
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,300
Would you

922
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,600
And if the girl were I

923
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,500
Would you

924
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,500
Would you

925
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:30,800
And would you dare to say

926
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:36,700
Let's do the same as they

927
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,800
I would

928
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:43,800
Would you

929
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:51,000
And would you dare to say

930
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:56,400
Let's do the same as they

931
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:02,800
I would

932
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:08,800
Would you

933
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,000
Perfect.
That Selden girl is great.

934
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,500
Once the picture is released,
I'll give her a big buildup.

935
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,600
- Swell!
- How much is there left to do?

936
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,600
- One scene and a number.
- What number?

937
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:25,600
It's new. It's for
the modern part of the picture.
It's called 'Broadway Melody.'

938
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,600
It's the story of a young hoofer
who comes to New York.

939
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:33,400
First, we set the stage
with a song.
It goes like this.

940
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:38,800
It goes like this.
Don't bring a frown
to Old Broadway

941
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:43,900
Ah, you gotta clown on Broadway

942
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,000
Your troubles there

943
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:48,000
They're out of style

944
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:53,400
For Broadway
always wears a smile

945
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,600
A million lights

946
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:58,000
They flicker there

947
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,700
A million hearts
beat quicker there

948
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:07,800
No skies of gray
on that Great White Way

949
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:11,800
That's the Broadway

950
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:17,300
Melo-dy

951
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,300
Gotta dance

952
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:23,900
Gotta dance

953
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,700
Gotta dance

954
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,600
Shh!

955
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,100
Gotta dance

956
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,400
Gotta dance

957
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:08,900
Gotta dance
Gotta dance

958
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,900
Broadway rhythm
It's got me

959
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,600
Everybody dance

960
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,600
Broadway rhythm
It's got me

961
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:22,700
Everybody dance

962
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,400
Out on that gay White Way
In each merry cafe

963
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,400
Orchestras play
Takin' your breath away

964
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:33,000
Broadway rhythm, it's got me

965
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:36,500
Everybody sing and dance

966
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,800
That Broadway rhythm

967
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:49,500
That Broadway rhythm

968
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,900
When I hear that happy beat

969
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,200
Feel like dancin' down the street

970
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,900
That Broadway rhythm
Writhing, beating

971
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,300
Rhythm

972
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,800
Gotta dance

973
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,900
Gotta dance

974
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,400
Gotta dance

975
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,800
Gotta dance

976
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:55,700
When I hear that happy beat

977
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,400
Feel like dancin' down the street

978
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:11,300
When I hear that happy beat

979
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,800
Feel like dancin' down the street

980
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,300
When I hear that happy beat

981
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:30,000
Feel like dancing down the street

982
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,300
Gotta dance

983
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,200
Gotta dance

984
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,600
Gotta dance

985
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:00,600
Gotta dance
Gotta dance

986
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:34,700
That's the Broadway

987
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:40,700
Melo-dy

988
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,900
That's the idea of the number.
What do you think of it?

989
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:51,000
That's the idea of the number.
What do you think of it?

990
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:54,100
I can't quite visualize it.
I'll have to see it on film first.

991
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,400
- On film it'll be better yet.
- Get goin', fellas.

992
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:59,600
You've got to have that Selden girl
rerecord all of Lina's dialogue.

993
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:04,000
- It's all set up.
- And remember:
Don't let Lina know about it.

994
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:07,700
All set in there?
All set in there?

995
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,800
Nothing can keep us apart.

996
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:17,500
Our love will last
'til the stars turn cold.

997
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,900
All right, Kathy. Go ahead.

998
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,800
Nothing can keep us apart.

999
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:27,500
Our love will last
'til the stars turn cold.

1000
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,700
That's great. Perfect. Cut.

1001
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,500
'Til the stars turn cold.

1002
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,800
Oh, Kathy, I love you.

1003
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:42,700
I can't wait
'til this picture's finished.

1004
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:46,200
No more secrecy.
I'm gonna let Lina and everyone know.

1005
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:49,000
Your fans will be
bitterly disappointed.

1006
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,400
From now on, there's only one fan
I'm worrying about.

1007
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:58,400
There! What did I
tell you, Lina?

1008
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,600
Thanks, Zelda.
You're a real pal.

1009
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,000
I want that girl
off the lot at once.

1010
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,600
She ain't gonna be my voice.
Zelda told me everything.

1011
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:09,800
- Thanks, Zelda. You're a real pal.
- Any time, Don.

1012
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:14,100
- Look, Miss Lamont. Don and I...
- Don? Don't you dare call him Don!

1013
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,600
I was calling him Don
before you were born!

1014
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:19,400
I mean... I mean...
You were kissing him!

1015
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:23,000
I was kissing her!
I happen to be in love with her.

1016
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:26,800
That's ridiculous. Everybody knows
you're in love with me.

1017
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:31,500
Look, Lina.
Try and understand this.

1018
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,500
I'm going to marry her.

1019
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,300
Silly boy.
She ain't the marrying kind.

1020
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:39,400
She's just a flirt trying
to get ahead by using you.

1021
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:44,000
I'll put a stop to that.
I'm gonna go see R.F. right now!

1022
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:46,200
You're a little late.
The picture's already finished.

1023
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:48,300
If she weren't in the picture,
you would be finished too.

1024
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,500
As far as I can see,
she's the only one who's finished.

1025
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,900
- Who will ever hear of her?
- Everybody.

1026
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,200
Why do you think Zelda's
in such a sweat?

1027
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:58,300
Because Kathy nearly stole
the picture from her.

1028
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,700
She's doing you a favor,
helping you in 'The Dancing Cavalier.'

1029
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:03,200
And she's getting
full screen credit for it too.

1030
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:07,600
You mean it's gonna say up on the screen
that I don't talk and sing for myself?

1031
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,800
Of course. What do you think?

1032
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:12,000
- They can't do that.
- It's already done.

1033
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:16,100
And there's a whole publicity campaign
being planned.
Publicity?

1034
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,300
They can't make a fool
outta Lina Lamont!

1035
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:21,300
They can't make a laughingstock
outta Lina Lamont!

1036
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:24,500
What do they think I am,
dumb or something?

1037
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:29,500
I make more money than...
than Calvin Coolidge...

1038
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:30,900
put together!

1039
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,700
'Monumental Pictures
wildly enthusiastic...

1040
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:39,800
over Lina's singing pipes
and dancing stems.'
I never said that.

1041
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:44,000
'Premiere tomorrow night to reveal
Lina Lamont big musical talent.'

1042
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:47,300
Boss, you can't pull a switch
like this on the publicity department.

1043
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:49,700
We were all prepared on the campaign
for Kathy Selden.

1044
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:51,800
Now you do this.
At least keep us informed.

1045
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:55,000
I don't know anything about this.
I had nothing to do with it.

1046
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:57,600
- What are we gonna do?
- Nothing.

1047
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,100
Absolutely nothing.

1048
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:06,900
You wouldn't want to call the papers and
say that Lina Lamont is a big fat liar.

1049
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,900
Lina, did you send
this stuff out?

1050
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,200
I gave an exclusive story
to every paper in town.

1051
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:14,700
You'll never get away with it.
Rod, call the papers back.

1052
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:19,000
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Don't tell me what to do!

1053
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:22,000
What do you think I am,
dumb or something?

1054
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,500
I had my lawyer
go over my contract.

1055
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:30,000
And I control my publicity,
not you.

1056
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,700
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1057
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:38,200
The studio's responsible for every word
printed about me.
If I don't like it, I can sue.

1058
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:39,500
What?

1059
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,900
I can sue.

1060
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:44,000
If you tell the papers
about Kathy Selden...

1061
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:49,000
it would be 'detrimental
and deleterious' to my career.

1062
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,900
I could sue you for the whole studio.

1063
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:58,000
- That's a lot of nonsense.
- Says so right here.

1064
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:00,400
Contract dated June 8, 1925...

1065
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,800
paragraph 34,
subdivision letter 'A':

1066
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:06,300
'The party of the first part'...
That's me.

1067
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,900
You win, Lina.

1068
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Take Kathy Selden's
credit off the screen.

1069
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:13,800
Go ahead. Let's just get
this premiere over with.

1070
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:15,500
Satisfied?

1071
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,600
Just one little thing more.

1072
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:22,600
You want me to change
the name of the studio...
to Lamont Pictures Incorporated?

1073
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:25,100
Oh, R.F., you're cute.

1074
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,100
I was just thinking...

1075
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:29,800
you've given this little girl
a part in Zelda's picture...

1076
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:32,500
and you're gonna give her
an even bigger one in the next?

1077
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:36,000
- So what?
- So, if she's done such a grand job...

1078
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:40,600
doubling for my voice, don't you think
she oughta go on doing just that...

1079
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:43,600
and nothing else?
You're crazy.

1080
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:46,500
I'm still more important
to the studio than she is.

1081
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,600
I wouldn't do that to her
in a million years.

1082
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:54,100
You'd be taking her career away from
her. People don't do things like that.
People?

1083
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,200
I ain't people.

1084
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:57,500
I'm a...

1085
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:03,700
'A shimmering, glowing star...

1086
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:06,000
in the cinema firmament.'

1087
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:08,800
It says so. Right there.

1088
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:26,200
Oh, Pierre.
Pierre, my darling.
At last I've found you.

1089
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:28,100
Oh, Pierre.
Pierre, you're hurt.

1090
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:31,600
Oh, Pierre.
Pierre, you're hurt.
Oh, speak to me.

1091
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:37,600
I'll kiss her with a sigh

1092
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:42,200
Would you, would you

1093
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:46,300
And if the girl were I

1094
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:51,000
Would you, would you

1095
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,200
Oh, Pierre, hold me
in your arms always.

1096
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:59,900
Lockwood's a sensation.
Yes, but Lamont. What a voice!
Isn't she marvelous!

1097
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:02,400
- It's going over wonderfully, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1098
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:06,400
Our love will last
'til the stars turn cold.

1099
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:12,400
And would you dare to say

1100
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:18,300
Let's do the same as they

1101
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:24,100
I would

1102
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:30,100
Would you

1103
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:54,700
- R.F., it's a real smash.
- Congratulations, kids.

1104
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,700
- We owe you a lot.
- Thanks, Mr. Simpson.

1105
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,800
- Kathy, we made it!
- Don, it's a miracle!
It's just great, Don.

1106
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:03,200
Lina, you were fabulous.
You sang as well as Kathy.

1107
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:07,100
Yeah, and I'm gonna
for a long time.

1108
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:11,800
- What do you mean by that?
- She's gonna go right on singing for me.

1109
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:13,300
Listen, Lina.

1110
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:16,100
I thought something was cooking
beneath those bleached curls of yours.

1111
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:18,600
Now get this!
Kathy has a career of her own.

1112
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:22,200
She only did this
for the one picture.
That's what you think.

1113
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:23,900
Come on!

1114
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,900
Lina's getting carried away,
isn't she, boss?

1115
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,200
- Yes, she is.
- Listen, you boa constrictor.

1116
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:31,100
Don't get any fancy ideas
about the future. Tell her.

1117
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:35,900
Never mind! Listen to that applause, and
wait 'til the money starts rolling in.

1118
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:39,900
You won't give all that up because
some nobody don't wanna be my voice.

1119
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,200
She's got something there.
It's a gold mine.

1120
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:46,000
Part of that choice is mine,
and I just won't do it.

1121
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,700
You got a five-year contract.
You'll do what R.F. says.

1122
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,500
Why don't you tell her off?

1123
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:54,800
I'm confused.
This thing is so big...

1124
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:57,900
- They're tearing the house apart.
- Take a curtain call.

1125
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,200
I once gave you a cigar.
Can I have it back?

1126
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:04,100
- Wait a minute...
- Listen to 'em! I'm an avalanche!
Selden, you're stuck!

1127
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:07,500
If this happens, you'll get yourself
a new boy. I won't stand for it!

1128
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:11,200
Who needs you? They'd come to see me
if I played opposite a monkey!

1129
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:15,500
Just a minute. Don's a smash too.
I'm still running the studio!

1130
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,200
I'm not so sure!

1131
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:20,600
You're the big Mr. Producer,
always running things, running me.

1132
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:24,500
From now on, as far
as I'm concerned, I'm running things.

1133
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:28,800
Lina Lamont Pictures Incorporated, huh?
- Yeah.
- You've gone too far.

1134
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:31,500
- Don, they're yelling for a speech.
- A speech.

1135
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,700
Yeah, everybody's always
making speeches for me.

1136
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:39,100
Tonight I'm gonna do
my own talking.
I'm gonna make the speech!

1137
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:42,300
- You can't do that!
- Wait a minute, Rod.

1138
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:46,200
This is Lina's big night,
and she's entitled to do the talking.

1139
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,400
- Right?
- Right.

1140
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:56,900
Ladies and gentlemen...

1141
01:37:56,900 --> 01:38:00,500
I can't tell you how thrilled we are
at your reception...

1142
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:04,800
for 'The Dancing Cavalier,'
our first musical picture together.

1143
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:09,300
If we bring a little joy
into your humdrum lives...

1144
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:13,800
it makes us feel as though our hard work
ain't been in vain for nothin'.

1145
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,200
Bless you all!

1146
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:21,000
She didn't sound that way
in the picture.
Cut the talk, Lina. Sing!

1147
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:29,600
I got an idea.

1148
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,900
What am I gonna do?

1149
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,100
We've got it. Rod, set up
a microphone back of that curtain.

1150
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:44,600
Kathy, come here. Kathy will
stand back there and sing for you.

1151
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:47,900
She'll be back of the curtain singing,
and I'll be out in front doing...

1152
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,700
like in the picture?
- That's right.
- What?

1153
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,700
You gotta do it.
This thing is too big.

1154
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,200
Of course she's got to do it.
She's got a contract.

1155
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:58,800
- Get over to that microphone.
- You heard him. Do it!

1156
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,000
I'll do it, Don...

1157
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:04,700
but I never want to see you again,
on or off the screen.

1158
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,300
Come on, Lina.

1159
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:12,700
What are you going to sing,
Miss Lamont?

1160
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:18,200
'Singing In The Rain.'

1161
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:20,700
'Singing In The Rain.'

1162
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:23,800
'Singing In The Rain.'
In what key?

1163
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:28,200
'A' flat.

1164
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,400
'A' flat.

1165
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:30,800
In 'A' flat.

1166
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,300
I'm singin' in the rain

1167
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:47,800
Just singin' in the rain

1168
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:50,300
What a glorious feelin'

1169
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,900
I'm happy again

1170
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:55,500
I'm laughin' at clouds

1171
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,100
So dark up above

1172
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:03,400
The sun's in my heart
and I'm ready for love

1173
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:05,700
Let the stormy clouds chase

1174
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:08,600
Everyone from the place

1175
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:10,800
Come on with the rain

1176
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:13,900
I've a smile on my face

1177
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,500
I'll walk down the lane

1178
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,100
With a happy refrain

1179
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:23,300
I'm singin'
Just singin' in the rain

1180
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:29,700
I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain

1181
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:32,400
What a glorious feelin'

1182
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,700
I'm happy again

1183
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:37,200
I'm laughin' at clouds

1184
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,900
So dark up above

1185
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,900
The sun's in my heart
and I'm ready for love

1186
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,300
Let the stormy clouds chase...

1187
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:52,800
Ladies and gentlemen,
stop that girl running up the aisle!

1188
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:55,800
That's the girl whose voice
you heard and loved tonight!

1189
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:59,000
She's the real star
of the picture. Kathy Selden!

1190
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:11,700
You are

1191
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:15,600
My lucky star

1192
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:20,500
I saw you

1193
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:23,400
From afar

1194
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,600
Two lovely eyes

1195
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:33,100
At me they were gleaming

1196
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:37,200
Beaming

1197
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:43,100
I was starstruck

1198
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:46,800
You're all

1199
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:51,700
My lucky charms

1200
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:55,900
I'm lucky

1201
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,700
In your arms

1202
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:05,000
You've opened heaven's portal

1203
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:10,900
Here on Earth
for this poor mortal

1204
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:16,300
You are

1205
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:21,100
My lucky

1206
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:27,200
Star
