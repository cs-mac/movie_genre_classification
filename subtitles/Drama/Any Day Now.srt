1
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:37,904
# In my arms I will keep
you safe and warm #

2
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,573
# Come to me #

3
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:44,617
# I will shelter you
from the storm #

4
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:48,279
# I'm not one to pretend #

5
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:52,655
# Why can't you understand #

6
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:55,695
# That I love you? #

7
00:01:55,762 --> 00:01:59,425
# And I love you #

8
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:02,866
# And I need you #

9
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:06,428
# And I want you #

10
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:09,964
# And I love you #

11
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:13,604
# And I love you #

12
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,877
# And I need you #

13
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,784
# And I want you #

14
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:24,381
# Come to me #

15
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,723
# Oh, baby #

16
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:49,177
# I'm a lonely man #

17
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:52,912
# Living in a world of dreams #

18
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:55,546
# I've got everything #

19
00:02:55,622 --> 00:03:00,719
# But the one thing
that I really need #

20
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:03,661
# Come to me #

21
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,359
# I'll give you all the
love you need #

22
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:14,966
# 'Cause I have love
just for you #

23
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,847
Did you see that gorgeous thing at the bar,
sitting all by his lonesome?

24
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:27,409
How could we not, what with you
flirting like a cheap whore?

25
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:29,853
Honey, I may be cheap.
I ain't no whore.

26
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:33,586
Now, now, Pinocchio. We know what
happens to little boys who tell lies.

27
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,821
- Ooh!
- Oh, please. Enough already.

28
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:38,160
Come in.

29
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:46,871
# What's his name?
What's his name? #

30
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:53,570
Well, hello.

31
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:03,656
Your first time?

32
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:06,157
Yeah.

33
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:08,456
Are you married?

34
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:10,792
Divorced.

35
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:20,635
When did you know?

36
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:29,575
In my first year of high school,
my father made me play football.

37
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:37,319
Coach told me to line up center,
bend over and grab the ball.

38
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:41,554
Donnie Walsh was the quarterback.

39
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:47,032
He- He walked up behind me,
put his hand on my ass for the snap.

40
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,159
I was in heaven.

41
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:54,265
It's honestly all been downhill
from then on.

42
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:59,873
Oh, shit.

43
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:02,414
Don't worry. Just roll down the window,
and let me do the talking.

44
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:07,843
You boys having some fun?

45
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:11,982
No, Officer. We're actually just talking
about playing high school football.

46
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:13,457
Yeah, right.

47
00:05:13,526 --> 00:05:17,394
No, really. And you look like you've
played with a few balls in your time.

48
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:20,656
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Show me your hands.

49
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:22,258
- Everything's cool, everything's cool!
- Why are you so angry?

50
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:24,326
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- I'm gonna count to three. One.

51
00:05:24,404 --> 00:05:27,168
- Big man with your big gun!
- Two.

52
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,798
Shut up and do what he says!
Put your hands up!

53
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,206
- Three!
- W-Wait!

54
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:31,903
You-You pull that trigger,
it's murder one.

55
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,973
I'm with the D.A.'s office.
Jury will convict you in five seconds.

56
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:40,417
You'll spend the next 50 years
in a jail cell with some guy...

57
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:43,012
that wants to play cops and robbers
with you every night.

58
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:48,091
I'm sure the D.A.'s office would love
to know about one of their own...

59
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:50,322
getting sucked off in a parking lot.

60
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:52,865
And I'm sure Internal Affairs would love
to hear about one of their own...

61
00:05:52,932 --> 00:05:55,924
drawing his weapon and threatening
two unarmed civilians.

62
00:05:57,904 --> 00:06:01,670
So let's just both forget about
this little misunderstanding.

63
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:04,166
What do you say?

64
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:13,014
Don't let me catch you
in this parking lot again.

65
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:14,576
Okay.

66
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:19,854
Are you crazy?

67
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:21,655
- It's not funny.
- Yes, it's so-

68
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,252
It's not funny!

69
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:25,388
"Drawing his weapon and threatening
two unarmed civilians."

70
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:28,992
Oh, my God.
I thought he was gonna kill us.

71
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:31,833
Oh, my God!
What is your name?

72
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:38,204
Paul Fleiger.
You?

73
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:40,473
Rudy Donatello. Nice to meet you.

74
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:42,481
Nice to meet you, Mr. Donatello.

75
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:44,710
What now?

76
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:46,581
He was kind of cute too.

77
00:06:55,862 --> 00:07:00,299
I'm just staying here till they,
uh, finish my place in Malibu.

78
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,129
- Uh-
- Okay.

79
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,199
Well, w-wait, wait.

80
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:14,906
Just- Here.

81
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:18,139
Give me a call.

82
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,480
Are you sure that's what you want?

83
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:30,591
Hmm.

84
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:15,735
Hey! What do you want?

85
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:17,276
You got a kid, right?

86
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:18,776
Yeah. What about him?

87
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:20,938
Yeah, yeah.
I figured this must be his.

88
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:24,341
- You should turn that down.
- What?

89
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:27,215
Loud music ain't good for kids.
It hurts their ears.

90
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:29,847
- Are you some expert on
parenting now? - No, but-

91
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:34,326
Then you know what? Mind your own business,
you cock-sucking motherfucker.

92
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:01,719
Yo!

93
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:05,019
Life of the party's here!

94
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:06,786
Come on!
Let's go!

95
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,807
You're six days late.

96
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:11,855
Twelve dollars?
What are you? A comedian?

97
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:15,520
Things have been a bit slow.
I'll-I'll get it to you by tomorrow, I promise.

98
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:19,588
- Well, tomorrow's not today!
- Tomorrow is not today.

99
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,658
What is this? Some sort of existential
philosophy we're getting now?

100
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:25,499
You don't have the money by tomorrow,
I'm locking you out!

101
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,676
You know, instead of bleeding me dry,
you could do something about the noise in there!

102
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:33,871
It's like this morning, noon and night!

103
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:36,677
Or at least ask her
to close the door!

104
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:37,909
Geez!

105
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:40,316
Lady, close your door!

106
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:45,953
Jesus!

107
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:53,031
Your mommy didn't come home
at all last night?

108
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:56,401
Oh. No?

109
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:01,333
No idea where she might be, huh?

110
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:08,336
Can you talk?

111
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:14,778
Oh, good.

112
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:16,344
What's your name?

113
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:18,415
Marco.

114
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:23,387
Hey, Marco.

115
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:25,760
I'm Rudy.

116
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:56,420
Paul Fleger's office.

117
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,555
Yeah, hello. I'd like to speak
to Paul Fleiger, please.

118
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:01,464
- Can I get your name, please?
- Rudy Donatello.

119
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,601
Rudy, my main man.
Can you give me some change?

120
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,230
- Not now, Larry.
- Give me some spare change, man.

121
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:08,967
Uh, can I tell Mr. Fleiger
what this is regarding?

122
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:12,170
Come on. Don't be a Nosy Nellie.
Just put Paul on the phone for me, please.

123
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:14,645
- I'll let him know you're on the line.
- I gotta get something to eat.

124
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:17,239
This is not a good time to be
hitting me up for money, believe me.

125
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:20,376
- Look, a quarter, a dime.
- Larry, don't get- Larry!

126
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:23,081
Jesus Christ, Larry!
This is not a good time, I said already!

127
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:25,954
Now beat it or I'll bust
your face in two!

128
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:27,856
- Oh, you crazy faggot!
- Get-

129
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:32,157
It's okay. It's okay.

130
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:34,890
Hello? Mr. Donatello?

131
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:36,434
Hello. Yeah, I'm here.

132
00:12:36,502 --> 00:12:39,596
- Yeah, I'm afrad I don't have Mr. Fleger.
- You don't have him?

133
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:42,300
What is that? Code talk for he's there,
but he don't wanna talk to me?

134
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,003
Would you like to leave
him a message?

135
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:48,343
No, I would not like to leave a message.
I would like to talk to him.

136
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:51,679
Look, if you'd like to leave him a message,
I'll be happy to pass it along for you.

137
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:54,777
Lady, are you deaf? I already said
I do not want to leave a message.

138
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,190
Give me your hand. Come on.

139
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:14,899
I'm looking for Paul Fleiger.
Do you know where he is? No?

140
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:18,671
Paul! Paul Fleiger! Pa-

141
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:20,473
- Hey! Ex-Excuse me.
- Oh.

142
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:22,537
- Mr. Fleiger's not in his office.
- Paul!

143
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:24,640
Mister, if you don't stop,
I'm gonna call the police.

144
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:27,515
- Go for it, sweet cheeks.
- It's all right, Monica.

145
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:31,079
I'll take care of this.
Come on in. It's all right.

146
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:34,149
It's-Thank you.

147
00:13:36,562 --> 00:13:38,689
What the hell are you doing,
barging in here like a lunatic?

148
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:41,631
If you answered your phone, I wouldn't
have to barge in here like a lunatic.

149
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:44,067
This is my job, Rudy.
This is where I work!

150
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:48,039
This kid lives in my building. Last night, his mom
left him alone, and she ain't been back since then.

151
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:50,632
- What do you want me to do about it?
- You're a lawyer.

152
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,736
I- I don't know. Do what lawyers do.
Give me some advice here.

153
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:55,303
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.

154
00:13:55,381 --> 00:13:58,782
- Call Family Services!
- So they can toss him in a foster home?

155
00:13:58,851 --> 00:14:01,547
Do you have any idea what they do
to kids in those places? Come on!

156
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:03,213
You wanted my advice.
That's my advice.

157
00:14:04,323 --> 00:14:07,815
A real Perry-fuckin'-Mason
you are. Come on, kid.

158
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:11,887
Shh. Shit!

159
00:14:12,598 --> 00:14:14,065
Rudy.

160
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:16,658
Wait!

161
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,362
Hey, Rudy.

162
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,041
Do you need some
money or anything?

163
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:32,440
Let me guess.

164
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:36,716
And in exchange for the money, I don't come
around to your office anymore? Hmm?

165
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:45,889
You should be so ashamed
of yourself right now.

166
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:19,159
- What's going on?
- That's him. That's the kid right there.

167
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:20,824
- Who are you?
- I'm the neighbor.

168
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,492
What's the kid doing with you?

169
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:24,433
I-I was looking after him
till his mommy comes back.

170
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:26,095
His mommy's not comin' back.
Come here, kid.

171
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:29,198
- If you need anything else, give me a call.
- I will. I think I got it from here.

172
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:31,937
- What the hell's going on?
- His mother got picked up by Vice last night.

173
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:34,411
Come on. We need to get you packed
and out of here.

174
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,539
You got a suitcase?
Where are your clothes?

175
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:39,050
Come on, come on.
Show me where your clothes are.

176
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:43,280
Are they in here?
Honey, where are your clothes?

177
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:46,286
- This is-This is it?
- Mm-hmm.

178
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:49,624
This is all you have?
You don't have a bag? Nothing.

179
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:51,287
Okay.

180
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:58,662
All right. Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

181
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:00,399
Let's go, let's go,
let's go!

182
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:02,304
Hey, hey! You don't got
to shove him like that.

183
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,172
- Sir, step aside, please.
- What is your name?

184
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:06,211
Sir, I'm gonna ask you
one last time to step aside.

185
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:08,679
I will not step aside until
I know your name, lady.

186
00:16:08,748 --> 00:16:12,514
My name is Miss Martinez,
Family Services. You have an issue?

187
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:16,043
- I have an issue, Miss Martinez. It's you.
- Here's a card. Why don't you give them a call?

188
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:17,714
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Come on.

189
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,691
I-I have friends in the- in the
D.A.'s office, Miss Martinez.

190
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,557
- You'll be hearing from me.
- Are we done?

191
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:25,324
We are done.

192
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:28,026
Marco!

193
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,091
Wait up.

194
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:39,478
All right, all right.
Come on, kid.

195
00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:07,762
# The show must go on #

196
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:15,672
# Hey, one monkey don't
stop no show #

197
00:18:15,741 --> 00:18:19,336
# If you don't want my love #

198
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:21,802
# You're free to go #

199
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:25,874
# You can go, you can go,
you can go #

200
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:28,553
# Life s a play #

201
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:30,384
# We play different parts #

202
00:18:33,392 --> 00:18:39,888
# But to be a star in love,
you've got to feel it in your heart #

203
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:47,401
# You've been acting strange
You don't love me with soul #

204
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:55,913
# Well, there's lots of other guys
who'd love to play your role #

205
00:18:58,284 --> 00:19:02,220
# If you don't want to be
my leading man #

206
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:06,088
# Get out of my life
and let me live again #

207
00:19:06,158 --> 00:19:07,648
- # You can go, you can go #
- # Ah #

208
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:10,160
- # The show must go on #
- # Oh... Oh #

209
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:14,824
# Hey, hey, one monkey #

210
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:23,206
Don't you think we should have
this discussion in private?

211
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:26,335
No. Anything you have to say to me,
you can say in front of them.

212
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:34,082
I'm sorry.

213
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:48,160
I'm from Walla Walla,
Washington.

214
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:51,635
Walla Walla, Washington.
Very fun to say.

215
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:56,266
And when I graduated college,
I took over the family insurance business.

216
00:19:56,342 --> 00:20:00,711
I married my sweetheart,
and everything was perfect, except-

217
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:03,942
Let me guess. Selling insurance
bored you to death...

218
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:07,417
and you secretly longed to meet
the drag queen of your dreams.

219
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:11,384
Oh, it's the oldest
story in the book.

220
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:14,017
Boy meets girl, boy loses girl...

221
00:20:14,093 --> 00:20:18,655
boy kicks open the closet door
and finally meets Mr. Right.

222
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:21,723
I don't know.

223
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:29,738
Anyway, I got a divorce...

224
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:32,777
and, uh, loaded my
suitcase into the car...

225
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:35,336
and I moved here to study law
and change the world.

226
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:38,542
How's that world changing going?

227
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:44,055
Honestly, when I got this job,
I thought I'd make a difference, you know?

228
00:20:44,123 --> 00:20:48,617
I-I thought- I-I- I thought
I'd fight the good fight...

229
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:51,424
protect the innocent
and prosecute the guilty.

230
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:57,765
Uh, I'm just babbling now.
Tell me about you.

231
00:20:57,836 --> 00:21:00,327
- You don't want to know about me.
- Yes, I do.

232
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:03,500
No, well-
No, there's really nothing to it.

233
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:06,568
- I don't believe that.
- Okay!

234
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:09,546
- Do you really wanna know
about me? - I do.

235
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:13,447
- Georgie, give me the blues in "F."
- What are you doing?

236
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,919
You just sit here and look pretty.

237
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:26,330
# Well, I was born across the country
in a place they call Queens #

238
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:30,801
# But I left my home behind me
way back in my teens #

239
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:34,066
# Now I live in the
so-called paradise #

240
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:37,575
# Where they spray
their grass green #

241
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,374
# Ain't got much in the
way of possessions #

242
00:21:42,448 --> 00:21:44,473
# I ain't got much dough #

243
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:48,316
# I work in this bar to pay my rent
Keep the wolf from the door #

244
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:51,584
# There are better things in life
than money #

245
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:54,820
# But I still would
like some more #

246
00:21:57,096 --> 00:21:59,690
# So, you want to know
about me, baby #

247
00:21:59,765 --> 00:22:01,323
# Well, I'm here for you #

248
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,369
# I've got exes and baggage
and hang-ups and shit #

249
00:22:04,436 --> 00:22:05,903
# And so do you #

250
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:08,462
# We could stay in this bar
all night talkin' #

251
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,136
# Or go to your car
for Round 2 #

252
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,246
Boy, you've got an amazing voice.

253
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:26,052
Yeah, this lip-synch thing,
it's just a cover.

254
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:29,026
What I really want to
be is Bette Midler.

255
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:31,961
- You should do it.
- What?

256
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:36,229
Sing. Do your own stuff.
I don't know, make a demo.

257
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:42,066
Making a demo takes time and money,
both of which are in short supply these days.

258
00:22:42,141 --> 00:22:43,631
What the hell?

259
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,235
- What?
- Stop the car.

260
00:22:49,915 --> 00:22:51,849
Shit.

261
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:54,613
Marco! Hey.

262
00:22:58,424 --> 00:23:00,722
How- How did you get
all the way over here?

263
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,620
I walked.

264
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:06,591
You walked?
Where are you going?

265
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:08,830
Home.

266
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:13,166
Home, like, to your mommy's place?

267
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:17,065
You're going the wrong way.

268
00:23:19,478 --> 00:23:22,038
Come on.

269
00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:32,089
He's not a stray dog, you know?
You can't just keep him.

270
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:36,225
I'm not gonna keep him.

271
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:37,990
I'm just gonna-

272
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:42,124
I don't know.

273
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:47,633
Once they find out where he is,
Family Services is gonna come take him.

274
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:54,044
Then we'll hit the road,
me and Marco, like fugitives...

275
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:55,876
always one step ahead of the law.

276
00:23:55,948 --> 00:23:58,007
I can already see my outfit.

277
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:01,849
- Houndstooth suit, black overcoat
and a gray fedora. - Shut up.

278
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,115
I will look fabulous.

279
00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:11,719
What?

280
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:14,356
You're remarkable.

281
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,392
- Oh, stop with the compliments
already. - I'm sorry.

282
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,496
Oh, I'm kidding.

283
00:24:21,573 --> 00:24:24,872
Don't stop.

284
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:27,411
Tell me all the ways
I'm remarkable.

285
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:32,809
It's like nothing scares you.

286
00:24:34,853 --> 00:24:37,413
Yeah.

287
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:39,184
Well, that's a front.

288
00:24:42,961 --> 00:24:45,361
I'm actually terrified of wearing
white after Labor Day.

289
00:24:53,806 --> 00:24:58,607
# If only you believe like
I believe, baby #

290
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:07,576
Good morning.

291
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:13,480
- Oh, what time is it?
- 8:30.

292
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,891
Oh, shit!

293
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:19,624
Have you got time for
breakfast before you go?

294
00:25:19,698 --> 00:25:22,258
No. I'm already late.

295
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:25,963
- How about lunch?
- No, I have plans.

296
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:30,634
- Dinner?
- Look, I'm really, really late.

297
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:33,803
Uh, just give me your number,
and I'll call you later.

298
00:25:34,947 --> 00:25:38,542
Uh, yeah, right. That's the thing.
I- I don't have a phone.

299
00:25:38,617 --> 00:25:41,108
Uh, well, call me at
the office, okay?

300
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:42,983
Will you take my call this time?

301
00:25:59,137 --> 00:26:00,627
Ex-Excuse me.

302
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:04,965
I'm hungry.

303
00:26:06,345 --> 00:26:08,779
Oh.

304
00:26:08,847 --> 00:26:11,179
Then let's get you some food,
young man.

305
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,311
So, um, what do you eat
for breakfast?

306
00:26:15,387 --> 00:26:16,649
Doughnuts.

307
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:24,621
Doughnuts are poison. They make you fat
and give you pimples, okay?

308
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:33,363
Um, let's see. Oh.

309
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:34,928
Do you like peanut butter?

310
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:42,142
Carrots?

311
00:26:42,214 --> 00:26:44,978
Cheese. Ooh!

312
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:49,544
Cheese and... crackers.

313
00:26:50,555 --> 00:26:53,353
There we are.

314
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:57,122
Cheese and crackers.
Breakfast of champions.

315
00:27:02,134 --> 00:27:03,863
It's what they eat in France.

316
00:27:08,707 --> 00:27:11,835
Hmm.

317
00:27:23,322 --> 00:27:25,813
- Pay up or get out.
- I got it. I got it.

318
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:39,061
- What's he doing here?
- He's just dropped by for breakfast.

319
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:41,002
There. It's all there.
Do you want to count it?

320
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:42,836
- Do Family Services people know he's here?
- No, they do not.

321
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:45,103
And I'd prefer to keep it that way.
Thank you.

322
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,575
Okay, young man.

323
00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:54,244
We've gotta get a move on. You eat
your breakfast, and I will put my face on.

324
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:02,920
Hey, sport.

325
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:04,155
Hey.

326
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:08,427
I heard you had some... interesting
visitors in your office yesterday.

327
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,663
Yeah. My cousin.

328
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:14,433
He can be a little
high-strung.

329
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,570
- Cousin, huh?
- Yeah, on my mother's side.

330
00:28:17,642 --> 00:28:20,668
He was upset about a custody issue.

331
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:23,806
I thought you told me all your family
lived in Washington.

332
00:28:23,882 --> 00:28:25,611
They do.

333
00:28:25,684 --> 00:28:27,675
But your cousin lives here, huh?

334
00:28:29,654 --> 00:28:30,985
Are you deposing me?

335
00:28:31,056 --> 00:28:34,617
Relax, sport.
I'm just making conversation.

336
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:36,923
Uh, Mr. Fleiger-
Hi, Mr. Wilson.

337
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:38,053
Yes, Monica?

338
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,496
Uh, that guy, Mr. Donatello,
is on the phone.

339
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:43,259
Thank you.

340
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:45,633
Um, I was about to go
and get some lunch...

341
00:28:45,704 --> 00:28:48,229
and I was wondering if maybe you
wanted me to get you something...

342
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:50,672
or if you wanted to
come with me?

343
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:53,734
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.
I'm just gonna work through lunch.

344
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:56,670
Okay. Cool.

345
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,813
You dirty dog.

346
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:02,175
What?

347
00:29:02,254 --> 00:29:05,451
You didn't tell me you were
gettin' down with that.

348
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:09,451
I'm not gettin' down with that.

349
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:14,124
Relax, sport.
Your secret's safe with me.

350
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,190
Oh.

351
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:27,375
We got a problem.

352
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:28,936
Why?

353
00:29:29,014 --> 00:29:32,950
The manager of my building saw me with Marco
this morning, and I think he called the cops.

354
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:34,883
Wow.

355
00:29:34,953 --> 00:29:37,319
Just stay away from the building
until we get this all sorted out.

356
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:41,348
Me and Marco,
fugitives from the law.

357
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:43,621
I don't know about that.

358
00:29:43,695 --> 00:29:46,630
I've been doing some research,
and I found out a couple interesting things.

359
00:29:46,698 --> 00:29:49,633
- Like what?
- Let's talk about it in person.

360
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:51,191
Do you want to have
dinner tonight?

361
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:54,363
- My place?
- I thought you'd never ask.

362
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:58,273
1254 Havenhurst, Apartment 3.

363
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:07,179
- Say 6:00?
- I will be there with bells on.

364
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:11,279
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye. Bye-bye.

365
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:20,158
That man does not know it yet,
but he's desperately in love with me.

366
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:28,904
- How's it taste?
- Mmm. It's delicious.

367
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:32,307
It's my mom's world famous
lasagna recipe.

368
00:30:40,118 --> 00:30:41,642
You don't like your own food?

369
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:48,258
What do you like?

370
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:54,765
- Doughnuts.
- Doughnuts. Wow.

371
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,460
This just might be your lucky day.

372
00:30:57,502 --> 00:31:02,132
Oh, doughnuts for dinner
ain't healthy, Paul.

373
00:31:02,207 --> 00:31:04,937
One doughnut every once in a while
never hurt anyone.

374
00:31:08,547 --> 00:31:13,075
You like chocolate? Hmm?

375
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:28,594
Are you just gonna look at 'em,
or are you gonna eat 'em?

376
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:39,337
Thank you.

377
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:41,538
You're very welcome, young man.

378
00:31:53,925 --> 00:31:55,916
There.

379
00:31:57,963 --> 00:31:59,988
Is my mommy coming back?

380
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,124
No.

381
00:32:06,137 --> 00:32:08,128
Am I gonna stay with you?

382
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:13,871
I don't know.

383
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:21,812
Will you-Will you tell me a story?

384
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:26,349
Sure. Um-

385
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:32,529
There ain't no books here.

386
00:32:32,597 --> 00:32:34,155
You want me to make one up?

387
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:35,597
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

388
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:39,198
I like happy ending.

389
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:42,403
Mmm. Don't we all, sweetheart?

390
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:53,173
Okay. Once upon a time, um...

391
00:32:54,552 --> 00:32:59,114
there lived a boy whose magic
was known throughout the land.

392
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:05,788
Um-And he lived a very happy life
with his mommy and his daddy...

393
00:33:05,864 --> 00:33:09,459
and his grumpy little sister,
Lulabell.

394
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:11,468
What's his-
What's his name?

395
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:13,231
Who?

396
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:16,637
The boy with magic.

397
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:21,577
Well, his name was Marco,
of course.

398
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:35,082
You're gonna try and keep him,
aren't ya?

399
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:38,919
Yes, I am.

400
00:33:40,265 --> 00:33:42,859
You know it's not gonna be easy.

401
00:33:44,202 --> 00:33:47,035
Well, I should just toss him aside
because it's not gonna be easy?

402
00:33:49,774 --> 00:33:51,708
Marco didn't ask to
be born to a junkie.

403
00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:54,370
He didn't ask to be... different.

404
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:57,711
He didn't... ask for none of this.

405
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:02,714
And I just don't see why
he should be punished anymore...

406
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:07,622
for stuff that ain't his fault,
you know?

407
00:34:11,296 --> 00:34:13,662
Okay.

408
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:18,564
"Okay"? What does "okay" mean?

409
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:22,265
It means there's only one way
to legally do this.

410
00:34:36,955 --> 00:34:38,752
What the hell are you doing here?

411
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:44,523
After you were arrested,
they took Marco to a foster home, and, uh-

412
00:34:44,596 --> 00:34:48,828
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's okay.

413
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,869
- He's okay now. He's with us.
- That's good.

414
00:34:51,936 --> 00:34:55,804
You understand that unless Marco has an
assigned advocate while you're incarcerated...

415
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:57,501
he becomes a ward of the state?

416
00:34:57,575 --> 00:35:00,305
Who the hell are you?

417
00:35:00,378 --> 00:35:03,313
I'm his lawyer and his friend.

418
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:06,612
His "friend." Hmm.

419
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:10,884
Is that what you people
are calling it these days?

420
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:13,849
We have some legal papers
we'd like you to sign.

421
00:35:13,925 --> 00:35:15,586
And what do they say?

422
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,596
That Rudy shall be granted temporary
emergency custody of the minor child...

423
00:35:19,664 --> 00:35:22,531
until such time as your
incarceration terminates...

424
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,591
and you petition for
reunification.

425
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:27,263
Which means what in
normal-person talk?

426
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:31,166
That Rudy'll take care of Marco
while you're locked up.

427
00:35:39,818 --> 00:35:41,718
What's it gonna cost me?

428
00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:45,286
Nothing.

429
00:35:45,356 --> 00:35:46,846
Nothing?

430
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:52,721
You're gonna take care
of my kid for nothing?

431
00:35:52,797 --> 00:35:56,130
Not just me, honey. Mr. Lawyer
here is offering to help too.

432
00:35:56,201 --> 00:36:00,433
Like I said,
me and Rudy are friends.

433
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:13,407
I have to talk with you about
something before the hearing.

434
00:36:13,485 --> 00:36:14,474
What?

435
00:36:14,552 --> 00:36:16,543
There's no way the judge
is gonna grant you custody...

436
00:36:16,621 --> 00:36:18,680
with you living in the
apartment you're in.

437
00:36:18,756 --> 00:36:21,816
Hey, I know it's not the Taj Mahal,
but, trust me, I've lived in worse places.

438
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:23,724
I know. It's just-

439
00:36:23,795 --> 00:36:27,561
The court is gonna require that Marco have
a safe environment and his own bedroom.

440
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:32,798
What?

441
00:36:32,871 --> 00:36:37,069
If it's okay with you, I'd like to tell the judge
that you and Marco live with me.

442
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,410
Are you asking me to
move in with you?

443
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:45,745
No, no. J -Just to fulfill
the legal requirements.

444
00:36:45,817 --> 00:36:49,412
Yes, you are. You are.
You're asking me to move in with you.

445
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:52,854
There's no other way you're
gonna get custody, Rudy.

446
00:36:52,924 --> 00:36:55,620
- And I have an extra bedroom, so-
- The answer is yes.

447
00:36:56,828 --> 00:36:57,852
Yes?

448
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,861
Yes.

449
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:07,094
Okay. That's good.

450
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:09,935
Okay. That is good. Yeah.

451
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:14,008
Just don't mention our relationship.

452
00:37:16,347 --> 00:37:20,477
Your Honor, Marco's mother
is currently incarcerated.

453
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:22,042
There are no known relatives...

454
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,250
and she's signed emergency orders
granting Mr. Donatello temporary custody.

455
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:30,654
And is there an education
plan in place?

456
00:37:30,728 --> 00:37:32,719
Yes, Your Honor.

457
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:38,865
Mr. Donatello found a local school
that has a special education program.

458
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:40,461
And is there a Mrs. Donatello?

459
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:42,233
You're looking at her,
sweetheart.

460
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:45,475
What did you say?

461
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:49,872
What Mr. Donatello means is that
he is not currently married.

462
00:37:49,948 --> 00:37:53,975
But California state family code
143.089 clearly stipulates...

463
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:56,520
that marital status shall
have no factor...

464
00:37:56,588 --> 00:37:59,853
when temporary, emergency orders
have been signed by a custodial parent.

465
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:02,187
Relax, sparky.

466
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,720
It was just a simple question, not a cue for you
to recite your vast knowledge of code law.

467
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:10,763
Yes, Your Honor.

468
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:16,199
I see here that Mr. Donatello
lives with you. Is that correct?

469
00:38:16,274 --> 00:38:17,571
Yes, ma'am.

470
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,540
And what is the exact nature
of your relationship?

471
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:24,712
He's my cousin.

472
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,289
We know you love your doll, but...

473
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:38,755
we got you all those other toys, too,
that you could play with-

474
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:43,460
the robots and the teddy
bear and the pig.

475
00:38:47,238 --> 00:38:48,569
Is this my home?

476
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:56,410
Yeah. This-This is your home.

477
00:39:07,058 --> 00:39:08,548
Oh, sweetheart.

478
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:11,151
Are you all right?

479
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:13,993
- You okay?
- I'm so excited.

480
00:39:14,065 --> 00:39:15,555
Ah.

481
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:18,258
That's okay.

482
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:28,976
It's okay.

483
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:38,312
It's okay. It's good to
be excited, huh?

484
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:45,086
Huh. Here we go.
Follow the light.

485
00:39:45,163 --> 00:39:48,758
- Now say, "Aah."
- Aah.

486
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:53,835
The kid's in rough physical shape. It's pretty
clear he hasn't been treated well in years.

487
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:56,803
His eyesight's terrible.
He's gonna need glasses.

488
00:39:56,874 --> 00:40:00,207
And, uh, he's susceptible
to all kinds of medical conditions...

489
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:02,610
including thyroid problems...

490
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,673
intestinal abnormalities
and a high risk for leukemia.

491
00:40:07,652 --> 00:40:10,052
And the good news is?

492
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:13,489
Well, I just want to make sure
that both of you understand...

493
00:40:13,558 --> 00:40:16,425
that raising a child with
Down syndrome...

494
00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:18,018
is a major commitment.

495
00:40:18,096 --> 00:40:21,725
We got it. We signed up
for the gig, didn't we?

496
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:23,630
Now, he's never gonna
go to college...

497
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:27,899
or leave home on his
own or get a job.

498
00:40:27,972 --> 00:40:31,703
What you see is
what you get.

499
00:40:39,117 --> 00:40:41,278
That looks really great.

500
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:43,013
Good job.

501
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:48,187
Hi. This must be Marco.

502
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:50,056
Hi, Marco. I'm Miss Fleming.

503
00:40:50,128 --> 00:40:51,527
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

504
00:40:51,596 --> 00:40:53,359
What's your doll's name?

505
00:40:53,431 --> 00:40:54,864
Ashley.

506
00:40:54,932 --> 00:40:57,025
Ashley.

507
00:40:57,702 --> 00:40:59,192
Okay, I'll take it from here.

508
00:41:00,138 --> 00:41:01,799
Uh, shouldn't we wait a little bit?

509
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:04,535
Yeah. You know, to make sure
he's okay and everything.

510
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:07,840
I think it's easiest
if you just leave quickly.

511
00:41:07,912 --> 00:41:10,437
Oh. It might be best for him,
but what about me?

512
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:13,907
We'll see you at the
end of the day.

513
00:41:17,054 --> 00:41:21,684
Let's go meet your friends, okay?
And bring Ashley with you.

514
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:24,694
Okay, this is the gang.
This is Marco.

515
00:41:24,762 --> 00:41:28,596
We're doing a big puzzle right now.
Do you want to join us?

516
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:30,429
- Um-
- Okay. It's okay.

517
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:33,732
- I'm gonna get you a chair, all right?
- Mm-hmm.

518
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:36,899
Okay, what do we got?
"The cat sat by the door."

519
00:41:36,974 --> 00:41:41,104
That's pretty good, except
there's two O's in "door." Good.

520
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:42,874
Let's try the next one.

521
00:41:42,947 --> 00:41:46,212
"The bug sat in the grass."

522
00:41:46,284 --> 00:41:49,947
"The bug sat in the grass."
Think you can do that all by yourself?

523
00:41:50,021 --> 00:41:52,251
Yeah? Let's see ya.

524
00:41:59,163 --> 00:42:00,653
That's right.

525
00:42:05,236 --> 00:42:07,830
- I am so sorry.
- Nice of you to join us.

526
00:42:07,905 --> 00:42:11,898
Marco had loads of homework, and Paul
was late getting back from the office.

527
00:42:11,976 --> 00:42:14,069
Yeah. You're a regular
Ozzie and Harriet, ain't ya?

528
00:42:22,153 --> 00:42:25,281
What's going on?

529
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:26,414
- This is-
- No.

530
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,321
- Where are you taking me?
- Stop it.

531
00:42:28,392 --> 00:42:30,519
- Just walk.
- My eyes are closed.

532
00:42:31,529 --> 00:42:33,520
- Okay.
- Bing!

533
00:42:38,135 --> 00:42:41,798
So... you can sing, do your demos.

534
00:42:43,274 --> 00:42:44,764
Oh.

535
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:50,979
- You.
- You deserve it.

536
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:16,099
# Come to me #

537
00:43:16,173 --> 00:43:20,269
# When your world is
empty and cold #

538
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:24,041
# Come to me #

539
00:43:24,115 --> 00:43:28,245
# When you need
someone to hold #

540
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,847
# Come to me #

541
00:43:32,924 --> 00:43:36,621
# In my arms,
I'll keep you safe and warm #

542
00:43:36,694 --> 00:43:39,925
# Come to me #

543
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:44,860
# I will shelter you
from the storm #

544
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:49,032
# I'm not one to pretend #

545
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:53,270
# Why can't you understand #

546
00:43:53,344 --> 00:43:56,711
# That I love you? #

547
00:43:57,615 --> 00:44:01,073
# And I love you #

548
00:44:01,852 --> 00:44:06,050
# And I need you #

549
00:44:06,123 --> 00:44:09,456
# And I want you #

550
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:14,052
# Yes, I love you #

551
00:44:15,232 --> 00:44:19,464
# And I love you #

552
00:44:19,537 --> 00:44:23,701
# And I need you #

553
00:44:23,774 --> 00:44:27,574
# And I want you #

554
00:45:01,979 --> 00:45:06,746
# Yes, I love you #

555
00:45:06,817 --> 00:45:11,083
# And I love you #

556
00:45:11,155 --> 00:45:14,147
# And I need you #

557
00:45:15,326 --> 00:45:19,786
# And I want you #

558
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:26,768
# Come to me ##

559
00:45:40,684 --> 00:45:42,413
Why you kissing it?

560
00:45:42,486 --> 00:45:47,082
Um, well, they're demo tapes, and, uh,
I'm sending them to club owners.

561
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:49,149
I'm trying to get a job
singing for real.

562
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:52,855
And the kiss just gives it
a little bit of extra luck.

563
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:57,333
And trust me, honey, we can all do with
a little extra luck in this crazy world.

564
00:46:02,873 --> 00:46:07,537
You wanna kiss one?
There we go. This is the one.

565
00:46:08,779 --> 00:46:11,771
I can feel it in my water.

566
00:46:14,652 --> 00:46:21,683
# America, America #

567
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:27,891
# God shed his
grace on thee #

568
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:32,527
# And crown thy good #

569
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:35,936
# With brotherhood #

570
00:46:36,006 --> 00:46:42,673
# From sea to shining sea #

571
00:46:57,962 --> 00:47:02,831
I thought you should see this.
Marco says it's a picture of his two daddies.

572
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,836
- "His two daddies."
- Oh, no, no. That couldn't possibly be me.

573
00:47:06,904 --> 00:47:11,102
I-I never wear canary yellow.
It makes me all pale and washed out.

574
00:47:13,043 --> 00:47:17,480
Look, I personally don't care
what your relationship is.

575
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:20,312
We don't have a relationship.

576
00:47:21,018 --> 00:47:24,283
Like I said, I-I- I don't care.

577
00:47:24,355 --> 00:47:28,348
But people talk, and other teachers talk.
Other parents talk.

578
00:47:28,425 --> 00:47:31,394
I mean, all it takes is one person
saying something to the wrong person...

579
00:47:31,462 --> 00:47:34,329
and you could have
a real pickle on your hands.

580
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,030
Yeah!

581
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:46,201
Nice. Top.

582
00:47:56,754 --> 00:48:02,090
So- I decided I'm gonna
put you on the Franklin case.

583
00:48:03,194 --> 00:48:05,856
- Really? - It's a big step.
Are you ready for it?

584
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:08,558
Absolutely. Thank you.

585
00:48:08,632 --> 00:48:11,226
You know we're held to a higher standard
at that D.A.'s office, right?

586
00:48:11,302 --> 00:48:12,530
Sure.

587
00:48:12,603 --> 00:48:16,403
So I'm gonna ask you straight.
Can I count on you?

588
00:48:16,473 --> 00:48:18,498
You can count on me.

589
00:48:20,077 --> 00:48:22,238
Good. Take it out.

590
00:48:22,313 --> 00:48:25,714
Oh, before I forget. We're having
a shindig at the house Saturday.

591
00:48:25,783 --> 00:48:27,978
- Can you make it?
- Sure.

592
00:48:28,052 --> 00:48:32,148
Is your cousin and his kid still living with you?
Uh, Kelly wants to invite them too.

593
00:48:32,223 --> 00:48:33,918
Oh, we'd hate to impose.

594
00:48:33,991 --> 00:48:36,323
Hey, trust me, it's not an imposition.
Come on. Come on.

595
00:48:36,393 --> 00:48:38,725
- I know. It's just-
- I insist, all right?

596
00:48:38,796 --> 00:48:40,423
So stop flapping your gums-

597
00:48:40,497 --> 00:48:43,762
And tell me you can make it.

598
00:48:43,834 --> 00:48:46,530
- Okay, I can make it.
- Ho!

599
00:48:51,508 --> 00:48:54,375
- You must be Rudy.
- Enchanté.

600
00:48:54,445 --> 00:48:57,380
Oh.
Such a gentleman.

601
00:48:57,448 --> 00:48:59,313
What do you do for a living?

602
00:48:59,383 --> 00:49:01,248
- I'm a performer.
- I knew it.

603
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:03,218
I could just tell that
you were an artist.

604
00:49:03,287 --> 00:49:07,417
I could just tell from your energy.
You just have such an artistic style.

605
00:49:07,491 --> 00:49:10,688
"Performer."
That's a pretty vague answer, isn't it?

606
00:49:11,595 --> 00:49:13,222
What details were
you lookin' for?

607
00:49:15,132 --> 00:49:16,997
This is Marco.

608
00:49:17,067 --> 00:49:21,128
Oh! Can you give me five, Marco?

609
00:49:23,107 --> 00:49:26,076
Go ahead. Give her five, Marco.

610
00:49:27,378 --> 00:49:30,279
- It takes him a few minutes
to warm up. - Oh, it's okay.

611
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:33,783
Just make yourself at home.
Enjoy the party.

612
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:36,513
Honey, Phyllis is over there.
We need to go.

613
00:49:36,587 --> 00:49:37,918
Yeah.

614
00:49:44,128 --> 00:49:45,789
- Hi, Mr. Fleiger.
- Hey, Monica.

615
00:49:45,863 --> 00:49:48,331
- You remember Mr. Donatello?
- Yeah.

616
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:51,397
# Baby, please #

617
00:49:51,468 --> 00:49:55,802
# Don't leave me this way #

618
00:49:55,873 --> 00:49:58,273
# Ah, baby #

619
00:49:58,342 --> 00:50:02,676
# My heart s full of love
and desire for you #

620
00:50:02,746 --> 00:50:06,273
# Now come on down
and do what you gotta do #

621
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:10,446
# You started this fire
down in my soul #

622
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:14,548
# Now can't you see
it's burning out of control? #

623
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:18,356
# Come on, satisfy
the need in me #

624
00:50:18,429 --> 00:50:22,661
# 'Cause only your good lovin'
can set me free #

625
00:50:22,733 --> 00:50:24,360
# Hey #

626
00:50:24,435 --> 00:50:28,132
# Don't, don't you leave
me this way, no #

627
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:31,970
# Don't you understand #

628
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:34,169
# I'm at your command? #

629
00:50:34,244 --> 00:50:35,939
# Oh, baby, please #

630
00:50:36,013 --> 00:50:40,177
# Please, don't leave me this way #

631
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,548
# No, no, baby #

632
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:46,988
# Don't leave me this way, no #

633
00:50:47,057 --> 00:50:49,855
# I can't survive #

634
00:50:49,927 --> 00:50:54,421
# I can't stay alive without
your love #

635
00:50:54,498 --> 00:50:58,264
# Baby, don't leave me this way #

636
00:50:58,335 --> 00:51:00,462
# Ah, baby #

637
00:51:00,537 --> 00:51:02,129
Poor, poor Lois Lane.

638
00:51:02,206 --> 00:51:04,606
# My heart s full of love
and desire for you #

639
00:51:04,675 --> 00:51:07,872
She has no idea that her
mild-mannered Clark Kent...

640
00:51:07,945 --> 00:51:12,211
is faster than a speeding bullet,
more powerful than a locomotive...

641
00:51:12,282 --> 00:51:15,877
and able to leap tall cocks
in a single bound.

642
00:51:17,621 --> 00:51:21,523
# So come on,
satisfy the need in me #

643
00:51:22,526 --> 00:51:24,391
So, what's the game plan here, hmm?

644
00:51:25,362 --> 00:51:27,455
We're gonna be, what...

645
00:51:28,165 --> 00:51:31,066
wrinkled, old queens
still telling people we're cousins?

646
00:51:32,403 --> 00:51:35,861
Do you want to lose him?
'Cause that's what'll happen.

647
00:51:37,674 --> 00:51:39,733
That's discrimination, Paul.

648
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:42,711
No, that is not discrimination.
That's reality.

649
00:51:44,915 --> 00:51:47,748
Good thing the black people
had Dr. King instead of you.

650
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:49,308
Different situation, Rudy.

651
00:51:49,386 --> 00:51:52,219
No, Paul, it is not.

652
00:51:58,295 --> 00:52:00,286
# Hey, hey, baby #

653
00:52:00,364 --> 00:52:02,355
# Come and satisfy
the need in me #

654
00:52:02,433 --> 00:52:06,130
# Oh, baby,
come and satisfy the need in me #

655
00:52:06,203 --> 00:52:09,900
# Oh, baby, don't leave
me this way ##

656
00:52:31,295 --> 00:52:33,763
Monica, what's wrong?

657
00:52:33,831 --> 00:52:35,321
What's wrong?

658
00:52:39,303 --> 00:52:42,431
Marco! Mar...
Leave him!

659
00:52:42,506 --> 00:52:44,599
Marco! You have no right, lady!

660
00:52:44,675 --> 00:52:46,142
Bring him back!

661
00:53:25,015 --> 00:53:27,677
Sign on lines seven, 12 and 13.

662
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:29,616
We gotta get him back.

663
00:53:29,686 --> 00:53:31,847
There's a 72-hour
mandatory evaluation period.

664
00:53:31,922 --> 00:53:33,412
There's nothing we can
do until then.

665
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:36,891
Our son is God knows where.
He should be home and safe with us.

666
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,121
He's not our son.

667
00:53:39,196 --> 00:53:40,720
Fuck you!

668
00:53:40,797 --> 00:53:42,890
You had temporary custody
subject to the judge's-

669
00:53:42,966 --> 00:53:44,831
Oh, fuck the judge.

670
00:53:44,902 --> 00:53:49,305
Sure, fuck the judge, fuck me,
and fuck the fact that I lost my job today!

671
00:53:49,373 --> 00:53:51,364
That's the best thing
that ever happened to you.

672
00:53:51,441 --> 00:53:53,636
- Best thing that ever
happened to me? - Yo!

673
00:53:54,878 --> 00:53:57,142
You don't have to live
a lie anymore.

674
00:53:57,214 --> 00:53:59,774
Now is your chance to-to be you.

675
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:02,011
Listen, I spent
the last 10 years of my life...

676
00:54:02,085 --> 00:54:04,679
studying, saving and busting
my ass for that job!

677
00:54:04,755 --> 00:54:08,191
So pardon me if I'm not in the mood
for your idealistic bullshit!

678
00:54:08,258 --> 00:54:12,217
You told me you became an attorney
so you could change the world!

679
00:54:12,296 --> 00:54:14,992
Do you remember that
idealistic bullshit?

680
00:54:17,534 --> 00:54:19,729
So here it is.

681
00:54:19,803 --> 00:54:22,931
Here is your chance
to kick open that closet door...

682
00:54:23,006 --> 00:54:24,837
and do some of that
world changing.

683
00:54:34,685 --> 00:54:39,179
Your Honor, we are requesting
that Marco be released into our custody.

684
00:54:39,256 --> 00:54:41,121
Your request is denied.

685
00:54:41,191 --> 00:54:45,252
And after lying to this court about
the true nature of your relationship...

686
00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:47,559
you are lucky that I don't
charge you both with perjury.

687
00:54:47,631 --> 00:54:49,030
Oh, please-

688
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:51,033
Respectfully, we ask that you consider
the wishes of the mother.

689
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:53,797
- You got him in some home when he belongs
with us! - Get your client under control.

690
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,861
Is this your idea of justice?

691
00:54:55,939 --> 00:54:58,567
- Mr. Donatello-
- We are talking about a human life here!

692
00:54:58,642 --> 00:55:01,770
- Mr. Donatello- - A human life that
you people don't give a damn about!

693
00:55:01,845 --> 00:55:05,941
Mr. Donatello, if I so much as hear one
more word out of your mouth this morning...

694
00:55:06,016 --> 00:55:10,749
I will find you in contempt of court
and have you tossed back into jail.

695
00:55:10,821 --> 00:55:13,756
Now, I have already ruled
on your request...

696
00:55:13,824 --> 00:55:15,724
and there is nothing
that you can say or do...

697
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:17,817
no matter how impassioned
or dramatic...

698
00:55:17,894 --> 00:55:19,987
that will make me change my ruling.

699
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:22,224
So unless you have some
other business before the court...

700
00:55:22,299 --> 00:55:26,235
I suggest the two of you find another venue
in which to display your histrionics.

701
00:55:26,303 --> 00:55:28,498
What if we file a petition
for permanent custody?

702
00:55:28,572 --> 00:55:30,096
I will rule against it.

703
00:55:30,173 --> 00:55:34,439
State code 143.56 prohibits you
from making a determination...

704
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:36,843
in a permanent-custody case
without a hearing.

705
00:55:36,913 --> 00:55:39,438
You are wearing
my patience thin, young man.

706
00:55:39,516 --> 00:55:41,484
Your Honor,
I am simply trying to ensure...

707
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:43,576
that an innocent child...

708
00:55:43,654 --> 00:55:46,851
isn't allowed to fall between
the cracks of the system.

709
00:55:51,461 --> 00:55:52,951
Please.

710
00:55:55,766 --> 00:55:58,098
- That's good news, right?
- Define "good."

711
00:55:58,168 --> 00:55:59,829
She agreed to hear our case.

712
00:55:59,903 --> 00:56:01,894
A case we can't win.

713
00:56:03,373 --> 00:56:05,204
Stop. Stop it!

714
00:56:05,275 --> 00:56:07,266
Paul, I believe in you...

715
00:56:09,012 --> 00:56:13,949
and I believe in us, and I believe that
no matter what, we have right on our side.

716
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:22,287
Okay.

717
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:24,919
I have a lot of prep work
I need to get started on right away.

718
00:56:24,995 --> 00:56:26,656
Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'll-
I'll- I'll help you.

719
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,994
I'll be your secretary now
that you've broken Lois Lane's heart.

720
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:31,057
- No. There's something else
I need you to do. - No. No.

721
00:56:31,134 --> 00:56:32,726
- Rudy.
- Paul, do not make me wear...

722
00:56:32,803 --> 00:56:34,202
the Ward Cleaver suit again...

723
00:56:34,271 --> 00:56:36,831
'cause wool and me- it's just-
It's- Oh, it's like oil and water.

724
00:56:36,907 --> 00:56:39,273
This is about your job.

725
00:56:39,342 --> 00:56:41,469
It's about your job.

726
00:56:41,545 --> 00:56:42,534
Rudy.

727
00:56:42,612 --> 00:56:45,103
Look, I know, I know. I get it.
But I talked it over with Paul.

728
00:56:45,182 --> 00:56:49,312
For us to have any chance of getting custody,
I can't be working as a drag queen.

729
00:56:49,386 --> 00:56:51,513
- So you're just gonna quit on us?
- Well, come on.

730
00:56:51,588 --> 00:56:55,718
Please! She quit on us as soon as she decided
to become a wet nurse for the little retard.

731
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:58,056
- Don't ever call my boy a retard.
- Rudy!

732
00:56:58,128 --> 00:57:00,995
- Okay?
- Rudy, we go on in 20 minutes.

733
00:57:01,064 --> 00:57:03,157
We cannot do this without you.

734
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:07,431
Sure you can.

735
00:57:07,504 --> 00:57:10,166
You always wanted to
be the star anyway.

736
00:57:18,415 --> 00:57:21,851
How long have the two of you
been in a relationship?

737
00:57:21,918 --> 00:57:26,787
Well, I-I-I guess that depends
on how you define "relationship."

738
00:57:30,093 --> 00:57:34,291
We met in September, and, uh,
that's when Rudy and Marco moved in.

739
00:57:41,538 --> 00:57:44,905
And how long after you met
did Mr. Donatello and the child move in?

740
00:57:45,942 --> 00:57:48,410
How long? I don't know exactly.

741
00:57:48,478 --> 00:57:51,879
Well, why don't you
just give it a good guess?

742
00:57:51,948 --> 00:57:53,575
Couple of days.

743
00:57:57,254 --> 00:58:01,486
It was love at first sight,
but we didn't want to rush into anything.

744
00:58:12,135 --> 00:58:14,626
Dd you ever see Rudy and Paul
wthout ther clothes?

745
00:58:18,508 --> 00:58:21,739
Did they ever touch you
in your private areas?

746
00:58:24,047 --> 00:58:26,208
Did they ever hit you?

747
00:58:29,419 --> 00:58:31,410
Young man,
unless you give me some answers...

748
00:58:31,488 --> 00:58:34,150
you won't be able to live
with Rudy and Paul ever again.

749
00:58:35,525 --> 00:58:37,459
Do you understand that?

750
00:58:48,205 --> 00:58:50,173
Do you want to live with
Rudy and Paul?

751
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:36,544
Did you ever believe Rudy and Paul's story
that they were cousins?

752
00:59:38,922 --> 00:59:41,186
No, I did not.

753
00:59:41,258 --> 00:59:45,558
And did you tell anyone about your suspicions
that they were, in fact, homosexual lovers?

754
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:48,527
Absolutely not.

755
00:59:48,598 --> 00:59:50,293
Why not?

756
00:59:51,368 --> 00:59:55,168
Sir, I believe that we are all
sexual creatures...

757
00:59:55,238 --> 00:59:59,106
and how the- the parents of my students
choose to enjoy their sexuality...

758
00:59:59,175 --> 01:00:03,737
is no more my business
than their personal finances.

759
01:00:03,813 --> 01:00:05,610
But we're not talking about
finances here.

760
01:00:05,682 --> 01:00:09,083
We're talking about a lifestyle
that most people would call deviant.

761
01:00:09,152 --> 01:00:10,881
Objection. Argumentative.

762
01:00:10,954 --> 01:00:12,387
Sustained.

763
01:00:15,025 --> 01:00:17,550
Were you ever concerned
about the effect...

764
01:00:17,627 --> 01:00:20,755
that Rudy and Paul's lifestyle
might have on Marco?

765
01:00:21,665 --> 01:00:22,893
No.

766
01:00:24,601 --> 01:00:26,501
Interesting.

767
01:00:26,569 --> 01:00:28,230
Nothing further.

768
01:00:31,608 --> 01:00:36,272
Miss Flemming, would you share with the court
your thoughts on Marco's progress at school?

769
01:00:36,346 --> 01:00:39,838
Well, if- if you merely look
at his academic growth...

770
01:00:39,916 --> 01:00:42,976
it's clear that he-
he flourished intellectually.

771
01:00:43,053 --> 01:00:45,647
But I think the most
interesting aspect...

772
01:00:45,722 --> 01:00:50,022
has been the improvement
in Marco's social skills.

773
01:00:50,093 --> 01:00:53,824
So, in your estimation,
the change you've seen is in part due...

774
01:00:53,897 --> 01:00:56,525
to Mr. Donatello and Mr. Fleiger?

775
01:00:56,599 --> 01:00:58,089
Absolutely.

776
01:00:58,168 --> 01:01:00,136
Mr. Donatello and Mr. Fleiger...

777
01:01:00,203 --> 01:01:03,900
are as compassionate and loving
parents as I've ever seen.

778
01:01:05,442 --> 01:01:07,808
What was your impression
of Rudy and myself as parents?

779
01:01:07,877 --> 01:01:11,643
Well, I admit I did have
my initial reservations...

780
01:01:11,715 --> 01:01:14,479
but overall,
my impression was very positive.

781
01:01:14,551 --> 01:01:17,543
And the home environment
that we created for Marco?

782
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:22,182
It appears to have been safe,
comfortable and loving.

783
01:01:22,258 --> 01:01:24,556
- You evaluated Marco, didn't you?
- I did.

784
01:01:24,627 --> 01:01:29,360
And did he express his desire to live
with Mr. Donatello and myself?

785
01:01:31,901 --> 01:01:33,596
He did, very much so.

786
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:36,503
And would it be your recommendation
that it would be in Marco's best interest...

787
01:01:36,573 --> 01:01:38,097
to be raised in our care?

788
01:01:38,174 --> 01:01:40,005
It would.

789
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:45,380
Can you tell us about your relationship
with Mr. Donatello?

790
01:01:45,448 --> 01:01:48,508
I never had a relationship
with Mr. Donatello.

791
01:01:48,585 --> 01:01:52,612
I mean, he's cute and all,
but he's definitely not my type.

792
01:01:53,556 --> 01:01:56,286
How do you know Rudy?

793
01:01:56,359 --> 01:01:59,157
We used to work together, at Fabio's.

794
01:01:59,229 --> 01:02:01,026
We had a female-impersonation act.

795
01:02:02,232 --> 01:02:04,496
Which means?

796
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:08,970
Which means we put on shiny dresses,
wear makeup and wigs and lip-synch to songs.

797
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:10,973
It was tres sexy.

798
01:02:14,911 --> 01:02:17,209
Did Rudy ever bring the
child to the bar?

799
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,477
Sometimes he would bring Marco
to rehearsals.

800
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:24,577
Mentally handicapped
child in a gay bar.

801
01:02:24,654 --> 01:02:27,623
- Wow.
- Is that a question?

802
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:30,619
No, no.
Just an observation.

803
01:02:30,693 --> 01:02:33,093
Let's limit it to questions,
Mr. Lambert.

804
01:02:33,163 --> 01:02:35,597
He would only bring Marco there
when the bar was closed.

805
01:02:35,665 --> 01:02:37,895
- I don't believe I asked
you a question. - I know.

806
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:40,800
- I was just trying to clarify.
- Trust me, it's clear.

807
01:02:42,372 --> 01:02:45,899
Now, did you ever see, uh,
Rudy and Paul...

808
01:02:47,143 --> 01:02:49,270
kiss in front of Marco?

809
01:02:49,345 --> 01:02:51,006
They're lovers.

810
01:02:52,248 --> 01:02:55,308
So the answer to my question is?

811
01:02:56,553 --> 01:02:58,350
Yes.

812
01:02:58,421 --> 01:03:00,821
Okay, so they kissed in
front of the child.

813
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:04,485
Now, are we talking a
peck on the cheek...

814
01:03:04,561 --> 01:03:08,122
or was it something that
your friend might call...

815
01:03:08,198 --> 01:03:09,961
"tres sexy"?

816
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:23,004
When you're on the stand, just answer
the questions straightforward and simple.

817
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:25,240
No Rudy-isms.

818
01:03:25,315 --> 01:03:27,146
- "No Rudy-isms"?
- No Rudy-isms.

819
01:03:27,217 --> 01:03:31,551
I need you to be cool, okay?

820
01:03:35,158 --> 01:03:37,092
I will be cool.

821
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:40,827
As cool...

822
01:03:40,897 --> 01:03:43,263
as the other side of the pillow.

823
01:03:45,935 --> 01:03:48,062
Let me see how cool your
pillow is, mister.

824
01:03:48,138 --> 01:03:50,834
Oh, Mr. Fleiger.

825
01:03:50,907 --> 01:03:54,343
Oh, I'm very sorry to report, but...

826
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:57,709
the underside of your
pillow is quite hot.

827
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,271
- I'm gonna have to take
your temperature. - No.

828
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,113
No!

829
01:04:03,953 --> 01:04:06,080
Oh, yeah.

830
01:04:06,156 --> 01:04:08,818
It's kind of hot down here.

831
01:04:21,905 --> 01:04:23,566
I love you.

832
01:04:26,376 --> 01:04:28,401
Yeah, I know.

833
01:04:28,478 --> 01:04:30,469
Shut up.

834
01:04:30,547 --> 01:04:34,108
Oh!

835
01:04:39,455 --> 01:04:41,252
Mr. Donatello.

836
01:04:41,324 --> 01:04:43,724
Marco was in your care
for how long?

837
01:04:43,793 --> 01:04:45,988
About a year.

838
01:04:46,062 --> 01:04:49,259
- And he's 14 years old?
- Fifteen. He's 15 now.

839
01:04:49,332 --> 01:04:52,062
- His birthday's May 23.
- Oh, that's right. Fifteen.

840
01:04:52,135 --> 01:04:54,262
So, Marco...

841
01:04:54,337 --> 01:04:57,932
for one year of his 15 years...

842
01:04:58,007 --> 01:05:00,168
was in your care?

843
01:05:00,243 --> 01:05:03,269
You formed a pretty strong attachment
in a short period of time.

844
01:05:03,346 --> 01:05:07,248
Yeah. We fell in love.
Don't take long.

845
01:05:07,317 --> 01:05:10,809
Clearly. You moved in with Mr. Fleiger,
what, the day after you met?

846
01:05:10,887 --> 01:05:12,718
Objection. Relevance.

847
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:13,949
Sustained.

848
01:05:14,023 --> 01:05:18,016
In the one year of the
child's 15 years...

849
01:05:18,094 --> 01:05:20,085
that he was under your care...

850
01:05:21,965 --> 01:05:24,729
what kind of parental figure
would you say you were?

851
01:05:26,402 --> 01:05:30,361
I would say I was a
great parental figure.

852
01:05:31,574 --> 01:05:33,838
Both me and Paul were.

853
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:37,368
Let's forget about Paul for now
and focus on you.

854
01:05:39,315 --> 01:05:41,112
What made you a great parent?

855
01:05:42,986 --> 01:05:45,853
I, um-

856
01:05:45,922 --> 01:05:49,323
I cared for Marco like
he was my own-

857
01:05:50,326 --> 01:05:51,816
our own.

858
01:05:51,894 --> 01:05:55,853
We got him up every morning,
made him breakfast...

859
01:05:55,932 --> 01:05:58,696
took him to school,
played with him...

860
01:05:58,768 --> 01:06:00,929
tucked him in with
a story every night.

861
01:06:02,105 --> 01:06:05,006
We were... his parents...

862
01:06:06,709 --> 01:06:09,439
and we were damn
good at it...

863
01:06:09,512 --> 01:06:11,776
and we would like to
keep on doing it.

864
01:06:13,983 --> 01:06:16,679
That's very clear, Mr. Donatello.

865
01:06:16,753 --> 01:06:19,347
Did you, uh-

866
01:06:19,422 --> 01:06:21,913
Did you call the authorities-

867
01:06:21,991 --> 01:06:24,983
the police or Family Services- after you
first found out that Marco was left alone...

868
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:26,722
after his mother's arrest?

869
01:06:26,796 --> 01:06:28,286
No. I called Paul.

870
01:06:28,364 --> 01:06:31,390
He is a lawyer, and, uh, I thought
he would know what to do.

871
01:06:31,467 --> 01:06:34,231
Oh. And did you call
the authorities...

872
01:06:34,304 --> 01:06:38,866
after he came back after running away from
the foster home where he'd been placed?

873
01:06:38,941 --> 01:06:44,004
No, I did not call
the authorities.

874
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,071
In fact, you and Mr. Fleiger...

875
01:06:46,149 --> 01:06:50,210
decided unilaterally
to just keep the child.

876
01:06:50,286 --> 01:06:54,222
- Isn't that correct? - His mom
signed the papers that made it legal.

877
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:57,225
His mom, who's doing 36 months
for a drug-possession charge.

878
01:06:57,293 --> 01:06:59,818
Your Honor, a mother's incarceration
doesn't deny her right...

879
01:06:59,896 --> 01:07:02,262
to make custodial decisions
on behalf of her minor children.

880
01:07:02,332 --> 01:07:04,698
Let's move on,
Mr. Lambert.

881
01:07:06,302 --> 01:07:09,794
Um, your friends testified...

882
01:07:09,872 --> 01:07:13,899
that you took the child
to a bar called Fabio's.

883
01:07:13,976 --> 01:07:15,944
They're not my friends.

884
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:20,005
So, did you or did you not
take the child to a gay bar?

885
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:23,414
Not when it was open.

886
01:07:23,486 --> 01:07:25,420
So the answer is yes...

887
01:07:25,488 --> 01:07:30,050
you did take him to a bar
that was frequented by homosexuals.

888
01:07:30,126 --> 01:07:31,252
Yes.

889
01:07:31,327 --> 01:07:34,194
And your friends also testified
that you took part...

890
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:37,755
in a female-impersonation act.

891
01:07:39,602 --> 01:07:41,536
Was their testimony accurate...

892
01:07:41,604 --> 01:07:43,435
that during the time
Marco was in your care...

893
01:07:43,506 --> 01:07:46,475
you wore a woman's dress
and makeup for work?

894
01:07:48,244 --> 01:07:49,643
Yes.

895
01:07:49,712 --> 01:07:52,203
Have you ever worn a dress and
makeup in front of Marco?

896
01:07:52,281 --> 01:07:55,079
No.

897
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:58,245
No? You sure?

898
01:08:01,491 --> 01:08:06,986
Are you sure that that, uh, is the
testimony you want to give under oath?

899
01:08:12,602 --> 01:08:14,900
Halloween?

900
01:08:16,606 --> 01:08:18,574
"Halloween"?

901
01:08:18,641 --> 01:08:20,768
What does Halloween mean?

902
01:08:23,379 --> 01:08:26,473
I, uh, dressed up like
the Bride of Frankenstein.

903
01:08:26,549 --> 01:08:29,313
Oh, so the correct answer is yes...

904
01:08:29,385 --> 01:08:31,546
you have worn a dress and makeup
in front of Marco.

905
01:08:31,621 --> 01:08:34,522
- Your Honor, asked and answered.
- Overruled.

906
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:36,751
Just answer the question.

907
01:08:36,826 --> 01:08:38,726
It was a costume!

908
01:08:38,795 --> 01:08:43,994
Uh, Marco was wearing
this, um, funny Frankenstein head.

909
01:08:44,066 --> 01:08:47,001
- Paul was a cowboy.
- Mr. Donatello.

910
01:08:47,069 --> 01:08:51,506
I asked you a very simple question. Have you
ever worn a dress and makeup in front of Marco?

911
01:08:52,575 --> 01:08:55,066
Yes, I have.

912
01:08:55,144 --> 01:09:00,639
Did you ever once worry what effect
that would have on Marco?

913
01:09:00,716 --> 01:09:02,946
No, I did not.

914
01:09:05,087 --> 01:09:07,214
What is Marco's favorite toy?

915
01:09:23,139 --> 01:09:24,868
I'm sorry.
Did you say something?

916
01:09:33,483 --> 01:09:36,475
His favorite toy was his doll.

917
01:09:37,587 --> 01:09:40,112
It's a girl doll, right?

918
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:42,521
Dress, long, blonde hair, makeup?

919
01:09:46,062 --> 01:09:48,223
You know, you can twist the truth
any way you like...

920
01:09:48,297 --> 01:09:53,428
but it does not alter the fact that Marco
is a needy kid who deserves a family.

921
01:09:53,503 --> 01:09:57,166
See, I'd argue that this
is becoming less and less...

922
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,538
about a needy kid who
deserves a family...

923
01:09:59,609 --> 01:10:02,635
and more and more about
a couple of needy men...

924
01:10:02,712 --> 01:10:05,875
who aren't willing to truly look
at what is best for the child.

925
01:10:05,948 --> 01:10:09,008
Oh, and you think you know
what is best for Marco?

926
01:10:09,085 --> 01:10:12,350
- You didn't even know how old he is!
- Mr. Donatello-

927
01:10:12,421 --> 01:10:14,753
He didn't even know that Marco
had a birthday last month, Your Honor-

928
01:10:14,824 --> 01:10:16,314
a birthday he spent alone!

929
01:10:16,392 --> 01:10:18,758
- Your Honor, may we get a recess?
- No, Mr. Fleiger!

930
01:10:18,828 --> 01:10:20,955
Have you ever engaged in sexual
activity in front of Marco?

931
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:23,191
- Objection! Relevance!
- Overruled.

932
01:10:23,266 --> 01:10:25,564
- What, you think we're child molesters now?
- You said it, not me.

933
01:10:25,635 --> 01:10:28,035
Any fucking we did was in the
privacy of our own bedroom!

934
01:10:28,104 --> 01:10:28,866
Mr. Donatello-

935
01:10:28,938 --> 01:10:32,465
Look, just because we are different
does not make us bad parents!

936
01:10:32,542 --> 01:10:35,272
- This is such bullshit!
- You are out of order!

937
01:10:35,344 --> 01:10:37,642
How can you make a ruling...

938
01:10:37,713 --> 01:10:41,979
when all we've talked about is gay or
straight or dolls or fucking dresses?

939
01:10:42,051 --> 01:10:45,077
Why aren't we talking
about the real issue?

940
01:10:45,154 --> 01:10:49,250
This hearing is about Marco...

941
01:10:49,325 --> 01:10:52,385
who at this very moment
is sitting in some foster home...

942
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:54,895
and who will sit in some
foster home forever...

943
01:10:54,964 --> 01:10:57,125
because no one wants to adopt him.

944
01:10:57,199 --> 01:11:00,862
No one wants to adopt some short,
fat, mentally handicapped kid.

945
01:11:00,937 --> 01:11:06,637
No one in this entire world
wants him... except us.

946
01:11:09,278 --> 01:11:13,112
We want him.
We love him.

947
01:11:13,182 --> 01:11:15,912
We'll take care of him
and educate him...

948
01:11:15,985 --> 01:11:19,978
keep him safe and raise
him to be a good man.

949
01:11:21,257 --> 01:11:23,851
Isn't that what
he deserves?

950
01:11:30,099 --> 01:11:32,863
Isn't that what every
child deserves?

951
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:37,869
I'll take your comments into
consideration, Mr. Fleiger.

952
01:11:40,943 --> 01:11:43,605
Yes, ma'am. Thank you,
Your Honor.

953
01:12:03,265 --> 01:12:06,723
Ain't going to be much longer,
and we're gonna have you out of there.

954
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,003
So you pack your bags...

955
01:12:13,643 --> 01:12:16,806
'cause we are bringing
you home.

956
01:12:16,879 --> 01:12:19,541
P-Promise?

957
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:23,480
Yeah.

958
01:12:23,552 --> 01:12:25,383
Yeah, I promse.

959
01:12:50,846 --> 01:12:55,010
After listenng to all of the testimony
and reviewing all of the paperwork.

960
01:12:55,084 --> 01:12:57,678
I'm prepared to make my ruing.

961
01:12:57,753 --> 01:13:00,244
It's very clear that Mr. Donatello
and Mr. Fleiger...

962
01:13:00,322 --> 01:13:03,780
have had a powerful and positive
effect on Marco's life.

963
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:05,850
They have made numerous
sacrifices...

964
01:13:05,928 --> 01:13:10,524
and they have ensured that all of
Marco's needs were properly met.

965
01:13:10,599 --> 01:13:15,400
However, I cannot ignore
the other facts of the case.

966
01:13:15,471 --> 01:13:19,237
While Mr. Donatello and Mr. Fleger
obviously love the child.

967
01:13:19,308 --> 01:13:21,799
It is this court's opinion
that they have at times.

968
01:13:21,877 --> 01:13:24,710
Subjected him to inappropriate
situations.

969
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,408
And that their openly
homosexual lifestyle.

970
01:13:27,483 --> 01:13:30,247
Could be assumed by the child
to be normal.

971
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:32,344
And could lead to confusion,
sexual...

972
01:14:16,966 --> 01:14:19,332
- Hello?
- Is this Rudy Donatello?

973
01:14:20,336 --> 01:14:22,167
- Who's this?
- Miles Dubrow.

974
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:24,968
I own a club called
'The Spot in Hollywood.'

975
01:14:27,743 --> 01:14:30,371
I gotta tell you,
I'm quite impressed with this demo.

976
01:14:30,446 --> 01:14:33,540
- You got a hell of a voice, kid.
- Thanks.

977
01:14:36,085 --> 01:14:38,019
Tell you what I'll do.

978
01:14:38,087 --> 01:14:41,181
I can offer you two nights a week to start.
We can see how it goes.

979
01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:43,623
- I know it's not much, but-
- I'll take it.

980
01:14:58,474 --> 01:15:01,272
# You abandoned me #

981
01:15:04,346 --> 01:15:10,910
# Love don't live
here anymore #

982
01:15:13,322 --> 01:15:16,382
# Just a vacancy #

983
01:15:19,094 --> 01:15:24,430
# Love don't live
here anymore #

984
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:31,540
# When you lived
inside of me #

985
01:15:32,274 --> 01:15:34,799
# There was nothing
I could conceive #

986
01:15:34,877 --> 01:15:38,074
# You wouldn't do for me #

987
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:46,385
# Trouble seemed
so far away #

988
01:15:48,657 --> 01:15:55,586
# Oh, you changed that
right away #

989
01:16:06,108 --> 01:16:08,542
You're a lawyer.
Why don't you handle the appeal?

990
01:16:09,378 --> 01:16:13,280
We believe the judges and Marco's
court-appointed attorney are biased against us.

991
01:16:14,316 --> 01:16:17,183
Oh, so I'm your man 'cause ain't nobody
in that courtroom got a bias...

992
01:16:17,253 --> 01:16:21,212
against a black man who knows the law
better than they do, huh?

993
01:16:23,626 --> 01:16:25,560
Let me guess.

994
01:16:25,628 --> 01:16:28,688
All them white lawyers you talked to
before you came to me...

995
01:16:28,764 --> 01:16:31,460
didn't want nothing to do
with this case, did they?

996
01:16:33,202 --> 01:16:35,727
That's 'cause they know you're gonna
be judged by the dicks you've sucked...

997
01:16:35,804 --> 01:16:37,795
and not by the content
of your character.

998
01:16:38,874 --> 01:16:41,172
- We can find another attorney.
- Rudy, wait.

999
01:16:41,243 --> 01:16:45,407
The word on you is you're a smart lawyer
and a hell of a negotiator...

1000
01:16:45,481 --> 01:16:47,506
who's not afraid of
a tough case.

1001
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:49,949
Well, your case is beyond tough,
my friend.

1002
01:16:50,019 --> 01:16:51,680
We're well aware of our chances.

1003
01:16:51,754 --> 01:16:54,382
Frankly, it's damn near impossible
to get custody as a gay man.

1004
01:16:54,456 --> 01:16:57,721
Frankly, it's damn near impossible
to do anything as a gay man.

1005
01:16:58,694 --> 01:17:00,355
I have found several
examples of case law...

1006
01:17:00,429 --> 01:17:03,660
that I believe clearly support
our argument.

1007
01:17:06,368 --> 01:17:08,598
Okay, gentlemen,
let's talk some straight shit.

1008
01:17:10,372 --> 01:17:13,500
If I decide to take this case...

1009
01:17:13,575 --> 01:17:16,408
everything you have ever said or done
is gonna be fair game...

1010
01:17:16,478 --> 01:17:18,708
when we walk back into that
courtroom and we tell them...

1011
01:17:18,781 --> 01:17:23,184
that the great and powerful
Judge Meyerson has made a mistake.

1012
01:17:23,953 --> 01:17:26,581
And you think they were biased
against you before?

1013
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:30,318
They gonna get some nasty dog
who's gonna dig and dig and dig...

1014
01:17:30,392 --> 01:17:32,917
until he finds every person
you have ever fucked...

1015
01:17:32,995 --> 01:17:36,761
every drug you have ever snorted,
every street you have ever crossed...

1016
01:17:36,832 --> 01:17:38,823
without waiting for the
goddamn walk signal.

1017
01:17:39,969 --> 01:17:43,871
And do you know the one thing I cannot
stand when I walk into a courtroom?

1018
01:17:43,939 --> 01:17:45,429
Surprises.

1019
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:51,341
So I'm gonna ask you guys some tough
questions, and I need the truth.

1020
01:18:01,991 --> 01:18:05,051
- Hello? - Hello. Uh,
this is Rudy Donatello.

1021
01:18:05,127 --> 01:18:08,119
I was lookng after Marco
for a whle.

1022
01:18:08,197 --> 01:18:09,858
Yeah, I know who you are.

1023
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:14,625
Yeah, well, I was- I was wondering
if I could, you know, maybe talk to him...

1024
01:18:14,703 --> 01:18:19,106
just find out how
he's doing...

1025
01:18:19,174 --> 01:18:21,335
and let him know I'm
thinking about him.

1026
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:23,901
Marco ain't here no more.

1027
01:18:23,979 --> 01:18:27,244
Your Honor, they have moved the child
from a foster home to a state institution.

1028
01:18:27,316 --> 01:18:29,250
We're requesting visitation
from our clients.

1029
01:18:29,318 --> 01:18:33,084
As the child's court-appointed attorney,
I don't see any change in circumstance.

1030
01:18:33,155 --> 01:18:35,988
- Can't recommend a modification.
- Agreed. Request denied.

1031
01:18:36,058 --> 01:18:38,288
If you simply weigh
the interests of the child-

1032
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,055
I said request denied.

1033
01:18:40,129 --> 01:18:43,963
Fine. We'll be filing a motion
to have this case heard in another court.

1034
01:18:44,033 --> 01:18:49,494
I will cite the deep and loving bond that clearly
exists between the minor and my clients...

1035
01:18:49,571 --> 01:18:53,974
their willingness to adhere to all conditions
as stipulated by the courts...

1036
01:18:54,043 --> 01:18:57,012
and, of course, your complete
and utter unwillingness...

1037
01:18:57,079 --> 01:18:59,775
to consider the best needs
of the child.

1038
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:03,110
This really the way
you want to start, Lonnie?

1039
01:19:04,053 --> 01:19:07,784
I don't know. It seems like, to me,
the ball's in your court... Richard.

1040
01:19:12,294 --> 01:19:14,319
Do you have supporting
documentation?

1041
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:19,528
I had my girl type these up for you in the off
chance that, you know, you saw things my way.

1042
01:19:23,305 --> 01:19:25,296
I'll approve one visit prior
to the hearing-

1043
01:19:25,374 --> 01:19:28,207
supervised, 30 minutes-
not a second more.

1044
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:43,647
You look skinny.

1045
01:19:44,393 --> 01:19:46,384
You getting enough to eat?

1046
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:50,289
Do they have doughnuts here?

1047
01:19:51,733 --> 01:19:55,726
Well, no doughnuts.
No wonder you're down in the dumps.

1048
01:20:00,642 --> 01:20:03,236
Will you tell me a story?

1049
01:20:08,784 --> 01:20:11,480
You want the one about the
magic boy named Marco?

1050
01:20:14,456 --> 01:20:16,447
With the happy ending, right?

1051
01:20:25,601 --> 01:20:27,091
Okay.

1052
01:20:30,305 --> 01:20:32,569
Once upon a time...

1053
01:20:32,641 --> 01:20:35,007
in a land far, far away...

1054
01:20:36,044 --> 01:20:39,707
there lived a magic
boy named Marco.

1055
01:21:03,672 --> 01:21:06,266
Gentlemen, I was looking over
state law last night...

1056
01:21:06,341 --> 01:21:08,935
and found that California
allows adoption...

1057
01:21:09,011 --> 01:21:12,708
by folks with a history of substance
abuse and domestic violence.

1058
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:15,841
- Not us.
- But not you.

1059
01:21:15,918 --> 01:21:18,648
Which I intend to argue quite
passionately is a violation...

1060
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,280
of the 14th Amendment
of the United States Constitution.

1061
01:21:21,356 --> 01:21:22,846
Of course.
That's brilliant.

1062
01:21:22,925 --> 01:21:24,586
What's-What's the
14th Amendment?

1063
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:28,118
The state can enforce no law which abridges
the privileges or immunities of a citizen.

1064
01:21:28,197 --> 01:21:32,327
Nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction
equal protection of the laws.

1065
01:21:32,401 --> 01:21:34,164
Which means what?

1066
01:21:34,236 --> 01:21:38,263
Which means they're supposed to treat you
the same as every motherfucker in this state.

1067
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,941
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Who?

1068
01:21:47,015 --> 01:21:49,279
D.A. Wilson.

1069
01:21:49,351 --> 01:21:51,342
Probably just observing.

1070
01:21:55,357 --> 01:21:59,020
All rise for the honorable
Judge Richard Resnick.

1071
01:22:00,329 --> 01:22:03,958
Okay. Let's get right down to business
this morning, shall we?

1072
01:22:07,569 --> 01:22:09,594
Mr. Lambert.

1073
01:22:09,671 --> 01:22:12,003
I'm prepared to approve
your motion to dismiss...

1074
01:22:12,074 --> 01:22:14,201
pending the testimony
of the mother.

1075
01:22:14,276 --> 01:22:16,540
Wait a minute.
What motion to dismiss?

1076
01:22:16,612 --> 01:22:18,477
Have you coordinated
with the D.A.'s office?

1077
01:22:18,547 --> 01:22:20,378
We have, Your Honor.

1078
01:22:20,449 --> 01:22:22,314
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

1079
01:22:22,384 --> 01:22:26,480
Your Honor, you're dismissing my clients'
case without any notice or explanation?

1080
01:22:26,555 --> 01:22:28,216
When did she get out?

1081
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:30,656
Your Honor, I'd like to
request a recess.

1082
01:22:30,726 --> 01:22:32,489
Request denied.

1083
01:22:33,996 --> 01:22:35,486
Excited about going home?

1084
01:22:38,934 --> 01:22:43,530
Miss Deleon, I received your petition
for reinstatement of custody.

1085
01:22:43,605 --> 01:22:45,698
Wait. She wants him back now?

1086
01:22:45,774 --> 01:22:49,073
Are you prepared to reassume
the responsibilities as the child's mother?

1087
01:22:52,447 --> 01:22:55,416
I need an answer- a yes or a no.

1088
01:22:58,453 --> 01:23:00,250
Yeah.

1089
01:23:07,562 --> 01:23:09,894
That's not my home.

1090
01:23:14,469 --> 01:23:16,403
That's not my home.

1091
01:23:17,105 --> 01:23:19,938
Miss Deleon has also filed a restraining
order on behalf of her son...

1092
01:23:20,008 --> 01:23:22,169
against Mr. Fleiger
and Mr. Donatello.

1093
01:23:22,244 --> 01:23:24,542
- What? Restraining order?
- The restraining order is granted.

1094
01:23:24,613 --> 01:23:26,205
- Your Honor-
- You gave him up!

1095
01:23:26,281 --> 01:23:27,771
- You signed them papers!
- Miss Deleon has served her sentence.

1096
01:23:27,849 --> 01:23:29,874
- Do you know what you're doing to that kid?
- She's served her sentence!

1097
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:32,852
- She's a junkie, Your Honor! - She now has the legal
right to petition for resumed custody of her child.

1098
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:35,116
You're gonna let her have her kid back
after how she done him wrong?

1099
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:38,057
- Miss Deleon, you're free to go.
- On what grounds?

1100
01:23:38,126 --> 01:23:41,584
- Your Honor-
- This hearing is over.

1101
01:23:41,663 --> 01:23:42,755
You can't do this!

1102
01:23:42,831 --> 01:23:45,425
You really need to consider what's
best for the child in this case!

1103
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:49,231
- This is a travesty of justice- a travesty!
- What did they promise you?

1104
01:23:49,304 --> 01:23:51,397
What did they promise you,
Marianna?

1105
01:23:51,473 --> 01:23:54,931
Do you know what you're doing
to that kid? This ain't right!

1106
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:58,946
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1107
01:24:06,722 --> 01:24:09,213
That's not- not my home.

1108
01:24:11,093 --> 01:24:13,084
It's not my home.

1109
01:24:18,467 --> 01:24:21,095
D.A.'s office brokered the deal
with her and Lambert.

1110
01:24:21,169 --> 01:24:23,501
They got her paroled early...

1111
01:24:23,572 --> 01:24:27,269
as long as she was willing to fill out
the petition for custody.

1112
01:24:32,781 --> 01:24:34,772
So what do we do now?

1113
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:38,479
Nothing you can do. Mother wants
the kid, mother gets the kid.

1114
01:24:38,553 --> 01:24:40,987
Ain't a court in the world
that'll give that kid to you.

1115
01:24:42,491 --> 01:24:44,823
So go home,
get on with your lives.

1116
01:24:44,893 --> 01:24:47,885
It's gonna hurt like hell at first,
but time's a great healer.

1117
01:24:49,731 --> 01:24:52,199
If you're lucky, maybe the kid'll
come see you once he's grown up...

1118
01:24:52,267 --> 01:24:53,632
and away from the
mother's control.

1119
01:24:55,837 --> 01:24:58,101
There is no justice, is there?

1120
01:25:01,009 --> 01:25:03,204
You went to law school,
Mr. Fleiger.

1121
01:25:03,278 --> 01:25:06,270
I'm surprised that's not
the first thing they taught you.

1122
01:25:09,718 --> 01:25:12,209
That don't mean we stop
fighting for what's right.

1123
01:25:34,743 --> 01:25:38,076
# Will ya be my girl? #

1124
01:25:38,146 --> 01:25:43,379
# Be my girl #

1125
01:25:43,452 --> 01:25:45,886
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

1126
01:25:45,954 --> 01:25:48,286
Wait, man. We can't do
this in front of him, man.

1127
01:25:48,356 --> 01:25:49,846
Come on.

1128
01:25:49,925 --> 01:25:52,257
Go out in the hallway
till I tell you come back in.

1129
01:25:54,262 --> 01:25:56,526
Did you hear what I said,
you fucking retard?

1130
01:25:56,598 --> 01:25:58,623
Get out! Go!

1131
01:26:00,168 --> 01:26:01,658
Go!

1132
01:26:01,736 --> 01:26:03,829
Marco, babe.

1133
01:26:03,905 --> 01:26:06,533
Will you go out in the hall
for a few minutes, baby...

1134
01:26:06,608 --> 01:26:11,671
until Mommy's- until Mommy
calls you back, babe, okay?

1135
01:27:25,921 --> 01:27:31,882
# They say everythng
can be replaced #

1136
01:27:33,828 --> 01:27:39,061
# They say every distance
is not near #

1137
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:48,066
# I remember every face #

1138
01:27:49,210 --> 01:27:55,012
# Of every man who
put me here #

1139
01:27:56,551 --> 01:28:03,286
# I see my light come shining #

1140
01:28:04,392 --> 01:28:08,795
# From the west down
to the east #

1141
01:28:11,433 --> 01:28:15,130
# Any day now #

1142
01:28:15,203 --> 01:28:19,367
# Any day now #

1143
01:28:19,441 --> 01:28:24,344
# I shall be released #

1144
01:28:42,130 --> 01:28:44,860
Enclosed, please find
a newspaper artcle.

1145
01:28:46,167 --> 01:28:49,432
You might have seen it when it was
published, although I doubt it.

1146
01:28:49,504 --> 01:28:52,405
It was buried deep
in the middle of the paper...

1147
01:28:52,474 --> 01:28:56,638
not nearly as important as the front-page
stores about rising gas prices.

1148
01:28:56,711 --> 01:28:59,646
Or presidental politics.

1149
01:28:59,714 --> 01:29:04,879
Just a few brieflines about a mentally
handicapped kid named Marco.

1150
01:29:04,953 --> 01:29:07,217
Who died all alone
under a bridge.

1151
01:29:07,288 --> 01:29:11,019
After trying to find his way home
for almost three days.

1152
01:29:12,193 --> 01:29:14,923
Since you never got
to meet him in person.

1153
01:29:14,996 --> 01:29:18,363
And since this article
is short on details.

1154
01:29:18,433 --> 01:29:21,698
I wanted you to know who
Marco really was.

1155
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:26,366
He was a sweet kid and
smart and funny.

1156
01:29:27,175 --> 01:29:29,803
He had a smile that could
light up a room.

1157
01:29:30,979 --> 01:29:32,810
He loved junk food.

1158
01:29:32,881 --> 01:29:35,543
Chocolate doughnuts
were his drug of choice.

1159
01:29:35,617 --> 01:29:38,017
He was the world's
greatest disco dancer.

1160
01:29:39,387 --> 01:29:42,322
And he liked to have a story
told to him every night.

1161
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:45,188
As long as the story had
a happy ending.

1162
01:29:46,327 --> 01:29:49,125
Marco loved a happy ending.

1163
01:29:51,366 --> 01:29:53,994
# They tell ya,
they tell ya #

1164
01:29:54,069 --> 01:29:58,096
# Every man must
have protection #

1165
01:29:58,173 --> 01:30:00,334
# And then they tell ya
They tell ya #

1166
01:30:00,408 --> 01:30:05,277
# That every man must fall #

1167
01:30:05,346 --> 01:30:12,650
# I swear, I swear
I see my own reflection #

1168
01:30:12,721 --> 01:30:19,320
# Far beyond these walls #

1169
01:30:19,394 --> 01:30:21,328
That's right!

1170
01:30:21,396 --> 01:30:26,265
# I see my light come shining
Come shining #

1171
01:30:26,334 --> 01:30:31,533
# Come shining from the west
down to the east #

1172
01:30:31,606 --> 01:30:34,939
# And, oh, my God #

1173
01:30:35,009 --> 01:30:38,274
# Any day now #

1174
01:30:38,346 --> 01:30:40,177
# Any day now #

1175
01:30:40,248 --> 01:30:42,409
# Any day now #

1176
01:30:42,484 --> 01:30:48,389
# I shall be released #

1177
01:31:03,705 --> 01:31:09,610
# Yes, I see my light
come shining #

1178
01:31:11,446 --> 01:31:16,577
# From the west down
to the east #

1179
01:31:19,854 --> 01:31:21,515
# And I swear #

1180
01:31:23,024 --> 01:31:24,514
# I swear #

1181
01:31:26,327 --> 01:31:28,761
# I swear, my love #

1182
01:31:29,764 --> 01:31:39,503
# We shall be released #

1183
01:32:12,841 --> 01:32:16,402
# I can't say good- bye #

1184
01:32:16,477 --> 01:32:19,640
# To you yet #

1185
01:32:20,648 --> 01:32:24,880
# Even though you have to go #

1186
01:32:24,953 --> 01:32:30,949
# And get your jacket #

1187
01:32:31,025 --> 01:32:34,688
# I can't say good- bye #

1188
01:32:34,762 --> 01:32:38,596
# To you now #

1189
01:32:38,666 --> 01:32:41,965
# Even though you
have to go #

1190
01:32:42,036 --> 01:32:44,903
# And throw #

1191
01:32:44,973 --> 01:32:51,537
# The metaphorical blanket #

1192
01:32:51,613 --> 01:32:57,813
# Over the symbolical fire #

1193
01:32:57,886 --> 01:33:04,485
# Of my all-too-practical #

1194
01:33:04,559 --> 01:33:08,393
# Heart #

1195
01:33:11,633 --> 01:33:14,124
# I remember #

1196
01:33:14,202 --> 01:33:19,230
# Holding your hand #

1197
01:33:20,408 --> 01:33:25,243
# And not wanting to let go #

1198
01:33:25,313 --> 01:33:31,809
# But I understand #

1199
01:33:31,886 --> 01:33:37,882
# Then asking you
up to my room #

1200
01:33:38,993 --> 01:33:43,487
# And then walking up alone #

1201
01:33:43,564 --> 01:33:48,558
# Away from you #

1202
01:33:48,636 --> 01:33:54,404
# But stll, who knows? #

1203
01:33:54,475 --> 01:34:02,041
# Perhaps the metaphorical blanket #

1204
01:34:02,116 --> 01:34:09,613
# Was then set on symbolical fire #

1205
01:34:09,691 --> 01:34:15,027
# By my all-too-practical #

1206
01:34:15,096 --> 01:34:21,262
# Ungullible, indestructible #

1207
01:34:21,336 --> 01:34:28,902
# And untouchable #

1208
01:34:28,977 --> 01:34:33,141
# Heart #

1209
01:34:36,184 --> 01:34:40,018
# I can't say good- bye #

1210
01:34:40,088 --> 01:34:47,620
# To you yet #
