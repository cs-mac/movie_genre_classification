1
00:00:16,028 --> 00:00:18,528
Anonyma

2
00:00:25,697 --> 00:00:29,588
A Woman in Berlin

3
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:37,264
Who would've thought that?

4
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:41,866
On April 16th 1945 the time had come.

5
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:46,269
The Russian army had surrounded Berlin

6
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:49,068
and now they were heading
towards the Reichstag.

7
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:55,269
On this day,
you could see the sun behind the clouds,

8
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:59,350
and the smell of lilac
wafted through all the smoke.

9
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:05,991
How to start?

10
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:09,069
How to find the right words?

11
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:14,268
I've been a journalist,
I've traveled 12 countries.

12
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:16,606
Been living in Moscow,
Paris and London.

13
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:18,987
I really liked to stay
in Paris and London.

14
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:25,226
I decided to come back.
I wanted to be part of it.

15
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:32,309
My name doesn't matter.

16
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:36,424
I am one of the many who fervently
believed in our country's future.

17
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:40,149
Doubts?
Only weak persons had doubts.

18
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:42,613
Warsaw, Brussels, Paris.
We're always winning.

19
00:01:42,614 --> 00:01:45,106
The Russians don't have a leader.

20
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:47,106
When they finally come to their senses,

21
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,702
we are already knocking at
their front door in Moscow.

22
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:55,790
Pardon our pushiness,
but it's war after all.

23
00:01:55,911 --> 00:01:57,445
Gerd hated railway stations.

24
00:01:57,446 --> 00:02:00,348
When he left, the sound of
his boots filled the house.

25
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:04,665
We were certain to do the right thing,

26
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,717
we breathed the same
air as everybody else.

27
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:07,509
We were part of this.

28
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:10,576
And then he takes off my coat and says:

29
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:13,347
The Russians have no idea
what's coming towards them.

30
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:18,788
So we were heading towards the
Sorbonne and chatting away in French.

31
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:22,790
He thought that I was one
of those tall blond Swedes.

32
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:26,790
Then I made a double step
to match my stride to his.

33
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:30,870
That's when he stopped and said:
"Ah, a daughter of the Fuhrer"

34
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:35,220
That was the end of the acquaintance.
What a pity.

35
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:40,150
Hold on. I... I'd like to...
Stop the music, please.

36
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:47,382
I would like for us all
to share this moment,

37
00:02:47,511 --> 00:02:51,060
this wonderful evening,
with our husbands

38
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:55,110
who are stationed
somewhere all over Europe.

39
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:14,142
Get lost!

40
00:03:14,271 --> 00:03:16,023
Run, run!

41
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:17,500
Get away!

42
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:23,219
Go away!
Houses on the right. Fan out.

43
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:36,107
Come here, damn it!

44
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:39,065
Mummy, where are you?

45
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:42,384
Come on. Hurry.

46
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:08,671
Away. Go away.

47
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:13,663
Open fire, reload grenade.

48
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:16,587
...and fire!

49
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:24,219
Fire!

50
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,620
Shit.

51
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:32,820
- Wait for me.
- Watch out! Heads down.

52
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:36,744
- There you are.
- Stop! Wait for me.

53
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:37,860
Watch out!

54
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,100
No!

55
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:52,390
No uniforms, no weapons,
or it's martial law.

56
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:00,504
Felix, where are you?

57
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:04,470
Felix?

58
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:09,542
- Where the hell is he? Felix?
- Not a single order.

59
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:13,670
No messages, nothing at all.
Nobody gives a shit about us.

60
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:18,110
Felix? Lenchen, Lenchen?
Where are you, damn it?

61
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:22,386
In Wedding district, they are already
showing their toddlers to the Russians.

62
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:23,701
Russian pigs.

63
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:27,983
That were the book dealers.
They sometimes speak French.

64
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:33,343
And that's the pharmacist's widow.

65
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:38,261
Her husband once cured Minister
Hindenburg's headache.

66
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:39,268
That's over.

67
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:43,067
Now you step on the face
and the arms of a dead woman

68
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:46,469
only to get a glass of jelly.

69
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:54,299
That's the quiet Mrs. Binder.
Musician. Her husband is MIA.

70
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,909
Can someone help?
She is suffocating.

71
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:07,990
Look at me. Look at me!

72
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:12,220
I will write all of this down,
I will report it.

73
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:16,269
Gerd, and you shall read it.

74
00:06:16,591 --> 00:06:19,424
May I offer you something?

75
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:22,470
Thank you.

76
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,949
From Silesia.
She won't make it.

77
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:19,787
Go, go, go!
Go down there, quick!

78
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:27,789
- Mummy?
- Don't be afraid, I am here.

79
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:34,108
They're coming.

80
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,499
Halt!

81
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:28,461
Attention, attention.
To all the residents of this street.

82
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:33,380
All fire arms have to be
turned in immediately.

83
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,624
This is the last warning.

84
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:40,551
Attention, attention.

85
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:43,704
This is the last warning.

86
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:37,832
Attack!

87
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:52,828
Upstairs!

88
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,218
All the way upstairs!

89
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:10,852
Go away! Not now!

90
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:11,986
Attention!

91
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:43,368
I... I have...

92
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:04,132
Careful!

93
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,581
Comrade Colonel.

94
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:09,873
The troops have almost
reached Potsdam station.

95
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:14,322
But the order was to go towards
the government district!

96
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:19,798
Understood,
Comrade Colonel.

97
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:25,707
We'll stay here.

98
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:27,707
Major! I thought we were
going to the Reichstag.

99
00:11:28,302 --> 00:11:29,802
No Reichstag? But why not,
we are so close.

100
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:32,876
Screw it,
we are not staying here!

101
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:35,136
That's an order!

102
00:11:36,186 --> 00:11:39,186
Retreat!
Secure our flank!

103
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:43,209
Understood?

104
00:11:47,216 --> 00:11:49,216
Soldiers?
Officers?

105
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:52,241
Weapons?

106
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,760
I said: Soldiers?
Officers?

107
00:11:56,871 --> 00:12:00,307
They will see soon enough.

108
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,389
Anybody got weapons?
Hand them over.

109
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Get out!
One person at a time.

110
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:21,053
Get out, all of you!
Move it!

111
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,259
- Russian filth!
- Up!

112
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:31,092
What... do you want?

113
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:38,586
Russian?

114
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:41,372
Yes.

115
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:48,105
Russian!

116
00:12:49,111 --> 00:12:50,385
Come.

117
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:51,786
Come.

118
00:12:53,151 --> 00:12:54,220
Eat.

119
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:59,387
War kaput.

120
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:01,266
Woman.

121
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:03,986
Come! Eat.

122
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:07,547
War kaput, woman.

123
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:08,605
Come on.

124
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:11,828
No fear.

125
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:13,942
No fear.

126
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:26,103
We will not die here.

127
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,947
Bravo, come, come.

128
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:51,264
Don't be afraid.

129
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:53,426
Come.

130
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:56,109
Don't shiver!

131
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:58,344
Good! Come.

132
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:03,667
Hey, cuties!
Come over here.

133
00:14:05,871 --> 00:14:08,704
You be nice and you'll
get something to eat.

134
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:16,067
Potatoes. Very good.

135
00:14:58,751 --> 00:15:00,707
May I?

136
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,899
Does anybody know
how this thing works?

137
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:35,791
You, Ukrainian,
do you know it?

138
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:39,380
There they are,
our Russian liberators.

139
00:15:39,511 --> 00:15:41,388
Full of joy.

140
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:46,107
It seems they can hardly believe
that they've made it this far.

141
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:48,703
I know them,
their sandals and villages.

142
00:15:48,704 --> 00:15:52,101
Their rapidly constructed new
buildings they are so proud of.

143
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:53,551
Stop!

144
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:56,469
They are without any constraints.

145
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:57,546
Don't move,
asshole!

146
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,709
Leave her.

147
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,224
Get lost.

148
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:18,031
Urine.
Why don't you use urine?

149
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,103
That's enough!

150
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:23,300
No, seriously...

151
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:25,547
Your urine is much too old.

152
00:16:26,831 --> 00:16:30,107
Back in Leningrad, I put my general
back on his feet with urine...

153
00:16:31,711 --> 00:16:33,303
You storyteller!

154
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:35,299
It's true.

155
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:43,109
What are they doing?

156
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:46,786
Please!

157
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:48,626
Please!

158
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:52,261
Have you husband?

159
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:55,467
A husband and two children.

160
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:03,224
Come anyway.

161
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:08,461
Quick, quick!
Let me through! Let me through!

162
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,864
No, no, you pigs.

163
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:17,710
You pigs! No!

164
00:17:18,911 --> 00:17:22,870
- You don't belong here.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

165
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:23,930
Stop.

166
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:27,470
You filthy pigs, leave me alone!
Come on, don't be so prude.

167
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:31,470
Most fellow countrymen adeptly
saved their own hides.

168
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:35,106
The girl from Silesia was easy prey.

169
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:36,546
Leave!

170
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:39,867
Mrs. Hitler.

171
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:45,309
You slut! Where to?

172
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:46,949
To the Fuhrer?

173
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:53,899
Here. Quick.
Penthouse to the right. Quick! Go!

174
00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:59,310
Take this and go! Go!

175
00:17:59,591 --> 00:18:00,626
Come.

176
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:08,783
You speak Russian.
You can't abandon me like that.

177
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:16,866
Soldier!

178
00:18:23,631 --> 00:18:25,747
Why are you taking a woman...

179
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:28,701
who doesn't want you?

180
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:31,702
Willing women are unclean.

181
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:54,750
Open the door! Open it!

182
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:57,829
Open the door,
you bastards! Open it!

183
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,582
Not here.

184
00:20:01,511 --> 00:20:04,469
- Where?
- Almost there.

185
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:13,983
Stop! Stay where you are!

186
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:19,265
Hey you.

187
00:20:19,391 --> 00:20:20,744
Shoo shoo!

188
00:20:26,151 --> 00:20:27,584
Commander...

189
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:29,590
I am looking for
the commanding officer.

190
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:31,343
What's up?

191
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:34,349
Are you in charge here?

192
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:37,464
I... we need help.

193
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,782
Are you in charge here?

194
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:50,183
There are many in charge here.
Everybody is in charge.

195
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:52,786
Which one do you want?

196
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:57,550
Major, sir...

197
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:01,711
We need your help...

198
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,703
Our men are all healthy and clean.

199
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:32,987
Mrs. Hitler.

200
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,584
Our country is finished.

201
00:21:37,591 --> 00:21:41,186
Gerd, do you remember your first words?

202
00:21:41,311 --> 00:21:46,590
"Give me 30 minutes and you will
never want to leave me again."

203
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:50,422
God almighty.

204
00:22:50,271 --> 00:22:54,150
- That is the back corridor.
- The widow offered me a place to stay.

205
00:22:54,271 --> 00:22:59,345
She took me by the hand and just led me
inside her undestroyed apartment.

206
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:08,063
- I gratefully accepted the offer.
- You can stay here for a while.

207
00:23:08,431 --> 00:23:14,267
Moving places was easy: a blouse,
a few books and notebooks.

208
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:18,590
- You are welcome to stay.
- Thank you, I'll take your offer.

209
00:23:30,751 --> 00:23:33,584
Take good care of yourself.

210
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:42,350
In spite of everything, it would have
been good to have a closer look around.

211
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:48,065
But then, we never know everything,
so that's how the story continued.

212
00:24:02,911 --> 00:24:05,744
I guess it has been
really nice here once.

213
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:11,141
How did you find me here?

214
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:15,549
I searched every cellar.

215
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:33,147
How often?

216
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:40,660
Often.

217
00:24:46,511 --> 00:24:47,864
The shores are clad in green,

218
00:24:47,911 --> 00:24:50,379
the trees are breathing
freely and deeply

219
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:52,661
We bravely stride on and on,

220
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,021
towards the final assault
in this war!

221
00:24:56,831 --> 00:24:58,742
Our path was long to reach
this day in May.

222
00:24:58,871 --> 00:25:01,260
It has cost us much
strength and courage.

223
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:03,706
But now we are free again!

224
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:06,749
We proudly take our positions.

225
00:25:07,871 --> 00:25:08,986
Greetings, May.

226
00:25:10,831 --> 00:25:15,426
Our soldiers and a few American weapons,
and those would be history.

227
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:15,780
Yeah.

228
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:31,103
Yesterday at the water pump,
it was my turn,

229
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:32,349
a guy approaches me,

230
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:38,147
two Iron Crosses and one German
Cross in Gold on his chest,

231
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:42,230
and he gallantly takes the buckets
out of my hands. And I say:

232
00:25:42,351 --> 00:25:48,347
"How do I deserve this honor?"
and he says "We can't give up now"

233
00:25:48,951 --> 00:25:52,546
"because if the Russian
even remotely does to us

234
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:56,550
"what we did to them
during the last four years,

235
00:25:57,271 --> 00:26:00,820
"in the near future there won't
be any living Germans left."

236
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:06,989
"In the near future"?
Nobody talks like that.

237
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:19,303
Hey you Slavs!
We're in Berlin! We made it!

238
00:26:31,871 --> 00:26:36,547
How do you say: Excuse me,
do you have a dictionary?

239
00:26:37,511 --> 00:26:41,584
I guess he doesn't need a
dictionary for what he wants.

240
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:57,180
Lenchen!

241
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:10,507
Come with us!

242
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:13,061
Come where?

243
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:15,300
Lenchen!

244
00:27:15,431 --> 00:27:19,219
During the next few days,
our house was raided day and night.

245
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:21,103
Lenchen!

246
00:27:21,591 --> 00:27:25,789
One woman hanged herself,
another one was shot to death.

247
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:28,061
None of us was spared.

248
00:27:28,191 --> 00:27:31,149
Every emotion is dead.

249
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:32,620
Hey, you from Berlin!

250
00:27:32,711 --> 00:27:35,020
Over here! Upstairs.
What kept you so long?

251
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,148
Berlin is ours.
Germany is ours.

252
00:27:38,511 --> 00:27:39,944
Forever!

253
00:27:40,431 --> 00:27:41,944
Lenchen.

254
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:47,229
- What have you got there?
- A map.

255
00:27:54,871 --> 00:27:56,389
Move it! Faster.

256
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:58,189
You go left,
I go right.

257
00:28:06,831 --> 00:28:09,140
Where are you going?
Come to us.

258
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:15,544
Come.

259
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:21,822
Wake up, damned of the earth,
who are living in hunger and misery.

260
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:26,103
Justice is about to burst through
like glowing magma in a volcano.

261
00:28:43,551 --> 00:28:46,543
You just go away, away!

262
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:57,950
I!

263
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:13,471
I...

264
00:29:13,571 --> 00:29:15,223
...love...

265
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:17,747
...you.

266
00:29:49,431 --> 00:29:51,422
Good day.

267
00:30:04,431 --> 00:30:06,387
Please, don't!

268
00:30:15,151 --> 00:30:18,461
My pretty one.
I'll be back.

269
00:30:21,591 --> 00:30:23,786
My pretty one...

270
00:31:10,191 --> 00:31:12,466
I am a young man...

271
00:31:17,191 --> 00:31:19,546
You scared me.

272
00:31:53,151 --> 00:31:55,984
We will survive all this,

273
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:01,381
by any means necessary.

274
00:32:43,951 --> 00:32:45,509
Where to?

275
00:32:46,351 --> 00:32:47,784
We're here.

276
00:32:55,151 --> 00:32:56,345
Who are you looking for?

277
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:02,104
- Kommandatura?
- Kommandatura.

278
00:33:05,271 --> 00:33:09,822
So where are they now,
our saviors, all the great armies?

279
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:14,185
In the past, war and dying
was a male exclusive thing.

280
00:33:14,186 --> 00:33:16,227
But those times are long gone.

281
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:20,819
Damned Russians. Officer, General,
Commander, doesn't matter.

282
00:33:20,951 --> 00:33:23,909
I take everyone,
as high in rank as possible.

283
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:27,069
From now on,
I will decide who gets me.

284
00:33:29,111 --> 00:33:33,741
No, no. Get out of there, will you?
This is still my bed.

285
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:38,270
You can protect us from over there
on the couch, see? Protect.

286
00:33:38,711 --> 00:33:42,260
Hm? See.
You don't have to get under my blanket.

287
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:46,504
Do you understand?

288
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:24,700
Where is the Major?

289
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:26,389
Wait.

290
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:32,346
Hey, Miss.

291
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,029
Who are you looking for?

292
00:34:36,271 --> 00:34:37,391
You, blondie.

293
00:34:37,491 --> 00:34:39,700
Why are you looking so stern?

294
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:48,779
You!

295
00:34:48,871 --> 00:34:51,943
Could you soap my back, huh?

296
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:23,784
Who do you want to talk to?

297
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:27,542
You.

298
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:34,379
Dismissed.

299
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:52,464
May I have a seat?

300
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,220
No.

301
00:36:08,711 --> 00:36:14,866
Yesterday our house has been occupied
and many women have been raped.

302
00:36:18,991 --> 00:36:22,267
I know nothing of that.

303
00:36:25,151 --> 00:36:28,109
It is your duty to help us.

304
00:36:37,551 --> 00:36:38,540
Who?

305
00:36:39,951 --> 00:36:41,066
My people...

306
00:36:41,191 --> 00:36:42,863
...or yours?

307
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:47,820
Me.

308
00:36:58,911 --> 00:37:02,506
That's just a few minutes.
That's nothing to worry about.

309
00:37:14,071 --> 00:37:16,631
It's pointless.

310
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:22,860
You Russian? Looking what?

311
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:26,784
Who are you looking for?
Commanding officer?

312
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:32,469
They are all with their women.
But I can do it too.

313
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:34,504
Lieutenant, sir.

314
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:35,990
May I have a word?

315
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:41,349
Some of the balconies in
our house are mined.

316
00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:44,459
Could you help?

317
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:55,820
Pity.

318
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:01,223
Miss!

319
00:38:06,591 --> 00:38:08,741
You, I, evening?

320
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:10,980
Hm?

321
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:18,867
I Anatol.

322
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:22,782
You, I, simple as that, huh?

323
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:28,061
At this moment I made a vow,

324
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:32,742
that nothing and nobody would
touch me, no matter what happened.

325
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:37,023
Come in.
Follow.

326
00:38:37,471 --> 00:38:39,701
That's where I live.

327
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:41,861
Come on in.

328
00:38:43,831 --> 00:38:47,790
You need to go now, understand?
Go back to your buddies.

329
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:53,900
Well...

330
00:38:55,191 --> 00:38:57,751
That's my husband.

331
00:38:59,191 --> 00:39:02,024
Don't you understand?

332
00:39:03,111 --> 00:39:05,386
My husband.

333
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:09,031
You must understand that.

334
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:12,541
All humans are bad.

335
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:20,382
I never get what he's saying.
He just won't leave.

336
00:39:27,511 --> 00:39:30,469
What are doing?
That is mahogany.

337
00:39:30,831 --> 00:39:33,550
Relax.
Go into the kitchen.

338
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:38,510
To the 215th Rifles!

339
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:42,391
To victory!

340
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:43,790
To us.

341
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:48,907
I Charkov!

342
00:39:49,231 --> 00:39:50,311
He's from Charkov.

343
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:54,230
Charkov! Ah!
I'm industrial accountant in books.

344
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:56,382
An accountant?
You're kidding me.

345
00:39:56,551 --> 00:40:00,464
I accountant! You accountant!
We accountant!

346
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:05,780
Everything fine.

347
00:40:05,831 --> 00:40:08,265
That's life, you see?

348
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:09,620
You, pretty.

349
00:40:10,311 --> 00:40:14,270
Ain't they great guys, those Russians?
They are full of juice and strength.

350
00:40:14,631 --> 00:40:18,226
The fucking war is really
pissing me off.

351
00:40:18,871 --> 00:40:19,940
True.

352
00:40:20,311 --> 00:40:22,222
When I get back to Charkov,

353
00:40:22,311 --> 00:40:24,461
I'll marry, build a house,

354
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,223
get children.
I am working in the kolkhoz.

355
00:40:26,311 --> 00:40:28,620
and you, I will
take you as my accountant.

356
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:31,621
Are you a professional soldier?

357
00:40:32,231 --> 00:40:33,631
No...

358
00:40:33,751 --> 00:40:35,781
I, dairy.

359
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:39,111
Milk! Milk. Cow.

360
00:40:41,511 --> 00:40:47,222
- How very interesting.
- Interesting! Milk and milk.

361
00:40:49,551 --> 00:40:51,109
That's bullshit.

362
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:52,830
Look at this.

363
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:55,230
My trophies.

364
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:57,789
That's nothing.

365
00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:59,025
Here.

366
00:40:59,711 --> 00:41:02,020
THAT is a trophy.

367
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:03,790
That's not a trophy.

368
00:41:03,951 --> 00:41:05,982
Have a look at this.

369
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:07,469
That...

370
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:10,702
...that is a REAL trophy.

371
00:41:11,631 --> 00:41:13,110
An original.

372
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:15,463
My present to all the ladies.

373
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:17,388
To kiss and marvel about.

374
00:41:19,231 --> 00:41:20,551
Where toilet?

375
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,945
- The toilet's on the corridor.
- Thanks.

376
00:41:49,991 --> 00:41:52,824
Would you like something to eat?

377
00:41:56,271 --> 00:41:57,465
You.

378
00:42:31,951 --> 00:42:33,464
You fancy my dick?

379
00:42:33,631 --> 00:42:35,383
Doesn't matter which one.

380
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:36,950
Dick is dick.

381
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,467
Why Russia?

382
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:50,347
What were you doing there,
you sons of a bitch?

383
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:52,947
Why Russia?

384
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:06,350
That is Major...
afraid I forgot his name already.

385
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:19,788
He is battalion commander. They don't
have commandants, only commanders.

386
00:43:20,071 --> 00:43:25,225
Did you know that they study
German as first foreign language?

387
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:30,262
Well, it needs a war for us to
get this bit of information.

388
00:43:30,391 --> 00:43:33,224
Can I do something for you?

389
00:43:39,511 --> 00:43:42,821
Hey Mongol. Have you come
all the way from Moscow

390
00:43:42,951 --> 00:43:45,943
just to get some water
for a German woman?

391
00:43:46,031 --> 00:43:49,182
Or is our major bathing in rose essence?

392
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:01,747
Made in Germany...

393
00:44:02,711 --> 00:44:04,588
I am taking care of the Major.

394
00:44:08,191 --> 00:44:10,231
Go now.
I'll catch up later.

395
00:44:10,531 --> 00:44:12,062
Go.

396
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:14,984
Go, Mongol, go!

397
00:44:15,311 --> 00:44:19,224
Move it. Faster!
Go, go, go!

398
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:21,308
Move it already.
Faster.

399
00:44:27,311 --> 00:44:32,749
A bomb hit the garden of the neighbors
and the whole house was rubble.

400
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:38,305
And it blasted the fattened
sow up till under the roof.

401
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:42,749
Well, obviously it was spoiled.

402
00:44:49,871 --> 00:44:51,384
Here.

403
00:44:54,711 --> 00:44:56,030
Give it to me.

404
00:45:05,391 --> 00:45:06,790
My apologies...

405
00:45:06,911 --> 00:45:08,424
for my unsuitable behavior.

406
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:09,984
Dismissed.

407
00:45:34,711 --> 00:45:35,905
Berlin is ours.

408
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:37,829
There.

409
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:52,900
I have told everybody
that they needed to go.

410
00:45:56,471 --> 00:45:59,304
May I sit down?

411
00:46:06,911 --> 00:46:09,471
Come here.

412
00:46:10,631 --> 00:46:12,622
As you wish.

413
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:47,580
No?

414
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:17,021
The raping process continues.
They are everywhere.

415
00:47:18,111 --> 00:47:20,420
In every apartment.

416
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:23,748
We are Russian property now.
At their service.

417
00:47:24,031 --> 00:47:27,785
But us women, we will need to
keep our mouths shut,

418
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:32,114
or no man will ever want to touch
us again when this is all over.

419
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:32,302
Poor Germany.

420
00:47:41,271 --> 00:47:44,183
German fighters: sit!

421
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:24,624
Four. Four women.

422
00:48:26,031 --> 00:48:28,386
The whole of Berlin is a brothel.

423
00:48:33,191 --> 00:48:34,829
Here.
That's what I've found.

424
00:48:35,151 --> 00:48:36,789
They've got everything.

425
00:48:37,071 --> 00:48:38,823
They've got jewelry
and money and houses.

426
00:48:39,231 --> 00:48:41,426
And yet they go to war!
Scoundrels.

427
00:48:42,151 --> 00:48:43,869
Enough.

428
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,704
What do I care about them?

429
00:48:51,951 --> 00:48:56,547
Sometimes I think that from now on
I could endure everything imaginable,

430
00:48:56,671 --> 00:48:59,108
as long as it comes from the outside

431
00:48:59,109 --> 00:49:02,223
and not from deep within
my treacherous heart.

432
00:49:04,431 --> 00:49:09,983
I am swell.
And my Russian is improving.

433
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:23,144
- Is there anyone?
- Nobody.

434
00:49:43,111 --> 00:49:44,464
A welcome committee.

435
00:49:45,951 --> 00:49:48,704
Madam, I brought you a cavalier.

436
00:49:52,911 --> 00:49:55,744
Anatol is a gypsy.

437
00:49:56,391 --> 00:50:00,350
Comes and goes as he pleases.
No protection.

438
00:50:00,951 --> 00:50:03,101
My sun.

439
00:50:16,071 --> 00:50:18,141
Do you think...

440
00:50:18,471 --> 00:50:22,020
Do you think the Fuhrer has forsaken us?

441
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:24,461
No. Never.

442
00:50:31,951 --> 00:50:33,066
Here.

443
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,591
Is that all?

444
00:50:43,511 --> 00:50:46,344
My head is aching like crazy.

445
00:51:00,471 --> 00:51:04,384
- Where are you going?
- I'll get you some food.

446
00:51:04,511 --> 00:51:07,548
If that's the last thing
I'll do in my life.

447
00:51:15,791 --> 00:51:17,782
What about the Reichstag?
I don't give a shit about it.

448
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:20,305
Fuck the Reichstag.

449
00:51:22,711 --> 00:51:26,101
Then he grabs me
and throws me on the bed.

450
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:32,626
And suddenly, he gets so boring,
like a lapdog.

451
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:38,745
Later, he complimented me.

452
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:42,784
He said:
"Ukrainian women like this."

453
00:51:44,191 --> 00:51:46,751
"You, like this."

454
00:51:52,511 --> 00:51:56,186
He had really bad breath.

455
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:12,541
- Oh. It's you.
- Good morning. We bring breakfast.

456
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:17,185
The next morning, a few blocks
away the war was still raging,

457
00:52:17,311 --> 00:52:21,270
- the Major came with all his troops.
- Good morning.

458
00:52:22,271 --> 00:52:27,550
The widow, who loved bacon,
was busy as a bee.

459
00:52:29,231 --> 00:52:33,463
Mr. Eckart, our man of the home guard,
was all too happy to surrender.

460
00:52:34,423 --> 00:52:35,423
This way.

461
00:52:37,231 --> 00:52:40,268
- Russian horse.
- What's that?

462
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:44,440
Sugar. We have sugar!

463
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:47,660
And bacon and salami
and bread and butter.

464
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:50,908
Great joy,
but not for everybody.

465
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:56,429
Then came the cavalry.

466
00:52:56,511 --> 00:52:59,150
Fluttering coats, sabres ahead,
horses snuffling.

467
00:52:59,231 --> 00:53:00,380
When a horse is charging,

468
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:03,150
that's an incredible force.

469
00:53:03,311 --> 00:53:06,348
The whole avalanche is
charging against the tank,

470
00:53:06,551 --> 00:53:09,668
against the artillery,
against all the machine guns -

471
00:53:09,831 --> 00:53:11,981
All kaput.

472
00:53:13,551 --> 00:53:14,779
You've had much more troops,

473
00:53:14,911 --> 00:53:16,629
but they just couldn't stand it.

474
00:53:16,751 --> 00:53:18,946
They dropped their weapons and fled.

475
00:53:19,047 --> 00:53:20,947
German soldiers, bah!

476
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:24,224
Don't be so insensitive.

477
00:53:24,311 --> 00:53:25,300
We didn't start this war!

478
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:26,791
Sit down.

479
00:53:26,891 --> 00:53:28,463
And stop insulting our host.

480
00:53:28,591 --> 00:53:30,070
Enough.

481
00:53:30,351 --> 00:53:32,307
I Caucasus.

482
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:34,109
Caucasus, understand?

483
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,867
Big mountain, so beautiful!

484
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:40,190
Sun, blue sky.

485
00:53:41,071 --> 00:53:43,790
Nice dancing with women.

486
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:47,941
As sweet as grapes.

487
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:51,305
And Pushkin.
He had to live there in exile.

488
00:53:52,151 --> 00:53:54,824
Pushkin? Doesn't matter.
I want to go home.

489
00:53:55,311 --> 00:53:57,267
Go home, understand?

490
00:53:58,031 --> 00:54:00,181
I want to see my children
and my wife.

491
00:54:15,671 --> 00:54:17,389
See?
And all you can think of is "Pushkin."

492
00:54:19,711 --> 00:54:22,020
I want my wife.

493
00:54:22,031 --> 00:54:24,989
My wife. Understand?

494
00:54:29,431 --> 00:54:32,264
What do you know about fascism?

495
00:54:33,111 --> 00:54:34,669
Fascism?

496
00:54:41,191 --> 00:54:45,742
From ancient Rome, Latin "fascio", means a
"bundle of sticks", figuratively a league.

497
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:49,980
To our host.

498
00:54:50,071 --> 00:54:50,991
Right.

499
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:53,300
To a woman who is
quite obviously very bright.

500
00:54:53,631 --> 00:54:56,065
Just like you right now.
Very bright.

501
00:54:56,951 --> 00:54:58,430
But I am not a woman!

502
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:01,629
To German-Russian friendship!

503
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:05,229
Hurray!

504
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,109
Everybody upstairs, quick!

505
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,905
Hurry! Quick!

506
00:55:17,111 --> 00:55:19,386
Search all the apartments.

507
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:33,861
Out. Out!

508
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:41,986
You goddamn bastard!
You dick! You fucking dick!

509
00:55:44,351 --> 00:55:45,830
Stop it.

510
00:55:46,671 --> 00:55:47,945
Enough!

511
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:51,420
You know Stalin's orders.

512
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:53,710
Get lost.

513
00:55:53,991 --> 00:55:55,549
Really? What if I don't?

514
00:55:55,731 --> 00:55:57,667
Are you gonna shoot me?

515
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:03,310
I'll kill you if I have to.

516
00:56:06,951 --> 00:56:09,226
He is acting on my orders.

517
00:56:10,151 --> 00:56:11,300
Stop!

518
00:56:11,391 --> 00:56:14,110
A young soldier has stolen food.

519
00:56:15,511 --> 00:56:16,864
He is armed.

520
00:56:19,631 --> 00:56:21,064
Who is living up there?

521
00:56:24,351 --> 00:56:26,148
Who is living there?

522
00:56:30,311 --> 00:56:32,222
Anybody living there?

523
00:56:33,711 --> 00:56:34,860
No.

524
00:56:35,951 --> 00:56:37,304
She's lying.

525
00:56:37,671 --> 00:56:39,229
Lying bitch.

526
00:56:39,751 --> 00:56:41,503
I spit on Germany.

527
00:56:42,111 --> 00:56:44,227
And on Berlin.

528
00:56:44,551 --> 00:56:47,623
We conquered it,
and I spit on it!

529
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,022
Get out of my way.

530
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:16,150
Don't move.

531
00:57:26,031 --> 00:57:29,103
I'll kill you, punk!

532
00:57:40,671 --> 00:57:47,065
Everyone in possession of fire
arms or hiding someone with guns

533
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:51,306
will be executed immediately,
their houses destroyed.

534
00:58:10,831 --> 00:58:13,789
They will not forget this.

535
00:58:26,951 --> 00:58:29,909
Can I have something to drink?

536
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:30,940
You need to get away from here.

537
00:59:46,311 --> 00:59:51,385
- What are you doing here?
- I won't go to Siberia.

538
01:01:25,711 --> 01:01:29,070
During the next few days,
the Major was here often.

539
01:01:29,071 --> 01:01:30,944
Great protection for everyone.

540
01:01:34,751 --> 01:01:39,381
In his coat he had tucked away candles
and cigars and plenty of gifts

541
01:01:39,511 --> 01:01:43,823
that the widow stashed away in her
kitchen cupboard as quickly as possible.

542
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:46,909
On the whole,
the times were changing.

543
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:59,260
Russians love to play Santa Claus.
We don't want to spoil it for them, do we?

544
01:01:59,751 --> 01:02:02,663
That is way too much.

545
01:02:06,511 --> 01:02:11,107
The major speaks sophisticated Russian
and told me more than I wanted to know.

546
01:02:11,631 --> 01:02:13,558
Now I know about his bank account,

547
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:16,386
his parents and the
names of his brothers.

548
01:02:16,511 --> 01:02:21,266
Today you are our guest.
Please, take a seat.

549
01:02:22,431 --> 01:02:26,902
Such an old school cavalier.
I really like to touch him.

550
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:35,024
The war continued.

551
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:38,530
While our men and husbands
were sent to Siberia,

552
01:02:38,751 --> 01:02:41,285
many of the women found protectors

553
01:02:41,386 --> 01:02:43,383
which made them a taboo
for the rest of the pack.

554
01:02:44,191 --> 01:02:47,421
Please hold it up.
That's a Singer.

555
01:02:47,422 --> 01:02:49,823
Almost there.
Hold it up. Up.

556
01:02:54,551 --> 01:02:55,996
In and out, in and out.

557
01:02:55,997 --> 01:02:58,510
It's like Grand Central Station in here.

558
01:03:00,791 --> 01:03:03,021
Mussolini is dead. Hanged.

559
01:03:03,111 --> 01:03:05,545
He deserved it.
One asshole less.

560
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:08,304
Cheers!

561
01:03:22,191 --> 01:03:27,140
As soon as Andrej had left the house,
Anatol claimed his visiting rights.

562
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:33,107
I was afraid that the two top dogs
would meet and kill me one day.

563
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:43,665
It's not that I could claim
that this Major is raping me.

564
01:03:43,791 --> 01:03:46,624
I am at his service.

565
01:03:46,871 --> 01:03:49,510
A whore? Maybe.

566
01:03:51,631 --> 01:03:55,340
I have met that kind of
woman only once in my life.

567
01:03:55,471 --> 01:03:59,350
People told me not to talk to
her because she was unsound.

568
01:03:59,471 --> 01:04:02,508
Whatever that means: unsound.

569
01:04:04,031 --> 01:04:05,987
Young woman!

570
01:04:13,191 --> 01:04:15,182
No way.

571
01:04:17,231 --> 01:04:19,187
Incredible.

572
01:04:19,951 --> 01:04:23,500
There she comes prancing
along as if nothing happened.

573
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:31,543
- How often?
- Four times. You?

574
01:04:35,351 --> 01:04:37,307
Come on.

575
01:04:39,271 --> 01:04:42,401
I can't believe I see you again.
You look well.

576
01:04:42,502 --> 01:04:43,444
So do you.

577
01:04:43,631 --> 01:04:46,240
Here. Quince jelly.
Real Bordeaux. Take it.

578
01:04:46,241 --> 01:04:47,544
You take that with you.

579
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:50,396
Seems you are having
a good life here.

580
01:04:50,397 --> 01:04:52,905
That's one way to put it.
Come on.

581
01:04:54,111 --> 01:04:56,989
- I'm glad you're here.
- Me too.

582
01:04:57,111 --> 01:04:59,600
Elke's visit had cheered us all up.

583
01:04:59,601 --> 01:05:01,662
The Major is guarding us well

584
01:05:01,791 --> 01:05:04,081
so that we can drink his tea
without any disturbances.

585
01:05:04,182 --> 01:05:05,281
That feels so good.

586
01:05:05,351 --> 01:05:06,864
Where to?

587
01:05:07,631 --> 01:05:09,030
What do you care?

588
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:10,465
You can't go in there.

589
01:05:10,711 --> 01:05:12,269
Who's in there?

590
01:05:17,151 --> 01:05:19,629
What a nice and yummy bloke that was.

591
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:21,303
So I tell him:"Young man,

592
01:05:21,431 --> 01:05:25,902
"that gun there over your shoulder,
that might go off."

593
01:05:26,951 --> 01:05:29,784
And when I go up the stairs,

594
01:05:29,991 --> 01:05:33,700
on the second floor someone
rushes out of the apartment,

595
01:05:33,831 --> 01:05:36,623
grabs my hair and asks:
"You syphilis?"

596
01:05:36,624 --> 01:05:38,507
And I am in shock and I say:

597
01:05:38,631 --> 01:05:42,089
- "No, surely not."
- How dumb of you.

598
01:05:47,491 --> 01:05:48,797
How's your husband?

599
01:05:48,898 --> 01:05:50,479
He was there when it
happened the first time.

600
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,750
He's been a bit confused ever since.

601
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:55,705
- What do you say about our cavaliers?
- Pitiful.

602
01:05:56,031 --> 01:05:58,111
They are pretty unimaginative.

603
01:05:58,112 --> 01:05:59,706
It may be that at home,

604
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:03,619
they have the latest and greatest
socialist planned economy,

605
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:06,750
...but their sex life
is that of Adam and Eve.

606
01:06:06,751 --> 01:06:08,984
That's what I told my husband, too.

607
01:06:09,831 --> 01:06:14,985
With all the food shortage,
a good husband isn't worth that much.

608
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:19,987
I guess a satisfactory sex
life depends on regular meals.

609
01:06:20,511 --> 01:06:23,458
For me, it's all
about a full stomach.

610
01:06:23,459 --> 01:06:24,970
No gifts, no sex!

611
01:06:29,191 --> 01:06:31,515
Heart, Pain, Love,
Sex Drive. To us!

612
01:06:31,516 --> 01:06:33,901
Who knows when we'll be
together again.

613
01:06:34,711 --> 01:06:37,544
All right, careful.
Hot, hot!

614
01:06:38,511 --> 01:06:40,491
That is apple streusel cake.

615
01:06:40,492 --> 01:06:43,460
Yeah, with crumbles,
and it's still steaming hot.

616
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:48,703
# You, you are in my heart. #

617
01:06:48,951 --> 01:06:52,227
# You, you are on my mind. #

618
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:55,732
# You, you cause me great pains, #

619
01:06:55,733 --> 01:06:59,105
# you don't know how much I love you. #

620
01:06:59,351 --> 01:07:00,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

621
01:07:00,881 --> 01:07:05,745
# don't know how much I love you. #

622
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:13,545
Not too much going on with our
Russian men right now, am I right?

623
01:07:13,671 --> 01:07:18,699
- They are so puny and powerless.
- The weak sex.

624
01:07:20,431 --> 01:07:23,389
Have you heard anything from Gerd?

625
01:07:24,671 --> 01:07:27,620
I've got a question concerning Syphilis.

626
01:07:27,621 --> 01:07:28,505
Oh my God.

627
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:31,815
How do you know you've got it?

628
01:07:31,816 --> 01:07:34,426
Itching and burning.

629
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:38,385
- And enlarged lymph nodes.
- But that comes later.

630
01:07:39,831 --> 01:07:42,664
I've read it in a lexicon.

631
01:07:49,871 --> 01:07:51,941
A lexicon...

632
01:07:54,431 --> 01:07:55,231
Here.

633
01:07:55,431 --> 01:07:57,267
An American gave that to me.

634
01:07:59,471 --> 01:08:01,109
Chew it.

635
01:08:03,351 --> 01:08:05,023
Good, isn't it?

636
01:08:06,351 --> 01:08:08,228
Americans...

637
01:08:10,271 --> 01:08:12,944
They all look like film stars.

638
01:08:23,711 --> 01:08:26,145
I'm leaving.

639
01:08:27,391 --> 01:08:28,710
And tell her...

640
01:08:29,751 --> 01:08:31,662
that I'll be back.

641
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:35,462
You got that?

642
01:08:43,791 --> 01:08:45,224
What's that?

643
01:08:59,911 --> 01:09:02,744
Can you protect us?

644
01:09:05,911 --> 01:09:08,471
Just this one day?

645
01:09:10,111 --> 01:09:12,147
I'll be here.

646
01:09:27,471 --> 01:09:30,622
Where will you go...
later?

647
01:09:32,351 --> 01:09:34,785
To where I am needed.

648
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:40,509
A special evening with the Major.

649
01:09:40,631 --> 01:09:42,906
Good conversation.

650
01:09:43,031 --> 01:09:44,833
He told me that he adores me.

651
01:09:44,834 --> 01:09:47,070
And that he doesn't care
about anything else.

652
01:09:48,631 --> 01:09:52,829
Other than the Germans, the Russian
men really appreciate educated women.

653
01:09:55,831 --> 01:09:59,062
But the war hasn't ended yet.

654
01:09:59,431 --> 01:10:00,455
Excuse me.

655
01:10:00,456 --> 01:10:05,984
Have you got a minute to spare?
We could use your help.

656
01:10:11,351 --> 01:10:13,391
Come on, kiddos,
let's get out of here.

657
01:10:13,392 --> 01:10:15,583
We will finish building
this tower of yours.

658
01:10:21,271 --> 01:10:23,307
That's him.

659
01:10:30,431 --> 01:10:31,466
Good day.

660
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:35,907
You Russian?

661
01:10:37,911 --> 01:10:39,060
Translate.

662
01:10:56,271 --> 01:10:59,741
The German army came to my village

663
01:11:10,671 --> 01:11:12,980
and killed all the children.

664
01:11:17,511 --> 01:11:20,071
They have...

665
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:24,539
...stabbed them to death,

666
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:35,544
took their bodies at the ankles...

667
01:11:42,471 --> 01:11:43,540
Continue!

668
01:11:44,631 --> 01:11:46,542
...and smashed their skulls...

669
01:12:01,031 --> 01:12:03,829
...on the walls...

670
01:12:11,831 --> 01:12:13,230
...of the houses.

671
01:12:21,831 --> 01:12:23,867
Have you heard that?

672
01:12:24,031 --> 01:12:25,350
Or did you see it with your own eyes?

673
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,942
I saw it.

674
01:12:41,951 --> 01:12:44,021
Hey! Why so fast?

675
01:12:44,111 --> 01:12:46,909
Have you forgotten your panties?

676
01:13:03,631 --> 01:13:08,546
You speak Russian,
so tell him he needs to stop that.

677
01:13:10,431 --> 01:13:13,264
You speak Russian, right?

678
01:13:22,871 --> 01:13:27,069
Move it, you slut!
Go.

679
01:14:04,631 --> 01:14:07,191
Where are you going?

680
01:14:08,751 --> 01:14:11,584
I've been waiting for you.

681
01:14:15,111 --> 01:14:18,069
What's wrong with you?

682
01:14:18,631 --> 01:14:21,099
Comrade Major!

683
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:32,589
The old Germany is coming to an end.

684
01:14:39,711 --> 01:14:41,906
Stay away from him!

685
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,869
He is coming to me,

686
01:14:44,151 --> 01:14:45,789
not the other way round.

687
01:14:46,751 --> 01:14:48,423
Go away.

688
01:14:48,671 --> 01:14:50,627
Why?

689
01:14:54,231 --> 01:14:57,029
You Germans have hanged his wife.

690
01:15:18,351 --> 01:15:25,348
Attention! On April 30th,
1945, the Fuhrer committed suicide.

691
01:15:26,911 --> 01:15:32,144
He deserted all of us who have
pledged allegiance to him.

692
01:15:33,711 --> 01:15:37,260
Following the orders of the Fuhrer,
you still believe it's your duty

693
01:15:37,831 --> 01:15:41,904
to defend Berlin although
the supply of heavy armory,

694
01:15:42,591 --> 01:15:47,585
ammunition and your position make
this fight utterly pointless.

695
01:15:48,791 --> 01:15:50,907
With every hour you continue to fight,

696
01:15:51,031 --> 01:15:56,185
you prolong the horrible suffering
of the civil population of Berlin...

697
01:15:56,391 --> 01:15:57,908
and our wounded soldiers.

698
01:15:57,909 --> 01:16:01,306
From now on, everybody who
dies in the battle for Berlin

699
01:16:02,271 --> 01:16:05,104
will have sacrificed
their lives in vain.

700
01:16:05,871 --> 01:16:10,706
In accordance with the leaders
of the Soviet army I prompt you

701
01:16:11,631 --> 01:16:14,782
to cease all fighting immediately.

702
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:23,622
Breitling, Artillery General and
commanding officer of the Berlin defense.

703
01:16:34,871 --> 01:16:39,342
Fellow soldiers and officers
of the 8th guard army.

704
01:16:40,311 --> 01:16:42,029
This morning,

705
01:16:42,151 --> 01:16:43,948
the Berlin garrison...

706
01:16:43,991 --> 01:16:46,505
...has capitulated.

707
01:16:47,631 --> 01:16:49,189
Berlin...

708
01:16:51,031 --> 01:16:53,261
is defeated.

709
01:16:55,151 --> 01:16:56,709
I've told you we would make it!

710
01:18:27,871 --> 01:18:30,829
I'll join my fellow Germans.

711
01:18:32,351 --> 01:18:34,307
Go to Siberia?

712
01:18:37,711 --> 01:18:39,667
What about us?

713
01:18:54,631 --> 01:18:58,340
Talk to me, Friedrich, please!

714
01:18:59,391 --> 01:19:01,951
Talk to me.

715
01:19:04,271 --> 01:19:07,104
I've been waiting for you.

716
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:10,784
I have prayed and hoped,

717
01:19:12,871 --> 01:19:16,102
prayed and hoped.

718
01:19:17,391 --> 01:19:19,951
No I want you to fulfill

719
01:19:20,471 --> 01:19:25,306
some of those hopes for me.

720
01:20:01,191 --> 01:20:06,219
Hurray, comrades!
To our victory!

721
01:20:06,511 --> 01:20:09,344
Berlin is defeated!

722
01:20:09,551 --> 01:20:12,588
To our home country!

723
01:20:16,671 --> 01:20:18,980
Long live the Red Army!

724
01:20:19,551 --> 01:20:23,942
Long live Stalin!

725
01:20:50,271 --> 01:20:53,229
Hold on, wait a second.

726
01:20:56,991 --> 01:20:59,949
What have we here?
Two halibuts.

727
01:21:02,471 --> 01:21:07,625
- That's incredible.
- Hitler, Goebbels, kaput.

728
01:21:10,871 --> 01:21:12,827
That's great!
Let's drink.

729
01:22:09,511 --> 01:22:11,866
Capitulation.

730
01:22:11,991 --> 01:22:14,824
The time has come.

731
01:22:15,031 --> 01:22:17,864
The war is over.

732
01:22:18,031 --> 01:22:22,007
Us women have been looking
forward to this day so much.

733
01:22:22,008 --> 01:22:22,149
So how does it feel?

734
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:25,229
Bitter, bitter defeat.

735
01:22:27,871 --> 01:22:32,422
More and more people report
gruesome things.

736
01:22:32,951 --> 01:22:37,502
I sense an alien, hard-to-grasp
something in the air,

737
01:22:39,271 --> 01:22:42,104
mean and threatening.

738
01:22:44,991 --> 01:22:48,188
I don't want to think
about that right now.

739
01:22:53,951 --> 01:22:55,907
It's over.

740
01:22:56,151 --> 01:22:57,869
I don't know...

741
01:22:58,591 --> 01:23:02,027
I'm afraid misfortune has still
some tricks up its sleeves.

742
01:23:16,511 --> 01:23:18,263
Do you hear that?

743
01:23:18,591 --> 01:23:21,549
They drink and smoke like men.

744
01:23:25,311 --> 01:23:28,860
There are 1 million women
in the Russian army.

745
01:23:30,471 --> 01:23:34,430
They come from everywhere.
We don't have uniforms for them.

746
01:23:35,231 --> 01:23:39,543
Boots are too big.
Shirts and jackets, a disaster.

747
01:23:41,111 --> 01:23:45,070
Once a woman came to me,
Ljuba was her name I think.

748
01:23:45,191 --> 01:23:49,821
She says: "Comrade Major,
I believe I will fall today.

749
01:23:50,311 --> 01:23:55,146
"I want new clothes." I say:
"No, you are with us a long time.

750
01:23:55,271 --> 01:23:59,662
"Bullets just avoid you."
Two hours later, she comes again.

751
01:23:59,791 --> 01:24:02,624
And again. Then I tell her:

752
01:24:03,631 --> 01:24:09,263
"Then the new shirt,
with ties white as snow,

753
01:24:10,511 --> 01:24:13,071
it would be spoiled by the blood."

754
01:24:14,751 --> 01:24:19,310
All female soldiers fear that when
they die, they don't look pretty.

755
01:24:23,777 --> 01:24:26,337
Are you a fascist?

756
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:38,246
What are you looking for?

757
01:24:38,377 --> 01:24:40,129
All occupied.

758
01:24:47,177 --> 01:24:49,930
And the battalion commander?

759
01:24:56,137 --> 01:24:58,605
That's what I like
about you Mongols.

760
01:25:00,257 --> 01:25:03,647
Not a single unnecessary word.

761
01:25:10,497 --> 01:25:12,533
1678 days...

762
01:25:12,617 --> 01:25:15,336
since I've been in this war.

763
01:25:21,097 --> 01:25:23,213
And now...

764
01:25:29,977 --> 01:25:31,888
And she...

765
01:25:32,937 --> 01:25:34,928
she's a whore.

766
01:25:35,097 --> 01:25:36,894
Am I right?

767
01:25:39,057 --> 01:25:40,615
This whole place...

768
01:25:40,697 --> 01:25:43,291
is a brothel!

769
01:26:32,137 --> 01:26:35,209
You come with me.
Move it, you pig.

770
01:26:38,097 --> 01:26:40,744
A pistol, huh? Bastard!

771
01:26:40,745 --> 01:26:42,010
Peace, huh?

772
01:26:42,257 --> 01:26:43,326
Don't!

773
01:26:46,457 --> 01:26:48,413
War kaput!

774
01:26:52,817 --> 01:26:54,170
I said, move it!

775
01:26:54,857 --> 01:26:55,846
Everybody downstairs.

776
01:26:57,457 --> 01:26:58,412
Hurry!

777
01:27:04,977 --> 01:27:06,296
All of you, downstairs.

778
01:27:06,897 --> 01:27:08,091
Hurry!

779
01:27:08,297 --> 01:27:09,810
Faster.

780
01:27:11,377 --> 01:27:12,366
Quick!

781
01:27:15,497 --> 01:27:17,408
Don't move.

782
01:27:19,737 --> 01:27:21,693
Where you get weapons?

783
01:27:27,257 --> 01:27:30,090
Whose apartment is that?

784
01:27:34,217 --> 01:27:35,172
Who?

785
01:27:36,617 --> 01:27:37,572
It's mine.

786
01:27:46,817 --> 01:27:48,091
Is that hers?

787
01:27:48,817 --> 01:27:50,136
It's hers.

788
01:27:50,977 --> 01:27:54,686
That is crime against
decree of Red Army.

789
01:27:55,617 --> 01:27:57,653
Long live the Fuhrer.

790
01:27:58,537 --> 01:28:00,129
Eliminate her.

791
01:28:01,017 --> 01:28:03,577
You can all go to hell.

792
01:28:06,817 --> 01:28:09,650
Did you know about weapons?

793
01:28:12,697 --> 01:28:15,973
- No.
- Go back to apartment.

794
01:28:16,537 --> 01:28:17,597
Shoot them all!

795
01:28:17,937 --> 01:28:18,993
Go now.

796
01:28:19,137 --> 01:28:20,057
Stop.

797
01:28:20,157 --> 01:28:21,775
They're liars, all of them!

798
01:28:21,976 --> 01:28:22,946
Shoot them.

799
01:28:26,337 --> 01:28:27,517
Leave this woman.

800
01:28:27,817 --> 01:28:28,897
She is a Hitler broad.

801
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:30,865
Do you understand?

802
01:28:30,966 --> 01:28:31,170
No.

803
01:28:32,177 --> 01:28:34,566
First she will be interrogated.

804
01:28:35,417 --> 01:28:37,350
Do you understand?

805
01:28:37,577 --> 01:28:38,817
What are you doing, brother?

806
01:28:39,817 --> 01:28:42,570
This woman has sheltered
an armed soldier.

807
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:44,057
The punishment for that is death.

808
01:28:44,197 --> 01:28:45,388
Go, now!

809
01:28:52,177 --> 01:28:54,930
I'll have to report this.

810
01:28:55,617 --> 01:28:58,529
Burn them alive!

811
01:29:05,897 --> 01:29:10,766
How could you risk our lives like that?
Now we are sold down the river.

812
01:29:38,057 --> 01:29:39,729
Traitor!

813
01:29:53,657 --> 01:29:58,936
I own whole Berlin! Hotel Adlon,
Wedding, Kaiserdamm!

814
01:29:59,417 --> 01:30:02,136
Red flags everywhere.

815
01:30:02,337 --> 01:30:05,613
Red flags.
Pretty flags, good quality.

816
01:30:08,177 --> 01:30:10,213
What is it?

817
01:30:13,937 --> 01:30:15,052
Quarrel?

818
01:30:26,537 --> 01:30:27,686
What are you looking at?

819
01:30:28,137 --> 01:30:29,968
Get out of my sight.

820
01:30:34,297 --> 01:30:35,332
Hey, what's up?

821
01:30:36,297 --> 01:30:37,366
To victory, Commander.

822
01:30:38,057 --> 01:30:39,729
To Stalin and our victory.

823
01:30:40,297 --> 01:30:41,616
Wait.
You should stay with your people.

824
01:30:41,897 --> 01:30:43,808
The war is over.

825
01:30:45,617 --> 01:30:47,812
Here! I get it.

826
01:30:48,577 --> 01:30:49,977
Look...

827
01:30:50,177 --> 01:30:52,047
Lyoba, Marina, Olga.

828
01:30:54,577 --> 01:30:55,726
They love me,

829
01:30:56,577 --> 01:30:57,976
all of them.

830
01:30:59,257 --> 01:31:01,213
Everything all right?

831
01:31:03,657 --> 01:31:05,613
Do you want something to eat?

832
01:31:17,377 --> 01:31:23,532
Here. What's better? You tell me.
His dick or my bicycle?

833
01:31:25,617 --> 01:31:26,652
And you, get out of here...

834
01:31:26,777 --> 01:31:28,495
before I shoot your nuts off!

835
01:31:30,537 --> 01:31:31,577
You, listen!

836
01:31:32,017 --> 01:31:33,198
We celebrate.

837
01:31:33,399 --> 01:31:35,541
Everybody come, whole house.

838
01:31:35,542 --> 01:31:36,286
Order!

839
01:31:38,377 --> 01:31:42,575
Your Hitler is not human.
He is a stinking pile of turd.

840
01:31:44,737 --> 01:31:45,806
Not human.

841
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:47,611
Turd!

842
01:31:49,017 --> 01:31:51,424
Lenchen, Lenchen!
Trouble upstairs!

843
01:31:51,425 --> 01:31:53,488
Everyone, come now.

844
01:31:54,577 --> 01:31:55,566
Order!

845
01:31:57,537 --> 01:31:58,765
Fill the glasses.

846
01:31:59,337 --> 01:32:00,565
What are you standing there?

847
01:32:00,657 --> 01:32:02,249
We've got guests.

848
01:32:13,097 --> 01:32:15,053
Why fear?

849
01:32:26,337 --> 01:32:29,488
Look down there.
What do you see?

850
01:32:31,897 --> 01:32:33,250
Soldiers.

851
01:32:34,817 --> 01:32:38,366
Russians! Beasts.
Or animals, like you call us.

852
01:32:39,497 --> 01:32:41,453
And you're right.

853
01:32:41,577 --> 01:32:47,652
None of us is hesitating a single
second if we can shoot a German.

854
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:52,008
Your blood is on our uniforms.

855
01:32:52,377 --> 01:32:55,449
Is good as it is.
None of them wanted war!

856
01:32:56,777 --> 01:33:00,565
Most of them didn't even
know what that is, Germany.

857
01:33:04,137 --> 01:33:07,049
Now come with me.

858
01:33:11,417 --> 01:33:13,407
What is happening here?

859
01:33:13,408 --> 01:33:15,569
Careful, that's mahogany.

860
01:33:16,417 --> 01:33:18,851
Let me go!

861
01:33:23,057 --> 01:33:26,493
- You dance. Dance!
- How dare you?

862
01:33:26,617 --> 01:33:29,880
This is my living room
and not a dance hall.

863
01:33:29,881 --> 01:33:30,895
You understand?

864
01:33:31,057 --> 01:33:34,015
- That is fantastic.
- No dance hall!

865
01:33:34,297 --> 01:33:37,846
Drink Schnapps, Vodka.
Schnapps good.

866
01:33:41,217 --> 01:33:42,286
You.

867
01:33:50,097 --> 01:33:53,931
Sing? Now he wants me to sing.
I won't sing now.

868
01:33:55,617 --> 01:33:58,575
- What does he want?
- Well, have a guess.

869
01:33:59,137 --> 01:34:00,092
No.

870
01:34:00,297 --> 01:34:01,730
What does that mean, "no"?

871
01:34:04,057 --> 01:34:06,969
That is Europe!
That is Europe!

872
01:34:07,617 --> 01:34:08,970
Drink, drink.

873
01:34:10,897 --> 01:34:11,937
Why not?

874
01:34:12,137 --> 01:34:14,007
I'm looking at you.

875
01:34:14,057 --> 01:34:16,127
And you?
Nothing.

876
01:34:22,297 --> 01:34:23,810
Well, maybe next time.

877
01:34:24,737 --> 01:34:25,886
To you.

878
01:34:40,937 --> 01:34:42,928
I Anatol.

879
01:34:44,617 --> 01:34:47,450
- I know.
- Brbel.

880
01:34:48,377 --> 01:34:53,053
My heart calls Brbel.

881
01:34:54,337 --> 01:34:57,374
Brbel, Brbel, Brbel.

882
01:35:09,257 --> 01:35:11,373
I play the fiddle.

883
01:35:11,497 --> 01:35:13,533
Violin. Violin?

884
01:35:14,177 --> 01:35:15,769
You play the piano?

885
01:35:15,857 --> 01:35:18,083
In an orchestra,
but not any more.

886
01:35:18,084 --> 01:35:19,327
The violin is lost.

887
01:35:19,897 --> 01:35:22,730
That's good.
I'd like to play the piano, too.

888
01:35:28,897 --> 01:35:31,730
Why don't you go upstairs?

889
01:35:32,417 --> 01:35:36,888
- Should I?
- Yes, have some fun.

890
01:35:39,897 --> 01:35:42,730
We all need that.

891
01:35:43,377 --> 01:35:45,937
Do you come with me?

892
01:35:46,097 --> 01:35:47,325
Later.

893
01:35:48,817 --> 01:35:50,808
- Sure?
- Yes.

894
01:35:56,977 --> 01:35:59,810
It's good that you are here.

895
01:36:18,417 --> 01:36:20,885
I want to embrace you

896
01:36:21,017 --> 01:36:23,577
my whole life.

897
01:36:26,297 --> 01:36:29,130
I am here, you're in Moscow.

898
01:36:31,217 --> 01:36:34,050
Nobody has arms that long.

899
01:36:34,737 --> 01:36:36,693
Try it.

900
01:36:43,457 --> 01:36:48,485
The Major asked me to call him Andrej.
"Why not?", I said.

901
01:36:48,617 --> 01:36:52,576
"The war is over."
He looked at me for a long while.

902
01:36:53,817 --> 01:36:57,776
"Every newborn child
cries for war," he said.

903
01:36:58,457 --> 01:37:03,008
Nothing and nobody, no man,
no nation, will stop this vicious circle.

904
01:37:03,977 --> 01:37:05,933
Only death.

905
01:37:13,857 --> 01:37:16,815
Not so fast,
I am getting sick.

906
01:37:22,577 --> 01:37:24,295
Gee.

907
01:37:27,137 --> 01:37:28,570
Attention.

908
01:37:30,777 --> 01:37:32,972
And now for everybody...

909
01:37:33,337 --> 01:37:36,568
"I in love with you."

910
01:37:38,777 --> 01:37:40,005
Brbel.

911
01:38:10,057 --> 01:38:11,570
Dance.

912
01:38:16,737 --> 01:38:18,967
Come on, let's go.

913
01:38:26,257 --> 01:38:30,136
We are not a people any more,
we're only "the population".

914
01:38:30,257 --> 01:38:34,011
I am talking about individuals
that form within a democracy.

915
01:38:34,137 --> 01:38:38,096
The ones who get the economy going.
Economic upswing.

916
01:39:03,897 --> 01:39:06,730
Dance, dance, you come.

917
01:39:11,257 --> 01:39:14,071
I think we should look at
the greater picture here.

918
01:39:14,072 --> 01:39:16,615
The countries of Europe
will burst their borders.

919
01:39:16,737 --> 01:39:20,650
They will grow into larger areas.
The victorious super powers will,

920
01:39:20,777 --> 01:39:23,735
just like Napoleon did,
re-order the political world map.

921
01:39:24,097 --> 01:39:28,329
So we will become a Soviet republic
with planned economy, huh?

922
01:39:40,777 --> 01:39:41,812
Thanks.

923
01:39:44,377 --> 01:39:48,256
Well, Mr. Hoch, everything all right?
We need to think practical now.

924
01:39:48,377 --> 01:39:52,211
Let's start the every day life again,
and we will soon get into the groove.

925
01:39:55,737 --> 01:39:56,692
Slow down.

926
01:40:18,857 --> 01:40:20,006
Drink.

927
01:40:31,617 --> 01:40:34,051
The Soviet Union is just at
the beginning of its evolution.

928
01:40:35,257 --> 01:40:37,817
The future will prove that.

929
01:40:40,737 --> 01:40:43,126
You love your country.

930
01:40:43,897 --> 01:40:46,172
Just as I love mine.

931
01:40:54,417 --> 01:40:57,250
My mother once said that one day,

932
01:40:57,737 --> 01:41:01,571
I would marry a man
who played the piano.

933
01:41:09,857 --> 01:41:13,247
Everybody has been wondering
what this day would be like.

934
01:41:15,377 --> 01:41:17,572
I haven't.

935
01:41:18,577 --> 01:41:20,932
Never.

936
01:41:28,817 --> 01:41:32,207
I didn't want to experience it.

937
01:41:37,737 --> 01:41:40,774
Why not?

938
01:41:55,417 --> 01:41:59,933
If you don't do it, Andrej,
I will tell you something.

939
01:42:05,417 --> 01:42:09,535
War is changing the words.

940
01:42:13,977 --> 01:42:19,097
"Love" is not what it used to be.

941
01:42:25,577 --> 01:42:27,533
And yet,

942
01:42:31,097 --> 01:42:33,657
in spite of that,

943
01:42:34,817 --> 01:42:39,175
I want that my husband finds the
same wife that he left behind

944
01:42:39,217 --> 01:42:41,650
when he returns.

945
01:42:46,937 --> 01:42:48,893
Please stay.

946
01:43:09,657 --> 01:43:13,616
Us women,
we are branded for life.

947
01:43:15,017 --> 01:43:19,249
But for here and now,
right in this moment,

948
01:43:20,617 --> 01:43:23,575
I feel fantastic.

949
01:43:32,377 --> 01:43:35,335
I'll go and get us some tea.
Ilse still has some left.

950
01:44:10,817 --> 01:44:14,412
Morning, Lenchen!
Anybody up?

951
01:44:20,537 --> 01:44:23,495
- Where is your Wanja?
- Working.

952
01:44:24,697 --> 01:44:26,653
And mummy?

953
01:44:31,937 --> 01:44:32,972
Ilse?

954
01:44:34,857 --> 01:44:35,812
Ilse?

955
01:44:39,017 --> 01:44:40,575
Ilse?

956
01:44:57,257 --> 01:44:58,656
Ilse.

957
01:44:59,977 --> 01:45:02,537
Ilse, get away from him.

958
01:45:17,417 --> 01:45:20,295
Gerd, do you remember?
It was on a Tuesday.

959
01:45:20,417 --> 01:45:22,851
We went to see Felix.

960
01:45:22,977 --> 01:45:25,935
You could smell the tree resin.

961
01:45:26,537 --> 01:45:30,496
We came across a cloud of butterflies.

962
01:45:32,537 --> 01:45:35,495
And you knew all their names.

963
01:45:35,937 --> 01:45:42,206
Pea blues, Brimstones, Fire birds,
Swallowtails and many more.

964
01:45:46,977 --> 01:45:49,663
One was taking a sunbath
right there on the path,

965
01:45:49,664 --> 01:45:51,812
it was velvety brown and
yellow with a blue hem.

966
01:45:52,417 --> 01:45:55,375
You called it a Mourning Cloak.

967
01:46:22,977 --> 01:46:26,535
So many things I've
been given in my life.

968
01:46:26,536 --> 01:46:27,528
In abundance.

969
01:46:27,657 --> 01:46:30,615
The Major had lost everything.

970
01:46:30,897 --> 01:46:33,775
Damn Russian idealist.

971
01:46:33,897 --> 01:46:37,776
He takes it all like he
wants the world to be.

972
01:46:37,897 --> 01:46:40,730
Soviet apostle.

973
01:46:43,337 --> 01:46:44,831
I like him though.

974
01:46:44,932 --> 01:46:48,650
The less he wants from me,
the more I like him.

975
01:46:50,257 --> 01:46:51,326
Very much.

976
01:46:59,497 --> 01:47:00,566
Andrej.

977
01:47:02,977 --> 01:47:03,966
Andrej.

978
01:47:33,817 --> 01:47:36,650
Andrej isn't here any more.

979
01:47:38,377 --> 01:47:39,890
Relocated.

980
01:47:46,417 --> 01:47:47,486
To where?

981
01:47:52,297 --> 01:47:53,696
Unknown.

982
01:47:56,057 --> 01:47:57,331
Good-bye.

983
01:48:57,937 --> 01:49:00,895
"The birds so quiet,
the bells are silent."

984
01:49:01,250 --> 01:49:04,250
(from "18 Little Songs of the
Bitter Homeland" by Yiannis Ritsos)

985
01:49:04,697 --> 01:49:07,257
Isn't that how it goes?

986
01:49:24,457 --> 01:49:25,731
Please, sit down.

987
01:49:51,177 --> 01:49:53,213
The studio,

988
01:49:55,057 --> 01:49:57,013
is that gone?

989
01:50:09,817 --> 01:50:12,775
- I don't live here alone.
- I know.

990
01:50:16,617 --> 01:50:19,085
Ukrainians like that.

991
01:51:10,057 --> 01:51:12,890
Here, that's for you.

992
01:52:17,137 --> 01:52:19,697
You are shameless.

993
01:52:20,017 --> 01:52:22,577
Don't you see that?

994
01:52:26,017 --> 01:52:29,566
It is disgusting
just to look at you.

995
01:53:27,817 --> 01:53:29,045
Atten-shun!

996
01:54:02,337 --> 01:54:05,374
- I'd like to thank you.
- For what?

997
01:54:08,697 --> 01:54:11,655
That I had the chance
to get to know you.

998
01:54:20,777 --> 01:54:23,610
Take care of yourself.

999
01:54:39,337 --> 01:54:42,215
How are we supposed to live?

1000
01:55:15,657 --> 01:55:17,648
Eyes front!


1001
01:55:31,457 --> 01:55:34,494
"Relocation," that's what they call it.

1002
01:55:36,257 --> 01:55:39,090
With full honors and merits.

1003
01:55:39,217 --> 01:55:42,687
To Siberia, who knows?

1004
01:56:03,977 --> 01:56:05,330
Gerd.

1005
01:56:06,377 --> 01:56:09,210
My beloved Gerd.

1006
01:56:10,017 --> 01:56:12,815
What shall we do?

1007
01:56:12,937 --> 01:56:15,451
Turn back the wheel of time?

1008
01:56:15,577 --> 01:56:18,535
Back to your very first words?

1009
01:56:19,857 --> 01:56:22,690
"30 minutes", you said.

1010
01:56:26,697 --> 01:56:32,329
"Give me 30 minutes, and you will
never want to leave me again."

1011
01:59:03,857 --> 01:59:04,812
What?

1012
01:59:18,977 --> 01:59:20,046
What?

1013
01:59:26,777 --> 01:59:29,337
No answer.

1014
01:59:30,057 --> 01:59:33,015
Two days later he was gone.

1015
01:59:33,457 --> 01:59:36,335
I don't know if he will come back.

1016
01:59:36,457 --> 01:59:39,899
I am surprised that I am
not suffering more.

1017
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:40,894
Maybe I am just too busy.

1018
01:59:41,777 --> 01:59:45,326
I need to find a piece of flint stone,

1019
01:59:45,457 --> 01:59:48,443
I need to mop up the
floor of the apartment

1020
01:59:48,444 --> 01:59:51,293
and I am desperately
looking for some flowers.

1021
01:59:51,417 --> 01:59:54,250
Yesterday I found some lilac.

1022
01:59:55,457 --> 01:59:58,290
I wonder if Gerd still thinks about me.

1023
01:59:58,497 --> 02:00:00,453
Who knows?

1024
02:00:00,617 --> 02:00:02,942
Maybe our hearts have
a say in this, too,

1025
02:00:03,143 --> 02:00:06,447
and we'll see each other again,
some day.

1026
02:00:09,457 --> 02:00:13,683
When the diary "A woman in Berlin"
was first released in Germany in 1959,

1027
02:00:13,784 --> 02:00:15,257
it was a huge scandal.

1028
02:00:15,317 --> 02:00:19,487
Many people said that it was a disgrace
and an insult to the German women.

1029
02:00:19,757 --> 02:00:23,355
The author was so shocked by
the rejection and the contempt
that her book received.

1030
02:00:23,856 --> 02:00:27,356
She prohibited any further
releases for as long as she lived.

1031
02:00:27,757 --> 02:00:30,457
And even beyond her death,
here real name was never to be revealed.

1032
