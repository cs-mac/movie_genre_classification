1
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,287
Let me go! Let me go!

2
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:01,059
- What is it?
- A drowned woman.

3
00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:03,185
- A drowned woman?
- She had cramps.

4
00:04:03,403 --> 00:04:05,361
The water is still too cold.

5
00:04:16,585 --> 00:04:18,127
Let me go!

6
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:21,247
Let me go!

7
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,954
But it's Gösta!

8
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:40,039
Yes, hello.

9
00:05:40,251 --> 00:05:41,995
Really! Hello.

10
00:05:42,212 --> 00:05:44,169
I got off the boat today.

11
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:46,502
Hi!

12
00:05:51,764 --> 00:05:55,178
We sailed together.

13
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,266
- From The U.S.?
- From the East Indies.

14
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:00,428
Really?

15
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:04,311
Tea, peppers, rice,
zinc and wool from Australia.

16
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:07,900
Yes, but now, it is finished.
Eight years at sea is enough.

17
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:10,320
You can settle down here, at home.

18
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:13,486
This bed is free
and the rent is modest.

19
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:15,612
You could work at the port.

20
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,027
No, not at the port...

21
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:20,953
So you want to become director
straight away?

22
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:24,411
You could at least begin there

23
00:06:24,672 --> 00:06:27,341
while looking for something else?

24
00:06:32,345 --> 00:06:33,756
It's a good job.

25
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:37,556
Everything will be alright, you'll see.

26
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:17,925
955.

27
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:19,137
Yes.

28
00:07:19,977 --> 00:07:20,807
346.

29
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:22,217
Yes.

30
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,951
- 376.
- Yes.

31
00:07:40,163 --> 00:07:42,074
650.

32
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:44,824
Yes.

33
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:51,499
You will start at 7h30
at no. 34, the "Saga".

34
00:09:51,878 --> 00:09:53,672
You're not going out this evening?

35
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:54,996
Not, I don't think so.

36
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:57,921
Although it's a Saturday,

37
00:09:58,136 --> 00:09:59,714
I don't feel like it.

38
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,593
You're in love with someone?
or maybe you're sick?

39
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:09,137
It's been a while since that
happened to me.

40
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:12,021
Well, cheer up then.

41
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:17,320
Besides, you have money.
With money, you can get women.

42
00:10:17,572 --> 00:10:18,769
And whisky.

43
00:10:19,364 --> 00:10:20,645
I don't care about that!

44
00:10:22,452 --> 00:10:25,572
Everyone has their ups and downs.

45
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:28,202
Let's say that it's
because of spring.

46
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:44,131
What are you reading?

47
00:10:44,348 --> 00:10:46,471
- A book...
- Yes, I can see that.

48
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:48,717
But by whom?

49
00:10:48,937 --> 00:10:52,388
A sailor. He's called Martinsson.

50
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,145
And you read that?

51
00:10:59,364 --> 00:11:02,400
Don't books interest you?

52
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:04,023
Not any more.

53
00:11:05,662 --> 00:11:09,445
My father was a teacher.
He had loads of books.

54
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:14,869
At that time, we felt lonely.

55
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:18,709
We wanted to sail away,
See lots of things.

56
00:11:19,552 --> 00:11:22,173
We thought we were missing
essential things.

57
00:11:23,471 --> 00:11:24,669
Ah yes.

58
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:31,181
Then I stopped,
and I began to drink.

59
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:35,064
Books make everything worse.

60
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:37,390
Well read, then.

61
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:42,603
Goodbye!

62
00:11:43,532 --> 00:11:45,112
See you.

63
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:25,063
There's a crowd.

64
00:12:25,284 --> 00:12:27,025
Yes, really.

65
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:29,114
It's hot.

66
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:31,368
Yes.

67
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:33,707
They're not playing badly.

68
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:35,992
I've heard better.

69
00:12:36,753 --> 00:12:38,959
It's funny when they go for it.

70
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:46,631
I find that rather silly.
You need strangers for that.

71
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:48,399
There's a lot of people.

72
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:50,951
It could be worse.

73
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:54,451
It's hot with all these people.

74
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:57,492
There's only one thing left to say.

75
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:58,990
What's that?

76
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:01,128
That they play well.

77
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:02,916
Yes, indeed.

78
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:05,085
Everyone says that.

79
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,677
Really?

80
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:10,013
But they can say it
in a thousand ways.

81
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:13,094
It's boring here. Shall we go?

82
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:14,764
With pleasure.

83
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:16,258
Good. Let's get out of here.

84
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,533
Hi, Berit.

85
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:36,862
Hi.

86
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:37,829
Come here.

87
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,165
I don't want to.

88
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:41,291
Bitch.

89
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:42,963
She's pretending to be a virgin.

90
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:44,417
Shut up!

91
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:49,757
Don't pay attention to
those bastards!

92
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:53,008
But you could have said hello to me.

93
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:56,554
You shouldn't be so afraid.

94
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:59,306
Laugh in their faces
and give them back the change.

95
00:14:59,521 --> 00:15:01,765
I don't want to belong
to the group any more.

96
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,692
I won't go back any more.

97
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:05,941
You think you're escaping?

98
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:08,027
Sure, if you don't want to.

99
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:10,030
We could become just friends again.

100
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:11,784
I have to go.

101
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:16,780
I understand just
how you feel.

102
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:35,347
Is it better like that?

103
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,005
Why?

104
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,227
Why? Don't get upset.

105
00:15:42,523 --> 00:15:44,600
You think I want to?

106
00:16:45,378 --> 00:16:46,955
Say,

107
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:49,499
you live alone here?

108
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:52,879
Not, it's my parents' place.

109
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,555
Where are they?

110
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,504
Dad is at sea. He is second mate.

111
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:02,098
And mum is at an aunt's.

112
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,688
cigarette?

113
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,392
No thanks, I don't smoke.

114
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,101
Smart not to.

115
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:13,988
You're well set up here.

116
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,109
It's OK.

117
00:17:18,702 --> 00:17:21,158
If only there was
a little more freedom.

118
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:58,323
Why did you kiss me?

119
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:02,486
What a question!
Because I like you, of course.

120
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,622
Really?

121
00:18:04,832 --> 00:18:08,831
I find you beautiful
and I would like to kiss you more.

122
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,580
Yes, I see that.

123
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:13,039
You are strange.

124
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,219
Don't worry about it.

125
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,395
So, would you like some coffee?

126
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:31,147
Not, I don't want a coffee.

127
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,115
Goodbye, then.

128
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,082
Bye.

129
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,090
Are you tired?

130
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:19,922
So-so.

131
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,296
I have to go to work.

132
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,432
On Sunday?

133
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,390
Yes, I work in a team.

134
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,439
Goodbye.

135
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,310
Will we see each other again?

136
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,570
Yes, we will.

137
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,488
We are agreed.

138
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:47,662
Wednesday? 8 o'clock, without fail.
Hello.

139
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,498
Alone.

140
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:45,509
Are you there?

141
00:21:45,723 --> 00:21:47,515
That is my business, isn't it?

142
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:49,965
You don't care about coming late.

143
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,057
You, you had to go back on Monday.

144
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,930
I changed my mind.

145
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,857
So you could spy on me.

146
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,815
I was worried.

147
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,780
I have to believe that?

148
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,207
Who did you make out with, yesterday
evening?

149
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,455
I was at the cinema.

150
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,203
And afterwards?

151
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,839
Afterwards I went home.

152
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,462
Alone?

153
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,088
What do you think?

154
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:32,054
You're lying.

155
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:33,764
Ah right!

156
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,645
There was a boy.

157
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:36,851
False.

158
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,440
False?

159
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,187
It was I who smoked.

160
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:43,108
I know well that you don't smoke.

161
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,827
So?

162
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,246
What are you going to do?

163
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:05,796
You know well that I must
submit a report to Villander Assistance.

164
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,638
Go ahead. Denounce me, without shame.
Let them come and get me!

165
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,676
You come here with boys.

166
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:15,466
It was better
when you were elsewhere.

167
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:18,724
I should have known
not to trust you.

168
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,016
- What are you saying?
- Stop this theatre.

169
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:25,854
Go ahead. Hit your mother.
That's just like you.

170
00:23:26,074 --> 00:23:28,232
I was only waiting for that.

171
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,658
Berit, you don't have anything to say to me?

172
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:35,869
Leave me.

173
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,836
If you apologise, I won't say anything.

174
00:23:39,045 --> 00:23:42,377
will not ask for your pardon.
Never.

175
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:43,585
Be careful.

176
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,839
- Let me pass.
- Don't touch me.

177
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:20,387
Engineer Villander
wants to speak to you.

178
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:23,689
His sister is there.
You know, the assistant.

179
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:37,286
Villander has asked how you
were behaving.

180
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:40,580
I said well, but the assistant
wasnt too pleased.

181
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:41,989
Oh right.

182
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,872
You didn't do anything stupid ?

183
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:46,417
How would I know?

184
00:25:46,631 --> 00:25:50,545
I did all I could.
Thats worth a small reward, isnt it?

185
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,504
And you believe that?

186
00:25:52,721 --> 00:25:54,463
That could cheer you up too.

187
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,136
- I doubt it!
- Youre sure?

188
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,721
The girls say
that you are not a real guy!

189
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:15,909
- Hello.
- Hello, Miss Holm.

190
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:19,285
I don't have anything to say,
but Miss Villander does.

191
00:26:19,497 --> 00:26:20,825
I understand.

192
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:24,536
Berit understands what its about.

193
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:26,368
I will leave you.

194
00:26:26,588 --> 00:26:28,210
No, stay.

195
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,797
Im used to it.

196
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,588
Your mother called me yesterday.

197
00:26:32,802 --> 00:26:34,925
Yes, she often grasses on me.

198
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:38,430
It is a privilege
to live at your mothers.

199
00:26:38,641 --> 00:26:41,807
It is worse than being
in a reformatory.

200
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,516
You should be ashamed.
And dont interrupt me, Berit.

201
00:26:46,733 --> 00:26:49,650
If I must keep silent,
I will go back to work.

202
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:54,522
Dont take that kind of tone. You really want
to come back to the family home?

203
00:26:55,658 --> 00:26:58,659
Who worries about the
tone in which they question me?

204
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:03,282
And they will send me back home despite my protests.
They wont ask me how I feel.

205
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:10,842
You should understand your mother.
She only wants what is good for you.

206
00:27:11,258 --> 00:27:13,416
Yes, by hassling me all the time.

207
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:15,758
Berit! It is what, this language?

208
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,888
I learned it in the reformatory,

209
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:22,718
and here and everywhere else
where you have put me.

210
00:27:23,187 --> 00:27:28,345
My hope of any possible
improvement disappeared.

211
00:27:30,694 --> 00:27:32,934
You want to send me back to the family home.

212
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:37,316
I dont want to go there or here.

213
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,860
I want to be free! Free!

214
00:27:40,078 --> 00:27:44,491
People dont understand
that I want to make it by myself.

215
00:27:49,754 --> 00:27:54,048
Im not the only one who decides.
Berit, you can leave.

216
00:27:57,304 --> 00:27:58,583
Wait.

217
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:00,881
Listen to me a moment.

218
00:28:01,975 --> 00:28:04,180
You like it here?

219
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:07,894
If I can change something,
I will do it with pleasure.

220
00:28:08,107 --> 00:28:10,146
You can speak frankly.

221
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,398
I dont like to ruin my hands.

222
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:19,361
I am a milliner - it is my job.
I like to make hats.

223
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:25,196
Perhaps you would like
some cleaner work. In the checking department?

224
00:28:25,415 --> 00:28:27,325
Yes, Sir, I would.

225
00:28:28,502 --> 00:28:32,748
Agneta, give him another chance
before you submit your report.

226
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:35,539
I have not decided alone.

227
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:40,847
Go to your machine, Miss Holm.

228
00:28:47,062 --> 00:28:50,395
You were really kind
and considerate with her.

229
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:52,231
And why not?

230
00:28:52,442 --> 00:28:55,811
I do what I can,
it is not easy.

231
00:28:56,029 --> 00:28:59,314
And if you give her
a real chance?

232
00:28:59,616 --> 00:29:01,822
Its not so simple, Bengt.

233
00:29:02,036 --> 00:29:04,444
Does she really
have to live at her mothers?

234
00:29:05,205 --> 00:29:06,997
You are dealing with a bastard.

235
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:10,161
When she arrives
with all her band

236
00:29:10,377 --> 00:29:13,082
or when she is infected
or has stolen something?

237
00:29:13,297 --> 00:29:15,836
Your lack of optimism
is attractive.

238
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:17,875
What good is that?

239
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:21,260
You don't want to use a
strong hand against the rabble?

240
00:29:21,472 --> 00:29:22,847
Are you afraid of her?

241
00:29:23,057 --> 00:29:24,515
Afraid?

242
00:29:24,724 --> 00:29:26,302
One would think so.

243
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:31,106
It is very difficult to
deal with her.

244
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:34,732
Everyone says so.

245
00:29:35,694 --> 00:29:40,190
If its true, it doesnt matter,
if the experiment fails.

246
00:29:40,991 --> 00:29:44,407
No. I must speak about it
with my colleagues.

247
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,031
Of course.

248
00:29:46,246 --> 00:29:49,331
Dont be so ironic, dear Bengt.

249
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:53,078
I do not have the right
to take decisions alone.

250
00:29:53,796 --> 00:29:55,254
Who, then?

251
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:58,043
You will know.

252
00:30:14,065 --> 00:30:17,067
I have to work my supplementary hours.
Are you staying?

253
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,227
Like the little girl in the street, Ill say:
of course, of course.

254
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:22,990
OK, good.

255
00:30:23,783 --> 00:30:26,869
Didnt you have to meet that chick
at 8 oclock this evening?

256
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:30,907
Its her evening to go out.
You must look after her.

257
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:32,917
It is not so important.

258
00:30:33,128 --> 00:30:35,285
The youth of today!

259
00:30:35,505 --> 00:30:37,544
She is nothing to you, then?

260
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,037
How beautiful you have become!

261
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,742
Not me.

262
00:31:14,961 --> 00:31:18,044
I see well enough. Who are you going to see?

263
00:31:18,422 --> 00:31:22,172
Who should I see?
Im going to the cinema.

264
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:23,797
Which cinema?

265
00:31:24,262 --> 00:31:25,258
I dont know.

266
00:31:25,471 --> 00:31:27,879
Go then, so you get there on time.

267
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:30,056
Stop! Leave me in peace.

268
00:31:30,268 --> 00:31:32,224
Are you waiting for someone?

269
00:31:32,478 --> 00:31:33,474
No.

270
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,191
You look nervous.

271
00:31:40,694 --> 00:31:41,939
So?

272
00:31:42,154 --> 00:31:43,731
Hes not coming?

273
00:31:45,282 --> 00:31:46,825
Go away.

274
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:51,697
If he is a nice boy,
you could introduce him to me.

275
00:31:52,124 --> 00:31:53,831
But I dont believe it.

276
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:56,740
Believe what?

277
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,119
That hes a nice boy.

278
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:06,218
Not, there isnt anybody.

279
00:32:11,894 --> 00:32:14,810
Father has telegraphed to say that hes coming back.

280
00:32:15,645 --> 00:32:17,139
Thats good, isnt it?

281
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:18,721
Are you going to divorce?

282
00:32:18,942 --> 00:32:22,275
No, not at all.
We will start again.

283
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:23,685
Who decided that?

284
00:32:23,905 --> 00:32:25,814
It was I who decided.

285
00:32:26,032 --> 00:32:27,776
Then the hell will begin again.

286
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:30,031
What are you speaking of?

287
00:32:30,244 --> 00:32:31,952
Poor dad.

288
00:32:32,205 --> 00:32:34,577
Dad writes that he misses me.

289
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,116
He always was a little insane.

290
00:32:41,047 --> 00:32:44,462
I would like you to be happy,
you too, little Berit.

291
00:32:44,674 --> 00:32:45,670
Leave me.

292
00:32:45,884 --> 00:32:48,377
I love you very much.

293
00:32:48,722 --> 00:32:52,303
I only think of you
and worry about you.

294
00:32:52,516 --> 00:32:54,059
Thats nice.

295
00:32:54,727 --> 00:32:56,767
But leave me in peace.

296
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,641
You speak like that to your mother?

297
00:32:58,858 --> 00:33:00,230
Oh, shit!

298
00:33:14,748 --> 00:33:16,408
You are hard, Berit.

299
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:18,916
But you pay for that.

300
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:21,040
I would like to see you dead.

301
00:33:25,175 --> 00:33:27,131
I would like to be dead myself.

302
00:33:27,343 --> 00:33:30,049
Thats what one says at your age,
my daughter.

303
00:33:31,723 --> 00:33:34,296
I see you are already waiting for dad.

304
00:33:34,892 --> 00:33:37,430
I know how it will finish up
when he returns.

305
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:40,435
It will start with salt
in the gruel,

306
00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:42,856
and then all those slanging matches.

307
00:33:43,444 --> 00:33:45,021
At first the small ones,

308
00:33:45,237 --> 00:33:48,818
then whole evenings

309
00:33:49,115 --> 00:33:53,280
All that is finished, now, Berit.
We got older.

310
00:33:53,662 --> 00:33:56,946
You know that I have talked
with Pasteur Broman.

311
00:33:57,414 --> 00:33:58,695
It will be different.

312
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:01,377
For you too.

313
00:34:02,337 --> 00:34:05,836
You lie so much that you are
not the only one to believe it.

314
00:34:06,966 --> 00:34:09,503
But all others do, and dad too.

315
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:13,056
But not me.

316
00:34:14,266 --> 00:34:18,098
Because I know that you always
lie, always.

317
00:34:29,156 --> 00:34:32,524
You will regret
what you have just said.

318
00:34:56,266 --> 00:34:58,343
I ought to beat you to death.

319
00:34:58,894 --> 00:35:00,969
You do not frighten me.

320
00:35:02,147 --> 00:35:04,020
I should kill you.

321
00:35:04,273 --> 00:35:06,766
and Berit and myself.

322
00:35:12,325 --> 00:35:14,861
You are mad. You belong in the asylum.

323
00:35:15,786 --> 00:35:18,193
What are you saying? Me, insane?

324
00:35:19,915 --> 00:35:24,375
And you.
Who shout and then speak calmly here?

325
00:35:29,174 --> 00:35:31,083
You do not understand yourself.

326
00:35:31,593 --> 00:35:33,466
I can always go.

327
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:35,838
Yes, go. Go away again.

328
00:35:37,058 --> 00:35:39,631
There is no worse hell
than when you are here.

329
00:35:41,728 --> 00:35:43,223
Berit!

330
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:51,982
Come here. Come and see dad.
Dont be afraid.

331
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:54,653
Is it hell when dad is here?

332
00:35:55,535 --> 00:35:57,075
You hurt him.

333
00:35:57,285 --> 00:36:00,286
And what are you doing here?

334
00:36:00,497 --> 00:36:02,705
It is you who hurt him,
nobody else.

335
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:05,870
Is it true, Berit?
Come and see dad.

336
00:36:06,545 --> 00:36:09,713
Dont touch her.
If you do, Ill slap you.

337
00:36:09,924 --> 00:36:11,751
But she is my child.

338
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:28,097
Poor little Berit who has
such a father. Poor little Berit.

339
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:31,273
My little Berit
who has such a father.

340
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,759
You came, all the same.

341
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:37,878
You didnt think I would?

342
00:37:38,305 --> 00:37:40,132
I thought you didnt want to.

343
00:37:44,518 --> 00:37:48,766
Shall we go to the cinema?
Theres a good film on at the Viktoria.

344
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:50,973
Gösta!

345
00:37:51,192 --> 00:37:52,769
What is it?

346
00:37:53,443 --> 00:37:54,904
You didnt want to come.

347
00:37:55,114 --> 00:37:58,529
I dont know. Maybe not.

348
00:37:59,117 --> 00:38:00,825
Why did you come?

349
00:38:06,124 --> 00:38:07,867
We have to go down here.

350
00:38:20,054 --> 00:38:21,845
Hello, Berit.

351
00:38:28,146 --> 00:38:29,687
Whos that there?

352
00:38:29,897 --> 00:38:33,349
Its LeCoq.
Hes the foreman at the factory.

353
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,189
Two seats at 2,50.

354
00:39:06,893 --> 00:39:08,435
Hi, Berit.

355
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:10,808
Are you freezing?

356
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:12,931
Look at those tits shes got.

357
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:15,521
- Whats the matter?
- Dont worry about it.

358
00:39:15,735 --> 00:39:17,774
Are you in a hurry or what?

359
00:39:17,987 --> 00:39:20,906
Come with us.
Drop that guy.

360
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:22,404
No, Gösta.

361
00:39:22,618 --> 00:39:24,942
I saved you several times at the
Factory, didnt I?

362
00:39:25,161 --> 00:39:27,450
Her bottom rolls well!

363
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:32,989
Berit, a chick like you would
be enough for three men.

364
00:39:34,628 --> 00:39:35,660
Get lost!

365
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,084
Lets go, Gösta.
Dont bother with them.

366
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:42,586
What did you say, kid?
You want a taste of the tilt hammer?

367
00:39:42,804 --> 00:39:44,595
Where will you find the arms?

368
00:39:44,805 --> 00:39:46,299
And if the police arrive?

369
00:39:46,515 --> 00:39:48,889
The police! You heard that?
What a hero!

370
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:53,101
Listen, pull in your chin
and save your breath.

371
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:55,185
Who dares to come?

372
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,942
Who dares to do what?

373
00:41:17,023 --> 00:41:18,566
Gösta! Look out!

374
00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:20,194
Behind you, Gösta!

375
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:32,030
Bunch of bastards!

376
00:41:38,544 --> 00:41:41,630
Bitchy girl from the reformatory!

377
00:41:49,181 --> 00:41:52,633
Wake up, Gösta!

378
00:42:03,612 --> 00:42:05,105
How do you feel?

379
00:42:10,077 --> 00:42:11,453
Leave me!

380
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,076
You didnt go back?

381
00:42:17,043 --> 00:42:17,909
Go back?

382
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:19,201
Yes.

383
00:42:20,172 --> 00:42:21,829
Look at your tights.

384
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:23,585
It doesnt matter.

385
00:42:23,799 --> 00:42:25,127
I will refund them to you.

386
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:26,967
Dont be silly.

387
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,381
It would be better if you could pay for a taxi.

388
00:42:34,225 --> 00:42:36,553
Help me to get these rags off.

389
00:44:00,272 --> 00:44:01,647
We dont have any rings.

390
00:44:01,856 --> 00:44:04,099
Put your left hand in your pocket.

391
00:44:04,317 --> 00:44:05,645
I havent got any pockets.

392
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,067
Keep your gloves. It looks very chic.

393
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:13,106
Because this weekend, we will
be a count and countess.

394
00:44:22,168 --> 00:44:26,794
Would a walk before dinner
suit you, Madam Countess?

395
00:44:27,883 --> 00:44:31,334
Why thank you, Mister Count.
What a charming idea!

396
00:44:48,527 --> 00:44:49,773
You rang?

397
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:52,194
No. Did you?

398
00:44:52,406 --> 00:44:53,236
No.

399
00:44:53,449 --> 00:44:56,701
Excuse me.
No, but was it you, Berit?

400
00:44:59,498 --> 00:45:00,529
Gertrud!

401
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,831
You are here, now?

402
00:45:07,048 --> 00:45:11,423
Ah, you know each other?
School friends?

403
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:13,795
You could say that.

404
00:45:14,262 --> 00:45:15,093
Your man?

405
00:45:15,305 --> 00:45:16,681
Yes, I am his man.

406
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,265
Congratulations, Berit.

407
00:45:18,474 --> 00:45:19,506
Thank you.

408
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:22,348
Not everyone
finishes up as well.

409
00:45:23,564 --> 00:45:24,596
Telephone me.

410
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:27,563
I would really like to speak with you.

411
00:45:28,736 --> 00:45:29,685
Of course.

412
00:45:31,113 --> 00:45:34,944
Excuse me. If you want
something, you only have to ring.

413
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:53,918
Promise to me one thing, Gertrud.
Do not speak about the family home.

414
00:45:54,136 --> 00:45:57,136
Not to please to me,
but for Gösta.

415
00:45:57,346 --> 00:45:58,889
He doesnt know anything?

416
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,181
Not, he doesnt know anything.

417
00:46:01,435 --> 00:46:02,680
Count on me.

418
00:46:02,895 --> 00:46:04,307
Really?

419
00:46:04,689 --> 00:46:07,225
Do you think that the old gang
is abandoning you?

420
00:46:07,649 --> 00:46:09,557
Thank you very much, Gertrud.

421
00:46:10,736 --> 00:46:12,147
Is he OK?

422
00:46:12,864 --> 00:46:14,237
Im sorry?

423
00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:16,032
He knows how to keep silent.

424
00:46:17,367 --> 00:46:21,496
Hes only a simple sailor.

425
00:46:21,873 --> 00:46:24,031
What are you doing here?

426
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:27,206
Hes celebrating my birthday.

427
00:46:28,296 --> 00:46:29,789
Thats nice.

428
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,297
Looks after him well.

429
00:46:33,509 --> 00:46:35,631
And you, how are you?

430
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,711
Thank you for asking.

431
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:42,015
I am just fine.

432
00:46:46,187 --> 00:46:47,434
You know Mrs. Krana?

433
00:46:49,693 --> 00:46:52,728
What do you mean?
Youre going to

434
00:46:53,152 --> 00:46:57,567
To see her, yes. I intend
to visit her very soon.

435
00:46:57,784 --> 00:46:59,444
Poor Gertrud.

436
00:46:59,661 --> 00:47:03,823
But she is sweet.
Can you lend me some money?

437
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:05,118
How much?

438
00:47:05,331 --> 00:47:07,658
I need 50 crowns.

439
00:47:07,919 --> 00:47:09,827
I can give you 25.

440
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:13,212
But be careful, Gertrud.

441
00:47:13,923 --> 00:47:15,669
To be careful.

442
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:23,505
Could you send the money
to the hotel?

443
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,891
Gertrud, cant I
help you differently?

444
00:47:29,732 --> 00:47:31,309
You are kind.

445
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:35,189
Go back and see your man, now.

446
00:47:35,404 --> 00:47:38,275
He will be wondering
what we are talking about.

447
00:48:24,286 --> 00:48:26,695
What were you talking about
for such a long time?

448
00:48:27,331 --> 00:48:30,949
Nothing spcial.
We just gossiped a little.

449
00:48:32,502 --> 00:48:34,828
Were you surprised to see her?

450
00:48:36,298 --> 00:48:38,540
I dont like her so much.

451
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:40,798
She is beautiful.

452
00:48:41,971 --> 00:48:43,252
Yes, not bad.

453
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:46,671
Whats the matter?

454
00:48:47,894 --> 00:48:48,973
Nothing.

455
00:48:49,854 --> 00:48:51,100
Nothing at all.

456
00:48:51,315 --> 00:48:53,638
- I said a stupid thing.
- No.

457
00:48:57,361 --> 00:48:59,485
Never leave me.

458
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:01,604
Yes,

459
00:49:02,408 --> 00:49:06,868
but do it quickly,
if not, it will do too much harm.

460
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:09,322
Why would I leave you?

461
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:12,499
Because you dont know.

462
00:49:12,836 --> 00:49:14,247
I dont know?

463
00:49:15,213 --> 00:49:18,463
I dont know what Im saying?
Yes, I do know.

464
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,884
I love you,
and I have said it more than once.

465
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:23,257
You have said it.

466
00:49:23,471 --> 00:49:24,847
Yes.

467
00:49:25,764 --> 00:49:27,343
You dont believe me?

468
00:49:29,602 --> 00:49:32,223
You, you never tell me
that you love me.

469
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:36,186
- Do it. If not
- Yes.

470
00:49:36,401 --> 00:49:37,861
Well, say it then.

471
00:49:39,529 --> 00:49:41,071
I dont want to.

472
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,817
I hate those words.

473
00:49:45,327 --> 00:49:48,079
Nobody takes them seriously.

474
00:49:48,498 --> 00:49:49,526
They want to

475
00:49:49,746 --> 00:49:51,407
Dont say anything.

476
00:49:51,957 --> 00:49:53,581
That hurts.

477
00:49:57,464 --> 00:50:00,037
Do you think I only said it
for that?

478
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,586
No

479
00:50:02,926 --> 00:50:04,209
Yes

480
00:50:04,722 --> 00:50:06,927
because each time you

481
00:50:08,392 --> 00:50:10,716
But I depend so much on you.

482
00:50:12,103 --> 00:50:14,891
I have only have that to give
in order to keep you

483
00:50:15,439 --> 00:50:18,441
And perhaps it is that
which will tire you out

484
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:22,395
When one really loves

485
00:50:22,614 --> 00:50:26,113
What makes you afraid
makes you love each other more.

486
00:50:26,534 --> 00:50:28,408
You must believe me.

487
00:50:29,703 --> 00:50:33,833
Why do some people have everything
and others nothing?

488
00:50:35,461 --> 00:50:38,247
It is terrible to be alone.

489
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,872
You have been so kind to me.

490
00:50:43,636 --> 00:50:45,922
My little one.

491
00:50:46,261 --> 00:50:51,258
Life is not as difficult
as people think. You will see.

492
00:50:51,477 --> 00:50:54,049
One day, luck will be on our side.

493
00:50:55,355 --> 00:50:58,438
And I will teach you to say
that you love me.

494
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:01,776
Excuse me, Gösta.

495
00:51:04,698 --> 00:51:07,070
How about a walk?

496
00:52:03,257 --> 00:52:04,835
Gösta.

497
00:52:06,135 --> 00:52:08,423
My dear Gösta,

498
00:52:14,602 --> 00:52:16,677
I thought you were asleep.

499
00:52:16,895 --> 00:52:20,264
Im not awake at all.
Im dreaming.

500
00:52:21,191 --> 00:52:22,435
What did you say?

501
00:52:24,904 --> 00:52:26,398
I am so stupid.

502
00:52:26,781 --> 00:52:29,236
I spoke to you the whole time.

503
00:52:29,824 --> 00:52:32,233
Repeat what you have just said.

504
00:52:35,373 --> 00:52:37,165
That I love you

505
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:40,332
that I adore you

506
00:52:41,086 --> 00:52:43,874
You see -
you finally learned it.

507
00:52:45,258 --> 00:52:47,000
You taught it to me.

508
00:52:47,843 --> 00:52:49,669
Are you happy now?

509
00:52:53,391 --> 00:52:56,392
It would have been better
If we had never met.

510
00:52:58,063 --> 00:53:02,012
Because now,
I know what happiness is,

511
00:53:02,233 --> 00:53:04,854
and everything will
become more difficult.

512
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:06,778
Are you starting again?

513
00:53:10,158 --> 00:53:12,398
I have thought so much.

514
00:53:13,785 --> 00:53:16,952
I have decided to tell you
everything that has happened to me.

515
00:53:17,789 --> 00:53:21,374
It would be better if you learnt it from me
than from others.

516
00:53:24,172 --> 00:53:25,286
It is difficult.

517
00:53:25,547 --> 00:53:26,578
Drop it.

518
00:53:26,798 --> 00:53:30,584
You dont leave school
on Sunday. Me neither.

519
00:53:30,804 --> 00:53:32,085
Its the past.

520
00:53:32,306 --> 00:53:34,296
I have to tell you.

521
00:53:34,764 --> 00:53:37,054
So that you dont accuse me later.

522
00:53:37,267 --> 00:53:37,966
Go ahead.

523
00:53:39,729 --> 00:53:41,805
Anyway, that is not important.

524
00:53:42,648 --> 00:53:44,723
We all have the right to live.

525
00:53:44,941 --> 00:53:46,316
Are you afraid?

526
00:53:46,818 --> 00:53:47,851
Me?

527
00:53:48,405 --> 00:53:49,436
No.

528
00:53:49,781 --> 00:53:51,275
Why do you think I am?

529
00:53:51,657 --> 00:53:53,282
I have that impression.

530
00:53:55,953 --> 00:54:00,532
I could easily accuse
my parents and say it is their fault.

531
00:54:02,001 --> 00:54:04,788
They didnt want to divorce
because of me.

532
00:54:05,796 --> 00:54:08,465
When dad was away at sea
it was still OK.

533
00:54:08,799 --> 00:54:11,469
But he was injured
in a torpedo attack

534
00:54:11,677 --> 00:54:13,835
and had to stay at home.

535
00:54:15,305 --> 00:54:17,264
And everything got worse.

536
00:54:18,226 --> 00:54:20,100
The house was a hell.

537
00:54:20,729 --> 00:54:24,941
In the evenings, I went out
with the other girls from school.

538
00:54:27,986 --> 00:54:30,392
I came back home
as late as possible,

539
00:54:30,612 --> 00:54:33,282
when my parents were asleep.

540
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:36,863
But one evening, mum was
waiting up for me

541
00:54:40,248 --> 00:54:42,204
Where were you all evening?

542
00:54:42,957 --> 00:54:47,835
That has never been a problem.
And it is not your business.

543
00:54:48,256 --> 00:54:49,965
Right, that is not my business.

544
00:54:50,175 --> 00:54:52,927
You will remain outside to reflect,

545
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,046
and you will learn
to come back on time.

546
00:54:55,471 --> 00:54:56,882
Mom!

547
00:55:01,852 --> 00:55:03,810
Mom, open the door!

548
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,430
Hello.

549
00:55:42,894 --> 00:55:44,934
Why are you sitting there?

550
00:55:45,147 --> 00:55:46,641
None of your business.

551
00:55:46,857 --> 00:55:48,647
Are you sad?

552
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:51,725
No. Dont worry about me.

553
00:55:52,695 --> 00:55:56,479
Your mother put you outside?
Or perhaps your father?

554
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,027
No.

555
00:55:58,243 --> 00:56:01,742
And you are waiting nicely
until they come and open the door.

556
00:56:02,997 --> 00:56:05,534
I dont know where to go.

557
00:56:09,004 --> 00:56:13,167
Can you imagine what they would think
if you disappeared?

558
00:56:16,595 --> 00:56:18,635
What?

559
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,228
Come and live at my house.

560
00:56:29,233 --> 00:56:31,308
Youre crazy.

561
00:56:31,526 --> 00:56:32,689
Come on.

562
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,114
Where do you live?

563
00:56:38,534 --> 00:56:40,241
You dont know?

564
00:56:40,452 --> 00:56:41,651
No.

565
00:56:43,163 --> 00:56:45,535
I have no idea.

566
00:56:45,749 --> 00:56:48,453
Follow me. I have my own pad.

567
00:56:48,668 --> 00:56:51,918
With all the traditional comforts.Come with me.

568
00:56:54,007 --> 00:56:55,466
No.

569
00:56:56,551 --> 00:56:58,176
I dont know if I dare to.

570
00:56:58,386 --> 00:57:02,217
Dont worry, little one -
I have honest intentions.

571
00:57:02,431 --> 00:57:04,924
Clean sheets
and one meal per day.

572
00:57:05,561 --> 00:57:08,562
Im called Thomas.
Ill say that once and for all.

573
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:12,770
Yes, Ill come with you.

574
00:57:13,694 --> 00:57:16,186
- And the name of the lady?
- Berit.

575
00:57:16,406 --> 00:57:19,855
Berit! How charming! Hello, Berit.

576
00:57:34,382 --> 00:57:36,789
We lived together.

577
00:57:37,009 --> 00:57:39,215
He was very kind to me,

578
00:57:40,512 --> 00:57:42,719
but they searched for me

579
00:57:43,224 --> 00:57:46,141
and somebody betrayed me to
the police.

580
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:49,428
At first it was the
Childhood Council.

581
00:57:50,648 --> 00:57:52,935
Then mum said that

582
00:57:53,149 --> 00:57:54,774
she couldnt do anything with me.

583
00:57:56,444 --> 00:57:58,686
She asked them to help.

584
00:57:59,741 --> 00:58:03,275
They took charge
and promised to arrange everything.

585
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:08,369
It was the Re-education Centre.

586
00:58:08,582 --> 00:58:10,160
With regard to

587
00:58:10,418 --> 00:58:14,414
the case of Berit lrne Holm,
the circumstances are clear.

588
00:58:14,962 --> 00:58:18,463
referring to paragraph 220
of the Law on Protection of Children,

589
00:58:18,676 --> 00:58:19,874
we have decided

590
00:58:20,136 --> 00:58:23,753
according to the paragraph of the same law,
taking into consideration

591
00:58:24,014 --> 00:58:26,682
that there is no other solution,

592
00:58:26,932 --> 00:58:28,595
and according to paragraph 24,

593
00:58:28,854 --> 00:58:31,059
to take the girl into our charge

594
00:58:31,564 --> 00:58:35,811
by placing her in a reformatory
for girls.

595
00:58:36,026 --> 00:58:37,225
With immediate effect.

596
00:58:54,961 --> 00:58:58,083
Passengers travelling to
Göteborg, please board now.

597
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,126
Close the doors.

598
00:59:35,378 --> 00:59:37,951
As you have arranged everything properly,

599
00:59:38,506 --> 00:59:43,748
I wondered where we should go
during our stop at Stockholm.

600
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:48,714
Id like to give to the girls
a memory before they leave,

601
00:59:48,932 --> 00:59:51,769
from which they can
draw strength.

602
00:59:52,812 --> 00:59:55,303
Thats really nice of you.

603
01:00:00,778 --> 01:00:03,982
Im sure the girls will really
appreciate it.

604
01:00:07,242 --> 01:00:10,278
That time hurt me more
than I thought.

605
01:00:10,997 --> 01:00:14,330
I wanted to scream
out of fear and loneliness.

606
01:00:15,459 --> 01:00:18,495
It was OK in the winter
and in spring,

607
01:00:18,878 --> 01:00:20,541
but the summer was horrible.

608
01:01:10,598 --> 01:01:13,717
For Gertrud, it was worse.

609
01:01:15,101 --> 01:01:19,432
Every night, she went and
slept with the gardener.

610
01:01:20,483 --> 01:01:23,484
She wanted to break the rules,

611
01:01:24,154 --> 01:01:28,862
like cigarettes, perfume,
and lipstick,

612
01:01:29,826 --> 01:01:31,819
and real underwear.

613
01:02:38,185 --> 01:02:40,311
I was there for fourteen months.

614
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:45,225
Afterwards, they placed me with a lady
who had a social hobby. [?]

615
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:50,816
At work, we were
closely watched all the time.

616
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:53,823
The lady had a nice son.

617
01:02:54,743 --> 01:02:56,867
He had a bit of a crush on me.

618
01:02:57,789 --> 01:03:02,368
Mum surprised us one day,
and of course she reported it.

619
01:03:03,002 --> 01:03:06,454
Later, I ran away
to Stockholm.

620
01:03:07,967 --> 01:03:11,335
They caught me again -
the second time.

621
01:03:13,347 --> 01:03:16,929
They put me in another place
for more than two years.

622
01:03:18,268 --> 01:03:22,978
When I got out, I had to work
at the factory, where I met Gunnar.

623
01:03:23,524 --> 01:03:27,984
He was so nice. He didnt care
that Id been in prison.

624
01:03:29,112 --> 01:03:31,070
I could go to see his parents.

625
01:03:31,949 --> 01:03:34,106
They were kind, too.

626
01:03:35,326 --> 01:03:37,819
I thought it was all over.

627
01:03:39,206 --> 01:03:42,989
Then one day, there was a catastrophe,
and everything fell apart.

628
01:03:44,336 --> 01:03:48,881
We thought you were Gunnars girlfriend
but you didnt say anything.

629
01:03:49,134 --> 01:03:51,373
We cannot forgive that.

630
01:03:52,594 --> 01:03:54,920
- Its not true?
- She was afraid.

631
01:03:55,139 --> 01:03:57,216
We must always tell the truth.

632
01:03:58,142 --> 01:03:59,517
What shall we do?

633
01:04:00,894 --> 01:04:02,518
There is one thing to do.

634
01:04:02,771 --> 01:04:04,350
I will leave with Berit.

635
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:05,806
Be quiet.

636
01:04:06,025 --> 01:04:07,400
But it is true.

637
01:04:07,609 --> 01:04:08,808
It is for your own good.

638
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:12,320
Its pointless to drive me out.
I can leave by myself.

639
01:04:16,368 --> 01:04:17,779
Dont follow me.

640
01:04:17,995 --> 01:04:19,573
It was my fault.

641
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:24,249
I thought youd said everything.
You told me.

642
01:04:24,501 --> 01:04:26,541
I know, I know.

643
01:04:26,962 --> 01:04:27,876
Goodbye.

644
01:04:28,089 --> 01:04:29,796
Will we see each other again?

645
01:04:30,006 --> 01:04:31,204
No.

646
01:04:31,549 --> 01:04:33,840
You want to say
that you dont want to see me again?

647
01:04:34,054 --> 01:04:35,512
It is finished.

648
01:04:35,763 --> 01:04:38,882
Youre not going to hurt yourself?

649
01:04:41,853 --> 01:04:44,060
I threw myself in the water,

650
01:04:45,733 --> 01:04:47,853
just before I met you.

651
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:54,447
Now, you know.

652
01:04:58,577 --> 01:05:00,072
Arent you leaving?

653
01:05:03,624 --> 01:05:04,905
Well, go then!

654
01:05:05,502 --> 01:05:10,079
Dont worry about me.
Do as you wish.

655
01:05:15,345 --> 01:05:17,670
How many guys have you had?

656
01:05:19,807 --> 01:05:21,466
No, Gösta

657
01:05:23,311 --> 01:05:25,848
Why didnt you kill yourself?

658
01:06:01,516 --> 01:06:03,924
You look soft, sailor.
Its a chick?

659
01:06:04,144 --> 01:06:07,394
Before, they had to stab me
to get out the marrow.

660
01:06:08,647 --> 01:06:10,807
Perhaps she dumped you?

661
01:06:11,443 --> 01:06:14,859
You should have seen
the chick I went out with!

662
01:06:15,113 --> 01:06:16,192
What a number!

663
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:17,899
Your mouth!

664
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:19,487
What is it?

665
01:06:19,701 --> 01:06:21,693
Calm down, calm down, my friends.

666
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:24,071
Make an effort, Gösta.

667
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:43,765
Youll find another.

668
01:06:44,017 --> 01:06:47,052
Those who speak about love
are mistaken.

669
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:51,519
Everything is difficult. Why
cant we be ourselves?

670
01:06:52,276 --> 01:06:57,187
We can forgive our own
faults, but not those of others.

671
01:06:57,406 --> 01:07:00,241
Yes, its the same everywhere.

672
01:07:00,492 --> 01:07:03,826
We want to be just.
Its a pity for Berit.

673
01:07:04,036 --> 01:07:09,114
If you want to play
at saving the world, be careful.

674
01:07:10,085 --> 01:07:11,663
It is so absurd.

675
01:07:11,878 --> 01:07:14,665
Absurd?

676
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:17,669
Everything is.

677
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:22,053
You are so ironic.
You have to believe

678
01:07:22,264 --> 01:07:26,130
In what?
Women? Justice?

679
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:28,094
Brotherhood?

680
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:33,307
Not, everywhere, it is the same misery,
the same shit.

681
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:35,684
There is nothing?

682
01:07:35,901 --> 01:07:37,016
Dont speak to me about it.

683
01:07:37,236 --> 01:07:40,274
- What else?
- Idiot. The girl!

684
01:07:40,824 --> 01:07:43,279
If you need to
hold someones hand,

685
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:46,244
take hers. Only she loves you.

686
01:07:46,454 --> 01:07:48,247
You want to say: forget everything?

687
01:07:48,457 --> 01:07:50,165
You can always try.

688
01:07:51,751 --> 01:07:55,287
Yes One can always try.

689
01:08:09,978 --> 01:08:11,258
What is it?

690
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:14,516
And you?

691
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,146
Why dont you eat anything?

692
01:08:19,655 --> 01:08:21,363
I dont have any appetite.

693
01:08:43,218 --> 01:08:44,596
Whos that guy?

694
01:08:45,014 --> 01:08:46,294
Its Gunnar.

695
01:08:46,515 --> 01:08:47,760
Oh, him.

696
01:08:49,018 --> 01:08:52,102
The one before me, that you talked about.

697
01:08:52,812 --> 01:08:54,307
He looks fine.

698
01:08:54,648 --> 01:08:55,811
You think so?

699
01:08:56,191 --> 01:09:00,237
He looks sharp. Very sharp.

700
01:09:01,655 --> 01:09:04,857
Wonderful. Was he as wonderful as he looks?

701
01:09:06,243 --> 01:09:10,655
We could become buddies
with this guy. If we bump into him.

702
01:09:11,289 --> 01:09:13,746
Hes exactly the type I like.

703
01:09:14,544 --> 01:09:17,461
I know very well
that you loved him.

704
01:09:17,671 --> 01:09:18,500
Get lost!

705
01:09:18,713 --> 01:09:20,338
Youre so odd.

706
01:09:21,216 --> 01:09:22,711
What have I done?

707
01:09:23,887 --> 01:09:25,844
Why torture yourself?

708
01:09:26,056 --> 01:09:27,678
Dont mess around.

709
01:09:28,932 --> 01:09:30,805
I cant bear it any more.

710
01:09:31,227 --> 01:09:32,686
Get lost, I said.

711
01:09:35,063 --> 01:09:38,930
I know - I should have told you
when we first met.

712
01:09:39,692 --> 01:09:41,438
Its all my fault.

713
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,773
Go then.

714
01:09:46,451 --> 01:09:48,738
Nothing is worse than that.

715
01:09:48,952 --> 01:09:50,992
Dont cry! That drives me crazy!

716
01:09:56,002 --> 01:09:57,412
Telephone.

717
01:10:02,925 --> 01:10:04,123
Hello.

718
01:10:04,468 --> 01:10:05,666
Hello.

719
01:10:06,844 --> 01:10:10,346
Oh its you, Gösta.

720
01:10:13,144 --> 01:10:15,432
Berit has told me so much about you.

721
01:10:15,938 --> 01:10:17,101
Oh right.

722
01:10:17,858 --> 01:10:19,684
Take care of her.

723
01:10:22,112 --> 01:10:25,111
I will tell you one thing:
she doesnt listen to me.

724
01:10:25,322 --> 01:10:28,443
I dont know why.
Its as if she hates me.

725
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:32,158
Its not easy to say,
but I am her mother.

726
01:10:37,085 --> 01:10:39,078
Ive thought about it a lot:

727
01:10:39,545 --> 01:10:42,167
To grow up there, where
we were fighting, is not easy.

728
01:10:42,382 --> 01:10:45,298
It wasnt always nice at home.

729
01:10:46,552 --> 01:10:48,509
Ill tell you another thing.

730
01:10:50,306 --> 01:10:54,007
Her father has very sensitive nerves.

731
01:10:55,228 --> 01:11:00,269
We always have tried
to be just and honest, but

732
01:11:01,233 --> 01:11:02,727
You understand

733
01:11:02,943 --> 01:11:06,230
You know that Berit
has been in a family home.

734
01:11:08,783 --> 01:11:11,452
I think that helped a lot.

735
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:14,995
Shes not a slut,
but shes had lots of boyfriends.

736
01:11:15,207 --> 01:11:16,666
Its true.

737
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:19,910
But if youre fond of Berit,
as I hope you are,

738
01:11:20,127 --> 01:11:21,621
you should know everything.

739
01:11:21,837 --> 01:11:24,080
Thank you. I already know everything.

740
01:11:27,927 --> 01:11:31,758
I would be so happy if you could
stay together. For Berits sake.

741
01:11:31,971 --> 01:11:35,093
She has a bad character.
She gets it from her father.

742
01:11:38,522 --> 01:11:40,063
- Let me go.
- Where are you going?

743
01:11:40,273 --> 01:11:42,811
- Why does it matter?
- Tell me where you are going.

744
01:11:43,026 --> 01:11:44,400
To see Gertrud.

745
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:45,606
Why?

746
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:47,979
She called me. She needs me.

747
01:11:48,407 --> 01:11:51,657
Stay there and listen to mum.
You will learn my true nature.

748
01:11:52,034 --> 01:11:53,658
Its good to know.

749
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,744
Go away with this girl.

750
01:12:02,046 --> 01:12:05,296
I cant keep her here.
You understand, dont you?

751
01:12:07,216 --> 01:12:11,345
She says it hurts.
Its normal after anesthesia.

752
01:12:11,972 --> 01:12:14,381
I made the usual intervention.

753
01:12:14,598 --> 01:12:16,390
Shes not dangerous.

754
01:12:17,059 --> 01:12:19,099
The foetus will come out
in a few days.

755
01:12:19,646 --> 01:12:24,141
Yes, it hurts, but not so much.
Thats her nerves.

756
01:12:24,692 --> 01:12:26,186
How do you feel?

757
01:12:26,402 --> 01:12:27,979
Thank you for coming.

758
01:12:28,362 --> 01:12:31,732
We must leave from here.
But it hurts so much

759
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:34,776
You must leave.

760
01:12:35,579 --> 01:12:39,363
I have made hundreds of
interventions. None has failed.

761
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:41,622
Im very careful.

762
01:12:42,335 --> 01:12:44,660
I dont take risks.

763
01:12:45,964 --> 01:12:47,542
You must leave.

764
01:12:48,258 --> 01:12:50,464
But where?

765
01:12:51,302 --> 01:12:55,762
I dont know.
I have no idea.

766
01:12:56,559 --> 01:12:58,468
I cant go back.

767
01:12:59,145 --> 01:13:00,555
You, you know?

768
01:13:00,771 --> 01:13:02,596
Ill call a taxi.

769
01:13:03,356 --> 01:13:05,230
What has she done?

770
01:13:05,442 --> 01:13:07,234
She gave me an injection.

771
01:13:07,778 --> 01:13:12,439
At first, it was really bad,
but I had a sedative.

772
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:15,197
It began just before I left.

773
01:13:17,204 --> 01:13:19,076
Im so scared.

774
01:13:20,248 --> 01:13:21,279
Where will we go?

775
01:13:21,499 --> 01:13:23,373
Yes, where will we go?

776
01:13:23,584 --> 01:13:25,080
The taxi is here.

777
01:13:25,296 --> 01:13:27,668
Wait, I know where we can go.

778
01:13:51,696 --> 01:13:53,939
You really have to whistle that? [?]

779
01:13:55,409 --> 01:13:56,785
Am I crazy?

780
01:13:57,911 --> 01:14:00,947
Its just that that
drives me completely nuts.

781
01:14:55,427 --> 01:14:56,921
Gustav wants to speak.

782
01:14:57,137 --> 01:14:58,715
Not, we wont open.

783
01:15:02,186 --> 01:15:06,395
Hell break everything.
Ask him what he wants.

784
01:15:08,733 --> 01:15:09,812
What is it?

785
01:15:10,026 --> 01:15:11,733
Gertrud is sick.

786
01:15:34,508 --> 01:15:36,382
Im getting out of here.

787
01:15:38,303 --> 01:15:39,548
She needs a doctor.

788
01:15:39,763 --> 01:15:40,759
No doctor.

789
01:15:40,973 --> 01:15:43,048
She may be sent away.

790
01:15:43,266 --> 01:15:44,597
Why?

791
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:45,968
Oh, no!

792
01:15:46,187 --> 01:15:48,512
No, no doctor, no doctor!

793
01:15:48,731 --> 01:15:52,728
I dont want to go back there,
I dont want to, I dont want to.

794
01:15:54,362 --> 01:15:56,236
But what can we do?

795
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:08,705
Call an ambulance.

796
01:16:24,892 --> 01:16:27,562
I feel so strange, Berit.

797
01:16:28,813 --> 01:16:30,769
Do you think its dangerous?

798
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,559
Im so scared, Berit.

799
01:16:38,572 --> 01:16:41,147
I think its bleeding a lot.

800
01:16:42,285 --> 01:16:45,536
You have to help me somehow.

801
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:04,135
Theres a lot?

802
01:17:06,058 --> 01:17:08,264
I dont understand
what she did.

803
01:19:14,563 --> 01:19:15,844
Gösta.

804
01:19:28,954 --> 01:19:30,613
Please follow me.

805
01:20:39,897 --> 01:20:43,599
Look how Joe
is nice to you,

806
01:20:44,111 --> 01:20:45,903
and he doesnt even know you.

807
01:20:46,614 --> 01:20:50,610
It is for you, he would say,
and you certainly need it.

808
01:20:51,909 --> 01:20:53,951
I told him you were drunk.

809
01:20:55,373 --> 01:20:57,531
He heard the lapping inside you.

810
01:21:01,461 --> 01:21:04,297
Was it your friend who
was taken away in an ambulance?

811
01:21:16,018 --> 01:21:17,014
What was wrong with her?

812
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:18,218
She died.

813
01:21:20,230 --> 01:21:21,513
Oh, shit!

814
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,732
You dont need to cry.

815
01:21:27,738 --> 01:21:30,444
Be happy that you
are being looked after.

816
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,278
I was rather sad.

817
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,737
I had hardly drunk anything.

818
01:21:44,129 --> 01:21:46,417
Joe said you have nice eyes.

819
01:21:49,386 --> 01:21:50,797
Hes right.

820
01:21:54,849 --> 01:21:56,925
But do not cry.

821
01:22:00,355 --> 01:22:04,187
It is the drop of water
that makes the vase overflow.

822
01:22:05,526 --> 01:22:10,234
When the boat sinks,
one throws oneself into the sea.

823
01:22:11,657 --> 01:22:14,362
One tries to swim
to firm ground.

824
01:22:15,368 --> 01:22:16,995
To swim.

825
01:22:17,957 --> 01:22:21,491
To swim in the South
Sea, anywhere,

826
01:22:21,877 --> 01:22:25,209
where one isnt sucked up
by whirlwinds.

827
01:22:26,714 --> 01:22:28,838
sucked up, you see.

828
01:22:31,468 --> 01:22:35,548
Thats how it is, Mr Andersson.

829
01:22:38,352 --> 01:22:42,217
You said conscience - no.

830
01:22:42,437 --> 01:22:46,900
You are a new baby [?]
who cries at the back,

831
01:22:47,569 --> 01:22:51,437
and wipes its tears.
because it misses its mother.

832
01:22:55,243 --> 01:22:58,160
What a conscience!

833
01:23:06,503 --> 01:23:08,497
You know how old I am?

834
01:23:09,132 --> 01:23:11,040
Twenty-nine.

835
01:23:11,633 --> 01:23:13,427
You didnt believe it, did you?

836
01:23:15,806 --> 01:23:17,929
Me neither.

837
01:23:22,812 --> 01:23:25,648
Have you ever seen dead toes?

838
01:23:25,942 --> 01:23:28,430
Ever seen a dead man?

839
01:23:30,361 --> 01:23:35,320
Did you ever see a pig with two legs
That weighs 70 kilos

840
01:23:37,034 --> 01:23:40,983
Somebody asked you to
remain,

841
01:23:42,375 --> 01:23:43,833
and you left!

842
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:48,827
I saw all that.

843
01:23:49,214 --> 01:23:52,049
But I do not draw any
Conclusions from it,

844
01:23:52,884 --> 01:23:55,256
in spite of my twenty-nine years.

845
01:23:58,932 --> 01:24:01,802
Because I have no
conscience, you see.

846
01:24:04,604 --> 01:24:05,849
And you then

847
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:08,685
Reply!

848
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:33,255
Stupid conscience.

849
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:36,384
Stupid conscience.

850
01:24:55,154 --> 01:24:56,436
Open, open!

851
01:25:08,752 --> 01:25:10,958
My God, look at that.

852
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:12,250
What is it?

853
01:25:12,464 --> 01:25:16,332
What a spectacle!
Get out of there, old man. [?]

854
01:25:23,599 --> 01:25:26,804
Thats it - love, for you.

855
01:25:27,021 --> 01:25:30,851
You drank Its not worth the trouble,
really not.

856
01:25:31,107 --> 01:25:32,766
Get it out. [?]

857
01:26:43,055 --> 01:26:44,680
Berit!

858
01:27:02,908 --> 01:27:06,907
You can go back. We dont
need you any more.

859
01:27:07,413 --> 01:27:08,991
Thank you.

860
01:27:13,251 --> 01:27:15,161
She could have told me.

861
01:27:15,879 --> 01:27:19,331
It wouldnt have affected me
If she had had a child.

862
01:27:20,425 --> 01:27:22,501
Now she is dead.

863
01:27:23,929 --> 01:27:27,015
The Lord has given and He has taken away.

864
01:27:28,684 --> 01:27:32,220
I always knew that my daughter
was destined for misfortune.

865
01:27:33,022 --> 01:27:35,394
She never gave me happiness.

866
01:27:36,609 --> 01:27:37,889
It is better this way.

867
01:27:39,237 --> 01:27:40,945
Im going.

868
01:27:42,156 --> 01:27:45,572
Thank you all
for your kindness.

869
01:27:51,373 --> 01:27:56,831
Miss Holm, could you give me
the address of this abortionist?

870
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,718
Berit, do you understand
that your silence harms you?

871
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:07,049
Murderers must be stopped,
mustnt they?

872
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:14,099
This abortionist has killed your friend
and you want to protect her?

873
01:28:15,607 --> 01:28:20,184
I knew a girl from a good family
who got pregnant by a useless guy.

874
01:28:20,819 --> 01:28:22,613
She aborted herself.

875
01:28:23,074 --> 01:28:26,109
With the help
of the Health Council

876
01:28:26,326 --> 01:28:27,869
and a well-known surgeon.

877
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:30,360
How does that concern us?

878
01:28:32,165 --> 01:28:35,368
Those who do not have the means
must get by somehow.

879
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:38,377
With such consequences?

880
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:41,037
It is the risk that they take.

881
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,249
We should be grateful that
we can get help.

882
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:45,839
You hear! [?]

883
01:28:46,096 --> 01:28:47,174
Stop.

884
01:28:47,429 --> 01:28:51,761
Calm down. Wouldnt it have been better
if your friend had had this child?

885
01:28:53,854 --> 01:28:54,802
I dont know.

886
01:28:55,688 --> 01:28:57,930
Would you have
acted in the same way?

887
01:28:59,276 --> 01:29:00,355
Yes.

888
01:29:07,408 --> 01:29:08,404
Whore!

889
01:29:08,618 --> 01:29:11,986
If you do not calm down,
I shall ask you to leave.

890
01:29:27,470 --> 01:29:32,512
I think that assistant Villander
has something to propose.

891
01:29:32,726 --> 01:29:35,181
That depends, yes.

892
01:29:37,313 --> 01:29:39,056
What then?

893
01:29:43,361 --> 01:29:46,612
If you give me the
address of this abortionist,

894
01:29:46,824 --> 01:29:50,691
we will arrange things so that
you do not come before the law.

895
01:29:50,994 --> 01:29:56,416
I promise I will do all I can
so that you avoid trouble.

896
01:29:58,127 --> 01:29:59,584
You dont believe me

897
01:30:00,502 --> 01:30:02,626
No. Why should I believe you?

898
01:30:03,089 --> 01:30:05,332
You have my word of honor.

899
01:30:07,136 --> 01:30:09,377
Help us now, Berit.

900
01:30:09,596 --> 01:30:10,758
Why?

901
01:30:13,057 --> 01:30:15,266
Does somebody have a cigarette?

902
01:30:19,941 --> 01:30:24,518
Morally, I am by no means
offended by your attitude,

903
01:30:24,736 --> 01:30:27,108
but I am angry
because you are stupid.

904
01:30:28,115 --> 01:30:33,453
You understand that this will get you
at least three years.

905
01:30:33,662 --> 01:30:36,865
And perhaps it will be prison,
I dont know exactly.

906
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:39,655
But you dont care, of course.

907
01:30:41,463 --> 01:30:42,707
Very well.

908
01:30:43,005 --> 01:30:44,998
This affair must follow its course.

909
01:30:46,426 --> 01:30:48,583
Come in.

910
01:30:58,395 --> 01:31:00,102
Follow me.

911
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:17,454
I will say it.

912
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:19,951
I will say it.

913
01:31:21,252 --> 01:31:22,745
I will tell everything.

914
01:32:07,966 --> 01:32:10,290
Excuses me, I am a

915
01:32:11,344 --> 01:32:12,755
What, Gösta?

916
01:32:15,806 --> 01:32:19,804
I said, excuse me
because I am an idiot.

917
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:26,639
Im happy that youre here.

918
01:32:28,193 --> 01:32:28,976
You missed me?

919
01:32:32,238 --> 01:32:35,325
Yes, I missed you.

920
01:32:43,668 --> 01:32:45,661
Lets get out of here. [?]

921
01:32:46,255 --> 01:32:49,337
We cant.
What if we get picked up?

922
01:32:49,548 --> 01:32:54,840
No worry. Ill talk to
my buddy. He knows what to do.

923
01:33:09,193 --> 01:33:11,021
Let me speak.

924
01:33:11,446 --> 01:33:13,983
Hello, little Dutch boy. [?]

925
01:33:15,449 --> 01:33:16,481
The captain.

926
01:33:17,118 --> 01:33:19,075
I can speak a little German.

927
01:33:19,287 --> 01:33:21,244
Hey, me too.

928
01:33:21,622 --> 01:33:23,199
We want to speak.

929
01:33:23,415 --> 01:33:27,034
with your
Oberkommandogeneralführer.

930
01:33:38,389 --> 01:33:39,932
Do you speak English?

931
01:33:41,810 --> 01:33:44,014
You have a beautiful boat.

932
01:33:44,269 --> 01:33:49,182
I have two friends -
a boy and a girl.

933
01:33:49,442 --> 01:33:53,570
They would like to leave from here,
you see.

934
01:33:53,779 --> 01:33:54,893
For Antwerp.

935
01:33:56,614 --> 01:34:01,657
I understand.
A Swede who wants to leave Sweden.

936
01:34:03,832 --> 01:34:07,581
We will arrange that. Come.

937
01:34:21,224 --> 01:34:22,054
So?

938
01:34:22,267 --> 01:34:26,100
Everything is arranged. It went like it was
on casters. We leave tomorrow.

939
01:34:26,314 --> 01:34:28,851
- It is expensive?
- No more than its worth.

940
01:34:30,985 --> 01:34:33,819
- Youre regretting it?
- Regret? Me?

941
01:34:34,571 --> 01:34:35,982
What do you mean?

942
01:34:37,616 --> 01:34:38,696
Youre not saying anything.

943
01:34:38,910 --> 01:34:41,149
One cannot speak all the time.

944
01:34:43,079 --> 01:34:45,037
It is strange to run away like this.

945
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,708
You did it before.

946
01:34:46,917 --> 01:34:48,576
Yes, I did.

947
01:35:00,556 --> 01:35:03,473
- I thought of something.
- What?

948
01:35:08,605 --> 01:35:10,977
A year ago,
our situation was worse.

949
01:35:11,191 --> 01:35:15,270
Now, many things have changed
to make us think carefully about it. [?]

950
01:35:16,738 --> 01:35:19,359
You mean its ridiculous to leave.

951
01:35:19,574 --> 01:35:20,949
I didnt say that.

952
01:35:42,723 --> 01:35:45,474
So many things
havent yet been settled.

953
01:35:45,683 --> 01:35:49,727
The supervision, your mother, my work.

954
01:35:50,064 --> 01:35:53,349
All kinds of worries,
its true.

955
01:35:53,567 --> 01:35:56,355
Its too much for us.

956
01:35:56,612 --> 01:35:59,945
But we are together.
It wasnt like that before.

957
01:36:00,824 --> 01:36:02,484
I am worthless.

958
01:36:02,701 --> 01:36:04,694
Yes, for me.

959
01:36:07,581 --> 01:36:09,739
It is certainly our destiny.

960
01:36:12,878 --> 01:36:16,043
Something tells me
its stupid to leave.

961
01:36:16,255 --> 01:36:20,041
They probably wont arrest us,
but it will be stupid for us.

962
01:36:20,261 --> 01:36:23,096
- You believe that too.
- You too.

963
01:36:23,305 --> 01:36:26,056
And it isnt any more difficult
for me than it is for you.

964
01:36:26,266 --> 01:36:27,975
Im more used to it.

965
01:36:30,313 --> 01:36:34,391
I really want to speak
with all these people.

966
01:36:34,607 --> 01:36:35,603
The assistante?

967
01:36:35,817 --> 01:36:37,857
Yes. And with your mother too.

968
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:40,560
and the devils grandmother
if I have to.

969
01:36:44,284 --> 01:36:45,279
Whats the matter?

970
01:36:45,493 --> 01:36:50,286
We stay. Everything is clear
for me, now. We stay.

971
01:36:51,918 --> 01:36:53,661
Itll be difficult. But itll be alright.

972
01:36:53,878 --> 01:36:59,382
People like us do not leave,
and are not discouraged.

973
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:03,383
No. And the summer will soon be here.
