1
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,920
My name is Yasmin.

2
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,719
I am three months pregnant.

3
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,860
It is said that everyone is born equal
according to the law.

4
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,060
That is not what happens
in my world.

5
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,400
Who would want to be born
between chaos and hatred?

6
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:29,619
I decided to protect my child from evil.

7
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,840
FRONTIER(S)

8
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,924
My choice...

9
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:52,579
In the second round of the
Presidential elections…

10
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:00,399
A massive anger...

11
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:05,899
...By the actions of the police.

12
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,899
The riots started...

13
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,779
...Against the authorities of extreme right.

14
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:20,719
The situation worsens...

15
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:20,318
We're almost there, c'mon!

16
00:04:21,398 --> 00:04:23,318
Not so fast!

17
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,198
Stop!

18
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,999
A little more.

19
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:16,118
- Not so fast.
- OK.

20
00:05:24,238 --> 00:05:26,158
Stop!

21
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:29,603
Alex, don't do stupidities!

22
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:32,458
- What are you doing, Alex?!
- Stop!

23
00:05:32,443 --> 00:05:32,443
Stop, Alex!

24
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,698
- Do not move!
- Alex, stop, for fuck's sake!

25
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:37,118
Now what?!
Stand up!

26
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,508
What's going on?

27
00:05:40,558 --> 00:05:42,478
Did you think you were so tough?

28
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:44,518
Motherfucker!

29
00:05:53,758 --> 00:05:56,778
- Let him be!
- For fuck's sake!

30
00:05:57,638 --> 00:05:59,398
Alex, relax!

31
00:05:59,448 --> 00:06:01,158
Run, fast!

32
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:10,618
- What?
- Sami is injured and bleeding!

33
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:12,498
What have you been doing?

34
00:06:12,547 --> 00:06:14,277
Fuck!

35
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:18,458
- He's gonna die, your brother will die!
- Let's take to a hospital!

36
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:20,243
No, wait for me.

37
00:06:20,278 --> 00:06:23,198
Yasmin, do not do anything.
Wait.

38
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:25,603
So we sit down and watch?

39
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:28,658
Can't you understand?!
I said you to wait!

40
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:35,698
- You are an idiot, Sami is injured!
- Is it my fault?

41
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:35,922
Sam wanted it.

42
00:06:35,957 --> 00:06:38,203
- We'll go the three of us.
- What do you think?

43
00:06:38,238 --> 00:06:41,458
- They went away from us because you hurted her!
- Yasmin is my girl!

44
00:06:43,077 --> 00:06:45,397
Come on, be careful!

45
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:19,178
- Farid stop.
- This is to remember.

46
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:20,837
We've arrived.

47
00:07:21,797 --> 00:07:23,308
You have taken too much!

48
00:07:23,358 --> 00:07:25,978
- Where were you?
- The streets are filled with barricades.

49
00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:29,427
We must take him away from here.

50
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:30,597
We don't need him.

51
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:34,057
- Isn't it risky?
- Don't say anything about my brother.

52
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:37,057
- It was your fault!
- And you?, were you on vacations?!

53
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:40,118
- Idiot!
- Calm!

54
00:07:40,477 --> 00:07:43,157
Well, think what
we are going to do, okay?

55
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:45,838
- I'll bring him to the hospital!
- They'll catch you.

56
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:49,727
You are right, but what if we don't carry him?

57
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:51,817
- It's not your decision?
- Shut the fuck up!

58
00:07:53,437 --> 00:07:55,357
Son of a bitch.

59
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:58,557
Tom, he needs a real doctor.

60
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:00,882
Well, this is what we'll do...

61
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:04,737
You go with Farid and then we will
meet in a hostel near the border

62
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:08,557
I'll accompany them to the hospital.
We will leave him and we will meet with you.

63
00:08:08,637 --> 00:08:10,557
Okay.

64
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:15,537
I won't go with this idiot.
I prefer to die!

65
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:18,577
It's over, motherfucker.
Do what you want.

66
00:08:18,612 --> 00:08:19,162
Please.

67
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:21,117
- Please, Farid Take me with you.
- I can not.

68
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,797
I do not want to stay here.

69
00:08:35,237 --> 00:08:37,157
What do you want?

70
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:40,596
- How do you feel?
- I could be better.

71
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,107
What about the baby?

72
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:46,577
Now you care?
You no longer cheat anyone.

73
00:08:47,477 --> 00:08:50,522
- We can manage by ourselves.
- Yas.

74
00:08:50,557 --> 00:08:54,177
It's enough. I will abort
and you'll be calm.

75
00:08:54,212 --> 00:08:55,536
Do not do that to me.

76
00:08:55,996 --> 00:08:57,916
I do it for myself.

77
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:22,277
Farid, you are a complete idiot.
Do you want them to find us?

78
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:22,876
Quiet.

79
00:09:23,117 --> 00:09:25,037
- How much?
- 1125...

80
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:28,997
...plus this and this.

81
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:34,916
- I suppose you know that is not for us.
- There's enough.

82
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:37,937
- What are you going to do with it?
- Why do you want to know?

83
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:40,796
- It is necessary to decide something.
- I am not yet dead, son of a bitch!

84
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,837
- She is good with the whole world.
- Get in there!

85
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:50,416
Okay, can we go, boss?

86
00:09:51,276 --> 00:09:53,296
Are you going to leave us?

87
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:55,357
Then we leave.

88
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:07,876
Good luck, Sami.

89
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:27,178
The authorities have decided
an exemplary punishment

90
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:29,617
for the incendiary.
The have sent more police.

91
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:36,256
Each detainee will be brought to the barracks
overall for identification.

92
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:42,436
We will go faster by overthere.
If you don't want to run.

93
00:10:48,476 --> 00:10:50,396
- Shut the fuck up!
- Hurry up, ok?!

94
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:55,116
Don't touch me!

95
00:10:55,316 --> 00:10:57,236
- Can't you go faster?
- It's enough!

96
00:11:04,076 --> 00:11:05,996
Hold him.

97
00:11:07,316 --> 00:11:09,236
Just her.

98
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:10,916
Son of a bitch...

99
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:23,516
Everything will be fine.

100
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:25,626
Hold, Sami, hold.

101
00:11:25,676 --> 00:11:28,796
- What happened?
- Help us, please, I beg you.

102
00:11:29,796 --> 00:11:33,916
- What happened?
- Haven't you been aware of the shootings in the city?

103
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:38,156
- Now I return.
- Quick.

104
00:11:45,515 --> 00:11:47,435
Hold.

105
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,195
Yas...

106
00:11:50,635 --> 00:11:53,155
I'll take care of him.

107
00:11:54,116 --> 00:11:56,536
Let the baby be born.

108
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:02,756
Is it worth...

109
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,836
Being a mother... without a future?

110
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:08,315
Fuck them all, it is not their problem.
It's your life.

111
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,635
I love you, Sami.

112
00:12:18,995 --> 00:12:20,915
I love you so much...

113
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:23,235
I love you, Yas...

114
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:25,635
I love you.

115
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:30,196
They're coming.

116
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:35,226
Go away quickly.

117
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:39,496
- I won't leave you!
- You have something important to bring.

118
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:43,075
I won't leave you!
No, no...

119
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:48,196
Go...

120
00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:53,396
Hey you!

121
00:12:54,636 --> 00:12:58,656
Please, we must
ask you some questions.

122
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:01,015
Stop or we'll arrest you!

123
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:02,795
Stop!

124
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:08,195
It is done?!

125
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:08,665
Move!

126
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:11,435
- What the fuck happened there?
- Move!

127
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:14,615
Stop!

128
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:16,115
Shit!

129
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:19,945
They almost grab you.

130
00:13:19,995 --> 00:13:23,915
Your brother will sing.
We are full of shit.

131
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,995
Sami won't betray us.

132
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,395
He died, Alex!

133
00:13:32,715 --> 00:13:35,635
I want you to take me to my house.

134
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:38,715
I beg you.

135
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,795
I will not say anything, I swear.

136
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:47,694
That was not the agreement.
Now we can not retreat.

137
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,855
- I am already calm.
- Me too.

138
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,795
We are already well away.

139
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:17,815
Is this still France?

140
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,265
Yes, the deepest.

141
00:14:19,314 --> 00:14:22,434
Is there any better place
in this country than this?

142
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:28,435
Did you want to stay in the city?

143
00:14:29,474 --> 00:14:31,394
Maybe.

144
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:35,555
I should have gone to my father's
funeral with Bleude.

145
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,520
But I was late...

146
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:39,675
And I could not leave the district in time.

147
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:44,095
I said that if I walked out of there again
I won't no longer return ever.

148
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:49,274
And there is nobody wait for me.

149
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:51,314
Not even a girlfriend?

150
00:14:52,754 --> 00:14:54,344
Fool.

151
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,784
There's no girl behind.

152
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:02,715
- Why do we stop?
- Shut up.

153
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,435
- What?
- Get out.

154
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:07,034
Why?

155
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:10,354
Out!.

156
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:15,374
- Sorry, but the money stays with me.
- What?

157
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:20,375
- But why?
- I have said you to leave.

158
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:26,974
I want to relax in your seat!

159
00:15:27,914 --> 00:15:29,504
It hurts me.

160
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:30,999
Stop, don't fool around.

161
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:35,354
- It's the last fucking time I ask you to leave!
- Ok, I'm going out.

162
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:40,474
Don't panic, it was a joke.

163
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:41,554
We'll rest here.

164
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:42,599
Idiot.

165
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:44,344
Don't cry, you have to be a man.

166
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:48,484
Were you scared?

167
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:51,374
A little, motherfucker.

168
00:15:51,394 --> 00:15:53,314
Hello?

169
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:55,434
Tom, it's me.

170
00:15:56,754 --> 00:16:00,174
We are on the way.

171
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:04,714
No, it's okay.
They have said that he'll survive.

172
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:07,119
Where are you?

173
00:16:07,154 --> 00:16:09,474
Still three hours.

174
00:16:09,754 --> 00:16:11,674
Until then.

175
00:16:12,234 --> 00:16:14,154
Why haven't you said it to them?

176
00:16:15,593 --> 00:16:17,279
There is no need to complicate it further.

177
00:16:17,314 --> 00:16:20,234
You are not alone,
We are all involved.

178
00:16:23,314 --> 00:16:25,934
I feel sick.

179
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:27,888
I am going to puke.

180
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:29,543
I think I'll quit.

181
00:16:29,593 --> 00:16:32,313
- Really?
- My mother will behappy.

182
00:16:32,674 --> 00:16:35,494
She'll believe that I have matured.

183
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:41,314
- I need to sleep.
- Me too.

184
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:45,393
- What sets there?
- "Rooms".

185
00:16:45,428 --> 00:16:47,953
There is always something free in those sites.

186
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:51,474
Border>
<Dachville 2.5 km

187
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:40,573
It costs money.

188
00:17:40,754 --> 00:17:44,874
- Man, this is not Panama.
- This is the perfect place..

189
00:17:51,713 --> 00:17:55,933
Good site.

190
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:01,798
Good evening.

191
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:06,053
Is there any room for rent?

192
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:10,673
Here everything is possible.

193
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:20,933
- The rooms are free.
- Then we will be your visitors.

194
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:21,503
How much do you have?

195
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:22,038
Much.

196
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:24,393
We will be two more.

197
00:18:26,953 --> 00:18:29,373
- Is it possible a second room?
- Three.

198
00:18:33,193 --> 00:18:35,613
I must register you.

199
00:18:35,953 --> 00:18:37,598
Goetz, a customers!

200
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:40,353
- I can not stand it.
- Quiet.

201
00:18:41,672 --> 00:18:44,392
Hey, Goetz, are you asleep or what?!

202
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,118
What's going on?

203
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:09,573
Is the number two ready?

204
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:12,712
How long?

205
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:14,752
One evening.

206
00:19:19,112 --> 00:19:22,432
Ok, you can stay.
Girls, take care of their lodging.

207
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:26,102
Thanks.

208
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:28,972
- A drink?
- It will be a pleasure.

209
00:19:32,513 --> 00:19:36,833
They won't belive we found
this two beauties.

210
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:41,033
You're... incredible.

211
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,463
Very kind.

212
00:19:43,513 --> 00:19:45,433
¿What's the matter with you?

213
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:46,902
Dude, this is rare...

214
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,372
You're so charming boys.
You're a gift from heaven.

215
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:59,073
Do you have something to show us?
We're losing time.

216
00:19:59,108 --> 00:19:59,472
Won't you have forgotten it?

217
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:04,053
Here comes married people, but I see that
you are very emotionally impulsive.

218
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:07,227
I assume he is the leader

219
00:20:07,262 --> 00:20:10,061
Farid, don't tell that silly topics.

220
00:20:11,353 --> 00:20:13,373
You are right, Gilberte.

221
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,753
I am impulsive.

222
00:20:15,992 --> 00:20:17,912
I am impulsive here...

223
00:20:19,232 --> 00:20:21,152
...And here too.

224
00:20:31,393 --> 00:20:34,013
Aren't you ashamed?

225
00:20:34,472 --> 00:20:36,692
No, no.
I have a girlfriend.

226
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:42,717
What's going on?
We must reach out to the end.

227
00:20:42,752 --> 00:20:45,672
Dude, we have to drive tomorrow
All day...

228
00:20:45,707 --> 00:20:47,772
Enough of nonsense!
This is something for adults.

229
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:50,112
Do we continue?

230
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:56,312
I see that you aren't getting bored.

231
00:20:58,272 --> 00:21:00,557
At least they aren't pussies.

232
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,012
Gilberte, take them to the room.

233
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:07,152
Finish there.

234
00:21:07,512 --> 00:21:09,432
- Are we going?
- Me?

235
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:12,412
You wanted to finish.

236
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:14,219
Claudia, take care of the other...

237
00:21:14,254 --> 00:21:15,991
We'll have a good time together.

238
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,502
We go up at once.

239
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:19,472
No, I am going to call my girlfriend.

240
00:21:21,152 --> 00:21:23,072
I promised her.

241
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,412
You do not know what you're losing.

242
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,912
Shit.

243
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:23,631
Fuck, they're sweet.

244
00:22:24,272 --> 00:22:26,592
Come here, I'm gonna fix you.

245
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:31,952
I'm ready...

246
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:38,151
Come, come, come...

247
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:42,352
I have girlfriend!

248
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:50,651
Dude, fuck her well!.

249
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:54,711
Leave me!

250
00:22:57,551 --> 00:22:59,771
Be a man!

251
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:18,101
What's going on?

252
00:23:18,151 --> 00:23:21,871
I did not think we would have this
familiar meal so soon...

253
00:23:21,906 --> 00:23:23,531
It's called "hospitality".

254
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:26,111
Pass the dishes.

255
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:36,271
Thanks.

256
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:39,251
Let's see what you have done in your kitchen.

257
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:41,871
It will be good to recover forces.

258
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,950
Really?

259
00:23:58,991 --> 00:24:00,911
Delicious, what is it?

260
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,750
It is fried pork.

261
00:24:04,871 --> 00:24:07,036
You won't freeze tonight.

262
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:10,076
It'll be good for you, you are decrepit.

263
00:24:10,111 --> 00:24:12,831
Sorry, but I don't eat pork.
My religion doesn't allow.

264
00:24:15,191 --> 00:24:17,116
Are you Jewish?

265
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:20,271
No, I am Muslim.
Just I do not like pork.

266
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,070
Girls help me.

267
00:24:27,031 --> 00:24:29,551
Claudia, open her mouth.

268
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,380
Move away.

269
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,250
- Mom, make an effort.
- Come on!

270
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,910
Mom, open your mouth.

271
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,870
Are you cheating us?

272
00:24:45,671 --> 00:24:48,991
If you do not open, we no longer help you.

273
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,590
Do you understand?

274
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:55,691
Swallow, shit.
I'm gonna get angry!

275
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,910
- Didn't she like the food?
- What is all this for?

276
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,475
You treat your mother as a dummy.

277
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,730
We must help mom,
or she'll lose the appetite...

278
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,750
Okay.
Well, well.

279
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,490
- Are you tired? - I do not like these
family reunions, but good profit.

280
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,290
- Hey, stay.
- What's going on?

281
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,630
You were right, Farid.
They are whores.

282
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,370
No, no, sorry... I's a joke.

283
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,555
He doesn't know what he's saying.

284
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:35,510
What's the matter with you?
Are you sick or what?

285
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,460
She liked me to spank her ass...

286
00:25:41,495 --> 00:25:43,030
And she even wanted more.

287
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:46,009
I told you that they were whores.

288
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,074
We went too fast.

289
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:52,229
It hurted me.
She mattered to me.

290
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:55,109
Shit, Yas...

291
00:25:55,509 --> 00:25:58,529
They'll kill us.
Better don't say anything.

292
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,675
Really?

293
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,100
¿What's going on there?
We won't arrive until another two hours.

294
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,270
Pretty good.
What about you?

295
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:10,749
Everything was wrong.

296
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,790
We had problems at the hospital.

297
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,980
I understand.

298
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,580
- Are where are you?
- In a small hotel, as we agreed..

299
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:23,269
I send you the address by SMS.

300
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:26,309
Don't say anything to Farid.

301
00:26:26,344 --> 00:26:27,419
Understood.

302
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:29,389
See you, kisses.

303
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,555
Why do you whisper?

304
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,410
- Why are you scared?
- For that people.

305
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,190
Fuck.

306
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,830
Damned whore.

307
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,430
Of these.

308
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:04,789
What's going on?

309
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:07,429
Nothing.

310
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:11,954
Newsflash.

311
00:27:11,989 --> 00:27:14,060
The Minister of Interior is officially
Candidate for the presidency of the Republic,

312
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:18,035
He's the subject of the protests.

313
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,690
Instability in the country mark
presidential pre-campaign.

314
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:25,349
The police remains in state of
maximum alert.

315
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,070
Fart!

316
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,650
I'I strangle them with my own hands.

317
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:33,994
For them.

318
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:35,394
Country of fascists.

319
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:40,049
France and the USA...
Bush govern here for ten years.

320
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:44,394
What do you want?

321
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,849
Nothing.
Somebody wants to see you.

322
00:27:49,989 --> 00:27:52,009
Good evening.

323
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:56,589
Good evening.

324
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,989
- Do you know why I am here?
- Not yet.

325
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,869
Where are you from?

326
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:08,249
From Paris.

327
00:28:08,629 --> 00:28:11,549
So you're one of those who
burn cars?

328
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:16,329
Will yo do the same thing here?

329
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:18,354
Were you lost down the road?

330
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:20,809
- We're driving to Holland...
- I do not speak to you, idiot.

331
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:25,113
Now what?

332
00:28:25,148 --> 00:28:27,469
He says the truth, we are going to Amsterdam
to see some friends.

333
00:28:28,588 --> 00:28:30,073
And...

334
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,923
You wanted to fuck.

335
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:34,613
You were looking for some whores.

336
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:37,269
And you came here...

337
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:39,988
Thinking that this was a brothel.

338
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:43,428
No, wait...

339
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:47,168
We are just normal people...

340
00:28:48,989 --> 00:28:52,209
- Do you mean that my sisters are bitches?
- No, no...

341
00:28:53,028 --> 00:28:56,148
- Did you arrive to the end?
- What?!

342
00:28:56,708 --> 00:29:00,028
Did you?
Don't you understand the question?

343
00:29:00,063 --> 00:29:03,429
Did you?
Answer.

344
00:29:05,748 --> 00:29:09,968
Yeap...

345
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:14,311
Hands up.

346
00:29:14,346 --> 00:29:16,954
Hurry!

347
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:18,314
What have we done?

348
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:22,259
- Gilberte told me that you have a bag with money.
- This is madness.

349
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,273
Liar!

350
00:29:23,308 --> 00:29:25,628
- It's there.
- Gilberte, What do you say?!

351
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:28,429
This is our clothes, as you can see...

352
00:29:28,749 --> 00:29:29,858
Goetz!

353
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:32,928
We are screwed, fast!

354
00:29:38,188 --> 00:29:39,738
Tom!

355
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:42,708
Stop or I shoot you!

356
00:29:44,468 --> 00:29:46,388
Freeze!

357
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:53,749
I said you to stop!

358
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:01,329
- I'll prepare the luggage.
- Stop!

359
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:06,668
Tom, brother.

360
00:30:06,718 --> 00:30:08,308
Do not move!

361
00:30:11,588 --> 00:30:14,208
Goetz, you didnt't killed him!

362
00:30:27,748 --> 00:30:30,068
Catch them!

363
00:30:34,588 --> 00:30:37,108
Fast, to the car!

364
00:30:39,668 --> 00:30:42,588
They're shooting!

365
00:30:55,148 --> 00:30:57,068
They chase us!

366
00:30:58,028 --> 00:30:59,948
They chase us!

367
00:31:10,428 --> 00:31:12,348
Hurry, faster!

368
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:18,588
Drive faster!

369
00:31:26,227 --> 00:31:28,847
Quick, burn the pedals!

370
00:31:38,427 --> 00:31:40,647
Faster!

371
00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:45,807
They're by our side!
Quicker!

372
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,787
Watch where you go!

373
00:32:12,427 --> 00:32:14,347
- What now?
- To the left.

374
00:32:33,587 --> 00:32:35,507
So what?

375
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:41,287
They left the road and
fell by the bridge.

376
00:32:41,467 --> 00:32:43,887
I took this.

377
00:32:46,067 --> 00:32:47,987
Claudia!

378
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:09,287
Farid, help me.

379
00:33:11,427 --> 00:33:13,347
Farid, help me.

380
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,547
Farid, I beg you, stand me up slowly...

381
00:33:30,827 --> 00:33:32,747
Stand up, with care...

382
00:33:38,107 --> 00:33:40,627
Slowly.

383
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,307
Carefully.

384
00:33:44,987 --> 00:33:47,507
Quiet.

385
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,927
Where are we?

386
00:34:19,827 --> 00:34:22,047
Are you OK?

387
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:31,946
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

388
00:34:31,996 --> 00:34:35,327
Some of our relatives stopped here.

389
00:34:35,347 --> 00:34:38,067
Are family of Tom and Farid?

390
00:34:38,102 --> 00:34:39,071
Are they here?

391
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:42,926
Not really,
they went to another motel.

392
00:34:43,346 --> 00:34:48,166
- Why they didn't stay here?
- We have no vacant rooms.

393
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:49,946
Can you show us the way?

394
00:34:49,981 --> 00:34:52,032
You can follow me.

395
00:34:52,067 --> 00:34:56,187
Claudia, you won't join us,
You wait.

396
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:00,391
Come on.

397
00:35:00,426 --> 00:35:03,137
Why does she gives me orders?!

398
00:35:03,172 --> 00:35:03,711
I can't stand that!

399
00:35:03,746 --> 00:35:07,631
- Obey Gilberte.
- I am not her dog.

400
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:11,517
Hold a little!
Soon you'll occupy her site!

401
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:21,616
Karl!

402
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:24,271
Goetz!
I blocked the road.

403
00:35:24,306 --> 00:35:28,126
Get back fast, father does not like to wait.

404
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:44,486
Where are we?
Where are we going?

405
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:46,926
I can't stand this smell.. Corpses.

406
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:50,485
Better hold, ok?

407
00:35:51,786 --> 00:35:54,906
We should turn around.

408
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:03,506
Where to? to hell?

409
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:06,266
We'll try to cross it.

410
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:07,545
Will you go first?

411
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,146
Come on.

412
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,506
1,2,3...

413
00:36:15,946 --> 00:36:17,866
Are you OK?

414
00:36:21,545 --> 00:36:23,465
What is there?

415
00:36:28,626 --> 00:36:30,946
I see some lights!

416
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,945
I think I will go behind you.

417
00:36:38,305 --> 00:36:40,525
Hey what?!

418
00:36:55,545 --> 00:36:57,465
Go, come on.

419
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:08,666
- Come on.
- Shit, I can not breathe.

420
00:37:08,946 --> 00:37:10,866
I can not.
Come on.

421
00:37:12,185 --> 00:37:14,105
I can not breathe.

422
00:37:18,546 --> 00:37:20,465
A little more!

423
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:33,786
Tom, we almost arrived.

424
00:37:36,225 --> 00:37:38,145
Go on.

425
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:55,545
- It's over, I'm stucked.
- We've almost arrived.

426
00:37:55,905 --> 00:37:57,910
- I won't give you more advice.
- Neither myself.

427
00:37:57,945 --> 00:38:00,664
- Tom try!
- I told you I'm stucked!

428
00:38:02,025 --> 00:38:04,445
I'm stucked, fuck!

429
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:10,505
Mom, where are you?

430
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:15,105
Mom, I'm dying...

431
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:17,185
Mom!

432
00:38:19,105 --> 00:38:21,625
Tom, only a little bit more. Go.

433
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:24,385
No!

434
00:38:25,465 --> 00:38:27,585
Shit, you will be a man or a pussy?!

435
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,375
I'm stucked!

436
00:38:29,425 --> 00:38:31,345
Go, c'mon!
An effort!

437
00:38:31,395 --> 00:38:33,224
¡Ahead!

438
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,674
- Go ahead Tom!
- We almost arrive...

439
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:39,025
Come on!

440
00:38:39,345 --> 00:38:41,265
Come on!

441
00:38:51,624 --> 00:38:53,204
Tom...

442
00:38:53,254 --> 00:38:54,014
Hurry!

443
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:55,984
Faster, for fuck's sake!

444
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:58,104
Quick!

445
00:39:00,825 --> 00:39:02,744
There's someone behind us!

446
00:39:03,305 --> 00:39:04,414
Come on!

447
00:39:04,464 --> 00:39:06,384
Fuck!

448
00:39:20,505 --> 00:39:22,425
Go out, Tom.

449
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:51,344
- At the end of the road, right.
- In what hole are we?

450
00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:55,464
Those were miner wells.
They were closed at the beginning of the century.

451
00:40:34,024 --> 00:40:35,429
Do not be in a hurry.

452
00:40:35,464 --> 00:40:37,384
I will notify that you have arrived.

453
00:41:44,064 --> 00:41:45,983
No!

454
00:41:46,063 --> 00:41:47,983
Begone!

455
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:49,663
No!

456
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:05,423
Don't pay attention to her.
She's sick.

457
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:07,144
Good evening.

458
00:42:07,544 --> 00:42:09,464
Good evening.

459
00:42:10,783 --> 00:42:12,703
Sit down.

460
00:42:13,663 --> 00:42:15,583
Thanks.

461
00:42:21,903 --> 00:42:24,323
Claudia, boil some water.

462
00:42:32,623 --> 00:42:34,428
This is for hunters.

463
00:42:34,463 --> 00:42:37,353
They organize good hunting parties.

464
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,973
Where are you heading to?

465
00:42:40,008 --> 00:42:41,028
Towards the Netherlands.

466
00:42:41,063 --> 00:42:43,183
We have some business there.

467
00:42:43,218 --> 00:42:45,303
Do you have a towel, please?

468
00:42:45,338 --> 00:42:46,823
Yes.

469
00:42:50,983 --> 00:42:52,903
I will bring it to you.

470
00:42:59,783 --> 00:43:02,603
- Are you married?
- We are no longer together.

471
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:07,183
There is a small door.

472
00:43:14,782 --> 00:43:17,002
SURGICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA

473
00:43:55,142 --> 00:43:58,062
Are you hungry?
Do you want something to drink?

474
00:43:58,097 --> 00:43:59,863
Not.
Thanks.

475
00:44:19,862 --> 00:44:21,782
Come here!

476
00:44:21,832 --> 00:44:23,382
Quiet!

477
00:44:30,463 --> 00:44:31,533
He's coming.

478
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:34,467
Claudia, help me.

479
00:44:34,502 --> 00:44:37,187
- Who comes?
- Father.

480
00:44:37,222 --> 00:44:41,142
Stay straight,
he dislikes people who relaxes.

481
00:44:58,942 --> 00:45:04,262
We welcome you, lady of the road.

482
00:45:26,382 --> 00:45:29,502
What's your name?

483
00:45:29,902 --> 00:45:33,222
Yasmin.

484
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,902
Irhant.

485
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,362
Your hand.

486
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:08,761
Go away...

487
00:46:09,782 --> 00:46:11,702
Tom!

488
00:46:16,502 --> 00:46:18,422
Go outta here...

489
00:46:50,662 --> 00:46:52,582
Run...

490
00:46:56,461 --> 00:46:59,181
Don't stop...

491
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:22,656
- What's going on?
- Get up.

492
00:47:22,691 --> 00:47:23,146
- What?
- We leave.

493
00:47:23,181 --> 00:47:26,901
- What happened?
- Let's go to the car.

494
00:47:26,936 --> 00:47:27,426
What is this?

495
00:47:27,461 --> 00:47:30,281
- Okay. It is enough.
Our friend was killed there.

496
00:47:31,581 --> 00:47:33,048
Alex!

497
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,515
Yas!

498
00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:36,061
Karl!

499
00:47:53,301 --> 00:47:57,121
Bring him to the grill and
cook him with fat.

500
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:11,121
Listen, son...

501
00:48:12,501 --> 00:48:15,121
We must renew the blood of the family.

502
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,640
But I have doubts.

503
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:28,501
I do not know if she is appropriate.

504
00:48:28,821 --> 00:48:31,341
She has a too dark complexion.

505
00:48:34,021 --> 00:48:37,341
That hair, the eyes...

506
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:42,360
She does not have pure blood,

507
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,660
But we have no other choice.

508
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,040
You need a wife
to occupy my seat.

509
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:54,921
She will be your wife.

510
00:48:59,861 --> 00:49:03,081
Remember to protect the race.

511
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:00,680
Eve, bleed him, I'll finish him later.

512
00:52:23,419 --> 00:52:26,139
- I will see what's happening over there.
- They are the children.

513
00:53:34,819 --> 00:53:38,339
Are your children loose by the mine again, right?

514
00:53:38,419 --> 00:53:40,704
I will see what happens.

515
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:43,159
Surely there's a good meat.

516
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:49,178
I will go with you, Claudia.

517
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,618
Pull!

518
00:54:23,378 --> 00:54:25,298
Stop!

519
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:29,459
Hurry!

520
00:54:38,898 --> 00:54:40,818
Shit.

521
00:54:54,338 --> 00:54:56,258
Stop!

522
00:54:58,138 --> 00:55:01,158
Look in the engine room.

523
00:55:14,018 --> 00:55:16,538
Hey little, where are you?

524
00:55:21,617 --> 00:55:25,037
Where have you hidden, little?

525
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:29,278
Fuck you, bastard.

526
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:45,577
I won't leave you, Alex.

527
00:55:45,612 --> 00:55:46,063
Yas...

528
00:55:46,098 --> 00:55:48,342
Run for help.

529
00:55:48,377 --> 00:55:51,197
- Seek help!
- No!

530
00:55:51,232 --> 00:55:52,698
No!

531
00:55:54,137 --> 00:55:56,057
Go!

532
00:55:56,698 --> 00:55:57,927
Go away!

533
00:55:57,977 --> 00:56:00,497
I said you to go.

534
00:56:00,532 --> 00:56:02,097
Hurry!

535
00:56:06,978 --> 00:56:08,898
Fast!

536
00:56:32,657 --> 00:56:34,577
Move away.

537
00:56:37,937 --> 00:56:39,857
Cross.

538
00:57:18,257 --> 00:57:20,177
Open!

539
00:57:20,497 --> 00:57:23,117
Open it!

540
00:57:37,137 --> 00:57:39,057
Run.

541
00:57:39,417 --> 00:57:42,137
What's going on with you?

542
00:57:42,172 --> 00:57:43,857
Hurry!

543
00:57:52,216 --> 00:57:54,136
I love you.

544
00:57:55,257 --> 00:57:57,277
Escape quickly.

545
00:57:57,497 --> 00:57:59,417
I said you to go away.

546
00:58:07,337 --> 00:58:09,257
Not yet.

547
00:58:10,537 --> 00:58:12,457
Go.

548
00:58:13,096 --> 00:58:14,207
Go now!

549
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:16,677
Quick, do not be afraid!

550
00:58:24,977 --> 00:58:26,897
Cross.

551
00:58:37,256 --> 00:58:39,176
Go and give notice.

552
00:58:40,816 --> 00:58:44,536
Do not you confront with anyone here.

553
00:59:14,016 --> 00:59:15,936
Open!

554
00:59:16,776 --> 00:59:18,696
Open!

555
01:00:07,056 --> 01:00:08,976
Out, move!

556
01:00:22,456 --> 01:00:24,465
Where is the girl?

557
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,475
Screw you, fucking Nazi!

558
01:00:29,415 --> 01:00:32,235
What did you say?
Fast!

559
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:35,215
Bring me the pliers.

560
01:00:35,975 --> 01:00:37,941
Don't...

561
01:00:37,976 --> 01:00:40,396
What are you going to do?

562
01:00:41,416 --> 01:00:44,336
I will make sure that
you won't walk again.

563
01:00:55,016 --> 01:00:56,936
Hold.

564
01:00:58,816 --> 01:01:00,736
So...

565
01:01:03,496 --> 01:01:07,316
In Africa, the guards did the same to
diamond seekers

566
01:01:07,855 --> 01:01:14,175
to remove the desire
to escape for a long time

567
01:01:23,816 --> 01:01:31,736
loaded with some brilliants.

568
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:32,260
Not yet...

569
01:01:32,295 --> 01:01:32,835
Almost...

570
01:01:33,935 --> 01:01:36,555
Finished.

571
01:01:37,615 --> 01:01:39,460
This is the time of pain...

572
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:43,815
And the thieves were still working.

573
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:48,555
They worked!

574
01:01:50,015 --> 01:01:55,235
They worked free!

575
01:03:14,935 --> 01:03:16,855
Stop!

576
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:25,105
I beg you to help me!

577
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,075
I must call the police!

578
01:03:27,535 --> 01:03:29,855
Come in, lady.

579
01:03:58,854 --> 01:04:01,674
This is the wrong road.

580
01:04:01,734 --> 01:04:04,054
Not.
I'm taking you home.

581
01:04:05,974 --> 01:04:07,894
No!

582
01:04:10,215 --> 01:04:12,135
Quiet!

583
01:04:13,014 --> 01:04:14,934
Close!

584
01:04:15,695 --> 01:04:17,615
Leave it closed!

585
01:04:18,575 --> 01:04:20,495
Shut up!

586
01:04:26,734 --> 01:04:28,654
Not...

587
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:52,014
Hans!

588
01:05:04,294 --> 01:05:06,214
Yas!

589
01:05:06,254 --> 01:05:08,774
Superb.

590
01:05:14,454 --> 01:05:17,574
You have a last wish.

591
01:05:17,853 --> 01:05:20,173
Talk.

592
01:05:21,094 --> 01:05:23,814
Finish me.

593
01:05:35,454 --> 01:05:37,774
For the family!

594
01:05:47,373 --> 01:05:49,293
Remove it.

595
01:05:52,173 --> 01:05:54,593
You have successfully pissed me off.

596
01:06:01,053 --> 01:06:03,473
Take him, Hans, for conservation.

597
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:06,053
Let's wash her.

598
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:28,753
You are pregnant.

599
01:07:30,093 --> 01:07:33,013
That's great...

600
01:08:31,613 --> 01:08:34,733
This will give you heat.

601
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:40,932
You will be soon
a member of the family.

602
01:08:49,453 --> 01:08:55,873
You'll sleep in my quiet room
until you're ready

603
01:08:55,908 --> 01:08:56,493
Is it okay?

604
01:08:57,573 --> 01:09:01,993
What do you think?

605
01:09:01,577 --> 01:09:01,577
I know...

606
01:09:01,612 --> 01:09:07,932
I have something that can help.

607
01:09:11,252 --> 01:09:15,097
We are very similar.

608
01:09:15,132 --> 01:09:19,052
Father is happy
You are pregnant.

609
01:09:21,092 --> 01:09:24,112
Drink.

610
01:09:25,532 --> 01:09:30,252
Everything will be more bearable.

611
01:09:30,287 --> 01:09:31,377
Drink.

612
01:09:31,412 --> 01:09:35,332
This helps me when I make children.

613
01:09:40,812 --> 01:09:42,266
Give me.

614
01:09:42,301 --> 01:09:44,692
Is it strong, isnt't it?

615
01:09:46,612 --> 01:09:49,332
Take.

616
01:09:53,932 --> 01:09:57,352
- More, quick.
- No.

617
01:09:57,452 --> 01:10:01,372
In your state you have to be
more carefully.

618
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:37,211
It's beautiful.

619
01:10:37,412 --> 01:10:40,232
You have to cut it.

620
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:47,292
Father doesn't like black hair.

621
01:10:54,372 --> 01:10:57,691
Father said that we are a unique breed.

622
01:10:58,851 --> 01:11:03,670
We arrived here after World War II.

623
01:11:04,891 --> 01:11:08,736
I was stolen from my parents when
I was small..

624
01:11:08,771 --> 01:11:16,390
They promised me that my parents
will come if I was obedient.

625
01:11:16,811 --> 01:11:25,230
Father wants you to madure quickly
to bring babies.

626
01:11:25,265 --> 01:11:25,265
Now I am the bride of Hans.

627
01:11:26,211 --> 01:11:29,531
Our children are born sick.

628
01:11:30,092 --> 01:11:32,496
They are deformed.

629
01:11:32,531 --> 01:11:35,251
I'm expecting the fourth, but father said
that is by our blood.

630
01:11:37,212 --> 01:11:40,932
Why don't you escape?

631
01:11:41,011 --> 01:11:46,031
I still hope that my parents
will come to visit me.

632
01:11:49,451 --> 01:11:51,091
They promised.

633
01:11:51,126 --> 01:11:52,731
I know that they will come.

634
01:11:52,971 --> 01:11:56,091
Good children aren't abandoned.

635
01:11:56,126 --> 01:11:58,096
I know what I am talking about.

636
01:11:58,131 --> 01:12:00,951
I love children.

637
01:12:05,651 --> 01:12:08,571
Father wanted to get rid of
them in the gas chamber.

638
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:12,176
Before father did that,
Hans and I hid them.

639
01:12:12,211 --> 01:12:17,031
Now they're living in the mine's tunnels
by the side of the farm.

640
01:12:17,211 --> 01:12:21,816
Sometimes I visit them.

641
01:12:21,851 --> 01:12:27,971
I'd die here without them.

642
01:13:24,290 --> 01:13:31,210
Here is our guest.

643
01:13:36,691 --> 01:13:44,111
We ask you to sit.

644
01:13:44,146 --> 01:13:44,351
Sit all of you.

645
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:04,095
For the new mother,

646
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:07,651
For our happy and
wonderful family.

647
01:14:09,331 --> 01:14:12,551
And the next and happy event..

648
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:16,576
For the birth.

649
01:14:16,611 --> 01:14:19,231
If she's a girl she'lll be named Lilith.

650
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:23,230
If he's a child he'll be named Karl,
like his father,

651
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:32,550
who now will join our dear and beautiful Yasmin.

652
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:42,590
This wil be a good year
of great achievements.

653
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:50,349
Everyday you'll listen the sound of
the wind of victory.

654
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:57,850
It is time to announce that I have decided
to trust the care of our family

655
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:07,890
to my only son,
whom I am proud of, Karl Von Geisler.

656
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:12,414
I ask you to stand up.

657
01:15:12,449 --> 01:15:18,169
Thank you, father,
This is a great honour.

658
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:24,890
From now on, you all will respond
of your words and actions,

659
01:15:27,009 --> 01:15:32,629
before your brother, my son, Karl.

660
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:42,410
You all must help
my beloved daughter, Gilberte.

661
01:15:44,409 --> 01:15:48,029
This goes especially for you,

662
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:51,090
Hans.

663
01:16:29,609 --> 01:16:33,929
It seems that you were good friends.

664
01:16:38,169 --> 01:16:40,614
You are sick.

665
01:16:40,649 --> 01:16:43,769
It seems that you need more
help than me.

666
01:16:54,729 --> 01:16:58,414
Gilberte, my beloved daughter,

667
01:16:58,449 --> 01:17:04,069
Can you explain to the lady the
fate that awaits her?

668
01:17:06,849 --> 01:17:10,069
As I said, we wait for the the child
of the lady

669
01:17:13,649 --> 01:17:16,469
As a sign of providence.

670
01:17:19,329 --> 01:17:21,039
Besides,

671
01:17:21,089 --> 01:17:24,109
he's the only unborn member of
our great race.

672
01:17:34,288 --> 01:17:37,933
No way.

673
01:17:37,968 --> 01:17:40,888
Be friendlier with father
you need to respect him.

674
01:17:40,923 --> 01:17:43,528
You won't teach me what to do!

675
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:47,669
What a great authority of the
new commander.

676
01:17:47,848 --> 01:17:50,068
Goetz!

677
01:18:00,328 --> 01:18:02,548
Karl!

678
01:18:02,769 --> 01:18:05,389
Tell her to stand up.

679
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:12,029
Stand up!

680
01:18:14,088 --> 01:18:17,108
And now...

681
01:18:23,928 --> 01:18:27,148
This will be your sole and
new family,

682
01:18:29,128 --> 01:18:32,548
So put an end to these
unnecessary disputes.

683
01:19:14,448 --> 01:19:23,428
For the pure blood!

684
01:19:39,128 --> 01:19:41,548
Let me go!

685
01:19:42,927 --> 01:19:45,647
- Leave him!
- Let me go!

686
01:19:47,688 --> 01:19:51,608
Don't come closer or
I cut his throat!

687
01:19:51,643 --> 01:19:52,853
You open the door!

688
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:56,028
- Put the shotgun away!
- I'll shoot you two!

689
01:19:56,063 --> 01:19:59,128
I will make you bleed and
die as a pig!

690
01:19:59,448 --> 01:20:03,588
Hans, lower the gun!
It's an order!

691
01:20:03,623 --> 01:20:06,173
Do it, Hans?

692
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:08,728
Hans, idiot!
Lower the weapon, I order you!

693
01:20:10,288 --> 01:20:13,308
- Lower the weapon or I swear I cut you!
- Hans, listen to her!

694
01:20:16,807 --> 01:20:20,327
I'm not scared of you, slut!
Neither of you!

695
01:20:33,248 --> 01:20:35,368
Hans, don't!

696
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:38,628
Don't die.

697
01:20:46,487 --> 01:20:48,507
Kill her!

698
01:20:53,087 --> 01:20:55,207
Karl, here!

699
01:21:20,047 --> 01:21:22,967
- We will go by a secondary way.
- Wait at the main entrance.

700
01:23:50,246 --> 01:23:52,566
Fucking monsters.

701
01:23:58,326 --> 01:24:00,746
I can feel you.

702
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:08,766
Show yourself I said!

703
01:24:10,206 --> 01:24:12,626
Little bitch...

704
01:24:23,526 --> 01:24:25,846
Whore, where are you?

705
01:24:34,166 --> 01:24:36,886
Bitch, I'm gonna chop you.

706
01:24:51,446 --> 01:24:53,511
Do you want me to disembowel you?!

707
01:24:53,546 --> 01:24:55,576
Do you want me to kill you?!

708
01:24:55,611 --> 01:24:56,450
Come here!

709
01:24:56,485 --> 01:24:59,705
Why do you want me to hurt you?
Because you are the wife of our commander,

710
01:25:00,406 --> 01:25:03,026
And now you decide, don't you?

711
01:25:03,726 --> 01:25:06,746
So tell me what I do!

712
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:14,185
You redneck whore face!

713
01:25:19,525 --> 01:25:21,945
I am more important than you!

714
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:23,131
Me!

715
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:25,586
Right now I will count on you.

716
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:27,645
Bitch!

717
01:25:47,125 --> 01:25:49,745
Who chose you?

718
01:25:55,966 --> 01:25:58,486
Here I command!

719
01:25:59,445 --> 01:26:01,565
Only me!

720
01:26:06,925 --> 01:26:09,651
You must obey me!

721
01:26:09,686 --> 01:26:13,406
Come back here!
I order you!

722
01:26:13,845 --> 01:26:15,730
Don't you hear what I say?!

723
01:26:15,765 --> 01:26:18,785
The old man invented everything...
Why does he decide who commands?!

724
01:26:19,805 --> 01:26:22,725
It's clear who commands!
I command!

725
01:26:23,125 --> 01:26:25,420
I command here!

726
01:26:25,455 --> 01:26:26,690
Do you get it?!

727
01:26:26,725 --> 01:26:30,045
Who did he appoint him?
why did he choose him?!

728
01:26:30,805 --> 01:26:33,425
I am the commander, I command!

729
01:26:34,445 --> 01:26:36,865
So you should show respect!

730
01:26:37,245 --> 01:26:39,665
Look at me when I speak, slut!

731
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:42,345
Look at me!

732
01:26:42,805 --> 01:26:45,225
Fucking whore!

733
01:29:30,444 --> 01:29:33,234
Drop that, do you hear me?

734
01:29:33,269 --> 01:29:36,024
Drop it, I said!

735
01:30:02,164 --> 01:30:04,184
This is what you wanted...

736
01:30:33,203 --> 01:30:35,823
I... Wanted your help...

737
01:30:36,923 --> 01:30:39,543
- Eve, you come with me.
- No.

738
01:30:39,563 --> 01:30:42,283
I can not abandon the children.

739
01:30:42,318 --> 01:30:43,114
Escape.

740
01:30:43,163 --> 01:30:45,794
They are seeking you.
I'll say that I have not seen you.

741
01:30:45,829 --> 01:30:47,363
Go!
Hurry!

742
01:32:14,162 --> 01:32:16,992
Claudia, she's here!

743
01:32:56,483 --> 01:32:58,668
Claudia!

744
01:32:58,703 --> 01:33:00,853
The two together!

745
01:33:13,322 --> 01:33:15,742
Is this enough!

746
01:33:16,403 --> 01:33:19,523
Go away

747
01:35:00,082 --> 01:35:03,902
Is it the end?

748
01:35:05,962 --> 01:35:08,407
Is it because it's the end?

749
01:35:08,442 --> 01:35:11,362
- Begone!
- Do not do that!

750
01:35:11,401 --> 01:35:14,201
- Move away!
- Don't!

751
01:35:14,236 --> 01:35:16,829
Eve, move away!

752
01:35:16,864 --> 01:35:19,422
- Don't!
- Idiot!

753
01:35:21,642 --> 01:35:22,562
Bitch, on your knees!

754
01:35:34,481 --> 01:35:35,501
- Gilberte don't do that!
- You are dead!

755
01:37:17,401 --> 01:37:17,521
- We'll leave.
- No.

756
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,080
Here are my children.

757
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:10,320
The disturbances related
to the second round of presidential

758
01:38:10,355 --> 01:38:14,081
frustate the access to the power
of the candidate of the extreme right.

759
01:38:15,961 --> 01:38:20,681
Yesterday afternoon, after announcement of the results,
that was visible on his face.

760
01:38:20,716 --> 01:38:23,801
The police is still in a state of
maximum alert..

761
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:53,810
Sorry,
I do not speak German.

762
01:39:54,611 --> 01:40:00,611
