1
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,854
How am I going to prepare you?

2
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,653
We'll put you in a black iron pot...

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,690
Then we'll melt a bit of bacon fat...

4
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,591
That will be absolutely delicious.

5
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:36,262
Then, once you're all plucked,
you'll be gutted...

6
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:38,934
Maybe we'll stuff you a bit...

7
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:42,506
We'll season you with some delicious spices.

8
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:45,667
We'll add some star-anise, allspice...

9
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,906
... peppercorns,
juniper berries, and everything.

10
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,230
We'll grind it all up with mortar and pestle

11
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,956
and then we'll rub it into your skin.

12
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,786
It's going to be just lovely, yes...

13
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,494
It'll be great fun.

14
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:04,859
Then the oven will get nice and warm,
oooh...

15
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,670
It will be nice and cozy,
you'll see, my little darling.

16
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,898
So, we should get back to work,
shouldn't we?

17
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,569
I'll eat some of you, too,
don't worry.

18
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,649
With the discovery of cooking,
Stone Age people developed

19
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,733
into Homo sapiens.

20
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,766
Cooking is the mother of philosophy,
chemistry, and physics.

21
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:29,309
Cooking is poetry,
transformation, creation...

22
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:36,762
Cooking is the oldest art form,
older, even, than cave painting.

23
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,133
My mother didn't want me to become a chef.

24
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:46,666
'Oh well, at least
you'll always have enough to eat.'

25
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:50,056
That was the best
she had to say on the subject.

26
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,820
Indeed, I always had more than enough to eat.

27
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,645
I was never a glutton.
Pleasure isn't born of excess.

28
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,055
But I always wanted a nice belly.

29
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,853
My mother had a beautiful belly
when she was carrying my sister,

30
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,893
and I swore to myself that when I grew up,

31
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,789
I'd have a big, warm, soft, firm belly
just like hers.

32
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:28,033
Most childhood dreams fade with age,
and we laugh them off as adults.

33
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,645
I, on the other hand, worked
persistently to achieve my dream,

34
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:36,349
and every centimeter of my belly
filled me with pride.

35
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,879
When I wasn't cooking
or shopping for ingredients,

36
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,422
which took up the greater part of my time,

37
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:46,982
I would observe women.
I especially loved watching waitresses.

38
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,409
Watch out, they'll be leaving soon.

39
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,939
What do you mean?
- They'll run off without paying.

40
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,990
We don't treat our guests like cheats.

41
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,468
Ready!

42
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:09,102
Three... four!
And... one, two, three, four!

43
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,036
Five, six, seven!
And back you go!

44
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,108
Two, three, four!
And stomp!

45
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:19,416
And clap your hands!
One, two, three, four!

46
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,418
And inhale!
One, two, three, four!

47
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,056
And... four, five, six!

48
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,504
What are you, a shop detective?

49
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,447
I cook.

50
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,787
For fun or professionally?
- Both.

51
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,323
So you always cook,
even in your free time?

52
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,225
Yes.

53
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:03,735
If that's so, you hang out here
and stare at women an awful lot.

54
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,938
Or do you do that for inspiration?

55
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:19,075
What would I inspire you to cook?

56
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,048
Nothing at all.

57
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,648
Your wait... w..w..waitress outfit
is unimaginative

58
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,082
and you smell of stale coffee

59
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,021
and second-rate cake.

60
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,659
Thanks a lot.

61
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:02,479
Was she playing by the fountain?
- No harm done.

62
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,494
Oh my, that shouldn't happen.
I fell asleep.

63
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,148
Thank you.
I really must apologize.

64
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,756
I'm the one who must apologize.
- What for?

65
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,664
For yesterday.
- I was a bit snippy myself yesterday.

66
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,216
Really...cute, your little girl.

67
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,153
Yes...
She'll be five tomorrow.

68
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,089
Tomorrow?
- Yes.

69
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,163
Well, then...

70
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,767
There you go.

71
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,370
Well, goodbye, then.

72
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,572
And thank you!

73
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,709
Can I take over table two?
- No.

74
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,282
Please?

75
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,418
Avery pleasant day to you.

76
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,392
Is everything all right like that?

77
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,687
My, that's lovely.
What is it?

78
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,138
A b...b...birthday present.

79
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:36,368
F... for Leonie.
- You ought to give it to her yourself.

80
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,393
Look, someone has a birthday present for you.

81
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,776
Hello!
- Look at that!

82
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,542
I don't even know your name.

83
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,788
Barbier, Gregor Barbier.

84
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,187
Gregor has a present for you, look!

85
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
A huge present!

86
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,136
Here!

87
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,236
A present!

88
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,238
Look at that!
- Present!

89
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,676
Oh, a cake!

90
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,482
Unfortunately,
Leonie isn't much of a chocolate fan.

91
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,549
Not at all, actually.

92
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,187
There.
- But only one, you hear?

93
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,089
You want more, do you?

94
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,595
Leonie, that's enough now.

95
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,404
You mustn't eat them all at once.
- There!

96
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,996
Leonie, stop it now.
Come, that's enough, Leonie!

97
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,407
I told you not to eat any more!

98
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,579
Leonie, stop it!

99
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:52,891
We're glad you were born, little dear
- Leonie! Enough!

100
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,011
We'd miss you so ifyou weren't here!

101
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,646
We've come because we want to say

102
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,436
All the best on your special day!

103
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,053
Leonie, look what you've done!

104
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:10,032
Leonie ate too many chocolates...
- Are there any...

105
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,438
... any more of those damn chocolates?

106
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:16,038
The chocolates are just for decoration.
The cake...

107
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:21,008
... is made with nuts.
- I don't give a damn what's in the cake!

108
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,353
Yes, come here.
Yes, of course!

109
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,968
Yes, Grandpa will take care of it.

110
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,225
There you go.
Mommy's coming, don't worry.

111
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,494
How could she let this happen?

112
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,370
My mommy!

113
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,102
It's pretty obvious, I'd say.

114
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,164
Chocolate doesn't agree with Leonie.

115
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,313
It never has.

116
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,036
Most certainly not in that quantity.

117
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,951
That's what I thought at first.

118
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,742
Honey, could you turn off the light?

119
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,692
I'm really tired.

120
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,706
You know,
I tried one of those chocolates.

121
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,343
And, was it good?

122
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,246
Good?

123
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,319
I think Leonie was in paradise.

124
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,216
And she simply didn't want to leave.

125
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,953
That's why she had such a fit.

126
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,330
Not 'cause the chocolates
made her sick or anything.

127
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:47,987
I would've given anything for another one, too.

128
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,042
Xaver?.

129
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,116
Xaver...

130
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:14,216
You can't imagine
what that chocolate did to me.

131
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,728
It was overwhelming.

132
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,031
That fat chef is a real genius.

133
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,633
I even daydreamed about it.

134
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:34,146
I dreamed of letting one of those
chocolates melt in my mouth

135
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,272
and sleeping with you at the same time.

136
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,712
That would be a double orgasm.

137
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,435
I'm going to get us some.

138
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Ouch!

139
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,416
Good evening...

140
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,516
... Ms. Drebb.

141
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,643
May I ask what you're doing in my herb garden?

142
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,434
Excuse me.

143
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,738
I... I didn't mean to...

144
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,831
It's 'cause of Leonie.

145
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,726
Is she ill?
Is that why you're here?

146
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,470
She drew this for you.

147
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,558
Thank you.

148
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,132
Did you hurt yourself?

149
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,168
Your chocolates have transformed Leonie.

150
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,207
It was a truly wonderful experience

151
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,387
and she'll always be grateful to you for it.

152
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:53,648
Her greatest wish is to have
another one of those chocolates.

153
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,692
Why not?

154
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,894
Because I can't.
They were one-of-a-kind.

155
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,194
I couldn't reproduce them.

156
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:20,262
I really have to get back to work.
- Of course. Excuse me.

157
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,653
What are you making?
- I'm...

158
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,490
... experimenting!

159
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:46,304
I don't mean to be pushy,
but could I try a tiny bite of that?

160
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,959
Then I'll leave, I promise.
- It's... not finished yet!

161
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,121
I don't mind.

162
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,669
What did you make?

163
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,108
That's totally irrelevant.

164
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:05,250
You eat, and I'll go to the wine cellar.
When I get back, I want you to...

165
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,350
... be gone.

166
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,254
It's a deal.

167
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,045
Ladies and gentlemen,
dancing keeps you young.

168
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,435
Now we're going to learn something
called Salsa.

169
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:14,414
Salsa means 'spicy-hot.'
That suits our mood today perfectly.

170
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
First, let the air out.

171
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:21,042
That's it. Wait, now I let the air out
on the wrong side.

172
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,162
Okay, I start with my left foot forward,

173
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,064
you with your right foot in back.

174
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,164
Ready?
Three...

175
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,566
... four and... forward!

176
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,602
Very good!

177
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:37,069
Yes, we all know this one...
'The Harlem Shuffle'!

178
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:41,059
Everyone grab a partner.
It doesn't have to be your own.

179
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,302
How was the espresso?

180
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,170
Okay, under the circumstances.

181
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,341
Then try this one.

182
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,352
How did you manage that?
- Magic.

183
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,189
I decalcified the machine.

184
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:34,288
Sorry for barging in on you yesterday
and wolfing down all your food.

185
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,779
I'm terribly embarrassed about it.

186
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,101
Don't you know what you want to cook?

187
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:50,405
If you want my opinion,
I wouldn't change a thing.

188
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,016
It was divine.

189
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,256
Will you forgive me?

190
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,259
And do me a favor?.

191
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:06,165
Could you keep it to yourself
that I came by last night?

192
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,529
Could that be our little secret?

193
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,501
Promise?
- Yes, sure.

194
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,304
Thank you.

195
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,973
Waitress?
The check, please!

196
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,480
I forgot to ask
what I had last night at your place.

197
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,158
You were eating bull's testicles.

198
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:33,217
You're not serious, are you?
- From half a herd, to be exact.

199
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,193
Waitress!

200
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,951
You're hungry, huh?
- Grandma's cooking is best, isn't it?

201
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,007
Now it's your turn.
You haven't eaten a thing.

202
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,236
You don't have any yet.
There.

203
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,445
You don't like it?

204
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:07,392
No, no, it's very good.
I just have an upset stomach.

205
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,492
She hasn't eaten in days.

206
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,263
Well, I think it tastes great.

207
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,598
Me, too.
- Thank you.

208
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,137
You do, too, Leonie, don't you?

209
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,937
Right, Sweetie?

210
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,702
Come, eat a little something,
at least.

211
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,580
I am eating.

212
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,989
Don't pressure her if she doesn't want to.

213
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:39,439
You don't have to if you don't want to.
- She'll have her reasons. Let her be.

214
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,552
Is there something wrong with the scallops?

215
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,784
Shall I get you something else?

216
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:08,351
Do you have anything...

217
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:13,381
... like grasshoppers,
or earthworms maybe?

218
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,623
Or bull's testicles?

219
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,525
Yes, that's right, pull him out.
- Huh?

220
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,273
Can you...?

221
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,475
I'll hold it for you.

222
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,046
Oh, man!

223
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,586
Got it?
- Hello.

224
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,858
What are you doing?

225
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,732
Leonie's leftovers.
Can't throw them out.

226
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:57,563
But you should.
- That's hard for the war generation.

227
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,865
Ah, the war generation.
- Well, my mother, actually.

228
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,804
And she brought me up that way.

229
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,846
Look, there's the frog, here.
- Just a little...

230
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,976
But it doesn't really matter.

231
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,481
It's nice to see you again.

232
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,284
Say hello.
- Hello, Gregor.

233
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,676
Leonie's always happy when she's by the water.

234
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,996
How's your restaurant doing?

235
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,806
What would you say if I were to come
as a normal, paying guest?

236
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,372
Why not?

237
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,505
No free tables till February.

238
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,875
Next February?
I see.

239
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,446
There are only three tables.

240
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:48,268
What if I were to return the favor
and invite you over to our place

241
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:51,014
and cook for you?
Say, next Tuesday?

242
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,260
You could meet my husband.
He's very nice, don't worry.

243
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,295
Daddy's pretty nice, isn't he?
- Yes.

244
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:58,997
Yes?
- Yes.

245
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:01,930
Yes!
- Yes, but I'm afraid...

246
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:06,538
What a pity.
Leonie would love it if you came over.

247
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,374
Wouldn't you, Leonie?
If he came to dinner?

248
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,474
Yes.
- Yes.

249
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,669
I have an idea.
I'll cook...

250
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,549
... either way,
whether you come or not.

251
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:21,009
Come if you feel like it.
It's totally up to you.

252
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,253
Okay?

253
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,122
Okay.

254
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,811
Gregor!

255
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,015
How nice that you came.

256
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,219
Actually,
I was expecting you last week.

257
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,828
Mommy, come.

258
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,198
Mommy, come!

259
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,401
Excuse me.

260
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:19,056
Sorry that you had to cook, after all.
- I enjoy cooking.

261
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,313
I apologize.

262
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,422
Mmm.
- ls it yummy?

263
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,522
Yes.

264
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,492
She really likes it.

265
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Eden.

266
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,971
What did she say?
- Eden.

267
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,304
Eden.
- Eden? As in paradise?

268
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,978
Yes.
She means me.

269
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,706
That's my name.
Eden, like the garden.

270
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,494
Thank you.

271
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,594
On here.
- There you go.

272
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,663
There?
- Some there, too.

273
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,360
There, too.
- Some more?

274
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:33,207
Chocolate-Cola sauce...

275
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,323
That's my childhood fantasy.

276
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,729
It tastes fantastic!

277
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,068
There.
Yummy.

278
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,045
Eat!

279
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,284
I have to go now.

280
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,272
But you're making pancakes.

281
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:39,511
Shouldn't you be trying new recipes?
If Leonie's bothering you, we'll leave.

282
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,779
No, no...

283
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,539
I just thought we'd pop in and say hi.

284
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:47,218
And now you're cooking for us and all.
I feel bad.

285
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,320
Oh...
- lf she's making too much mess,

286
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,022
just say so.

287
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,122
Rules are important.

288
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:00,129
Do you want to make some dough, too?
- Yes.

289
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,034
Leonie, what are you doing?

290
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:44,136
Mommy!
- I'm over here!

291
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:47,179
There's nothing she might break in there?

292
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:03,254
My absolute favorite.
Chocolate-Cola sauce.

293
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:06,517
Gregor loves Chocolate-Cola sauce,
you know.

294
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,995
A little on here... There you go.
On the salad, too.

295
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,932
Incredible, she finished her plate again.

296
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,060
D... do you mind?

297
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,984
Does your husband know you're here?

298
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:00,062
No.

299
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:08,502
Tuesday is his night out with the boys,
which is supposedly

300
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,640
oh-so-important for his social standing.

301
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:22,754
Actually, he's at a strip joint with
his buddies, playing the big spender.

302
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,854
That's his little secret.

303
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,323
And I'm yours?

304
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:55,350
Not exactly the youngest, your Cognac.

305
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,400
I can't drink any more.
Otherwise I'll get too drunk.

306
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,060
But you have to finish your glass.

307
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:24,148
The rest is for you.
I really can't manage any more.

308
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,988
Excuse me.

309
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,928
You're drunk, too.

310
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,028
But only a tiny bit.

311
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,968
Do you drink a lot when you're cooking?

312
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,068
No.

313
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,998
I hardly ever drink alcohol, actually.

314
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,474
I've got to go now.

315
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,877
Me, too.

316
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,289
I really enjoy being here.

317
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,172
Bye.

318
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,876
Is there some reason to celebrate?

319
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:05,347
What's the matter?

320
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,889
Has something happened?

321
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,192
You're so radiant.

322
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,861
Did you win the lottery?
Or a new lover?

323
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,067
Yes. And what a lover!

324
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,976
I could almost go for another round...
of Drebbling.

325
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,634
Can you show me how that works again?

326
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,219
Hello, everyone!

327
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,120
My name's Xaver Drebb.

328
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,856
Today you're going to learn a new swim stroke:

329
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:50,716
the revolutionary Drebble, named for
its inventor, whom you see here.

330
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,226
Hello.

331
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,566
No exchange possible.
- No really, please keep it.

332
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,981
Just consider it a small token of thanks.

333
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,478
I cook without you, too.
Please.

334
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:51,082
How much does one of your dinners cost?

335
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,555
It's not exactly cheap.

336
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,058
How much?

337
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,594
300 euros.

338
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:03,173
Why don't you cook something
normal people can afford?

339
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,167
You could really do some good that way.

340
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,337
Trust me, I know.

341
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,212
There's a dog out there.

342
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,492
There's a dog in your garden.
Hey!

343
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,751
Come here.

344
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,787
Is he yours?

345
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,922
Hi, there!
Hi, doggie.

346
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,418
Go on, get out!
- Oh, don't!

347
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,766
Why?
- A dog doesn't belong in the kitchen.

348
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,216
I'm overwhelmed.

349
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,112
Tell me, what's your secret?

350
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,930
I think of you.

351
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,915
Well...

352
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,719
The fish...

353
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,878
... with the hint of coffee?

354
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,323
And, um...

355
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,725
... in combination with these flowers...

356
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,795
Fabulous.
Absolutely delicious.

357
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:45,169
What gave you a crazy idea like that?
- The recipe was in a magazine.

358
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,269
Want some more?

359
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,139
Have a little more.

360
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,688
Hey, Xaver.
We're ready when you are.

361
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,540
Where are you?

362
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,876
What?

363
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,809
And you stand up your friends for that?

364
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,417
Yeah, see you.
Bye.

365
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,224
He hasn't had his dessert yet.

366
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:52,266
You're the dessert, aren't you?
- Yes... and no.

367
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,728
Eden...
Frank and Martin are waiting for me.

368
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,987
I really have to leave.
- Unwrap your present.

369
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:02,144
Come on!

370
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,312
You're completely cra...

371
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,223
It's all yours.

372
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,827
Was that in the magazine, too?

373
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,474
Here you go, guys...
Your beer.

374
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:36,545
Enjoy.

375
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:45,890
I think they're having a rough patch.
I've heard it around.

376
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,792
He told me their marriage is better than ever.

377
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:52,112
I heard his wife whets her appetite elsewhere.

378
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,530
Eden?

379
00:43:55,833 --> 00:44:00,313
'On our most recent visit,
the cooking eroticist, Gregor Barbier,

380
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:04,408
performed his culinary love-making
seven times in a row...

381
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:07,444
Cordelia, a bit higher with the hips!
Just a bit!

382
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:10,274
... and managed to peak seven times.

383
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:14,051
We were treated to a sensual feast
and an orgy of aromas,

384
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:18,588
and fell head over heels
for Barbier's Cu... Cucina Erotica.'

385
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:21,258
Mrs. Brunnmeier!
Remember: right-left!

386
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,193
So, what are you trying to say?

387
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,293
Nothing.

388
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:34,945
Maybe I should pay
this cooking eroticist a visit, eh?

389
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:38,852
I already tried.
He's all booked up till next February.

390
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:43,945
I see.

391
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:45,849
Well, I'll be damned.

392
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,747
And Eden eats there every week, huh?

393
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:17,481
May I ask what brings you
to Bad Herrenalb, Mr. Stewer?.

394
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:20,351
I don't think that's any of your business.

395
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:25,141
Oh, is that what you think?
Well, I think you'd better get out, now!

396
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:40,513
Resisting a police officer.
This is getting better by the minute!

397
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,683
Bravo!

398
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:49,252
If you can repeat this evening's performance,

399
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,657
I'll make you the greatest chef on the planet!

400
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:00,001
And now, champagne for everyone!

401
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,994
And so I started waiting tables.

402
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:01,895
In a family business everyone helps out.

403
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:06,036
And before you know it,
you're a waitress.

404
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,271
My mother was a waitress, too.

405
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,041
Excuse me.

406
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,807
Now I owe you one.

407
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,977
Did you know that...
Leonie would be disabled?

408
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:37,301
On the ultrasound they discovered
a white spot in her heart area.

409
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,736
Her heart valves didn't shut properly

410
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:42,566
because part of the septum was missing.

411
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,936
The doctors didn't think she could survive.

412
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:54,067
Xaver and his parents
were totally against me having her.

413
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:59,251
There was a point when I thought
it'd be better for her not to be born.

414
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,819
Then she started to hit and kick...

415
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,990
... and I knew she wanted to live.

416
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:14,634
And after she was born,
they managed to fix her heart defect.

417
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:24,506
You made the right decision.

418
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,215
No, it was Leonie's decision.

419
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,087
It was quite simple.

420
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:34,989
For me, anyway.

421
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:39,961
And your husband?

422
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,193
It's still difficult for him.

423
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:50,564
And you didn't want
any more children after that?

424
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,640
No, I really do, actually.

425
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:56,767
But somehow I can't seem to get pregnant again.

426
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,253
I really love watching you clean chanterelles.

427
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,424
You do it so elegantly.

428
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,900
They smell of forest.
- You have to fry them, right?

429
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,100
No, you can also eat them raw.

430
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,036
And?
- Not very good.

431
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:28,522
No, actually,
they're toxic when they're raw.

432
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:10,485
That was a great idea,
the diving goggles.

433
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,454
Ludwig came up with it.

434
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,748
Has Ludwig always been deaf-mute?

435
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:20,781
Ludwig used to be the headwaiter for Duchènes.

436
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:26,727
Duchènes is the world's greatest chef.

437
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:33,376
But he contracted a virus and lost his hearing,

438
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,309
then his voice,
and consequently his job.

439
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,484
Did you try the minted mascarpone crème?

440
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,590
It made quite an impression.

441
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,523
My husband couldn't get over the aroma.

442
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,936
Did you soak the base with a bit of Cognac?

443
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:55,496
The base was perfect, yes.

444
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:02,799
Clap your hands!
And... one, two, three, four!

445
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:05,231
Five, six, seven, eight!

446
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:17,218
Step it up a bit, you guys!

447
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:23,187
And... stamp your feet!
Clap your hands!

448
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,421
And... one lady down!

449
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:27,795
On to the next lovely lady!

450
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:30,267
One, two, three!
And change your partners!

451
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,502
And four, five, six!
From the beginning!

452
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,602
And one, two, three, four...

453
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:39,095
How come you don't have a wife or a girlfriend?

454
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:44,305
You could win any woman's heart,
and not only with your divine cooking.

455
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:48,089
It just never happened, somehow.

456
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:53,379
You mean...
you've never been with a woman?

457
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:58,526
Would you like to be?

458
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,496
Present company excluded,
of course.

459
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:06,803
I can't. Doctor's orders.
I'm simply too fat. And my heart...

460
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:08,371
You know...

461
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,372
And one, two, three,
four, five, six!

462
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:14,401
And back again!
Back, two three four!

463
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:18,343
And stomp! And clap!
And move two ladies down!

464
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:20,848
Two ladies down!

465
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,423
Thank you, everybody!

466
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:39,263
By the way,
I can't come next Tuesday.

467
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:43,906
My husband's taking Leonie and me
to Paris for a long weekend.

468
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,144
To a luxury hotel.

469
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:51,111
You must tell me the best place to eat.

470
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,281
Duchènes, of course.

471
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,972
Ludwig will get you a table...
- Okay.

472
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:02,185
Then you can tell me who's
the better cook, Duchènes or me.

473
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,359
Okay, I'll do that.

474
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:09,427
I'm so happy, and all thanks to you.

475
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:13,659
Sorry?
- Your food and your company

476
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:16,870
have turned me into a new person.

477
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:22,345
And Leonie, too. She's been sleeping
through the night these past weeks.

478
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:25,048
You can't imagine what that means to us.

479
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:27,384
I think you've transformed Xaver,
as well.

480
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:31,054
He's more and more
like the man I fell in love with.

481
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:35,283
Oh, come on,
now surely you're exaggerating.

482
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:40,209
No, since I met you,
my life is a thousand times better.

483
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:49,185
And you aren't even happy about it.
- No, I am.

484
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:54,124
Would you prefer that I didn't visit anymore?

485
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,745
No, I wouldn't.

486
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,747
Okay.

487
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,563
Bonjour.

488
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,905
May I come in?

489
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:39,142
He looked after her beautifully
and she really opened up.

490
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:44,002
In the end the ice really broke.
We stayed at Disneyland an extra day

491
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:48,453
because Leonie enjoyed it so much.
Rather, all three of us did.

492
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:52,872
Maybe this was the breakthrough.
- Did you go to Duchènes?

493
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:54,889
We didn't get around to it.

494
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:59,581
Xaver insisted I buy expensive clothes
and go to a star hairstylist.

495
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:11,260
Don't you like the new hairstyle?
You haven't said a word.

496
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:13,507
Yes, it's...

497
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,111
... very nice.

498
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,281
So is the dress.

499
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:23,551
Thank you.

500
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,023
How was your week?

501
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,659
Great.

502
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,989
I really missed your food.

503
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:59,575
Have you noticed any difference
in the quality of my food?

504
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,990
No.

505
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:06,843
But I wasn't really paying attention to that.

506
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:12,537
I'd come here even if you just
served me a liverwurst sandwich.

507
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,437
You've become a friend.

508
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:19,073
A true friend.

509
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,919
Your fattest friend, huh?

510
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:38,592
Don't say that.

511
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,028
Everything's fine.

512
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:44,801
We're friends.
We feel deep affection for each other...

513
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:46,901
Yes.

514
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:49,937
My family is doing well.

515
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:01,610
And Xaver is all right?
- Yes.

516
01:02:02,618 --> 01:02:05,558
Leonie's getting along well with him?
- Yes.

517
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:09,223
Now, all of a sudden, huh?

518
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:18,131
You sound kind of aggressive.
- Oh, do l?

519
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:26,164
Some dessert?
- Sounds lovely.

520
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,730
Oh, right, dessert...
I haven't got any left.

521
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:46,122
Maybe I have a bit of cheese somewhere.

522
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:50,197
Yes.

523
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,727
I think I've run out of that, as well.

524
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:14,121
I'm sorry.

525
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:29,503
Bye.
- Bye.

526
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:57,324
Look at that fat guy!

527
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:59,305
Mmm, this liverwurst could make you a fortune.

528
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:14,722
You loved your mother a lot.

529
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:20,667
What about your father?

530
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,871
I never knew my father.

531
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:27,621
When I was six I got a stepfather.

532
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:31,442
And you didn't like him, huh?

533
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:40,609
Is it really true that you served
his dog as Sunday roast?

534
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:49,196
I bet it tasted good.

535
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,300
He even gnawed the meat off.

536
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:56,937
Down to the bone.

537
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:00,799
What had he done to you?

538
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:07,781
Nothing.

539
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:48,188
Do you want dessert today?

540
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:51,992
If you have some.

541
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:27,287
I'd like... the one in the middle.

542
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:30,297
Well, a piece of it.

543
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:54,744
Mrs. Weltermann was just at the café.

544
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:58,231
She cancelled her granddaughter's wedding.

545
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,328
Aha.

546
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:04,566
Why?
- She said you would know why.

547
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,202
I have no idea, Dad.

548
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:15,841
Where does she live?
- At number two Wildsprung.

549
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:18,178
Behind the fat chef's place.

550
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:20,891
She also mentioned an herb garden

551
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:24,987
that had been trampled, and morals,
decency, and disgusting behavior.

552
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:29,707
You owe me an explanation.
- It's a misunderstanding. Be right back.

553
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:45,205
They're fast here.

554
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:48,841
Can I give you a ride somewhere?

555
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:57,278
You had one of my guests arrested
two weeks ago, didn't you?

556
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:02,507
You've been meeting with my wife
for months, haven't you?

557
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:12,065
It's the next right.

558
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:14,067
But you know the way.

559
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:34,403
I have nothing against you personally,
really.

560
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:37,960
But your meetings with my wife
are putting me in a tight spot,

561
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:40,580
if you know what I mean.
- Not really.

562
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:44,377
Just stay away from my wife, okay?

563
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:51,735
I'm honored that you're jealous,
but it's totally un... un...

564
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:56,011
And your wife's old enough
to make her own decisions.

565
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:58,773
And besides, you can...

566
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:02,182
o... o... only benefit from it, too.

567
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:06,222
If you keep seeing Eden,

568
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,982
you'll suffer the consequences,
got me?

569
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:20,767
No need to threaten me, Mr. Drebb.
I weigh 137 kilos.

570
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:24,843
I love to cook and to eat,
and I desire nothing else.

571
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:28,143
You should thank me.
- Listen, you asexual pig!

572
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:33,143
That was no threat! I'm not promising
you trouble, I'm guaranteeing it!

573
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:40,420
Eden!

574
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:44,843
Shhh, she's sleeping.
- ls something the matter?

575
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:48,224
Nothing serious.
She just felt a bit dizzy.

576
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:51,300
Why the strange smile on your face,
then?

577
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,369
She's pregnant, Xaver, finally!

578
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,037
After all these years!

579
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:07,625
The doctor said for her to avoid
anything upsetting or stressful.

580
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:11,940
But she doesn't have to stay in bed.
She can work and all.

581
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:15,319
Epi-leppy, but quite happy.

582
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:26,437
Though Xaver tried his very best
No egg appeared in Eden's nest

583
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:29,468
So she went to the chef for some lovin'

584
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:32,746
Now she's got a bun in the oven!

585
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:44,153
Eden didn't want another mongo brat
So another guy came up to bat!

586
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:48,173
He may be as fat as a pig
But soon she'll be just as big!

587
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:56,645
What's with you?
Did someone die or something?

588
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:59,234
Hi, Xaver.

589
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:01,334
Just joking around.

590
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:10,069
You two are coming outside!

591
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:44,744
Not my Corvette!

592
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,516
Not my Corvette!

593
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:49,318
I'll kill you!

594
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,418
Not my Corvette!

595
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,921
Hey!
You son of a bitch!

596
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:45,441
If you'd listened to your mom
and married Gisela,

597
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,510
this wouldn't have...
- Pull over! Let me out!

598
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:51,340
Are you crazy!?
- Stop the car, damn it!

599
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:52,848
Okay!
- Now!

600
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:55,075
Have you gone crazy, or what?

601
01:17:02,884 --> 01:17:04,884
Gregor?.

602
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:10,156
Barbier?

603
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:22,135
Barbier, are you in there?

604
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:27,872
Barbier, I need to talk to you.

605
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:31,077
Please come out.

606
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:40,251
Gregor, I know you're in there.

607
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:43,957
Gregor...

608
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:47,352
I... I'm not a big star like you are.

609
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:50,022
I.. I can't even cook at all.

610
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:54,267
I was a failure as a lawyer...

611
01:17:56,004 --> 01:18:01,044
And now I teach dance classes and
swimming lessons for the local seniors.

612
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:08,474
But I have
the most beautiful wife in the world...

613
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,581
... and I have a little family.

614
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:15,455
And, Gregor...

615
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:19,387
Eden is expecting a baby.

616
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:23,559
Eden is finally pregnant again.

617
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,928
And you and your wonderful food...

618
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:31,204
... had a lot to do with that.

619
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,683
And I want to thank you for that.

620
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:38,478
But...

621
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,680
But Eden is my wife.

622
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:44,219
And if you love my wife,
you should leave town.

623
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,319
You have to go.

624
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:49,385
I don't want to lose my family!

625
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:52,992
And that's why you have to leave,
Gregor!

626
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:56,028
Please find it in your heart to do that!

627
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:06,396
Otherwise... otherwise everything
is just going to go to pieces here.

628
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:12,672
Eden...
that you're pregnant

629
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:16,018
is the most wonderful news I've ever heard.

630
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:21,544
There'll be four of us soon...

631
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:26,519
Let's go on a trip.

632
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:29,622
On a cruise.

633
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:35,228
A nice ocean cruise.
We've always wanted to do that.

634
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:40,090
You smell of wine.

635
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:55,183
If I understand correctly,
your wine cellar's like your bank.

636
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:58,253
You bought the wines at good prices years ago,

637
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:01,223
and the increase in value is your profit.

638
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:05,286
You make no money with the food.

639
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:09,131
I'm afraid if your bank's been destroyed,

640
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:11,461
we can't put any money into it.

641
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:17,260
And you're currently unable to meet
the payments on the present loan.

642
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:21,337
Right.
- You realize what that means?

643
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:41,523
I have something really special
to tell you today.

644
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:45,189
That's why I brought some champagne along.

645
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:48,669
I've finally gotten pregnant again.

646
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:55,248
I'm so happy that it finally worked out,
and I have you to thank for that.

647
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:58,557
We all have you to thank for that.

648
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,591
May l...

649
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:14,527
May l...

650
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:18,731
Yes?

651
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:25,663
... make you a little strawberry carpaccio?

652
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:28,667
All you ever think about is food, huh?

653
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:33,008
No working in the kitchen now,
please.

654
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:41,409
You have something
to say to me, too, don't you?

655
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:43,523
Say it.

656
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:56,232
Would you like another glass?

657
01:22:57,138 --> 01:22:59,308
I would like to hold your hand.

658
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:36,542
I'll... I'll be right back.

659
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,049
My dear Gregor...

660
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:18,139
I bet you're in the kitchen right now,
working your magic.

661
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:23,609
Forgive me for disappearing like that,
but then, you did it first, didn't you?

662
01:24:23,858 --> 01:24:29,038
I didn't get a chance to tell you about
the cruise Xaver surprised me with.

663
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:31,130
I'll be back in two weeks.

664
01:24:31,433 --> 01:24:35,103
Please promise me things will be
the way they were before.

665
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:37,203
Would you do that?

666
01:24:38,706 --> 01:24:42,696
A big hug from me,
and I look forward to seeing you again.

667
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,615
What's that?

668
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:50,275
It's a carcasse, a duck juicer.

669
01:24:50,785 --> 01:24:54,255
You put the whole duck in
and squeeze all the juice out.

670
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:56,124
It comes out here.

671
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:58,324
It makes a great sauce base...

672
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:03,885
So, if you could show me the wine cellar now...

673
01:25:03,965 --> 01:25:05,965
Of course.
This way.

674
01:25:28,656 --> 01:25:30,756
We're out of insect repellant.

675
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:33,445
It's better to buy it there, anyway.

676
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:36,995
Have you seen the eye masks?
- Leonie had them last.

677
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:40,563
Damn,
they're good to have on the plane.

678
01:25:40,735 --> 01:25:43,533
I think the drugstore is still open.

679
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:46,612
You don't have to go now, Honey.

680
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:56,249
Ludwig!

681
01:25:58,186 --> 01:26:00,186
What are you doing here?

682
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:03,232
Why aren't you at the restaurant?

683
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,232
Did you and Gregor have a fight?

684
01:26:14,402 --> 01:26:16,597
BARBlER ISN'T COOKING ANYMORE.

685
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:19,975
That can't be,
I was just there yesterday.

686
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:23,136
The restaurant is closed?

687
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:28,015
But that's impossible.
I was there just yesterday.

688
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,456
But you were all booked up till next year!

689
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:33,653
Is it because of me?

690
01:26:41,996 --> 01:26:44,089
But I didn't do anything.

691
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:47,099
But why?

692
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:50,603
Right.

693
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:53,942
Once we're back she'll soon forget Fatso.

694
01:26:54,075 --> 01:26:57,365
She'll be busy with the pregnancy and the baby.

695
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:02,217
But I'll make sure
they check for birth defects.

696
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:06,517
Right, not like the last time.
No, I'm going to insist on it.

697
01:27:20,602 --> 01:27:23,542
You didn't get that the last time,
did you?

698
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:36,160
You couldn't bear that
I was happy with him, could you?

699
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:38,784
You idiot.

700
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:57,868
You trashed his wine cellar.

701
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:06,981
I didn't trash his wine cellar,
but you had dinner there every week.

702
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:09,081
And...
- And what?

703
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:14,155
You hugged him.

704
01:28:14,255 --> 01:28:16,255
He's a friend.

705
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:18,391
That's why.

706
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:23,286
You thought we were having an affair,
so you wrecked his wine cellar.

707
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:26,599
We'll work everything out.

708
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:31,790
Everything's going to be fine, okay?

709
01:28:32,206 --> 01:28:34,936
You have to pay for his wine cellar.

710
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:38,203
Then everything will be okay.

711
01:28:40,615 --> 01:28:43,695
I don't have anything to do with it,
I swear.

712
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:47,615
But the whole town
knows about your eating orgies.

713
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:03,004
You have to pay for his wine cellar.

714
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:05,104
Why?
- Because I want you to.

715
01:29:05,206 --> 01:29:09,336
He didn't do anything to you, not one...
- Like hell, I will!

716
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:11,877
You come to your senses!

717
01:29:13,781 --> 01:29:17,281
You started the whole thing,
and now you'll end it!

718
01:29:29,764 --> 01:29:32,066
Excuse the disturbance,
but could l...

719
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:35,246
... have a quick word with your wife,
please?

720
01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:53,688
All you like is cooking and eating, huh?
And I should be thankful!

721
01:29:53,788 --> 01:29:56,728
This is all just a mis...
- Thanks, asshole!

722
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:06,501
Xaver, stop! Leave him alone! Stop it!
- Get inside! Get inside! Go!

723
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:09,502
Get inside!
- Stop it! Let go of me!

724
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:13,714
Let go of me! It's all my fault!
- Get inside, damn it!

725
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:17,435
Xaver, stop it!
What are you doing? Xaver!

726
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:20,546
Xaver!
Open the door!

727
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:37,556
I have always detested physical violence.

728
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:41,302
Even at school everyone
was amazed how fast I could run,

729
01:30:41,402 --> 01:30:43,071
despite my weight.

730
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:45,621
But it's nothing special, actually.

731
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:48,476
Over short distances,

732
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:51,977
even fattened pigs can run faster than humans.

733
01:31:14,602 --> 01:31:17,264
Come on!
Come out, you fat pig!

734
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:23,142
Come on, show yourself!

735
01:31:29,784 --> 01:31:31,784
Come out!

736
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:50,004
If you love Eden, come out,
or I'll bring her to her senses!

737
01:31:50,104 --> 01:31:52,504
Come out!
Come on, you fat pig!

738
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:06,614
Come out! I'll count to three!
One...

739
01:32:16,664 --> 01:32:18,664
Two...

740
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:21,934
I had always run away.

741
01:32:23,504 --> 01:32:25,504
All my life.

742
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,208
Three!

743
01:32:27,308 --> 01:32:29,548
But at that moment, I decided...

744
01:32:31,012 --> 01:32:33,672
... to stop running, once and for all.

745
01:33:13,654 --> 01:33:17,146
That's all I can say about Mr. Drebb's death.

746
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:40,474
No, the music stays on.

747
01:34:40,574 --> 01:34:43,042
Mom, the music sucks!

748
01:34:43,577 --> 01:34:45,379
The music sucks!

749
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:47,479
Yeah, real bad.

750
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:49,815
Change the station.

751
01:34:50,084 --> 01:34:52,575
No, I like it.
- Change the station.

752
01:34:53,788 --> 01:34:56,052
Change the station!

753
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:59,254
Change the station!
- Change the station!

754
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:05,900
This isn't your normal hamburger stand:

755
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,170
The owner wears coat and tails,

756
01:35:08,302 --> 01:35:12,239
the usual smell of cooking oil
is missing, and the clientele is...

757
01:35:12,339 --> 01:35:14,842
... well dressed.
- Quiet, I want to hear this.

758
01:35:14,942 --> 01:35:18,045
Well, that's the definition
of a one-star rating.

759
01:35:18,145 --> 01:35:20,481
The food is worth a detour.
- What's it like

760
01:35:20,581 --> 01:35:23,651
at a one-star take-away stand
by the highwayside?

761
01:35:23,751 --> 01:35:26,053
To be honest,
the line's pretty long,

762
01:35:26,153 --> 01:35:29,457
and the owner doesn't smile much...
- Will you be quiet?

763
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:32,026
I'll just get in line like a good customer

764
01:35:32,126 --> 01:35:35,529
and get back to you once I've tried
the world's best French fries.

765
01:35:35,629 --> 01:35:39,333
Great. That was Nicole Koester,
live from the first take-away stand

766
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:42,870
ever to be awarded a star rating.
- What are you doing, Paul?

767
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:44,970
I have to annoy Mommy.
- Why?

768
01:36:38,259 --> 01:36:40,528
Mom, Leonie won't let me have any.

769
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:44,394
You want some chicken
with Chocolate-Cola sauce, too?

770
01:36:45,566 --> 01:36:48,436
What's your name?
- Paul. And what's yours?

771
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:51,366
That's Gregor, the cook.

772
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:05,984
Good to see you again.

773
01:39:20,754 --> 01:39:23,204
