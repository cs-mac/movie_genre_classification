00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,610
I was just wondering.

He emails me sometimes.

Why didn't you tell me?

39
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,348
You never asked.

40

Of course. Takuro Yoshida is my idol.

She says that?

She says that.

Is she still busy?

She's a workaholic.
I hope she doesn't get sick.

but wants you to have it.

Yes.

89
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:13,153
She has no serious external injuries...

90
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,489
and they'll heal completely
in two weeks.

91

and is still unconscious.

she'll come around.

174
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:05,187
She came falling.

175
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,564
Out of thin air.

176
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,714
I'm sorry.

177
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:20,346
Who are you?

178
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:27,102
I'm Ryota and
this is my apartment.

179
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,812
Remember yesterday?

180
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,108
Yesterday...

181
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,112
Kazuo Fukamachi?!

182
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,156
You're...

183
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,325
Not.

184
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,245
Is this the Setagaya
Jr. High science lab?

185
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,039
Shotoku University.

186
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,584
Oh, no!

187
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:58,342
I couldn't just leave you there.

188
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,803
So I brought you here.

189
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,016
What's today's date?

190
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:10,562
Sunday, Feb. 17, 1974.

191
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,043
1974...

192
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,837
February 1974.

193
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:39,675
April 1972.

194
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:46,181
I'm 2 years too late.

195
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,357
Your bag!

196
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,740
Where's Setagaya Jr. High?

197
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,659
Uh, the station's that way.

198
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,843
I'm completely lost.
Come with me.

199
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,763
"Setagaya Junior High School"

200
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,101
Excuse me... I'm looking for someone.

201
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,146
This guy.

202
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,150
That's Kazuko Yoshiyama
next to him, isn't it?

203
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,110
That's right.

204
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,697
But I'm looking for the guy.

205
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,283
I've never seen him.

206
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:51,413
Stop loafing around and go home.

207
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,177
Fresh off the grill.

208
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,720
Thank you.

209
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,975
It really is February 1974.

210
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,021
What's your name?

211
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,898
Akari Yoshiyama.

212
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,567
Your home?

213
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:29,868
Go home when you finish eating.
Your parents must be worried.

214
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,871
You ran away, right?

215
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,879
I ...

216
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:51,181
came from 2010.

217
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:58,856
I came from the future
to meet someone.

218
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,607
You hit your head hard.

219
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:05,445
I'm serious. I appeared
out of nowhere, didn't I?

220
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,824
Yeah, but...

221
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,868
Okay, proof.

222
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,212
My wallet.

223
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:29,011
A 500-yen coin and...

224
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:36,977
What's this era?

225
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:43,442
This is technology of 2010.

226
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,986
A small radio?

227
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,071
A mobile.

228
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,324
Mobile?

229
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,286
It's mainly a phone.

230
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:58,707
No signals, of course.

231
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,543
It's also...

232
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:06,423
a camera. Cool, huh?

233
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:16,016
A multiple communication device.

234
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,728
I use this in my SF movie.

235
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:26,276
You can transmit and record
messages from anywhere.

236
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:30,364
My invention, right in my hands...

237
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,243
It hit the spot.

238
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:40,374
So you believe me?
You're an SF geek, right?

239
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,584
Geek?

240
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,794
You.

241
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,338
Ryota, let me stay with you.

242
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,840
"Ryota"? ... No way.

243
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:53,553
I'll clean, wash, and cook.

244
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,641
I won't get in the way, so please.

245
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,063
Wait.

246
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,357
I have to do this.

247
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,819
Give a message to Kazuo...

248
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:13,490
and go back to my mom.

249
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,078
If I find him ...

250
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,206
and give him the message.

251
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:28,130
she might wake up again.

252
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:32,175
So, please.

253
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,721
Help me find him.

254
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,453
I'm sorry.

255
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,467
Come in.

256
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,322
What are you doing?

257
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,576
See.

258
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,161
What's up?

259
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:26,706
You tell us.

260
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,042
- Hello. - Hello.

261
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,294
She's cute.

262
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,964
Your type, huh?

263
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,590
No...

264
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,427
I'm his cousin Akari.

265
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:44,766
Yeah... my cousin.
She's here visiting colleges.

266
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,270
Great! Do you have a boyfriend?

267
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,939
He's Kadoi. I'm Natsuko.

268
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,400
We're in Ryota's movie.

269
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:56,736
We're just across the hall.

270
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,827
Come if you want.

271
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,961
Natsuko...

272
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,050
I think...

273
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,142
Here.

274
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,312
Natsuko Ichise.

275
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,736
"The actress most likely
to hold a grudge"

276
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,280
That's her.

277
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:51,249
He should be in high school.

278
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:57,005
Which one though...?

279
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:04,179
Is there a famous director
called Ryota Mizorogi?

280
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:10,435
I don't know about movies.

281
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,944
His address?

282
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,321
I don't know.

283
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:28,411
Using a red towel as a scarf.

284
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,496
What's that?

285
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,165
A hit song, "Kanda River".

286
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,460
Let's walk from the bathhouse.

287
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,920
I want a bath.

288
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,755
There isn't one.

289
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,966
No bath?

290
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,802
Then let's go to the bathhouse.

291
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,430
No bathing for another 2 days.

292
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,975
You don't bathe everyday?

293
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,644
That's a waste.
Plus, it's winter.

294
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,604
The season matters?

295
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,440
Use the communal sink.

296
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,777
In the hallway?

297
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,158
Forget it.

298
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:31,016
Sleep under the kotatsu.
It's heated.

299
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,379
Sorry.

300
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:33,328
"Setagaya Junior High School"

301
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,006
We're clear.

302
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:50,136
Class 3C...

303
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,848
Here it is.

304
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:57,644
Kazuko Yoshiyama...

305
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,104
Here.

306
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,647
Your mom?

307
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,066
Yeah.

308
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:10,115
Where's Kazuo Fukamachi?

309
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,537
He's not here.

310
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,288
Let me see.

311
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,221
Nope.

312
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,141
But look.

313
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:41,855
They're both wearing 3C class badges.

314
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,774
Weird...

315
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,906
He's not a ghost, is he?

316
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,457
I have an idea.

317
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,378
Let's go ask my mom.

318
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,633
Here's her address.

319
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:15,346
Hello.

320
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,644
Is anyone there?

321
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,912
Uncle Goro?!

322
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,373
Uncle?

323
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,336
So you're Kazuko's cousin.

324
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,546
Yeah...

325
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,299
You're the big brother.

326
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,717
Yes...

327
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,387
You don't look alike.

328
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:00,767
You surprised me when
you called me "uncle."

329
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,810
Sorry.

330
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:09,192
Kazuko always talks about you
so I feel like I know you.

331
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,861
She talks about me?!

332
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:19,244
It seems like nobody's
home right now.

333
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,412
They moved to Yokohama.

334
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,082
When?

335
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:28,294
When she entered high school.
You didn't know?

336
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:32,674
We haven't been in touch.

337
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,801
Oh yeah...

338
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:43,601
Do you know him?

339
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:47,313
Never seen him but
he's wearing our uniform.

340
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,524
Oh...

341
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:54,279
What's Kazuko's school and address?

342
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:58,324
I have them at home.

343
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:01,703
I'll be off work tonight
so call me.

344
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:07,750
Asakura Liquor Shop.
Dial "D-R-I-N-K-U-P."

345
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,170
See ya.

346
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:16,092
"Drink up"?

347
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,806
We have some time.

348
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:26,644
Can I take you somewhere?

349
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,956
"Moving Picture Club"

350
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,969
What is it?

351
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,890
A flying car of the future
in year 2011.

352
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,142
Start.

353
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,860
The Planet of Light.

354
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:20,406
The earth began spinning off its axis,
losing its field of gravity.

355
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,451
Fundamental changes occurred
in the earth's crust.

356
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:29,332
The artist, Hiro, painted a cherry tree
with 100 buds on the wall.

357
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,503
When these buds blossom,
help will arrive.

358
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:38,424
They waited, believing it was so.

359
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,094
And...

360
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:47,475
"Bathhouse"

361
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:56,275
I go this way.

362
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,570
I'll transform myself
into a girl of the 70s.

363
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,948
Feels wonderful...

364
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:11,082
Paradise...

365
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,038
Right there.

366
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:54,834
Feels great.

367
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,714
Hey.

368
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:04,385
It felt so good.

369
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:05,803
You took too long.

370
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,931
I'm all warmed up.

371
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:10,558
I'm cold.

372
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,560
How do I look?

373
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:16,355
Beautimus, don't you think?

374
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:20,234
Beautimus?
What language is that?

375
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,487
Beautimus.

376
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,490
It's totally 70s!

377
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,413
Just like that song.

378
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,794
What?

379
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:44,300
You were staring at me.

380
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,511
No, I wasn't.

381
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,930
Let's go. It's cold.

382
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,373
It's too hard to pick her out.

383
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:21,337
But she's here for sure.
Let's find her.

384
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,104
Your mom?

385
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,657
Excuse me...

386
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:53,160
I'm looking for someone.

387
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:57,582
A guy named Kazuo Fukamachi.

388
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,001
Kazuo Fukamachi?

389
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:05,548
Your classmate in junior high.

390
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,888
That's me?

391
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:17,518
You know him, right?

392
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:21,689
No. I'm sorry.

393
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:26,694
I don't remember taking this photo either.

394
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:32,700
But... you're in it with him.

395
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,244
Same class badge...

396
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,470
I'm sorry.

397
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,310
I'll come back tomorrow.

398
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:05,066
Maybe you'll remember something.

399
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,193
Goodbye.

400
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:21,248
Your mom doesn't even
know him. We're stumped.

401
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,127
He really might be a ghost.

402
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,255
Absolutely not.

403
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:32,718
She made the liquid to
come see him herself.

404
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,013
You're right.

405
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:44,563
Can we go visit someone?

406
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:08,838
Gotetsu... It's Ryota.

407
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,225
Oh, you were here.

408
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,477
Hi.

409
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,106
Does everybody do this?

410
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,692
Your girlfriend?

411
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:34,196
No. My cousin Akari.

412
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,448
Hello.

413
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:39,285
Akari... "Light"... Nice name.

414
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:43,581
Light is essential to good shots.

415
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,918
Please get dressed.

416
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:51,005
This is Gotetsu, the cameraman.

417
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,592
Gotetsu?

418
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,012
His nickname for staying up

419
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:01,766
five straight nights gambling.

420
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,726
Hey there.

421
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,940
Well drawn.

422
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,650
Good, huh?

423
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,707
You okay?

424
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,334
Don't you get it?

425
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:31,962
My dick won't get hard
with a drawing like this.

426
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,215
Make it hard.

427
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,591
It'll get hard.

428
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:40,638
Gimme a hard-on.

429
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:03,035
Shit! My camera!

430
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:08,207
Get a rag.

431
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:11,710
Wipe it.

432
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,295
Ryota...

433
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:49,248
Do you remember anything?

434
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,798
I'm sorry I can't help you.

435
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:06,640
Is there something between
me and him in the photo?

436
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:14,190
Rather a lot...

437
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:20,988
So, why a school in Yokohama?

438
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,949
I want to go into pharmacy studies,

439
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:30,456
and this school has
a strong science course.

440
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:44,303
When did you decide that?

441
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:47,681
At the end of junior high.

442
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:53,229
I suddenly felt compelled
to study pharmacy.

443
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,316
From way back then...

444
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:08,369
There's something else
I want to ask you.

445
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:15,960
This was at a friend's house.

446
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:23,175
Hasegawa took this.
He's my friend's tutor.

447
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,344
Do you know him?

448
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,847
Hasegawa?

449
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,558
Masamichi Hasegawa.

450
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:36,689
Gotetsu... That's what
everybody calls him.

451
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,776
"Masamichi Hasegawa"

452
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,276
What're you doing here?

453
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:53,015
What's your family like?

454
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,018
My family?

455
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:02,691
Mom, Dad, and a little sister.

456
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,695
Dad runs a printing factory in Akita.

457
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:12,201
He's not making you
take over the business?

458
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:22,586
I'm sure he wants me to.

459
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,216
But he's letting you live your own life.

460
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,593
A good father does.

461
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,770
What about you?

462
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,564
My family?

463
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,319
I ...

464
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,032
What?

465
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,868
Well...

466
00:56:57,038 --> 00:57:03,127
I barely remember my dad.

467
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,882
When I was small...

468
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:14,263
he left me and my mom.

469
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:23,981
Mom took good care of me...

470
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:28,068
and I never knew him anyway...

471
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:32,698
so I never felt lonely.

472
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:42,708
But still, I always imagined...

473
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:48,213
what having a dad would be like.

474
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:04,646
That was a stupid story.

475
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,446
Can I have one?

476
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,490
Sure.

477
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:31,715

479
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:38,472
How should we spend it?

480
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:47,064
How about this?
He might see it.

It'll stay printed
in the future too.

483
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:58,408
Maybe he's also from the future.

484
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,912
What if he doesn't exist now?

485
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,959
That could be.

486
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:13,131
That couldn't be.

487
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:15,425
No way.

488
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:16,718
But you're here.

489
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,805

Please, we only have 40,000 yen.

It's 50,000 yen per frame.

That's our rate.

493

But you see, it's an emergency.

494
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:38,615
Her future depends on it.

495
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:44,288
Yes... my future.

496
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:45,747
My future?

497
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,208
In a sense.

498
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,376
We beg you.

499
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,753
Please.

500
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,049
All right. 40,000 then.

501
00:59:56,384 --> 01:00:00,095
Don't tell anyone else.

502
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:03,056
Thank you!

503
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:04,766
Don't say it loud.

504
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,066
Looks good.

505
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,871
Mix and eat.

01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,560
I'm scared shitless.

510
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,854
Just don't drop the equipment.

511
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:55,317
You're weightless, remember?

512
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:59,738
Like you're floating on air.

513
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:04,159
I think... you should move slower.

514
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:05,911
How many should I take?

01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,372
What roll is it?

516
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,374
Five.

517
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:14,336
Let's do it.

518
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,296
Camera rolling.

519
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:21,718
Ready... Action!

520
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,646
Ryota...

521
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,940
Thanks.

522
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,574
I'll take this.

523
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,451
Thanks.

524
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,871
You're not his cousin.

525
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:52,499
How do you know?

526
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,751
I can tell.

527
01:01:56,921 --> 01:02:02,050
When we finish this movie,
I'm going to the US.

528
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,886
To study photography.

529
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:11,560
Look after him while I'm gone.

530
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:19,401
Do you have to go?

531
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:30,203
What if she asks you not to go?

532
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,514
She'll never say that.

533
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,350
But what if?

534
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,979
She'd tell me to go.

535
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,191
She's strong-minded.

536
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,987
She won't stop me.
She'll force me to go.

537
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:13,038
Gotetsu, come here!

538
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:19,336
Let's move the camera
instead of zooming in.

539
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:20,420
Which cut?

540
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:23,340
Cut 1.

541
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:29,596
I have to get out there and
connect the transmitter.

542
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,431
Are you serious?

543
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:35,852
It's better than just
waiting here to die.

544
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:40,565
Are we going to die?

545
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:46,696
Cut!

546
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:12,305
Haru...

547
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,600
Goodbye.

548
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,900
Cut!

549
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,033
OK!

550
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:36,121
Are we wrapping up?

551
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:37,789
We're finished!

552
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:41,626
Good job!

553
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,189
Kazuko...

554
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:08,570
If...

555
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:15,535
Gotetsu is going faraway,
what would you do?

556
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:20,749
Another strange question.

557
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:26,755
You mean, to the US.

558
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:32,344
Or other places.

559
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,892
I'll wish him luck.

560
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:44,397
I want him to do what he wants.

561
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:48,985
But I'm not as strong as I sound.

562
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,618
You like him.

563
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:24,604
Where are you going?

564
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,315
To return the equipment.

565
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,859
Can I go with you?

566
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:32,988
Yeah, if you want.

567
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:35,365
Then I will.

568
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:57,887
70s men are so complicated.

569
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:20,076
The ad will be run tomorrow.

570
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:29,544
I hope he shows.

571
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:42,766
They're waiting for you
in the future, right?

572
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,394
Yeah.

573
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:05,038
This song...

574
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,290
Takuro.

575
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:13,171
It's from this decade, huh.

576
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:53,920
Why did you let me stay?

577
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:03,388
Just because...

578
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:19,654
I suppose nobody would reject...

579
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:23,575
a pretty girl like me.

580
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:47,098
Ryota...

581
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:56,357
You're gonna be a famous director...

582
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:03,198
and marry a beautiful actress...

583
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:10,872
and have cute kids.

584
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,001
But...

585
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,799
At that time...

586
01:10:23,093 --> 01:10:26,888
I'll be...

587
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:32,268
a person of the past.

588
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,857
Weird.

589
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:45,531
'Cuz I'm from the future.

590
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:05,510
I gotta go out.

591
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:08,096
Ryota...

592
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,241
Gotetsu.

593
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:32,328
I need a favor.

594
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:33,246
What happened?

595
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:36,499
Can I borrow your camera?

596
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:40,044
The last scene...

597
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:41,671
What?

598
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:50,430
I want to shoot it myself.

599
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:57,020
Say yes.

600
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:14,829
You owe me one.

601
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,417
Thanks.

602
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,723
Here.

603
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:37,310
"Awaiting Kazuo Fukamachi
Mar. 2 in the science lab"

604
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:56,079
I'm playing the part?

605
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,920
Ready.

606
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:05,630
Action.

607
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:51,592
These cherry blossoms
36 years from now...

608
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:55,179
They're still blooming.

609
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:58,933
Nothing changes here.

610
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,480
When it's your time...

611
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:13,656
Wouldn't it be nice if
we could view them together?

612
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:19,036
Yes.

613
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:28,796
You sure? I'll be 56.

614
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:32,842
Dig that.

615
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:34,802
What?

616
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:39,974
It means "I accept."

617
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:43,728
You dig... accept.

618
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:47,315
Yeah, "dig"...

619
01:15:10,714 --> 01:15:14,175
Ken, look at this.

620
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:19,430
"Awaiting Kazuo Fukamachi
Mar. 2 in the science lab"

621
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,724
This is...

622
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,905
Yes.

623
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:39,617
Hold on.

624
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:44,247
Ryota, it's from your mother.

625
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:51,671
Hello.

626
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:58,135
Hi.

627
01:15:59,137 --> 01:16:01,180
Did you go to the photoshop?

628
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:04,892
The film's being developed?

629
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:13,484
I'm really excited so
I was just wondering...

630
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:19,365
Ryota?

631
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:26,372
My dad collapsed.

632
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,334
A stroke.

633
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,051
He overworked himself.

634
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:46,225
Business wasn't that great
when I left home...

635
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:53,107
but the factory nearly went
bankrupt because of the oil shock.

636
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:58,446
He struggled to rebuild the business.

637
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,249
I knew that, but I didn't go back.

638
01:17:15,839 --> 01:17:18,633
I pretended not to notice.

639
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:27,683
I deserted my family.

640
01:17:37,944 --> 01:17:45,201
Don't blame yourself for your father.

641
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:50,414
He wanted you to live your own life.

642
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:59,674
I was playing around making a movie.

643
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:02,718
I was selfish.

644
01:18:20,153 --> 01:18:23,030
You don't have to rush.

645
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:26,617
Give it time.

646
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:30,496
You can complete your film.

647
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:35,334
It's not like the future.

648
01:23:19,452 --> 01:23:21,245
Are you the one?

649
01:23:43,643 --> 01:23:45,561
Are you...

650
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:50,357
Kazuo Fukamachi?

651
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,360
Who are you?

652
01:23:55,488 --> 01:23:57,406
Akari.

653
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,368
Akari Yoshiyama.

654
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:07,833
Kazuko's daughter.

655
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:13,297
Kazuko Yoshiyama.

656
01:24:16,259 --> 01:24:18,761
Who made the time-leap liquid?

657
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:19,845
My mother.

658
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:20,888
She did?

659
01:24:21,097 --> 01:24:26,185
Yes, to see you.

660
01:24:28,772 --> 01:24:30,773
But...

661
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:35,903
she was in an accident.

662
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:39,990
She's in the hospital.

663
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:44,495
So I came instead.

664
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:46,330
Her condition?

665
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,544
I see.

666
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:58,050
The plan was...

667
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:02,846
to leap to April 1972.

668
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:05,682
But I made a mistake.

669
01:25:08,812 --> 01:25:11,063
So, why?

670
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:18,070
You're not in high school?

671
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:25,327
I came from 2698.

672
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:32,084
2698?!

673
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:37,047
I received information that
someone from 2010...

674
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:42,761
leapt through time
looking for Kazuo Fukamachi.

675
01:25:43,179 --> 01:25:49,518
To confirm that, I traced
you through time-space.

676
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:54,273
What information?

677
01:25:54,524 --> 01:26:01,029
My old name was in the newspaper.

678
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:06,326
My real name is Ken Sogoru.

679
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:12,124
Ken Sogoru...

680
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:18,672
So the ad reached...

681
01:26:18,923 --> 01:26:24,303
2698, huh...

682
01:26:27,557 --> 01:26:30,142
Sogoru.

683
01:26:30,476 --> 01:26:32,644
What a name.

684
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:35,063
Oh, this...

685
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:57,085
I failed to erase this...

686
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:02,549
What's her message?

687
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:09,306
"I remember the promise."

688
01:27:16,814 --> 01:27:22,152
What did you promise my mom?

689
01:27:25,031 --> 01:27:28,200
I came here in 1972...

690
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:34,331
with the time-leap liquid
we were testing.

691
01:27:34,874 --> 01:27:38,293
I misplaced the dose
for the return.

692
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:44,883
So I became Fukamachi
for the time being.

693
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:49,721
That's when I met her.

694
01:28:23,506 --> 01:28:27,259
She accidentally inhaled the fumes...

695
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:31,972
and became able to leap
short spans of time.

696
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:37,144
The scent was lavender.

697
01:28:40,356 --> 01:28:45,610
Then I fell in love with her.

698
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:48,947
But I had to return to the future

699
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:57,039
and erase her memory of me.

700
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:02,836
Will you come see me again?

701
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:07,549
Yes.

702
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:13,930
Only I won't be Kazuo Fukamachi,
but someone else.

703
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:19,728
But I will come visit the future you.

704
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:34,659
My memory might disappear but
my heart will remember the promise.

705
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:05,732
You accomplished your mission.

706
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:09,528
You must go back now.

707
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:13,323
My mission is...

708
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:19,246
to erase everyone's memory
that you were here.

709
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:24,835
Wait.

710
01:30:29,298 --> 01:30:32,801
There's someone I have to see.

711
01:30:38,182 --> 01:30:40,725
After I see him,

712
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:44,563
I'll go back to the future.

713
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:52,112
Fine. I'll wait until tonight.

714
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:29,774
"I'm waiting for you in
the science lab - Akari"

715
01:32:17,907 --> 01:32:20,408
I gave it to him.

716
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:24,913
My mother's message.

717
01:32:28,292 --> 01:32:31,503
I wish I met him too.

718
01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:38,802
You'd be surprised.

719
01:32:39,762 --> 01:32:43,181
He was so different.

720
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,143
More so, then.

721
01:32:51,357 --> 01:32:54,401
I'm going back...

722
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:58,238
to Akita on tonight's bus.

723
01:32:58,531 --> 01:33:03,994
I'll call you tomorrow when I arrive.

724
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:09,833
Tomorrow...

725
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:20,927
It's my birthday.

726
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:26,474
I just remembered.

727
01:33:28,811 --> 01:33:31,062
Seriously?

728
01:33:42,658 --> 01:33:47,787
I want you to keep this.

729
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:52,876
What is it?

730
01:33:53,085 --> 01:33:58,006
The film, but with no sound.

731
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:03,845
I'll be back soon.

732
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:12,354
This movie...

733
01:34:14,357 --> 01:34:16,733
I'll complete it.

734
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:30,330
When I come back...

735
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:38,213
let's watch it together.

736
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:42,717
It'll be your birthday present.

737
01:35:12,998 --> 01:35:15,667
When you come back...

738
01:35:20,005 --> 01:35:22,757
I won't be here.

739
01:35:55,666 --> 01:35:57,667
Thank you.

740
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:31,868
The film ...

741
01:36:32,703 --> 01:36:34,704
Don't lose it.

742
01:37:05,277 --> 01:37:06,694
Excuse me.

743
01:37:07,321 --> 01:37:08,780
Sorry.

744
01:37:09,406 --> 01:37:10,782
Akari?

745
01:37:11,784 --> 01:37:14,661
Unc... Goro.

746
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:17,372
What are you carrying?

747
01:37:17,581 --> 01:37:21,084
Ski things, but I forgot
my bus ticket at home.

748
01:37:22,336 --> 01:37:24,045
It leaves in 20 minutes.

749
01:37:26,215 --> 01:37:27,507
From where?

750
01:37:27,716 --> 01:37:29,050
Shinjuku.

751
01:37:30,052 --> 01:37:30,969
Where's your house?

752
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:32,595
Futako.

753
01:37:34,056 --> 01:37:37,433
You'll never make it.

754
01:37:38,769 --> 01:37:41,396
I was so looking forward to it.

755
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:43,773
Where were you going?

756
01:37:43,983 --> 01:37:45,900
Noshiro in Akita.

757
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:47,986
Akita...

758
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:51,906
I'm going back...

759
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:56,411
to Akita on tonight's bus.

760
01:37:57,913 --> 01:38:00,248
The Noshiro night bus accident.

761
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:04,627
The bus was traveling
northbound on Route 4...

762
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:07,922
when it fell off a cliff...

763
01:38:08,173 --> 01:38:13,344
killing 38 people onboard.

764
01:38:14,054 --> 01:38:19,183
I was supposed to be on this bus.

765
01:38:20,477 --> 01:38:24,898
I'll call you tomorrow when I arrive.

766
01:38:25,357 --> 01:38:27,984
I'll be back soon.

767
01:38:31,447 --> 01:38:34,490
Is something wrong?

768
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:37,160
Ryota...

769
01:38:39,121 --> 01:38:41,122
Where are you going?!

770
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:21,120
Excuse me.

771
01:39:21,413 --> 01:39:22,789
Where's the bus to Akita?

772
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,916
Over there.

773
01:39:32,466 --> 01:39:34,175
"For Akita"

774
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:36,803
Ticket, please!

775
01:39:38,055 --> 01:39:44,143
Ryota!

776
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:47,855
You have to get off.

777
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:49,941
Isn't this the bus to Akita?

778
01:39:50,275 --> 01:39:53,528
Yes, but that one goes to Noshiro.

779
01:40:00,077 --> 01:40:02,704
"Noshiro"

780
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:26,144
Ryota!

781
01:40:52,629 --> 01:40:55,173
Let me go!

782
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:58,509
You mustn't change the past.

783
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:04,265
Then I'm not going back to the future!

784
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:15,943
I'm going to stay.

785
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:23,367
Ryota!

786
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:33,961
Wait!

787
01:41:50,187 --> 01:41:52,313
Let me go!

788
01:41:52,564 --> 01:41:56,901
It's cruel but it's history.

789
01:42:01,281 --> 01:42:05,868
Stop the time.

790
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:10,832
Ryota!

791
01:42:32,896 --> 01:42:35,815
I'm sorry...

792
01:42:47,077 --> 01:42:49,829
I'm erasing your memory.

793
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:10,720
Today, let's travel back
in time to Mar. 3, 1974.

794
01:45:11,888 --> 01:45:16,642
The Noshiro night bus accident.

795
01:46:56,868 --> 01:47:00,413
You got the message.

796
01:47:01,289 --> 01:47:02,873
Yes.

797
01:47:04,876 --> 01:47:08,921
You came as Kazuo Fukamachi.

798
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:16,387
Thank you.

799
01:47:23,645 --> 01:47:26,689
She's a lot like you.

800
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:44,707
We'll meet again...

801
01:47:45,625 --> 01:47:48,419
in the future.

802
01:48:33,215 --> 01:48:39,845
Mom ...

803
01:48:40,055 --> 01:48:41,722
Mom.

804
01:48:44,226 --> 01:48:47,019
My mother woke up.

805
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:50,856
It's me, Mom!

806
01:48:51,107 --> 01:48:53,234
Akari...

807
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:59,949
We'll take an M RI but
I'm sure she'll be fine.

808
01:49:00,492 --> 01:49:02,701
Thank you.

809
01:49:06,873 --> 01:49:08,707
Akari.

810
01:49:10,335 --> 01:49:16,215
I smell a familiar scent.

811
01:49:17,342 --> 01:49:20,386
Familiar scent?

812
01:49:37,279 --> 01:49:38,779
This?

813
01:49:39,781 --> 01:49:42,074
It's lavender.

814
01:49:43,368 --> 01:49:45,869
Who brought it?

815
01:49:48,582 --> 01:49:51,792
It smells nice.

816
01:50:09,853 --> 01:50:11,270
"The Planet of Light"

817
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:28,996
Hello.

818
01:50:29,581 --> 01:50:32,082
This is Hasegawa.

819
01:50:34,044 --> 01:50:35,836
Akari?

820
01:50:36,171 --> 01:50:37,880
Yeah.

821
01:50:38,381 --> 01:50:40,674
How's your mom?

822
01:50:41,968 --> 01:50:45,679
She's gonna be fine.

823
01:50:45,972 --> 01:50:48,599
Good.

824
01:50:59,527 --> 01:51:05,074
Can I ask you something?

825
01:51:14,376 --> 01:51:16,210
Doing good?

826
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:23,175
You watch 8mm, huh?

827
01:51:26,012 --> 01:51:28,097
Who's the director?

828
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:33,811
The title?

829
01:51:35,605 --> 01:51:38,565
"The Planet of Light."

830
01:51:43,321 --> 01:51:45,572
What's the matter?

831
01:51:49,786 --> 01:51:53,038
I guess it's a common title.

832
01:51:55,333 --> 01:52:02,089
The same title of one
I shot with an old friend.

833
01:52:11,725 --> 01:52:14,685
This is the projector, right?

834
01:52:14,936 --> 01:52:16,311
Can you carry it?

835
01:52:16,813 --> 01:52:21,775
Yeah. My friend's in the car.

836
01:52:21,943 --> 01:52:23,777
Okay.

837
01:52:29,784 --> 01:52:34,037
See ya.

838
01:52:44,174 --> 01:52:46,592
Thanks.

839
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:03,609
You really know how to use that?

840
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:05,819
I got it.

841
01:53:09,324 --> 01:53:10,824
Lights off.

842
01:53:19,209 --> 01:53:21,585
Ready?

843
01:53:24,839 --> 01:53:29,301
"The Planet of Light"

844
01:53:32,972 --> 01:53:34,890
What is this?

845
01:54:36,703 --> 01:54:42,958
"Don't paint the last cherry blossom"

846
01:55:03,855 --> 01:55:07,858
"Directed by Ryota Mizorogi"

847
01:55:15,533 --> 01:55:19,411
That was too bizarre.

848
01:55:33,593 --> 01:55:36,929
Why are you crying?

849
01:55:37,263 --> 01:55:39,723
I don't know.

850
01:55:40,767 --> 01:55:43,435
Why am I?

851
01:55:47,607 --> 01:55:50,651
This was inside.

852
01:55:57,283 --> 01:56:02,496
"For you viewing the cherry
blossoms of the future"
