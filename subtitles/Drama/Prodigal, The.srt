<i>Episode 17</i>

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,000
Please everyone, I have one thing to say.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,760
Let's gather in the big hall.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,470
Don't act alone. As long as we're all together,

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,520
Fu Hongxue will have no opportunity to hurt anyone.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,090
Well said. No matter how dangerous Fu Hongxue is,

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,540
he can't handle all of us.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,110
You've been guarding the Hall for several nights, you must be tired.

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,180
What are you up to now?

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,390
I see you working hard earning a living,

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,530
let's make a deal.

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,860
Deal. What type of deal?

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,830
Something that'll earn you some money.

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,580
What do you want us to do?

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,720
Release me and let me see the big boss.

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,560
You think you can just walk in to see him?

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,040
I have important information for him.

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,710
What kind of trick are you playing?

20
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,760
Release me. Not only will you earn some money,

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,130
you will also get some recognition.

22
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,500
This win win situation, why not take advantage?

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,130
Search carefully.

24
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,070
When I see the big boss,

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,630
I will definite praise all of you.

26
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,190
How dare you,

27
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,260
to betray Ten Thousand Hall! <br> We won't dare.

28
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,580
I'll deal with you later.

29
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,600
You've already been driven out of Ten Thousand Hall.

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,440
Why are you still here?

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,450
I wan to see the boss and tell him about Fu Hongxue's past.

32
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,240
I haven't forgotten 5 year ago, you tried to trick big boss.

33
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,190
If it wasn't for the Miss, I would have killed you with my sword.

34
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,730
GonSun Duan, Ten Thousand Hall is under serious threat.

35
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,400
If you're really concerned then stay out of my way.

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,120
Be quiet!

37
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,880
How can someone like you help?

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,210
Fine. If you won't leave,

39
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,640
then don't blame me. Guards.

40
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,310
Here. <br>Take her away.

41
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,050
Yes sir!

42
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,650
Enjoy your stay.

43
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,630
Put her in there.

44
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,800
Why are you here?

45
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,900
How are you?

46
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,380
Let me ask. Where were you on the day Murong Mingzhu died?

47
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,460
You really want to ask me,

48
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,210
if I killed Murong Mingzhu. <br> Did you kill him?

49
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,510
No.

50
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,600
On wedding day, everyone was there except you.

51
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,030
If you're not the killer then who? <br> You don't believe me.

52
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,730
Why won't I believe you?

53
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,700
Actually, I rather the killer is you.

54
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,590
At least it proves that you returned because of me.

55
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,820
You belong to the demon sect, right?

56
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:37,540
Right, I belong to the demon sect.

57
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,170
I really don't care.

58
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,690
What really mattered was why did you tell me

59
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,490
you were an assassin? <br> Why did you lie?

60
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,480
I wanted to tell you the truth.

61
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,690
Knowing I must kill you

62
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,790
I just can't do it.

63
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,150
But you still lied.

64
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,800
Yes, I lied.

65
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,220
I was deceitful back then,

66
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,540
trying to get close to Ten Thousand Hall and you.

67
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,080
But you changed my mind.

68
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,170
Leave quickly.

69
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,460
I know there is a secret tunnel.

70
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,440
Only known to me and my father.

71
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,590
I'll take you. <br> No, I can't leave yet.

72
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,490
Why? <br> Because I need to capture Heaven Dog,

73
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,170
to prove my innocence.

74
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,090
But everyone thinks you're the killer. They're after you.

75
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,970
You must face not only Heaven Dog but also everyone else.

76
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,540
I'll tell them you're innocent.

77
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,860
No. That's unnecessary.

78
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,240
If you do that, then they'll think you're covering up for me.

79
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,990
Then how can I help?

80
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,750
Just stay safe.

81
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,270
Say no more. Do nothing. Wait for my news.

82
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,510
You're alone. What if something should happen?

83
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,590
Miss. <br> I should leave.

84
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,240
Promise me you'll be fine.

85
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,040
Wait for me.

86
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,950
Miss. Are you there? <br> Coming.

87
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,640
Gonsun da ge, what can I do for you?

88
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,140
Have you seen anything strange inside?

89
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,390
Nothing. What's happening?

90
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,040
Fu Hongxue may be nearby.

91
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,250
I'll stand guard outside. Just call if you need me.

92
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,060
Fine. I'll take a rest.

93
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,640
<i>Timing &amp; subtitles brought to you by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki </i>

94
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,560
I just took a headcount,

95
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,040
other than the 38 horse slaves in the cell

96
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,600
and Flying spider who has left, the dead Murong young master, and Left sect leader,

97
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,840
everyone else should be here. Total is 181 people.

98
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,740
No trace of Fu Hongxue.

99
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,710
You're an intelligent woman. <br> Keep quiet.

100
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,070
I thought you're smart but you still foolish things.

101
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,840
No matter what, you shouldn't consider suicide.

102
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,530
What...even you're scalding me.

103
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,530
I won't dare. I swear

104
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,760
that I nothing will happen to you.

105
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,600
Ye Kai, let me ask you something. You're always joking around,

106
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,370
are you really happy?

107
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,580
Of course. Why won't I be happy?

108
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,070
I'm the leaf on a tree, heart of joy.

109
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,510
Kai (opening) of the word "happy"

110
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,370
You're right.

111
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,360
I used to think I was happy.

112
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,720
What I want, I get.

113
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,180
After I met him, I discovered I was only fooling myself.

114
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,760
He must have drugged you.

115
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,600
Do you know anything about real love?

116
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,400
What a joke. I"m a casanova.

117
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,100
Thousands of beauties cannot capture me.

118
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,430
Not wilingl or won't dare?

119
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:19,020
Yes, you're willing to help anyone in need.

120
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,140
But have you ever thought

121
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,100
there is someone different in this world.

122
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,710
When I'm with him, the way I see him is different.

123
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,970
Even talking to him feels different.

124
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,710
If I can't be with him,

125
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,000
then life becomes meaningless.

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,600
See him with different eyes,

127
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,920
how different?

128
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,060
Just like how Ding Linglin watches you.

129
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,810
I'm really fine.

130
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,480
If you have time, then go spend it with Ding Linglin.

131
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,910
You two haven't spoken a word these past few days.

132
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,510
She must be upset.

133
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,690
Miss Ding. There is nothing between us. You're assuming too much.

134
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,260
I'm not over assuming. You're just too thoughtless.

135
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,480
What are you doing?

136
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,860
Stop drinking. You already drank too much.

137
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,470
Stop bothering me. What's with your <i>World's fastest sward.</i>

138
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,410
acting like a bothersome dog I can't shake off.

139
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,620
If I''m a bothersome dog, then

140
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,700
you're a bone dangling in front of me.

141
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,170
You!

142
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,580
So annoying.

143
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,870
Quick. Come closer.

144
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,490
Miss Ding, I have something to say to you.

145
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,670
Ye Kai,

146
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:19,610
can't you see that the two of us are happily drinking here?

147
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,390
You two? No way.

148
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,270
Why not?

149
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,470
Brother Lu is brave and handsome. And is extremely considerate.

150
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,440
I should really thank you.

151
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,590
If not for you, then I won't have met him.

152
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,350
For real?

153
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,050
How long since you met?

154
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,700
It was love at first sight.

155
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,810
<i> When a boat gets to a bridge, it will automatically straighten.</i>

156
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:55,570
Oh right, Brother Lu, In a few days, aren't we going to the hot springs?

157
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,740
Hot springs?

158
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,820
That's right.

159
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,840
Hot springs,

160
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,130
sounds great. Great for circulation and extend your longivity.

161
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,290
When you go soaking in hot springs, are you dressed or naked?

162
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,460
Idiot! Who wears clothes soaking in hot springs?

163
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,420
Right. <br> Naked! You...

164
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,010
Right. No clothes.

165
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:19,990
You...

166
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,320
You...you...what about us?

167
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,480
Fine. That's your business.

168
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,620
Then why are you standing there like a pole?

169
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,000
Here's some wine.

170
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,590
You're acting like a crazy drunkard.

171
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,010
Fine. Miss Ding.

172
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:42,630
Based on our past relationship,

173
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,310
can I ask a favor?

174
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,810
What relationship?

175
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,340
What do you want?

176
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:56,810
Something strange about Heaven Dog's killing in the Ten Thousand Hall.

177
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,240
I probably can't capture him by myself.

178
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,370
If you're willing to help, then we can definitely get him.

179
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,350
Wulin experts are everywhere,

180
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,270
why ask me?

181
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:14,230
These people may be skilled, but you're the only medical expert here.

182
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:19,370
I thought the only lead to capture the killer, must be hidden in the dead body.

183
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,920
Only now do you think of me.

184
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,540
I must ask if Lu gē is okay with this.

185
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,910
Brother Lu, is it okay?

186
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,940
No way.

187
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,150
You brat how could you have no code of brotherhood?

188
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,010
Whenever Sister Ding is with you she always gets hurt.

189
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,660
This time, there is no way I'm letting you have her!

190
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,100
Well said.

191
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,020
If Brother Lu doesn't agree, then I can't help it.

192
00:12:54,020 --> 00:13:00,280
Hero Lu, I promise you I won't disrespect your precious Miss Ding.

193
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,780
I won't insult her, won't let her come to her. Is that okay?

194
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,510
Really?

195
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,750
Then if it's like this, if I say something you cannot disagree.

196
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,750
If I say go East, you can't tell me to go West.

197
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,720
Fine.

198
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,610
Run from here to there and from there to here. 100 times.

199
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,190
Aren't you being ridiculous now?

200
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,370
Exactly.

201
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,390
Do you not want my help now?

202
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,670
Fine, I'll run.

203
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,770
Run! Run!

204
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,440
Faster!

205
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,100
Run faster!

206
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,010
Stupid fool.

207
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:59,210
I already said it before! You need me with you, there's no way you don't need me!

208
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,790
Miss Ding, then when are we going to go to the hot springs without our clothes?

209
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,670
In your dreams.

210
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,870
I say, why are you women always so weird?

211
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,640
I've missed you so much!

212
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,780
Today you've ended up in our hands, this feels great!

213
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,790
In awhile I will satisfy you!

214
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,220
Should you strip first? Or should we strip first?

215
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,240
Hurry hurry!

216
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,330
The grand masters are here!

217
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,580
This blade is quick, be careful you don't hurt yourself.

218
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,330
I know how to use a knife. Don't worry.

219
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,360
You obviously know who I am.

220
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,420
You know I want to kill you.

221
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,190
Why are you here to save me?

222
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,130
No reason.

223
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,520
Was Murong Mingzhu killed by you?

224
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,480
No.

225
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,470
How much money did the Ten Thousand Horse Hall give you that you are here selling your life?

226
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,260
Seems like Fang Ling never told you about me.

227
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,370
Ma Fang Ling?

228
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:21,600
Have you not heard about how she has an older sister who grew up with her?

229
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,230
You are her sister?

230
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,500
Do you want the truth?

231
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,460
Of course.

232
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,940
We are not blood related.

233
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:48,270
My mother is just a servant working in their house.

234
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,520
She was raped.

235
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,140
Then she gave birth to me.

236
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:02,160
In order to protect me and let me stay with the Ma family,

237
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,410
she didn't let me interact with anyone else,

238
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,000
until I met Fang Ling.

239
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,190
She took care of me.

240
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,300
She even made her father take me as their god daughter.

241
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:21,630
But my mother... in order to let me leave the manor earlier,

242
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,590
she killed Fang Ling's mother.

243
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:34,740
I owe her.

244
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,800
So I have to protect the Ten Thousand Horse Hall,

245
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,400
protect Ma Fang Ling.

246
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,960
Anyone who hurts them is my enemy.

247
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,100
So you only live because you have a debt to repay.

248
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,810
But me, I live to claim a debt.

249
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:08,250
That's why heaven let us meet. That's quite funny.

250
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,550
You were together for so long,

251
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,960
so the two of you are similar in many ways.

252
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:25,230
Alike? I don't think so.

253
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,310
There is at least one point in common.

254
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,870
When you both talk to me, you like to keep a knife at my throat.

255
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,050
You're wrong.

256
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,850
We are not the same.

257
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,780
She uses a knife at your neck because

258
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,810
she is angry at you.

259
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:56,780
But me, I really want to kill you.

260
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,110
If you had to choose between one of us,

261
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,030
who would you choose?

262
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,580
Leave.

263
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,740
Leave the Ten Thousand Horse Hall.

264
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,400
Now it is not safe here.

265
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:35,610
You think I will leave so easily?

266
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,050
Someone come! There's an intruder!

267
00:19:50,960 --> 00:20:00,020
<i>Timing &amp; subtitles brought to you by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki </i>

268
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,590
It's been two hours but nothing has changed.

269
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,730
It seems you are wise. As long as we are together,

270
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,780
that Heaven Dog will definitely not come!

271
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:19,340
No matter how great he is, there is no way he will dare go against so many people.

272
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,720
But us just sitting here, is not a method.

273
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,270
Big Boss! Something went wrong!

274
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,780
Flying Spider has died!

275
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,720
What happened?

276
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,860
Big Boss. At the main entrance

277
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,400
we discovered Flying Spider's body.

278
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:49,010
Damn that Heaven Dog. If you have any guts, come out and

279
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,110
let's fight to death.

280
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,250
Again, died of thirteen knife wounds.

281
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,130
He also cut off his right arm. He's so cruel.

282
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,780
Is that Heaven Dog even human?

283
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,320
Heaven and earth are disturbed.

284
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,610
Ma Kongqun.

285
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,950
you allow two people die for you.

286
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,230
You're the leader of Wulin's largest sect but you're such coward.

287
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,280
Are you still human?

288
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,600
Heaven Dog. Come out!

289
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:31,260
Come out. Show yourself.

290
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,890
Come out! Come out.

291
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,270
Come out now.

292
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,540
Quiet. Quiet.

293
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,150
Heaven Dog is intentionally messing with your concentration.

294
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:48,260
If you act this way, you're walking right into his trap.

295
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,380
Ma Kongqun.

296
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,170
You're wasting your time. You can't kill me.

297
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:01,040
Ma Kongqun. You can't kill me. Ha ha.

298
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,560
Open the door.

299
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,600
Don't kill him. He's a fake.

300
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,320
He's not Heaven Dog. He's the leader of Zulongshan, Bao Erlei.

301
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,610
How is that possible?

302
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,480
I just saw him in the main hall.

303
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,520
He's not Heaven dog but a scapegoat.

304
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:00,650
Ma Kongqun. That's the third person.

305
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,440
This time you helped me killed with your own hand.

306
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,500
I should thank you.

307
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,970
You killed without batting an eye. You animal!

308
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,320
Animal. You're the animal.

309
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,670
You killed them. They died for you.

310
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:20,750
No one will hate me. They hate only you. Ma Kongqun.

311
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,700
Come out. You come out!

312
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,780
Come out. Heaven Dog!

313
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:34,010
Don't think I'm afraid of you. Come out!

314
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:37,890
Look at yourself. Your strength is useless.

315
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,910
You can't hurt me.

316
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,380
If you don't die, I will keep playing with you.

317
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,060
Come out, Heaven Dog!

318
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:55,210
Heaven and earth are disturbed. Bloody eyes and dark moons.

319
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:01,140
One Ten Thousand Horse Hall. Knifes weakens, people loses their innards.

320
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:06,880
One Ten Thousand Horse Hall. Knifes weakens, people loses their innards.

321
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:15,450
Ma Kongqun. If you add Murong young master, that's

322
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,640
4 people.

323
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,280
As the leader of Ten Thousand Horse Hall, shouldn't you do something?

324
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,280
What do you mean by that?

325
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,440
Fu Hongxue just said, after every set time

326
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,110
he will kill one person until everyone's dead.

327
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,310
Only way to stop him

328
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:43,070
is for you to commit suicide.

329
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,970
You mean for me to die?

330
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:56,410
I don't want you dead. It's Heaven Dog that wants you dead.

331
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:00,870
We only received the invitation to attend the wedding.

332
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:05,220
You're dispute with Heaven Dog is none of our business.

333
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,280
Only thing for us to do is to leave here safely.

334
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,720
If you want to leave safely,

335
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,620
then we should kill the murderer together.

336
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,980
Ma sect leader, don't blame me if I say anything rash.

337
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,540
From my perspective, you're not his equal.

338
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,880
If we continue like this, we'll all

339
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,770
die needlessly.

340
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,590
You're rude.

341
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:39,680
GongSun Duan, have you forgotten what Fu Hongxue said?

342
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,570
As long as Ma Kongqun is alive, after each set time

343
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,610
he'll kill one of us.

344
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,350
Maybe the next time is you.

345
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,960
You!

346
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:59,060
Ma Kongqun. You're Wulin's big brother.

347
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,580
Now act like a big brother.

348
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,360
Normally, Ten Thousand Horse Hall assigns us tasks.

349
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,080
Now it's time for you to do something for us.

350
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,140
Are you afraid to die?

351
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,470
Yuan Village leader, no matter what you're still an elder.

352
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,450
Do you realize what you've said is helping the Demon sect?

353
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,500
You became his accomplice.

354
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,030
Are we his accomplice or

355
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,550
you, Ma Kongqun, is his accomplice?

356
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:36,520
Wu Sec leader, are you inciting a mutiny?

357
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:41,110
You're life is a life but what about us?

358
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,540
Our lives are not lives?

359
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,900
We want to continue to live.

360
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,720
Do you think if I die, you'll be able to live?

361
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,540
If I die, it'll be easier for him to kill you.

362
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,150
My only hope is to save everyone.

363
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,570
If you don't trust me, the door is open.

364
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,210
You're free to leave. I won't stop you.

365
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:14,110
Those that stay can help me find the killer.

366
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,250
If anyone can find the murderer

367
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,620
I will reward him.

368
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:23,630
He can take any one thing he wants from the Ten Thousand Horse Hall.

369
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,350
That includes your precious daughter?

370
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,800
As I said already,

371
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,740
he can take anything he wants from Ten Thousand Horse Hall.

372
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,030
Father.

373
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,650
Is the Ma Big Boss going crazy?

374
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,990
How can he use his daughter as a reward?

375
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:09,690
He's not crazy. Every Central Plain Sect is here.

376
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,410
This incident is not so simple as Heaven Dog killing someone.

377
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,720
The entire Wulin world will see a major shuffle.

378
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:23,170
Now Murong Mingzhu is dead. The contract between the families is automatically nullified.

379
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:28,150
Ma Kongqun can choose another son-in-law.

380
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,440
If Ten Thousand Horse Hall can survive

381
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,640
then isn't this a wonder way to remake the world scene.

382
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,530
Big boss...something bad has happened.

383
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:43,150
Big boss. Fu Hongxue kidnapped the Miss. He's coming this way alone.

384
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,260
Fu Hongxue. What have you done with Miss Cui Nong?

385
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,980
Where is she?

386
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,360
Rest assured. She's safe.

387
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,940
You shouldn't have locked her in the cell where it's very dangerous.

388
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,160
Pull your sword.

389
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,430
Why?

390
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:35,350
Let me see if there is blood on it.

391
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:43,930
You suspect I killed the people and the horses.

392
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,470
Just now, everyone was at the Ten Thousand Horses Hall.

393
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,630
Only you were missing. Of course I suspect you.

394
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,250
Too bad I didn't kill them.

395
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:59,320
I said again. Pull your sword.

396
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:20,450
Stop! You said you're not the murderer.

397
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,100
What evidence do you have?

398
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,470
I don't have any.

399
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,810
Then how can we believe you?

400
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:30,890
I will personally capture the killer and bring him to you.

401
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:38,140
Boss Ma, if I kill the Heaven Dog,

402
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,880
whatever I want at Ten Thousand Hall, I will get.

403
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,260
I give you my word.

404
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,440
I would never thought, Fu Hongxue is such a power grabber.

405
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,910
Nothing wrong to want power.

406
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:06,650
Especially if Ten Thousand Hall has something he wants.

407
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,270
Come with me.

408
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,110
Go in. <br> What for?

409
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:04,190
Leave here. Now they all believe you're Heaven Dog.

410
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:08,060
Given an opportunity, they'll try to kill you. <br> They won't be able to.

411
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,960
Fu Hongxue. Can't you listen to me for once?

412
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,880
I'm not worried about gossips or being blamed,

413
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,110
I just want you to live.

414
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:25,120
Hongxue, I'm really afraid.

415
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,080
What do you fear? <br> I fear losing you.

416
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,780
Even if I can ever marry you,

417
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,410
even if we can't live together until we die,

418
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:39,540
I only want you alive.

419
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,630
Go quickly. <br> I won't leave.

420
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:47,160
I will definitely capture Heaven Dog. Keep yourself safe.

421
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,720
Father.

422
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,000
Young Fu Master. My daughter was frightened.

423
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,860
If she was impolite, please excuse her.

424
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,780
Boss Ma, you're being too polite.

425
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,120
Looks like the incident 14 years ago when fire burned the Demon Sect hasn't concluded.

426
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,700
No only the fire incident 14 year ago hasn't been solved

427
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:24,390
I suspect the murder at Plum Blossom Monastery wasn't solved either.

428
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,420
Fu young master, what thoughts do you have about this?

429
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,100
Same as your thoughts.

430
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,160
Since we have Fu young master stepping forward to help

431
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,500
I'm so much more confident.

432
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,530
If I capture the Heaven Dog,

433
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,070
don't forget your promise.

434
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,290
I keep my promises.

435
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,790
Ling'er. Fu young master is right.

436
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,300
This most important thing now is self protection.

437
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,990
Don't worry about anything else.

438
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:59,260
Ten Thousand Horses Hall has many capable fighter plus the help of Fu young master.

439
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,120
I'm confident the villain will not succeed.

440
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,900
Since there is nothing else. Ling'er you should go rest in your room.

441
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,010
Feng Mantian. <br> Here.

442
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,710
Accompany the Miss to her room.

443
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,210
Miss. This way.

444
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,430
Fu Hongxue.

445
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:41,300
I always thought you have no interest in other's business.

446
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,670
Never thought you can be so considerate.

447
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,880
Why do you want to capture Heaven Dog?

448
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,250
My guess is...this has something to do with you.

449
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:54,260
You're overthinking. I only want to help.

450
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,950
Lately I keep thinking about one thing that relates to you.

451
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,400
I know your mother is Demon Sect's oldest princess, Hua Beifeng.

452
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,930
Who is your father? Bai Tianyu.

453
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,180
Not a bad guess, hum?

454
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,150
Why do you look for trouble?

455
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,270
Because I like trouble. Fu Hongxue.

456
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,750
To be friends, you shouldn't try to hide or keep everything in.

457
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,970
If there is a need, I can help you.

458
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,460
I don't need it. <br> You need it.

459
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,790
You only have 2 ways when facing this type of situation.

460
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,650
One is anger. The other is endure.

461
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:27,310
With only these two methods you won't be able to manage.

462
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,130
Ye Kai. What do you plan to do?

463
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,370
As rumor has it, Heaven Dog killed your father 12 years ago.

464
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:36,410
You must find Heaven Dog. Let's work together.

465
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,930
This is my own business.

466
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,520
Fu Hongxue. Ten Thousand Horses Hall is the center of public criticism.

467
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,360
Don't be the boat for arrow practice <i> (scapegoat).</i>

468
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,580
Life is our own.

469
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,020
That's where you are. I finally found you.

470
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,840
Fu Hongxue. Everyone wants to kill you.

471
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,110
I must keep a good eye on you

472
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:59,440
otherwise the tasty morsel will get stolen.

473
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,030
Look, Fu Honxue. I also have a boat.

474
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,440
It's large and steady. On board there are friends.

475
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,010
Why not come aboard?

476
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,230
I hope next time we meet,

477
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,220
you haven't drowned.

478
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,720
This Fu Hongxue is strange.

479
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,920
What is he thinking?

480
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,440
Don't worry needlessly. What about the task I gave you?

481
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,160
I asked around. Murong Mingzu's body

482
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,190
is placed in Zewei Court. Only one watchman. No one will block us.

483
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,020
Fine. You go look for Murong family's idiot swordsman.

484
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,080
I'm going to reminisce the past with Murong young master.

485
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,680
What? What do you have to say to a dead person?

486
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,920
Sometimes, the dead can talk.

487
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,460
Don't scare me. No way.

488
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,520
What Brother Ye meant is no matter how clever a murderer is

489
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,020
he'll leave some traces when killing a person.

490
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,760
If we find the traces, then we'll discover some clues.

491
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,500
Then it's like dead talking to us.

492
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,400
I think you're more enthusiastic talking to the dead than to me.

493
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,270
Why is there a fire?

494
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,760
Who's so unfortunate? Where is that?

495
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,500
Oh.Isn't that where Murong Mingzue is placed, Zewei Court?

496
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,350
Help with the fire. Get water quick!

497
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:36,920
Help with the fire. Get water quick!

498
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,650
How did it catch fire?

499
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:44,020
We don't know. Help with the fire.

500
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,410
Quick.

501
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,720
Oh no. The information must have leaked out.

502
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,760
The killer wants to destroy the evidence.

503
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,260
Now what? He's a step ahead of us.

504
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,830
At least our suspicion is validated. They came to burn Murong Mingzu's body

505
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:02,810
means there is something we want on those bodies.

506
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,720
Now the killer knows we're investigating.

507
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,530
I suspect he'll want to kill us too.

508
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:12,170
Come get us.

509
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,420
I must see this to the end.

510
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,850
That's right. Let's go.

511
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,540
Quick. This way. Quick.

512
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,060
What are you doing?

513
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,640
Where are you going?

514
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,510
Do I need to tell you where I'm going?

515
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,130
Did you set the fire over there?

516
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,650
No.

517
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,290
What do you want?

518
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:55,490
Perfect. I also want to look over there. Let's go together.

519
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,140
Then you go. I'm not interested.

520
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,490
Fu Hongxue. You wait.

521
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:06,110
I will definitely find the evidence. You're not to leave here alive.

522
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,680
Mother.

523
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,830
Who is this woman?

524
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,800
She doesn't appear to be a commoner.

525
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,430
Fu Hongxue actually called her mother. She must belong to the Demon Sect.

526
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,710
She appears to be very competent.

527
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,930
Looks like things are progressing well.

528
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,550
I did as you instructed.

529
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,560
However on the wedding day, someone disguised as Heaven Dog suddenly appeared.

530
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,060
Heaven Dog?

531
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,220
Yes. He's killed many people.

532
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,260
Now the Ten Thousand Horses Hall is in chaos.

533
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,950
Everyone is afraid the next victim will be them.

534
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,140
What about Ma Kongqun?

535
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,360
Ma Kongqun is also struggling.

536
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,220
Just punishment. Ten Thousand Horses Hall's just punishment.

537
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:47,300
