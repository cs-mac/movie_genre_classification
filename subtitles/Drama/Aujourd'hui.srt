<i>♫ Lonely, lively, or in an ordinary city. ♫</i>

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,220
<i>♫ A gust of wind, a surge of rain, a familiar melody. ♫</i>

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,970
<i>♫ Helpless, proud, or in an insignificant corner. ♫</i>

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,810
<i>♫ How many details, how many scenes, how many clear memories? ♫</i>

6
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,040
<i>♫ Traveling free, no restraints, or devoting myself to missing you. ♫</i>

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,920
<i>♫ When I meet you again, when we reunite again, when I can see your pretty self again. ♫</i>

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,620
<i>♫ Eternal or ephemeral, the two sides to life. ♫</i>

9

<i>♫ I want you to hear and see it all. ♫</i>

Associate Editor.

20
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,910
How are arrangements for the poster going?

21
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,190
CC Allen already contacted us earlier.

22
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,930
They didn't give us a reason why they haven't been responding to us before.

23
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,930
In any case, they just rejected our interview now.

24
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,680
And they also said they'd never accept an interview from Immortal again.

25
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,410
I got it.

26
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,300
How is the progress with Taylor Young?

27
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,710
I will hold a meeting with his agent in the afternoon. I will do my best to convince him to accept our request.

28
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,290
Before they reply, we can't also just waste our time waiting.

29
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,590
Huizhen and I will prepare a backup contact list

30
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,960
to contact at any time.

31
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,540
Okay. Let's do it that way then.

32
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,940
I already sent you our plan.

33
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,850
We are very confident in this interview.

34
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,970
We believe we can give readers a fresh feeling.

35
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,150
We can discuss the details together.

36
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,150
We are completely sincere.

37
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,230
I know already. Regarding the details of the interview, we will follow it up more closely. As for the others, we will do our best.

38
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,750
Okay. Okay. We will base our pictorial shoot time based on your schedule.

39
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,970
Okay, you can contact me once you are sure of the time. Goodbye.

40
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,760
Huizhen, how are things with you?

41
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,570
Not one can be contacted. This won't do.

42
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,650
Hello, I am Lin Yimu. Yes, I know.

43
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,110
Hello?

44
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,250
Because the one that contacted you before wasn't me, so I'm not sure about the details.

45
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,000
That's right. It won't work?

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,050
Ah, okay. Okay, okay.

47
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,370
Goodbye, thank you.

48
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,840
The models took on other jobs. No one has time.

Associate Editor Bai,

52
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,660
do you still remember what you told me the first time you went to my office?

53
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,190
<i> Please give me full control.</i>

54
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,050
<i>No mater what happens, you must stand on my side.</i>

55
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,430
<i>No matter what I do, you must support me.</i>

56
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,560
In the end, I watched you

57
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,730
anger everyone away.

58
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,630
We are family.

59
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,440
Mr. Bai,

60
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,360
I'm not just Immortal Magazine's Editor-In-Chief.

61
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,080
I am the parent of everyone here.

62
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,300
So tell me the truth.

63
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,840
Did you really request the market assessment?

64
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,260
No. Headquarters did it.

65
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,090
I refused many times, but it was useless.

66
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,850
Then why didn't you explain yourself?

67
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:11,630
Or do you really think that this is a good chance for everyone to find another path?

68
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,210
You're willing to take the blame, but I'm not.

69
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,460
My little flowers, even if they want to find a different job,

70
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,220
they cannot leave with regret and hate.

71
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,230
I know.

72
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:37,210
You must be thinking that you're doing this for their good.

73
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,550
But this isn't the way you should treat family.

74
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,490
If you don't have the courage to clarify this misunderstanding,

75
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,160
then you can only leave it to me.

76
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,940
Let me think about it.

77
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,300
Fine. Just think about it.

78
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,620
You have to let everyone else understand your heart, too.

79
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,400
<i>I worked at Immortal for thirteen years.</i>

80
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,800
<i>Letting me see this, it makes me feel like my thirteen years were a joke!</i>

81
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,910
<i>I wasn't this disrespected even as a trainee, did you know?</i>

82
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,690
<i>Is there not a single person worth you keeping?</i>

83
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,280
You're finished with work?

84
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,130
Why haven't you left yet?

85
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,160
I'm waiting for you!

86
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,730
Waiting for me?

87
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,220
Huizhen, I'm too tired today. I can't eat dinner with you.

88
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,810
Who said I wanted to eat dinner with you? Give me the keys.

89
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,640
I'm going to drive you home.

90
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,060
Then you can rest in the car.

91
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,370
-Huizhen--<br>-I know.

92
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,220
I know if anything happens, I can't help you.

93
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,660
Because of my position and my experience,

94
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,630
besides making some calls and doing some research,

95
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,130
there's really nothing I can do.

96
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,070
But I thought about it. I can spend time with you!

97
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,660
No matter when you need me,

98
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,930
as long as I can do it, I will do it.

99
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,990
Huizhen, you're so good to me.

100
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,390
It's enough to have you.

101
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:01,130
Aiya, let go. We're at the company! Someone's going to see!

102
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:06,120
Um... In any case, no matter what happens,

103
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,350
let's take them on together, okay?

104
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,900
Come on, let's go. Someone is going to see us!

105
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,570
-Morning, Huizhen.<br>-Oh, good morning, Yimu.

106
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:35,010
I feel tired just thinking about the work to do today.

107
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,830
I can't find any energy at all.

108
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,180
-Morning.<br>-Morning.

109
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,710
Morning.

110
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,570
Until now, there's still no progress.

111
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,220
Yes.

112
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,860
-Did you eat breakfast?<br>-No, did you?

113
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,460
I ate three buns.

114
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,660
You can eat that well?

115
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,510
Husheng!

116
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,250
Go and borrow all the clothes that are in this plan.

117
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,910
You all...

118
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,150
<i>Brother Lin Hao!</i>

119
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,830
<i>You're back!</i>

120
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,460
<i>Meili!</i>

121
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,030
<i>Sister Anna! Sister Yaling!</i>

122
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,000
Sister Yaling!

123
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,440
Sister Zhu Ying!

124
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,050
Sister Zhu Ying, you're back! I missed you so much!

125
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,030
Of course, I had to come back.

126
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,340
I worked here for so many years.

127
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,310
No matter what happens in the future, I can't let go so easily.

128
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,660
Honestly!

129
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,530
Don't cry. You're an adult.

130
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,250
Who said I cried? I held it in!

131
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,660
I'm a lot stronger now!

132
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,030
Yes, even if you're strong I can't leave you here alone.

133
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,620
I thought none of you would return!

134
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,720
Associate Editor!

135
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,370
Associate Editor! Look, everyone came back!

136
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,290
Good morning, Associate Editor!

137
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,750
Morning. Meeting in 20 minutes!

138
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,000
To be honest, if I don't hear this voice,

139
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,830
I wouldn't be used to it!

140
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,940
Hello? I am Bai Haoyu.

141
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,800
Okay. I got it.

142
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,160
It was a call from Taylor Young's manager.

143
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,320
Our interview request...

144
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,860
they've agreed to it.

145
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,550
<i>Reportedly, every misfortune that we've encountered now</i>

146
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,700
<i>will have a corresponding good fortune waiting for us in the future.</i>

147
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,790
<i>He encouraged us to not give up easily.</i>

148
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,040
<i>We must last until the end.</i>

149
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,760
Cheers!

150
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,710
This is wonderful! We've made it through another obstacle!

151
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,700
That's right. Our main topic already chose to be interviewed.

152
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,050
This is amazing!

153
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,360
I suddenly feel very moved!

154
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,570
It's too great to be able to work at Immortal!

155
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:23,100
That's right! I saw our views go up! It's too exciting!

156
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,360
We've really done it! And this feeling is awesome!

157
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,580
No matter how awesome the feeling is, don't get addicted to it.

158
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,280
There's still a difference with New Look, but we can definitely be number one with the next issue.

159
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,610
Of course. Didn't you see?

160
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,890
What is that thing fluttering in the wind? It's our victory flag.

161
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,780
There's a lot of things that I thought were impossible,

162
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,500
but Associate Editor Bai still managed to do it!

163
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,140
I'm impressed.

164
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,130
Hey, talking about that, how come all of you came at the same time? Did you guys talk about this beforehand?

165
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,830
Mm.

166
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,850
It's nothing. I don't really want to say...

167
00:11:54,850 --> 00:12:00,760
I was afraid that you all had some other reasons. I... I really didn't want to come back anymore.

168
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,180
Old Bai personally came to find me and begged me while crying.

169
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,010
I really... don't want to... embarrass him.

170
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,080
Me, too. He waited for hours in front of my house.

171
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,330
Me, too.

172
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,680
Everyone was all personally visited at your house by Associate Editor

173
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,960
and then he personally asked everyone to come back?

174
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,220
Yes. He even personally came to my house and promised

175
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,210
that if we still fail this time,

176
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:33,990
that he will help me get at least 3 months of separation pay as my compensation.

177
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,560
Really?

178
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,210
So I wasn't that special? I thought I was very special!

179
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:45,080
Special?! I'm sure that for this matter, you think that you're the most special!

180
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,630
I'm very thankful Associate Editor Bai drew us together.

181
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,100
Everyone, I like being with you all.

182
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,880
I believe that being with you all, we can again get the number one spot

183
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,030
and get back our champion throne!

184
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,640
-Do you have faith?<br>-Yes!

185
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,860
For our Immortal!

186
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,260
One, two, three! Go!

187
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,350
Meili, are you coming with me?

188
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,900
Who wants to take my car?

189
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,840
- I'll take her car instead.<br>- Okay then.

190
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,250
Bye-bye!

191
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,340
Stay safe on the road!

192
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,590
Bye-bye!

193
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,840
-Bye-bye!<br>-Bye-bye!

194
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,290
Let's go.

195
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,380
I can go alone.

196
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,330
Why are you avoiding me lately?

197
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,260
I'm not.

198
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,090
And you say you you're not?

199
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:42,270
You don't pick up my calls or respond to my texts. Is that not avoiding?

200
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,340
I...

201
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,550
Xiao Xue, did I anger you?

202
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,600
No.

203
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,760
Did I do anything wrong?

204
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,310
No.

205
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,070
Then why?

206
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,640
It's...

207
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:06,000
I just haven't thought it through. In any case, it's my own reasoning.

208
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,720
I'm going home.

209
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,980
-I'll take you!<br>-There's no need, I can go alone.

210
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,380
No, it's too late. It's not safe for you to go alone.

211
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,370
I said I can go alone!

212
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,280
I'm sorry, Husheng.

213
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,260
Give me some time to think it over.

214
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,690
I'm going.

215
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,590
Xiao Xue!

216
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,550
Zhen'er! Come, come, let me tell you!

217
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,520
Earlier, I accidentally clicked on that live broadcast of Mogujie

218
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,010
and then I opened a broadcast account

219
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,170
and then a lot of people are sending me flowers and stuff!

220
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,970
There's presents to send, too!

221
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:01,090
And there's people asking me how I keep my skin so good!

222
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,390
It's interesting!

223
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,750
So amazing?

224
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,110
Wow, how amazing! Qiao'er, you can run your own channel!

225
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,240
What own channel? I just happened

226
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,150
to take a little look. I didn't think it ended up being live.

227
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,990
Then give it a try.

228
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,110
You can teach people to do makeup.

229
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,860
No matter if it's male or female, they'll watch your live show.

230
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,190
Because you are beautiful so you attract boys.

231
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,870
And then you also teach others to do make-up so you attract girls, too.

232
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,420
Then won't you become famous this way? Right?

233
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,680
A famous person?

234
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,640
Forget it... I'm not ready to be famous.

235
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,590
Fine, hurry and get to work; don't talk nonsense.

236
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,900
I prepared bread for your breakfast. It's over there.

237
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,160
This thing is quite interesting.

238
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,510
The coffee is here!

239
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,530
-Thank you!<br>-Come help me!

240
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,960
Coming, coming!

241
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,900
<i>- Hey, whose without sugar is this?<br>- Mine. Mine.</i>

242
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,320
<i>- Oh, thank you.<br></i>- No sugar.<br>- Then give it to me.

243
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,370
- For your dieting.<br>- Thank you.

244
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,540
Come, come, come.

245
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,490
-Brother Lin Hao.<br>-Oh, thank you.

246
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,830
Who else doesn't have one?

247
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,120
You're not going to drink it?

248
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,960
It's okay, I already had some.

249
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,020
Come and take a look! Diviner really is Chinese!

250
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,140
I wasn't wrong, right?

251
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,110
That's right. Let's look at Weibo. Right now, all the trending topics at Weibo are about that.

252
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,590
Diviner is Chinese!

253
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,200
I heard that Diviner put it on Weibo,

254
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,740
and then... all his fans just directly left messages for him asking him about it.

255
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,880
"Are you Chinese?" and then Diviner answered,

256
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,180
"Yes. I am Chinese!"

257
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,510
Ah... a fire is ignited.

258
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,990
<i>This... This...</i>

259
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,200
♫ In the far east side there is a dragon ♫

260
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,120
♫ His name is called Diviner! ♫

261
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,410
<i>I'm so excited.</i>

262
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,990
Come, come, come!

263
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,560
Cheers!

264
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,330
Xiao Xue, you're here?

265
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,430
Oh.

266
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,300
- You're arranging make up stuff?<br>- I'm almost done. I'll get out first.

267
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,170
Xiao Xue!

268
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,140
It's okay, I'll do it.

269
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,360
-Are you okay?<br>-I'm okay.

270
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,900
<i>What should I do? If it's not Husheng,</i>

271
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,110
<i>then it's Lin Hao or Lin Yimu.</i>

272
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,140
<i>Do I really have to choose one between the two of them?</i>

273
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,590
<i>No, no! What is this?</i>

274
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,580
Do you need it, too?

275
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,680
-Here.<br>-What are you doing? I don't want it!

276
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,200
Then why are you staring at me?

277
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,600
If you like it, then I'll give it to you. Do you like the electric one or the manual one?

278
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,850
-I have both. Take your pick.<br>-I don't want it!

279
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,340
Let me look at your nose hairs.

280
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,870
What are you doing? You're awful!

281
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,700
Associate Editor Bai, you're working on the weekend? You've worked hard.

282
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,390
-You guys often work overtime. You're worked hard, too.<br>-That's what we should do.

283
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,730
Stop writing, hurry and come eat!

284
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,370
You prepared so much for me? I can't eat all that.

285
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,080
You have to eat more to have the strength to work.

286
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,980
It's still hot right now, come and eat.

287
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,620
Eat with me.

288
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:09,010
Me? I'm not going to eat. I'll interrupt your work if I eat now.

289
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,010
That won't happen. Let's eat together.

290
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,260
-Let's go.<br>-I really won't eat, I still have other things to do.

291
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,440
If we eat together and then everyone sees-

292
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,090
What are you doing?

293
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,600
Guess.

294
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,430
I wouldn't have wasted your time if I knew this, and I especially called you out for food, too.

295
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,650
I need time to rest, too. You can't let me die from overexhaustion.

296
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,490
Then give it a try!

297
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,620
How fragrant!

298
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,200
It doesn't taste good?

299
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,690
Is it too salty? I was in a rush so I didn't really bother to try,

300
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,530
I just-! I just put it out, it might be a bit salty.

301
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,340
Does it not match your tastes?

302
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,300
It's too delicious!

303
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,400
Li Huizhen, why is your cooking so delicious?

304
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,270
It's the first time I came over here. It has such nice scenery.

305
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,720
There's actually such a place in the city.

306
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,290
Yes. I didn't know in the past.

307
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,140
Then I'll take you for a walk later.

308
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,100
Okay! Take this back with you to eat.

309
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,130
I'll take it back first. Wait for me.

310
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,590
Okay!

311
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,680
When I was waiting for you over there,

312
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,270
looking at the scenery in front of me,

313
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:04,870
and looking at the people around me, I suddenly noticed

314
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:11,090
that there is some scenery that will only become meaningful if you look at it with the right person.

315
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,460
Then did you find the right person for you yet?

316
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,910
What do you think?

317
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,620
You should say some things. It's so awkward.

318
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,270
I'm shy.

319
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,990
Wow, it's so beautiful looking out from here!

320
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,520
I didn't see this from downstairs.

321
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,200
So the scenery is even more beautiful up here!

322
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,500
It turns out there's so much scenery I haven't seen before.

323
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,530
Do you think it's amazing?

324
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,490
Sometimes, there's some scenery

325
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,240
that we have to personally see. Even though

326
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,600
it's different looking through pictures and movies,

327
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,710
but it's so different when you look at it yourself!

328
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,040
Right?

329
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:08,410
Wow, the wind is too big!

330
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:13,190
My god! My hair is a mess!

331
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,990
It looks awful, right?

332
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,970
It looks wonderful.

333
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,010
As long as it doesn't rain it's good.

334
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,780
-My hair is blown all-<br>-Huizhen.

335
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,480
Yes?

336
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,270
Marry me.

337
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:37,360
Let's get married. I'll let you see all the scenery you want to see.

338
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,210
The meaning of this city to me is your existence.

339
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,210
I don't want to separate from you again.

340
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,410
You don't need to respond to me now.

341
00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:01,380
I'll wait. If I can successfully publish the 20th anniversary issue,

342
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,920
when that happens,

343
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:14,080
as long as you are willing, we'll be together forever. We won't be separated for even a moment.

344
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,310
I will definitely succeed.

345
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,430
When that happens, then give me your answer.

346
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,960
We've been separated for 12 years.

347
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,290
It's been 12 years.

348
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,960
I missed you every day.

349
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,020
Now, I have finally found you.

350
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,450
I won't let you leave me again.

351
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:54,270
Every time I see you with your family, I always think,

352
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,970
if I can become part of your group, that would be wonderful.

353
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:04,230
I'm so happy when I'm with you all.

354
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,240
Huizhen,

355
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,170
let's never separate.

356
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,340
Then you must work hard. You must succeed.

357
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,480
Because I want to smoothly marry the one I like.

358
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,430
I want to be with him forever, too.

359
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,140
I've never been so certain of something before.

360
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,750
But to you, I'm sure.

361
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,240
I want to be with you. Let's never be separated again.

362
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,630
Are you willing?

363
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,700
Of course, little fatty Yu! Little fatty Yu!

364
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,250
Your face isn't fat anymore, look!

365
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:33,960
<i>Perhaps the happiness I feel now,</i>

366
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,470
<i>will attract some future unhappiness.</i>

367
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,850
<i>[Taylor Young's manager]</i>

368
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:58,200
September 11th, 4 p.m.

369
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,810
Okay, I know that place. Then, see you then.

370
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,900
<i>Okay! Yimu?</i>

371
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,040
<i>Is your magazine company still okay?</i>

372
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,000
It's pretty good. What about it?

373
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,190
<i>I remember that you previously mentioned that you guys are interviewing Taylor Young.</i>

374
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,360
Yes. So?

375
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,430
<i>You didn't hear the rumors?</i>

376
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,060
Rumors?

377
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,650
<i> Hello, I am Taylor Young's manager.</i>

378
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,530
<i>The original plan to accept Immortal's interview request</i>

379
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,760
<i>must be dismissed due to some reasons. I'm sorry.</i>

380
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,800
Hello, I just saw your news.

381
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,560
What happened?

382
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,480
<i>The fight between Taylor Young and that male singer is about to enter the legal stage.</i>

383
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,990
<i>You didn't know about it?</i>

384
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:04,260
<i>Under these sensitive circumstances, no interviews will be accepted.</i>

385
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:12,260
How is it? Did you check with them? What did they say?

386
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,660
They've already rejected us.

387
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,670
What?

388
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,560
The interview is gone, too.

389
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,960
But... why did it have to happen now?

390
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,320
There's no hope.

391
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:43,330
We have to say goodbye to the champion position.

392
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,810
Which means that we can't really interview her?

393
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,340
But we intended to do the interview in these few days!

394
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,770
What are we going to do at the spur of the moment?

395
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,700
Our main star for December, the details of the interview,

396
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,430
what can we use to replace it?

397
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:59,810
If we can't become #1 this time, are we going to be shut down?

398
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:04,000
After using so much effort and time, I thought we would have a big interview.

399
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,600
But in the end, we couldn't even find a person.

400
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,500
It's useless to moan about it now.

401
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,620
If Taylor Young really won't do, then we have to hurry and pick a backup.

402
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,880
Hey, is Lucy Liu, the person who's super famous now in Hollywood, alright?

403
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,520
I contacted them before, but because

404
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,900
she's overseas right now, she cannot work with our timeline.

405
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,690
How about Zhao Dian? The youngest designer in New York Fashion Week.

406
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,920
I thought about him long ago. But he's not very famous.

407
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,290
But no matter who it is, we can't just invite them because we want to now.

408
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,340
We found it so hard to choose Taylor Young before.

409
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,160
If we choose another person now, who would agree to it?

410
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,460
Really great. We can't invite Taylor Young. New Look's Laimu Sisters are hopeless now.

411
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,090
Right now...we have already become cannon fodder (nothing).

412
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,380
If we want to beat the deadline for printing, the latest we must finish all the photoshoots

413
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,020
is by next week.

414
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:04,820
But we don't even have a finished interview right now! What do we do?

415
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,430
If we can't find someone else,

416
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,650
we still cannot

417
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:14,080
publish a 20th anniversary issue without content.

418
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,400
We're done for. This is our fate. We're all going to lose our jobs.

419
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,660
<i>[Memory]</i>

420
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,600
If it was Diviner?

421
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,650
He's a world famous author.

422
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,130
He also just admitted on Weibo that he is Chinese.

423
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:39,590
If we can get his exclusive interview, the magazine's sales will definitely rise.

424
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:44,830
Wait. Associate Editor, you're saying "if," but the process is a bit difficult.

425
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,210
Diviner hides himself so well.

426
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:51,910
Even if we can find him, would he accept our interview?

427
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,590
What if it is just a one-page interview?

428
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,070
A special person like Diviner,

429
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:01,240
even if it is just a one page interview without any pictures on it,

430
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,570
that is enough to rise above other magazines' front page titles.

431
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:08,210
If he really agrees to it, getting the number one spot really won't be a problem!

432
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,580
But... he won't possibly agree to it.

433
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,640
No matter what, I'll investigate through the magazine first.

434
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,090
At the same time, prepare a possible backup list.

435
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,550
How about this? Everyone give me their backup lists.

436
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,880
I'll give it to you after I go through them.

437
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,370
There's little time, you understand.

438
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,410
Hurry!

439
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,460
Diviner?

440
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:41,750
Oh my gosh! I'm his #1 fan!

441
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:46,190
Associate Editor Bai has a great eye.

442
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:51,200
If Diviner successfully accepts our interview,

443
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,730
then that would be so wonderful!

444
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,670
It's too exciting!

445
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:07,250
Actually, we only just found out that he is Chinese.

446
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:10,090
How does your company usually contact him?

447
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,470
We contact him through his agent.

448
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:17,870
Every time, the agent gives us the manuscript. We're just in charge

449
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:23,130
of translating and then publishing it. We're not sure about the rest.

450
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:26,290
Then, can you give me his email?

451
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,500
This...

452
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,860
We just want to request an interview from him.

453
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,880
Then I'll tell him for you.

454
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,890
Diviner really gives much importance on his private life.

455
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:39,660
If I told you the email, I'm afraid it'll affect our partnership.

456
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
Okay. Then I'll have to trouble you.

457
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,760
As for if he'll respond or not, I'm not sure.

458
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,620
I got it. Thank you.

459
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,620
Help me check if the Editing Department's package was received.

460
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,030
Okay.

461
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,640
-I'm sorry, there's no such package.<br>-Huizhen?

462
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,130
What did the publishing company say?

463
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:06,200
The chance of success is low. We can only wait now.

464
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,780
What are you looking at?

465
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:21,420
Didn't you say you'll have strength if you look at me? I'll give you 100 seconds to look today.

466
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:28,000
Look! One, two, three, four...

467
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:35,250
Don't worry, everything will be resolved.

468
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,200
The 20th anniversary issue will definitely be successfully published.

469
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,480
Of course!

470
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,480
You didn't even look who wrote most of the articles in it. Those were my first works.

471
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,040
Continue looking! One, two...

472
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,370
Wait! Are we going to be late for work?

473
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,000
-Hurry!<br>-Let's go.

474
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,610
Stop for a moment.

475
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,540
I'm going to announce an important HR appointment.

476
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,340
The company sent us a new manager.

477
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,750
They say it's our crown prince who just came back from studying abroad.

478
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,770
He's in charge of publishing and editing. He is also our future boss.

479
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,470
Why? Crown prince? That's too sudden.

480
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,260
That's right...

481
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,690
- So there's even such a thing?<br>- Does he even understand us?

482
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,740
He comes in through connections at this time? And it's a young brat, too?

483
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,190
That'll create trouble!

484
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,030
But if we think about it, that might not happen.

485
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,140
The CEO's son, the crown prince.

486
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,560
That also means he's our Editor-In-Chief's nephew.

487
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,730
Then perhaps, we can use that connection

488
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,680
to help our Editing Department.

489
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,650
That won't do. He's the newly arrived crown prince...

490
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:44,650
We should make sales rise ourselves.

491
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:48,770
I... I feel that being a web star really makes you really popular. How about us creating two web stars?

492
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,810
Lin Hao!

493
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,250
I think that you have the looks to be a web star.

494
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:01,120
How weird is he? How unique is he?

495
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,710
Not having any lower limits at all. We are an international magazine, okay?!

496
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,980
I was joking!

497
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:12,770
If you can really make me a web star is not bad, too. I think that I'm okay for it.

498
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,920
- There's no such kind yet.<br>- Go back to work already.

499
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,780
<i>- What if I got famous, then we...<br></i>- Let's go back to work.

500
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,660
They have no taste!

501
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,230
<i>Diviner still hasn't responded to me.</i>

502
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,510
<i>It seems like he hasn't even looked at his email,</i>

503
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,710
<i>so you should give up.</i>

504
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,710
<i>He cares a lot about his secrecy.</i>

505
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,420
<i>There's nothing we can do.</i>

506
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,540
Okay, thank you.

507
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,490
If there's any news, please tell me.

508
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,590
Yes, yes, yes, I'm sorry.

509
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,970
Wait one more day for us, okay?

510
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,810
I'll tell you once there's news.

511
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,460
Hello? Okay, I'm sorry.

512
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,650
Please wait a second.

513
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,700
-Bye-bye.<br>-Hello? Ah, hello.

514
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,350
Teacher Li, yes, I'll tell you once there's news!

515
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,500
-Representative?<br>-I'm very sorry.

516
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,090
<i>- Sister Zhu Ying<br>- Okay, we will inform you right away.</i>

517
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,330
The Art Design Department is calling. What do we do?

518
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:13,140
Drag it out! Think of a way to drag things out!

519
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,230
Sister Zhu Ying, the ads...

520
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,610
They also called me, too. Tell them to wait.

521
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,250
-There's nothing we can do right now, just tell them to wait!<br>-Okay, okay.

522
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,520
Sister Zhu Ying, I also can't be sure about the matter I'm handling. They say that they can't do anything.

523
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,590
Yimu, you know the situation, right?

524
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,570
No one panic right now. Let's just wait, okay?

525
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,250
<i>Drag it out.</i>

526
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,700
While we still haven't any confirmation, don't put it yet. It still can't be printed yet.

527
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,550
Everyone has worked hard.

528
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:42,670
Let's stop here today. Go back and rest.

529
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,160
But Associate Editor, everyone is waiting for the final check.

530
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,030
The Ad Department and Art Design Department are already rushing us.

531
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,710
Leave that to me.

532
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,950
I will talk to them.

533
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:59,390
Everyone go back first to rest today. Tomorrow morning, we'll be having a general assembly.

534
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,500
It's been so many years.

535
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,870
This is the first time I got off work in the middle of the day.

536
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,640
What is Associate Editor thinking?

537
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,390
What do you mean?

538
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:24,390
Instead of suffering here, why not go back and relax?

539
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,630
That's definitely what he thinks.

540
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:33,350
But... what if the magazine shuts down, what will Associate Editor do?

541
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,490
Does he have a backup?

542
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,520
This industry is so small. If he leaves in failure,

543
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,670
no matter where he goes, he won't get good treatment.

544
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:45,530
If it's like this, he should still go back. If this all ends,

545
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,520
there's no need for him to stay in China.

546
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,110
Dad, why have you come?

547
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:22,720
I came to see you. Let's have dinner.

548
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,830
There's no need. I bought food.

549
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,950
How can you eat this?

550
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:36,810
Look at how skinny you are. Let's go out to eat.

551
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,880
Dad, there's no need. I can just eat this.

552
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,670
How about this? If you don't want to go out, I'll cook.

553
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:47,410
I'll go buy groceries. Wait for me!

554
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:52,240
Dad! There's really no need.

555
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,520
Listen to me. The market is just nearby, I saw it already.

556
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,700
I'll come back soon. Wait for me.

557
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:11,080
I heard from your mom that you refused to go to France with her?

558
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,170
And you resigned from the hotel?

559
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:19,650
Yes. I want to reconsider my life's direction before I turn 30.

560
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:24,130
Isn't it quite nice to work at the hotel? You became the Best Employee, right?

561
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,130
How did you know about that?

562
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,560
It was your mom.

563
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,930
Luo Meili. Doesn't she use the spa at your hotel?

564
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,110
She saw the poster.

565
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:40,020
She was so happy and kept showing me the picture.

566
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,830
She also bragged to her friends.

567
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,390
Is that so? She has a lot of free time.

568
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:52,670
She still has time to be concerned about me.

569
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:57,240
Actually, she's always cared a lot about you.

570
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,850
She just doesn't know how to communicate with children.

571
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,480
You've never liked her either.

572
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,240
So, she doesn't know what to do even more.

573
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,140
If she's nicer to you, she's afraid you'll say she's doing it on purpose.

574
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,050
If she keeps her distance, she's afraid you'll say she doesn't care.

575
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,410
It's not very easy.

576
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,380
Both of you take a step back, okay?

577
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,460
Why do I-?

578
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,220
I'm begging you as a father.

579
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,830
Okay, I got it.

580
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:49,910
She's calling just as we talk about her!

581
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,640
Hello? I arrived.

582
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,850
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.

583
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:02,650
Yes, yes, I'm with Qiao Qiao. I haven't seen her in a long time.

584
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,790
Okay, okay, I'll tell her.

585
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:08,460
Okay, have fun. Stay safe.

586
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:15,780
She went on vacation to America. She told me to ask after you.

587
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:21,620
She said to tell her if you need anything. She'll bring it for you.

588
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:26,140
She really hopes that you can accept her.

589
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:36,080
Do you need help finding a job? Do you have enough money?

590
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:43,620
Dad, I want to depend on myself this time.

591
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,190
I don't want to depend on family too much.

592
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:49,080
That's good, too. Just don't make yourself suffer too much.

593
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:53,500
Even for a normal person, relying on one's family for food and shelter is also no big deal.

594
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,120
Thank you.

595
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:01,120
Thank you, Dad. I know you're good to me.

596
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:07,300
Don't force yourself. Tell me if you need anything, okay?

597
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,540
That's right. Thank Huizhen for me.

598
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:15,780
I have to trouble her to take care of you while you're unemployed.

599
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:19,090
Don't worry, I will.

600
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:22,140
Okay then. I'll finish cooking it for you right away.

601
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:45,470
Dad, if you have time, let's eat dinner together. The three of us.

602
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:50,140
Okay! I'll arrange the time.

603
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,410
<i>[Fatty Yu! Come out and play!]</i>

604
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,850
<i>[I'm busy working.]</i>

605
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:17,770
<i>[Hehe, you're afraid you'll lose to me, right?]</i>

606
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,390
You're challenging me?

607
