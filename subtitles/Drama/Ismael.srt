1
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,731
Earphones?

2
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,042
- Are you alone?
- My mom's in the washroom.

3
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,004
Can I have a pair for her?

4
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,641
- Earphones?
- Yes, please.

5
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,762
Earphones?

6
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,450
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
next station: Barcelona sanka.</i>

7
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,927
<i>Renie thanks you
for using our services</i>

8
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,521
<i>and hopes to see you
on board again soon.</i>

9
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,121
<i>Please do not forget
any personal items.</i>

10
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,007
Have the ﬂowers arrived?

11
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,531
Leyre, I told you to call first thing.

12
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,440
Tell the sommellier to move his ass

13
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,241
or I won't call him
for the next wedding.

14
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,328
I'll leave the papers for the bank.

15
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,126
Really! I can't be away
for even one morning.

16
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,842
Have they arrived?

17
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,088
Why haven't you called?
Hang up and call right now.

18
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,608
I don't want to buy anything
or donate anything.

19
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,406
Does Felix ambrés live here?

20
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,923
- There's no one here with that name.
- It says here that there is.

21
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,480
- Why are you looking for him?
- I want to see him.

22
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,644
- Yes, but why?
- Does he live here or not?

23
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,800
First tell me why you want to see him.

24
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,081
He's my father.

25
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,841
Then you've got the wrong ambrés.

26
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,528
I seem to remember
that the ambrés who lived here

27
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,051
is very young and white.

28
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,041
Hey! That's my letter! Give it back!

29
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,571
Hey! Hey!

30
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,285
This is félix ambrés,

31
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,321
my son.

32
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,766
<i>Neh-br</i>

33
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,161
may I continue?

34
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,604
Thank you.
Chino, your cell. Thank you.

35
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,402
The idea is that the volunteers
talk about their lives.

36
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,682
- What for?
- To record them.

37
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,129
One of the project's aims
is historical.

38
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,490
They're creating an archive. In the
future, when people want to know...

39
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,604
What do I get out of it
if a moron studies me in 100 years?

40
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,047
- Who'd study you, bighead?
- This smells of cops.

41
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,163
Yeah, have they got anything
to do with it?

42
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,840
- No, they haven't.
- Swear by all you hold sacred.

43
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,407
They want to keep an eye on us.

44
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,648
I haven't sold grass
for at least two hours.

45
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,723
You're like a crowd of five-year-old.

46
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,687
It's an ok project, really.

47
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,888
It's a my to change
the image shown of you

48
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,128
on the TV, in the papers,
in the media...

49
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,288
I'd like to be public enemy no. 1.

50
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,244
I want you to have the chance

51
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,602
to show what you're really like,
how you live...

52
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,724
Yeah, and then we all end up
in the slammer. It's dangerous.

53
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,207
If I bring a camera into the house
my dad'll string me up!

54
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,528
And then he'll sell the camera
to fix your face.

55
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,690
Do we get paid? What?

56
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,884
- Do we get paid?
- This isn't Hollywood.

57
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,651
- It's a project by the ministry.
- Only nutter gets paid.

58
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,764
Idiot!
All nutter needs is a bit of love.

59
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,569
- I love you too, guys.
- V\iho'll put it together?

60
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,000
You think you're almodévar?

61
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,407
- They can do what they want with it.
- Why not give us the cameras?

62
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,489
- 'Cos they want them back!
- Right!

63
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,968
Don't say I didn't try.
Screw the project.

64
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,844
No, come on!

65
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,283
I'll still get my millionaire salary

66
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,891
and we'll go back to...

67
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,163
Hey, how do I know
what they'll do with what I do?

68
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,124
I have to explain everything.

69
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,800
They'll wipe their asses.

70
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,885
What do you think they'll do?

71
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,489
They can show us
any fucking way they want.

72
00:08:50,935 --> 00:08:53,335
I don't like to look scary
but I don't want to look pathetic.

73
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,168
He's right.

74
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,043
- Here.
- What the fuck do I do with this?

75
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,523
I don't know.
Treat it like a girlfriend.

76
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,331
I'll go screw it.

77
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,128
A threesome!

78
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,687
Do whatever you want.
That way, you'll understand it.

79
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,245
Surprise us!

80
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,368
Knock everyone on their <i>asses</i>
when they see it.

81
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,803
You're not the worst guys,
and you're not pathetic.

82
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,127
Surprise us, chino,

83
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,045
with something
no one expects from you.

84
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,046
<i>Hi, this is Felix.</i>

85
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,130
<i>Leave a message
and h! Call you back.</i>

86
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,243
- It was it your idea to run away?
- Yes.

87
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,522
- Your mother didn't send you?
- No.

88
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,291
So she knows nothing about this?

89
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,687
No.

90
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,281
- May I?
- Yes.

91
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,925
Would you like something to eat?

92
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,166
Call your mother.

93
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,409
When she finds out you've gone
she'll get an awful fright.

94
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,204
Is that what you want,
to frighten her?

95
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,004
I just want to meet my father.

96
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,807
Isma, 'what's wrong?

97
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,321
Hello, I'm Nora salmerdn,
félix ambr6s's mother.

98
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,808
I'm calling from Barcelona.
Ismael is with me.

99
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,680
Fe'lix's mother?
What are you doing with my son?

100
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,451
Excuse me, I'm not doing anything.
He came on his own.

101
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,246
He had this address
but félix hasn't lived here for years.

102
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,404
I want to speak to my son.

103
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,764
She's very angry,
very sad and very worried,

104
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,123
so take a deep breath
and speak very calmly.

105
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,724
Love, what are you doing there?

106
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,448
- I <i>want</i> to <i>meet my father.
- You don? Know what you're saying.</i>

107
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,042
<i>- Yes,</i> I <i>do</i> know.
<i>- You can? Go off on your awn.</i>

108
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,049
Anything could have happened
to you.

109
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,811
- You should have done it with me.
- I asked you a thousand times

110
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,844
- but you never listened.
- Isma,

111
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,761
this isn't the way.
You're in Barcelona with a stranger.

112
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,403
She isn't a stranger.
She's my grandmother.

113
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,560
What matters now
is that my son, a minor,

114
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,287
is 400 Miles from my house
and against my wishes.

115
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,051
He came by himself.
What should I do?

116
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,571
Put him out on the street?

117
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,448
<i>I want him back here
as soon as possible.</i>

118
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,087
Well,

119
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,851
I can put him on a train
in a few hours.

120
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,249
Will we risk
that he'll run away again?

121
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,045
I don't want to go home.

122
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,730
- What do you want me to do?
- Take me to see him.

123
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,167
I know I'm going to regret this,
but I think it's best if I take him

124
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,761
- to <i>meet</i> félix.
- What are you saying?

125
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,724
<i>The boy ran</i> away.

126
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,763
This obviously means a lot to him.

127
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,088
If he goes home without seeing Felix,

128
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,289
how long will it be
before he tries again?

129
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,608
- Does félix live on his own?
- Yes.

130
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,325
Well, I think so.

131
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,001
Don't you know'?

132
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,562
- Has he got children?
- No.

133
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,043
Well, I don't think so.

134
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,563
We don't see each other much.
We both work a lot.

135
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,126
What does he do?

136
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,130
Why not ask him all those questions
when you see him?

137
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,330
What if he doesn't want to see me?

138
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,570
How could he not want to see you?

139
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,848
Wait here, ok?

140
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,085
- Those table centers are horrible.
- They're ten Euros cheaper.

141
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,328
420 of them, do the math.
Really tacky.

142
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,285
- Will we take them off?
- No, not now. Let's see in here.

143
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,325
Good. Good. Good. Good.

144
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,967
And the puff pastries?
You'd no time?

145
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,730
- How long has he been here?
- I told him not to make them.

146
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,651
It would take too long.
We didn't hire an assistant and...

147
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,322
Look, we're gambling our survival.
Where are the chair covers?

148
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,205
- They're on their way.
- The wedding's today, not tomorrow!

149
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,890
- We're not used to weddings.
- The covers are here.

150
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,368
Great. Get moving.
I'm going to kill the sommelier.

151
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,641
Well, they arrived in time.

152
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,810
Hey you! What are you doing?

153
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,485
Who let him in?

154
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,603
- If Nora sees him, she'll kill us.
- Leyre...

155
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,000
- What's this wine?
- The washroom is for customers.

156
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,610
This isn't the wine I ordered.

157
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,725
We're throwing him out.

158
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,046
Wait in the car.

159
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,962
You'll have to take charge
for the next four hours.

160
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,640
- I have to take charge?
- Yes, I've something important to do.

161
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,162
- What about the wedding?
- I'll be here before the meal starts.

162
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,840
No, you can't go!
I can't cope with all this...

163
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,930
You can cope perfectly.
Four hours, probably less.

164
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,964
- The contract depends on this...
- Foul

165
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,207
felixambrose
biographyand life history

166
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,880
saves woman's life in accident...

167
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,966
What happened?

168
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,123
Why did ismael run away?
Did you have a row'?

169
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,367
No.

170
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,571
Hurry up and we'll get there early.

171
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,240
I can go on my own.
Take me to barajas and...

172
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,564
And what?
You get to Barcelona, hire a car,

173
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,842
drive to God knows where...

174
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,126
I'll go with you,

175
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,846
we can manage better together.

176
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,086
It's all arranged.

177
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,324
Berta will see my patients,
we've canceled your appointments.

178
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,166
Thank you.

179
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,404
I wonder how he found him.
He's not the only félix in Barcelona.

180
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,000
Félix.

181
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,202
- What is it?
- I'd forgotten that was his name.

182
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,404
How do you get on with your mother?

183
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,442
Fine, I think. Normal.

184
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,324
And what does "normal" mean?

185
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,531
She scolds me when I'm bad

186
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,089
and she's happy
when I get good grades.

187
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,081
It's him.

188
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,689
Mom, I hope it's an emergency.
I don't want to spend the recess...

189
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,769
<i>Do you know the name
alike thou?</i>

190
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,730
What do you know about alika?

191
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,642
<i>Wen,</i>

192
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,810
I've got a little boy called ismael

193
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,082
who says he's the son
of you and alika tchou.

194
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,242
<i>- Do you think that's true?
- She called him ismael?</i>

195
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,609
So it's true.

196
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,249
- And her?
- Who?

197
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,762
Who do you think? Alika!
Is she with you?

198
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,644
Nutter,
I've got something to tell you.

199
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,727
No, but the boy and I
are on our way to you now.

200
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,562
- What do you mean?
- We're <i>on</i> our way to you.

201
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,327
- You feeling rough?
- No, I'm fine, go away.

202
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,769
- I wanted...
- Get out!

203
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,406
What did he say?

204
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,851
- Does he want to see me?
- Of course he does!

205
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,611
Why wouldn't he?

206
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,886
You look very pretty

207
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,131
he made that trip on his own
and he's so young...

208
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,286
He's not that young.

209
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,282
Isn't he young
to take a train on his own?

210
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,529
- Well, he did it.
- Are you justifying it?

211
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,049
He just wants to meet his father.

212
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,851
You're his father.

213
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,683
I'm trying to understand it.

214
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,127
I know.

215
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,006
It'll be all right, you'll see.
Ismael adores you.

216
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,725
I was coming out of my house...

217
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,881
Hey, you brute,
stop thumping the machine!

218
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,650
It swallowed my euro!

219
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,844
If I got a euro every time
I heard that... get out of here.

220
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,088
I want my juice, or my money!

221
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,042
So, I was coming out of my house
the other day...

222
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,730
I want my juice, or my money.

223
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,042
Don't you understand, kid?
Get out, don't be such a pain.

224
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,881
Are you deaf? The boy said
he wants his money or his juice.

225
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,931
Hey, these women have monkeys now
instead of poodles.

226
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,443
I bet you wish
you'd a monkey's intelligence.

227
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,649
What an idiot. Come on.

228
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,404
It was a miracle he survived.

229
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,604
The worst thing is I didn't want
to buy him the damn bike.

230
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,689
The doctors said he'd be fine
if he looked after himself, but...

231
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,490
He didn't.
You know the first thing he did?

232
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,686
He gave up architecture
even though he was doing well.

233
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,408
Then he went traveling
and when he came back

234
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,561
he wanted to sell
the apartment his father had left him

235
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,525
because he'd seen
a magnificent house.

236
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,563
Of course, I said absolutely not,
the apartment belonged to the family.

237
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,404
But he insisted so much

238
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,640
that in the end
I bought the apartment

239
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,208
and moved there because
my house was too big for just me.

240
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,327
And then he comes and says

241
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,088
he wants to go into education.

242
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,682
Be a teacher.

243
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,882
A good my to ruin his life.

244
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,523
- Why do you keep taking photos?
- When I'm grown up,

245
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,088
I want to remember everything
that happens today. Today is my day.

246
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,970
You came out very pretty.

247
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,565
Take my bag, please,

248
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,411
and look in a black diary
for Fe'lix's address.

249
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,842
Have you never been to his house?

250
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,242
Every time I threaten to visit
he makes an excuse.

251
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,891
He's got a lot of work,

252
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,568
he's going to Barcelona soon...

253
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,481
Passeig de pau casals, number 8.

254
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,810
We're in passeig de pau casals,

255
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,131
but I don't see number 8.

256
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,609
- There!
- Where?

257
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,281
You're right!

258
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,289
Excuse me,
is this 8, passeig de pau casals?

259
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,131
Yes, but we're closed.

260
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,691
Does Felix ambrés live here?

261
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,170
I'm his mother, Nora salmerén.

262
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,327
- Salmer6n?
- Yes, félix ambrés salmerén.

263
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,170
That's what his I.D. Says.

264
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,204
I'm ismael Gonzalez,
félix ambr6s's son.

265
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,801
His son? Apleasure. I'm jordi.

266
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,286
This was the address I had.
Do you live with him?

267
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,120
No. He gives this address
to get his mail.

268
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,890
Driving to his house is complicated

269
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,009
but it's just along the beach.

270
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,009
I can take you there.

271
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,083
- Nutter, I have to talk to you.
- I've got no time today, chino.

272
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,726
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- It's urgent.

273
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,241
The cops are after bonobo.
Again?

274
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,044
They've got it in for him.

275
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,360
But this time he's innocent, I swear.

276
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,530
He hasn't dealt in ages.
You have to tell them

277
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,881
- to leave him alone.
- Yeah, and they'll listen to me.

278
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,884
You can convince them
with those smart things you say.

279
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,560
Give me a break, chino. I can't today.

280
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,968
Tell bonobo to lie low till tomorrow.

281
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,970
You tell him,
you're the only one he listens to.

282
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,845
If he listened to me,
he wouldn't always be in trouble.

283
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,760
They're out to get him.

284
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,284
Fuck...

285
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,844
He's to hide today
and tomorrow we'll see what we can do.

286
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,485
I can't do it today, really.

287
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,370
I've got a life too.

288
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,441
- Is anything wrong?
- No, nothing.

289
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,930
You looked rough in the washroom.

290
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,971
Even if nothing's wrong, you know...

291
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,650
Yes, I know.

292
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,362
I know.

293
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,922
<i>Hwy</i>

294
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,802
what would you get for a kid mo's...

295
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,122
Eight years old.

296
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,525
Ismael, you'll get wet!

297
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,610
Let him enjoy it.
He's thrilled with the sea.

298
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,842
- H ave you known Felix for long?
- Yes, it's been a few years now.

299
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,850
When he decided to settle here
I was delighted.

300
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,963
There aren't many
good conversationalists,

301
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,049
and he's a great listener too.

302
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,004
Are you sure
we're talking about my son?

303
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,080
Does my son live there?
In a cave?

304
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,241
Come on.

305
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,690
I'll check the fridge.
This kid must be hungry.

306
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,930
Calm down.
It's all right, you know that.

307
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,249
Look in my eyes.
Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.

308
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,169
Ismael, look in my eyes.
Look in my eyes.

309
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,364
Ismael, the problem isn't
in your lungs. It's in your head,

310
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,130
it's playing tricks on you.

311
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,085
Look, you don't need this.

312
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,443
Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.
Look at me.

313
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,241
Look at me.
Forget about the air in your chest.

314
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,762
Think of something nice.
Something you really like.

315
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,249
A song? A film? Look at me, love.

316
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,841
<i>W“?</i>

317
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,606
Is there a girl at school
that you like?

318
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,722
Yes! We got that right.

319
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,760
Very good. Now, think about her,

320
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,361
and all you'll have to tell her
when you see her.

321
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,810
That's it. Good.

322
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,089
Good. All right.

323
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,126
Come on, love.
You're going to sit here.

324
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,961
Sit down.

325
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,650
I'll be right back.

326
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,804
I'll make him an infusion.

327
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,960
Or whatever I find.

328
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,730
How did you calm him down?

329
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,644
Félix had the same thing.

330
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,081
The ambréss' defective genes.

331
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,884
You're good with kids.
He was hypnotized.

332
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,610
Am I like he says I am?

333
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,565
I don't know what you mean.

334
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,528
My son must have said
something about me.

335
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,611
He never talked about me?

336
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,642
Mom?

337
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,161
Ismael?

338
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,881
I'm félix.

339
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,123
"Sapere... aude."

340
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,281
It's Latin.

341
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,888
- And what does it mean?
- "Dare to know."

342
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,962
You don't look after yourself.
You're...

343
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,969
Thinner and more...

344
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,130
More mature. When he gets
some grey hair he'll be irresistible.

345
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,321
Won't he, ismael?

346
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,804
I don't know.
I didn't know him before.

347
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,284
Leyre, I won't get there sooner
just because you keep calling.

348
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,889
If everything's ok, that's great.

349
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,128
Don't get rattled,
show them you're in control.

350
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,244
Yes, I'm on my way. Ok, so long.

351
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,489
It's a pity you're leaving so soon.

352
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,204
Tell Felix that if they want to eat
I'll see them at the hotel.

353
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,640
There's nothing here.

354
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,964
Why are you looking at me like that?

355
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,480
- Like what?
- Like that.

356
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,127
I can't close my business
when I feel like it

357
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,767
- or stop working for three months.
- I didn't say anything.

358
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,769
The world doesn't stop when...

359
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,730
When your son needs you?

360
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,531
Is it true you ran away?

361
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,646
And does...

362
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,728
Your mother know mere you are?

363
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,409
- Do they hurt?
- Do what hurt?

364
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,567
Your legs?

365
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,043
No. Well, at times they hurt a bit.

366
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,370
- I guessed...
- What did...

367
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,881
- Sony, you first.
- It doesn't matter.

368
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,203
What did your mother
tell you about me?

369
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,326
Nothing. Well, that your name
was félix and you lived in Barcelona.

370
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,766
Is that all?

371
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,166
Where do you live?

372
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,283
- In Madrid.
- In Madrid.

373
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,611
And how...

374
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,086
How is your mother?

375
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,808
Today she's really angry with me.

376
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,928
You're in for it when you get home.

377
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,329
Yes, but when she gets like that
Luis defends me.

378
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,081
- Luis?
- My father. I mean, my other father.

379
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,810
My mother's husband.

380
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,771
I have a deal with him.

381
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,810
Every month
Luis buys me a new video game.

382
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,405
My mother doesn't like them

383
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,888
but Luis thinks they're ok.

384
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,647
Your mother's right.
Video games are shit.

385
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,331
A lot of people criticize them
but they're very useful.

386
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,126
They improve your reﬂexes,
your concentration,

387
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,685
and they teach you strategy.

388
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,600
Luis says I'm much better at math

389
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,043
- because of video games.
- Hell of a theory.

390
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,167
No one advances a level
without discipline.

391
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,725
That's ridiculous.

392
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,400
For God's sake!

393
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:13,929
Mom!

394
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,209
- Sit there.
- Ok, ok.

395
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,050
Go to the kitchen and get some ice.

396
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,686
And a cloth. They're in the drawer
under the cutlery.

397
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,168
If you wanted to scare off the child
you're doing a great job.

398
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,960
- That hurt!
- Don't tell me how to talk to him.

399
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,601
You've never known how to talk to me.

400
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,000
- In 'which drawer?
- Under the cutlery.

401
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,806
Do as you wish,

402
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,731
but this way you'll never
connect with him in 30 minutes,

403
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,241
which is the time you have
before alika arrives.

404
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,203
What?

405
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,727
Alika's coming?

406
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,364
Of course, to pick him up.

407
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,767
I'd stay, but...

408
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,521
I've only got the restaurant staff
and they're all useless.

409
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,046
If you want, I'll take him to
Barcelona and give him to her there.

410
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,209
But now that I think about it,

411
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,330
I won't be able to drive.

412
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,005
- I can't find them.
- I'm coming.

413
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,967
My ankle is swelling, I can't leave.

414
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,691
It's not swelling.

415
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,324
<i>I miss you...</i>

416
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,845
<i>Like people miss</i>

417
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,203
<i>starless nights,</i>

418
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,163
<i>like they miss</i>

419
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,560
<i>beautiful mornings.</i>

420
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,051
<i>No! Being with you</i>

421
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,846
<i>is hurting me so.</i>

422
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,731
<i>Oh, I miss you</i>

423
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,442
<i>when I'm walking, when I'm crying,
when.</i>.

424
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,725
Why did you turn it off'?

425
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,523
That slushy stuff makes me sleepy.

426
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,810
But if you want I'll leave it on.

427
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,929
I think we should
spend the night in Barcelona.

428
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,242
Driving straight back would be hard
on ismael. And on us.

429
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,844
I just want to go home,

430
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,322
put him in his bed
and forget about today.

431
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,484
Dr. Joan torrents
gen general practitioner er

432
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,009
- mom, you hardly let him touch you.
- Did you see his hands?

433
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,441
- He was more like a vet than a doctor.
- Here.

434
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,927
- What did he say?
- That it won't kill me.

435
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,770
No, he said that she's fine.
It was just a little knock

436
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,405
and she should walk carefully

437
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,729
that I'm fine! What would he know
with those big hands...

438
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,922
Can you go a bit slower, please?

439
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,767
That's it, gasp for air.

440
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,364
Is there a lot of crime here?

441
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,682
You stay here.

442
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,487
- H hey, nutter! Look 'who's here!
- What's up, guys?

443
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,081
We thought we'd get
some images of the town.

444
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,760
Yes, but think before you shoot,
I know you lot.

445
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,167
Where's bonobo?

446
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,927
He's looking for a place to lie low.

447
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,326
This is my mother, Nora.

448
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,285
Mom, these are chino, mogollén
and Aziz, friends of mine.

449
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,084
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

450
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,770
So it was for him...

451
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,088
This is ismael. Ismael is my son.

452
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,448
Shit, a lot of people
thought he was...

453
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,451
I can leave you the camera
so you can film the kid and...

454
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,290
No, you're working.

455
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,924
There'll be other chances to film us,
right, ismael?

456
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,809
- All right, see you tomorrow.
- Sure.

457
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,922
- Take care.
- So long.

458
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,288
Will we go to the development?

459
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,249
No, I'm going to the mmorehouse!
His mother's expecting me.

460
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,601
Wait.

461
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,361
Ismael!

462
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,849
- Ismael!
- Let him go.

463
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,251
Come on!

464
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,570
What are you teaching them?

465
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,602
To love themselves a bit.
I don't have it easy.

466
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,087
I teach in a center
for kids with problems.

467
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,806
Delinquents.
No, kids with problems.

468
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,923
So now you're a social worker.

469
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,122
I teach drawing and an in general.

470
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,970
Didn't I tell you?

471
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,325
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

472
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,726
- N nothing?
- Nothing.

473
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,160
It's jordi. Yes?

474
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,204
- Jordi?
- I've had an accident, leyre.

475
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,882
No, it's not serious,
but I won't be able to drive.

476
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,401
Of course you can do it on your own.
Call me 'amen you need to, ok?

477
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,726
All right, bye.

478
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,366
- Jordi, where are you?
- Hello!

479
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,000
Why don't you go to the cellar
and pick the wine you like most?

480
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,805
The one I like most, really?

481
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,571
So, I can't leave you on your own.

482
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,922
- What's that noise?
- It's my heart.

483
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,082
The boiler.

484
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,608
You'll have to call the cardiologist.

485
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,442
- Lamb?
- Yes, don't you like lamb?

486
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,405
But when are we going to eat?
It takes ages to cook.

487
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,841
- This is dry and tasteless!
- What do you mean?

488
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,771
My lamb is always delicious.

489
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,282
Have you any meat stock, bay leaves
or honey? Something to liven it up...

490
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,802
- Lamb with honey?
- Jordi, is this one good?

491
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,526
- Holy shit, I'll say it is.
- Give me that.

492
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,807
There's honey and all you want
in that cupboard.

493
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,846
Let's go out to the table.

494
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,686
I'll leave the lamb to you.

495
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,486
Try to leave one bit without honey,
if you can.

496
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,120
- He doesn't look at me.
- What do you mean?

497
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,491
Félix doesn't look at me.

498
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,243
Of course he looks at you.

499
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,364
Not in the eye.

500
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,447
- Come and sit beside félix.
- Let him sit where he wants.

501
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,449
Don't you want to sit here?

502
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,208
Ismael, you'll have to sit with me,
those two will drive you crazy.

503
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,082
Here.

504
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,487
Thank you.

505
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,811
So, do you eat everything
or are you the kind

506
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,128
who lives on hamburgers?
Everything.

507
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,529
Spinach too?

508
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,644
My mother says it's good
but I think it's disgusting.

509
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,205
There are things we don't like in life
but they're good.

510
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,768
How often have I heard that?

511
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,043
Do you like any sport?

512
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,242
I play basketball in the school team.

513
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,842
Really? You know félix played
basketball at school?

514
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,929
Volleyball. I never played basketball.

515
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,282
- It's almost the same.
- Almost the same?

516
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,370
Yes, it's with a ball and it's not
soccer which is what most kids play.

517
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,211
Why can you never be quiet
when you've got nothing to say?

518
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,484
The lamb won't be ready for a while.

519
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,843
What if I show you my secret room?

520
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,006
Vvn, psp, Xbox...

521
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,562
- You've got all that?
- It's the only way I can play sports.

522
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,883
- May I?
- Come on.

523
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,209
Can I leave you on your own?

524
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,445
Keep an eye on the lamb,

525
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,881
and if you feel like it
make the salad.

526
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,002
Come on.

527
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,891
Are you going to tell me?

528
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,242
- How is he your child?
- Do I really have to explain?

529
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,568
You have an eight year old child,
who's black...

530
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,525
We can act civilized.
I don't care, but he is black.

531
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,810
Get to the point.

532
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,760
Why did you keep it from me?

533
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,321
Since when do you care what I do?

534
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,242
Yes, leyre.

535
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,483
Even now, you can't forget
your fucking restaurant.

536
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,967
Hang on.

537
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,364
This fucking restaurant
has kept us all our lives

538
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,483
because if had been
up to your father...

539
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,203
Leyre,

540
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,446
you'll have to sort it out yourself,
I can't talk now.

541
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,846
'Bye.

542
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,645
Why didn't you tell me?

543
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,125
Tell you what?

544
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,724
That I'd fallen madly in love?

545
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,288
No. You wouldn't have understood.

546
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,489
Why do you think that?

547
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,931
Because you have no idea
what it means to love someone.

548
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,364
You ruined my father's life...

549
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,531
And you'd have ruined mine
if I'd let you.

550
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,921
Pay attention.
This is only for the chosen few.

551
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,202
Why doesn't félix look me in the eye?

552
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,001
Do I scare him?

553
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,246
I guess...

554
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,641
I should thank you
for bringing ismael.

555
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,528
Alika was the physiotherapist mom...

556
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,127
Looked after me when I came home,

557
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,040
after the accident.

558
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,047
Remember her?

559
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,249
We were together three months.

560
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,651
The best in my life,

561
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,091
despite the pain.

562
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,925
I felt really good.

563
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,891
The rehabilitation was working
and I was making plans

564
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,605
for when it was over.

565
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,005
But some things scared me.

566
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,851
The idea of telling you,

567
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,211
among others.

568
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,529
But I wanted to try to stay with her.

569
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,921
I was in love.

570
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,651
I'd never been in love.

571
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,922
Then alika told me she was pregnant.

572
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,846
I don't know...

573
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,768
I'd never thought
about having a child.

574
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,682
I got scared.

575
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,640
I panicked.

576
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,410
And I acted the way you'd taught me.

577
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,682
I said that the best thing
was to get rid of it.

578
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,206
That's normal. You were young.

579
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,565
Alika didn't want anything.

580
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,044
At most, an embrace.

581
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,691
That I wouldn't make her feel
more alone than she already was.

582
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,121
But all I wanted was to get away.

583
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,963
She realized and never came back.
I went to the house where she lived.

584
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,050
They said she'd moved
and left no address.

585
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,486
I even thought about
going to the police but...

586
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,723
Alika was illegal here.

587
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,609
She disappeared without a trace,

588
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,283
like she'd never existed.

589
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,283
And you never heard any more?

590
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,844
I didn't even mow the baby
had been born, until today.

591
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,370
I beat him at everything!

592
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,723
Jordi's a fierce opponent,
you must have played well.

593
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,048
No one can beat him.

594
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,687
- It smells of honey!
- There's honey in it.

595
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,248
- And that salad?
- What's wrong with my salad?

596
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,727
Instead of slicing the tomatoes
you crushed them.

597
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,127
Careful, or you'll get no dessert.

598
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,566
Just wait,
you'll end up licking your fingers...

599
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,124
This is delicious!

600
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,966
It's good, isn't it?
And I won't give you the recipe.

601
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,646
Don't you like it?

602
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,771
Neither do I.

603
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,008
I want to take a photo. May I?

604
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,527
- Not now, afterward.
- Yes, now.

605
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,769
- Go over there.
- All right.

606
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,245
If you get félix
to look good in the photo,

607
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,090
- I'll give you a super-prize.
- Really?

608
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,009
My mother always thought
she was a good photographer.

609
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,123
When I was little like you,
she put me facing the sun,

610
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,527
and I'd keep my eyes open
as long as I could,

611
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,484
and when I couldn't do it anymore...

612
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,530
Just like that.

613
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,127
This one's good.

614
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,209
- Now you go over there.
- Come here.

615
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,447
Sit here.

616
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,969
Attention. Let's see.

617
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,890
A bit closer together, please.

618
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,567
Félix, move a bit closer.

619
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,367
Let's see. Big smile.

620
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,210
Look natural!

621
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,201
- Very good!
- That's it.

622
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,646
Is that from ismael?

623
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,091
He keeps sending me photos.

624
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,050
It's his way of apologizing.

625
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,807
What's this?

626
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,684
- This is a piano.
- Right! And the key?

627
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,726
It got lost.

628
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,165
- Have you always been in catering?
- No.

629
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,089
I was a musician, in another life.

630
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,927
And why are you running a hotel
in this life?

631
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,247
Because one day I decided to change
and I changed.

632
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,765
Simple as that? Just because?

633
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,441
Simple as that and just because.

634
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,770
Why don't I believe it?

635
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,724
Because you never believe anything,
do you?

636
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,131
- Are you a good friend of my son?
- Hands up.

637
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,890
The interrogation is starting.

638
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,606
Why don't you ask
what you really want to ask?

639
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,209
In another life
were you a psychoanalyst?

640
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,046
I had asthma too.

641
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,323
Nora got rid of it. I don't know
what she did, but she got rid of it.

642
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,524
- I don't need the inhaler now.
- I know her methods.

643
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,843
It's cool having
a grandmother like that.

644
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,728
You know what I'd like now?

645
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,571
To be like a computer,

646
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,242
connect the USB to you,

647
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,166
and know absolutely everything
about you.

648
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,487
When I grow up,
I want to be the captain of a ship.

649
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,161
- You like the sea?
- To look for treasure.

650
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,045
You know there are lots of ships
at the bottom of the sea?

651
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,767
I wanted to build cities,
in the desert or on other planets.

652
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,885
That would be neat!

653
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,210
- Have you got a girlfriend?
- Have you?

654
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,811
I asked first.

655
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,128
I don't know. Her name's Kim.

656
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,971
Sometimes I think she likes me,
other times I don't.

657
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,602
It's a muddle.

658
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,882
Awhile ago,
if I did this in front of her,

659
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,162
I was the neatest guy.
But if I do it now

660
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,124
she looks at me like I'm a moron.

661
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,124
Shit, this is some place!

662
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,006
Are you all right?

663
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,129
- Have you got a toothbrush?
- No.

664
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,806
A breath mint?

665
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,167
You go.

666
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,687
Tell them I don't feel well
and I'm waiting here.

667
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,442
Are you sure?

668
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,566
All right...

669
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:51,047
- Would you rather I waited here?
- No.

670
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,325
I can't do it on my own.

671
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,161
Ok.

672
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,602
There he is.

673
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,208
You go into the hotel.
I'll get ismael.

674
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,562
Ismael!

675
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,005
Don't ever do that to me again!

676
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,809
Luis is inside, go and say hello.

677
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,163
We had to ask directions
at one point...

678
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:57,963
Luis!

679
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,251
You really stirred it up.

680
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,529
- Were you angry?
- A bit.

681
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,521
- And her?
- Loads. We'll try to sort it out.

682
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,011
You've changed a lot.

683
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,730
I thought I'd never see you again.

684
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,486
I looked for you.

685
00:54:39,015 --> 00:54:41,135
It isn't easy to explain
all that's built up inside...

686
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,323
We come for my son. Nothing else.

687
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,089
All I care about is ismael.

688
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,046
I don't want you to promise him
anything you won't keep.

689
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,528
A child
understands promises differently.

690
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,131
It's better to say "no" now
than disappoint him later,

691
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,607
when everything is more complicated.

692
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,250
- He knows you now, that's what he...
- Let me speak, please!

693
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,441
- You can't accuse me of...
- He's my son.

694
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,481
He has a life.

695
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,527
Maybe that means nothing to you.

696
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,728
- I want to get to know him.
- Why??

697
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,729
Because he came looking for me.

698
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,849
He's my son too,
in case you didn't realize.

699
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,849
You have no right to say that.

700
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,607
I was all alone until he was three.

701
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,007
You know what it's like
to rear a child on your own,

702
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,171
without papers,
living in shared apartments,

703
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,404
not knowing
if you'll be able to manage?

704
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,886
No, I don't know.

705
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,727
No.

706
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,967
You don't know.

707
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,804
Of course you don't.

708
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,245
If you don't want to drive,

709
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,966
a friend of mine
has an hotel near here.

710
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,525
Thank you, but we have to go.

711
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,006
Don't leave anything behind.

712
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,569
Hello, I'm Nora, Fe'lix's mother.

713
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,207
A pleasure.
Thank you for looking after ismael.

714
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,801
Hello, I'm jordi.

715
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,083
- Can I get you a drink...?
- No, thank you. We're leaving now.

716
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,486
But you've just arrived.

717
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,771
We came to get ismael,
it's not a vacation.

718
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,326
Apparently
there's a hotel near here...

719
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,887
To save you
driving to Barcelona at night.

720
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,211
I don't want to leave.

721
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,650
- Or you can stay here.
- No, we'd better not.

722
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,082
- Ismael, we have to go.
- That's not true.

723
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,651
We're closed to the public,
but you're Fe'lix's family

724
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,888
and this is like Fe'lix's home.

725
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:52,842
Good evening.

726
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,203
Félix,

727
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,161
this is Luis, alika's husband.

728
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,483
- Hello.
- A pleasure.

729
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,009
Can I sleep in your house?

730
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,282
But you've seen what it's like.

731
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,811
I can sleep in the armchair.

732
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,649
I think your mother has other plans.

733
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,561
She can change them.

734
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,360
We already changed them a lot,
because of you.

735
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,360
What you did
was irresponsible and dangerous.

736
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,648
- Anything could have...
- Nothing happened!

737
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,001
Get your things, please.

738
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:31,842
Go on.

739
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,009
We'll talk calmly
when we get to Madrid.

740
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,131
I don't want to leave!

741
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,729
Luis!

742
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,121
Ismael!

743
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,641
Ismael!

744
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,521
Ismael!

745
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,291
- Why did you lie to me?
- When did I lie to you?

746
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,447
All my life.

747
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,846
- Lie about what?
- About félix.

748
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,166
I never said anything.

749
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,761
That's lying.

750
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,444
I did it to protect you.

751
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,682
Wait!

752
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,162
I was wrong. It's obvious.

753
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,010
I thought you weren't ready.

754
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,883
- I'm not a child.
- I'll tell you what.

755
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,491
We'll stay tonight
and tomorrow morning we'll go home.

756
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,570
No.
I want to stay and live with félix.

757
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,001
You've got Luis but he's got nobody.

758
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,446
- What are you saying?
- I want to know my father.

759
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,282
- Luis is your father.
- Yes, he is too, but I know him.

760
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,809
We won't talk about this now.
Let's go home, please.

761
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,971
Why do you hate him so much?

762
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:50,728
Ismael!

763
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,766
You should go home.

764
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,850
It's the only place he knows.
I'll take the path down to the town.

765
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,929
- I'll go with you.
- You can't walk.

766
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,565
Of course I can!

767
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,481
You two stay in the hotel
in case he comes back.

768
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,444
No, I can't just sit here.

769
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,283
Come with me, if you want.

770
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,121
I'll wait here.

771
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,926
Ismael!

772
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,960
Where can he be?

773
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,488
- Ismael!
- Nora, this way.

774
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,161
It was her, obviously, because...

775
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,966
The child was fine until she arrived.

776
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,123
You saw that, didn't you?

777
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,007
Ismael!

778
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,849
Ismael!

779
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,089
<i>This is ismael.
If I don? Answer! 'M in class</i>

780
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,725
<i>or very busy.</i>

781
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,369
Ismael,
I'm in the hotel, waiting for you.

782
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,443
The others are out looking for you.

783
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,566
Stop messing, you'll regret it later.

784
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,048
Mom's worried.
You know her, she always thinks...

785
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,247
Shit!

786
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,768
- Ismael!
- Ismael!

787
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,961
Ismael!

788
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,801
Ismael!

789
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,407
Ismael!

790
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,127
Hey!

791
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,647
Ismael!

792
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,247
If he went the other way,
the town isn't far.

793
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,445
He'll see the lights.

794
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,849
Every time you come into my life...

795
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,889
Chino,
I said I can't do anything today.

796
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,687
Really?

797
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,491
I'm a disaster,
I can't give you advice.

798
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,049
Lots of times
I just did what my friends did...

799
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:54,400
And I'd get beaten up
or reported to the police.

800
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,081
It was shit.

801
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,211
Once, nutter... I mean, your father,

802
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,407
told me something
I've never forgotten.

803
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,604
Rage is like a hand grenade
for a one-armed man. Understand?

804
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,126
He can activate it with his mouth,
but he cant throw it.

805
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,084
He can only run. Can you imagine it?

806
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,251
The one-armed man running
and suddenly, boom!

807
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,124
The grenade blows up in his face.

808
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,004
You've got a great father.

809
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,089
Hey, don't cry on me.

810
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,441
You want me to start crying too?

811
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,488
Luis, they found him.

812
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,569
He's with one of Fe'lix's pupils.

813
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,160
Yes, I'm fine.

814
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,650
We're going back now.

815
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,366
You still use it.

816
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,170
It's the one you gave me.

817
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,365
You gave up the rehabilitation.

818
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,928
I couldn't let anyone else touch me.

819
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,569
That's stupid...

820
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,126
I looked for you.

821
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:28,120
I looked desperately for you
for three years.

822
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,687
I went to all the places
you ever mentioned.

823
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,011
I even went to Nigeria,

824
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,967
I showed everyone
the photos I had of you.

825
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,405
I never moved from here.

826
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,444
When I was starting to forget you,

827
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,404
you started pursuing me.

828
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,724
You'd appear everywhere,

829
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,689
in the reﬂection of a store window,

830
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,608
in the puddle in a train station,

831
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,004
in a shadow in the forest.

832
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,124
You never let up.

833
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,841
- You pursued me like a curse.
- Don't go on.

834
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,286
I didn't come for an explanation.

835
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,371
Call your mother.

836
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,881
Tell her we found ismael.

837
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,491
She was very worried.

838
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,444
- Why do you call him "n utter"?
- Because he's nuts.

839
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,446
He's not like the other teachers.

840
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,565
He's always direct.

841
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,921
Go on.

842
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,442
I'm sorry.

843
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,042
Thanks.

844
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,925
- You'd do it for me.
- Did bonobo find somewhere to hide?

845
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,849
Yeah, no one will find him.

846
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,646
- We hid him in the school.
- In the school? Are you crazy?

847
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,729
- What's wrong?
- You guys never learn.

848
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,445
Take it easy. It'll be all right.

849
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,127
Good luck, pal.

850
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,488
- Sort it out, chino.
- Don't worry.

851
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,928
Can I sleep over with félix?

852
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:16,808
You go with him.
I'll go back to the hotel.

853
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,129
- On your own?
- I know the my.

854
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,364
But it's easy to get lost.

855
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:29,199
Chino!

856
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:29,700
Chino!

857
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,887
Nutter met my father at the court and
told him to withdraw the complaint,

858
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,447
to leave me in peace,
that I could have a future too,

859
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,130
that I was intelligent...

860
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:41,324
No one had ever told me
I was intelligent!

861
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,489
- I'm sure you are.
- It doesn't matter

862
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,331
but nutter thinks I am,
and that's neat.

863
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,967
It's like I love myself more.

864
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,043
Nutter's been great to me.

865
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,368
Well, to me and to others.

866
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,321
He gets involved in every mess,

867
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,851
he's not afraid of anything.

868
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,966
- Thanks for seeing me back.
- You're welcome.

869
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:05,842
Hey...

870
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,844
You're a real looker, I'm not
surprised he's in love with you.

871
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,170
No offense meant.

872
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,571
Are you staying?

873
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,651
Nutter seems really lonely.
No girlfriends or anything.

874
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,604
We even thought he was a faggot.

875
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,321
- Good night.
- Good night.

876
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,084
Where's ismael?

877
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,846
He's staying with félix.

878
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:42,928
He won.

879
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,281
You never told me
they were a posh crowd.

880
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,722
- I'm going to shower.
- Ok.

881
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,249
It wasn't a good idea
to leave him there.

882
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,444
We have to leave very early.

883
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,884
You go back now,
I'll take the train tomorrow

884
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,569
I thought you couldn't
do it on your own.

885
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,204
What happened?
What have I missed?

886
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,850
I'm not always like this.

887
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,562
- Like what?
- Like the one-armed man's grenade.

888
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,810
But this is a weird day.

889
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,567
Yesterday I didn't even know
I had a grandmother,

890
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,081
and today I like Nora.

891
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,042
Why do you two always fight?

892
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,721
I don't know.

893
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,126
Because she wanted me
to be what I'm not.

894
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:48,608
And I blame her
for the things in me I don't like.

895
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,126
Your house is cool.

896
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,322
Did you imagine
I'd have a house like that?

897
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,251
- No.
- And me?

898
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,360
- Am I like you imagined?
- No.

899
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,370
Is that good or bad?

900
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,362
It's good.

901
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,244
I was afraid I wouldn't like you.

902
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,886
Anytime you want to go to bed,
just tell me.

903
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,765
Pick the room you like best,
there are loads.

904
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,884
You don't have one with padded walls,
do you?

905
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,729
- Hello.
- Hi, there.

906
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,963
We prepared
something for you to eat.

907
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,243
Does your husband like beer or wine?

908
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,485
I don't think he'll come down.

909
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,411
He needs to rest.
He drove the whole way.

910
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,441
You can't eat on your own.
I'll sit with you.

911
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,129
Yes, well, good night.

912
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,927
If you need anything, let me know.

913
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,043
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

914
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,969
Ismael has been very good.

915
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,083
And he must have been really tired.

916
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,847
You have a very well behaved child.

917
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,291
What are you getting at?

918
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,566
I want to talk about ismael
and what will happen now.

919
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,083
Nothing will happen.

920
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,282
That's impossible. He knows us now.

921
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,205
My son has a life,

922
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,687
and he'll continue
to live it as before.

923
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,200
And félix?

924
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,041
Are you going to stop him
seeing his father?

925
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,211
My son has a father...

926
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,483
Who gave him his name and helped me
rear him. And that father isn't félix.

927
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,567
Don't you care what ismael thinks?

928
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:44,367
I'm going to protect him. Nothing
matters more to me than he does,

929
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,289
that he's well and grows up happy.

930
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,481
I'm sure félix thinks the same.

931
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:56,003
If it had been up to Felix,
ismael would never have been born.

932
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:35,002
I don't have much experience
as a father.

933
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,650
I should have got you a video game
or something like that.

934
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,409
- It doesn't matter. I'll teach you.
- Teach me what?

935
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,170
To be a father.

936
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,404
Where did you get that cigarette?

937
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,245
I always have a pack to hand.

938
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,850
In the practice, in the car.

939
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,882
I rarely touch them,
but from time to time...

940
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,206
When you said you'd stopped smoking,
I thought that...

941
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,205
That I was telling the truth?

942
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,202
I wasn't.

943
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,650
So now you know
you're not the only one with secrets.

944
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,446
What do you mean?

945
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,891
You always said that félix
wasn't important in your life.

946
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,044
It lasted three months.

947
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,485
I saw how you looked at him.

948
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,121
I'm tired.

949
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,161
This wasn't
one of the best days of my life.

950
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,285
I saw how you looked at him.

951
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,923
Félix is lsmael's biological father.

952
01:11:56,815 --> 01:11:59,175
He'll always be part of
the most wonderful thing in my life.

953
01:11:59,200 --> 01:11:59,962
I know.

954
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,845
You'll have to live with that,
because otherwise...

955
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,567
Otherwise, what?

956
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,365
I can't change what happened.

957
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,404
Félix is lsmael's father.

958
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,250
Until a few hours ago he was our son.

959
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,481
Now you talk as if
he had nothing to do with me.

960
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,049
He's got my surname.

961
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,171
That's not going to change.

962
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,605
But now he knows félix...

963
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:33,847
And what at?

964
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,765
What do you want me to do?

965
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,160
Stand aside?

966
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,281
See how they take away
the only thing I care about?

967
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:51,126
Please, alika, say something.

968
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,800
- I don't want to talk about this now.
- But I do!

969
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,327
What?

970
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,201
I didn't put ismael on the train.

971
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,209
Don't blame me
for 'what's happening.

972
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,245
And what is happening?

973
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,810
Because I don't understand.

974
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,921
Since I arrived here
I've become like...

975
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,730
A piece of furniture.

976
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,009
Is that my place in this story?

977
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,211
Look...

978
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,571
Until today I've been your husband
and lsmael's dad.

979
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,007
You have to decide
if you want that to continue.

980
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,126
You scared me!

981
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,322
What are you doing?
You're covered in grease.

982
01:14:28,655 --> 01:14:30,775
I couldn't sleep so I thought
I'd do something useful.

983
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,041
I didn't think it would make
so much noise when I turned it off.

984
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,129
- Do you know about boilers?
- No,

985
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:38,164
but there's nothing you can't fix
with a bit of lubrication.

986
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,287
Or with a hammer blow
in the right place.

987
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:51,084
No offense,
but I'd rather an expert saw it.

988
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,210
Right.
Are we talking about the boiler?

989
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,370
- Is this your room?
- We'll have a whiskey

990
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,450
and you can relax a bit, all right?

991
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,208
With those grease stains,

992
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,324
you're even more attractive.

993
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:13,762
What?

994
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,531
How long since you last screwed?

995
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:25,248
If you think I accepted a drink
to get into your bed, no.

996
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,803
Ok, it was just a question.

997
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,044
Let's go back to traumas,

998
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:32,288
they seem to interest you
more than sex.

999
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,682
- Excuse me, but I love sex.
- Really?

1000
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,087
Let's analyze what happened today.

1001
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,210
You USS an excuse

1002
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,971
to tum up at your son's house,
a son you rarely see.

1003
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,844
No, ismael is not an excuse.

1004
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,088
You pretend to have a sprain
'which no one believes.

1005
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,841
- But it really hurts...
- And at night, instead of sleeping,

1006
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,883
you go down to the basement

1007
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,606
to smear yourself

1008
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,165
with lubricant.

1009
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,840
Why don't you just admit
that you find me irresistible?

1010
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,602
What do you feel like?
I don't have much.

1011
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,406
- My house isn't like jordi's.
- What do you have?

1012
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,523
I don't think you'll like it.
Quince jelly.

1013
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,768
Really? I love it!

1014
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,485
- Have you no more games?
- Yes, there's a file,

1015
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:22,445
but they're old games
so don't criticize me.

1016
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,001
<i>You 're beautiful.</i>

1017
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,563
<i>You can? Be asleep!</i>

1018
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,687
<i>What?</i>

1019
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,445
<i>- You really want me to read to you?
- Yes.</i>

1020
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,604
<i>Bu! R's so long.</i>

1021
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,322
<i>We've got all the time in the world.</i>

1022
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,448
<i>We're going to be here
for five days.</i>

1023
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:03,926
<i>Hi stay.</i>

1024
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,201
<i>Let's see.</i>

1025
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,366
<i>“Call me ismael.</i>

1026
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,005
<i>Some years ago,</i>

1027
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,647
<i>having we or no money
in my purse</i>

1028
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,446
<i>and nothing particular
to interest me on shore,</i>

1029
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,880
<i>I thought
I would sail about</i> a <i>little</i>

1030
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,485
<i>and see the watery part
of the world.</i> '

1031
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,731
I loved her very much.

1032
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,003
- And her?
- I think she loved me.

1033
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,644
Why did you split up?

1034
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,243
It was my fault.

1035
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,285
Why did you never look for me?

1036
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,364
Because I'm a fool.

1037
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,403
Luckily you don't
take after me in that.

1038
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,964
I'm worried about félix.

1039
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,362
He really suffered over alika.

1040
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:41,800
Come on!

1041
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:46,524
At 20 you die and revive all the time.
He can't punish himself all his life

1042
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,882
because once
he was carried away by fear.

1043
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,251
I blame movies.

1044
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,401
They've done a lot of harm.
Love isn't that...

1045
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,570
Slushy, clingy thing
that ends with a stupid kiss

1046
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,888
and violins in the background.

1047
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:05,210
No, you can live without love
but not without food and a roof.

1048
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,129
And if you fall, you get up.

1049
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:10,244
It's happened to me 1,000 times
and look, here I am.

1050
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,122
That's why I brought him up
to be independent.

1051
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,121
Hey!

1052
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,680
- What's wrong?
- With me, you needn't pretend

1053
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,724
to be strong, insensitive, all that.

1054
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,321
If you go on like that, I get bored.

1055
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,521
I see.

1056
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,721
When did I last smoke one of these?

1057
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,206
When was it?

1058
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,528
He says that
I mined his father's life.

1059
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:51,885
What does he kmow'?

1060
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,084
And that I was never in love.

1061
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:59,570
He doesn't know vimat it's like
living with a depressive who...

1062
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,843
Pulls you down day after day,

1063
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,762
while you try to hide it
from your son.

1064
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,844
If I hadn't loved him...

1065
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:20,886
Here, this is poison.

1066
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,161
I feel dizzy.

1067
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:55,204
All right,
we'll leave the sex for another day.

1068
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:59,442
- If you want, I'll put on some music.
- And we'll dance.

1069
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,446
Did I say we'll dance? No, no, no.

1070
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:11,125
No, no, no.

1071
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:15,244
Yes, please. You can't refuse.
You asked for it.

1072
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,368
Didn't you sprain your ankle?

1073
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,686
Stop, alika.

1074
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,286
I don't want to.

1075
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,004
We shouldn't have stayed.

1076
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,730
I behaved like an idiot.

1077
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,924
I mow 'what's x-wrong with you.

1078
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:16,530
You don't. Even I don't know.

1079
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,091
Why don't you go upstairs?
Get some sleep.

1080
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:25,091
I'll get ismael and as soon
as we come back, we'll leave.

1081
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:32,725
- Is that what you want?
- Yes.

1082
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,169
I want to go back to our home

1083
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:38,124
and forget about all this.

1084
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,280
Are you sure?

1085
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,320
Yes.

1086
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,804
I was scared.

1087
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,251
I was scared.

1088
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:24,521
Couldn't you sleep?

1089
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,527
I'm a sleepwalker.

1090
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:32,484
- Does it scare you?
- Being a sleepwalker?

1091
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:37,362
The piano.
Why not throw it out the window'?

1092
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:39,529
- What an idea!
- Out with the piano!

1093
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,122
Why do you want a piano
if you don't play it?

1094
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,481
Well?

1095
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,845
- Are you going to tell me?
- Tell you what?

1096
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:54,401
What?

1097
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:58,609
You know all my family secrets,
I should know something about you.

1098
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,843
The truth is, a bit of sex
would have done wonders for us.

1099
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,723
I'll answer
all the questions you can ask

1100
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,809
- in one minute.
- One minute?

1101
01:28:12,655 --> 01:28:14,975
Why do you live alone?
What happened to you with the piano?

1102
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,331
And why do you always
look at my cleavage?

1103
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,249
And there are 30 seconds left.

1104
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:24,120
Why do I live alone?

1105
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,522
Isn't it more than demonstrated
that the couple

1106
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,802
is a factory
for making unhappy people?

1107
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,890
Touche'. And the piano?

1108
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:34,046
The piano...

1109
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:36,562
This piano...

1110
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,887
Knows I'm the worst musician
in the world.

1111
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,402
Know howl composed my big success?

1112
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,521
In a London pub after drinking

1113
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,927
eight pints of beer.

1114
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,808
I'd gone to an audition
for the philharmonic orchestra.

1115
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,402
I'd been preparing for two years

1116
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,641
and they didn't even take me
as a substitute.

1117
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:03,690
So, at the bar in the pub, drunk,

1118
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,962
I took a ballpoint and a napkin

1119
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:08,841
and started to minute the first thing
that came into my head to show

1120
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:11,002
my scorn for music.

1121
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:15,009
I vaguely remember that I was humming

1122
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:18,443
and some hooligans repeated it,
like at a concert.

1123
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,002
Pablo, a friend who was with me,

1124
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:25,370
recorded it without telling me,
and sent it everywhere.

1125
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,324
And, fuck me,

1126
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,683
three months later
the song was playing

1127
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,008
- on radios in half the world.
- Good lord!

1128
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:36,610
Even the pope in Rome knew it.

1129
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:38,811
And, then,

1130
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,328
you wouldn't believe the money I made.

1131
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,602
And I could buy the hotel.

1132
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:46,366
A napkin,

1133
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:49,241
a lousy napkin with a couple of notes,

1134
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,010
was my big success.

1135
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,604
I liked the idea
and I wanted to do it again.

1136
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,122
I went back to London,
back to the same pub,

1137
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:02,366
I got drunk the same way,
smudged thousands of napkins,

1138
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,211
I even hired some hooligans,

1139
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,851
but, you know,

1140
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,328
every time I tried
to write a new success,

1141
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,522
it became a new failure.

1142
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:14,686
And, well,

1143
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:18,330
your cleavage
isn't the best I've seen but...

1144
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:21,243
It has its charm.

1145
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:38,051
'Can you play?
- Can you?

1146
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,611
- Me?
- Play something.

1147
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:44,288
Go on, even if it's
"Happy Birthday to you".

1148
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,722
<i>I don't know at what moment
I decided to love you,</i>

1149
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,005
<i>if k was the day you appeared</i>

1150
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,965
<i>with your hair soaked by the rain,</i>

1151
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,686
<i>when I saw you
lying on my bed for the first time.</i>

1152
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:37,521
<i>What you see in me,
no one saw before.</i>

1153
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,722
<i>Mas bum with you.
'(Our disabled prince.</i>

1154
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:18,363
I've come for ismael.
We're leaving now.

1155
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,050
You kept it all this time?

1156
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,570
Don't do this to me.

1157
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,126
I have to go.

1158
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:35,882
I'm thirsty.

1159
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,084
Isma, love, we're leaving now.

1160
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:41,761
Already?

1161
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,486
Hurry, get a glass of water
and put on your shoes.

1162
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,289
I've never stopped loving you.

1163
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:02,844
I know you still love me.

1164
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:05,207
I know it.

1165
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:10,248
I'll never forget your expression
when I said I was pregnant.

1166
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:15,361
I was scared to see you again,
of what could happen to me if I did.

1167
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:18,087
Tell me nothing happened to you

1168
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:21,090
- and I'll leave right now.
- Yes, it happened.

1169
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:25,011
We been obsessed with you
all these years,

1170
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,926
but I hated the idea of being
unfaithful to Luis with your memory.

1171
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,441
Because he loves me too, truly,

1172
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:36,169
and with the kind of love I need.

1173
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,410
Now I'm going back home

1174
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,967
to carry on
with the life I left yesterday.

1175
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:44,091
Ismael had a right to meet you,

1176
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,928
and he's done that.

1177
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,604
If you want to be in touch with him
we can try it.

1178
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,487
I won't stop him getting to know you.

1179
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:56,650
He has that right.
But don't think for a minute

1180
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:58,729
that ismael will be
your way of having me again.

1181
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:01,362
Every time I look at him
I'll be seeing you.

1182
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:05,403
Forget me. I don't exist anymore.

1183
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:11,407
Then I'll have to think
that ismael was never born.

1184
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,370
Mom, let's go.

1185
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,971
- Ismael, say goodbye to félix.
- I don't want to, let's go!

1186
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,002
Ismael!

1187
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,450
He didn't mean what he said,

1188
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:40,844
he was talking about me, not you.

1189
01:35:45,038 --> 01:35:46,639
You must show me
something you've mitten.

1190
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,369
You must show me
something you've mitten.

1191
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,289
Ismael... ismael!

1192
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,562
- What happened?
- We're leaving.

1193
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:55,647
Luis!

1194
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:08,451
It'll be hard
to beat your pinball record.

1195
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:14,122
I'd have liked you
to be my grandmother.

1196
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,126
I am your grandmother.

1197
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:20,807
I don't know
what félix did or said to you.

1198
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:24,288
At times he's a bit awkward
with these things,

1199
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,163
- but I'm sure he loves you.
- I don't want to see him again.

1200
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:40,047
Go on, away you go-

1201
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:27,924
go and see félix.
He must be heartbroken.

1202
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:32,330
- No, I'm not going.
- Why?

1203
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:36,126
He's got a mother
who can look after him.

1204
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,607
I saw him pass by a while ago,
going to the school.

1205
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:13,920
What a fucking scene!

1206
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:18,569
Shit, it's crazy.

1207
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:25,482
- What happened?
- Same old thing.

1208
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:28,330
It's a real fuck-up.

1209
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:32,323
They came to arrest bonobo and when
he tried to escape they beat him up.

1210
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:35,364
- Go away, come back tomorrow.
- Excuse me...

1211
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,402
- Girls, where are you going?
- Excuse me,

1212
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:41,524
- I'm looking for félix ambrés.
- He's causing bother, like always.

1213
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:43,848
- What happened?
- Come back another day.

1214
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:46,168
Go home! Go home!

1215
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:51,687
You've got no right
to do what you're doing!

1216
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:53,291
You hit a minor in school!

1217
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:55,528
- Are you ok?
- Get the fuck out of here!

1218
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:58,371
Show me the court order
and your badge number!

1219
01:38:58,560 --> 01:38:59,686
Go to hell!

1220
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:07,205
- Chino, film his face!
- Get out of the fucking way!

1221
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,289
Ambrés, get out
and let them take him.

1222
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:13,246
Look what they did to his face!
We should report them!

1223
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,131
- Film them!
- That's enough!

1224
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:19,087
Chino, keep filming!

1225
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,090
- You animal!
- I'm sorry.

1226
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,248
No, not you.This animal!

1227
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,204
I pay your wages with my taxes!

1228
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,289
- And you treat us like this?
- Don't be fucking stupid.

1229
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:33,642
What are you doing?
This has nothing to do with you.

1230
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,047
- You think not?
- No, no, kids!

1231
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:39,045
Don't be provoked, kids!

1232
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:40,924
Raise your hands!

1233
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:42,246
Raise your hands!

1234
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:45,728
Don't play along with them!

1235
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:46,967
Raise your hands!

1236
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:49,766
Not you, chino! You keep filming!

1237
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,411
Let him go!

1238
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:54,571
- Felix, no!
- Let him go!

1239
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:56,808
I told you to let him go!

1240
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:59,805
- Film him, chino.
- I said, let him go!

1241
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,480
Are you going
to tell me what you did?

1242
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:17,361
What do I have to tell you?
No one asked you to interfere.

1243
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:19,449
If you hadn't insulted them
they wouldn't have arrested you.

1244
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:21,529
- He was an animal...
- Shut up!

1245
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:24,127
You've got no right.
Don't you see those kids adore you?

1246
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,560
Of course they do.

1247
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:28,127
I'm teaching them
they've got the same rights as you.

1248
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,846
- That's why we're all going to jail...
- Shut up.

1249
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:35,046
You've got no right to deprive
ismael of a father like you.

1250
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:37,129
Since when do you care about my life?

1251
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:42,291
- I've always cared.
- You should have shown it.

1252
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:45,209
We're not talking about us.

1253
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:49,208
We're talking about your son
and about you.

1254
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:51,682
What happened, nutter?

1255
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:55,843
- What did you do to ismael?
- I fucked it up.

1256
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,691
Well, go... and un-fuck it.

1257
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:06,767
I can't.

1258
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:12,561
Félix,

1259
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,046
once you lost the thing you loved most
out of fear.

1260
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,448
Are you going to let fear
choose for you again?

1261
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:23,480
- You've told me that a million times.
- Don't you understand "shut up"?

1262
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,286
I can't, really.

1263
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:34,611
What I did was terrible.

1264
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:38,327
He'll never want to see me again.

1265
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:45,051
Look in my eyes.

1266
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:48,970
You're getting on that train

1267
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:52,041
because if you don't I swear

1268
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:55,291
that I'll kick you on to it
so you can go after him.

1269
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:08,562
Mom...

1270
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:02,887
Ismael!

1271
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:06,287
Ismael!

1272
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:11,442
Ismael!

1273
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,725
If you walk that fast
I'll never catch up with you.
