<i>The one who is going to get hurt
the most is not me, it's the child!</i>

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,870
<i>That's what I hope for.</i>

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,760
<i>- Is Park Tae Yun the biological father?
- I don't remember a man like him.</i>

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,830
<i>Cha Ki Young is the face of my election!</i>

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,610
<i>Who do you think will suffer the most
if that paternity suit gets exposed?</i>

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,810
<i>Bring me scandalous pictures
that I can release to the media.</i>

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,130
<i>A bed scene would even be better.</i>

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,660
<i>Dad, it's Dan! I miss you!</i>

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,170
<i>It's been awhile since Cha Ki Young
has been living with Jo Eun Cha.</i>

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,610
<i>Everyone pretty much knows about it.</i>

12
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,450
<i>But why are you lingering in
front of her place like a fool?</i>

13
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,770
<i>It's difficult for you to raise
Dan in this kind of a situation.</i>

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,770
<i>Then are you saying they're going
to take the child away from her?</i>

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,030
<i>I'm not going to settle.
I'll accept the hearing.</i>

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,510
<i>I'll accept the hearing.</i>

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,830
<i>Episode 15</i>

18
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,250
Cha Ki Young, don't insult us!
Don't insult us! Don't insult us!

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,230
<i>Wait! Please say a word!</i>

20
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,970
<i>Is it true that you are the
plaintiff in this paternity suit?</i>

21
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,260
Yes.

22
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,940
<i>Then are you saying that you are the
biological father of Cha Ki Young's son?</i>

23
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,900
That is correct.

24
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,810
<i>Finally, Cha Ki Young's
sperm donor has arrived.</i>

25
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,690
- Please let me through.
- Look this way please!

26
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,320
Get out of my way!

27
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,810
Ki Young, are you okay?

28
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,800
I was hoping you could avoid those
protesters, but it looks like they got you.

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,910
I can't believe you're here.
I thought you would be busy.

30
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,830
I'll help you with your makeup.

31
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,790
At times like this, you have to
show everyone that you're confident.

32
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,130
Hello.

33
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,350
Hello.

34
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,680
Thank you for everything.

35
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,900
About what?

36
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,100
For looking out for Yun Hee.

37
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,590
Okay then, let's go ahead and confirm the
relationships for the parties in question.

38
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,890
The plaintiff, Park Tae Yun stated that
the defendant, Cha Ki Young claimed that

39
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,520
she conceived her son by sperm donation.
In fact, he is the biological father.

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,290
The plaintiff is requesting a change in
parental and custodial rights. Correct?

41
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,290
Yes.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,280
Most parents tend to share the parental
and custody rights in cases like this.

43
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,670
What was your reason for refusing
to settle during arbitration?

44
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,290
We believe that the
defendant, Cha Ki Young

45
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,800
no longer had the right to
claim parental authority

46
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,140
nor the capability of
sharing custodial rights.

47
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,980
How does she not have
the right or capability?

48
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,710
Your Honor, Cha Ki Young and I used to
love each other at one point in time.

49
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,370
She got pregnant.

50
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:35,040
However, she lied about getting an abortion
without even discussing it with me first.

51
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,910
This time, she lied about getting pregnant
by a sperm donation. She deceived me twice.

52
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,400
My ex-lover supposedly had an abortion

53
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,320
and then I had to face the reality
of her conception by an unknown donor.

54
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,360
In the end, I had no choice but
to break up with Cha Ki Young.

55
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,680
Not only did she destroy my character

56
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:10,610
she's also a mentally ill person who erased
all traces of the child's paternal lineage.

57
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,480
Your Honor, do you think it's possible...

58
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,840
to share parental rights
with a woman like this?

59
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,510
Ms. Cha Ki Young.

60
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,460
Have you ever been
diagnosed as mentally ill?

61
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,840
Do you think a mental patient
would be able to report

62
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,770
the nine o'clock news for
the past ten years by herself?

63
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,890
Then why did you do such a thing?

64
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,010
Unlike men, when women fall in love...

65
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,630
The responsibilities of birthing a
child and raising a child are vast.

66
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,080
However, all Park Tae Yun
did was spread his seed.

67
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,600
He is just typical man of this country who
had no intentions of taking responsibility.

68
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:56,200
On top of that, his family is
very old-fashioned and patriarchal.

69
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,950
They demanded that I give up my
hard-earned career to marry their son.

70
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:05,160
I felt that marrying Park Tae Yun was
impossible. I even tried aborting the baby.

71
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,090
But in the end,
I bowed down to life instead.

72
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,230
In order to protect my
child from Park Tae Yun's family...

73
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,070
I had no choice but to announce that my
pregnancy came from a sperm donation.

74
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,590
Just recently, Park Tae Yun's
family kidnapped my child.

75
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:30,230
Your Honor, do you think I would share
custody of my child with that kind of man?

76
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,750
Mr. Park Tae Yun, have you ever
kidnapped Ms. Cha Ki Young's child?

77
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:40,580
We're just taking back what is rightfully
ours! Why would that be called kidnapping?

78
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:47,110
If anything, that woman is the criminal!
She's the one who stole our seed from us!

79
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,840
Please be quiet!

80
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:54,580
Until this trial is over, Ms. Cha Ki Young
will have custody of Cha Dan.

81
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:00,510
Taking a minor without a mother's
permission is in fact kidnapping, Sir.

82
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,940
<i>[Did you sleep with that bastard?]</i>

83
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,600
<i>[Think whatever you want.]</i>

84
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,310
How could you do this to me?

85
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,460
What? Like you're not sleeping
with your female friends?

86
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,490
That bastard said that you
told him he was better than me.

87
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,970
That bastard was always better
than you, right from the beginning.

88
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,800
Please be quiet!

89
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,200
From looking at the records...

90
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,190
it's written that Ms. Hyun Myung Yi
initiated the kidnapping.

91
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,980
Can you explain to the
court why you did that?

92
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,420
Yes, Your Honor.

93
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,900
The implication that Park Tae Yun
did not want to take responsibility

94
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,560
for spreading his seed is just a
biased view from Ms. Cha Ki Young.

95
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:16,360
I also got pregnant out of wedlock,
and while Park Tae Yun didn't love me...

96
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:22,200
He's a responsible man who
chose to marry me despite that fact.

97
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,250
Also, stating that my in-laws are
old-fashioned and patriarchal...

98
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,830
They are just prejudiced
opinions of Ms. Cha Ki Young.

99
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,310
It is true that my in-laws
are a bit strict.

100
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:41,420
But I don't think they're better or worse
than the average family of this country.

101
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,910
Breaking off her engagement
with Park Tae Yun

102
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,260
and claiming that she got
pregnant by sperm donation....

103
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,300
These are just ramblings
of a mentally ill woman.

104
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,100
Ms. Hyun Myun Yi, my question
is why you kidnapped Cha Dan.

105
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,620
After Cha Ki Young ruined
my husband's reputation...

106
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,080
His mind and body were destroyed.

107
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,230
He was not able to settle down anywhere.
He roamed all over the world like a nomad.

108
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,160
In fact... I'm embarrassed to say this...

109
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,020
But ever since we got married, we haven't
shared a bed for the past three years.

110
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:28,890
What woman in this world would want
to raise a child that's not her own?

111
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,060
In order to save my
husband and the family...

112
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:41,870
I had no choice but to take back
the seed that was stolen from us.

113
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,570
This is a world where women abandon
their own children. Ms Hyun Myung Yi...

114
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,480
Do you think you'll be able
to raise someone else's child?

115
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,890
I am willing to sacrifice
myself for my family.

116
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,410
I believe our household will be a perfect
family as long as we bring back the child.

117
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,120
My mother-in-law is a good wife and
mother whom everyone acknowledges.

118
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:14,820
My father-in-law is a man with a strong
sense of responsibility for his family.

119
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,970
And through them, I learned that sacrifice
and duty are necessary for a happy family.

120
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,250
In order for children
to be raised properly...

121
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,930
It's important that they can look
up to their parents as a role model.

122
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,290
Cha Ki Young refused marriage and family.

123
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,440
Instead, her son has a surrogate father
whom she had and affair with.

124
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,630
Do you think he will be raised to be
a normal person from this situation?

125
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,390
Wait a minute, are you saying

126
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,730
that Ms. Cha Ki Young had
an affair with another man?

127
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:52,950
Your Honor, this man is the surrogate
father as well Cha Ki Young's lover.

128
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,000
I would like to call
Jo Eun Cha to the stand.

129
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,850
Fine. Let's take a short
recess first before we continue.

130
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,370
Good.

131
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,010
Judge Kim, what class
number did you graduate from?

132
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,200
- I'm from the 45th class.
- Oh really?

133
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,560
And I'm from the 48th class.

134
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,890
Goodness, I graduated way before you two.

135
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,880
We have many colleagues in our courthouse,
and we like to help each other out.

136
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,030
In other words, we like
to play hard to get, Sir.

137
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,290
Of course, as it should be.

138
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:33,920
Call the colleagues from our law school and
invite them to my guesthouse this weekend.

139
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,880
As you wish, Chairman.

140
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:45,250
Good. Your duty to uphold the ethics
of this country comes before the law.

141
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,450
I knew something fishy was going on.

142
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,510
But who would've thought our family
would be the victim of a child thief?

143
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,640
If a Park became a Cha

144
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,600
can you imagine the possibility
of incest occurring among relatives?

145
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,280
Chairman, you won't
have to worry

146
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,360
about parental authority
after Jo Eun Cha testifies.

147
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,810
Good.

148
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,890
I swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth.

149
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,450
Under pains and penalties of perjury.

150
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,070
Witness, Jo Eun Cha.

151
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,700
Mr. Jo Eun Cha, how did you
become Cha Dan's surrogate father?

152
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,260
Cha Ki Young begged me.

153
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:44,070
I kept refusing her...
but she seduced me with her body.

154
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,770
To me, she was strictly a colleague.

155
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,520
She even gave me a contract, stating...

156
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,200
that she would sleep
with me whenever I wanted.

157
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,840
That is absolutely...

158
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,250
I promised to testify this
information because...

159
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,480
I was offered a nomination to the
ruling party for this year's election....

160
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,620
By Chairman Park Kang Rok.

161
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,440
That piece of...

162
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,960
Before that...

163
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,270
Chairman Park....

164
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,100
Ordered me to kidnap Cha Dan.

165
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,570
I couldn't refuse him, so I went
ahead and attempted the kidnapping.

166
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,920
Granted... I did hesitate
at the last moment.

167
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,290
You piece of trash!
How could you do this to me?

168
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,110
What did I do to you that was so wrong?
How could you do this to us?

169
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,490
Please sit down.

170
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,390
It's true. I am nothing but trash!

171
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,460
In order to regain my former
position as an anchor...

172
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,450
I used Cha Ki Young's pregnancy.

173
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,830
And as soon as I returned as an anchor...

174
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,500
I tried to get rid of Cha Ki Young...

175
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,820
by using her pregnancy and
maternity leave as an excuse.

176
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,130
And when election time
was getting near again...

177
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,140
In order to gain the interest
of the female voters...

178
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,380
I volunteered to be Cha Dan's
surrogate father.

179
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,030
When men harass women
by acting all sexist...

180
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,820
It's because they're not confident.

181
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:48,270
I... also loved Cha Ki Young.

182
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,400
So, I kept doing despicable things
to her because I lacked confidence.

183
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,960
Ms. Cha Ki Young, I am truly sorry!

184
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,860
Well, that was a strange testimony.
But Mr. Jo Eun Cha...

185
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,760
It seems you and Ms. Cha Ki Young
were romantically involved.

186
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,500
Yes, that is correct.

187
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,840
It's been a long time now.

188
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,750
Since when?

189
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,960
Ever since I found out...

190
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,030
that she was pregnant.

191
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:52,790
I agree that the patriarchal
family system has a lot of problems.

192
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:59,560
But the majority of the population
is still living within this system.

193
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,070
By using the sperm donation as an excuse...

194
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:06,790
Ms. Cha Ki Young's was
stealing Mr. Park Tae Yun's seed...

195
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:13,410
To give an example, it's like an act of
terror against Korea's family system.

196
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:20,000
In addition, the moment this terrorist
deceived everyone with her lies...

197
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,940
She personally confessed to having
an affair with another man at this court.

198
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,400
We cannot allow a terrorist
to take care of Cha Dan.

199
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,520
Your Honor, we request that
you immediately strip away

200
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,590
Ms. Cha Ki Young's parental
and custodial rights

201
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:44,670
and return them to the
plaintiff, Mr. Park Tae Yun.

202
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,520
That is all.

203
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,440
A verdict will be given after two weeks.

204
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,880
Cha Ki Young, I'm sorry.

205
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,800
I wanted to be of some help
to you, but I screwed up again.

206
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,210
You and I should never
have met in the first place.

207
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,870
Please do me a favor
and get out of my life.

208
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,250
- It's Cha Ki Young!
- It's Anchor Cha Ki Young!

209
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,570
How dare you fool everyone! Where do get
off walking around with such arrogance?

210
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,070
- Do you think our family system is a joke?
- Hey!

211
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,100
Who the hell are you people? Where do
get off throwing rocks at this woman?

212
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,860
- This bastard is even worse!
- That's right!

213
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,080
Going from one side to the other!
You fickle bastard!

214
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,730
Die!

215
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,000
Leave her alone! Don't touch her!

216
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,580
You bastards!

217
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,850
How did Cha Ki Young
rob your sperm from you?

218
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,150
Did she dump you right away afterwards?

219
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,680
Mom, go home first.

220
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,970
What about you?

221
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,310
There's not enough space.
I'll just take my car.

222
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,290
Then find Tae Yun and
bring him home with you.

223
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,310
Why did you come here?

224
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,430
What is it?

225
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,230
That's not bad.
You came out pretty well.

226
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,780
Yes?

227
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,020
I'll be there in one hour.

228
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,180
What is it?

229
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,540
I'm really grateful for what you did for
me, so I made reservations at a restaurant.

230
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,270
They want us to come quickly.

231
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,950
You want to feed me?
Come to think of it, I'm pretty hungry.

232
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,090
- Let's go.
- Okay.

233
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,960
The whole world is out to get you!

234
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,010
You might get stoned again if you
continue to walk around in this state!

235
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,310
I know you hate me, but get in the car!
Do you want to get stoned to death?

236
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,920
I got fired.

237
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,080
And any chances of me getting elected to
the National Assembly are shot to hell.

238
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,680
But man, I feel so relieved!

239
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,720
It feels like a huge weight
has been lifted off my shoulders.

240
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,210
And most likely I'll have
to pay for my actions.

241
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,440
Aren't you hungry?
I'm starving.

242
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:27,000
Look at this pile of bones. You're still
alive Cha Ki Young. You're still alive.

243
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,260
Have another glass.

244
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,520
Here you go.

245
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,480
Eun Cha.

246
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:52,780
Most likely... Park Tae Yun
will take my Dan from me, right?

247
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,710
Probably.

248
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,790
The judges and the lawyers...

249
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,900
they're all Chairman Park's
colleagues and juniors.

250
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:08,060
Those people will end up working
at his company once they retire.

251
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,810
I can't let them take him away from me.

252
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,500
You can just get him back
again if that happens.

253
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,970
If the law is wrong then
it needs to be fixed!

254
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,800
Cha Dan...

255
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:22,870
You're the one who gave birth to him.
Just where would he go?

256
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,010
- Don't...
- Oh, come on!

257
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,130
- What are you doing?
- Oh my gosh, you scared me!

258
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,390
Can't you tell by just looking?

259
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,760
You and I are in the same position.

260
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,790
What are you doing right now?

261
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,160
What do you think?
I'm going to catch them commit adultery.

262
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,540
Several days ago...

263
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:05,300
a 27-year-old woman committed suicide a
month after getting fired from her job.

264
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,560
Why?

265
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,260
The company promised to renew her
contract, but they fired her instead.

266
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,150
Even so, how could she kill herself?

267
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,870
Us 20-year-olds, we all live
with that kind of insecurity.

268
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,570
Jobs are hard to come by, and I don't
know what it is that I should do.

269
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:26,790
I think that's why Cha Ki Young isn't
getting any support from the young people.

270
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,430
From our perspective...

271
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,030
this is a generation where you give up
on marriage if you don't have money.

272
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,790
Dumping a rich man and having a child on
her own? We find it foolish and illogical.

273
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,980
Well, I understand Cha Ki Young.

274
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:44,450
If I was pretty like her, I probably
would've done the exact same thing.

275
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,890
I mean, look at me.

276
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,110
I'll probably die without ever
getting a chance at marriage or motherhood.

277
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,310
Anyway... let's get going
since we're done eating.

278
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,850
- Would you like to collect points?
- What is that?

279
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,790
Just enter your email or phone number
on this tablet whenever you check out

280
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:15,660
to gain admission and points. It's a handy
membership service without a card.

281
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,840
- I'd like to register.
- Sure.

282
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,620
Please enter you cell phone number here.

283
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,290
What are you doing?

284
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,300
You always paid for everything.

285
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,430
I got a contract.

286
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:40,300
Hey... what am I supposed to do
if you do something cool like this?

287
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,140
Fine, the second round will be on me.

288
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:51,450
<i>Your smile has stolen my heart!</i>

289
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:58,420
<i>You have stolen my heart!</i>

290
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:05,300
<i>I love you so much!</i>

291
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,680
<i>Oh my love!</i>

292
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,410
Sometimes you falter with what
you're good at if you get nervous.

293
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,100
You were my dream woman
before we got married.

294
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:26,300
But after we got married,
I didn't want to be intimate with you

295
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,050
because I knew I could sleep
with you whenever I wanted to.

296
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,490
I guess that could happen.

297
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,440
But, now that we're divorced...

298
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,530
I want to sleep with you so bad,
but I can't and it's driving me crazy!

299
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,480
It's ridiculous because
you're still the same person.

300
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,540
That line... you bastard!

301
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,770
He said the same thing to me.

302
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,000
But aren't you two strangers now?

303
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,750
Can you still accuse him of adultery?

304
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,510
We lived together for seven years.

305
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,900
My lawyer said I can
charge him with adultery.

306
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,290
Should I try doing that, too?

307
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:06,020
She's cheating on me with her ex-husband.
I can accuse her with adultery, right?

308
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:12,450
What's taking you so long?
Hurry and come out!

309
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,230
I don't care if it's a lie.

310
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,950
So lie down, close your eyes, and
say you love me about a hundred times.

311
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:24,040
Then I might magically
appear right next to you.

312
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:30,160
Okay. Okay.

313
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,120
I love you. Na Yun Hee, I love you.

314
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,190
- Should we barge in right now?
- No!

315
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:51,980
Legally, it's really, really
difficult to prove adultery.

316
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,240
We have to catch them in
the act at the perfect time.

317
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,980
You kick the door open
and I'll record it, okay?

318
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,890
- Okay, okay.
- One, two, three!

319
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,720
What the heck? I can't find it!

320
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,690
- Hey!
- Oh my gosh!

321
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,120
- What is this? Oh my gosh!
- Ouch!

322
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,210
Ki Young...

323
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,980
Hello, Ma'am.

324
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:38,490
Ah, yes. You used to report the news with
Ki Young. You're Anchor Jo Eun Cha, right?

325
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,960
Yes, Ma'am.

326
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,150
- I went to her trial today.
- But the thing is...

327
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,860
she won't answer her phone at all and
I have no idea what happened to her.

328
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,580
It's been a very difficult
day for your daughter

329
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,960
and she'll be resting at
Announcer Na Yun Hee's place for a day.

330
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,270
She asked me to let you know.

331
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,030
Is that so?

332
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,590
That's a relief.

333
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:06,040
I was worried that something
had happened to her.

334
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,780
Please don't worry and sleep well.

335
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,020
- Yes, thank you.
- You're welcome.

336
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:30,540
Today... just eat, drink, and sleep well.

337
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,410
Get a good night's sleep and
wake up strong tomorrow.

338
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,090
They say not to trust a man who's
trying to climb up the ladder.

339
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:57,150
I can't believe Jo Eun Cha betrayed us.

340
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,390
Well, he destroyed his political
career before it could even start.

341
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:07,220
Sir, I'll make sure that he
can't even come near Yeouido.

342
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:12,390
In any case, I owe you.

343
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,570
I'd like to treat you to a meal and drinks.
What would you like to eat?

344
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,760
I don't think you will have to
worry about the parental rights.

345
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,690
But what would you like
to do about the custody?

346
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,760
Most parents usually share
custody of their children.

347
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,100
Child custody must
solely be in my possession.

348
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:49,140
In order for that to happen, you said
the woman must be financially unstable...

349
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,490
- and homeless.
- Yes, Sir.

350
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:56,960
Give the owner of Cha Ki Young's house
whatever amount they want and purchase it.

351
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,030
If the company moves to fire her

352
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:03,350
she'll have to repay the loan
she was granted as an employee.

353
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,680
I want Cha Ki Young penniless
and out on the streets

354
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,720
before the trial commences in two weeks.

355
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,150
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh,
I must be out of my mind!

356
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,170
Oh my gosh!

357
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,120
Seriously, I've lost my mind.

358
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,810
Look...

359
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:35,750
Did you come onto me first or did I?

360
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,220
I'm not sure.
I was too drunk.

361
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,530
But I do remember that we
partied until five in the morning.

362
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,250
Got it. I'm going to head out first, okay?

363
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,890
Let's leave together.

364
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,800
Aren't men supposed to leave first
after they sleep with a woman?

365
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:55,500
Only mannerless jerks do that.

366
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,020
That's what Jo Eun Cha did to you, huh?

367
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,540
Anyway, forget that you ever slept with
me once you leave this room, okay? Delete!

368
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,410
The deed is done. What is there to forget?

369
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,100
What is it?

370
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,930
Director.

371
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,010
Please spare us.

372
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,690
We beg you.

373
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:45,650
Then... does that mean you will no longer
associate yourselves with Jo Eun Cha?

374
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,360
Jo Eun Cha...

375
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,880
He can continue on
with his political career.

376
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,140
But we're reporters that can't
live without the news station.

377
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,970
Please save us.

378
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:06,090
How are all three of you going to prove
that you broke off from Jo Eun Cha?

379
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,170
How... how?

380
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:18,160
At the least, shouldn't you go ask him to
write an essay about saving you three?

381
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,950
Hello.

382
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:33,120
The dismissal procedure for Oh Dong Shik,
Kim Hyung Joon, and Park Sung Soo...

383
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:36,370
Please hold that off for now.

384
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,960
- Excuse me.
- Please excuse us.

385
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,480
<i>[Jo Eun Cha's date of dismissal:
November 10th.]</i>

386
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,740
[Cha Ki Young's date of dismissal:
November 10th.]

387
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,590
Yes?

388
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,760
<i>Cha Ki Young, you've been fired.</i>

389
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:13,010
<i>Stop by the station later to settle
your severance pay and turn in your ID.</i>

390
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,960
Sure.

391
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,580
- I'm from the realtor.
- What brings you here?

392
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,410
There's been a change in ownership, and the
owner wants you to move out immediately.

393
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,790
- Who is the new owner?
- Park Tae Yun.

394
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,510
You have until next week
to move everything out.

395
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:48,230
And it seems that your loan was
terminated after you were fired.

396
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,100
This is really convenient.

397
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,110
I need to maintain my
strength when times are tough.

398
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,650
Eun Cha.

399
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,840
Hey, what's up?

400
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:22,310
Is that young knucklehead still
drawing blood with his sword?

401
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,900
He hasn't chopped off your heads yet?

402
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,880
Eun Cha.

403
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:36,040
We need you... to write an essay
for Park Tae Yun about not firing us.

404
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,640
Sung Soo, what the heck is he saying?

405
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:44,040
I can't bring myself to ask you to do that.

406
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:50,850
So, we just wrote the essay for you.
All you have to do is copy and sign it.

407
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,000
You bastards, are you crazy?

408
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,030
Our lives are on the line right now.

409
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,270
We have to bow down to Park Tae Yun
as much as we can.

410
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,980
'Letter of apology.'

411
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,320
'Dear Director Park Tae Yun,
please find it in your heart to...'

412
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,320
'I'm sure that it would give you great
pleasure to cut off my tongue...'

413
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,890
'My atrocious behavior...'

414
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,480
You bastards!

415
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,660
Writing the truth is a reporter's life!

416
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,730
And you call yourself a reporter?

417
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,320
- Eun Cha!
- Eun Cha, please!

418
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,240
- Please do this for us!
- Please copy and sign it!

419
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,810
- Please save us!
- He's going to fire us!

420
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:50,490
It seems they're doing whatever
they can not to get fired.

421
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,840
There's a mock trial for Cha Ki Young
proceeding on the website now.

422
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,280
Director, it's a huge uproar.

423
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,610
People are voting left and right on
who should have custody of the child.

424
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,990
Who did you vote for?

425
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:09,550
The child belongs to Park Tae Yun,
of course. I'm for team Park all the way.

426
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,060
- What about you?
- I voted for Park Tae Yun as well.

427
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,470
- What about the female reporters?
- Excuse me?

428
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,870
Cha Ki Young is the one who gave birth to
her son. Of course she should have custody.

429
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:29,780
- Did you guys vote?
- Excuse me?

430
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,800
Vote for what, Sir?

431
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,920
You rascals.

432
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,220
Should Cha Ki Young's child be
named Cha Dan or Park Eun Chil?

433
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,890
Park Eun Chil, of course!

434
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,250
<i>[Park Tae Yun vs. Cha Ki Young.
Just who does this child belong to?]</i>

435
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:06,080
Even if you get caught by a tiger,
there is always a way to escape.

436
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:13,190
Just what kind of message is
this mock trial trying to send me?

437
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:16,340
<i>[Former Channel Korea Anchorwoman
Cha Ki Young's first paternity trial!]</i>

438
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,560
I assume you fired Cha Ki Young?

439
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,070
Yes.

440
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,190
And did you evict her from the studio?

441
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:26,980
I plan on evicting her on the day
of the hearing, which is today.

442
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,500
Pictures of Eun Chil have already
been exposed to the media.

443
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,680
It's going to be difficult for
him to attend school in Korea.

444
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,610
What do you propose?

445
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:37,040
Have him study abroad for five years.

446
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,720
No one will be able to recognize
him when he returns at that time.

447
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,160
Find the best boarding school in America.

448
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,220
That's actually for the best.

449
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,940
These pictures will be important
evidence for us at court.

450
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:58,830
Being unable to protect the child from the
media makes her look like a bad mother.

451
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,250
Mom, what are you doing?

452
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:18,140
I'm praying that you win the trial.

453
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:22,210
There's not a single
person who's on our side.

454
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:25,110
And there was no other solution.

455
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,420
I'll see you later.

456
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,990
I'm here for you, Mom. Be strong.

457
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,450
I'll be back.

458
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,590
- Pack everything up!
- Who are you?

459
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:53,320
Move everything out! Quickly!

460
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,240
What in the world are you doing?

461
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,170
The owner said you failed to
move out on the promised date

462
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,010
so he ordered us to
remove all your belongings.

463
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:05,180
What is all this?
What's going on right now?

464
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,960
Let's get the people out first!

465
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,100
- Let go!
- Come out.

466
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,870
- Oh my goodness, let go!
- Grandma, I'm scared.

467
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,470
- Chan! Chan!
- Let's go.

468
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,790
Let go of me!

469
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,240
Let go! Let go of us!

470
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,350
Oh my gosh!

471
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:32,180
How could he do this to us?
This isn't right!

472
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,930
Open the door!

473
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:39,100
- Cha Ki Young, apologize!
- Apologize! Apologize!

474
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:45,010
- Burn Cha Ki Young at the stake!
- Burn her! Burn her!

475
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:54,950
Eun Chil! Goodness, my precious baby!

476
00:38:54,950 --> 00:39:00,010
Grandpa will take you home soon,
so just wait a little bit longer, okay?

477
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:03,580
- Yes, Grandpa.
- My precious baby. Good.

478
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,260
Grandpa? Who are you calling grandpa?

479
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,700
Joon Young... please forgive me, okay?

480
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:23,100
Just wait, because the next
person to go on trial is us.

481
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,970
Due to the defendant's
complicated personal life...

482
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:55,770
She exposed pictures of her son to the
whole country without any protection.

483
00:39:55,770 --> 00:40:00,170
Also, she does not have a
job or a place of residency.

484
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:09,170
Ultimately, the defendant has every reason
to lose her rights as a parent.

485
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:13,920
This is the news station's motion
for dismissal of the defendant.

486
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,040
A termination of her lease
contract from the realtor.

487
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,970
A revoked mortgage loan from the bank.

488
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,180
Also, I would like to submit
these pictures as evidence.

489
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:36,480
If the defendant has anything to say,
please do so now.

490
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,490
I... only chose to have a
child instead of marriage.

491
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:52,120
And foolishly, I still don't believe my
decision caused any disturbance to society

492
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:56,200
nor did it inflict harm
to my child's future.

493
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,400
Even at this moment in court,
I don't believe I made the wrong choice.

494
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:06,810
I only followed my instincts as a
woman who wanted a child of her own.

495
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:11,570
And the constitution ensures that
every citizen has a right to be happy.

496
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:15,490
The belief that an ideal family
consists of a father and a mother

497
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:19,340
and that a single parent
home is considered abnormal.

498
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,840
I don't believe in that.

499
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,520
What children need the most is love.

500
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,920
And I love my child more than my own life.

501
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:41,250
However, I am truly sorry for
lying about the sperm donation.

502
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,610
I will go ahead and pass judgment.

503
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,030
According to the
Civil Law Act, article 913.

504
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:58,610
The person with parental authority has a
duty to protect and care for their child.

505
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,590
According to the
Civil Law Act, article 924.

506
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:04,700
A change in custody may be
ordained if the parent in question

507
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,220
is deemed unfit to carry out those duties.

508
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,760
Ms. Cha Ki Young has claimed parental
and custodial rights under false pretenses.

509
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,080
For the sake of the child's welfare...

510
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,090
I hereby declare that those rights
be divested from Ms. Cha Ki Young.

511
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:23,970
Parental and custodial rights will be
granted to the plaintiff, Mr. Park Tae Yun.

512
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,790
Unbelievable! That's not right!

513
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,810
How could you pass a
ridiculous verdict like this?

514
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:43,600
- Mom!
- Eun Chil!

515
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:48,270
My daughter is the one who gave
birth to him! What did you do?

516
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,810
Take him quickly!

517
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:59,900
My daughter will die if
you take him away from her!

518
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:06,170
- Eun Chil, let's go home.
- Mom!

519
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,840
- Mom.
- Everything will be all right.

520
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:15,880
I never dreamed that we
would be separated today!

521
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,450
You have to give the mother and
child some time to say goodbye!

522
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:23,500
Please don't take him away like this!

523
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,270
- Mom!
- Father.

524
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,900
Give them some time to
say goodbye to one another.

525
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,040
And what if she tries to take him?

526
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,790
I'll make sure Eun Chil comes home with me.

527
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,760
- Bring your daughter outside.
- Okay.

528
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,580
Mom!

529
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,560
Ki Young, what are we going to do?

530
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,560
Ki Young, let's appeal this. Huh?

531
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:59,700
And if it does get appealed...
do you think I can win?

532
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:05,810
And if I win... do you think I'll
be able to raise Dan in this country?

533
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,200
Yun Hee.

534
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,810
I lost.

535
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:16,970
I've been shattered to pieces...
by the deeply-rooted patriarchal system.

536
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,620
Dan is waiting outside for you.

537
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,450
At least say a final farewell
before you two separate.

538
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,590
- I don't want to see him.
- Why?

539
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:39,160
I want to send him off with a smile...
but I don't think I can do that.

540
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:46,350
Dan will only remember me crying if
I say goodbye to him in this state.

541
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,550
Mom, you send him off for me.

542
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,050
Mom!

543
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,900
Mom!

544
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:17,740
Mom!

545
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:23,180
Cha Ki Young's parental rights
have been taken away from her!

546
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,770
Let's go back to the countryside.

547
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:36,360
I have a lot of things to take care of.
You go first.

548
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:41,340
Let's request another hearing
and get our Dan back, okay?

549
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,200
Mom, please!

550
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,260
The thought of leaving you here all
alone is making it hard for me to go.

551
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:02,050
Mom, I'll be okay. Now go.

552
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,310
<i>Today, I witnessed the
legal system of this country</i>

553
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:36,880
<i>snatch away a little boy
from his mother's arms.</i>

554
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,660
<i>Anchor Cha, what's wrong?
What's going on?</i>

555
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,620
<i>As the whole country knows, Cha Ki Young
conceived out of wedlock.</i>

556
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,490
<i>She was harassed every day
by her fellow co-anchor.</i>

557
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,130
<i>Due to sudden stress, she was in
danger of miscarrying her baby.</i>

558
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:55,760
<i>And her water even broke
during a live broadcast.</i>

559
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,880
<i>Fortunately, she safely
gave birth to her child.</i>

560
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:03,880
<i>I confess...
that I was not her friend, but a foe.</i>

561
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,670
<i>I was an eye witness to Cha Ki Young's
whole pregnancy and delivery.</i>

562
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:13,620
<i>That warm feeling of her
water splashing onto my feet...</i>

563
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,760
<i>And the overwhelming joy of
cutting the baby's umbilical cord...</i>

564
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,370
<i>It still feels as if it
just happened yesterday.</i>

565
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,210
<i>The legal system of the
Republic of Korea....</i>

566
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:30,070
<i>decided that this child... that this
little boy is not Cha Ki Young's child.</i>

567
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:36,500
<i>After delivering her child, she went
from being the best anchorwoman in Korea</i>

568
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,280
<i>to the first person on
the list in getting fired.</i>

569
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,850
<i>Just for raising her son
for the past three years.</i>

570
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,530
<i>All he did was to spread his seed.</i>

571
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:50,090
<i>But if custody is granted to the father
for the sole reason of being a man....</i>

572
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:54,510
<i>Then this law needs to
be abolished immediately.</i>

573
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:58,790
<i>Let's return the child to Cha Ki Young.</i>

574
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:06,870
Right. This site should
be named 'Cha Ah Dol.'

575
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,210
'Cha Ah Dol.'

576
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,990
Why are you sitting here like this?

577
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,160
I got evicted by the owner.

578
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,670
Who is the owner?

579
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,550
Park Tae Yun.

580
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:30,310
Are you saying he bought this studio just
so he could take away your parental rights?

581
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:34,420
Wow, he is really something.

582
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,210
Eun Cha.

583
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,790
Huh?

584
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:40,910
- Let's get married.
- What?

585
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,360
Marry me.

586
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,990
But you hate marriage.

587
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:52,560
People treated me like I was mentally ill
because I didn't get married.

588
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,840
My son was taken away from me.

589
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:58,380
If we get married...

590
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:03,720
My Dan...
do you think I'll be able to get him back?

591
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,380
Because I'm not married...

592
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,060
The child I gave birth to...

593
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:14,180
They say he isn't mine.

594
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:18,530
Eun Cha.

595
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,500
Let's get married.

596
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:56,050
You can stay here until you
find a place of your own.

597
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:58,960
I like sleeping on the sofa,
so you sleep on the bed.

598
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:11,120
Don't mind me. I have a habit of
rinsing my mouth before I go to bed.

599
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:21,810
Eun Cha, why did you take my side?

600
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,840
I'm not even worth taking
advantage of anymore.

601
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,070
The whole world abandoned me.

602
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:35,400
I just don't understand why you took
my side when you wanted to see me fall.

603
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:40,030
Have you ever seen me help anyone for free?

604
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:44,690
I'm helping you because
I still find you useful.

605
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:46,730
What about you?

606
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:51,440
Why haven't you given me the
boot when I'm always using you?

607
00:50:56,110 --> 00:51:03,590
Strangely, I feel comfortable
and peaceful whenever I see you.

608
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,700
The great and mighty Cha Ki Young...

609
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:24,340
is homeless and stuck with a loser like me.

610
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:36,500
The great and mighty Cha Ki Young...

611
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:44,140
is homeless and stuck with a loser like me.

612
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:04,200
- Father, what about Sun Nyeo?
- We don't need a daughter!

613
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,440
She'll be a stranger once
she gets married, anyway.

614
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:12,740
<i>Okay, let's begin.
Please look this way. One, two, three!</i>

615

<i>[Candidacy Registration.]</i>

616
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,070
Jo Eun Cha!

617
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,740
Anchor Jo, this is quite unexpected.

618
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,980
Why did you decide to run for
election as an independent candidate?

619
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,750
The ruling party or whatnot.

620
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:31,500
They said they can't
support an outcast like me.

621
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:37,040
What's your reason for running against
Assemblyman Kim in the same district?

622
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:43,060
Isn't it because he eliminated you from the
ruling party and you're out for revenge?

623
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:47,800
It feels the same as if I applied to
Seoul University, but I got denied.

624
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,180
If I'm going to lose, I might
as well go up against a giant.

625
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:02,490
Sit down. Let's eat together.

626
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,160
- That's okay, Father.
- Sit down.

627
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,430
You're a part of this family now.
Let's eat together.

628
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:13,250
Okay.

629
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:17,360
Please bring another setting
and prepare a plate for Myung Yi.

630
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,530
- I'll do it.
- It's fine. Sit down.

631
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,130
Here you go.

632
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:37,220
Father, if you've taken away the parental
and custodial rights from Cha Ki Young

633
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,690
Shouldn't you at least
give her visitation rights?

634
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:42,700
At least let him see
his mother once a month.

635
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:45,400
Seriously, he's going to go into
depression if this continues.

636
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:50,090
Stop talking nonsense! You just focus
on getting married and having a baby!

637
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,560
Oh my gosh, you scared me.

638
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:16,900
Let's get over a million.

639
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,140
Who are you?

640
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:35,810
- We're from the 'Yeo Heng Man' group.
- What do you want?

641
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,980
You captured our hearts
after we saw this.

642
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,730
Anchor Jo, we thought you
were just a handsome macho.

643
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,380
But we had no idea that you
really cared about us women!

644
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:51,730
We also heard that you were the only one
who was on Cha Ki Young's side at court.

645
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:56,250
Because of that, you lost your job and the
politicians have turned their backs on you.

646
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,800
I can't believe you're eating
black bean noodles all by yourself.

647
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,300
Jo Eun Cha, we're so sorry.
Thank you so much.

648
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:06,640
Oh, not at all.

649
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:11,500
Stop crying, we're not at a funeral.
Let's get started.

650
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:14,820
What is all this?

651
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:19,880
We volunteered to help you with your
election campaign. That's why we're here.

652
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,310
If you want to cut out the rumors

653
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,200
you have to start gaining sympathy
from the people around you first.

654
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:31,020
First, let's pass around this rice cake
to all your neighbors in this building.

655
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:34,310
Thank you so much!

656
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,740
- Hey, Yong Suk!
<i>- We need to talk.</i>

657
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:03,460
You're not getting any younger,
so try to restrain yourself

658
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,340
from displaying those kind
of emotions, okay? It's disgusting!

659
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,520
Get lost.

660
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:15,870
<i>- Sun Nyeo!</i>
- Pedro, I'm pregnant!

661
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:20,360
If you want to run away, go ahead.
I'll have this baby with or without you.

662
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:28,790
Use a borrowed sword? So bring in
an enemy from a rival studio?

663
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:32,210
Simply put, it's similar
to a music program.

664
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:36,650
So we want to show the audience's
reaction while doing a live talk show.

665
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:41,800
That's a good idea, but you know I can't go
on live TV. It's against election policy.

666
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,360
Why would you come out?
It should be Cha Ki Young.

667
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,030
You honestly think she would agree to that?
It's just adding salt to her wounds.

668
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,600
If you can't cast her, then just
forget this whole proposal.

669
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:56,130
Eun Cha, I'm going to give
you some political advice.

670
00:56:56,130 --> 00:57:00,480
Sun Tzu's 'Art of War' says that
you 'kill with a borrowed sword.'

671
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:03,500
It means you attack the enemy
by using someone else's strength.

672
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,060
If the show becomes a hit
by casting Cha Ki Young...

673
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:08,170
Where do you think all
that praise will go to?

674
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:10,470
It goes right to you.

675
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:13,530
You'll be campaigning for your
election without breaking the rules.

678
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:16,850
Answer me.

679
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,630
Why aren't you coming home?

680
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:25,350
Do you want me to be a
bad stepmother to Eun Chil?

681
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,850
By any chance...

682
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:32,040
are you upset that you
could only steal the child...

683
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:35,360
when all you wanted was
Cha Ki Young's love. Is that it?

684
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,660
When you hurt the one you love...

685
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,990
You end up hurting more.

686
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:58,670
Do feel like dying after what
you've done to Cha Ki Young?

687

Turn off the lights on your way out.

accept you as my co-anchor!

Are you just going to give up like this?

697
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:51,200
You need to get Dan back!

698

But...

699
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:56,220
Dan will have hope if you
show him that you're alive.

01:02:56,220 --> 01:03:00,920
Also, the money. You know what this
means if you take this on, right?
