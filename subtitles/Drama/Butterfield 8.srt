1
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,950
Liggett.

2
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,749
Liggett?

3
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:20,198
- Good morning, Mr. Liggett.
- Morning.

4
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:26,655
Butterfield 8? Hi, it's Gloria.
Any messages?

5
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:28,852
Johnny.

6
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:30,226
George.

7
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:32,362
Listen...

8
00:09:32,763 --> 00:09:37,224
...a Mr. Liggett will call sometime
today. He might use Mr. L.

9
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:39,233
Find me wherever I am.

10
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,437
This is one call I want to take
personally and immediately.

11
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:45,371
Okay, bye-bye.

12
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,809
Taxi!

13
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:32,053
38 Horatio Street, please.
Double your tip for a cigarette.

14
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:39,796
What's the matter, you crazy?

15
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:45,629
You're in good voice this morning.

16
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:33,381
I'm from the Census Bureau.

17
00:11:35,186 --> 00:11:36,415
Good morning.

18
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:39,516
How many persons
do you have living here?

19
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:41,425
Just one. Me.

20
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,356
Well, that's not nearly enough.

21
00:11:45,763 --> 00:11:48,096
- You working?
- Trying to.

22
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:49,824
Tomorrow's arrangements.

23
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:52,659
Tribute.

24
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:56,800
- To what?
- Your faith, hope and charity.

25
00:11:57,942 --> 00:12:00,241
Sunday morning and scotch
on your breath?

26
00:12:00,444 --> 00:12:02,538
Well, it's good scotch.
Twenty years old.

27
00:12:02,746 --> 00:12:03,736
And cigar smoke?

28
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:06,907
I always said I'd try anything once.

29
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:08,809
Ever try common sense?

30
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,045
Only in desperation.

31
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:20,396
Notice anything unusual
about me this morning?

32
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:22,123
I wish I could.

33
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:25,333
Look.

34
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,006
Well, look!

35
00:12:32,843 --> 00:12:35,074
You're panting to tell me
where you got it.

36
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,879
I stole it.

37
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:40,017
Sure you did. It figures.

38
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:44,552
Oh, not for real. Just long enough
to get even with somebody.

39
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:46,314
Even for what?

40
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:48,356
Somebody made me so damn mad.

41
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,220
He left me money.
He actually left me money.

42
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,035
- What would you have done?
- I don't know.

43
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,970
My work is designed so people
will leave me money.

44
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,075
This wasn't work.

45
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,682
Besides, my dress was torn.

46
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:15,282
I had nothing to wear...

47
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,647
...so I borrowed something
spiteful and elegant.

48
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:22,723
Liggett.

49
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,328
Weston Ansbury Liggett.

50
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:30,697
- Do you know him?
- Heard of him. He's very social.

51
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:32,529
And very Yale.

52
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:35,433
What's with you and Yale?
Always Yale.

53
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,131
- It's the last college left.
- Why?

54
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,709
I started with Amherst, and I worked
my way through the alphabet to Yale.

55
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:45,348
I'm stuck there.

56
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:49,619
Of course, I could work
backwards again.

57
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:52,680
Did he tell you about his wife?

58
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,652
- Killjoy.
- I hear he's a lush.

59
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,088
A rumor of little mind.

60
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:00,392
We did have a drink last night.

61
00:14:00,598 --> 00:14:03,397
- One?
- A dozen maybe.

62
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:07,094
And this morning you stagger
out of his apartment. Charming.

63
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,339
Funny thing, I don't even
remember going there.

64
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,705
Better than sleeping pills.

65
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:22,986
Can I help with anything?

66
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:39,070
Could I help you with anything?

67
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:42,066
Housework?

68
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:47,210
You put that coat back on.

69
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:49,408
Why?

70
00:14:50,314 --> 00:14:53,409
Half-dressed women make it
difficult to concentrate.

71
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:55,415
Well, then don't.

72
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:03,621
Don't think of me as a woman.

73
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,426
After all, we're just
like brother and sister.

74
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:08,758
Remember?

75
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:16,568
You're mad at me this morning.

76
00:15:16,774 --> 00:15:18,538
Put the coat on!

77
00:15:24,982 --> 00:15:26,416
Why this morning?

78
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:31,418
Because I'm sick of seeing you
boozed up, burned out and ugly!

79
00:15:32,956 --> 00:15:34,720
Sick for me or sick for you?

80
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:37,394
For you.
For everything you're wasting.

81
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,562
Why do you come here like this?

82
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,999
Where have I always come, Steve?

83
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:50,263
At least I can be honest with you.

84
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:53,740
Start being honest with yourself.

85
00:15:53,944 --> 00:15:57,506
You're making a mess out of your life
and forcing me to watch it.

86
00:15:59,316 --> 00:16:01,581
- Do you want me to go?
- Yes!

87
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,411
- For good?
- Yes!

88
00:16:11,995 --> 00:16:12,963
No.

89
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,141
It's terrible, isn't it?

90
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,346
I say "yes" too much when I shouldn't.

91
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:36,082
And you say "no" too much
when you shouldn't.

92
00:16:38,722 --> 00:16:41,419
But you're not nearly as mad
as you pretend to be.

93
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:43,357
I try to be.

94
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,796
Hungry?

95
00:16:50,534 --> 00:16:51,968
Ravenous.

96
00:16:59,943 --> 00:17:02,708
Now, the problem is,
how do I get home?

97
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,072
Car's outside. You drive.

98
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:09,285
- By the way, thanks for the use of it.
- Anytime.

99
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:15,091
What I mean is, what's my mother gonna
think if I show up dressed like this?

100
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:17,318
Your mother knows everything
about you.

101
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:19,724
That may be so,
but we never admit it.

102
00:17:20,464 --> 00:17:22,956
I'm still her innocent little girl.

103
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,501
And she's my dear, sweet
cookie-baking mother.

104
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:30,765
So go home, give her an innocent
smile and have a cookie.

105
00:17:31,775 --> 00:17:33,038
And tell her the truth.

106
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:35,542
If I tell her the truth,
I'll have to move out.

107
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:39,412
That's what normally happens
when people grow up.

108
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:42,753
If I left, she'd be lonesome.

109
00:17:42,953 --> 00:17:45,946
I'm all she has, so we have
to lie to each other.

110
00:17:46,156 --> 00:17:48,785
What does your analyst say
about all this?

111
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:52,019
I only tell Dr. Tredman
what I think he ought to hear.

112
00:17:52,229 --> 00:17:54,061
That's very intelligent.

113
00:17:54,264 --> 00:17:57,462
If I were intelligent,
I wouldn't need a psychiatrist.

114
00:17:59,102 --> 00:18:02,334
Listen, where am I gonna find
a dress to wear on Sunday?

115
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,802
How would I know?

116
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,778
Your girlfriend, Norma,
is almost my size.

117
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,748
You expect me to ask Norma to bring
her clothes over here to put on you?

118
00:18:14,952 --> 00:18:17,444
It would certainly get me
out of a jam.

119
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:19,179
And put me in one.

120
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:23,122
Listen to old Gloria.

121
00:18:23,327 --> 00:18:25,990
The greater the sacrifice
you ask a woman to make...

122
00:18:26,196 --> 00:18:29,189
...the more she knows
you love her. Honestly.

123
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:48,750
<i>Hello?</i>

124
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,049
Hello, Norma?

125
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,108
Problems, Liggett?

126
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:15,338
You haven't said a word
since we left the city.

127
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,612
Bing...

128
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:21,485
...you know three of the most
overrated things in this world?

129
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,748
Home loving, home cooking
and security.

130
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,823
That should be over
the doorway of The Stork Club.

131
00:19:29,026 --> 00:19:31,689
It should be over the doorway
of my apartment.

132
00:19:31,895 --> 00:19:34,922
Oh, come on, Ligg.
You've got everything.

133
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:37,461
Lots of people would envy you.

134
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:39,997
But am I happy?

135
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:41,831
Obviously not.

136
00:19:43,907 --> 00:19:45,432
Ever wonder why?

137
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:47,367
I have.

138
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:53,373
Can you take it from
an old fraternity brother?

139
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,181
You're a heel.

140
00:19:57,688 --> 00:19:59,919
A low-down, rotten heel.

141
00:20:00,624 --> 00:20:04,686
Anything doesn't go your way,
anything you can't have, you destroy.

142
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,758
I've known you all these years...

143
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,993
...and I never realized
you despise me.

144
00:20:13,203 --> 00:20:17,334
If I really despised you, I could
never tell you what I think of you.

145
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,004
Tell me.

146
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:27,012
You married a lovely woman,
and you mistreat her...

147
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:29,277
...because you blame her
for your life.

148
00:20:29,486 --> 00:20:31,751
Drinking, letching and lying.

149
00:20:31,955 --> 00:20:33,719
You won't face the truth.

150
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:38,794
- And what is this so-called truth?
- You find it out yourself.

151
00:20:38,996 --> 00:20:41,431
- Tell me.
- It wouldn't be any good.

152
00:20:41,932 --> 00:20:45,164
Go out and earn it the way
everybody else does.

153
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:51,567
The offer is still open.

154
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:56,210
You could come back as a law partner
with me anytime.

155
00:20:59,316 --> 00:21:02,548
I wouldn't join
the Foreign Legion with you.

156
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:06,588
Pull!

157
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,891
Emily.

158
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:12,118
Yes, darling?

159
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,293
How's your mother?

160
00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:17,829
She's doing well, thank you.
She's getting much stronger.

161
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:20,300
When are you coming back to town?

162
00:21:21,004 --> 00:21:22,563
Soon as I can.

163
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:26,400
- Why? You getting lonesome?
- Sometimes.

164
00:21:27,944 --> 00:21:31,938
The question was more one
of curiosity than passion.

165
00:21:39,489 --> 00:21:40,513
Pull!

166
00:21:45,328 --> 00:21:47,058
I have to get back to town
after lunch.

167
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:50,798
But I invited the Farleys
for dinner tonight.

168
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:53,266
My apologies to the Farleys.

169
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,605
Cliff Holbrook's in town.

170
00:21:56,606 --> 00:22:00,702
And the court jester of the chemical
industry has to keep him laughing.

171
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,152
Pull!

172
00:22:15,258 --> 00:22:17,386
As vice president
in charge of nonsense...

173
00:22:17,594 --> 00:22:20,996
...I have to keep a $6 million
customer happy, don't I?

174
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,563
Why don't you send someone
less important in the company?

175
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,399
There isn't anybody
less important than me.

176
00:22:31,408 --> 00:22:32,239
Pull!

177
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,546
Darling?

178
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,712
Will you be charming
at the country club today?

179
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:48,150
I know you're always charming,
but will you be especially so?

180
00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:49,223
Why?

181
00:22:49,426 --> 00:22:53,921
I was asked if you'd consider being
elected to the board of governors.

182
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:57,795
Why me? Nobody on that board
is under 60.

183
00:22:58,902 --> 00:23:02,168
Isn't that where aging,
useless executives go to die?

184
00:23:02,372 --> 00:23:04,841
Maybe they want to get
some young blood on it.

185
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:09,570
Or maybe they see me as just
another aging, useless executive.

186
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,215
Why do you say such cruel
things about yourself?

187
00:23:12,415 --> 00:23:15,510
To beat everybody, including you,
to the punch.

188
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,419
Pull!

189
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:28,622
Somebody at the cleaners
seems to have left a pin in it.

190
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,357
I know how embarrassed you must be.

191
00:23:31,568 --> 00:23:33,196
I'll speak to them.

192
00:23:33,403 --> 00:23:35,872
Really, this is terribly sweet of you.

193
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:40,837
Just remember that suit has led
a sheltered life. It shocks easily.

194
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:45,081
Then it's time it had
a little adventure.

195
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:50,786
By the way, just for the record,
what did happen to your dress?

196
00:23:51,154 --> 00:23:54,613
Well, it's a funny thing.
One minute it was there...

197
00:23:54,825 --> 00:23:56,487
...and the next minute
it wasn't.

198
00:23:56,693 --> 00:23:59,595
Much like your virtue, I presume.

199
00:24:01,097 --> 00:24:02,429
Am I wrong?

200
00:24:02,632 --> 00:24:03,691
Somehow...

201
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,132
...I get the feeling
that you don't like me.

202
00:24:07,537 --> 00:24:10,564
And I tried so hard to conceal it.

203
00:24:11,842 --> 00:24:13,276
Why?

204
00:24:13,476 --> 00:24:15,445
You're Steve's girl.

205
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,216
I'm just an old friend.

206
00:24:19,683 --> 00:24:22,084
Well, listen, old friend,
it's about time--

207
00:24:22,285 --> 00:24:23,150
Are you decent?

208
00:24:23,353 --> 00:24:24,514
I am.

209
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,981
You can speak for yourself.

210
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:29,384
Come on in.

211
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,928
I hate to drink and run.

212
00:24:39,402 --> 00:24:40,836
To the three of us.

213
00:24:41,738 --> 00:24:43,536
One for all, and all for one.

214
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,039
The question is, which one?

215
00:24:48,678 --> 00:24:51,477
Where are the keys to my car?

216
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:54,040
Right there, on the mantel.

217
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:57,380
Oh, darling, don't forget
to feed junior regularly.

218
00:25:02,225 --> 00:25:03,420
Bye, now.

219
00:25:15,105 --> 00:25:17,700
- What're we gonna do?
- About what?

220
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:20,373
Me. You. Her.

221
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,875
Three mixed-up musketeers.

222
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,638
I don't understand.

223
00:25:24,915 --> 00:25:27,180
How are you fixed for honesty?

224
00:25:27,918 --> 00:25:29,853
Do you know how old I am?

225
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,552
Twenty-seven.

226
00:25:32,222 --> 00:25:35,681
How long have we been,
what they call, going together?

227
00:25:35,892 --> 00:25:36,882
Three years.

228
00:25:37,093 --> 00:25:38,925
And four months.

229
00:25:39,195 --> 00:25:43,963
It's a lot of time to put in on
a man who can't make up his mind.

230
00:25:45,268 --> 00:25:48,761
- What are you talking about, marriage?
- I didn't say that.

231
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,702
But it's Gloria or me.

232
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,834
Are you telling me
who I can have for friends?

233
00:25:55,045 --> 00:25:59,278
I'm only telling you that you can't
kiss me, wishing I were Gloria anymore.

234
00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:02,611
- That's the stupidest--
- Call me when you make up your mind.

235
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:04,720
Shall we set a deadline?
New Year's Eve?

236
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:05,786
Wait a minute!

237
00:26:05,989 --> 00:26:09,118
Let me get this straight.
You're handing me an ultimatum?

238
00:26:10,927 --> 00:26:13,328
The first ultimatum
is always the hardest.

239
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,158
Goodbye and good luck.

240
00:26:15,498 --> 00:26:17,023
Gloria, don't go like this.

241
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,569
My name is Norma.

242
00:26:39,422 --> 00:26:41,323
Here's Gloria now.

243
00:26:41,591 --> 00:26:44,083
From where? Girl Scout camp?

244
00:26:45,662 --> 00:26:47,460
Do I look all right?

245
00:26:47,964 --> 00:26:49,728
Do you have to?

246
00:26:59,843 --> 00:27:01,311
- Hi, girls!
- Oh, darling!

247
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,346
You're getting circles
under your eyes.

248
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,382
Too much reading.

249
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,986
Dear Mrs. Thurber.

250
00:27:11,187 --> 00:27:12,883
How's church?

251
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,888
Why don't you go sometime
and find out?

252
00:27:16,326 --> 00:27:18,022
Coffee. Just what I need.

253
00:27:18,228 --> 00:27:19,287
Not bad.

254
00:27:19,496 --> 00:27:22,989
Now, Frances, you know Gloria's
always been a big coffee drinker...

255
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:24,792
...ever since she was little.

256
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:27,402
That's a perfectly lovely suit, dear.

257
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,436
Have I seen it before?

258
00:27:30,407 --> 00:27:33,844
I picked it up at the designer's last
week. Had it in the trunk of the car.

259
00:27:34,144 --> 00:27:37,774
Must be hard changing clothes
in one of those foreign car trunks.

260
00:27:39,082 --> 00:27:41,381
The model agency sent some dresses.

261
00:27:41,584 --> 00:27:44,816
One of them they want you to wear
to three different places.

262
00:27:45,088 --> 00:27:49,719
The Salvation Army, the public library
and the PTA in Brownsville.

263
00:27:53,096 --> 00:27:55,964
Frances, don't joke
about Gloria's work.

264
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,862
It's very important to her.

265
00:27:58,068 --> 00:28:00,537
She's one of the few girls
of her kind in the city.

266
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:04,371
I pass.

267
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:08,243
Did Butterfield 8 call?

268
00:28:08,445 --> 00:28:09,538
Not today.

269
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,544
Any mail?

270
00:28:15,285 --> 00:28:17,618
Oh, just act like I'm not here.

271
00:28:18,588 --> 00:28:20,648
You mean I haven't been?

272
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:23,893
There's a card from
the finance company.

273
00:28:24,094 --> 00:28:27,121
You're two weeks late
on your car payments.

274
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,959
Oh, it completely slipped my mind.

275
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,192
Listen, I've only got about $40.

276
00:28:32,402 --> 00:28:34,735
Could I borrow the $35
until I'm paid?

277
00:28:34,938 --> 00:28:35,769
Of course, darling.

278
00:28:35,972 --> 00:28:38,271
I don't know what I'd do without you.

279
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:40,472
Thank you, darling.

280
00:28:40,944 --> 00:28:43,072
I'll go get cleaned up
and do my nails.

281
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:45,348
Yeah, sharpen them!

282
00:28:46,983 --> 00:28:49,179
For you, Mrs. Thurber, I would.

283
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,717
In case you forgot, your room
is the first one on the right.

284
00:28:52,922 --> 00:28:54,015
Thank you.

285
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,858
Exactly where did you stay last night?

286
00:28:59,062 --> 00:29:01,964
Oh, the penthouse at the YWCA.

287
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:03,892
Oh, Annie.

288
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,069
Please don't tease Gloria.

289
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:09,296
My daughter and my best friend
should appreciate each other.

290
00:29:09,506 --> 00:29:12,169
Mama, don't be upset.

291
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,970
Every time I'm separated
from Mrs. Thurber...

292
00:29:15,178 --> 00:29:17,272
...I learn to appreciate her
a little bit more.

293
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,144
I return the sentiment.
Enjoy them in good health.

294
00:29:21,351 --> 00:29:22,910
Thank you, Frances.

295
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,590
I spent the night
with Steve's girlfriend, Norma.

296
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:28,690
Now isn't that nice?

297
00:29:29,459 --> 00:29:32,224
She knows a boy whose girlfriend
is that unselfish.

298
00:29:32,428 --> 00:29:35,626
That's a girlfriend that won't
have a boyfriend long.

299
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:38,892
A compliment from you, Mrs. Thurber?

300
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:41,037
I must have said it wrong.

301
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:43,033
See you later.

302
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,944
Hello.

303
00:30:55,912 --> 00:30:57,505
He's on the line?

304
00:30:58,381 --> 00:31:00,213
Let me speak to him.

305
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:05,687
Mr. Liggett, I didn't think you'd
be foolish enough to call today.

306
00:31:05,888 --> 00:31:07,117
But since you have--

307
00:31:13,062 --> 00:31:14,223
Wow!

308
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:19,193
I haven't heard that since
I was in Marine boot camp.

309
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:21,461
But you're way out of line, honey.

310
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:25,106
Okay, no "honey."

311
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,446
I tore your dress last night
and felt I owed you a new one.

312
00:31:29,712 --> 00:31:33,149
After all, only a fool would
offer pennies for a Renoir.

313
00:31:34,217 --> 00:31:37,016
<i>Suppose we meet again</i>
<i>at the old trading post?</i>

314
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,451
I might be in the neighborhood.

315
00:31:39,922 --> 00:31:41,857
If I am, what time
will you be there?

316
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,319
About 8:30?

317
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:49,899
I'm getting cold in my skin.
Goodbye.

318
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:57,302
- Keep the change, honey.
- Here you are, sir.

319
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:00,668
Thank you.

320
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,487
May Yale go bankrupt.

321
00:32:11,688 --> 00:32:13,122
That will take a while.

322
00:32:13,323 --> 00:32:14,723
But here's to it.

323
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,239
We didn't talk much last night.

324
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:30,737
Hardly.

325
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:34,075
But be grateful for small favors.

326
00:32:34,277 --> 00:32:36,439
I'm sorry about the money.

327
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,746
Forgotten!

328
00:32:39,482 --> 00:32:41,815
Hey, you're with me, kid.
Remember?

329
00:32:42,352 --> 00:32:44,753
By choice, only.

330
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:46,919
You're all alike, aren't you?

331
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:48,250
Play tough.

332
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:52,190
- I'm not like anyone. I'm me.
- That's right.

333
00:32:52,395 --> 00:32:54,125
I shouldn't knock it, should I?

334
00:32:56,232 --> 00:32:57,291
You know...

335
00:32:58,301 --> 00:33:00,327
...last night you were great company.

336
00:33:01,738 --> 00:33:03,764
I've spent time around and about.

337
00:33:03,973 --> 00:33:07,910
I didn't ask for your credits
last night. I don't need them now.

338
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:12,014
- But you're something different.
- I got the world by the tail.

339
00:33:12,215 --> 00:33:14,309
That's what I wanted to talk
to you about.

340
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,684
What do you want?

341
00:33:17,887 --> 00:33:19,287
Just what I'm getting.

342
00:33:19,489 --> 00:33:21,788
Oh, now, come on, dollface.

343
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,056
You must go to some very bad plays.

344
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,058
Okay.

345
00:33:29,265 --> 00:33:30,665
Gloria....

346
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,898
Now, look...

347
00:33:35,037 --> 00:33:36,005
...you have a price.

348
00:33:37,173 --> 00:33:39,699
We all have, and I can go pretty high.

349
00:33:42,712 --> 00:33:44,806
So hold out for all you can get.

350
00:33:45,281 --> 00:33:47,011
You may hit it pretty big.

351
00:33:47,884 --> 00:33:51,878
On the other hand, if you try for
too much, you may end up with nothing.

352
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:57,593
Good night.

353
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,292
You've got a great act.

354
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,366
Go ahead, rub your wrist.

355
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,637
I know it hurts.

356
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:43,839
Not if it killed me.

357
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,973
I wanna take you in my arms
and carry you away.

358
00:34:47,176 --> 00:34:49,873
That was a lesson pal,
not a treatment.

359
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,072
I won't talk about money again.
But think.

360
00:34:53,282 --> 00:34:57,720
- A big apartment, charge accounts--
- Mr. Liggett...

361
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,982
...put your assets away.
You don't have enough.

362
00:35:02,191 --> 00:35:03,318
Try me.

363
00:35:04,794 --> 00:35:08,287
You couldn't match what
I've already turned down.

364
00:35:08,498 --> 00:35:10,831
180-foot yacht in the French Riviera.

365
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:14,026
Van Goghs in every room,
genuine-type Van Goghs.

366
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,672
Paid for by this man
with pocket money.

367
00:35:16,873 --> 00:35:19,672
Annuities for life, jewelry....

368
00:35:20,476 --> 00:35:22,069
You turned this down?

369
00:35:22,278 --> 00:35:24,713
- Flatly!
- Why?

370
00:35:25,114 --> 00:35:27,379
I earn my living...

371
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,950
...modeling clothes like this.

372
00:35:30,152 --> 00:35:31,711
I wish I had a tape recorder.

373
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:35,050
Command performances
leave me quite cold.

374
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,693
I've had more fun
in the back of a '39 Ford...

375
00:35:37,894 --> 00:35:40,557
...than I ever would inside
the Chase National Bank.

376
00:35:42,532 --> 00:35:44,296
Now I get it.

377
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,664
You pick the man.

378
00:35:46,903 --> 00:35:47,893
He doesn't pick you.

379
00:35:49,472 --> 00:35:51,407
Finally!

380
00:35:51,641 --> 00:35:54,975
Why I'm not teaching logic
at Columbia, I'll never know.

381
00:35:55,645 --> 00:35:56,908
One moment.

382
00:35:57,246 --> 00:35:59,215
Postgraduate course.

383
00:35:59,982 --> 00:36:02,315
You also drop the man
when you want to?

384
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,756
And without a parachute.

385
00:36:06,989 --> 00:36:09,288
Oh, I'm with you, kid.

386
00:36:09,692 --> 00:36:12,355
And very grateful to be
up there for the trip.

387
00:36:12,562 --> 00:36:15,555
That's the first nice thing
you've said since I met you.

388
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:20,965
Drink up before you're
too busy to reach for it.

389
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,275
And then it's...

390
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:29,809
- ...go, go, go.
- Slowly, friend.

391
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:32,045
I have work to do.

392
00:36:32,548 --> 00:36:33,880
Namely?

393
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:37,785
I have three elegant bistros...

394
00:36:38,054 --> 00:36:41,547
...where I'm obliged to be
photographed in this dress.

395
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:46,225
Besides, you'll enjoy seeing
my good side first.

396
00:36:47,363 --> 00:36:49,889
This time, let's take my car.

397
00:36:50,933 --> 00:36:53,459
You mean the one with
that crazy back seat?

398
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,495
The same.

399
00:37:55,431 --> 00:37:57,229
Excuse me, darling.
I'll be back.

400
00:37:57,433 --> 00:37:58,799
Gloria.

401
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:01,027
I called you three times today.

402
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,900
I sent you a telegram.
I guess you didn't get it.

403
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,571
I think I'm getting it now.

404
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,304
I've got some fellows from New Haven
over there, and you're what we need.

405
00:38:12,515 --> 00:38:17,351
Yeah. But you see, I'm working.
And besides, I'm with somebody.

406
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,421
I see. Aren't you Weston Liggett?

407
00:38:20,623 --> 00:38:22,717
No, I'm Whistler's father.

408
00:38:24,326 --> 00:38:27,262
There's nothing I love better
than a great kidder.

409
00:38:27,463 --> 00:38:29,830
Oh, it's a lost art.

410
00:38:30,032 --> 00:38:32,126
But he's one of the greatest.

411
00:38:37,173 --> 00:38:39,369
El Morocco's right around this corner.

412
00:38:41,043 --> 00:38:43,239
You drove right by it!

413
00:38:43,713 --> 00:38:44,840
That's right.

414
00:38:45,347 --> 00:38:46,713
Now, look!

415
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:48,407
Now, you look.

416
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:51,082
I'm tired of looking and listening.

417
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,414
Nobody treats me like this.

418
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:57,286
Oh, you mean big Weston Liggett,
the wealthy.

419
00:38:57,493 --> 00:39:00,088
I mean, me.
Weston Liggett, the man.

420
00:39:01,564 --> 00:39:05,126
- There was such a person?
- In spades, honey.

421
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:07,565
I wasn't cut out to be a chauffeur...

422
00:39:07,903 --> 00:39:09,667
...a rented escort...

423
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,874
...a straight man for your
nightclub repartee.

424
00:39:13,075 --> 00:39:16,637
Now, you mustn't run yourself
down like that.

425
00:39:16,846 --> 00:39:19,714
And the next time you
get angry, sweetheart...

426
00:39:19,915 --> 00:39:23,647
...just remember, you sent for me.
I didn't send for you.

427
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,852
Take one of these out
for me, will you?

428
00:39:54,283 --> 00:39:56,479
Like hell, you didn't send for me.

429
00:40:00,756 --> 00:40:02,088
Now what?

430
00:40:02,558 --> 00:40:05,460
Are you going to drag me off
to your cave?

431
00:40:05,728 --> 00:40:08,163
My apartment is three minutes away.

432
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,491
Oh, no.

433
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:12,725
Not your apartment.
Absolutely not.

434
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:15,561
It was all right for you last night.

435
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:21,000
But last night my sense of direction
was slightly impaired by gin.

436
00:40:21,677 --> 00:40:25,114
Okay, I've got caves
all over the place.

437
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:30,985
You can straighten up now.
We've made the curve.

438
00:40:31,353 --> 00:40:33,117
But I don't want to.

439
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,052
Hello.

440
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,422
Hello.

441
00:41:03,552 --> 00:41:06,147
Happy? Happy!

442
00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:08,621
Good evening!

443
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,692
Good evening.

444
00:41:11,327 --> 00:41:13,387
- Good evening.
- If it isn't Mr. Liggett.

445
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,894
I see you're all filled up.

446
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,226
Oh, well, I wouldn't be Happy
if I wasn't.

447
00:41:22,171 --> 00:41:25,005
We always have room
for two more weary travelers.

448
00:41:25,207 --> 00:41:26,937
If you'll excuse me,
I need rest.

449
00:41:27,142 --> 00:41:29,111
Oh, sure.
I know, I know.

450
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,207
Hey, I've got a new joke for you!

451
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,646
- It's crazy and there's some words--
- Now, please!

452
00:41:35,851 --> 00:41:40,221
- But there were these two old maids--
- Some other time. Later.

453
00:41:40,422 --> 00:41:44,018
A man's got to get his rest.
He's got to get it regular.

454
00:41:44,927 --> 00:41:48,659
Honey, there was a time
I could've worn that coat.

455
00:41:48,864 --> 00:41:53,427
- Happy was in vaudeville once.
- In vaudeville? I was vaudeville.

456
00:41:54,236 --> 00:41:56,705
You should see my scrapbooks!

457
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:43,513
You're liable to end up
psychologically famous.

458
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:46,052
A case history in a medical book.

459
00:42:46,322 --> 00:42:48,723
- You writing it?
- No.

460
00:42:49,258 --> 00:42:53,354
But I tell my psychiatrist everything.
Even down to the smallest...

461
00:42:53,562 --> 00:42:55,292
...darkest details.

462
00:42:55,497 --> 00:42:57,898
That's a set of notes
I'd like to read.

463
00:42:59,468 --> 00:43:01,767
But why do you need a psychiatrist?

464
00:43:01,971 --> 00:43:05,430
I've never met anyone as direct
and uninhibited as you.

465
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:10,039
You know that Latin motto,
<i>sic transit gloria</i>?

466
00:43:11,246 --> 00:43:14,808
I'm the <i>gloria,</i>and in my case
the <i>sic</i> is for real sick.

467
00:43:15,017 --> 00:43:18,454
I'm not too sure about the <i>transit.</i>
I think it's about my car.

468
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,658
Gloria....

469
00:43:27,262 --> 00:43:28,457
You're wonderful.

470
00:43:29,298 --> 00:43:31,028
"Wild" is the word.

471
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,629
First genuine wildness
I've come across in a woman.

472
00:43:36,105 --> 00:43:38,597
Have you stopped to think
that perhaps...

473
00:43:38,807 --> 00:43:40,742
...you bring out the wildness in me?

474
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:43,404
With you, who has time to think?

475
00:43:43,846 --> 00:43:45,280
Take five.

476
00:43:45,814 --> 00:43:48,443
- Waitress, some more french fries?
- Coming up.

477
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,948
Gloria, where do we go from here?

478
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:58,154
That's a good question.

479
00:43:59,294 --> 00:44:02,594
Why don't we go on a long trip
to faraway places...

480
00:44:02,798 --> 00:44:04,391
...exploring?

481
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,362
Exploring what?

482
00:44:06,835 --> 00:44:08,167
What else?

483
00:44:08,737 --> 00:44:10,069
Each other.

484
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,035
Here's the overture.

485
00:44:15,878 --> 00:44:17,107
Theme.

486
00:44:17,346 --> 00:44:18,712
Where's the theme?

487
00:44:19,848 --> 00:44:21,009
I'll get it.

488
00:44:22,985 --> 00:44:26,319
- You're working. I'll drop by later.
- No, come on in.

489
00:44:26,522 --> 00:44:27,922
We've finished.

490
00:44:28,824 --> 00:44:30,087
Sit down.

491
00:44:30,726 --> 00:44:33,719
I'll have the last 16 bars
and the tag for you tomorrow.

492
00:44:33,929 --> 00:44:36,262
- About noon.
- See you, Steve.

493
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:39,798
Now....

494
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,339
I found your message and came over.

495
00:44:43,672 --> 00:44:46,198
I wanted to thank you
for the birthday gift.

496
00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:50,238
It was ordered a long time ago.
They sent it automatically.

497
00:44:50,446 --> 00:44:52,540
And a few days early at that.

498
00:44:54,683 --> 00:44:56,345
I've missed seeing you.

499
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,951
- This place is a wreck.
- I guess so.

500
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:03,353
I've been busy.
Here, let me take your coat.

501
00:45:06,695 --> 00:45:07,822
Thank you.

502
00:45:20,576 --> 00:45:23,375
- The story of my life.
- What is?

503
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,775
My simple cloth coat hanging
in your closet, next to Gloria's mink.

504
00:45:27,983 --> 00:45:30,851
- At least mine's paid for.
- This is not her coat.

505
00:45:31,053 --> 00:45:32,612
She borrowed it.

506
00:45:33,222 --> 00:45:34,622
I don't know where she is.

507
00:45:34,823 --> 00:45:38,021
I've been calling Butterfield 8.
They don't know either.

508
00:45:38,227 --> 00:45:39,217
- I do.
- Where?

509
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,392
She's way out in another world.

510
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,397
Give me my coat.
I'll be on my way.

511
00:45:45,601 --> 00:45:48,161
- You just got here.
- It was a mistake.

512
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,862
- Norma.
- I thought when I found your message...

513
00:45:51,073 --> 00:45:54,703
...that you'd made up your mind,
but you haven't. No, thanks!

514
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:56,811
- Norma, sit down.
- I don't want to.

515
00:45:57,012 --> 00:45:59,208
Norma, sit down and listen.

516
00:46:01,016 --> 00:46:04,475
Every time we see each other,
we fight about Gloria.

517
00:46:04,686 --> 00:46:06,348
Without raising our voices...

518
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,286
...let me explain Gloria
to you once and for all.

519
00:46:09,491 --> 00:46:10,789
That's quite a job.

520
00:46:10,993 --> 00:46:14,259
We grew up in the same area.
I've known her all my life.

521
00:46:14,463 --> 00:46:15,897
We went to the same school.

522
00:46:16,265 --> 00:46:19,429
Her father died when she was little.
Her mother went to work.

523
00:46:20,202 --> 00:46:23,331
So I sort of became her family.

524
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,432
I have to look after her.

525
00:46:26,842 --> 00:46:28,868
I'm gonna do it for
as long as it takes.

526
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,807
Will you try to understand?

527
00:46:31,113 --> 00:46:32,979
- I understand.
- I knew you would.

528
00:46:33,182 --> 00:46:36,209
I understand that it's
much worse than I thought.

529
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:39,684
You're in love with her,
and you don't even know it.

530
00:46:41,123 --> 00:46:42,591
Steve...

531
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:46,159
- ...is she not a tramp?
- I never liked that word.

532
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:50,992
- She's the biggest tramp in the city.
- I don't like to hear you use it.

533
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,999
Suppose you make up your mind
to marry me someday?

534
00:46:54,203 --> 00:46:58,334
We marry and have kids. Do you want
her hanging around, babysitting?

535
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,908
Nipping brandy in the morning
and telling them the story...

536
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,740
...of Red Riding Hood and the
Three Lecherous Bears in a hotel?

537
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:09,112
Do we keep a room where
she can sleep off her hangovers?

538
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:13,312
- All I know is, I worry about her.
- But does she worry about you?

539
00:47:13,522 --> 00:47:15,514
- Does she?!
- I don't know or care!

540
00:47:15,724 --> 00:47:19,024
This is something I'm gonna do
whether you like it or not!

541
00:47:30,939 --> 00:47:32,407
Steve...

542
00:47:32,608 --> 00:47:34,668
...I withdraw my ultimatum.

543
00:47:34,876 --> 00:47:38,108
This fight is far too important
for me to run away.

544
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,714
If I'm going to lose...

545
00:47:43,919 --> 00:47:47,253
...it's only gonna be because
I'm thoroughly beaten.

546
00:47:53,895 --> 00:47:56,330
If you don't kiss me,
I'm going to kiss you.

547
00:48:22,324 --> 00:48:24,020
That's where I was born.

548
00:48:29,931 --> 00:48:33,424
- Right behind that window up there.
- It's not what I pictured.

549
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:36,202
It isn't what my mother
pictured either.

550
00:48:36,405 --> 00:48:39,398
We couldn't even afford a doctor.
My father delivered me.

551
00:48:39,608 --> 00:48:44,205
- He must have been a courageous man.
- He was an inventor.

552
00:48:44,646 --> 00:48:46,945
Can you think of
anything more useless...

553
00:48:47,282 --> 00:48:49,308
...in a small town like this?

554
00:48:50,085 --> 00:48:52,748
- Not if he invented a way to get out.
- He did.

555
00:48:52,954 --> 00:48:54,855
Oh, with some gimmick or other.

556
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:59,256
And he made money. Not a lot,
but enough to set us up comfortably.

557
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:03,089
He was very proud of me
when I graduated law school.

558
00:49:03,598 --> 00:49:06,295
He was certain I'd go
a long way in this world.

559
00:49:06,501 --> 00:49:08,163
And you did, didn't you?

560
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:12,673
- The head of a big chemical company.
- I'm just another hired hand.

561
00:49:12,874 --> 00:49:15,605
The company belongs
to my wife's family.

562
00:49:19,314 --> 00:49:22,341
My wife is a fact that I can't avoid.

563
00:49:22,951 --> 00:49:26,012
She's the center of a spiderweb
of family, money...

564
00:49:26,221 --> 00:49:29,248
...country clubs and time-killing
childish employments.

565
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:31,222
Fall into it once....

566
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:39,068
- What will the neighbors think?
- The worst.

567
00:49:39,534 --> 00:49:42,026
You know, that's exactly
what I'm thinking now.

568
00:49:42,871 --> 00:49:44,863
I want to kiss you right here...

569
00:49:45,073 --> 00:49:48,510
...on Chestnut Street at noon
in the worst possible way.

570
00:49:49,644 --> 00:49:52,136
You know, I'm glad
you're in chemicals.

571
00:50:02,557 --> 00:50:03,820
Annie?

572
00:50:08,096 --> 00:50:10,691
- Annie.
- Did you play?

573
00:50:10,899 --> 00:50:12,561
Quite a while ago.

574
00:50:15,103 --> 00:50:16,366
There!

575
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,766
You can't be out of clubs.

576
00:50:19,207 --> 00:50:20,698
Well, what did I play?

577
00:50:20,909 --> 00:50:25,244
Your heart. And I can hear yours
pounding right across the table.

578
00:50:25,447 --> 00:50:27,313
I'm sorry, Franny.

579
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:29,613
Let's forget the game.

580
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:33,414
No, no, no. I'll pay attention.
Now, let's play.

581
00:50:34,256 --> 00:50:36,885
I'd rather you put your troubles
on the table.

582
00:50:37,092 --> 00:50:38,958
I don't wanna burden you with them.

583
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,858
So what am I your friend for?
Your money?

584
00:50:42,063 --> 00:50:44,328
Or maybe I want to steal your husband?

585
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:50,070
You think I don't know you haven't
heard from your daughter in six days?

586
00:50:52,207 --> 00:50:55,371
She's never done such a thing
before without calling.

587
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,914
Something terrible
must have happened.

588
00:51:00,115 --> 00:51:03,347
Why does it have to be bad?
Good things happen too.

589
00:51:03,552 --> 00:51:06,886
Frances, you're my best friend, but...

590
00:51:07,456 --> 00:51:09,789
- ...I can't talk to you, frankly.
- Why not?

591
00:51:09,991 --> 00:51:13,519
There are things you don't know about.
Nobody should.

592
00:51:13,728 --> 00:51:17,756
- Yes, they should!
- Her father died when she was so little.

593
00:51:19,801 --> 00:51:21,599
If only she'd had a wise father...

594
00:51:21,803 --> 00:51:24,932
...and strong enough to keep her
on the right path!

595
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,611
Once, there was a man I almost married.

596
00:51:30,812 --> 00:51:33,509
The major.
Major Hartley?

597
00:51:35,317 --> 00:51:38,344
Somehow or other,
Gloria didn't like him.

598
00:51:39,354 --> 00:51:42,153
It might have been good for her
if I had.

599
00:51:42,691 --> 00:51:43,989
Anne.

600
00:51:45,026 --> 00:51:48,258
Gloria's a good girl.
Don't worry about her.

601
00:51:48,463 --> 00:51:51,399
But you always say
such impolite things to her.

602
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,297
I say the same to everybody.
I'm a born critic.

603
00:51:54,669 --> 00:51:57,195
There's bad in everything,
but there's good too.

604
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:00,000
Her good far outweighs the bad.

605
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:04,805
If she was that bad, you wouldn't
have heard from her in six years.

606
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,739
Do you mind if I kiss you?

607
00:52:07,949 --> 00:52:12,080
You do, and I'll spread an ugly rumor
all around the neighborhood.

608
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,715
She's a real rust bucket.

609
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,774
But she's mine.

610
00:52:42,984 --> 00:52:44,350
A yacht!

611
00:52:44,553 --> 00:52:48,354
- You didn't tell me.
- It doesn't have any Van Goghs in it...

612
00:52:49,157 --> 00:52:52,616
...but I do have two original
copies of <i>Playboy</i> magazine.

613
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:58,667
Let's go aboard and "sail away
for a year and a day...

614
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:02,827
- ...to the land of the bong trees."
<i>- The Owl and the Cat.</i>

615
00:53:03,238 --> 00:53:05,434
Come aboard, mate, and sign on.

616
00:53:11,112 --> 00:53:12,671
But I warn you...

617
00:53:13,248 --> 00:53:16,184
...the crew hasn't seen a woman
for three months.

618
00:53:16,384 --> 00:53:17,909
Crazy.

619
00:53:18,753 --> 00:53:20,915
Where are you bound for, captain?

620
00:53:21,523 --> 00:53:23,253
Out of frustration...

621
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:25,253
...bound for ecstasy.

622
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,761
I've heard a lot about ecstasy.

623
00:53:27,963 --> 00:53:29,864
It's everything they say...

624
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,126
...and more.

625
00:53:39,374 --> 00:53:43,903
If you'd kindly show me to my quarters,
you can lift anchor anytime.

626
00:53:57,792 --> 00:53:59,055
Emily?

627
00:53:59,594 --> 00:54:00,789
Mother!

628
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,192
You should be in bed.

629
00:54:04,399 --> 00:54:07,961
And you should not be in bed.
At least alone.

630
00:54:08,837 --> 00:54:11,068
Now, I can take care of myself.

631
00:54:11,573 --> 00:54:14,202
Which seems to be more
than you can do.

632
00:54:16,144 --> 00:54:18,477
I want to tell you about our family.

633
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,674
- It's 11:00, and I know all about--
- I'll tell you anyway. Sit down.

634
00:54:22,917 --> 00:54:24,385
I want to make a point.

635
00:54:24,586 --> 00:54:25,747
All right.

636
00:54:25,954 --> 00:54:29,152
We've had sacrifice and cowardice...

637
00:54:29,357 --> 00:54:31,383
...honor and infidelity...

638
00:54:31,593 --> 00:54:33,459
...courage, love...

639
00:54:33,662 --> 00:54:37,224
...deception, confusion, brilliance...

640
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:40,860
- ...tragedy.
- Why not just bring the dictionary?

641
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:45,336
You know what we've never had in the
family since its history's been recorded?

642
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,508
Privacy.

643
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:52,673
There's not one single,
solitary divorce.

644
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:57,781
It's my opinion, after 150 years,
we've earned...

645
00:54:57,986 --> 00:54:59,818
...a divorce with a clear conscience.

646
00:55:00,155 --> 00:55:02,420
Tomorrow, I want you
to call Mr. Robinson...

647
00:55:02,624 --> 00:55:05,287
...and instruct him to draw up
the necessary papers...

648
00:55:05,493 --> 00:55:07,985
...and to have them served
forthwith on that...

649
00:55:08,196 --> 00:55:10,893
...worthless, absentee husband of yours.

650
00:55:11,132 --> 00:55:14,500
- He is not worthless.
- Then why isn't he with you?

651
00:55:14,703 --> 00:55:17,468
Mother, you were ill.
I wanted to look after you.

652
00:55:17,672 --> 00:55:21,006
You wanted to hide from
unpleasantness and the truth.

653
00:55:21,209 --> 00:55:25,613
Somewhere, at this very minute, he's
probably lifting a glass in a bar...

654
00:55:25,814 --> 00:55:28,147
...or some woman's skirt.
And you know it.

655
00:55:28,349 --> 00:55:29,749
Oh, Mother, don't be vulgar!

656
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:32,147
Vulgarity has its uses.

657
00:55:32,921 --> 00:55:34,753
Anyway, your marriage is over.

658
00:55:35,557 --> 00:55:37,617
Divorce him without delay...

659
00:55:37,892 --> 00:55:39,918
- ...and start out fresh.
- No.

660
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,323
Never.

661
00:55:41,529 --> 00:55:45,557
This is not pride speaking,
but because I know Wes is good.

662
00:55:45,767 --> 00:55:47,395
- And I love him.
- Oh, nonsense!

663
00:55:47,602 --> 00:55:48,661
Now, Mother...

664
00:55:48,937 --> 00:55:50,166
...you listen to me.

665
00:55:50,371 --> 00:55:53,432
If there's anything wrong with Wes,
we brought it about.

666
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,939
Explain.

667
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:59,137
Instead of my living his life,
we brought him here to ours.

668
00:55:59,347 --> 00:56:01,976
We handed him a gift-wrapped
package and said:

669
00:56:02,183 --> 00:56:05,551
"Here. Here's your life.
Don't bother to live it yourself."

670
00:56:05,754 --> 00:56:09,350
You presented him with a meaningless
job, all title and no work.

671
00:56:10,091 --> 00:56:14,153
He woke up with energy to burn,
and he started burning it.

672
00:56:14,362 --> 00:56:18,993
But in all the wrong directions:
liquor, women, defiance.

673
00:56:19,701 --> 00:56:22,967
The more he did it, the more
he had to go on to justify it.

674
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,538
You're not running a mission
for lost egos.

675
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,202
Mother, I'm running a marriage.

676
00:56:28,409 --> 00:56:31,937
Not just through the good days,
but through the bad days too.

677
00:56:32,547 --> 00:56:35,016
Someday Wes is going to find himself.

678
00:56:35,216 --> 00:56:37,742
When he does, I want to be there.

679
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:39,252
In the meantime?

680
00:56:40,488 --> 00:56:42,354
All I need is patience.

681
00:56:42,991 --> 00:56:44,391
How much have you got left?

682
00:56:46,394 --> 00:56:47,987
I don't know, Mother.

683
00:56:48,663 --> 00:56:50,359
That's what scares me.

684
00:56:50,665 --> 00:56:51,826
I don't know.

685
00:56:59,474 --> 00:57:02,000
You're a magnificent woman, Emily.

686
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:03,976
Magnificent.

687
00:57:05,446 --> 00:57:07,438
But why don't you fight for him?

688
00:57:07,782 --> 00:57:10,946
A knock-down, drag-out kind of fight.

689
00:57:11,152 --> 00:57:14,122
And give him all the more reason
to run away from me?

690
00:57:19,127 --> 00:57:20,356
Emily...

691
00:57:22,764 --> 00:57:26,223
...where did you ever learn
all this wisdom?

692
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,672
From you, you fool!

693
00:57:45,153 --> 00:57:48,612
That attaché case, a man would
love that, wouldn't he?

694
00:57:48,823 --> 00:57:49,722
Any man.

695
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:52,393
Especially if the right woman
gave it to him.

696
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:55,325
I know the right woman
and the right man.

697
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:57,021
Let's buy it.

698
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:04,828
Good morning.

699
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:08,100
- Good morning.
- I'd like to see that attaché case.

700
00:58:08,309 --> 00:58:10,175
- The one in tan.
- This one?

701
00:58:14,749 --> 00:58:18,516
- Very nice. Can you gift-wrap it?
- Yes, of course.

702
00:58:22,423 --> 00:58:26,121
Would you care to have the initials
put on it in gold?

703
00:58:26,694 --> 00:58:27,525
Excuse me.

704
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,792
- We have a machine that can do it.
- Fine. Thank you.

705
00:58:30,999 --> 00:58:32,524
- What initials, please?
- S.C.

706
00:58:32,734 --> 00:58:35,203
- S.C. Thank you.
- S.C.?

707
00:58:35,403 --> 00:58:36,496
Who's S.C.?

708
00:58:36,704 --> 00:58:38,263
Steve Carpenter.

709
00:58:38,573 --> 00:58:41,133
- And who's Steve Carpenter?
- A friend of mine.

710
00:58:41,676 --> 00:58:43,076
Out of nowhere.

711
00:58:43,378 --> 00:58:46,371
Completely out of nowhere
comes a friend called "Steve."

712
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:50,978
It's his birthday.

713
00:58:51,185 --> 00:58:54,121
Every birthday, for 12 years,
I've bought him a present.

714
00:58:54,355 --> 00:58:57,553
Oh, that's grand.
I'm all choked up.

715
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:01,659
Liggett?

716
00:59:04,866 --> 00:59:08,064
I'm going to have to leave
you today and go see Steve.

717
00:59:09,137 --> 00:59:09,968
Now, look.

718
00:59:10,204 --> 00:59:12,901
I know. "You're
with me, kid. Remember?"

719
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:16,710
It'll be only a moment, ma'am.

720
00:59:17,946 --> 00:59:18,777
Oh, clerk?

721
00:59:21,883 --> 00:59:26,253
I'm Gloria Wandrous. I called to see
if something would be ready today.

722
00:59:26,454 --> 00:59:29,151
- Do you know if it is?
- I have it right here.

723
00:59:29,557 --> 00:59:32,356
Miss Wandrous.
Here it is, miss.

724
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,789
Thank you.

725
00:59:59,687 --> 01:00:02,247
- Do you mind?
- Go right ahead, sir.

726
01:00:12,033 --> 01:00:12,864
Gloria...

727
01:00:13,201 --> 01:00:17,297
...I'm afraid it's your turn
to act like a fool because...

728
01:00:17,672 --> 01:00:19,698
...there's something
I have to tell you.

729
01:00:20,441 --> 01:00:23,741
You act like a man who's expecting
his wife back in town.

730
01:00:24,512 --> 01:00:26,140
How did you know? Today?

731
01:00:26,447 --> 01:00:28,313
I always knew.

732
01:00:28,516 --> 01:00:29,540
Someday.

733
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:35,022
Here I was, trying
to find a way to....

734
01:00:36,324 --> 01:00:39,783
Look, Gloria, I have to spend
at least tonight with her.

735
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,756
A good night's sleep will
be the best thing for you.

736
01:00:46,234 --> 01:00:48,260
I have Steve to keep me warm.

737
01:00:48,469 --> 01:00:50,267
Don't say things like that.

738
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,506
Mr. Liggett, I can hardly wait
for your call tomorrow.

739
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:57,406
You won't forget the number?

740
01:00:58,179 --> 01:00:59,112
I'll do my best.

741
01:01:01,249 --> 01:01:02,478
And, Liggett...

742
01:01:03,017 --> 01:01:04,747
...thank you for not calling me...

743
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:07,649
..."honey" and "babe"
and "dollface" anymore.

744
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:09,757
I couldn't.

745
01:01:10,658 --> 01:01:12,684
I don't think of you
like that anymore.

746
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,311
Mama?

747
01:01:54,802 --> 01:01:56,031
Darling.

748
01:01:56,237 --> 01:01:57,705
I've been so worried about you.

749
01:01:57,905 --> 01:02:01,000
I know you have been, darling,
and I'm sorry.

750
01:02:01,275 --> 01:02:03,107
- Are you hungry?
- No.

751
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:06,408
Mama, I want to tell you
what I've been doing.

752
01:02:06,614 --> 01:02:09,413
- No, dear, you don't have to.
- I do.

753
01:02:09,951 --> 01:02:12,978
I've been with a man a whole week.

754
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:18,016
Let me tell you the truth
for once in my life.

755
01:02:18,759 --> 01:02:21,354
No, please. Please.

756
01:02:21,929 --> 01:02:24,763
We both know what kind
of a girl I've been.

757
01:02:24,966 --> 01:02:28,368
- No, I don't want to hear about it.
- Mama, you have to!

758
01:02:28,569 --> 01:02:32,472
Unless I am honest about yesterday,
how can you believe me today?

759
01:02:32,673 --> 01:02:33,538
Believe what?

760
01:02:33,741 --> 01:02:35,073
I'm different!

761
01:02:35,276 --> 01:02:37,040
Mama, I am different.

762
01:02:37,245 --> 01:02:40,875
Yesterday, it was men,
a whole world full of men--

763
01:02:41,082 --> 01:02:43,051
Let me go! You're hurting me!

764
01:02:43,251 --> 01:02:44,549
Mama, face it!

765
01:02:44,752 --> 01:02:46,846
I was the slut of all time!

766
01:02:51,826 --> 01:02:55,422
If only you'd done that before.

767
01:02:56,164 --> 01:02:57,427
Long ago...

768
01:02:57,632 --> 01:03:01,797
...every time I came home
all soaked through with gin.

769
01:03:04,972 --> 01:03:06,201
I'm sorry.

770
01:03:10,545 --> 01:03:14,107
It's not your fault, Mama.
It never has been.

771
01:03:14,549 --> 01:03:16,313
It was in me...

772
01:03:16,717 --> 01:03:18,845
...but it isn't there anymore.

773
01:03:19,053 --> 01:03:23,650
It's no longer just men for me.
There's only one man. One.

774
01:03:23,858 --> 01:03:25,326
Just one.

775
01:03:26,861 --> 01:03:29,126
Maybe it's too late for marriage...

776
01:03:30,531 --> 01:03:33,126
...but it's not too late for love.

777
01:03:34,235 --> 01:03:35,601
Now...

778
01:03:36,571 --> 01:03:39,803
...by some miracle,
I'm like everybody else.

779
01:03:40,508 --> 01:03:41,999
I'm in love.

780
01:03:43,544 --> 01:03:45,570
You can look at me, Mama...

781
01:03:46,214 --> 01:03:48,877
...without wishing
I'd never been born.

782
01:04:03,397 --> 01:04:04,592
Hi, Bing.

783
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,097
Hi, Ligg.

784
01:04:08,603 --> 01:04:09,662
Well?

785
01:04:10,338 --> 01:04:12,034
Is that offer still open?

786
01:04:14,842 --> 01:04:16,071
Yes or no?

787
01:04:16,877 --> 01:04:19,142
So you finally came to your senses.

788
01:04:19,347 --> 01:04:21,680
Well, what brought this on?

789
01:04:21,882 --> 01:04:23,714
Something just woke me up.

790
01:04:26,053 --> 01:04:27,521
I won't ask what it was...

791
01:04:27,722 --> 01:04:30,886
...because I wish it had
happened five years ago.

792
01:04:31,092 --> 01:04:33,618
- You prepared to work hard?
- Harder than you.

793
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:37,560
We keep regular hours.
Law and liquor don't go together.

794
01:04:37,765 --> 01:04:40,064
It'll take six months
of study to catch up.

795
01:04:40,268 --> 01:04:41,861
I'll catch up in three.

796
01:04:42,236 --> 01:04:44,671
All right, Ligg, old friend.
Let's go.

797
01:04:51,112 --> 01:04:52,671
She's here, doctor.

798
01:04:54,248 --> 01:04:56,444
Good afternoon, Dr. Tredman.

799
01:04:57,184 --> 01:05:00,552
I don't know if I care to talk
with you, Miss Wandrous.

800
01:05:00,755 --> 01:05:02,417
Then why did you let me in?

801
01:05:02,623 --> 01:05:06,025
Don't try to analyze me.
You don't have the training.

802
01:05:06,227 --> 01:05:07,923
Not in books, perhaps.

803
01:05:08,129 --> 01:05:12,464
You missed three sessions in a row,
and you're late for this one.

804
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,994
I have only so much time a day.

805
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:18,900
If you don't need the time,
there are people who desperately do.

806
01:05:19,106 --> 01:05:23,043
Now, let's get to work
without anymore nonsense.

807
01:05:23,611 --> 01:05:26,547
I'm sure after all that,
we'll have no rapport.

808
01:05:26,747 --> 01:05:29,307
But if you get mad enough,
I might find something.

809
01:05:29,517 --> 01:05:32,043
Doctor Tredman, are you
hard of hearing?

810
01:05:32,253 --> 01:05:33,243
No.

811
01:05:33,454 --> 01:05:36,014
- I'm trying to tell you something.
- What?

812
01:05:37,091 --> 01:05:39,219
I don't need you anymore.

813
01:05:40,628 --> 01:05:43,029
I have no problems anymore.

814
01:05:45,866 --> 01:05:47,528
I'm in love.

815
01:05:48,002 --> 01:05:49,868
I am in love.

816
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:53,235
I am really in love.

817
01:05:53,674 --> 01:05:55,905
I'm delighted to hear it.

818
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:59,342
Goodbye, Dr. Tredman.
Thank you for everything.

819
01:06:02,616 --> 01:06:07,111
While it is sometimes possible
that love can solve many things...

820
01:06:07,321 --> 01:06:11,520
...love is not so simple that you can
rely on it as a complete solution.

821
01:06:11,726 --> 01:06:12,921
So...

822
01:06:13,527 --> 01:06:16,053
...if it isn't all that
you hoped it would be...

823
01:06:16,464 --> 01:06:19,593
...if it doesn't work out,
don't hesitate to come back...

824
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,063
...quickly.

825
01:06:21,535 --> 01:06:23,128
But it will work out.

826
01:06:23,337 --> 01:06:25,568
And I'm gonna make it work.

827
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,167
But if it doesn't....

828
01:06:30,144 --> 01:06:31,737
But it will.

829
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:34,039
It has to.

830
01:06:44,091 --> 01:06:46,424
Happy birthday, Steve!

831
01:06:46,761 --> 01:06:48,457
Come on in.
Norma's on the phone.

832
01:06:48,662 --> 01:06:50,130
Give her my best.

833
01:06:50,331 --> 01:06:51,731
Sorry, Norma.

834
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,761
Yeah, that place sounds fine.

835
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,937
I'll pick you up in a half-hour.

836
01:06:56,437 --> 01:06:57,530
What?

837
01:06:57,938 --> 01:07:00,430
That was just a studio messenger.

838
01:07:00,841 --> 01:07:02,605
See you later. Bye.

839
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,438
What are you trying to do to me?

840
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:07,444
Drive you wild with desire!

841
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:09,583
Where have you been all this time?

842
01:07:09,784 --> 01:07:14,484
I've been chained to the wall in
a sanitarium to keep away from you.

843
01:07:14,889 --> 01:07:15,720
Indifference.

844
01:07:15,923 --> 01:07:18,825
You can't drive me away
this time with indifference.

845
01:07:19,026 --> 01:07:20,358
Norma's waiting. I gotta--

846
01:07:20,561 --> 01:07:24,589
Flesh and blood can only stand
so much voluptuous torture.

847
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:27,030
You have 30 seconds, buddy-boy.

848
01:07:27,234 --> 01:07:28,964
Have you gone on the needle?

849
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,604
I am hooked.

850
01:07:30,871 --> 01:07:32,100
I am hooked.

851
01:07:32,306 --> 01:07:33,831
- I'm hooked on you.
- Cut it out.

852
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:35,771
You have 20 seconds.

853
01:07:35,976 --> 01:07:37,239
19...

854
01:07:37,445 --> 01:07:38,413
...18...

855
01:07:38,612 --> 01:07:40,240
...17--

856
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:45,710
The coat!
Oh, Lord, the coat!

857
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,480
She's coming back to town today!

858
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:50,920
- What am I gonna do?
- 16...

859
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:53,321
...15, 14...

860
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:56,292
- You're crazier than I am.
- ...13, 12...

861
01:07:56,497 --> 01:07:58,193
- Bye. Happy birthday!
- ...11...

862
01:07:58,399 --> 01:08:01,927
...10, 9, 8, 7....

863
01:08:17,685 --> 01:08:18,709
Mrs. Liggett.

864
01:08:18,919 --> 01:08:21,445
Welcome home.
It's good to have you back.

865
01:08:21,655 --> 01:08:24,090
- How nice of you, George.
- How is Mrs. Jescott?

866
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:26,817
She's coming along fine,
out of danger.

867
01:08:56,457 --> 01:08:58,824
Darling, I didn't even
hear you come in.

868
01:08:59,026 --> 01:09:01,689
- You been standing there long?
- A minute.

869
01:09:03,664 --> 01:09:04,791
Welcome home.

870
01:09:04,999 --> 01:09:06,490
Thank you, Wes.

871
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:08,467
Thank you.

872
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:13,503
I must say, you're looking
surprisingly youthful.

873
01:09:13,841 --> 01:09:16,902
I'm far from being an old man,
as yet, I hope.

874
01:09:17,711 --> 01:09:21,045
I didn't mean that you ever were old.
It's just that...

875
01:09:21,382 --> 01:09:24,079
...there's a certain
aliveness about you.

876
01:09:24,685 --> 01:09:26,313
I don't know what I mean.

877
01:09:26,854 --> 01:09:28,618
Is your mother feeling better?

878
01:09:28,856 --> 01:09:30,848
Yes. Much.

879
01:09:31,225 --> 01:09:33,126
Well, that's nice. I'm glad.

880
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:36,961
- Emily, there's something--
- I know. Missing.

881
01:09:37,164 --> 01:09:39,633
- What?
- I noticed it as soon as I came in.

882
01:09:39,833 --> 01:09:41,699
- What are you talking about?
- My coat.

883
01:09:41,902 --> 01:09:43,666
- What coat?
- My mink.

884
01:09:43,871 --> 01:09:47,103
- Your mink is missing?
- Didn't you know it was gone?

885
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:48,674
Of course not.

886
01:09:50,244 --> 01:09:51,473
See?

887
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:54,638
- You must have misplaced it.
- I checked every closet.

888
01:09:54,848 --> 01:09:56,612
Maybe you left it out
at Long Island.

889
01:09:56,817 --> 01:10:00,083
Just to make certain, I called Mother.
But it's not there.

890
01:10:00,521 --> 01:10:01,853
How could it be gone?

891
01:10:02,056 --> 01:10:03,149
I don't know.

892
01:10:03,357 --> 01:10:05,053
I've been here every day...

893
01:10:05,259 --> 01:10:07,854
...and nobody else
has been in here but me.

894
01:10:08,062 --> 01:10:09,553
None of our friends...

895
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,526
...nobody.

896
01:10:20,808 --> 01:10:22,037
Wes?

897
01:10:23,277 --> 01:10:25,212
Have you thought of something?

898
01:10:25,412 --> 01:10:27,438
Yes, I was thinking....

899
01:10:28,148 --> 01:10:29,343
Yes?

900
01:10:35,723 --> 01:10:37,191
- You know, those--?
- What?

901
01:10:37,391 --> 01:10:41,055
Those magazine salesmen and people
who solicit for charities...?

902
01:10:41,261 --> 01:10:44,026
I've heard some are
fronts for burglaries.

903
01:10:44,231 --> 01:10:47,099
You sound like a Park Avenue
Sherlock Holmes.

904
01:10:47,301 --> 01:10:50,396
Go ahead and laugh.
Stranger things have happened.

905
01:10:50,604 --> 01:10:53,073
The best thing to do
is call the police.

906
01:10:53,273 --> 01:10:54,468
No!

907
01:10:54,675 --> 01:10:55,836
Why not?

908
01:10:56,143 --> 01:11:00,046
- The cheap publicity and all.
- Expensive fur isn't cheap publicity.

909
01:11:00,247 --> 01:11:01,875
And the insurance companies.

910
01:11:02,082 --> 01:11:06,611
If something's stolen, you're labeled
a bad risk and your premium goes up.

911
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:08,982
You're ridiculous.
I don't understand it.

912
01:11:09,189 --> 01:11:10,680
Well, I do!

913
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:15,954
I'll get a private detective.

914
01:11:16,964 --> 01:11:18,523
I know a good one.

915
01:11:18,966 --> 01:11:20,935
Private detective?

916
01:11:21,435 --> 01:11:24,303
This is real life,
not a television serial.

917
01:11:24,505 --> 01:11:27,771
- Mother lost a diamond--
- Let me do it without your mother.

918
01:11:30,944 --> 01:11:32,207
I didn't mean it that way.

919
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:34,041
Which way did you mean it?

920
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:38,844
I don't know.

921
01:11:39,653 --> 01:11:41,417
Wes, I'm your wife.

922
01:11:41,622 --> 01:11:44,786
- I wanna do things your way, even if--
- Think they're stupid?

923
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:50,063
I'll see you later.

924
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,599
Tom...

925
01:11:59,506 --> 01:12:01,998
...you know Gloria,
dark-haired, this high--

926
01:12:02,209 --> 01:12:05,008
You don't have to describe
Gloria to me.

927
01:12:05,345 --> 01:12:08,213
I'd know her with my eyes
closed, in a coal mine...

928
01:12:08,415 --> 01:12:09,508
...during an eclipse.

929
01:12:09,717 --> 01:12:12,482
- Has she been here tonight?
- Not for over a week.

930
01:12:12,686 --> 01:12:13,984
Let me tell you something.

931
01:12:14,188 --> 01:12:16,487
Without her, this place is dead.

932
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:20,218
She's like catnip
to every cat in town.

933
01:12:39,246 --> 01:12:41,215
- Give me a scotch and water.
- Liggett!

934
01:12:41,415 --> 01:12:44,317
- Haven't seen you around.
- Make that a double.

935
01:12:44,618 --> 01:12:46,587
- How are you?
- Two brandies.

936
01:12:46,787 --> 01:12:48,983
That's right.
I've been kind of busy.

937
01:12:49,289 --> 01:12:53,158
I heard. That's the business
I wouldn't mind having again.

938
01:12:54,061 --> 01:12:57,930
- What're you talking about?
- Come on, Liggett. Come on.

939
01:12:58,132 --> 01:12:59,725
Gloria!

940
01:12:59,967 --> 01:13:00,991
Sure.

941
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:05,229
She's frantic, isn't she?
Like a rocket right off the Earth.

942
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:07,670
Who should know better
than yours truly?

943
01:13:08,408 --> 01:13:11,139
Mother, help me.
I'd have left home for that.

944
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:13,837
She's got a traveling itch
like a flea.

945
01:13:14,047 --> 01:13:18,985
Hop, hop, hop. One dog to another.
She picks you up, and she drops you.

946
01:13:20,587 --> 01:13:23,216
Well, welcome to the fraternity.

947
01:13:23,624 --> 01:13:26,287
We meet once a year in Yankee Stadium.

948
01:13:30,697 --> 01:13:32,359
Now, listen, Butterfield 8...

949
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:35,461
...I've called her hundreds of times.

950
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:38,800
I'm her closest friend.

951
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,541
You've got to tell me where she is.

952
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:43,810
It's a matter of life and death!

953
01:13:50,617 --> 01:13:51,812
You're liars.

954
01:13:52,019 --> 01:13:54,386
Liars, all of you!
Thieves and liars!

955
01:13:54,588 --> 01:13:56,079
Now tell me!

956
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:22,547
- Do you know the speed limit here?
- No.

957
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:25,116
40 miles an hour,
posted every half-mile.

958
01:14:25,319 --> 01:14:27,447
- Do you know how fast you were going?
- No.

959
01:14:27,654 --> 01:14:31,182
65 miles an hour.
Let me see your license, please.

960
01:14:38,565 --> 01:14:39,464
Thank you.

961
01:14:39,666 --> 01:14:41,726
Turn your face around toward me.

962
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:43,301
Now breathe out.

963
01:14:44,738 --> 01:14:45,797
Thank you.

964
01:14:47,074 --> 01:14:48,633
You got troubled?

965
01:14:51,311 --> 01:14:53,405
- Yes.
- I thought so.

966
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:55,048
Let me give you some advice.

967
01:14:55,249 --> 01:14:57,150
Don't try to drive your troubles away.

968
01:14:57,351 --> 01:14:59,616
First, you're gonna be
mad at the world.

969
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:02,688
You push your foot down on that
gas pedal, and then you go.

970
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:05,824
Tomorrow, the sun will come out
like it did this morning.

971
01:15:06,026 --> 01:15:07,392
Take it easy.

972
01:15:21,074 --> 01:15:21,973
Cookies.

973
01:15:25,512 --> 01:15:27,003
So what was I saying?

974
01:15:27,214 --> 01:15:31,083
So she said to herself,
"You get in solid with the director.

975
01:15:31,285 --> 01:15:33,584
He puts you in solid
with the producer.

976
01:15:33,787 --> 01:15:35,949
You wind up with a big partnership."

977
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:39,786
So two days, or should I say,
two nights later...

978
01:15:39,993 --> 01:15:41,825
...she was in, butt solid.

979
01:15:42,029 --> 01:15:44,692
Yeah, with the director,
with his cousin....

980
01:15:44,898 --> 01:15:49,461
She was so busy being in solid with
every Tom, Dick, Harry and George...

981
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:53,198
...she wouldn't recognize a producer
if one was under her pillow.

982
01:15:53,407 --> 01:15:54,705
Do you take sugar?

983
01:15:54,908 --> 01:15:58,276
So now time passes,
and our heroine is very big.

984
01:15:58,478 --> 01:16:00,913
Yeah, but not in the theater.

985
01:16:01,114 --> 01:16:02,912
No, in all the wrong places.

986
01:16:03,116 --> 01:16:05,415
In 500 little black books...

987
01:16:06,019 --> 01:16:07,385
...28 divorce cases...

988
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:13,123
...two police blotters and one
restraining sheet in Bellevue's ward.

989
01:16:13,327 --> 01:16:14,454
Are you sure?

990
01:16:16,296 --> 01:16:20,825
Yeah, she hit it big.
From a size 12 dress to a size 44.

991
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:23,902
She went from looking
like an orchid...

992
01:16:24,104 --> 01:16:26,232
...to a face like a pan of worms.

993
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:27,965
And all because...

994
01:16:28,175 --> 01:16:31,407
...she said, "With only a rag,
a bone, a hank of hair...

995
01:16:31,611 --> 01:16:33,705
...I will move the world my way!"

996
01:16:33,914 --> 01:16:35,883
What's the matter? I'm boring you?

997
01:16:40,787 --> 01:16:42,722
You live it up.

998
01:16:42,923 --> 01:16:46,291
You kick up your heels.
You grab everything you can get.

999
01:16:46,493 --> 01:16:50,225
"You light the candle from one end
to the other," like they say.

1000
01:16:51,999 --> 01:16:55,128
And then one day, you too can be...

1001
01:16:55,335 --> 01:16:57,429
...the proud proprietor...

1002
01:16:57,637 --> 01:17:01,540
...of a very heavily mortgaged,
roadside brothel...

1003
01:17:02,776 --> 01:17:04,677
...and wish you were dead.

1004
01:17:07,247 --> 01:17:08,681
Good morning, darling.

1005
01:17:14,988 --> 01:17:17,548
- What time did you get in last night?
- Late.

1006
01:17:17,991 --> 01:17:20,187
Did the private detective have any--?

1007
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:21,758
Detective?

1008
01:17:21,962 --> 01:17:24,864
- The man you'll see about the coat.
- Oh, him.

1009
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:26,589
He was on a job.

1010
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,530
I'm gonna see him again today.

1011
01:17:41,248 --> 01:17:42,841
I've seen you drink...

1012
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:45,610
...many times, but never
in the morning like this.

1013
01:17:46,219 --> 01:17:48,688
Don't worry, Emily.
It's not alcoholism.

1014
01:17:49,856 --> 01:17:51,848
It's just a kind of medicine.

1015
01:17:54,327 --> 01:17:55,852
Why don't you go back to bed?

1016
01:17:56,063 --> 01:17:57,395
I can't.

1017
01:17:58,398 --> 01:18:00,731
I have to go and look
for your fur coat.

1018
01:18:00,934 --> 01:18:02,766
Why do you feel so responsible?

1019
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:05,905
- It disappeared while I was here.
- No one's blaming you.

1020
01:18:06,106 --> 01:18:07,472
- That's not the point.
- What is?

1021
01:18:13,313 --> 01:18:17,648
I could tell you things about
people, but never mind.

1022
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:20,681
You have enough problems of your own.

1023
01:18:22,089 --> 01:18:24,285
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes.

1024
01:18:24,891 --> 01:18:29,522
When I come back with that coat, which
I will, I want you to throw me out.

1025
01:18:38,605 --> 01:18:40,836
- Hi, Mama.
- Hello, darling.

1026
01:18:43,643 --> 01:18:45,043
That looks pretty.

1027
01:18:45,245 --> 01:18:48,272
- You might like it for your bathroom.
- I would.

1028
01:18:49,382 --> 01:18:52,284
I'm sorry I didn't
come home last night.

1029
01:18:52,486 --> 01:18:53,977
That's all right.

1030
01:18:54,287 --> 01:18:56,153
I spent the night in a motel.

1031
01:18:59,326 --> 01:19:00,794
Alone.

1032
01:19:01,261 --> 01:19:02,889
I had some thinking to do.

1033
01:19:09,936 --> 01:19:11,529
I saw a woman.

1034
01:19:12,139 --> 01:19:15,803
Utterly proper,
utterly conventional...

1035
01:19:16,343 --> 01:19:18,073
...utterly beautiful.

1036
01:19:22,182 --> 01:19:24,117
You're beautiful too, dear.

1037
01:19:26,186 --> 01:19:27,916
I have a face.

1038
01:19:28,655 --> 01:19:32,285
- That's not the kind of beauty I mean.
- What kind of beauty?

1039
01:19:35,328 --> 01:19:39,732
The kind that comes
from self-respect, I guess.

1040
01:19:39,933 --> 01:19:41,424
It shines.

1041
01:19:41,868 --> 01:19:43,632
I've seen that kind.

1042
01:19:43,837 --> 01:19:46,068
It takes a lifetime to find.

1043
01:19:46,373 --> 01:19:48,274
I'm going to find it.

1044
01:19:48,842 --> 01:19:50,208
I think you will.

1045
01:19:51,178 --> 01:19:52,305
Butterfield 8 called.

1046
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:54,448
Any messages?

1047
01:19:54,714 --> 01:19:59,209
Mr. Liggett says he has to see you.
It's a matter of life and death.

1048
01:20:01,788 --> 01:20:03,586
Did he say when or where?

1049
01:20:03,857 --> 01:20:05,416
I've written it down.

1050
01:20:38,091 --> 01:20:39,354
So you did take it.

1051
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:44,894
Yes. And I'm sorry, Liggett.

1052
01:20:45,398 --> 01:20:46,388
May I sit down?

1053
01:20:47,534 --> 01:20:48,797
That's up to you, honey.

1054
01:20:58,378 --> 01:21:02,372
- Would you care to order something?
- No, the lady's not going to order.

1055
01:21:06,753 --> 01:21:09,018
Why did you bother to bring it back?

1056
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:11,689
Because it isn't mine.

1057
01:21:12,225 --> 01:21:14,251
Because you're scared, you mean.

1058
01:21:16,129 --> 01:21:19,566
Because you know I'm not an ordinary
Joe on your sleigh ride.

1059
01:21:19,766 --> 01:21:22,668
Because you know, while I might
have given you the world...

1060
01:21:23,403 --> 01:21:26,999
...I'd tear your head off if you
stole as much as a nickel from me.

1061
01:21:27,207 --> 01:21:28,038
Isn't that it?

1062
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:31,271
No.

1063
01:21:33,079 --> 01:21:36,174
So you pick up the man
when you want...

1064
01:21:37,083 --> 01:21:39,018
...and drop him like a bomb...

1065
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,988
...when you want.

1066
01:21:44,391 --> 01:21:46,223
Get lost! We're talking!

1067
01:21:52,999 --> 01:21:55,468
People don't mean anything to you,
do they?

1068
01:21:56,603 --> 01:21:58,572
The way they feel in here.

1069
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:01,337
Not down where you live.

1070
01:22:04,377 --> 01:22:06,278
I care about some people.

1071
01:22:06,613 --> 01:22:07,876
For an hour...

1072
01:22:08,081 --> 01:22:11,916
...or a day or a week.
Till you've had your kicks.

1073
01:22:12,619 --> 01:22:14,918
Then you slither off to the next one.

1074
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:18,458
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1075
01:22:18,658 --> 01:22:20,650
There isn't gonna be any tomorrow.

1076
01:22:21,294 --> 01:22:23,559
And for once,
somebody's going to drop you.

1077
01:22:23,763 --> 01:22:27,291
Go ahead, try that heel trick again.
The one that gets the boys hot.

1078
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,264
And I'll rip this arm right out!

1079
01:22:31,438 --> 01:22:33,066
- May I say something?
- Sure...

1080
01:22:33,273 --> 01:22:37,438
...honey, babe, dollface, kid.
Say something sexy!

1081
01:22:37,644 --> 01:22:40,580
Something that always got the boys
headed for the motel.

1082
01:22:42,015 --> 01:22:44,917
You can't have everything in life.

1083
01:22:45,652 --> 01:22:50,488
Be grateful for the few things you do
get, no matter where they come from.

1084
01:22:51,191 --> 01:22:52,318
The pornographic...

1085
01:22:52,525 --> 01:22:53,925
...philosopher!

1086
01:22:55,228 --> 01:22:58,221
Now, you just sit there
like a good tramp should...

1087
01:22:58,498 --> 01:23:00,558
...until I get out of your sight.

1088
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:03,601
I can't stomach being seen
in public with you.

1089
01:23:04,304 --> 01:23:05,135
Liggett.

1090
01:23:05,338 --> 01:23:07,739
And don't you dare
mention my name again!

1091
01:23:08,241 --> 01:23:11,700
You're a dirty joke, from one
end of this town to the other!

1092
01:23:11,911 --> 01:23:15,313
- That will be enough of that.
- Mind your own business!

1093
01:23:15,515 --> 01:23:17,609
- Now, look.
- Take it easy.

1094
01:23:17,817 --> 01:23:20,787
There's other women in this place,
including my wife.

1095
01:23:25,558 --> 01:23:28,084
Hey! Take it easy, pal! Come on!

1096
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:32,199
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1097
01:23:35,368 --> 01:23:37,860
I just must have
gone berserk, I guess.

1098
01:23:38,738 --> 01:23:41,264
He's gonna be all right.
I'm awfully sorry, miss.

1099
01:23:41,474 --> 01:23:43,409
Can I help you?

1100
01:24:24,535 --> 01:24:25,833
Mr. Liggett!

1101
01:24:26,236 --> 01:24:28,762
- Good heavens, what happened?
- Get away.

1102
01:24:28,972 --> 01:24:30,270
Liggett?

1103
01:24:31,708 --> 01:24:34,007
For a lousy fur coat, you'd do this?

1104
01:24:36,146 --> 01:24:39,480
You want me to give this back
to my wife after you touched it?

1105
01:25:44,414 --> 01:25:45,814
Leave me alone.

1106
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:51,048
Do you want a doctor?

1107
01:25:52,155 --> 01:25:55,683
Yes, and tell him to make me
unconscious before I can think.

1108
01:26:19,449 --> 01:26:20,610
Who is it?

1109
01:26:21,852 --> 01:26:23,047
Who is it?

1110
01:26:24,254 --> 01:26:25,586
It's me.

1111
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:48,569
Can I get you anything?

1112
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:11,993
Ask me about the coat, Steve.

1113
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:13,870
Ask me.

1114
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,975
I see you still have it.

1115
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:25,676
Because it's mine.

1116
01:27:29,553 --> 01:27:31,146
Every skin.

1117
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:34,118
Every thread.

1118
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:36,589
Every hair...

1119
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:39,057
...is mine.

1120
01:27:42,132 --> 01:27:43,794
And do you know why?

1121
01:27:46,036 --> 01:27:46,867
Why?

1122
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:51,465
Because I earned it.

1123
01:27:52,509 --> 01:27:55,138
Pretty good pay for one week.

1124
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:58,515
$1000 in fur a day.

1125
01:28:01,485 --> 01:28:03,454
You and Liggett couldn't make it?

1126
01:28:05,722 --> 01:28:08,317
That isn't the important thing now.

1127
01:28:10,794 --> 01:28:13,559
The important thing is, Steve...

1128
01:28:13,797 --> 01:28:15,129
...I took money.

1129
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:17,858
- Do you know what that makes me?
- Baby, don't.

1130
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:27,341
Let me cry.

1131
01:28:28,311 --> 01:28:31,008
Let me cry!

1132
01:28:31,782 --> 01:28:35,446
Like all the times I should have...

1133
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:38,087
...and never could.

1134
01:29:02,646 --> 01:29:04,615
I have to tell you something.

1135
01:29:04,815 --> 01:29:08,081
- I know all about you, Gloria.
- You don't know this.

1136
01:29:09,085 --> 01:29:11,077
Nobody knows this...

1137
01:29:13,156 --> 01:29:17,218
...except a certain man somewhere...

1138
01:29:18,461 --> 01:29:23,399
...who I'd like to think of as standing
in a lake filled with burning gasoline.

1139
01:29:27,304 --> 01:29:29,205
Please, listen.

1140
01:29:36,346 --> 01:29:37,974
I was 13.

1141
01:29:39,382 --> 01:29:41,248
My father was dead.

1142
01:29:43,086 --> 01:29:46,523
All older men seemed
like fathers to me.

1143
01:29:48,358 --> 01:29:50,589
But I wanted one of my own...

1144
01:29:52,462 --> 01:29:54,522
...to sit in his lap...

1145
01:29:55,565 --> 01:29:56,999
...to hug him...

1146
01:29:59,069 --> 01:30:01,664
...and have him say I was beautiful.

1147
01:30:05,675 --> 01:30:07,871
Do you remember Major Hartley?

1148
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:09,405
I remember him.

1149
01:30:13,383 --> 01:30:15,284
Major Hartley.

1150
01:30:16,219 --> 01:30:18,154
My mother's friend.

1151
01:30:21,191 --> 01:30:26,129
He came down to Grand Central Station
one day to pick me up from camp.

1152
01:30:27,564 --> 01:30:29,396
Mother was away visiting.

1153
01:30:30,567 --> 01:30:32,229
He took me home.

1154
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:36,335
He let me sit on his lap.

1155
01:30:37,507 --> 01:30:39,271
He let me hug him.

1156
01:30:41,244 --> 01:30:43,713
He told me I was beautiful.

1157
01:30:45,515 --> 01:30:48,280
He stayed in that house
for one week...

1158
01:30:48,618 --> 01:30:53,556
...and taught me more about evil than
any 13-year-old girl in the world knew.

1159
01:30:53,757 --> 01:30:54,952
Don't.

1160
01:30:55,592 --> 01:30:58,528
You haven't heard the worst of it yet!

1161
01:30:58,728 --> 01:31:00,822
I loved it!

1162
01:31:01,264 --> 01:31:05,599
Every awful moment of it, I loved!

1163
01:31:06,469 --> 01:31:09,303
That's your Gloria, Steve!

1164
01:31:09,506 --> 01:31:12,772
That's your darling Gloria!

1165
01:31:18,915 --> 01:31:21,612
I made a way of life out of it.

1166
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:26,383
The deep shame of it didn't
hit me until it was too late.

1167
01:31:29,092 --> 01:31:31,823
I couldn't go back to 13 again.

1168
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:36,993
I had one chance to stop it.

1169
01:31:38,101 --> 01:31:40,229
One last chance.

1170
01:31:42,696 --> 01:31:44,130
And I...

1171
01:31:44,590 --> 01:31:46,650
...I threw it...

1172
01:31:46,859 --> 01:31:49,522
...all away for 32 animals...

1173
01:31:49,729 --> 01:31:53,029
...sewn together in a coat.

1174
01:31:57,069 --> 01:31:59,766
It's not all over.
Give it another chance.

1175
01:32:01,707 --> 01:32:02,675
Where you going?

1176
01:32:02,875 --> 01:32:04,707
- It doesn't matter.
- Wait!

1177
01:32:05,111 --> 01:32:07,671
It matters a great deal,
what you do.

1178
01:32:09,949 --> 01:32:12,885
You've got to decide
what you're gonna do next.

1179
01:32:13,185 --> 01:32:14,551
I do too.

1180
01:32:14,854 --> 01:32:16,584
Stay here tonight.

1181
01:32:34,273 --> 01:32:36,037
Thank you, Steve.

1182
01:33:00,166 --> 01:33:01,896
Anything you need?

1183
01:33:03,936 --> 01:33:05,871
There is. A divorce.

1184
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,532
There's no call for such remorse
over last night.

1185
01:33:10,743 --> 01:33:12,268
Let's face it, Emily.

1186
01:33:12,611 --> 01:33:15,012
I'm a failure as a husband
and as a man.

1187
01:33:16,182 --> 01:33:17,445
Wes, I love you!

1188
01:33:18,884 --> 01:33:19,715
I know you do.

1189
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:25,385
That makes the divorce
all the more necessary...

1190
01:33:25,591 --> 01:33:28,186
...because I can't go on
disappointing you.

1191
01:33:28,527 --> 01:33:31,361
- Couldn't you try?
- No.

1192
01:33:36,669 --> 01:33:38,160
Do you love her?

1193
01:33:38,704 --> 01:33:41,264
- That woman you were with.
- I seem to.

1194
01:33:42,108 --> 01:33:44,771
But you fought over her
and sent her away in a rage.

1195
01:33:45,845 --> 01:33:47,313
Yes, I did.

1196
01:33:48,514 --> 01:33:51,609
I was sick because I was afraid
I was going to lose her.

1197
01:33:51,984 --> 01:33:55,284
I hated her unreasonably because
I couldn't stand losing her.

1198
01:33:56,722 --> 01:33:58,884
Just as you hate me now.

1199
01:34:47,673 --> 01:34:48,800
Good morning.

1200
01:34:49,008 --> 01:34:50,704
Good morning, sweetheart.

1201
01:34:51,177 --> 01:34:54,841
Open your eyes good and make sure
you know who you're talking to.

1202
01:34:55,681 --> 01:34:58,515
- Norma, isn't it?
- Shrewd guess.

1203
01:35:08,494 --> 01:35:09,792
I wanna marry you today.

1204
01:35:16,602 --> 01:35:19,003
I haven't anything else to do.

1205
01:35:19,672 --> 01:35:21,971
Good. I'll be ready in a minute.

1206
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:28,974
Fine. Thank you very much.

1207
01:35:29,181 --> 01:35:30,877
Okay. Bye.

1208
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:35,913
I've just called Butterfield 8
to shut off the service...

1209
01:35:36,122 --> 01:35:37,750
...and to send me a bill.

1210
01:35:39,758 --> 01:35:43,286
As soon as I have an address in
Boston, will you forward it to me?

1211
01:35:43,496 --> 01:35:45,158
Yes, dear, I will.

1212
01:35:50,002 --> 01:35:51,595
Take care of Mama.

1213
01:35:51,804 --> 01:35:54,171
I've got plans for her.
My cousin Harry.

1214
01:35:54,373 --> 01:35:57,241
- Oh, Frances!
- I'm a born matchmaker.

1215
01:35:57,443 --> 01:35:58,536
10%, of course.

1216
01:35:58,777 --> 01:36:00,439
Naturally!

1217
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:04,343
I don't want to be a nosy
neighbor, but why Boston?

1218
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:07,476
That's where the Pilgrims
made a fresh start.

1219
01:36:07,686 --> 01:36:10,246
If it's good enough for them,
I can take it.

1220
01:36:10,523 --> 01:36:11,991
Can Boston take you?

1221
01:36:12,191 --> 01:36:14,160
What will you do in Boston, dear?

1222
01:36:14,693 --> 01:36:19,097
Well, I'll buy a paper.
Look up the want ads.

1223
01:36:19,298 --> 01:36:21,665
Same as any girl without a job.

1224
01:36:21,867 --> 01:36:25,804
Before we all start crying,
let's get the luggage in the car.

1225
01:36:26,338 --> 01:36:28,603
This is as close
as I'll ever get to heaven.

1226
01:36:28,807 --> 01:36:30,105
Do you like it?

1227
01:36:30,509 --> 01:36:33,809
Of course not. I'm only faint
from not eating in three days.

1228
01:36:34,013 --> 01:36:35,174
It's yours.

1229
01:36:35,381 --> 01:36:36,212
No.

1230
01:36:37,082 --> 01:36:38,311
Wear it in good health.

1231
01:36:38,651 --> 01:36:41,314
Oh, no.
You can't bribe me with this.

1232
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:45,457
I could never say a mean word about
you ever again. I'd die of boredom.

1233
01:36:46,058 --> 01:36:48,527
Well, then just keep it warm for me.

1234
01:36:53,132 --> 01:36:54,725
Goodbye, Mama.

1235
01:36:58,370 --> 01:37:00,566
I don't want you to go.

1236
01:37:04,176 --> 01:37:06,907
I have a feeling
you'll never come back.

1237
01:37:08,147 --> 01:37:10,514
I never will come back, Mama.

1238
01:37:11,884 --> 01:37:14,979
But I'll send for you
as soon as I can.

1239
01:37:28,267 --> 01:37:31,032
Did she leave any forwarding
address or number?

1240
01:37:34,039 --> 01:37:35,234
Now, look...

1241
01:37:36,075 --> 01:37:39,341
...this is the most important
telephone call of my life.

1242
01:37:39,845 --> 01:37:41,973
You must tell me, please.

1243
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:46,079
Boston?

1244
01:37:47,086 --> 01:37:48,384
You're certain?

1245
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:52,752
Thank you, Butterfield 8.

1246
01:37:53,525 --> 01:37:54,720
Thanks.

1247
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:44,603
Don't be frightened, Gloria. Please.

1248
01:38:55,187 --> 01:38:57,383
I can only think of one apology.

1249
01:38:58,023 --> 01:38:59,548
Will you marry me?

1250
01:39:00,359 --> 01:39:02,328
I've arranged for a divorce.

1251
01:39:02,594 --> 01:39:03,857
Wait for me and...

1252
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:07,261
...I'll make you forget every word
I uttered last night.

1253
01:39:08,367 --> 01:39:09,665
You can't.

1254
01:39:10,769 --> 01:39:12,965
I'm left with those words.

1255
01:39:13,605 --> 01:39:15,597
I'm branded with them.

1256
01:39:17,976 --> 01:39:19,968
Thank you for asking me to marry you.

1257
01:39:24,683 --> 01:39:28,381
If only you'd done it yesterday,
it might have meant something.

1258
01:39:29,321 --> 01:39:30,482
But not today.

1259
01:39:30,723 --> 01:39:32,783
But I only did
what I did last night...

1260
01:39:32,991 --> 01:39:35,756
...because you were so much
in my blood that I exploded.

1261
01:39:37,596 --> 01:39:39,690
But you were right last night.

1262
01:39:40,899 --> 01:39:43,368
No man could marry me...

1263
01:39:43,569 --> 01:39:45,561
...and not keep remembering.

1264
01:39:48,741 --> 01:39:52,576
You'd have to explode
at my life, past and....

1265
01:39:54,146 --> 01:39:56,342
You couldn't help but explode.

1266
01:40:00,252 --> 01:40:02,881
I can think of a dozen apologies.

1267
01:40:03,088 --> 01:40:04,852
Oh, I know.

1268
01:40:05,324 --> 01:40:07,088
And I'd accept.

1269
01:40:07,693 --> 01:40:09,423
But then look.

1270
01:40:10,028 --> 01:40:13,123
Look at all the thousands
of explosions ahead...

1271
01:40:13,332 --> 01:40:16,302
...and the thousands
of apologies and acceptances...

1272
01:40:16,502 --> 01:40:20,496
- ...until we both got so disgusted.
- I love you. I love you.

1273
01:40:23,909 --> 01:40:25,775
And I love you.

1274
01:40:28,614 --> 01:40:31,584
It's no use. It's no damn use.

1275
01:40:33,619 --> 01:40:35,178
Let's go someplace to talk.

1276
01:40:36,655 --> 01:40:37,850
Over at Happy's.

1277
01:40:38,056 --> 01:40:39,490
Just talk.

1278
01:40:39,958 --> 01:40:42,792
Just so that we can be
together and alone.

1279
01:40:43,562 --> 01:40:45,997
So that I can tell you
what I want to do.

1280
01:40:47,332 --> 01:40:49,699
If I get in a room with you...

1281
01:40:50,702 --> 01:40:53,001
...together, alone...

1282
01:40:53,205 --> 01:40:54,833
...I know what will happen.

1283
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,339
It'll be the same thing
all over again.

1284
01:40:58,076 --> 01:41:00,568
We started this whole thing together.

1285
01:41:02,281 --> 01:41:05,217
We're obligated to solve it together.

1286
01:41:05,818 --> 01:41:07,184
Please.

1287
01:41:30,676 --> 01:41:32,304
Hello, Mr. Liggett.

1288
01:41:32,711 --> 01:41:35,237
You brought another weary traveler.

1289
01:41:35,447 --> 01:41:37,006
Hi, honey.

1290
01:41:37,616 --> 01:41:38,606
Welcome home.

1291
01:41:39,184 --> 01:41:42,086
- Give me a key, Happy.
- Keys, that's my business.

1292
01:41:42,788 --> 01:41:45,690
- Here pass the most beautiful--
- Give me a key.

1293
01:41:45,924 --> 01:41:47,950
Yeah, yeah. Right away.

1294
01:45:37,656 --> 01:45:39,386
You saw the accident?

1295
01:45:40,559 --> 01:45:41,618
Yes.

1296
01:45:41,993 --> 01:45:43,291
Your name, please.

1297
01:45:43,495 --> 01:45:44,986
Weston Liggett.

1298
01:45:45,430 --> 01:45:48,423
1038 Fifth Avenue, New York City.

1299
01:45:48,734 --> 01:45:52,830
I stopped that same girl for speeding.
I wish I'd put her in jail then.

1300
01:45:53,038 --> 01:45:55,701
- They didn't make her name yet?
- No.

1301
01:45:55,907 --> 01:45:58,604
- Gloria Wandrous.
- You knew her?

1302
01:46:00,612 --> 01:46:02,706
We were traveling north...

1303
01:46:03,482 --> 01:46:04,677
...together.

1304
01:46:25,137 --> 01:46:28,266
You're going to read about it
in the newspapers tomorrow.

1305
01:46:30,041 --> 01:46:31,441
The family name...

1306
01:46:31,843 --> 01:46:34,005
...your picture, my picture...

1307
01:46:34,446 --> 01:46:35,744
...everything.

1308
01:46:38,383 --> 01:46:39,578
I'm...

1309
01:46:40,185 --> 01:46:41,517
...sorry.

1310
01:46:43,054 --> 01:46:45,114
I don't understand.

1311
01:46:45,323 --> 01:46:47,952
- What's happened? Tell me.
- She's dead.

1312
01:46:49,561 --> 01:46:51,689
She lived for an hour unconscious.

1313
01:46:52,164 --> 01:46:54,258
- But she's dead.
- Who?

1314
01:46:56,101 --> 01:46:57,592
- That girl?
- Yes.

1315
01:46:58,770 --> 01:47:01,171
- Terrible.
- Automobile accident.

1316
01:47:03,275 --> 01:47:04,538
She was...

1317
01:47:04,776 --> 01:47:06,938
...trying to get away from me.

1318
01:47:08,013 --> 01:47:11,609
I'm sorry. So sorry.

1319
01:47:13,451 --> 01:47:17,752
I don't suppose that anybody would
think that she was a good person.

1320
01:47:19,691 --> 01:47:21,853
But, strangely enough, she was.

1321
01:47:23,261 --> 01:47:27,062
On the surface, she was all
sex and devil-may-care.

1322
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:32,465
Yet everything in her was
struggling toward respectability.

1323
01:47:34,172 --> 01:47:36,107
She never gave up trying.

1324
01:47:49,554 --> 01:47:52,353
I'm going out looking for my pride.

1325
01:47:52,557 --> 01:47:53,752
Alone.

1326
01:47:55,026 --> 01:47:58,929
When I find it, if you're here,
I'll come back.

1327
01:48:00,232 --> 01:48:01,860
And we'll see if it...

1328
01:48:02,467 --> 01:48:04,333
...still has any value...

1329
01:48:04,569 --> 01:48:05,730
...to either of us.
