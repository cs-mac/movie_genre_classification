00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:52,196
Hi, and welcome back to
another episode of <i>Télévision Educative</i>.

2
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,948
Tonight, l will show you
how dreams are prepared.

3
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,451
People think it's a very simple
and easy process...

4
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,871
...but it's a bit more
complicated than that.

5
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:06,919
As you can see, a very delicate combination
of complex ingredients is the key.

6
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:11,048
First, we put in some random thoughts.

7
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:18,388
And then we add a little bit
of reminiscences of the day...

8
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,352
...mixed with some memories
from the past.

9
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,312
That's for two people.

10
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:30,901
Love, friendships, relationships,
and all those ''ships'' ...

11
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,654
...together with songs you heard
during the day...

12
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,616
...things you saw and also...personal.

13
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,869
Okay. Okay, l think it's one.

14
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,248
There it goes. Yes. Yes.

15
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,583
Okay, we have to run.

16
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,590
l'm talking quietly to not
wake myself up.

17
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,592
l'm with my dad.

18
00:02:56,218 --> 00:03:01,557
<i>Yes, Dad. I remember.</i>
<i>My father was there.</i>

19
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,768
<i>It's nice to see him healthy</i>
<i>and normal again.</i>

20
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:07,354
<i>I almost forgot how he looked.</i>

21
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,273
<i>Handsome, no?</i>

22
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,817
<i>Oh, yeah, oh yeah, we're in a concert.</i>

23
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:15,904
<i>A Duke Ellington concert.</i>
<i>Yes, my man, Duke Ellington.</i>

24
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,783
<i>And the band starts to play.</i>
<i>Bass, drums and all.</i>

25
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,411
<i>It's amazing, they got this super swing.</i>

26
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,371
<i>And the Duke enters the stage.</i>

27
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:28,375
<i>He's radiant, in a glowing white tuxedo.</i>

28
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:50,981
<i>Dad, this is not Duke Ellington,</i>
<i>but Duck Ellington.</i>

29
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,774
<i>This is a dream.</i>

30
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:58,906
<i>I'm sorry, Dad, but you're dead.</i>

31
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,575
<i>You've lost the battle to cancer.</i>

32
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,870
<i>No, no. I cried so hard.</i>

33
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:09,499
<i>I could feel my tears forming</i>
<i>two rivers under my eyes.</i>

34
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,961
<i>In dreams, emotions are overwhelming.</i>

35
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:05,217
<i>Come in, action two.</i>
<i>Can you complete the mission?</i>

36
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,476
Ski?

37
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,636
-English very well.
-Oh, good, good.

38
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,972
-Yes, picture one is a duck.
-Me too.

39
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,562
Am l not supposed to design
the new calendar collection?

40
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,772
No, no, l'm afraid not.

41
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:51,485
Because my mother,
she told me this was a creative job.

42
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,237
This doesn't look creative at all.

43
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,907
You know,
l think there's a misunderstanding.

44
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,325
Can l see?

45
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,952
-Sure.
-Yeah?

46
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:09,753
This is nice.

47
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:12,297
Yeah, not bad, eh?

48
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,924
l'll tell you what.

49
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:17,135
Take the portfolio and
let's talk to the big boss here, okay?

50
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,097
The collection is crap anyway.

51
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:23,433
Welcome in this palace, Stéphane.

52
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,811
Stéphane is a great artist
with a foreign accent.

53
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:27,437
He'd like to suggest something.

54
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,941
What about the ski weekend?
Did you put him on the list?

55
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:35,112
You see, Stéphane, it's very, very important
to stimulate the team spirit.

56
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,197
Martine.

57
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,330
You should show him your work, okay?
Be brave, Stéphane.

58
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,127
Well, it's still a bit of a work in progress.

59
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:53,297
l've done 1 2 paintings for a calendar.

60
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:00,012
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

61
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:04,641
We will be reaching Paris' Charles de Gaulle
in 6 hours and 45 minutes.

62
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,186
Please enjoy the flight,
fasten your seat belts...

63
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:11,190
...and if you have any questions,
please don't hesitate to:

64
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:16,111
The pilot will never finish the sentence.

65
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:20,741
Flight 800, on July 1 7th, 1 996...

66
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:23,118
...disappears from the sky.

67
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:26,705
Spraying its 230 passengers
all over the North Atlantic.

68
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,708
The whole world is in shock.

69
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:33,879
Quiet morning,
like any other morning.

70
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:39,259
A huge earthquake
rattles the center of the town.

71
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:44,473
Each month has its own
most infamous disaster event...

72
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,683
...engraved in the collective memory.

73
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,146
lt's a concept l've been trying to
work on and developing.

74
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,731
lt's called disasterology.

75
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,983
Stéphane, you are not serious.

76
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,319
Oh, l am very serious.

77
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:00,405
lt's the customer that needs
a little bit of a sense of humor.

78
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,617
My customers don't have
any sense of humor.

79
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:09,206
They want puppies, trucks,
flowers or nudes. That's all.

80
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:12,835
Come on, Guy, show him his work.
lt's getting late now.

81
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,882
Come on, Stéphane, let's go.

82
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,681
You shave with a cracker?

83
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,410
Oh, you little asshole!

84
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,507
Sorry, no. No, no, no.
l need a break. No, no, no.

85
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,635
No, no, l need a little break.
Serge, l need a little break.

86
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:45,969
Guy, just a tiny one.

87
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,400
<i>La pampa</i> is in Argentina, you idiot!

88
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,654
What about Yucat<i>?</i>n, Palenque, Kerala?

89
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,095
Get out.

90
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:34,077
<i>Come in, action two.</i>
<i>Can you complete the mission?</i>

91
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:38,290
<i>Come in, action two.</i>
<i>Can you complete the mission?</i>

92
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:41,877
<i>Come in, action two.</i>
<i>Can you complete the mission?</i>

93
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:45,547
<i>Come in, action two.</i>
<i>Can you complete the mission?</i>

94
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,717
<i>Come in, action two.</i>
<i>Can you complete the mission?</i>

95
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,845
<i>Come in, action two.</i>
<i>Can you complete the mission?</i>

96
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,264
lt's 7:30.

97
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,229
Hello?

98
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,234
Are you trying to mock me on the air?

99
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,319
A creative job,
ls that what you call it?

100
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:35,305
No, Mam-- Mama. Mama!

101
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,822
Excuse me for this interruption.

102
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,660
Yeah, that's my father.

103
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,049
P.S.R.:

104
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:57,554
Parallel synchronized randomness.

105
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:03,727
An interesting brain rarity
and our subject for today.

106
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:09,525
Two people walk in opposite directions
at the same time...

107
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:13,737
...and then they make the same decision
at the same time.

108
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:16,323
Then they correct it,
and then they correct it...

109
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,618
...and then they correct it
and then they correct it....

110
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:22,079
Basically, in a mathematical world...

111
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:25,374
...these two little guys will
stay looped for the end of time.

112
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,377
The brain is the most complex thing
in the universe...

113
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,587
...and it's right behind the nose.

114
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,132
Fascinating!

115
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,512
l'm sorry, l'm sorry.
l'm sorry about this.

116
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:39,972
Stay calm.

117
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:44,852
l think that's just that they are
renovating the studio right behind here.

118
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,809
-You are Spanish, no?
-No.

119
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,394
-No?
-l'm from Mexico.

120
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,188
But my mother is French.

121
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:15,734
Yeah, l just came here because
my father died of cancer.

122
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:22,616
Okay. You know,
that looks pretty bad.

123
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,455
You think l have to go
to the hospital?

124
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:32,125
Beause it's not looking that good....

125
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,054
Good stuff for you.

126
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:48,475
Okay?

127
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,730
-lt's strong.
-lt's mint. lt's mint.

128
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,861
-Yeah, l feel it working already.
-Yeah? Okay.

129
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:04,324
-So, what's your name?
-Stéphane.

130
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,952
Stéphane? Stéphanie.

131
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:09,413
Stéphane, Stéphanie.
Stéphanie, Stéphane.

132
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:12,416
Click-clack, catch, match.
She has no boyfriend.

133
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:17,963
-And you? You...?
-Zoé.

134
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,175
You know,
Stéphanie is a talented composer.

135
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,803
-You should hear what she makes.
-That's bullshit. l never play it.

136
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,515
You know, a pretty girl with talent,
that deserves to be mentioned.

137
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,225
Yeah.

138
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,102
And what's your job?

139
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:35,898
l'm a promotional calendar
maquettiste. Yeah, it's--

140
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:12,476
That's typical from Sylvain.

141
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:15,437
He asks you to help and then
he lets you do all the work.

142
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:17,564
l am sorry.

143
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:28,242
So what does it mean exactly,
promotional calendar maquettist?

144
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:32,996
Maquettiste. lt's--
l don't know.

145
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,543
l don't know. lt's really boring, actually.

146
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:40,629
But l mean, there's one profession
l really wanna pursue...

147
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:42,297
...which is inventor.

148
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:45,384
-lnventing what?
-Well, l can show you.

149
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:48,220
l have some glasses...

150
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:50,848
...where you can see real life in 3-D.

151
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,183
lsn't life already in 3-D?

152
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,144
No-- Yeah, but--

153
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:59,523
Come on, l mean,
Do you wanna-- Do you wanna try it?

154
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:02,067
This, for example:

155
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:04,486
Look, look, look.

156
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:10,158
-lt works, no?
-Yeah, yeah.

157
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:19,126
You know Pulfrich, the guy who
discovered the 3-D effect?

158
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:20,794
He had only one eye.

159
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:24,047
And that makes him, like, the Beethoven
of the stereo, you know?

160
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,179
And what do you girls do?
Are you students or work?

161
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:32,973
-No, we're--
-No, we're creative executives.

162
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,894
We're going to concerts
and we find bands to sign.

163
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:38,103
To sign what?

164
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,272
Oh, she means that we're working
in music.

165
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,608
What company?

166
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:45,152
Aristotle.

167
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:47,821
Like, as the turtle, no?

168
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:50,449
No, no, no.
Like the philosopher. You know?

169
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,250
l'm gonna go.

170
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:11,428
How do you know Sylvain?

171
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:14,932
-Sylvain?
-Yeah.

172
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,768
-From Mexico. Yeah.
-Oh, Mexico.

173
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:19,728
He never said anything about it.

174
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:22,439
No? l don't know why. Bye-bye.

175
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:25,776
-You want us to drive you back?
-No, l'm okay.

176
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:50,634
To screw. Maybe yes, maybe no.

177
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:53,971
Maybe rain, maybe snow.

178
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,639
Okay, baby.

179
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:08,652
lt's three times this week
he puts his ass on the <i>poubelle.</i>

180
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:14,199
-We're not gonna wait for them?
-No, no, no.

181
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:30,799
l can't believe that my mother lied
about the job just to get me over here.

182
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:34,344
lt's completely unethical to do that
to your own son. lt's horrible.

183
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:37,389
lt's the worst job l've ever had
in my life.

184
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:41,143
Your predecessor....

185
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:44,104
He committed suicide
two weeks ago.

186
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:46,023
No.

187
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:48,859
No. l'm joking.

188
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,362
No, he left after two weeks.

189
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:57,242
Come on, man, just get along with
the job and we'll have some fun.

190
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:02,414
Do you think Martine is pretty?

191
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:04,541
Martine? From work?

192
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,628
No, Martin Scorsese. Yeah.

193
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:11,215
l don't-- l don't think about that.

194
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:12,966
Well, imagine...

195
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:16,220
...if she comes and gives you a blowjob
in the darkroom....

196
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:18,138
You know, l can arrange this for you.

197
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:22,559
So getting laid is all that matters?
lt doesn't matter who the person is?

198
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:26,188
You see, l'm not a creative person,
like you.

199
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:30,442
l don't feel the need to leave a trace
behind me...

200
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:34,404
...except a fart sometimes.

201
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:39,451
Sorry. lt escaped me. Come on.

202
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:42,204
You know, the other day, l saw
an old man on the bench.

203
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:44,289
He was smiling, you know, really happy.

204
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,458
You know what he was thinking of?

205
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:47,835
His grandchildren?

206
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,838
Not at all.
lf you don't know, don't improvise.

207
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:54,049
No, he was thinking about all the dirty
stuff and naughty stuff...

208
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:56,176
...he did with the girls
when he was young.

209
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:59,221
How do you know that?
Did you ask him?

210
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,891
l know that because...

211
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:05,686
...this man was me in the future.
And l was happy.

212
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:08,355
l simply want to be like him
in my old days.

213
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:12,109
You know, l have this neighbor
that has a friend...

214
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:13,944
...that is very pretty, actually.

215
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:16,613
Oh, good reason to stay, my man.

216
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:19,783
Be careful, you know,
with the whole neighbor situation.

217
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:23,120
That's the problem, that l think
it's the neighbor that likes me...

218
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:24,454
...not her friend.

219
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:27,958
-Yeah.
-Danger.

220
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,503
l never get the one l like, anyways.

221
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,505
Maybe she's a good cook.

222
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:42,306
-Stéphane? Did you forget something?
-Hey. Hi.

223
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:46,727
No, no. l was just-- l was just--

224
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:49,646
You know, my hand? Because l can--

225
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:53,150
Are you looking for Zoé?
She's not here.

226
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:56,695
-She doesn't live here, you know?
-Oh, okay.

227
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:59,489
How's your dad--? Your hand.

228
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:02,326
My dad? My dad's still dead.

229
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:03,493
l'm sorry.

230
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,707
You want Zoé's number?

231
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:12,169
No. No, l think l'm fine.

232
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:16,173
-So l guess l'll be on my way now.
-Okay.

233
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,716
Bye.

234
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:25,682
l'll do my laundry later. Maybe l should
check this hand of yours.

235
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:31,230
Okay, well, yeah,
it's better to be safe than sorry.

236
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:39,613
Sorry, it's not funny.

237
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,074
l think it's funny.
l mean, it's not that funny--

238
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:44,535
l mean, it's not funny,
but l find it funny.

239
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:48,872
Come in.

240
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,379
lt's still chaos.

241
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:02,302
l'm going to put my bed up there,
to save some space.

242
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:05,180
How do you call it? A ''mezzanine''?

243
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:07,850
Mezzanine, <i>oui</i>, mezzanine.

244
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:12,896
Do you make those?

245
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:15,941
Some l made and others l adopted.

246
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:17,776
You have to find who.

247
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:22,823
-You made this one.
-Nope.

248
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:24,908
What's his name?

249
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:27,411
His name is...

250
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:30,414
...Golden the Pony Boy.

251
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:35,544
When l found him, he was so sad
that l had to buy him for a lot.

252
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,839
-He's never going to leave me now.
-Really?

253
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,799
l understand that you're the mother...

254
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:43,260
...but you also have to think
of his interest.

255
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:45,762
Yeah, it's possible.
But he is already damaged.

256
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:48,265
l can't take any chances.

257
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:49,892
Let me see your hand.

258
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:56,607
You know, it started to smell like a foot.

259
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,152
lt's a good sign.

260
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:07,701
Can you move it?

261
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:13,248
Yeah. Well, it hurts a little bit,
but it's okay.

262
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:17,461
-l have too big hands.
-Yeah?

263
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:19,463
That means you have a large penis.

264
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:23,342
l'm sorry, that was a bit inappropriate.

265
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:26,512
Look, l'll show you a trick.
lt's a brain effect.

266
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:29,056
You have to-- You have to do this:

267
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:31,517
Okay.

268
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:38,023
lt feels so weird. lt feels like if it
wasn't my hand.

269
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:42,152
l know one that you have to....

270
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,279
You have to put your two fingers
like this:

271
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:46,698
...and then you look into the distance,
like that:

272
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:49,451
-All you can see is a little--
-A little sausage, yeah.

273
00:31:49,618 --> 00:31:51,119
l know it. lt's a good one.

274
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:53,247
Oh, you know it?

275
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,296
l made this boat in fabric.

276
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:06,218
l have to put it
in a small forest as a setup.

277
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:10,347
The boat is looking for its <i>mer,</i>
which is--

278
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:14,059
lt sounds like both ''mother''
and ''sea'' in French.

279
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:16,728
So the forest inside the boat?

280
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:19,690
That's genius.
That's like a vegetable Noah's Arc.

281
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:23,277
No, no, no, the boat is in the forest,
looking for his <i>mer</i>.

282
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:26,405
But l need to make the trees, though.

283
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:29,157
Okay, but you know, the forest
inside the boat...

284
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:31,034
...that's a really good idea.

285
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:33,412
l think that maybe
you wanna do that instead.

286
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:38,083
Yeah, yeah. Okay, l'll do it.
lt sounds like a good idea.

287
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,377
Okay, so l'll go get my dad's
old camera...

288
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:43,714
...and we can make an animated film
of the forest inside the boat...

289
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:46,049
...looking for its mother.

290
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:49,219
And the leaves grow and the wind
catches in them...

291
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:52,139
...then the boat takes off.
You'll make the sea, okay?

292
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:57,561
Okay, yeah. Well, we can do it with
layers of paper, like this:

293
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:01,815
You know, like this and they move
in opposite directions, you know?

294
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:08,530
Yeah. Yeah, but we have to find
something more special then.

295
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,409
Kind of retarded in a way.
Look.

296
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,001
-Cellophane.
-Cellophane.

297
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:23,295
Yeah. Yeah, like a Russian
animated film.

298
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:26,882
My mother, she collects thousands
of bonbon wrapping paper...

299
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:30,177
...and also cardboard tubes.
We've got boxes full of them at home.

300
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:31,720
What for?

301
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:34,806
She used to do this arts and crafts
thing and other projects...

302
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:36,600
...but she never finished them.

303
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:39,311
l actually can't stand it,
she never finishes anything.

304
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:43,232
-And look, for the clouds.
-Oh, yeah.

305
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:46,985
Oh, no, no, no. No, try it again.
Try it again, wrong chord.

306
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,697
No, wrong chord, try it again.

307
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:55,452
l knew it. l knew it!

308
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:58,705
Each structure has its own resonant
frequency.

309
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:01,959
You just have to hit the right chord
at the right time.

310
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:05,087
Okay, l'll go get the camera
and you go do the forest.

311
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:08,298
Whoa, whoa, whoa, by the time
you get back, l'll be sleeping.

312
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:10,676
And l need to finish the boat, anyway.

313
00:34:10,843 --> 00:34:13,971
You bring the camera next time, okay?

314
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:19,184
Okay. Well, you tell me when to bring
the camera, okay?

315
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:22,980
Well, l'm leaving.

316
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,232
l'll start the forest tomorrow.

317
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,692
All right.

318
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:30,404
Bye.

319
00:34:39,538 --> 00:34:42,457
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

320
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:42,809
No, no, Martine.
Martine, no. No, no.

321
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,811
l'm sorry, l can't.

322
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:47,397
lt's-- lt's not you, it's me.
l feel guilty.

323
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:49,399
What is it, Stéphanou?

324
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:52,528
l can't live all my life
hiding in my apartment.

325
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:54,696
-l need to come clean.
-You are clean.

326
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:58,867
Aristurtle? Okay, okay.
Type this:

327
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:00,285
Dear Stéphanie:

328
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:03,455
-''Dear Stéph--'' Who is she?
-l am....

329
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:06,250
Forget about it, l need to write it
in French anyway.

330
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:07,876
Okay.

331
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:38,866
By the way, do you have Zoé's
phone number?

332
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:42,953
Thanks, Stéphane.

333
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:46,123
Where are you going now?

334
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,460
Stéphanou?

335
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:18,155
No, no, no.

336
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:45,182
''Do you have Zoé's phone number?''

337
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:50,395
<i>Dear Stéphanie, comma.</i>

338
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:54,066
<i>I am just your neighbor,</i>
<i>there is nothing more to say than that.</i>

339
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:57,778
<i>This is the reason why I am writing</i>
<i>a letter to you...</i>

340
00:37:57,945 --> 00:38:02,824
<i>...because I feel really bad inside</i>
<i>my stomach.</i>

341
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,576
<i>It's a mix between</i>--

342
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:07,412
l don't know if what l feel is a bit
of nostalgia...

343
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:10,457
...or wanting to go to the bathroom.

344
00:38:10,624 --> 00:38:14,086
l am just a new liar in your life.

345
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:18,715
A new liar that has come
and destroyed your piano...

346
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:22,594
...and maybe by doing that destroy
the huge heritage....

347
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:26,348
<i>I want us to start a new start</i>
<i>and a new</i>--

348
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:30,060
<i>A new blank page of friendship.</i>

349
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:34,106
<i>And if you can embrace that the same</i>
<i>way I am embracing it right now...</i>

350
00:38:34,273 --> 00:38:37,150
...that l am feeling it right now,
l see the possibilities...

351
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:42,322
...once we go above that threshold
of life...

352
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:45,534
...and matters that succumb
and become trickling down...

353
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:48,954
...into this little pond
that is called life.

354
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:51,748
<i>Full stop. The end.</i>

355
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:29,721
<i>Stéphanie?</i>

356
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:34,059
Stéphanie?

357
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:39,731
-Stéphanie.
-<i>Stéphanie.</i>

358
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:04,381
Stéphanie and Zoé lied to me.

359
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:06,925
They are not
creative executives. No! No.

360
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,094
Aristotle, my ass.

361
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:10,721
They think l'm stupid, but no.

362
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:12,890
You guys are gonna
help me find them, okay?

363
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:17,311
-Stéphane needs you.
-Okay.

364
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:19,563
-We've gotta find a way of--
-Go back to work.

365
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:21,398
Oh, no. To work? No, no, no.

366
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:24,234
lt's only a dream.
We don't have to work in dreams.

367
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:27,946
-No! Nothing is for real.
-You write, you write.

368
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:29,865
-You write!
-You're just the result...

369
00:41:30,032 --> 00:41:32,409
...of a chemical flux in my brain,
that's all.

370
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:35,078
Do you mean we don't really exist?

371
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:36,830
Flux?

372
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:40,727
By the way,
do you have Zoé's number?

373
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:04,853
<i>Hello?</i>

374
00:44:05,062 --> 00:44:06,230
<i>Hello?</i>

375
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:07,481
Stéphane Miroux?

376
00:44:08,774 --> 00:44:11,276
-Stéphanie?
-<i>Yes.</i>

377
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:12,819
Hey.

378
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:16,698
<i>Did you finish the boat already?</i>

379
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:20,536
No, no, of course not.

380
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:23,247
l still have some stuff to buy.

381
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:40,597
Optical tricks.

382
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:45,394
Yeah.

383
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:50,190
Yeah, l could show you one.
l got this really cool one. When?

384
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,403
Now?

385
00:44:55,237 --> 00:44:56,613
<i>Okay.</i>

386
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:02,077
<i>It'll take me, like,</i>
<i>35 minutes to get there.</i>

387
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:08,292
Maybe-- l mean,
maybe l can make it in 1 5.

388
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,794
-<i>Yeah, okay.</i>
-Yeah?

389
00:45:11,003 --> 00:45:12,921
-Okay.
-<i>Okay, bye.</i>

390
00:45:58,884 --> 00:46:00,385
-Hi.
-Hi.

391
00:46:00,552 --> 00:46:02,554
-You were quick.
-Yeah.

392
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:05,432
l brought you this.

393
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,019
So basically, with cards, what we do,
l mean, because...

394
00:46:09,186 --> 00:46:12,814
...it's kind of difficult. The cards
are there. The cards do not lie, you know.

395
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:14,691
lt cannot change.

396
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,153
So if you grab the cards
and you open them...

397
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,698
...and you name one card
and l point at it from a distance, okay?

398
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:24,868
But remember to send it to me, you know,
before you name it.

399
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:28,288
Send it to me, name it, send, name,
send, name, send.

400
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:30,832
-Okay.
-Send it.

401
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:39,216
Okay. Yeah, l received it. lt's there.

402
00:46:39,383 --> 00:46:40,843
Yup.

403
00:46:42,094 --> 00:46:44,972
-You saw that? Did you see that?
-lt's amazing.

404
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:46,557
Try another one.

405
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,645
Ace of spades is there.

406
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:54,940
Yeah.

407
00:47:09,246 --> 00:47:10,998
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

408
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:13,208
-What?
-What are you doing dressed like that?

409
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:15,085
lt's punk.

410
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:28,557
He's Guy. l work with him.

411
00:47:28,724 --> 00:47:30,058
-We work together.
-He's what?

412
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:31,476
-Guy.
-Guy.

413
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:33,020
He's punk.

414
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:36,356
So? What?

415
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,451
Does she always dance like that?

416
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:51,413
Yes. Always.

417
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:58,170
Yeah? ls it only when she gets a bit drunk
or is it always like that?

418
00:47:58,337 --> 00:48:01,465
-Do you mind?
-No, l have no problem. l have no problem.

419
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:05,636
l mean, l can't imagine how anyone would
end up doing that with Guy, you know?

420
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:12,142
Hey, l composed this piece of music
for your piano.

421
00:48:12,351 --> 00:48:14,895
You could play it all night.

422
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:16,146
Try it.

423
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:19,483
-lt's called, ''My Dear Neighbors.''
-Thank you.

424
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,486
-lt's sweet.
-l hope you like it.

425
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:27,115
-Hey.
-Hey.

426
00:48:27,282 --> 00:48:29,076
What are you doing? What are you doing?

427
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:30,702
What am l doing? You confuse me.

428
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:33,080
So you like her or you like Zoé?

429
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:35,415
Man, l'm just talking to her.
She's my neighbor.

430
00:48:35,582 --> 00:48:39,044
We're just friends. Don't you believe
in friendship with the opposite sex?

431
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:43,006
No. She likes you, it's obvious.
Don't play with her.

432
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:46,301
l mean, she's great, you know.
She's a really nice person...

433
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:48,554
...but she reminds me of my father.

434
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,722
-What?
-Yeah, yeah.

435
00:48:56,061 --> 00:48:57,479
Hey, we're going now.

436
00:48:57,646 --> 00:48:59,147
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

437
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:01,358
Bye-bye.

438
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:06,822
Hey, don't forget
the forest and the boat, eh?

439
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:09,449
Okay, l won't.

440
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:11,034
-Okay.
-Be a good boy.

441
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:13,078
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, good, okay.

442

Stéphanie.

445
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:53,285
Stéph--

446
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:54,953
You're fired. Guy, you're fired.

447
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,414
You're fired. Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?

448
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,000
You're dogs. You're like the--

449
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:04,171
The dogs that bite the hand
of the owner that gives you food.

450
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:06,048
Serge, you betrayed me.

451
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:08,175
Guy, are you betraying me?

452
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:33,200
<i>Television Educative</i> is back for you
this evening for a new chapter.

453
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:35,285
Love after 50.

454
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:38,163
We have two very special guests
on the show today.

455
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,499
Gérard and Mom.

456
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:43,293
Gérard, you are a professional magician.

457
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:46,213
<i>You look old and you live</i>
<i>in a small suburban house.</i>

458
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,090
<i>Why do you think Mom chose you?</i>

459
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:50,968
<i>Oh, yes, you're funny. Yes.</i>

460
00:51:04,523 --> 00:51:06,817
l wouldn't like to be
the woman you cut in half.

461
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:11,154
But hold on.

462
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:15,492
Okay, then.

463
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:54,698
<i>Gérard, you're just a bullshit guru.</i>

464
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:57,868
<i>Mom, why do you</i>
<i>always fall for gurus?</i>

465
00:51:58,035 --> 00:52:00,579
<i>You think you will learn</i>
<i>some deep truth about yourself?</i>

466
00:52:01,413 --> 00:52:02,873
<i>My dad was not a guru.</i>

467
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:06,710
Are you in love, Stéphane?

468
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:15,177
<i>Stéphane? Stéphane?</i>

469
00:52:16,053 --> 00:52:19,348
No, no. No.

470
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:25,062
Do you know what REM means?

471
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:27,564
Rapid Eye Monitronics.

472
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,163
The eyes.

473
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:45,916
l can control my eyes in my sleep.

474
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:48,502
<i>No more sleeping slavery.</i>

475
00:52:57,302 --> 00:52:59,930
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we are approaching the moon</i>-- <i>What?</i>

476
00:53:00,097 --> 00:53:01,849
<i>The moon, yeah.</i>

477
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:06,645
Scary, huh?

478
00:53:06,812 --> 00:53:08,438
lt's very scary, huh?

479
00:53:09,815 --> 00:53:11,859
<i>No gravitation pull.</i>

480
00:53:21,493 --> 00:53:24,371
<i>Earthquake and fire!</i>

481
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:34,548
Okay, that's enough. That's enough.

482
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,802
Please, give us our--
l mean, your world back.

483
00:53:39,011 --> 00:53:41,471
Tell us what to do.
We'll do anything.

484
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:43,891
Just don't make me work
like a slave all the time.

485
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:45,184
-Okay.
-Okay?

486
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:48,103
-Master.
-Okay.

487
00:53:48,812 --> 00:53:51,607
-Peace.
-Okay. Okay.

488
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:11,960
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

489
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,525
-Praise to you and to the new world.
-No, no, stop that.

490
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:36,735
Hey, no, no. Guys, no.
Stop that shit, okay?

491
00:54:36,902 --> 00:54:38,153
lt's getting a bit creepy.

492
00:54:38,403 --> 00:54:40,197
Are we still making calendars?

493
00:54:40,405 --> 00:54:41,615
We are here to serve you.

494
00:54:41,782 --> 00:54:44,034
Basically, l wanna
see Stéphanie in my dreams.

495
00:54:44,201 --> 00:54:48,163
l know. l will make your novel,
<i>I am Just Your Neighbor,</i> into a bestseller.

496
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:52,209
-That will attract her.
-Then we'll organize a massive wedding.

497
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:54,419
Madame Stéphanie Stéphane.

498
00:54:58,924 --> 00:55:02,928
Stéphane Miroux, your novel
<i>I'm Just Your Neighbor and a Liar.</i>

499
00:55:03,095 --> 00:55:06,098
<i>By the Way, Do You Have Zoé's Number?</i>
is a blockbuster.

500
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:08,600
-Yeah.
-Where does your genius end?

501
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:12,813
Painting, sculpturing,
architecturing, writering?

502
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:16,567
Today, building has began on the
Stéphane Miroux Foundation.

503
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:18,569
A museum dedicated to your work.

504
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:21,613
So, Stéphane Miroux,
did you find the key to success?

505
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:23,824
Well....

506
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:29,079
Well, l think people empathize
with what l do...

507
00:55:29,246 --> 00:55:31,290
...because it comes from here.

508
00:55:31,456 --> 00:55:33,458
Oh, you are talking about Stéphanie?

509
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:36,211
Oh, l don't like to talk
about my private life.

510
00:55:36,378 --> 00:55:39,798
So, Stéphane Miroux,
we have a little surprise for you to do.

511
00:55:39,965 --> 00:55:40,966
No.

512
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:43,343
-A song for her.
-A song?

513
00:55:57,065 --> 00:56:00,694
<i>If you rescue me</i>

514
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:05,782
<i>I'll be your friend forever</i>

515
00:56:06,491 --> 00:56:10,412
<i>Let me in your bed</i>

516
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:15,459
<i>I'll keep you warm in winter</i>

517
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:20,422
<i>All the kitties are playing</i>
<i>And they're having such fun</i>

518
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:24,718
<i>I wish it could happen to me</i>

519
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:29,056
<i>But if you rescue me</i>

520
00:56:34,853 --> 00:56:36,688
<i>All the cars drive so fast</i>

521
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:40,984
Stéphane Miroux. Stéphane Miroux.

522
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:43,612
Stéphane Miroux.

523
00:56:44,154 --> 00:56:45,489
<i>Let me into your world</i>

524
00:56:45,697 --> 00:56:46,823
Go now.

525
00:56:47,032 --> 00:56:48,325
<i>I'll keep you warm and amused</i>

526
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:52,663
<i>All the things we can do in the rain</i>

527
00:56:53,455 --> 00:56:56,458
lt's not working because you messed up
the title of my book.

528
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,794
You better be here
when l come back.

529
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:02,548
Okay, l'm exhausted.
l'm gonna wake up now.

530
00:57:02,714 --> 00:57:04,174
Hey.

531
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:05,926
Stéphanie.

532
00:57:06,093 --> 00:57:09,346
What a coincidence. l almost thought
that l was gonna miss you.

533
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:10,722
Would you like to marry me?

534
00:57:12,307 --> 00:57:14,810
Come. Come with me.
l want to show you my friends.

535
00:57:15,018 --> 00:57:18,689
Hey, guys? Guys,
let me present you to my future wife.

536
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:28,699
One, l don't believe in marriage,
two, you don't want to be with me.

537
00:57:28,866 --> 00:57:31,743
And three, are you out of your mind?

538
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:35,163
No, l'm sorry. l'm sorry,
l thought that l was--

539
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:36,957
You thought what?

540
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:39,459
l thought that l was here.

541
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:42,546
And that l was working here,
sleeping in my office.

542
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,842
And then l came here, and then
this part l don't remember very well.

543
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:51,263
There were more people there.
And then l saw you....

544
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:53,724
Where exactly are you living?

545
00:57:56,393 --> 00:57:59,897
l live-- l'm staying
with my mother right now.

546
00:58:00,439 --> 00:58:03,025
So you're my landlord's son?

547
00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:05,444
Yeah.

548
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:08,280
Are you sure you're okay, Stéphane?

549
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:09,448
Yeah, why?

550
00:58:10,574 --> 00:58:13,410
So you were not asking me for real then?

551
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:16,038
No. To marry you, no.

552
00:58:16,788 --> 00:58:18,248
But...

553
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:22,127
...l think l like you.

554
00:58:23,003 --> 00:58:25,422
You mean in a romantic way?

555
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:29,426
Yeah, if you want to call it like that.

556
00:58:32,137 --> 00:58:34,765
Come on, Stéphane.
l don't want to have a boyfriend.

557
00:58:39,645 --> 00:58:40,729
Okay.

558
00:58:40,896 --> 00:58:43,815
So now you'll act all weird around me
because l didn't want to--

559
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:46,401
No. lt's not my fault, you know,
if l have feelings.

560
00:58:46,568 --> 00:58:48,195
You don't have to humiliate me.

561
00:58:48,362 --> 00:58:51,907
Oh, come on, Stéphane.
Stop acting like a child.

562
00:58:55,327 --> 00:58:56,870
Stéphane?

563
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:25,107
Working is the best remedy then.

564
00:59:25,274 --> 00:59:26,817
Keeps your brain busy.

565
00:59:27,025 --> 00:59:30,821
How can you work? Love is too powerful.
You can't concentrate.

566
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:36,326
Listen. Tell her right away.

567
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:39,413
lf it's from your heart,
she will understand.

568
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:48,005
She's with somebody, Stéphane?

569
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,848
What? l don't understand you, Guy.

570
00:59:58,056 --> 00:59:59,850
l'm sorry, l don't understand.

571
01:00:00,058 --> 01:00:01,852
l don't understand you either.

572
01:00:02,019 --> 01:00:05,189
l can't understand you when you
talk to me in two different languages.

573
01:00:05,397 --> 01:00:10,444
lt makes me feel schizometric.
Schizo-- Schizo--

574
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:18,911
Schizophrenic.
That's the word you're looking for.

575
01:00:19,077 --> 01:00:21,747
-Yeah.
-Hey, don't pay attention to those losers.

576
01:00:21,914 --> 01:00:24,917
Try to be more on time
in the morning. They'll leave you alone.

577
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:27,419
No, no, no.

578
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:30,172
NPC's for film.

579
01:00:30,339 --> 01:00:33,050
CPN goes with CPP.

580
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:45,145
CPP.

581
01:00:45,312 --> 01:00:49,525
CPP, NPC, CP-- l get confused.

582
01:00:50,317 --> 01:00:52,402
You know the....

583
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:54,655
The goat on the cliff?

584
01:00:54,821 --> 01:00:56,949
-The goat on the cliff?
-Goat on the cliff. No?

585
01:00:57,115 --> 01:01:00,244
-lt's a sex position.
-l know it's hard for you to understand...

586
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:02,663
...but not every man is
a sex maniac, you know.

587
01:01:02,829 --> 01:01:04,081
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

588
01:01:04,248 --> 01:01:06,583
Like every woman is romantic?

589
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:08,335
l don't know, but....

590
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:25,644
<i>I am collecting beautiful objects.</i>

591
01:01:27,437 --> 01:01:29,439
<i>A pair of shoes.</i>

592
01:01:32,234 --> 01:01:34,236
<i>Some glasses.</i>

593
01:01:36,488 --> 01:01:38,574
<i>Telephone.</i>

594
01:01:39,616 --> 01:01:41,618
<i>Typewriter.</i>

595
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:43,537
<i>They are made from wood and felt.</i>

596
01:01:43,704 --> 01:01:45,789
<i>With apparent stitches.</i>

597
01:01:45,956 --> 01:01:49,251
<i>Their delicate and finished</i>
<i>appearance is friendly.</i>

598
01:01:49,418 --> 01:01:51,461
<i>And they are quiet.</i>

599
01:01:51,962 --> 01:01:54,756
<i>Stéphanie made them, and I will</i>
<i>expose them in an exhibition.</i>

600
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:57,968
Stéphanie, do you think l could
take the red blanket as well?

601
01:01:58,135 --> 01:01:59,928
Of course, Stéphane. Are you kidding?

602
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:02,181
<i>There's this amazing blanket.</i>

603
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:06,310
<i>It's thick, red felt</i>
<i>with big white stitches.</i>

604
01:02:06,476 --> 01:02:08,437
<i>Wild animals are running on it.</i>

605
01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:21,241
<i>She smiles.</i>

606
01:02:21,992 --> 01:02:25,412
<i>I bend over a rock to try to reach her.</i>

607
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:29,666
<i>My stomach, compressed, hurts.</i>

608
01:02:34,463 --> 01:02:36,381
Stéphanie?

609
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:40,844
Can you hold my hand?

610
01:02:42,179 --> 01:02:43,972
l cannot sleep.

611
01:02:48,101 --> 01:02:51,063
<i>She takes it. I fall asleep.</i>

612
01:03:12,209 --> 01:03:13,961
The sea.

613
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:21,969
And the forest.

614
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:34,022
You should put more whites in.

615
01:03:34,398 --> 01:03:35,649
You should put more whites.

616
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:37,359
Yeah?

617
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:48,662
No, a bit--
A bit more to the left, here.

618
01:03:48,829 --> 01:03:53,333
-Oh, yeah.
-Randomness is very difficult to achieve.

619
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:57,212
Organization always merges back
if you don't pay attention.

620
01:03:57,379 --> 01:03:59,756
Death to organization.

621
01:04:02,134 --> 01:04:04,136
Hey, what's this?

622
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:06,471
-lt's the....
-ls it your mom's?

623
01:04:06,638 --> 01:04:10,601
No. That's the one-second time travel
machine l told you about.

624
01:04:10,767 --> 01:04:12,936
l finished it. For you.

625
01:04:14,688 --> 01:04:16,273
You wanna try it?

626
01:04:17,274 --> 01:04:19,443
What are you going to do
with one second?

627
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:21,445
Well, it just adds up.

628
01:04:21,612 --> 01:04:23,447
And life is too precious.

629
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:27,409
So, basically, you put this here.

630
01:04:27,576 --> 01:04:30,204
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah.

631
01:04:31,622 --> 01:04:32,956
Oh, can you-- Okay.

632
01:04:33,123 --> 01:04:34,708
So....

633
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:36,460
Just one second.

634
01:04:37,711 --> 01:04:41,423
This is for the past.
And this is for the future, okay?

635
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:43,091
So let's try some for the past.

636
01:04:43,258 --> 01:04:45,594
You have to press
this button, okay?

637
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,390
Let's try some for the past.

638
01:04:50,557 --> 01:04:52,017
Let's try some for the past.

639
01:04:52,184 --> 01:04:53,769
Hey, it's working.

640
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:56,355
Amazing scientific breakthrough.

641
01:04:56,522 --> 01:04:58,982
...scientific breakthrough.

642
01:04:59,149 --> 01:05:02,694
Yeah. No, wait, wait.
Let's save some for the future.

643
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:07,991
Wait, wait, wait.

644
01:05:10,285 --> 01:05:11,787
Hey, what are you--?

645
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:13,247
Let me just....

646
01:05:13,413 --> 01:05:15,916
Why did you do it twice?

647
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,544
The first time was the future...

648
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:21,004
...and the second one
was just the present.

649
01:05:21,171 --> 01:05:24,216
Well, maybe we have different
perspectives on the future.

650
01:05:24,383 --> 01:05:28,178
No, no, no. This is just a machine.
lt's objective. lt's just a machine.

651
01:05:28,345 --> 01:05:30,013
Yeah, okay.

652
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:33,058
l'm not sure l should accept this gift.

653
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:35,936
Why do l deserve a present, anyway?

654
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:40,023
Because for the occasion
that you are pretty.

655
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:41,692
Oh, shut up.

656
01:05:41,859 --> 01:05:43,443
You're sweet.

657
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:47,072
So you think l'm only pretty.

658
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:49,533
Like, l'm pretty and stupid.

659
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:54,204
-Well, no, maybe you shouldn't have this.
-No, no, no. This is my present.

660
01:05:54,955 --> 01:05:56,415
Okay, let's go back to work.

661
01:05:56,748 --> 01:05:58,792
The ocean's drying.

662
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:02,504
-What--?
-l'm just seeing....

663
01:06:02,671 --> 01:06:04,173
You have one thing.

664
01:06:04,339 --> 01:06:08,135
-Do you have something to say?
-No, no.

665
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:11,054
Focus and concentration.

666
01:06:11,221 --> 01:06:14,308
Distraction is an obstruction
to the construction.

667
01:06:14,474 --> 01:06:16,894
Distraction is an obstruction
for the construction.

668
01:06:18,353 --> 01:06:20,981
Distraction is an obstruction
for the construction.

669
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:46,548
-Oh, look.
-What?

670
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:48,133
Skiers.

671
01:06:52,054 --> 01:06:53,931
Oh, look, look!

672
01:06:56,308 --> 01:06:57,309
A lake what?

673
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:04,233
-Weird. That's really weird.
-Stéphane, talk with your heart.

674
01:07:04,399 --> 01:07:08,445
-Yeah, be gentle.
-Fuck her.

675
01:07:08,612 --> 01:07:10,822
No, no. Don't rush.

676
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:14,451
-The goat on the cliff, remember?
-What?

677
01:07:15,536 --> 01:07:17,162
What's the goat on the cliff?

678
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:19,248
lt's a little children's story.

679
01:07:19,414 --> 01:07:22,000
lt's, it's silly, don't listen to that.

680
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:23,752
Don't listen. Don't listen.

681
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:34,513
-On the cliff.
-The goat on the cliff!

682
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,765
Martine, the goat on the cliff.

683
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:38,433
Serge.

684
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:08,547
-l'll go first.
-No.

685
01:08:08,714 --> 01:08:10,591
-l don't know how to ski.
-Come on.

686
01:08:10,757 --> 01:08:13,385
-l don't wanna go.
-lt's easy. Courage, pretty boy.

687
01:09:46,937 --> 01:09:48,730
Wait, wait, wait.
lt's not gonna hurt.

688
01:09:48,897 --> 01:09:50,607
lt's not gonna hurt.

689
01:09:58,907 --> 01:10:00,284
Okay.

690
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:03,745
Okay, good.

691
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:09,585
-Good.
-Hey, you take the glue gun, and l'll try this.

692
01:10:09,751 --> 01:10:10,961
No, no, no.

693
01:10:11,128 --> 01:10:13,046
Why don't we,
why don't we do the scene...

694
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:15,591
...when you walk
into the apartment...

695
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:17,759
...and you discover the pony, yeah?

696
01:10:17,926 --> 01:10:19,136
-Yeah. Okay.
-Yeah?

697
01:10:19,303 --> 01:10:21,847
Okay. So come, come, come.

698
01:10:22,014 --> 01:10:25,100
You must be.... Okay. Yeah, there.

699
01:10:25,809 --> 01:10:28,312
-Oh, wait.
-All right, okay, you're there.

700
01:10:28,478 --> 01:10:31,481
So basically you're just
walking into the apartment...

701
01:10:31,648 --> 01:10:33,984
...and you discover
that the pony can run...

702
01:10:34,151 --> 01:10:37,321
...and you feel very excited, and....

703
01:10:37,487 --> 01:10:40,490
Ready? And action.

704
01:10:40,657 --> 01:10:43,035
Damn it, Stéphane,
you've ruined my pony.

705
01:10:43,202 --> 01:10:46,914
-Why did you do that?
-Cut. What are you doing?

706
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,916
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

707
01:10:49,082 --> 01:10:51,001
No, you should be ecstatic about me.

708
01:10:51,168 --> 01:10:54,796
You should be, like,
praising my ingénue and genius.

709
01:10:54,963 --> 01:10:57,341
Of course, my handsome.

710
01:10:57,633 --> 01:11:00,427
No, don't play with me.
This is never gonna happen.

711
01:11:00,594 --> 01:11:02,554
-How do you know?
-Because l know.

712
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:04,640
Why are you trying
to give me hope?

713
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:07,684
Hope? Maybe you should try.

714
01:11:07,851 --> 01:11:09,228
Try.

715
01:11:09,394 --> 01:11:12,105
Well, next time l'll see you,
l'll kiss you?

716
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:14,358
-ls that what you're asking me?
-Yeah.

717
01:11:14,525 --> 01:11:16,276
-Really?
-Yeah, you should try.

718
01:11:16,443 --> 01:11:18,654
l should just
go out there and kiss you.

719
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:20,155
Yeah.

720
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:23,075
Okay.

721
01:11:23,367 --> 01:11:24,701
-Yeah.
-Go on.

722
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:39,967
What are you doing?

723
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:42,553
l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

724
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,264
Can you pretend that l,
that you didn't see me?

725
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:47,891
-l was just leaving, right now.
-This is stupid.

726
01:11:48,058 --> 01:11:50,018
-You broke into my place?
-l'm sorry.

727
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:52,354
-What are you looking for?
-l'm sorry.

728
01:11:52,521 --> 01:11:54,898
That's creepy. No, this way.

729
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:58,944
-Good night.
-Oh, l forgot my keys.

730
01:12:16,628 --> 01:12:19,256
-Hello?
-<i>Stéphane?</i>

731
01:12:19,756 --> 01:12:21,758
<i>Are you okay?</i>

732
01:12:22,342 --> 01:12:24,344
<i>I love my pony.</i>

733
01:12:24,511 --> 01:12:26,346
<i>I can't believe you did that.</i>

734
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:29,016
How did you do it?

735
01:12:32,019 --> 01:12:34,563
l'm sorry about what l said.

736
01:12:34,771 --> 01:12:36,064
l didn't mean one word.

737
01:12:36,231 --> 01:12:37,983
-No....
-<i>Okay?</i>

738
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:39,484
No, l'm a creep.

739
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:41,236
Just like you said.

740
01:12:41,445 --> 01:12:45,282
Listen, Stéphane.
You have to toughen up a little.

741
01:12:45,866 --> 01:12:49,369
lt's not attractive for a girl
to see a guy crying.

742
01:12:49,536 --> 01:12:51,246
<i>I know, it sucks.</i>

743
01:12:52,456 --> 01:12:55,959
<i>You know I named</i>
<i>Golden the Pony Boy after you.</i>

744
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:58,754
No, come on. Come on.

745
01:12:58,962 --> 01:13:02,090
lt's not true. You had him
before we met.

746
01:13:02,257 --> 01:13:03,759
<i>No, no, it is true.</i>

747
01:13:03,926 --> 01:13:07,846
l improvised his name when
you saw him for the first time.

748
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:10,182
He didn't have a name.

749
01:13:10,349 --> 01:13:12,434
<i>Now, tell me how you did it.</i>

750
01:13:12,643 --> 01:13:14,186
<i>Golden is galloping for real.</i>

751
01:13:14,353 --> 01:13:17,397
<i>It's unreal.</i>

752
01:13:18,524 --> 01:13:19,816
Well....

753
01:13:20,484 --> 01:13:25,197
lt's just an application
of the chaos theory.

754
01:13:26,031 --> 01:13:27,366
Random control.

755
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:28,825
Each leg has one engine...

756
01:13:28,992 --> 01:13:31,411
...and it moves backwards
or forwards depending on...

757
01:13:31,578 --> 01:13:35,666
...the movement on the other leg.
lt's like life.

758
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:39,002
But in a simplified version.

759
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,256
And it doesn't reproduce.

760
01:13:44,883 --> 01:13:47,928
l'm glad we live
next door to each other.

761
01:13:50,305 --> 01:13:51,974
Will you....

762
01:13:52,641 --> 01:13:56,103
Would you marry me when we're 70?

763
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:59,064
<i>You've got nothing to lose.</i>

764
01:14:03,235 --> 01:14:04,820
Okay.

765
01:14:05,028 --> 01:14:06,989
Would you mind...

766
01:14:07,865 --> 01:14:10,909
...keep on talking to me
for a little while?

767
01:14:11,618 --> 01:14:15,330
Because l always thought
it was possible to talk from my sleep.

768
01:14:15,497 --> 01:14:18,500
l feel that l'm falling down
into a black hole.

769
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:22,838
<i>You know that you could never see</i>
<i>someone fall in a black hole.</i>

770
01:14:23,046 --> 01:14:26,216
<i>Because the image of the traveler</i>
<i>who passes the horizon...</i>

771
01:14:26,383 --> 01:14:31,013
<i>...would slow down till it would remain</i>
<i>stuck in the same position...</i>

772
01:14:31,221 --> 01:14:33,599
<i>The state he was</i>
<i>when he crossed the line.</i>

773
01:14:33,765 --> 01:14:36,143
<i>Only it's getting redder.</i>

774
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:40,355
<i>The traveler gets crushed into spaghetti.</i>

775
01:14:40,772 --> 01:14:43,984
<i>I don't wanna be a spaghetti,</i>
<i>I don't wanna be spaghetti.</i>

776
01:14:44,151 --> 01:14:45,694
<i>No, you won't be a spaghetti.</i>

777
01:14:45,903 --> 01:14:47,237
<i>I don't wanna be a spaghetti.</i>

778
01:14:47,404 --> 01:14:49,698
Stéphane?

779
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:54,244
-Are you here?
-<i>No, I'm there! I'm there.</i>

780
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:57,456
<i>It worked! I'm not a spaghetti!</i>

781
01:14:57,623 --> 01:15:00,751
Tell me, tell me. Describe all you can see.

782
01:15:00,918 --> 01:15:02,836
<i>I feel some grass under my feet.</i>

783
01:15:03,003 --> 01:15:04,838
<i>And it's a bit windy.</i>

784
01:15:05,005 --> 01:15:08,342
And cold. And damp.

785
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:11,386
And there's forest all around me.

786
01:15:12,262 --> 01:15:15,891
And l can see Golden the Pony Boy.
Galloping here. Here, right in front of me.

787
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:19,853
<i>And I can hear some water.</i>
<i>But I cannot see it.</i>

788
01:15:21,355 --> 01:15:23,398
Oh, here it is. The river.

789
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:27,194
ls the water made of millions
of tiny pieces of cellophane?

790
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:29,446
<i>No, it's real water.</i>

791
01:15:29,613 --> 01:15:32,282
Oh, look. l just found the time machine.

792
01:15:32,449 --> 01:15:34,493
The time machine is here.

793
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:42,751
And it works.

794
01:15:48,131 --> 01:15:51,385
<i>Stéphane, are you asleep?</i>

795
01:15:53,011 --> 01:15:54,888
Stéphanie, you know my mom, Christine.

796
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:56,348
<i>two months later</i>

797
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:02,604
Yeah, l cannot talk French
because whenever l speak...

798
01:16:02,813 --> 01:16:06,275
...l feel that my moustache grows
more than when l speak Spanish.

799
01:16:06,483 --> 01:16:08,318
Stéphanie.

800
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:17,221
l....

801
01:17:19,348 --> 01:17:22,309
l wanna dedicate this
to all the victims....

802
01:17:22,476 --> 01:17:24,520
Okay, thank you, Mr. Miroux.

803
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:29,816
Without them, without them,
it would not have been possible.

804
01:18:16,446 --> 01:18:18,782
l'm sorry. Are you upset?

805
01:18:50,647 --> 01:18:54,109
<i>This girl is at once all the women</i>
<i>that broke my heart.</i>

806
01:18:54,276 --> 01:18:58,447
<i>She's so beautiful and generous</i>
<i>and she's asking me to leave.</i>

807
01:18:58,614 --> 01:19:00,616
<i>Because she's dumping me.</i>

808
01:19:00,824 --> 01:19:04,411
<i>She's dumping me because</i>
<i>I am a cheap drug dealer.</i>

809
01:19:04,578 --> 01:19:07,581
<i>And I am a drug dealer</i>
<i>because she wants to leave me.</i>

810
01:19:08,707 --> 01:19:10,959
<i>The police are going to get me now.</i>

811
01:19:11,126 --> 01:19:12,961
<i>This is all my fault.</i>

812
01:20:12,688 --> 01:20:14,898
<i>He is my opposite.</i>

813
01:20:15,232 --> 01:20:17,442
<i>She feels safe around him.</i>

814
01:20:18,777 --> 01:20:20,863
<i>She's in love with him.</i>

815
01:20:48,682 --> 01:20:51,894
Things will turn out the way you want.

816
01:20:52,936 --> 01:20:56,106
lf you could just stop doubting
that l love you.

817
01:20:56,982 --> 01:21:00,068
Call me home. Next door.

818
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:24,778
lt's not fair.

819
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:28,073
She changed exactly the second
l started to like her.

820
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,118
lt's like a big bang.
The first instant, it's very small...

821
01:22:31,285 --> 01:22:34,037
...and then the next nano instant:

822
01:22:34,204 --> 01:22:37,124
Huge. lnfinite.

823
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:41,503
l wish l could travel back to the time
when l didn't find her attractive.

824
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:44,506
You should have asked me.
She has a really good ass.

825
01:22:44,673 --> 01:22:48,510
Shut up, Guy. l thought she was lonely,
and somehow l could help her.

826
01:22:48,677 --> 01:22:51,680
But no. She doesn't need me at all.

827
01:22:51,847 --> 01:22:53,724
You know, l don't know
Stéphanie and all.

828
01:22:53,891 --> 01:22:56,476
But maybe she has a pattern.

829
01:22:56,643 --> 01:23:00,022
She doesn't wanna get hurt,
and by that she's hurting people.

830
01:23:00,189 --> 01:23:03,942
And by hurting people, she thinks
she's not gonna get hurt, but she gets hurt.

831
01:23:04,109 --> 01:23:08,363
l don't know. l love her
because she makes things.

832
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:11,617
You know? She makes things
with her hands.

833
01:23:11,783 --> 01:23:16,246
lt's as if her synapses
was married directly to her fingers.

834
01:23:16,997 --> 01:23:19,791
Like this. ln this way.

835
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:21,919
Yeah, yeah.

836
01:23:23,587 --> 01:23:26,507
Man, l wish l could talk to my dad.

837
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:32,054
l miss my father. l cannot talk
with my mom when l'm sad.

838
01:23:56,411 --> 01:24:00,165
You know, you can't let things
bother you all your life.

839
01:24:00,332 --> 01:24:02,125
A man has to take matters
in his hands.

840
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:05,712
This TV is brainwashing my weekends.

841
01:24:05,879 --> 01:24:09,299
l should be....
lnstead, l'm just watching this.

842
01:24:18,517 --> 01:24:21,228
l'm sorry, l wasn't sure l was awake.

843
01:24:21,395 --> 01:24:25,649
Awake? l will awake you for sure
if you carry on like this.

844
01:24:25,816 --> 01:24:29,570
Here, help me,
instead of being stupid aleck.

845
01:24:51,258 --> 01:24:52,259
lt floats, yeah.

846
01:25:09,109 --> 01:25:10,777
Stéphane?

847
01:25:13,155 --> 01:25:15,324
Stéphane. Wait.

848
01:25:16,033 --> 01:25:17,284
Do you feel better?

849
01:25:18,035 --> 01:25:19,620
l'm going to work.

850
01:25:20,579 --> 01:25:22,372
l just want to know if you're okay.

851
01:25:22,539 --> 01:25:25,000
Yeah, l'm super-fine. Thanks.

852
01:25:25,709 --> 01:25:28,587
So l get it. So you don't want
to be my friend anymore.

853
01:25:28,754 --> 01:25:32,549
No, l don't wanna be your friend anymore.
l don't wanna be your friend anymore.

854
01:25:32,716 --> 01:25:36,094
Do l have to nail it on your door?
l don't wanna be your friend.

855
01:25:36,553 --> 01:25:40,390
No, you-- You can't.
You can't stop being my friend.

856
01:25:40,557 --> 01:25:43,185
-lt's not something people can decide.
-Yeah, they can.

857
01:25:43,352 --> 01:25:46,313
People have an argument and then
they stop talking to each other.

858
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:49,942
Okay, then let's have a date or something
and we can talk about things.

859
01:25:50,108 --> 01:25:52,110
-lf that's what you want.
-What's the point?

860
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:56,532
You'll want me as a friend. You'll have
a nice boyfriend and that'll kill me.

861
01:25:56,698 --> 01:25:58,700
By the way, where's the boat?

862
01:25:58,867 --> 01:26:02,037
Where's everything? Let's face it.
You never finished anything.

863
01:26:02,204 --> 01:26:04,081
Like the mezzanine and everything else?

864
01:26:04,248 --> 01:26:07,751
That's not true.
That's absolutely not true.

865
01:26:07,918 --> 01:26:09,211
l'll show you.

866
01:26:09,378 --> 01:26:13,674
You're manipulating me or....
l don't, l don't understand.

867
01:26:14,925 --> 01:26:16,885
Look, here it is.

868
01:26:18,178 --> 01:26:20,889
Here, here it is. Zoé's number.

869
01:26:21,098 --> 01:26:23,016
That's what you want.

870
01:26:24,268 --> 01:26:28,063
Screw her.
''l'm only your neighbor and a liar.

871
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:32,150
''By the way, do you have Zoé's number?''
Do you remember the letter that night?

872
01:26:32,317 --> 01:26:34,278
How did you get that?

873
01:26:34,444 --> 01:26:37,614
Wait, wait. Wait, l'm sorry.

874
01:26:42,911 --> 01:26:45,122
No, no, no. Stop crying.

875
01:26:45,289 --> 01:26:46,874
Stop crying.

876
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:54,089
l'm sorry.

877
01:26:56,633 --> 01:26:58,260
l'm sorry.

878
01:27:00,387 --> 01:27:02,306
-Guy, Guy.
-Hey.

879
01:27:02,681 --> 01:27:04,683
Did you see the red on?
l'm doing your work.

880
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:06,351
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

881
01:27:06,518 --> 01:27:08,854
Something amazing happened
between Stéphanie and l.

882
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:10,647
-Come on, shut up, now.
-lncredible!

883
01:27:10,814 --> 01:27:13,483
Stop bullshitting. l'm sick
of breaking my balls with you.

884
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:15,694
-l'm doing your work. Know why?
-Why?

885
01:27:15,861 --> 01:27:18,197
Because you're virtually fired,
my sleepy man.

886
01:27:18,363 --> 01:27:20,324
And mother or not mother
to cover your ass.

887
01:27:27,748 --> 01:27:29,875
Okay, you don't know
what happens between us.

888
01:27:30,042 --> 01:27:31,585
Nobody has a clue what happens...

889
01:27:31,752 --> 01:27:33,712
...and everybody has an opinion.
Fuck that.

890
01:27:33,879 --> 01:27:38,675
l wrote her a letter in my dream
and l never gave it to her.

891
01:27:38,842 --> 01:27:42,346
And she read it. l don't know how,
but she somehow read it.

892
01:27:42,513 --> 01:27:44,765
And she just recited it to me just now.

893
01:27:44,932 --> 01:27:46,266
Word by word. She knows it.

894
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:48,936
And you know why?
Because l think our brains...

895
01:27:49,102 --> 01:27:51,522
...are creating this loop
that is incredibly complex.

896
01:27:51,688 --> 01:27:55,317
lt's not as if our brains are communicating
or telepathy or nothing like that.

897
01:27:55,484 --> 01:27:58,487
lt's as if we were evolving
each step into the same direction.

898
01:27:58,654 --> 01:28:01,031
lt's called PSR.
Parallel synchronized randomness.

899
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:04,243
lt's incredibly rare. lt's as if
we were jigsaw puzzles, you know?

900
01:28:04,409 --> 01:28:09,331
-And we're falling to, into the....
-Stéphane, you will never date her, okay?

901
01:28:09,498 --> 01:28:13,794
-She will drive you crazy, believe me.
-No, she just asked me for a date.

902
01:28:13,961 --> 01:28:16,380
ln 20 minutes at the Bar de l'Oreille.
l have to go.

903
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:19,091
Minutes at the Bar de l'Oreille.
l have to go.

904
01:28:20,592 --> 01:28:22,427
lt's my travel, time travel machine.

905
01:28:24,054 --> 01:28:26,974
You just walk in, Pouchet didn't
see you, so you won't go.

906
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:30,769
Oh, come on. Guy, Guy, come on!
lt's just once. Okay, just this time.

907
01:29:17,774 --> 01:29:19,735
<i>You will never date her, okay?</i>

908
01:29:19,902 --> 01:29:22,613
-<i>She will drive you crazy.</i>
-<i>Drive me crazy.</i>

909
01:29:22,779 --> 01:29:26,116
<i>I refuse to believe only friendship</i>
<i>from Stéphanie.</i>

910
01:29:26,283 --> 01:29:28,160
<i>There are signs that can't be mistaken.</i>

911
01:29:28,327 --> 01:29:31,705
<i>Can't be mistaken. Look, look.</i>

912
01:29:32,039 --> 01:29:35,584
She kisses me at less than
a centimeter of my lips.

913
01:29:36,168 --> 01:29:40,172
<i>It is a sign, the most evident,</i>
<i>that she desires me.</i>

914
01:29:40,339 --> 01:29:43,300
Where should she kiss to her friendly
goodbye? On the forehead?

915
01:29:43,467 --> 01:29:48,388
<i>No, halfway between the ear and the lips.</i>
<i>That's what's considered normal.</i>

916
01:29:48,555 --> 01:29:51,892
<i>Besides, if I don't move my head back,</i>
<i>she hits me right on the lips.</i>

917
01:29:52,059 --> 01:29:54,061
<i>Why did you move away</i>
<i>from her kiss, then?</i>

918
01:29:54,228 --> 01:29:56,897
<i>Maybe I tried to kiss her, who cares?</i>

919
01:29:57,064 --> 01:30:01,693
<i>The point is that she will torture,</i>
<i>torture, torture me all my life.</i>

920
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:03,403
<i>She simply doesn't care about me.</i>

921
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:06,657
<i>No, this is not true. She cares a lot.</i>
<i>She worships my presence.</i>

922
01:30:06,823 --> 01:30:10,536
<i>She feels sorry for me.</i>
<i>Pity. That's the worst.</i>

923
01:30:10,702 --> 01:30:13,497
<i>Exactly. My feeling has reached</i>
<i>the point of pathology...</i>

924
01:30:13,664 --> 01:30:16,667
<i>...and I can't seduce anyone</i>
<i>without pathology.</i>

925
01:30:21,129 --> 01:30:24,800
You believe you can seduce her with
your creepy, pathological little gifts?

926
01:30:24,967 --> 01:30:28,470
They all ended up in the trash,
blinded by your....

927
01:30:29,137 --> 01:30:31,181
-No.
-Nobody is waiting for you at the bar.

928
01:30:31,348 --> 01:30:34,101
Stéphanie never came.
She lost interest in you long ago.

929
01:30:35,185 --> 01:30:37,563
-lt's too late. Stéphanie moved on.
-No.

930
01:30:37,729 --> 01:30:40,023
-Stéphanie moved on. Moved on.
-Go away.

931
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:41,400
<i>Will never change her mind.</i>

932
01:30:42,067 --> 01:30:44,236
Girls never change their mind
when it's over.

933
01:30:51,159 --> 01:30:53,745
Open the door. l know you are there.

934
01:30:54,204 --> 01:30:56,206
Open the door.

935
01:30:56,373 --> 01:30:59,334
You forgot about me.

936
01:31:01,712 --> 01:31:04,506
Stop playing with me.

937
01:31:08,886 --> 01:31:12,014
l never want to see you again.

938
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:25,754
Say it.

939
01:32:25,963 --> 01:32:28,757
Say it, you have to say it.

940
01:32:28,924 --> 01:32:32,052
-Listen to me. Listen to me, say it.
-Camera there.

941
01:32:32,219 --> 01:32:34,596
-Say it.
-Okay, it's all in order. Okay.

942
01:32:35,639 --> 01:32:39,893
-lt won't happen. You have to say it.
-Yeah, just wait a second, wait a second.

943
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:42,521
-Go on, say it.
-Okay. Perfect. Yeah.

944
01:32:42,688 --> 01:32:46,191
Just-- Okay. Right there.
Okay, now look at the camera.

945
01:32:46,358 --> 01:32:48,610
-Will you marry me?
-Yes.

946
01:33:47,586 --> 01:33:49,046
l've changed my mind.

947
01:34:21,995 --> 01:34:23,413
-Hey, Stéphane.
-Hey.

948
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:25,415
What's going on?

949
01:34:25,874 --> 01:34:28,794
Nothing's going on. l'm just leaving.

950
01:34:28,961 --> 01:34:31,046
Yeah, l know.

951
01:34:32,506 --> 01:34:34,716
Are you still upset with me?

952
01:34:35,425 --> 01:34:38,971
Well, let's just say that
there are some unsolved issues.

953
01:34:39,137 --> 01:34:40,389
Yeah.

954
01:34:41,223 --> 01:34:42,641
You're not gonna let me in?

955
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,436
lnstall a toilet paper dispenser
because people are wiping...

956
01:34:46,603 --> 01:34:48,480
...their dirty Sanchez here
on your door.

957
01:34:48,647 --> 01:34:49,940
Oh, shut up.

958
01:34:51,608 --> 01:34:53,443
How is your head?

959
01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:55,237
lt's okay.

960
01:34:55,737 --> 01:34:57,406
lt's not normal, though.

961
01:34:57,614 --> 01:34:59,533
Oh, well, of course it's not.

962
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:03,871
-lt's never going to be.
-Yeah, well, it is not attractive to you.

963
01:35:04,788 --> 01:35:07,124
l'm glad l made it
through your door, though.

964
01:35:07,291 --> 01:35:08,667
Don't be glad.

965
01:35:08,834 --> 01:35:10,085
Be sad.

966
01:35:12,129 --> 01:35:14,047
Your English is very good.

967
01:35:14,214 --> 01:35:15,507
What about your French?

968
01:35:15,674 --> 01:35:19,011
No, l can't speak French with you.
l'm too shy.

969
01:35:19,178 --> 01:35:21,263
The only thing l can say is:

970
01:35:26,143 --> 01:35:28,103
Oh, damn it, Stéphane.

971
01:35:28,270 --> 01:35:30,272
What if someone catches fire?

972
01:35:33,817 --> 01:35:35,944
We've got to help him. Quick.

973
01:35:45,621 --> 01:35:47,873
Go, go, go!

974
01:35:57,424 --> 01:36:00,135
Anarchy in the cellophane!

975
01:36:05,599 --> 01:36:07,768
You've been crying?

976
01:36:07,935 --> 01:36:11,480
l like it when you cry
because you have to wear your glasses.

977
01:36:14,149 --> 01:36:16,735
l actually don't like it when you cry.

978
01:36:17,194 --> 01:36:19,238
l find it horrible.

979
01:36:19,696 --> 01:36:22,115
Especially when it's not for me.

980
01:36:22,491 --> 01:36:24,409
Will you cry a little when l'm dead?

981
01:36:24,743 --> 01:36:28,539
l hate people that pretend that they want
everyone to celebrate their death...

982
01:36:28,705 --> 01:36:32,084
...you know, and everyone is having
a blast at the party...

983
01:36:32,251 --> 01:36:34,545
...and nobody gives a shit
for the dead.

984
01:36:34,711 --> 01:36:36,880
That's horrible. That's bullshit.

985
01:36:37,047 --> 01:36:41,718
lt's like, ''Hey, sleep with my girlfriend
after my cremation. Do you mind?''

986
01:36:41,885 --> 01:36:45,097
You know? Well, my problem is that
l don't have a girlfriend.

987
01:36:45,264 --> 01:36:47,224
And l'm not dead.

988
01:36:52,729 --> 01:36:55,357
Look. Put your finger here.

989
01:36:55,566 --> 01:36:57,025
Touch here.

990
01:36:57,234 --> 01:36:59,820
At the back of the ear and the glasses.

991
01:36:59,987 --> 01:37:04,032
lt feels like the glasses were
part of your body.

992
01:37:04,241 --> 01:37:06,994
Oh, true. That's weird.

993
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:10,122
-l always liked that.
-My contacts are killing me.

994
01:37:11,164 --> 01:37:15,419
lt's like if you were touching
your penis with your left hand.

995
01:37:15,794 --> 01:37:17,546
l don't have a penis.

996
01:37:17,713 --> 01:37:19,131
You have a left hand.

997
01:37:20,924 --> 01:37:24,011
Why do you always have to be a pig?

998
01:37:26,889 --> 01:37:29,391
l'm teasing you.

999
01:37:32,477 --> 01:37:35,063
Will you fix your teeth one day?

1000
01:37:37,482 --> 01:37:41,695
-You're mean.
-No, l'm just saying because--

1001
01:37:41,945 --> 01:37:44,072
l mean, it's gonna be 40 years
until we marry.

1002
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:47,576
And l might as well take care
of my goods now, you know?

1003
01:37:47,743 --> 01:37:49,578
Well, actually, you know?

1004
01:37:49,745 --> 01:37:50,996
Don't do anything.

1005
01:37:51,163 --> 01:37:54,124
Maybe no teeth is good
for a blow job.

1006
01:37:55,584 --> 01:37:58,754
Okay. l think you should leave now.

1007
01:37:59,630 --> 01:38:00,839
You gonna be late.

1008
01:38:01,006 --> 01:38:03,717
You know, sometimes l wear my jeans
for more than a week...

1009
01:38:03,884 --> 01:38:07,596
...until they're really bad. And it
makes me feel a little bit closer to you.

1010
01:38:07,971 --> 01:38:11,433
-What do you want me to say to that?
-Nothing. Nothing.

1011
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,185
So how is your boyfriend?

1012
01:38:13,352 --> 01:38:15,437
You have a new boyfriend?

1013
01:38:15,979 --> 01:38:17,523
A new boyfriend with long hair...

1014
01:38:17,689 --> 01:38:20,067
...and goes bungee jumping and surfing.

1015
01:38:20,234 --> 01:38:21,735
Does he take you surfing?

1016
01:38:21,902 --> 01:38:24,571
lnvite me, l'll go with you.
l don't know how but maybe--

1017
01:38:24,738 --> 01:38:26,949
l mean, if you want me to.

1018
01:38:27,115 --> 01:38:29,117
l don't have a boyfriend.

1019
01:38:29,284 --> 01:38:32,120
And you have a serious problem
of distorting reality.

1020
01:38:32,287 --> 01:38:36,625
You could sleep with the entire planet
and still feel rejected.

1021
01:38:36,792 --> 01:38:40,045
-Please, l'd like you to go now.
-l like your boobs.

1022
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:43,257
l like your boobs. They are very friendly
and unpretentious.

1023
01:38:43,423 --> 01:38:45,843
l'll appreciate if, one day,
you'll show them to me?

1024
01:38:46,009 --> 01:38:48,345
-Not much to see. Now, go.
-Hey, the mezzanine.

1025
01:38:48,554 --> 01:38:50,222
You finished the mezzanine.

1026
01:38:50,389 --> 01:38:52,558
l thought you were never gonna finish it.

1027
01:38:52,724 --> 01:38:55,310
Like the boat and everything else.

1028
01:38:55,686 --> 01:38:57,312
ls it solid?

1029
01:38:58,188 --> 01:39:01,275
Can it hold a boy? A couple?

1030
01:39:01,692 --> 01:39:03,735
What are you doing--? Get out.

1031
01:39:03,902 --> 01:39:05,445
-Get out of here.
-No.

1032
01:39:05,612 --> 01:39:08,323
-Get out or l'll call your mother.
-No, my mother? No. No.

1033
01:39:08,532 --> 01:39:10,117
Not my mother.

1034
01:39:10,534 --> 01:39:14,162
-You're gonna miss your plane.
-l don't care. l don't care.

1035
01:39:14,746 --> 01:39:17,082
Why do you do this to me?

1036
01:39:17,249 --> 01:39:18,750
What have l done to you?

1037
01:39:18,917 --> 01:39:21,461
Tell me what do you want me to do?

1038
01:39:23,255 --> 01:39:25,007
l don't know.

1039
01:39:25,883 --> 01:39:27,676
Maybe touch my hair or something?

1040
01:39:27,843 --> 01:39:30,053
l can't do that.

1041
01:39:31,847 --> 01:39:33,599
Why me?

1042
01:39:33,765 --> 01:39:36,226
Because everyone else is boring.

1043
01:39:36,393 --> 01:39:38,061
And because you're different.

1044
01:39:40,063 --> 01:39:42,691
You don't like me, Stéphanie.

1045
01:40:45,921 --> 01:40:47,798
Stéphane?
