1
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,320
<i>There have been shots fired.</i>

2
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,320
<i>Total civil unrest is happening
throughout the Los Angeles area.</i>

3
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,040
<i>Dozens of police
are running down the streets.</i>

4
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,640
<i>Dozens of police
are running down the streets.</i>

5
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,840
<i>Smoke reigned over the entire city.</i>

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,840
<i>We're telling anybody
who's in downtown South Central...</i>

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,440
<i>There are 38 dead and more than...</i>

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,600
<i>The EMT are having
a hard time getting in...</i>

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,640
<i>...where truck driver Reginald Denny
was pulled from his vehicle...</i>

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,120
<i>The city resembles a war zone.</i>

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,760
<i>Crowds gathered
at Parker Center downtown.</i>

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,760
<i>...here in Hollywood, where
looters have struck many businesses.</i>

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,200
<i>There have been 3,600 structural fires.</i>

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,640
<i>Thick, black smoke rising
from the countless fires</i>

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,040
<i>in Hollywood, downtown, Compton,
Watts and Long Beach...</i>

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,400
<i>In America,</i>

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,560
<i>a girl can be crowned a princess</i>

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,680
<i>for her beauty and her grace.</i>

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,760
<i>But an Aztec princess
is chosen for her blood...</i>

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,160
Eva?

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,040
<i>...to fight for her people,
as Papi and his father fought</i>

22
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,680
<i>against those who say
we are less than they are,</i>

23
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,920
<i>who say we are not equal in beauty
and in blessings.</i>

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,240
<i>It was the first day of school,</i>

25
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,960
<i>and I was waiting for my father
to take me to the bus.</i>

26
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,240
Roberto!

27
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,560
Eva!

28
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,840
<i>And I saw the war for the first time.</i>

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,640
Eva! Eva!

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,480
Police! Open up!

31
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,800
<i>They took my father for retaliation.</i>

32
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,520
<i>He was innocent, but they took him,</i>

33
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,840
<i>because he was respected
by my people.</i>

34
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,920
<i>They called my people a gang
because we fight for our America.</i>

35
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,400
On your feet!

36
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,520
<i>When I got my initiation
into the gang life,</i>

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,640
<i>I became third generation.</i>

38
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,920
<i>They beat you so you won't break.</i>

39
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,120
<i>They are my family.</i>

40
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,920
<i>In Long Beach, it all comes down
to what you look like.</i>

41
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,760
<i>If you're Latino or Asian or black,</i>

42
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:27,440
<i>you could get blasted any time
you walk out your door.</i>

43
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,240
<i>We fight each other for territory.</i>

44
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,680
<i>We kill each other over race,
pride and respect.</i>

45
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,880
<i>We fight for what is ours.</i>

46
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,320
<i>They think they're winning
by jumping me now,</i>

47
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,600
<i>but soon they're all going down.</i>

48
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,120
<i>War has been declared.</i>

49
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,480
- Here's your coffee.
- Thank you.

50
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,520
I brought my lesson plans.
I'd love it if you'd look them over.

51
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,040
Yes, and these are the classes
you'll start with.

52
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,440
Freshman English, four classes,
about 150 students in all.

53
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,640
Some of them
are just out of juvenile hall.

54
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,440
One or two might be wearing ankle cuffs
to monitor their whereabouts.

55
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,360
And you see here,
we'll have to revise your lesson plans.

56
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,200
And if you look at their scores,
these vocabulary lists

57
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,040
<i>and some of these, the books,
Homer's The Odyssey,</i>

58
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,640
they're gonna be too difficult for them.

59
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,720
All right.

60
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,640
Also, for most of them to get here

61
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,920
it takes three buses,
almost 90 minutes each way.

62
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,000
My God.

63
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,760
So I wouldn't give them too much
of a homework load.

64
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,480
You'll just be wasting a lot of time
following up on overdue work.

65
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,320
All right. Thank you.

66
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,560
- You're from Newport Beach?
- Yes.

67
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,240
It's too bad you weren't here
even two years ago, you know.

68
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,480
We used to have one of the highest
scholastic records in the district,

69
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,000
but since voluntary integration
was suggested,

70
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,160
we've lost over 75º/º
of our strongest students.

71
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,560
Well, actually, I chose Wilson
because of the integration program.

72
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,640
I think what's happening here
is really exciting, don't you?

73
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,120
My father was involved
in the civil rights movement.

74
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,520
And I remember when I was watching
the LA riots on TV,

75
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,280
I was thinking of going
to law school at the time.

76
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,040
And I thought, "God, by the time

77
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,480
"you're defending a kid in a courtroom,
the battle's already lost. "

78
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,080
I think the real fighting
should happen here in the classroom.

79
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,040
Well, that's a very

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,880
well-thought-out phrase.

81
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,360
Erin,

82
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,080
I think you're a lovely, intelligent woman.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,080
But you're a first-time teacher.

84
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,280
As head of this department,
I have to be confident

85
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,760
you're capable of dealing
with what we have to face here.

86
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,000
I am.

87
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,680
I know I have a lot to learn as a teacher,
but I'm a really good student.

88
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,760
I am, and I really want to be here.

89
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,760
- Those are lovely pearls.
- Thank you. From my father.

90
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,800
I wouldn't wear them to class.

91
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,000
Honey?

92
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,200
What?

93
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,400
Do I look like a teacher?

94
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Hey!

95
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,240
Hey, Chris, yo, what up?

96
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

97
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,720
Hey, yo, let's sit right here, man.

98
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Hi.

99
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,440
Hey, girl, you wanna give me
some fries with that shake?

100
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,720
My name is Erin Gruwell.
Welcome to Freshman English.

101
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,120
<i>I give this bitch a week.</i>

102
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Hi.

103
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,320
Okay. Brandy Ross?

104
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,080
Gloria Munez.

105
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,360
Alejandro Santiago.

106
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,160
Andre Bryant.

107
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,720
Eva Benitez.

108
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,360
Eva, not Eva.

109
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,840
Eva.

110
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,000
I have to go to the bathroom.

111
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,240
- Okay, make sure that you take a...
- Yeah, I know.

112
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,280
Ben Samuels?

113
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,280
<i>That white boy hoping
he's in the wrong room.</i>

114
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,600
<i>I gotta get out of here.</i>

115
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,640
- Sindy Ngor.
- Right here.

116
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,960
Is that correct?

117
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,040
- Jamal Hill?
- Man, what am I doing in here?

118
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,200
This whole ghetto-ass class
has got people in here

119
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,160
<i>looking like a bad rerun of Cops
and shit.</i>

120
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,040
You know what I'm saying? It's true.

121
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,600
- Are you Jamal?
- Yeah.

122
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,360
Well, for some reason
they have you registered in this class.

123
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,360
- Yeah, and that's some bullshit.
- It's the dumb class, coz.

124
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,520
It means you're too dumb.

125
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,640
- Man, say it to my face, coz.
- I just did.

126
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,360
See what I mean? Dumb.

127
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,680
- Man, I know you ain't talking to me!
- Okay...

128
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,280
Look, homey,
I'll beat that ass, homeboy.

129
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Can you please sit back down?

130
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,440
Look, I got your spot on the team.

131
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,800
That's why you're over there
wagging your tongue.

132
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,120
Please sit back in your seats.

133
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,760
Look, your spot is good as gone. I don't
know why you keep wasting your time

134
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,560
coming to practice with them
two-year-old Nikes on your feet!

135
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,560
You don't know nothing about me, coz!

136
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,800
Broke down my whole situation.

137
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,920
Jamal?

138
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,920
So, now you're in my face now, right?

139
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,800
Sit your punk ass down!
Sit your punk ass down, homeboy!

140
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,840
I will run that ass off the field.

141
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,400
Shut your ass up. What's up, homey?

142
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,000
I mean, what's up?
Sit your ass down, homey!

143
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,000
Excuse me,
may I please get some help in here?

144
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,040
So do something! Back up!

145
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,120
You touching me now?

146
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,560
Sit down, homeboy. Back up,
I'm not gonna tell you again.

147
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,800
You gonna look at my face now, right?

148
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,120
You ain't taking nothing
from me, homeboy!

149
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,040
I will run your ass off the field!

150
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,240
Boy, sit your ass back down.

151
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,960
Don't even worry about it,
I'm gonna see you.

152
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
Tell him. Sit his ass down.

153
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,480
Sit your ass down.

154
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,440
Thank you. Let him out of here, man.
That's some bullshit.

155
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,880
Erin?

156
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,360
Erin, this is Brian Gelford.

157
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,160
He teaches Junior English
and the Distinguished Honors Classes.

158
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,920
- Hi. Erin Gruwell. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

159
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,600
- You saw a little action today, I hear.
- Yeah. It happened so fast.

160
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,560
Well, don't be discouraged.

161
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,720
You put your time in, in a few years,
you'll be able to teach juniors.

162
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,960
They're a pleasure.

163
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,640
By then, most of your kids
will be gone anyway.

164
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,280
- What do you mean?
- Well, eventually, they just stop coming.

165
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, if I do my job,
they might be lining up at the door.

166
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,800
- Right?
- Yeah.

167
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,400
- Nice pearls.
- Thank you.

168
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,160
<i>If it was up to me,
I wouldn't even be in school.</i>

169
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,080
<i>My probation officer threatened me,</i>

170
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,600
<i>telling me it was either school
or boot camp.</i>

171
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,040
<i>Dumbass.</i>

172
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,960
<i>He thinks that the problems
going on in Long Beach</i>

173
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,080
<i>aren't going to touch me at Wilson.</i>

174
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,920
<i>My PO doesn't understand
that schools are like the city,</i>

175
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,000
<i>and the city is just like a prison,</i>

176
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,240
<i>all of them divided into
separate sections, depending on tribes.</i>

177
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,320
<i>There's Little Cambodia.</i>

178
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,640
<i>The Ghetto.</i>

179
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,480
<i>Wonder Bread Land.</i>

180
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,760
<i>And us,
South of the Border or Little Tijuana.</i>

181
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,760
<i>That's just the way it is,
and everyone knows it.</i>

182
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,800
<i>But soon enough, you have little
wannabes trying to hit you up at school,</i>

183
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,120
<i>demanding respect they haven't earned.</i>

184
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,760
<i>It looks like this, one tribe drifting
quietly to another's territory</i>

185
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,320
<i>without respect,
as if to claim what isn't theirs.</i>

186
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,360
<i>An outsider looking in
would never see it, but we could feel it.</i>

187
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,280
<i>Something was coming.</i>

188
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,520
Settle down.

189
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,360
Let's go over the first name
on the list, Homer.

190
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,240
<i>Homer's The Odyssey.</i>

191
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,960
I know Homer the Simpson.

192
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,760
No, this Homer was an ancient Greek,

193
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,040
but maybe he was bald
just like Homer Simpson.

194
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,280
Okay.

195
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,440
What's up?

196
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,360
Quietly, please.

197
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,400
Mrs. Gruwell,
he just took my damn bag!

198
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,760
Shut up!
Ain't nobody touched your damn bag.

199
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,800
Yeah, I saw you.

200
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,920
Jamal. Jamal. Get her backpack.

201
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,320
I didn't do nothing anyway!

202
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,520
- Jamal. Jamal.
- Okay.

203
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,600
Wait! Wait! Please, stay in your seats!
Wait! Stay in your seats! Please!

204
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,000
Slanty-eyed bitch!

205
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,800
<i>Return to your classrooms.</i>

206
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,520
<i>Return to the classrooms immediately.</i>

207
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,160
That's all you got?

208
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,080
<i>Clear the school lawn
and the recreation field now!</i>

209
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,720
<i>...classrooms, or you will be subject
to disciplinary action.</i>

210
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,040
<i>You can best help yourself
and your fellow students</i>

211
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,600
<i>and your school by returning
to your classrooms now.</i>

212
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,040
<i>Please return to your classrooms.</i>

213
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,840
Get up, bitch!

214
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,200
<i>All students must return
to their classrooms immediately.</i>

215
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,080
Erin?

216
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,600
Erin.

217
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,160
Hey, baby.

218
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,320
You okay?

219
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,520
Come here.

220
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,320
Are you sure about this?

221
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,560
Well, it's not exactly how I pictured it.

222
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,440
Don't tell my dad.

223
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,160
Hopefully, he hasn't seen the news.

224
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,040
- So, how's work?
- Dad.

225
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,640
- I was asking your husband.
- It's good. I mean, for now.

226
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,880
It's a good company.

227
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,880
I pretty much run
the computer data department.

228
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,120
- I thought you were an architect.
- He is. He's just taking a break.

229
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,840
And the money's good for now.

230
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,400
How much are you making,
$27,000 before taxes?

231
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,040
If you know, why are you asking?

232
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,880
So, what's everybody gonna eat?

233
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,880
With your brains,
you could run a major corporation.

234
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,600
Instead, I worry all night
because you're a teacher at Attica.

235
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,560
Can you hear what you're saying?

236
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,080
How many times have I listened to you
about walking civil rights marches?

237
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,880
These gangs are criminals,
not activists. You read the papers?

238
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,760
They said the same thing
about the Black Panthers.

239
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,760
I'll lay odds your kids don't even know

240
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,840
who Rap Brown
or Eldridge Cleaver were.

241
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,560
You're gonna waste your talents
on people

242
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,040
who don't give a damn about education.

243
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,080
It breaks my heart.

244
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,480
I tell you the truth.

245
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,920
Well...

246
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,760
I'm sorry. I can't help that.

247
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,040
- You think this is good enough for her?
- Yeah, I do.

248
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,440
Look, Steve,

249
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,840
if Erin thinks she can teach these kids,
she can.

250
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,240
You telling her she can't
is just gonna make her mad.

251
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,800
So he doesn't like your job. So what?
Why do you let it get to you?

252
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,880
I don't know, it just does.
I'm not used to disappointing him. I...

253
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,080
Just let me know
when I can brush my teeth.

254
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
- I hate that we don't have our own sinks.
- Come in. There's room.

255
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,440
All right. Thank you.

256
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,520
I can't believe he brought up my salary.

257
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,320
What's happened to him?

258
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,600
He was like Atticus Finch to me
when I was growing up,

259
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,160
and now he's talking about salaries?
I think he's playing too much golf.

260
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,720
In fact, I think he needs an intervention.

261
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,120
Why isn't being a teacher
good enough for him?

262
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,880
Honey, just calm down.

263
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,080
You know, except for marrying me,

264
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,640
you never seriously disappoint him.
He worships you.

265
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,040
He likes you. He just doesn't...

266
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,240
He just doesn't think
I'm good enough for you, which is fine.

267
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,080
That's what fathers do.
I'm sure I'll be that way someday.

268
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,480
Look, just, you know, stop worrying
about being his perfect daughter.

269
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,040
You don't live in his house,
you live in ours.

270
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,680
Or until we find one.

271
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,720
- Or until you build us one.
- Yeah.

272
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,120
With extra sinks.

273
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,000
You're a teacher
because you say you are.

274
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,640
I have this idea.

275
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,480
We're gonna be covering poetry.
Who here likes Tupac Shakur?

276
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,520
It's 2Pac.

277
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,760
2Pac Shakur. Excuse me.
Raise your hand.

278
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,800
Really? I thought there'd be more fans.

279
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,400
I have the lyrics to this song printed out.

280
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,120
I want you to listen to this phrase
I have up on the board.

281
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,720
It's an example of an internal rhyme.

282
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,120
What he does is
very sophisticated and cool, actually.

283
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,040
"Man-child in the promised land
couldn't afford many heroes

284
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,400
"Moms was the only one there
Pops was a no-show

285
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,680
"And, no, I guess you didn't know
that I would grow to be so strong

286
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,160
"You looking kinda pale, was it the ale?
Oh, pops was wrong

287
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,520
"Where was the money that you said
you would send me?

288
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,800
"Talked on the phone
and you sounded so friendly"

289
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,760
- Think we don't know 2Pac?
- White girl gonna teach us about rap.

290
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,800
No, it's not that.
See, what I was trying to do...

291
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,640
You have no idea
what you're doing up there, do you?

292
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,520
You ever been a teacher before?

293
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,920
And teacher gets nailed, y'all!

294
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,280
All right, Jamal, enough.
Jamal! That's enough!

295
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,920
You know what? I want you to move
to this front seat right here now.

296
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,200
- What?
- Come on.

297
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,120
I am sick of these antics
in my classroom.

298
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,000
Well, there you are.

299
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,640
I was wondering when
you were gonna lose that damn smile.

300
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,000
Switch with Ben.

301
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,520
- Come on.
- I can't go back there alone.

302
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,520
- It'll be fine.
- No, it won't.

303
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,680
I'm not sitting near him.

304
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,960
I ain't going up there without my homey.

305
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,360
I'm not sitting back there alone!

306
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,680
- All right.
- Shut up.

307
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,840
All right, you know what?

308
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,320
I want you all to move
to this side of the room.

309
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,400
You in the back, up here.
Sindy and all of you, move to the back.

310
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,560
Come on. Let's go. Now!

311
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,560
Get your ass back to China, all of y'all.

312
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,320
- You're all little midget-ass punks.
- Move before I stomp your peanuts.

313
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,080
Boo!

314
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,680
Get your ass to the back, boy.

315
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,120
Get off my desk.

316
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,320
So, everybody happy
with the new borders?

317
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,200
Eva?

318
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,880
Where are you going?

319
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,280
Hey! Hey!

320
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,720
This is bull! Come on, man! What the...

321
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,840
What the hell? Damn!

322
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,120
I want my money back!

323
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,840
This shit took my damn money!
I want my damn money back!

324
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,320
Look what you putting me through. Shit!

325
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,120
Learn to speak the damn language!
You're from this country, aren't you?

326
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,960
I want my money back!

327
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,240
I want my money back!

328
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,160
I want my money back!

329
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,440
Come on! Let's go!

330
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,600
Come on, come on, girl! Let's go!

331
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,440
<i>Paco was scared.</i>

332
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,080
<i>In the car, he said,</i>

333
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,040
<i>"You can't go against your own people,
your own blood. "</i>

334
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,560
<i>The same words
my father used so many times.</i>

335
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,120
<i>Only I saw Paco.</i>

336
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,920
<i>The others were turned away.</i>

337
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,040
<i>So when the police questioned me,
I knew I had to protect him.</i>

338
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,160
All right, everyone, we need to get
started so classes won't be too delayed.

339
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,120
Principal Banning
would like to say something

340
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,120
in the light of last night's events.

341
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,920
I've spoken to the police.

342
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,560
As you might already know,
there were persons involved

343
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,920
in last night's shooting
who are Wilson students.

344
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,800
Grant Rice has been arrested
as a prime suspect.

345
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,200
Ms. Gruwell,

346
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,880
apparently one of your students,
Eva Benitez...

347
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,960
- Eva.
... has identified him as the shooter.

348
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,360
She's the prime witness in the case.

349
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,480
It is our policy not to discuss
the subject inside the classroom.

350
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,480
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

351
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,200
Hey, Tiny, check this out.

352
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,680
Hey. Hey!

353
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,040
Yes?

354
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,200
All right.

355
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Gloria?

356
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,960
Please read the first sentence
on the board.

357
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,000
Why me?

358
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,920
Because I know
how much you love to read.

359
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,680
Close the magazine.

360
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,120
"Odysseus had no sense of direction. "

361
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,120
Now, none of these sentences
are correct.

362
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,560
I'd like you to rewrite these sentences
using the proper tenses

363
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,080
and spelling on page four
of your workbooks.

364
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,760
I don't have a page four. It got torn out.

365
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,120
Okay, why don't you just use
the next blank page?

366
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,640
What's going on?

367
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,600
What is that? Give it to me.

368
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,120
- What is this?
- Just leave it alone.

369
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,000
You think this is funny?

370
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,920
Tito?

371
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,440
Would this be funny
if it were a picture of you?

372
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,040
It ain't.

373
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,360
Close the workbooks.

374
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,920
Maybe we should talk about art.
Tito's got real talent, don't you think?

375
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,800
- Yeah, yeah.
- Go, Tito.

376
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,240
You know something?

377
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,960
I saw a picture just like this once
in a museum.

378
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,120
Only it wasn't a black man,
it was a Jewish man.

379
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,880
And instead of the big lips,
he had a really big nose,

380
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,520
like a rat's nose.

381
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,560
But he wasn't
just one particular Jewish man,

382
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,760
this was a drawing of all Jews.

383
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,320
And these drawings
were put in the newspapers

384
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,800
by the most famous gang in history.

385
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,600
That's us, dawg.

386
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,400
You think you know all about gangs?

387
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,240
You're amateurs.

388
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,760
This gang would put you all to shame.

389
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,000
And they started out poor and angry,
and everybody looked down on them.

390
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,920
Until one man decided
to give them some pride,

391
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,320
an identity and somebody to blame.

392
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,920
You take over neighborhoods?

393
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,000
That's nothing compared to them.
They took over countries.

394
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,440
And you wanna know how?

395
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,280
They just wiped out everybody else.

396
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,160
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

397
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,560
Yeah, they wiped out
everybody they didn't like,

398
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,680
and everybody they blamed
for their life being hard.

399
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,320
And one of the ways they did it
was by doing this.

400
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,840
See, they'd print pictures like this
in the newspapers.

401
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,760
Jewish people with big, long noses.
Blacks with big, fat lips.

402
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,360
They'd also publish scientific evidence

403
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,520
that proved Jews and blacks
were the lowest form of human species.

404
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,080
Jews and blacks
were more like animals.

405
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,440
And because they were just like animals

406
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,640
it didn't really matter
whether they lived or died.

407
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,800
In fact, life would be a whole lot better
if they were all dead.

408
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,520
That's how a holocaust happens.

409
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,040
And that's what you all think
of each other.

410
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,120
You don't know nothing, homegirl.

411
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,640
No, I don't, Marcus!
So why don't you explain it to me?

412
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,680
I ain't explaining shit to you!

413
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,160
Do you even know how we live?

414
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,640
We was here first, man.

415
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,800
Just shut that shit up, homeboy.

416
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,640
All right! All right! All right!

417
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,920
So what you're saying is,
if the Latinos weren't here,

418
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,960
or the Cambodians or the blacks
or the whites or whoever they are,

419
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,560
if they weren't here, everything
would be better for you, isn't that right?

420
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,080
Of course it'd be better!

421
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,000
Lt'd be better if you weren't here.

422
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,600
Right. Right.

423
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,240
It starts with a drawing like this,

424
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,840
and then some kid dies in a drive-by,
never even knowing what hit him.

425
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,760
You don't know nothing!

426
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,240
You don't know the pain we feel.

427
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,360
You don't know what we got to do.

428
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,520
You got no respect for how we living.

429
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,040
You got us in here,
teaching us this grammar shit,

430
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,200
and then we got to go out there again.

431
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,720
And what are you telling me
about that, huh?

432
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,360
What are you doing in here that makes
a goddamn difference to my life?

433
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,560
You don't feel respected.
Is that what you're saying, Eva?

434
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,160
Well, maybe you're not.
But to get respect, you have to give it.

435
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,760
That's bullshit.

436
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,840
What?

437
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,920
Why should I give my respect to you?

438
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,600
'Cause you're a teacher?

439
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,960
I don't know you.

440
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,400
How do I know
you're not a liar standing up there?

441
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,440
How do I know you're not
a bad person standing up there?

442
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,960
I'm not just gonna give you my respect
because you're called a teacher.

443
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,000
White people always wanting their
respect like they deserve it for free.

444
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,880
I'm a teacher.
It doesn't matter what color I am.

445
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,760
It's all about color.

446
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,720
It's about people deciding
what you deserve,

447
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,040
about people wanting
what they don't deserve,

448
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,360
about whites thinking
they run this world no matter what.

449
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,320
You see, I hate white people.

450
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,200
- You hate me?
- Yeah.

451
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,280
- You don't know me.
- I know what you can do.

452
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,040
I saw white cops shoot my friend
in the back for reaching into his pocket!

453
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,320
His pocket.

454
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,080
I saw white cops break into my house

455
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,680
and take my father for no reason
except because they feel like it!

456
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,800
Except because they can.

457
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,280
And they can because they're white.

458
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,120
So I hate white people on sight!

459
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,840
Ben, do you have anything to say?

460
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,640
Can I please get out of here?

461
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,600
Lady, stop acting like you're trying
to understand our situation

462
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,080
and just do your little babysitting
up there.

463
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,360
- That's all you think this is?
- It ain't nothing else.

464
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,600
When I look out in the world,

465
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,040
I don't see nobody that looks like me
with their pockets full,

466
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,520
unless they're rapping a lyric
or dribbling a ball.

467
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,920
So what else you got in here for me?

468
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,360
And what if you can't rap a lyric
or dribble a ball?

469
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,920
- It ain't this. I know that much.
- Damn right.

470
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,000
And you all think you're gonna make it
to graduation like this?

471
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,840
I made it to high school.
Ain't nobody stopped me.

472
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,800
Lady, I'm lucky if I make it to 18.
We in a war.

473
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,440
We're graduating every day we live,

474
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,760
because we ain't afraid to die
protecting our own.

475
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,000
At least when you die for your own,
you die with respect, you die a warrior.

476
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,080
That's right.

477
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,760
So when you're dead, you'll get respect?
Is that what you think?

478
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
- That's right.
- That's right.

479
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

480
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,400
You know what's gonna happen
when you die?

481
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,400
You're gonna rot in the ground.

482
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,640
And people are gonna go on living,
and they're gonna forget all about you.

483
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,880
And when you rot,

484
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,760
do you think it's gonna matter
whether you were an original gangster?

485
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,360
You're dead.

486
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,920
And nobody,
nobody is gonna wanna remember you,

487
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,960
because all you left behind
in this world is this.

488
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,000
You're raising your hand?

489
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,240
That thing that you said before,
the Holocause?

490
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,800
- Holocaust, yes.
- What is that?

491
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,040
Raise your hand if you know
what the Holocaust is.

492
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,960
Raise your hand

493
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,120
if anyone in this classroom
has ever been shot at.

494
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,920
What about this?
We were discussing the Holocaust.

495
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,400
No, they won't be able to read that.

496
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,880
We can try.
The books are just sitting here.

497
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,640
Look at their reading scores.

498
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,880
And if I give your kids these books,
I'll never see them again.

499
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,840
If I do, they'll be damaged.

500
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,560
<i>What about these? Romeo and Juliet.
That's a great gang story.</i>

501
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,160
No, not the books.
This is what we give them.

502
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,760
<i>It is Romeo and Juliet,
but it's a condensed version.</i>

503
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,840
But even these,
look how they treat them.

504
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,920
See how torn up they are?
They draw on them.

505
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,880
Ms. Campbell?

506
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,080
They know they get these

507
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,800
because no one thinks
they're smart enough for real books.

508
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,800
Well, I don't have the budget
to buy new books every semester

509
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,040
when these kids don't return them.

510
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,800
So, what do I do?
Buy their books myself?

511
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,920
Well, that's up to you,
but you'd be wasting your money.

512
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,000
Is there someone else
I can speak to about this?

513
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,000
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry, but

514
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
I don't understand.

515
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,800
Does the Long Beach Board of Ed agree

516
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,400
that these books should just sit here
and not be used at all?

517
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,040
Let me explain.

518
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,720
It's called site-based instruction.

519
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,560
It means that I and the principal
each have the authority

520
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,440
to make these kinds of decisions
without having to go to the Board,

521
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,800
who have bigger problems to solve.
Do you understand how it works now?

522
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,800
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to overstep your authority.

523
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,960
I would never do that. I just...

524
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,040
I don't know how to make them
interested in reading with these.

525
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,560
You can't make someone
want an education.

526
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,680
The best you can do is try to get them
to obey, to learn discipline.

527
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,440
That would be a tremendous
accomplishment for them.

528
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,680
Since you know Margaret
better than I do,

529
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,200
if I could just get
some backup from you.

530
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:40,000
<i>I really think that the stories like
The Diary of Anne Frank and...</i>

531
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,760
That they'd be so great for them,

532
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,160
and she doesn't seem to understand
that they could relate to these stories

533
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,840
considering all that they face.

534
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,720
Oh, of course. It's a universal story.

535
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,560
I mean, Anne Frank, Rodney King,
they're almost interchangeable.

536
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,160
- Are you making fun of me?
- Yeah.

537
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,400
God, listen to what you're saying.

538
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,720
How dare you compare them
to Anne Frank?

539
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,280
They don't hide.

540
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,800
They drive around in the open
with automatic weapons.

541
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,200
I'm the one living in fear.
I can't walk out my door at night.

542
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,600
And you blame these kids?

543
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,680
This was an A-list school
before they came here.

544
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,600
And look what they turned it into.

545
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,760
I mean, does it make sense

546
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,720
that kids who want
an education should suffer

547
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,640
because their high school gets turned
into a reform school?

548
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,120
Because kids who don't want to be here,
and shouldn't be here,

549
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,480
are forced to be here

550
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,480
by the geniuses
running the school district?

551
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,800
Integration's a lie.

552
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,440
Yeah, we teachers, we can't say that
or we lose our jobs for being racist.

553
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,520
So, please, stop your cheerleading,
Erin. You're ridiculous.

554
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,080
You don't know the first thing
about these kids.

555
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,120
And you're not qualified
to make judgments about the teachers

556
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,240
who have to survive this place.

557
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,360
We're gonna play a game, all right?
It's a lot of fun. I promise.

558
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,280
Look, you can either sit in your seats
reading those workbooks,

559
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,320
or you can play a game.

560
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,000
Either way,
you're in here till the bell rings.

561
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,840
Okay. This is called the Line Game.

562
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,440
I'm gonna ask you a question.

563
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,600
If that question applies to you,
you step onto the line,

564
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,240
and then step back away
for the next question.

565
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,960
- Easy, right?
- Yeah, whatever.

566
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,640
The first question,

567
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,000
how many of you have
the new Snoop Dogg album?

568
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,760
Did you steal it?

569
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,960
Okay, back away.

570
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,080
Next question,

571
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,520
<i>how many of you have seen
Boyz n the Hood?</i>

572
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,760
Okay. Next question.

573
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,640
How many of you live in the projects?

574
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,000
How many of you know someone,
a friend or relative,

575
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,000
who was or is in juvenile hall or jail?

576
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,840
How many of you have been
in juvenile hall

577
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,120
or jail for any length of time?

578
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,440
Detention don't count.

579
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,800
Does a refugee camp count?

580
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,200
You decide.

581
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,240
How many of you know
where to get drugs right now?

582
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,040
How many of you
know someone in a gang?

583
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,600
How many of you are gang members?

584
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,400
- Nice try.
- Nice try.

585
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,400
Okay, that was a stupid question,
wasn't it?

586
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,440
Yeah.

587
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,440
You're not allowed
gang affiliations in school.

588
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,840
I apologize for asking. My badness.

589
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,040
Okay, now I'm gonna ask you
a more serious question.

590
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,520
Stand on the line if you've lost
a friend to gang violence.

591
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,800
Stay on the line if you've lost
more than one friend.

592
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,520
Three.

593
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,480
Four or more.

594
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,800
Okay, I'd like us to pay respect
to those people now.

595
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,320
Wherever you are,
just speak their name.

596
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,960
James.

597
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,480
Beatriz.

598
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,840
Thank you all very much.

599
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,640
Now, I have something for each of you.

600
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,400
Everyone has their own story,

601
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,840
and it's important for you
to tell your own story, even to yourself.

602
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,440
So, what we're going to do is

603
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,440
we're gonna write every day
in these journals.

604
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,120
You can write about whatever you want,
the past, the present, the future.

605
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,960
You can write it like a diary,
or you can write

606
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:05,240
songs, poems, any good thing,
bad thing, anything.

607
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,920
But you have to write every day.

608
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,440
Keep a pen nearby.
Whenever you feel the inspiration.

609
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,440
And they won't be graded.

610
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:17,080
How can I give an A or a B
for writing the truth, right?

611
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,840
And I will not read them
unless you give me permission.

612
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,560
I will need to see that you've made
an entry, but I'll just do this,

613
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,120
skim to see that you wrote that day.

614
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:30,280
Now, if you want me to read it, I have...
Excuse me. A cabinet over here.

615
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,920
It has a lock on it.
I will keep it open during class,

616
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,720
and you can leave your diary there
if you want me to read it.

617
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,320
I will lock this cabinet
at the end of every class.

618
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,560
Okay?

619
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,120
So, you can each come up,
one by one, and take your own journal.

620
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,040
Whenever you're ready.

621
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,040
Eva holds back,
but I know she wants to be involved.

622
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,560
She's so stubborn.

623
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,920
Who really surprised me was Brandy,
who never says a word,

624
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,640
but she was the first to step up
and take a journal. I...

625
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,480
Honey, here. Here, sit down.

626
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,040
- It's all right. No, it's all right.
- I'll move this.

627
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,320
I don't mind standing.
Food goes straight down.

628
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,200
- How much longer are you gonna be?
- I don't know.

629
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,680
- Want to help?
- Not really, I'm a terrible drawer.

630
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,480
- You're an architect.
- All right, I just don't want to.

631
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,320
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

632
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,000
No, it's nothing.

633
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,400
Well, it's just, you know,
I want to hear all this, I do.

634
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,920
It just...

635
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,720
I feel like
we haven't talked about anything,

636
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,760
other than your job, in like forever.

637
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,080
I'm sorry.

638
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,480
- Well, what's going on at work?
- Nothing.

639
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,080
I don't want to talk about that, either.

640
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,880
I just want to hang out.
I want to be home.

641
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,600
And I want to be with my schoolteacher.

642
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,000
I've always had this fantasy
about being kept late after school.

643
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:28,560
Well, I'm sorry I left
my dirty erasers at work.

644
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,960
Do all the other teachers
put in this much extra effort?

645
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,760
I don't know.
I'm kind of making it up as I go along.

646
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,400
And the other teachers don't really
talk to me. I mean, Brian and Margaret...

647
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,360
- Honey, I don't want to think.
- I'm sorry. Okay, don't think.

648
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,520
- I just wanna...
- I'm almost done, okay?

649
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,120
So, how much longer?

650
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,560
Not long. Promise.

651
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,440
Thank you so much for coming.
Susan's a terrific student. Thank you.

652
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,120
- Great to see you.
- Good night. Take care.

653
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,080
- Jim, thank you so much.
- Thanks, Brian.

654
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,200
I appreciate you guys coming
to Parents' Night.

655
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,720
Drive safe.

656
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,320
<i>In every war, there is an enemy.</i>

657
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,040
<i>I watched my mother
being half beaten to death</i>

658
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,440
<i>and watched as blood and tears
streamed down her face.</i>

659
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,400
<i>I felt useless and scared
and furious at the same time.</i>

660
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,200
<i>I felt useless and scared
and furious at the same time.</i>

661
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,800
Stay there, Brandy. Watch the kids!

662
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,240
- Get my money!
- Watch the kids!

663
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,240
<i>I can still feel the sting of the belt
on my back and my legs.</i>

664
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,440
<i>One time, he couldn't pay the rent.</i>

665
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,840
<i>And that night he stopped us on
the street and pointed to the concrete.</i>

666
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,960
<i>He said, "Pick a spot. "</i>

667
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,800
<i>Clive was my boy.
He had my back plenty of times.</i>

668
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,480
<i>We was like one fist, me and him,
one army.</i>

669
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,960
- That's heavy.
- Yeah.

670
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,440
That's the real shit right here.
Nobody'll jump us now.

671
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,480
But we got to practice
'cause this, this got power.

672
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,240
You shoot it, it...

673
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,600
<i>I sat there till the police came.</i>

674
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:04,360
<i>But when they come, all they see
is a dead body, a gun and a nigga.</i>

675
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,640
<i>They took me to juvenile hall.
First night was the scariest.</i>

676
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,960
<i>Inmates banging on the walls,</i>

677
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,000
<i>throwing up their gang signs, yelling out
who they were, where they're from.</i>

678
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,280
<i>I cried my first night.
Can't never let nobody know that.</i>

679
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,560
<i>I spent the next few years
in and out of cells.</i>

680
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,360
<i>Every day I'd worry,
"When will I be free?"</i>

681
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,560
My brother taught me
what the life is for a young black man.

682
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,960
Do what you have to,
pimp, deal, whatever.

683
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,400
Learn what colors to learn,
gang boundaries.

684
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,600
You can stay on one corner,
you can't stay on another.

685
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,320
<i>Learn to be quiet.
A wrong word can get you popped.</i>

686
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,360
If you look in my eyes,
you'll see a loving girl.

687
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,240
If you look at my smile,
you'll see nothing wrong.

688
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,960
<i>If you pull up my shirt,
you'll see the bruises.</i>

689
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,160
<i>What did I do to make him so mad?</i>

690
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,920
<i>At 16, I've seen more dead bodies
than a mortician.</i>

691
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,120
<i>Every time I step out my door,
I'm faced with the risk of being shot.</i>

692
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,720
<i>To the outside world, it's just another
dead body on the street corner.</i>

693
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,160
<i>They don't know that he was my friend.</i>

694
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,520
<i>During the war in Cambodia,</i>

695
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,560
<i>the camp stripped away
my father's dignity.</i>

696
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,040
<i>He sometimes tries
to hurt my mom and me.</i>

697
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,240
I feel like I have to protect my family.

698
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:24,160
I was having trouble deciding what
candy I wanted, then I heard gunshots.

699
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,000
I looked down to see
that one of my friends

700
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,000
had blood coming out of
his back and his mouth.

701
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,760
The next day, I pulled up my shirt
and got strapped with a gun

702
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,040
I found in an alley by my house.

703
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,320
<i>I don't even know how this war started.</i>

704
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,320
<i>It's just two sides
who tripped each other way back.</i>

705
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,840
<i>Who cares about the history behind it?</i>

706
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,000
<i>I am my father's daughter.</i>

707
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:49,280
<i>And when they call me to testify,
I will protect my own no matter what.</i>

708
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,960
<i>Nobody cares what I do.
Why should I bother coming to school?</i>

709
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,920
<i>My friends are soldiers, not of war,
but of the streets.</i>

710
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,760
<i>They fight for their lives.</i>

711
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,200
<i>I hate the cold feeling of a gun
against my skin.</i>

712
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,560
<i>It makes me shiver.</i>

713
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,240
<i>It's a crazy-ass life.
Once you're in, there's no getting out.</i>

714
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,840
<i>Every time I jump somebody in</i>

715
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,040
<i>and make someone a part of our gang,
it's another baptism.</i>

716
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,480
<i>They give us their life,
we give them a new one.</i>

717
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,760
I've lost many friends
who have died in an undeclared war.

718
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,360
To the soldiers and me, it's all worth it.

719
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,360
Risk your life dodging bullets,
pulling triggers.

720
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,280
It's all worth it.

721
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,840
Rum and Coke.

722
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,160
Oh, man.

723
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,440
This is...

724
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,800
Mr. Gruwell? Your table is ready.
Follow me.

725
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,040
- Dad, I got them.
- Okay.

726
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,920
Dad, I don't know what to do with this.

727
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,360
I'm not a social worker.
I'm barely a teacher.

728
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,360
Thank you.

729
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,520
These kids, they're 14, 15 years old,

730
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,240
and if they make it through the day
alive, that's good enough.

731
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,200
And I'm supposed to teach them?

732
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,440
Listen to me.

733
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,360
You're not responsible
for their lives outside that classroom.

734
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,440
- Just do your job the best you can.
- How?

735
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,720
The administration
doesn't give me any resources,

736
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,560
no books, no support.

737
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,840
So, what should I do?

738
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,560
Fulfill your obligation
till the end of the school year,

739
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,920
but line up another position.

740
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,560
Success follows experience.

741
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,880
So, get some more experience.

742
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,600
But no matter what,
you gotta remember, it's just a job.

743
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,160
If you're not right for this one,
get another job.

744
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,320
You're gonna sell bras
at a department store?

745
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,600
Just part-time.

746
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,120
I'm having a little trouble
getting books and things for the kids.

747
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,280
So, a little extra money
will give me a little more freedom

748
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,560
to do what I want.

749
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,960
And this way you can play tennis
with Evan after work.

750
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,000
Okay, let me get my head around this.

751
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,200
You're going to get an extra job
to pay for your job.

752
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,920
It's just temporary. I promise.

753
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,440
Once the kids' grades go up,
I'll get a little more help from the school.

754
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,600
And I get an employee's discount.
Isn't that great?

755
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,680
- Want a new TV?
- Yeah.

756
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,480
Excuse me, if I wanted to order
any books in bulk,

757
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,640
could I get some sort of a discount?

758
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,640
- These books are brand new.
- I know.

759
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,560
Okay, guys, gals. Listen up.

760
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,920
The only problem with this book is

761
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,720
it's about a gang member
and there's violence in it,

762
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,920
so you may not be able to read it
as part of the curriculum.

763
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,680
So, I'm going to try my best
to get permission, all right?

764
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,120
It's been a little difficult
getting their attention.

765
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,800
Up until recently, the only thing they
hated more than each other was me.

766
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,160
Well, you united them and that's a step.

767
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,240
What can I do for you?

768
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,640
I want to do more with them, and I need
the support of someone in power.

769
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,440
You have to take this up with your
department head and your principal.

770
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,920
I can't get involved
in inner school policy.

771
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,120
My principal only listens
to my department head,

772
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,120
And she's not very supportive.

773
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,880
You'll have to find a way to deal with it.

774
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,680
No, I'd rather just deal directly
with someone in power.

775
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,800
Ms. Gruwell, there's a system in place

776
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,600
Based on years of running
an educational facility.

777
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,760
- You have to follow that system.
- No. I won't.

778
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,600
Look, I'm just trying to do my job here.

779
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,480
What's the point
of a voluntary integration program

780
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,240
If the kids making it to high school
have a 5th grade reading level?

781
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,080
I enforced that program.

782
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,240
With all due respect,

783
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,560
All that program is doing
is warehousing these kids

784
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,040
Until they're old enough to disappear.

785
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,720
Look, I appreciate your intentions,

786
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,320
But there's nothing I can do
on a class-by-class basis.

787
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,800
Dr. Cohn, why should they waste
their time showing up

788
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,520
When they know
we're wasting our time teaching them?

789
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,200
We tell them, "Go to school.
Get an education. "

790
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,280
And then we say, "Well, they can't learn,
so let's not waste resources. "

791
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,040
I'm thinking trips.

792
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,920
Most of them have never
been outside of Long Beach.

793
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,400
They haven't been given the opportunity

794
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,920
To expand their thinking
about what's out there for them.

795
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,320
And they're hungry for it. I know it.

796
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,480
And it's purely a reward system.

797
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,320
They won't get anything
they haven't earned

798
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,480
By doing their work
and upping their grades.

799
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,840
But if Ms. Campbell
won't give you books

800
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:36,960
Because of budget restrictions,

801
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,200
She's not gonna approve school trips.

802
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,680
I'll raise the money.

803
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,320
I just need to know
I won't meet resistance.

804
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,720
See, I can't promise them anything
I can't deliver.

805
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,160
It only proves what they already believe.

806
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,680
All I'm saying is, Ms. Campbell
doesn't need to be bothered.

807
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,760
You're a concierge at the Marriott?

808
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,960
It's just weekends.

809
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,920
You play tennis with Evan on Saturdays.

810
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,840
And you can play golf
with my dad on Sundays.

811
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,920
You want me to play golf?

812
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,280
And the bonus is I get employee rates

813
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,520
On Marriott hotel rooms
all over the world.

814
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,560
I've heard a lot of hyphenates,

815
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,040
But a bra-selling-English-teacher-
hotel-concierge has gotta be a new one.

816
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,520
You told me your part-time job
was temporary.

817
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,880
It is. I just don't know for how long.

818
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,440
- What if I said no?
- No, what?

819
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,920
- But I can make it work, Scott.
- No, that's not the point.

820
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,320
You can do anything!
We know that already.

821
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,320
It's just that I... You...

822
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,680
You didn't even ask me.

823
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,000
- I'm just trying to do my job, Scott.
- By getting two more jobs?

824
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,360
I don't understand, Erin.

825
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,920
Scott, this is our time
to go after what we want,

826
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,160
When we're young,
before we have a family.

827
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,520
Maybe this is the perfect time
for you to go back to school,

828
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,640
Get your architect's degree.

829
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,560
Wouldn't that be great?

830
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,920
What?

831
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,760
Nothing.

832
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,080
So, I'll call you with a list of venues.

833
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,200
I've scheduled a PTA board meeting
for next week.

834
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,280
So, it should be no problem.

835
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,440
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

836
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,080
I can't get involved
in inner school policy.

837
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:13,720

00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,480

844
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,040
Look, I'm just trying to do my job here.

845
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:18,760
What's the point
of a voluntary integration program

846
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,600

So, it should be no problem.

901
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,520
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

902
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,200
- Lovely to see you, Paula.
- Good to see you, too.

903
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:52,520
- Hi.
- Hello.

904
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,400
Principal Banning received a call
from Dr. Cohn at the school board.

905
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,040
Apparently you're taking your students
on a trip?

906
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:54,920
Yes, but it's over the weekend,
so it won't affect any test schedules.

907
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:55,360
I know how busy you are,

908
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,160
And since I'm paying for it myself,
I didn't want to bother you.

909
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:56,560
I'll be right back.

910
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,000
Oh, no. No, no, no. Erin?

911
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,520
- Get back in the car.
- Dad, he lives right here.

912
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,520
I'll get him.
Get back in the car and lock your door.

913
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,960
- What's his name?
- Andre Bryant.

914
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,000
Andre.

915
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,760
<i>Since my pop split, my mom can't even
look at me, 'cause I look like my dad.</i>

916
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,960
<i>And with my brother in jail,</i>

917
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,920
<i>she looks at me and thinks
that's where I'm going, too.</i>

918
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,800
<i>She doesn't see me.</i>

919
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,320
<i>She doesn't see me at all.</i>

920
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,200
I'm going out.

921
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,400
- What up?
- Hey.

922
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,320
Where you going? I need you.

923
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,600
No, man, I can't now.
I got something to do.

924
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,240
Tonight. I'll do it tonight.

925
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,360
I gotta go do something,
and I can't carry that around with me.

926
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,480
Forget it, man, I'll get somebody else.

927
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,560
I can't be waiting all day on you.

928
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,240
Hey.

929
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,920
Sorry about your brother, man.
I hear he going away for life.

930
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,560
They won't get it.
The guy he was with confessed.

931
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,680
To who? Your brother?

932
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,680
Hey. You Andre?

933
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,080
- What up?
- Hey.

934
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,000
- What?
- Put on your seat belt.

935
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,960
You, too, young lady.

936
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,760
You kids ever been
to Newport Beach before?

937
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:39,440
What? We went there last year
on our way to Paris.

938
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,880
Paris.

939
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,040
It's good.

940
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,920
I brought you something.

941
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,400
It's a good book. I read it in school.

942
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:04,160
It's about a gang kid,
and I thought you might like to read it.

943
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,760
He told me what I had to say
when I'm on the stand.

944
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,160
<i>At the beginning of the tour, they give
you a card with a child's picture on it.</i>

945
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,360
<i>You could find out who they were
and what camp they were sent to.</i>

946
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,120
<i>And at the end of the tour,
you could find out if they survived.</i>

947
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,120
<i>I got a little girl from Italy.</i>

948
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,920
Tito, your hat.

949
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,120
<i>Kristallnacht, they called it.
The Night of Broken Glass.</i>

950
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,480
<i>Hundreds of synagogues
looted and burned.</i>

951
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,200
<i>More than 7,000
Jewish stores destroyed.</i>

952
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,320
<i>Over 100 Jews killed.</i>

953
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:34,760
<i>A small center for children in Isieux
in the French province of Ain.</i>

954
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,240
<i>Among the children deported that day
to Birkenau</i>

955
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:41,560
<i>was 11-year-old Liliane Berenstein,</i>

956
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:45,400
<i>who, before leaving,
left behind a letter to God.</i>

957
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,440
<i>My little boy died.
He got off the train and they killed him.</i>

958
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,000
<i>I don't know why
it bothered me so much.</i>

959
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,160
<i>I've seen death all my life.</i>

960
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:04,920
<i>But this little boy was only five.</i>

961
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,320
<i>Ms. G had a beautiful dinner for us
at the hotel where she works.</i>

962
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,800
<i>She invited real Holocaust survivors
from the museum to meet us.</i>

963
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,680
<i>There was Elisabeth Mann.</i>

964
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,120
I had my parents,
my sister, my two brothers.

965
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,800
<i>Gloria Ungar.</i>

966
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,400
If any of you have seen someone
with a number on their arm,

967
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,400
These were the lucky people.

968
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,840
The people who,
when we came to Auschwitz,

969
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,600
When they tattooed the people
they took us to do the slave work.

970
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:56,160
Not the others,
and that included many of my family.

971
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,440
So, we ran away,
some of the young kids.

972
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,880
I was at that time
11-and-a-half years old.

973
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,960
<i>Eddie llam.</i>

974
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,000
And where to go, I didn't know,

975
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:07,680
But I remember one place
where I used to live.

976
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,040
So when I ran there,
there was not one Jew left.

977
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:13,200
I was in the worst camp.
I was in Auschwitz.

978
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,720
<i>And Renee Firestone.</i>

979
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,560
When I arrived, my parents were
immediately taken away from me.

980
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,120
My little sister,
who was then 14 years old,

981
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,800
Stayed with me for a little while.

982
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:28,320
And then later on,
I was separated from her also.

983
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,920
<i>She lost her whole family at the camps.</i>

984
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:35,680
<i>She came to this country with $4
in her pocket and a newborn baby.</i>

985
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,760
<i>I'll never forget these people.</i>

986
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:41,600
And then she was killed
because they didn't want...

987
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,480
<i>I can't believe Ms. G did all of this
for us.</i>

988
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,240
<i>Hi, honey, it's me.</i>

989
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,840
<i>Look, we're still at the restaurant,
if you wanted to drop by.</i>

990
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,480
<i>We haven't even ordered dessert yet,</i>

991
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,880
<i>and the kids are having
such an incredible time.</i>

992
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,640
<i>You have to see them.</i>

993
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,680
<i>If you get in soon, come by.
It's only 9:30 now.</i>

994
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:10,280
<i>Okay, I'll see you later. Love you. Bye.</i>

995
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,400
How many times
I gotta tell your ass again?

996
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,520
Get your butt in here!

997
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,880
So, you had all summer
to read and consider this book.

998
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,440
And you know,
I thought it would be most valuable

999
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:31,320
To begin with Victoria
to give us the black perspective.

1000
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,080
Victoria?

1001
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,760
<i>Do I have a stamp
on my forehead that says,</i>

1002
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,320
<i>"The National Spokesperson
for the Plight of Black People"?</i>

1003
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:42,560
<i>How the hell should I know the black
perspective on The Color Purple?</i>

1004
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:46,000
<i>That's it, if I don't change classes,
I'm gonna hurt this fool.</i>

1005
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,080
<i>Teachers treat me like
I'm some kind of Rosetta stone</i>

1006
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,600
<i>for African-Americans.</i>

1007
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,360
<i>What? Black people learn how to read,</i>

1008
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,080
<i>and we all miraculously come
to the same conclusion?</i>

1009
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,600
<i>At that point, I decided to check out
my friend Brandy's English class.</i>

1010
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,120
- Good to see you, man.
- Hey, yeah.

1011
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,200
- How was your summer?
- Great.

1012
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,400
You're still white, I see.

1013
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,800
Okay, everybody. Ready?

1014
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,040
- Hey, Ms. G.
- Hi.

1015
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,440
- Hi, Ms. G.
- Hi.

1016
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,840
Okay, guys, gals, listen up!
This is what I want you to do.

1017
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:29,000
I want each of you to step forward
and take one of these Borders bags,

1018
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,880
Which contain the four books
we're gonna read this semester.

1019
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,160
All right!

1020
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,080
They're very special books,

1021
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:40,480
And they each remind me,
in some way, of each of you.

1022
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,360
But, before you take the books,

1023
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,600
I want you to take one of these glasses
of sparkling cider,

1024
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:55,360
And I want each of you to make a toast.

1025
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:59,960
We're each gonna make
a toast for change.

1026
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:04,760
And what that means is,
from this moment on

1027
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:10,440
Every voice that told you
"You can't" is silenced.

1028
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,560
Every reason that tells you things
will never change, disappears.

1029
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:21,360
And the person you were
before this moment,

1030
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,680
That person's turn is over.
Now it's your turn.

1031
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,840
Okay?

1032
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:31,680
Okay, you ready to get
this party going on?

1033
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,120
- What?
- Stop doing that, man.

1034
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,720
What's the dealio?

1035
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,520
Man, I've had boyfriends since I was,
like, 11, you know.

1036
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,840
- I believe you.
- Shut up.

1037
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:55,240
Okay, well, I was always the person

1038
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,680
That was gonna get pregnant
before I turned 16 and drop out.

1039
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:00,840
Like my mom.

1040
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,040
Ain't gonna happen.

1041
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,360
Nobody ever listens to a teenager.

1042
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,560
Everybody thinks you should be happy
just because you're young.

1043
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,560
They don't see the wars
that we fight every single day.

1044
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,080
And one day, my war will end.

1045
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,200
And I will not die.

1046
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:24,920
And I will not tolerate abuse
from anyone.

1047
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,600
I am strong.

1048
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,800
My moms kicked me out
when I got jumped into the gang life.

1049
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,120
But I'd like her to see me graduate.

1050
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,360
I'd like to be 18.

1051
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,880
Ms. G?
Can I read something from my diary?

1052
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,400
That'd be great.

1053
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,800
Who is he?

1054
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,960
Man, he's been with us
from freshman year, fool.

1055
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,880
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

1056
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:04,640
"This summer was the worst summer
in my short 14 years of life.

1057
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,440
"It all started with a phone call.

1058
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,200
"My mother was crying and begging,

1059
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:15,040
"asking for more time as if she were
gasping for her last breath of air.

1060
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,960
"She held me as tight
as she could and cried.

1061
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:24,280
"Her tears hit my shirt like bullets
and told me we were being evicted.

1062
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:28,480
"She kept apologizing to me.
I thought, 'I have no home.

1063
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,200
"'I should have asked for something
less expensive at Christmas. '

1064
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:36,040
"On the morning of the eviction,
a hard knock on the door woke me up.

1065
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:38,640
"The sheriff was there to do his job.

1066
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,880
"I looked up at the sky,
waiting for something to happen.

1067
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:48,080
"My mother has no family to lean on,
no money coming in.

1068
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,160
"Why bother coming to school
or getting good grades if I'm homeless?

1069
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:56,480
"The bus stops in front of the school.
I feel like throwing up.

1070
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:01,120
"I'm wearing clothes from last year,
some old shoes and no new haircut.

1071
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,080
"I kept thinking I'd get laughed at.

1072
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,480
"Instead, I'm greeted
by a couple of friends

1073
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,800
"who were in my English class last year.

1074
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:11,720
"And it hits me, Mrs. Gruwell,

1075
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,960
"my crazy English teacher
from last year,

1076

"Talking with friends
about last year's English and our trips,

1078
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,040
"I began to feel better.

1079
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:28,360
"I receive my schedule and the first
teacher is Mrs. Gruwell in Room 203.

1080
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:31,680
"I walk into the room and feel as though

1081
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:35,200
"all the problems in life
are not so important anymore.

1082
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,200
"I am home. "

1083
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,520
Yes, you are.

1084
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,080
But you're an honors student.

1085
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,680
If you transfer to Ms. Gruwell's class,

1086
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,760
Think how that will reflect
on your records.

1087
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,960
It doesn't matter to me.
My grades will still be the same.

1088
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,040
Look, Ms. Campbell.

1089
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,560
When I first transferred to the school,
I had a 4.0 average.

1090
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:18,200
But when I applied for advanced
placement at English and Math,

1091
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,160
I was told it would be better for me
to be in a class with my own kind.

1092
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:24,040
Now, when I did get in, my teacher said,

1093
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:27,640
"Victoria, it's not every day one finds
an African-American student

1094
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:31,440
"in A. P. And honors courses. "
As if I didn't notice.

1095
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,840
And when I asked
another honors teacher

1096
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,480
Why we don't read more
black literature, she said,

1097
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,640
"We don't read black literature
because of all the sex,

1098
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,840
"drugs, cussing and fornication!"

1099
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:47,360
I thought a simple "It's inappropriate"
would have sufficed.

1100
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,240
Erin can't do that!

1101
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,800
Distinguished Honor Students are mine.

1102
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,760
She's not allowed to teach them.
She's only been here a year.

1103
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,320
The student requested it.

1104
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,920
And Gruwell has got Cohn
in her back pocket.

1105
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:08,880
What gets me is they're violent, they
break laws, they destroy school property

1106
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:13,960
And in the end we make them special.
We reward them like...

1107
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,200
I just don't see what that teaches them.

1108
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,240
Hi! Sorry I'm late.

1109
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,600
Did you eat? I'm ordering in.
Are you hungry?

1110
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,480
What question do you want me
to answer first?

1111
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,360
Did I eat or am I hungry?
I ate. I'm not hungry.

1112
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:29,600
Something really cool happened today.
I got an honors student.

1113
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,520
- Congratulations.
- Isn't that great?

1114
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,480
She actually requested my class.

1115
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,440
Can you teach an honors student?

1116
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,800
What do you mean?

1117
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,560
Well, I mean, you're used
to teaching your kind of kids.

1118
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,080
Can you teach somebody who's smart?

1119
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:43,800
Of course I can.

1120
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,720
Yeah, but it's not like you have, right?

1121
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,920
I mean, you don't really teach
what everybody else teaches.

1122
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,040
My kids' grades are up to B's.

1123
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,560
Yeah, but the point is,
that's according to you.

1124
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,320
It's not like they're really learning
what normal kids have to learn.

1125
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,160
Normal kids? Yes, they are.

1126
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,680
<i>They're reading
The Diary of Anne Frank.</i>

1127
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,080
They're learning vocabulary,
grammar, writing, poetry.

1128
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,360
All right. Okay, I apologize. Sorry.

1129
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,760
Congratulations.

1130
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,520
What is wrong with you?

1131
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,560
You know, at Deb's party,
I heard you telling people

1132
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,000
That I was an architect
and that my job was temporary.

1133
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:24,000
I want you to stop that, all right?
I like my job.

1134
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,120
Fine.

1135
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,080
You're the one who said
you were gonna be an architect.

1136
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,120
Yeah, four years ago,
before we got married.

1137
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,760
What, I'm gonna go back to school now

1138
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,680
For two years and intern for three?

1139
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,200
I'll be over 40.

1140
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,280
All right. I thought you still wanted it.

1141
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:41,240
It doesn't matter if I want it, Erin.
It doesn't mean it's going to happen.

1142
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,520
Why not?

01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,800
Tell her about your own experiences.
Tell her anything you like.

1214
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,960
But I want the letters to be perfect,

1215
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,400
So be prepared to do more
than one draft, okay?

1216
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,920
Is she gonna read the letters?

1217
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,320
Well, right now it's
a writing assignment. I'll read them.

1218
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:40,960
We should get her to read them.

1219
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,040
- Yeah, you can do that, right, Ms. G?
- Well, I don't know.

1220
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,440
Maybe we should get her
to come and speak.

1221
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,280
Yeah, and have a big dinner again.

1222
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,720
Wait. Guys.

1223
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:57,280
Guys! Everyone! Listen! She's elderly!

1224
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,720
I don't know how to contact her.
I don't even know if she travels.

1225
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,400
And it would be really expensive.

1226
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,120
We could raise the money.

1227
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,040
Ms. G?

1228
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:08,920
When Miep Gies come,
can I, like, be the one to escort her in?

1229
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,240
Five.

1230
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,440
Hi, I'm trying to get the number

1231
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,920
For the Anne Frank Foundation
in Basel, Switzerland.

1232
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,160
Come in, Margaret.

1233
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:46,560
<i>Ms. G sent our letters all the way
to Amsterdam</i>

1234
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,360
<i>to Miep Gies, herself.</i>

1235
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,680
<i>When Ms. G made up her mind
about something,</i>

1236
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:53,160
<i>there was no stopping her,
man, for real.</i>

1237
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:04,160
<i>And after we raised the money to bring
her to Long Beach, there she was.</i>

1238
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:10,080
<i>But, damn,
I didn't expect her to be so small.</i>

1239
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,360
The bounty on a Jew was about $2.

1240
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,360
Someone desperate for money
told the Gestapo.

1241
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:39,080
On August 4th,
they stormed into my office,

1242
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:45,880
And a man pointed a gun at
me and said, "Not a sound.

1243
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,920
"Not one word. "

1244
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,520
And then they went straight upstairs
to the attic.

1245
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,400
I felt so helpless.

1246
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,960
I could hear Anne screaming,
objects being thrown around.

1247
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,680
So, I ran back to my house.

1248
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,440
I looked for an earring
or knick-knacks, you know,

1249
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,200
Anything I could take back with me
to bribe them.

1250
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:08,480
So I took this back with me,
all these things,

1251
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:12,720
And the soldier there took out his gun

1252
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,440
And put it against my head.

1253
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,240
You could be shot for hiding a Jew
or go to a camp.

1254
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:28,720
So, another soldier
recognized my accent.

1255
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:32,480
He was Austrian, and so was I,

1256
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,520
But I had been adopted
by a Dutch family.

1257
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:39,280
So, he told the soldier with the gun
to let me go.

1258
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:45,440
There isn't a day
that I don't remember August 4th

1259
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:50,400
And I think about Anne Frank.

1260
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:53,920
Yes?

1261
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:03,480
I've never had a hero before.

1262
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:05,760
But you are my hero.

1263
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:09,760
Oh, no. No, no, young man, no.

1264
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,440
I am not a hero. No.

1265
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:18,800
I did what I had to do,
because it was the right thing to do.

1266
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,520
That is all.

1267
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:25,200
You know, we are all ordinary people.

1268
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:32,440
But even an ordinary secretary
or a housewife or a teenager

1269
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:39,440
Can, within their own small ways,
turn on a small light

1270
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,560
In a dark room.

1271
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,240
<i>Ja?</i>

1272
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,680
I have read your letters,

1273
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:57,360
And your teacher has been telling me
many things about your experiences.

1274
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:02,080
You are the heroes.

1275
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,840
You are heroes every day.

1276
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,720
Your faces are engraved in my heart.

1277
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,920
You hungry?

1278
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,840
You know what you're gonna say
in that courtroom?

1279
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,320
I know what I have to say.

1280
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,000
Yeah.

1281
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,840
- You know how that is.
- I know.

1282
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:55,680
And that man that put your father
in prison,

1283
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,320
He knew he was sending
an innocent man.

1284
01:25:58,680 --> 01:25:59,920
But, you know,

1285
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,320
He was just

1286
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,960
Protecting his own.

1287
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:15,520
What the hell does everybody
want from me?

1288
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,080
Hey, Mama. Mama.

1289
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,760
What the hell are you doing here?

1290
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:00,600
I want to come home.
I don't want to be in the streets no more.

1291
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:01,920
I'm sorry.

1292
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,360
I want to change. I can't do it alone.

1293
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,720
I need you, Mama.

1294
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:13,880
I need you.

1295
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,680
And what time was that?

1296
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,720
I told you, 9:00, 9:30.

1297
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,800
And you had a clear view
of the defendant,

1298
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,680
Grant Rice, in the store?

1299
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,080
I told you he was playing
the video game.

1300
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:05,040
Then what happened?
What did you see?

1301
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,480
Well, he got all whacked
because he lost the game,

1302
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:11,040
And then he started shouting and all,
threatening everybody.

1303
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:14,240
He threatened everyone?
He threatened you?

1304
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,640
No. The guy who ran the store.

1305
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,680
He wanted his money back
for the game.

1306
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,680
And what did the store owner do?

1307
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:25,640
He shouted back.
And they were fighting.

1308
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:30,000
Then he, the defendant, knocked
something over and left the store.

1309
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,920
And then what happened?
What did you see?

1310
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,520
I saw...

1311
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,600
I saw...

1312
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:07,680
Paco did it.

1313
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,320
Paco killed the guy.

1314
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,840
My father won't talk to me anymore.

1315
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:45,280
And I have to lay low for a little while
because there's word out to jump me.

1316
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,800
So I'm gonna be living with my aunt.

1317
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:55,000
See, my aunt lives even further away,

1318
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,120
So I was just wondering if I could, like,

1319
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:05,840
Stay here late with you

1320
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:07,560
Stay here late with you

1321
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:13,640
So I can get my homework done,
'cause it's late by the time I get home.

1322
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:18,880
You can stay as late as you want.

1323
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:23,960
And I can even drive you to your aunt's,
if it gets too late.

1324
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,840
Ms. G, let's not get nuts.

1325
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,000
I think I got your color.

1326
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,680
Just come by the concierge
on your way out,

1327
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,440
I'll have the directions for you.
Yep, that's fine.

1328
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:04,840
Stop! That's it! Now, now! Hey!

1329
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,880
You get an extra three seconds. Go!

1330
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,960
<i>... enraged them and provoked them
into acts of violence.</i>

1331
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:21,160
<i>In 1961, an interracial civil rights group
traveled by bus through the South</i>

1332
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,920
<i>to challenge segregation.</i>

1333
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,760
<i>Blacks sat in the front,
whites in the back.</i>

1334
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:29,600
<i>They were attacked, firebombed,
but they kept going.</i>

1335
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:34,200
<i>In Montgomery, Alabama, Jim Zwerg
offered to be the first off the bus,</i>

1336
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:36,560
<i>knowing there was a mob
waiting for them.</i>

1337
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:39,560
<i>He was almost beaten to death
so the others could get away.</i>

1338
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:43,000
<i>That kind of courage
is unbelievable to me.</i>

1339
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:46,360
<i>I was afraid of just being in this class,
and I was ashamed</i>

1340
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:50,080
<i>because I've always been the dumb kid
in school, even with my friends.</i>

1341
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:51,520
<i>But not anymore.</i>

1342
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,160
<i>And I must have some kind of courage,</i>

1343
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,840
<i>because I could have lied
to get out of here, but I stayed.</i>

1344
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:59,120
<i>I stayed.</i>

1345
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:00,800
Hi, I'm home!

1346
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:06,120
Sorry, it got late. I drove the kids home.
I didn't want them taking buses.

1347
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,880
You're never gonna believe
what happened.

1348
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,800
I'm so tired.

1349
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:15,040
It's so cute, though.
They never want to go home.

1350
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:18,760
We have such a good time together.
I'm gonna take a shower.

1351
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,560
If you have another glass,
you're gonna have a headache.

1352
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:45,520
Your bags are packed and you think
the wine's gonna give me a headache?

1353
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,120
Why are you doing this?

1354
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:52,360
Because I don't
pay enough attention to you?

1355
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,360
No. That's not it.

1356
01:34:56,640 --> 01:35:00,520
I just... I feel like I'm living a life
I just did not agree to.

1357
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:04,320
Erin, it's just...

1358
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:06,960
It's too hard.

1359
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,600
Your life is too hard?

1360
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:12,520
I think what you're doing is noble.

1361
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:16,520
And it's good. And I'm proud of you.

1362
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,360
I am.

1363
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:23,760
I just want to live my life
and not feel bad about it.

1364
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:26,880
- I'm not trying to make you feel bad.
- You don't have to try.

1365
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,680
I didn't plan on becoming responsible
for these kids.

1366
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,720
- Well, who asked you to?
- No one asked me to!

1367
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,760
They're not even your kids!

1368
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:36,520
Why do I have to be asked? Scott...

1369
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:45,200
I finally realized what I'm
supposed to be doing and I love it.

1370
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:49,800
When I'm helping these kids
make sense of their lives,

1371
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:53,120
Everything about my life
makes sense to me.

1372
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,800
How often does a person get that?

1373
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:05,920
- Then what do you need me for?
- You're my husband.

1374
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,720
Why can't you stand by me and be part
of it, the way wives support husbands?

1375
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,600
Because I can't be your wife.

1376
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,800
I wish I could make that
sound less awful.

1377
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,000
Erin?

1378
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:29,000
You know,
if you had to choose between us

1379
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:32,000
And the class,

1380
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,120
Who would you pick?

1381
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:40,400
If you love me,
how could you ever ask me that?

1382
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:42,880
Erin, look at me.

1383
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:48,320
This is all there's ever been to me.

1384
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:52,880
This is it. I'm not one of those kids.
I don't have any more potential.

1385
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:56,120
See? You don't want to be here either,

1386
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:59,440
'cause if you did, would you be
in the classroom every night?

1387
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:05,160
That's not true. I want to be here.
I love you.

1388
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,200
You love the idea of me.

1389
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:15,680
But it's such a great idea.

1390
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:20,480
I know.

1391
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:49,120
Dad? Hi.

1392
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,680
You know, I was actually trying
to call someone else,

1393
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,680
And I automatically dialed you. I'm sorry.

1394
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:59,200
Look, I'm gonna call you tomorrow,
okay?

1395
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:02,480
I need to make this call. I love you.

1396
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,400
<i>Ms. G made us read Twelve Angry Men.</i>

1397
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:21,000
<i>It's all about how this one juror
helped to turn the hearts of 11 jurors.</i>

1398
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,760
<i>It made me feel hopeful.</i>

1399
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,400
<i>At 2:00 today, my brother
was given a verdict on his own trial.</i>

1400
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:29,080
<i>No O. J. Dream Team,
just a court-appointed attorney</i>

1401
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:31,080
<i>who probably thought
his ass was guilty.</i>

1402
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:34,720
<i>And I realized Twelve Angry Men
was just a book and nothing more.</i>

1403
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,640
<i>My brother got 15 years to life.</i>

1404
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:40,360
<i>Justice don't mean
the bad guy goes to jail.</i>

1405
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,560
<i>It just means somebody
pays for the crime.</i>

1406
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:49,640
So, you got time now?

1407
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:57,760
Anyone know where Andre's been?

1408
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,120
I haven't seen him on the bus.

1409
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,680
Yeah, I haven't talked to him either.

1410
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,680
Ms. G?

1411
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,280
Are we gonna have
this same room next year, again?

1412
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:16,360
I don't know.
You're gonna be juniors next year.

1413
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,320
What do you mean?

1414
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:22,000
Well, I teach freshman
and sophomore years.

1415
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:25,120
You mean,
we're not gonna be with you next year?

1416
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:29,000
Well, I...

1417
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,400
I don't teach juniors.
I thought you guys understood that.

1418
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:35,960
What? What are you talking about?

1419
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,640
You don't wanna be our teacher
next year?

1420
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:42,160
Of course I do. I can't.

1421
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:44,640
- Why not?
- It's the Board of Ed.

1422
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,600
It's regulations.

1423
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:51,920
Ms. G hasn't been here long enough
to have seniority.

1424
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,240
Who cares about seniority?

1425
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:55,840
Shit! They can't do that!
They don't have the right!

1426
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:00,520
- Ms. G, this is our kick-it spot.
- Yeah.

1427
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:03,960
Everybody's cool with everybody.
Everybody knows everybody.

1428
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:07,400
This is the only place
where we really get to be ourselves.

1429
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,440
There's no place like this
out there for us.

1430
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,040
That's true.

1431
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:14,000
I'm not allowed
to teach junior and seniors.

1432
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:15,080
You're not allowed?

1433
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,480
Ms. G, we can fight this, you know,
like the Freedom Riders.

1434
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:22,280
Yeah, yeah,
we'll all drive around on a bus.

1435
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,280
Only this time, they try and bust us up,

1436
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,120
We bust a few of them
board members' heads.

1437
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:27,680
Marcus.

1438
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:31,280
Or we can go to the newspapers,
media. That'll get their attention.

1439
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:32,920
Or we can paint
the administration building

1440
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,400
With the word "assholes"
in various colors.

1441
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:38,720
Hey, it's something. We can do this.

1442
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:44,840
What?

1443
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:48,360
These are my books, not Scott's.
I'm packing the wrong books.

1444
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,080
Honey, take a break.

1445
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,280
Sit down.

1446
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:00,800
I can't believe I'm getting divorced.

1447
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:04,560
I never thought this would happen.

1448
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:10,400
What do I do now?

1449
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:13,680
Next year, I won't even have my kids.

1450
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,280
You think you should stay with them?

1451
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:19,320
Or is it better they move on?

1452
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,040
I don't know.

1453
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:27,080
It's just a job, like you said.

1454
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:28,720
Yeah, it is.

1455
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,520
But is the job finished?

1456
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,280
Listen to me now.

1457
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,960
What you've done with those kids...

1458
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:42,480
I don't even have words for it.

1459
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:48,920
But one thing's for sure,
you are an amazing teacher.

1460
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,000
Special.

1461
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:57,000
You have been blessed with a burden,
my daughter.

1462
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,760
And I envy you that.

1463
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:04,920
And I admire you.

1464
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:11,160
And how many fathers ever get
to say that to their daughters

1465
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,160
And really mean it?

1466
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,840
What she is suggesting
is in violation of our union charter.

1467
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:23,000
She may not move on with her students
to teach them junior year.

1468
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:25,000
She's only been here two years.

1469
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:27,120
There are teachers here
who have tenure,

1470
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:29,400
Who have worked and committed
themselves for far longer

1471
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:31,320
To attain a position of seniority.

1472
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:35,200
Not to mention their experience
in teaching students of a higher caliber.

1473
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:38,000
The Distinguished Scholars Program
is under our jurisdiction.

1474
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:40,800
I don't want to replace
the Distinguished Scholars Program.

1475
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:42,760
I just want to stay
with my kids next year.

1476
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,960
She can't. I have the juniors.

1477
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:47,000
The Board of Education
will not allow this.

1478
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,960
Teaching rotations will be disrupted,

1479
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:51,280
Retirement schedules
will be reevaluated,

1480
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:54,680
Disrespecting teachers
who have earned their way far longer

1481
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:56,840
And who focus on the classroom,

1482
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:59,680
Not on public relations
and newspaper articles.

1483
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,680
I didn't ask for those articles
to be written.

1484
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,200
She's in the middle of a divorce.

1485
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:05,720
Note, they stay late in her class,
they're eating, they're playing games!

1486
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:08,800
All right, let's all just take a breath here.
All right?

1487
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:12,160
Now I had hoped
that we could talk this out,

1488
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:13,920
Maybe come to some kind
of arrangement.

1489
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:16,440
- There is no arrangement...
- Margaret.

1490
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,680
Carl, look.

1491
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:22,200
Putting aside all obvious resentments
for the moment,

1492
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:23,640
Even if an arrangement were made

1493
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:27,680
And she could teach them as juniors,
there isn't an accredited course

1494
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:30,080
In the curriculum for her to teach.

1495
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:34,200
Unless Brian trades one of his
junior classes for a sophomore.

1496
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:35,320
No.

1497
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,160
Then there's nothing I can do.

1498
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:43,800
So that's it?

1499
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,280
Believe it or not, Ms. Gruwell,

1500
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:49,000
There are other capable teachers
in this school.

1501
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:51,040
If you've made the progress
you say you have,

1502
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:52,800
Your students should be ready
to move on.

1503
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:55,440
They might even gain something
from more experienced teachers.

1504
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:58,680
You can't teach them.
You don't even like them.

1505
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:00,520
What does that have to do
with teaching?

1506
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:03,120
I've been an educator for over 30 years.

1507
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:05,120
I have students that still remain
in touch with me.

1508
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:07,560
I know what it is to be loved
by a classroom!

1509
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:10,520
You have no idea
how many battles I've had

1510
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:12,200
Fighting to be a better teacher,

1511
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:15,520
And now, what, suddenly I'm incapable
of educating your students?

1512
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:18,200
You know, if they move on
to our classes and they fail,

1513
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,280
It'll be because they weren't prepared!

1514
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:23,040
Lt'll be because you failed, not them!

1515
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:43,400
Andre? Wait a minute before you go in.

1516
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:58,480
I heard about your brother's conviction.
I'm sorry.

1517
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:00,720
Is that why you've missed class
so much?

1518
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:02,560
I had things to do.

1519
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:07,400
About this.

1520
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:08,960
The evaluation assignment

1521
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:10,480
Was to grade yourself
on the work you're doing.

1522
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:12,920
You gave yourself an F.
What's that about?

1523
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:16,360
- It's what I feel I deserve. That's all.
- Oh, really?

1524
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:19,520
You know what this is?

1525
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:23,640
This is a "Fuck you" to me,
and everyone in this class!

1526
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,880
I don't want excuses.
I know what you're up against.

1527
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:29,360
We're all of us up against something.

1528
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:33,520
So you better make up your mind,
because until you have the balls

1529
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:36,320
To look me straight in the eye
and tell me this is all you deserve,

1530
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:37,880
I am not letting you fail,

1531
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:39,920
Even if that means coming
to your house every night

1532
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:41,640
Until you finish the work.

1533
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,480
I see who you are.

1534
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,040
Do you understand me?

1535
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,880
I can see you.

1536
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,520
And you are not failing.

1537
01:45:55,840 --> 01:46:00,560
So, take a minute.
Pull yourself together and come inside.

1538
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:03,000
I want a new evaluation.

1539
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:10,720
An F. What, are you tripping?

1540
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:19,480
I want you all to know that
Dr. Cohn and I tried very hard.

1541
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:24,880
But it's been decided we can't continue
with each other junior year.

1542
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,080
- What?
- What?

1543
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:29,440
You... Wait.

1544
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:32,040
Wait. Guys. Everyone.

1545
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:35,760
No! That don't fly, Ma!

1546
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:40,800
Look, first of all,
I'm not anyone's mother in here, okay?

1547
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:43,000
No, it doesn't mean mother.

1548
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,920
It's a sign of respect for you.

1549
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:00,880
Listen to me.

1550
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:02,360
All of you.

1551
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:07,520
Don't use me as another excuse
for why you can't make it.

1552
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:12,520
You made it to your junior year.

1553
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:16,000
Think about how you did that.

1554
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:20,800
Everyone in this room
has a chance to graduate.

1555
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:24,280
For some,
you'll be the first in your family.

1556
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:27,040
The first with a choice to go to college.

1557
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,680
Some may move faster than others.

1558
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:34,400
But you'll each have the chance.

1559
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:38,280
And you did that. Not me.

1560
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:48,600
Now, I have one

1561
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:52,080
Final project in mind.

1562
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,280
- Ms. G.
- Yeah?

1563
01:47:56,040 --> 01:48:00,800
<i>Ms. G wanted us to put our diaries
together in a book, just like Anne Frank.</i>

1564
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:03,480
<i>She got this businessman, John Tu,</i>

1565
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:06,320
<i>to donate 35 computers
so we could work.</i>

1566
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:14,440
<i>She told us we have something
to say to people.</i>

1567
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:15,760
<i>We weren't just kids
in a class anymore.</i>

1568
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:16,920
<i>We weren't just kids
in a class anymore.</i>

1569
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:20,560
<i>We were writers with our own voices,
our own stories.</i>

1570
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:22,640
<i>And even if nobody else read it,</i>

1571
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:26,200
<i>the book would be something
to leave behind that said we were here,</i>

1572
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:29,760
<i>this is what happened, we mattered.</i>

1573
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:34,280
<i>Even if it was just to each other.
And we won't forget.</i>

1574
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:38,200
<i>Ms. G didn't promise
it would get published or anything,</i>

1575
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:41,040
<i>but we could get it out there ourselves.</i>

1576
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,880
<i>She asked us to come up with a title,</i>

1577
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:46,280
<i>something to call ourselves.</i>

1578
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,120
I just received a call
from Karin Polacheck

1579
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:06,320
At the Board of Education.

1580
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:08,360
There's to be a meeting
with Dr. Cohn about your classes.

1581
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:11,800
- Do you know anything about this?
- No.

1582
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:24,520
These students, this class,
they've become a family.

1583
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:26,920
To who? To you?

1584
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,120
To each other.

1585
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:33,120
Room 203 is a kind of a home for them.

1586
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:36,800
Their trust is all wrapped up
in us being together as a group.

1587
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:38,320
Once they're out of her class,

1588
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:40,800
Believe me they'll slip back
into their old habits.

1589
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:44,680
Their reading scores, their writing
has markedly improved, Ms. Campbell.

1590
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:48,160
On paper. But what has
she accomplished in reality?

1591
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:49,840
What about new students
that come in next year?

1592
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:51,840
Can she repeat
this process every year?

1593
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:53,280
Her methods are impractical,

1594
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:55,920
Impossible to implement with regularity.

1595
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:58,400
What if every teacher
performed in this way?

1596
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,160
We have millions of children

1597
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:01,920
To get through the education system
in this country,

1598
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:03,800
And we need a means
of accomplishing that

1599
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:06,680
Which allows as many students
to benefit as possible,

1600
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:08,640
Not just special cases.

1601
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:13,400
And you honestly think you can create
this family in every classroom,

1602
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:16,360
For every grade,
for every student you teach?

1603
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:22,160
I don't know.

1604
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:29,400
Thank you.

1605
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,720
Hey, there go Ms. G.
Hey, there go Ms. G!

1606
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:01,600
What happened?

1607
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:06,040
So? Are we gonna be together
for junior year?

1608
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:12,880
No.

1609
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:15,560
- What?
- What?

1610
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,200
We're gonna be together junior
and senior year.

1611
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:25,600
Yes!

1612
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:30,080
I can't get involved
in inner school policy.

1613
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:32,280
My principal only listens
to my department head,

1614
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:34,320
And she's not very supportive.

1615
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:36,080
You'll have to find a way to deal with it.

1616
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:38,840
No, I'd rather just deal directly
with someone in power.

1617
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:41,000
Ms. Gruwell, there's a system in place

1618
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:43,800
Based on years of running
an educational facility.

1619
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,960
- You have to follow that system.
- No. I won't.

1620
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:50,760
Look, I'm just trying to do my job here.

1621
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:53,640
What's the point
of a voluntary integration program

1622
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:56,400
If the kids making it to high school
have a 5th grade reading level?

1623
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,240
I enforced that program.

1624
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,400
With all due respect,

1625
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:01,760
All that program is doing
is warehousing these kids

1626
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:03,240
Until they're old enough to disappear.

1627
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:04,880
Look, I appreciate your intentions,

1628
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:07,520
But there's nothing I can do
on a class-by-class basis.

1629
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:11,000
Dr. Cohn, why should they waste
their time showing up

1630
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:13,720
When they know
we're wasting our time teaching them?

1631
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:16,400
We tell them, "Go to school.
Get an education. "

1632
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:20,480
And then we say, "Well, they can't learn,
so let's not waste resources. "

1633
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,240
I'm thinking trips.

1634
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:25,120
Most of them have never
been outside of Long Beach.

1635
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:27,560
They haven't been given the opportunity

1636
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:30,080
To expand their thinking
about what's out there for them.

1637
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:31,520
And they're hungry for it. I know it.

1638
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:33,680
And it's purely a reward system.

1639
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:35,520
They won't get anything
they haven't earned

1640
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:37,640
By doing their work
and upping their grades.

1641
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:39,040
But if Ms. Campbell
won't give you books

1642
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:40,160
Because of budget restrictions,

1643
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:41,360
She's not gonna approve school trips.

1644
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:42,880
I'll raise the money.

1645
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,520
I just need to know
I won't meet resistance.

1646
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,880
See, I can't promise them anything
I can't deliver.

1647
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,360
It only proves what they already believe.

1648
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:55,880
All I'm saying is, Ms. Campbell
doesn't need to be bothered.

1649
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:00,960
You're a concierge at the Marriott?

1650
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:02,120
It's just weekends.

1651
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:04,080
You play tennis with Evan on Saturdays.

1652
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:06,040
And you can play golf
with my dad on Sundays.

1653
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:07,120
You want me to play golf?

1654
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,440
And the bonus is I get employee rates

1655
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,720
On Marriott hotel rooms
all over the world.

1656
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:12,760
I've heard a lot of hyphenates,

1657
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:16,200
But a bra-selling-English-teacher-
hotel-concierge has gotta be a new one.

1658
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:18,720
You told me your part-time job
was temporary.

1659
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:21,080
It is. I just don't know for how long.

1660
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:23,600
- What if I said no?
- No, what?

1661
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:28,120
- But I can make it work, Scott.
- No, that's not the point.

1662
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:30,520
You can do anything!
We know that already.

1663
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:33,520
It's just that I... You...

1664
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:35,840
You didn't even ask me.

1665
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:40,200
- I'm just trying to do my job, Scott.
- By getting two more jobs?

1666
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:42,560
I don't understand, Erin.

1667
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:46,080
Scott, this is our time
to go after what we want,

1668
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:49,360
When we're young,
before we have a family.

1669
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:51,680
Maybe this is the perfect time
for you to go back to school,

1670
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:53,840
Get your architect's degree.

1671
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,760
Wouldn't that be great?

1672
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:00,080
What?

1673
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:02,920
Nothing.

1674
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:11,240
So, I'll call you with a list of venues.

1675
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:13,360
I've scheduled a PTA board meeting
for next week.

1676
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:14,480
So, it should be no problem.

1677
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:15,640
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

1678
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:16,240
I can't get involved
in inner school policy.

1679
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:16,920
My principal only listens
to my department head,

1680
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:17,400
And she's not very supportive.

1681
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:18,000
You'll have to find a way to deal with it.

1682
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:18,760
No, I'd rather just deal directly
with someone in power.

1683
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:19,320
Ms. Gruwell, there's a system in place

1684
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:20,000
Based on years of running
an educational facility.

1685
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:20,640
- You have to follow that system.
- No. I won't.

1686
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:21,240
Look, I'm just trying to do my job here.

1687
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:21,920
What's the point
of a voluntary integration program

1688
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:22,800
If the kids making it to high school
have a 5th grade reading level?

1689
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:23,200
I enforced that program.

1690
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:23,600
With all due respect,

1691
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:24,320
All that program is doing
is warehousing these kids

1692
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:24,880
Until they're old enough to disappear.

1693
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:25,400
Look, I appreciate your intentions,

1694
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:26,160
But there's nothing I can do
on a class-by-class basis.

1695
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:26,840
Dr. Cohn, why should they waste
their time showing up

1696
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:27,560
When they know
we're wasting our time teaching them?

1697
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:28,200
We tell them, "Go to school.
Get an education. "

1698
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:29,120
And then we say, "Well, they can't learn,
so let's not waste resources. "

1699
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:29,480
I'm thinking trips.

1700
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:30,200
Most of them have never
been outside of Long Beach.

1701
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:30,760
They haven't been given the opportunity

1702
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:31,520
To expand their thinking
about what's out there for them.

1703
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:32,080
And they're hungry for it. I know it.

1704
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:32,560
And it's purely a reward system.

1705
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:33,200
They won't get anything
they haven't earned

1706
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:33,800
By doing their work
and upping their grades.

1707
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:34,400
But if Ms. Campbell
won't give you books

1708
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:34,880
Because of budget restrictions,

1709
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:35,440
She's not gonna approve school trips.

1710
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:35,840
I'll raise the money.

1711
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:36,480
I just need to know
I won't meet resistance.

1712
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:37,160
See, I can't promise them anything
I can't deliver.

1713
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:37,760
It only proves what they already believe.

1714
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:38,560
All I'm saying is, Ms. Campbell
doesn't need to be bothered.

1715
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:39,080
You're a concierge at the Marriott?

1716
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:39,480
It's just weekends.

1717
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:40,040
You play tennis with Evan on Saturdays.

1718
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:40,680
And you can play golf
with my dad on Sundays.

1719
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:41,120
You want me to play golf?

1720
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:41,680
And the bonus is I get employee rates

1721
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:42,280
On Marriott hotel rooms
all over the world.

1722
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:42,800
I've heard a lot of hyphenates,

1723
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:43,680
But a bra-selling-English-teacher-
hotel-concierge has gotta be a new one.

1724
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:44,320
You told me your part-time job
was temporary.

1725
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:44,880
It is. I just don't know for how long.

1726
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:45,400
- What if I said no?
- No, what?

1727
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:46,160
- But I can make it work, Scott.
- No, that's not the point.

1728
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:46,760
You can do anything!
We know that already.

1729
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:47,240
It's just that I... You...

1730
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:47,640
You didn't even ask me.

1731
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,480
- I'm just trying to do my job, Scott.
- By getting two more jobs?

1732
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:48,920
I don't understand, Erin.

1733
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:49,600
Scott, this is our time
to go after what we want,

1734
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:50,200
When we're young,
before we have a family.

1735
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:51,000
Maybe this is the perfect time
for you to go back to school,

1736
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:51,440
Get your architect's degree.

1737
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:51,880
Wouldn't that be great?

1738
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:52,120
What?

1739
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:52,400
Nothing.

1740
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:53,000
So, I'll call you with a list of venues.

1741
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:53,640
I've scheduled a PTA board meeting
for next week.

1742
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:54,120
So, it should be no problem.

1743
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:54,680
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

1744
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:55,400
- Lovely to see you, Paula.
- Good to see you, too.

1745
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:55,720
- Hi.
- Hello.

1746
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:56,560
Principal Banning received a call
from Dr. Cohn at the school board.

1747
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:57,240
Apparently you're taking your students
on a trip?

1748
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:58,120
Yes, but it's over the weekend,
so it won't affect any test schedules.

1749
01:54:58,120 --> 01:54:58,560
I know how busy you are,

1750
01:54:58,560 --> 01:54:59,360
And since I'm paying for it myself,
I didn't want to bother you.

1751
01:54:59,360 --> 01:54:59,760
I'll be right back.

1752
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:00,200
Oh, no. No, no, no. Erin?

1753
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:01,720
- Get back in the car.
- Dad, he lives right here.

1754
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:04,720
I'll get him.
Get back in the car and lock your door.

1755
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:09,160
- What's his name?
- Andre Bryant.

1756
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:10,200
Andre.

1757
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:17,960
<i>Since my pop split, my mom can't even
look at me, 'cause I look like my dad.</i>

1758
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:20,160
<i>And with my brother in jail,</i>

1759
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:23,120
<i>she looks at me and thinks
that's where I'm going, too.</i>

1760
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:25,000
<i>She doesn't see me.</i>

1761
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:27,520
<i>She doesn't see me at all.</i>

1762
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:33,360
I'm going out.

1763
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:39,600
- What up?
- Hey.

1764
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:41,520
Where you going? I need you.

1765
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:44,760
No, man, I can't now.
I got something to do.

1766
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:46,440
Tonight. I'll do it tonight.

1767
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:49,520
I gotta go do something,
and I can't carry that around with me.

1768
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:51,680
Forget it, man, I'll get somebody else.

1769
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:53,760
I can't be waiting all day on you.

1770
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:55,440
Hey.

1771
01:55:56,840 --> 01:56:00,120
Sorry about your brother, man.
I hear he going away for life.

1772
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:02,720
They won't get it.
The guy he was with confessed.

1773
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:04,880
To who? Your brother?

1774
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:07,840
Hey. You Andre?

1775
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:20,280
- What up?
- Hey.

1776
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:28,200
- What?
- Put on your seat belt.

1777
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,160
You, too, young lady.

1778
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:38,960
You kids ever been
to Newport Beach before?

1779
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:42,640
What? We went there last year
on our way to Paris.

1780
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:50,040
Paris.

1781
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:55,200
It's good.

1782
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:57,120
I brought you something.

1783
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:03,600
It's a good book. I read it in school.

1784
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:07,320
It's about a gang kid,
and I thought you might like to read it.

1785
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:17,920
He told me what I had to say
when I'm on the stand.

1786
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:15,360
<i>At the beginning of the tour, they give
you a card with a child's picture on it.</i>

1787
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:18,560
<i>You could find out who they were
and what camp they were sent to.</i>

1788
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:22,320
<i>And at the end of the tour,
you could find out if they survived.</i>

1789
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:25,320
<i>I got a little girl from Italy.</i>

1790
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,080
Tito, your hat.

1791
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:13,320
<i>Kristallnacht, they called it.
The Night of Broken Glass.</i>

1792
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:15,640
<i>Hundreds of synagogues
looted and burned.</i>

1793
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:18,400
<i>More than 7,000
Jewish stores destroyed.</i>

1794
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:20,520
<i>Over 100 Jews killed.</i>

1795
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:37,960
<i>A small center for children in Isieux
in the French province of Ain.</i>

1796
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:41,400
<i>Among the children deported that day
to Birkenau</i>

1797
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:44,760
<i>was 11-year-old Liliane Berenstein,</i>

1798
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:48,600
<i>who, before leaving,
left behind a letter to God.</i>

1799
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:58,640
<i>My little boy died.
He got off the train and they killed him.</i>

1800
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:01,200
<i>I don't know why
it bothered me so much.</i>

1801
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:03,360
<i>I've seen death all my life.</i>

1802
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:08,080
<i>But this little boy was only five.</i>

1803
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:31,520
<i>Ms. G had a beautiful dinner for us
at the hotel where she works.</i>

1804
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:36,000
<i>She invited real Holocaust survivors
from the museum to meet us.</i>

1805
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:38,840
<i>There was Elisabeth Mann.</i>

1806
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:43,320
I had my parents,
my sister, my two brothers.

1807
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:45,000
<i>Gloria Ungar.</i>

1808
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:47,600
If any of you have seen someone
with a number on their arm,

1809
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:49,600
These were the lucky people.

1810
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:52,040
The people who,
when we came to Auschwitz,

1811
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:55,800
When they tattooed the people
they took us to do the slave work.

1812
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:59,360
Not the others,
and that included many of my family.

1813
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:01,640
So, we ran away,
some of the young kids.

1814
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:04,080
I was at that time
11-and-a-half years old.

1815
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:05,160
<i>Eddie llam.</i>

1816
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,160
And where to go, I didn't know,

1817
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:10,840
But I remember one place
where I used to live.

1818
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:13,240
So when I ran there,
there was not one Jew left.

1819
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:16,400
I was in the worst camp.
I was in Auschwitz.

1820
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:17,880
<i>And Renee Firestone.</i>

1821
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,720
When I arrived, my parents were
immediately taken away from me.

1822
02:01:22,160 --> 02:01:25,320
My little sister,
who was then 14 years old,

1823
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:27,960
Stayed with me for a little while.

1824
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:31,480
And then later on,
I was separated from her also.

1825
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:34,120
<i>She lost her whole family at the camps.</i>

1826
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:38,840
<i>She came to this country with $4
in her pocket and a newborn baby.</i>

1827
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:41,960
<i>I'll never forget these people.</i>

1828
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:44,760
And then she was killed
because they didn't want...

1829
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:47,640
<i>I can't believe Ms. G did all of this
for us.</i>

1830
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:56,400
<i>Hi, honey, it's me.</i>

1831
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:59,000
<i>Look, we're still at the restaurant,
if you wanted to drop by.</i>

1832
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:00,680
<i>We haven't even ordered dessert yet,</i>

1833
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:03,040
<i>and the kids are having
such an incredible time.</i>

1834
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:04,840
<i>You have to see them.</i>

1835
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:07,880
<i>If you get in soon, come by.
It's only 9:30 now.</i>

1836
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:13,480
<i>Okay, I'll see you later. Love you. Bye.</i>

1837
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:45,560
How many times
I gotta tell your ass again?

1838
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:47,720
Get your butt in here!

1839
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:21,080
So, you had all summer
to read and consider this book.

1840
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:28,640
And you know,
I thought it would be most valuable

1841
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:34,520
To begin with Victoria
to give us the black perspective.

1842
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,240
Victoria?

1843
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:39,920
<i>Do I have a stamp
on my forehead that says,</i>

1844
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:42,480
<i>"The National Spokesperson
for the Plight of Black People"?</i>

1845
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:45,760
<i>How the hell should I know the black
perspective on The Color Purple?</i>

1846
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:49,200
<i>That's it, if I don't change classes,
I'm gonna hurt this fool.</i>

1847
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,280
<i>Teachers treat me like
I'm some kind of Rosetta stone</i>

1848
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:52,760
<i>for African-Americans.</i>

1849
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:54,560
<i>What? Black people learn how to read,</i>

1850
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:57,240
<i>and we all miraculously come
to the same conclusion?</i>

1851
02:03:57,360 --> 02:04:00,800
<i>At that point, I decided to check out
my friend Brandy's English class.</i>

1852
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:02,320
- Good to see you, man.
- Hey, yeah.

1853
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:04,400
- How was your summer?
- Great.

1854
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:10,600
You're still white, I see.

1855
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:13,000
Okay, everybody. Ready?

1856
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:14,240
- Hey, Ms. G.
- Hi.

1857
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:15,640
- Hi, Ms. G.
- Hi.

1858
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:28,040
Okay, guys, gals, listen up!
This is what I want you to do.

1859
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:32,200
I want each of you to step forward
and take one of these Borders bags,

1860
02:04:32,280 --> 02:04:35,080
Which contain the four books
we're gonna read this semester.

1861
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:36,360
All right!

1862
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:39,280
They're very special books,

1863
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:43,640
And they each remind me,
in some way, of each of you.

1864
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:50,520
But, before you take the books,

1865
02:04:51,160 --> 02:04:54,800
I want you to take one of these glasses
of sparkling cider,

1866
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:58,520
And I want each of you to make a toast.

1867
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:03,120
We're each gonna make
a toast for change.

1868
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:07,920
And what that means is,
from this moment on

1869
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:13,600
Every voice that told you
"You can't" is silenced.

1870
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:19,760
Every reason that tells you things
will never change, disappears.

1871
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:24,560
And the person you were
before this moment,

1872
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:27,880
That person's turn is over.
Now it's your turn.

1873
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:30,040
Okay?

1874
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:34,880
Okay, you ready to get
this party going on?

1875
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:39,280
- What?
- Stop doing that, man.

1876
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:40,880
What's the dealio?

1877
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:51,720
Man, I've had boyfriends since I was,
like, 11, you know.

1878
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:55,040
- I believe you.
- Shut up.

1879
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:58,440
Okay, well, I was always the person

1880
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:01,880
That was gonna get pregnant
before I turned 16 and drop out.

1881
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:04,040
Like my mom.

1882
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:09,240
Ain't gonna happen.

1883
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:11,560
Nobody ever listens to a teenager.

1884
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:15,760
Everybody thinks you should be happy
just because you're young.

1885
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:18,760
They don't see the wars
that we fight every single day.

1886
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:21,240
And one day, my war will end.

1887
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:23,400
And I will not die.

1888
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:28,120
And I will not tolerate abuse
from anyone.

1889
02:06:31,480 --> 02:06:32,760
I am strong.

1890
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:35,960
My moms kicked me out
when I got jumped into the gang life.

1891
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:39,320
But I'd like her to see me graduate.

1892
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:42,560
I'd like to be 18.

1893
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:50,080
Ms. G?
Can I read something from my diary?

1894
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:51,600
That'd be great.

1895
02:06:55,400 --> 02:06:57,000
Who is he?

1896
02:06:57,120 --> 02:06:59,120
Man, he's been with us
from freshman year, fool.

1897
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:02,040
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

1898
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:07,840
"This summer was the worst summer
in my short 14 years of life.

1899
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:10,640
"It all started with a phone call.

1900
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:13,400
"My mother was crying and begging,

1901
02:07:13,480 --> 02:07:18,240
"asking for more time as if she were
gasping for her last breath of air.

1902
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:22,160
"She held me as tight
as she could and cried.

1903
02:07:22,240 --> 02:07:27,480
"Her tears hit my shirt like bullets
and told me we were being evicted.

1904
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:31,640
"She kept apologizing to me.
I thought, 'I have no home.

1905
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:35,400
"'I should have asked for something
less expensive at Christmas. '

1906
02:07:35,480 --> 02:07:39,200
"On the morning of the eviction,
a hard knock on the door woke me up.

1907
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:41,840
"The sheriff was there to do his job.

1908
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:46,080
"I looked up at the sky,
waiting for something to happen.

1909
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:51,280
"My mother has no family to lean on,
no money coming in.

1910
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:55,320
"Why bother coming to school
or getting good grades if I'm homeless?

1911
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:59,640
"The bus stops in front of the school.
I feel like throwing up.

1912
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:04,320
"I'm wearing clothes from last year,
some old shoes and no new haircut.

1913
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:07,280
"I kept thinking I'd get laughed at.

1914
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:09,680
"Instead, I'm greeted
by a couple of friends

1915
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:12,000
"who were in my English class last year.

1916
02:08:12,120 --> 02:08:14,880
"And it hits me, Mrs. Gruwell,

1917
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,160
"my crazy English teacher
from last year,

1918
02:08:17,240 --> 02:08:19,800
"is the only person
that made me think of hope.

1919
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:24,160
"Talking with friends
about last year's English and our trips,

1920
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:26,200
"I began to feel better.

1921
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:31,560
"I receive my schedule and the first
teacher is Mrs. Gruwell in Room 203.

1922
02:08:31,880 --> 02:08:34,840
"I walk into the room and feel as though

1923
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:38,360
"all the problems in life
are not so important anymore.

1924
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,400
"I am home. "

1925
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:43,720
Yes, you are.

1926
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:05,240
But you're an honors student.

1927
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:06,840
If you transfer to Ms. Gruwell's class,

1928
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,920
Think how that will reflect
on your records.

1929
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:12,120
It doesn't matter to me.
My grades will still be the same.

1930
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:14,200
Look, Ms. Campbell.

1931
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:17,760
When I first transferred to the school,
I had a 4.0 average.

1932
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:21,400
But when I applied for advanced
placement at English and Math,

1933
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:24,320
I was told it would be better for me
to be in a class with my own kind.

1934
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:27,240
Now, when I did get in, my teacher said,

1935
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:30,800
"Victoria, it's not every day one finds
an African-American student

1936
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:34,640
"in A. P. And honors courses. "
As if I didn't notice.

1937
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:37,040
And when I asked
another honors teacher

1938
02:09:37,160 --> 02:09:39,680
Why we don't read more
black literature, she said,

1939
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:41,840
"We don't read black literature
because of all the sex,

1940
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:44,040
"drugs, cussing and fornication!"

1941
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:50,520
I thought a simple "It's inappropriate"
would have sufficed.

1942
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:56,440
Erin can't do that!

1943
02:09:56,680 --> 02:09:59,000
Distinguished Honor Students are mine.

1944
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:01,960
She's not allowed to teach them.
She's only been here a year.

1945
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,520
The student requested it.

1946
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:06,120
And Gruwell has got Cohn
in her back pocket.

1947
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:12,080
What gets me is they're violent, they
break laws, they destroy school property

1948
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:17,120
And in the end we make them special.
We reward them like...

1949
02:10:17,160 --> 02:10:19,400
I just don't see what that teaches them.

1950
02:10:20,120 --> 02:10:22,400
Hi! Sorry I'm late.

1951
02:10:22,760 --> 02:10:24,760
Did you eat? I'm ordering in.
Are you hungry?

1952
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:26,680
What question do you want me
to answer first?

1953
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:29,560
Did I eat or am I hungry?
I ate. I'm not hungry.

1954
02:10:29,640 --> 02:10:32,760
Something really cool happened today.
I got an honors student.

1955
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:34,680
- Congratulations.
- Isn't that great?

1956
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:36,640
She actually requested my class.

1957
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:38,640
Can you teach an honors student?

1958
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:39,960
What do you mean?

1959
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:42,760
Well, I mean, you're used
to teaching your kind of kids.

1960
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:45,240
Can you teach somebody who's smart?

1961
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:46,960
Of course I can.

1962
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:48,920
Yeah, but it's not like you have, right?

1963
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:52,080
I mean, you don't really teach
what everybody else teaches.

1964
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:55,240
My kids' grades are up to B's.

1965
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:57,720
Yeah, but the point is,
that's according to you.

1966
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:00,520
It's not like they're really learning
what normal kids have to learn.

1967
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:02,360
Normal kids? Yes, they are.

1968
02:11:02,440 --> 02:11:03,880
<i>They're reading
The Diary of Anne Frank.</i>

1969
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:06,240
They're learning vocabulary,
grammar, writing, poetry.

1970
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:08,560
All right. Okay, I apologize. Sorry.

1971
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:10,960
Congratulations.

1972
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:19,720
What is wrong with you?

1973
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:21,760
You know, at Deb's party,
I heard you telling people

1974
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:24,160
That I was an architect
and that my job was temporary.

1975
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:27,160
I want you to stop that, all right?
I like my job.

1976
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:28,320
Fine.

1977
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:31,280
You're the one who said
you were gonna be an architect.

1978
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:33,320
Yeah, four years ago,
before we got married.

1979
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:34,960
What, I'm gonna go back to school now

1980
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:36,880
For two years and intern for three?

1981
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:38,400
I'll be over 40.

1982
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:40,440
All right. I thought you still wanted it.

1983
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:44,400
It doesn't matter if I want it, Erin.
It doesn't mean it's going to happen.

1984
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:47,720
Why not?

Eva.

2031

If she dies, then what about me?
What are you saying about that?

2032
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:30,720
- Anne Frank died, but she...
- I can't believe they got her!

2033
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:33,360
That ain't supposed to happen
in the story! That ain't right!

02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:35,120
- 'Cause it's true?
- I ain't talking to you!

2035
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:37,800
You're talking around me.
That's the same thing.

2036
02:14:37,880 --> 02:14:39,640
See, to me, she ain't dead at all.

2037
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:42,320
How many friends did you know
that are dead now that got killed?

2038
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:43,760
Too many to count.

2039
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:46,200
How many have you read a book about?

2040
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:49,280
Have you seen them on TV
or even in the newspaper?

2041
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:50,920
That's why this story's dope.

2042
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,720
She was our age, man.

2043
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:56,200
Anne Frank understands our situation,
my situation.

2044
02:14:56,280 --> 02:14:59,120
And that Miep Gies lady,
the one that helped hide them?

2045
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:00,400
I like her.

2046
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:02,840
I got all these other books
about her from the library.

2047
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:05,680
Wow. You used your library card?

2048
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:08,560
No.

2049
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:15,280
Okay, listen up.
Marcus has given me an idea.

2050
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:19,120
<i>Instead of doing a book report on
The Diary of Anne Frank,</i>

2051
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:23,040
For our assignment I want you
to write a letter to Miep Gies,

2052
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:25,320
The woman who helped shelter
the Franks.

2053
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:28,720
She's still alive and she lives in Europe.

2054
02:15:28,840 --> 02:15:31,480
In the letter, I want you to tell her
how you feel about the book.

2055
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:34,000
Tell her about your own experiences.
Tell her anything you like.

2056
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:36,160
But I want the letters to be perfect,

2057
02:15:36,280 --> 02:15:38,600
So be prepared to do more
than one draft, okay?

2058
02:15:38,680 --> 02:15:40,120
Is she gonna read the letters?

2059
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:42,520
Well, right now it's
a writing assignment. I'll read them.

2060
02:15:42,680 --> 02:15:44,160
We should get her to read them.

2061
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:47,240
- Yeah, you can do that, right, Ms. G?
- Well, I don't know.

2062
02:15:47,320 --> 02:15:48,600
Maybe we should get her
to come and speak.

2063
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:50,480
Yeah, and have a big dinner again.

2064
02:15:52,160 --> 02:15:53,920
Wait. Guys.

2065
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:00,440
Guys! Everyone! Listen! She's elderly!

2066
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:02,920
I don't know how to contact her.
I don't even know if she travels.

2067
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,560
And it would be really expensive.

2068
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:06,320
We could raise the money.

2069
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:08,240
Ms. G?

2070
02:16:08,320 --> 02:16:12,120
When Miep Gies come,
can I, like, be the one to escort her in?

2071
02:16:31,160 --> 02:16:32,400
Five.

2072
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:46,640
Hi, I'm trying to get the number

2073
02:16:46,720 --> 02:16:49,120
For the Anne Frank Foundation
in Basel, Switzerland.

2074
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:02,320
Come in, Margaret.

2075
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:49,720
<i>Ms. G sent our letters all the way
to Amsterdam</i>

2076
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:51,560
<i>to Miep Gies, herself.</i>

2077
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:53,840
<i>When Ms. G made up her mind
about something,</i>

2078
02:18:53,960 --> 02:18:56,360
<i>there was no stopping her,
man, for real.</i>

2079
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:07,320
<i>And after we raised the money to bring
her to Long Beach, there she was.</i>

2080
02:19:09,640 --> 02:19:13,280
<i>But, damn,
I didn't expect her to be so small.</i>

2081
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:34,560
The bounty on a Jew was about $2.

2082
02:19:35,400 --> 02:19:38,520
Someone desperate for money
told the Gestapo.

2083
02:19:38,560 --> 02:19:42,280
On August 4th,
they stormed into my office,

2084
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:49,080
And a man pointed a gun at
me and said, "Not a sound.

2085
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:51,120
"Not one word. "

2086
02:19:52,200 --> 02:19:54,720
And then they went straight upstairs
to the attic.

2087
02:19:55,240 --> 02:19:57,560
I felt so helpless.

2088
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:00,120
I could hear Anne screaming,
objects being thrown around.

2089
02:20:00,280 --> 02:20:02,880
So, I ran back to my house.

2090
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,640
I looked for an earring
or knick-knacks, you know,

2091
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:08,400
Anything I could take back with me
to bribe them.

2092
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:11,680
So I took this back with me,
all these things,

2093
02:20:11,800 --> 02:20:15,920
And the soldier there took out his gun

2094
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:18,640
And put it against my head.

2095
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:27,440
You could be shot for hiding a Jew
or go to a camp.

2096
02:20:28,120 --> 02:20:31,920
So, another soldier
recognized my accent.

2097
02:20:32,120 --> 02:20:35,640
He was Austrian, and so was I,

2098
02:20:36,080 --> 02:20:38,720
But I had been adopted
by a Dutch family.

2099
02:20:38,840 --> 02:20:42,480
So, he told the soldier with the gun
to let me go.

2100
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:48,640
There isn't a day
that I don't remember August 4th

2101
02:20:49,880 --> 02:20:53,560
And I think about Anne Frank.

2102
02:20:56,040 --> 02:20:57,080
Yes?

2103
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:06,640
I've never had a hero before.

2104
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:08,920
But you are my hero.

2105
02:21:09,400 --> 02:21:12,920
Oh, no. No, no, young man, no.

2106
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:15,600
I am not a hero. No.

2107
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:22,000
I did what I had to do,
because it was the right thing to do.

2108
02:21:22,360 --> 02:21:23,720
That is all.

2109
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:28,400
You know, we are all ordinary people.

2110
02:21:29,080 --> 02:21:35,640
But even an ordinary secretary
or a housewife or a teenager

2111
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:42,640
Can, within their own small ways,
turn on a small light

2112
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:46,760
In a dark room.

2113
02:21:47,320 --> 02:21:48,400
<i>Ja?</i>

2114
02:21:52,440 --> 02:21:55,880
I have read your letters,

2115
02:21:55,960 --> 02:22:00,560
And your teacher has been telling me
many things about your experiences.

2116
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:05,280
You are the heroes.

2117
02:22:06,520 --> 02:22:10,000
You are heroes every day.

2118
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:19,920
Your faces are engraved in my heart.

2119
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:40,120
You hungry?

2120
02:22:44,360 --> 02:22:47,000
You know what you're gonna say
in that courtroom?

2121
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:49,520
I know what I have to say.

2122
02:22:51,160 --> 02:22:52,200
Yeah.

2123
02:22:52,840 --> 02:22:55,000
- You know how that is.
- I know.

2124
02:22:56,320 --> 02:22:58,840
And that man that put your father
in prison,

2125
02:22:58,960 --> 02:23:01,520
He knew he was sending
an innocent man.

2126
02:23:01,880 --> 02:23:03,120
But, you know,

2127
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:06,480
He was just

2128
02:23:08,480 --> 02:23:10,160
Protecting his own.

2129
02:23:16,120 --> 02:23:18,680
What the hell does everybody
want from me?

2130
02:23:44,400 --> 02:23:46,280
Hey, Mama. Mama.

2131
02:23:51,640 --> 02:23:53,960
What the hell are you doing here?

2132
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:03,800
I want to come home.
I don't want to be in the streets no more.

2133
02:24:03,880 --> 02:24:05,120
I'm sorry.

2134
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:10,520
I want to change. I can't do it alone.

2135
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:13,920
I need you, Mama.

2136
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:17,080
I need you.

2137
02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:54,880
And what time was that?

2138
02:24:55,720 --> 02:24:57,920
I told you, 9:00, 9:30.

2139
02:24:58,560 --> 02:24:59,960
And you had a clear view
of the defendant,

2140
02:25:00,080 --> 02:25:01,840
Grant Rice, in the store?

2141
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,280
I told you he was playing
the video game.

2142
02:25:05,880 --> 02:25:08,240
Then what happened?
What did you see?

2143
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:10,640
Well, he got all whacked
because he lost the game,

2144
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:14,240
And then he started shouting and all,
threatening everybody.

2145
02:25:14,360 --> 02:25:17,400
He threatened everyone?
He threatened you?

2146
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:20,800
No. The guy who ran the store.

2147
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:22,880
He wanted his money back
for the game.

2148
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:24,880
And what did the store owner do?

2149
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:28,840
He shouted back.
And they were fighting.

2150
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:33,200
Then he, the defendant, knocked
something over and left the store.

2151
02:25:33,720 --> 02:25:36,120
And then what happened?
What did you see?

2152
02:25:40,120 --> 02:25:41,680
I saw...

2153
02:25:53,400 --> 02:25:54,800
I saw...

2154
02:26:09,440 --> 02:26:10,840
Paco did it.

2155
02:26:14,840 --> 02:26:16,520
Paco killed the guy.

2156
02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:41,040
My father won't talk to me anymore.

2157
02:27:43,320 --> 02:27:48,440
And I have to lay low for a little while
because there's word out to jump me.

2158
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:52,000
So I'm gonna be living with my aunt.

2159
02:27:53,400 --> 02:27:58,160
See, my aunt lives even further away,

2160
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:04,280
So I was just wondering if I could, like,

2161
02:28:07,320 --> 02:28:09,000
Stay here late with you

2162
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:10,720
Stay here late with you

2163
02:28:12,520 --> 02:28:16,840
So I can get my homework done,
'cause it's late by the time I get home.

2164
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:22,040
You can stay as late as you want.

2165
02:28:23,360 --> 02:28:27,160
And I can even drive you to your aunt's,
if it gets too late.

2166
02:28:30,280 --> 02:28:32,040
Ms. G, let's not get nuts.

2167
02:29:06,360 --> 02:29:08,200
I think I got your color.

2168
02:29:52,960 --> 02:29:54,880
Just come by the concierge
on your way out,

2169
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,640
I'll have the directions for you.
Yep, that's fine.

2170
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:08,040
Stop! That's it! Now, now! Hey!

2171
02:30:09,720 --> 02:30:12,080
You get an extra three seconds. Go!

2172
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,160
<i>... enraged them and provoked them
into acts of violence.</i>

2173
02:30:20,280 --> 02:30:24,360
<i>In 1961, an interracial civil rights group
traveled by bus through the South</i>

2174
02:30:24,440 --> 02:30:26,120
<i>to challenge segregation.</i>

2175
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:28,960
<i>Blacks sat in the front,
whites in the back.</i>

2176
02:30:29,400 --> 02:30:32,800
<i>They were attacked, firebombed,
but they kept going.</i>

2177
02:30:33,400 --> 02:30:37,360
<i>In Montgomery, Alabama, Jim Zwerg
offered to be the first off the bus,</i>

2178
02:30:37,480 --> 02:30:39,760
<i>knowing there was a mob
waiting for them.</i>

2179
02:30:39,880 --> 02:30:42,720
<i>He was almost beaten to death
so the others could get away.</i>

2180
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:46,160
<i>That kind of courage
is unbelievable to me.</i>

2181
02:30:46,320 --> 02:30:49,520
<i>I was afraid of just being in this class,
and I was ashamed</i>

2182
02:30:49,640 --> 02:30:53,240
<i>because I've always been the dumb kid
in school, even with my friends.</i>

2183
02:30:53,400 --> 02:30:54,720
<i>But not anymore.</i>

2184
02:30:54,880 --> 02:30:56,360
<i>And I must have some kind of courage,</i>

2185
02:30:56,440 --> 02:31:00,040
<i>because I could have lied
to get out of here, but I stayed.</i>

2186
02:31:01,080 --> 02:31:02,320
<i>I stayed.</i>

2187
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:03,960
Hi, I'm home!

2188
02:31:04,560 --> 02:31:09,280
Sorry, it got late. I drove the kids home.
I didn't want them taking buses.

2189
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:12,080
You're never gonna believe
what happened.

2190
02:31:13,400 --> 02:31:14,960
I'm so tired.

2191
02:31:15,480 --> 02:31:18,200
It's so cute, though.
They never want to go home.

2192
02:31:18,840 --> 02:31:21,960
We have such a good time together.
I'm gonna take a shower.

2193
02:31:40,760 --> 02:31:43,760
If you have another glass,
you're gonna have a headache.

2194
02:31:44,480 --> 02:31:48,720
Your bags are packed and you think
the wine's gonna give me a headache?

2195
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:52,320
Why are you doing this?

2196
02:31:52,440 --> 02:31:55,560
Because I don't
pay enough attention to you?

2197
02:31:55,640 --> 02:31:57,560
No. That's not it.

2198
02:31:59,800 --> 02:32:03,720
I just... I feel like I'm living a life
I just did not agree to.

2199
02:32:05,960 --> 02:32:07,520
Erin, it's just...

2200
02:32:08,720 --> 02:32:10,120
It's too hard.

2201
02:32:10,720 --> 02:32:12,800
Your life is too hard?

2202
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:15,720
I think what you're doing is noble.

2203
02:32:16,280 --> 02:32:19,720
And it's good. And I'm proud of you.

2204
02:32:20,280 --> 02:32:21,520
I am.

2205
02:32:23,800 --> 02:32:26,960
I just want to live my life
and not feel bad about it.

2206
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:30,080
- I'm not trying to make you feel bad.
- You don't have to try.

2207
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:32,880
I didn't plan on becoming responsible
for these kids.

2208
02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:34,920
- Well, who asked you to?
- No one asked me to!

2209
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:35,960
They're not even your kids!

2210
02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:39,720
Why do I have to be asked? Scott...

2211
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:48,400
I finally realized what I'm
supposed to be doing and I love it.

2212
02:32:48,520 --> 02:32:53,000
When I'm helping these kids
make sense of their lives,

2213
02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:56,320
Everything about my life
makes sense to me.

2214
02:32:59,720 --> 02:33:02,000
How often does a person get that?

2215
02:33:05,160 --> 02:33:09,080
- Then what do you need me for?
- You're my husband.

2216
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:13,880
Why can't you stand by me and be part
of it, the way wives support husbands?

2217
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:15,760
Because I can't be your wife.

2218
02:33:22,800 --> 02:33:25,000
I wish I could make that
sound less awful.

2219
02:33:27,080 --> 02:33:28,200
Erin?

2220
02:33:29,720 --> 02:33:32,200
You know,
if you had to choose between us

2221
02:33:33,640 --> 02:33:35,200
And the class,

2222
02:33:36,920 --> 02:33:38,320
Who would you pick?

2223
02:33:40,280 --> 02:33:43,560
If you love me,
how could you ever ask me that?

2224
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:46,080
Erin, look at me.

2225
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:51,520
This is all there's ever been to me.

2226
02:33:51,880 --> 02:33:56,080
This is it. I'm not one of those kids.
I don't have any more potential.

2227
02:33:57,840 --> 02:33:59,280
See? You don't want to be here either,

2228
02:33:59,440 --> 02:34:02,640
'cause if you did, would you be
in the classroom every night?

2229
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:08,360
That's not true. I want to be here.
I love you.

2230
02:34:09,480 --> 02:34:11,360
You love the idea of me.

2231
02:34:16,680 --> 02:34:18,880
But it's such a great idea.

2232
02:34:22,400 --> 02:34:23,640
I know.

2233
02:34:50,560 --> 02:34:52,280
Dad? Hi.

2234
02:34:54,800 --> 02:34:57,840
You know, I was actually trying
to call someone else,

2235
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:59,880
And I automatically dialed you. I'm sorry.

2236
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:02,360
Look, I'm gonna call you tomorrow,
okay?

2237
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:05,680
I need to make this call. I love you.

2238
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:20,560
<i>Ms. G made us read Twelve Angry Men.</i>

2239
02:35:20,680 --> 02:35:24,160
<i>It's all about how this one juror
helped to turn the hearts of 11 jurors.</i>

2240
02:35:24,200 --> 02:35:25,960
<i>It made me feel hopeful.</i>

2241
02:35:26,480 --> 02:35:29,600
<i>At 2:00 today, my brother
was given a verdict on his own trial.</i>

2242
02:35:29,720 --> 02:35:32,240
<i>No O. J. Dream Team,
just a court-appointed attorney</i>

2243
02:35:32,400 --> 02:35:34,280
<i>who probably thought
his ass was guilty.</i>

2244
02:35:34,400 --> 02:35:37,880
<i>And I realized Twelve Angry Men
was just a book and nothing more.</i>

2245
02:35:38,200 --> 02:35:40,840
<i>My brother got 15 years to life.</i>

2246
02:35:40,920 --> 02:35:43,560
<i>Justice don't mean
the bad guy goes to jail.</i>

2247
02:35:43,640 --> 02:35:45,760
<i>It just means somebody
pays for the crime.</i>

2248
02:35:51,360 --> 02:35:52,840
So, you got time now?

2249
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:00,960
Anyone know where Andre's been?

2250
02:36:01,080 --> 02:36:02,320
I haven't seen him on the bus.

2251
02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:03,840
Yeah, I haven't talked to him either.

2252
02:36:12,400 --> 02:36:13,840
Ms. G?

2253
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:16,440
Are we gonna have
this same room next year, again?

2254
02:36:16,560 --> 02:36:19,560
I don't know.
You're gonna be juniors next year.

2255
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:22,480
What do you mean?

2256
02:36:22,600 --> 02:36:25,200
Well, I teach freshman
and sophomore years.

2257
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:28,280
You mean,
we're not gonna be with you next year?

2258
02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:32,200
Well, I...

2259
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:37,560
I don't teach juniors.
I thought you guys understood that.

2260
02:36:38,040 --> 02:36:39,120
What? What are you talking about?

2261
02:36:41,240 --> 02:36:42,800
You don't wanna be our teacher
next year?

2262
02:36:42,920 --> 02:36:45,320
Of course I do. I can't.

2263
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:47,840
- Why not?
- It's the Board of Ed.

2264
02:36:47,960 --> 02:36:49,800
It's regulations.

2265
02:36:52,440 --> 02:36:55,120
Ms. G hasn't been here long enough
to have seniority.

2266
02:36:55,160 --> 02:36:56,400
Who cares about seniority?

2267
02:36:56,560 --> 02:36:59,000
Shit! They can't do that!
They don't have the right!

2268
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:03,720
- Ms. G, this is our kick-it spot.
- Yeah.

2269
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:07,160
Everybody's cool with everybody.
Everybody knows everybody.

2270
02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:10,560
This is the only place
where we really get to be ourselves.

2271
02:37:10,680 --> 02:37:12,640
There's no place like this
out there for us.

2272
02:37:12,920 --> 02:37:14,240
That's true.

2273
02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:17,200
I'm not allowed
to teach junior and seniors.

2274
02:37:17,320 --> 02:37:18,240
You're not allowed?

2275
02:37:20,200 --> 02:37:23,680
Ms. G, we can fight this, you know,
like the Freedom Riders.

2276
02:37:23,800 --> 02:37:25,480
Yeah, yeah,
we'll all drive around on a bus.

2277
02:37:25,560 --> 02:37:27,480
Only this time, they try and bust us up,

2278
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:29,320
We bust a few of them
board members' heads.

2279
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:30,880
Marcus.

2280
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:34,480
Or we can go to the newspapers,
media. That'll get their attention.

2281
02:37:34,680 --> 02:37:36,120
Or we can paint
the administration building

2282
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:38,600
With the word "assholes"
in various colors.

2283
02:37:40,280 --> 02:37:41,880
Hey, it's something. We can do this.

2284
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:48,040
What?

2285
02:37:48,120 --> 02:37:51,560
These are my books, not Scott's.
I'm packing the wrong books.

2286
02:37:51,640 --> 02:37:53,280
Honey, take a break.

2287
02:37:57,080 --> 02:37:58,480
Sit down.

2288
02:38:01,520 --> 02:38:04,000
I can't believe I'm getting divorced.

2289
02:38:05,400 --> 02:38:07,760
I never thought this would happen.

2290
02:38:11,560 --> 02:38:13,560
What do I do now?

2291
02:38:14,520 --> 02:38:16,880
Next year, I won't even have my kids.

2292
02:38:17,240 --> 02:38:19,440
You think you should stay with them?

2293
02:38:20,280 --> 02:38:22,480
Or is it better they move on?

2294
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:24,240
I don't know.

2295
02:38:27,880 --> 02:38:30,240
It's just a job, like you said.

2296
02:38:30,360 --> 02:38:31,920
Yeah, it is.

2297
02:38:32,800 --> 02:38:34,680
But is the job finished?

2298
02:38:36,920 --> 02:38:38,480
Listen to me now.

2299
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:41,160
What you've done with those kids...

2300
02:38:43,480 --> 02:38:45,680
I don't even have words for it.

2301
02:38:47,320 --> 02:38:52,080
But one thing's for sure,
you are an amazing teacher.

2302
02:38:53,880 --> 02:38:55,200
Special.

2303
02:38:55,960 --> 02:39:00,160
You have been blessed with a burden,
my daughter.

2304
02:39:02,040 --> 02:39:03,960
And I envy you that.

2305
02:39:06,520 --> 02:39:08,080
And I admire you.

2306
02:39:10,520 --> 02:39:14,320
And how many fathers ever get
to say that to their daughters

2307
02:39:14,480 --> 02:39:16,360
And really mean it?

2308
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:23,040
What she is suggesting
is in violation of our union charter.

2309
02:39:23,160 --> 02:39:26,160
She may not move on with her students
to teach them junior year.

2310
02:39:26,280 --> 02:39:28,200
She's only been here two years.

2311
02:39:28,280 --> 02:39:30,320
There are teachers here
who have tenure,

2312
02:39:30,400 --> 02:39:32,560
Who have worked and committed
themselves for far longer

2313
02:39:32,680 --> 02:39:34,520
To attain a position of seniority.

2314
02:39:34,600 --> 02:39:38,400
Not to mention their experience
in teaching students of a higher caliber.

2315
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:41,200
The Distinguished Scholars Program
is under our jurisdiction.

2316
02:39:41,360 --> 02:39:44,000
I don't want to replace
the Distinguished Scholars Program.

2317
02:39:44,120 --> 02:39:45,960
I just want to stay
with my kids next year.

2318
02:39:46,040 --> 02:39:48,160
She can't. I have the juniors.

2319
02:39:48,240 --> 02:39:50,160
The Board of Education
will not allow this.

2320
02:39:50,320 --> 02:39:52,160
Teaching rotations will be disrupted,

2321
02:39:52,280 --> 02:39:54,480
Retirement schedules
will be reevaluated,

2322
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:57,880
Disrespecting teachers
who have earned their way far longer

2323
02:39:57,960 --> 02:40:00,040
And who focus on the classroom,

2324
02:40:00,120 --> 02:40:02,840
Not on public relations
and newspaper articles.

2325
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:04,840
I didn't ask for those articles
to be written.

2326
02:40:04,960 --> 02:40:06,400
She's in the middle of a divorce.

2327
02:40:06,520 --> 02:40:08,880
Note, they stay late in her class,
they're eating, they're playing games!

2328
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,960
All right, let's all just take a breath here.
All right?

2329
02:40:13,360 --> 02:40:15,360
Now I had hoped
that we could talk this out,

2330
02:40:15,480 --> 02:40:17,120
Maybe come to some kind
of arrangement.

2331
02:40:17,240 --> 02:40:19,640
- There is no arrangement...
- Margaret.

2332
02:40:20,440 --> 02:40:21,880
Carl, look.

2333
02:40:22,440 --> 02:40:25,360
Putting aside all obvious resentments
for the moment,

2334
02:40:25,480 --> 02:40:26,800
Even if an arrangement were made

2335
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:30,880
And she could teach them as juniors,
there isn't an accredited course

2336
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,240
In the curriculum for her to teach.

2337
02:40:33,880 --> 02:40:37,360
Unless Brian trades one of his
junior classes for a sophomore.

2338
02:40:37,480 --> 02:40:38,480
No.

2339
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:42,320
Then there's nothing I can do.

2340
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:46,960
So that's it?

2341
02:40:48,080 --> 02:40:49,480
Believe it or not, Ms. Gruwell,

2342
02:40:49,560 --> 02:40:52,200
There are other capable teachers
in this school.

2343
02:40:52,320 --> 02:40:54,240
If you've made the progress
you say you have,

2344
02:40:54,360 --> 02:40:55,960
Your students should be ready
to move on.

2345
02:40:56,080 --> 02:40:58,640
They might even gain something
from more experienced teachers.

2346
02:40:58,720 --> 02:41:01,840
You can't teach them.
You don't even like them.

2347
02:41:01,960 --> 02:41:03,720
What does that have to do
with teaching?

2348
02:41:03,800 --> 02:41:06,320
I've been an educator for over 30 years.

2349
02:41:06,680 --> 02:41:08,320
I have students that still remain
in touch with me.

2350
02:41:08,440 --> 02:41:10,760
I know what it is to be loved
by a classroom!

2351
02:41:10,840 --> 02:41:13,720
You have no idea
how many battles I've had

2352
02:41:13,800 --> 02:41:15,400
Fighting to be a better teacher,

2353
02:41:15,480 --> 02:41:18,720
And now, what, suddenly I'm incapable
of educating your students?

2354
02:41:18,840 --> 02:41:21,360
You know, if they move on
to our classes and they fail,

2355
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:23,480
It'll be because they weren't prepared!

2356
02:41:23,640 --> 02:41:26,200
Lt'll be because you failed, not them!

2357
02:41:44,040 --> 02:41:46,600
Andre? Wait a minute before you go in.

2358
02:41:59,320 --> 02:42:01,680
I heard about your brother's conviction.
I'm sorry.

2359
02:42:01,800 --> 02:42:03,920
Is that why you've missed class
so much?

2360
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,720
I had things to do.

2361
02:42:08,880 --> 02:42:10,600
About this.

2362
02:42:11,040 --> 02:42:12,160
The evaluation assignment

2363
02:42:12,280 --> 02:42:13,680
Was to grade yourself
on the work you're doing.

2364
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:16,120
You gave yourself an F.
What's that about?

2365
02:42:16,480 --> 02:42:19,560
- It's what I feel I deserve. That's all.
- Oh, really?

2366
02:42:21,080 --> 02:42:22,680
You know what this is?

2367
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:26,800
This is a "Fuck you" to me,
and everyone in this class!

2368
02:42:26,960 --> 02:42:30,080
I don't want excuses.
I know what you're up against.

2369
02:42:30,400 --> 02:42:32,560
We're all of us up against something.

2370
02:42:33,480 --> 02:42:36,720
So you better make up your mind,
because until you have the balls

2371
02:42:36,800 --> 02:42:39,480
To look me straight in the eye
and tell me this is all you deserve,

2372
02:42:39,600 --> 02:42:41,080
I am not letting you fail,

2373
02:42:41,120 --> 02:42:43,120
Even if that means coming
to your house every night

2374
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:44,840
Until you finish the work.

2375
02:42:44,920 --> 02:42:46,640
I see who you are.

2376
02:42:47,160 --> 02:42:49,200
Do you understand me?

2377
02:42:50,200 --> 02:42:52,080
I can see you.

2378
02:42:53,880 --> 02:42:55,720
And you are not failing.

2379
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:03,760
So, take a minute.
Pull yourself together and come inside.

2380
02:43:04,280 --> 02:43:06,200
I want a new evaluation.

2381
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:13,880
An F. What, are you tripping?

2382
02:43:19,320 --> 02:43:22,640
I want you all to know that
Dr. Cohn and I tried very hard.

2383
02:43:25,320 --> 02:43:28,080
But it's been decided we can't continue
with each other junior year.

2384
02:43:28,200 --> 02:43:29,240
- What?
- What?

2385
02:43:30,840 --> 02:43:32,640
You... Wait.

2386
02:43:33,360 --> 02:43:35,240
Wait. Guys. Everyone.

2387
02:43:36,600 --> 02:43:38,960
No! That don't fly, Ma!

2388
02:43:40,440 --> 02:43:43,960
Look, first of all,
I'm not anyone's mother in here, okay?

2389
02:43:44,080 --> 02:43:46,160
No, it doesn't mean mother.

2390
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:49,080
It's a sign of respect for you.

2391
02:44:02,720 --> 02:44:04,080
Listen to me.

2392
02:44:04,280 --> 02:44:05,520
All of you.

2393
02:44:06,280 --> 02:44:10,720
Don't use me as another excuse
for why you can't make it.

2394
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:15,720
You made it to your junior year.

2395
02:44:16,480 --> 02:44:19,160
Think about how you did that.

2396
02:44:20,480 --> 02:44:24,000
Everyone in this room
has a chance to graduate.

2397
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,440
For some,
you'll be the first in your family.

2398
02:44:27,560 --> 02:44:30,200
The first with a choice to go to college.

2399
02:44:31,160 --> 02:44:33,840
Some may move faster than others.

2400
02:44:35,400 --> 02:44:37,600
But you'll each have the chance.

2401
02:44:38,640 --> 02:44:41,480
And you did that. Not me.

2402
02:44:48,280 --> 02:44:51,760
Now, I have one

2403
02:44:53,720 --> 02:44:55,280
Final project in mind.

2404
02:44:55,360 --> 02:44:57,480
- Ms. G.
- Yeah?

2405
02:44:59,240 --> 02:45:04,000
<i>Ms. G wanted us to put our diaries
together in a book, just like Anne Frank.</i>

2406
02:45:04,720 --> 02:45:06,640
<i>She got this businessman, John Tu,</i>

2407
02:45:06,800 --> 02:45:09,520
<i>to donate 35 computers
so we could work.</i>

2408
02:45:14,360 --> 02:45:17,640
<i>She told us we have something
to say to people.</i>

2409
02:45:17,800 --> 02:45:18,960
<i>We weren't just kids
in a class anymore.</i>

2410
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:20,080
<i>We weren't just kids
in a class anymore.</i>

2411
02:45:20,200 --> 02:45:23,760
<i>We were writers with our own voices,
our own stories.</i>

2412
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:25,840
<i>And even if nobody else read it,</i>

2413
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:29,360
<i>the book would be something
to leave behind that said we were here,</i>

2414
02:45:29,960 --> 02:45:32,920
<i>this is what happened, we mattered.</i>

2415
02:45:33,400 --> 02:45:37,480
<i>Even if it was just to each other.
And we won't forget.</i>

2416
02:45:39,120 --> 02:45:41,360
<i>Ms. G didn't promise
it would get published or anything,</i>

2417
02:45:41,480 --> 02:45:44,240
<i>but we could get it out there ourselves.</i>

2418
02:45:44,920 --> 02:45:47,080
<i>She asked us to come up with a title,</i>

2419
02:45:47,600 --> 02:45:49,480
<i>something to call ourselves.</i>

2420
02:46:06,520 --> 02:46:08,320
I just received a call
from Karin Polacheck

2421
02:46:08,440 --> 02:46:09,520
At the Board of Education.

2422
02:46:09,640 --> 02:46:11,560
There's to be a meeting
with Dr. Cohn about your classes.

2423
02:46:11,680 --> 02:46:15,000
- Do you know anything about this?
- No.

2424
02:46:22,480 --> 02:46:27,720
These students, this class,
they've become a family.

2425
02:46:28,600 --> 02:46:30,120
To who? To you?

2426
02:46:30,760 --> 02:46:32,320
To each other.

2427
02:46:33,080 --> 02:46:36,280
Room 203 is a kind of a home for them.

2428
02:46:36,800 --> 02:46:40,000
Their trust is all wrapped up
in us being together as a group.

2429
02:46:40,440 --> 02:46:41,520
Once they're out of her class,

2430
02:46:41,640 --> 02:46:43,960
Believe me they'll slip back
into their old habits.

2431
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:47,880
Their reading scores, their writing
has markedly improved, Ms. Campbell.

2432
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:51,360
On paper. But what has
she accomplished in reality?

2433
02:46:51,480 --> 02:46:53,040
What about new students
that come in next year?

2434
02:46:53,120 --> 02:46:55,040
Can she repeat
this process every year?

2435
02:46:55,160 --> 02:46:56,480
Her methods are impractical,

2436
02:46:56,600 --> 02:46:59,120
Impossible to implement with regularity.

2437
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:01,600
What if every teacher
performed in this way?

2438
02:47:02,200 --> 02:47:03,360
We have millions of children

2439
02:47:03,480 --> 02:47:05,120
To get through the education system
in this country,

2440
02:47:05,240 --> 02:47:06,960
And we need a means
of accomplishing that

2441
02:47:07,080 --> 02:47:09,840
Which allows as many students
to benefit as possible,

2442
02:47:09,960 --> 02:47:11,800
Not just special cases.

2443
02:47:13,240 --> 02:47:16,560
And you honestly think you can create
this family in every classroom,

2444
02:47:16,720 --> 02:47:19,560
For every grade,
for every student you teach?

2445
02:47:23,960 --> 02:47:25,360
I don't know.

2446
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:32,560
Thank you.

2447
02:47:52,120 --> 02:47:54,920
Hey, there go Ms. G.
Hey, there go Ms. G!

2448
02:48:03,480 --> 02:48:04,800
What happened?

2449
02:48:05,560 --> 02:48:09,200
So? Are we gonna be together
for junior year?

2450
02:48:14,840 --> 02:48:16,080
No.

2451
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:18,760
- What?
- What?

2452
02:48:23,160 --> 02:48:26,400
We're gonna be together junior
and senior year.

2453
02:48:27,800 --> 02:48:28,800
Yes!
