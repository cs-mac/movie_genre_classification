1
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:45,415
Her name is Wanda Gruz.
She is your aunt.

2
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,915
We wrote to her many times asking her
to take you.

3
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,040
But she never did.

4
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,124
Maybe she never got the letters?

5
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,790
She did. Because finally she replied
that she couldn't come.

6
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,290
You should meet her before
you take your vows.

7
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,624
She is your only living relative.

8
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,415
Do I have to, Mother?

9
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,207
Yes, Anna.

10
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:17,957
You will go to see her and stay there
for as long as necessary.

11
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:12,957
Are you Wanda Gruz?

12
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,207
- I am your niece.
- I know who you are.

13
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:17,999
Come in.

14
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,415
Are you hungry?

15
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:28,832
No, thank you.

16
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,124
Take a seat.

17
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,457
What did they tell you about me?

18
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,165
That you are my aunt.

19
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,874
That's all?

20
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,999
They didn't tell you who I am?
What I do?

21
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,124
No.

22
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,957
Why didn't you come to take me from the
orphanage?

23
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:18,124
I couldn't. I didn't want to.
You wouldn't have been happy with me.

24
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,582
I'm going.

25
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,124
God bless.

26
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,457
God bless you.

27
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,999
So you are a Jewish nun.

28
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,082
Who?

29
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,832
You're a Jew.

30
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,165
They never told you?

31
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,499
Your real name is Ida Lebenstein.

32
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,665
You're the daughter of Haim
Lebenstein and Róza Herc.

33
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,707
You were born in Piaski, near Lomza.

34
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,665
Wait.

35
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,582
This is Róza...

36
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,415
And this is you.

37
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,207
We've had our little family reunion...

38
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,124
I must get dressed. I'm late.

39
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,915
What time is your train?

40
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,415
I have a bus in the evening.

41
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,707
Do you need any money?

42
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,290
No.

43
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:07,665
Goodbye then.

44
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,207
God be with you.

45
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,874
Goodness.

46
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,707
a whole bed of red tulips...

47
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:39,165
planted by socialist scouts
to honor...

48
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,290
the accused mowed them down...

49
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,165
with this here sabre...

50
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,499
inherited from his grandfather...

51
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:58,540
a member of Pilsudski's Legions.

52
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,374
Róza had an artistic soul.
I liked adventures.

53
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,665
We were very different.

54
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:55,582
She was always making things,
from pieces of cloth or glass.

55
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,999
Once she made a stained glass window...

56
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,957
And put it in the barn
to make the cows happier.

57
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,624
This is your father.

58
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:10,165
Not an interesting type, a bit primitive.
I didn't like him.

59
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,249
Their whole clan was from there.
We were from Lublin.

60
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,582
Because of him she ended up
in that hole.

61
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,374
You have to wear this hood all the time?

62
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,332
You're a redhead too, right?

63
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,374
I had a brother?

64
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,457
No, you were an only child.

65
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:55,540
I'm going to Piaski tomorrow.
I want to visit their graves.

66
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,415
They have no graves.

67
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,749
Neither they, nor any other Jews.

68
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,457
No one knows where their bodies are...

69
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,082
Maybe in the woods or in the lake.

70
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,540
I'll ask around.

71
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:21,332
What if you go there
and discover there is no God?

72
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,582
God is everywhere, I know.

73
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,332
I'll drive you there. We'll go together.

74
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,124
You're sweet.

75
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,249
You have such a nice dimple.

76
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,415
Three, when you smile.

77
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,582
Men will go crazy.

78
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,499
Do you have sinful thoughts sometimes?

79
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:28,707
Yes.

80
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,665
About carnal love?

81
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,540
No.

82
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,207
That's a shame.

83
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,207
You should try...

84
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,540
Otherwise what sort of sacrifice
are these vows of yours.

85
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,124
Praise be to Jesus Christ.

86
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,374
Forever and ever.

87
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,790
You know who lived here before the war?

88
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:04,915
No.

89
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,082
- Why?
- No reason.

90
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,207
My husband knows...

91
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,957
He'll be back later.

92
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,082
Can we look around?

93
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,374
What for?

94
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,999
Don't worry. We won't steal anything.

95
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,999
I don't know.

96
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,124
Come after tea, around four.

97
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,124
Excuse me.

98
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,124
Could you bless my daughter, sister?

99
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,665
One more, please.

100
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,040
And one for the gentleman over there.

101
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,874
Did you know the Lebensteins?

102
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,915
They lived here before the war.

103
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,290
Jews?

104
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,082
No, Eskimos.

105
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,040
Róza and Haim Lebenstein.

106
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,332
We had a lot of Jews here.

107
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,915
But those I didn't know. Sorry.

108
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,290
Why be sorry?

109
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,499
Jesus, that's just what you say.

110
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,332
Did you know them?

111
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,874
And another one, please.

112
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:36,999
And the bill.

113
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,915
Our family used to live in this house.

114
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,332
No Jews ever lived here.

115
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,790
I didn't say they were Jews.

116
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,915
It's my house and my land.

117
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,665
We both know who it belonged to.

118
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,707
Your father hid the Lebensteins
during the war. Where?

119
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:28,790
Where?

120
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,415
In the woods? In some shelter?

121
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,499
I know who denounced Jews
and who helped them.

122
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,249
- Father never went to the Germans.
- I know.

123
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:42,874
How did they die?

124
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,707
Szymon Skiba, your father.
Where is he?

125
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:51,707
Don't know.

126
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,707
I know when someone is lying.

127
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,832
I can destroy you.

128
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,749
You have children.

129
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:05,915
Where is your father?

130
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,290
Don't know.

131
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,165
This is so Róza.

132
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,374
Fancy stained glass next to cow shit.

133
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,999
Here they are...

134
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,707
Good Christians... your neighbours.

135
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,207
Your mates are here.

136
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,790
When did you start drinking?

137
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,332
When I was about twelve.

138
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:31,124
Listen, you can make things easy
for yourself or hard.

139
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,207
Listen, comrade...

140
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,832
It would easier if
you showed some respect.

141
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,415
You have to let me go.
I have immunity. I am a judge.

142
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,082
Lock her up.

143
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,707
Will you be alright?

144
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:45,582
Let's go.

145
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,999
They'll let me out tomorrow.

146
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:49,915
Immunity...

147
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,040
No, I didn't know them.

148
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,124
Jews usually kept to themselves.

149
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,332
Were you here during the war?

150
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,499
I was.

151
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:18,124
Do you have some connection
to them, sister?

152
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,332
No, nothing.

153
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,832
I'm sorry but this is all I can offer.

154
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,499
- Good night, sister.
- Good night.

155
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,957
- God be with you.
- God be with you.

156
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:39,832
Thank you.

157
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,207
I hope you will accept our apologies,
comrade.

158
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:19,124
- It was for your own good. You were indisposed.
- Go to hell.

159
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,540
Safe journey.

160
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,290
Who are you?

161
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,874
Nobody these days...

162
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,165
But I used to be a state
prosecutor once.

163
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,624
Big public trials.

164
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:13,040
I even sent a few people to death.

165
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,874
Who?

166
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,207
Enemies of the People.

167
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,749
This was in the early fifties.

168
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,957
Red Wanda - that's me.

169
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,290
Gone with the wind.

170
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,624
Want a doughnut?

171
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,457
What'll happen when we find this Szymon?

172
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,915
He'll tell us how your parents died
and where they're buried.

173
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,165
That's what you wanted, no?

174
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,082
- Where are you going?
- To Szydlów.

175
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:06,665
So are we.

176
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:10,290
Cigarette?

177
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,457
Where can you get these?

178
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,124
State secret.

179
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,915
What's in the case? A saxophone?

180
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,665
Yes. Alto.

181
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,415
Beautiful instrument.

182
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,124
Male, sensuous.

183
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,624
Do you live in Szydlów?

184
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:37,249
No. We're doing a gig there.

185
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:39,124
To celebrate the town's anniversary.

186
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:41,540
And you?

187
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:52,707
Will you come to the dance tonight?
Might be fun.

188
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:54,415
Why not.

189
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:55,874
Thanks.

190
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,582
Not bad, our lad.

191
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:36,832
Do you know Szymon Skiba?
He lives around here.

192
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,707
Skiba? No.

193
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,332
But ask Marek at the bar.

194
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,957
He knows everyone. Ask him.

195
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:53,457
- He's not here.
- When's he back?

196
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:56,499
- They took him to the hospital with...
- When's he back?

197
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,957
Tomorrow. Or later...
God willing.

198
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,207
Maybe he's hiding from us.

199
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,207
- Cold.
- What?

200
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:40,665
Cold.

201
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:44,457
Where is He?

202
00:29:58,166 --> 00:29:59,582
Which one do you want?

203
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:02,624
Neither.

204
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:07,374
Come on, you won't stop being a nun.

205
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,124
Your Jesus didn't hide
in a cave with books...

206
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,124
But went out into the world.

207
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,332
I'm not going anywhere.

208
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,915
What?

209
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,624
I'm not going anywhere.

210
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,332
Fine, I'll have fun on my own.

211
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:38,207
C'est la vie.

212
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:53,165
I thought we were here
because of my parents.

213
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:01,915
We are.

214
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:17,207
I loved Róza very much.

215
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,165
You are so similar.

216
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,999
I won't let you waste your life.

217
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:45,749
Of course...

218
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:50,957
I'm a slut and you're a little saint.

219
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:10,499
This Jesus of yours adored
people like me.

220
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:22,957
Take Mary Magdalen...

221
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,332
Let's have a read.

222
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,582
What a beast came out.

223
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:16,832
What was that you played?

224
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:21,582
Naima by Coltrane. Did you like it?

225
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,165
Very much.

226
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:31,124
You're a funny couple.

227
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,624
My aunt and me?

228
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,290
I know.

229
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,332
We only met two days ago.

230
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:41,790
Where are you from?

231
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,957
From a village. Not far from here.

232
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:46,749
But I was raised in a convent.

233
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:53,207
And now I'm Jewish, too.

234
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:58,624
And I've got some gypsy in me.

235
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:03,374
So why are you here?

236
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,707
I'm looking for a man who
knew my parents.

237
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:23,707
Thank you.

238
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:35,040
He's probably still in the hospital.

239
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:44,040
I'll wait downstairs.

240
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,082
Let's go.

241
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:26,415
Remember me?

242
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:42,749
You knew the Lebensteins during the war.

243
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,665
We'd like to know where they're buried.

244
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,790
I'm their daughter.

245
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,082
Róza.

246
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,207
I'm Ida.

247
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,124
They were...

248
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,040
Good people...

249
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,957
I hid them in the woods...

250
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:17,124
Fed them...

251
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,082
And then you killed them.

252
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:36,207
Was he very scared?

253
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,499
Who?

254
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:49,082
The boy.

255
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:16,124
How did you do it?

256
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:24,082
With an axe?

257
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:53,624
I left him with Róza...

258
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:03,957
And went to fight...

259
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:09,624
For God knows what.

260
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,957
I hardly knew him.

261
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,457
Praise be to God.

262
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:47,290
Leave my father alone,
let him die in peace.

263
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,915
Nobody can prove anything anyway.

264
00:44:53,416 --> 00:44:54,707
What happened, happened.

265
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:56,499
What do you want?

266
00:44:59,916 --> 00:45:04,707
You give up claims to the house and
I'll show you where they're buried...

267
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:09,624
And you leave us in peace.

268
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:15,957
Deal?

269
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:18,665
Yes.

270
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:26,957
Good.

271
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:29,957
See you tomorrow.

272
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:32,915
I know I can trust you, sister.

273
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:32,957
So?

274
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,415
Did you find that man?

275
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:38,374
Yes.

276
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:50,290
What now?

277
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:54,290
You're going back to the institution?

278
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:59,290
You mean the convent? Yes.

279
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:02,165
For long?

280
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:04,582
Forever.

281
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,749
I'm taking my vows next week.

282
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:23,582
And you?

283
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:28,915
I'm mainly trying to avoid the army.

284
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:32,040
And vows too.

285
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:47,457
You've no idea of the effect
you have, do you?

286
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:46,665
And me?

287
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:49,124
Why am I not here?

288
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,124
You were tiny...

289
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:04,415
No one would know you were Jewish.

290
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:10,082
I took you to the priest
and left you there.

291
00:52:13,958 --> 00:52:17,582
The boy was dark and circumcised.

292
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:23,665
It wasn't father...

293
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,165
I killed them.

294
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,040
We'll go to Lublin.

295
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:10,040
We have a family grave there.

296
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:14,207
If that graveyard still exists.

297
00:54:19,166 --> 00:54:20,374
We should find a priest.

298
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:23,207
You mean a rabbi.

299
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:27,040
Don't drink now.

300
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,457
It's a long way, I'll sober up.

301
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,665
Will you come to my vows?

302
00:57:45,791 --> 00:57:48,207
No, but I'll drink to your health.

303
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:14,957
It's a pity Róza couldn't see you.

304
00:59:18,416 --> 00:59:20,040
So?

305
01:00:56,541 --> 01:01:02,124
Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed
be Thy name, Thy kingdom come...

306
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,832
I'm not ready.

307
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:40,082
Forgive me.

308
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:16,457
In front of all you sisters gathered here
and you Mother Superior...

309
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:21,707
I vow chastity, poverty and
obedience...

310
01:02:22,791 --> 01:02:26,665
Do not despise, Lord,
this heart, repentant and humble.

311
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:37,124
Do you have a car?

312
01:03:38,625 --> 01:03:40,207
Of course.

313
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:43,957
Will you drive me home?

314
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:49,165
Not now. Sit down.

315
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:04,540
She has such beautiful hair.

316
01:04:06,791 --> 01:04:09,040
But she hides it away.

317
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:12,999
Who?

318
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,249
Ida.

319
01:10:26,958 --> 01:10:30,749
Comrade Wanda Gruz
contributed greatly...

320
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:34,540
To the creation of a new Poland...

321
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:38,832
Tenaciously exercising
People's justice...

322
01:10:47,958 --> 01:10:49,124
farewell comrade...

323
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:51,957
You'll live forever in our memory.

324
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:07,874
What are you thinking about?

325
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,624
I'm not thinking.

326
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:16,790
We're off to Gdansk to do some gigs.
Wanna come?

327
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:20,332
Ever been to the seaside?

328
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:22,540
I haven't been anywhere.

329
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,415
Come along, then...

330
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:29,624
You'll listen to us play,
we'll walk on the beach.

331
01:14:31,208 --> 01:14:32,374
And then?

332
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,290
Then we'll buy a dog...

333
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:49,999
Get married, have children...

334
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:52,290
Get a house.

335
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:54,207
And then?

336
01:14:58,833 --> 01:15:01,457
The usual. Life.

337
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:06,600
