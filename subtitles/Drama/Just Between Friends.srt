1
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,697
Ladies, ladies...

2
00:01:55,698 --> 00:02:00,202
Why is Holly the only one
doing her stretches?

3
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,205
Mmm?

4
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,206
Hm-hm.

5
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,709
Stretch! Yes, stretch!

6
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:13,215
Stretch. Right. Good!

7
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,219
Stretch! Get those
bodies working. Stretch!

8
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,221
Karen. Put your head

9
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,223
all the way between your legs.

10
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:25,727
Listen, Helga. If God
wanted women to do that,

11
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:29,731
he wouldn't have invented men.

12
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:30,733
Ow!

13
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,238
Yes! That's right!

14
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,283
2, 3, 4,

15
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:46,248
5, 6, 7...

16
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,751
Do it like Holly is doing.

17
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:53,255
Right. Lift! Good, good, good.

18
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,758
If I'd learned this a year ago,
it might have saved my marriage.

19
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,760
Good, Holly!

20
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,763
Good, Holly!

21
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,268
Up! 2, 3...

22
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,771
<i>Gott in himmel! What is this?</i>

23
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,274
What the hell was that?

24
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,778
That was an earthquake.

25
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,281
Just about ready
to tape, Sandy.

26
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,282
Just a minute, doc.

27
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,784
I'll put the wire
into the coat,

28
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,786
so that it can't
be seen. There.

29
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,288
Lucky you're wearing a jacket,

30
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,290
or Charlie'd go up
through your pants.

31
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,791
Only with you, Sandy.

32
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,793
Okay, Charlie,
give us a sound level.

33
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,797
Now, say something,
so I can get a sound level.

34
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,800
Good. Any time
you're ready, Sandy.

35
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,302
All right, here we go.

36
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,308
Dr. Davis, relax. Ready?

37
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,810
Rolling. 3, 2, 1.

38
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,313
Carla, that big shake
Southern Cali...

39
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:53,816
Cut!

40
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,821
Oh, my God! Are you
on the air? Am I?

41
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,824
No. No. It's okay. Really.
We're just taping.

42
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,826
Oh, good. I'm really
very sorry.

43
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,328
Rolling, 3, 2...

44
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,329
Hi, Sandy.

45
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:07,830
Cut.

46
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,331
Harry Crandall.

47
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,832
Remember Harry?

48
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,335
We were at
the nuclear freeze rally.

49
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:17,839
Ah! Of course,
of course. Harry!

50
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,842
You said some terrific things.

51
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,346
No. No, I didn't say
anything, actually.

52
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,847
I bit a cop, though.

53
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,349
You bit a cop?

54
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,351
I thought they'd charge me
with assaulting an officer,

55
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,352
but they reduced it to...

56
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,855
Harry, I think maybe...

57
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,358
Sure. Oh, here.

58
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,860
Dr. Davis.

59
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,863
One more time.

60
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,865
This is Sandy Dunlap
reporting from

61
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,868
the California seismological
center in Pasadena.

62
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,869
Hi, Mrs. Davis.

63
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,372
Hey, wait up for me!

64
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,386
Will someone let me in?
My arms are full!

65
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,887
Help. Help out.
Help, help, help, help.

66
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,889
Thanks. Can you take those?

67
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,391
Dad's going to be on TV.

68
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,394
He is? What, about
the earthquake?

69
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,896
Yeah.

70
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,398
What is this?

71
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,400
It's a sculpture.

72
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,902
Well, yeah, but what
is it supposed to be?

73
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,904
It's not supposed to be
anything.

74
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,407
I saw it in a gallery
and I liked it

75
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,408
and I brought it home
on approval.

76
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,411
Mom, commercial's
almost over. This is it!

77
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,413
<i>Registering 5.3
on the Richter scale.</i>

78
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,914
<i>No lives were lost,</i>

79
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,916
<i>and there were
no serious injuries,</i>

80
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,419
<i>but there has been
moderate to heavy damage</i>

81
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,920
<i>from as far north
as Bakersfield</i>

82
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:42,924
<i>to as far South as San Diego.</i>

83
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,926
<i>Did you feel that this morning?</i>

84
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,429
<i>That really was a heck of
a jolt, wasn't it, bill?</i>

85
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,932
<i>Oh, yes. It sure was, Carla.</i>

86
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,934
<i>Where were you when it hit?</i>

87
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,437
<i>I was in the shower.
And dumb me,</i>

88
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,439
<i>I thought something was
wrong with the plumbing,</i>

89
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,441
<i>because everything
started shaking</i>

90
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,943
<i>and I thought,
"what is going on here?"</i>

91
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,445
What a dipshit.

92
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:03,946
Jeff!

93
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,947
She is, mom.

94
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,949
How did she get
this job, anyway?

95
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,451
Who knows?

96
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,455
<i>Hardly any.
But it sure is windy.</i>

97
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,458
Jeff, get that.
If it's for me, I'll call back.

98
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,960
Hello? She's busy right now.

99
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,463
<i>I believe they say
that you should</i>

100
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,966
<i>stand... In the doorway.</i>

101
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,969
And he's no
Eric Sevareid, either.

102
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,473
Doorway?
I crawled under my bed.

103
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,975
<i>There I was under there
with no clothes on</i>

104
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,477
<i>and all those dust bunnies.</i>

105
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,980
Will you just get on with it
so I can see my husband?

106
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:39,981
Mom, it's for you.

107
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,483
Honey, just take a message.

108
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,486
I tried to, but she said
it's really important.

109
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,988
All right.

110
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,658
<i>Holly, this is Helga.</i>

111
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,159
Helga?

112
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,161
Helga, listen.
Can I call you right back?

113
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,663
My husband
is going to be on TV.

114
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,165
God, daddy looks so handsome.

115
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,166
A total stud.

116
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:02,170
Teach? A class? Who, me?

117
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,673
But I've never done anything
like that before in my life.

118
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,675
Mom, come on, hurry up!

119
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:10,679
Helga, that's really
very flattering, but...

120
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Hurry!

121
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,183
Maybe I could
fill in just this once.

122
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,685
<i>Then those predictions
that California</i>

123
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,688
<i>will soon drop into the pacific
are somewhat exaggerated?</i>

124
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,689
<i>Well, let me put it this way.</i>

125
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,191
<i>I don't go to bed
with my swim-fins on,</i>

126
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,693
<i>if that answers your question.</i>

127
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,696
Mom, he's so cute.
You're missing the best part.

128
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,698
Let me just see
if I can manage it,

129
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,702
and then I'll call you right
back. Yes, I will. I promise.

130
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,204
Five minutes. Goodbye.

131
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,207
You missed it. It's over.

132
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,709
I missed it? Damn, I missed it.

133
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,711
See if it's on
any other channel.

134
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,713
Who was that lady on the phone?

135
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,716
Oh, that was the owner
of the exercise studio I go to.

136
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,718
She wants me
to teach a class tonight.

137
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,220
Teach? You?

138
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,722
Yeah, that's what I said.

139
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,223
<i>Hello?</i>

140
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,224
Chip, hi!

141
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,727
Why didn't you tell us
you were going to be on TV?

142
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,730
I'm sorry. I guess it got so
busy around here that I forgot.

143
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,232
Well, you know,
we could have missed it.

144
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,235
Jeff! I just cut those
for myself. Mom!

145
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,738
Will you two
hold it down, please!

146
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,239
<i>Listen, I can still
hold dinner for you</i>

147
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,741
<i>if you think you'll
be home in time.</i>

148
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,742
No, no, no. Don't do that.

149
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,746
I won't leave
until at least 10:00 or 10:30.

150
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,749
Harry, would you mind?
Sorry, wait, what?

151
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,251
Helga called
from the exercise studio.

152
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,253
And this is going to sound
a little crazy,

153
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,756
but one of her
instructors quit,

154
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,260
and she wants me
to come down and teach.

155
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,762
Teach? A class?

156
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,265
Yeah. I mean, you know,
I know all the exercises.

157
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,769
And I think I'm pretty good.
But I don't know.

158
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,771
You know, I still have the kids'
dinner to get and everything.

159
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,272
I'm doing my own dinner, mom.

160
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,273
Don't worry about me.

161
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,775
Anyway, I'm going
over to Cathy's

162
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,276
to work on my biology report.

163
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,778
I'm studying chemistry
with Wendy.

164
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,781
We'll get a pizza after.
You were cool, dad!

165
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,283
Sounds like
everybody's deserting you.

166
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,787
Yeah, well, I still
have to feed Stanley.

167
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,789
Unless you're going to
eat out, too.

168
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,290
Hey, you know,
I think you ought to do it.

169
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,792
I mean, you know, why not?

170
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,793
It's better than sitting around
all by yourself

171
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,294
without anything to do.

172
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,798
It's not as though I
don't have anything to do here,

173
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,800
but it might be fun.

174
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,802
Yeah, do it. Have fun. Really.

175
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,804
Okay, I will. I love you.

176
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,305
I love you, too.

177
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,305
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

178
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,307
Bye-bye.

179
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,810
I'm sorry. That was Holly.

180
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,814
She's all pumped up about
teaching some exercise class.

181
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,317
I bet she'd be
really good at that.

182
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,319
Why?

183
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,323
Well, because...

184
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,827
I think she'd be good at
anything she wanted to do.

185
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,830
Well, you're her
biggest fan, Harry.

186
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,831
Next to you.

187
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,833
That's right.

188
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,838
4, 3, 2, 1. We're clear.

189
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,341
Like doing the news
with chatty Cathy.

190
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,844
We're lucky to get out
of that alive.

191
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,346
George! Excuse me.

192
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,348
Good report
on the earthquake, Sandy.

193
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,850
Great stuff
with that seismologist.

194
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:06,855
Thanks. Listen, George...
I've really got to talk to you

195
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:07,356
we've got going here.

196
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,857
Now?

197
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,359
Well, yeah. Come on, George.

198
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,862
I've been here
two years, right.

199
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,363
And I think I've really
been pretty patient,

200
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,364
but this is ridiculous.

201
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,367
I can't talk now.
I've got a meeting.

202
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,370
That's what you said yesterday,
and the day before.

203
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,873
How about tomorrow?
Call Myra, have her set it up.

204
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,875
I thought that was such
a great show tonight.

205
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,376
Didn't you, George?

206
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,377
Lots of fun, you know.

207
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,879
Right.

208
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,884
I'm ready in five.
Give me time to change.

209
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,886
Loved your spot, Sandy.
Really cute.

210
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,389
Thanks.

211
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,391
A meeting, huh?

212
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,895
Carla and I have to...
Discuss something.

213
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,898
Right.

214
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,400
World peace...

215
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,904
or the dust bunnies
under her bed?

216
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,405
Tomorrow, all right?

217
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,908
Let Myra know when
you're free. Myra!

218
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,934
Um... okay...

219
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,438
Um... if we...

220
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,443
Could I have your attention?
Um... all right, every...

221
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,947
Could I please have your
atten...?

222
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,949
Attention, please. Thank you.

223
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,450
Hello.

224
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,453
My name is Holly, and...

225
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,456
Well, Helga had to teach
a whole bunch of extra cla...

226
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,457
What?

227
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,961
Helga had to teach
extra classes,

228
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,464
so she asked me if I would, you
know, sort of fill in for her.

229
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,968
So if you'll all just
bear with me... um...

230
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,470
How does she usually
start you off?

231
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,471
By making us sing.

232
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,974
"Deutschland,
Deutschland über alles."

233
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,977
A little Nazi humor...

234
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,479
Oh...

235
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,985
Well, okay, then.

236
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,990
All right, then.

237
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,993
We'll do a back
to the legs stretch.

238
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,995
If you'll all reach up,

239
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,999
inhale, over, easy, easy...

240
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,002
Head down, grab your ankles,

241
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,505
and gently pulse.

242
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:47,515
And reach to the left

243
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:51,520
and face the knee, and hold.

244
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,524
Other side.

245
00:12:56,525 --> 00:13:00,028
Over, face the knee...

246
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,033
and hold.

247
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,535
Sit up, inhale,

248
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:12,040
exhale and extend.

249
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:20,549
Inhale, exhale and extend.

250
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,553
Holly!

251
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,556
And extend.

252
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,059
Holly!

253
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,562
And extend.

254
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:20,108
<i>7, 6, 5, 4, 3...</i>

255
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,111
Oh...

256
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,613
Hi.

257
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,616
Hi.

258
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,120
You're really good.

259
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,622
Well, thanks. So are you.

260
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,124
Well, thanks.

261
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,126
Where have you been working?

262
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:42,630
I don't do this for a living.
I'm just helping out Helga.

263
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,133
Well, I hope
you got paid in advance.

264
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,636
Damn it! Why are there never
any clean towels around here?

265
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,639
I know. That's why
I bring my own.

266
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,143
I'll give you 50 cents
if I can use it after you.

267
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,646
A buck if I can use it first.

268
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,653
<i>Oh God!
What happened to the hot water?</i>

269
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,657
On the other hand, I may
be showering at home tonight.

270
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,159
I'll tell you,

271
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,163
this place is a sorry excuse
for a gym, if you ask me.

272
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,667
I thought the Germans were
supposed to be so organized.

273
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,173
Here.

274
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,177
Thanks.

275
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,691
So, do you feel like
getting something to eat?

276
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,696
Oh. No, I can't. My husband
will be home soon.

277
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,700
Well, I'm not usually out
this late on weeknights.

278
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,702
9:30?

279
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:58,206
Oh, no... I meant that
I ought to be there.

280
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,207
'Cause he'll be tired.

281
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,210
He won't fix anything
for himself to eat.

282
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,712
I don't want him to go
to bed on an empty stomach.

283
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,716
If he hasn't eaten already.

284
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,219
Though he probably has.

285
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,222
A simple yes or no?

286
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,226
Well, I guess no.

287
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:23,731
Sure! Yeah.
Actually, I'd like to.

288
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,234
I'm sorry,
I do that all the time.

289
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,237
I've got to speak to Helga,
so I'll meet you out front, huh?

290
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:29,738
Okay.

291
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,243
Make sure
she pays you. In cash.

292
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,247
I need those towels.

293
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,248
<i>I need cash.</i>

294
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,249
Cash?

295
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,251
<i>Yeah, 52, cash.</i>

296
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,253
I can't pay you in cash.

297
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,256
<i>No towels.</i>

298
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,261
Yes?

299
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,763
Well, it's about the class
I just taught.

300
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,764
I was wondering...

301
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,766
Yes, I got a lot
of compliments on you.

302
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,768
The girls said
you were just great.

303
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:05,273
Really?
Oh, isn't that nice? So...

304
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,774
I've got to let Michelle go,

305
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:10,778
and I was wondering if you
would like to take her place.

306
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,780
That's very flattering...

307
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,782
Helga, she is terrific.

308
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,284
I hope you're paying her
what she's worth.

309
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:20,288
The same as the other girls.
$20 a lesson.

310
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,291
That's not enough.

311
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,294
Hold out for more.

312
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,797
20 will be fine.

313
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,800
If you could just wait
until next week?

314
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,803
Sure.

315
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,807
That girl who just left...

316
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,810
What's her name?
She looks very familiar.

317
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:46,314
Sandy Dunlap.
She's on the news. On the TV.

318
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:50,319
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
A celebrity.

319
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,823
I like your shoes.

320
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,824
Ah, thanks.

321
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,826
I wish I could wear
things like that.

322
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,828
Why can't you?

323
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,330
I wouldn't have the nerve.

324
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,331
I mean...

325
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,832
I know what you mean.

326
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,335
You should see them
when I plug them in.

327
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,337
Do you want to
get something to eat here?

328
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,340
No. There.

329
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,342
Ice cream?

330
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,345
I thought you meant something,
you know, more substantial.

331
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,846
More substantial?

332
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,349
Let's see. I had
a tab for breakfast,

333
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,851
a snickers bar for lunch, so...

334
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,355
this will be the most
sensible meal I've had all day.

335
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,857
Oh boy!

336
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,361
How did you get
into it? News, I mean.

337
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,864
Well, I started out as
a weather girl in Indianapolis.

338
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,867
You know, your basic
22-year-old airhead.

339
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,370
I didn't know
my ass from an isobar,

340
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,871
to tell you the truth.

341
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,873
And my producer knew it, right.

342
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,876
So he told me that
he would renew my option

343
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,879
if I would just do him
this small horizontal favor

344
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,881
every now and then.

345
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,383
God, what a pig!

346
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,385
I would have rather
have slept with king Kong,

347
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:01,389
who I'm sure had better breath
than this asshole.

348
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,390
There you are, sir.

349
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,893
Here you go. Thank you.

350
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,397
Want a cigarette?

351
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,399
No, thanks. I gave them up
a long time ago.

352
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,402
Did you really? Oh God,
I wish I could.

353
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,403
How?

354
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,405
It really was Chip, my husband.

355
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,408
He kept going on and on about
what life would be like

356
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,910
for him and
the kids without me.

357
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,912
So, of course, every time I even
thought about a cigarette,

358
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,914
I'd get this picture
of my little family

359
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,916
putting flowers on my grave.

360
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,918
I tried to quit
a couple of times

361
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,920
and my husband
was always begging me

362
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,422
to take it up again.

363
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,424
You're married?

364
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,425
I was.

365
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:41,929
But marriage and a career
in TV news don't mix.

366
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,432
At least not for me.

367
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,435
He just really couldn't
deal with my ambition.

368
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,439
I don't blame him.
Most men can't.

369
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,441
I keep having to make
these wrenching decisions

370
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,943
between my career,
which I'm good at,

371
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:59,947
and my life, which I'm not.

372
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,450
It just really fucks me up.

373
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,955
It doesn't have to, you know.

374
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,958
Doesn't have to what?

375
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,962
F-fuck you up.

376
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,966
You've never said
that before, have you?

377
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,469
Said what?

378
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,472
The f-word.

379
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:31,479
What I meant was, isn't that
kind of an old-fashioned idea?

380
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,982
Having to make a choice
between career and marriage?

381
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,486
I mean, sure, a lot of women
used to think that way.

382
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:43,491
I guess I did myself.
But that was a long time ago.

383
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,992
Not that I had
that much of a career.

384
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,494
What did you do?

385
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,995
I was a dancer.

386
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:48,996
Really?

387
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:49,997
Not Makarova or anything.

388
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:53,501
I was mostly doing
TV commercials.

389
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,504
Do you remember Mr. Peanut?

390
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,505
Intimately.

391
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,507
They were going to
do commercials

392
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,508
where he got married.

393
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,509
Yeah?

394
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,512
And I was going to be
Mrs. Peanut.

395
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,514
And then I got pregnant.

396
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,517
You got knocked up
by Mr. Peanut?

397
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,018
By Chip.

398
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,021
But who knows? It could
have led to something.

399
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,023
Sure.

400
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:22,530
Actually, I was pretty good.
But I made a choice.

401
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,034
And I've never regretted it.

402
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,539
I guess this is
the one thing I regret.

403
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,544
Yeah, it's a career
in itself in a way.

404
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,546
I mean, if I'm ever
going to have a kid,

405
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:42,550
I'd better start thinking
about doing it pretty soon.

406
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,051
Hard to do if you're single.

407
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,053
Yeah.

408
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,056
But not impossible.

409
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,559
Are you really serious?

410
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:56,565
I'd prefer to
do it with a husband, but...

411
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:02,069
I've been saving my money
for a couple of years

412
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,572
just in case I decided
to get pregnant.

413
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,576
See, the thing is,

414
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,579
I've always said that if
the right guy comes along,

415
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,583
I'd just do it, right?

416
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:19,086
Well, I've met him.

417
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,589
This guy is exactly
what I've been looking for.

418
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,593
He's handsome,
super-intelligent...

419
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:29,096
Good genes,
you know what I mean?

420
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,600
If he's so perfect,
why don't you marry him?

421
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,606
<i>Well, he's not that perfect.</i>

422
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,616
Well...

423
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:52,119
Maybe we can
do it again, sometime.

424
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,122
I'd like that.

425
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,626
What about Saturday?
You could come for dinner.

426
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,127
Bring your friend.

427
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,630
Oh, I don't think
he could make it.

428
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,132
Besides, Saturday's my
only night off this week.

429
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,635
Oh. You're probably busy.

430
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,137
Well, I have to do
tons of laundry

431
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,141
and re-tape the top
of my car, you know.

432
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,647
What time would you like me?

433
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,654
<i>Meanwhile, the sixth fleet
was bombarding...</i>

434
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,156
<i>Takes the ball on the 50. 45...</i>

435
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:32,159
<i>Picks up a block on the 40.
35, 30, and still going.</i>

436
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,664
<i>25, and out of bounds
at the 25-yard line.</i>

437
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:42,170
<i>They have the ball at
the start of that 25-yard line.</i>

438
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,674
<i>Third and long.
Here's the snap.</i>

439
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,176
<i>Cindy goes up right past them.</i>

440
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,177
<i>Beats the 10, the 5,</i>

441
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:54,182
<i>and she's in for
the touchdown. She scores.</i>

442
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,192
Hi, dad.

443
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,192
Hi.

444
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,694
Didn't know you were home.

445
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:10,698
I just got in.
What are you watching?

446
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,201
Something on...

447
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,704
bees.

448
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,207
It's really interesting.

449
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,711
Well, if you don't mind, I'd
rather not watch bees tonight.

450
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,214
<i>Put our faith
in this book and the...</i>

451
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,217
<i>Three, ready, break!</i>

452
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,721
I didn't know
there was a game on tonight.

453
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,223
Must be that new league, huh?

454
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,225
Must be.

455
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,227
<i>Cindy again with the ball.
Picks up a block.</i>

456
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,729
<i>Nobody's going to catch her.</i>

457
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,732
Good move she put
on that linebacker there.

458
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,734
Yeah.

459
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,738
I don't suppose
they have slo-mo replay?

460
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,242
You know, I think this is
what fatherhood is all about.

461
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,244
Sitting in your living room,

462
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,747
<i>watching Monday night football
with your son.</i>

463
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,751
Especially on Thursday nights.

464
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,253
Yeah...

465
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,756
It's really American.

466
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,259
Chip!

467
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,261
Good night, dad.
We'll do it again sometime.

468
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,263
You betcha.

469
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,765
Hi, mom. Good night.

470
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,266
Good night.

471
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,767
Hi.

472
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,769
<i>After a day
of collecting pollen...</i>

473
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,770
What are you watching?

474
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,773
Just this thing on... Bees.

475
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,774
Bees?

476
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,277
You had to be there
from the beginning.

477
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:36,283
What...? What's this?

478
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,286
It's a sculpture.
I saw it in a gallery today.

479
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:43,290
I thought it
was really... Interesting.

480
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,794
Don't you? Because I only
have it on approval.

481
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,798
You know, just to see
if we really like it.

482
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,299
Hmm...

483
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,302
And I guess we don't.

484
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,304
Is this new?

485
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,807
The leotard is.
Same old rear end.

486
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,810
Doesn't look so old to me.

487
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:06,313
Anyway, I met the most
interesting girl,

488
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,815
and we went and had
ice cream afterwards

489
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,317
and we talked for hours.

490
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,819
That's why I'm so late.

491
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,322
God, I haven't
done that in ages.

492
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,324
It might not seem like
such a big deal to you,

493
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,326
'cause you've got Harry,

494
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,830
but since Elaine
moved to Boston, I've...

495
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,834
you know, haven't had
a close friend.

496
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:30,337
Chip, I'm all sweaty
from class.

497
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,340
That's okay. I like you that way.

498
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,843
Earthquakes always do this
to you, don't they?

499
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,345
They do. They get me all horny.

500
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:42,349
And I guess that's why
I chose the field, huh?

501
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,352
I really should take a shower.

502
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,854
You can take one afterwards.

503
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:51,358
But I bought
this slinky nightgown.

504
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,361
You can wear it afterwards.

505
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,863
It's very...

506
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,867
sexy.

507
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:03,371
Well... No. No, no. No time.

508
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,374
Anyway, I invited this girl

509
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,377
to have dinner on Saturday...

510
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,880
night.

511
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,882
Listen, you can talk about
her afterwards, too, okay?

512
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:18,385
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You always
go to sleep afterwards.

513
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,887
Even better.

514
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,890
Mom!

515
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,893
Yes... Kim.

516
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,895
How come the door is locked?

517
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,397
Because your mother and I
were doing it.

518
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,400
Is it? Dear, I was half asleep.

519
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,902
Thanks a lot!

520
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,403
I need some money
for new jogging shoes.

521
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,905
Wait a minute, here.

522
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,907
Were you going to go out
right now and buy them

523
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,408
in some midnight shoe store?

524
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,911
No, tomorrow. After school.

525
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,413
Then can we talk about it
tomorrow morning, please?

526
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,415
Okay. Good night.

527
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,416
Good night.

528
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,417
Good night.

529
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,919
Did I disturb something?

530
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
No!

531
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,922
Yes!

532
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:59,427
Would you give me a second,
here? Let me handle this.

533
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,932
Did you ever think
how nice it might be

534
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,433
to have another child?

535
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,435
Isn't that funny?
I was just thinking

536
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,938
how nice it would be to
get rid of the two we've got.

537
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,941
No, I'm serious.

538
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,945
I was thinking
it might be nice.

539
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:22,450
I mean, the kids
are almost grown...

540
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,956
and I don't have as much to
do around here as I used to.

541
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,964
Maybe we could
talk about this later.

542
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,471
<i>Mary. Here she is.</i>

543
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,481
<i>Oh, my...</i>

544
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,984
<i>Yeah, yeah...</i>

545
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,987
<i>It's George Margolin.</i>

546
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,488
<i>Damn, I was hoping to
catch you at home.</i>

547
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,490
<i>But listen,
I'm really sorry about</i>

548
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,492
<i>not being able to talk to you
tonight after the show,</i>

549
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,994
<i>but I really did have
a meeting with Carla.</i>

550
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,495
Yeah...

551
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,998
<i>Some contract problem.
Honestly, that's all.</i>

552
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:11,999
<i>What am I doing?
I'm your producer,</i>

553
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,002
<i>I don't have to make excuses
to you. Call Myra...</i>

554
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,506
Hurry up, George.
You've only got 30 seconds.

555
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,508
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

556
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,510
<i>Listen, I'm sorry
I couldn't see you tonight,</i>

557
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,512
<i>but with all these aftershocks</i>

558
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,515
<i>we're all
working overtime here.</i>

559
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,018
<i>I really wish
I could have come over.</i>

560
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,021
<i>I mean, you always seem to
be able to make time for me</i>

561
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,522
<i>when I want to see you.</i>

562
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:40,027
<i>I feel lousy when you need
to see me and I can't.</i>

563
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:46,033
<i>Anyway, I've been thinking
about you tonight a lot.</i>

564
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:50,037
<i>I just want you to know that,
if that helps.</i>

565
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,040
<i>Probably doesn't, does it?</i>

566
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,052
Who left their ice cream dish
on the coffee table?

567
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,553
I don't eat animal products.

568
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,055
Jeff, come and get
your ice cream dish

569
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,556
and put it in the dishwasher.

570
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,058
How many times
do I have to tell you

571
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,560
not to leave your things around
for other people to pick up?

572
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,561
And put it in the dishwasher.

573
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,562
I was going to pick it up.

574
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,565
When? There's penicillin
growing on it. Quickly.

575
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:22,570
Red sneakers in the fireplace!

576
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,572
I wish your father
would get home.

577
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:28,075
I don't want Sandy
to arrive before he does.

578
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,577
Does she drive
a little black sports car?

579
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,080
Yeah. Why?

580
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,582
Well, she got here
before he did.

581
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,585
She's 15 minutes early!

582
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,589
Put the crab puffs
in the lower oven.

583
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,591
Oh...

584
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,101
Hi!

585
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,603
Hi. Am I early?

586
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,606
No. I said 7:30.

587
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,108
Or 15.

588
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,609
Are you sure?

589
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,610
Yes!

590
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,612
You see, I have this problem
about being early.

591
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,614
I'm always catching people
putting on their make-up

592
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,618
or just getting
out of the shower.

593
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,619
Really, if you're not ready,

594
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,121
I could easily just walk
around the block.

595
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,623
No, no, it's fine. Come on in.

596
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,125
Can I get you a drink?

597
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,127
Sure. Wine, I guess.

598
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,129
Okay.

599
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:27,134
Holly! Who decorated
your house?

600
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,138
I did.

601
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,141
You're amazing.

602
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,143
You know, once I was so early,

603
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,645
I caught these people
in the middle of humping.

604
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,647
Yeah. They tried to
act casual about it,

605
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,649
but they were both real sweaty,

606
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:47,154
and the guy had his shirttail
caught in his zipper.

607
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,156
Actually, I'm
a little embarrassed

608
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,158
about something myself.

609
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,661
Chip had to go to the office
and he isn't home yet.

610
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,662
Oh, look, do you want me

611
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,664
to come back another time?
I can easily...

612
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,167
No, no, no! He'll be here.

613
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,669
Okay.

614
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,674
Do you want me to take that?

615
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,676
I'm sorry. This is for you.

616
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,178
Thanks.

617
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,180
Yeah. It was between those

618
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,683
and a decanter of amaretto
in the shape of the pope.

619
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,185
He was the one who died
after a month,

620
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,688
so they had it on special.

621
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,689
Shoes.

622
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,192
Yeah. I just guessed your size.

623
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,195
If it's not right,
you can burn them.

624
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,698
Those shoes! Oh, Sandy!

625
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,201
The size is perfect.
I love them.

626
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:34,702
You do?

627
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,703
I'll wear them.

628
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,205
Thank you.

629
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,208
You're welcome.

630
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,215
It's a sculpture.

631
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,221
Nobody seems to like it,
so I'm taking it back.

632
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,725
What do you think of it?

633
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,228
Well, Holly, I could tell you,

634
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,731
but what difference
does it make, really?

635
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:09,236
You know? I mean, art is
a very personal thing, right?

636
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,239
What's important is
that you like it.

637
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,240
Right.

638
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,744
Even if you're
the only one who does.

639
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,749
I hope you don't mind.

640
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,252
I invited a friend of ours
to have dinner, too.

641
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,253
A friend?

642
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,754
Yeah, this guy works with Chip.

643
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,257
Oh, my God, is this
Saturday? I've got a...

644
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,260
No, no, no. Come on.
It's not a fix-up, or anything.

645
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,262
I know you said
you don't want to get involved.

646
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,263
That's right.

647
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:40,267
He's just this old friend.

648
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,270
Well, not actually old.
He's young.

649
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,273
And he's kind of
attractive, too.

650
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,275
You know,
in a quiet sort of way.

651
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,777
He's been divorced from his wife
for a couple of years,

652
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:51,778
and he's...

653
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:57,784
He's just really this nice guy.

654
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,786
But it's not a fix-up
or anything.

655
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,787
Uh-uh. No.

656
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,789
Mom, they're ready.

657
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,291
Want to come in
the kitchen with me?

658
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,293
There was a whole gallon
of it in there yesterday.

659
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,794
I didn't touch it, Jeff.

660
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,796
Yeah? Well, if you didn't eat
the rest of the ice cream

661
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,798
who did? Stanley?
I don't think...

662
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:15,302
Jeff, Kim. I'd like you
to meet Sandy.

663
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,804
Hi. Kim.

664
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:18,805
Sandy Dunlap.

665
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,307
Jeff, hi.

666
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,808
We see you on TV.

667
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,810
Aren't you the one
who interviewed my dad?

668
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,813
Your dad? When?

669
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,816
After the earthquake.
At the seismology center.

670
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,817
S-s-seismology?

671
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,320
I didn't know that.

672
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,322
W-what's his name?

673
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,823
Chip Davis.

674
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,826
Well, actually
it's Dr. Thomas Davis.

675
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:40,827
Well...

676
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,829
Yes?

677
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,331
Well, I sure did.

678
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:44,832
Nice meeting you.

679
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,333
Yeah, really.

680
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,334
Really.

681
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:51,838
If that isn't
the darndest coincidence.

682
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,841
Is Chip ever
going to be surprised.

683
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,848
Oh, my God!

684
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:12,859
You know, I really enjoyed
our talk the other night.

685
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,362
I just think it's so rare

686
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:19,366
that people can
get past the small talk

687
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,369
and into something real
so quickly, you know?

688
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,371
Yeah, it is...

689
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,374
Ah! There's Chip.

690
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,378
Well, at last!

691
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,880
I'm sorry. One of
the computers is on the blink.

692
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,383
That's okay.

693
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,887
Chip, you'll never guess
who's here.

694
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,389
Hi.

695
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,892
It's Sandy Dunlap.

696
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:46,893
What?

697
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,895
Ah, there's Harry.

698
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:52,900
No. I'll get it. You... why...?

699
00:35:58,906 --> 00:35:59,406
Hi.

700
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,408
Just be calm.

701
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,409
What?

702
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:07,414
Listen. I don't know
what's happening here, but...

703
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,415
Somehow, Holly
has just met Sandy.

704
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,916
She's in the kitchen right now.

705
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,418
Here? Sandy?

706
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,419
Mm-hm.

707
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,422
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

708
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,423
Is this your being calm?

709
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,426
Harry!

710
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:23,430
Hi. Empty-handed as usual, huh?

711
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,433
Well, I guess you know
Sandy, too, huh?

712
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,436
Sandy?

713
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:29,936
Well, yes. Hello.

714
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,439
Hello.

715
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,440
Lovely to see you again.

716
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,942
Thank you.

717
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,944
Aren't these nice?

718
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,946
Eh... This is for you.

719
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,448
Thank you.

720
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,950
Thank you very much.

721
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:43,951
Hmm...

722
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,955
And, oh yeah,
I saw this a few days ago,

723
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:53,460
and I thought it would
look nice in here, but...

724
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,461
I guess it doesn't, does it?

725
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,963
Yes, it does.
It looks wonderful.

726
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:00,467
How sweet. Just so
typically thoughtful.

727
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,971
Well, look, you two
get to know each other.

728
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:08,475
I mean, why don't you all
get to know each other?

729
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,977
I'll put these in water.

730
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,980
I'll help you.

731
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,984
Was that okay?

732
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,486
You were fine.

733
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,487
Are you sure? I don't know.

734
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,489
Can you just talk about
my problem for a minute?

735
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,490
Yeah, but do you think

736
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,491
that maybe I can
have a drink...?

737
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,994
Yeah, all right. Out here.

738
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,502
Does she know?

739
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,003
Does who know?

740
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,506
Holly. About you
and Sandy. Does she know?

741
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,008
No. No, I don't know.

742
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,510
How could she know?

743
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,012
I don't know.
Sandy could have told her.

744
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,514
Why would she do that?

745
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,016
I don't know!
God, this is awful!

746
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,018
Oh, thank you for
the wonderful insight.

747
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:52,519
Sorry.

748
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,021
Listen. Let me handle this.

749
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,523
Don't do anything
to give it away.

750
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,024
Sure.

751
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,027
Damn it, Stanley!

752
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,031
Oh!

753
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,532
Well, hello again.

754
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,033
Hello. Crab puff?

755
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,536
Ah, thank you, no.

756
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,543
I just can't get over the fact
that you know Sandy.

757
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,545
I know how you are
about meeting people,

758
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,046
so this is going
to make everything

759
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,549
so much more
comfortable for you.

760
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,052
Where is the damn corkscrew?

761
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:29,556
It's right there on the counter.
I put it out for you.

762
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,558
Why didn't you tell me,
instead of standing there,

763
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,060
watching me make an idiot
out of myself?

764
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,061
Hey, what's the matter?

765
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,564
Nothing.

766
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,065
Yeah, well, all right.

767
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:42,569
Coming home, hoping for
a nice, quiet little evening.

768
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,070
You know, a few drinks
with Harry,

769
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,071
some dinner,

770
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,074
and you spring
what's-her-name on me.

771
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,576
<i>I didn't spring her on you.</i>

772
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,077
<i>I told you she was coming over.</i>

773
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:51,578
<i>When?</i>

774
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,219
<i>The other night.</i>

775
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:57,084
After we made love.

776
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,587
<i>Maybe you were asleep.</i>

777
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,098
Ah...

778
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:19,606
These are great, just great.

779
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,608
I didn't make them.

780
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,110
No.

781
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:29,616
So, have you known Holly
a long time?

782
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:35,622
No. We just met the other night
at an exercise class.

783
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,624
Well, she's terrific,
she's just terrific.

784
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,627
You're going to
love her. Everybody does.

785
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,631
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

786
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:48,134
Are you trying to set her up
with Harry? Is that it?

787
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,136
No. Sandy said

788
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,139
she's already involved
with somebody.

789
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,643
But I have a feeling it's not
very satisfying for her.

790
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,147
Well, I don't think it's
any of your business, do you?

791
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:06,653
You know, don't go playing
matchmaker with my friends.

792
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,655
You know how much I hate that.

793
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,656
I never do that.

794
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:13,160
Well, I do. I hate it.

795
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,170
I knew I'd forget the rolls.

796
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,672
I even left
a big note for myself:

797
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,676
"Don't forget the rolls."

798
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,194
This veal was wonderful.

799
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,697
Thanks.

800
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,702
I wish I knew how to make it.

801
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:56,703
Me too.

802
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,205
I didn't know
you liked to cook.

803
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,708
I don't.

804
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,210
Me either.

805
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:07,214
Well, I knew you two
would have something in common.

806
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,719
Not that that's really
something in common,

807
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,221
not knowing how to cook.

808
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,222
It's really not.

809
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:20,727
Everybody has something
in common in one way or another.

810
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,730
You take Sandy and me.
We've got...

811
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,733
We've got aerobics.

812
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,735
Right.

813
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:36,743
Is the veal okay, Chip?

814
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,745
Yes, it's fine. Thank you.

815
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,246
As a matter of fact,
it's excellent.

816
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,749
I'm just not very hungry.

817
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,252
Oops...

818
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,253
Whoa!

819
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,255
Aftershock.

820
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,256
Well, Harry.

821
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,259
Maybe I ought to go down to
the lab and check it out?

822
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,260
What?

823
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,762
It was pretty small.

824
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,263
Small?
You think that was small?

825
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,765
Yes!

826
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,771
All right.

827
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,788
What are you looking for?

828
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,290
I'm hungry.

829
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,294
Well, maybe if you'd
eaten your dinner...

830
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,797
This is really a first.

831
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,298
I have never had a dinner party

832
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,801
where the guests
were home by 9:30.

833
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,310
You just put the milk
in the cupboard.

834
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,314
What is the matter
with you tonight, anyway?

835
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,315
Nothing.

836
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,316
Nothing?

837
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,318
First of all,
you made a big fuss

838
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,320
about my trying to put
Harry and Sandy together,

839
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:57,824
and I thought that
they got along just fine.

840
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,326
God...

841
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,328
"God..." What's that
supposed to mean, anyway?

842
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,830
He hated her.

843
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,331
He did not.

844
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:08,334
Listen. Just stop
trying to fix up stray women

845
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,335
with my friends, all right?

846
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:13,840
Okay. All right.
Fine. No problem.

847
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,351
Holly?

848
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,853
Yes?

849
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,357
I'm sorry.

850
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,360
Me too.

851
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:38,865
I don't know.

852
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:44,371
Sandy and Harry just seem,
you know, kind of lonely.

853
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,877
But maybe they
like it that way.

854
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,881
Oh... Er...

855
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,883
The pro-freeze rally
in Washington

856
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,885
is this Wednesday.

857
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,386
Is Harry going with you?

858
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,388
No. Just me.

859
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,890
With all the seismic activity,

860
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:07,393
they're afraid
to leave the lab shorthanded.

861
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,895
Oh.

862
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:14,400
I've been working at
what I'm going to say.

863
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,902
You're speaking?

864
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:16,403
Yeah.

865
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,404
Oh, Chip!

866
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:23,409
I'd love to go.
It's so expensive.

867
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,913
Anyway, I told Helga
I'd teach a few classes.

868
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:27,414
Well, do that.

869
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:28,915
Yeah? Okay.

870
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:36,923
Who knows? Maybe
I'll be on the TV again.

871
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,926
I love you.

872
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,929
I love you, too.

873
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:10,456
I've had Saturday nights
like that, too.

874
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,959
Want to bet?

875
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,471
Jesus...

876
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,479
Hi.

877
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,982
Tennis?

878
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,484
She thinks
I'm playing with Harry.

879
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,987
Why here,
instead of your place?

880
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,989
Because I really
don't want us to be alone.

881
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,492
Knowing you,
we'd just end up in...

882
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:48,494
Thank you.

883
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,496
You're welcome.

884
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:54,000
Can you possibly imagine what
I was going through last night?

885
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,501
Yeah, I think I can.

886
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:58,504
This wonderful woman
invites me to dinner,

887
00:45:58,505 --> 00:45:59,505
and she turns out to be...

888
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:04,510
Couldn't you have figured
it out? Davis... Davis.

889
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,013
Well, excuse me. I've met
a lot of people named Davis.

890
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:11,017
So far this is the first one
who turned out to be your wife.

891
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,019
Besides, she was always talking
about this guy "Chip"

892
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,522
she was married to, not tom.

893
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:19,525
Where did you get a name
like that, anyway? Chip.

894
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,027
Chip...

895
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,029
All right, when
we were first married...

896
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,033
Spare me, please.
Thank you. No cute stories.

897
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:37,543
So... Why didn't you tell me
you were happily married?

898
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:41,547
Hey! I never said
I was unhappily married.

899
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,549
No, but I just assumed.

900
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,553
Would it have made
any difference?

901
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,057
She is terrific, you know.

902
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,559
I know.

903
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,561
She's a wonderful person.

904
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:59,065
She's a great mother,
terrific wife...

905
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:02,068
Yeah. Gosh,
this is all making me feel

906
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,069
so much better. Thank you.

907
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,570
Listen. I love you.

908
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,072
No, don't. Ahh!

909
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:12,078
And I love her... Thank you.

910
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,081
I love her, too, but in
a completely different way.

911
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:18,084
With Holly, it's...

912
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:23,589
It's... okay, it's nice
and it's comfortable.

913
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,591
But with you it's...

914
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,093
Not nice, uncomfortable, what?

915
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:33,099
No. I'm stuck in this
"nice, comfortable" rut.

916
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,102
Just this
semi-dull academic type

917
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,104
going through the motions.

918
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,107
Wipe your nose.

919
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,609
And then I met you.

920
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,111
You are so...

921
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,612
So what?

922
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:51,117
Bright, attractive,
independent...

923
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:55,622
But Holly's bright
and attractive and...

924
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,626
Did you ever stop and think
she may not be independent

925
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,628
because you don't
want her to be?

926
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,130
Yes. No, no.

927
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,133
The difference is that you
would not have stood for that.

928
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,634
You still would have been
your own person.

929
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:11,137
And also make a lousy wife.

930
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:16,142
<i>I was a lousy wife. I have
the divorce papers to prove it.</i>

931
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,145
I'm not looking for a wife,

932
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,148
and you're not looking
for a husband.

933
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,151
Right?

934
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,159
Yeah, right.

935
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,163
Oh, God!
I wish you'd stop smoking!

936
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,666
I will, okay, I'll St...

937
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:43,169
I'll stop smoking,
but not now. I can't.

938
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:47,673
I can't give up these
and you at the same time.

939
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,677
Well, what else
are we going to do?

940
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,681
Look, I really wasn't
expecting this

941
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:57,183
to end like this, either.

942
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,186
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Look, let's...

943
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,689
Let's not talk about
ending anything until I...

944
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,694
Until I get back
from Washington.

945
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:11,197
It'll give us time.

946
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,200
Time for what?

947
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,702
To think.

948
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:22,708
No. I really don't need
more time to think, thank you.

949
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:27,714
I've done nothing else
but think for the last 12 hours.

950
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:33,719
I can't do this.
I don't want to do this.

951
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,223
Not now that I know her.

952
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,727
And I don't think
you do, either.

953
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:42,729
Right?

954
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:48,734
<i>Barbara, if you really
valued your friendship...</i>

955
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,736
How did it go?

956
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:54,240
She wants to break it off.

957
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,242
I know it's easy for me
to be philosophical,

958
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,744
but maybe it's for the best.

959
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:02,248
For the best? I love her,
for God's sake!

960
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,250
I know, I know.

961
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,252
But look what you've
been doing to yourself.

962
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:10,256
And to Holly, and even
to Sandy, too, in a way.

963
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,757
I mean, you're
not the kind of guy

964
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,260
who does this kind
of thing, you know?

965
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:20,266
I hate the sneaking around,

966
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:23,269
the secret phone calls,
all the lying...

967
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,271
It's been hard for me, too.

968
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,273
I know.

969
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,775
What does that...?
What do you mean?

970
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:32,778
Well, I mean lying for you.

971
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:36,282
Pretending to be playing tennis
with you when you're with Sandy.

972
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:39,785
Oh, I'm really sorry I've
caused you any pain here, Harry.

973
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,287
I just figured
a friend wouldn't mind.

974
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:44,290
There are limits, okay?
All right?

975
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,292
I mean,
Holly is my friend, too.

976
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:49,295
I hate talking to her
about our tennis games.

977
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,297
Having to make stuff up.

978
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,799
And why do you tell her
you win all the time?

979
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,301
Is that what's really
bothering you?

980
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,802
Fine, Harry, I'll tell her
that you won today.

981
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,304
You got any particular
score in mind?

982
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,806
No. What's bothering me is

983
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,809
seeing you risk losing Holly.
She's the best woman I know.

984
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:07,313
Well, if I do lose her, Harry,
maybe you'll have a shot at her.

985
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,315
I'll tell you what.

986
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,317
Come up here and talk to him

987
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,321
and I'll go back there
and blow your horn for you.

988
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,828
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

989
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:26,332
It's just really crazy.

990
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,834
It's okay.

991
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,845
Oh boy...

992
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,846
Mr. Hasegawa.

993
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,348
<i>Hai.</i>

994
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:46,352
Could you put
the paper on the porch

995
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,353
before you turn on
the sprinkler?

996
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,354
<i>Hai.</i>

997
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,356
Hi. I'd appreciate it.

998
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,358
It would save me having to
spread my paper out

999
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:55,861
on the kitchen floor to dry
before I can read it.

1000
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,863
Listen, I was wondering...

1001
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,866
Do you think that we could
brighten up this flower bed

1002
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:03,869
with anything at all? You know,
some tulips, or something.

1003
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,372
Tulips? Not in season.

1004
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:10,877
Okay... uh, pansies?

1005
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,879
No.

1006
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,383
Hell, paint it orange.
I don't care.

1007
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,890
Ugh...

1008
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,393
<i>Hi. I'm not home right now.</i>

1009
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,895
<i>I'm in the yard
feeding my attack dog.</i>

1010
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,897
<i>So if you'd like to leave</i>

1011
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,399
<i>your name and a message
after the beep,</i>

1012
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,902
<i>I'll call you back
as soon as I can. Bye.</i>

1013
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:42,408
<i>Hi Sandy. I wasn't sure
you got my message yesterday.</i>

1014
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:43,409
<i>Anyway, I just wanted to say</i>

1015
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,412
<i>that we've all missed you
at the gym.</i>

1016
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,414
<i>I mean, I've missed you.</i>

1017
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:52,918
<i>Also, Chip's out of town
until tomorrow, and I was...</i>

1018
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,920
<i>I wondered if you wanted
to have dinner tonight.</i>

1019
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,923
<i>Just us girls... Women.</i>

1020
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:00,426
<i>Anyway, you should at least
come to class.</i>

1021
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,428
<i>You don't want to
get out of shape.</i>

1022
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:06,932
<i>Not that you would. Anyway,
I hope I'll see you soon, okay?</i>

1023
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:12,939
<i>Did I say
this was Holly? Davis. Bye.</i>

1024
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:24,950
Hello.

1025
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,953
<i>Collect call from Dr. Davis
do you accept?</i>

1026
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,955
Yes, I'll accept, operator.

1027
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,457
Hi, it's me.

1028
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,960
Hi. How are you doing?

1029
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,962
I'm okay. How are you?

1030
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,965
Oh, just peachy, thanks.

1031
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,967
I was on my way to the rally,

1032
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:45,471
and I... I remembered
that's how we met.

1033
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:49,975
I got this overpowering urge
to call you.

1034
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,477
No, that's not true.

1035
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,480
I haven't stopped
thinking about you since I left.

1036
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,981
I don't want you
to think about me.

1037
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,483
I want you to think about Holly

1038
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,985
and Jeff and Kim and your dog.

1039
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,487
And I want you
to forget about me.

1040
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,990
I have tried that,
I really have.

1041
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,993
Look, I can't handle this
right now, okay?

1042
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:08,994
I've been out all night

1043
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,997
chasing a story
that led nowhere,

1044
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:15,000
and I got this message
on my machine from Holly and...

1045
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,502
Oh Jesus...

1046
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,003
I'm standing here
in my underwear,

1047
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:22,508
and this very happy Japanese
gentleman is staring at me.

1048
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:23,009
<i>What?</i>

1049
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,011
Just hang on for a second.

1050
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,513
Damn it.

1051
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,514
Yes?

1052
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,015
Geraniums.

1053
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,016
What about them?

1054
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,519
Always in season.

1055
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,023
Oh, great.
That would be great. Fine.

1056
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,024
What's that?

1057
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:44,530
<i>You've got money
for the geraniums?</i>

1058
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,531
<i>Oh, right.</i>

1059
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,033
Sandy, what's going on?

1060
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,037
Shit...

1061
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,540
<i>Sandy, what's going on?</i>

1062
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:59,545
Um, like, you caught me
at a really bad time.

1063
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,046
Um...

1064
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:04,550
<i>I can't talk to you now. Sorry.</i>

1065
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,052
All right, all right.
How about when I get back?

1066
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:11,056
No. No, we're not going to
start this up again.

1067
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:14,059
I know that.

1068
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,562
I just don't want to think
that I'll never see you again.

1069
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,566
Please don't
make this any worse

1070
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,568
than it already is, okay?

1071
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,570
I'm going to hang up now, okay?

1072
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,071
<i>I'll call you from the airport.</i>

1073
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,073
No. No. I have to hang up,
I really do.

1074
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,074
<i>Let me call you...</i>

1075
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,576
No, I'm going to hang up now.

1076
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,079
<i>I have to.</i>

1077
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,082
Goodbye.

1078
00:55:45,692 --> 00:55:49,195
Helen, I don't want a divorce.
No, that's not true.

1079
00:55:51,197 --> 00:55:55,701
10:30 or 11:00.
No later than that, unless I...

1080
00:56:00,206 --> 00:56:02,708
I'm working on my lead.

1081
00:56:02,709 --> 00:56:04,710
Most news people that I know

1082
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:06,211
tend to type their stories

1083
00:56:06,212 --> 00:56:08,213
rather than
write them out in longhand.

1084
00:56:08,214 --> 00:56:12,718
Oh yeah, I know, but I just got
these new porcelain nails.

1085
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:15,721
I broke one typing yesterday
just before we went on the air,

1086
00:56:15,722 --> 00:56:18,223
and I felt really
self-conscious about it.

1087
00:56:18,224 --> 00:56:20,225
We didn't get any calls on it.

1088
00:56:20,226 --> 00:56:25,231
By the way,
it's "nuclear," not "nucular."

1089
00:56:25,732 --> 00:56:27,232
Really?

1090
00:56:27,233 --> 00:56:28,734
Cross my heart.

1091
00:56:29,736 --> 00:56:33,238
George? Got a second?

1092
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:34,740
Just.

1093
00:56:34,741 --> 00:56:36,241
Before we have that talk,

1094
00:56:36,242 --> 00:56:38,744
I'd really like you
to take a look at this tape.

1095
00:56:38,745 --> 00:56:40,245
Why? What is it?

1096
00:56:40,246 --> 00:56:41,747
Just bits and pieces
of things I've done

1097
00:56:41,748 --> 00:56:44,249
over the past couple of years.
Things I'm kind of proud of.

1098
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:46,251
You know, just in case
you missed any of them.

1099
00:56:46,252 --> 00:56:49,255
George, I'll be in make-up.

1100
00:56:50,256 --> 00:56:53,258
I'd really like you
to look at it, George.

1101
00:56:53,259 --> 00:56:58,263
Not once on the tape do I say
"nucular" or "Letch" Walesa,

1102
00:56:58,264 --> 00:57:01,767
or, ha, "s. Q.U.A.T. Team".
You'll be amazed.

1103
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:04,770
Look, I think that I can
understand your frustration,

1104
00:57:04,771 --> 00:57:06,772
but what goes on around here

1105
00:57:06,773 --> 00:57:08,273
is not entirely
my responsibility.

1106
00:57:08,274 --> 00:57:10,275
George. I think you may want to

1107
00:57:10,276 --> 00:57:12,277
make this
our new lead for 6:00.

1108
00:57:12,278 --> 00:57:13,278
What is it?

1109
00:57:13,279 --> 00:57:15,280
You know, there was
this pro-freeze rally

1110
00:57:15,281 --> 00:57:16,782
in Washington today.

1111
00:57:16,783 --> 00:57:18,283
Yeah. What about it?

1112
00:57:18,284 --> 00:57:20,786
Well, one of the speakers
was Dr. Phillip Lorring.

1113
00:57:20,787 --> 00:57:23,789
Didn't he win a Nobel prize
a couple of years ago?

1114
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:26,792
Right. And after the...
After the rally,

1115
00:57:26,793 --> 00:57:28,794
he was on his way back
in a rainstorm,

1116
00:57:28,795 --> 00:57:31,296
and the cab he was in
was in an accident,

1117
00:57:31,297 --> 00:57:34,299
and he and the other
passenger were killed.

1118
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,801
I don't like to
lead with something

1119
00:57:35,802 --> 00:57:37,803
that doesn't have
a local angle.

1120
00:57:37,804 --> 00:57:39,304
Oh yeah, it does.

1121
00:57:39,305 --> 00:57:44,309
The guy was from Pasadena.
Some seismologist.

1122
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:47,813
Hey, what's the matter? Sandy?

1123
00:57:52,819 --> 00:57:57,823
6, 7, 8, and reach and reach.
Let's go, let's go.

1124
00:57:57,824 --> 00:58:01,326
Look down. Let's smile.
Come on, have fun.

1125
00:58:01,327 --> 00:58:04,329
And the waist and the waist
and the waist and the waist.

1126
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:06,832
Keep going,
keep going, keep going.

1127
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,836
And twist, and smile.
Keep going, keep going.

1128
00:58:11,337 --> 00:58:13,839
Come on.

1129
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,843
Sandy needs to talk to you.
I will take over.

1130
00:58:18,344 --> 00:58:24,850
To the floor, 2, 3, 4.
To the side, 2, 3, 4.

1131
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:29,354
To the floor, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1132
00:58:29,355 --> 00:58:34,359
And reach, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1133
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:40,866
To the side,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1134
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:03,388
<i>I don't know how she does it.</i>

1135
00:59:03,389 --> 00:59:06,392
<i>I can't believe
how well she's holding up.</i>

1136
00:59:11,898 --> 00:59:13,398
<i>When the elections come up,</i>

1137
00:59:13,399 --> 00:59:14,900
<i>the interest rates
are going to go up.</i>

1138
00:59:14,901 --> 00:59:17,403
<i>Well, my broker
told me to wait.</i>

1139
00:59:20,406 --> 00:59:23,409
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Davis.

1140
00:59:29,916 --> 00:59:33,920
<i>We don't have any
firm policy in central America.</i>

1141
00:59:36,923 --> 00:59:38,925
Here, let me.

1142
00:59:39,425 --> 00:59:41,427
It's all right.

1143
00:59:42,929 --> 00:59:47,432
Oh, Holly. Any time, mmm?

1144
00:59:47,433 --> 00:59:48,433
Yes.

1145
00:59:48,434 --> 00:59:50,435
You'll call? Mmm? Mmm?

1146
00:59:50,436 --> 00:59:52,437
<i>I heard that
they're back together.</i>

1147
00:59:52,438 --> 00:59:55,441
<i>No, I heard that
they are living together.</i>

1148
00:59:56,943 --> 00:59:58,944
<i>With his lifestyle...</i>

1149
00:59:58,945 --> 01:00:00,445
<i>The restaurants
in San Francisco</i>

1150
01:00:00,446 --> 01:00:02,447
<i>are so much better.</i>

1151
01:00:02,448 --> 01:00:04,449
<i>Because I know him, that's why.</i>

1152
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:06,451
Holly.

1153
01:00:06,452 --> 01:00:07,953
<i>She looks good, doesn't she?</i>

1154
01:00:07,954 --> 01:00:09,455
<i>Sure does.</i>

1155
01:00:22,468 --> 01:00:24,970
Chip loved you guys.

1156
01:00:24,971 --> 01:00:27,472
You and the kids.

1157
01:00:27,473 --> 01:00:29,975
You were
the whole world to him.

1158
01:00:31,477 --> 01:00:33,479
He loved you, too.

1159
01:00:34,981 --> 01:00:37,984
Who are you going to get
to play tennis with?

1160
01:00:38,985 --> 01:00:41,987
I guess I'll have to
find somebody.

1161
01:00:41,988 --> 01:00:43,989
Nobody as good as him, though.

1162
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:46,993
He beat me
every time we played.

1163
01:00:48,494 --> 01:00:51,496
Thank you for the flowers.
They're just beautiful.

1164
01:00:51,497 --> 01:00:52,998
I hope you don't mind
my sending them here

1165
01:00:52,999 --> 01:00:57,002
instead of the funeral home?
I figured...

1166
01:00:57,003 --> 01:00:59,505
I loved the thought.

1167
01:01:08,014 --> 01:01:09,514
I'd better get this out,

1168
01:01:09,515 --> 01:01:12,017
they're starting to eat
with their fingers.

1169
01:01:12,018 --> 01:01:14,519
The creepy minister, he
keeps following me around

1170
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:18,023
trying to persuade me to join
his Episcopal youth choir.

1171
01:01:18,024 --> 01:01:21,526
Maybe you should.
You have a very sweet voice.

1172
01:01:21,527 --> 01:01:25,030
Grandma! I'm an agnostic!

1173
01:01:25,031 --> 01:01:27,532
So you can hum.

1174
01:01:27,533 --> 01:01:30,035
Grandma!

1175
01:01:31,537 --> 01:01:34,039
Holly tells me
you interviewed Chip on TV.

1176
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,041
Is that how you all met?

1177
01:01:36,042 --> 01:01:38,543
Yeah. Well, kind of.

1178
01:01:38,544 --> 01:01:41,046
<i>I mean, that's how I met him.</i>

1179
01:01:41,047 --> 01:01:45,050
But I met Holly
at an exercise class.

1180
01:01:45,051 --> 01:01:48,053
And then she invited me
over for dinner,

1181
01:01:48,054 --> 01:01:50,556
and then I met him again, here.

1182
01:01:51,557 --> 01:01:53,058
Small world.

1183
01:01:53,059 --> 01:01:54,559
Yeah. Very.

1184
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,560
Oh!

1185
01:01:55,561 --> 01:01:57,563
My God! Look what I did.

1186
01:02:01,567 --> 01:02:03,568
Goodbye, Uncle Harold.

1187
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:06,071
Be brave.

1188
01:02:06,072 --> 01:02:08,073
Helga! You came.

1189
01:02:08,074 --> 01:02:10,575
Of course I came. Here.

1190
01:02:10,576 --> 01:02:13,078
I'm sorry I'm so late.

1191
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:14,579
What is this?

1192
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:18,083
It's the money I owe you.
Don't tell the other girls.

1193
01:02:23,589 --> 01:02:25,090
Listen...

1194
01:02:25,091 --> 01:02:28,093
We want to see you
a lot. Don't we, bill?

1195
01:02:28,094 --> 01:02:29,594
Sure do.

1196
01:02:29,595 --> 01:02:31,596
Thanks.

1197
01:02:31,597 --> 01:02:34,099
It's just so good
seeing you again.

1198
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,601
<i>It kills me that it took this</i>

1199
01:02:36,602 --> 01:02:38,603
for us to get together,
you know.

1200
01:02:38,604 --> 01:02:41,106
You are the last person
in the world

1201
01:02:41,107 --> 01:02:44,609
that something like this
should have happened to.

1202
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:48,613
Listen, if there's
anything we can do,

1203
01:02:48,614 --> 01:02:51,116
just anything at all...

1204
01:02:51,117 --> 01:02:53,118
Want to stay and vacuum?

1205
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:54,119
What?

1206
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,121
That was a joke, Andrea.

1207
01:02:56,122 --> 01:02:57,122
It was just a little joke.

1208
01:02:57,123 --> 01:02:58,623
She's kidding, Andy.

1209
01:02:58,624 --> 01:03:02,127
Oh... bill, is she wonderful?

1210
01:03:02,128 --> 01:03:05,131
Joking at a time like this.

1211
01:03:06,632 --> 01:03:10,135
You're fabulous.
Do you know that?

1212
01:03:10,136 --> 01:03:12,137
Well, I...

1213
01:03:12,138 --> 01:03:13,638
Know that.

1214
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:15,140
Okay.

1215
01:03:17,643 --> 01:03:20,145
Anything at all, now, you hear?

1216
01:03:20,146 --> 01:03:21,647
Thanks.

1217
01:03:43,669 --> 01:03:46,671
Holly, come on.
Put that down. I'll get it.

1218
01:03:46,672 --> 01:03:49,174
Will you sit down, please?

1219
01:03:49,175 --> 01:03:51,177
Okay.

1220
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,681
I don't know how
I'd have gotten through this day

1221
01:03:56,682 --> 01:03:59,184
without you and Harry.

1222
01:03:59,185 --> 01:04:02,188
This day? The whole week.

1223
01:04:03,689 --> 01:04:07,693
You guys too.
You've been terrific.

1224
01:04:09,195 --> 01:04:11,696
It all just seems so unreal.

1225
01:04:11,697 --> 01:04:13,198
Totally.

1226
01:04:18,204 --> 01:04:21,206
I've got to tell you, Hol...

1227
01:04:21,207 --> 01:04:24,209
Holly?

1228
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:26,711
I can't believe your mom.

1229
01:04:26,712 --> 01:04:28,213
My mom?

1230
01:04:28,214 --> 01:04:30,216
Yeah. She's exactly like mine.

1231
01:04:31,217 --> 01:04:32,717
She is?

1232
01:04:32,718 --> 01:04:37,222
Hearing yours talk
was just like being at home,

1233
01:04:37,223 --> 01:04:39,724
except... Except
I'm crazy about yours

1234
01:04:39,725 --> 01:04:43,228
and mine would have me
climbing the fucking walls.

1235
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:46,731
<i>The darn walls...</i>

1236
01:04:46,732 --> 01:04:50,235
Don't worry, Sandy.
It's nothing I haven't said.

1237
01:04:50,736 --> 01:04:52,738
Or done.

1238
01:04:59,745 --> 01:05:01,746
I'm so tired.

1239
01:05:01,747 --> 01:05:05,750
Oh, sweetie, I know.
We're all exhausted.

1240
01:05:05,751 --> 01:05:07,752
Why don't you go to bed, huh?

1241
01:05:07,753 --> 01:05:09,254
I'll come in and
say good night in a minute.

1242
01:05:09,255 --> 01:05:11,757
Okay. Good night.

1243
01:05:12,758 --> 01:05:15,761
Good night. Sleep tight.

1244
01:05:16,762 --> 01:05:17,762
Good night, Sandy.

1245
01:05:17,763 --> 01:05:20,265
Sweet dreams.

1246
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:27,773
This hasn't hit her yet.

1247
01:05:29,275 --> 01:05:30,776
It will.

1248
01:05:33,279 --> 01:05:35,781
I woke up last night...

1249
01:05:37,783 --> 01:05:43,288
and then I realized
that I'm never...

1250
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:47,293
Oh, sweetie.

1251
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,800
<i>Nobody's saying</i>

1252
01:05:55,801 --> 01:05:58,803
<i>that we ought to
just unilaterally disarm.</i>

1253
01:05:58,804 --> 01:06:00,305
<i>I mean,
nobody's kidding themselves</i>

1254
01:06:00,306 --> 01:06:03,808
<i>that the Russians are
a bunch of nice guys.</i>

1255
01:06:03,809 --> 01:06:05,810
<i>But our own leaders
ought to realize</i>

1256
01:06:05,811 --> 01:06:09,814
<i>that it's in the Soviet's best
interest as well as our own</i>

1257
01:06:09,815 --> 01:06:14,819
<i>to stop escalating this
suicidal "nucular" arms race.</i>

1258
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:19,324
<i>Did I say "nucular"?
I mean "nuclear." "Nuclear."</i>

1259
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,361
Hi, you guys.

1260
01:06:55,861 --> 01:06:56,861
Hi.

1261
01:06:56,862 --> 01:06:57,862
Is your mom around?

1262
01:06:57,863 --> 01:07:00,865
She's still in bed.
We didn't want to wake her.

1263
01:07:00,866 --> 01:07:01,866
She hasn't been sleeping well.

1264
01:07:01,867 --> 01:07:03,868
I hear her up in the middle
of the night.

1265
01:07:03,869 --> 01:07:05,870
I thought I'd try to get her
out of the house.

1266
01:07:05,871 --> 01:07:07,372
Maybe go play some tennis,
or something.

1267
01:07:07,373 --> 01:07:09,374
That's a great idea.

1268
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:12,377
I'll pay you guys
to wash my car.

1269
01:07:12,378 --> 01:07:14,379
Or paint it...

1270
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:15,880
<i>Jeff.</i>

1271
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:16,882
<i>What?</i>

1272
01:07:18,384 --> 01:07:19,885
Holly?

1273
01:07:21,887 --> 01:07:23,889
Hol?

1274
01:07:28,894 --> 01:07:30,395
I'm awake.

1275
01:07:31,397 --> 01:07:33,399
Oh. Good.

1276
01:07:37,403 --> 01:07:42,907
I just thought you might like
to know it's 1988.

1277
01:07:42,908 --> 01:07:43,908
Thank you.

1278
01:07:43,909 --> 01:07:46,911
You've been asleep now
for about 2.5 years.

1279
01:07:46,912 --> 01:07:50,415
Let's see. Peace has broken out
in the middle east.

1280
01:07:50,416 --> 01:07:52,917
Robert Redford
is our new president.

1281
01:07:52,918 --> 01:07:55,420
And... oh, Holly.

1282
01:07:55,421 --> 01:07:57,422
They've discovered
this great new diet.

1283
01:07:57,423 --> 01:08:00,925
All junk food.
Doritos and ding dongs.

1284
01:08:00,926 --> 01:08:04,429
I'm happy for you.

1285
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:07,932
All right, bones. Up and at 'em!
Get your ass out of bed

1286
01:08:07,933 --> 01:08:10,935
because we're going to
go play some tennis. Come on!

1287
01:08:10,936 --> 01:08:14,439
I don't play tennis.
It was Chip's game.

1288
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,440
Do you mean to tell me

1289
01:08:15,441 --> 01:08:17,942
that I went out and
bought this outfit and a racket,

1290
01:08:17,943 --> 01:08:19,444
and you don't even play?

1291
01:08:19,445 --> 01:08:22,447
Well, you look like
you play tennis.

1292
01:08:22,448 --> 01:08:26,951
Yeah... well, I look like I know
how to do a lot of things

1293
01:08:26,952 --> 01:08:30,455
that I don't know how to do.

1294
01:08:30,456 --> 01:08:32,957
Okay. All right,
so you don't play tennis.

1295
01:08:32,958 --> 01:08:35,460
Neither do I.
We're perfectly matched.

1296
01:08:35,461 --> 01:08:39,464
Come on, Holly. Let's go out
and have some laughs, huh?

1297
01:08:39,465 --> 01:08:43,968
God, I am so scared.

1298
01:08:43,969 --> 01:08:47,472
What the hell am I going to do?

1299
01:08:48,974 --> 01:08:50,475
Um...

1300
01:08:51,977 --> 01:08:54,979
Look, I think maybe it's just
sunk in what's happened.

1301
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,481
No, no, no...

1302
01:08:56,482 --> 01:09:01,987
I mean, literally,
what am I going to do?

1303
01:09:02,988 --> 01:09:04,990
Chip was always here for me.

1304
01:09:05,991 --> 01:09:08,493
Now that he's gone, I just...

1305
01:09:08,494 --> 01:09:12,997
I feel like I'm half a person.

1306
01:09:12,998 --> 01:09:15,500
No, you're not.
What do you mean?

1307
01:09:15,501 --> 01:09:20,505
God, it's so hard to get out
of this bed in the morning.

1308
01:09:20,506 --> 01:09:22,006
And you know why?

1309
01:09:22,007 --> 01:09:23,508
Because I know
I've got to go out there

1310
01:09:23,509 --> 01:09:25,511
and look for a job.

1311
01:09:26,512 --> 01:09:29,013
I know the feeling.

1312
01:09:29,014 --> 01:09:31,516
Hey, you'll find one.

1313
01:09:31,517 --> 01:09:37,021
Doing what? Driving car pools?
Making lunches? Setting tables?

1314
01:09:37,022 --> 01:09:38,023
Maybe you could teach?

1315
01:09:39,525 --> 01:09:41,025
Teach what?

1316
01:09:41,026 --> 01:09:42,027
Table-setting.

1317
01:09:51,036 --> 01:09:52,036
Oh God!

1318
01:09:52,037 --> 01:09:56,541
I mean, what was the actual
last job that I had? Hmm?

1319
01:09:56,542 --> 01:09:59,043
What about the gym?
You could teach that.

1320
01:09:59,044 --> 01:10:01,546
Helga can't even
pay me, remember?

1321
01:10:01,547 --> 01:10:04,048
That's not the only gym
in Los Angeles.

1322
01:10:04,049 --> 01:10:06,050
She only hired me
because she was desperate.

1323
01:10:06,051 --> 01:10:09,053
That's not true.
You're great at it.

1324
01:10:09,054 --> 01:10:14,559
Still, I'd like to get a job
where they might pay me money.

1325
01:10:36,582 --> 01:10:39,083
Holly...

1326
01:10:39,084 --> 01:10:39,584
Yeah?

1327
01:10:45,591 --> 01:10:48,092
I just don't think
it's very healthy for you

1328
01:10:48,093 --> 01:10:52,096
to keep his clothes in there.

1329
01:10:52,097 --> 01:10:54,098
Well, yeah...

1330
01:10:54,099 --> 01:10:57,602
I keep thinking I'll save them
for Jeff, and I...

1331
01:10:57,603 --> 01:10:59,604
Yeah. Right.

1332
01:10:59,605 --> 01:11:03,608
So, are we going to
go play tennis, or what?

1333
01:11:03,609 --> 01:11:05,109
Oh! Yes!

1334
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:07,612
Absolutely. Let's go.

1335
01:11:11,617 --> 01:11:14,118
Well, now that
looks like a fun job.

1336
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:17,622
I wonder if they
have any openings?

1337
01:11:17,623 --> 01:11:22,628
No, those are handed down,
father to son.

1338
01:11:23,629 --> 01:11:29,133
Listen, I have an idea. I think
you should buy Helga out.

1339
01:11:29,134 --> 01:11:30,134
What?

1340
01:11:30,135 --> 01:11:32,637
She's ready to go belly-up.

1341
01:11:32,638 --> 01:11:34,639
You could get that place
for a song.

1342
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,141
I don't know anything
about running a gym.

1343
01:11:37,142 --> 01:11:40,144
She doesn't know anything
about running a gym.

1344
01:11:40,145 --> 01:11:43,147
Plus, you're much better
with people than she is.

1345
01:11:43,148 --> 01:11:45,650
Oh, come on.
Don't say you're not.

1346
01:11:45,651 --> 01:11:46,651
Yeah, well, who isn't?

1347
01:11:46,652 --> 01:11:48,653
Plus you're smarter
than she is,

1348
01:11:48,654 --> 01:11:50,655
plus you give better classes
than she does.

1349
01:11:50,656 --> 01:11:52,657
Plus, I know if you thought
about it for 10 seconds,

1350
01:11:52,658 --> 01:11:54,659
you'd have great ideas

1351
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:58,663
about how to turn that rat hole
into a winning proposition.

1352
01:11:58,664 --> 01:12:01,666
Yeah, but... Even if I did,
you're forgetting something.

1353
01:12:01,667 --> 01:12:03,167
I don't have any money.

1354
01:12:03,168 --> 01:12:05,670
What do you mean?
Didn't Chip leave you anything?

1355
01:12:05,671 --> 01:12:07,672
Yeah. But it's going
to be months

1356
01:12:07,673 --> 01:12:10,175
before it's out of probate.

1357
01:12:11,176 --> 01:12:14,679
I've got over 8,000 bucks

1358
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,681
in my maternity fund.

1359
01:12:16,682 --> 01:12:20,685
I could lend it to you.
I guarantee she'd grab it.

1360
01:12:20,686 --> 01:12:22,687
Then you can get a loan
for the rest of it.

1361
01:12:22,688 --> 01:12:25,189
No! That's your baby money.
I can't take that.

1362
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:26,691
Don't worry.
I can have a baby later.

1363
01:12:26,692 --> 01:12:28,192
Uh-uh. No, look.

1364
01:12:28,193 --> 01:12:31,696
<i>If I did it, I'd wait
until the estate is settled.</i>

1365
01:12:31,697 --> 01:12:34,198
No. You can't wait
until then, because if you do,

1366
01:12:34,199 --> 01:12:35,700
Helga will have gone bankrupt

1367
01:12:35,701 --> 01:12:37,702
and there won't be
anything to buy.

1368
01:12:37,703 --> 01:12:40,204
Do it now.
Timing is everything.

1369
01:12:40,205 --> 01:12:45,210
Sandy, I can't borrow
money from you.

1370
01:12:46,712 --> 01:12:49,213
Okay, okay...

1371
01:12:49,214 --> 01:12:52,717
I'll tell you what.
We'll be partners and go halves.

1372
01:12:52,718 --> 01:12:57,722
I'll put up the money,
and you work your ass off.

1373
01:12:57,723 --> 01:12:59,224
What do you say?

1374
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:08,233
So, mom, what do you think?

1375
01:13:09,234 --> 01:13:11,235
You don't have to
do this, you know.

1376
01:13:11,236 --> 01:13:13,738
I mean, you could have come to
your father and me for help.

1377
01:13:13,739 --> 01:13:17,242
Yeah, I do have to do this.

1378
01:13:18,243 --> 01:13:20,244
And it's not just
for the money.

1379
01:13:20,245 --> 01:13:22,246
I understand.

1380
01:13:22,247 --> 01:13:25,249
You know, when you
went away to college,

1381
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:27,251
your father gave me $5,000

1382
01:13:27,252 --> 01:13:29,253
to open up a little
needlepoint shop

1383
01:13:29,254 --> 01:13:31,255
with Edith Carter.

1384
01:13:31,256 --> 01:13:32,256
I didn't know that.

1385
01:13:32,257 --> 01:13:34,258
Well, actually,
I changed my mind

1386
01:13:34,259 --> 01:13:35,760
and put my money in IBM.

1387
01:13:35,761 --> 01:13:39,263
Oh, poor Edith.
She went bankrupt in six months.

1388
01:13:39,264 --> 01:13:40,765
This is cute.

1389
01:13:40,766 --> 01:13:42,767
You know, that wall over there
should be white

1390
01:13:42,768 --> 01:13:44,268
to bring out that red clock.

1391
01:13:44,269 --> 01:13:46,771
But I just took the paint
off the wall

1392
01:13:46,772 --> 01:13:48,773
you know, to show the brick.

1393
01:13:48,774 --> 01:13:50,776
Oh... oh, well.

1394
01:13:52,778 --> 01:13:55,780
Look at this. Huh?
I was going over Helga's books

1395
01:13:55,781 --> 01:13:58,783
and I found out that she was
spending an absolute fortune

1396
01:13:58,784 --> 01:14:00,284
on this terrible towel service.

1397
01:14:00,285 --> 01:14:01,285
Mm-hm.

1398
01:14:01,286 --> 01:14:02,787
And, so I figured out

1399
01:14:02,788 --> 01:14:05,289
that I could pay for this
washer and dryer in six months

1400
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:07,291
if I did the towels myself.

1401
01:14:07,292 --> 01:14:11,295
You know what? You were always
wonderful at math.

1402
01:14:11,296 --> 01:14:13,798
Why don't you try bookkeeping?

1403
01:14:13,799 --> 01:14:17,301
No, mom. I want to try this.

1404
01:14:17,302 --> 01:14:20,805
It'll be fine.
Everything's under control.

1405
01:14:20,806 --> 01:14:22,307
Really.

1406
01:14:39,825 --> 01:14:42,326
<i>And it's hit up the
alley between right and center.</i>

1407
01:14:42,327 --> 01:14:45,329
<i>Two runs are in. The cubs go...</i>

1408
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:46,831
Hi.

1409
01:14:47,332 --> 01:14:48,332
Oh, hi.

1410
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:52,837
I was painting when you called.

1411
01:14:52,838 --> 01:14:55,339
I didn't mean you had to
do this right away.

1412
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:57,842
No, no, no. I've put it off
long enough. Really.

1413
01:14:57,843 --> 01:15:01,346
And I'm sorry. I'm sure
you could have used the space.

1414
01:15:02,848 --> 01:15:03,849
Are you okay?

1415
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:06,350
Sure. Why?

1416
01:15:06,351 --> 01:15:09,353
Well, you look awful.

1417
01:15:09,354 --> 01:15:11,355
Like you haven't shaved
in a couple of days.

1418
01:15:11,356 --> 01:15:15,360
Oh, I... I thought
I'd try growing a beard.

1419
01:15:16,361 --> 01:15:19,364
Oh! It's very becoming.

1420
01:15:20,365 --> 01:15:21,366
Yeah.

1421
01:15:40,886 --> 01:15:43,889
I picked up some boxes
at the market.

1422
01:15:45,891 --> 01:15:48,392
Thanks.

1423
01:15:48,393 --> 01:15:52,397
If you ever need to talk,
I'm available.

1424
01:15:53,398 --> 01:15:54,398
Maybe we could go out.

1425
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:56,901
I mean, not for a date,
or anything,

1426
01:15:56,902 --> 01:16:00,404
but just for dinner
and to talk about things.

1427
01:16:00,405 --> 01:16:04,408
I thought you might have
a lot of time on your hands.

1428
01:16:04,409 --> 01:16:07,912
I know I did when Natalie
and I got divorced.

1429
01:16:09,915 --> 01:16:14,919
Oh, yeah, that would be...
Yes, I'd like that.

1430
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:17,922
It's just that
right now I'm so busy.

1431
01:16:17,923 --> 01:16:19,423
You know, starting
the new business with Sandy.

1432
01:16:19,424 --> 01:16:21,926
Yes. Whenever.

1433
01:16:23,929 --> 01:16:26,931
Whatever you don't want,
just leave.

1434
01:16:26,932 --> 01:16:30,435
I'll help you
carry the stuff out to the car.

1435
01:18:27,552 --> 01:18:29,053
Oh...

1436
01:18:34,059 --> 01:18:36,061
Oh...

1437
01:18:41,566 --> 01:18:44,068
Catch Carla and catch...

1438
01:18:44,069 --> 01:18:45,569
Oh! Damn it!

1439
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:47,071
Geez, I'm sorry, Sandy.

1440
01:18:47,072 --> 01:18:49,573
All right, Janet.
It's just these damn cups.

1441
01:18:49,574 --> 01:18:52,076
The handles aren't
strong enough to hold on to.

1442
01:18:52,077 --> 01:18:52,577
Here.

1443
01:18:52,578 --> 01:18:54,078
That's all right, Janet.

1444
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:56,080
Hey, hey, hey.
Sit down, all right.

1445
01:18:56,081 --> 01:18:58,583
I'll get you
another cup of tea.

1446
01:19:10,595 --> 01:19:12,096
Oh!

1447
01:19:16,101 --> 01:19:18,602
You seem a little jumpy.

1448
01:19:18,603 --> 01:19:20,104
Just a tad.

1449
01:19:20,105 --> 01:19:23,107
I haven't had a coffee
or a cigarette in a week.

1450
01:19:23,108 --> 01:19:25,610
The doctor told me
I had to give them up.

1451
01:19:26,111 --> 01:19:30,115
No. Junk food, too.

1452
01:19:32,617 --> 01:19:36,120
I've finally had a chance
to look at your tape.

1453
01:19:36,121 --> 01:19:37,622
So?

1454
01:19:39,124 --> 01:19:41,125
What did you think?

1455
01:19:41,126 --> 01:19:44,629
I think you've been doing
field reporting too long.

1456
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:46,630
Oh.

1457
01:19:46,631 --> 01:19:50,134
What I mean is, I think there
are a lot of people around here

1458
01:19:50,135 --> 01:19:52,136
who haven't really appreciated

1459
01:19:52,137 --> 01:19:54,638
what good work
you've been doing.

1460
01:19:54,639 --> 01:19:58,642
Well, thank you.
That's terrific. Thanks.

1461
01:19:58,643 --> 01:20:00,644
You know...

1462
01:20:00,645 --> 01:20:02,146
Phil's leaving
in a couple of weeks

1463
01:20:02,147 --> 01:20:04,648
to take that job in Boston.

1464
01:20:04,649 --> 01:20:10,154
Which leaves the 6:00
anchor job opposite Carla open.

1465
01:20:11,656 --> 01:20:13,157
Right?

1466
01:20:13,158 --> 01:20:17,162
I'm... I'm going to
move Jim into that.

1467
01:20:18,663 --> 01:20:20,164
Right.

1468
01:20:21,666 --> 01:20:26,170
Which opens up his spot,
6:00 on the weekends.

1469
01:20:26,171 --> 01:20:28,172
Uh-huh.

1470
01:20:28,173 --> 01:20:30,674
So what I'm going to do is,

1471
01:20:30,675 --> 01:20:36,180
I'm going to try Pete out
in that spot on Sundays.

1472
01:20:36,181 --> 01:20:37,681
Right.

1473
01:20:37,682 --> 01:20:41,185
And you on Saturday.

1474
01:20:41,186 --> 01:20:42,186
Really?

1475
01:20:42,187 --> 01:20:43,187
Mm-hm.

1476
01:20:43,188 --> 01:20:44,188
Do you mean it?

1477
01:20:44,189 --> 01:20:44,689
Mm-hm.

1478
01:20:44,690 --> 01:20:48,692
Oh, George! That's wonderful.

1479
01:20:48,693 --> 01:20:51,195
I won't let you down, I promise.
You count on it.

1480
01:20:51,196 --> 01:20:52,697
Oh, great!

1481
01:21:00,705 --> 01:21:03,707
I want to see Sandy Dunlap.
She works here.

1482
01:21:03,708 --> 01:21:05,209
You got an appointment?

1483
01:21:05,210 --> 01:21:08,712
No, I'm a friend of...

1484
01:21:08,713 --> 01:21:11,215
I'm a friend of hers!

1485
01:21:11,216 --> 01:21:13,717
What's the name?
I'll see if there's a pass.

1486
01:21:13,718 --> 01:21:16,720
There won't be.
She wasn't expecting me.

1487
01:21:16,721 --> 01:21:18,722
But if you just call her...
I see her car,

1488
01:21:18,723 --> 01:21:19,724
so I know she's...

1489
01:21:22,227 --> 01:21:23,728
There she is. There she is!

1490
01:21:24,729 --> 01:21:25,730
Hey!

1491
01:21:28,733 --> 01:21:30,234
Hey!

1492
01:21:30,235 --> 01:21:33,738
Buck, it's okay.
She's a friend of mine.

1493
01:21:36,241 --> 01:21:37,742
I'll meet you over there.

1494
01:21:44,249 --> 01:21:48,252
Hey, partner!
What are you doing here?

1495
01:21:48,253 --> 01:21:49,753
I thought you were
supposed to be painting

1496
01:21:49,754 --> 01:21:52,256
or plastering, or something.

1497
01:21:52,257 --> 01:21:53,257
Oh...

1498
01:21:53,258 --> 01:21:55,759
I am so glad to see you.

1499
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:58,763
I just got the most
incredible news, and I'm...

1500
01:22:04,269 --> 01:22:06,771
Holly? Hey, Hol...

1501
01:22:07,772 --> 01:22:11,275
Is something wrong?

1502
01:22:11,276 --> 01:22:16,780
I just got back from
cleaning out Chip's office.

1503
01:22:16,781 --> 01:22:19,783
Oh, Hol. It must
have been terrible.

1504
01:22:19,784 --> 01:22:23,787
It's his whole life
right in these boxes.

1505
01:22:23,788 --> 01:22:29,794
His books, papers,
stuff the kids made...

1506
01:22:30,795 --> 01:22:33,297
Pictures.

1507
01:22:34,799 --> 01:22:37,802
All kinds of pictures.

1508
01:22:43,308 --> 01:22:46,811
Oh God! Oh shit!

1509
01:22:50,815 --> 01:22:53,317
Holly, um...

1510
01:22:53,318 --> 01:22:56,820
I was going to
tell you about this. I...

1511
01:22:56,821 --> 01:22:59,823
No, I'm glad you didn't.
It was...

1512
01:22:59,824 --> 01:23:02,826
It was so much better
to find out this way.

1513
01:23:02,827 --> 01:23:05,329
Holly. I didn't know you
when I met him.

1514
01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:07,331
If I had, this never
would have happened.

1515
01:23:07,332 --> 01:23:08,832
You've got to believe me.

1516
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:12,336
It's all right as long as
you don't know the wife.

1517
01:23:12,337 --> 01:23:14,338
Is that what you're saying?

1518
01:23:14,339 --> 01:23:15,339
No. Of course not.

1519
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:18,342
But as soon as I realized,
I ended it.

1520
01:23:18,343 --> 01:23:19,843
That's the truth, Holly.

1521
01:23:19,844 --> 01:23:24,848
Am I supposed to thank you,
or something?

1522
01:23:24,849 --> 01:23:27,851
Look, we really can't
talk about this here.

1523
01:23:27,852 --> 01:23:30,854
I'm going to pay you back
every penny.

1524
01:23:30,855 --> 01:23:34,858
I don't want your guilt money.

1525
01:23:34,859 --> 01:23:38,862
It wasn't that, Holly.
I really...

1526
01:23:38,863 --> 01:23:41,365
I really wanted to help you.

1527
01:23:41,366 --> 01:23:42,866
I love you,

1528
01:23:42,867 --> 01:23:46,370
and I just wanted
to be your friend.

1529
01:23:47,872 --> 01:23:51,876
Friend? Friend?!

1530
01:23:56,881 --> 01:23:59,884
You're not my friend!

1531
01:24:02,887 --> 01:24:07,391
But I need one, Holly.
I'm pregnant.

1532
01:24:24,409 --> 01:24:25,909
Here's my card.

1533
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:27,411
Thanks. Have a good practice.

1534
01:24:27,412 --> 01:24:29,413
Hello. Shaping up.
May I help you?

1535
01:24:29,414 --> 01:24:30,914
<i>Holly Davis, please.</i>

1536
01:24:30,915 --> 01:24:34,418
Yes. She's just about finished.
Can you hold?

1537
01:24:34,419 --> 01:24:34,919
<i>Okay.</i>

1538
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,420
Okay, thanks.

1539
01:24:37,922 --> 01:24:38,922
Telephone.

1540
01:24:38,923 --> 01:24:40,925
Oh. Hey, that tape is great.

1541
01:24:41,926 --> 01:24:43,427
Hello.

1542
01:24:43,428 --> 01:24:46,430
<i>It's Sandy.
I really need to talk.</i>

1543
01:24:46,431 --> 01:24:50,935
Yeah, well, I don't
want to talk to you.

1544
01:24:59,944 --> 01:25:00,944
Damn it!

1545
01:25:00,945 --> 01:25:02,946
There goes dad
after that gopher again.

1546
01:25:02,947 --> 01:25:04,448
Easy, dad!

1547
01:25:04,449 --> 01:25:05,949
He almost broke
his ankle the other day,

1548
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:07,951
falling in one of those holes.

1549
01:25:07,952 --> 01:25:11,455
My money is on the gopher.

1550
01:25:11,456 --> 01:25:12,456
Mom?

1551
01:25:12,457 --> 01:25:13,958
Yeah.

1552
01:25:14,959 --> 01:25:17,961
I need to borrow $8,000.

1553
01:25:17,962 --> 01:25:20,964
Ah... running a business
isn't easy, huh?

1554
01:25:20,965 --> 01:25:23,467
No, mom, it's not the business.
The business is fine.

1555
01:25:23,468 --> 01:25:26,970
Really? Then what
do you want it for?

1556
01:25:26,971 --> 01:25:30,474
I borrowed it from Sandy,
and I want to pay her back.

1557
01:25:30,475 --> 01:25:33,477
I've got to pay her back.

1558
01:25:33,478 --> 01:25:36,980
I found out she was
having an affair with Chip.

1559
01:25:36,981 --> 01:25:39,483
Oh...

1560
01:25:39,484 --> 01:25:41,985
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

1561
01:25:41,986 --> 01:25:42,986
What do you...?

1562
01:25:42,987 --> 01:25:46,990
I mean, I picked up some clues.

1563
01:25:46,991 --> 01:25:49,493
Why didn't I
pick up some clues?

1564
01:25:49,494 --> 01:25:50,994
Probably because
you didn't want to.

1565
01:25:50,995 --> 01:25:53,497
You were too close to Sandy.

1566
01:25:53,498 --> 01:25:57,501
I mean, that...
That happens sometimes.

1567
01:25:57,502 --> 01:26:00,003
Where did you learn
so much about this?

1568
01:26:00,004 --> 01:26:02,005
Well, you know, women talk

1569
01:26:02,006 --> 01:26:05,509
and, you know,
they tell you things about...

1570
01:26:07,512 --> 01:26:09,513
That's a lie.

1571
01:26:09,514 --> 01:26:14,519
Honey, I went through
the same thing with your father.

1572
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,520
What?

1573
01:26:16,521 --> 01:26:17,521
Yeah.

1574
01:26:17,522 --> 01:26:21,525
My sweet little old father
had an affair?

1575
01:26:21,526 --> 01:26:23,026
He wasn't so old,

1576
01:26:23,027 --> 01:26:26,530
and he certainly wasn't sweet
when it went on, but he did.

1577
01:26:26,531 --> 01:26:28,031
My God!

1578
01:26:28,032 --> 01:26:30,033
<i>That jolt you felt this morning</i>

1579
01:26:30,034 --> 01:26:32,035
<i>was still another
in a series of aftershocks</i>

1580
01:26:32,036 --> 01:26:34,538
<i>that have followed
the August 28 earthquake</i>

1581
01:26:34,539 --> 01:26:36,039
<i>that hit
just west of riverside.</i>

1582
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:38,042
<i>It measured
5.3 on the Richter scale.</i>

1583
01:26:39,043 --> 01:26:41,044
<i>The tax tables may be turned.</i>

1584
01:26:41,045 --> 01:26:43,547
<i>Congress is announcing
a plan to audit the...</i>

1585
01:26:51,055 --> 01:26:53,057
Well, look who's here.

1586
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:58,562
That's all of it.
The whole 8,000. Plus...

1587
01:26:58,563 --> 01:27:00,564
You could have just mailed it.

1588
01:27:00,565 --> 01:27:04,568
Yes, I know. But I wanted
to say something to you

1589
01:27:04,569 --> 01:27:07,071
that I think I have to say
face-to-face.

1590
01:27:08,072 --> 01:27:09,072
What's that?

1591
01:27:09,073 --> 01:27:11,575
When you and I first met,

1592
01:27:11,576 --> 01:27:15,078
you said you wanted
to have a baby with some man.

1593
01:27:15,079 --> 01:27:16,580
But I didn't know the man
you were talking about

1594
01:27:16,581 --> 01:27:18,582
was my husband.

1595
01:27:18,583 --> 01:27:20,584
No, neither did I.

1596
01:27:20,585 --> 01:27:25,589
Well, I was just wondering,
under the circumstances,

1597
01:27:25,590 --> 01:27:29,092
I mean, you know, considering
everything that's happened,

1598
01:27:29,093 --> 01:27:30,594
if you're absolutely certain...

1599
01:27:30,595 --> 01:27:34,097
The only thing that
I am absolutely certain of,

1600
01:27:34,098 --> 01:27:36,099
is that you are
the last person in the world

1601
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:38,602
I want to discuss this with.

1602
01:27:53,618 --> 01:27:54,618
Hello, hello.

1603
01:27:54,619 --> 01:27:56,620
Hi, mom.

1604
01:27:56,621 --> 01:27:58,622
Hi. Hi, Stanley.

1605
01:27:58,623 --> 01:27:59,623
Where have you been?

1606
01:27:59,624 --> 01:28:01,625
I've been learning
a new billing system.

1607
01:28:01,626 --> 01:28:02,626
On Saturday?

1608
01:28:02,627 --> 01:28:03,127
Yeah.

1609
01:28:03,128 --> 01:28:04,127
You're working too hard.

1610
01:28:04,128 --> 01:28:05,128
I'm enjoying it.

1611
01:28:05,129 --> 01:28:07,130
But you should be
getting out once in a while.

1612
01:28:07,131 --> 01:28:08,131
Have some fun.

1613
01:28:08,132 --> 01:28:11,635
I don't have time for fun.
I've got too much to do.

1614
01:28:11,636 --> 01:28:12,636
<i>It's the second time</i>

1615
01:28:12,637 --> 01:28:14,638
<i>the city has
been devastated by floods.</i>

1616
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:17,641
Haven't you got anything
better to do than to watch TV?

1617
01:28:17,642 --> 01:28:19,142
It's the news, mom.

1618
01:28:19,143 --> 01:28:20,644
Yeah, well, okay.

1619
01:28:20,645 --> 01:28:22,145
If you want news,
read a newspaper.

1620
01:28:22,146 --> 01:28:23,146
Hi, mom.

1621
01:28:23,147 --> 01:28:24,147
Hi.

1622
01:28:24,148 --> 01:28:26,149
Is that who it sounds like?

1623
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:27,651
She's anchorwoman now.

1624
01:28:27,652 --> 01:28:29,152
Mm-hm.

1625
01:28:29,153 --> 01:28:31,154
How come we never
see Sandy anymore?

1626
01:28:31,155 --> 01:28:34,158
Well, you know,
I've been awful busy.

1627
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:38,161
Well, to tell you the truth,

1628
01:28:38,162 --> 01:28:40,664
she and I had
a kind of a falling-out.

1629
01:28:41,165 --> 01:28:43,667
What about?

1630
01:28:43,668 --> 01:28:45,168
I don't want to get into it.

1631
01:28:45,169 --> 01:28:46,670
Is there any chance you guys

1632
01:28:46,671 --> 01:28:47,671
could patch things up?

1633
01:28:47,672 --> 01:28:48,672
No.

1634
01:28:48,673 --> 01:28:50,674
Too bad. She's cool.

1635
01:28:50,675 --> 01:28:53,177
Yeah, I really miss her.

1636
01:28:54,178 --> 01:28:55,679
Really.

1637
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,180
<i>Scientists at the California</i>

1638
01:28:57,181 --> 01:28:58,682
<i>seismological center...</i>

1639
01:29:14,198 --> 01:29:17,200
I just can't get over
how much Heather has grown.

1640
01:29:17,201 --> 01:29:18,702
Hi, dad!

1641
01:29:18,703 --> 01:29:20,704
She seems to grow from
one weekend that I have her

1642
01:29:20,705 --> 01:29:22,706
to the next.

1643
01:29:22,707 --> 01:29:24,708
In-between,
I just have to be satisfied

1644
01:29:24,709 --> 01:29:26,710
with watching her on tapes.

1645
01:29:26,711 --> 01:29:30,213
"Video daddy." That's me.

1646
01:29:30,214 --> 01:29:32,716
I made some cassettes
of the two of us

1647
01:29:32,717 --> 01:29:34,718
and sent them home
with her once.

1648
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:37,220
Natalie said
they didn't fit her machine.

1649
01:29:37,221 --> 01:29:41,224
It seems
I'm Betamax and she's VHS.

1650
01:29:41,225 --> 01:29:45,229
It gives you some idea of
what our marriage was like.

1651
01:29:49,734 --> 01:29:51,234
I like your beard.

1652
01:29:51,235 --> 01:29:51,735
Really?

1653
01:29:51,736 --> 01:29:53,236
Yeah.

1654
01:29:53,237 --> 01:29:54,738
Natalie hates it.

1655
01:29:54,739 --> 01:29:56,740
Screw Natalie.

1656
01:29:56,741 --> 01:29:57,741
Can we go on this, daddy?

1657
01:29:57,742 --> 01:30:00,744
I'm really glad you called.

1658
01:30:00,745 --> 01:30:02,746
It's wonderful seeing you.

1659
01:30:02,747 --> 01:30:04,748
It's good seeing you.

1660
01:30:04,749 --> 01:30:07,752
It's been too long.

1661
01:30:10,755 --> 01:30:13,256
Hurry up, Heather.
We're catching up with you.

1662
01:30:13,257 --> 01:30:14,758
Hi, Holly.

1663
01:30:18,262 --> 01:30:20,263
You look terrific.

1664
01:30:20,264 --> 01:30:21,765
Thanks.

1665
01:30:25,269 --> 01:30:27,270
I don't know if this is
the right time for me

1666
01:30:27,271 --> 01:30:29,273
to be saying this, but...

1667
01:30:31,275 --> 01:30:34,278
I guess I've always been
attracted to you.

1668
01:30:35,279 --> 01:30:37,280
I know.

1669
01:30:37,281 --> 01:30:39,783
What? You do?

1670
01:30:42,787 --> 01:30:46,790
Was I that obvious?

1671
01:30:46,791 --> 01:30:48,792
Pretty obvious.

1672
01:30:48,793 --> 01:30:51,795
Oh, my God.

1673
01:30:51,796 --> 01:30:54,297
Do you think Chip knew it, too?

1674
01:30:54,298 --> 01:30:56,800
Oh sure. We talked about it.

1675
01:30:56,801 --> 01:30:59,302
It didn't really bother him.

1676
01:30:59,303 --> 01:31:01,805
It didn't...

1677
01:31:01,806 --> 01:31:05,308
I suppose he didn't consider
me a threat, right? Is that it?

1678
01:31:05,309 --> 01:31:07,811
No, no, no, no.
It was just that he...

1679
01:31:07,812 --> 01:31:08,812
you were friends.

1680
01:31:08,813 --> 01:31:11,315
Friends don't do that
to each other.

1681
01:31:12,817 --> 01:31:15,319
Some friends...

1682
01:31:17,822 --> 01:31:19,824
Hi, daddy!

1683
01:31:23,828 --> 01:31:28,331
Did Chip ever say anything
to you about having an affair?

1684
01:31:28,332 --> 01:31:30,834
Chip? An affair?

1685
01:31:30,835 --> 01:31:34,337
I'm not asking you
if he had an affair.

1686
01:31:34,338 --> 01:31:37,340
I know he had
an affair with Sandy.

1687
01:31:37,341 --> 01:31:38,341
Oh...

1688
01:31:38,342 --> 01:31:42,345
I'm asking if he said anything.

1689
01:31:42,346 --> 01:31:45,849
Yes. But I know
he felt awful about it.

1690
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:48,351
I mean, he didn't
go looking for it.

1691
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:51,855
It just happened. Really.

1692
01:31:51,856 --> 01:31:53,858
I don't know...

1693
01:31:58,863 --> 01:32:04,367
Maybe he needed some variety
for sex, or something.

1694
01:32:04,368 --> 01:32:05,869
Did he ever talk
to you about that?

1695
01:32:05,870 --> 01:32:08,872
Was it sex?

1696
01:32:08,873 --> 01:32:10,874
Oh... Gee, I...

1697
01:32:10,875 --> 01:32:13,376
Is this making you
uncomfortable?

1698
01:32:13,377 --> 01:32:15,379
Yes, it is.

1699
01:32:19,383 --> 01:32:20,884
Because if it was sex,

1700
01:32:20,885 --> 01:32:22,886
you know, he didn't
have to go anywhere else.

1701
01:32:22,887 --> 01:32:25,388
I mean, because our own
sex-life was really good.

1702
01:32:25,389 --> 01:32:26,890
You know, at least it was...

1703
01:32:26,891 --> 01:32:28,893
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1704
01:32:30,895 --> 01:32:32,395
I really need
to know something,

1705
01:32:32,396 --> 01:32:35,899
and I want you
to tell me the truth, okay?

1706
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:37,902
I will.

1707
01:32:39,904 --> 01:32:46,409
Do you...? Do you think
that I really mattered to him?

1708
01:32:46,410 --> 01:32:48,411
I mean, he told me that I did,

1709
01:32:48,412 --> 01:32:51,915
but it's really important for me
to know for sure.

1710
01:32:53,417 --> 01:32:54,417
You meant the world to him.

1711
01:32:54,418 --> 01:32:56,419
I'm looking for
the word "love," here.

1712
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:58,922
Did he ever use that word
in relationship to me?

1713
01:32:58,923 --> 01:33:02,426
Yes. Love. Absolutely.

1714
01:33:02,927 --> 01:33:04,929
He did, didn't he?

1715
01:33:06,430 --> 01:33:08,932
Yeah...

1716
01:33:08,933 --> 01:33:12,435
Yeah... I mean, it sure couldn't
have been for the sex.

1717
01:33:12,436 --> 01:33:16,440
It wasn't all that red-hot,
if you want to know the truth.

1718
01:33:17,942 --> 01:33:19,943
Oh, I'm sorry. Is this
making you uncomfortable?

1719
01:33:19,944 --> 01:33:22,445
No, no, no, no.

1720
01:33:22,446 --> 01:33:25,448
It really wasn't that good.

1721
01:33:25,449 --> 01:33:28,451
That's what makes
all of this so ironic.

1722
01:33:28,452 --> 01:33:31,454
Makes what ironic?

1723
01:33:31,455 --> 01:33:32,956
I'm pregnant.

1724
01:33:32,957 --> 01:33:34,457
Yeah, I know.

1725
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:35,458
How...?

1726
01:33:35,459 --> 01:33:39,462
Well, Holly sort of
mentioned it to me.

1727
01:33:39,463 --> 01:33:42,966
Oh yeah.

1728
01:33:42,967 --> 01:33:45,468
But what I wondered was,

1729
01:33:45,469 --> 01:33:46,970
how do you feel about it?

1730
01:33:50,474 --> 01:33:52,475
I don't know.

1731
01:33:52,476 --> 01:33:54,978
The timing sucks.

1732
01:33:54,979 --> 01:33:57,480
I mean, I really thought
I wanted to have a baby,

1733
01:33:57,481 --> 01:34:00,483
but this is going to be tougher
than I thought.

1734
01:34:00,484 --> 01:34:03,486
See, I didn't think
I needed anybody

1735
01:34:03,487 --> 01:34:05,488
to go through this with.

1736
01:34:05,489 --> 01:34:07,490
But if I do this...

1737
01:34:07,491 --> 01:34:09,993
I mean, I'm going to want
natural childbirth.

1738
01:34:09,994 --> 01:34:13,998
How do you go through that
without a partner? Right?

1739
01:34:27,511 --> 01:34:30,013
Mom, do you remember
when I made this?

1740
01:34:30,014 --> 01:34:32,015
Oh yeah. My favorite.

1741
01:34:32,016 --> 01:34:33,516
Shit!

1742
01:34:33,517 --> 01:34:34,517
Jeff!

1743
01:34:34,518 --> 01:34:38,021
Mom, this is the third one
that hasn't worked.

1744
01:34:38,022 --> 01:34:39,522
I have to go through
the whole goddamn string

1745
01:34:39,523 --> 01:34:41,024
just to find the light
that's burnt out.

1746
01:34:41,025 --> 01:34:43,526
I don't care.
It's no way to talk

1747
01:34:43,527 --> 01:34:46,029
while you're decorating
a Christmas tree.

1748
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:48,031
Dad used to say even worse stuff
when he did it.

1749
01:34:48,032 --> 01:34:52,036
Yeah, well, that's a tradition
we can do without.

1750
01:34:54,038 --> 01:34:57,040
Of course, if you want to stay
that way for a couple of weeks,

1751
01:34:57,041 --> 01:34:58,162
maybe we could decorate you.

1752
01:34:59,543 --> 01:35:03,046
It's going to be weird
this Christmas without him.

1753
01:35:03,047 --> 01:35:03,547
Really...

1754
01:35:03,548 --> 01:35:05,048
Why don't we just remember

1755
01:35:05,049 --> 01:35:07,050
all the great
Christmas squabbles

1756
01:35:07,051 --> 01:35:08,551
we've had in the past?

1757
01:35:08,552 --> 01:35:10,554
He'd like that.

1758
01:35:15,559 --> 01:35:16,560
Oh...

1759
01:35:18,062 --> 01:35:20,063
Hello.

1760
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:21,565
Hello.

1761
01:35:24,068 --> 01:35:26,070
Can we talk?

1762
01:35:37,581 --> 01:35:41,584
Do you remember
when you paid me my money back?

1763
01:35:41,585 --> 01:35:43,086
Yeah.

1764
01:35:44,588 --> 01:35:49,092
Well, you paid me interest.
Interest?

1765
01:35:49,093 --> 01:35:53,596
I would have had to pay interest
if I'd borrowed it from a bank.

1766
01:35:53,597 --> 01:35:56,599
I'm not a bank. I...

1767
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,102
I was your friend at the time
you borrowed it,

1768
01:35:59,103 --> 01:36:05,108
and I really resent you
putting a dollar value on it.

1769
01:36:05,109 --> 01:36:10,614
Especially when
it was only 7.5%.

1770
01:36:15,619 --> 01:36:17,620
I was wrong to
have paid you interest.

1771
01:36:17,621 --> 01:36:20,623
Yes, you were.

1772
01:36:20,624 --> 01:36:23,126
I figured you could use it.

1773
01:36:24,128 --> 01:36:25,629
Oh...

1774
01:36:27,631 --> 01:36:30,133
"Poor Sandy."

1775
01:36:30,134 --> 01:36:31,134
No!

1776
01:36:31,135 --> 01:36:32,135
I don't need your charity.

1777
01:36:32,136 --> 01:36:35,638
Now, just you wait a minute!

1778
01:36:35,639 --> 01:36:37,640
The last time I saw you,

1779
01:36:37,641 --> 01:36:38,641
you weren't sure whether or not

1780
01:36:38,642 --> 01:36:40,643
you were going to
have the baby.

1781
01:36:40,644 --> 01:36:43,646
And I just want you
to know that I've...

1782
01:36:43,647 --> 01:36:45,649
I've changed my mind.
I think you should.

1783
01:36:46,650 --> 01:36:51,154
Gosh. I just think
this is real swell.

1784
01:36:51,155 --> 01:36:52,655
I mean, this is just terrific

1785
01:36:52,656 --> 01:36:55,658
that you've had this
personal breakthrough. Really.

1786
01:36:55,659 --> 01:36:59,663
But guess what?
I don't need your blessing.

1787
01:37:20,684 --> 01:37:24,187
So, I'll see you
in a few minutes.

1788
01:37:27,191 --> 01:37:30,693
Do you want me
to come with you?

1789
01:37:30,694 --> 01:37:33,696
No. I just want to
see the baby.

1790
01:37:33,697 --> 01:37:37,200
Don't you want to
see Sandy, too?

1791
01:37:37,201 --> 01:37:39,203
No. Not really.

1792
01:37:57,221 --> 01:37:59,723
It's a boy?

1793
01:38:07,731 --> 01:38:10,733
Are you going to
keep doing this?

1794
01:38:10,734 --> 01:38:11,734
Are you going to
keep sneaking around,

1795
01:38:11,735 --> 01:38:13,736
peeking in windows
at his birthday parties,

1796
01:38:13,737 --> 01:38:16,239
and wearing a fake mustache
at his little league games?

1797
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:17,240
No, Sandy.

1798
01:38:17,241 --> 01:38:20,743
If you are,
I'll leave town right now.

1799
01:38:20,744 --> 01:38:23,246
I just... Wanted to see him.

1800
01:38:23,247 --> 01:38:27,250
Oh... well,
you've seen him, right?

1801
01:38:27,251 --> 01:38:29,253
So leave.

1802
01:38:51,775 --> 01:38:54,777
Okay, I'm leaving. Don't worry.

1803
01:38:54,778 --> 01:38:56,279
I just want to ask you
one question.

1804
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:57,780
Stephen.

1805
01:38:57,781 --> 01:38:58,781
Stephen?

1806
01:38:58,782 --> 01:39:00,783
The baby's name.

1807
01:39:00,784 --> 01:39:02,285
Wasn't that your question?

1808
01:39:02,286 --> 01:39:03,786
No.

1809
01:39:03,787 --> 01:39:05,789
<i>Hi, how are you?</i>

1810
01:39:10,294 --> 01:39:14,298
Did Chip ever say
he was unhappily married?

1811
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:17,300
No.

1812
01:39:17,301 --> 01:39:18,301
Then why?

1813
01:39:18,302 --> 01:39:21,805
I don't know.
Besides, that's two questions.

1814
01:39:23,807 --> 01:39:26,309
Sandy, I want you
to meet the rest of...

1815
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:28,311
Excuse us,
this is kind of private.

1816
01:39:28,312 --> 01:39:29,812
Oh, well.

1817
01:39:29,813 --> 01:39:31,814
I'm supposed to breast-feed
right now. Excuse me.

1818
01:39:31,815 --> 01:39:36,319
Marci. See, that's what's really
so neat about breast-feeding.

1819
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,320
You can do it anywhere.

1820
01:39:37,321 --> 01:39:40,823
She's right. Women in India
do it on buses.

1821
01:39:40,824 --> 01:39:41,825
Well, yeah, but...

1822
01:39:52,336 --> 01:39:56,839
God, she's such a ditz.

1823
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:02,345
She has more flowers
than a goddamn rose bowl parade,

1824
01:40:02,346 --> 01:40:05,849
and she never even waters them.

1825
01:40:09,853 --> 01:40:12,855
Well, I guess it's
easy to figure out

1826
01:40:12,856 --> 01:40:15,358
why he was attracted to you.

1827
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:18,361
<i>I was attracted to you.</i>

1828
01:40:18,362 --> 01:40:20,863
You're so different from me.

1829
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:25,368
So funny and open.

1830
01:40:25,869 --> 01:40:28,871
Interesting.

1831
01:40:28,872 --> 01:40:33,877
Then there's me,
this boring housewife.

1832
01:40:34,878 --> 01:40:36,379
You're not boring.

1833
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:40,883
Maybe not now,
but I think I was.

1834
01:40:40,884 --> 01:40:42,886
It's true.

1835
01:40:44,888 --> 01:40:48,391
God, it's crazy, isn't it?

1836
01:40:48,392 --> 01:40:51,894
Now that he's dead,
I've gotten to be somebody

1837
01:40:51,895 --> 01:40:53,396
who'd be more
interesting to him

1838
01:40:53,397 --> 01:40:56,899
than I was when he was alive.

1839
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:59,902
Don't you love this?

1840
01:40:59,903 --> 01:41:01,404
He's been dead eight months,

1841
01:41:01,405 --> 01:41:03,907
and I'm trying to
save our marriage.

1842
01:41:09,913 --> 01:41:12,415
It was worth saving.

1843
01:41:14,418 --> 01:41:16,920
Was it?

1844
01:41:17,921 --> 01:41:21,924
Holly. He made a mistake.

1845
01:41:21,925 --> 01:41:25,928
A real big mistake.

1846
01:41:25,929 --> 01:41:29,432
But look at what you had.

1847
01:41:29,433 --> 01:41:32,936
You had something so special.

1848
01:41:33,937 --> 01:41:35,938
And he knew that.

1849
01:41:35,939 --> 01:41:38,441
And you knew that.

1850
01:41:38,442 --> 01:41:40,444
And you would have
forgiven him.

1851
01:41:42,946 --> 01:41:46,949
Because what you had,

1852
01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:48,952
you don't throw away.

1853
01:41:55,459 --> 01:41:58,462
What about what we had?

1854
01:42:09,973 --> 01:42:12,475
We could have
taken a cab, you know.

1855
01:42:12,476 --> 01:42:15,479
A cab? Why not a bus?

1856
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:19,482
Take care, Mrs. Dunlap.

1857
01:42:19,483 --> 01:42:21,484
Mrs. Dunlap?

1858
01:42:21,485 --> 01:42:24,987
Yeah. What do they got to know?

1859
01:42:24,988 --> 01:42:28,991
They're too goddamn nosy,
anyway.

1860
01:42:28,992 --> 01:42:30,994
Bye.

1861
01:42:33,997 --> 01:42:35,999
Yes...

1862
01:42:41,004 --> 01:42:44,006
"Thanks for one of the most
wonderful experiences

1863
01:42:44,007 --> 01:42:48,010
of my life. Love, Harry."

1864
01:42:48,011 --> 01:42:51,514
Yeah... see, I decided to
go for natural childbirth,

1865
01:42:51,515 --> 01:42:54,016
and you need a partner.

1866
01:42:54,017 --> 01:42:57,520
Harry? Our Harry?

1867
01:42:57,521 --> 01:42:59,522
Yeah. Harry.

1868
01:42:59,523 --> 01:43:01,524
Well, that's...

1869
01:43:01,525 --> 01:43:03,025
I mean, I've been
going to the movies

1870
01:43:03,026 --> 01:43:06,028
and dinner with him for months.
He never said a thing.

1871
01:43:06,029 --> 01:43:07,029
Oh, don't worry about it.

1872
01:43:07,030 --> 01:43:09,031
I mean, it was nothing intimate,
or anything.

1873
01:43:09,032 --> 01:43:10,533
He just happened to see

1874
01:43:10,534 --> 01:43:13,537
every single, conceivable
part of my body.

1875
01:43:14,538 --> 01:43:18,541
Can you go slower?
I'm walking backwards.

1876
01:43:18,542 --> 01:43:23,045
Come on, Stephen.
Spit up for Uncle Harry.

1877
01:43:23,046 --> 01:43:24,547
Would you believe
he tried to bring

1878
01:43:24,548 --> 01:43:27,049
that damn thing into
the delivery room with him?

1879
01:43:27,050 --> 01:43:28,050
But they wouldn't let him.

1880
01:43:28,051 --> 01:43:29,051
<i>You wouldn't let me.</i>

1881
01:43:29,052 --> 01:43:32,054
Well, it wasn't exactly
my best side, was it?

1882
01:43:32,055 --> 01:43:33,556
Watch it.

1883
01:43:33,557 --> 01:43:36,058
Can we do that again?
I blew that.

1884
01:43:36,059 --> 01:43:38,060
Can you sit down in
the chair once more, and...

1885
01:43:38,061 --> 01:43:39,562
Harry, come on!

1886
01:43:39,563 --> 01:43:42,565
Well, like, I really got
to get this chair back.

1887
01:43:42,566 --> 01:43:44,568
Oh, all right. Sorry.

1888
01:43:49,072 --> 01:43:52,075
Enough, enough. Go!

1889
01:43:54,077 --> 01:43:57,079
You went through
Lamaze training with Sandy?

1890
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:59,081
She asked me to.

1891
01:43:59,082 --> 01:44:01,584
You never said anything.

1892
01:44:01,585 --> 01:44:04,086
She asked me not to.

1893
01:44:04,087 --> 01:44:07,590
Well, I think it's terrific.

1894
01:44:09,092 --> 01:44:12,595
Anything else
you haven't told me?

1895
01:44:12,596 --> 01:44:15,098
As a matter of fact, there is.

1896
01:44:18,602 --> 01:44:19,603
Ah...

1897
01:44:20,604 --> 01:44:21,604
Wai...

1898
01:44:21,605 --> 01:44:23,106
Could you...?

1899
01:44:24,608 --> 01:44:27,610
You don't just
say something like that,

1900
01:44:27,611 --> 01:44:31,114
and then walk away...

1901
01:44:38,121 --> 01:44:40,123
What's wrong?

1902
01:44:42,125 --> 01:44:45,628
I'm going to be
the worst mother.

1903
01:44:45,629 --> 01:44:46,629
No, you're not.

1904
01:44:46,630 --> 01:44:49,131
Yes, I am,
and he knows it, too.

1905
01:44:49,132 --> 01:44:52,134
He's bit me every time
I've nursed him.

1906
01:44:52,135 --> 01:44:56,138
I'm going to be the
shittiest mother of all time.

1907
01:44:56,139 --> 01:44:59,141
Come on, I said
the same thing myself.

1908
01:44:59,142 --> 01:45:01,143
So did Natalie.

1909
01:45:01,144 --> 01:45:03,646
Of course, she was.

1910
01:45:03,647 --> 01:45:06,649
Why did I ever think
I could do this?

1911
01:45:06,650 --> 01:45:10,153
Because you can. You will.

1912
01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:18,160
Look what a good mother
you are.

1913
01:45:18,161 --> 01:45:21,164
Look how good you are at this.

1914
01:45:22,165 --> 01:45:26,168
Oh God, this is so disgusting.

1915
01:45:26,169 --> 01:45:28,170
What is?

1916
01:45:28,171 --> 01:45:30,673
I like this.

1917
01:45:35,178 --> 01:45:36,679
<i>Look out, here he comes again.</i>

1918
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:38,181
<i>Oh God...</i>

1919
01:45:40,684 --> 01:45:42,685
<i>What? Oh.</i>

1920
01:45:42,686 --> 01:45:45,688
<i>Okay, just a second. Say "hi."</i>

1921
01:45:45,689 --> 01:45:46,689
Ahh...

1922
01:45:46,690 --> 01:45:48,691
Hi, Stevie.

1923
01:45:48,692 --> 01:45:49,692
<i>Hey, Hol.</i>

1924
01:45:49,693 --> 01:45:50,693
<i>Mmm?</i>

1925
01:45:50,694 --> 01:45:53,696
<i>At what age
do they stop drooling?</i>

1926
01:45:53,697 --> 01:45:57,199
<i>Well, let's see. Jeff's 17,</i>

1927
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:59,202
<i>and you should see his pillow.</i>

1928
01:46:01,705 --> 01:46:03,205
<i>Harry, will you come on!</i>

1929
01:46:03,206 --> 01:46:04,207
<i>Harry!</i>

1930
01:46:06,209 --> 01:46:07,209
Wham!

1931
01:46:07,210 --> 01:46:08,211
Bam!

1932
01:46:09,212 --> 01:46:10,212
Sorry.

1933
01:46:10,213 --> 01:46:11,714
That's all I got.

1934
01:46:11,715 --> 01:46:13,716
Unless you want to...

1935
01:46:13,717 --> 01:46:14,717
Unless you want to go for

1936
01:46:14,718 --> 01:46:16,719
a little
national geographic stuff?

1937
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:18,722
Harry, forget it!

1938
01:46:21,224 --> 01:46:24,727
Oh look! Is Heather adorable!

1939
01:46:24,728 --> 01:46:26,729
Harry, you didn't
tape over Heather, did you?

1940
01:46:26,730 --> 01:46:28,731
That's okay. I've got Miles
of this stuff.

1941
01:46:28,732 --> 01:46:30,232
When was it shot?

1942
01:46:30,233 --> 01:46:32,735
I don't know.
I guess last summer.

1943
01:46:32,736 --> 01:46:34,236
<i>Give me the camera.</i>

1944
01:46:34,237 --> 01:46:35,237
Who did it?

1945
01:46:35,238 --> 01:46:36,238
I don't remember.

1946
01:46:36,239 --> 01:46:38,240
<i>Come on, you jerk.</i>

1947
01:46:38,241 --> 01:46:39,241
Oh yes, I do.

1948
01:46:39,242 --> 01:46:42,244
<i>Don't let anyone
try to follow me!</i>

1949
01:46:42,245 --> 01:46:43,245
<i>I want to go on the swing.</i>

1950
01:46:43,246 --> 01:46:46,248
Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I didn't
realize this was on here.

1951
01:46:46,249 --> 01:46:47,249
No, no, no...

1952
01:46:47,250 --> 01:46:49,752
<i>Okay, honey. Here we go.</i>

1953
01:46:49,753 --> 01:46:50,753
<i>Got you! Ha, ha, ha!</i>

1954
01:46:50,754 --> 01:46:52,254
<i>Give me my hat back!</i>

1955
01:46:52,255 --> 01:46:53,756
Excuse me.

1956
01:46:53,757 --> 01:46:55,758
Sandy...

1957
01:46:55,759 --> 01:46:57,259
It's okay.

1958
01:46:57,260 --> 01:46:59,261
<i>Is that the best you can do?</i>

1959
01:46:59,262 --> 01:47:00,763
<i>What's wrong with that?</i>

1960
01:47:00,764 --> 01:47:03,265
<i>How is that for something?
Push me, quick.</i>

1961
01:47:03,266 --> 01:47:04,767
<i>Dumb.</i>

1962
01:47:06,770 --> 01:47:10,273
<i>Tell me, who's ever going to
watch this, anyway? Huh?</i>

1963
01:47:19,783 --> 01:47:22,284
It's going to be fine.

1964
01:47:22,285 --> 01:47:23,786
Yeah.

1965
01:47:25,288 --> 01:47:27,289
So, how is the business?

1966
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:29,291
Good, good.

1967
01:47:29,292 --> 01:47:31,794
Almost too good.

1968
01:47:31,795 --> 01:47:33,796
What do you mean?

1969
01:47:33,797 --> 01:47:35,798
Well I just...
Yeah, I hardly have

1970
01:47:35,799 --> 01:47:36,799
any time for myself these days.

1971
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:39,803
Oh God! I know how you feel.

1972
01:47:41,805 --> 01:47:43,305
How about you? Are you
going back to work?

1973
01:47:43,306 --> 01:47:44,306
Ssh... Stevie.

1974
01:47:44,307 --> 01:47:46,809
Here. Can I?

1975
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:48,311
Be careful.

1976
01:47:52,315 --> 01:47:55,818
Ah, yeah... in a couple
of months, I think.

1977
01:47:55,819 --> 01:47:58,821
I do have this job offer.

1978
01:47:58,822 --> 01:48:00,823
Ah, that's great. That's good.

1979
01:48:00,824 --> 01:48:03,325
You shouldn't give it up.
You are so good at what you do.

1980
01:48:03,326 --> 01:48:04,326
Well, thanks.

1981
01:48:04,327 --> 01:48:07,830
And you don't have to worry
about career versus child.

1982
01:48:07,831 --> 01:48:08,831
You can do it.

1983
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:10,332
Well, look what you did.

1984
01:48:10,333 --> 01:48:12,835
Yeah, well. In a way.

1985
01:48:14,337 --> 01:48:16,839
You're really
looking good, Hol.

1986
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:18,341
So are you.

1987
01:48:19,342 --> 01:48:23,846
I love those shoes.
Where did you get them?

1988
01:48:23,847 --> 01:48:24,847
You like those, huh?

1989
01:48:24,848 --> 01:48:26,849
Uh-huh.

1990
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:28,350
An old friend.

1991
01:48:28,351 --> 01:48:31,353
Well, she has terrific taste.

1992
01:48:31,354 --> 01:48:36,859
But... Who picked out
the rest of your outfit?
