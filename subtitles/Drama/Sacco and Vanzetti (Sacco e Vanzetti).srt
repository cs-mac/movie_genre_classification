1
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,600
Stop!

2
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,400
Here!

3
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,500
This is the boss. Let's go!

4
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,000
Shit! Let's get out of here.

5
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,100
Stop there.

6
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,700
There's no doubt. It was anarchists
who placed the bomb.

7
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,500
This is their "signature", gentlemen.

8
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,700
Minister, you must know that it's easier
to falsify a flyer than to place a bomb.

9
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,600
After all, you are still alive Mr. Palmer.

10
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,800
Sorry to disappoint you.

11
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,900
Are not all these deportations illegal?

12
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,600
25,000 already got deported...

13
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,100
Do you mean that the anarchist bombs

14
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,600
against Morgan, Rockefeller
and me are legal?

15
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,400
The objective of their attacks

16
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,300
is to terrify the unions,

17
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,600
the true enemies of capitalism.

18
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You are poisoned by the red propaganda.

19
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,700
Your department is accused
to infiltrate the unions.

20
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,500
Hundreds of spies and specialized provokers,

21
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,200
a full special espionage unit.

22
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,600
Also you are poisoned by the red propaganda!

23
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,800
The Bishop of New York says:

24
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,900
The country is imprisoned by
the panic and the hysteria.

25
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,400
Another infamous part of the
history of the United States.

26
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,700
Is the Catholic Church

27
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,800
also poisoned by the red propaganda?

28
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,200
The bishop take care of souls,

29
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
I take care of my country.

30
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,100
In Boston the Secretary of State declared:

31
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,500
"If we could...

32
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,600
we would deport them and shoot them."

33
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,000
- Do you agree?
- Well, I wouldn't shoot them.

34
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,400
Why don't you say anything
to us about Andrea Salcedo?

35
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,700
Like what?

36
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,800
How he mysteriously fell

37
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,700
from the 14th floor of the Police Department.

38
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,400
You are an anarchist!

39
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,400
The Minister of Labor is in
opposition to the deportations.

40
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,500
Is he perhaps also a red rebel?

41
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,700
Soon we will know who is

42
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,400
the leader of the reds in our country.

43
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,800
Are you accusing the Minister of Labor?

44
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,300
I am not accusing anyone.

45
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,400
A few good quotes for the special edition...

46
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,900
- Who is it?
- My name is Boda, Mrs. Johnson.

47
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,100
- I'm here to get my car.
- One moment.

48
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
What's up?

49
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,900
It's the Italian, Mr. Boda, he's not alone.

50
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,500
Call the police.

51
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Tell them that they are here.

52
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,200
I'll do that.

53
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,600
He's on the phone.

54
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,800
He's on the phone!

55
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,200
We shouldn't stay.

56
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,600
Sorry, we have to leave immediately.

57
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,300
No problem, I will help you tomorrow.

58
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,600
Stop it!

59
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,200
You're under arrest!

60
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,800
A Colt 32.
Found in the pocket of Nicola Sacco.

61
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,100
32 bullets of various brands.

62
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,500
One Harrington & Richardson, caliber 38,

63
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,000
fully loaded.

64
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,400
Found in the pockets of the
other fellow, Bartolomeo Vanzetti.

65
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,700
They deny illegal arms possession.

66
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
So what do you say?

67
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,500
Mr. Sacco, would you have
the kindness to respond?

68
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,500
- We don't have permission to carry arms.
- I don't know how to express myself.

69
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,500
Italians, right?

70
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,000
U.S. citizens?

71
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Anarchists.

72
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,200
You know, Mr. Sacco, you have nothing to fear.

73
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,900
- You understand me?
- More or less.

74
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,100
You said that you don't speak
our language too well,

75
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,500
but we will make everything to help you.

76
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,200
Do you understand me now?

77
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,700
Yes, everything.

78
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,800
Tell me, Mr. Sacco,
why do you walk around armed?

79
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,000
- And with all this ammunition?
- These are difficult times.

80
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,900
Doesn't it strike you, Mr. Sacco,
that in these difficult times

81
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,400
not even a night watchman
could go armed at night

82
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,600
without permission to carry arms?

83
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,500
- What did you do in Bridgewater?
- I accompanied Vanzetti.

84
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
- He went to look for a friend.
- What friend?

85
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,800
- Poppy.
- Poppy?

86
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Poppy, I know him only by that name.

87
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,000
An where did you meet this Poppy?

88
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,800
In the drugstore, like always.

89
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,900
And when meeting this Poppy
at the drugstore,

90
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,600
why did you come armed?

91
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Well, I wanted to see Poppy to
request him to help a friend.

92
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,700
I believe he wanted to sell him fish.

93
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
That was a good one, Mr. Sacco.

94
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,500
"I believe he wanted to sell him fish."

95
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,000
And what type of fish?

96
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,400
Hammerfish? Swordfish? Or flatfish?

97
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,200
Bartolomeo sells fish.

98
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,300
And what do you sell, Mr. Sacco?

99
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,400
Lies?

100
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,300
I'm a shoe factory worker.

101
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,400
Who were the other three on the tram?

102
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
I don't know them.

103
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,200
They were friends of Vanzetti,
I don't know them.

104
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,400
One of them is called Mike Boda.

105
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,800
Does that name mean anything to you?

106
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,700
No.

107
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,700
So you go out armed at night,
looking for Poppy,

108
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,100
and end up at the house of Simon Johnson...

109
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,700
...and then with three guys on a tram.

110
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,600
Three guys who you say you don't know.

111
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,400
I don't understand politics.

112
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
- Union man?
- No.

113
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,300
Then you are an anarchist.

114
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,600
No.

115
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,500
Do you by any chance know... Andrea Salcedo?

116
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,100
No.

117
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,900
Today, Wednesday the 5th of May, 1920,

118
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,800
we have interrogated two suspects...

119
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
...many contradictions...

120
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,900
Nicola Sacco, a shoe factory worker.

121
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,100
Wait.

122
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,700
The assault on the shoe factory
on South Braintree...

123
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,200
...wasn't there shots fired from a Colt 32?

124
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,400
Hello?

125
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,300
Nicola Sacco or Nick Sacco.

126
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,600
Nicola.

127
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,100
Quiet.

128
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,100
It's been confirmed. Sacco did not
attend his work on the 15 of April.

129
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
And the other case?

130
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,900
Nothing. No proof that the anarchist movement

131
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,500
have received any larger sums of money
until now.

132
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,800
The hats.

133
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,000
Put the hats on.

134
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,100
Hats off.

135
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,200
Very well.

136
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,100
Now pretend you're holding a gun.

137
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,900
The right arm!

138
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,300
More lifelike, please.

139
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,700
Come on!

140
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,900
They aimed upwards!

141
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,100
- What...?
- Quiet.

142
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,400
Don't move!

143
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,200
Turn against the wall.

144
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,700
They want to scare to us.

145
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,600
Now turn to the right.

146
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,000
You are lying, systematically.

147
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,100
Are you always lying?

148
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,600
I'm not lying.

149
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,100
You were armed, right, Mr. Vanzetti?

150
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,800
You're an idiot and a liar.

151
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,800
- Always lying.
- I'm not lying, I insist.

152
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,500
Are you an anarchist?

153
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,300
You understand me?

154
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,900
- Are you an anarchist?
- No!

155
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,800
A communist?

156
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,000
Mr. Vanzetti, don't make have
to repeat all my questions. - No.

157
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,300
- A socialist?
- No.

158
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,700
Answer with "No, sir".

159
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
No, sir.

160
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,000
- Union man?
- No, sir.

161
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,100
Member of the mafia?

162
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,800
No, sir.

163
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,300
Where were you on the night
of the 2nd of January?

164
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,300
Don't remember?

165
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,000
You're a liar, Mr. Vanzetti,
a charming liar.

166
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,400
Do you recognize him?

167
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,600
Do you remember that day?

168
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,800
- Which day was it?
- The 2nd of January.

169
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,600
This year?

170
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,100
This year?

171
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,700
This year.

172
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,600
And the 15th of April this year,
where were you at 3 pm?

173
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,100
You want this question also repeated to you?

174
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm trying to help you.

175
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600
Today is Thursday 6th of May,

176
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,200
three weeks since the 15th of April.

177
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,400
Simple, right?

178
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,700
Where were you on

179
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,700
the 15th of April at 3 pm?

180
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,100
I was selling fish.

181
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,600
What's so funny about selling fish?

182
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,200
Where?

183
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,800
In Plymouth as usual.

184
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,900
You were not in Plymouth
the night of the 2nd of January,

185
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,500
nor any other night.

186
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,900
And if I showed you
another photo, Mr. Vanzetti,

187
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,800
a photo taken at 3 pm on the 15th of April,

188
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,600
this year, 1920,

189
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,600
showing you in South Braintree...

190
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,900
South Braintree?

191
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,100
As the District Attorney

192
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,500
for the cities of Norfolk and Plymouth...

193
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,500
I formally accuse Bartolomeo Vanzetti

194
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,300
for double homicide and robbery...

195
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,900
...together with Nicola Sacco

196
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,700
...and other unknown men.

197
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,300
These crimes were committed on
the 15th of April at 3 pm,

198
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,100
on Pearl Street, South Braintree,

199
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,300
in front of the Slater & Morris shoe factory

200
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,200
where a bloody assault occurred in which

201
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,700
Frederick Parmenter, the company's cashier,

202
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,600
and a guard, Alessandro Berardelli,
were shot dead.

203
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,900
I don't believe you mean this seriously.

204
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,500
Take him away.

205
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,800
What are you doing?

206
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,700
- Take him away.
- What are you doing?

207
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,000
How can you?

208
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,600
Damn you!

209
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Bastard! Damn you!

210
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,900
Let go of me!

211
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,100
- Bartolomeo!
- Nicola, Nicola!

212
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,300
Homicide!

213
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,000
Homicide, Nicola!

214
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,000
Homicide, Nicola!

215
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,600
- Bartolomeo! Bartolomeo!
- Homicide, Nicola!

216
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,200
Let me out of here!

217
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,600
Remember your promise,
don't make this political.

218
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,900
Have faith in us, madam.

219
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,100
Moore have defended many striking workers.

220
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,200
He is the lawyer all unions have trust in.

221
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,000
He knows what to do.

222
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,700
Just stay calm, Mrs. Sacco.

223
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,700
The District Attorney agrees to

224
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,700
not make this a political trial.

225
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,800
But outside...

226
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Court in session!

227
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,800
Attention.

228
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,500
The state and commonwealth

229
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,200
of Massachusetts.

230
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,200
versus Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti,
both present,

231
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,000
arrested in the afternoon on the
5th of April, 1920, in Brockton,

232
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,800
formally charged for double
homicide and robbery.

233
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,800
on Pearl Street, South Braintree

234
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,400
The shooting started here.

235
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,300
Mr. Bostock...

236
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,100
You were closest to the scene.

237
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,000
At what distance...

238
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,300
...were you when Parmenter
and Berardelli went down?

239
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,600
I would say about five or six yards.

240
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,800
So you saw both bandits when they shot?

241
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Yes.

242
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,700
Would you recognize both the accused

243
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,800
or at least one of them?

244
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,600
One of the bandits who was
shooting in South Braintree?

245
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,100
I'm not sure.

246
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,500
When the shooting started, Mr. Spencer,
you were the first on the scene.

247
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,800
What did you see?

248
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
I saw the guard Berardelli
lying on the ground...

249
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,600
A man was shooting at him.

250
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,100
- This man, what did he look like?
- He had dark,

251
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
wavy hair, cut short in the back.

252
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,400
What was your distance to that man?

253
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,700
About 4 or 5 yards.

254
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
- Is that man in this room?
- Yes.

255
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,700
Can you point him out?

256
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,300
It's him!

257
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,300
Do you know his name?

258
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,700
The one without moustache.

259
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,200
Say his name.

260
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,700
- Nicola Sacco.
- Who? Me?

261
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,500
What are you saying!?

262
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,200
Nothing has changed, stay calm.

263
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
- The man driving the car?
- Blonde, pale.

264
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,100
Thin, blonde, pale, weak.

265
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,900
Dark skin, black moustache.

266
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
I'm not in any doubt,

267
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,700
it was that man, Bartolomeo Vanzetti.

268
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,000
The train was coming.

269
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,200
The crossing barriers were down.

270
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,100
The car came towards me.

271
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,800
He aimed at me and said:
Put up the barriers!

272
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,300
- And another thing...
- Yes, what?

273
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,100
He called me a son of a bitch.

274
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,400
Only one small circumstance.

275
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,800
Vanzetti doesn't know how to drive.

276
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,600
Perhaps the man with the moustache...

277
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,100
...sat down in the car later...

278
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,500
And when you were confronted with a gun...

279
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,500
you became confused...
- Objection.

280
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,900
Objection sustained.

281
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,400
I will reformulate the question.

282
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,700
Are you sure that the man with a moustache,

283
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,300
identified as Vanzetti, was the driver?

284
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,200
- Well, not absolutely, but...
- But you are sure that...

285
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,300
the face you remember is the face
of the defendant?

286
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,500
Yes, sir.

287
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,300
In conclusion, Mr. Goodridge...

288
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,600
You heard the first shots
when you were playing billiards.

289
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,900
First you went to the window
but didn't see anything,

290
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,300
then you heard more shooting and went outside.

291
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,200
At what did distance did you see the dark car?

292
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,800
More or less 6 yards.

293
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
And what more did you see?

294
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,700
I saw a dark-haired man

295
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,500
who aimed at me with a pistol.

296
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,300
- Would you recognize him?
- Yes.

297
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It's him, the man to the left.

298
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,300
- Are you sure?
- Completely.

299
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,700
Isn't there a pending trial in
this court against the witness?

300
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,700
Then his testimony has no validity.

301
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,500
Dr. Moore!

302
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,900
When addressing a judge, please rise!

303
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,900
Understood, Dr. Moore?

304
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,200
You know or should know

305
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,400
that the criminal records only mean something

306
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,100
after pronouncing the sentence.
Cancel the question about the car.

307
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,500
I ran towards the window,

308
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,700
the one facing Pearl Street.

309
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,700
I saw a dark car on the street,

310
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,800
driving very fast.

311
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,800
I want to ask what distance it was.

312
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,100
Go on.

313
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,000
- You understand the question?
- Yes, sir.

314
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,100
Let's say... around 20 yards,
and it can be verified.

315
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,200
Please continue.

316
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,000
I saw a bandit, the man over there...

317
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,000
Objection.

318
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,700
Very well, objection sustained.

319
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,100
The witness should only rely on facts.

320
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,800
- May I speak?
- Sure.

321
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:21,400
Well, I would say his face had
some noticeable characteristics.

322
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,300
Fine features, high forehead, no beard.

323
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,300
Swept back hair style...

324
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,300
his hair about 2 inches in length.

325
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,800
I noticed that his left hand...

326
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,200
he held the gun in his right hand, of course,

327
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,200
but the left hand was holding
the arm support of the front seat.

328
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,200
I remember it well,
it was a firm hand

329
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,400
which gave an impression of strength...
- Do you also recall the dimple on his chin?

330
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,100
Mr. Moore!

331
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,500
How long did this extraordinary vision go on?

332
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,400
Objection. The defense asks the witness
to guess, not to rely on facts.

333
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,500
Objection sustained.

334
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,700
However, the prosecution should
ask the witness this question.

335
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,700
Answer the question.

336
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,800
I don't know exactly...

337
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,500
...perhaps one second.

338
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
And tell us, Miss Splaine,

339
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,300
who is this bandit that you
have described in such detail?

340
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,800
I already told you.

341
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,800
Nicola Sacco, without a doubt.

342
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,000
One moment, sir.

343
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,200
Thanks.

344
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
The car was found in the woods,

345
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,800
not far away from here.

346
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,900
Marie Splaine stood in the window
on the second floor.

347
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
There, Goodridge.

348
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,900
Spencer and other witnesses in those windows.

349
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,600
Levangie at the railroad crossing.

350
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,500
Those bullets were shot at Bostock.

351
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Who tried to help the cashier.

352
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,900
That's all, gentlemen.

353
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,300
Miss Splaine, do you know that this case

354
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,600
is resting on your testimony?

355
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,400
- Objection!
- Objection sustained.

356
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,800
You said you were about 20 yards from the car?

357
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,500
Yes.

358
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,900
In your opinion,
what was the speed of the car?

359
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,200
- Objection!
- Objection sustained.

360
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,800
Miss Splaine...

361
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Take a look at that man,

362
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,500
the first on the second row to the right...

363
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,700
Can you tell me the color of his tie?

364
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,300
No, sir.

365
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,500
- I do not see well at that distance.
- How far would you say it is?

366
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,100
- Objection!
- I'd say it's less than 15 meters!

367
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,400
Do you want us to believe...

368
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,200
Young lady, tell us the truth...

369
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,300
there's no shame in using eyeglasses.

370
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,800
It's true that when I'm at work...

371
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,900
I use eyeglasses all the time.

372
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,100
I forgot to say that, how stupid of me.

373
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,600
So you're saying there is no doubt that
the man who was shooting was Sacco?

374
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,200
I have no doubts, no.

375
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,200
- No doubts?
- No, I already said that.

376
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,300
No?

377
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,900
Nevertheless, at the police station...

378
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,600
you identified another man on a photo,
and you said:

379
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,300
"This is the first one that I recognize."

380
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,300
Why have you changed your mind?

381
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,800
Answer the question.

382
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,700
I was confused.

383
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,800
When indicating the photo,
or when indicating Nicola Sacco?

384
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,700
I didn't say it was him...

385
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,800
I just said that Mr. Sacco looks like the
man that I saw in front of the factory.

386
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,400
But what did you really see?

387
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,700
Objection.

388
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,700
The defense is frightening the witness.

389
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,500
Objection sustained.

390
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,100
Very well, you may leave the stand,
but not the court,

391
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,800
I'm not done with you.

392
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,300
- You were at the scene, together
with Mr. Pelser? - Yes, sir.

393
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,400
Please tell us what you saw.

394
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,000
The shooting started...

395
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,400
Pelser threw himself to the floor, so did I.

396
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,700
We were lying next to each other

397
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,900
Only later did I get to the window.

398
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,900
I did in fact not see the men...

399
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,600
I only saw the number on the license plate.

400
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,500
Thank you, Mr. McCallum.

401
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,100
Mr. Wade works at the gas station.

402
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,000
That's here.

403
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,000
On his way home

404
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,500
he passed, less than eight yards away,

405
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,300
the car of the attackers... exactly here.

406
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,500
This is very serious...

407
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,100
You said before the man looked like Sacco...

408
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,400
Can you confirm that under oath?

409
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
I...

410
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,500
I'm not sure...

411
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,600
Finally an honest man.

412
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,100
And why are you not sure?

413
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,100
The truth is, that some time afterwards...

414
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,000
I saw another man at a barber-shop

415
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,300
who also looked like the
man who killed Berardelli.

416
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,600
Thank you, Mr. Wade.

417
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,600
As you all know.

418
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,000
The gentleman here is the only person

419
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,900
who've said that the man who was
driving the car had black moustaches,

420
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,100
and that this man is Bartolomeo Vanzetti.

421
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,800
All the others say that the driver

422
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,600
was blond or thin.

423
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,300
Then...

424
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,500
the prosecution suggests you're saying

425
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,400
that Vanzetti could have been the man
that was seated behind the driver.

426
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,400
You saw a man leaning out of the car,
but you didn't recognize him, right?

427
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,500
That's right, sir.

428
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,200
- You were here, right?
- Yes, sir.

429
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,900
That is wrong, totally wrong!

430
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,500
You said that you lowered the barriers,

431
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,000
which means you were here, to the
right, and not next to the driver.

432
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,400
After lowering the barriers,

433
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,200
he could have crossed the street.
- Thank you, Mr. Katzman...

434
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,700
We still need to hear it from the witness.

435
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,600
- Yes, like that.
- Like what?

436
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,900
Like Mr. Katzmann said.

437
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,400
So you lowered the barriers
and crossed the street

438
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
and when the car came,

439
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,800
you were there?

440
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
- Yes.
- Yes?

441
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,200
Too bad for Mr. Levangie,
and the prosecution,

442
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,300
that there are many witnesses,

443
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,000
workers and neighbors,

444
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,800
who give contradictory testimonies.

445
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,900
- Did Mr. Levangie stand near the sentry box?
- Yes.

446
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,300
On the left hand side?

447
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,000
Yes, sir.

448
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,800
I accuse Mr. Michael Levangie

449
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,000
of giving false testimony.
- Silence.

450
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,200
Session suspended.

451
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,400
Seems like all is going well.

452
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,300
If we were just thieves it could go well.

453
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,200
But we are anarchists, that's not allowed.

454
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,600
Just watch them.

455
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,700
This trial may go wrong.

456
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,400
But who are you?

457
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,500
We worked for the committee,
but without means.

458
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:43,200
The defense is our hope. - Who, Moore?

459
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,200
The comrade Moore?

460
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,700
He just looks for another legal victory.

461
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,000
I don't trust him.

462
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,100
Levangie has completely turned the trial.

463
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,600
The jury will have to listen to Bostock

464
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,700
and the other witnesses again...

465
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,800
- Enrico, all well?
- Good work, Mr. Moore.

466
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,900
It's necessary to give him a lesson.

467
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,900
Let's enter.

468
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,700
This court...

469
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,900
in rejecting the incrimination
of Mr. Michael Levangie...

470
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,700
it condemns

471
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,200
the terrorist methods used by the defense

472
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,800
when interrogating the witnesses.

473
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,500
They are making it a political process.

474
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,300
We have responsibilities

475
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,200
that we should comply to.

476
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,500
We can't keep up with all witnesses

477
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,400
changing their minds.

478
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,200
Attention, people waiting.

479
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,800
Please make room.

480
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,900
Don't worry, Nicola,
everything will be fine.

481
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,500
I have much faith.

482
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,100
Step back!

483
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,600
We need to pass!

484
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,200
Dante!

485
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,000
Dante!

486
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,000
Dante!

487
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,000
Dante answer me!
Where are you?

488
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,400
Dante!

489
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,900
Dante.

490
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,400
What are you doing? What do you want?

491
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,900
Come with us.

492
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,300
Coward.

493
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,500
This will learn to change your testimony.

494
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,500
If they prohibit alcohol...

495
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,700
they would also have to prohibit

496
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,600
French people...

497
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,000
The Irish...

498
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,800
English...

499
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,600
Quite many Italians. The Greek and Polish too.

500
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,700
- That's Boston.
- You forgot the Germans.

501
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,100
Do you mean D.A. Katzman, Mrs. Evans?

502
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,200
Here are your Germans, madam.

503
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,200
And Judge Thayer!

504
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,100
And finally, a few drops of Angostura.

505
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,600
The majesty of justice...

506
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,400
The concept of justice is rather bitter.

507
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,100
You don't believe in the innocence
of those two, do you?

508
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,500
I don't know. All I know is that
this is an ordinary trial.

509
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,100
Until recently, two anarchists like Sacco
and Vanzetti, would have been deported.

510
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,700
But now they might end up
in the electric chair.

511
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,500
It's an ordinary trial.

512
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,700
And after the attacks of Mr. Palmer,

513
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,200
the American democracy will be pleased.

514
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,200
Mr. Thompson,

515
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,700
the most famous lawyer in Boston,

516
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,900
saying this is an ordinary trial?

517
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,700
A new cocktail?

518
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,300
Perfectly "Legal", Mr. Katzman,

519
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,300
without one drop of alcohol.

520
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,600
I call it "Sidecar".

521
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,300
Why?

522
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,800
Perhaps everything started
with a motorbike? A Sidecar?

523
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,600
Are you speaking about the
trial against Sacco and Vanzetti?

524
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,500
Yes, a trial out of the ordinary.

525
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,700
It begins with a Sidecar and ends up

526
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,300
with witnesses being beaten up.

527
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,600
Do you remember the man who
worked in the gas station?

528
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,800
What are you insinuating, Mr. Rennie?

529
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,100
Excuse me.

530
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,700
The deportations were
criticized and unpopular.

531
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:37,300
- However, an ordinary trial...
- A trial against two anarchists, Mr. Rennie.

532
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,000
Is it a crime to be an anarchist?

533
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,300
- Anarchists and immigrants.
- This is a country of immigrants.

534
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,200
How long have you been
in America, Mr. Katzman?

535
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,900
I'm convinced that Sacco and Vanzetti
have robbed and assassinated,

536
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,000
and I will prove it.

537
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,900
The sentence will soon have
some political meaning.

538
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,100
Captain Proctor, could you
explain to us the results

539
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,400
of the ballistic investigations.

540
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,200
This is a Colt 32 that belongs to Mr. Sacco.

541
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:30,000
This is a Harrington & Richardson 38
that belongs to Mr. Vanzetti.

542
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,700
The bullets are recognized by the caliber

543
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,700
but also from when they were fired...

544
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,700
They rotate from left to right,

545
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,500
or from right to left,

546
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,400
leaving grooves in the bullet.

547
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,000
But the only type of American pistol

548
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,600
that rotates from the left

549
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,500
is a Colt 32.

550
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,700
Thank you, Captain, please be seated.

551
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,700
3 of the 4 bullets from
the body of Berardelli...

552
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,900
have right rotation.

553
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,400
The same for the two bullets taken
from the body of Parmenter.

554
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,800
But the fourth bullet,

555
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,100
the lethal bullet,

556
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,100
has left rotation.

557
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,000
It was fired by a Colt 32.

558
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,000
Captain, after the ballistic tests,
can you tell us

559
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,900
if this bullet was shot
by the Colt of Mr. Sacco?

560
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,200
In my opinion,

561
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,900
it was probably shot by that pistol.

562
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,800
Sacco was not in South Braintree that day!

563
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,100
He couldn't have been in South
Braintree on the 15 of April.

564
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,600
Because that day he had requested
a day off from the factory

565
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,800
for serious personal reasons.

566
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,800
Dear son...

567
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,700
I understand that the death of your
mother has caused you much sorrow.

568
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,900
She expressed how much she wanted
to see you again before dying.

569
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,800
Don't forget to meet up...

570
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,900
"You do not know what it means
to have a son live so far away,

571
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,100
and for so many years."

572
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,400
"I hope we meet again."

573
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,100
"Longing to hold you close."

574
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,700
Mr. Consul, one moment please.

575
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,900
- Do you have any other documents?
- This is all I have.

576
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,400
I've never before been presented
with any such photographs,

577
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,300
so big, I mean.

578
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,100
There were two of them, I think.

579
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,500
It was the day of the 15th of April.

580
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,600
I remember because I looked
at the wall calendar

581
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,900
hanging on the wall in the office.

582
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,700
Yes, it was at 2 pm or perhaps a little later.

583
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,500
I recall that day also because I closed

584
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,400
the consulate half an hour later.

585
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,000
With so many people visiting the consulate,

586
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:51,400
you said you're receiving between
150 and 200 visitors every day,

587
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,400
...that's correct, right?
- Uhu.

588
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,800
You must have an incredible memory...

589
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,300
That day, how was the defendant dressed?

590
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,600
I don't remember that,
only the peculiar photograph.

591
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,000
Let's talk about another peculiar date...

592
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,000
the 17, 19, 21 , 24 or 29th of April.

593
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
- Listen...
- Choose any date,

594
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,400
2nd of May, or the 3rd or 4th, or the 6th.

595
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,400
Yes, I remember another peculiar thing
that happened on the 1st of May...

596
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,500
but last year.

597
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,900
When the consulate was full of immigrants

598
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,300
that requested protection

599
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,000
from Attorney General Palmer.

600
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,000
Those are true facts!

601
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,400
Mr. Adrower, just answer the questions.

602
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,800
Mr. Palmer is the Attorney General
of the United States...

603
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,900
and you are the representative
of a foreign country.

604
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,300
You should pay respect to... and...

605
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,700
answer the questions.

606
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,000
So you don't remember any
other peculiar events

607
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,500
at the Italian consulate, except
the one involving Mr. Sacco?

608
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,200
Yes, sure, if you prefer
it that way, Mr. Katzman.

609
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,200
Mr. Kelly...

610
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,500
Have a good look at this cap,

611
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,600
including the inside.

612
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,800
Do you notice something?

613
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,000
Yes, the lining is broken.

614
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,800
Didn't you say that Sacco

615
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,100
used to hang his cap on a nail?

616
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,300
Yes, but not...

617
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,400
Is this the cap of Mr. Sacco?

618
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,800
- It seems too small.
- If it would be larger though,

619
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,100
it would be Mr. Sacco's, right?
- Objection!

620
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,500
Well, Mr. Sacco...

621
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,800
can you put it on?

622
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,300
No.

623
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,100
What do you mean? You must put it on.

624
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,800
I'm no clown.

625
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,600
Mr. Sacco, nobody disrespects you,
but you must put on the cap.

626
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,100
No, properly.

627
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,500
No, properly, I said.

628
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,900
Enough!

629
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,500
On the 15th of April,

630
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,500
I was in Plymouth,
like every morning.

631
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,100
Bart! You want a cup of coffee?

632
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,200
I already had one, thanks, actually two.

633
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,200
Fish!

634
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,500
Big, tasty and fresh!

635
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,600
Fish!

636
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,700
Looks good, seems fresh.

637
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,300
Smell.

638
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,000
- Would that be all?
- Yes.

639
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:28,300
How do you remember the time being 12.30?

640
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,900
I am a craftsman...

641
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,800
and I leave my workplace at 12.30,
at the sound of the siren.

642
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,300
And why do you remember
it was the 15th of April?

643
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,900
...and not the 13th, or 14th?

644
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,700
I don't remember it that way,

645
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,900
but because I buy fresh fish every Thursday.

646
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,900
It doesn't stay fresh more than a week.

647
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,300
Could it be another week,
the 8th or 22nd of April?

648
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,300
Listen...

649
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,700
Could it be another week,
the 8th or 22nd of April?

650
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,100
What are you saying?

651
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,500
On April 8 I was operated for
my appendix. Look here.

652
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:07,900
Thank you.

653
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,300
And I had only one.

654
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,700
I was operated for my appendix
on the following day, and...

655
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,500
- And what..?
- He says it was his only appendix.

656
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,100
Mrs. Brini, have you known
Mr. Vanzetti for a long time?

657
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,400
Ever since I arrived in
Plymouth four years ago.

658
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,800
- He lives in your house?
- Yes.

659
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,800
- Do you like lodging him?
- Yes.

660
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,600
Do your husband like it?

661
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,900
Objection!

662
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,800
With the permission of the defense...

663
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,600
In case of necessity...

664
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,800
would you make a sacrifice to save a friend?

665
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,500
Specially if he's Italian?

666
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,200
- Objection!
- What's wrong?

667
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,300
Mr. Katzmann, omit the last
part of the question.

668
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,200
Omit "Specially if he's Italian."

669
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,300
Would you do anything for a friend?

670
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,800
- Of course.
- Answer yes or no.

671
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,100
You remember where you
were on the 15th of April,

672
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,900
because you bought a dress...

673
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,600
...quite peculiar, no?

674
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,000
People like me do not buy dresses every day.

675
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,800
- We talked about it also.
- You talked about it?

676
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,700
- We reconstructed everything.
- Reconstructed? With whom?

677
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,200
With my husband and the neighbors.

678
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,800
Also with the man with appendicitis?

679
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,800
Of course.

680
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,400
Thank you, Mrs. Brini.

681
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,600
The ballistic tests established
that at least one bullet,

682
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,600
the one that killed Berardelli,

683
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,600
came from the pistol of Mr. Sacco.

684
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,200
With such evidence,

685
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,600
scientific and indisputable,

686
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,800
all arguments of the defendant collapse like

687
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,900
a house of cards.

688
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,000
Tens of witnesses have declared...

689
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,300
But what kind of witnesses?

690
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,100
A row of pitiful people...

691
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
from the underbelly of our society.

692
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,600
Ragged!

693
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,600
They hate us!

694
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,700
Silence!

695
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,500
The prosecution...

696
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,700
The prosecution has shown that
the defendants were present

697
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,500
at the violent robbery in South
Braintree on the 15th of April

698
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,300
I don't want to offend anyone,

699
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,700
but the Italian witnesses are not trustworthy.

700
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,400
Mr. Katzmann,

701
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,300
moderate your language.

702
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,400
Moderate? This is racism!
- Racism!

703
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,500
Do you want to end up on the
defendants' bench, Mr. Moore?

704
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,600
The defendants' bench is the most
untainted place in this room.

705
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,400
Mr. Moore!

706
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,700
We confront reality,

707
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,300
we examine it well...

708
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,000
We are uncivilized!

709
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,200
Italians, Greeks, Poles,
Puerto Ricans, Chileans.

710
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,800
It takes efforts and pain

711
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,700
trying to settle

712
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,200
in a superior society

713
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,800
trying to assimilate to our
way of life and thought.

714
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,000
This is racism!

715
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,700
Members of the jury...

716
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,900
The defense talks of racism,

717
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,700
it opposes testimonies from
honorable American citizens,

718
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,400
in favor of irresponsible
and scrupulous witnesses,

719
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,900
a bunch of poor immigrants,

720
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,600
people who do not know anything

721
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,000
about our national principles,

722
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,600
about the grand ideals of our democracy,

723
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,200
and the justice that reigns in our country.

724
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,200
People who don't speak our language.

725
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,400
Racism! Racism!

726
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,400
These are the same ideas of
the fanatics in the Ku Klux Klan.

727
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,700
They poison America. Ku Klux Klan!

728
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,100
One more word, Mr. Moore,

729
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,700
and I'll charge you for contempt in court.

730
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,100
Continue, Mr. Katzmann.

731
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,400
They represent the greatest danger

732
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,600
to our free institutions.

733
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,600
We must be perceptive, certainly,

734
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
but not until the point of...

735
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Racism! Racism! Ku Klux Klan!

736
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,400
The Californian lawyer,
the indescribable Mr. Moore,

737
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,500
mention the Ku Klux Klan.

738
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,900
Does he know that bonds also exist

739
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,900
between the immigrants?

740
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,300
That there are deviant blood
ceremonies among Italians,

741
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,200
where the blood of the teacher

742
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:19,500
is mixed with the blood of
the disciple... that's perverted!

743
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,900
Barbarians! Barbarians!

744
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,100
Thank you, Mr. Thompson,

745
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,800
for coming to the defense committee,

746
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,200
but I don't agree with you.

747
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,700
The objective of the court,

748
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,200
whatever the cost,

749
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,900
is to reach a just sentence.

750
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,100
I'm not so sure about that.

751
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,600
Whatever the cost, they want to reach

752
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,200
a political sentence.

753
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,400
That's the reason of the justice.

754
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,100
Such premise does not lead

755
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,600
to any acquittal.

756
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,100
Why do you think that they
would be acquitted?

757
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,700
I believe in justice.

758
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,200
But Mr. Thompson, everything is so obvious.

759
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,400
I asked myself the same as Mr. Moore...

760
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,100
Speak out, forget formalities.

761
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,500
We are all convinced

762
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,700
that Sacco and Vanzetti are innocent.

763
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,700
They are.

764
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,700
But then where are those truly guilty?

765
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,500
We will know in time!

766
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,700
I just wanted to say...

767
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,100
Have they done something to find them?

768
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,700
To find them?

769
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,400
Why not ask the police,
or Thayer, or Fuller!

770
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,300
This way you aren't of much help.

771
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,600
You don't seem to believe

772
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,500
that the police, the judge,
or the governor

773
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,700
are in agreement

774
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,900
of a sentence, to whatever the cost.

775
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,400
Do you mean you were convinced that

776
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,000
they don't wanted to mix
the trial with politics?

777
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,200
That is right.

778
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,400
I made that mistake.

779
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,200
I ask the court

780
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,700
to interrogate the defendant
Bartolomeo Vanzetti.

781
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,100
When did you arrive in the
United States, Mr. Vanzetti?

782
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,600
Thirteen years ago, in 1908.

783
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,000
Were you an anarchist already then?

784
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,200
- Not completely.
- Please explain.

785
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,600
When I saw how bad things
were in my country

786
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,300
I thought things here would be different.

787
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,200
Is that why you became an anarchist here?

788
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,300
Let's say that I finished
my radicalizing here,

789
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,200
as I began working in a factory,
13 years old,

790
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,000
to support myself.

791
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,600
And you ended up being an anarchist?

792
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,100
I am still an anarchist...

793
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,100
Everyone here is.

794
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,700
I don't understand the reason of this farce.

795
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,200
Mr. Vanzetti...

796
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Why did you lie to the
police officers in Brocton

797
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,700
the night you were arrested?

798
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,000
I was scared.

799
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,300
Scared of what?

800
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,400
Mr. Moore...

801
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,500
I'll tell you what I and
Nicola was doing that night.

802
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,700
We were returning propaganda material

803
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,400
to the houses of comrades,
in order to hide it.

804
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,700
For that reason we needed Boda's car.

805
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:20,900
We knew also... that another
one of those big "razzias"

806
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,600
against foreigners was being prepared.

807
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,400
And two days earlier...

808
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,600
the body of...

809
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,100
one of our comrades...

810
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,700
was found...

811
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,200
at dawn.

812
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,700
Mr. Vanzetti.

813
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,700
And I'm saying his name:

814
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,000
Andrea Salcedo!

815
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,800
Andrea Salcedo, our comrade!

816
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,800
He was found dead after
falling from the 14th floor

817
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,600
of the building of the
New York City Police Department!

818
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,200
Bravo, Vanzetti.

819
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,600
We were scared.

820
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,700
And that's why you were armed, I suppose.

821
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,700
Have you ever fired a gun, Mr. Vanzetti?

822
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:12,300
No, I've never fired a gun in my life.
I don't even know how to point a gun.

823
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,800
Or how to drive a car.

824
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,100
Please...

825
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:21,000
tell to the court why you were armed.

826
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,600
We had really thought of throwing them away.

827
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,600
We had brought all the bullets

828
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,000
that we had kept in our drawers.

829
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,600
Mr. Sacco, did you need
weapons that night

830
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,500
like one of those guards would do?

831
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,600
We did, but we wanted to throw them
anyway, it was too dangerous.

832
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,600
Why didn't you apply
for a firearms license?

833
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,100
It's not easy in this country

834
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,500
for an anarchist to get permission
to carry arms.

835
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,400
Like in any country, Mr. Sacco.

836
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,400
Yes.

837
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,300
In any country.

838
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,000
You don't love this country, do you?

839
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,800
Why do you say that?
I love this country.

840
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,000
Did you also love it in May of 1917?

841
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,400
That is not so easy to explain...

842
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,600
You didn't understand the question?
You need the interpreter?

843
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,800
No, it's not necessary, I understood.

844
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,200
Then answer with a yes, or a no.

845
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,800
Yes.

846
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,700
You say you loved this country...

847
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
but when you needed to serve it as a soldier

848
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,500
you ran away to Mexico?

849
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,600
- Let me explain...
- Answer yes or no.

850
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,600
Did you run away to Mexico to avoid serving

851
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:26,100
the country that you love?
- But I'm a worker.

852
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:29,600
Did you run away to Mexico in May, 1917?

853
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Yes, I did.

854
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:34,900
Finally!

855
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,300
It's difficult to get an answer
from this gentleman.

856
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:41,900
- Why did you run away?
- Because I'm an anarchist worker!

857
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,300
Which means..?

858
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,500
It means that the anarchists

859
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,300
believe in a world without borders.

860
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,800
I understand.

861
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,400
We are objectors of conscience.

862
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,300
Do you love the government
of the United States?

863
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,200
I do not love the government
of the United States.

864
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,200
Is that why we see bombs against ministers

865
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,300
and bankers of the state?

866
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:06,800
I've never put any bombs,
or shot any shots.

867
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,300
You never put any bombs.
You don't believe in bombs then?

868
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,300
I believe in anarchism.

869
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,000
But what type of anarchism is it
that you want to create?

870
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:22,300
- Could you explain that to the court?
- Anarchism means freedom.

871
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,300
The abolition of societies
divided by classes.

872
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,400
Respect for the other.

873
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,500
- Enough!
- To me, these are the things

874
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,900
that matter in life.

875
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:33,500
I try to live my life following these ideals.

876
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,900
Here are the arguments of the prosecution!

877
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,500
Workers who fight against their bosses.

878
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,300
Only to shorten unacceptable work hours,

879
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:47,500
of 16, 17, 18 hours per day,
and to ask for better wages.

880
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,900
This is the true meaning of this trial.

881
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,000
To cause harm to workers and to the unions,

882
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,600
through an infamous campaign

883
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,500
against foreigners.

884
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,900
Counselor, I demand silence!

885
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,100
It wouldn't have been allowed for a defendant

886
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,100
to distribute documents to the jury.

887
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,400
I give you a serious reprimand.

888
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,400
Take those photographs back.

889
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,500
Very good!

890
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,300
Bravo!

891
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,400
Silence!

892
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,300
Otherwise I will expel you.

893
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,300
So you hand out anarchist leaflets,

894
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,700
but know nothing about bombs.

895
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,200
And speak of love for your neighbor,
but walks around armed.

896
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,900
You love this country but when you are
asked to serve it you run away to Mexico.

897
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,200
Why didn't you stay in Mexico?
It's a free country.

898
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:45,700
I didn't do well there, I couldn't
find work in my trade.

899
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,800
After all sacrifices I made to learn my trade,

900
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,000
I wouldn't go to Mexico
to work with anything.

901
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,800
So your relation with the United
States is just a work relation,

902
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,400
measured by how much money you get.

903
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,800
Mr. Sacco, this is the love you have
for our country, isn't it?

904
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,500
Measured in dollars and cents.

905
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,700
- Objection!
- Objection overruled.

906
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,700
The defense have introduced these
kind of arguments. Please continue.

907
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,100
-  May I speak?
- Request granted.

908
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,600
You speak of dollars and cents, sir.

909
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,800
Lets speak about millions of dollars.

910
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,700
If you speak of an industry manager
or the head of a bank

911
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,600
who donates money to a university
everybody says:

912
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,400
What a great man he is!

913
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,200
But I have worked 13 years
in this free country,

914
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,100
doing what I've been told to.

915
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,000
I have worked like a slave

916
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,800
and still I don't own anything,

917
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,200
not a single dollar.

918
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,700
In here, all you here is:
"Passport, passport!"

919
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,900
But when I went to the consulate
to organize my journey back,

920
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,300
to be repatriated...

921
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,900
I didn't even have money to pay for the trip!

922
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:49,300
After thirteen years I would return
to my homeland with nothing.

923
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,000
Like when I started.

924
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,000
Sit down.

925
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,500
This is why I became an anarchist,

926
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,600
I just wanted to live a decent life...

927
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,200
that our children would get education,

928
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,200
a good start.

929
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,600
White, blacks that's not important.

930
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,700
However, the capitalist class

931
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,600
who just accumulate money in the banks

932
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,800
and command young people
to go to war, to death...

933
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,200
We don't want that.
We don't accept it.

934
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,500
We don't accept the war.

935
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,600
What right does a man have
to kill another man?

936
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,300
I work with German friends

937
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,800
who treat me like a brother.
Why should I kill them?

938
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,400
Morgan and Rockefeller are not the
great men of this country, sir.

939
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,900
I have seen better people than them.

940
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,600
Some are in the jail,

941
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,000
like Eugenio Debs,

942
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,200
a great man of this country.

943
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,100
He is also imprisoned

944
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,000
because he is socialist.

945
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:58,500
They are great people who
make this country progress.

946
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,500
I love this country because of them.

947
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,800
I don't have more to say.

948
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,500
Thanks to the court for its kind tolerance,

949
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:15,100
and for listening to what
one of the defendants

950
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,800
have to say about our institutions.

951
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,900
Remember what you have heard

952
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,700
and what has been documented.

953
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,500
This is just a small part of the red and
anarchist activity against our country.

954
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:32,800
At this point I want to ask you to
remember and reenact,

955
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:35,400
in all its aspects,

956
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,100
the purpose of the assault
in South Braintree.

957
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,900
The verdict can be only one.

958
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:47,100
I have nothing more to say.
Thank you.

959
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:09,200
For you it's more or less
the same, isn't it?

960
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,900
Sure, my wife has been feeling lonely

961
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,200
all the time I have been here.

962
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,700
- Sheriff, we are finished.
- Already?

963
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,100
That was fast, it's just five o'clock.

964
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:24,000
You have only used less than two hours.
A bit hasty perhaps. - Hasty?

965
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,400
Yes, perhaps you're right.

966
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,100
Did you say five o'clock?

967
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,900
Then we can have another meal,
courtesy of the state.

968
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:36,800
Come!

969
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,300
Come, they are here!

970
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,000
Attention.

971
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:57,500
It looks like armed Italians have
come from New York

972
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,200
to liberate the convicts.

973
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,200
Keep your eyes open.

974
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:01,700
Press.

975
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,000
Today they check everyone.
They suspect something.

976
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,600
- Do you know why?
- They must be scared.

977
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,700
The time has come.
Don't worry.

978
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:23,300
They are 5 hours delayed,
that is a good signal.

979
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,100
Court in session!

980
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,200
Mr. Chairman.

981
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,900
- Have you reached a verdict?
- Yes.

982
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,400
Nicola Sacco!

983
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,200
Bartolomeo Vanzetti!

984
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,000
Mr. Chairman,

985
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,900
raise your right hand and
turn to the defendants.

986
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,800
Defendants, listen to the
chairman of the jury.

987
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,400
Mr. Chairman,

988
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:23,300
Do you declare the defendants
guilty or not guilty?

989
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,000
Guilty.

990
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,100
- Guilty of murder?
- Murder.

991
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,300
- In the first degree?
- In the first degree.

992
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,200
Do the jury declare under oath

993
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,200
that the defendants, Nicola Sacco
and Bartolomeo Vanzetti,

994
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:38,500
are guilty of murder in first degree?

995
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:39,700
Yes.

996
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,700
- Is that your verdict?
- That's our verdict.

997
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,300
Is that the verdict of all members?

998
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,100
Yes.

999
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,700
Yes.

1000
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,200
Yes.

1001
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Yes.

1002
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,800
That's our verdict.

1003
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:00,300
Nico! They want to kill you!

1004
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,800
I don't understand this
sentence. It's absurd.

1005
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:06,200
It is an absurd sentence.

1006
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,700
Vanzetti, this is a conspiracy.

1007
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,300
Sacco, it's clearly a conspiracy.

1008
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,800
We will appeal.

1009
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:15,700
Shut up!

1010
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,200
We must. It's a conspiracy.

1011
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,000
You and your politics.

1012
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,300
We wont go to the electric chair.

1013
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:25,300
Enough committees. I don't want
to be a political martyr. I want to live.

1014
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,200
To live!

1015
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,100
I also want to live,
but in another world.

1016
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,900
Freedom for Nick and Bart.

1017
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,300
Freedom for Nick and Bart.

1018
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,400
No!

1019
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,700
Freedom for Nick and Bart.

1020
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,500
Nick and Bart, talk to us.

1021
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,600
Nick and Bart, talk to us.

1022
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,000
We are two unfortunates.

1023
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,200
We have been deceived.

1024
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,700
Freedom for Nick and Bart.

1025
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,600
Freedom for Nick and Bart.

1026
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:44,300
Look at this.

1027
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,000
We will insist that the
verdict is discharged,

1028
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,400
a very important filing.
- Perfect, make a copy of this.

1029
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,400
First of all we must locate

1030
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,300
Mary Splaine, Goodridge and Pelser,
the key witnesses of the prosecution.

1031
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:02,300
The police is attacking the protesters.
Everybody, come!

1032
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:21,300
Freedom for Nick and Bart.

1033
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,200
Clear! Clear!

1034
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,700
Sergeant, this is abuse!

1035
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:50,700
Are you wounded?

1036
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,900
The strong arm of the law.

1037
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,600
Where do you want to go?

1038
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,800
To the Defense Committee?

1039
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:08,700
Rennie, I don't want to see my
name in the newspapers.

1040
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,100
When it comes me, you can be calm.

1041
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:13,900
Which means?

1042
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:17,700
Somebody doesn't like what I write.

1043
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,200
- They refused it?
- Uhu.

1044
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:32,300
From now, Moore will be aided by Thompson,

1045
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:33,800
he is a great lawyer.

1046
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,200
They are preparing an appeal.

1047
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,500
I'm sure you will soon be released.

1048
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:42,100
You are too far away, Rosa,
I want you near me.

1049
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,800
Come closer.

1050
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:53,500
I could not live without you.
I'm not able.

1051
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:57,700
- Do you remember the night when...
- Nicola, you will soon be released.

1052
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,700
I'm thinking of you all the time.

1053
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:02,200
Most Americans are taking our side.

1054
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,200
Your speech really impressed everyone.

1055
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,300
They speak about you on the radio,
in the newspapers too.

1056
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,900
People are working...
printing flyers with your picture.

1057
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,400
- There are manifestations...
- No!

1058
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,500
What's wrong, Nicola?

1059
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,700
It's Moore who's asked you to
say that, isn't it?

1060
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,100
What are you saying?

1061
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,600
Rosa...

1062
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:28,300
We were going to return to Italy...

1063
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,800
And now this...

1064
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,600
Why?

1065
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,300
- Can you tell me why?
- No, Nicola, nobody can.

1066
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:44,300
Dante...

1067
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:48,400
Come here. Come to your father.

1068
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,000
What's wrong? Are you ashamed of me?

1069
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,500
Are you ashamed of your father?

1070
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,500
Because they say that
I'm a thief and a killer?

1071
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:01,300
Get out of here.
Go now! Now!

1072
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,600
Get out. They should all die.

1073
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:11,500
Freedom for Nick and Bart.

1074
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:04,300
No! They call me an assassin and a thief!

1075
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,000
They say that I'm an assassin.

1076
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,900
An assassin and a thief!

1077
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,700
They say that I'm an assassin and a thief!

1078
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:18,500
Thief, thief, thief...

1079
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,400
Assassin and thief.

1080
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,000
I know that your name
isn't Goodridge at all...

1081
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,500
you're also a bigamist...

1082
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,400
and has been accused of swindle.

1083
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,600
Or am I wrong?

1084
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,500
Forgot everything during the
interrogation, that's for sure!

1085
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,200
And now, what happens?

1086
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:44,600
What do you get in return
for your false testimony?

1087
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,000
You've been promised impunity, isn't that so?

1088
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:54,100
I... can't stand this anymore.

1089
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:04,400
You live in hiding, Pelser,
like an animal.

1090
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,500
No friends around, only policemen.

1091
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,500
Why is that?

1092
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,700
Are they forcing you?

1093
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:18,600
Yes.

1094
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,200
We have read the withdrawal statements,
obtained by Mr. Moore...

1095
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:25,900
of the prosecution's witnesses

1096
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:28,100
Mr. Pelser and Mr. Goodridge.

1097
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,800
Pity that the Mr. Pelser and Mr. Goodridge

1098
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,400
also sent these declarations to the court,

1099
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:40,000
where they blame Mr. Moore for

1100
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,100
putting strong pressure on them.

1101
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:46,700
Mr. Moore, your conduct is unprofessional.

1102
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:50,500
The withdrawals are the
results of intimidation.

1103
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,400
Therefore your appeal, as presented here,

1104
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,100
is rejected.

1105
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:56,400
You cannot speak of my
professional conduct, sir,

1106
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,400
because during all this trial
the court has used every occasion...

1107
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:03,600
to show its preconceived ideas...

1108
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,800
and its racist hatred of the defendants.

1109
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,500
And to you, Mr. Katzmann,

1110
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,900
who uses scum like Pelser and Goodridge...

1111
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,600
Be careful of what you say, Mr. Moore.

1112
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:17,300
Only courtesy for this court
prevents me from indicting you.

1113
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,800
The court is suspended.

1114
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,800
Mr. Feliciani said you will withdraw.

1115
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,100
I'm thankful to you.

1116
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,600
There were difficult moments and
we didn't always understand.

1117
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,900
But you are a good and honest man...

1118
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:47,600
and I'm very thankful to you.

1119
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:53,200
Thompson will do better than I have.
He is more capable.

1120
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,000
If I'd continue...

1121
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:59,400
it would all be the same.

1122
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,400
Are you leaving immediately?

1123
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:10,700
I have everything here.
This... and this.

1124
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
- Please send us your articles.
- Good bye, counselor.

1125
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:17,600
- I'm sorry.
- Good bye.

1126
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:20,200
Good bye.

1127
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:25,400
- Have a good trip, counselor.
- I'm very sorry.

1128
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:32,600
I know who attacked the shoe factory...
I was there...

1129
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,600
- What's your name?
- Celestino Madeiros.

1130
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:40,800
I'll be damned...

1131
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:45,600
We were five guys in the Buick
that committed the robbery.

1132
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:48,300
We changed car in a forest,

1133
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,900
and arrived in South Braintree around noon.

1134
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:57,800
- Then we began to drink.
- Where did you know each other from?

1135
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,100
I worked for some time with Barney

1136
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,100
at the Bluebird Inn.

1137
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,700
It's in Providence, five miles
across the Massachusetts border.

1138
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:10,900
A very comfortable place...

1139
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,500
to rest in between one work and another.

1140
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,900
- So you met the others there?
- Yes.

1141
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:18,100
Are they from Providence?

1142
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,100
What are their names?

1143
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,200
No, I wont say that. I'm not an informer.

1144
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,200
Tell us everything or tell us nothing.

1145
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:29,800
I'm not a snitch.

1146
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,800
So what makes you want to speak out now?

1147
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:36,300
I saw Sacco...
that was painful.

1148
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:38,300
You have been sentenced
to the electric chair...

1149
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,600
for robbery and homicide?
- Yes.

1150
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,900
And now you're hoping for a delay..?

1151
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:45,200
What's the benefit of that?

1152
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,600
There are witnesses,
maybe someone saw you shooting.

1153
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:53,500
I didn't shoot anything in South
Braintree, I was drunk.

1154
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:57,600
I was scared and stayed
in the back seat of the car...

1155
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,200
I didn't move a finger.

1156
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,000
They fooled me, okay?

1157
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,400
Back in the forest, when changing car,

1158
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:13,600
they fled with the loot
and I never saw them again.

1159
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,600
Where did you say you worked?

1160
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:42,200
- Excuse me, does Barney live here?
- May!

1161
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:46,900
- I'm looking for Barney.
- He's not here.

1162
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,200
Is this his house?

1163
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:53,300
It used to be.
Now it's a shanty.

1164
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:55,900
Do you know Celestino Madeiros?

1165
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:58,900
And who are you?

1166
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:00,900
I'm a lawyer.

1167
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,600
Well, you don't look like a police.

1168
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,900
Did Madeiros work here

1169
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:13,200
in April of 1920?

1170
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,600
I don't know, perhaps he was in Mexico.

1171
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:20,900
No wait, he went there later.
He gave me a present...

1172
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:24,000
on the 1st of May.
He was always broke,

1173
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:28,300
but I remember that day,
because he had 2800 dollars.

1174
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
He lied, they didn't fool him.

1175
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,900
After the robbery he had 2800 dollars...

1176
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,600
Exactly a fifth of the loot in South Braintree

1177
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:46,200
Here they are.

1178
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:50,500
- Go back to your country!
- Bastards!

1179
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,500
Yes, we had a gang here in Providence

1180
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:41,800
that used to rob cargo trains.

1181
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,800
They were Americans of Italian descent.

1182
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:49,500
Known as the Morell gang, or Morelli gang.

1183
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:54,500
Arrested on the 8 of October of 1919.

1184
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:59,200
Then they were in prison
on the 15th of April, right?

1185
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:00,800
I'll check that out.

1186
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:04,300
Joe, Fred

1187
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:07,400
Mancini, Pascuale Morelli.

1188
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,800
Trials in May, 1920.

1189
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,900
No, in April they were out on
the street, released waiting trial.

1190
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,700
- Thank you, inspector.
- You're welcome.

1191
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:23,900
Excuse me, inspector.

1192
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:27,600
Who was the lawyer defending
Morelli in May, 1920?

1193
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,800
Don't speak to me about professional ethics

1194
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:34,300
when defending the Morelli gang of robbers,

1195
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:38,900
and the boss of it all, Joe.
He was bad.

1196
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,300
But anyway...

1197
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:45,400
they had informants in the industrial areas.

1198
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,300
They made notes about transport trucks,

1199
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,200
what was being loaded,
for later use...

1200
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,800
Mr. Geary, which were those factories?

1201
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,300
There were many.

1202
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,900
Everything is in the files.

1203
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,500
"Rice & Hutchins", for example.

1204
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:04,900
- That's all I remember.
- I see.

1205
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,400
In South Braintree.

1206
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:10,300
Everything is in the archives of the court.

1207
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:31,500
Counselor!
The file of the trial isn't here.

1208
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,800
No indications, sir, no suspicious talking.

1209
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:38,900
Not even when he was delirious.

1210
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:42,700
Only two names, always Rosa and Dante.

1211
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,200
No messages from the outside either,

1212
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,800
except for letters controlled by you, sir.

1213
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:52,600
If you prefer, sir, if you
have other instructions...

1214
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,800
I don't have, thank you.

1215
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,600
I could write that your woman
needs you, and your son too,

1216
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:03,400
but I ask you to recover,
for the benefit of our comradeship.

1217
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:07,100
And when I say comradeship,
I'm speaking about our innocence.

1218
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,800
The truth, our ideas...

1219
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:13,100
I'm speaking about our freedom.

1220
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,700
Doctor...

1221
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,600
not today.

1222
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,500
Please, not today.

1223
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:26,500
- I want to improve without.
- If you want to improve...

1224
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,300
it means you are getting better, Nicola.

1225
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,500
I am piano salesman.

1226
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:38,600
What brand of pianos, Morelli?

1227
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,400
Listen, if you're here to cut my hair...

1228
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,400
Have you ever heard of South Braintree?

1229
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
do you know a Puerto Rican
called Celestine Madeiros?

1230
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:52,400
I've never known any Puerto Rican.

1231
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,100
And Steve Bentkowski, this Polish guy?

1232
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:57,300
No Poles either.

1233
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:59,000
And this man? Bloody Gyp?

1234
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,300
Nobody I know.

1235
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:02,200
- What?
- He's never heard of him.

1236
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:04,500
And I suppose you don't know Mancini.

1237
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,700
Mancini who? There are so many Mancinis.

1238
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:09,700
There are also many Morellis...

1239
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,000
but Mancini was in your gang.

1240
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:17,400
Have you ever heard of
Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti?

1241
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:19,100
Sacco.

1242
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:21,700
Yes...

1243
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,300
I read that he was prosecuted

1244
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,700
and tried for robbery.

1245
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,300
Exactly. Do you know where?

1246
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:35,300
Nicola Sacco. Sacco.

1247
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:41,200
But if you know Mancini,
why don't you ask him?

1248
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:44,100
These men are Sacco and Vanzetti.

1249
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:46,100
Have you ever seen them?

1250
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:54,800
No.

1251
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,700
They don't seem like types
who do armed robberies.

1252
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:02,800
It's hard to judge only by
their faces, of course, but...

1253
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:07,100
they could be radicals and extremists,
but they don't seem like robbers to me.

1254
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Do you think these two look alike?

1255
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,900
No, not at all.

1256
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,500
Did you use a Colt 32?
- No.

1257
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:22,100
A Spanish pistol.
A Star.

1258
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,300
During the trial...

1259
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:26,800
you said about the bullet
that killed Berardelli:

1260
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,500
"In my opinion

1261
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,400
it was probably shot by that pistol."

1262
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,200
What does that mean?

1263
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:37,500
It hoped that Moore would ask me
more about that in the court,

1264
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:40,000
but he didn't. I would have said that...

1265
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:42,000
it could be several American pistols...

1266
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:45,600
A Colt 32 can shoot that bullet,

1267
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,500
any Colt 32.

1268
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:51,600
In other words,
not necessarily the one of Sacco?

1269
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
There's been no test
proving it was Sacco's pistol.

1270
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,200
You must have said that in the court.

1271
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:06,900
You said several American pistols?

1272
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,400
Yes...

1273
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:12,600
and an Austrian, the Steyr,

1274
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:16,300
and a Spanish who can
shoot that type of bullet.

1275
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:18,500
The Spanish Star.

1276
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,900
Here's Mancini's weapon file...

1277
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:23,500
It's a Spanish make,
a Star Automatic, to be precise.

1278
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:27,800
Can I see this pistol?

1279
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:31,400
For an old friend?
Of course, come with me.

1280
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:37,900
Only because it's you.

1281
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,300
It never fails.

1282
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:45,500
The archive-number is 33.410.52.

1283
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,700
But...

1284
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,100
This is Nicola Sacco.

1285
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:00,600
- Nicola Sacco, without doubt.
- Thank you, Mrs. Splaine.

1286
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,400
This is the man who fired on the guard.

1287
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:05,300
He wore a beret.

1288
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:09,900
He looks like many other men,
but it's him alright.

1289
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,200
- Very good, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1290
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:22,500
Yes, he was one of them.

1291
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:27,500
He's the man who was driving.

1292
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:31,600
Unfortunately, Captain Proctor
has passed away.

1293
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,600
Therefore I must still rely on
his testimony from the trial...

1294
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:38,900
Why not bring in another expert?

1295
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:43,600
As the previous test indisputably
has proven the guilt of Nicola Sacco,

1296
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,400
all new attempts to reopen
the trial are useless.

1297
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:53,100
As for hearing Celestine Madeiros,
who at the moment is on death row,

1298
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:55,700
I must conclude that it is of no relevance.

1299
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:59,700
It would be a groundless testimony
from an unreliable man.

1300
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,700
To annul the verdict based on
this type of evidence

1301
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,800
would seriously undermine truth and justice.

1302
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:07,600
You are the one that undermines justice.

1303
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:11,300
No one dares to admit the mysterious
disappearance of the Morelli case file,

1304
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:15,900
that Mancini's weapon has disappeared from
the Attorney General's office in New York.

1305
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:20,200
- What do you want to insinuate?
- I don't insinuate, I'm pointing at facts.

1306
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,200
No, you're making accusations.

1307
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,700
You're accusing me and a public office,

1308
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:29,200
and also ex-minister Palmer, who is now
the Magistrate of the United States.

1309
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:34,200
You accuse everybody of conspiracy to put
Sacco and Vanzetti in the electric chair.

1310
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,500
Exactly my point.

1311
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:41,800
The court hereby rejects

1312
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:45,100
the request to reopen the trial.

1313
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:48,700
It is now the hope of the court
that nothing will prevent the sentence.

1314
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:52,000
I'm very thankful to you, Mr. Thayer.

1315
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:55,200
You have helped me to
completely lose the hopes

1316
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:58,700
I have had for justice
and for this nation.

1317
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:02,300
I will never again put my
foot in a courtroom.

1318
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:04,900
Never more exert a profession

1319
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:08,000
that forces to me to deal
with people like you.

1320
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
People for whom I only
feel the deepest contempt.

1321
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:46,000
"Not even a dog deserves to die...

1322
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,800
based on the evidence
presented in this trial.

1323
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,400
- Radical?
- Conservative.

1324
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:52,600
The Springfield Republican.

1325
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:55,600
Very good. It speaks only of
the most important matters.

1326
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,200
- What's that?
- The petition asking you to intervene.

1327
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:02,500
Signed by 474,842 people.

1328
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:05,000
Here are more petitions,

1329
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:09,300
signed by the universities of
Yale, Columbia, Kansas, Ohio...

1330
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,300
- Missouri, Minnesota...
- Just tell me the ones missing.

1331
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:14,800
None, sir.

1332
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,600
- Counselor Thompson, sir.
- Let him in.

1333
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
In conclusion,

1334
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,600
to this date,

1335
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,800
our office has received more than

1336
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,800
17,000 letters and telegrams.

1337
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:31,600
I'm requesting that you hire more personnel.

1338
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:35,100
- To reinforce the secretariat.
- Very well, we will speak about that.

1339
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:38,200
- Adams.
- Sir?

1340
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,500
Good morning, Mr. Thompson.

1341
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:52,200
- Please be seated.
- Good morning, Mr. Fuller.

1342
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:57,000
Governor, I've come to ask
you to reopen the trial.

1343
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,700
There are fair reasons to suspect

1344
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:01,900
bias of prosecutor Katzman...

1345
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:04,600
- ...and of judge Thayer...
- Do you mind to sit down?

1346
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,500
These are very serious accusations.

1347
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:11,100
A cigar?

1348
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:16,700
We are very far from the terror climate
and persecutions established by Palmer.

1349
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:20,800
Palmer is now gone... American democratic
institutions have been restored...

1350
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,700
- ...then, why...?
- Mr. Thompson...

1351
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:25,300
I know what you're going to say

1352
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:28,900
and you know what my answer will be.

1353
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:32,300
You want to save the lives
of Sacco and Vanzetti?

1354
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,500
You know I can't intervene in
the decisions of judge Thayer.

1355
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:38,900
There is only one way.

1356
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:45,300
Bartolomeo Vanzetti,
have you got anything to say

1357
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:49,100
before the sentence of death
will be passed upon you?

1358
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:57,000
Yes. I want to say that I am innocent.

1359
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:01,100
In all my life I've never
killed or robbed anyone.

1360
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:06,000
I've never spilled a drop of blood.

1361
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:13,100
I have fought for a better world.

1362
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:19,200
I've fought exploitation of human beings.

1363
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:24,900
That's the reason why I'm
standing here now. None else.

1364
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:31,300
There is something Mr. Katzman said,
that keeps ringing in my mind:

1365
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:35,500
"Mr. Vanzetti came to this
prosperous country...

1366
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,800
in order to become rich!"

1367
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:45,700
It's a phrase that amuses to me.

1368
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:49,700
I never wanted to become rich.

1369
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,200
That's not the reason why
I'm standing here now.

1370
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:57,700
I'm paying for mistakes made by others.

1371
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:03,000
I am suffering because I am a radical,

1372
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:08,300
and indeed I am a radical,

1373
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,600
and because I was an Italian,

1374
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:18,600
and indeed I am an Italian.

1375
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:22,800
I am so convinced to be right that

1376
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:27,100
if you could kill me two times,

1377
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:29,900
and if I could be reborn two other times,

1378
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:34,900
I would live again to do exactly the same.

1379
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:41,100
Nicola Sacco.

1380
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,800
My comrade Nicola!

1381
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:51,800
Perhaps I'm a better babbler than he is,

1382
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,500
but many times, many times...

1383
01:42:56,900 --> 01:43:00,300
when I hear his voice,
when I think about him

1384
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,700
This man...

1385
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,300
called thief and assassin

1386
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:12,100
and whom you are going to kill...

1387
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:19,000
When your bones, Mr. Thayer,
will be dispersed by time,

1388
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:22,400
and your name and your law

1389
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:29,000
are nothing but a deem rememoring
of a cursed past,

1390
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:35,300
his name, the name of Nicola Sacco,

1391
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,500
will live in the hearts of the people.

1392
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,400
We are thankful to you.

1393
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,800
Without you, we would be nobody.

1394
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:55,800
A good shoemaker...

1395
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,500
and a good fish-peddler, sure,

1396
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:03,100
but never in our full life

1397
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:04,900
could we hope

1398
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:08,400
to do so much work

1399
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:12,000
for tolerance, for justice,

1400
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:15,000
for man's understanding of man.

1401
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:20,000
You have given meaning

1402
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,500
to the lives of two poor immigrants.

1403
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:28,000
Nicola Sacco, have you got anything to say

1404
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:31,600
before the sentence of death
will be passed upon you?

1405
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:38,700
No.

1406
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:48,600
On this day, the 9th of April,
in the year of our Lord, 1927,

1407
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:52,900
this court sentence

1408
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:57,200
Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti

1409
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:01,000
to suffer the punishment of death

1410
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:03,600
by electrocution of their bodies.

1411
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,700
This is the sentence of the law.

1412
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:25,200
Why don't you have a look?

1413
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:27,800
Look out, it's beautiful.

1414
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,000
Look.

1415
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:42,000
What do you want to see, Bart?

1416
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,400
Have you lost your hope?

1417
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:45,800
After seven years...

1418
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:49,800
I want an end to all this.

1419
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:19,200
We've had discussions in the Committee.

1420
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:22,000
Did you read the petition
written by Thompson

1421
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:23,700
to Governor Fuller?

1422
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:29,000
- Yes, I read it.
- And what do you think?

1423
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,200
It's good.

1424
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,900
Modify two or three things...

1425
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:34,200
but it's good.

1426
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:38,200
- It's good.
- Did you sign it?

1427
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:42,000
Yes, I signed it.

1428
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:49,700
Virginia!

1429
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:55,800
- Have you lost your faith?
- Nicola did not sign.

1430
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:59,900
You know how Nicola is.

1431
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:04,900
He has lost faith.

1432
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:11,500
I hope that some comrade
of the defense committee

1433
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:16,200
can make him change his mind.

1434
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,700
Virginia.

1435
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,400
Virginia!

1436
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:32,600
Bartolomeo Vanzetti, sir.

1437
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:34,800
Come here, Mr. Vanzetti.

1438
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:38,400
I've been eager to meet you for a long time.
I am Governor Fuller.

1439
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:40,900
Bartolomeo Vanzetti.

1440
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:52,700
- I want to return to my cell.
- Please.

1441
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:54,900
Have a seat.

1442
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:06,500
So you are the famous Bartolomeo Vanzetti?

1443
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:10,100
I've never had the intention to be famous.

1444
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:12,700
But now you are.

1445
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:15,000
You have submitted a petition

1446
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,200
in order to obtain my mercy,
and to pardon you.

1447
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:20,400
- Are you sorry?
- No.

1448
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:22,900
It may sound strange, Mr. Vanzetti,

1449
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:28,700
but I would like to ask for your advice.
What would you do in my place?

1450
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:33,300
You are the authority.

1451
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:35,700
Let's see.

1452
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:38,800
You are an anarchist,

1453
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
I'm a conservative.

1454
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,400
In addition I am the governor

1455
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:47,000
of one of the most conservative
states in America.

1456
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,300
What makes you think that
I would have mercy for you?

1457
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:52,300
I understand what you mean.

1458
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:54,100
Why should an anarchist

1459
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:56,500
believe in the mercy of the bourgeoisie.

1460
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:59,700
I would like to know...

1461
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:02,300
how do you regard power relations

1462
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,600
within what you call bourgeoisie.

1463
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:05,800
Mr. Fuller...

1464
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:09,100
you're ignoring my case,

1465
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:11,300
my petition for mercy.

1466
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:14,100
You are fighting against a system...

1467
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:15,800
represented by president Coolidge,

1468
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:17,100
judge Thayer, the governor...

1469
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:18,800
and every guard of this prison.

1470
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,800
Do you think that this chain,

1471
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:22,100
this system,

1472
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:25,800
is so weak

1473
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:29,200
that an important person, like a governor,

1474
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:33,900
would grant mercy for an anarchist,

1475
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:36,000
an enemy of the system?

1476
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:38,800
So now you admit...

1477
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:40,500
that we were condemned for being anarchists,

1478
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:42,100
not for being thieves and assassins.

1479
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:43,400
Well...

1480
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:49,200
Suppose you were not an anarchist or
a radical, and was accused of homicide,

1481
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:53,100
do you think you would have got such
red-blooded reactions from the world?

1482
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:55,500
Of course not, Mr. Vanzetti.

1483
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,800
You do not appeal to the authorities
like an ordinary citizen,

1484
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:01,800
but like an anarchist,

1485
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:04,500
supported by a global movement.

1486
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:09,400
An act of mercy might cause certain
opinions about challenging the system,

1487
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:12,300
or could be regarded as an act of weakness.

1488
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:15,200
I only want justice, Mr. Fuller.

1489
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:18,700
You don't think justice can be
part of an authoritarian system.

1490
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:21,200
What if you were in the power...

1491
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,600
would you grant mercy?

1492
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:28,900
I don't ask for mercy, I only want justice.

1493
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:35,000
But I want to repeat that this system is
based on violence and not on justice.

1494
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
You, Vanzetti, an anarchist,

1495
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:38,900
is talking about violence?

1496
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:42,500
I've heard that nonsense
for seven years now.

1497
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:44,000
I already told you.

1498
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:48,300
This is a society where we are forced
to live, and we want to destroy

1499
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:50,100
any society based on violence.

1500
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,100
To beg to be alive is violent.

1501
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:57,000
The misery which we are subjects to.

1502
01:50:57,300 --> 01:50:58,800
So many men are violent.

1503
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:01,100
Money is violent. The war.

1504
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,100
Including the fear to die.

1505
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:07,700
The fear that we all feel, every day,

1506
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:11,700
is also violent.

1507
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:16,600
So, Mr. Fuller, don't simply say to me...

1508
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:19,800
Bartolomeo Vanzetti,
your petition is rejected.

1509
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:23,900
Excuse me, Governor,

1510
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:27,700
remember that you have to be at the palace
for the reception of Charles Lindbergh.

1511
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,100
Very well.

1512
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:33,100
I haven't decided yet.

1513
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:38,200
Before my decision I wanted
to speak with you.

1514
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:49,600
You are a symbol, Mr. Vanzetti,

1515
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:53,100
but the man behind it
is about to be executed.

1516
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:59,800
What should we save?
The man or the symbol?

1517
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:08,800
Nicola...

1518
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:19,000
I just want to say that you did
good not asking for mercy.

1519
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:22,000
Only an assassin would do that.

1520
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:28,500
My son,

1521
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:34,900
instead of crying be strong

1522
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:40,600
Be brave

1523
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:45,200
and comfort your mother

1524
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:51,800
Don't cry

1525
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:57,900
for the tears are wasted

1526
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:04,200
Let not

1527
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:09,800
also the years be wasted

1528
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:16,900
Forgive me, son,

1529
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:21,700
for this unjust death

1530
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:26,000
which takes your father

1531
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:31,600
from your side

1532
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:36,500
Forgive me all

1533
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,500
who are my friends

1534
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:46,300
I am with you,

1535
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:50,600
so do not cry

1536
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:55,400
My dear son,

1537
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:59,000
I have dreamed of you day and night.

1538
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:02,500
I don't know if I'm alive or dead.

1539
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,200
I would have liked to embrace
you and your mother.

1540
01:54:09,100 --> 01:54:12,600
Forgive me, my son, for this unjust death

1541
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:15,500
which takes your father from your side.

1542
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:19,100
Today they will crucify our bodies,

1543
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,400
but they can't destroy our ideas.

1544
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:26,200
They are for the youth of the future to come,

1545
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:28,700
for young people like you.

1546
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:32,000
Remember, my son...

1547
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,400
in the play of happiness,

1548
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:37,200
don't you use all for yourself.

1549
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:40,900
Comfort those in need...

1550
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:44,700
your neighbor, those who cry,

1551
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:48,500
the persecuted, the oppressed.

1552
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,400
To all who might need it.

1553
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:10,000
Remember, my son...

1554
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:14,000
in the play of happiness,

1555
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:16,400
don't you use all for yourself.

1556
01:55:34,100 --> 01:55:35,900
Remember, my son...

1557
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:38,300
in the play of happiness...

1558
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:46,800
They can't destroy our ideas.

1559
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:52,000
They are for the youth of the future to come,

1560
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:53,600
for young people like you.

1561
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:21,900
Good bye, my love.

1562
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:24,000
My son.

1563
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:26,200
Comrades.

1564
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:37,800
According to the law,
I declare you dead.
