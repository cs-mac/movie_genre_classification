1
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:19,405
Never.

2
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:23,501
Never, never.

3
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:27,843
Never, never, never.

4
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,041
- Liz! Liz! Liz!

5
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,010
Okay. Ladies and gentlemen,

6
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:54,277
we're here to announce
our theater company's next production.

7
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:57,674
Noel Coward's comic masterpiece,
Private Lives,

8
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:01,442
starring none other than
Miss Elizabeth Taylor

9
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:05,570
and one of the greatest stage actors
of all time,

10
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,340
Mr. Richard Burton.

11
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:12,433
Liz! Liz! Liz! Liz!

12
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:15,840
Liz, does this mean marriage
number three for you and Richard?

13
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,537
No, I can assure you that Richard and I
have entered into this venture

14
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:25,203
for purely creative reasons.

15
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:29,607
And it seemed to me that since
Richard had, not so very long ago,

16
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:33,837
spectacularly re-conquered Broadway
in Equus and Camelot,

17
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:37,366
then I really ought to
cash in on the fact that...

18
00:01:37,432 --> 00:01:39,933
Well, I was pretty certain I had
his phone number somewhere at home.

19
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,704
-- Richard, can you confirm that?

20
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,709
- What, that she had my phone number?

21
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,176
No, we want to showcase a great play.
We believe it's long overdue a revival.

22
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,037
So absolutely no plans
to get back together again?

23
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:57,236
None.

24
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,368
But you don't mind people thinking that?

25
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:02,241
Er, people can think what they like.
We're...

26
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:04,741
We're actors
about to do a play together.

27
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,833
But the ad in today's New York Times,

28
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,343
which I gather, Miss Taylor,
you designed yourself,

29
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:11,071
that kind of begs the question.

30
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,742
Yes.
- it's just an advert.

31
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,709
A heart with an arrow through it
and the words "together again"?

32
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:23,138
Well, of course it says that.

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,507
That's the whole basis
for Private Lives.

34
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,572
I mean,
it's not like she's used a photo of us

35
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,338
- and the words "twice spliced," is it?

36
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:34,242
That would have made no sense
in the context of the play.

37
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,708
- Liz! Liz! Liz!
- Liz! Liz! Liz!

38
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:39,133
The car's this way.

39
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,007
Elizabeth!

40
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,701
- Richard?
- Can I...

41
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:53,735
- You okay?
- Okay.

42
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,970
- Come on, let's wait in the lobby.

43
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:58,204
God, it's a bloody circus.

44
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:02,071
Why didn't you tell me

45
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,041
you were going to put
an ad in the paper?

46
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,906
I felt like a bloody idiot.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,773
And the wording? It didn't occur to you
it might cause a bit of a stir?

48
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:11,204
It was last minute, Richard!

49
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,743
I just suddenly thought,
what a great idea!

50
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,072
To get people talking.
Which it has done.

51
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,507
The pre-sales
have gone through the roof.

52
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,635
You know,
plenty of people told me not to do this.

53
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:23,234
Well, nobody's said
a single bad word to me about it,

54
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:25,174
so you must just have wussy advisers!

55
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:28,870
I ignored them. I go my own way.
You know that.

56
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:30,341
Sure I do.

57
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:33,240
Well, don't let me regret it.

58
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:40,401
I'm ready now, Chen.

59
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:46,234
Toodle-oo!

60
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,107
Daddy! Daddy!

61
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:30,971
- Maria.
- Hi.

62
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:35,033
Liza, how are you, love?

63
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:38,770
Thank God you made it. We were worried.
What are you wearing?

64
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,541
- It's a mink. Is it too much?

65
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:44,632
- No.
- I just...

66
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,200
I didn't want to seem
like an old codger.

67
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:49,505
Richard! Richard Burton!

68
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:54,206
Mom's been celebrating a lot.
See you later.

69
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:02,103
Mmm!

70
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,101
- Where were you?
- Sorry I'm late, I'm... Technical stuff.

71
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:11,643
What, for a poetry recital?

72
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,370
Can't they just twiddle
a few knobs on the night?

73
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:18,433
We're charging quite a lot of money.
Can't afford any cock-ups.

74
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:22,676
Thank you. Here we are.

75
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:26,209
No, I don't. I told you on the phone.

76
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:28,971
- Sure you did.
- I very occasionally...

77
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:31,507
That's what I imagined you'd be doing.

78
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:34,509
All the same,
I'll have a Tab if they've got one.

79
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:36,873
-- Oh, I love this one.

80
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,773
- Let's dance.
- I can't. I can't...

81
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,834
Richard! It's my birthday.
I get what I want!

82
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:44,672
- You get what you want anyway!

83
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:50,039
No kidding. Watch and learn.

84
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:02,333
Ah! That's better.

85
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:03,671
- Whoo!
- Oh!

86
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:06,368
Don't you just want to sit down
for a bit?

87
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,444
No, I don't!

88
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:12,841
I am 50 years of age, Richard,
and I just announced it to the world.

89
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:16,002
I wanna get drunk and dance a lot!

90
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:21,840
♪ Love to love you, baby... ♪

91
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,009
Thank you.

92
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,274
Thank you.

93
00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:08,868
Now this one I do know!

94
00:07:40,132 --> 00:07:43,474
Oh, for a glass of vintage
that has been coca-I'd along age

95
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:45,635
in the deep-delved earth.

96
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,805
That's a vodka, right?

97
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:55,406
No, no, no, I've had enough.

98
00:07:59,265 --> 00:08:02,243
I don't want to be half cut
for the recital.

99
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,475
I couldn't bear that.

100
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:13,501
- Hello, Pockmark.
- Hello, Lumpy.

101
00:08:15,632 --> 00:08:18,667
Been a good night. We played a blinder!

102
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:21,073
Mmm. Thank you for coming.

103
00:08:22,165 --> 00:08:24,234
I wasn't sure you would.

104
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:27,804
How long has it been?
I was trying to remember.

105
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:29,899
- Five years.
- God.

106
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:34,441
- Yeah, thank heaven for the newspapers!

107
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:39,003
Oh, Christ, this bloody neck.

108
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,106
I swear, Elizabeth,
at times I'm like a cripple!

109
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,803
I had to do these fight scenes
in Camelot.

110
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,934
Some nights I hardly had the strength

111
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:52,637
to pull my sword out of its sheath
and wave it around a bit.

112
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,642
How very unlike you, Richard.

113
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,969
- Stop it!

114
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,771
You've the mind of a collier!

115
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:03,835
Hmm.

116
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,007
I'm gonna do King Lear next.

117
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:11,676
I spoke to a producer
who says he'll back it.

118
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:14,006
You'll be fantastic.

119
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:18,777
- Well, I'd better...
- Don't. Stay.

120
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:24,174
Stay here. Just stay!
Not anything else. Just...

121
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,500
How do you fuck, anyway?
You can barely move.

122
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:32,734
There are ways and means, my love.

123
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:35,606
Do you remember that train
we took to New York?

124
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:39,337
We just lay there and let
the rocking of the carriage do the job.

125
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:43,838
You know, I really should go.

126
00:09:43,932 --> 00:09:47,001
No! No, no, I meant it, Richard.
I meant it!

127
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:52,307
I'll make some tea
and you can read a book

128
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,468
and then you can sleep.

129
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:04,837
What's she like?

130
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:08,935
Huh?

131
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:13,133
Your new girlfriend, Sally.

132
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:24,133
Do you really want to talk about that?

133
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:28,805
Well, just... What sort of woman is she?
I'm interested.

134
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,276
She's lovely.

135
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:36,743
Hmm. Good.

136
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:41,305
Victor's a lawyer.

137
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,676
He's Mexican and he's charming.

138
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:47,670
Terrific.

139
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:53,100
Somebody told me she was like Sybil.

140
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:57,777
My wife Sybil?

141
00:10:57,999 --> 00:10:59,807
Yeah. Your ex-wife.

142
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,577
Who told you that, anyway? She's...

143
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,470
What? What's she like?

144
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:12,342
- I'm sorry. I...
- Go to your room!

145
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:15,108
It's 3:00.

146
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:22,905
Richard,

147
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:28,273
I had an idea about doing another play.
A Coward.

148
00:11:28,332 --> 00:11:30,606
Elizabeth, I swear to God,
if you don't shut up,

149
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,302
I'm gonna climb out of this bed,
get in my car

150
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,808
and drive back to the Dorchester
in my bloody underpants!

151
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,109
Oh, Christ.

152
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:38,139
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

153
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:41,436
- Elizabeth.
- I'm so sorry.

154
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:45,272
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
-It's quite all right.

155
00:13:45,332 --> 00:13:47,310
- Was there a problem?
- No.

156
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,740
- Hi, I'm Elizabeth.
- John, nice to meet you.

157
00:13:49,798 --> 00:13:51,299
- Hi. Hi, John.
- Kathryn.

158
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,639
- Hi, Kathryn! Hi. Hi, Jane.
- Hi.

159
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:00,266
Hello, Richard.

160
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:03,738
Hello, Elizabeth.

161
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:06,273
Okay, let's make a start.

162
00:14:06,332 --> 00:14:09,741
If you want to pull up some chairs,
we'll have a little read.

163
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:12,935
Oh, uh... Thanks.

164
00:14:16,432 --> 00:14:18,273
I got you a present.

165
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,134
It's tradition!

166
00:14:21,232 --> 00:14:23,971
The producer always buys the star
a little welcome gift.

167
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:28,171
- Sorry, everyone.
-It's fine. We got ages.

168
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:31,402
- Chen, I need my Coke.
- Oh. Right here.

169
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:33,303
Open it.

170
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,240
- Oh, it's beautiful.
-Isn't it?

171
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:38,936
- Yeah, it's gorgeous.
-It's Cartier.

172
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:42,943
So, if we could get started...
We break for lunch in 20.

173
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:44,477
Of course.

174
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:47,474
- Okay.
- Thank you.

175
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:50,271
- Your cardigan.
- Thank you, darling.

176
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:54,303
- I'll leave your bag up there.
- Thank you.

177
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,842
- Here's your readers.
- Thank you. You can all go, babe.

178
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,636
Come on, guys, let's leave them to it.

179
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:06,006
Christ, if we have that many
turn up on our first night,

180
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:08,475
-we'll consider ourselves blessed.
- Hmm.

181
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:12,442
Great. So...
Can I first welcome you all...

182
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:15,500
lam so looking forward to this.
Can I just say that?

183
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:20,004
A great director, great fellow actors,

184
00:15:20,232 --> 00:15:23,971
and a play which I'm sure
will do none of us a disservice.

185
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:26,804
Well, it seems to have passed muster
so far in its life.

186
00:15:26,898 --> 00:15:28,467
I know. I can't wait to read it.

187
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:36,609
Elizabeth.

188
00:15:36,665 --> 00:15:37,768
What?

189
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:42,901
- Well, I'd rather assumed you might...
- What, read it? God, no, no.

190
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:46,941
I always make it a rule never to look
at anything until I'm starring in it.

191
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:48,102
Keeps it fresh.

192
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:50,733
What, you've never read it? Ever?

193
00:15:51,598 --> 00:15:53,167
I mean, you didn't think
it might be a good idea

194
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:54,936
just to take a glance
before we got going?

195
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:58,068
No, I told you,
I like to keep things fresh.

196
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:01,110
That's why rehearsals
are called rehearsals.

197
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:03,109
Don't lecture me on the bloody theater.

198
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:05,642
Okay. Tell you what.

199
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:11,439
Let's take lunch now, come back at 2:00,
prompt and start over again.

200
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:13,840
How does that sound?

201
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,467
- See you later.
- See you later.

202
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:19,668
I'll see you after lunch,
I'll take some air.

203
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:21,970
Great. I'll just get my bag.

204
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,475
Gosh.

205
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:26,902
- See you later.
- See you after lunch.

206
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:38,836
Richard?

207
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,967
Did he seem okay to you?

208
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:43,838
- What?
- Milton.

209
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:46,407
Bailed kind of early.

210
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,243
I think he'll be fine.

211
00:16:50,165 --> 00:16:54,234
- He has an excellent reputation.
- Good, good.

212
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:57,174
'Cause I trust you so much on this.

213
00:16:57,265 --> 00:17:00,902
I mean, I'd never fall out with you
about the theater.

214
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:04,068
"The world's greatest stage actor."

215
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:07,133
At the launch. That was me.
I put that in.

216
00:17:07,232 --> 00:17:08,470
Right.

217
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:12,801
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me. It's true.

218
00:17:16,065 --> 00:17:19,941
So, I got us a table at Sardi's.
The best table.

219
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:23,773
And the linguini and clams
are still to die for.

220
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:27,166
- What? You gotta eat lunch.
- I can't.

221
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:31,637
I'm meeting Sally,
back at the apartment.

222
00:17:31,732 --> 00:17:35,142
I'm seeing Mike first to sort out
some business, but she's joining us.

223
00:17:35,232 --> 00:17:36,403
Oh!

224
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:38,410
Oh, I...

225
00:17:39,598 --> 00:17:40,803
Right.

226
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:47,666
Is she staying around? Sally is?
For all the rehearsals?

227
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:50,734
Well, what did you and I do
when the other was working?

228
00:17:50,932 --> 00:17:52,308
That was us, Richard.

229
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:57,574
No, no, it's great, I mean...

230
00:17:58,565 --> 00:18:01,237
No, I just assumed that she'd,
I don't know,

231
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:04,106
have other stuff to get on with
back in Europe, but...

232
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:07,143
No, it'll be lovely for you
to have the company.

233
00:18:07,232 --> 00:18:08,675
Yes, it will.

234
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:11,440
Well, I'd better go.

235
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:14,807
I'm only just around the corner.

236
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:17,965
Thank you for the scarf.

237
00:18:57,498 --> 00:19:00,635
Any more news on the Lear deal?

238
00:19:00,732 --> 00:19:04,938
- No. I'll chase it up this afternoon.
- Good, if you could.

239
00:19:14,598 --> 00:19:18,508
"Thou shouldst not have been old
till thou hadst been wise."

240
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:24,106
Elizabeth. Of course she hasn't read it.

241
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:26,807
I mean, that's our girl.
That's what she does.

242
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,806
Doesn't mean it isn't irritating.

243
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:30,569
Well, so what, though?

244
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:33,666
She just works differently to me,
that's all.

245
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:38,408
You know, when we did Cleopatra,

246
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:42,674
I'd come straight from the Old Vic.

247
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,903
I went over to Hollywood
and she walked out onto the sound stage.

248
00:19:48,165 --> 00:19:49,836
She was just tits and make up.

249
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:56,475
And then we had our first scene together
and she did nothing.

250
00:19:57,765 --> 00:20:00,641
Nothing. No voice,

251
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:04,901
no movement, no performance.

252
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,407
I thought she'd had
a bloody stroke or something.

253
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:14,943
And then I saw the rushes

254
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:18,435
and I was acting Antony.

255
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:23,773
But she was Cleopatra.

256
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:29,269
She just sort of bleeds into a role.

257
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:32,267
Like osmosis.

258
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,434
- Hard to rehearse around.
- Impossible at times.

259
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:40,736
But God, she's good, Mike.
She's so bloody good.

260
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:46,838
Anyway, this last scene's
a bit of a worry.

261
00:20:47,264 --> 00:20:50,175
I'm afraid I won't be able
to carry her on.

262
00:20:50,264 --> 00:20:51,264
What?

263
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:54,674
Cordelia, Lear. "Howl, howl, howl."

264
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:58,334
How will I do that?
My arms are bloody useless at times.

265
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:00,466
Then don't take it on!
Three hours on stage every night...

266
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:03,066
No, no. No, I've made promises.

267
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:05,309
To myself.

268
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:08,132
I must do it.

269
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:12,768
What's the matter, darling?
Are you hungry?

270
00:21:12,832 --> 00:21:13,901
Not a bit.

271
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:16,772
You're very strange all of a sudden
and rather cruel.

272
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:20,970
Just because I'm feminine, it doesn't
mean I'm crafty and calculating.

273
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:22,974
I never said you were
either of those things.

274
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:25,770
I hate these half...  Sorry.

275
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:28,335
Half-masculine.
Can I take the line again?

276
00:21:28,431 --> 00:21:30,068
Well, sure, go ahead.

277
00:21:30,132 --> 00:21:33,598
I hate these half-masculine women
who go banging about.

278
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:35,643
I hate anyone who goes banging about.

279
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:40,074
I should think you needed
a little quiet womanliness after Amanda.

280
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:45,768
Why do you keep on talking about her?

281
00:21:45,832 --> 00:21:49,833
That's good. That's a great idea, Rich,
holding the lighter away from her.

282
00:21:49,932 --> 00:21:52,103
Works for me!

283
00:21:52,165 --> 00:21:56,075
Right.
Let's go back to Amanda's entrance.

284
00:21:56,465 --> 00:21:58,568
- Oh! That's me.
- Great, Rich.

285
00:21:58,832 --> 00:22:01,673
- Whoa!
- That's great, darling.

286
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:02,970
- Ooh!
'YOU okay?

287
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:04,804
You were wonderful.

288
00:22:05,498 --> 00:22:08,942
- Thank you.
- No, it was... No, it was...

289
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:12,167
Well, you were just funny.

290
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,667
- You all right, love?
- Course I'm all right.

291
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:20,307
- You eat enough at lunch?
- Probably not as much as you did.

292
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:24,009
Chen, can I have my chair?

293
00:22:24,331 --> 00:22:28,140
Okay. From the top.
When everybody's ready.

294
00:22:30,732 --> 00:22:33,608
- Do you want these?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.

295
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:36,470
And...

296
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:38,938
Mandy!

297
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:47,638
Mandy!

298
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:57,404
Elizabeth, that's your cue,
from off-stage.

299
00:22:58,231 --> 00:23:03,767
Off-stage? Oh, well, if I'm off-stage,
can't somebody else do it?

300
00:23:04,898 --> 00:23:09,399
No. It has to be your voice
and you are answering him. So...

301
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:13,436
Oh, okay. Okay, honey. Sorry. Hang on.

302
00:23:13,999 --> 00:23:16,499
- Honey, what page are we on?
- Page five.

303
00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:19,465
Five. Hang on.

304
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:22,999
-- Okay. Here we are.

305
00:23:25,932 --> 00:23:28,409
- Mandy!
- What?

306
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:33,801
Come outside. The view is wonderful.

307
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:38,068
- I'm still damp from the bath.
-  Bath.

308
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:39,966
Wait a minute.

309
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:42,469
I shall catch...

310
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:44,732
What's that?

311
00:23:45,331 --> 00:23:46,673
Pneumonia.

312
00:23:51,665 --> 00:23:54,438
Er, can we just take a break?

313
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:56,802
What?

314
00:23:56,898 --> 00:23:58,671
Yeah, I need to talk to costume,

315
00:23:58,765 --> 00:24:01,333
because it says here
I'm wearing a negligee.

316
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:04,466
- And I don't wanna look...
-Can I have a word, love?

317
00:24:04,565 --> 00:24:06,907
What are you doing, Richard?

318
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:11,136
- You sound really smashed.
- I am not! I'm fine.

319
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:12,641
What have you taken?

320
00:24:14,765 --> 00:24:17,265
Beyond the Coke. The always-open Coke!

321
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,570
Which, given that you can drink me
under the table, Elizabeth,

322
00:24:19,631 --> 00:24:22,165
I can't imagine is solely responsible
for the way you're behaving.

323
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,632
Some pills.

324
00:24:27,264 --> 00:24:29,572
I have to take certain pills
for my tummy.

325
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:32,074
You know all the trouble
I had in Puerto Vallarta.

326
00:24:32,131 --> 00:24:33,939
It was after that,
and then some years ago...

327
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:38,500
Just don't take any more of 'em.
You're making a spectacle of yourself.

328
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:50,173
Yeah, you might think about...

329
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:53,434
No, I'm fine.

330
00:25:18,331 --> 00:25:20,070
What a place!

331
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:23,242
- You know, it's Rock Hudson's.
- Oh!

332
00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:26,435
- He's letting me borrow it.
-It's fabulous.

333
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:30,675
No, it's an apartment. This is fabulous.

334
00:25:31,098 --> 00:25:33,133
You come to Grandma.

335
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,106
There isn't a single book
in the entire apartment.

336
00:25:35,164 --> 00:25:36,574
Dad, stop it!

337
00:25:36,631 --> 00:25:38,905
A television the size of
the Odeon Leicester Square...

338
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:42,636
-- We wanna eat you!

339
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:45,801
Gee, look at these two,
it's like they've never seen one before.

340
00:25:45,898 --> 00:25:48,068
We've never seen a nice one before.
You two were horrible.

341
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:51,666
Yeah, well, you'll be pleased to know
that we're going.

342
00:25:51,765 --> 00:25:54,641
- Okay, bye-bye.
'Bye-bye. Bye, darling.

343
00:25:54,732 --> 00:25:58,608
We're gonna see you again
before we lose you to this extravaganza.

344
00:25:58,665 --> 00:26:01,006
- Say bye. Bye-bye.

345
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:03,838
I love you. Don't worry about... Okay?

346
00:26:04,431 --> 00:26:07,170
- Goodbye.
- Oh. I need to put him to bed.

347
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:11,501
Oh, girls?

348
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:12,632
- Yeah?
- Hmm?

349
00:26:12,732 --> 00:26:14,835
- You all right for cash?
- Yes, Daddy.

350
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:16,910
- All right.
- Come on.

351
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:24,739
What are you doing?

352
00:26:25,298 --> 00:26:27,640
I'm getting a drink. Do you want one?

353
00:26:28,598 --> 00:26:30,132
Could this be one of
your little occasions?

354
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:32,470
- I came here to work.
- I know.

355
00:26:33,331 --> 00:26:36,968
- But that doesn't mean...
- Elizabeth! This is serious!

356
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:38,303
We open in 10 days.

357
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:42,433
You're not remembering the words,
your cues, any of the business.

358
00:26:42,498 --> 00:26:46,964
- We both know why that is. Don't we?
- I'm not doing that anymore.

359
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,269
Not since yesterday morning,
as a matter of fact.

360
00:26:49,331 --> 00:26:53,605
I'm not taking anything...
except the bare bones.

361
00:26:54,131 --> 00:26:57,337
Because they do... They can befuddle me,
Richard, it's true.

362
00:26:57,431 --> 00:27:00,671
They can befuddle me
so, for the sake of the show,

363
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:03,675
I'm putting my health to one side

364
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:10,174
and, well, you can expect a different
Elizabeth from hereon in, I promise.

365
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:14,668
Okay, good.
Well, let's work on some scenes.

366
00:27:15,565 --> 00:27:18,099
It's the third act that needs the work

367
00:27:18,164 --> 00:27:21,802
but let's just start from the top
and mark the action.

368
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,235
You have no idea, have you?

369
00:27:25,098 --> 00:27:31,600
You stand there and you tell me
that I have to pull myself together.

370
00:27:34,998 --> 00:27:38,499
This is difficult, Richard.
This is a difficult situation.

371
00:27:40,131 --> 00:27:43,904
Well, I wasn't going to say anything,
I wasn't going to say anything,

372
00:27:43,964 --> 00:27:47,602
but, no, well, what could I say?
I never see you to talk to. You just go!

373
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,108
After every rehearsal,
after every fitting...

374
00:27:49,164 --> 00:27:50,767
- Elizabeth...
- No, just disappear

375
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:52,968
-back to your apartment.
- I have to work!

376
00:27:57,565 --> 00:27:59,406
This isn't how I planned it.

377
00:28:00,598 --> 00:28:01,836
I see.

378
00:28:05,264 --> 00:28:08,435
I just thought
we'd spend time with each other.

379
00:28:09,598 --> 00:28:12,337
I was looking forward to that.
Weren't you?

380
00:28:14,131 --> 00:28:17,234
That we'd get to see each other again

381
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:20,932
and have fun?

382
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:25,634
I don't know what to say.

383
00:28:26,598 --> 00:28:27,973
I don't.

384
00:28:31,431 --> 00:28:33,500
I don't know what to say.

385
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:39,132
You have a... You have a God-given gift.

386
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:41,641
You can do it anywhere,
on stage, on film...

387
00:28:41,732 --> 00:28:43,641
- What?
- I'm just a dumb broad.

388
00:28:43,732 --> 00:28:46,800
You're not dumb. Don't say that.

389
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:50,171
It's not true
and it makes me angry when you say it.

390
00:28:50,264 --> 00:28:53,572
Okay. I'm not dumb.

391
00:28:55,897 --> 00:28:57,569
But...

392
00:28:58,732 --> 00:29:01,300
The stage is not my home and I...

393
00:29:01,998 --> 00:29:03,271
I---

394
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:07,275
Well, this play is hard, really hard,

395
00:29:07,897 --> 00:29:10,966
and I'm isolated

396
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:16,342
and I thought you'd be there
to back me up.

397
00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:17,769
I am!

398
00:29:18,764 --> 00:29:22,641
Really, I am. That's why I'm here now.
To help.

399
00:29:23,598 --> 00:29:25,075
And I will.

400
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,068
Good.

401
00:29:29,998 --> 00:29:33,670
- I just didn't want to disappoint you.
- Disappoint me?

402
00:29:34,431 --> 00:29:35,737
Just learn your lines, love,

403
00:29:35,797 --> 00:29:38,674
go on stage, say them,
and you will electrify.

404
00:29:52,131 --> 00:29:55,439
And irrespective
of what happens here tonight,

405
00:29:55,498 --> 00:29:59,908
the entire run of this show
is already sold out,

406
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:05,840
guaranteeing both stars a pay day
somewhere in the region of $1 million!

407
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:08,239
...outside the Lunt-Fontanne
Theatre, massive crowds wait

408
00:30:08,298 --> 00:30:11,139
for a glimpse of Elizabeth Taylor
and Richard Burton.

409
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:12,675
...is the first time

410
00:30:12,764 --> 00:30:14,799
Taylor and Burton
have been on stage together...

411
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,136
Ladies and gentlemen,

412
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,004
welcome to this evening's performance
of Private Lives.

413
00:30:19,098 --> 00:30:20,905
We would like to take this time
to remind you

414
00:30:20,964 --> 00:30:24,431
that all photography of the performances
is strictly prohibited.

415
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:26,567
We hope you enjoy
this evening's performance.

416
00:30:26,631 --> 00:30:28,336
- We go up in 10 minutes.

417
00:30:28,431 --> 00:30:29,999
Where the bloody hell is she?

418
00:30:30,098 --> 00:30:32,133
- They're parking up.
- What?

419
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,607
People are parking
on the side of the road

420
00:30:34,664 --> 00:30:37,108
and in the middle of it,
hoping to get a glimpse as she goes by.

421
00:30:37,164 --> 00:30:39,835
-It's caused gridlock.
- Oh, Christ!

422
00:30:39,931 --> 00:30:41,637
Ladies and gentlemen...

423
00:30:41,731 --> 00:30:42,902
Mike!

424
00:30:44,098 --> 00:30:46,337
Will you fetch me the Times crossword,
please?

425
00:30:46,431 --> 00:30:47,568
And possibly get the kettle on.

426
00:30:47,631 --> 00:30:52,439
Oh, and a couple of sleeping bags also.
It's going to be a bloody long night.

427
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:55,300
Ladies and gentlemen,

428
00:30:55,398 --> 00:30:58,069
unfortunately, this evening's
performance of Private Lives

429
00:30:58,131 --> 00:31:00,040
is delayed for another 25 minutes.

430
00:31:02,264 --> 00:31:05,265
It is now 45 minutes
till act one beginners.

431
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:08,138
- 45 minutes till act one beginners.

432
00:31:08,198 --> 00:31:10,039
- Hi, Gino.
- Hi.

433
00:31:10,131 --> 00:31:13,631
I'm here, I'm here! I'm here!

434
00:31:13,964 --> 00:31:18,965
I'm so sorry I'm late. Here, here.
Here, Chen.

435
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:21,532
I'm so sorry. I'm so, so, sorry.

436
00:31:22,098 --> 00:31:25,474
I did my make up in the car.
I thought that might help.

437
00:31:25,531 --> 00:31:27,167
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

438
00:31:27,264 --> 00:31:29,299
In these situations,
we gotta all pull together.

439
00:31:29,365 --> 00:31:31,343
You're a bloody menace!

440
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:35,375
You should have come out.
Everyone was calling your name.

441
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:38,204
And I signed so many posters
for Virginia Woolf.

442
00:31:38,298 --> 00:31:41,639
- Virginia Woolf?
- I know. Fort hat. I was so fat.

443
00:31:41,697 --> 00:31:44,607
Anyway, can't talk. Got a play to do.

444
00:31:47,797 --> 00:31:50,968
- A parrot?
- He's called Alvin.

445
00:31:53,764 --> 00:31:56,538
What is she? An actress or a bloody zoo?

446
00:32:18,465 --> 00:32:20,136
Thank you, Jess.

447
00:32:31,098 --> 00:32:33,007
- Sibyl?
- Yes?

448
00:32:33,597 --> 00:32:36,269
I've brought the cocktails outside.
Hurry up.

449
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:38,172
I can't find my lipstick.

450
00:32:38,264 --> 00:32:41,140
Never mind. Send down
to the kitchen for some cochineal.

451
00:32:41,198 --> 00:32:42,937
- Don't be silly.

452
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:44,600
Hurry!

453
00:33:34,497 --> 00:33:36,339
Whose yacht is that?

454
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,601
The Duke of Westminster's, I expect.
It always is.

455
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:41,972
- I wish I were on it.
- I wish you were, too.

456
00:33:45,365 --> 00:33:50,468
There's no need to be nasty.

457
00:33:51,098 --> 00:33:52,632
Yes, there is, every need.

458
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,437
I've never in my life felt
a greater urge to be nasty.

459
00:33:57,331 --> 00:34:00,797
And you've had some urges in your time,
haven't you?

460
00:34:02,797 --> 00:34:07,037
If you start bickering with me, Amanda,
I swear I shall throw you over the edge.

461
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:09,040
Try it, that's all, just try it.

462
00:34:13,831 --> 00:34:16,036
It's intermission,
ladies and gentlemen.

463
00:34:16,131 --> 00:34:18,665
20 minutes till act two beginners.

464
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,336
What a start, Rich.

465
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:28,533
I set 'em up, you knock 'em down!

466
00:34:31,664 --> 00:34:33,142
Did you notice her at supper

467
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:35,539
blowing all those shrimps
through her ear trumpet?

468
00:34:46,797 --> 00:34:49,002
What are you thinking about?

469
00:34:49,365 --> 00:34:51,968
Oh, nothing in particular.

470
00:34:52,464 --> 00:34:54,635
Come on, I know that face.

471
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,374
Poor Sibyl.

472
00:35:05,497 --> 00:35:06,804
Sibyl?>

473
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:13,134
Yes, I suppose she loves you terribly.

474
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:33,103
Oh, my God. What have we done?

475
00:35:35,497 --> 00:35:38,101
- Rich, listen.
-Didn't you hear them?

476
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:42,806
When Sibyl was mentioned.
They reacted like it was my wife Sybil.

477
00:35:44,364 --> 00:35:46,968
Richard Burton! We did it. You did it!

478
00:35:47,031 --> 00:35:50,134
A standing ovation,
five, six, curtain calls.

479
00:35:50,597 --> 00:35:54,700
I knew this play would be a hit.
I knew it right from the off!

480
00:35:54,797 --> 00:35:57,502
- What's the matter?
- Couldn't you hear it?

481
00:35:57,597 --> 00:35:59,666
Richard, I heard laughter
and I heard cheering.

482
00:35:59,764 --> 00:36:02,503
- That's usually a good sign, isn't it?
- They were laughing at us.

483
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:04,939
- No, they were not.
- They were!

484
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,641
They didn't think
they were watching a play.

485
00:36:07,697 --> 00:36:09,606
They thought they'd had
an invite into our lives,

486
00:36:09,664 --> 00:36:12,268
to see us happen in front of them.

487
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:15,798
Stop it! You're overreacting.

488
00:36:15,864 --> 00:36:19,330
Well, okay, maybe there were a few
that were more interested in us

489
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,965
than in the show, but you always
get that on the first night crowd.

490
00:36:22,031 --> 00:36:25,839
You get the rubberneckers.
But they were not the majority.

491
00:36:25,931 --> 00:36:29,431
And the majority loved what we did,
they loved it!

492
00:36:29,497 --> 00:36:31,497
Mike to stage door, please.

493
00:36:31,597 --> 00:36:33,939
And I'm proud of you, Elizabeth.

494
00:36:35,264 --> 00:36:37,003
You're phenomenal.

495
00:36:37,931 --> 00:36:39,966
There's no one like you.

496
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,775
Thank you.

497
00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:45,297
So stop worrying. Okay?
And let's go wow.

498
00:36:47,697 --> 00:36:52,334
The party. We've got a club in town.
The whole place. And a band.

499
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:58,540
I'm sorry. I've made arrangements.
Later, perhaps, I could...

500
00:36:59,164 --> 00:37:02,767
But people will be expecting it. Us.

501
00:37:04,998 --> 00:37:08,806
Rich, Sally's brought the car around.
Are you going to be long?

502
00:37:08,864 --> 00:37:12,672
- Or do you want me to ask her back?
- No, no. I'm coming. Thank you.

503
00:37:14,297 --> 00:37:16,275
No, it's fine. It's fine.

504
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:19,273
I forgot.

505
00:37:20,131 --> 00:37:22,200
You do what you gotta do.

506
00:37:23,797 --> 00:37:25,274
I'll see you.

507
00:37:30,131 --> 00:37:31,608
Hello, love.

508
00:37:31,864 --> 00:37:33,206
Chen?

509
00:37:42,497 --> 00:37:44,600
We've got a table booked.

510
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,134
Thou art a soul in bliss,

511
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:55,002
but I am bound upon a wheel of fire

512
00:38:59,497 --> 00:39:03,339
that mine own tears
do scald like molten lead.

513
00:39:13,364 --> 00:39:15,104
You loathsome,

514
00:39:17,364 --> 00:39:19,433
loathsome man.

515
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:51,268
They're not the best I've read.

516
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,774
Ah!

517
00:39:52,831 --> 00:39:56,536
Elizabeth, please.
Critics deserve nothing but our pity.

518
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,767
To be so close to art

519
00:39:57,831 --> 00:40:01,172
and yet to contribute absolutely
nothing whatsoever towards it.

520
00:40:01,263 --> 00:40:03,935
It's like being a eunuch at an orgy.

521
00:40:04,464 --> 00:40:06,305
Yeah, but how can they say those things?

522
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:08,001
They're cunts.

523
00:40:08,664 --> 00:40:10,938
That's a more prosaic version
of what I just said.

524
00:40:12,797 --> 00:40:15,138
Christ, Elizabeth!
You don't need their approbation.

525
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:18,869
- Approbation!
- No, don't... Don't do it to yourself.

526
00:40:18,964 --> 00:40:21,805
No, no, no. Listen to this.

527
00:40:22,664 --> 00:40:25,642
"Miss Taylor plays Amanda Prynne

528
00:40:25,697 --> 00:40:29,835
"in perhaps the strangest voice
this side of a Disney cartoon.

529
00:40:29,931 --> 00:40:35,170
"She squeaks, peeps, swoops and then
pauses as though speaking Pinter."

530
00:40:35,797 --> 00:40:38,468
Approbation?
I just want their fucking manners.

531
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,999
Do you have a handkerchief?

532
00:40:50,664 --> 00:40:51,801
Here.

533
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,997
- I don't deserve that.
- You don't. You're right.

534
00:40:56,097 --> 00:40:59,008
Let's not forget, they weren't exactly
gushing about me, were they?

535
00:40:59,097 --> 00:41:01,701
- Yeah, well, they all like your voice.
- Of course they do.

536
00:41:01,797 --> 00:41:05,434
It's the theatrical equivalent
of a big cock.

537
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:08,134
Everyone likes it. Doesn't make you
a great lover per se, though, does it?

538
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:14,039
- Here, have some of my burger.
- No, I'm on a diet.

539
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,369
Two of those bastards said

540
00:41:15,464 --> 00:41:17,874
I was spending more time
in the green room than on stage.

541
00:41:17,964 --> 00:41:19,202
Sod them!

542
00:41:19,998 --> 00:41:21,998
None of their business.

543
00:41:23,497 --> 00:41:26,441
But you're right.
You shouldn't have to endure it.

544
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:28,270
And nor should I.

545
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:35,101
- Nor do we have to.
- What do you mean?

546
00:41:35,464 --> 00:41:40,340
Let's cancel the run. Right here. Now.
Spare ourselves any more pain.

547
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,998
Either from these idiots,
or from the ones who plonk themselves

548
00:41:43,097 --> 00:41:47,041
down on the front row
and treat us like a bloody freak show.

549
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:51,199
But we can't just cancel.
The theater'd sue us.

550
00:41:51,297 --> 00:41:53,206
Why don't we pay them?

551
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,631
I think I've got enough in
my current account. What about you?

552
00:41:56,697 --> 00:41:59,607
Wouldn't entirely clear us out,
would it?

553
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:01,266
We pop in later today,

554
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,831
we bid a fond farewell
to the other actors and that's it.

555
00:42:03,931 --> 00:42:06,999
We go our separate ways.
Sounds like bliss.

556
00:42:09,864 --> 00:42:15,638
No, I won't give them the pleasure.
Richard, we're gonna do this play.

557
00:42:15,697 --> 00:42:19,970
And we're gonna make people laugh,
we're gonna make people applaud.

558
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:23,133
And we're gonna make
a pile of money while we do it.

559
00:42:23,197 --> 00:42:28,369
And no one, not them or anyone else,
is gonna stand in our way.

560
00:42:41,797 --> 00:42:43,331
- Sibyl!
- Yes?

561
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,465
I've brought the cocktails
outside, hurry up.

562
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,098
Considering what
a hell she made your life,

563
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:48,698
I think you're very nice about her.

564
00:42:48,797 --> 00:42:51,365
- And yet I'm sorry for her.
- Why?

565
00:42:51,464 --> 00:42:53,533
Because she's marked for tragedy.

566
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,665
She's bound to make
a mess of everything.

567
00:42:55,764 --> 00:42:58,833
If it's all her fault,
I don't see that it matters much.

568
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:04,202
You're a vile, loose-living
wicked little beast

569
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:06,002
and I never want to set eyes on you.

570
00:43:06,097 --> 00:43:08,371
This is the end.
Do you understand?

571
00:43:08,464 --> 00:43:10,373
Finally! And forever!

572
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:12,271
- You're not going like this.
- Yes, lam.

573
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,171
- You're not!
- Oh, yes, I am, let go of me!

574
00:43:48,697 --> 00:43:52,436
Very enjoyable.
Never had much of that, anyhow.

575
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:54,372
Quite insufferable.

576
00:43:54,464 --> 00:43:57,032
I expect it's because you're drunk!

577
00:43:58,263 --> 00:44:01,639
- Keep going, you two!
- We love you, Liz!

578
00:44:09,831 --> 00:44:12,331
- What the hell was that?
- What?

579
00:44:13,297 --> 00:44:15,798
You were mugging for the audience.

580
00:44:16,097 --> 00:44:17,700
-L?
- You were. I saw you.

581
00:44:17,797 --> 00:44:21,934
- Oh, Elizabeth, costume...
- Shut your mouth! I'm talking to her.

582
00:44:22,097 --> 00:44:25,166
Don't you dare speak
to my friends like that!

583
00:44:25,597 --> 00:44:29,836
And don't you dare think that
you can tell me how to play my role.

584
00:44:30,764 --> 00:44:33,298
They loved it. The audience loved it.

585
00:44:33,364 --> 00:44:35,035
They adored that
they were in on the gag.

586
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:39,597
And the audience, may I remind you,
are the ones who are paying our wages.

587
00:44:39,664 --> 00:44:44,438
Or rather, they're paying my company,
who are paying your wages.

588
00:44:44,497 --> 00:44:45,838
Fuck off!

589
00:44:51,197 --> 00:44:53,197
- Richard. Rich!
- What?

590
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,868
Please.

591
00:44:57,464 --> 00:45:01,135
Don't storm off like that.
Don't go off like that.

592
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,806
- When you still haven't apologized!
- Bitch!

593
00:45:05,863 --> 00:45:08,603
- You bully! How dare you!
- Get off. Stop it!

594
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,937
- Don't you raise your hand to me!
- Well, stop fucking hitting me!

595
00:45:10,997 --> 00:45:13,373
Only when you've fucking apologized!

596
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:19,172
- We're fine.
- We're just talking.

597
00:45:31,464 --> 00:45:32,839
I'm sorry.

598
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:37,365
You're right. I was unprofessional.

599
00:45:37,464 --> 00:45:39,169
It's all we have!

600
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:43,205
To rise above the rubbish in the stalls.

601
00:45:43,297 --> 00:45:47,207
Richard, I was unprofessional,
you were rude. Which is much worse.

602
00:45:48,197 --> 00:45:51,505
We do not treat those around us,
those who look after us, like dirt.

603
00:45:51,597 --> 00:45:54,200
That is inexcusable. And you know it!

604
00:45:54,796 --> 00:45:58,968
So, please, do the right thing now.
Now!

605
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:04,534
Or I am going to spend
the entire final act of this play

606
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:07,164
in full conversation
with whoever in the front row

607
00:46:07,263 --> 00:46:09,366
wants to join in with me the most.

608
00:46:17,597 --> 00:46:19,040
- 400s BARKS)

609
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:20,472
Chen? I...

610
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:26,473
I'm so sorry about that outburst.
My tone, I don't know what came over me.

611
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,474
It's fine, Rich.

612
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:33,769
Well, it won't happen again,
I can assure you. Sorry.

613
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,502
Thank you.

614
00:46:43,097 --> 00:46:44,473
Thank you.

615
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:52,006
Would you like some supper afterwards?

616
00:46:52,297 --> 00:46:53,536
What?

617
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,335
I was wondering
if you'd care for a late supper.

618
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,135
What about Sally?

619
00:46:59,163 --> 00:47:02,766
- Is she not in tonight? She usually is.
- No. She's busy.

620
00:47:03,263 --> 00:47:05,706
- I think she might have gone to the Met.
- So's Victor.

621
00:47:05,796 --> 00:47:08,672
- Gone to the opera?
- No. He's busy.

622
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:11,697
Oh, well, all the more reason, then.

623
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,304
Ideal.

624
00:47:15,364 --> 00:47:16,535
Okay.

625
00:47:35,663 --> 00:47:37,039
Thank you.

626
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:42,406
Thank you.

627
00:47:51,197 --> 00:47:53,970
- So sorry I'm late.
- You're not.

628
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:58,304
Miss Taylor, Mr. Burton,
compliments of the management.

629
00:47:58,397 --> 00:47:59,999
Oh, how lovely.

630
00:48:01,997 --> 00:48:03,407
Thank you.

631
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:09,331
Can I get a Tab as well, please?
And some iced water?

632
00:48:09,397 --> 00:48:10,965
- Of course, sir.
- Thank you.

633
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,406
Thank you.

634
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:24,206
Thank you.

635
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:31,171
-- Menu, ma'am.

636
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:34,037
This is lovely. Very intimate.

637
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:36,130
- Menu, sir.
- Thank you.

638
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:39,640
I got a round of applause
when I came in.

639
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:42,540
I notice you didn't.

640
00:48:48,063 --> 00:48:50,007
- What?
- Bizarre.

641
00:48:50,663 --> 00:48:53,369
I mean, all these years,
they're still interested.

642
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:55,839
You'd think they'd tire, but...

643
00:48:59,364 --> 00:49:02,864
Are you gonna be like this all night?
Just drifting off?

644
00:49:02,963 --> 00:49:06,373
No, I was just thinking
of that restaurant in Rome.

645
00:49:06,464 --> 00:49:08,533
- Alfredo's?
- Mmm-hmm?

646
00:49:09,497 --> 00:49:14,407
Remember at the height of Le Scandale,
we were holed up in that little flat,

647
00:49:15,397 --> 00:49:17,874
half the world's press on our doorstep,
cameras everywhere

648
00:49:17,963 --> 00:49:21,373
and the Vatican telling us
we were morally reprehensible.

649
00:49:21,464 --> 00:49:23,737
-- Then one day, you said,

650
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:26,468
"Sod it, let's go and have
some fettuccini at Alfredo's!"

651
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,007
Sure did.

652
00:49:30,663 --> 00:49:34,698
We went down the Via Veneto
and into the restaurant, and bang!

653
00:49:35,963 --> 00:49:37,872
Boy, did we go public!

654
00:49:39,997 --> 00:49:41,373
Remember?

655
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,140
Every day.

656
00:49:48,596 --> 00:49:51,200
I think we're ready to order, please.

657
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:55,308
I like this.

658
00:49:56,497 --> 00:49:57,667
What?

659
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:00,765
I can be quiet with you.

660
00:50:01,197 --> 00:50:03,800
You can't with Victor?

661
00:50:03,863 --> 00:50:08,103
Sure I can. I'm saying, though,
it's also true of you.

662
00:50:08,163 --> 00:50:11,164
Geez, can't a guy
take a compliment anymore?

663
00:50:13,997 --> 00:50:16,702
Feeling's mutual, love, I promise.

664
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,634
Ma'am.

665
00:50:23,629 --> 00:50:24,800
Sir.

666
00:50:26,997 --> 00:50:28,373
It's funny, isn't it?

667
00:50:28,464 --> 00:50:31,600
What's at the heart
of a good relationship.

668
00:50:31,663 --> 00:50:34,437
I mean, love, obviously,
but that's a catch-all, really.

669
00:50:34,496 --> 00:50:37,838
A sort of collective noun
for all the other bits put together.

670
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,635
The question is,

671
00:50:40,097 --> 00:50:44,303
what's the critical element
around which everything else clusters?

672
00:50:44,364 --> 00:50:45,534
Mmm.

673
00:50:46,596 --> 00:50:49,972
- Er, passion?
- Maybe.

674
00:50:51,097 --> 00:50:54,506
- Sex.
- Hmm. Important.

675
00:50:55,297 --> 00:50:56,467
Very.

676
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,135
Trust.

677
00:51:00,696 --> 00:51:02,299
That's not bad.

678
00:51:03,297 --> 00:51:06,968
Being able to trust
name's most abject self to the other,

679
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:11,471
in the knowledge that
they'll tread carefully on your screams.

680
00:51:16,629 --> 00:51:18,607
I always did feel like that with you.

681
00:51:18,663 --> 00:51:19,970
Really?

682
00:51:20,596 --> 00:51:22,835
That's what bound us? Trust?

683
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:26,439
I always thought it was my tits.

684
00:51:27,863 --> 00:51:31,466
Yes, well, they clearly had a role.

685
00:51:33,963 --> 00:51:36,941
And they are still magnificent,
by the way.

686
00:51:37,997 --> 00:51:39,838
- May I say that?
'No. you may not!

687
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,306
They're not yours
to talk about anymore.

688
00:51:42,364 --> 00:51:44,364
They'll always be mine.

689
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:52,706
So are we gonna have pudding
or go straight for coffee?

690
00:51:52,796 --> 00:51:55,274
Richard, listen, listen, listen, listen.

691
00:51:55,596 --> 00:51:59,699
I wanna say some things.
I've wanted to say them for a while.

692
00:52:00,529 --> 00:52:02,473
I nearly did at Rock's,

693
00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:04,269
but I don't know,
you seemed kind of frail.

694
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:08,331
I am kind of frail. I mean, it's a...
It's a worry.

695
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:10,771
I mean, it's the thing
that concerns me about Lear.

696
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,035
I'll be fine with the words
but it's the physical demands...

697
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,869
I'm not talking about acting, Richard.

698
00:52:14,963 --> 00:52:18,600
I'm talking about you and me
and why we're doing this.

699
00:52:20,463 --> 00:52:23,930
-$70,000 a week.
-That is not true.

700
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:26,769
Elizabeth, please.

701
00:52:31,097 --> 00:52:34,472
Can I say something,
now that it's on my mind?

702
00:52:36,097 --> 00:52:40,837
There's a couple of things which have
crept in over the course of the run.

703
00:52:41,297 --> 00:52:45,763
They're tiny things,
but your first entrance, for instance.

704
00:52:46,297 --> 00:52:50,002
You're now playing it very confidently,
which I think is

705
00:52:50,596 --> 00:52:53,268
losing some sense of
Amanda protecting herself,

706
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:56,705
-which she undoubtedly is.
- You're giving me notes?

707
00:52:58,329 --> 00:53:02,001
I'm trying to talk to you
and you're giving me acting notes?

708
00:53:02,097 --> 00:53:04,836
- No...
- Jesus, Richard! What are you doing?

709
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:06,930
- Why did you ask me out tonight?
- What?

710
00:53:06,997 --> 00:53:08,474
Why did you ask me out
to supper tonight?

711
00:53:08,529 --> 00:53:10,438
Why did you do that?

712
00:53:10,496 --> 00:53:12,770
Because I wanted to see you.

713
00:53:13,596 --> 00:53:14,767
You're my ex-wife.

714
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,774
It's perfectly natural for me
to want to see you, isn't it?

715
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:19,603
Fine, in which case,
I'll take that note.

716
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:23,104
Where did my Antony go, remember?

717
00:53:23,163 --> 00:53:25,198
The man who would've risked
everything for me.

718
00:53:25,296 --> 00:53:29,207
Who did! He tossed it all against
the rocks so he could be with me.

719
00:53:29,296 --> 00:53:33,900
Where did he go, Richard?
Tell me where my fucking Antony went!

720
00:53:43,063 --> 00:53:44,438
Thank you.

721
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:04,339
- There's still no sign.
- We need to start.

722
00:54:04,396 --> 00:54:05,840
Or we'll still be here at midnight.

723
00:54:05,896 --> 00:54:10,931
- Rich, we can't be certain.
- She isn't coming. I know she isn't.

724
00:54:12,197 --> 00:54:13,936
Go get ready, love.

725
00:54:17,529 --> 00:54:19,700
You'll be wonderful. Trust me.

726
00:54:25,163 --> 00:54:28,231
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a sudden illness,

727
00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:30,830
Miss Taylor is sadly indisposed

728
00:54:30,896 --> 00:54:34,999
and the role of Amanda will be
played tonight by Kathryn Walker.

729
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,398
Five minutes' standby
for Mr. Burton.

730
00:55:01,496 --> 00:55:03,565
Mr. Burton, please standby.

731
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:09,364
- How's it going?
- How do you think?

732
00:55:10,429 --> 00:55:14,430
I'm Richard Burton.
I don't play to 50 people!

733
00:55:14,529 --> 00:55:20,667
Christ, Mike, don't ever put
that woman's back up. Not ever!

734
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:23,833
- What did you say to her?
- I gave her a note.

735
00:55:24,997 --> 00:55:27,032
And this is hers, back to me.

736
00:55:27,097 --> 00:55:30,836
This is La Taylor saying,
loud and clear,

737
00:55:30,896 --> 00:55:34,863
"Don't you forget, boyo,
who the star of this show really is!"

738
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,236
Bitch!

739
00:56:15,496 --> 00:56:17,201
-- Yes?

740
00:56:18,496 --> 00:56:22,338
It was a great show, Rich.
You and Kathryn, you really...

741
00:56:22,396 --> 00:56:24,169
What's the matter?

742
00:56:25,863 --> 00:56:29,432
We're gonna go dark.
Just until Elizabeth gets better.

743
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:31,764
What?

744
00:56:31,863 --> 00:56:34,170
I've spoken to Zev and the numbers,

745
00:56:34,229 --> 00:56:37,400
tickets coming back
and phone calls, I...

746
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:45,604
People really wanna see Liz, Rich,
so it seems crazy.

747
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:48,265
We're gonna take a break.

748
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:51,534
As soon as she's well again,
we'll pick it up.

749
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:24,098
Okay, folks, please strike this
and reset for act one.

750
00:57:24,196 --> 00:57:26,231
We are back on the road.

751
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:36,831
Todd, can you get on
to resetting the doors?

752
00:57:38,396 --> 00:57:41,067
- I'm here, I'm here. Hi, Gino.
- Elizabeth.

753
00:57:44,863 --> 00:57:49,068
Hi, babies. You go with Auntie Hayley.

754
00:57:49,162 --> 00:57:52,004
Hay, can you see,
I'm going to see Uncle Rich.

755
00:57:52,062 --> 00:57:54,506
Hi, honey, I'm sorry I'm late.

756
00:57:55,062 --> 00:57:56,734
Elizabeth?

757
00:57:58,096 --> 00:57:59,403
What?

758
00:58:00,162 --> 00:58:04,197
Elizabeth, apologies,
I didn't realize you were already in.

759
00:58:07,896 --> 00:58:10,066
- What is happening?
- Nothing.

760
00:58:10,162 --> 00:58:15,505
I... Richard's on his way,
Mike called from the airport.

761
00:58:15,563 --> 00:58:17,905
Airport? Where's he been?

762
00:58:23,196 --> 00:58:26,697
Can someone please tell me
what the goddamn hell is going on?

763
00:58:26,763 --> 00:58:31,537
Honey, let's go to your room, huh?
We can talk better there. Come on.

764
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:45,774
- It's okay, come on.

765
00:58:47,029 --> 00:58:51,371
Can you guys give us some space, please?
Peter, take the dogs out.

766
00:58:51,429 --> 00:58:53,270
- Thank you.
- No problem.

767
00:58:54,262 --> 00:58:57,934
- Come on. Come on. We'll be outside.
- Just... Thank you.

768
00:58:58,996 --> 00:59:00,167
Well?

769
00:59:07,496 --> 00:59:12,167
Guess they got an exclusive.
It wasn't in any of the others, so...

770
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,867
He got married in Vegas?

771
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:29,005
Why would he do that?

772
00:59:53,563 --> 00:59:54,734
Yeah?

773
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:01,536
Richard.

774
01:00:03,363 --> 01:00:05,272
I wondered how you were feeling.

775
01:00:06,596 --> 01:00:09,437
I'm on the mend, thank you.

776
01:00:12,596 --> 01:00:18,438
I do wish you'd told me of your plans.

777
01:00:19,196 --> 01:00:22,868
I was a little surprised
to read of them in the newspaper.

778
01:00:22,929 --> 01:00:24,430
I'm sorry.

779
01:00:26,529 --> 01:00:29,063
Events rather overtook us.

780
01:00:30,262 --> 01:00:31,535
Really?

781
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:36,203
We'd always intended it, you know that.

782
01:00:37,229 --> 01:00:40,764
And then the break.
Seemed like an ideal opportunity.

783
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:44,605
I've no doubt it was.

784
01:00:48,862 --> 01:00:50,238
Congratulations.

785
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:52,731
Isn't that what you say
a performance must always have?

786
01:01:52,795 --> 01:01:54,273
Some danger?

787
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:56,296
Not parrots.

788
01:01:59,229 --> 01:02:02,435
You really can be more irritating
than anyone in the world.

789
01:02:04,563 --> 01:02:09,735
Hmm. I fail to see what I've done
that is so terribly irritating.

790
01:02:17,862 --> 01:02:23,102
- They want us to fight. Don't you see?
- No, I don't, why should they?

791
01:02:23,196 --> 01:02:26,140
Primitive feminine instinct.
It's what...

792
01:02:28,062 --> 01:02:31,404
Warring females, very enjoyable.

793
01:02:31,463 --> 01:02:35,202
The end. Finally and forever.

794
01:02:35,262 --> 01:02:37,297
- You're not going like this!
- Yes, I am!

795
01:02:37,396 --> 01:02:39,465
- You're not!
- Oh yes, I am, let go of me!

796
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:46,435
You're a cruel fiend.
I hate you and I loathe you.

797
01:03:01,596 --> 01:03:03,937
- Great work, Rich.
- Wonderful.

798
01:03:16,895 --> 01:03:19,635
I hope I didn't hurt you, did I, Rich?

799
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:23,130
At the end of act two?
You seemed to wince.

800
01:03:23,795 --> 01:03:25,569
Only on Noél's behalf.

801
01:03:26,563 --> 01:03:30,870
You're slurred again.
You swallowed half the lines.

802
01:03:56,895 --> 01:04:00,601
Christ! What a bloody shambles.

803
01:04:20,862 --> 01:04:23,101
- it's okay.
- What's going on?

804
01:04:25,096 --> 01:04:28,438
- Elizabeth!
- Leave her! She's poorly.

805
01:04:28,529 --> 01:04:31,870
We're getting her
straight back to the apartment.

806
01:04:32,396 --> 01:04:35,033
- There's nothing wrong with her!
- She's sick.

807
01:04:35,096 --> 01:04:38,233
Really? Well, if she is,
take it from one who knows,

808
01:04:38,296 --> 01:04:40,240
she's got it from a bloody bottle!

809
01:04:40,296 --> 01:04:43,399
Can you blame her?
You treat her like shit.

810
01:04:43,929 --> 01:04:47,032
She finds out you're married
from a newspaper article.

811
01:04:47,096 --> 01:04:48,869
You criticize her as an actress.

812
01:04:48,929 --> 01:04:49,963
- What?
- You!

813
01:04:50,062 --> 01:04:52,040
I have never criticized her
as an actress!

814
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:55,869
She is peerless as an actress. Jesus!

815
01:04:57,096 --> 01:04:59,438
You call that acting, out there?

816
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:02,538
It's like a bloody pantomime dame
tripping over all her lines.

817
01:05:02,595 --> 01:05:05,801
I know she can act.
I know better than anyone!

818
01:05:05,895 --> 01:05:08,396
Which is why I'm not gonna
tolerate that anymore!

819
01:05:08,463 --> 01:05:11,566
In which case, maybe you'll
leave her alone once and for all.

820
01:05:11,628 --> 01:05:14,697
Because Miss Taylor was fine
until you took this job.

821
01:05:14,762 --> 01:05:18,070
She was well until you decided
to come back into her life again.

822
01:05:18,129 --> 01:05:21,403
Now, why you did that,
only you can know for sure,

823
01:05:21,463 --> 01:05:25,066
but from here, it looks like
it was for one reason only.

824
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:27,073
To break her heart.

825
01:05:38,229 --> 01:05:40,298
What did he say?

826
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:43,566
Did he ask if I was all right?

827
01:05:43,628 --> 01:05:46,902
He didn't say much.
But I told him.

828
01:05:47,762 --> 01:05:50,797
I think it's disgusting
the way he treats you.

829
01:05:53,895 --> 01:05:55,464
You said what?

830
01:06:02,196 --> 01:06:03,469
Get out.

831
01:06:05,129 --> 01:06:08,107
Get out. I said get out!

832
01:06:08,196 --> 01:06:10,799
Get out! Get the fuck out of here!

833
01:06:35,062 --> 01:06:38,438
Chen! Chen!

834
01:06:41,862 --> 01:06:43,204
Chen!

835
01:07:17,795 --> 01:07:19,739
You okay, Mr. Burton?

836
01:08:16,096 --> 01:08:18,972
Never, never.

837
01:08:39,129 --> 01:08:41,266
Thou art the thing itself.

838
01:08:42,895 --> 01:08:47,430
Unaccommodated man is no more

839
01:08:47,528 --> 01:08:52,768
but such a poor, bare, forked animal

840
01:08:55,962 --> 01:08:57,439
as thou art.

841
01:10:06,528 --> 01:10:08,699
Ah! Congratulations.

842
01:10:11,729 --> 01:10:14,639
- Hey! Great work, Rich!
- Thanks, Jess.

843
01:10:17,395 --> 01:10:22,362
- You were terrific, thank you.
- Thanks, John. Likewise, likewise.

844
01:10:24,096 --> 01:10:27,233
Rich! Thank you, thank you, thank you.

845
01:10:27,528 --> 01:10:31,472
- For what?
-I finally got to act with my hero.

846
01:10:31,562 --> 01:10:34,631
And he was everything I dreamed of,
and more.

847
01:10:34,729 --> 01:10:37,570
You were brilliant. Really.

848
01:10:39,229 --> 01:10:41,138
See you at the party?

849
01:10:41,462 --> 01:10:42,735
Uh, well, we'll see.

850
01:11:11,196 --> 01:11:12,605
Well done.

851
01:11:13,228 --> 01:11:16,105
Yes. And you.

852
01:11:21,295 --> 01:11:23,773
- There's a party I...
- I know. Kathryn said.

853
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:28,465
- Yeah, I imagine you'll...
- No. I don't know. I might call in.

854
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:41,539
You're quite an actor.

855
01:11:48,562 --> 01:11:50,972
- Elizabeth.
- What?

856
01:11:52,096 --> 01:11:55,562
I... I will, I'll try and come
to the party.

857
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:15,539
Ladies and gentlemen, for the last time,

858
01:12:15,595 --> 01:12:19,130
Act One was 43 minutes,
Act Two, 44 minutes

859
01:12:19,228 --> 01:12:21,433
and Act Three, 46 minutes.

860
01:12:22,462 --> 01:12:27,202
There will be no call on Monday.
Thank you and good night.

861
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:12,073
There you go.

862
01:13:13,428 --> 01:13:14,770
- Thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

863
01:13:14,862 --> 01:13:19,068
- You really shouldn't do that, you know.
- Richard, I bought you a present.

864
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:20,936
I wanna hang it up.

865
01:13:22,195 --> 01:13:23,537
Yes, the thing about hotels, love,

866
01:13:23,595 --> 01:13:26,039
is that they come with the pictures
already provided.

867
01:13:26,095 --> 01:13:28,767
Yeah, copies. Not originals.

868
01:13:28,862 --> 01:13:32,465
This one had its own seat in first
all the way from Madrid.

869
01:13:35,795 --> 01:13:39,933
- What are you wearing?
- Dior. Don't you like it?

870
01:13:40,029 --> 01:13:42,973
No. I mean, why are you dressed,
as it were, like an overripe tart,

871
01:13:43,062 --> 01:13:45,403
when we're about to start exercising?

872
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:48,201
I thought maybe
we could screw afterwards.

873
01:13:49,729 --> 01:13:53,138
Mmm! I can taste Jack. Lucky Jack.

874
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:56,866
Right, Francis, you old bugger.
Get us going.

875
01:14:01,362 --> 01:14:03,806
Elizabeth. Elizabeth, come on.

876
01:14:06,061 --> 01:14:07,403
♪ I get no kick from champagne

877
01:14:07,462 --> 01:14:09,940
Right, start with side bends. Ready?

878
01:14:11,795 --> 01:14:14,466
♪ Mere alcohol,
it doesn't move me at all ♪

879
01:14:14,562 --> 01:14:21,030
Ready and one, two, three

880
01:14:21,428 --> 01:14:28,100
and one, two, three and one, two, three.

881
01:14:30,462 --> 01:14:32,201
We're supposed to do 100 of those.

882
01:14:32,261 --> 01:14:35,034
- What?
- Well, I imagine you work up.

883
01:14:35,095 --> 01:14:37,733
We don't have to break any records
at the outset.

884
01:14:37,795 --> 01:14:41,068
Right, next,
jog on the spot for five minutes.

885
01:14:41,128 --> 01:14:42,606
Without stopping?

886
01:14:42,695 --> 01:14:43,968
No, love, after 30 seconds,

887
01:14:44,061 --> 01:14:45,630
they encourage you to have
another Jack Daniels

888
01:14:45,729 --> 01:14:47,968
and ring room service
for another hot dog.

889
01:14:48,061 --> 01:14:50,061
Of course you don't stop.

890
01:14:50,128 --> 01:14:52,436
Are you ready? Okay.

891
01:14:55,195 --> 01:14:56,605
Knees up.

892
01:14:58,095 --> 01:15:00,937
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

893
01:15:01,028 --> 01:15:02,734
What are you doing?

894
01:15:02,795 --> 01:15:07,239
Richard, I'm holding my bosom.
It's bouncing up and down.

895
01:15:08,028 --> 01:15:11,939
Richard, I'm 40 years of age.
They're 40 years of age.

896
01:15:12,028 --> 01:15:15,234
They've gained a certain elasticity.

897
01:15:22,628 --> 01:15:24,731
You are so gorgeous.

898
01:15:25,195 --> 01:15:30,037
Your tits are gorgeous, your arse
is gorgeous, your legs, your belly.

899
01:15:30,762 --> 01:15:32,865
Did I mention your tits?

900
01:15:33,895 --> 01:15:35,634
Let's just screw.

901
01:15:36,628 --> 01:15:38,765
We can be extra-vigorous.

902
01:15:47,428 --> 01:15:49,030
Rich?

903
01:15:50,428 --> 01:15:52,064
- Stop the car, will you?
- What?

904
01:15:52,128 --> 01:15:55,299
- Stop the car. Stop the car!
- What's the matter?

905
01:15:56,061 --> 01:15:59,267
I'm... I'm gonna walk. I need some air.

906
01:16:00,028 --> 01:16:02,370
I'll see you at the apartment.

907
01:16:03,795 --> 01:16:05,773
Tell Sally, will you?

908
01:17:28,295 --> 01:17:30,364
Now there's a surprise.

909
01:17:32,695 --> 01:17:34,468
I went to the party.

910
01:17:35,861 --> 01:17:38,203
Chen said you hadn't shown up, so...

911
01:17:39,729 --> 01:17:44,605
No, I'm... I'm glad you came back.

912
01:17:46,562 --> 01:17:49,369
The way it's all ended, it...

913
01:17:56,729 --> 01:17:58,764
Not how you planned it?

914
01:18:02,562 --> 01:18:05,768
- No one made you do it.
- No, you're right.

915
01:18:07,362 --> 01:18:08,772
I chose to.

916
01:18:17,729 --> 01:18:19,764
You need help, Elizabeth.
You know that, don't you?

917
01:18:23,894 --> 01:18:25,201
Yes.

918
01:18:30,894 --> 01:18:32,236
I say that as someone who...

919
01:18:32,295 --> 01:18:36,137
No, I know, you've got your help.
I understand, and I'm happy for you.

920
01:18:36,228 --> 01:18:38,069
No, I am. Really.

921
01:18:40,894 --> 01:18:43,771
- I'm sure Victor would...
- Oh, we'll see.

922
01:18:45,961 --> 01:18:47,870
I love you, Richard.

923
01:18:49,628 --> 01:18:51,264
I always will.

924
01:19:06,095 --> 01:19:08,971
- You want me to say it, don't you?
- Yes, please.

925
01:19:09,061 --> 01:19:11,061
Of course I love you.

926
01:19:15,195 --> 01:19:19,333
Don't say any more.
I just wanna hear the first bit, okay?

927
01:19:35,328 --> 01:19:38,771
We're addicts, Elizabeth, you and I.

928
01:19:39,228 --> 01:19:40,535
What?

929
01:19:41,761 --> 01:19:45,501
It's what King Leafs all about,
that's why I wanna do it so much.

930
01:19:45,562 --> 01:19:50,563
About the need we all have
for drugs of one kind or another.

931
01:19:51,528 --> 01:19:53,665
Without which we'd crumble.

932
01:19:54,261 --> 01:19:55,738
What drugs?

933
01:19:55,828 --> 01:19:59,398
Kingship, power, love...

934
01:19:59,495 --> 01:20:01,995
- Love is not a drug.
-Isn't it?

935
01:20:03,694 --> 01:20:05,195
I don't know,

936
01:20:06,995 --> 01:20:09,098
but you can have too much.

937
01:20:10,995 --> 01:20:12,734
Until just a sip

938
01:20:14,261 --> 01:20:16,864
takes you beyond and ravages you.

939
01:20:25,728 --> 01:20:28,206
I'll always love you, Elizabeth,

940
01:20:29,195 --> 01:20:30,900
as long as I live,

941
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:34,998
but us, together,

942
01:20:37,828 --> 01:20:39,431
it'll destroy me.

943
01:20:42,528 --> 01:20:44,096
I can't do it.

944
01:20:49,728 --> 01:20:52,899
That's what I wanted to say to you.
All I had to say, but...

945
01:20:52,995 --> 01:20:59,372
That's why I did this bloody job,
to ask your forgiveness, because...

946
01:21:01,595 --> 01:21:07,766
your love, I know,
is total and unqualified

947
01:21:09,928 --> 01:21:12,735
and it makes a mockery
of all my bombast.

948
01:21:14,095 --> 01:21:16,164
I can't do it anymore.

949
01:21:16,694 --> 01:21:20,195
I can't match you, Elizabeth.
I'm not as brave as you.

950
01:21:21,928 --> 01:21:24,065
And I'm sorry for that.

951
01:21:27,061 --> 01:21:29,096
For not measuring up as a man.

952
01:21:29,694 --> 01:21:31,672
You're Richard Burton.

953
01:21:32,562 --> 01:21:34,937
You're every man there ever was.

954
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:41,836
I know,

955
01:21:43,095 --> 01:21:44,834
and I have known,

956
01:21:45,661 --> 01:21:47,196
for awhile.

957
01:21:48,828 --> 01:21:50,534
I just didn't want to admit it.

958
01:21:54,428 --> 01:21:56,269
I'm gonna miss you.

959
01:22:02,195 --> 01:22:05,230
- I'm gonna miss you.
- No, no, no, love.

960
01:22:07,362 --> 01:22:08,600
No.

961
01:22:09,395 --> 01:22:11,702
I couldn't manage that, either.

962
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:15,330
I love Sally, Elizabeth.

963
01:22:16,195 --> 01:22:20,435
My time is with her now.
But I need you in my life as well.

964
01:22:22,561 --> 01:22:25,835
I can't ever be completely apart
from you again.

965
01:22:27,195 --> 01:22:32,901
Right, so you want me close but not...
Not too close?

966
01:22:35,528 --> 01:22:38,335
I'm sorry, I'm bloody hopeless.

967
01:22:38,395 --> 01:22:41,600
Yeah, you're bloody hopeless.

968
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:51,162
- What about another play?
- Oh, God! No!

969
01:22:53,561 --> 01:22:55,561
At least, not together.

970
01:22:58,362 --> 01:23:03,102
Yeah, well, I think I'm ready
for a break from the stage.

971
01:23:07,261 --> 01:23:11,103
I'll come and watch you, though.
And whatever you're in.

972
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:14,502
You're the greatest actor
I have ever seen, Richard.

973
01:23:17,362 --> 01:23:19,271
Likewise, Elizabeth.

974
01:23:22,894 --> 01:23:24,838
What a King you'll be.

975
01:23:33,161 --> 01:23:38,071
I'm worried, you know. About my arms.
Carrying on Cordelia at the end.

976
01:23:38,161 --> 01:23:40,764
- Oh, you'll be fine.
- They're so weak.

977
01:23:41,527 --> 01:23:43,766
The nerve damage is...

978
01:23:43,861 --> 01:23:47,669
Richard, you can do it. Look. Try.
Try now.

979
01:23:48,362 --> 01:23:51,601
- Lift you?
- Yeah, just take me over to the couch.

980
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:55,070
- But Cordelia's...
- What? Thinner?

981
01:23:55,527 --> 01:23:58,698
No, no. She's younger.
I mean, she's waif-like.

982
01:23:58,995 --> 01:24:01,405
- Thinner.

983
01:24:03,861 --> 01:24:05,032
I---

984
01:24:05,561 --> 01:24:07,903
Come on, you can do it, come on.

985
01:24:09,428 --> 01:24:12,667
Yay! You see, you see?
You can do it, Richard.

986
01:24:12,728 --> 01:24:14,831
- Yeah, it's okay.
- You see, I know you.

987
01:24:14,894 --> 01:24:17,031
- Better than you know yourself.
- Yeah.

988
01:24:18,494 --> 01:24:21,938
- You wanna say the lines?
- No, not at the same time, no!

989
01:24:33,061 --> 01:24:36,561
- I'll never do it.
- You'll be fine!
