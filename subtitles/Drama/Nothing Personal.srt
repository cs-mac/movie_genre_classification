00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:07,304
SOLEDAD

2
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,207
- Need Help?
- No, do you?

3
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:45,180
Can you take me?

4
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,442
- Where?
- Everywhere.

5
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:52,489
No, sorry
we have kids.

6
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:57,200
I understand.

7
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:45,493
What is wrong with you ...

8
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,073
Stupid whore!

9
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:59,104
THE END OF A RELATIONSHIP

10
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:49,952
Hello.

11
00:16:58,008 --> 00:17:00,582
What's your name?

12
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,803
That does not give a shit.

13
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:15,189
It need not be rude.

14
00:17:20,243 --> 00:17:24,076
You can work in the garden
in exchange for food.

15
00:18:00,248 --> 00:18:03,914
I did not know what they are,
so I've left.

16
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:07,747
If desired, the plant.

17
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:12,130
These are plants ...

18
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:16,515
and that is grass.

19
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,349
There is not much difference.

20
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:26,478
Well, this smells a little onion.

21
00:18:26,696 --> 00:18:29,069
Chives.

22
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,701
You work well.

23
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:41,378
Want a job? I have no
help from the death of my wife ...

24
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:46,964
His story does not interest me.
The agreement was "Food for Work."

25
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:52,101
Well, let's eat.

26
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:27,976
- Come, enter.
- I prefer to eat alone.

27
00:19:30,313 --> 00:19:32,887
- I'm just being polite.
- I do not.

28
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:35,350
Fuck!

29
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:40,276
First my food.

30
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:12,022
- At least I could say thanks.
- Why?

31
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:14,729
I worked for it.

32
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:57,620
- Where are you going?
- I just go.

33
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,541
Stay so good
as leave.

34
00:20:59,752 --> 00:21:02,421
How do you know? You can not go.

35
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,667
- Why not?
- Because you're old.

36
00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:09,384
Stay and work for me.
You can leave at any time.

37
00:21:09,597 --> 00:21:11,139
Okay.

38
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:14,599
Do not ask me questions
and I did not speak.

39
00:21:14,811 --> 00:21:16,306
Well, agreed.

40
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:20,976
Only one question:

41
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,531
- What is your name?
- Why do you want to know why?

42
00:21:26,742 --> 00:21:29,946
May be practical,
I have to call it something.

43
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:33,497
In this case simply saying "you."

44
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,910
Hey, you!

45
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:44,042
It worked ...
breakfast is at seven.

46
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:33,882
Among!

47
00:23:35,435 --> 00:23:39,647
- Do you want a trench coat?
- No rain.

48
00:23:39,857 --> 00:23:41,897
Not yet.

49
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:09,130
- Did you sleep well?
- From wonder.

50
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,592
Thanks.

51
00:24:11,811 --> 00:24:13,686
And you?

52
00:24:15,316 --> 00:24:18,103
Okay, thanks.

53
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:20,312
Charming!

54
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,345
Would you like opera?

55
00:24:42,556 --> 00:24:45,474
No questions, he said.

56
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:49,019
So you know ...

57
00:24:49,231 --> 00:24:54,226
- Why? What it does
- I'm leaving.

58
00:24:54,445 --> 00:24:55,904
Wait!

59
00:24:56,114 --> 00:25:01,571
Each time you break our agreement,
I have to sing a song.

60
00:25:01,787 --> 00:25:04,409
Are you kidding?

61
00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:13,967
Okay, man. Sing!

62
00:25:14,177 --> 00:25:15,719
Now?

63
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:23,385
Well, I can not sing now.
before I have to prepare something.

64
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:09,819
- Basta.
- What?

65
00:26:17,293 --> 00:26:19,618
Let's get to work.

66
00:26:27,138 --> 00:26:30,056
First use the shovel ...

67
00:26:30,266 --> 00:26:32,840
to discover the mob.

68
00:26:56,923 --> 00:26:58,963
And then ...

69
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:04,385
using the hoe.

70
00:27:15,236 --> 00:27:16,944
Try it.

71
00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:44,635
That's fine.

72
00:31:28,117 --> 00:31:31,321
The need in the kitchen.

73
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:08,937
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

74
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:38,422
- What it does
- It's a surprise.

75
00:35:00,451 --> 00:35:04,497
Potato.
The spirit of the land.

76
00:35:04,706 --> 00:35:09,499
Enjoy and celebrate this simple
but sophisticated Parfait ...

77
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:12,797
freshly harvested potatoes.

78
00:35:13,008 --> 00:35:18,050
Served with mushrooms as a symbol
the dark, soft wood.

79
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,682
Are you being funny?

80
00:35:24,897 --> 00:35:27,353
No, ironic.

81
00:35:33,156 --> 00:35:37,285
- Thanks for the music.
- Thanks for dinner.

82
00:35:39,497 --> 00:35:41,324
Bon appetit.

83
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:43,750
Thanks.

84
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,100
Wake up.

85
00:38:22,064 --> 00:38:24,271
Wake up!

86
00:38:26,235 --> 00:38:29,570
- You can not stay here.
- Why?

87
00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:31,821
Because I Said So.

88
00:38:54,143 --> 00:38:56,267
Hey, you!

89
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:02,981
I want to show something.

90
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:11,446
Come!

91
00:39:28,893 --> 00:39:31,811
This will be your room.

92
00:43:08,568 --> 00:43:12,107
- I can help?
- No, thanks.

93
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:15,573
- Good night.
- Good night.

94
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:26,625
MARRIAGE

95
00:44:29,873 --> 00:44:31,035
Adelante!

96
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,921
Sit.

97
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:54,310
Sorry, I can not
offer any refreshment.

98
00:45:07,834 --> 00:45:11,500
I would like
watch me tonight.

99
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:17,756
I have fear of dying
in my sleep.

100
00:45:20,474 --> 00:45:22,431
Vale.

101
00:46:33,143 --> 00:46:36,180
I broke our agreement.

102
00:46:36,397 --> 00:46:38,769
Yes, you did.

103
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:43,356
Do I sing?

104
00:46:50,038 --> 00:46:54,202
- I did not want to scare you.
- You did not.

105
00:47:02,344 --> 00:47:06,177
You can return to your own bed.

106
00:47:08,184 --> 00:47:11,139
Are you sure?

107
00:47:11,355 --> 00:47:13,644
I'm fine.

108
00:47:16,277 --> 00:47:18,069
Thanks.

109
00:47:25,496 --> 00:47:29,245
- Good night.
- Good night.

110
00:48:46,258 --> 00:48:48,963
I picked up a book.

111
00:48:49,178 --> 00:48:53,473
Well. You can catch them
whenever you want.

112
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,756
Today was a beautiful day.

113
00:49:26,138 --> 00:49:28,511
Yes, indeed.

114
00:49:35,399 --> 00:49:37,725
Good night.

115
00:49:39,988 --> 00:49:43,155
Do you want to go out?

116
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,241
Sure. Why not?

117
00:49:58,677 --> 00:50:01,049
What do you drink?

118
00:50:01,263 --> 00:50:03,387
A beer.

119
00:50:23,998 --> 00:50:26,288
- Tome.
- Thanks.

120
00:50:56,954 --> 00:51:00,489
- Who is it?
- No idea.

121
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:04,541
Do not you know and
pay him a beer?

122
00:51:34,206 --> 00:51:37,243
Eight, nine, ten ...

123
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:40,627
eleven, twelve, thirteen ...

124
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:44,006
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen ...

125
00:51:44,218 --> 00:51:47,422
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen ...

126
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:51,091
twenty ...

127
00:52:06,786 --> 00:52:08,281
Come!

128
00:53:07,816 --> 00:53:09,560
Hey, you!

129
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,529
That's me, not you!

130
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:24,116
Wait, I have to pee.

131
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,747
You're drunk as a Cuba.

132
00:53:27,047 --> 00:53:28,246
Wait!

133
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:31,633
And you're talking nonsense!

134
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:34,506
You're drunk.

135
00:54:16,773 --> 00:54:18,980
Hurry!

136
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:34,699
"I can teach you a thing?

137
00:54:38,298 --> 00:54:42,628
- Let
- Again you have to pee?

138
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,473
Look!

139
00:55:10,795 --> 00:55:12,752
For you.

140
00:55:15,425 --> 00:55:17,335
Thanks.

141
00:55:18,929 --> 00:55:21,421
It is really good.

142
00:55:24,227 --> 00:55:27,312
Now, make it stop.

143
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:32,357
I can not.

144
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:37,367
No matter.

145
00:55:37,576 --> 00:55:42,916
Is not given to us to fight
for perfection.

146
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,701
Go ahead.

147
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:27,170
Become a breakfast for you.

148
00:56:28,553 --> 00:56:32,848
- What do I have to do today?
- What do you do?

149
00:56:34,894 --> 00:56:38,892
- Want some breakfast?
- Yeah, right.

150
00:57:33,338 --> 00:57:38,001
<i> Nothing really disappears.
Everything remains in the world of men. </ I></i>

151
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:43,622
- Want to come?
- Yes, please.

152
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:55,846
The meat is delicious.

153
00:58:58,355 --> 00:59:01,771
What is your favorite color?

154
00:59:01,984 --> 00:59:03,526
Hey, you ...

155
00:59:03,736 --> 00:59:08,695
sounds suspiciously
a personal question.

156
00:59:10,411 --> 00:59:15,073
- Then I broke our agreement.
- Yes, I did.

157
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:20,797
I guess I have to punish me?

158
00:59:21,006 --> 00:59:23,961
I can not wait.

159
00:59:46,745 --> 00:59:48,868
What horoscope sign are you?

160
00:59:59,135 --> 01:00:03,133
- What is that?
- Country Gothic or Psicobilly.

161
01:00:03,348 --> 01:00:05,840
- It's kitsch.
- Kitsch?

162
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:09,809
You're too educated,
to know what is good.

163
01:01:03,711 --> 01:01:06,202
Okay.

164
01:01:08,467 --> 01:01:11,005
What was the question?

165
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,385
- What is your favorite number?
- Very.

166
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,593
Mine is zero.

167
01:01:20,105 --> 01:01:22,597
Who are you?

168
01:02:38,948 --> 01:02:43,492
THE BEGINNING OF A RELATIONSHIP

169
01:03:23,084 --> 01:03:26,168
Hello, do you have an appointment?

170
01:03:26,588 --> 01:03:28,462
I do not speak Dutch.

171
01:03:28,673 --> 01:03:30,132
- Do you speak English?
- Yes One moment.

172
01:05:02,993 --> 01:05:06,197
Could you leave me alone for a moment?

173
01:05:06,414 --> 01:05:08,122
Why?

174
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:11,702
To get used to the site.

175
01:05:12,963 --> 01:05:14,707
Okay.

176
01:07:23,534 --> 01:07:28,909
- They are a bit larger.
- You must wear two pairs of socks.

177
01:07:30,834 --> 01:07:33,871
Like I said.

178
01:07:38,843 --> 01:07:42,011
- I can try?
- No.

179
01:07:44,141 --> 01:07:46,633
Why not?

180
01:07:46,853 --> 01:07:49,060
I do not trust you.

181
01:08:05,959 --> 01:08:11,998
- No one will be here.
- Maybe I love you so.

182
01:08:15,845 --> 01:08:18,633
You're not the type to do so.

183
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,177
- I do not know.
- Sure.

184
01:08:22,395 --> 01:08:24,803
Afraid I do not!

185
01:08:52,764 --> 01:08:54,389
Martin ...

186
01:08:55,976 --> 01:08:59,180
Have you taken medicine today?

187
01:09:49,497 --> 01:09:52,415
No one will find here.
