2
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,320
Mama.

Comrade Sr. Lieutenant!

17
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,760
What is it?

18
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,960
The lieutenant told me
to bring him to you.

19
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,120
Light the lamp.

20
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,280
He was in the river, near the bank.

21
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,720
He won't answer any questions.

22
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
He says he'll only talk
to the commander.

23
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,640
He's very weak, or else pretending.

24
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,080
So, I brought him here.

25
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,760
Stand near the stove. Who are you?

26
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,880
First, send him out.

27
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Wait outside. I'll call you.

28
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,320
Well? Say something.
Where are you from?

29
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,080
I'm Bondarev.

30
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,200
Tell No.51 at HQ that I'm here.

31
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,480
Who's No.51?

32
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,600
What HQ do you mean?

33
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,480
Code address VCH-49550.

34
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,440
Strip and rub yourself down.

35
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,460
Here.

36
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,500
Take off your pants, too.
Don't be bashful.

37
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,840
What's that on your back?

38
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,640
Answer me!

39
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,160
None of your business.
And don't shout at me.

40
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,040
You just tell HQ I'm here.

41
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,600
They know what to do.

42
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,520
Don't you teach me.
You know where you are?

43
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
I never heard of you.

44
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,960
You'll stay here till
you tell me who you are,

45
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,040
and where you're from.

46
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,560
I won't report that you're
here to anyone.

47
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,760
I'm from the other bank.

48
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,720
Can you prove it?

49
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,600
I don't have to prove anything.

50
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,960
And stop questioning me!

51
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,920
Tell No.51 at HQ
that Bondarev's here. Now!

52
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,440
They'll know what to do.

53
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,680
No.3?

54
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,240
A chap named Bondarev is here.

55
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,400
He wants me to notify HQ.

56
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,960
You mean Maj.Bondarev?

57
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,440
No. He's only about 12.

58
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,640
Are you sober?

59
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,480
He says he's from the other side
of the river.

60
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,440
Don't be so gullible.

61
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,360
If he doesn't notify No.51,
he'll be held responsible.

62
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,000
See? I did what you asked me to.

63
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,840
He told me to lock you up.

64
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,720
I asked you to tell No.51.

65
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,120
Who'd you ring up?

66
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,640
You expect me to contact Army HQ?!

67
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,200
- Let me do it.
- Don't you dare!

68
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,160
Who d'you know
at Army HQ?

69
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,320
Capt. Holin

70
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,840
and Col.Gryaznov.

71
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,600
Tell Col.Gryaznov I'm here.
At once.

72
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,080
Or I'll do it.

73
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,200
Get me No.51 at HQ.

74
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,000
Sr.Lt.Galtsev reporting.

75
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,400
Bondarev is here. He says--

76
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,920
Is he alone there?

77
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,880
Listen carefully, Galtsev.

78
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,680
No questions. No talking!

79
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,160
Holin's coming for him immediately.

80
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,320
Be nice to him.

81
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,480
He has a hot temper.

82
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,880
Give him paper and pencil.

83
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,000
Send his report on to me at once.

84
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,600
Yes, sir!

85
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,040
Are you hungry?

86
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,400
I'll eat later.

87
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,960
I won't look.

88
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,560
Get me No.13.

89
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,440
Vasilyev.

90
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,120
Bring in two pails
of hot water.

91
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,680
What? Yes, for a bath.

92
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,440
Go on, wash up. I'll be back soon.

93
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,920
Thanks.

94
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,360
It's deep!

95
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,440
Of course it is.

96
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
You can see a star

97
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,120
in the day-time in a deep well.

98
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,360
Which star?

99
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,040
Any star?

100
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,000
I see a star, Mama!

101
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,880
Why's it shining?

102
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,320
It's night-time now for the star.

103
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,560
That's why it's shining.

104
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,680
Is it night-time now?

105
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,840
No, it's day-time.

106
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,280
It's day-time for us,

107
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,680
but night-time for the star.

108
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,920
Haven't they come yet?

109
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,200
No. Go to sleep.
I'll wake you up when they do.

110
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,920
Were you here while I was sleeping?

111
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,600
Yes. Why?

112
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,640
Did I talk in my sleep?

113
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,320
No. Why?

114
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,240
Never mind.

115
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,520
I never used to talk
in my sleep. Now I don't know.

116
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,840
I've become jittery.

117
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,800
Ivan!

118
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,800
Holin!

119
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,840
Katasonych is waiting for you
at the hollow tree!

120
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,400
The nazis are there.

121
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,880
I nearly drowned, swimming across.

122
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,160
- You mean you swam across?
- Yes.

123
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
They're patrolling the bank.

124
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,560
I couldn't find our boat
in the dark.

125
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,680
You're just skin and bones.

126
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,920
Drive the car up closer.

127
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,000
Tell the sentry
not to let anyone in.

128
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,880
Here, put this on.

129
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,640
Stop!

130
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,440
Where'd you disappear to?

131
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,240
- Where are you going?
- For kerosene.

132
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,040
We're leaving.

133
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,720
Here's to meeting again!

134
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,480
Holin. Katasonych is waiting
at the hollow tree.

135
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,080
Here's to his safe return.

136
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,000
- No.20 here.
- It's No. 51

137
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,800
They were right, Malyshev.

138
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,840
We'll follow their plan.

139
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,560
But we decided--

140
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,440
Yes, I know.

141
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,320
May I come in, Colonel?

142
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,440
I've reliable,

143
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,840
first-hand information.

144
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,840
Waited all night for nothing,
eh, Katasonych?

145
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,600
Ivan's here.

146
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:20,400
He couldn't get to the hollow tree.

147
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
There's German patrols

148
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,960
everywhere.

149
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,200
How did he get here?

150
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,720
He swam across.

151
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,000
A grown man might've drowned.

152
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,320
Well, that's enough.

153
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,360
Wait, Ivan!

154
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,000
He said I'll be sent to the rear.

155
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,840
To a military school.

156
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,320
Is that true?

157
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,960
You cheating me?

158
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,360
The assault is soon.
I can still be useful.

159
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,240
You said reconnaissance
is most important!

160
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,600
That scouts are
the soul of the front.

161
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,400
You're trying to trick me!

162
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,640
I won't go! If you force me to,

163
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,040
I'll run away and join
the partisans.

164
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,120
You're going to a military school.
Understand?

165
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,440
I won't discuss this.

166
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,200
But I will!

167
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,440
Tell him I'll do a good job, Holin.

168
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,760
I'll do my best.

169
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,360
I can't go...

170
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,600
You tell him, Katasonych.
I can't go.

171
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,600
The matter is closed!

172
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,520
All right... Military school,
or a children's home--

173
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,600
It's all the same to me.

174
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,360
Relax.

175
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,080
The stove and chimney
will stand forever.

176
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,600
Where is it? I put it here.

177
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,040
- Are you going far?
- Yes.

178
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,520
Everybody is nowadays.

179
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:29,200
But why? Who knows?

180
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,600
I lost a nail.

181
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
Could you help me find it?

182
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,240
Come in.

183
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,720
No stove and chimney

184
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,920
will ever burn down.

185
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,960
Here's a straight nail.

186
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,600
No, not that one.

187
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,360
Where's your ma? Alive?

188
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,600
A nazi shot my old woman, too.

189
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,480
Where can it be? I just had it.

190
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,600
He was a tall fellow.

191
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,040
He wore glasses.

192
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,440
And had a lot of hair.

193
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,880
- What's your name?
- Ivan.

194
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,080
My wife'll be back soon.

195
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,440
I'll have the house
all ready for her.

196
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,920
Why'd you run away?

197
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,440
Think I'm going to chase after you?

198
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,360
I didn't ask you to.

199
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,400
- Watch your tongue!
- You wanted to join partisans, eh.

200
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,360
Get into the car!
You won't run away again!

201
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,320
- Yes, I will.
- I said get into the car!

202
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,240
I'll run away from
that military school,

203
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,960
just like I did from
the children's home.

204
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,160
"I ran away from Granny,
And from Grandad, too--"

205
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,960
O Lord, will this ever end?

206
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,840
Can't you understand, silly?

207
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,040
War is for grown men.

208
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,640
But you promised--

209
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,600
Lakhov and Moroz were killed
because they were big.

210
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,080
I can get through anywhere.
Besides, I'm all alone.

211
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,520
I have no family left.

212
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,200
That's enough. It's been decided.

213
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,920
It hasn't!

214
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,240
You're not my dad to decide.

215
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,360
Shut up!

216
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,640
Or I'll spank you.

217
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,960
I'll run away anyway.

218
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,080
I'm my own boss.

219
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,840
Indeed!

220
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
You are a problem.

221
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,940
There's lice in Company 5.

222
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,860
The linen isn't
disinfected properly.

223
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,300
Please do something about it.

224
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,140
Yes, Lieutenant.

225
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,460
It's a bad situation.

226
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:47,020
There'll be no time for that
when the offensive begins.

227
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,420
Yes, Lieutenant.

228
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,100
Thank you.

229
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,100
A letter from home?

230
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,540
- Yes.
- Everything all right?

231
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,380
Yes.

232
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,220
Greetings! I've been
looking for you.

233
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,660
Carry on. I'll wait.

234
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,620
You must be stricter
with your subordinates.

235
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,820
But you try to do
everything yourself.

236
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,180
There's a lull now,
and we have time.

237
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,180
When the offensive starts,
there'll be the wounded.

238
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,580
You are a problem.

239
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,300
Get the medical service in order.

240
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,820
Report back to me in 2 days.

241
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,340
Yes, sir.

242
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,980
Don't worry.
Everything'll be in order.

243
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,540
What's your name, Lieutenant?

244
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,380
Masha.

245
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,340
That's a pretty name.

246
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,360
My name's Leonid.

247
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,920
Lennie for short.

248
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,480
D'you have

249
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,840
- a boyfriend?
- No. I've never had one.

250
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,840
So I'm the first?

251
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,000
- Are you from the Ukraine?
- Why do you ask?

252
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,640
You're a beautiful... and stubborn.

253
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,560
No, I come from near Moscow.

254
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,680
Peredelkino station,
20 minutes by the train.

255
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,120
In Siberia, 300 km
is considered "near".

256
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,919
Surikov, the artist,
came from there.

257
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,480
Ever heard of him?

258
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,360
Writers lived near our town.

259
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,440
We once saw Alexei Tolstoi

260
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,560
and Chukovsky, too,
grey-haired and lanky.

261
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,360
walking in the woods.

262
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,439
- Were you ever wounded?
- Yes.

263
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,400
Why are we so formal?

264
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,960
Let's use the "tu" form.

265
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,360
I find it hard to at first.

266
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,639
I'll start now,

267
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,880
and you start gradually... Okay?

268
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,840
- What?
- Look, a cobweb!

269
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,759
How spooky.

270
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,400
Aren't you a brave soldier!

271
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,440
Shame on you.

272
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,320
I'm only afraid of spiders.

273
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
Nothing else?

274
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,919
Seen Capt.Holin anyplace?

275
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,480
He went thata way

276
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,960
with the doctor's assistant.

277
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:05,199
Walk the trunk. You said
you're not afraid of anything.

278
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,560
I can so.

279
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,400
That's enough.

280
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,840
Jump!
I'll catch you.

281
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,600
Frightened? No?

282
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,160
Then why don't you?

283
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,880
No special reason.

284
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,240
Were you frightened?

285
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,400
I forgive you.

286
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,440
I don't need your forgiveness.

287
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,400
- Let me help you.
- I'll manage.

288
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,960
Come here, Masha.

289
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,600
What for?

290
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,800
Come closer, Masha.

291
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,400
What for?

292
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,640
Quick, come here.

293
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,760
Hurry!

294
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,000
Now go away.

295
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,600
You hear me? Go.

296
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,280
Go away quick, Masha.

297
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,120
Let's have a look at your troops.

298
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,600
Lakhov and Moroz are there.

299
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,800
Go and have a smoke.

300
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,240
- Salute.
- Hello, Katasonych.

301
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,480
Give me the defence line map,
Galtsev.

302
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,880
I'll be right back. Wait for me.

303
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,880
Some gunners gave me a record.

304
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,919
They said you had a phonograph.

305
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,960
It's broken.

306
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,720
I'll fix it.

307
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,919
Thanks.

308
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,160
This place is best, Captain.

309
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,399
But where will we land?

310
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,720
In those bushes.

311
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,920
It's a safe place.

312
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,480
Tell the gunners

313
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,600
to leave us a corridor.

314
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,240
WELCOME

315
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,000
Damn! Couldn't you have
dug a deeper one?

316
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,640
D'you know who's on the other bank?

317
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,160
- Yeah, I know.
- Can't you bring them here?

318
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,120
It'll take an hour or so.

319
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,320
- Have you got any boats?
- No.

320
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,400
- Why lying?
- What do you need them for?

321
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,000
I need them.

322
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,480
- You're a bad liar.
- They're for the landing party.

323
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,839
That's what I need them for!

324
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,200
A scouting mission?

325
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,759
No, a picnic with your phonograph.

326
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,320
Will Ivan go again?

327
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,560
I'm not Information.

328
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,760
What's so funny?

329
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,600
Oh, nothing. You've a pretty
doctor's assistant.

330
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,720
I'm sending her away.
She can't cope with the job.

331
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,240
Have a heart.

332
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,680
War is a man's business.

333
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,240
It's not for girls.

334
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,440
I don't need you here... man!

335
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,759
Excuse me, are you Masha?

336
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,320
Yes.

337
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,880
Don't you remember me?

338
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,400
No, I don't.

339
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,920
We took the college
entrance exams together.

340
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,440
Yes, now I do.

341
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,600
I'm so glad I met you!

342
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,800
Me, too.

343
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,280
Where'd you go after the exams?

344
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,480
I looked everywhere.
Now I've found you.

345
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,320
I've found you, Masha!

346
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,879
We'll meet again, Masha!

347
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,440
We'll meet again!

348
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,880
WELCOME

349
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,120
Here we are, Captain.

350
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,360
- Hello, Holin.
- Hello, Ivan.

351
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,360
Ivan?

352
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,480
Give us a hand, Galtsev.

353
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,840
Hello, Katasonych.

354
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,720
Let's have some interesting
magazines.

355
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,920
With lots of pictures.

356
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,160
Come here.

357
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,360
This one's about scouts.

358
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,280
I've read it.

359
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,520
How about this one?

360
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,120
This one, too.

361
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,960
And this one? You're lying.

362
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,440
I'm not. I was stuck at HQ
all this time.

363
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,240
I did nothing but read for 3 days.

364
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,759
I got you a spring for
the phonograph at HQ.

365
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,600
Thanks. It's under the bed.

366
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,160
What's this?

367
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,480
- An art album.
- With pictures?

368
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,720
It's all pictures.

369
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,400
He can talk like a real German.

370
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,839
I wanted to take him on
as an interpreter last year.

371
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,279
Now he's in command of a battalion.

372
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,800
Are these Germans?

373
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,480
- Yes. It's an old engraving.
- They're Germans, all the same.

374
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,840
And this one, on the horse,

375
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,000
I saw one just like him
on a motorcycle.

376
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,840
Look, they're killing the people
here, too.

377
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,800
It's just a painting.

378
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,520
No. I know them.

379
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,880
Is he a German, too?

380
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,400
Yes. He's a German doctor,
or writer.

381
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,720
They have no writers.

382
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,240
I saw them burning books
on the square.

383
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,680
They poured petrol over them.

384
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,280
The soot was in the air
for 7 days thereafter.

385
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,640
This writer lived about
400 years ago.

386
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,960
Well, then maybe--

387
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:01,000
If they spot us, our gunners
will keep them down.

388
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,200
We'll leave Ivan a passage
in the swamp.

389
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,480
I retreat last.

390
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,240
What's this?

391
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,760
I'll take one of Galtsev's boats.

392
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,240
Will you take me

393
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,319
across, too?

394
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,880
A volunteer, eh?

395
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,600
Can you swim?

396
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,480
I can swim this river 5 times.

397
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,400
Great.

398
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,920
Are you trigger-happy?

399
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,200
Listen, you--

400
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,880
He's pissed off, see?

401
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,400
No self-control!

402
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,280
How can I take you across?

403
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,200
- Then you don't get a boat.
- We'll commandeer it.

404
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,960
Or I'll report you to
the divisional commander,

405
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,680
and you'll bring it here
on your back.

406
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,400
He'll give us a boat.

407
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,400
Let's go have a look.

408
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,560
You stay here and rest up.

409
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,520
What a knife!

410
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,720
Would you give it to me?

411
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,640
Sure, but--

412
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,560
Don't be greedy. Give it to him.

413
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,880
It was my buddy's. He was killed.

414
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,320
Let me have it till tonight.

415
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,920
All right.

416
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,640
So you're not taking
me across, right?

417
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,480
I will, but not today.

418
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,400
After the war.

419
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,760
It's okay now.

420
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,200
We'll listen to it after supper.

421
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,400
I'll get you a knife just like it.

422
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,400
I'll get one tomorrow.

423
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,280
By all means.

424
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,800
Where are Ivan's parents?

425
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,520
The nazis killed
his mother and sister.

426
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,360
His dad was a border guard.
He was killed in action.

427
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,760
He's been through more
than you can imagine.

428
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,000
He was a partisan, too.

429
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,560
What'll become of him?

430
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,200
The colonel or Katasonych

431
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,640
will adopt him
when the war's over.

432
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,800
Why them and not you?

433
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,640
The colonel says

434
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,480
I need bringing up myself.

435
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,880
He's really good at stealing boats.

436
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,000
He'll never take a bad one.

437
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:15,400
How many boats have you stolen?

438
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,880
Take this one.

439
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,520
He should be sent to the rear.

440
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,720
A war's no place for children.

441
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,400
If we don't take him across,

442
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,280
he'll go on his own.

443
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,320
All he can think of

444
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,360
is vengeance.

445
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,640
Don't waste your breath
explaining.

446
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,480
Didn't you say you wanted
to adopt him?

447
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,240
Get lost! We'll manage.

448
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,640
You do need upbringing.

449
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,600
Watch out, or I'll report you
to the commander.

450
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,960
Keep cool... that's the main thing.

451
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,280
Slowly... carefully--

452
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,960
We have to get him alive.

453
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,840
THERE ARE 8 OF US

454
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,400
ALL UNDER 19

455
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,880
IN AN HOUR FROM NOW
THEY'LL SHOOT US

456
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,800
AVENGE US

457
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,880
Hurrah!

458
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,200
Surround the building!
Don't let him out!

459
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,000
Hands up!

460
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,720
Come out!

461
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,120
You can't hide from me!

462
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,960
Are you shaking?

463
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:27,800
You'll answer for everything! I'll--

464
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,400
D'you think I've forgotten?

465
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,960
I'll put you on trial!

466
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,800
I'll-- I'll--

467
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,720
Welcome to our tea party!

468
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,920
Damn! It was our best boat!

469
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,600
Damn! It was our best boat!

470
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,400
Faster!

471
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,320
Hurry!

472
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,240
Ivan! Ivan!

473
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,440
Don't be afraid.
It'll soon be over.

474
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,120
What is it, Ivan?

475
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,160
I'm not afraid.

476
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:19,380
I hear you were a partisan.

477
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,940
Why'd you leave them?

478
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,500
The nazis surrounded us
in the woods.

479
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,660
They sent me out by plane
to a boarding school.

480
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,900
But I ran away.

481
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:33,740
They only go
for stupid cramming there,

482
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,060
"herbivorous in the life of Man"
and so on.

483
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:41,460
You ought to go
to a military school.

484
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:47,900
Did Holin say so?

485
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:50,740
He's not the only one with brains.

486
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:55,860
You've done your fighting.
Rest up, go back to school.

487
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,220
Whoever's of use doesn't
rest up in wartime.

488
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,860
Only dodgers rest up.

489
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,100
Right, but war isn't for boys.

490
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,860
Oh, really?

491
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:13,060
Did you see the Trostyanets
death camp?

492
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,340
What're you talking about?

493
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,620
What do you know?

494
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,060
You're all at one against me.

495
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,460
Smoking again? Go on.

496
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,380
It'll turn your lungs green.

497
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:15,900
So what? Nobody can see them.

498
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,620
Don't smoke.

499
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,220
Okay, I won't.

500
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:26,740
Let's have supper
before we start out.

501
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,940
Where's Katasonych?

502
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,220
He was summoned to HQ.

503
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:36,459
Why didn't he stop by
to wish me good luck?

504
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,859
He couldn't. It was an urgent summons.

505
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,980
Why'd they summon him?

506
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,779
They know how badly we need him.

507
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:30,460
A fine friend!
He could've stopped by.

508
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:36,620
Will it be just the two of us?

509
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,820
No. He'll join us.

510
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:46,220
Stop grinning.
You know what I mean.

511
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,340
Volunteered, didn't you?
Are you frightened now?

512
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,900
It's sort of unexpected.

513
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,660
Everything in life is.

514
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,300
May I come in?

515
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:07,860
What's up?

516
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:12,100
We billeted the new men, Lieutenant.

517
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:16,020
- Where?
- Companies 2 and 3.

518
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,860
Very well. You may go.

519
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,980
I wouldn't take you,
but it's an emergency.

520
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:31,060
Make up your mind.
No complaints afterwards.

521
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:38,140
What d'you think I am?

522
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,940
Who'll you leave

523
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,620
in command?

524
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:47,940
Gushchin, of Company 5.

525
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:56,459
If they learn you crossed the river

526
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,380
without permission,

527
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,220
we'll be in trouble.

528
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,500
AVENGE US

529
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,940
Wake up, Ivan!

530
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,860
Katasonych didn't even stop by.

531
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,140
I told you he couldn't.

532
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:38,700
He loves you very much.

533
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,860
I know. But still, he could have--

534
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,259
Get dressed. Need any help?

535
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:51,740
No.

536
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,180
Let's jump.

537
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:38,660
To see if anything rattles.

538
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:44,300
Dump your matches.

539
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:07,300
Are you crazy?

540
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,859
THERE ARE 8 OF US
ALL UNDER 19

541
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:27,819
IN AN HOUR FROM NOW
THEY'LL SHOOT US. AVENGE US

542
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,900
Go chat with the sentry

543
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,460
so he won't notice us.

544
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:47,700
And no comments!

545
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,340
Got a light?

546
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:16,340
Who's that?

547
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:24,700
It was all so stupid.

548
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:28,820
They brought the boat here
and had a smoke.

549
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:32,020
The captain was here.
He was over there.

550
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,900
He started climbing out
of the trench.

551
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:39,739
And then he slid back down.

552
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,420
We didn't even hear a shot.

553
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:49,260
"Katasonych!" the captain cried.

554
01:08:50,899 --> 01:08:53,099
But he was dead.

555
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,300
The captain said to leave
him here till morning.

556
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:04,220
Don't discuss it.
Get the oars.

557
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,780
Who's that, Holin?

558
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:40,900
Lakhov and Moroz.

559
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:43,740
They went across after you.

560
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:03,380
There's still time.

561
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:58,020
Wait here. I'll be right back.

562
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,700
It's dryer here.

563
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,940
Makes no difference now.

564
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:08,460
Are you worried?

565
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,660
A bit... I've become jittery.

566
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:15,980
Can't get used to begging.

567
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:21,060
- They should be buried.
- Who?

568
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,820
Lakhov and Moroz.

569
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:27,220
Of course we will.

570
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:29,460
Quiet!

571
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:32,500
Let's go.

572
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,820
This is the place.

573
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:20,700
How do you feel?

574
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:22,620
Fine... Well, I'll be going.

575
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,860
I'll go a part of the way
with you.

576
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:27,740
No, you're too big.
They'll catch on.

577
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:30,940
The gully's clayey.
I'll carry you over.

578
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,140
I said I'm going alone.

579
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:37,900
See you soon.

580
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:44,780
See you soon...

581
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:47,340
Be careful.

582
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:50,700
If the offensive starts,
meet us in Fyodorovka.

583
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:55,300
- See you.
- Good-bye, Ivan.

584
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:18,900
What's up?

585
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,300
I want a smoke.

586
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:23,900
Want your mama, too?

587
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:27,260
I, for one,
really do want my ma.

588
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:52,140
They'll notice the boat.

589
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:54,380
What if they spot Ivan?

590
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:57,220
Are you a louse, or just stupid?

591
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:58,900
Just stupid.

592
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:05,139
See a doctor about your nerves
when the war's over.

593
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:08,060
It's a clayey gully!

594
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:11,620
A good rain would wash away
his footprints.

595
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:19,300
I think he made it.

596
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:26,660
Wait here for me.
I'll go for the boat.

597
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:32,100
When I come back,
call out to me in German.

598
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:38,300
If I'm caught, swim back.

599
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:40,780
You said you could swim
this river 5 times.

600
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,460
What if you're wounded?

601
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:49,020
Don't you worry about me.

602
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:15,300
Quiet, damn you! Come here!

603
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:33,860
Is that them?

604
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:36,099
Yes.

605
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:39,299
Them yesterday, us today.

606
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:41,780
Climb in.

607
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:46,340
- Are things quiet on the bank?
- Yes.

608
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:49,100
See? Nothing to fear.

609
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:00,980
Why aren't we going back?

610
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,100
It's the first snow of the year.

611
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:07,940
He might still be hiding.
Waiting.

612
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,500
Jump!

613
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,220
Let's drink to--

614
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,460
May I come in, Lieutenant?

615
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:20,900
Masha?

616
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:25,820
Who were you talking to
on the road?

617
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:35,900
A friend.

618
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:44,259
Does he wear glasses?

619
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,820
He wasn't wearing glasses.

620
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:50,660
But he does! He is strange.

621
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,220
No, he isn't.

622
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:56,740
- What is it, Lieutenant?
- I've come to say good-bye.

623
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:02,380
I'm transferring her
to a hospital.

624
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:10,980
That's a good idea.

625
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:19,259
Masha!

626
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:32,260
How quiet it is, Galtsev.

627
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:34,820
Isn't it, Masha?

628
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:38,300
It's so quiet.

629
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:42,139
The war--

630
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:08,380
Victory!

631
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,340
IMPERIAL CHANCELLORY

632
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:49,740
Come closer.

633
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,380
Can you identify these bodies?

634
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:56,099
It's Goebbels,
his wife and daughters.

635
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:04,139
He poisoned his family

636
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:09,420
and ordered
his body to be burned.

637
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:24,059
He can show you the place.

638
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,380
He saw him yesterday
and talked to him.

639
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:36,100
He murdered his family
and committed suicide.

640
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,860
Won't this be the last war
on earth?

641
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:13,059
"See a doctor

642
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:16,900
about your nerves, Galtsev."

643
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:19,740
But Holin...

644
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:22,300
You were killed.

645
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:24,860
And I'm alive--

646
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:28,060
I must think of preserving peace.

647
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:34,900
Shot.

648
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:39,980
Hanged.

649
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:43,820
Shot.

650
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:48,300
Hanged.

651
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:53,820
Shot.

652
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:57,139
Shot.

653
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:06,860
Hanged.

654
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:14,219
Shot.

655
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:22,000
Hanged.
