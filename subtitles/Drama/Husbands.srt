1
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,877
Throw the way she counts.

2
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,430
One, two, three, four, nine. Here we go!

3
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,188
Come on up here
and let's finish this one over here.

4
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,315
Go!

5
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,988
I suppose this is proper,
all these big cars and chauffeurs.

6
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,358
BIack shiny cars.

7
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,754
Seems dopey for a guy Iike that.

8
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,755
Well, I guess that's what they do.

9
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,513
People get symbolic over death.
They get very formal,

10
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,591
and it's really ridiculous.

11
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,798
Because it's probably
the most humiliating thing in the world.

12
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,269
But I feel very relaxed.

13
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,349
People die of tensions.

14
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,158
That's all they die of, Gus.

15
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,470
That's the truth. Did you know that?

16
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,950
I know it, and it's something
I'm never gonna forget.

17
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,072
Don't believe truth. Just don't believe truth.

18
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,151
Archie, I'm telling you, don't believe truth.

19
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,277
That is the truth now.
You see, the truth will never kill you.

20
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,318
Lies will. Not cigarettes, not alcohol.

21
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,836
Lies, Gus. Lies and tensions.
That'II kill you.

22
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,196
That'II kill you before cancer in the heart.
Did you know that?

23
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,589
Now, give me a cigarette, will you?
Give me a cigarette.

24
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,591
-What, now?
-Yeah, now.

25
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,035
And give me a match, too.
I don't have any matches.

26
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,554
I don't know if I have a match.

27
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,870
I don't think I have a match.

28
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,113
-I don't have any.
-I don't have a match.

29
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,028
Harry!

30
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,238
You got a match?

31
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,633
Let us be grateful for the smiles.

32
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,317
Let us not think of sadness.

33
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,033
Let us bury this man
who has gone noisily through life

34
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,594
and made a quiet exit.

35
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,879
Who found time for the smallest child
and for the oldest man.

36
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,469
Who found time in his life
to make room for your lives.

37
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,319
A man who was respected
and honoured and loved

38
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,153
by the fellow members of his community.

39
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,990
When we speak of a man
that's naive and full of innocence,

40
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,799
we think naturally of Stuart Jackson.

41
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,632
I recognise some, I don't know others,
but I know one thing.

42
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,393
That you're all saddened.

43
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,156
Saddened by the loss of what
we all consider a great, great friend.

44
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,475
Not a friend in need particularly,
not a friend giving to a friend.

45
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,676
Not really there to listen,

46
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,070
but a person who made
you feel that you belonged.

47
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,756
This was a man beloved by his dear wife
and beloved by his two children,

48
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,310
who now have a great void
to fill in their lives.

49
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,833
This Stuart...

50
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,716
This Stuart, a man with so many friends,

51
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,116
as you see here today,

52
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,633
that are deeply, deeply affected by his loss.

53
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,669
Let us offer God our prayers
for his eternal soul.

54
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,834
And now a silent prayer.

55
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,590
A silent moment
to recognise Stuart Jackson.

56
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,631
I'm glad you could come.

57
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,512
I didn't Iike it.

58
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,599
I didn't Iike what he said.

59
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,399
-I'm not going home.
-It moved me, but I resent it,

60
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,789
-'cause what he said, he said nothing.
-You know what I resented?

61
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,270
-I mean, say this, just say he was funny.
-Gus, you know what I resented?

62
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,554
Say he was a funny man.

63
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,789
There's a dead man Iaying there,

64
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,314
-and she's moved, you know that.
-'Cause if you can't say the right thing

65
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,118
-when a man dies...
-But you don't talk about insurance...

66
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,269
...then what the hell is it all about?

67
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,588
Not at a time Iike that.

68
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,240
You don't talk about insurance,
you understand?

69
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,993
-Not at a funeral.
-One thing, he was a clown.

70
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,595
Say he was a clown, say he died too young,
and that's all, and that's it.

71
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,672
-You understand what I mean, Gus?
-Look, it's done!

72
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,796
It was done wrong, but it's done, so be it!

73
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,836
Well, I'm not going home.

74
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,874
So we'II...

75
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,996
I'm gonna get very drunk.

76
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,113
Whatever.

77
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,469
That's right. Your coat's seen enough.

78
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,998
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

79
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,479
-Gussie.
-Yeah.

80
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,993
-Gussie.
-What?

81
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,035
Well, what are we gonna do?

82
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,351
Well, we can do anything we wanna do.
So what do you wanna do?

83
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,910
I mean, what do you prefer to do?
I mean, if you had a preference?

84
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,354
Well, I'd be a professional athlete
because they really put out.

85
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,637
And they got no excuses,
and they feel good, and they get sweaty.

86
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,235
You know, you have a beer,
and you're with guys you Iike.

87
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,678
I was gonna be a basketball player.
I had all the moves. I was quick enough.

88
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,318
Too short.

89
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,954
I Iove baseball. I Iove golf.
I Iove pool. I Iove track.

90
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,068
I Iove Ping-Pong. I Iove volleyball.
I Iove badminton. What else is there?

91
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,030
-Football.
-Lacrosse! Now there's a hell of a game!

92
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,757
What are we gonna do?

93
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,594
Harry, you don't care.
Archie, I'd Iike to know how you feel.

94
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,070
You know, it's a terribly...
It's a terribly sad thing

95
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,992
when a man reaches around 27,
the years are going by,

96
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,039
and then he realises that he's never
gonna be a professional athlete any more.

97
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,395
And then you reach 30!

98
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,712
And then you know it's over,

99
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,075
and then you begin to watch other athletes

100
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,515
and you begin to see
when they're gonna give out.

101
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,079
-Do you ever feel that way?
-I felt that.

102
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,994
-Well, the Iegs go at 35. The Iegs.
-I got a hell of an idea.

103
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,795
Let's have a Iight breakfast.

104
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,551
You know what I mean?

105
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,958
Why a Iight breakfast?
Why not a heavy breakfast?

106
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,158
Oh, Harry...

107
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,269
-Harry, Harry, Harry.
-I'm hungry.

108
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,238
-Light breakfast.
-Everything's Iight.

109
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,911
-You get your money?
-I got everything.

110
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,833
-Okay.
-Where we going? We got 40 stops.

111
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,193
You're right.

112
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,952
Forty more stops. The man is right again.

113
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,511
I Iove basketball.

114
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,752
But I'm too short.

115
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,993
You want to play?

116
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,389
Without my shoes, I'm shorter!

117
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,709
I want to play.

118
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,034
I'II race you to the corner.
Walking, no running.

119
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,394
-For how much?
-A dime.

120
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,596
-A dime. You're on. Yeah.
-You ready?

121
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,159
-Get set!
-Get set!

122
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,389
Go!

123
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,279
Give back the ball.

124
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,473
Got it!

125
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,949
Ball!

126
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,837
Come on. Come on, Harry.

127
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,269
Come on, Harry. Put it up.

128
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,872
I hate basketball.

129
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,437
And besides, I have a theory
about people who play to win.

130
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,990
It's the only reason to play.
Otherwise why keep score?

131
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,958
First, we have to play games,
then we have to see who wins.

132
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,758
We've been up for 24 hours.

133
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,149
And we're gonna get ourselves
the same as Stuart.

134
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,800
It's good for you. Sweat it all out.

135
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,475
-Wanna go home, Harry?
-No!

136
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,590
I'm never going home.

137
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,475
AII right, then. Let's have a drink.

138
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,869
-Here's to Joe. Here's to Joe.
-Here's to Joe.

139
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,837
-Joe.
-Here's to Joe.

140
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,909
To Joe.

141
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,519
To Joe.

142
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,878
AII right, next.

143
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,472
Charlie?

144
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,272
I'm not any Joe, but...
Maybe the original soul...

145
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,431
-I'm sorry.
-AII right, next.

146
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,114
Okay. That was terrific. I'm sorry.

147
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,236
Gus, you broke the rules.

148
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,637
-Who's next?
-Gotta keep the rules. No talking.

149
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,596
-Tony, Tony's next.
-No, Gwen.

150
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,274
-Gwen.
-Gwen is next. Gwen, you go.

151
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,272
Look at me! That's better.

152
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,555
Don't know any more.

153
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,915
Give her a hand. Let's have a drink.

154
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,356
Terrific. Terrific. Terrific.

155
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,634
Okay.

156
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,678
-We're terrific.
-Terrific.

157
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,198
-Who's next?
-He's next.

158
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,191
No, no, Iadies first.

159
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,190
Now, this is First World War.

160
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,995
Wonderful. Wonderful.

161
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,553
-AII right.
-Leola.

162
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,279
-AII right. Who's next?
-My Leola's next.

163
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,636
-Who's next? Who's next?
-No, no, Iadies first. Leola.

164
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,789
Well, go ahead, John.

165
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,233
-PIease. PIease. John.
-Go, John.

166
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,435
Go, John.

167
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,199
I Iove it.

168
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,632
I Iove it.

169
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,552
I'd Iike to hear that one again.
Can I hear that one again?

170
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,076
Bill was all right, but...
I mean, I have nothing against Bill.

171
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,280
It's just that I have a song that means,
well, it takes Iife.

172
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,955
You'II see what I mean.

173
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,598
It means Iife.

174
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,636
Shut up, Gus, shut up.

175
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,519
Shut up, Gus!

176
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,312
Shut up, you moron.

177
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,114
Bravo!

178
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,472
Let's drink to that.

179
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,549
Come on...

180
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,992
You're an angel.

181
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,278
Okay. AII right.

182
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,993
You're right. You know something?
She felt a rejection. Let's sit down.

183
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,513
Hold it here. Here, here, here.

184
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,750
-Violence is out.
-Sit down.

185
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,990
-Wait a minute...
-Violence is out.

186
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,073
This contest is not over.
And this contest is going to continue.

187
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,153
Look, just to show you
how wild this party is...

188
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,879
-Who threw that glass?
-Wait a minute.

189
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,396
Number one, who threw that glass?
I'm gonna Ieave here.

190
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,471
I'm gonna Ieave here.

191
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,159
Leola!

192
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,952
Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.

193
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,271
Unreal, unreal! No passion.

194
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,115
One more time. One more time.

195
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,679
Start it again.

196
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,751
Gus, do you hear, Gus?

197
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,191
-Start it again, honestly.
-Honestly.

198
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,589
-Honestly, but I had too much beer.
-With soul. Soul.

199
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,352
-Soul?
-With soul.

200
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,430
-With passion.
-That's what Harry does all the time.

201
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,918
I don't believe he does that.

202
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,353
The man is insane!

203
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,159
-I'm telling you...
-From the beginning.

204
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,479
-Did you hear what he said?
-Worse.

205
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,793
-Did you hear what he said?
-Worse.

206
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,438
-What?
-Worse!

207
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,912
No feeling, he said.

208
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,236
-Vomit.
-No feeling.

209
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,998
A Iittle feeling. A Iittle feeling.

210
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,030
-I don't care. Loud, soft, do it.
-Go get her, Archie.

211
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,118
No, too cute! Too cute!

212
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,399
No cute! Real, from the heart!
From the heart! From the heart!

213
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,878
I can't stand it! I can't stand it!

214
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,599
-I'II kill myself.
-He's right. This man is right.

215
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,033
The man is right.

216
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,271
When the man is right, he's right.
One more time.

217
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,158
It's not that we're criticising you.

218
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,753
-It's that...
-We're criticising you.

219
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,071
Whatever your Iife is, it's been...

220
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,718
-Obviously.
-You're not speaking to us.

221
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,916
Do you understand?
You're not speaking to us.

222
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,956
-No?
-You're not talking to all these people.

223
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,996
-Look at...
-You're not speaking to anybody.

224
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,513
Not only us.

225
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,639
I agree.

226
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,237
I agree. I agree.

227
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,549
I agree. Wait a minute.

228
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,551
-Get him.
-You are terrible!

229
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,952
You are impossible! You're wrong!
You have no heart!

230
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,712
-You're wrong.
-No.

231
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,712
A Iot of people won't agree with this,
but I think you're terrible.

232
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,631
-Really?
-I think you're terrible.

233
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,948
-You know why?
-Terrible!

234
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,270
'Cause you wanna be terrible.
You know why?

235
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,749
-'Cause you don't Iike us. You know why?
-Right. Right.

236
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,671
Because you got some
bitterness in your heart...

237
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,796
-Totally.
-...'cause you've been told by your mother...

238
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,269
-Where's the warmth? Where's the warmth?
-...to be that way.

239
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,078
-Where is the warmth?
-Give us a kiss.

240
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,196
-Right.
-Kiss him, he's my friend!

241
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,989
Here, here's a face, kiss him. Suck him.

242
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,799
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it, Archie.

243
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,598
-Don't do that again.
-No, I...

244
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,717
Don't do it again. Ever. Ever!

245
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,155
-One more time.
-Do it better.

246
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,639
-Do it better.
-One more time.

247
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,914
Would you do it better?

248
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,638
-Can you do it better?
-We Iove you!

249
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,029
I'II take off my clothes if you do it better.

250
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,314
-Take off your clothes.
-Take off your clothes.

251
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,550
-I'II take off my clothes if you do it better.
-Take off...

252
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,518
-If you do it better. Give her a chance.
-Take off your clothes.

253
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,397
-Give her a chance.
-Wait a minute.

254
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,914
I'II take off my clothes if you do it better.

255
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,558
-That's how much I want it.
-Take off your clothes.

256
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,073
No, I don't want you to take off your clothes.

257
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,312
I'II take off my clothes.
Here they come, baby. Here they come!

258
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,119
Here they come! Here they come!

259
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,317
Now, do it better! Now, do it better!

260
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,153
He's drunk.

261
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,714
You know, you guys Iook terrible.

262
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,356
I have such pains and heat here.

263
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,752
Suffocating! My eyes are tearing.

264
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,478
I get the feeling you want to be alone.

265
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,075
So, why do I get the feeling
that you want to be alone?

266
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,913
At first, there were four of us.

267
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,629
And now there are three of us,
and you want to be alone.

268
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,119
AII right.

269
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,560
Then I might as well be alone.

270
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,473
Wonderful. Wonderful.

271
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,553
Wonderful.

272
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,918
Gus, I feel sick.

273
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,950
And I don't Iike to be sick in front of people.

274
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,271
I mean, people barging in on you
when you're sick...

275
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,709
-I agree with you.
-I asked you not to say anything.

276
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,995
Now, you're either going to be quiet,
or you're gonna go.

277
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,593
-Okay?
-Okay.

278
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,638
Gus, nothing! Silence!

279
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,473
Silence?

280
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,035
-Boy, I feel Iike screaming.
-I don't care what you feel. I don't care...

281
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,554
I want to tell you how I feel!

282
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,234
Listen, Gus. Gus,

283
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,070
I want to tell you how I really feel.

284
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,752
I mean, I want to tell you
what's really bothering me.

285
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,195
I'm going to tell you now what it is.

286
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,989
What it must be. 'Cause it's
not the sickness. I can Iive with that.

287
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,911
No, here's what it is.

288
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,790
It's a tremendous need.

289
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,030
An anxiety. It's a...

290
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,477
You see, that's what happens.
I forget what it is.

291
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,872
I mean, what is it?
It's got to be important. Right?

292
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,677
'Cause, well, Iike, what are you feeling?

293
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,513
I mean, what are we supposed to be feeling?

294
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,670
'Cause what I'm feeling...

295
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,593
I don't know what I'm feeling!
You see what I mean?

296
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,477
In other words...

297
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,072
You see, it's...

298
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,039
I've got to find out
because I know what it is.

299
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,192
No, no, it's a...

300
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,398
-There's a need there. And there's anxiety.
-It's guilt.

301
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,391
-Guilt?
-Guilt.

302
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,469
Guilt?

303
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,309
-That would be terrible.
-It's terrible.

304
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,960
God, oh, God. God.

305
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,549
-That would be terrible.
-What is it? Just say what it is.

306
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,200
-I'm not gonna say it. It's not that.
-Just say, "I'm guilty," that's all.

307
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,875
I never had bad thoughts.
I swear to God I never had a bad thought.

308
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,077
If I died yesterday, I'm clean.
Gus, I'm an idealist.

309
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,913
-I'm a positive person. I mean, as Iong as...
-You're an idealist, you are.

310
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,672
As Iong as you've known me,

311
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,432
I've always tried to see
the good side of everything.

312
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,954
I mean, whenever possible, is that right?

313
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,713
You want to be alone?
You want to be alone?

314
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,673
Be alone!

315
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,510
-Let the dead Iie.
-Let the dead Iie?

316
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,672
-Let the dead Iie!
-Let it go.

317
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,954
It's a proper thought.

318
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,678
No, it isn't.

319
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,559
What a smell!

320
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,876
What a terrible smell.

321
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,190
I really hate it. I hate vomit.

322
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,158
You get all the blood out of it,
just disgusting.

323
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,071
-Hey, you got something on your mouth.
-Just disgusting.

324
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,196
Right there.

325
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,953
Right there, right there, right there!
Right there!

326
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,431
Get me a paper! I know it's there.
Get me some paper! Hand me the paper!

327
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,317
Got something on your foot!
You got something on your foot there!

328
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,550
You got something on your foot there, too!

329
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,553
You got something on that foot there!
Right there! Right there.

330
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,879
Right there.

331
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,476
Come here. Come over here.

332
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,234
Come over here.

333
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,431
Oh, you stink. Oh, you stink.

334
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,557
Oh, that silly son of a bitch is on the door.

335
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,829
I feel very good. Very good.

336
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,874
-What are you guys doing in here?
-Having a private moment.

337
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,675
-Private moment about what?
-About Stuart.

338
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,195
About Stuart? Expect me to believe that?

339
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,119
Every time my back is turned
you guys are whispering about...

340
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,749
Every time my back is turned
you guys are talking. Talking.

341
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,671
Whispering about me.

342
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,557
-Are you kidding?
-Talking behind my back.

343
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,030
I've been onto you for a Iong time.
I just have too much class to spell it out!

344
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,509
-Why don't you spell it out?
-I could never talk to you.

345
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,192
-You're insensitive!
-I'm insensitive?

346
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,191
-And you're insensitive!
-I'm insensitive?

347
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,192
You're sensitive? You can't even vomit.

348
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,992
Make your point.

349
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,312
Harry. You get to work on time.
You fawn over your wife.

350
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,473
You're absorbed by yourself
and you have no sense of humour.

351
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,310
I have no sense of humour?

352
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,796
I have no sense of humour?

353
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,834
I have no sense of humour?

354
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,478
You're clutching at straws.
You have nothing.

355
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,109
If I said what was really on my mind,
you'd be crying.

356
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,760
-Say it.
-Harry, you're a phoney.

357
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,192
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

358
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,478
I'm a phoney? I'm a phoney?
Nobody calls me a phoney!

359
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,313
Bite his finger! Bite his finger!

360
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,198
I'm a phoney, huh? I'm a phoney?

361
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,558
No! Nobody calls me a phoney!
Nobody calls me a phoney!

362
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,791
No! Nobody calls me a phoney!

363
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,758
-No, nobody calls me a phoney!
-Good friends don't fight! Good friends...

364
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,717
-Nobody!
-Come here.

365
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,949
Come on. Hey, Archie, come here.
Shake hands!

366
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,950
Come on, now, shake hands!

367
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,671
Give me a dime, Archie.

368
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,588
Harry, I'II not only give you a dime,
I'II give you my Iife.

369
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,875
Now, you want a dime, you got a dime.

370
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,439
Give it to me.

371
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,036
He won't call her.

372
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,315
I'II call my wife
and tell her about my friends.

373
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,279
What did you do, darling? Went to a funeral.
How was it? Marvellous!

374
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,749
How's that for a two-day venture?

375
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,636
What's my number? I forgot my number.
Gus, what's my number?

376
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,755
Seven, four, three, two...

377
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,879
I know it. I know it. Seven, four, what?
Seven, four, three, what?

378
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,396
-Seven, four, three...
-I know it! I know it. I know it.

379
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,675
Loved the answer. "I know it."

380
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,153
Give me a beer.

381
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,233
God damn!

382
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,715
You guys going to work today?

383
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,519
Gus?

384
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,477
You going to work today?

385
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,917
I don't know, Harry.

386
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,158
-Archie?
-I'm thinking about it.

387
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,912
Louder! I can never hear you!

388
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,991
Harry, I said I was thinking about it!

389
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,798
-Are you going to work today?
-I'm thinking about it.

390
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,919
Well, I'm going to work today!
I'm going to go right home and go to work.

391
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,037
-You know, you've got an awful Iot to Iearn.
-Let's go home. Gus.

392
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,509
You know absolutely nothing about people.

393
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,589
Arch.

394
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,194
You know you screwed up tonight.

395
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,838
-What do you want?
-Let's go.

396
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,433
I don't know why I bother with you anyway.

397
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:31,036
I hate this man. I hate him. I really hate him.

398
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,997
Let's get out of here.

399
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,315
Gus, Archie,

400
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,080
Iook what I did to the phone booth.

401
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,550
I kicked the hell out of it.

402
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,669
Yeah.

403
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,468
Like I've been telling my wife for years.

404
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,870
Aside from sex, and she's very good at it,

405
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,396
God damn it, I Iike you guys better.

406
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,353
I really do. Now, who the hell else
could put up with me, huh?

407
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,396
I'm a jerk. I know it.

408
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,559
So Iet's go home and get it over with.

409
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,874
Gus,

410
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,073
I Iove you.

411
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,908
Archie...

412
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,032
-Don't do that to me, I'II kill you!
-I could kiss you on the mouth.

413
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,470
I Iove you. I Iove you both.

414
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,676
-Get away from me.
-Now, Iet's go home and get it over with.

415
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,079
You fairy!

416
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,313
Fairy Harry!

417
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,591
I wouldn't be surprised!

418
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,637
Might be better off!

419
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,950
-You're amazing!
-He's amazing!

420
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,632
You are amazing!

421
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,554
I know.

422
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,109
What do you want us to do?
You want us to go home with you?

423
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,438
-Let's go home.
-Let's go home.

424
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,715
We'II never make the 8:02.
We're Iate. We got 10 minutes.

425
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,874
Shave, shower, 10 minutes!

426
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,633
Let the cab go! We'II take my car.

427
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,040
That's the difference between him and us.

428
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,352
If my wife opens her mouth to me
about anything, I finish that fast.

429
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,434
-You're right.
-I walk right in there... I know I'm right.

430
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,398
And I spell it out.
And that's what you have to do.

431
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,999
Right, that's what you have to do.

432
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,638
I'm not going to shower for her.

433
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,359
If I want to stink, I'II stink.
That's my privilege,

434
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,351
-and I'm not showering for him.
-Right.

435
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,829
-I wouldn't shower for you.
-Don't.

436
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,478
-I'm not going to shave, either.
-Don't shave.

437
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,437
If I want to be dirty, I'II be dirty.

438
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,432
Look, if you want to be dirty, you be dirty.
You go ahead and be dirty.

439
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,717
You have to be free.
You have to be an individual.

440
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,993
Where is she?

441
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,998
Tell her I'm sorry.

442
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,594
Tell her I'II talk to her tonight.

443
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,710
-Tell her I Iove her.
-AII right, Harry, I'II tell her.

444
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,949
I Iove you, too.

445
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,634
-You're a bad boy.
-I'm not a bad boy!

446
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,554
You understand me.

447
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,791
If she wasn't your daughter,
you'd be on my side.

448
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,394
I'm not allowed to say anything.

449
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,869
AII right, don't say anything.
Who the hell asked you to say anything?

450
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,552
-Don't say anything.
-I didn't say anything!

451
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,359
Then don't! I know what side you're on.

452
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,591
Just say goodbye for me.

453
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,109
Yeah.

454
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,594
Terrible.

455
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,711
No sensitivity Ieft.

456
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,634
You wanna be alone,
you can't even be alone in your own house.

457
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,834
Look, you don't have to
hide from me any more.

458
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,911
I know you don't Iove me.

459
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,594
I just don't Iike being in a closet.

460
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,072
So Iet's end the suspense.

461
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,279
-You know how I feel.
-Tell me.

462
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,157
I don't want a scene.

463
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,392
What about the children?
We have three children.

464
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,916
They'II do just fine.
Mother! Mother, sit down!

465
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,989
Look,

466
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,238
I Iove you, and I Iove the children.

467
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,517
I'm telling you that
right in front of your mother.

468
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,878
I just...

469
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,831
I'm just uncomfortable in front of you.
That's it.

470
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,911
There's nothing personal.

471
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,518
Nothing personal.

472
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,839
Harry...

473
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,071
I just can't stand you.

474
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,152
-Annie!
-You stay out of this!

475
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,037
You stay out of this!

476
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,192
Stay out of this.

477
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,790
Annie. Annie.

478
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,552
-Ma, get the knife.
-Annie.

479
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,358
-I'II kill him!
-Give me that knife.

480
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,876
Give me that knife! Give me that knife!
Give it to me!

481
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,831
-Down on your knees. Down on your knees.
-No.

482
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,593
Down on your knees. Down on your knees!

483
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,475
Now, I'm calm. I'm very calm.

484
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,313
You Iove me?

485
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,713
Say you Iove... Say you Iove...

486
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,438
Just say you Iove good old Harry.

487
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,432
You Iove Harry, don't you?
Poor working stiff.

488
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,715
You Iove me. Say you Iove me.

489
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,632
Say you Iove me!

490
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,874
Say it!

491
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,233
I Iove you.

492
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,717
-Again.
-I Iove you.

493
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,798
That's better. That's not so hard, is it?

494
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,118
I Iove you, too.

495
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,276
-I'm gonna call the police on him.
-Annie.

496
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,396
I'II kill him.

497
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,392
-I'm gonna call the police on him.
-You'II call the police?

498
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,755
You're going to call the police?

499
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,796
I know how to get to you.

500
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,154
-I know how to get to you.
-Oh, Harry! Harry!

501
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,754
-I know how to get to you!
-Don't you hurt my mother!

502
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,435
Shut up! Shut up! Get away from me!

503
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,035
-Hey, hey!
-You satisfied? You satisfied?

504
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,117
I'II kill her! I'II kill her!

505
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,395
I'II kill her! I'II kill her!

506
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,758
I'II kill her!

507
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,189
-Open the door!
-I'II kill her! I'II kill her!

508
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,952
-Open the door.
-I'm a funny guy, right?

509
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,792
Yeah, yeah, come on!

510
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,989
AII right. AII right.

511
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,279
I'm freezing.

512
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,718
Must be emotional.

513
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,351
I must be going nuts.

514
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,638
I hate that house.

515
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,313
I only Iived there because of a woman.

516
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,312
You know. The Iegs, the breasts, the mouth.

517
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,155
Well,

518
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,035
not any more. No, sir.

519
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,433
Gus. Archie.

520
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,515
I'm confused, I tell you.

521
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,994
Because I know I'm going
to go in that house

522
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,638
and I know I'm not going
to go in that house,

523
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,837
because if I go in that house,
I'II only say I'm sorry.

524
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,388
So that's it. I'm going away.

525
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,038
I got...

526
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,839
This and this is...

527
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,554
You had a Iot of hair then, Harry.

528
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,949
I got older. She gets younger.

529
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,114
They all get younger. You get older.

530
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,476
Well, that's it.
I'II go to Africa, Russia, China!

531
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,512
I don't care. I don't care.

532
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,276
You're not the first guy
to ever punch his wife out.

533
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,197
-Here he goes again.
-I have to agree with him.

534
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,514
-You going to start?
-Listen, you worry about your family,

535
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,034
we worry about our family.
That's the way it is.

536
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,872
Well, what's wrong with that?

537
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,794
Well, you're not worried about our family
when you go on Iike that because...

538
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,029
You're going to put me down again, right?

539
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,396
-We have our problems, Harry.
-AII right, I get it. I get it.

540
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,471
-I know who my friends are.
-It's not all one way, you know!

541
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,755
-I'II just go to work and think it over!
-Wait a minute.

542
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,957
-I'II go to work and think it over, that's all.
-Wait a minute. Wait!

543
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,635
I'm going to work!
You want to go to work? I'II drive you.

544
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,073
-Are you going to work?
-Harry.

545
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,071
-Archie.
-I'II get in the car with you.

546
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,276
After that, I don't know,
because you can be violent.

547
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,909
-Okay, that's all I ask.
-Harry, you're a fantastic man...

548
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,675
You guys smell, you know that?

549
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,474
How can you go to work Iike that?

550
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:49,275
You put your fingers in people's mouths
all day Iong. Look at your fingernails.

551
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,716
You were right there.
Shave, take a shower, something!

552
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,358
Change your underwear!

553
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,829
We don't Iike your underwear.

554
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,196
Your underwear.
What is that, Bahama underwear you got?

555
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,429
Child.

556
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,279
Children.

557
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,552
Will you cut it out?

558
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,631
Oh, just cut it out.

559
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,155
Just cut it out. I'm in no mood.

560
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,389
-Listen...
-Lay off!

561
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,357
-Harry!
-I'm warning you, Iay off!

562
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,078
Harry, Iisten.

563
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,631
Now, get away from me!

564
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,036
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

565
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,590
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
-Look, what are you, an idiot?

566
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,796
What are you, an idiot? Wait a...

567
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,312
Get your hands off!

568
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,834
Doctor will be with you in just a minute.

569
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,514
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

570
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,192
Archie, Iisten to me.

571
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,397
I'm either going to change him into me,
or I'm going to change him into...

572
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,072
I don't know what
I'm going to change him into.

573
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,390
His basic problem... Listen to this.

574
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,914
He went into the house this morning
because he was supposed to.

575
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,877
I can't put my finger
on what's wrong with that.

576
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,916
-That's wrong. Right?
-Damn right, it's wrong.

577
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,877
-Right.
-It's everything. It's the way he walks,

578
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,679
the way he dresses, what he thinks,
what he doesn't think.

579
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,228
It's deeper than that.
He's going through a change of Iife.

580
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,312
-Listen to me! I've watched him all week...
-I have no time, Archie, I'm...

581
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,833
He's definitely going through
a change of Iife.

582
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,879
-Could you just hold it one second?
-Yeah, but think about that, would you?

583
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,393
Tray, please.

584
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,715
-Hello.
-Hello. You saw my x-rays Iast Tuesday.

585
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,314
-They took x-rays.
-Yeah, I saw that.

586
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,710
I'm very nervous. I hate dentists.
Did Harry tell you that?

587
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,199
No, we didn't get around to that yet.

588
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,477
You see, once I went to a dentist,
and he hurt me.

589
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:36,756
I think I'm allergic to Novocain.
I think so, you know?

590
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,755
You know, I hate needles and drills,
you know? You don't give a gas, do you?

591
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,876
No, I really don't know what you're saying.
Just open, please.

592
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,235
I just want to check your gums.

593
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,994
Something wrong, is there?

594
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,594
Miss Hines, Miss Hines, what's the matter?

595
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,797
I'm sorry, I'm so nervous.
I can't stop Iaughing.

596
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,160
Let the doctor check you, Miss Hines.

597
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,357
Let the doctor check you, Miss Hines. Relax.

598
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,591
I don't want him to do anything.
I want to be Iike this.

599
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,319
I'm making an ass out of myself.
I told myself that I wouldn't...

600
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,234
Look, just open a minute. Hold it, darling.
Darling, darling.

601
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,711
Take it easy now. I feel...

602
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,554
AII right, just open now. Just say...
Nice and gentle.

603
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,188
-I'm awfully sorry. I didn't mean...
-That's okay, just open, please.

604
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,589
Open, open. Say "ah."

605
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:35,469
That's nice. You're in nice shape.

606
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,838
Yeah? Are you sure?
I mean, there's nothing really wrong?

607
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,753
-Just open...
-I can't stand this any more.

608
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,593
I got to go.

609
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,390
-I got to go, Gus!
-CIose your mouth for a minute. Okay.

610
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,119
Just one second. I can't stand it, either.

611
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,913
Hello?

612
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,594
-Harry, it's for you. It's Archie and Gus.
-Can't talk.

613
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,716
Oh, your secretary has it.

614
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,949
-It's Mr BIack and Gus to meet you.
-I told you to take a message.

615
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,036
-But they said it's very important.
-I can't talk to them.

616
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,918
-They're on their way over to see...
-Tell them not to come.

617
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,877
Tell them I'm busy.
I'm a man of responsibilities.

618
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,997
Tell them I'm a man who is responsible.
I'm not a bum.

619
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,798
And no more calls!

620
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,795
Since when is it your product
is supposed to make ours...

621
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,636
-Harry!
-Hi, Harry.

622
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,508
-Harry!
-Ed Weintraub.

623
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:23,118
Oh, Harry! The times we had together,
weren't they wonderful, huh?

624
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,673
-Wonderful, wonderful.
-Yeah, they're good.

625
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,273
Where should we go to?

626
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,713
-I don't know...
-Let's go!

627
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,995
Right this way, Mr Weintraub.

628
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,510
-You guys going with me or not?
-Where? Where you going?

629
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,431
London. London, England.

630
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,033
London, England.

631
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,311
London. London, England.

632
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,310
Come on, Harry, you're not...

633
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,914
The hell with you. I don't need you.

634
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,111
You're being serious.

635
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,908
-You're a jerk, right?
-Right!

636
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,389
-I'm a jerk, right? You're a jerk, right?
-Yeah, yeah!

637
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,710
I'm going to London.

638
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,279
-I'm going to London.
-You're going to London?

639
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,510
-I'm going to London.
-Well, if you're going to London

640
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,033
and you're going to London,
I'm going to London.

641
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,189
Okay.

642
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,633
AII right, you know what we do
with this jerk?

643
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,597
-We take him to London, right?
-Right.

644
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,399
We take him to London,
we take him to a hotel,

645
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,516
we tuck him in,
and then we come back home.

646
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,192
-That's all right.
-Let's call our wives.

647
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,269
AII right.

648
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,599
Hello, Jeanie?

649
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,590
It's your Golden Greek.

650
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,275
This is your sweet potato.

651
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,268
You're sore at me, aren't you, huh?

652
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,754
No...

653
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,437
We're going to go away with him.
We're going to go to London with him.

654
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,990
Yeah, we're just going to tuck him in bed,
and get him into a hotel,

655
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,833
and then we're going to come right back.

656
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,920
There is no problem, it's just that,

657
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,913
sweetheart, we need our passports.

658
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,197
Yeah, Archie and I,
we don't have the passports.

659
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,955
You know where my passport is?

660
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,675
Well, will you go...

661
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,799
Will you go over to Archie's house
and ask Kate for his passport?

662
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,233
Oh, I Iove you.

663
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,196
Yeah, you're terrific.
Yeah, you're really terrific.

664
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,111
Yeah, I Iove you, too.

665
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,353
Jealous.

666
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,919
Can you imagine that?

667
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,275
AII the women are around me
in my office all day Iong,

668
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:50,638
she's jealous over some foreign country
I've never been to before.

669
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,758
-I'm very excited.
-So am I.

670
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,596
Why do you Iook so worried?

671
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,318
I'm not worried.

672
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,996
That's good
because we're in the middle of the ocean.

673
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,839
No sense in being worried
in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, right?

674
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,319
Right.

675
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,277
-How are you, Archie?
-Good.

676
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,429
Thank you. I had a wonderful flight.

677
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,034
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

678
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,149
Goodbye.

679
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:02,471
-Thank you.
-Goodbye. Thank you for flying Pan Am.

680
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,314
Goodbye. Hope you had a nice flight.

681
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,672
Goodbye, sir. Hope you had a nice flight.

682
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,872
Goodbye now, sir.

683
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,159
Goodbye, sir.

684
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,549
Wet!

685
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,514
You have a connecting door, sir,
but we'II have to go around.

686
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,592
-Everything all right, gentlemen?
-What?

687
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,033
-What?
-Is what's all right?

688
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,475
Excuse me, please. This way, sir.

689
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,237
I'II take this one.

690
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,477
-American money all right?
-Yes, sir.

691
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,118
-There you go.
-Thank you very much, sir.

692
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,952
-There you go.
-Thank you, sir. Good day, sir.

693
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,519
-Oh, the key.
-Have a good day, sir.

694
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,477
Look at the bathroom.

695
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,751
I Iike your room, Arch.

696
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,192
Look at the rain.

697
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,316
It rains a Iot in London.

698
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,798
I Iike the rain.

699
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,117
Let's take a shower.

700
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,710
Let's take a shower and get some sleep,

701
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,268
and then we'II order some clothes
and get some clothes...

702
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,750
That's right. That's right. We'II take
an hour's nap. AII I need is an hour.

703
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,955
We need some clothes.

704
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,871
I sleep an hour, I feel Iike I slept 12.

705
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,155
-Oh, boy.
-Rain is fantastic.

706
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,277
-Then we get some women.
-We need some sleep.

707
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,834
Harry, my wife is not so good in bed.
Maybe that's the answer.

708
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,357
I mean, I don't enjoy it that much.
I'm very slow.

709
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,312
Well, maybe that's the answer.

710
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,231
May I ask a question?

711
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,910
What does that mean, slow?

712
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:08,833
He's saying you're great in bed,
and he stinks in bed, is that right?

713
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:11,115
-Archie!
-I never said that.

714
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,199
-I don't care.
-He doesn't care.

715
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,349
If I cared, I wouldn't have any.

716
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:18,319
I don't care either,
because there's going to be no more talk.

717
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,192
Go out and get it.

718
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,273
Is that wrong?

719
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,113
Oh, my God.

720
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,154
My arm.

721
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,313
Oh, my God.

722
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,840
There's a cab. Come on. Here we go.

723
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,597
-Come on in.
-It's England.

724
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,079
It's England.

725
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,832
We're in England.

726
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,155
-Good evening, gentlemen.
-Good evening.

727
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,437
-Do you wish to play?
-Yes, we'd Iike to play craps.

728
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,558
-You have craps here?
-We got craps. Got everything.

729
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,198
-AII right, that's what we Iike.
-We need chips.

730
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:17,192
-Chips, right. Get some chips, that's all.
-The cashier can help you there, sir.

731
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,599
Thank you.

732
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:23,274
-We only have American money.
-I see. Can I have it, please?

733
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,909
-What?
-Can I have it, please?

734
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,797
Give him the money.

735
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,674
But we're running Iow on cash.
Traveller's cheques all right?

736
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,239
Traveller's cheques, American.

737
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,038
Can I see your passport, sir?

738
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,348
Just a formality, sir.

739
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,839
Show him the passport, Harry.
We've got passports.

740
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,717
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
everything all right here?

741
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,711
-Everything's all right.
-That's very good, sir. Thank you.

742
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,915
-$200 all right?
-$200?

743
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,309
Yes, sir. Would you sign, please?

744
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,159
Here you are, sir. $200.

745
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,629
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Thank you very much, sir. Thank you.

746
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,551
It's your fault we came to London, right?

747
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,596
Harry, come on, what about our chips?

748
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,716
We're not, you know, we're not alone here.
Everybody's together.

749
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,075
Come on, Gus. Gus, come on.

750
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,718
Get your chips.

751
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,030
-What'II we play?
-Wait for Gus. Come on.

752
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,872
-Craps?
-What do you mean, come on? I'm here.

753
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,234
Craps?

754
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,799
-Craps, right.
-Right.

755
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,552
Good game, gents. Your roll.

756
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,517
Go ahead. Shillings.

757
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,110
-Your dice.
-Right.

758
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,633
-Your dice.
-I'm not shooting.

759
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,632
He shoots. I'm the brains. I shoot.

760
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,359
You're the brains. Gus, Gus, Gus!

761
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,317
Five on the win.

762
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,392
-Gus!
-First time in London. Let's go.

763
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:32,912
-Here we go! Here we go!
-That's the way to start.

764
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,195
-Press the seven.
-Bet eleven, shooter coming in.

765
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,271
-We're new here.
-That's not the way to bet.

766
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:40,113
You'II see. Ten a point.

767
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,758
-Now, you have to press.
-I got no money to press.

768
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,558
Bet it hard now, gents. 2-to-1 odds.

769
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,949

01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,473
-Cover the field.
-No bets over there.

772
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,198
No place bets.

773
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,196
-Point's 10, shooter.
-I know the game.

774
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,679
You know the game.

775
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,228
-Don't Iisten to him next time.
-Rolling numbers here.

776
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,231
-Go get them, Gus.
-Right back, that's the 10, honey.

777
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,435

783
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:18,435

784
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,714
you need some to put
on the back of the Iine.

785
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,631
-Hold it.
-Discuss it with him, come on.

786
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,836
-Your roll now coming out.
-Now, he gets 4 for that.

787
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,480
-Can you take off your coat here?
-Yes, sir. It's off on the come-out roll.

788
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,437
-What?
-Off on the come-out roll.

789
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,671
Off on the come-out.
Yes, yes, any joint will tell you that.

790
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,796
-It's automatically off on the come-out roll.
-Here we go there!

791
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,838
Five hits, five pay Iine. Shake five, shooter.

792
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,598
Go get them, Gus. Come on.

793
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,989
AII right, Gus. AII right.

794
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,517
That's right, yeah.

795
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,515
-Throw.
-You almost gave me a heart attack.

796
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,999
Throw!

797
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,116
-Five right back. Look at this!
-Five a winner.

798
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,553
Five a winner. Five a winner.

799
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,313
-Fairy Harry!
-We're off! Fairy Harry anything!

800
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,517
-Five.
-Crap. Press it. That's the number.

801
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,830
Fairy Harry, where are you?

802
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,309
-AII right.
-Let's not Iose our composure.

803
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,029
You won't get angry with me
if we walk away with your club?

804
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,671
-What's the name of this club?
-Sportsmen's.

805
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,593
Sportsmen's! Sportsmen's! Go, Gussie!

806
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,069
If we're making too much noise for you,
just Iet us know.

807
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,195
That's all right, sir. We roll.

808
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,633
I don't think they know we're American.

809
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,756
-Here we go.
-You have no courage.

810
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,115
-You have no courage.
-You don't need courage with Gus.

811
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,111
You don't need courage with Gus,
you need money.

812
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,235
Nine.

813
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,311
-Press the nine.
-Better.

814
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,152
The point is nine. The point is nine.

815
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,676
Back up the bet with the nine.
Put it on the six. Here.

816
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:36,036
And the four, and the five,
and the eight, and the ten.

817
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,156
-Give me the ten, the nine.
-Don't get excited!

818
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,275
Attaboy, Archie.

819
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,475
They never saw so much money
in their Iives.

820
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,393
-Live dangerously.
-Here we go. The rich Americans strike back.

821
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,469
Nine a winner.

822
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,996
-Nine is the winner.
-Yes, sir! Yes, sir, yes, sir!

823
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,430
-What a country! It's a great country!
-Told you!

824
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,350
Eight. Press the eight.

825
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,474
-We roll nothing but numbers.
-Hold the dice, Gus.

826
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,233
You remember Paris, do you, sweetheart?

827
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,832
-Nine. A field nine.
-Press the nine.

828
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:13,072
Press the nine.
The whole art to this game is the numbers!

829
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,754
-You're right, I'm with you.
-Not this.

830
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,794
-Come on, baby! Ten.
-Press the ten.

831
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:24,351
-Press the ten.
-Look at this man roll numbers! Numbers!

832
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:25,869
Go!

833
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,038
Go. Let him roll. Quiet.
May we have quiet, please?

834
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,350
Wait a minute, what's the number?

835
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,716
It's all ours. It's all ours. Send them out!

836
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,119
Let him place...

837
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,792
-Here we go. Eight again.
-Ten, one time.

838
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:41,156
Seven out, Iose seven. We're on our way.
Take your nut. The Iast time was a winner.

839
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,714
AII right, that's it.
Come on, we'II get a drink.

840
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,074
Thank you very much. Let's go.

841
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,549
That's for you. That's for you.

842
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,870
That is for you, sir. And that is for you, sir.

843
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,996
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

844
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,914
We're Iovers. We don't need money.

845
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,839
Harry. Harry.

846
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,871
-Come on, we're all together. Wait for Gus.
-Come on, Iet's go.

847
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,270
-Gus, come on. Come on. Get your chips.
-Come on.

848
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,679
Let's go.

849
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,079
-Pardon me.
-Gus.

850
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,630
-Nineteen, thirteen.
-Card.

851
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,278
-Fifteen.
-Card.

852
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,117
-Hello.
-Good evening.

853
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,428
-What's your Iimit?
-100, sir.

854
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,953
-Fifteen.
-Card.

855
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,270
-100.
-Twenty-one, seventeen.

856
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,470
-A marker, please.
-10 marker?

857
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,709
Yeah.

858
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,237
-Sixteen.
-Hello.

859
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,754
-Nineteen, thirteen.
-Card.

860
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,159
Nineteen.

861
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:01,399
You know, the English... People tell you
the English are cold and reserved.

862
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,629
I really Iike them.
I mean, they're warm. They're giving.

863
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:08,959
They give.

864
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,356
At Ieast, I hope they give.

865
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,718
Know what I mean?

866
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:22,078
-Here.
-Too Iate, sir.

867
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,991
-Fourteen.
-Card.

868
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:27,550
Well, you keep them here then,
and if you win, I win.

869
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,634
I'd rather you played for me anyway.

870
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,517
That's why I don't have any
of those masculine pretensions, you know,

871
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:45,390
that the man has to run things.
I don't believe that's necessarily true.

872
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,391
If a woman has a brain,

873
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,988
give her the opportunity to use it,

874
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,431
along with other parts.

875
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,039
-Fourteen.
-Card.

876
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,269
Right?

877
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,318
-You think I'm charming?
-Your bet again.

878
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,195
Say,

879
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,431
you're not going to believe this.

880
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,756
I'm Iooking for a woman.
What do you think? What do you say?

881
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,149
Well, I don't know anything about that.

882
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,753
Because I'm going to tell you the reason.

883
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,637
There are these two guys.

884
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,995
There's two guys,

885
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,992
and they want me to do this thing, and...

886
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,273
-Go away.
-You mean it now, don't you?

887
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:34,148
-I certainly did mean it. Yes.
-Or we'II call the manager.

888
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:37,073
Here's the thing that I'm going to tell you.
I'm going to tell you a...

889
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:40,914
I'm going to tell you something.
I'm going to tell you something now.

890
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,554
I...

891
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,869
Excuse me, ma'am, don't Ieave.

892
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,393
Don't Ieave.

893
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,711
Listen to me.
Here's the thing. I'm Iooking for...

894
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,316
I'm Iooking for a girl.

895
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,278
-Do you know any?
-Well, yes, but not the sort...

896
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,352
-Come on, Iad.
-Why are you telling us all this?

897
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,238
Because I don't know
anybody else in London.

898
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,959
That's a joke. It's a joke!

899
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:11,918
I don't think it's very funny.
I'm sorry, but we are waiting for somebody.

900
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,991
-Right, right.
-If you don't mind.

901
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,877
-Thank you.
-Right.

902
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:18,110
Awful. Right? Awful!

903
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,159
-Yes.
-Just awful!

904
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:22,879
He's mad.

905
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,069
Why don't you sit down?
I'II buy you a drink.

906
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:28,833
What do you drink? That's terrific.

907
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,068
-What do you drink?
-I'II have a whisky, please.

908
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,674
You'II have a whisky. Is that Iike Scotch?

909
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,196
-Yes, same thing.
-Two Scotch.

910
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,074
I could drink you under the table.

911
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,598
-Bet you couldn't.
-Yeah, I can drink you

912
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:46,829
right under the table.

913
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,638
I bet you couldn't.

914
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,873
Thank you.

915
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,794
-How did you know I was a Leo?
-How did I know you were a Leo?

916
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:01,193
There were certain indications.
I Iooked into your eyes,

917
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,316
I saw it right away. Leo.

918
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,277
You must be a...

919
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,396
You must be a Sagittarian.

920
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,833
Aren't you?

921
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,869
Give me a cigarette there, please.

922
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,798
That's the most amazing thing
I've ever heard.

923
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:25,316
-But you're very short.
-I'm a Sagittarian, and I'm short.

924
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,994
-Short Sagittarian.
-You have such observation powers,

925
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:31,550
I can't believe it,
but I have a Iot of charm, don't I?

926
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,717
Thing is I'm quite tall.

927
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,951
Yes, I believe that,
but you're also very intelligent

928
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,553
and you're...

929
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,151
You have a biting tongue.

930
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:47,558
And you're... You... You...

931
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,876
I don't know what you do. Let's see.

932
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,359
You're a...

933
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,950
Gosh, I don't know anything about you.
You're a...

934
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,235
You're a...

935
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:02,835
Just give me an hour, and I'II think of it.
You're...

936
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:10,669
Do you Iike art, theatre, music,
Ianguage, religion, politics?

937
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,557
-No, I don't Iike politics.
-What Ianguages do you speak?

938
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,959
-None.
-None?

939
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,076
-English, I'm afraid.
-Do you understand French?

940
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,357
-No.
-I'm going to give you a Iittle bit of French.

941
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,149
Sounds awful. What is it?

942
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,674
It was so dirty, I can't tell you.

943
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,398
You Iike Italian?

944
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,519
You're making it up. It's not real.

945
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:44,473
It's not real?
It's not real to you, but it's real to me.

946
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,755
Now watch, can you understand this better?
I Iove you.

947
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,034
Or can you understand this better?

948
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,028
It doesn't matter
if I repeat it again and again.

949
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,268
You Iike...

950
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,952
What else do you Iike?

951
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,476
What are
the Romance Ianguages that interest you?

952
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,316
-What, the sound of them, you mean?
-Absolutely.

953
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,630
-'Cause I can't understand them.
-Excuse me.

954
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,995
I can't understand them,
so it's only the sound I can...

955
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,399
That you can understand.

956
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,835
Excuse me, can we have another Scotch?

957
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,148
You can understand...

958
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:22,559
Two doubles, please.

959
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,835
You can understand Latin?

960
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,110
-No, some Latin. A Iittle Latin.
-English, you can understand.

961
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,349
Yes.

962
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:33,479
Let me tell you something.
Don't move, this is called a whisper.

963
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,397
-How you doing?
-Fine.

964
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,913
Good.

965
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,673
Listen,

966
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,876
you busy, or you going to Ieave?

967
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,669
AII right. I'm doing fine. What did you say?

968
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,712
Well, I was just wondering if you
were going to hang around or not.

969
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,279
Here's the thing.
We don't know one another,

970
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,634
but my name is BIack.

971
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,280
I'm Mr BIack. I'm from New York.
I just got into town.

972
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,998
-Queen.
-I'm new here.

973
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,789
And I just wondered and wondered
if you were

974
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:08,510
a friendly person, or what do you think?
Listen, I'm a hell of a guy, and...

975
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,989
I...

976
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,390
I think you're a Iovely Iady.

977
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,512
You interest me.

978
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,389
I do?

979
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,630
I see, well,

980
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,078
I'm going to tell you something now.
I'm not very interesting.

981
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:31,119
I'm a very ordinary guy.
I got a family. I got two kids, so that...

982
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:35,193
-And that makes it difficult.
-But your family is here with you.

983
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,515
No.

984
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,236
No. No.

985
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,197
No, my family is in New York.

986
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,239
Yeah. Look,

987
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,157
I'II see you around.

988
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:56,836
-I could satisfy you.
-Don't do that. Don't do that.

989
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,315
-I'm very rich.
-Take your hand off there.

990
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,674
-Do you want girls?
-Take your hand...

991
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,671
-I can give you girls.
-I don't want any girls.

992
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:03,909
-Do you want boys?
-No.

993
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,912
-I can give you boys.
-Listen to me, Iisten to me.

994
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,877
I'm a very rough guy.

995
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,515
Good.

996
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,749
Lady,

997
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,475
you got your hand on my hand.

998
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,108
You've got your hand on my hand.

999
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,316
Take your hand off my hand.

1000
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,550
Take your hand off my hand.

1001
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:23,718
Listen to me.

1002
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:28,791
You want me to get rough with you?
Because I can Iose my head if I have to.

1003
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,828
Lady, I'm not alone.

1004
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,558
Are you going to take
your hand off my hand?

1005
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:37,675
No.

1006
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,792
-You're not?
-No.

1007
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,155
You want me to call my friends?

1008
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:52,759
Don't make me Iose my head.
Take your hand off my hand.

1009
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,512
Take your hand off my hand.

1010
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,672
I will take my hand off your hand,
but you got to take your hand

1011
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,512
off my hand first.

1012
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,353
That's right.

1013
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,799
That's right. Now,

1014
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,353
come here.

1015
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,712
You're terrific.

1016
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,037
I'II see you around.

1017
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,590
-He wants bobs.
-Give him $3.

1018
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,796
-You got bobs?
-Give him $3.

1019
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:34,155
Here take this. That's enough.

1020
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,519
Come on in.

1021
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,478
Take your coat?

1022
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,634
No, no.

1023
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,872
Can I keep it on?

1024
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:18,915
Yes.

1025
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,153
Take this off.

1026
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:51,428
-Who wants a drink? Anyone want a drink?
-Yes, please. I think I'II have a whisky.

1027
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,634
Whisky. Harry?

1028
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:06,157
Hello, room service. This is Room 426.
Mr BIack. Mr Archie BIack.

1029
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:09,951
We'd Iike a bottle of...

1030
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:12,995
Bell's.

1031
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:18,438
A bottle of Bell's whisky. And we'd Iike a...

1032
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,670
-Anyone want anything to eat?
-No, thank you.

1033
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,239
You want something to drink?

1034
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,880
I'd Iike a shrimp cocktail.

1035
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,993
-A double-shrimp cocktail.
-Coca-Cola, please.

1036
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:30,510
-One Coca-Cola.
-And we'd Iike...

1037
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,909
What kind of salad do you have?

1038
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,831
-I'd Iike a...
-One Coca-Cola.

1039
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:42,119
Oh, and one Coca-Cola.
I would Iike a Belgian endive salad.

1040
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:45,317
Yeah, a Belgian endive with tomato,

1041
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:52,475
and Iemon and oil dressing.

1042
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,950
Anybody want a salad?
What kind of soup do you have?

1043
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:02,669
Turtle soup. I don't want any soup.
Anyone want any soup? Turtle soup?

1044
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:05,115
-Not for me, thank you.
-No.

1045
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,794
Okay, well, that's about the order.

1046
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:11,953
Bring some olives and some nuts
and Iots of ice, all right?

1047
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,190
Thank you. Thank you.

1048
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,189
Well, can I use your Ioo, please?

1049
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:27,477
-My Ioo?
-Well, anybody's Ioo.

1050
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,232
-Well, now.
-A Ioo.

1051
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,878
Hey, come here.

1052
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,548
That's Archie's Ioo,
so we don't want to use that Ioo, so...

1053
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:43,349
And that's Harry's,
and the one after that is mine.

1054
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:47,752
And you'II find it's much more comfortable,
and the heat is always on.

1055
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,557
-AII right, Leo?
-Yeah.

1056
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,718
You're inscrutable.

1057
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,157
-Have a match?
-Yeah.

1058
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,111
Oh, my, my, my, my.

1059
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,629
Oh, my, my, my.

1060
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,389
-You all right?
-I'm all right.

1061
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,633
I'm all right.

1062
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,758
-Is anything the matter, Harry?
-That's all right. It's all right.

1063
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:11,511
-Do you want me to go home?
-No, no, no, no, no.

1064
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:17,788
Sit up.

1065
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:23,914
Sit up.

1066
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:33,109
Now, bend forward. Lean forward. Right.

1067
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:48,598
Oh, that's good. Oh, you're wonderful.

1068
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,509
My wife used to do that for me.

1069
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:05,073
Get up. On your feet.

1070
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,919
Now, walk.

1071
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:21,994
Will you excuse us a moment, please?
Which is your room?

1072
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,550
-It's in there.
-Go on in.

1073
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,393
Excuse us.

1074
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,558
-I'm going in there.
-Come on.

1075
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,279
I Ieft my

1076
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:19,839

1077
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:23,909
Sorry.

1078
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,791
You want the door closed?

1079
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:35,317
'Cause I'II be happy to close it
for you, Archie.

1080
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:07,634
I want to apologise for the behaviour inside.
I thought it was crude.

1081
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:11,076
And I want to apologise
for Iocking the door, too.

1082
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:14,948
-That wasn't necessary. Right?
-Fine.

1083
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,471
I think you're too complicated
for your own good.

1084
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:23,757
-You think I'm complicated?
-Yes, I think you're complicated.

1085
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:26,348
Why do you think I'm complicated?

1086
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,109
Well...

1087
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,918
Go ahead, be honest. Go ahead, be honest.

1088
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,517
I don't Iike your American bluntness.

1089
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:40,111
Banging people on backs

1090
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:43,552
and calling them "pal."

1091
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:45,710
You don't even know them.

1092
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:50,438
And I don't Iike your silly, sniggering,
schoolboy friends, either.

1093
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,232
I think you're nuts.

1094
01:28:56,200 --> 01:29:00,239
It's okay, 'cause I Iike nuts. I'm a nut myself.

1095
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:11,308
God! That's my throat you're shaking.

1096
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,874
Get off!

1097
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,037
-This is called the Greek scissor grip.
-Get off me!

1098
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,793
It's good for Greeks and scissors.

1099
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:25,634
You know any Greeks?
Any good Greek restaurants, huh?

1100
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,991
I Iove it. AII right, just relax another second.

1101
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:37,119
Relax. Just one second. Relax. Ready?

1102
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:40,832
-Just get off of me.
-Okay. Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1103
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:43,388
PIease, sweetheart. Lie down. Just Iie down.
Lie down a second.

1104
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:44,873
-Let me get comfortable, please.
-No, no, please.

1105
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,190
Let go. You're hurting my arm. Thank you.

1106
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,192
Now. Now.

1107
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,510
Sweetheart, don't do that.

1108
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:59,160
It doesn't make any sense
what you're doing here.

1109
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:03,199
See, just take that down.
What's wrong with your stomach, darling?

1110
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,917
-Nothing wrong with it.
-There is, there's something terribly...

1111
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,991
There's nothing wrong with it.
I just don't want to be touched.

1112
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:10,559
-Can I... Can I...
-No, I don't want to be touched.

1113
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,358
-Let me take your shoes off!
-I don't want...

1114
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,358
-PIease, Iet me just take your...
-I don't want my shoes taken off!

1115
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:20,230
-I don't want my shoes taken off.
-I only took one off. The other one stays on.

1116
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:24,679
-Just Iet me take this one.
-Get off me.

1117
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:26,432
I'm a shoe eater.

1118
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,071
-Oh, I Iove that kind of half violence...
-Get off me!

1119
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:36,075
...half indolence. Darling, I see everything.
I swear. Now put your skirts down.

1120
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:41,072
Go ahead. PIease, please.
And this one, too. I can't stand that.

1121
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:44,757
PIease. PIease. I just wanna see...

1122
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,798
I'm so drunk.

1123
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:56,235
-Stay there, please. Just Iie still.
-Do you Iove me?

1124
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:57,878
No, I don't.

1125
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,154
-PIease, just Iie still.
-See that Iight?

1126
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:00,434
-Yon Iight?
-Yes.

1127
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,875
Yon English Iight heads blazing bright!

1128
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:05,997
Oh, you're mad! PIease, Iie down.
PIease, Iie down.

1129
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,435
-Lie down? Lie down.
-Yes. Yes, Iie down.

1130
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:10,192
AII right, I will.

1131
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,869
Just relax a moment. Just relax.
Look, it's not that important. Just relax.

1132
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:20,315
I'm gonna get you in one second.
I'm gonna go mad.

1133
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,628
-I'm gonna go mad.
-No, please, don't go mad.

1134
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:22,789
-PIease, don't go mad.
-I'm going to go mad.

1135
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:26,031
You're not going to achieve anything
by going mad.

1136
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:30,755
I'm not gonna go mad.
I'm not gonna go mad.

1137
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:36,111
-Now, get off me!
-Did someone get on you?

1138
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:38,634
-I don't want... I don't want...
-Did you know I was schizophrenic?

1139
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:41,632
I kill women in bed, then I pick my nose.

1140
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:46,029
God.

1141
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:49,351
-I'm mad! I'm mad! I'm mad!
-Get off me!

1142
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:53,399
I'm half mad, half man.
I'm half mad, half man.

1143
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,755
Do you understand what that means?
Will you kiss my Iip?

1144
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:56,875
-Get off me!
-Here. This Iip.

1145
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,598
-I don't want to kiss your...
-I Iove you.

1146
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:01,752
I don't want anything to do with you.
Get off me! Get off...

1147
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,239
Okay, watch out. I'm not gonna do anything.

1148
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:04,514
...me!

1149
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:10,153
I can't go through this any more.
I'm exhausted, sheerly exhausted.

1150
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:14,313
You're bigger than I am.
You beat the shit out of me. I'm just tired.

1151
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:19,877
Oh, please. No, I can't. I can't.
I can't go on any more. Honestly, I can't.

1152
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:21,109
-Don't.
-PIease.

1153
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:23,634
-Don't go on any more.
-PIease.

1154
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:25,392
-I'm getting...
-Look, just relax, please.

1155
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:28,278
-Archie! Hurry!
-Oh, gosh...

1156
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,271
-I'm about to enter...
-You're mad!

1157
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:32,874
-...the portals of hell!
-Get off me!

1158
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:36,197
You're strangling me! Get up...

1159
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:43,636
-How can I get you... I can't even help you.
-Let me get... Get off! Get off me, please!

1160
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:48,191
One kiss, one kiss, one kiss.
The werewolf is attacking.

1161
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:49,679
-My voice is...
-Get off me!

1162
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:54,550
I'm in fast speed!
Don't stick your tongue out, I'II bite it off!

1163
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:01,393
I'm almost choking! Get off.
I'm gonna choke!

1164
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:03,710
-I can't help you.
-Get off!

1165
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:14,957
AII right, now, Iook. Can you help me up?
Just push on my neck. Push on my neck.

1166
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,793
That's it!
Now, I'II get you out if you'II help me.

1167
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:20,474
Now, just stay there. Don't move
'cause you're in a dangerous spot.

1168
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:24,915
Careful! Oh, God!

1169
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,436
You scream Iike a fishwife.

1170
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,230
Now, Iet me take you
to a more comfortable spot.

1171
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:34,912
Oh, please, Ieave me alone.

1172
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,594
More comfortable, more comfortable.
You'II Iove it. You'II Iove it.

1173
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:42,435
PIease, just come over here.
I can't work out of the Iight. I'm a dentist.

1174
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:49,238
-Now!
-Oh, I think you're out of your tiny mind!

1175
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,756
Darling, I can't kiss you from here.

1176
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:56,276
It is physically impossible.
Even your elbow is out of my reach.

1177
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,958
-Could you help me?
-Pass it...

1178
01:33:58,040 --> 01:33:59,439
-Could you help me?
-...my dear.

1179
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,115
AII right then, I'm gonna get brutal.
I'm gonna get Iike a maniac again!

1180
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,555
I'm gonna... You Iove it, don't you?
Lookit! Lookit!

1181
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:07,119
You Iove it!

1182
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,714
You Iove it! You Iove it!

1183
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,479
I Iove it.

1184
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:22,234
It's about time. One kiss, one kiss.
Just one kiss for my mother.

1185
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:26,831
Kiss me Iike my mother, will you?
I've always been a mother-kisser!

1186
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,275
You Iike it? You know this one?

1187
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:19,956
I... I don't want to...

1188
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:24,312
See, I don't want to make it uncomfortable
for you.

1189
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,995
That's what I'm thinking about.
Not making it uncomfortable for you.

1190
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,559
I'm trying...

1191
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:36,079
If we could Iaugh... If you could Iaugh,
you see, that would be better.

1192
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:39,877
That would be better if...

1193
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,600
See, I Iike to Iaugh Iike...

1194
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:59,672
It's... Laughing is good, you know.

1195
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,270
But we don't have to Iaugh.

1196
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,554
No, we could talk.

1197
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:19,279
You talk?

1198
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:26,073
If you talk, say what's on your mind...

1199
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,878
I'm a terrific Iistener.
I'II Iisten to whatever you have to say.

1200
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:46,755
I'm sure there are things
that you would Iike to tell me.

1201
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,993
Get it out.

1202
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:03,711
Could be broken English, I don't care.

1203
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:44,753
Don't do that! Don't...
When I say don't, don't!

1204
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,998
What are you, making a sucker out of me?

1205
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,312
Come up in this room and Iie down.
Who are you kidding?

1206
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:04,598
What do you think, I'm a fool? I'm no fool.

1207
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:09,469
Come near you, and I suck wind!
Make a sucker out of me.

1208
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:15,150
Talk to you, and you don't answer me.
Who you kidding?

1209
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:18,435
You probably speak English.

1210
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:22,508
Speak Chinese, anything!
Just say something!

1211
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,279
Lie there.

1212
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:31,915
Don't get up, you don't Ieave,
just Iie there. Terrific.

1213
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:37,119
Just Iie there Iike a virgin.
I want to go to bed. You Iie there.

1214
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,757
I'm afraid to talk to you.
I'm afraid you'II break,

1215
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:48,956
and you give me tongue.

1216
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:51,838
Order Coca-Cola, and then give me tongue.

1217
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,912
Boy, I can tell you were in the chorus.

1218
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,718
The way you kiss.

1219
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,717
Is that the way to kiss in Japan?

1220
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:15,631
Where you from?
Is that where you're from? Japan?

1221
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:17,517
What's the difference?

1222
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:20,908
I'm an American. I'm from New York.

1223
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:24,999
You're Oriental, and I'm from New York.

1224
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:32,958
Order Coca-Cola, and then give me tongue.

1225
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,350
That's the part I don't get.

1226
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:41,274
Give me tongue and order Coca-Cola,
I could understand that.

1227
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:45,557
What's the difference?

1228
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:52,111
Probably part of the tradition
in your country. I don't know about that.

1229
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:54,479
I took a chance.

1230
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,755
AII my Iife, guys have been telling me,
"Archie, take a chance."

1231
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:58,717
Well, I took a chance.

1232
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:03,110
Tell me, "Let it out, Iet it out." Suck wind!

1233
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:07,350
Next time, I Iet it out,
it's gonna be in a sailboat.

1234
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:17,112
-In all the years I've been married...
-I know.

1235
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:21,708
I know.

1236
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,553
I just...

1237
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:35,872
You know, it's goddamned strange.
That's all.

1238
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,671
It's a strange thing.

1239
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:47,998
-What's so strange?
-Well, I feel...

1240
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:54,553
I feel so goddamned disloyal.

1241
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:02,955
I feel Iike my heart is breaking.

1242
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,918
You're terrific.

1243
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:26,595
You're a wonderful girl.

1244
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:55,391
-Hello.
-Hi, Mary.

1245
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:58,828
-Do you want a coffee?
-Coffee, coffee, yes, coffee.

1246
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:00,990
Can we have two, please? BIack or white?

1247
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,116
-White.
-Two whites.

1248
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:06,237
This is my friend, Gus Demetri.

1249
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:10,872
I Iive around here.

1250
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,517
-Do I embarrass you?
-Terribly.

1251
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:27,988
Oh, Gus, you're so Iaconic!
Come on, wake up! Do something! Come on!

1252
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,430
-Do something? Jesus.
-Look, move your feet or something.

1253
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:34,956
-They're too bruised.
-Go on. And now your hands.

1254
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:36,632
And Iaugh.

1255
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:39,475
Now say something funny.

1256
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:42,518
Say something funny,
so I can attack you. Go.

1257
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:45,558
Let's see. I hate aggressive women.

1258
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:55,751
-Come on, don't get sensitive on me.
-AII right. So, you don't Iike me. AII right.

1259
01:43:55,840 --> 01:44:00,470
-Just don't get sensitive, that's all.
-I don't care anyway. I mean, who are you?

1260
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:05,359
You're nobody, are you?
Just met you. Doesn't matter.

1261
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:10,911
I don't need you anyway.

1262
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,118
Gus, stop.

1263
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:33,277
-I know what it was.
-What was it?

1264
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:40,198
Big Mary tired Iittle Gussie out Iast night.
Couldn't take the pace.

1265
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:46,712
No. Big Mary tired Iittle Gussie out
this morning, not Iast night.

1266
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:04,317
I hate your silly Iittle white hands.
Your silly, stupid, Iittle white hands.

1267
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,470
I hate men with Iittle white hands!

1268
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,869
-I have Iittle white hands, but they're...
-I hate yours especially!

1269
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:11,952
They're heavily marked.
They're beautiful hands.

1270
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:14,600
They have beautiful signs in them.

1271
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:18,239
Mine are better.

1272
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:19,594
-I don't think they are.
-Of course they are.

1273
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,511
They are. They're better and they're cleaner
and bigger.

1274
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:22,635
You don't know anything.

1275
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:25,029
You have Iong Iegs Iike a horse.

1276
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:31,559
What about yours?
Little, tiny, short Iegs, don't you?

1277
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:33,915
Little, tiny, tiny, short, short Iegs!

1278
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,595
You think those are my Iegs?
These are my real Iegs?

1279
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:46,316
Gus? Did I...

1280
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:50,430
Did I really misunderstand
everything you said Iast night?

1281
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:56,791
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Did I misinterpret it all? Everything?

1282
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:59,314
-Misinterpret what?
-Gus!

1283
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:03,069
-Now, don't get violent.
-No, Gus! Look at me, please, Gus.

1284
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:07,473
Do you Iike me?

1285
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,152
I'm crazy about you.

1286
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:16,919
You're not.

1287
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:22,992
You're blonde.
You're blonde and you're tall,

1288
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:26,390
and as Iong as you're blonde and tall...

1289
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,797
Now, just be charming.

1290
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:34,633
-I don't want to be charming!
-Come on...

1291
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:36,551
-I don't... PIease, I... Gus...
-Be charming. Be charming.

1292
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:38,790
I don't want to be... Shut up!

1293
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,313
Get off... Shut up. PIease, I don't...

1294
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:44,871
Mary, what do you want me to do?
You want me to say, "Will you marry me?"

1295
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:08,471
Listen, there's no cabs. It's impossible.
Wait here, and I'II call for one.

1296
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:14,152
Where are you going?

1297
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:21,874
Hey, where are you going in the rain?

1298
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:27,154
Where you going in the rain? Julie?

1299
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:42,438
You believe me now? There are no cabs.

1300
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:49,433
You believe me now?
There are no cabs. No cabs.

1301
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:04,674
Thanks.

1302
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:54,592
-Gus.
-Oh, come in.

1303
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:04,191
I got to talk to you.

1304
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:09,470
Now, here's the thing, Gus.

1305
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:14,230
Listen to me. Hey, Gus, I got a problem.

1306
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,711
-You got a problem?
-I got a problem.

1307
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:19,268
I want you to hear this. Hear me out now.

1308
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:22,318
-Archie, I want to ask you one question.
-This is a crisis in my Iife...

1309
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,870
-One question.
-Now, Iisten to me what I'm telling you.

1310
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:32,871
Do you think...
You think that I'm a selfish guy.

1311
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:36,111
-I don't think you're a selfish guy, and...
-You don't think I'm a selfish guy?

1312
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:38,873
-Here's the thing, Gus.
-You don't know me.

1313
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:43,670
-Gus, you're gonna Iisten to what I say?
-Want to hear something funny?

1314
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:46,274
I want to tell you what's on my mind, Gus.

1315
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:48,999
-Harry Ieft all this furniture in here.
-I'm not interested in that.

1316
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:50,274
What's his furniture doing here?

1317
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:52,828
I don't know
what his furniture is doing here.

1318
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:56,595
You know that gawky girl
I was out with Iast night? Mary?

1319
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:59,356
You know, the great big one?

1320
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,117
What are you doing
Ieaning on Harry's furniture?

1321
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:07,910
Gus, I'm crazy about that Chinese girl.
Will you Iisten to me?

1322
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:10,076
-I'm crazy about the Chinese girl.
-What do you want me to do?

1323
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:14,438
Marry the Chinese girl for you?
I'm crazy about a 6'3" girl.

1324
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:16,909
-I'm in deep trouble, Gus.
-I don't wanna go home!

1325
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,676
Emotionally, I am in deep trouble.
Now, Iisten to me. I am serious now.

1326
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:25,070
Why didn't you tell me in the hallway?
Why do you wait now to tell me?

1327
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:26,832
-Because...
-Why didn't you tell me in the hallway

1328
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:29,309
when we were out in the hallway?
You gave me the cold shoulder.

1329
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:31,550
-You're going in the room by yourself.
-How Iong I known you, Gus?

1330
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:32,709
-I'm gonna put my...
-We gotta go home.

1331
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,597
-I'm gonna put my problems on you...
-We gotta go...

1332
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:37,911
That's right, we gotta go home.
We gotta go home.

1333
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,393
There's only one problem. Stop Iaughing.
I don't wanna go home! You hear me?

1334
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,399
-Hey...
-Now, what are we going to do?

1335
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:49,075
-Archie.
-What are we gonna do?

1336
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:52,436
-We got one inside...
-Harry is Harry.

1337
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:57,308
-Right now, Harry...
-We got two Iovely wives, you know.

1338
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:04,230
The only problem is to go home,
and make Iove to them.

1339
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:13,636
-That's it there.
-Got pneumonia.

1340
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,790
We got five children between us.
I hope they're...

1341
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:24,832
We have two houses.

1342
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:33,271
We got four garages.

1343
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:37,311
We got two cars.

1344
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:43,358
You trying to tell me we're not going home?

1345
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,112
We're going home.

1346
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:51,353
The only thing to do is to play it cool.

1347
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:55,955
Understand? PIay it cool.

1348
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:58,795
-PIay it cool?
-PIay it cool.

1349
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:02,310
That's right.
We just go in, and we play it cool.

1350
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:06,393
-You're in Iove with a Chink.
-And you're in Iove with a giant.

1351
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:10,833
You got a basketball player,
and I got an Oriental,

1352
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:14,230
-and now we play it cool.
-Let's tell the moon dog.

1353
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:19,553
-If he starts to cry...
-I'm freezing to death, I'm telling you.

1354
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:21,870
Cutting him out, that's all. That's all.

1355
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:24,349
-If he says one thing...
-That's all!

1356
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:25,589
...right in the kisser!

1357
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:27,875
Go in, tell him goodbye, out, finished,
that's all.

1358
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:31,350
Open the door. Open the door.

1359
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:39,199
Better knock.

1360
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:45,911
Harry, we disturbing you?

1361
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:50,117
-Listen, Harry.
-I must be crazy

1362
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:51,713

-Harry.

1363
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:53,153

-Harry.

1364
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:54,275
-...you have ever seen in your Iife.
-Harry.

1365
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:56,510
-Harry, Gus and I had a talk.

-How do you do, Archie?
-How do you do?

1378
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:31,595
They're my best friends.

01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:49,998
-Good.
-Diana and I were just discussing...

1383
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:52,555
Disgusting?

1384
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:55,757
Discussing how amazing Iife is.

1385
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:01,874
Tell Gus and Archie how amazing Iife...

1386
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:03,514
Mag and Jacky and I,

1387
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:06,717
we went into a Iittle tea shop
to get out of the rain.

1388
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,711
AII steamy, you know?

1389
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:12,829
And we hadn't been in there Iong
and suddenly this...

1390
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:15,989
This charming man appeared.

1391
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:20,795
And you know how it is.
You sometimes feel something's going on.

1392
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,394
You don't necessary see it, but you feel it.

1393
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:27,268
And we Iooked,
and there was a great big Cheshire grin,

1394
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:29,999
just sitting there, alone,
but with this great grin on his face.

1395
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:31,513
Yeah, Harry.

1396
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:36,479
I drink to men, and to Harry.

1397
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:40,628
-You what? I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.
-I drink to men, and to Harry.

1398
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:43,109
-I drink to that.
-What about Gus and Archie?

1399
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:45,031
AII right, Gus, of course.

1400
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:48,317
Oh, I beg your pardon. That was Archie.
And Gus.

1401
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:54,750
-Yeah, we had a hell of a time.
-What did you say your name was?

1402
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:57,559

-Diana. Diana what?

1403
01:54:57,640 --> 01:55:02,236

1405

1406
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:09,958
-You know what a wallaby is?

1407
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:13,077
-It's Iike a rabbit.
