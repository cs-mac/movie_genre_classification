1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Old Goodbye

2
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,000
Excuse me.

3
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,030
I've been watching you.

4
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,730
You're not here

5
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,530
to die or anything, right?

6
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,800
No, I'm here to live.

7
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,310
I'm Kang Soo Hyuk.

8
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,420
I'm Han Chae Hee.

9
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,260
Would you like a cup of coffee?

10
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,920
It's right around the corner.

11
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,470
Wait, I'm a bit busy here.

12
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,720
Smile.

13
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,500
One, two, three.

14
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,360
What are you looking at?

15
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,180
Hurry and do it. 
You said you would.

16
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,820
I was having bad dreams, 
 so I'm not in the mood.

17
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,090
This one?

18
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,170
Really?

19
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,110
Here it is.

20
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,800
Go to the left, not right!

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
You gotta go straight now.

22
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,670
Hey, kid.

23
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,430
I fixed your toy, so now you tell me.

24
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,340
Where's your daddy?

25
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,370
I really don't know.

26
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,100
Don't try to lie.

27
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,180
I just have something to get from him.

28
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,780
I know he was here last night.

29
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,290
He was, but he didn't tell me anything.

30
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,650
319.

31
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,590
320.

32
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,560
321.

33
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,780
Mr. Kang.

34
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,460
Please enter.

35
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,890
What are you?

36
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,340
The weather is good out here.

37
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,660
Mr. Kang, say you've started working
 with me other than

38
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,440

wasting your time on boxing.

39
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,730
We would've erected a building by now.

40
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,970
Stop calling me and do your work alone.

41
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,290
I'm busy.

42
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,910
Hey.

43
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,380
Are you heading to that kid's house again?

44
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,240
Stop it please.

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,440
There are plenty of places 
we could get money from.

46
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,050
Also, you need to make money
to pay me back.

47
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,550
I'll pay you back for sure.

48
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,400
By the way, I don't care about others

49
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,230
but I'm getting my money from that jerk!

50
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,000
Hey, here's your money...

51
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,630
Come on...

52
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,980
Hello?

53
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,820
Is this Kang Soo Hyuk?

54
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,450
- Yes, who is this? 
- You know Ms. Han Chae Hee, right?

55
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,850
She said she intended to giving you
 a house.

56
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,120
We need to go through some paperwork.

57
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,370
515-2 Songpadong.

58
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,180
Right, here. 
You know this place?

59
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,780
Yes.

60
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,950
Is she really giving it to me?

61
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,400
Chae Hee...

62
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,000
I mean the owner...

63
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,490
Why would she?

64
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,630
We don't know that.

65
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,530
We just process the paperwork.

66
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,650
Is the value good now?

67
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,200
When can I sell it?

68
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,120
The official giving date will set

69
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,970
once the report of her death is processed.

70
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,300
We just called you in advance

71
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,220
because of the tax issue and such.

72
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,930
Report of death?

73
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,890
[Han Chae Hee]

74
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,230
Min Sik!

75
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,910
Grandma.

76
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,140
What took you so long?

77
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,040
I've been waiting for you so dearly.

78
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,550
Who are you, Grandma?

79
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,820
Come and look at him!

80
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,110
Our Min Sik is here!

81
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,770
No, I'm not Min Sik...

82
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,500
Where?

83
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,400
Oh, this is him?

84
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,520
So Min Sik really existed, really?

85
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,040
Your mother waited so long for you.

86
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,430
She said he's nice looking.

87
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,640
She's right.

88
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,460
Come on.

89
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,750
How can you not visit your mother 
for so long?

90
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,540
No, because I'm not...

91
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,780
Chae Hee!

92
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,380
Chae Hee!

93
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,920
My son is here!

94
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,170
She's doing it again.

95
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,160
Grandma.

96
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,250
She can't hear you because she's in a coma.

97
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,090
She has dementia.

98
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,250
That's why she's talking to that patient now.

99
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,640
You can just go along with her.

100
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,210
Sometimes she comes back to normal.

101
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,240
Do you like her?

102
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,180
She's pretty, right?

103
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,820
Yes.

104
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,510
By the way, how much longer
 do I need to hold this?

105
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,130
Poor girl.

106
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,190
No one knows her condition.

107
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,680
Is she really bad?

108
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,560
She sleeps all day and night.

109
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,500
She won't even wake up.

110
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,530
What's her problem?

111
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,500
They said it's all broken here, 
pretty much everywhere!

112
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,920
Then,

113
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,260
she could die any minute?

114
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,150
No!
 Don't say like that.

115
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,450
Never, okay?

116
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,700
Okay, okay.

117
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,250
I'm so glad to see my Min Sik.

118
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,830
Are you coming back tomorrow too?

119
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,560
With grapes?

120
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,570
Sure... I guess.

121
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,050
I like my Min Sik.

122
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,270
How is that patient's condition,

123
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,030
Han Chae Hee?

124
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,910
Why do you ask?

125
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,180
I'm curious since she's sharing the room
 with my mother...

126
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,420
She has diabetes and
 terminal stage kidney failure.

127
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,120
For how long? 
I mean for a long time?

128
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,520
She came to this hospital 
about a year ago.

129
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,120
And her illness started 3 years ago.

130
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,410
3 years...

131
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,370
Before it gets worse, 
she needs to get kidney transplantation.

132
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,460
Her turn is behind schedule.

133
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,220
I'm not sure if she can hang in there
 until then.

134
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,810
What was the number?

135
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,890
Gosh, my memory is vague.
I can't remember.

136
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,510
Huh...

137
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,440
3 years ago...

138
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,290
You and I...

139
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,140
we tried everything, right?

140
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,480
I'm tired of fighting with you.

141
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,280
If you still don't want

142
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,280
to have a baby,

143
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,840
let's end it here.

144
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,430
I'll do whatever you want.

145
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,810
You can just leave.

146
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,720
Okay.

147
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,560
Come on, you jerk.

148
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,620
Hey Kang Soo Hyuk!

149
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,810
What?

150
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,530
Why won't you answer your phone all day?

151
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,970
I'm getting my money,

152
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,700
just wait.

153
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,370
I'll work hard in between, okay?

154
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,090
I'll pay your money back too.

155
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,360
Don't worry!

156
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,740
Right.

157
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,320
I need to move on.

158
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,920
Lets see.

159
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,260
What's the size of this house?

160
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,930
How come I didn't know about this place 
after living here for 2 years?

161
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,770
What is it?

162
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,090
What's this?

163
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,120
Prop pictures.

164
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,660
Places.

165
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,300
Props. 
Props.

166
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,520
Places.

167
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,500
What's this?

168
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,770
Come on.

169
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,640
I was expecting something better.

170
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,640
She used to love taking pics.

171
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,570
Well,

172
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,650
this could be some good money.

and give them to you.

You said you'd get a divorce yesterday.

How can you just come home

Can I ask you one thing?

197

Why didn't you

198
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,750
stop me yesterday?

199
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,450
I've been wondering.

200
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,650
Why would you do that.

201
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,360
Why is it not working?

I met her on the day after we broke up
3 years ago.

I was in that picture somehow.

Do you think it makes sense?

210

I'm the crazy one.

Are you kidding me?

It was time travel.

220
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,800
It's all because your father
 kept running away from me

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,850
You think I'm leaving
because I have no money?

345
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,880
The doctor informed me the test result

346
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,480
in the morning.

347
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,230
I got worse and nothing can't be done
here anymore.

348
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,400
I'll just get dialysis as an outpatient.

349
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,200
I hate hospital now.

350
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,020
Let's sell this house.

351
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,970
And get a loan

352
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:48,130
so we can buy whatever, kidney or cornea.

353
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,050
I'll see what we can do.

354
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,880
We should try until we can.

355
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,440
I've tried.

356
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,410
Two years ago, a donor 
showed up miraculously.

357
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,320
And?

358
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,880
The person canceled it and disappeared.

359
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,340
I couldn't even find the person
 since I didn't know who it is.

360
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,890
I was so disappointed

361
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,160
and I gave up all treatments.

362
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,870
That's why I'm here now.

363
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,230
But...

364
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,150
I've saved my money

365
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,000
to keep this house.

366
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,920
I'm giving you this house,

367
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,410
one-time my only family.

368
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,140
Without this house,

369
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,350
I'll be so sad when I leave.

370
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,020
Can I ask you a favor?

371
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,670
I'll stay with you until you leave.

372
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,610
That's what we said when we got married.

373
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,880
Let's

374
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,810
stay next to each other when we die.

375
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,100
I want to keep that promise.

376
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,470
Where...

377
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,500
Chae Hee!

378
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,920
Chae Hee!

379
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,760
Who are you?

380
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,450
Who...?

381
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,030
Is it before we met?

382
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,370
I said who are you?

383
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,550
How do you know my name?

384
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,650
Anyways.

385
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,670
You listen to me.

386
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,540
I know you very well.

387
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,750
You'll get sick later.

388
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,540
A serious illness.

389
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,500
So you come with me to the hospital,

390
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,280
or you go by yourself.

391
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,710
I think I know who you are.

392
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,320
Right, it's me.

393
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,120
You're like a plastic shaman, huh?

394
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,280
Wanna take advantage of me?

395
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,450
I'll call the police.

396
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:06,820
Please send me to where I'm useful.

397
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,210
So I can

398
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,340
find her family at least.

399
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,470
2002.

400
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,750
Who are you?

401
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,500
Oh, you're Chae Hee.

402
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,600
I'm...

403
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,770
a social worker.

404
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,140
I heard you're 
having financial difficulties,

405
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,360
so I came here to gather information.

406
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,670
So in 2002...

407
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,540
You're a student, right?

408
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,770
You're studying at the prep academy, right?

409
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,240
It must be hard.

410
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,570
It must be really hard.

411
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,490
The hardest thing is cramming to repeat
a college exam.

412
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,620
Excuse me,

413
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,910
it's nothing to be proud of,
can you lower your voice?

414
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,260
I'm sorry.

415
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,690
I am sorry for repeating myself
despite your difficulties.

416
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,290
Why are you here for?

417
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,780
Go Korea!

418
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,970
Go Korea!

419
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,360
This could be a way

420
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,400
to find your mother and your family.

421
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,100
Tell me.

422
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,510
I said I don't know.

423
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,130
You never know what's gonna happen.

424
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,890
You should get ready.

425
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,500
Do you have

426
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,210
any relatives, 
even far down in the family tree?

427
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,990
My mom must be alive somewhere
 since her death report is not there.

428
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,810
And?

429
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,020
Concentrate here! 
Don't watch that now.

430
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,060
Don't worry about me.

431
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,230
I'll do my best to live well.

432
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,360
That's not the whole point in your life.

433
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,310
Come on, is it their first time
watching it?

434
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,160
Get up, get up.

435
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,280
- Let's talk outside. 
- Wait.

436
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,200
I want to see the rest.

437
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
Our country will win.

438
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,330
How do you know that?

439
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,830
Ahn Jung Hwan will score!

440
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,090
Ahn Jung Hwan!

441
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,540
See?

442
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,530
Game is over!

443
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,160
Ahn Jung Hwan!

444
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,910
Korea is now in the quarter final!

445
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,640
Now you understand me, right?

446
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,670
Let's meet tomorrow morning.

447
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,780
Let's go get you checked up.

448
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,660
No.

449
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,900
Let's go every month regularly.

450
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,620
That's what I'm going to do.

451
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,560
Excuse me.

452
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,590
Wait.

453
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,020
I have to do something important now.

454
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,400
So please be quiet.

455
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,960
Sure.

456
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,080
Not again.

457
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,570
I really want to know.

458
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,410
What wish are you praying there?

459
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,220
Send me a person who'll stay
 with me forever.

460
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,840
Someone who'd never leave me 
no matter what happens.

461
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,590
I would've been lonely to watch the game
 by myself.

462
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,670
It was good to have you.

463
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,200
Thank you.

464
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,970
Me too.

465
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:55,870
We should go.

466
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,600
Yes, sure. 
Be careful.

467
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,400
Go in.

468
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,020
Lock the door.

469
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,530
Sleep well.

470
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,040
Okay.

471
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,080
Bye Mister.

472
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,760
Sure.

473
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,540
See you tomorrow.

474
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,480
Okay.

475
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,210
Mister.

476
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,620
Trying to take pictures, huh?
Don't.

477
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,310
- Don't!
- Wow, you're good at guessing.

478
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,760
My head is killing me.

479
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,560
By the way

480
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,240
what relationship do you have 
with my daddy?

481
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,010
Are you his friend?

482
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,070
With your daddy?

483
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,700
We were just

484
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,060
neighbors.

485
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,600
Did you lend money to my daddy?

486
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,460
Money?

487
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,440
Yes, I did.

488
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,210
That's why I'm here.

489
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,530
When?

490
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,060
About 2 years ago.

491
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,110
That was...

492
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,700
That was...

493
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,660
Why can't I remember?

494
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,360
Happy Birthday.

495
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,550
Nothing fancy.

496
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,390
I barely got this one too.

497
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,300
You light it up.

498
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,310
I don't want to burn our house down.

499
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,520
Did you finish?

500
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,180
Happy birthday to you.

501
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,530
Happy birthday to you.

502
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,600
Kang Soo Hyuk...

503
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,670
Happy birthday to you.

504
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,510
Thank you.

505
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,590
You did that on purpose, right?

506
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,490
When you didn't stop me 3 years ago,

507
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,640
you purposely let me go.

508
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,330
You knew about your illness.

509
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,510
That's why you didn't want a baby either.

510
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,680
You did it deliberately.

511
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,650
Even if I say yes,
it won't change anything.

512
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,590
Since when did things go wrong?

513
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:36,660
Three years ago,

514
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,080
if I had

515
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,520
tried harder

516
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,100
would you be different now?

517
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,740
If we can turn the clock back

518
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,080
would you be different then?

519
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,790
It's no use.

520
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,170
Everything is predestined.

521
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,490
So don't blame yourself.

522
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,770
We still have hopes.

523
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,460
Hope.

524
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,000
You're alive!

525
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,770
Hey kid.

526
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:00,540
Where are we?

527
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:01,770
Beach.

528
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,670
No, not that. 
What's the city?

529
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,100
Dongmak beach, Ganghwado,

530
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:07,920
Dongmak?

531
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,840
Dongmak is

532
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,940
where we met for the first time.

533
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,880
[Han Chae Hee]

534
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,920
- Your name is Han Chae Hee? 
- Yes.

535
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,510
How old are you?

536
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,440
Ten.

537
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,400
Do you live here?

538
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,360
Yes.

539
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,980
Your parents?

540
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,910
Daddy passed away and mom's at home.

541
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,070
Mom's at home?

542
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,800
Where's your house?

543
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,060
Chae Hee.

544
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:53,180
I just need to talk to your mother.

545
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,830
We might need her later.

546
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,240
I'm not a bad guy.

547
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,360
They said a man who says that 
is the worst kind.

548
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,530
Right...

549
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,190
I'm sorry.

550
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,280
I was just joking.

551
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,690
Joking.

552
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:14,890
I'm leaving.

553
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,880
I'm getting up.

554
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,700
Bye Chae Hee.

555
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,860
Excuse me.

556
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,950
Who are you?

557
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:40,530
Chae Hee's teacher.

558
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,130
Yeah right.

559
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:45,560
You're just another thug to get the money.

560
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,400
Where are you going by the way?

561
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,520
Why do you care?

562
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,620
Wait.

563
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,690
Are you running away now?

564
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:54,760
You're abandoning your kid?

565
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,010
What's wrong with you?

566
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,060
Yes, so what?

567
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,460
I have nothing to do
 with her daddy's debt.

568
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,280
So get lost.

569
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,370
How about the kid? 
Chae Hee?

570
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,550
How can you flee leaving your kid behind?

571
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:08,760
Her grandma in Seoul should 
take care of her.

572
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,280
She'll need you one day.

573
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,130
How can you flee away
with no sense of responsibility?

574
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,760
What?

575
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,500
I'm not even her real mom.

576
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,780
So what?

577
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,580
What?

578
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,770
She and I are not blood-related.

579
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:27,980
Her daddy brought her.
Why do I have to take care of her?

580
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,610
I've done my part.

581
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,680
Wait, wait.

582
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:38,250
Does she know that too?

583
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,180
We remarried when she was an infant, no way.

584
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,920
So get out of my way.

585
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,790
What a weird collector.

586
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,090
Mister, why are you still here?

587
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,980
You don't have a house?

588
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,590
Yes, I do have one.

589
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,050
But

590
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,600
it's scary to go back.

591
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:32,960
Since I haven't done anything here.

592
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:41,200
Why didn't you go to school?

593
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,310
Mom disappeared.

594
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,970
I'm too worried about her and I can't go.

595
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,990
I'm going to wait for her here.

596
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,420
Then you can stay home.

597
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:58,990
She'll come home if she comes back.

598
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:00,100
No,

599
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,100
I have to check if she comes back or not.

600
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,970
Chae Hee.

601
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,400
Do you want me to tell you a secret?

602
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:12,890
Actually I...

603
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,910
forgot how to go back home.

604
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,740
Can I be

605
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,400
your uncle and

606
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,990
stay with you forever?

607
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,240
Liar.

608
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,660
Can you promise?

609
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:35,260
Should we date?

610
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,850
You won't be lonely with me.

611
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,000
Liar.

612
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:46,000
Can you promise that?

613
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,810
You won't keep that promise.

614
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:52,740
I can promise,

615
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,620
you won't even remember the word "lonely."

616
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,350
Really.

617
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,660
Right.

618
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:07,270
I made you lonely and

619
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:10,240
I made that promise.

620
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,330
Mister.

621
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:15,480
Do you want to see something cool?

622
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,820
It's my treasure #1.

623
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,110
I picked it up yesterday at the beach.

624
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,670
Isn't it cool?

625
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,350
I haven't shown it to anyone yet.

626
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:35,120
You're the first one to see it.

627
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:38,900
Chae Hee.

628
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,430
You never seen something 
like this either, right?

629
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,920
I thought it was a dream,

630
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:11,720
but it wasn't.

631
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:14,680
No.

632
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,810
Now,

633
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,860
I'm not sure what I should do.

634
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:34,220
Just accept it.

635
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:37,800
I've tried too,

636
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,040
but failed.

637
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,000
What?

638
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,810
I told you.

639
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:49,030
We can't change the destiny.

640
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:54,200
The time with you

641
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,710
was a blessing for me.

642
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:00,150
Especially

643
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,230
this past week

644
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:04,850
with you...

645
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:17,110
Chae Hee.

646
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:21,350
Chae Hee.

647
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:24,430
Chae Hee!

648
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:37,100
How come I couldn't reach you for days?

649
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,340
Give me some money.

650
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,710
Do I look like an angel to you?

651
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,100
I'll pay back, please.

652
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,770
This is why I need to record everything,
 here.

653
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:50,760
See?

654
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,640
You keep forgetting, so I wrote everything
 here.

655
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,350
From 2012,

656
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:56,890
you loaned

657
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,490
$65,000.

658
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,230
Just lend me some!

659
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,000
My wife is sick.

660
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,500
Please.

661
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:10,970
I have to give her my kidney.

662
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:12,670
You're doing it again.

663
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:17,160
You said the same thing 2 years ago

664
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,160
and got the money for surgery.

665
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,190
You already gave one to
 your divorced wife.

666
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,480
Give her what now?

667
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,720
Why are you going to the kid's house?

668
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,020
That's

669
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,120
to get my money...

670
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:38,160
To be exact,
 to get your money for your kidney.

671
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,240
He sold the kidney 
that was for your wife,

672
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,600
and ran away.

673
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:48,340
This.

674
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,850
This is from the surgery you got.

675
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:57,640
You're funny.

676
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,990
Are you crazy?

677
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,850
How can I not remember then?

678
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,890
You went out for a match,

679
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:10,530
saying you don't care about your life,

680
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,230
and got a big hit to your head.

681
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:17,070
You've forgotten what happened 
in those past months.

682
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,890
That's why I've kept this record, okay?

683
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,070
Do you think your health is better?

684
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,240
Your brain needs surgery too.

685
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,220
What was the number?

686
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,890
My memory is vague.

687
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:38,550
My head is killing me.

688
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:41,520
Did you lend money to my daddy?

689
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,490
When?

690
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,420
That was...

691
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,520
Why can't I remember it?

692
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,460
Min Sik, you're here!

693
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:45,380
I bought you some grapes.

694
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,560
Where have you been?

695
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,290
I was bored.

696
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,560
I'm sorry.

697
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,160
I had somewhere to go.

698
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:57,570
Now you're not leaving right?

699
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,680
I won't be able to come back now.

700
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,370
Where are you going?

701
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,900
I'm just

702
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:11,240
going to give everything

703
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,770
to Chae Hee.

704
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,810
With my eyes,

705
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,240
she can continue to take pictures
 she loved.

706
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,160
She can

707
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,600
live a bit more.

708
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,440
By the way,

709
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,570
it's something I can do now as well...

710
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:39,040
Why didn't I think of it?

711
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:47,850
Here.

712
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:49,420
Use this.

713
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,790
I've

714
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:54,080
saved up to give it to you.

715
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:57,620
No need to give it to me.

716
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,050
I'm rich.

717
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:01,420
It's from your mother, so take it.

718
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,300
My poor kid.

719
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,770
You!

720
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,370
You

721
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:27,860
close your eyes.

722
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,220
Don't open them.

723
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:37,690
Now open.

724
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,210
Wow!

725
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:41,610
You're awesome!

726
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:42,690
Open it.

727
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,540
They said it's the best one.

728
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,250
Can you assemble it by yourself?

729
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,450
I need your help.

730
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:54,420
Hey.

731
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,710
You'll become an adult when you can 
do this by yourself.

732
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,030
You'll come back tomorrow.

733
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:02,640
Let's do it together.

734
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:04,770
I won't be coming back.

735
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,410
Where are you going?

736
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,970
Far away.

737
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:14,980
Anywhere would be better than here.

738
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:19,480
It was fun to play with you.

739
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:21,400
Come here, kiddo.

740
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,130
It looks complicated.

741
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:33,210
You have to make it well, okay?

742
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,500
Daddy.

743
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,890
What a tenacious jerk.

744
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,010
Let's go.

745
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,120
Hurry!

746
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:52,400
Hurry!

747
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:54,950
Come here!

748
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,470
No...

749
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,340
I

750
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,610
can't go now...

751
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:37,230
One...

752
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,690
Let's get married.

753
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:50,250
Let's be each other's

754
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,210
best friend forever.

755
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,370
Sometimes I get scared.

756
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,870
What if

757
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:05,680
you regret meeting an
 incompetent man like me?

758
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,820
Chae Hee.

759
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,600
It's okay.

760
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,100
You'll be on my side forever.

761
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:22,850
That's enough for me.

762
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:02,620
[Kang Soo Hyuk]

763
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:06,060
The number you've dialed is not available.

764
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,980
Please leave a message after the beep.

765
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:19,490
Why can't he at least tell me he's leaving?

766
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,230
Fool...

767
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:36,820
I told you it won't work.

768
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:31,090
Here.

769
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:47,380
I've thought about it hard on my way here.

770
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:00,790
Do you want to date me?

771
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:03,590
You

772
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:07,130
won't be lonely with me.

773
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,520
Liar.

774
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,140
Can you promise that?

775
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,580
You won't keep that promise.

776
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:21,180
It's strange.

777
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,300
What is?

778
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,490
I feel like I've seen this before.

779
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:29,160
It's because you're happy

780
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,510
like you're in a dream.

781
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:34,430
Same for me.

782
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,220
I can promise,

783
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:49,180
you won't remember

784
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,300
the word "lonely".

785
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,330
I'm serious.

786
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,380
Trust me.

787
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,580
Okay.

788
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:05,170
I will.

789
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:28,010
[Old goodbye]
