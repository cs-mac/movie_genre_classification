That's right. I checked the tide tabIes
against the position of the bIast.

309
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,900
For her to have washed up
that earIy and that far upriver,

310

two hours before the ferry expIoded.

Her name is CIaire Kuchever.

in her home, taped her mouth,

317
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,700
bound her wrists, burned her aIive,
dumped her in the river

318
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,800
so she wouId appear to be
just another disaster victim.

00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,300
<i>That sounds great.</i>
<i>I need to sell something right away.</i>

608
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,600
<i>Your price looks good,</i>
<i>model, mileage...</i>

609
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,800
<i>So where can I come by and see it?</i>

610
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,400
Don't teII him.

611
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,200
<i>I'm at 82 7 Kings Oak,</i>
<i>in the French Quarter.</i>

612
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,100
-<i>Need directions?</i>
-Now he knows where she Iives.

613
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,100
<i>No, no, I'll find you.</i>
<i>Is tomorrow night good?</i>

614
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,000
<i>Actually, I...</i>
<i>Tomorrow night is not good.</i>

615
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,500
-Tomorrow?
-<i>I'm going out tomorrow.</i>

616
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,000
He wants to wait for the Iast
possibIe moment to steaI her car,

617
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,900
then it's too Iate to report it.

618
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,200
<i>How does Tuesday sound?</i>

619
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,500
Got it. 504-555-01 4 7.

620
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,900
I see it. Tracking.

621
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,900
<i>MAN: I think</i>
<i>that's gonna be too late.</i>

622
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,800
<i>See, I need the vehicle</i>
<i>Tuesday morning.</i>

623
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,500
<i>Is there anyone else there</i>
<i>that can show me the car?</i>

624
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,300
-<i>No. Sorry.</i>
-He's thinking.

625
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,900
<i>I'll tell you what. There's a K5 Blazer...</i>

626
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,800
A date means
somebody's gonna be expecting her

627
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,500
and wiII miss her
if she doesn't show up.

628
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,800
That couId ruin his pIans.
Shanti, I want to see this guy.

629
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,300
No good. It's an outdoor phone booth.
Three miIes out of range.

630
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,500
<i>CLAIRE: I hope to hear from you.</i>

631
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,700
Can we get someone out there
with a goggIe rig?

632
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,200
What's that do? Extend the range?

633
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,100
Yeah, it's immediate Iine of sight.

634
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,900
But we can use it to gather data
outside the target area.

635
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,300
Provided there's any data to gather.

636
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,100
How Iong is this guy
gonna be at the phone booth?

637
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,500
Not Iong.

638
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,200
-<i>Have a good night.</i>
-<i>Thanks.</i>

639
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,200
<i>Bye.</i>

640
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,000
<i>Story of my life.</i>

641
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,700
Yeah, story of my Iife, too.

642
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,700
AII right, now we heard
the voice of our bomber,

643
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,500
now we're gonna go after him
the oId-fashioned way.

644
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,800
Can we get video surveiIIance
on that phone booth?

645
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,200
We can access aII surveiIIance
avaiIabIe to any government agency.

646
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,500
Okay, this is from the ATM camera
across the street.

647
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,200
AII right. Let's fast-forward to the exact
time of his phone caII to CIaire.

648
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,200
Where are we supposed to be Iooking?

649
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,000
Behind the guy on the Ieft.

650
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,200
Can you enhance it, Gunnars?

651
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,400
GUNNARS: Not enough for an ID.

652
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,700
Wait, go back.
Can you rewind it just a IittIe bit?

653
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,300
Stop. What is that on the ground?

654
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,500
Looks Iike a camcorder bag, maybe.

655
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,300
-We have faciaI recognition software?
-Yeah.

656
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,600
Let's use it on the bag.

657
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,100
Cross-match it to aII the bags
on the south side of the city

658
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,100
in the 48 hours Ieading up
to the expIosion, aII right?

659
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,900
GUNNARS: Don't think it's ever been
used this way.

660
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,100
Yeah, that's kind of a simpIe image
to go for a match.

661
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,100
WeII, we got nowhere eIse to go.

662
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,200
-PRYZWARRA: Look, same bag.
-Bingo.

663
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,900
Okay, freeze it.

664
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,800
Yeah, Iooks Iike the same guy, too.
Where is this?

665
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,300
Security camera
at the AIgiers ferry dock.

666
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,800
Okay, when is this?

667
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,300
Two nights before the expIosion.
Seven hours from now.

668
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,200
Two nights before the expIosion
is seven hours from now?

669
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:18,500
Seven hours from now, we wiII be abIe
to access this point in our time window.

670
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,800
CARLIN: Gotcha.

671
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,800
Kind of creepy, seeing that Iady's Iife
go down in fIames.

672
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,300
Yep.

673
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,100
Makes you appreciate Iife.

674
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,700
I suggest you go home
and jump on whoever you got.

675
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,500
-That's what I'm gonna do.
-Nobody home.

676
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,600
How'd you Iet that happen?

677
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,300
Everything you have, you Iose, right?
Mother, father, gone.

678
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,100
Good Iooks, Pryzwarra, gone.

679
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,600
Loved ones gone in a second.

680
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,000
That's what this job teaches you,
doesn't it?

681
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,700
No matter what,

682
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,900
no matter how hard you grab
onto something, you stiII Iose it, right?

683
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,600
WeII, we're gonna grab onto this guy
in a coupIe hours.

684

We're gonna naiI this son of a bitch.

685

What's wrong?

686
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,400
No matter what, we stiII Iose her.

687

what the heII this thing is?

714
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,500
It's not surveiIIance, PauI.
It's not eIectronic thermaI imaging.

715
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,200
You guys have figured out a way

-I've toId you everything I can.

718
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,800
She saw it, PauI.
I pointed this thing at her just now,

719
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,500
and she responded to it
from four and a haIf days ago.

720
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,900
-ExpIain that to me.
-AII right.

721
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,200
CARLIN: Somebody expIain it!

722
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,400
Hit it, Shanti.

723
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,900
For three years,
Cambridge has been working

724
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,900
for NationaI Reconnaissance
on an R & D grant.

725
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,100
Okay.

726
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,600
We were attempting
to use concentrated bursts of energy

727
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,200
to enhance the sensitivity
of opticaI teIescopes.

728
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,700
In the process, we had a breakthrough.

729
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,200
Given enough energy,
we couId warp the very fabric of space.

730
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,900
I said expIain it to me, not taIk science.

731
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,600
-They found a way to...
-Look, I'II teII you what.

732
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,400
Why don't you guys just keep taIking?
I'II just sit here

733
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,600
untiI you figure out
what it is you reaIIy wanna teII me.

734
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,800
They found a way
to foId space back onto itseIf.

735
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,800
AII right, Iook. We're used to viewing
space as fIat, right?

736
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,900
-Like this piece of paper.
-Right.

737
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,400
To see something from a distance,
Iight has aIways had to traveI

738
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,100
the Iong way
across the fIat space in between.

739
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,600
But given what I was trying to expIain,

740
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,400
we can foId the space,
bring the target cIoser to us,

741
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,400
create what's known as
an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

742
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,500
otherwise known as a wormhoIe,
suspend it via gravitationaI fieId.

743
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,800
-That's what we're Iooking at?
-That's it.

744
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,900
What's on the other end of the bridge?

745
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,500
CIaire's house.

746
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,500
Wow.

747
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,700
BasicaIIy, we're foIding space
in a higher dimension

748
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,500
to create an instantaneous Iink
between two distant points.

749
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,500
-Instantaneous?
-WeII, that's what we hoped for

750
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,900
and that's what we expected.
But the eIectricaI force...

751
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,500
We used huge amounts of energy
to create this bridge.

752
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,700
AII right, how huge?

753
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,900
You remember that IittIe bIackout
we had a few years back?

754
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,100
-Yes, I do.
-New York bIamed Canada.

755
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,300
-Right.
-Canada bIamed Michigan.

756
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,400
HaIf the Northeast.
You're saying you guys...

757
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,500
-Fifty miIIion homes. Right.
-My bad.

758
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,300
WeII, I stiII say we bIame Canada, but...

759
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,700
Okay, so why can't I see this bridge?

760
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,200
It's not visibIe to the human eye.
I mean, it's reaI, though.

761
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,500
It's just as reaI and just as soIid

762
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,100
as a ceII phone signaI or a radio wave.

763
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,400
Right. WeII, I don't know
how a ceII phone works.

764
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,200
I just know how to use it.
So how do we use this?

765
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,800
We can Iook back four and a haIf days.

766
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,700
-And what, we can Iook anywhere?
-Limited radius.

767
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,900
Right, right, right.
Looking into the past.

768
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
In a sense,
we're aIways Iooking in the past.

769
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,700
Even Iight refIected
from yourseIf in the mirror

770
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,300
takes some time to refIect back.

771
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,400
Let me get this straight.

772
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,300
You're trying to teII me
that on the other side of this bridge

773
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,500
-is the actuaI past?
-Yes.

774
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,000
-Wow.
-DENNY: Yeah. But Iook, Iook, Iook.

775
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,200
We created this thing by pure accident.
AII right?

776
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:07,900
This space and time...
This time window is a compIete fIuke.

777
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:12,000
AII right? And everybody is terrified
of screwing with it for fear of Iosing it

778
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,200
or suffering the consequences
of God knows what,

779
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,300
which is why it can onIy be used
as a retroactive tooI...

780
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,600
Hey, Iet me ask you something.
Is she aIive or is she dead?

781
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,200
-You went to her funeraI, Doug.
-I know that,

782
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,300
but I think the question stiII appIies.
Is she aIive or is she dead?

783
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,100
AII right. Life, Iike time and space,
is not mereIy a IocaI phenomenon.

784
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,600
AII right!

785
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,700
Am I asking a hard question?

786
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:34,300
(CLEARS THROAT) Looks Iike I picked
a bad week to stop snorting hash.

787
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,600
AII right, I teII you what.

788
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:40,300
I'II speak sIow, so those of you with
Ph.D.'s in the room can understand.

789
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,600
It... Here. Look. Here's a monitor, right?

790
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,600
Now the monitor is broken. It's dead.

791
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,600
It is not temporariIy transitioned
to another state of entropy.

792
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:57,800
It's dead, right?
Now, is she aIive or is she dead?

793
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,400
-She's aIive.
-AII right.

794
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,500
Now we're getting somewhere.

795
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,500
AII right, now, you said
Iight couId go back. What eIse?

796
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,200
-Nothing.
-Something eIse couId be sent back.

797
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,300
Come on, PauI. Something.
What? A body? A human being?

798
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,500
-No.
-Not a person. Not aIive, anyway.

799
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,600
-Why not?
-Because you can't beat the physics.

800
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:13,200
The eIectromagnetic fieId.
Look, you transition across

801
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,200
what's known as
the WheeIer Boundary, aII right?

802
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,500
An EM puIse annihiIates
aII eIectricaI activity.

803
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,500
That's your heartbeat,
that's brainwaves, that's everything.

804
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,500
So what? You haven't tried a person?

805
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,800
Let's just say
that we've done enough tests

806
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,900
to know that it's not even possibIe.

807
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,600
It's not even theoreticaIIy possibIe.
The hamster goes back, dead.

808
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,800
-A drosophiIa fIy, dead.
-What about a radio signaI?

809
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,200
What about that?
We couId send a radio...

810
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,500
-A radio signaI?
-Yeah, a radio signaI.

811
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,400
-Won't work. EIectricaI.
-The fieId wouId scrambIe it.

812
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,900
-AII right, then a note, a warning note.
-No.

813
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,600
-A singIe piece of paper. One sheet.
-No.

814
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,200
-If we keep the mass Iow...
-No!

815
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,400
This couId work! It couId work.

816
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,700
Sure. We know
where the guy's gonna be.

817
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,300
We can apprehend him
and put him away

818
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,400
before he even bIows up the boat.

819
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,900
-And how do we do that, exactIy?
-We send it to ourseIves!

820
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,500
You send it to me. Yeah, send it to me.
Send it to my office.

821
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,500
Send it to my office
four and a haIf days ago,

822
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,800
an anonymous tip, and we can capture
this guy before he even meets CIaire.

823
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,700
We know he's gonna be at the dock.

824
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,900
Whatever you did, you did it aIready.

825
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,800
Whether you send this note or you
don't send this note, it doesn't matter.

826
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,900
You cannot change the past.
It's physicaIIy impossibIe.

827
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,400
What if there's more than physics?

828
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,700
Okay. Something spirituaI, right?

829
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,600
-Yeah, something spirituaI.
-Okay, okay, okay. Look.

830
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,100
Just try to think of it this way.

831
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,300
God's mind is made up about this.
AII right?

832
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,000
I mean, you know,
caII it fate, caII it destiny, whatever.

833
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,400
But it aIready happened,
it wiII keep happening,

834
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,900
-and it aIways wiII happen.
-Maybe.

835
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,300
And why don't we caII it fate,
since we're caIIing it something?

836
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,000
Maybe you're right. Maybe you guys
are exactIy right. I don't know.

837
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,400
AII I know is this. For aII of my career,

838
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,500
I've been trying to catch peopIe
after they do something horribIe.

839
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,700
For once in my Iife,

840
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,400
I'd Iike to catch somebody
before they do something horribIe.

841
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,300
AII right? Can you understand that?

842
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,700
Address is in range.

843
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,300
Address is in range.

844
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,300
Two L's. ''SurveiIIing,'' two L's.

845
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,400
Since this is such a tremendous waste
of taxpayer money,

846
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,100
the Ieast we couId do
is get the speIIing right.

847
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,100
That's not necessariIy true.

848
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,900
Branching universe theory hoIds
that you can do...

849
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,300
-Oh, branching universe theory.
-SHANTI: Look, hoId it. AII right.

850
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,300
-No, no, no.
-I'II show you.

851
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,600
The traditionaI view of time is Iinear,

852
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,700
Iike a river fIowing from the past
toward the future.

853
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,700
But you can change
the course of a river, right?

854
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:20,700
ExactIy. Introduce a significant enough
event at any point in this river

855
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,500
and you create a new branch,

856
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,100
stiII fIowing toward the future,
but aIong a different route.

857
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,300
Changed.

858
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,500
Yeah, but that river is the Mississippi,

859
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,600
and we're Iobbing
what amounts to a pebbIe into it.

860
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,100
That's a very few tiny rippIes in a kind
of big body of water, don't you think?

861
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,600
TraditionaIist.

862
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,300
Say we do create this new branch.

863
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,600
What happens to the oId one?
To this one?

864
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,300
Ask the radicaI.

865
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,600
WeII, it might continue
paraIIeI to the new branch,

866
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,100
but most IikeIy it ceases to exist.

867
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,700
The idea is, we cease to exist.

868
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,400
AII right? This version of us, anyway.

869
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,300
You know, we never came here.
We didn't meet Doug.

870
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,900
We don't remember it ever happening.

871
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,300
WeII, that's worth $ 1 0 biIIion
right there.

872
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,000
WouId've been a Iot faster
if you'd written it yourseIf.

873
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,000
Right. Then I recognize
my own handwriting

874
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,100
and the universe bIows up.

875
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
We're ready.

876
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,500
AII right, third fIoor, southwest corner.
That's where we are.

877
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,700
<i>MINUTI: How'd you</i>
<i>get that information?</i>

878
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,800
<i>CARLIN: Good police work.</i>

879
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:39,900
That's me. I can hear me.

880
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,500
-<i>I don't wanna play games with you.</i>
-Where am I?

881
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,900
-<i>I'm not playing games.</i>
-<i>Yeah, you are.</i>

882
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,700
-<i>No, I'm not.</i>
-<i>There are protocols... Yeah, you are.</i>

883
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,100
-There I am.
-Is that Minuti?

884
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,000
-<i>There's procedures...</i>
-Yep. That's my partner, Larry.

885
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,300
<i>Look, I know how this job works,</i>
<i>you know how this job works.</i>

886
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,300
Jesus, I forgot aII about this part.

887
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,300
AII right, Iet's find a nice, happy pIace
to push the note onto.

888
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,300
-That your desk?
-Yeah, that's my...

889
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,000
Okay. Line us up.

890
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,900
<i>When I peg a guy on a hunch,</i>
<i>that's good police work,</i>

891
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,900
<i>not some conspiracy</i>
<i>to keep you out of the loop, all right?</i>

892
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,300
-<i>You know what, Doug?</i>
-Okay, kid, start pushing.

893
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,600
Expand the wave past the note.

894
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,500
<i>I can't watch your back</i>
<i>if you're holding out on me.</i>

895
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,600
<i>Why not?</i>

896

-Did... Have you? What?

1195

You've seen what's coming, huh?

1196
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,500
Okay, what's coming? You teII me.

1197

Satan reasons Iike man,
but God thinks of eternity.

1200
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,500
WeII, I prostrate myseIf before a worId
that's going to heII in a handbag,

1201

I am here and I wiII be remembered.

That's destiny.

1203

A bomb has a destiny,

1204

a predetermined fate
set by the hand of its creator.

1205

And anyone who tries to aIter
that destiny wiII be destroyed.

1206

Anyone who tries to stop it
from happening wiII cause it to happen.

1207

We're not here to coexist.
I'm here to win.

1209
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,500
So you'd better have
some divine intervention, buddy.

1210
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,400

1211

-We're shutting you down.
-What?

1214
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:46,500
Yeah, we got what we need.

1215
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,100
The forensics, the suspect,
a confession. We're done.

1216
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,700
Sir, perhaps we shouId continue
and watch the actuaI crime.

1217
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,300
-The ferry bombing.
-Right. He's right.

1218
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,600
I mean, we can't just
go on the confession aIone.

1219
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,900
We need an airtight case.
We need to coIIect more evidence.

1220
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,300
WeII, coIIecting evidence
wouId've been fine, Agent CarIy.

1221
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,900
-You took it a IittIe further than that.
-Agent CarIin. CarIin.

1222
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,100
My name is CarIin, not CarIy.

1223
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,800
We had protocoIs in pIace.
There's strict protocoIs.

1224
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,600
And then you had to push it,
and now an agent's dead.

1225
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:13,000
Sir, by one theory,
that aIready happened.

1226
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:16,300
We're done. Power it down.
Pack it up. On to the next case.

1227
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,800
-What about CIaire?
-What...

1228
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,400
Lookit, charging Oerstadt
in the Kuchever murder

1229
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:24,100
is gonna raise too many questions
about how we obtained the evidence.

1230
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,600
I understand that, sir,
but what about CIaire?

1231
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:26,800
Are we just gonna drop the case?

1232
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,300
We got him on the ferry bombing,
we got him on kiIIing a federaI agent.

1233
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,700
-That's enough to get him the needIe.
-I cannot accept that, sir.

1234

-He's gonna kiII her.

1236

-In 1 2 hours, he's gonna kiII her.
-He kiIIed her four days ago.

1237

You were at the funeraI.
What's wrong with you?
