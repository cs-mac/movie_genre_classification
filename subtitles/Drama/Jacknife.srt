ALARM RINGS

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,040
THIS FILM CONTAINS VERY
STRONG LANGUAGE.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,080
DULL RING

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,600
MURMUR OF RADIO

5
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,080
Rise and shine cos it is ti-ime!

6
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,600
Davey! Davey!

7
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,800
Come on, you great swinging dick!

8
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,360
Wake up! We're gonna dance
on Charlie the Tuna's grave!

9
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,800
David! I see you.

10
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,280
Open up, man!

11
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,000
Davey.

12
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,800
Dave!

13
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,640
David, some loudmouth is
yelling for you. Come on, get up.

14
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Get up, David. Let's go. Get up.

15
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,800
Yeeeaaah!

16
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,560
Davey?

17
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,400
Davey?

18
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,600
Davey?

19
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,200
Heeeey!

20
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,200
Oh, no!

21
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,600
Hey, you always go golfing in PJs?

22
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,600
Huh? What?

23
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,960
You got mud cleats in them slippers?

24
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,960
Huh?

25
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,560
Joseph Megessey. Call me Megs.

26
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,560
Megs?

27
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,560
That's my name. Don't wear it out.

28
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,560
It's ridiculous.

29
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,920
I don't know you.

30
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,920
I feel like I know you.

31
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,160
Your brother talked about you a lot.
Said you were swell.

32
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,680
Davey! What's goin' on?

33
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,600
Davey! Come on,
you great swinging dick, let's go!

34
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,600
Quiet. Shhhh!

35
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,200
We'll be out fishin' very soon.

36
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,200
You're mad. It's still dark.

37
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,200
Yeah.

38
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,520
Davey!

39
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,520
Megessey. Who do you think you are?

40
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,800
Your room, huh?

41
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,800
How dare you! Mr Megessey, I was
up until 2am grading papers.

42
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,200
Nice bed.

43
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,200
Oh... I'll count to ten,
then I call the police. One...

44
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,400
This you?

45
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,400
..two, three...

46
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,400
You've changed. You're pretty.

47
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,600
Mr Megessey.
Where do you think you're going?

48
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,600
Davey?

49
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,000
Fuck!

50
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:18,400
Mr Megessey, will you wait?

51
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,400
Forget it, it ain't your fault.

52
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,400
I'm sure my brother just forgot...

53
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:26,400
Hey, I covered ground. I called
long distance. "It's me," I say.
"Right, how are you?" All that.

54
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,000
He says let's get together.
I just called to let him know
I'm back, I'm not pushing.

55
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,880
He says, "Let's get together."

56
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,880
At 6am?

57
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,320
Hey, I'm talking.
"Great," I say. "When?"

58
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,400
"Whenever." "Openin' Day?" I ask.
"Openin' Day," he says.

59
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,800
So, here I am, 2,500 miles later.
Who is to blame? Me or 'Mr Busy'?

60
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,480
And when was this call?

61
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,800
A couple of weeks ago.

62
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,400
Maybe five.

63
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,400
Oh, five weeks.
Did you call to confirm?

64
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,160
Who needs this shit?

65
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,160
Mr Megessey? Joseph!

66
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,200
David has had hangovers before.

67
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,200
(LAUGHS)

68
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,200
What the hell? Martha, what...?

69
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,960
Megs, what are you doing here?
Jesus, I'm all wet.

70
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,480
Move your butt, David.
It's Opening Day.

71
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,960
Oh, Jesus Christ...

72
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,960
We're gonna catch Martha a trout.

73
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,400
Get outta here!

74
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,400
Come on, David, catch me a trout.

75
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,760
Someone's lost their mind.

76
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,760
It's Openin' Day. Rainbows this long.

77
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,680
I ain't up to it.

78
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,680
Sure you are.

79
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,200
HE RETCHES

80
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,200
See, you just need
a bit of perking up.

81
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,520
What?

82
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,520
You talked him into comin'.

83
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,200
Didn't talk him into anything.

84
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,480
Martha, instant's fine.
My stomach's already freeze-dried.

85
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,600
What're you doing?

86
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,600
Got any milk?

87
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,600
Course I've got milk.

88
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,400
Thank God. I hate that powdered cream
shit. Tastes like mouse balls.

89
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,600
Wait!

90
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,800
What d'you want for breakfast?

91
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Beer.

92
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,200
Beer for breakfast? Horrible!

93
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,200
Breakfast beer. You never had it?

94
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,600
One sip of breakfast beer,
the cobwebs go, your voice rises,
and hey, the sun rises inside you.

95
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,800
Y'know, I got a case in the car.

96
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,800
Well, I hardly think that...

97
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,800
Um...

98
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,600
He leave?

99
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,600
He went to the car to get beer.

100
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,200
Good.

101
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,800
I could use one.

102
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,800
How can you stomach it
after all you had last night?

103
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,760
I work hard all week, I'm entitled
to cut loose at weekends.

104
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,800
You should try it. It'd do you good.

105
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,800
Fine, I'll come along tonight.

106
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,800
Forget it.

107
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,280
You might enjoy a woman's company.

108
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,200
Women, sure. Not a sister.

109
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,200
Besides, I date.

110
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,200
Yeah, I've seen those kind of women.

111
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,400
They snap gum for conversation.

112
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:21,280
Don't you want a point of view?

113
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,280
I want that I got the news.

114
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,280
David, piss up a rope!

115
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,800
What did I say?

116
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,800
Oh, just drink your coffee. >

117
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,000
Your friend seems... nice.

118
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,200
He's not my friend.
He's just someone I know.

119
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,000
We were in Vietnam together.

120
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,600
# Hey, hey, Opening Day!
Look out, trout, we're on our way. #

121
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:59,920
Careful, Martha, it's so cold
your tongue'll stick to the can.

122
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,920
Oh, Martha don't drink beer.

123
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,800
< Well, hey, it's early.

124
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,800
David.

125
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,880
< Thanks.

126
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,120
To Opening Day.

127
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,000
SHE LAUGHS
Oh, to trout.

128
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,600
To trout.

129
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,600
Trout.

130
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,400
Well, I like breakfast beer.

131
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,400
That's beautiful.
I'll crack you another.

132
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,600
I gotta go change if I'm coming too.

133
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,600
You coming?
Fish won't know what hit 'em.

134
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,600
Right, they'll jump into my lap,
to hear a woman's opinion.

135
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,800
OK, what'll it be?

136
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,800
Coffee.

137
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,800
And?

138
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,800
Coffee.

139
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,600
Ma'am, what's your name, ma'am?

140
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,800
Shirley.

141
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,800
May I be permitted
to call you Shirley, Shirley?

142
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,200
Be my guest.

143
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,200
Shirley, give this young lady
a pile of pancakes.

144
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,000
That's on me. Lady don't buy.

145
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,000
Pancakes. And for you, Sir Galahad?

146
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,600
Well, let's see.
I'll have...pancakes, too.

147
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,400
Pancakes.

148
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,400
Bacon.

149
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,800
Eggs over easy.

150
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,000
Bacon, eggs and pancakes.

151
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,000
Grapefruit,
bagel with cream cheese...

152
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,400
..and some cornflakes with banana.

153
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,080
Hungry?

154
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,080
If my eyes were basketballs, they
wouldn't be bigger than my stomach.

155
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,800
And, Shirley, can I have a
sardine sandwich while I'm waiting?

156
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,400
Thanks, Shirley.
Hey, it's Opening Day.

157
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,200
Anyone need to bleed the monster?
No facilities out there.

158
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,880
If you want to use the john, go now.

159
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,800
Excuse me.

160
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,600
Hey, old buddy.

161
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,200
You think your sister likes me?

162
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,200
Are you serious?

163
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,600
You two are from different planets.

164
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,800
She's just along to bust my ass.

165
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:35,000
Hey, I was gonna do that for you.

166
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm a biology teacher.
I think I can bait a hook.

167
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,600
How ya doin', ya big swingin' dick?
They bitin', huh? Huh?

168
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,200
Nothin'?

169
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,200
Nothin'. >

170
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,200
Do you ever catch fish, Joseph?

171
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,200
Martha, the only way
I'll ever do that is to drain a pond.

172
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,000
< We'll see.

173
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,320
Hey, stud.

174
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,680
You ain't said nothin' about the hat.

175
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,720
I wear it for luck.

176
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,480
Bad luck?

177
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,480
No way, Jose. It's Bobby's.

178
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,080
Didn't help Bobby much.

179
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,080
It's helpin' me.

180
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,200
They hide under rocks. Trout.

181
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,600
Goddam speckled bastards,
hide under rocks.

182
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,400
What kind of a life is that?

183
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,200
< Let's catch some fish.

184
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,600
< Hey, Martha, how we doin'?

185
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,800
Joseph...

186
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,800
I know they're out there, Martha.
I know they're there.

187
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,120
Oh! Aaah. Oh! I have one!
I have one, Joseph. I have a trout!

188
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,280
Shit! Reel him in.

189
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,280
I got one. There he is.

190
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,200
He's a rainbow. Reel him in.

191
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,600
What do I do now?

192
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,200
Did I lose... Where is he?

193
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,400
You got him. You got him. Here he is.

194
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,400
Look at him!

195
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,400
He's cousin to the Loch Ness Monster.

196
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,400
Joseph! Aaah! Joseph, no...!

197
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,200
Joseph, wait! Ah...!

198
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,480
HE LAUGHS
Perfect.

199
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,400
Good thing he threw the hook, Martha.
That baby was ready to take your leg.

200
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,800
Shit!

201
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,800
Oh, this fishing is
a wonderful time(!)

202
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Hey, Martha! >

203
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,800
There you go.

204
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,000
My wits are weak
but my back is strong.

205
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,160
Who said fishing would be easy?

206
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,200
Martha? You OK? >

207
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,800
< MUMBLING

208
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:42,400
I don't forget.
Jacknife's like an elephant.
Short on smarts, long on memory.

209
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,800
You sleep. Jacknife's on watch.

210
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,800
You sleep. >

211
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,680
Would you have him give me a buzz?
I started working at this garage.

212
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,000
If he wants, he can call or come by.

213
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,880
Shouldn't you give those a rest?

214
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,880
Jacknife! You gonna drive again?

215
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,800
No. I'm after Dave Flanagan.

216
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,800
He's up front.

217
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,800
This way?

218
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,800
Yeah.

219
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,000
Oh, yeah. No, I got no problem.
Oh, no. Hold on a second.

220
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,400
Be on time tomorrow.

221
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,600
Hey, Davey! Davey! How you doin'?

222
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,000
I suck.

223
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,000
Let's grab a beer.

224
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,600
Look, Megs...

225
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,600
Come on. Since when
ain't you thirsty? Since when?

226
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:49,000
What you doing here?

227
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:49,000
Seeing how you are. I got my car,
came over. It's about to fall apart.

228
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,800
So then she moved to Florida.

229
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,000
She thought Connecticut
was too cold or somethin'.

230
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,400
Maybe too many memories
of your old man here, huh?

231
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:16,360
It must've been tough, comin' back
on crutches to find your dad's dead.

232
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,800
Yeah, I was pissed.

233
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,400
His gung-ho vet shit
got me to enlist.

234
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,600
I'd been fantasizing about
decking that son of a bitch.

235
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,800
Boom!

236
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,800
Yeah, man, I felt cheated.

237
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,800
Boom, boom!

238
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,680
Boom, boom! You're outta here!

239
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:46,760
Y'know what I hated? Waitin'.

240
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,760
Yeah. Knowin' it was only time
till somethin' bad happened.

241
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,000
Fuck, yeah.

242
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:57,400
The only way I could handle it was
to get up for it. Know what I mean?

243
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,200
It was like something set in,
you know?

244
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,840
And not just me.
For a lot of us, maybe.

245
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,800
I was never there, Megs.

246
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,000
I don't follow that.

247
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,000
It never happened.

248
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,600
It's done with. >

249
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,400
Understand?

250
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,000
HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRR

251
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,200
Go, go, go, go!

252
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,600
Go, go, go, go, go!

253
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,360
We're hot at ten o'clock. Dead hot!

254
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,800
< Bobby, please!

255
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,800
Come on, Dave.

256
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,800
Come on.

257
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,560
Bobby, no!

258
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,560
< Get him outta here!

259
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,600
Bobby, don't! Please! Nooooooo!

260
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,200
(SCREAMS)

261
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,800
Ow! Ow! Owwwwwww!

262
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,080
Help me!

263
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,080
Help me! Come on!

264
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,080
Got my piece?

265
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,080
Got it. You OK, Davey?

266
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,080
My fucking leg!

267
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,800
Bobby?

268
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,000
GUNFIRE

269
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,200
HORN BEEPS

270
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,000
How long you been back?

271
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,000
A month, maybe.

272
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,280
Well... Yeah... I hooked up
with an old buddy of mine.

273
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,680
A vet?

274
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,800
Trying to give him a hand?

275
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,800
Shit, I got all I can do
to help me, man!

276
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,480
Ever wonder if
you get enough distance?

277
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,480
< Every damn day.

278
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,200
I dunno if I want to think about
what this guy makes me think about.

279
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,800
Makes me feel good
when my friends come to me.

280
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,000
Makes me know I'm not alone.

281
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,720
It's important that you know that.

282
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,120
< People alone,
they just waste away slow.

283
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,960
That's all people, not just vets.

284
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,400
Jake, this uh...

285
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:23,000
..this guy, he's got a sister.

286
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,000
Mm-hmm. Tell me about her.

287
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,880
What time d'you get in last night?

288
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,880
< Don't start!

289
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,800
Mother called.

290
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,800
Great.

291
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,320
How's Florida?

292
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,320
She wanted to talk to you.

293
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,600
Why? So you could get on
the extension and gang up on me?

294
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,480
Forget it.

295
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,800
Have a nice day.

296
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,800
Oh, your friend left you a number.

297
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,600
Who?

298
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,600
Joseph. I mean, Megs.

299
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,400
He's not my friend, Martha.

300
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,400
He wants you to call him.

301
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,400
He's not my friend.

302
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,400
SCHOOL BELL RINGS

303
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,800
Quiet, please.

304
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,800
CHATTER CONTINUES

305
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,800
Take your seats, everybody.

306
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,800
Would this entire class like to stay
after school with me for a month?

307
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,000
Thank you. Now, people,
open your books to page 550.

308
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,600
Bone structure.

309
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,400
Let's look at the Haversian canal.
What is bone tissue? Is it alive?

310
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,200
< (David. Oh, David.)

311
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,880
OK, start this sucker up.

312
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,840
There you go.

313
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,840
Zippety-do-dah!

314
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:08,000
How are you with foreign jobs?

315
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,000
If it's got wheels and an engine,
I'm your man.

316
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,600
What'll it be?

317
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,600
Oh, yes, um...

318
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,800
Is Joseph Megessey around?

319
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,080
Oh, Megs. Yeah.
Why don't you park over there?

320
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,360
Hey, Megs!

321
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,720
Yeah?

322
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,720
You got a visitor.

323
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,600
He's over there.

324
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,120
Hello, Joseph.

325
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,000
Oh, goddam, look what...

326
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,200
LAUGHTER

327
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,600
Shall we adjourn to the office?

328
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,800
Yes.

329
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,800
Right this way.

330
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,520
(Goons!)

331
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,880
Nice of you to stop by, Martha.

332
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,000
Wanna take a walk in the parking lot?

333
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,800
Yes.

334
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,800
Allow me.

335
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,800
Thank you.

336
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,800
This your car?

337
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,800
Yes.

338
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,400
Well, it's reliable.

339
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:20,000
You could use a little air.

340
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,000
Oh...

341
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,000
If you move to the pump I'll fix it.

342
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,400
Joseph, would you let me
buy you a coffee?

343
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,480
I'll be right back.

344
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,200
It's on me.
A lady don't buy if I'm around.

345
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,800
Clean up, Megs.
I gotta date with a lady!

346
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,200
You jealous dogs!
You dirty, jealous dogs!

347
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,800
QUIET CONVERSATION

348
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,000
Do you come here often?

349
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,000
Uh?

350
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,800
Do you come here often?

351
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,800
Oh, yeah. I pass it.

352
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,800
It's nice.

353
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,600
It's all right? It's OK?

354
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,600
It's lovely. Yes.

355
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,600
I'm not dressed right,
I should be dressed up.

356
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,600
You're fine.

357
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,000
I don't eat out much and stuff.

358
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,600
Do, er, your girlfriends
come and cook for you?

359
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:49,200
Is that like a real question
or are you just jerking my chain?

360
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,200
What?

361
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:56,000
No, I just...

362
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,000
What?

363
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm nervous. It's just conversation.

364
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,000
You're nervous?

365
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,000
Yes.

366
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,000
Me too.

367
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,400
Cocktails?

368
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,640
We were gonna have...
How about it, Martha?

369
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,200
I'll have a cocktail if you will.

370
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,200
Oh, sure.

371
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:22,000
Cocktails are good.

372
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,000
What kind, sir? Something elegant?

373
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,000
Elegant is good. Also.

374
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,000
How about a Bud, Martha?

375
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,200
Two Buds.

376
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,200
How about you, Martha? Boyfriends?

377
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,320
I bet you gotta fight 'em off.

378
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:50,000
No, I've given up the fight.

379
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,000
You? Come on. You're built
like a brick shithouse!

380
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,160
That's ridiculous.

381
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,160
I noticed right off...

382
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,160
Shh! No!

383
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,600
You've got the biggest...

384
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,600
Stop contradicting me!

385
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,280
I know what I am.

386
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,280
< Yeah? What's that?

387
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,400
Martha, some people get awful ugly
the minute they open their mouths.

388
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,800
Other people, like you, Martha,
they grow on ya.

389
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,480
You know 'em better, they get
better looking. Or so I think.

390
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm gonna need another one of these.

391
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:11,400
David said you were
in Vietnam together.

392
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,400
Yeah, basic right through we were.

393
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:20,120
He never talks about it.

394
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:20,120
No? I talk about it all the time.
To myself if no-one wants to listen.

395
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,000
Did you know his friend Bobby?

396
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:35,000
You like to drive? Hop in the car,
head off, just for the hell of it?

397
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,000
Sometimes.

398
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,800
How about Saturday?

399
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,200
Sure.

400
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,920
Martha, it's up ahead.

401
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,800
Hey, Bob. >

402
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,200
We were some trio,
Bobby, your brother and me.

403
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,680
They said I was the lucky one.

404
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,000
I ain't fooling. They used to say
"Lucky Megs". "Lucky Megs".

405
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,400
That all sort of ended
when we lost old Bobby.

406
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,000
You wouldn't have liked me
when I got home. I was crazy.

407
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,800
Always getting in fights. Dumb ones.

408
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,480
Gettin' the piss kicked out of me,
five against one. Not a nice time.

409
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,560
What it all got down to is, er...

410
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:46,800
..well, one night I was starin'
at the ceiling rafters, wondering
if they'd take my weight...

411
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,280
Don't laugh, or anything.

412
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,800
I prayed.

413
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,960
I felt better.

414
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
What was done was done,
I couldn't change it...

415
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,360
..but for some reason
we lost Bobby...

416
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,280
..and I had to make
that reason a good one...

417
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,000
..cos Bobby, he deserved it.

418
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,400
Right, Bob?

419
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,000
RADIO: FOOTBALL COMMENTARY

420
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,600
Thank you, sir.

421
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,200
< Sir, your change.

422
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,800
Martha.

423
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,400
Becoming quite a social butterfly,
aren't we, Sis?

424
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,680
Fishing trips, dinner dates...

425
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,160
..more parents' meetings?
He was a truck driver!

426
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,080
So are you,
I don't hold it against you.

427
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,080
He's crazy!

428
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,600
He was crazy before I knew him.
'Nam made him crazier.

429
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,800
He's spent more time in the can
than you could believe.

430
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,720
You wanna date? I'll set you up.
Plenty of guys owe me favours.

431
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,880
Fuck you, David!

432
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,880
What did I say?

433
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:33,800
What d'you care? Why this interest?

434
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,800
You're my sister.

435
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,800
Oh, I thought I was a housekeeper!

436
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:39,600
I can't remember the last time you
said, "Martha, how was your day?"

437
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,760
Or "Let's go out to eat somewhere.
Want to come to a party?"

438
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:51,000
I don't go to parties.

439
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:51,000
That's not the point!

440
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,000
All right, I'll take more interest.

441
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,800
We'll go to a movie, OK?

442
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,200
Martha!
Martha, he's bad news. He is!

443
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,160
(Fuck!)

444
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,800
TAPPING ON DOOR

445
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,400
Is it really so bad around here?

446
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,280
No, it's not so bad.

447
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,320
I love this place.

448
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,280
Every good memory I have is...

449
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,080
Maybe that's why I...

450
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,600
Sis, I'm gonna be more
appreciative from now on.

451
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,600
I promise.

452
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,280
You'll see.

453
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,520
David...

454
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,200
..the things I want,
you can't give me.

455
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,000
You're gonna leave?

456
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,560
Someday.

457
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,000
Keep her on the road, Flanagan.

458
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,200
Uh? Uh? Where've you been, stud?

459
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,600
Spanking the monkey
in the john? Uh?

460
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,360
Come on, let's go. Come on, Davey.
Come on. Get in.

461
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,520
Driving, huh? Yeah...!

462
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,800
Buyin' guys beers
you don't even know...

463
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,800
..money in the jukebox
so strange babes can dance.

464
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,200
Hardly anyone knows
when you come or go.

465
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,080
I ain't complainin'

466
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,080
Am I? Hey, keeps you occupied.

467
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:00,160
You ain't occupied,
you're like an empty house. Useless.

468
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:21,440
Me, I did so many whites, I was like,
hotter than sunshine, I was insane.

469
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,920
A madman. I'm seein' trolls
and leprechauns in the road.

470
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,680
< It was V did that. You know that.

471
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,440
I came back from 'Nam
a first-class head.

472
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,640
Now, I don't touch a thing.

473
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,640
Megs, don't talk.

474
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,040
Hey, all right!

475
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,840
Hey, awright!

476
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,920
Hey, how about some hoop?

477
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,240
Come on, I know you was
a stud ball player. Come on.

478
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,640
I'll take a look.

479
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,640
Yeah, I'll park this pig for you.

480
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,160
All right. Up!

481
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,160
Come on!

482
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,600
All right, over here, over here.

483
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,240
It's too much for me. You want in?

484
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,640
Right, I'm with you, you?

485
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,640
Yeah, the big guys.

486
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,640
OK, thanks, man!

487
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,440
Get in there!

488
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,440
OTHERS CHEER

489
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,240
< Aw, shit!

490
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,040
< Nail his ass!

491
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,640
You see that, huh?

492
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,440
Your buddy's got two already.

493
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,440
Hey, Jacknife. Come on, pal.

494
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,240
Megs, you playin'? Right.
You're with him, him and him.

495
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,440
Whoa!

496
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,440
Come on, Megs. Get off me!

497
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,240
< Two points!

498
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,240
God!

499
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,040
Back here.

500
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,160
Aaaaargghhh!

501
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,160
Shit. You OK?

502
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,240
David, let me help you.

503
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,240
NO!

504
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,840
OK, let me help you.

505
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,840
I said, just, NO!

506
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,640
Let's get outta here.

507
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,440
< Is he OK?

508
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,920
COME ON, LET'S GO! >

509
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,920
Sorry, guys.

510
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,560
How's it feeling?

511
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,560
It's OK.

512
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:21,240
Sorry I yelled.

513
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:21,240
Yelled? Shit! I been yelled at by
queers and ladies worse than that!

514
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,840
Nice sky, uh? Real pretty.

515
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,240
Yeah.

516
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:40,280
Remember the sunsets?
Over there? Beauties, huh?

517
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:49,440
Remember what Bobby said?
Without the helicopters
it could almost be Hawaii.

518
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,640
Remember him saying that? I do.

519
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,520
Remember when the three of us...

520
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,520
I don't want you seeing my sister.

521
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,320
Ain't that her decision?

522
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,320
No. Martha don't know
shit about guys.

523
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,640
She'd have trouble with a
perfect guy, let alone one like you.

524
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,040
What kind of a guy am I, Davey? Uh?

525
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,600
Hold out your hand.

526
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,440
Look at your hand.
Your fucking hand!

527
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:26,120
I ain't punched no glass
in a long time.

528
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,120
Yeah, I heard that before.

529
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:32,440
Look at me. Fat and happy. You never
seen me looking so good. Huh, guy?

530
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,240
You look the same as before... guy.

531
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,760
Yeah, and you look real good, too.

532
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,320
Fate's a funny thing. >

533
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,800
Slow down.

534
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,800
Think this is fast?

535
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,640
Slow down, Megs!

536
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,640
What the fuck's wrong?
I'm just a crazy bastard.

537
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,200
Don't care who I take with me.

538
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,000
Got something to live for lately?

539
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,240
Whoooo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoooo!

540
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,240
HE WHOOPS AND YELPS

541
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,440
Ahoooo! Ahooooo, ahooooo!

542
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,440
I got someplace to go.
You're coming with me.

543
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,640
I don't know, I don't know anymore.

544
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,840
You get fuck all from
looking over your shoulder, right?

545
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,680
Things would've changed
if people did. >

546
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,840
I know that... >

547
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,040
..but I'm not able to put it aside.

548
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,840
How long has it been?

549
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,640
My wife wants to know
what's my, er...

550
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,240
.."Hey, what's your problem?"

551
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:24,040
What do I tell her?
What do I tell my kids?

552
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:31,720
That at 10am I was there,
and at 10pm I was in California
trying to hitch home?

553
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,840
And nobody picked me up. >

554
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,840
I was in uniform
and nobody would pick me up.

555
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,320
Hey, now come on, stay.
You can just listen.

556
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,400
Davey! Davey! >

557
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,840
What can it hurt? Davey!

558
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:07,160
Davey!

559
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:07,160
Megs, don't let him pull you down.
Don't you let him do it to you!

560
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,040
Davey! Davey!

561
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,040
KNOCKING

562
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,240
Joseph!

563
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,240
Hi.

564
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,240
Hi.

565
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,960
Davey stop home?

566
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,960
No. Why, what's happened?

567
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,040
Uh, OK.

568
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,040
Joseph, wait! Are you hungry?

569
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,240
There are pangs.

570
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,240
Well, would you like some soup?

571
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,600
Soup is good.

572
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,720
Split pea with ham.
Home-made. I like to cook.

573
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,120
Hey, we're a team, cos I like to eat.

574
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,640
Hmm, china. They match, too.

575
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,240
I almost got a set once.

576
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:54,240
You got a plate for buying groceries,
but I didn't shop enough.

577
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,840
Go ahead and start.

578
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,840
I'll wait for you. I hate
to eat alone. You eat alone much?

579
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,960
Sometimes I eat with David,
but he eats alone.

580
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:15,440
I often correct papers while I eat.

581
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,440
I think you give too much homework.

582
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,840
Smells good. Good as Campbell's.
I ain't even tasted it and I like it.

583
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,640
Well, now you can.

584
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,640
I started too soon?

585
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,640
No, please, start.

586
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,840
Please. Oh, please.

587
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:39,840
No, don't. Don't, Joseph.
Joseph, please, don't...

588
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,640
Just get your hands off me, Joseph!

589
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:52,840
Martha. That's the thing
about shy people, Martha.

590
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,360
They think somebody's lookin',
but nobody is.

591
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,720
Except me and I like what I see.

592
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,720
For God's sake, shut up for once.

593
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,840
You're damn right. Yeah.

594
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,520
(Fuck!)

595
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,640
I'll pay for it. Don't worry, I will.

596
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,040
No...

597
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,040
I'll pay...

598
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:33,240
Shhh. Joseph, I liked the kiss.
Joseph, I liked the kiss.

599
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,840
I liked the kiss, Joseph.

600
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,840
I'm sorry, I'll pay for it.

601
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,840
Hush, now. I liked the kiss, Joseph.

602
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:14,440
Hello, Ed.

603
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,440
Why, Davey.

604
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,640
Can I...?

605
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,960
Please. Of course, yes.

606
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,840
Who is it, dear?

607
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,840
Pru and I were watching the news.

608
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,440
Pru, it's, er...

609
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,200
Why, Davey.

610
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,600
Sorry it's so late, Pru.

611
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,240
Nonsense.

612
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,040
Come in and sit with us.

613
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:57,040
Something to drink, Dave? Beer?

614
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,040
Yeah, please. >

615
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:17,080
Well, it's been quite a while.

616
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:17,080
Not so long. Dave shovelled the walk
for us after the snow in February.

617
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,840
< Oh, that's right.

618
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,840
If you want any help
I could come back again.

619
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,560
Mow the lawn, maybe.

620
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,240
Rake some leaves.

621
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,160
Oh, we have a service for that.

622
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,440
We'd appreciate that, Dave.

623
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,240
Do I really... look well?

624
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,040
Dave, is everything all right?

625
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,640
I doubt it. >

626
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,000
Thank you for your concern.

627
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,760
I'd like to come
and clean your yard again.

628
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:59,840
You've done that before. Why?

629
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,840
Why? I don't know why, Martha.

630
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,440
Well...

631
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,240
Come inside. We'll...

632
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,440
..we'll go upstairs.

633
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,440
Come on. Get... get...

634
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,880
Oh, my Go...

635
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,440
Jesus!

636
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,240
Come here.

637
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:49,360
William Green.
And we were such an unlikely pair.

638
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,440
He was tall and skinny...

639
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,440
..and I was, well, me.

640
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,720
You was pretty good.

641
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,560
We didn't know what we were doing.

642
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:13,040
Like two cars that hooked bumpers,
pushing and pulling at wrong times.

643
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:18,800
I shouldn't laugh, it was horrible.

644
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,400
We went to a cheap hotel.

645
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:28,040
He kept apologizing.
"I'm sorry, I'm so terribly sorry."

646
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,040
I think he hoped I'd change my mind.

647
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,480
And then he asked me to marry him.

648
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:44,880
He'd been to bed with me
so he thought he should.

649
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:52,880
But, you know, you didn't want to?

650
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,880
Well, I didn't sleep with him
so he'd marry me.

651
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:02,640
We would've
made each other miserable.

652
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:17,440
Um... it's getting late,
We better think about hitting it.

653
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:23,440
Martha, I can see myself out, y'know.

654
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,440
Oh, I can walk you to the door.

655
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,640
Well...

656
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,440
Hey.

657
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,640
Joseph?

658
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,640
Yeah?

659
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:46,240
The seniors' prom is on Saturday.
Will you take me?

660
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,240
Me?

661
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:51,840
You. I missed my own prom,
no-one asked me to go.

662
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,840
No? Huh.

663
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:58,840
I crashed mine. I wore a motor cycle
jacket, steel-toed boots, shades.

664
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,440
Stood there grinnin' at them tuxedos,
hopin' they'd try and throw me out.

665
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,240
Will you take me?

666
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,240
I don't know, Martha.

667
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,840
Hmm. Yeah, OK.

668
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,640
OK, I'm ready. Pass it up.

669
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,040
Oh, it's great.

670
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,520
Forty-two, regular.

671
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,440
Thirty-four.

672
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,320
Thirty.

673
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,920
May I help you, sir?

674
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,920
I'd like a, uh...

675
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:30,200
Something for a prom.

676
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,200
A prom. I have some suggestions.

677
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:36,040
Here's one. It's a wristlet.

678
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,840
Worn on the lady's wrist.

679
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,640

680
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,440
Martha! I'm home!

681
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,240
Joseph is taking me to a prom.

682
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,240
HE LAUGHS

683
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,640
Shall I put a TV dinner on for you?

684
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:35,440
Dad wouldn't let
that guy on the porch!

685
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,440
What, someone gentle and kind?

686
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,200
Turkey or Salisbury steak?

687
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:40,200
I've had it with him
hanging round you!

688
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,040
You listening to me?

689
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,040
Oh, I hear you!

690
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,440
Call him and say something came up.

691
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,240
The PTA.
The fucking Board of Education.

692
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:54,240
What's the matter with you?
He's a loser!

693
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:58,840
Go out and get drunk!

694
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:58,840
No way!

695
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,840
Then shut up! A loser?

696
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,640
You're a loser!
You're like a mould here.

697
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:07,640
You eat what's there then grunt
instead of speak. Shit.

698
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,440
Shit! >

699
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:16,240
I'd be better off with a dog.
I wouldn't have to worry
about a dog killing itself.

700
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:20,640
What's it like to want
only to get drunk at night?

701
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:26,240
I just want to be left alone.

702
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,240
By what? By life? You asshole!

703
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:31,840
You want me here so the house
isn't empty if you come home.

704
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:38,280
And I've been afraid for you.

705
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:38,280
Me? What about you?

706
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,280
OK, yes! I have been afraid for me.

707
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,440
But I've done it. I have stayed.

708
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,760
Well, no more. I am leaving.
Just like Mama.

709
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:55,040
She cried. Did you think
she was crying for Papa?

710
01:09:55,400 --> 01:10:00,440
It was for you. Because you
might as well have been dead, too.

Why you wearing those pants?

You a soldier?

724
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,840
Answer me. A kid like you,
you know how to fight?

01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:28,560
No. Kids don't know how to fight.
They don't know nothin' about it.

726
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,840
Take those off. You can't wear 'em.

727
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:38,440
TAKE OFF THE FUCKIN' PANTS!

some of your brandy.

818
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,320
Shall I tell you what brandy is?

819
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:40,240
Yeah. Please.

820
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:40,240
If beer for breakfast is sunrise,
then brandy is sundown.

821
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,400
Well, I can hardly get
a word in edgewise!

822
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:50,640
Sorry.

823
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:50,640
I don't want you sorry, Joseph.

824
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,240
I was just teasing, Joseph. >

825
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:04,040
You always tease me,
but can't tell you're being teased.

826
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,240
Teasing shows you're cared for,
don't you think?

827
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,040
I think so.

828
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:19,600
Let's go look for him, Martha.

829
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,600
Please, let's have our brandy.

830
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,040
Martha.

831
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:18,720
Ain't you the sight, stud?

832
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,720
Martha, I'm sorry.

833
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,240
Come on, sit down. Sit down.

834
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,240
Let's clean you up some. It's clean.

835
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:39,240
You know me -
I wipe my nose, I use my sleeve.

836
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,640
Oh...

837
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,640
Ow!

838
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:53,840
How could she understand, huh?
She wasn't there.

839
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:07,640
Jacknife?

840
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:07,640
That's my name.
That's what Bobby called me.

841
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,440
Cos you crashed trucks.

842
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:14,840
Have you told Martha
what your nickname was?

843
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:20,040
Come on. What'd Bobby call you?

844
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:26,640
David? What was your nickname?
I'd... I'd like to know.

845
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:34,640
"High School", cos he was all-league.
Bobby had nicknames for everything.

846
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:40,440
Bobby's was Red Sock,
cos he loved the Red Sox.

847
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,440
He was gonna take us to Fenway Park.

848
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,040
We were gonna cheer.

849
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:52,200
Aw, Bobby.
If he'd stayed he would've lived.

850
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,200
How many nights did I think that?

851
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:57,240
He didn't. He couldn't leave me
any more than he could leave you.

852
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:01,440
What were we gonna do
when we got back, huh?

853
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,840
Come on, help me, no matter what?
Come on. Tell me. You know.

854
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:11,640
Fuck, Davey, come on!

855
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,640
I don't know. Go to Fenway Park.

856
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:15,760
Best seats in the house, huh?

857
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,760
Yeah. Hot dogs and beer.

858
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:20,840
Green grass, fresh mowed.
Take off our shirts.

859
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,840
Soak up a few rays.

860
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:25,640
We were gonna cheer, huh?

861
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:25,640
We were gonna cheer
till they cheered us back.

862
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:29,080
And then?

863
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,080
Then we were gonna...

864
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,840
What, Davey? What?

865
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,840
David? >

866
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,160
What were you going to do?

867
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,240
We were gonna go fishing.

868
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:09,000
Opening Day.

869
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,720
Yeah...

870
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,840
Martha.

871
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,440
I'm so sorry.

872
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:16,360
I'm so so sorry.

873
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:20,240
I know you are, David.

874
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,640
You're leaving?

875
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,640
Thought I would.

876
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:10,000
Mission accomplished, right?

877
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:16,880
Martha, who are we kiddin'?
You, me, just ourselves.

878
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:16,880
We were having a wonderful time.

879
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:25,440
It doesn't have to end. If I fooled
myself I can do it a while longer.

880
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:28,240
I can't, Martha.

881
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,760
'I blame people.
I've been blaming people so much.'

882
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:27,200
And I've been hurting people.

883
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:32,080
That sucks.

884
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:41,560
'They're people that cared about me,
but I didn't... I thought...'

885
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:49,160
'No, I think, I think I don't
deserve them caring about me...

886
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,320
'..because...

887
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,440
..I don't like me very much.

888
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,000
'But hey, it's time.'

889
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:11,480
'If not for me, then for the people
that didn't stop loving me.'

890
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:16,800
'There was a guy, Bobby.'

891
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:23,000
There was another guy, Megs...

892
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,960
..and us three were friends.

893
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,760
I loved those guys like brothers. >

894
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:35,200
'Bobby was the smart one.'

895
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:38,520
'Megs was the crazy one.'

896
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:42,240
Me... >

897
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,840
..I was the scared one.

898
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,440
Bobby talked to you.

899
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,440
'He talked to you, sports...

900
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,040
'..books, girls.'

901
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:03,240
Bobby said that certain girls...

902
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:06,640
..they glowed.

903
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:13,280
And that when they touched you,
you weren't scared...

904
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,880
..or tired.

905
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:20,880
When they just stood next to you,
you weren't confused.

906
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,320
Bobby said we'd all
find girls like that.

907
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,960
'Then things would make sense,
just because you were with them.

908
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:32,640
'He said it would
happen to us all.'

909
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,360
Because we, er...

910
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:42,840
..because we all of us,
we deserved it.

911
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:20,240
HORN BEEPS

912
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:04,240
I bet we'd have had
a horrible time at that prom.

913
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:12,120
And we would've left early.

914
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:12,120
Gone someplace fancy for dinner.

915
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,120
No, we wouldn't have been hungry.

916
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,720
Maybe we would've driven someplace.

917
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,600
Someplace quiet and parked.

918
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,320
And then...

919
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:29,640
..who knows?

920
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,640
Who knows?
