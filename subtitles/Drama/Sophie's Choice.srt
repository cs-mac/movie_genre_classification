1
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:07,978
He's going to... Get them!

2
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:10,963
- I got it!
- Champagne is in the back!

3
00:00:10,964 --> 00:00:13,884
I couldn't remember Nathan's
brand when I went to the store.

4
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:16,887
- Yeah? What kind?
- The guy at the shop says...

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,890
something Rose.
He says it's very good.

6
00:00:23,977 --> 00:00:25,896
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

7
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:28,899
Is it your brand?
I couldn't remember.

8
00:00:33,987 --> 00:00:35,906
Stingo got you that champagne.

9
00:00:38,992 --> 00:00:40,911
That's sweet.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,618
It's beautiful.
Look at you.

11
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:46,621
- Yeah! Do you like?
- Very becoming.

12
00:00:46,904 --> 00:00:48,822
That would become you more.

13
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:52,927
- What?
- Haven't I told you...

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,930
that the only think I
absolutely demanded of you...

15
00:00:58,013 --> 00:01:00,932
the only single thing...
is fidelity?

16
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:07,638
And didn't I tell you that if you
ever were with this guy Kats...

17
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:12,642
ever again outside of work, and
if you walk with this cheap schmuck...

18
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:14,643
this fraud, that
I'd break your ass?

19
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:16,645
- Yeah, but.
- This afternoon he brings...

20
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:20,648
you home again. You spent the
whole fucking afternoon with him.

21
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:24,651
Or should, I say you spent the
whole afternoon with him fucking?

22
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:27,655
- Nathan!
- Did you try the new dress for him?

23
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:30,657
So he could strip it off
in a cheap hotel room?

24
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,660
Did he line up your vertebra
in a nice neat line...

25
00:01:34,743 --> 00:01:38,662
while he was humping you?
I bet he does quite a number.

26
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:40,664
Wait! Nathan!

27
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:44,668
How do you know he took her home?
Did you follow her?

28
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:47,670
How did you find out
Kats took her home?

29
00:01:47,753 --> 00:01:51,673
You're going to feel like a
fool when you find out why.

30
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:53,675
please, don't!

31
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,680
A baby southern artist
defending a little Pollack whore.

32
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:05,685
To bad our celebration will be of
more mundane stripe than I intended.

33
00:02:05,768 --> 00:02:09,687
- I think you should go.
- I'm not going to let you alone with him.

34
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,690
- You don't understand...
- You don't have to take this shit!

35
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:16,692
Let’s just cut out
all the ugly shit!

36
00:02:16,776 --> 00:02:19,695
Yeah, poor this. Let's
celebrate. You know why?

37
00:02:19,778 --> 00:02:22,698
We're here to toast you.
But what are we here to toast?

38
00:02:22,782 --> 00:02:25,701
- You're right. I'm terribly sorry.
- That's all right.

39
00:02:25,784 --> 00:02:27,702
I don't know what's
come over me. Here...

40
00:02:28,786 --> 00:02:30,704
Here is to my best friend...

41
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:34,708
- and my best girl.
- There you are.

42
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,709
Look what I got you, anyway.

43
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:44,715
I had the wrapping,
you know, but I...

44
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,719
It's beautiful.
Very beautiful.

45
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:53,724
- Do you like it?
- If I like it? I love it.

46
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,726
Yes? She’s just like Stingo's.

47
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:58,727
It is?

48
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:04,731
- It has an engraving.
- It's beautiful. Beautiful.

49
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:11,737
This toast is in honor...

50
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:15,740
my complete disassociation...

51
00:03:15,823 --> 00:03:17,742
from you two creeps.

52
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:19,743
Disassociation from you...

53
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:22,745
the Coony Chiropractic cunt
of King's County...

54
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,748
and you, the dreary dregs of Dixie.

55
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,754
You have not fooled me,
young Stingo.

56
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,758
Since you so graciously allowed me to
read your magnum Southern opus...

57
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:42,761
about your adolescent self-pity...

58
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:46,765
- for your poor dead mother.
- Knock it off, Nathan.

59
00:03:46,848 --> 00:03:49,767
However, look on it optimistically...

60
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,769
you might be on the verge
of a whole new form...

61
00:03:52,852 --> 00:03:54,772
the "Southern Comic Book"!

62
00:03:55,855 --> 00:03:57,774
- And now, my sweet...
- Stin...

63
00:03:57,857 --> 00:04:02,778
I want to ask you one question that's
been burning in my mind for so long.

64
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:05,781
Then maybe you can
explain something to me.

65
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:09,783
The reason maybe
of why you are here...

66
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,785
Wait...

67
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:13,786
walking the streets...

68
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:16,788
wearing this enticing perfumery...

69
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:23,794
engaged in syrup tissue's
winery with not one...

70
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,799
but two, count them,
ladies and gentlemen...

71
00:04:30,883 --> 00:04:32,802
two chiropractors!

72
00:04:33,885 --> 00:04:35,805
In short, making hay...

73
00:04:35,888 --> 00:04:39,808
waiting the sunshine
to employ an old maid...

74
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:44,811
while at Auschwitz, the ghosts
of the millions of the dead...

75
00:04:44,894 --> 00:04:46,813
- still seek an answer.
- No.

76
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:48,814
Tell me...

77
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:52,818
Tell me Sophie.
The same anti-Semitism...

78
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:56,822
for which Poland has gained
such a worldwide recognition...

79
00:04:56,905 --> 00:05:00,824
that this similar anti-Semitism guide
your own destiny, help you along...

80
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:04,827
protect you in a manner of speaking
so you became one of the minuscule..

81
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,830
handful of people who lived...
while the millions died?

82
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,835
Tell me. Tell me why.

83
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,838
Explanation, please!

84
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:20,840
Tell me why...

85
00:05:20,923 --> 00:05:23,842
old lucky number 11379...

86
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,846
Tell me...

87
00:05:26,929 --> 00:05:30,849
why you inhabit the
land of the living?

88
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,852
What splendid little
tricks and strategies...

89
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:38,854
is inside that lovely head of
yours to allow you to breath...

90
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,856
the clear polish air?

91
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,860
What a multitude at Auschwitz
choked slowly...

92
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:47,862
- on the gas?
- No!

93
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:49,863
- Explain!
- Stop it!

94
00:05:49,947 --> 00:05:51,865
Explain!

95
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:54,867
- Lay off of her!
- Get off of my way!

96
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:56,869
Get off of my...

97
00:05:57,954 --> 00:05:59,871
Stay away!
Stay out!

98
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:03,875
Stay out! Get out of here!

99
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,877
Go away!

100
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:11,881
I'm leaving the house, they're here.
I come back, two empty rooms.

101
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:15,884
No Nathan, no Sophie and the last
anybody knows he puts her in a cab..

102
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:19,887
and he runs off the other way.
I can't tell how hard it is...

103
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:21,889
- Is this Dr. Blackstock?
- Yes.

104
00:06:21,973 --> 00:06:25,892
I'm a friend of Sophie Zawistowska's
and you may have heard of me, Stingo

105
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:28,895
Oh, the writer!
She's very proud of you!

106
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,898
- I'm trying to track her down.
- But don’t you live in the same house?

107
00:06:33,982 --> 00:06:35,900
She moved out last night.

108
00:06:35,985 --> 00:06:40,904
She called in this morning and wasn't
well. I was worried about her.

109
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:44,907
- She is such a tough girl.
- Do you know how I could find her?

110
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,909
What about the boyfriend?

111
00:06:46,993 --> 00:06:48,910
I think that's over.

112
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:51,912
Maybe she went to
stay with a friend.

113
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,916
I don't know any friends of hers.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,920
There's this Polish girl who work
for a professor at Brooklyn College.

115
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,923
I remember her name.
It was Sonja Wajinska.

116
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,925
Is a woman named
Sonja Wajinska work here?

117
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:11,929
No, I'm sorry. She went back
to Poland six months ago.

118
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:14,931
But if you like,
I can give you her address.

119
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:18,934
Thank you. Do you know
her friend Sophie Zawistowska?

120
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:19,935
Yes.

121
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:24,938
She came here once to visit
Sonja, but she did not came back.

122
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:31,945
I recognized her from my days
at the University of Krakow.

123
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:34,948
She is the daughter of
professor Bieganski.

124
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:36,949
Were you student of his?

125
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:40,952
I heard him lecture once.
That was enough.

126
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:45,956
I know he is very
unspoken about the Nazis.

127
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,958
He was crazy about the Nazis.

128
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:52,961
I think because they hate
the Jews as much as he did.

129
00:07:54,046 --> 00:07:55,963
The Nazis killed him.

130
00:07:57,048 --> 00:08:00,968
They came one day and made a
clean sweep of all academics.

131
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:04,972
And they didn't stop to
check their political views.

132
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:06,973
I think you have the wrong man.

133
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:10,976
Look, I shall show you...

134
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,984
Zbigniew Bieganki...

135
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,990
Look, Bieganski...

136
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,993
professor of Law at
the University of Krakow...

137
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:34,995
from 1919 to 1939...

138
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:37,998
known for his anti-Semitic threats.

139
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:43,002
A major promulgator of
the ghetto pension rule...

140
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:46,004
which made it illegal
for Jewish students...

141
00:08:46,088 --> 00:08:49,006
to seat on the
same bench as polls.

142
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:51,007
So...

143
00:08:56,096 --> 00:08:58,013
I told Yetta I was leaving.

144
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,019
A few weeks before I had
received a letter from my father.

145
00:09:04,103 --> 00:09:08,021
He had inherited a small farm and
knowing I was running out of money

146
00:09:08,105 --> 00:09:12,025
proposed that I'd come
back South and live on it.

147
00:09:12,109 --> 00:09:15,027
I could not bear
to stay in Brooklyn.

148
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,039
Hello!

149
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:34,043
Hello!

150
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:37,045
Sophie? You're back!

151
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:39,046
Oh, yes. Hello, Yetta.

152
00:09:41,132 --> 00:09:44,050
I came to get the rest
of my things, you know?

153
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:48,054
- Have you heard from Nathan?
- No. Not a word.

154
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:53,057
He just came here this morning
to take the rest of his things.

155
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:55,059
OK.

156
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:58,061
OK.

157
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:03,065
Stingo?

158
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:08,070
Yeah.

159
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:25,083
I'm sorry about what
happened last night.

160
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,085
But I want you to
know that Nathan...

161
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,088
didn't mean what he
said about your book.

162
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:38,094
Well, you know that. Right?

163
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,098
I know he really
loves your writing.

164
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:47,101
That doesn't matter anymore.

165
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,108
But I mean...

166
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:59,110
"we" will still be friends.

167
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:06,116
You know I'm leaving.
I'm going home.

168
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:12,120
It should be a better
place for me to write.

169
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,123
We've driven you away.

170
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,126
It has nothing to do with you.

171
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:34,139
I spoke with
Dr. Blackstock today.

172
00:11:40,227 --> 00:11:43,145
Oh, Stingo.
Did you go looking for me there?

173
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:46,147
I would've left you a
note where I went but...

174
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:50,151
I just didn't think of it.
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:54,154
I'm sorry you were worried about me.

176
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,158
I thought your friend Sonja
might know where you were.

177
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:06,165
Sonja? Sonja Wajinski?
But she went back to Poland.

178
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:09,167
I know that.

179
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:13,169
I went to Brooklyn College.

180
00:12:17,256 --> 00:12:20,174
She used to work for a
Language professor there.

181
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:21,175
Yes.

182
00:12:25,263 --> 00:12:27,180
I think you met him once.

183
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,187
He knew your father.

184
00:12:37,272 --> 00:12:39,192
Yeah, my father...

185
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,198
He heard him lecture once...

186
00:12:49,282 --> 00:12:52,201
at the University of Krakow
where your father taught.

187
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:55,203
He told you about my father?

188
00:12:57,289 --> 00:12:59,207
Sophie, why did you lie to me?

189
00:13:04,295 --> 00:13:06,213
I lied because, you know why?

190
00:13:06,296 --> 00:13:09,215
I was so afraid...

191
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:12,217
I was afraid I'd left alone!

192
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:17,222
So...

193
00:13:31,316 --> 00:13:34,236
Good bye... my friend.

194
00:14:15,351 --> 00:14:17,269
Sophie, I want to understand...

195
00:14:24,358 --> 00:14:26,277
I'd love to know the truth.

196
00:14:29,362 --> 00:14:31,280
The truth?

197
00:14:32,364 --> 00:14:35,284
It does not make it
easier to understand.

198
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,291
And maybe you think that
find out the truth about me...

199
00:14:44,374 --> 00:14:49,295
and you'll understand me and then
you'd forgive me for all those...

200
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,299
For all my lies.

201
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:58,302
I promise I'll never leave you.

202
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:01,304
You must never promise that.

203
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:06,309
No one... no one should
ever promise that!

204
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,320
The truth? I don't even
know what is the truth.

205
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:27,325
After all these lies I've told...

206
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:44,339
My father...

207
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:57,349
How can I explain how
much I loved my father?

208
00:16:04,437 --> 00:16:09,360
My father believed that human
perfection was a possibility.

209
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:14,363
Every night
I pray to God...

210
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:19,367
to forgive me for always making
a disappointment to my father.

211
00:16:21,451 --> 00:16:23,370
And I pray to him...

212
00:16:24,454 --> 00:16:27,373
to make worthy of
such a great good man.

213
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,378
I was a grown woman.

214
00:16:35,463 --> 00:16:39,383
I was wholly come of age.
I was a married woman...

215
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:44,387
when I realized I hated my father
beyond all words to tell it.

216
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:51,392
It was winter of 1938.

217
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:59,399
And my father was working for
weeks on the speech he calls...

218
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:02,401
"Poland Jewish Problem".

219
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:09,407
Orderly I typed those speeches...

220
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,409
and I don't hear the words,
their meaning, but...

221
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:19,415
this time I came upon a word
that I have never heard it before.

222
00:17:30,506 --> 00:17:35,428
The solution for Poland
Jewish Problem, he concludes...

223
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:37,430
is "vernichtung".

224
00:17:41,516 --> 00:17:43,434
Extermination.

225
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,440
I have not meant to go
to the ghetto that afternoon...

226
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:53,442
but something made me go there.

227
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:58,446
I stood there
I don't know how long...

228
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:02,449
watching these people that my
father has condemned to die.

229
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:08,455
All these men, these women,
these children would be "vernichtung".

230
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,458
Extermination.

231
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:18,462
I suddenly remembered that my father
is waiting for that speech...

232
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:22,465
and I hurry home to
finish the typing but...

233
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:27,469
in my rushing and my
haste to finish that...

234
00:18:27,552 --> 00:18:31,472
I make so many mistakes
in the sentences and...

235
00:18:33,557 --> 00:18:37,477
I run with it to the University
and my father has no time...

236
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,479
to check that before speaking.

237
00:18:39,562 --> 00:18:42,482
And he get up in front
of all those people...

238
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:47,486
and he reads the speech
and makes those mistakes...

239
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:50,488
and I see him getting so angry.

240
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:54,491
And when it was over,
he came up to me...

241
00:18:55,574 --> 00:18:58,493
I was with my husband, of course.

242
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:03,498
And in front of him and all
his colleague he said:

243
00:19:05,582 --> 00:19:07,502
Zozia...

244
00:19:08,585 --> 00:19:11,505
your intelligence is pulp.

245
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,509
pulp.

246
00:19:19,594 --> 00:19:24,515
I didn't have any courage to say:
"Yes, but what about the Jews?"

247
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:26,516
The Jewish people, but...

248
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,520
After that he didn't
trust me anyway.

249
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:34,523
And neither did my husband.

250
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:51,537
Afterwards in Warsaw...

251
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:54,539
I had lover...

252
00:19:56,623 --> 00:19:58,542
who was very, very good to me.

253
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:08,551
Josef lived with his
half-sister Wanda.

254
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:11,553
She was a leader
in the Resistance.

255
00:21:26,695 --> 00:21:28,614
Two weeks later...

256
00:21:29,697 --> 00:21:31,616
the Gestapo killed Josef.

257
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:34,619
They cut his throat.

258
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:39,623
They had courage.

259
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,626
Oh, God, they had courage!

260
00:21:48,713 --> 00:21:51,632
Not too long after that,
they killed Josef...

261
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:53,634
I was arrested.

262
00:21:54,718 --> 00:21:57,637
My children were sent
with me to Auschwitz.

263
00:22:01,723 --> 00:22:04,642
When the train arrived
at Auschwitz...

264
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:08,645
the Germans made the selection.

265
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,650
Who would live and who would die.

266
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:16,653
Ian, my little boy...

267
00:22:42,757 --> 00:22:46,677
Ian, my little boy,
was sent to the "Kinderlogg"...

268
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:49,679
which was the children's camp.

269
00:22:53,766 --> 00:22:57,685
And my little girl, Eva,
was sent to crematorium II.

270
00:23:02,773 --> 00:23:04,691
She was exterminated.

271
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,698
Thanks to my perfect German...

272
00:23:13,782 --> 00:23:16,700
and my secretarial skills...

273
00:23:16,784 --> 00:23:19,703
and the things my father
had taught me...

274
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:21,705
so well.

275
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,707
I came to work...

276
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:28,710
for Rudolf Hoess...

277
00:23:28,794 --> 00:23:31,712
Commandant of Auschwitz.

278
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:37,717
The day they took me
to work for Hoess...

279
00:23:38,802 --> 00:23:41,721
I was forced to walk
pass block 25...

280
00:23:41,805 --> 00:23:45,724
That is where they took
the prisoners that were...

281
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:47,725
selected for extermination.

282
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:53,730
The people there were made
to stand for, sometimes, days.

283
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:57,733
They were naked
and they had no water.

284
00:23:58,818 --> 00:24:01,736
And their hands
reached out from the bars...

285
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,738
and they cried and pleaded.

286
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:17,881
But that night...

287
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:21,885
I kept repeating to myself...

288
00:45:24,011 --> 00:45:26,888
"I have saved my son,
I have saved my son".

289
00:45:28,014 --> 00:45:29,891
"Tomorrow I can see him!"

290
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,896
"And I can tell him good bye".

291
00:45:36,022 --> 00:45:37,898
"And he will have been saved".

292
00:45:39,024 --> 00:45:41,901
Oh, my God, I had such
happiness that night!

293
00:45:44,027 --> 00:45:45,904
Such hope!

294
00:45:48,031 --> 00:45:50,908
But Hoess did not keep his word.

295
00:45:55,036 --> 00:45:58,914
I never did know what
happened to my little boy.

296
00:46:07,047 --> 00:46:09,924
So, you know, that's
why I didn't want to...

297
00:46:11,049 --> 00:46:12,926
to live no more.

298
00:46:21,058 --> 00:46:22,934
Till Nathan came and...

299
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,936
he made me live for him.

300
00:46:39,072 --> 00:46:40,949
Live for me, Sophie.

301
00:46:43,075 --> 00:46:44,952
Live for me.

302
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,957
Oh, my God! What have
we done to you?

303
00:47:50,129 --> 00:47:52,005
Be careful!

304
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:54,006
Stingo!

305
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:57,009
Nathan, put down the chair!
This is no time for fun!

306
00:47:58,134 --> 00:48:01,011
- put down the chair!
- put down the chair.

307
00:48:16,149 --> 00:48:19,026
- Stingo!
- Oh, telephone.

308
00:48:20,152 --> 00:48:23,030
It's Dr. Landau,
Nathan's brother.

309
00:48:24,156 --> 00:48:26,032
Thank you.

310
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,038
Hello, this is Larry.
- Nathan's brother.

311
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:36,040
- Yes, Larry!
- Nathan has talked about you.

312
00:48:36,165 --> 00:48:40,044
- I know you’ve been friends.
- He has talked about you.

313
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:44,047
Is that possible for us
to arrange a meeting?

314
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:47,049
Sure. Just tell when and where.

315
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,051
My brother thinks the world of you.

316
00:48:52,178 --> 00:48:55,055
I've never met anybody more
brilliant than Nathan.

317
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,058
- He's such a breath at knowledge.
- You're right.

318
00:49:00,184 --> 00:49:03,061
He is convinced
you're going to be a...

319
00:49:03,186 --> 00:49:06,064
major writer, something
he wants me to be.

320
00:49:06,189 --> 00:49:08,066
please, sit down.

321
00:49:08,191 --> 00:49:11,068
Seems to me, he's got to
do everything he chooses.

322
00:49:11,193 --> 00:49:15,072
He's told you and Sophie
that he is a research biologist.

323
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,077
At Pfizer.

324
00:49:26,205 --> 00:49:27,080
This...

325
00:49:30,207 --> 00:49:32,085
biologist business...

326
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,087
is my brother's masquerade.

327
00:49:34,212 --> 00:49:38,090
He has no degree of any kind.
All that is a simple fabrication.

328
00:49:42,218 --> 00:49:44,094
The truth is, he's quite mad.

329
00:49:49,224 --> 00:49:52,101
- Christ!
- One of those conditions where...

330
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:56,104
weeks, months, even years go by
without any manifestations.

331
00:49:56,229 --> 00:50:00,107
He has a job at Pfizer
in the company library.

332
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:03,109
an undemanding sinecure I got for him
where he can do a lot of reading...

333
00:50:03,235 --> 00:50:07,114
without bothering anyone and
he does a little research...

334
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,116
for one the legitimate
biologist on the staff.

335
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:15,119
I'm not sure Nathan would forgive
me if he knew that I told you.

336
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:18,121
He made me swear never to tell
Sophie. She knows nothing.

337
00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:24,127
The cruelest joke is that
he was born the perfect child.

338
00:50:24,253 --> 00:50:26,128
He excelled in everything.

339
00:50:27,255 --> 00:50:30,131
Even Nathan's teachers would
speculate on what he would achieve.

340
00:50:31,258 --> 00:50:33,133
See, he was the kind of child...

341
00:50:35,261 --> 00:50:38,138
everyone is prepared
to take the credit for.

342
00:50:40,266 --> 00:50:43,142
When he was 10,
we were told that the...

343
00:50:43,268 --> 00:50:46,144
child genius was a
paranoid schizophrenic

344
00:50:48,272 --> 00:50:51,148
From then on, the only
schools he attended were...

345
00:50:52,275 --> 00:50:54,150
expensive funny farms.

346
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,155
What can I do?

347
00:51:01,282 --> 00:51:04,158
If he could stay off the drugs...

348
00:51:04,284 --> 00:51:06,160
he might have a chance.

349
00:51:07,287 --> 00:51:09,163
Drugs? What is he on?

350
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:13,165
Benzedrine, cocaine.

351
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:16,169
- You didn't know?
- No, I did not.

352
00:51:18,296 --> 00:51:20,171
I want you to spy on him.

353
00:51:20,297 --> 00:51:23,173
But if you could simply
keep tabs on him...

354
00:51:23,299 --> 00:51:26,176
and report back to me
by phone from time to time...

355
00:51:26,302 --> 00:51:28,177
letting me know how he's getting on.

356
00:51:32,307 --> 00:51:35,183
I'm sorry to have to
involve you this way.

357
00:51:36,311 --> 00:51:38,186
I don't think you understand.

358
00:51:40,314 --> 00:51:42,189
I love them both.

359
00:51:45,317 --> 00:51:47,192
They're friends of mine.

360
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,216
Good morning, Mr. Stingo.

361
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:19,219
We were afraid something terrible
might have happened to you.

362
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:23,222
Miss Sophie was all for
having me institute a search.

363
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:31,229
- You indeed look ravishing
- Thank you, very much.

364
00:52:32,354 --> 00:52:35,231
So, what you all
want to do this evening?

365
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,235
Come, darling.

366
00:52:40,361 --> 00:52:44,240
This was Nathan's idea to surprise
you with a Southern evening.

367
00:52:44,365 --> 00:52:47,242
Your book has wet my appetite
to know about the South.

368
00:52:47,367 --> 00:52:49,243
And about the trip, too.

369
00:52:49,368 --> 00:52:53,246
Miss Sophie and I have been
discussing the possibility of...

370
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:57,249
taking a tour to your
beloved Dixie in October.

371
00:52:57,374 --> 00:53:01,253
And I've been thinking, if it's
all right with Miss Sophie...

372
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:02,254
Sure.

373
00:53:03,379 --> 00:53:06,256
...that maybe we could
make a wedding trip...

374
00:53:08,384 --> 00:53:11,261
and have you join us not
just as our best friend...

375
00:53:12,387 --> 00:53:14,263
but as my best man.

376
00:53:38,408 --> 00:53:40,285
I have the honor...

377
00:53:43,412 --> 00:53:47,289
to request your hand in marriage.

378
00:53:52,419 --> 00:53:54,295
To have and to hold...

379
00:53:57,423 --> 00:53:59,299
from this day forth...

380
00:54:01,425 --> 00:54:03,302
till death us do part.

381
00:54:10,434 --> 00:54:12,310
With this ring...

382
00:54:13,436 --> 00:54:15,312
I be true myself to you.

383
00:54:40,457 --> 00:54:44,336
Believe it, it's traditional
for the groom to give a gift...

384
00:54:44,461 --> 00:54:46,337
to the best man.

385
00:54:56,469 --> 00:55:00,348
I told Nathan that you'd have
to put that book away...

386
00:55:00,473 --> 00:55:04,351
for a while to make money
and that made him very said.

387
00:55:12,483 --> 00:55:15,360
Nathan, I can't
possibly accept this.

388
00:55:15,485 --> 00:55:17,362
Stingo, don't reject this.

389
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:22,366
Don't waste your talent.

390
00:55:25,493 --> 00:55:28,370
I don't know how to thank you.

391
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:31,372
Future Mrs. Landau...

392
00:55:31,497 --> 00:55:33,374
give me the honor of this dance.

393
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:17,076
It's not really about Nathan.

394
00:56:18,535 --> 00:56:20,412
What do you mean?

395
00:56:20,537 --> 00:56:22,413
You don't know?

396
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,417
It's supposed to be a secret.

397
00:56:28,544 --> 00:56:32,421
He confided in me that
he and his team...

398
00:56:32,546 --> 00:56:35,423
discovered a cure for polio...

399
00:56:36,549 --> 00:56:38,426
in my house.

400
00:56:39,551 --> 00:56:43,431
If only my Saul could
have lived to see the day.

401
00:56:43,556 --> 00:56:46,433
- The car is ready, Mrs. Zimmerman.
- I'll be down.

402
00:56:46,558 --> 00:56:48,435
What did Nathan say
when he saw you?

403
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,437
I haven't seem him.

404
00:56:52,563 --> 00:56:55,440
He and Sophie left here
a couple hours ago.

405
00:56:55,565 --> 00:57:00,444
He said he'd look for you and
straighten things out once and for all.

406
00:57:00,569 --> 00:57:03,446
- Wait, what?
- I guess you just missed them.

407
00:57:03,571 --> 00:57:07,449
Sophie said he was imagining
things trying to soothe him...

408
00:57:07,574 --> 00:57:09,451
the way she does
when he gets like that.

409
00:57:09,576 --> 00:57:12,454
God knows what was going
through his mind now.

410
00:57:12,579 --> 00:57:14,455
I told you to watch out.

411
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:16,457
Next time you'll listen to me.

412
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:20,460
I got better things to do.

413
00:57:20,585 --> 00:57:23,462
- Do you know where he is now?
- I don't know.

414
00:57:48,607 --> 00:57:51,484
- Hello.
- God damn you to hell forever.

415
00:57:53,612 --> 00:57:54,487
Nathan?

416
00:58:02,618 --> 00:58:04,495
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes. I'm all right.

417
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:08,497
- What's wrong with your arm?
- He was breaking my arm.

418
00:58:08,622 --> 00:58:12,502
I got frightened and I ran away.
He has a gun, Stingo.

419
00:58:13,628 --> 00:58:15,504
I think he's going to use it.

420
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:18,506
I shouldn't have left him there.

421
00:58:19,632 --> 00:58:21,509
We should go find...

422
00:58:21,634 --> 00:58:23,510
- Nathan?
- Stingo.

423
00:58:24,636 --> 00:58:26,513
Now you listen. Listen to me.

424
00:58:26,638 --> 00:58:28,515
Is he good? Nathan!

425
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,516
- Oh, God!
- Nathan!

426
00:58:31,642 --> 00:58:33,518
My darling, will you forgive me?

427
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:38,522
- Get off that phone, you whore!
- You know that I love you.

428
00:58:38,647 --> 00:58:40,523
I don't want to speak to you again!

429
00:58:40,648 --> 00:58:43,526
Nathan, we love you
very much, all right?

430
00:58:44,653 --> 00:58:46,529
We'd do nothing to hurt you.

431
00:58:47,655 --> 00:58:49,531
Now you tell us where you are.

432
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:53,534
God damn you to hell
forever for betraying me...

433
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:57,537
behind my back, you whom I trust
like the best friend I ever had.

434
00:58:58,663 --> 00:59:02,542
and that shit-eating grin
of yours day after day?

435
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:06,544
Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth when
you gave me your manuscript to read.

436
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:09,547
"Ah, gee, Nathan. Thank you so much".
When not 15 minutes earlier...

437
00:59:09,672 --> 00:59:14,551
you'd been in bed with the
woman I was going to marry.

438
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,553
Marry! Marry!

439
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:20,556
I'd burn in hell before I'd marry
a two-timing Pollack...

440
00:59:20,681 --> 00:59:25,560
who'd spread her legs for a Southern
shit- ass betraying me like that.

441
00:59:25,685 --> 00:59:28,562
We're going to come get you.
Where are you?

442
00:59:28,687 --> 00:59:33,566
Don't come. Stay where you
are. I'm going to come get you.

443
00:59:33,691 --> 00:59:36,569
- Both of you.
- Jesus?, Nathan!

444
00:59:36,694 --> 00:59:40,572
Don’t go away.
You know what am I going to do...

445
00:59:40,697 --> 00:59:43,825
to you deceitful, unspeakable pigs.
Listen!

446
00:59:45,701 --> 00:59:48,578
- Now I'm going to get you.
- Oh, God!

447
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,997
I called his brother's office.

448
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,000
Larry is in Toronto.
They're going to try to reach him.

449
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:56,960
I should've stayed there.

450
01:00:00,713 --> 01:00:02,589
Maybe I could've helped him.

451
01:00:04,716 --> 01:00:06,592
He's never been this bad before.

452
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:11,597
I think he could've killed us.

453
01:00:13,724 --> 01:00:17,602
- I think he could've killed us both.
- I don't care that I'll die.

454
01:00:19,728 --> 01:00:21,605
I'm afraid that he'll die
without me.

455
01:00:38,743 --> 01:00:39,618
Thank you.

456
01:01:02,763 --> 01:01:03,638
Stingo.

457
01:01:05,765 --> 01:01:08,642
Where are we going?

458
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:15,648
Well, I want to take you to
see the Washington sights.

459
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:17,649
We'll go by the White House.

460
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:20,652
We may get a pick Harry Truman

461
01:01:23,779 --> 01:01:24,655
I mean...

462
01:01:26,782 --> 01:01:28,658
where are we going?

463
01:01:29,784 --> 01:01:31,660
Where are we really going?

464
01:01:32,786 --> 01:01:35,663
Well, I'm going to take you
down to that farm...

465
01:01:35,788 --> 01:01:38,666
that I told about,
in South of Virginia.

466
01:01:45,797 --> 01:01:48,674
I think once we get
settled in there we can...

467
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,676
drive over to Richmond...

468
01:01:50,801 --> 01:01:53,678
get a good phonograph
and buy some records.

469
01:01:55,805 --> 01:01:58,682
What do you mean
"get settled in there?"

470
01:02:00,809 --> 01:02:01,684
Well...

471
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:04,687
I love you very much, Sophie.

472
01:02:06,813 --> 01:02:08,689
And I...

473
01:02:09,815 --> 01:02:11,693
I want to marry you.

474
01:02:14,821 --> 01:02:17,698
I want you to live
in that farm with me.

475
01:02:19,824 --> 01:02:22,701
I want to write my books,
I want you to help me...

476
01:02:22,826 --> 01:02:24,703
raise a family...

477
01:02:26,829 --> 01:02:28,707
because I...

478
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:30,708
I love you very, very much.

479
01:02:32,834 --> 01:02:35,712
Is it too much to hope you might...

480
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:40,715
you might love me too?

481
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:53,726
Listen, Stingo, I'm...

482
01:02:53,851 --> 01:02:56,728
beyond 30 years now, you know?

483
01:02:56,853 --> 01:03:00,731
What are you going to do with
an old polish lady like me?

484
01:03:00,856 --> 01:03:01,732
Manage!

485
01:03:02,858 --> 01:03:05,736
Manage.
"Old woman"...

486
01:03:07,862 --> 01:03:09,739
Don't talk that way. You...

487
01:03:10,864 --> 01:03:12,741
You're always going to be...

488
01:03:15,869 --> 01:03:17,745
my number one.

489
01:03:24,876 --> 01:03:27,753
Well, then yes.
We could go down there. Sure.

490
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,757
We could live there
for a while and then...

491
01:03:32,882 --> 01:03:36,760
We're not getting married
because we could decide that later.

492
01:03:37,886 --> 01:03:38,762
Sophie...

493
01:03:39,888 --> 01:03:43,766
In that little country place
that we'd be living in...

494
01:03:43,891 --> 01:03:45,767
we would have to be married.

495
01:03:46,894 --> 01:03:49,771
Its full of Christians down there,
you know?

496
01:03:52,898 --> 01:03:55,776
Well... I don't know, I mean...

497
01:03:57,903 --> 01:04:01,780
Getting married soon,
I love you for a very long time.

498
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,786
I know you're fond of me.

499
01:04:16,918 --> 01:04:19,795
Give this time.
Just give this time.

500
01:04:20,921 --> 01:04:22,797
We'll be fine.

501
01:04:37,934 --> 01:04:40,811
It's not just the age
difference, you know?

502
01:04:40,936 --> 01:04:43,813
...between you and me, Stingo.

503
01:04:47,943 --> 01:04:51,821
You should have another
mother for your children.

504
01:04:53,947 --> 01:04:54,823
Only you.

505
01:04:55,949 --> 01:04:59,827
It would not be fair to your
children to have me as their mother.

506
01:05:01,953 --> 01:05:05,832
Sophie, that would be the
luckiest children in the world.

507
01:05:06,957 --> 01:05:08,833
I'm going to tell you something.

508
01:05:12,962 --> 01:05:16,840
I'm going to tell you something
I never told anybody.

509
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:23,847
Never, but I need a drink.

510
01:05:23,971 --> 01:05:25,848
So won't you get me that first?

511
01:05:57,999 --> 01:06:00,876
In the day that we went...

512
01:06:05,004 --> 01:06:08,881
to Auschwitz, it was Spring,
you know, and...

513
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:12,884
we only arrived there at night.

514
01:06:13,009 --> 01:06:16,888
It was a warm night.
It was a beautiful night.

515
01:12:13,798 --> 01:12:14,674
So...

516
01:12:19,803 --> 01:12:22,681
we'll go to that farm tomorrow.

517
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:30,687
But please, Stingo, don't...

518
01:12:33,815 --> 01:12:35,692
talk about marriage...

519
01:12:45,824 --> 01:12:47,700
and children.

520
01:12:58,835 --> 01:13:01,712
It's enough that...

521
01:13:02,838 --> 01:13:05,715
we'll go down there to that farm...

522
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:10,720
to live...

523
01:13:15,848 --> 01:13:17,725
for a while.

524
01:14:44,919 --> 01:14:47,796
I was 22 and a virgin...

525
01:14:47,921 --> 01:14:50,798
and was clasping in
my arms at last...

526
01:14:50,923 --> 01:14:53,802
the goddess of my
unending fantasies.

527
01:14:55,929 --> 01:14:57,805
My lust was inexhaustible.

528
01:14:59,932 --> 01:15:03,810
Sophie's lust was both
a plunge into carnal oblivion...

529
01:15:03,935 --> 01:15:06,812
and a flight from
memory and grief.

530
01:15:08,939 --> 01:15:10,816
More than that, I now see...

531
01:15:11,941 --> 01:15:15,819
It was a frantic and orgiastic
attempt to beat back death.

532
01:15:18,946 --> 01:15:20,823
"My dearest Stingo...

533
01:15:22,949 --> 01:15:26,829
You are such a beautiful lover.
I had to leave and...

534
01:15:26,954 --> 01:15:31,832
forgive me for not saying goodbye
but I must go back to Nathan.

535
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:36,836
Believe me, you'll find
some wonderful woman...

536
01:15:36,961 --> 01:15:39,838
to make you happy on that farm.

537
01:15:40,964 --> 01:15:44,843
But when I woke I was
feeling so terrible and...

538
01:15:45,968 --> 01:15:48,846
in Despair about Nathan.

539
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:50,847
By that I mean
so filled with guilt...

540
01:15:50,972 --> 01:15:53,849
and thoughts of death.
It was like ice...

541
01:15:53,974 --> 01:15:55,850
flowing into my blood.

542
01:15:56,977 --> 01:16:01,857
So... I must be with Nathan again
for whatever that means.

543
01:16:03,983 --> 01:16:07,861
I may not see you again, but...

544
01:16:08,987 --> 01:16:12,865
do believe me how much
knowing you have meant to me.

545
01:16:14,991 --> 01:16:17,869
You are a great lover, Stingo.

546
01:16:18,995 --> 01:16:20,871
Sophie".

547
01:16:30,004 --> 01:16:31,880
He worked in a pharmaceutical lab.

548
01:16:32,005 --> 01:16:35,884
I think that's how he got
a hold on the cyanide.

549
01:16:36,009 --> 01:16:37,885
They found it next to
the bed, you know?

550
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,887
- What lab, you know?
- I'm not sure.

551
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:57,996
"Ample make this bed.

552
01:19:00,124 --> 01:19:03,001
Make this bed with awe.

553
01:19:04,127 --> 01:19:05,002
In it...

554
01:19:07,129 --> 01:19:09,005
I'll wait till judgment break.

555
01:19:11,133 --> 01:19:13,009
Excellent and fair.

556
01:19:17,137 --> 01:19:19,013
Be its mattress straight.

557
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:24,017
Be its pillow round.

558
01:19:25,142 --> 01:19:28,021
Let no sunrise yellow noise...

559
01:19:30,148 --> 01:19:32,024
interrupt this ground".

560
01:19:38,154 --> 01:19:41,031
And so ended my
voyage of discovery...

561
01:19:41,156 --> 01:19:44,033
in a place as strange as Brooklyn.

562
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:50,038
I let go the rage and sorrow
for Sophie and Nathan...

563
01:19:50,163 --> 01:19:53,040
and for the many others
who were but a few...

564
01:19:53,165 --> 01:19:58,044
of the butchered and betrayed
and martyred children of the Earth.

565
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:02,048
When I could finally see again...

566
01:20:02,173 --> 01:20:07,052
I saw the first rays of daylight
reflected in the murky river.

567
01:20:10,179 --> 01:20:12,056
This was not judgment day.

568
01:20:12,181 --> 01:20:14,057
Only morning.

569
01:20:15,183 --> 01:20:19,061
Morning: excellent and fair.

570
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:55,698
