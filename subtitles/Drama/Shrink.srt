{1012}{1040}What?
{1043}{1111}They basically made a bad version of the script,
{1111}{1149}and it's coming out next summer.
{1152}{1181}What? Really?
{1184}{1217}How is that possible?
{1220}{1257}Mine takes place in an alternate reality.
{1260}{1327}I know.|Yours is better, but...
{1329}{1377}I don't know. I think maybe you should|work on something new.
{1380}{1417}Excuse me.
{1420}{1449}Yeah?|- Yeah.
{1452}{1482}Okay.
{1484}{1584}You want to get a drink|this weekend or something?

{2903}{2950}Yep.
{2968}{3029}Do you have any idea who I am?
{3064}{3127}I wouldn't be here if I didn't.
{3160}{3286}You know this information|will probably get back to him, right?
{3372}{3397}Stop.
{3400}{3444}Stop right there.
{3447}{3487}You're dead, Stitch.
{3489}{3544}You know what your problem is,|Ramirez, you piece of shit?

{6575}{6647}I like you.|- I'm sorry?
{6677}{6731}I really like you...
{6733}{6793}and I don't have any money or insurance...

{6880}{6924}I will do whatever it takes.
{6927}{6999}I will step up big time.
{7082}{7130}I like you, too.

{8636}{8689}It's a surrogate.|I'm a surrogate.
{8692}{8736}She couldn't get pregnant, so...
{8738}{8789}I can't say no.
{8792}{8843}It's probably why I work for Patrick, so...
{8845}{8911}You're serious?|- Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.
{8913}{8947}It's not even my egg.
{8949}{9001}It's just... It's just my oven.

{9036}{9067}That's crazy.|- Yeah.

{9225}{9267}Are you guys good friends?
{9269}{9312}You didn't have to do this.

{10544}{10576}You weren't?|- No.
{10578}{10626}Really?|- Yes.
{10693}{10766}Well, some people might see|getting high in a pediatrician's office...
{10768}{10813}as a cry for help.
{10816}{10868}She's not my kid.
{10871}{10908}But you probably knew that.
{10910}{10958}Let's go.
{11483}{11531}What'd you think?
{11588}{11636}I want to make movies.
{11668}{11712}You do?
{11715}{11759}My mom used to take me to the movies.
{11761}{11809}That was our thing.
{11845}{11909}I kept all the tickets.
{11912}{11965}I tape them to my ceiling.
{12029}{12090}Maybe we could do this every week.
{12092}{12166}I mean go to the movies...
{12168}{12218}instead of talking.
{12285}{12334}You have no idea how tempting that is,
{12336}{12418}but I'm afraid we're gonna have to talk.
{12443}{12508}I knew you were gonna say that.
{12745}{12803}Hey.
{12805}{12842}I see you.
{12844}{12911}This place is a fortress, motherfucker.
{12913}{12959}What the fuck are you trying to pull?
{12961}{13055}That's right, you better run,|you motherfucker.
{13104}{13161}That's from Ed Armstrong at Orion.
{13164}{13230}You don't even know how fucked you are.
{13232}{13317}You're not gonna be able to see a movie|in this goddamn town when l...
{13320}{13391}Daisy.
{13614}{13662}Okay.
{13866}{13914}Hello?
{14164}{14212}Evan?
{14411}{14459}It's for you.
{14509}{14564}Yo, this is Evan.|What's up?
{14865}{14896}We should do this every night.
{14898}{14971}We should start a band.
{14973}{15014}We should start a band.
{15016}{15078}What would our band be called?
{15113}{15174}Let's think.
{15176}{15229}The Neurotics.
{15232}{15299}The Neurotics.|I love it.
{15516}{15564}It's my fault.
{15632}{15694}I should've seen it coming.
{15750}{15840}I mean, all the friends we had are gone.
{15873}{15945}I just have patients now.
{15994}{16074}Well, you still have a step-godbrother.
{16140}{16199}Who wants to be my patient?
{18335}{18382}Jesus Christ Almighty,
{18384}{18451}your face looks like a truck driver's nutsack.
{18453}{18500}Thanks, Dad.|It was a long night.
{18502}{18550}Yeah, I bet.
{18588}{18632}Been thinking about your dream.
{18635}{18665}I thought you didn't do dreams.
{18668}{18731}No, I don't.
{18733}{18766}But in your case...
{18768}{18860}'It's a comfort for seafarers to know...
{18862}{18962}'that no matter on what strange water|they may venture,
{18964}{19070}'there are always pilots within call.
{19110}{19241}But yet the sufferer must help himself.'
{19269}{19326}That's Kierkegaard.
{19366}{19421}Love his work.
{20303}{20351}Hey.
{20396}{20431}I saw you at the movie.
{20433}{20481}Yeah, so?
{20484}{20564}Do you maybe want to have|a cup of coffee or something?
{20567}{20598}Why?
{20600}{20659}I think we might have a lot in common.
{20661}{20685}Yeah. I gotta go.
{20688}{20727}Wait, wait, wait.|My name's Jeremy.
{20729}{20763}I'm a writer and I have a girlfriend.
{20765}{20822}She's my age,|so I'm not a weirdo or anything.
{20824}{20953}Look, I just would really like to have|a cup of coffee with you.
{21089}{21139}You like school?
{21141}{21208}I guess.
{21211}{21250}You guess?
{21252}{21309}Sounds like a 'no' to me.
{21312}{21380}It's all whatever.
{21383}{21439}Whatever.
{21441}{21511}That's a word I used...
{21513}{21613}many, many times when|I was in high school myself.
{21754}{21781}Yeah, I actually...
{21784}{21872}I actually got suspended for a week because
{21874}{21965}I wrote a report on this book|called The Anarchist's Cookbook.
{21968}{22006}What?|- It's this book...
{22008}{22054}It basically tells you how to make bombs.
{22056}{22126}I wasn't trying to make bombs,|but I was trying to do this report...
{22128}{22220}and show this subversive society, whatever.
{22223}{22266}This whole big thing.
{22268}{22336}What about you?|You ever get kicked out?
{22338}{22386}Suspended or anything?
{22418}{22477}What do you think?
{22480}{22528}Probably.
{22557}{22595}Probably.
{22597}{22627}Yeah?
{22629}{22684}Yeah? You did, didn't you?
{22769}{22855}Do you want to go to this party with me tonight?
{22857}{22905}Really?
{24880}{24943}All right, Jemma Brown.
{26334}{26382}Dr. Carter?
{26447}{26526}Would you like me to get you a razor?
{26528}{26576}So you could shave?
{26604}{26656}No.
{26659}{26693}You sure about that?|- Yeah.
{26696}{26724}Okay.
{26727}{26787}I'm here with Dr. Henry Carter.
{26789}{26877}Him, the shrink of the stars.
{26880}{26956}He's a therapist practicing in Los Angeles.
{26959}{27039}A bestselling author...|- Hey, babe.
{27041}{27075}That's your guy, isn't it?
{27077}{27145}Including, of course, his 1995 classic...
{27148}{27211}Yeah.|...Stop Feeling Sad.
{27213}{27290}Doctor, it's good to have you here.
{27404}{27517}Tonight's topic is suicide,
{27520}{27570}with the implicit question...
{27572}{27630}Why do they do it?
{27632}{27747}Can you shed some light|on this dark topic for us?
{27840}{27902}'Why do they do it?' That's your question?
{27904}{27952}Yes.
{28315}{28363}I ought to know.
{28469}{28545}My wife committed suicide.
{28548}{28596}She wrote me a letter.
{28596}{28626}A note.
{28628}{28698}You're supposed to call it a note.
{28819}{28910}I'm a fraud.|A big fraud.
{28946}{29020}Do you honestly believe what you're saying?
{29023}{29071}This book.
{29092}{29119}This book.
{29121}{29215}I wrote this book to feel better about myself.
{29534}{29578}Don't buy this book.
{29580}{29623}It's bullshit.
{29625}{29665}Don't buy this book.
{29668}{29716}Don't buy this book.
{29876}{29924}It's all bullshit.
{29925}{29999}It's all bullshit, and then you die.
{30064}{30120}We knew that going in.
{30893}{30952}Sorry, I gotta take this.
{30954}{31002}Hello.
{31135}{31183}Oh, my God.
{31562}{31660}What would make somebody do something like that?
{31710}{31777}Take a shit on my goddamn porch.
{31894}{31986}Hey. Are you poking my assistant?
{31988}{32042}Because I don't know if you've noticed,|but she's pregnant,
{32044}{32106}and that's just fucking gross.
{32174}{32238}You really like her.
{32240}{32288}Yeah.
{32306}{32362}Yeah, she's a good kid.
{32394}{32450}Don't tell her I said that.
{32517}{32548}You guys can go home.
{32550}{32605}We'll stay.|- No, really.
{32608}{32663}I got my best man on it.
{33012}{33075}Is this the John Belushi suite?
{33100}{33134}What does it say?
{33136}{33200}Let's see. Cocaine.
{33203}{33239}Amphetamines.

{33480}{33525}I'm Irish.
{33528}{33581}What the fuck is Ketamine?
{33599}{33689}It's a horse tranquilizer.|- Of course it is.
{33910}{33995}You may want to stand up for this next part.
{33997}{34048}You fucking kidding?
{34178}{34261}I did it with Keira.
{34264}{34332}You what?|- I had sex with Keira.
{34335}{34360}We fucked.
{34362}{34426}So, if you need to come at me,|if you want to take a swing,
{34428}{34464}whatever you gotta do|to make this right between us.
{34467}{34523}I completely understand.
{34721}{34804}I'm not fucking doing the asteroid movie.
{35221}{35276}Have you been up all night?
{35319}{35367}Yes.
{35387}{35435}It's done.

{35805}{35841}Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.
{35844}{35933}No, I really want you to read this.
{35936}{36013}Come on, Daisy, just give me the gist.
{36064}{36133}When's the last time|you actually read a whole script?
{36136}{36177}Read? I don't need to read, Daisy.
{36180}{36223}I have an agile mind.
{36225}{36263}Do you even like movies?
{36265}{36325}When's the last time you actually|sat through a whole movie?
{36328}{36370}1997, Titanic.|Way too long.
{36372}{36443}Spoiler alert... the boat sinks.
{36499}{36602}Patrick, I have never asked you for anything,
{36604}{36684}and now I'm asking you to do something.
{36731}{36816}Just fucking read it, okay?

{38071}{38105}Today's gonna be our last session, all right?
{38108}{38141}I just need you to know that.
{38144}{38196}Why?|- It's not about you.
{38199}{38236}All right? It's me.
{38239}{38310}Is it because you went crazy on TV?
{38353}{38480}Look, I'm gonna give you the name of a colleague.
{38482}{38512}He's very, very good.
{38515}{38573}He's gonna... What's that?
{38576}{38628}I want you to read it.
{38630}{38676}It's not addressed to me.
{38679}{38809}If it says anything about why it happened,|I want you to tell me.
{38984}{39039}Is this what I think it is?
{40185}{40251}Does it say why?
{41082}{41154}You tell them the next communication from them...
{41156}{41215}better be an offer on the table,|or this is over.
{41217}{41255}Yes.
{41257}{41320}No. I've heard it so much.|I'm done.
{41323}{41419}I'm done with them.|Do you understand? I'm done.
{42210}{42258}How you doing?
{42312}{42410}I saw you on TV.|That was dope.

{42640}{42678}Wait, wait, wait.|What's that?
{42680}{42711}What's what? This?|- Yeah.
{42713}{42755}You don't want that.|- Why not? What is it?
{42757}{42848}Because that's some break-the-glass-|in-case-of-emergency type shit.
{42851}{42882}And I don't...|- That sounds perfect.
{42884}{42948}I don't...|- Yeah, I want this.

{44492}{44532}I mean, it's all in there.
{44534}{44597}They're just words.
{44600}{44666}They don't mean anything.
{44856}{44904}You're in it, too.
{44939}{45009}I didn't know anything about this.
{45043}{45114}He must have read your...
{45116}{45182}I trusted you.
{45722}{45754}How fucking dare you?
{45756}{45856}That was my patient's file|you fucking stole, you dick.

{45902}{45931}Listen to me. Listen.|Did you read it?
{45933}{45969}Did I read it?|What is this, a fucking workshop?
{45972}{46004}If you read it,|you might understand what l...

{52380}{52432}Feelings are rarely understood in the moment.
{52434}{52470}They are quickly forgotten...
{52472}{52542}and almost always mis-remembered.
