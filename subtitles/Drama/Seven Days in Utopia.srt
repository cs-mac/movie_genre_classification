1
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:17,217
It's not the time to
start playing it safe.

2
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:33,383
Son, you have to drop.

3
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:34,351
That's playing to lose.

4
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:35,653
You got to listen to me.

5
00:02:35,753 --> 00:02:37,388
I've been listening
to you my whole life.

6
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:39,389
You've got to put some pressure on.

7
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:50,166
How can a game

8
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:53,270
have such an effect on man's soul?

9
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:55,272
The way I see it,

10
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,823
how can it not?

11
00:02:56,891 --> 00:03:00,326
You don't choose the
game. It chooses you.

12
00:03:00,394 --> 00:03:01,795
And when it does,

13
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:05,465
life and golf become forever connected.

14
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,334
That's how it was for a young man

15
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:09,820
named Luke Chisolm.

16
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,511
You've got to be kidding me.

17
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:23,944
Once you make one mistake
out of the water there,

18
00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:26,146
you just continue to
make the same mistake.

19
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,280
Are you hurt, son?

20
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:04,902
I'll get over it.

21
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:07,821
Yeah.

22
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:11,958
You the guy I saw

23
00:05:12,026 --> 00:05:14,128
putting the flagstick in the field?

24
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:18,314
Yeah, and you the guy that
crashed through my fence?

25
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:23,219
Here. Let me help you.

26
00:05:23,254 --> 00:05:25,939
Johnny Crawford's the name.

27
00:05:26,007 --> 00:05:27,858
Yeah. Luke Chisolm.

28
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:29,359
Yeah, let me see that.

29
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:33,630
Yeah, look, put a
little pressure on there.

30
00:05:33,697 --> 00:05:35,532
It'll stop the bleeding.

31
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:36,016
All right.

32
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:38,235
Yeah. Thank you.

33
00:05:38,302 --> 00:05:40,320
I need to get you to my truck

34
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:42,956
to get you some medical
attention, all right?

35
00:05:43,024 --> 00:05:46,359
So let's get these clubs up here.

36
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:48,161
You feel all right? You're not dizzy?

37
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:51,130
No, I'll be all right.

38
00:05:51,198 --> 00:05:54,001
You're a hell of a driver.

39
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:59,306
373 people?

40
00:05:59,374 --> 00:06:00,790
375.

41
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:02,593
Megan Monroe had twins last week.

42
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,264
Yeah. Haven't taken the sign down yet.

43
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:11,101
The evening service is just letting out.

44
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:12,785
Hey, how you doing?

45
00:06:12,853 --> 00:06:15,655
I went this morning,

46
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,624
in case you was wondering.

47
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,183
Order up.

48
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:28,718
Let me guess. Same as usual.

49
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:29,953
You got it.

50
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:32,289
So are you all done there, darling?

51
00:06:32,356 --> 00:06:35,492
How y'all doing here? Need more coffee?

52
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,895
Sure.

53
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:40,480
Oh, Sarah, I could use some more coffee.

54
00:06:40,548 --> 00:06:43,066
Excuse me.

55
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:45,319
How you boys doing here?

56
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:47,637
You gonna save a dance for me tonight?

57
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:50,690
I'll think about it.

58
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:55,011
She's just playing hard to get.

59
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,030
Of course she is.

60
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:03,654
Mama, it's Uncle Johnny.

61
00:07:03,721 --> 00:07:06,006
Hi, everybody.

62
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:07,608
This here's Luke.

63
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:09,843
He's had a small accident,

64
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,429
do we have that aid kit back there?

65
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:14,247
I'll get it.

66
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:17,768
Johnny, what in the world
happened to this poor boy?

67
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:21,421
Don't worry. He's gonna live.

68
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:23,756
Mercy. It looks like
you've been hit by a truck.

69
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:25,508
More like a cow.

70
00:07:25,576 --> 00:07:26,893
You hit a cow?

71
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,547
No, I missed the cow,

72
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:32,415
but I did manage to
run through the fence.

73
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:35,952
Do you need a doctor?

74
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,272
No, ma'am.

75
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,739
I need a mechanic.

76
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:42,059
Here you go.

77
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:44,177
Sure. Thank you.

78
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:45,929
We need some strong hands

79
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:48,148
to get the car over to Brody's shop.

80
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:50,083
Jake, be a dear and help Johnny.

81
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:51,568
What about my burger?

82
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:53,203
The poor man's car just got wrecked,

83
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,389
and you're worrying about a burger?

84
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:57,057
Where are your manners?

85
00:07:57,124 --> 00:07:58,608
Come on, Jake. Let's go. Let's go.

86
00:07:58,676 --> 00:07:59,692
Jake, come on.

87
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,628
Have fun.

88
00:08:01,695 --> 00:08:03,213
Come on, smiley. You, too.

89
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:06,599
Work some of that off.

90
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:08,101
Come on. Come on.

91
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:10,137
Let's go.

92
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:12,105
Hmm? Sarah?

93
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,640
Drive Luke to the inn.

94
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:16,376
I'd be much obliged. Thank you.

95
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:17,794
Sure.

96
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:22,749
There you go.

97
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:25,752
Just let me know whenever you're ready.

98
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,675
Mama, we'll be right back.

99
00:08:31,742 --> 00:08:32,842
Thank you, ma'am.

100
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,878
Drive careful.

101
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,396
 Are you right? 

102
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:41,000
 will this end in tears? 

103
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:42,101
where you from?

104
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,503
Waco.

105
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,856
But I've been on the road
these past couple of years.

106
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:47,824
Yeah? Me, too.

107
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:49,125
Really?

108
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:50,126
Mm-hmm.

109
00:08:50,194 --> 00:08:51,978
What for, school?

110
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:55,832
I'm training to be a horse whisperer.

111
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:57,284
I always thought horse whispering

112
00:08:57,351 --> 00:08:58,969
was only in the movies.

113
00:08:59,036 --> 00:09:00,804
But it's for real, huh?

114
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:03,173
Yep.

115
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,491
Well, good luck with that.

116
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,277
Thank you.

117
00:09:07,344 --> 00:09:09,296
So where you taking me, anyway?

118
00:09:09,397 --> 00:09:10,997
Oh, we're just going to the River Inn.

119
00:09:11,065 --> 00:09:12,899
That's Uncle Johnny's place.

120
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:15,118
Are you two related?

121
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:18,304
No, he's just a close family friend,

122
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:20,990
but I've always known
him as Uncle Johnny.

123
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:22,692
Here we are.

124
00:09:25,162 --> 00:09:26,779
Well, thanks for the ride.

125
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:30,300
Sure. You have to get
that from the outside.

126
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:45,432
 Feeling it all as the wind blows 

127
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:53,173
 feeling it all as the time goes 

128
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:59,813
 do you feel my eyes
right there on you? 

129
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:05,635
hello?

130
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:11,157
Don't you even think

131
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:13,643
about coming in here with those.

132
00:10:15,463 --> 00:10:17,914
You must be the one
who ran off the road.

133
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:21,818
What'd you do, fall asleep at the wheel?

134
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:23,103
Well, come on.

135
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,220
I don't have all day to check you in.

136
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:26,323
Let's go.

137
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,343
And close that door behind you.

138
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:35,331
You're not bad looking.

139
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,167
Blind as a bat, maybe.

140
00:10:37,234 --> 00:10:38,468
You married?

141
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:39,770
The neighbor girl's
looking for a husband.

142
00:10:39,837 --> 00:10:41,638
No, ma'am. I'm not married.

143
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:43,040
Okay, now don't lose this key.

144
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:44,407
It opens the front door, too,

145
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:47,260
so you don't bother me
when you drag in late.

146
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:48,794
Yes, ma'am.

147
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:51,547
There's extra towels
in the cupboard there,

148
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:54,384
but it's okay to use the same one twice.

149
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:56,052
Breakfast is at 8:00.

150
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,587
Don't be late.

151
00:11:22,613 --> 00:11:23,530
Hi, there. Thanks for teeing it up

152
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:25,115
with us here on golf central.

153
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:26,649
I'm Todd Lewis, sitting
beside Frank Nobilo,

154
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:29,319
and, Frank, we begin with
that unbelievable story

155
00:11:29,387 --> 00:11:31,988
happening at the
Callaway San Antonio open.

156
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:33,290
Well, that's right, Todd.

157
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:34,490
Luke Chisolm is a name

158
00:11:34,558 --> 00:11:35,491
that we've all had on our radar screens

159
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,659
ever since he won

160
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:38,028
the Texas state amateur championship.

161
00:11:38,095 --> 00:11:40,297
Folks, if you have not
seen this highlight before,

162
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:41,765
sit back and enjoy.

163
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:43,666
It's something you will not forget.

164
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:45,635
The winner of this
tournament earns an exemption

165
00:11:45,703 --> 00:11:48,738
into the Valero Texas open
just a few weeks from now.

166
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:50,223
Luke Chisolm had a one shot lead

167
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,208
on the final hole over Joe Buckner,

168
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:53,760
father Martin on the bag,

169
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:55,228
and look who shows up on the tee:

170
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:56,996
The number one player on the planet

171
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:59,549
and the tournament's lead sponsor, TKO.

172
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:01,117
What an intimidating presence.

173
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:04,403
Well, that's enough to
rattle anybody's cage,

174
00:12:04,471 --> 00:12:06,839
and in this situation, Luke Chisolm,

175
00:12:06,874 --> 00:12:09,208
he just blocks his tee shot way right.

176
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:11,560
His dad Martin wanted him...

177
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:13,129
3
- iron.

178
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:15,248
Whoa.

179
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:17,567
It's not the time to
start playing it safe.

180
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:18,768
Yeah, but if I make par,

181
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:20,337
he's gotta make birdie to tie me.

182
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:23,790
You're playing not to lose
instead of playing to win.

183
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:25,208
Here.

184
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:28,111
Remember who won the masters last year?

185
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:30,313
That guy over there.

186
00:12:30,381 --> 00:12:31,464
Yeah, that guy over there.

187
00:12:31,532 --> 00:12:33,149
Tko got his fourth green jacket.

188
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:34,818
Remember who come in second?

189
00:12:37,187 --> 00:12:39,272
Nobody remembers the runner-up, Luke.

190
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,473
You can get on the green in two

191
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:42,625
if you hit it with the big stick.

192
00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:21,564
That one hurt.

193
00:13:21,632 --> 00:13:22,932
You wanna hit a few?

194
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,868
Your hand up to it?

195
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:35,077
Right into trouble.

196
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:36,630
Thread the needle with a 3-iron.

197
00:13:36,697 --> 00:13:38,598
You bump and run it up on the green.

198
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,383
I think I should just
punch out right here.

199
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:41,734
You got to put some pressure on.

200
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:44,070
Hit the 3.

201
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:48,507
Hit the 3, huh?

202
00:13:48,575 --> 00:13:51,628
Hey, mama, there's an easter egg hunt

203
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:52,979
at the church tomorrow.

204
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:54,981
Sounds like fun.

205
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:56,766
Can we go, dad?

206
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:59,168
You got some practicing to do tomorrow.

207
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:00,569
Martin, it's easter Sunday.

208
00:14:00,637 --> 00:14:02,839
Sundays are reserved for golf.

209
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:06,492
Son, you have to drop.

210
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,510
That's playing to lose.

211
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:08,778
You gotta listen to me.

212
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:10,379
I've been listening to you my whole life

213
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:11,981
and this is where it's got me.

214
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:17,003
All right. Where you gonna put it?

215
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:20,540
I hope he brought a snorkel.

216
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:21,841
All right. Let's see what you got.

217
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:24,310
You gotta pull yourself
together here, son.

218
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:25,311
Am I embarrassing you?

219
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:27,697
You hooked it.

220
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:29,949
You gotta watch your right hand.

221
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:31,217
There you go.

222
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:32,735
Let it release.

223
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:36,839
Come on, now. Let's get started here.

224
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:42,529
Don't flip it. Come on, now.

225
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:44,981
Come on. One more good one.

226
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:46,466
In the hole!

227
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:48,501
Oh! Oh!

228
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:49,802
Give me another one.

229
00:14:56,676 --> 00:15:00,346
You're playing not to lose
instead of playing to win.

230
00:15:01,748 --> 00:15:04,100
Nobody remembers the runner-up, Luke.

231
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:04,817
God!

232
00:15:04,885 --> 00:15:06,703
You gotta put some pressure on him.

233
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,221
Hit the 3.

234
00:15:15,796 --> 00:15:18,815
He snaps his putter, flings the shaft,

235
00:15:18,883 --> 00:15:20,116
and then the sad shot here,

236
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:23,502
his father Martin, walking away from son

237
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:25,671
on the final hole. Oh, my goodness.

238
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:29,108
He ends up shooting an 80 on the day.

239
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:31,361
We're going to look
at the one that started

240
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:32,328
what I believe was the meltdown

241
00:15:32,395 --> 00:15:33,746
when he hit it into the hazard

242
00:15:33,814 --> 00:15:35,348
and going forth from there, Frank.

243
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,616
What was going through his mind?

244
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:37,733
Well, I think he was still smarting,

245
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:39,402
tom, with the decision
he made off the tee,

246
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,720
whether to hit driver or 3-wood.

247
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:42,571
That's obviously still
in the back of his mind.

248
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,407
And once you've made
one mistake out of-

249
00:15:44,474 --> 00:15:46,176
I had a feeling there was more going on

250
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:48,477
than meets the eye.

251
00:15:48,545 --> 00:15:50,446
Wow. He chilled good.

252
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:52,415
What could I have done
differently instead.

253
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:54,633
Just hitting never
gets you out of trouble.

254
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:56,119
The problem is-

255
00:15:56,186 --> 00:15:59,321
what do I got to do to
get some food around here,

256
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:01,391
kill a cow myself?

257
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,642
So really, this is farcical.

258
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:03,876
When you've got no chance-

259
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,191
wow.

260
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:37,260
That's no greenskeeper.

261
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:52,058
"Pga of America half century club. "

262
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:10,409
Hey, Luke, I was hoping you'd be here.

263
00:17:10,477 --> 00:17:11,711
You can tote these.

264
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:15,798
Well, close your mouth, sugar. Let's go.

265
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:18,017
Well, where we going?

266
00:17:29,229 --> 00:17:31,380
Hey, you're looking a whole lot better.

267
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:32,832
I'm feeling better.

268
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,900
You're in good hands with mabel.

269
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,301
I'll tell you what.

270
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:37,553
I'll feed you right, but
it's my brother Johnny

271
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:38,888
that you're gonna get the most from

272
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:40,423
if you're paying attention.

273
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:42,958
Now where is my dance partner?

274
00:17:43,026 --> 00:17:45,244
Sarah?

275
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:46,296
Sarah?

276
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,435
Maybe you could just
introduce Luke around.

277
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:53,570
Oh, sure.

278
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:55,254
Hey, you feeling any better?

279
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:57,690
Oh, yeah. It's amazing what a shower

280
00:17:57,757 --> 00:18:00,176
and some clean clothes will do.

281
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,452
You good with this, Duane?

282
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,387
Yeah, go on.

283
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:16,976
Am I ever gonna get to
see you whisper to a horse?

284
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:21,130
I don't do that just in
front of anybody, you know.

285
00:18:21,198 --> 00:18:22,916
What about dancing?

286
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:26,169
You do that in front of anyone?

287
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:29,088
Hey, lookee here. It's tour boy.

288
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:31,541
Jake rustin, this is Luke Chisolm.

289
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:32,926
Yeah, we had the pleasure

290
00:18:32,993 --> 00:18:34,594
earlier today at the diner.

291
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:35,911
Yeah, that was right before

292
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,813
I helped drag your
car out of a cow Patty.

293
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:39,983
Wasn't too happy about it at the time.

294
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,986
Then me and Sarah saw
you on tv, remember?

295
00:18:43,053 --> 00:18:45,355
You're a regular celebrity.

296
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:47,523
Not every day I get to
help out a record holder.

297
00:18:47,591 --> 00:18:48,591
Hey, Jake, be quiet.

298
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:52,745
Well, I had quite the meltdown.

299
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,982
Oh, yeah. I especially
liked that mud bath.

300
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:58,668
The golf channel, they
don't miss a thing.

301
00:18:58,736 --> 00:18:59,885
Jake.

302
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:01,420
It's okay.

303
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:02,922
Just let him talk.

304
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,607
I'm sure he could
have done a lot better.

305
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:07,309
You play golf?

306
00:19:07,377 --> 00:19:09,212
I can hold my own.

307
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,930
Yeah? On what course?

308
00:19:10,998 --> 00:19:13,032
The kind with windmills, volcanoes?

309
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,784
Come on, guys.

310
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:16,986
All right, can we be social?

311
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:18,621
Let's play nice.

312
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:22,909
I never shot 16 on one hole before.

313
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:25,428
Yeah, well, it was a 14.

314
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:27,263
Sarah, it was a pleasure.

315
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:31,450
You wanna dance?

316
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:39,475
 Leave it all behind 

317
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:47,850
I didn't see where it went.

318
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:49,802
You hooked it.

319
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:51,287
You gotta watch your right hand.

320
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:52,789
Let it release.

321
00:19:52,856 --> 00:19:54,524
Don't flip it.

322
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:57,276
Dad, it's getting dark.

323
00:19:57,344 --> 00:19:59,162
Well, I can see just fine.

324
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:01,897
Come on, now. Let's finish
what we started here.

325
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:08,287
One more good one.

326
00:20:13,794 --> 00:20:15,394
Come on, now.

327
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,221
There you are.

328
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:26,839
Hey.

329
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:34,146
Tough day, eh?

330
00:20:34,214 --> 00:20:36,516
Yeah, I've had better.

331
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:40,019
Yeah, well, I saw you on tv.

332
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:44,474
I got to say it was painful to watch.

333
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,092
Try living it.

334
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,544
Believe it or not, I have.

335
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:50,196
I believe it.

336
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:53,232
I snooped around in your study.

337
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:57,620
Yeah? Well, I chased
the tour for a while.

338
00:20:57,688 --> 00:20:59,722
Had my ups and downs.

339
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:02,008
You want an observation?

340
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:06,179
You were playing from back here, see?

341
00:21:06,246 --> 00:21:08,347
Tournament golf has to
be played in front of you

342
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:10,916
where the target is.

343
00:21:10,984 --> 00:21:13,586
That's a new one.

344
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:14,837
You have the mechanics.

345
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:16,005
You just don't know what it means

346
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:20,359
to play the game in front of the ball.

347
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:22,244
Well, I'm debating

348
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:24,647
on picking up a club ever again.

349
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:28,851
Well, I have a proposition for you.

350
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:32,488
Spend seven days with me in utopia,

351
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:34,490
you'll find your game.

352
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:41,664
Seven days? I don't know.

353
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:43,682
Well, it'll take you that long

354
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,618
to get your car fixed, you know?

355
00:21:46,686 --> 00:21:49,338
So think about it, all right?

356
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:54,376
I'll be at the driving range
9:00 A.M. tomorrow morning.

357
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:55,812
Sarah.

358
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:57,413
Hey, Johnny.

359
00:21:57,481 --> 00:22:00,432
I thought you could use some company.

360
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,235
Gonna be fireworks soon.

361
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:04,820
All right.

362
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:09,341
I also wanted to apologize for Jake.

363
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:11,177
His dad basically disowned him

364
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:13,445
after he chose the rodeo
over the family business.

365
00:22:13,513 --> 00:22:16,649
He's got a warm heart, that's for sure.

366
00:22:16,716 --> 00:22:18,417
I see.

367
00:22:18,485 --> 00:22:20,787
You two together?

368
00:22:20,854 --> 00:22:24,290
No. Everyone expects us to be, but...

369
00:22:24,357 --> 00:22:27,493
I don't know, especially Jake.

370
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,214
So what about you?

371
00:22:32,282 --> 00:22:33,632
Me.

372
00:22:35,335 --> 00:22:39,271
Mom and I lost my dad
to cancer two years ago,

373
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:43,008
so I suppose I'm just...

374
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:46,645
Taking each day as they come.

375
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:51,367
I'm sorry.

376
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:58,907
"I suppose" means God
works in mysterious ways.

377
00:23:02,262 --> 00:23:05,197
Johnny says he can help me with my game.

378
00:23:05,265 --> 00:23:08,467
Think I should take him up on his offer?

379
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,142
Well, I think...

380
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:21,180
I think some time
here might do you good.

381
00:23:51,477 --> 00:23:55,514
"Donations appreciated. God bless. "

382
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:57,300
Nice.

383
00:24:18,105 --> 00:24:20,639
You got game, son.

384
00:24:22,526 --> 00:24:24,894
You could have told me
you owned this place.

385
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:26,979
Well, you could have told me

386
00:24:27,046 --> 00:24:28,613
what really happened to your putter.

387
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:33,903
What made you want to build
a golf course out here?

388
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,188
Well, originally I moved here

389
00:24:36,256 --> 00:24:37,323
to get away from the game,

390
00:24:37,424 --> 00:24:39,775
but easier said than done, I guess.

391
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:42,010
So you quit the tour?

392
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:47,316
Well, the game just wasn't a
good fit for me anymore. Yeah.

393
00:24:47,384 --> 00:24:49,235
Okay, listen, let's get started.

394
00:24:49,302 --> 00:24:50,870
I want to see you hit some, all right?

395
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:52,722
I want to see you swing.

396
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:57,476
These are a little better.

397
00:24:57,543 --> 00:24:58,644
Yep.

398
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:15,094
Why do you grip the club that way?

399
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:17,546
Well, I don't know.

400
00:25:17,614 --> 00:25:19,131
Just feels good.

401
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:20,616
Well, that's the wrong answer.

402
00:25:21,685 --> 00:25:24,753
Now, let start from scratch, all right?

403
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:28,440
I need to know why you
do the things you do.

404
00:25:28,508 --> 00:25:31,843
Like the foundation for your swing,

405
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:34,380
from the grip to the follow through.

406
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:38,334
Now go think about it and write it down.

407
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:41,954
The first step in finding a good game

408
00:25:42,022 --> 00:25:44,139
is to find some conviction.

409
00:25:44,207 --> 00:25:46,992
You got that?

410
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,844
Think about it.

411
00:25:52,582 --> 00:25:54,683
How'd I end up here?

412
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:08,713
Unbelievable.

413
00:27:10,277 --> 00:27:11,794
The toughest challenge you'll face

414
00:27:11,862 --> 00:27:12,728
isn't the golf course

415
00:27:12,796 --> 00:27:14,196
or even your competitor's score.

416
00:27:14,264 --> 00:27:16,265
It's that casual comment

417
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,016
offered by someone, anyone,

418
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:20,669
about how you should be doing it.

419
00:27:20,737 --> 00:27:22,087
If you don't have conviction

420
00:27:22,155 --> 00:27:23,589
about where your foundation is,

421
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:26,291
that off-handed comment will
take you out of your game

422
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,212
and erode your confidence.

423
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,947
Now, you got that?

424
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:33,699
Yes, sir.

425
00:27:37,437 --> 00:27:39,404
That's Ben hogan.

426
00:27:39,556 --> 00:27:40,322
Yeah.

427
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,207
The one and only.

428
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:57,289
Place the club in my left hand

429
00:27:57,357 --> 00:27:59,791
with my thumb down the shaft.

430
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:02,995
Place my right hand over my left thumb

431
00:28:03,063 --> 00:28:04,646
and my lifeline.

432
00:28:04,714 --> 00:28:07,166
That helps me cock my wrist

433
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:09,168
in my backswing.

434
00:28:09,235 --> 00:28:11,920
That's good.

435
00:28:11,988 --> 00:28:14,756
I do believe.

436
00:28:17,877 --> 00:28:20,228
You're not from here, are you?

437
00:28:20,296 --> 00:28:23,315
Well, not exactly.

438
00:28:23,383 --> 00:28:25,734
I've lived in a lot of places.

439
00:28:25,802 --> 00:28:29,020
Been around here and
there with the military.

440
00:28:29,088 --> 00:28:32,457
No, I'm not from here.

441
00:28:32,525 --> 00:28:35,277
How'd you end up in utopia?

442
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:41,249
You ask a lot of questions, young fella.

443
00:28:41,317 --> 00:28:44,186
You really do.

444
00:28:44,254 --> 00:28:46,405
I burned all my Bridges.

445
00:28:46,472 --> 00:28:50,459
There was no place to turn but here.

446
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,681
A tour player like you,

447
00:28:55,748 --> 00:28:59,084
the players you played with,

448
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:01,103
why here?

449
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:02,521
I'll tell you.

450
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:04,773
Paul Hawkins was a student of mine

451
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:06,408
way back when, that's Sarah's dad.

452
00:29:06,476 --> 00:29:09,328
He was a good man
- a great man.

453
00:29:09,395 --> 00:29:13,832
He let me stay with them while I...

454
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,751
Got my act together.

455
00:29:18,688 --> 00:29:20,823
Been here ever since.

456
00:29:26,346 --> 00:29:29,381
Did you get in some kind of trouble?

457
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:32,651
It's getting late.

458
00:29:34,104 --> 00:29:36,571
I'm gonna see you
tomorrow down by the river.

459
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:38,407
Day break, all right?

460
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:41,025
What does the river
have to do with golf?

461
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:43,111
You'll see.

462
00:29:44,731 --> 00:29:46,848
You will see.

463
00:30:02,765 --> 00:30:05,884
Rhythm, balance, patience.

464
00:30:05,952 --> 00:30:08,370
That's what you need
to stay in your game.

465
00:30:08,437 --> 00:30:10,505
The same with fly fishing.

466
00:30:10,573 --> 00:30:12,858
It takes a calm mindset

467
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:17,713
a focus on the feel,
rather than the outcome.

468
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:21,350
It takes emotional control.

469
00:30:48,027 --> 00:30:48,894
Hey?

470
00:30:50,347 --> 00:30:51,813
All right.

471
00:30:56,386 --> 00:30:58,520
Tell me.

472
00:30:58,588 --> 00:31:00,205
What was his downfall?

473
00:31:00,272 --> 00:31:03,158
He took the bait.

474
00:31:03,226 --> 00:31:04,342
Yeah, but why?

475
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,911
What made him fall into that trap?

476
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,697
I'm not sure.

477
00:31:08,765 --> 00:31:10,115
'Cause he was hungry?

478
00:31:10,183 --> 00:31:11,883
No, he was mad.

479
00:31:11,951 --> 00:31:14,703
I teased him with a shadow casting,

480
00:31:14,771 --> 00:31:17,806
never quite letting
the fly touch the water,

481
00:31:17,874 --> 00:31:20,192
so I was able to take that fish

482
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:21,910
out of his game today.

483
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:26,481
Now, you ready to give it a try?

484
00:31:46,302 --> 00:31:47,653
All right, remember.

485
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,305
To stay in balance in the skiff

486
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:52,924
or during your golf swing,

487
00:31:52,992 --> 00:31:56,145
you have to control your emotions.

488
00:31:56,212 --> 00:31:57,145
Okay?

489
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:59,063
All right.

490
00:32:04,337 --> 00:32:07,322
Breathe, Luke.

491
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:11,643
Rhythm, balance, and patience.

492
00:32:30,362 --> 00:32:32,180
Johnny, I got one.

493
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:37,619
Now catch it. Keep the tip up.

494
00:32:37,687 --> 00:32:40,572
Keep the tip up. Take it as it comes.

495
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,956
All right?

496
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,733
Easy. Easy.

497
00:32:54,003 --> 00:32:55,870
Oh!

498
00:32:58,474 --> 00:33:00,092
Never fails.

499
00:33:19,061 --> 00:33:20,328
Got him, Johnny.

500
00:33:20,396 --> 00:33:22,798
Hey, good job, son.

501
00:33:22,866 --> 00:33:23,999
Whoo!

502
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:26,368
How comes you always seem
to do things the hard way?

503
00:33:28,688 --> 00:33:30,956
Good. Hey!

504
00:33:38,814 --> 00:33:43,135
Come here. I want to show you something.

505
00:33:43,202 --> 00:33:45,286
30 years ago, this
man named Jack nicklaus

506
00:33:45,354 --> 00:33:46,688
took me out of my game.

507
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:47,840
You know how?

508
00:33:47,907 --> 00:33:49,691
By staying in his game.

509
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:52,778
The calmer he was, the madder I got.

510
00:33:52,846 --> 00:33:54,513
And I tried shots

511
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,299
I wouldn't ordinarily take.

512
00:33:57,367 --> 00:34:00,719
Now, this look familiar?

513
00:34:05,475 --> 00:34:07,842
A little hiccup on 18.

514
00:34:09,295 --> 00:34:13,431
Well, at least you got
beat by the golden bear.

515
00:34:13,499 --> 00:34:15,517
Yeah, and so would you have.

516
00:34:15,585 --> 00:34:17,035
Ha ha ha.

517
00:34:19,605 --> 00:34:21,306
Now tomorrow we actually
meet at the course.

518
00:34:21,424 --> 00:34:23,858
Fifth fairway.

519
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,176
8 A.M.

520
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,097
I'm sorry.

521
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:48,099
It's not good to be late in life, son.

522
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:51,603
Time is too precious to waste.

523
00:34:51,671 --> 00:34:52,971
I said I was sorry.

524
00:34:53,038 --> 00:34:55,223
If this was a tournament,
you'd be disqualified.

525
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:56,724
Now, you wanna play like a professional,

526
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:59,294
you have to act like one, all right?

527
00:34:59,495 --> 00:35:01,446
Now take a seat.

528
00:35:01,514 --> 00:35:03,832
Take a seat.

529
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,088
Today...

530
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,141
We're gonna paint.

531
00:35:13,209 --> 00:35:15,610
All right?

532
00:35:15,678 --> 00:35:17,429
Paint?

533
00:35:17,496 --> 00:35:19,197
All right.

534
00:35:19,315 --> 00:35:22,967
All golf shots start
with a blank canvas.

535
00:35:23,035 --> 00:35:27,122
We paint the shot with our eyes first

536
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:31,409
so our bodies can
reproduce it accurately.

537
00:35:31,477 --> 00:35:36,064
Now...

538
00:35:36,131 --> 00:35:40,268
What kind of shot could
you make from here?

539
00:35:48,761 --> 00:35:50,311
Well, I think-

540
00:35:50,379 --> 00:35:51,914
no, no, don't think.

541
00:35:51,981 --> 00:35:53,949
See.

542
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:05,227
Okay.

543
00:36:05,294 --> 00:36:07,996
I see a low punch eight iron.

544
00:36:08,063 --> 00:36:10,148
Playing the ball back in my stance

545
00:36:10,216 --> 00:36:12,583
with a slightly hooded clubface.

546
00:36:12,651 --> 00:36:15,337
I can see the ball flying about 30 yards

547
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:16,688
with some hook-spin,

548
00:36:16,756 --> 00:36:18,990
landing on the upslope of that hill,

549
00:36:19,058 --> 00:36:22,711
bouncing up and going in the cup.

550
00:36:24,614 --> 00:36:25,930
Okay.

551
00:36:25,998 --> 00:36:28,132
Now go paint it.

552
00:36:36,626 --> 00:36:38,026
Morning.

553
00:36:38,177 --> 00:36:39,443
Morning.

554
00:36:41,964 --> 00:36:44,098
Just paying a visit to Paul.

555
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,099
Yeah.

556
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:46,368
Mama.

557
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:49,638
Hey, mama, you gonna be all right?

558
00:36:49,705 --> 00:36:50,672
Just give me a minute?

559
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,307
Right, honey. You go have fun.

560
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:53,441
Take care.

561
00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:55,526
Can't believe it's been two years.

562
00:36:55,594 --> 00:36:57,111
Yeah.

563
00:36:57,179 --> 00:36:59,715
I miss Paul most every day.

564
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:04,235
Yeah.
Whoa-ho-ho.

565
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,756
Hi.

566
00:37:07,824 --> 00:37:08,957
Hey.

567
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:10,759
You look nice.

568
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:12,544
Well, thank you.

569
00:37:12,611 --> 00:37:14,262
So your Uncle Johnny,

570
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,681
he's a real piece of work today.

571
00:37:16,749 --> 00:37:19,334
Yeah, well, it's actually

572
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:22,337
kind of a rough day for all of us.

573
00:37:22,404 --> 00:37:25,907
It's the second anniversary
of dad's passing.

574
00:37:28,627 --> 00:37:30,528
It's okay.

575
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:33,732
Is there anything I can do?

576
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:36,868
Well, I was gonna ask you...

577
00:37:36,936 --> 00:37:38,870
My father and I used
to go up to obra maestra

578
00:37:38,938 --> 00:37:40,205
on his birthday.

579
00:37:40,272 --> 00:37:42,874
I was thinking of going
out there later today,

580
00:37:42,942 --> 00:37:45,243
and I could really use the company.

581
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:49,097
It'd be an honor.

582
00:37:49,165 --> 00:37:52,950
Okay.

583
00:37:53,018 --> 00:37:55,937
I see Uncle Johnny's
got you painting already.

584
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:59,140
Yeah, he does. I wasn't expecting that.

585
00:38:56,665 --> 00:38:59,217
Looks like we're gonna
have to add another shelf.

586
00:38:59,285 --> 00:39:02,971
Maybe one day there'll be
tour trophies on that shelf.

587
00:39:03,038 --> 00:39:05,807
Ain't no maybes in this world, Luke.

588
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:09,394
You understand?

589
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:10,862
Yes, dad.

590
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,463
Good.

591
00:39:12,498 --> 00:39:16,067
Now rephrase what you just said to me.

592
00:39:16,135 --> 00:39:21,322
One day there will be tour
trophies on this shelf.

593
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:25,993
I'm counting on it, son.

594
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:28,013
I'm proud of you.

595
00:40:20,532 --> 00:40:22,801
You ready, cowboy?

596
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:49,878
<i>Obra maestra means
masterpiece in Spanish.</i>

597
00:40:49,945 --> 00:40:53,965
I can see why.

598
00:40:54,032 --> 00:40:56,451
Sure is beautiful.

599
00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:04,542
I might even go as far
as calling it utopia.

600
00:41:06,762 --> 00:41:08,096
Yeah.

601
00:41:08,164 --> 00:41:10,899
I suppose you might.

602
00:41:10,966 --> 00:41:13,401
You ever think of living somewhere else?

603
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:16,687
Everything I need's right here.

604
00:41:16,755 --> 00:41:18,656
I'm free to be myself.

605
00:41:18,723 --> 00:41:21,692
Free to do the things I was born to do.

606
00:41:23,846 --> 00:41:25,480
What is that?

607
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:30,134
Bring freedom to horses.

608
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:37,491
And the occasional stranger.

609
00:41:48,654 --> 00:41:50,721
Come on.

610
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:55,726
Hyah! Move!

611
00:41:55,794 --> 00:41:58,229
Jake.

612
00:41:59,515 --> 00:42:01,332
Jake, you're coming too close.

613
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,867
You're gonna scare the horses.

614
00:42:02,935 --> 00:42:04,752
Come on!

615
00:42:06,355 --> 00:42:07,439
Whoa.

616
00:42:07,506 --> 00:42:09,607
What are you doing out here with him?

617
00:42:09,675 --> 00:42:10,759
I'm taking a ride.

618
00:42:10,826 --> 00:42:12,393
I didn't know I needed your permission.

619
00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:16,598
So tour boy, choke on anything lately?

620
00:42:18,517 --> 00:42:21,219
Yeah, well, at least I
got a sport to choke on.

621
00:42:21,287 --> 00:42:23,387
What do y'all play out
here, mutton busting?

622
00:42:23,455 --> 00:42:25,507
You know what us tour boys say

623
00:42:25,574 --> 00:42:27,375
about Hicks and sheep, don't you?

624
00:42:27,443 --> 00:42:29,044
That's real funny.

625
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:30,995
I don't know who you
think you're talking to.

626
00:42:31,063 --> 00:42:32,747
Boys. Hey, quit it!

627
00:42:32,814 --> 00:42:33,931
Now, you're acting like
a couple of children.

628
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:35,099
Jake! Chuck, get him off!

629
00:42:35,251 --> 00:42:36,718
You heard the lady.

630
00:42:36,786 --> 00:42:38,686
Get off me!

631
00:42:40,957 --> 00:42:42,723
How about you two hotheads

632
00:42:42,758 --> 00:42:45,910
settle this over a friendly
little game of cowboy poker

633
00:42:45,978 --> 00:42:47,595
after the rodeo tonight?

634
00:43:02,194 --> 00:43:03,410
Ladies and gentlemen,

635
00:43:03,478 --> 00:43:04,879
this is the final event of the evening.

636
00:43:04,947 --> 00:43:08,900
Hold on to your seats.
It's time for cowboy poker.

637
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:10,217
Introducing our players:

638
00:43:10,286 --> 00:43:11,686
Duane Clint pickens

639
00:43:11,754 --> 00:43:15,289
and Chuck baer, the usual suspects.

640
00:43:15,357 --> 00:43:19,293
Four-time utopia rodeo
champion Jake rustin.

641
00:43:19,361 --> 00:43:21,912
And our final player,
he's a first timer,

642
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,098
so let's give a warm utopia welcome

643
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:27,485
for professional golfer Luke Chisolm.

644
00:43:27,552 --> 00:43:29,070
All right, boys, deal the cards

645
00:43:29,138 --> 00:43:31,289
and let's get this party started.

646
00:43:33,275 --> 00:43:35,193
Time to put up or shut up.

647
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,695
All right. What are we playing?

648
00:43:37,763 --> 00:43:38,946
Texas hold 'em.

649
00:43:39,014 --> 00:43:40,715
Yeah, but there's a catch.

650
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,368
You got to hold on to your chair.

651
00:43:43,436 --> 00:43:44,919
Why?

652
00:43:44,987 --> 00:43:46,237
You'll see.

653
00:43:46,304 --> 00:43:47,889
The last man still in their seat

654
00:43:47,957 --> 00:43:49,040
wins 200 bucks!

655
00:44:01,036 --> 00:44:03,521
Watch out. He's got his sights set

656
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:04,906
on the usual suspects.

657
00:44:06,858 --> 00:44:08,426
Chuck's all in.

658
00:44:13,649 --> 00:44:15,817
Who's cannonball gonna go for next?

659
00:44:15,885 --> 00:44:17,635
Watch out, slim!

660
00:44:17,703 --> 00:44:19,270
Get your butt in the chair.

661
00:44:25,761 --> 00:44:27,311
It's you and me.

662
00:44:27,379 --> 00:44:29,931
See what you got.

663
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:31,515
Boys.

664
00:44:34,953 --> 00:44:37,388
Whoa!

665
00:44:42,277 --> 00:44:45,696
And the winner is the rookie.

666
00:44:53,755 --> 00:44:55,072
Dang it!

667
00:45:10,939 --> 00:45:12,956
Proud of you, son.

668
00:45:17,045 --> 00:45:19,513
Hey, Luke, Luke, what's next for you?

669
00:45:19,582 --> 00:45:20,782
Is it time to go pro?

670
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:25,169
Well, this hasn't even sunk in yet,

671
00:45:25,237 --> 00:45:29,374
so I'm just gonna try to
enjoy this feeling and, uh-

672
00:45:29,441 --> 00:45:31,041
he's a humble kid.

673
00:45:31,109 --> 00:45:33,478
What he means to say is yes.

674
00:45:33,545 --> 00:45:34,612
He will be turning pro.

675
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,113
Of course he'll be turning pro,

676
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:37,682
and we'll begin to look

677
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,684
for a sponsor's exemption immediately.

678
00:45:39,752 --> 00:45:40,885
All right!

679
00:45:42,972 --> 00:45:44,989
Good going, Luke. Yeah!

680
00:45:57,519 --> 00:45:59,603
I'm sorry.

681
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:02,023
Yeah, I know. Laugh it up.

682
00:46:02,091 --> 00:46:03,207
Hey, speaking of manure,

683
00:46:03,275 --> 00:46:05,093
where'd the rhinestone cowboy go?

684
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,460
I was ready to gloat.

685
00:46:06,528 --> 00:46:09,313
Well, Jake went off in a huff.

686
00:46:09,381 --> 00:46:11,465
He's doesn't like to lose.

687
00:46:11,533 --> 00:46:13,917
Well, that makes two of us.

688
00:46:13,952 --> 00:46:17,254
Well, there's more to
life than winning, right?

689
00:46:17,322 --> 00:46:18,789
Like what?

690
00:46:20,408 --> 00:46:22,877
Family. Friendship.

691
00:46:22,945 --> 00:46:25,145
Faith. Love.

692
00:46:25,213 --> 00:46:27,398
Oh, yeah.

693
00:46:27,466 --> 00:46:30,351
I guess those, too.

694
00:46:34,489 --> 00:46:36,874
Johnny's got the horses hitched up.

695
00:46:36,942 --> 00:46:38,776
It's time to go.

696
00:46:40,529 --> 00:46:41,829
You know, cowboy?

697
00:46:41,897 --> 00:46:45,533
Sometimes I think you
might just be hopeless.

698
00:46:50,956 --> 00:46:52,239
Luke.

699
00:46:52,307 --> 00:46:54,358
Get in here, smelly.

700
00:46:54,426 --> 00:46:57,078
Come on in here.

701
00:46:57,145 --> 00:46:58,663
I hung up your masterpiece.

702
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:00,381
You forgot to sign it.

703
00:47:07,322 --> 00:47:08,906
What's this?

704
00:47:08,974 --> 00:47:10,458
Oh, that?

705
00:47:10,526 --> 00:47:12,443
That bottle's my greatest trophy.

706
00:47:13,545 --> 00:47:15,729
No, let me explain.

707
00:47:15,797 --> 00:47:19,984
It's the last liquor I ever drank.

708
00:47:29,144 --> 00:47:31,345
Doesn't it tempt you?

709
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:33,497
No, just the opposite.

710
00:47:33,565 --> 00:47:36,500
Makes me remember all the things I lost

711
00:47:36,568 --> 00:47:40,304
because I drank too much.

712
00:47:40,372 --> 00:47:41,572
That's why I put it there.

713
00:47:42,991 --> 00:47:44,926
Is that why you quit the tour?

714
00:47:46,278 --> 00:47:49,463
Well, more or less, yes.

715
00:47:49,598 --> 00:47:52,516
More or less, yeah.

716
00:47:52,584 --> 00:47:55,803
Pretty hard to drink and drive, eh?

717
00:47:59,308 --> 00:48:01,475
Yeah.

718
00:48:02,944 --> 00:48:04,462
Well, I'm sorry about this morning,

719
00:48:04,529 --> 00:48:05,496
being late and all.

720
00:48:05,564 --> 00:48:07,097
No, no, I'm not. I am not.

721
00:48:07,165 --> 00:48:08,750
Learn how to paint your shot,

722
00:48:08,817 --> 00:48:09,934
you learn how to be on time.

723
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:12,036
A professional golfer does both.

724
00:48:12,103 --> 00:48:16,440
Now, sign your masterpiece, Picasso.

725
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:31,205
Where we headed, anyway?

726
00:48:31,273 --> 00:48:33,791
Going to work on your putting.

727
00:48:33,859 --> 00:48:36,043
Well, the golf course is back that way.

728
00:48:36,111 --> 00:48:38,980
Uh-huh. Yeah, it is.

729
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:47,805
I thought you said we was
going to work on some putting.

730
00:48:47,873 --> 00:48:50,307
That's right. That's right.

731
00:48:50,376 --> 00:48:53,544
We are. Come on.

732
00:48:55,463 --> 00:48:59,550
I hope you brought some of
your winnings from last night.

733
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:07,225
Well played, gentlemen. Well played.

734
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:09,544
Hear, hear. Keep practicing.

735
00:49:09,611 --> 00:49:11,912
Well, look who he
dragged in here with him.

736
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:12,897
You a little stiff this morning?

737
00:49:12,965 --> 00:49:15,116
Still sore I beat you last night.

738
00:49:15,184 --> 00:49:16,266
You better watch it.

739
00:49:16,334 --> 00:49:17,451
Enough of that, Jake, knock it off.

740
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:18,269
Hey, Jake, come on, come on.

741
00:49:18,487 --> 00:49:19,554
Get the washers, all right?

742
00:49:19,621 --> 00:49:22,440
Let's get the game
started here. Come on.

743
00:49:22,507 --> 00:49:24,192
Same old Jake. Come on.

744
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:28,579
Okay. Now, the rules are simple.

745
00:49:28,647 --> 00:49:29,998
The man who's up

746
00:49:30,065 --> 00:49:31,849
pitches from behind the
marker of his choice.

747
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:34,001
Yeah, but I don't see what
this has to do with golf.

748
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:36,003
You just watch. Just watch.

749
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:37,738
Just watch. See?

750
00:49:38,823 --> 00:49:41,375
Ooh! You owe me five bucks, boys.

751
00:49:41,443 --> 00:49:43,510
You ready to give it a try?

752
00:49:43,578 --> 00:49:44,745
Yeah, sure.

753
00:49:44,812 --> 00:49:47,231
Come on. Don't make me look bad, now.

754
00:49:47,298 --> 00:49:49,867
All right, it's on, boys.

755
00:49:49,935 --> 00:49:53,137
There's not a chance he'll make this.

756
00:49:53,205 --> 00:49:55,522
You gonna put your money
where your mouth is?

757
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,692
You're on.

758
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,380
Ho-ho!

759
00:50:03,448 --> 00:50:04,965
Beginner's luck.

760
00:50:05,033 --> 00:50:08,118
Here. Let's see you do that again.

761
00:50:08,186 --> 00:50:10,838
All right. I will.

762
00:50:10,906 --> 00:50:15,042
 Everybody needs a woman's love, now 

763
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,745
yes!

764
00:50:17,812 --> 00:50:19,663
I like this game.

765
00:50:21,132 --> 00:50:22,616
Crazy, cowboy.

766
00:50:22,684 --> 00:50:25,019
Hey, knock it in, man.

767
00:50:25,087 --> 00:50:26,687
Oh!

768
00:50:26,755 --> 00:50:28,506
 I'm gonna move 

769
00:50:28,573 --> 00:50:30,240
 I got to work it on out 

770
00:50:30,308 --> 00:50:31,725
he's better than you!

771
00:50:31,793 --> 00:50:33,727
 Early in the mornin' 

772
00:50:33,795 --> 00:50:36,280
 I play it for you more now 

773
00:50:36,347 --> 00:50:40,083
 bend it on out 

774
00:50:40,151 --> 00:50:41,319
whoo!

775
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:43,237
Yeah! Yeah!

776
00:50:45,107 --> 00:50:48,192
Come on.

777
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,443
Let's go.

778
00:50:50,662 --> 00:50:53,564
We're even.

779
00:50:53,632 --> 00:50:55,116
Come on, slim!

780
00:50:55,183 --> 00:50:57,268
 I like it like that  oh, come on!

781
00:51:01,323 --> 00:51:02,305
Yeah!

782
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:05,809
I'm impressed.

783
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:09,596
Make me proud, son.

784
00:51:09,664 --> 00:51:10,298
You make me proud.

785
00:51:10,365 --> 00:51:12,766
Watch his form.

786
00:51:12,834 --> 00:51:14,635
Right off the fingers.

787
00:51:14,702 --> 00:51:16,553
I'm the rodeo king!

788
00:51:16,621 --> 00:51:17,771
You know what I love
about the cowboy way?

789
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,290
Everything! Hey!

790
00:51:21,893 --> 00:51:23,877
Whoo!

791
00:51:23,945 --> 00:51:25,929
Okay, boys. Let's go. Let's go.

792
00:51:25,997 --> 00:51:27,664
We're going to the links now.

793
00:51:27,732 --> 00:51:29,249
We're gonna do some putting. Let's go.

794
00:51:29,317 --> 00:51:30,717
Come on.

795
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,270
Come on.

796
00:51:34,706 --> 00:51:37,541
Pitching washers...

797
00:51:37,609 --> 00:51:40,961
Give me an idea for a putting technique.

798
00:51:41,029 --> 00:51:42,246
You're kidding, right?

799
00:51:42,314 --> 00:51:43,114
No, no, sir.

800
00:51:43,181 --> 00:51:44,665
I have a respect for tradition,

801
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:47,751
but I have a passion
for the truth, okay?

802
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:51,238
Now, here. Jake?

803
00:51:51,306 --> 00:51:52,406
Yes, sir.

804
00:51:52,473 --> 00:51:54,408
Use the face-on putter.

805
00:51:54,475 --> 00:51:56,660
You use the traditional one.

806
00:51:56,728 --> 00:51:59,029
5 to 1 on Jake.

807
00:51:59,097 --> 00:52:01,549
Quiet in the peanut gallery here.

808
00:52:01,616 --> 00:52:04,051
Come on, Jake. Help me out.

809
00:52:07,422 --> 00:52:08,455
Get in the hole.

810
00:52:08,523 --> 00:52:10,124
Get in the hole!

811
00:52:10,192 --> 00:52:11,758
Yes!

812
00:52:13,645 --> 00:52:16,280
It's gonna be a good day for me.

813
00:52:17,332 --> 00:52:19,316
Good. Good.

814
00:52:19,384 --> 00:52:20,884
You try.

815
00:52:22,287 --> 00:52:24,137
Come on, rookie. Make me some money.

816
00:52:30,311 --> 00:52:31,595
Oh! Oh!

817
00:52:31,663 --> 00:52:33,197
Ooh.

818
00:52:49,547 --> 00:52:51,481
Miss it. Miss it. No, no, no.

819
00:52:51,549 --> 00:52:52,566
Yes!

820
00:52:53,935 --> 00:52:55,886
I'm impressed.

821
00:52:55,954 --> 00:52:57,888
You ready to give this one a try?

822
00:52:57,956 --> 00:52:59,389
Here you go.

823
00:52:59,457 --> 00:53:01,391
When in utopia, right?

824
00:53:03,394 --> 00:53:04,445
Come on. Lets go.

825
00:53:04,513 --> 00:53:06,514
More drinks for me tonight. Let's go.

826
00:53:06,715 --> 00:53:07,615
Ain't no way.

827
00:53:07,682 --> 00:53:09,733
Come on, now.

828
00:53:11,653 --> 00:53:13,937
This look right?

829
00:53:17,025 --> 00:53:18,693
No way. No way.

830
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,061
No-oh, yeah!

831
00:53:20,128 --> 00:53:22,813
Let me ask you something.

832
00:53:22,881 --> 00:53:24,398
Would you or could you

833
00:53:24,466 --> 00:53:26,583
use this in competition?

834
00:53:26,651 --> 00:53:30,504
I'd probably get laughed off the course,

835
00:53:30,572 --> 00:53:32,172
but it definitely works.

836
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,824
Well, you keep it.

837
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:37,286
'Cause when the time comes,

838
00:53:37,321 --> 00:53:39,713
you'll know when to use it.

839
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:40,981
Okay.

840
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:44,067
You have any kids?

841
00:53:44,135 --> 00:53:47,121
No, sir.

842
00:53:47,188 --> 00:53:51,908
That's one of my biggest regrets.

843
00:53:51,976 --> 00:53:54,061
I saw your wedding photo.

844
00:53:54,128 --> 00:53:56,596
Oh, you snooping around again, are you?

845
00:53:56,664 --> 00:53:57,915
You snooping?

846
00:53:57,983 --> 00:53:59,633
You're a super snooper.

847
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,719
I'm sorry.

848
00:54:01,786 --> 00:54:02,853
You're a real snooper.

849
00:54:02,921 --> 00:54:06,574
Well, that's a cool study room.

850
00:54:06,641 --> 00:54:07,791
Pictures of all those legends.

851
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:12,012
No. Annie, my Annie,

852
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,581
couldn't have kids.

853
00:54:14,649 --> 00:54:16,783
She used to joke that
she didn't need any

854
00:54:16,851 --> 00:54:18,318
'cause she had me.

855
00:54:20,404 --> 00:54:21,238
Yeah.

856
00:54:23,258 --> 00:54:26,643
Well, if you don't mind me asking,

857
00:54:26,711 --> 00:54:28,195
what happened?

858
00:54:29,814 --> 00:54:32,499
Well, she's gone on.

859
00:54:32,534 --> 00:54:35,919
Couldn't put up with
my drinking anymore.

860
00:54:35,987 --> 00:54:39,272
Can't say I blame her.

861
00:54:40,892 --> 00:54:42,860
Sorry to hear that.

862
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:46,447
Yeah, well...

863
00:54:46,514 --> 00:54:51,285
Gone but not forgotten.

864
00:54:51,353 --> 00:54:54,188
As they say...

865
00:54:54,256 --> 00:54:56,940
All part of God's plan.

866
00:54:57,008 --> 00:54:59,243
Yeah, I suppose.

867
00:55:00,862 --> 00:55:02,730
Good night.

868
00:55:02,797 --> 00:55:04,532
Night.

869
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:07,384
I'll see you in the morning.

870
00:55:07,452 --> 00:55:09,070
You bet.

871
00:55:11,907 --> 00:55:13,323
Let me guess.

872
00:55:13,391 --> 00:55:14,691
This is where you drop me off

873
00:55:14,759 --> 00:55:16,010
in the middle of nowhere.

874
00:55:16,077 --> 00:55:17,795
And expect me to get back home

875
00:55:17,862 --> 00:55:18,846
with the clothes on my back

876
00:55:18,914 --> 00:55:20,230
and two golf tees in my pocket.

877
00:55:20,298 --> 00:55:22,432
That'd be way too easy.

878
00:55:38,183 --> 00:55:39,650
That's it. Wow.

879
00:55:39,717 --> 00:55:40,785
Is this yours?

880
00:55:40,852 --> 00:55:42,820
Yes, she is.

881
00:55:42,887 --> 00:55:45,839
Um... you're not planning

882
00:55:45,907 --> 00:55:48,074
on going up in this
thing though, are you?

883
00:55:48,142 --> 00:55:49,242
Well, why not?

884
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:51,779
I mean, flying's a lot like golf.

885
00:55:51,846 --> 00:55:53,380
Eh?

886
00:55:53,448 --> 00:55:57,050
You said fly fishing
was a lot like golf.

887
00:55:57,118 --> 00:55:58,351
Did I say that?

888
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,903
Yeah.

889
00:55:59,971 --> 00:56:01,922
Maybe I did. You ready?

890
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:03,390
No way.

891
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:04,240
What?

892
00:56:04,308 --> 00:56:06,460
I'm keeping my feet on the ground today.

893
00:56:06,528 --> 00:56:08,111
Oh, yeah?

894
00:56:08,179 --> 00:56:09,863
Whoa. I don't know about this, Johnny.

895
00:56:10,015 --> 00:56:11,064
Let's turn back.

896
00:56:11,132 --> 00:56:12,983
Your feet control
direction with the rudder.

897
00:56:13,051 --> 00:56:15,936
The stick controls the wind and pitch.

898
00:56:16,004 --> 00:56:18,121
Now, to turn, you press one foot

899
00:56:18,189 --> 00:56:20,123
and you turn the wheel
in that direction.

900
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:22,392
And to go up or down, push or pull.

901
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,393
Got it?

902
00:56:23,461 --> 00:56:24,594
Okay.

903
00:56:24,662 --> 00:56:27,915
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

904
00:56:27,982 --> 00:56:29,983
Okay. No hands, see? Like this.

905
00:56:30,051 --> 00:56:31,368
You're doing good.

906
00:56:31,435 --> 00:56:32,953
All right. I'm getting
it now. I'm getting it.

907
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:33,987
I think I'm getting it.

908
00:56:34,055 --> 00:56:35,088
It's like riding a horse.

909
00:56:35,156 --> 00:56:36,473
Keep her steady.

910
00:56:36,541 --> 00:56:38,859
Uh-oh. What's...

911
00:56:38,926 --> 00:56:40,410
What? Wait, wait, wait.

912
00:56:40,478 --> 00:56:42,346
What just happened? What-Johnny?

913
00:56:42,414 --> 00:56:43,697
Hold on. Hold on.

914
00:56:43,765 --> 00:56:44,898
What happened?

915
00:56:44,966 --> 00:56:46,951
We have an emergency.
We have an emergency.

916
00:56:47,018 --> 00:56:48,118
Put the plane down.

917
00:56:48,186 --> 00:56:49,419
Johnny, you take it. You take it.

918
00:56:49,487 --> 00:56:52,473
You take control of this aircraft, son.

919
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,189
All right?

920
00:56:53,257 --> 00:56:54,441
I don't know what to do.

921
00:56:54,509 --> 00:56:55,709
Keep the nose down and level the wings.

922
00:56:55,776 --> 00:56:56,744
Okay. All right?

923
00:56:56,812 --> 00:56:57,995
All right.

924
00:56:58,063 --> 00:57:00,580
That's good. Good.

925
00:57:00,648 --> 00:57:02,232
How's that? All right.

926
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,534
We should try to go back, shouldn't we?

927
00:57:04,602 --> 00:57:05,619
No, we can't get back.

928
00:57:05,737 --> 00:57:06,970
We'll have to find a place around here.

929
00:57:07,238 --> 00:57:07,888
Come on. Come on.

930
00:57:07,956 --> 00:57:09,289
There's a wheat field.

931
00:57:09,357 --> 00:57:11,225
All right. Good.
You're doing great, son.

932
00:57:11,292 --> 00:57:13,476
Keep your wits about you, okay?

933
00:57:13,544 --> 00:57:15,712
Level your wings. You
got 500 feet to go.

934
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,130
How about that?

935
00:57:17,198 --> 00:57:17,948
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're doing great.

936
00:57:18,015 --> 00:57:20,384
Steady. Steady.

937
00:57:20,452 --> 00:57:23,453
Steady. Bring it in.
Bring it in. Steady.

938
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:25,672
Keep the wings level.
Keep the wings level.

939
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,440
Okay.

940
00:57:26,508 --> 00:57:27,858
Leveling my wings.

941
00:57:27,926 --> 00:57:29,326
Is this good? We good?

942
00:57:29,393 --> 00:57:30,560
Great. You're doing great.

943
00:57:30,628 --> 00:57:32,313
Leveling. Leveling.

944
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:35,665
Bring it in. Bring it in.

945
00:57:37,285 --> 00:57:38,602
Coming in. Coming in.

946
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:39,953
Wait.

947
00:57:40,021 --> 00:57:42,990
Wait. What happened here?

948
00:57:43,058 --> 00:57:44,741
Goodness me.

949
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:47,027
The engine turned off.

950
00:57:47,094 --> 00:57:48,245
Did you turn the engine off?

951
00:57:48,313 --> 00:57:49,913
The engine turned off?

952
00:57:49,981 --> 00:57:51,965
Is this your idea of a sick joke?

953
00:57:52,734 --> 00:57:53,901
Why are you laughing?

954
00:57:55,487 --> 00:57:59,173
Confidence comes with
being prepared, my son.

955
00:57:59,241 --> 00:58:02,409
As in golf or life hand in hand.

956
00:58:04,212 --> 00:58:06,229
I'm about to throw up over here.

957
00:58:06,297 --> 00:58:07,497
You can't play in a tournament

958
00:58:07,565 --> 00:58:09,866
unless you're ready for the unexpected

959
00:58:09,934 --> 00:58:11,251
on game day.

960
00:58:11,318 --> 00:58:14,054
It smells delicious.

961
00:58:14,121 --> 00:58:15,306
Mabel's trout's famous around here.

962
00:58:15,373 --> 00:58:17,308
More famous than her pies?

963
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:19,310
Couldn't be more famous.

964
00:58:19,377 --> 00:58:20,911
As famous, maybe.

965
00:58:20,979 --> 00:58:23,129
But more famous?

966
00:58:37,545 --> 00:58:40,664
For food in a world
where many walk in hunger,

967
00:58:40,731 --> 00:58:44,217
for faith in a world
where many walk in fear,

968
00:58:44,285 --> 00:58:49,906
for friends in a world
where many walk alone,

969
00:58:49,974 --> 00:58:52,642
we give you thanks, o lord. Amen.

970
00:58:52,894 --> 00:58:55,445
Amen. Amen.

971
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:03,437
He definitely puts the game first.

972
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,609
Reminds me of someone
else I used to know.

973
00:59:10,228 --> 00:59:12,162
That he does.

974
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:14,681
Hopefully he finds his
way quicker than me.

975
00:59:17,652 --> 00:59:18,668
Hey, there, stranger.

976
00:59:18,736 --> 00:59:20,253
Hey.

977
00:59:20,321 --> 00:59:22,856
So when's the last time
you caught a firefly?

978
00:59:22,924 --> 00:59:24,941
Well, I don't know.

979
00:59:25,009 --> 00:59:27,144
Since I was a little kid.

980
00:59:27,212 --> 00:59:30,447
Well, that's too long.

981
00:59:30,515 --> 00:59:32,465
Come on.

982
00:59:35,436 --> 00:59:37,337
She has Paul's gift.

983
00:59:37,405 --> 00:59:41,758
She always was a daddy's girl.

984
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:55,455
It's okay.

985
00:59:55,523 --> 00:59:57,107
Hey, Sarah.

986
00:59:57,175 --> 00:59:58,575
What?

987
00:59:58,642 --> 01:00:01,044
These ones in here quit making light.

988
01:00:01,112 --> 01:00:03,113
That's 'cause they know they're trapped.

989
01:00:03,181 --> 01:00:05,299
It makes their lights go out.

990
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:10,437
Watch this.

991
01:00:18,263 --> 01:00:20,814
Freedom's a powerful force.

992
01:00:32,877 --> 01:00:34,511
Not yet.

993
01:00:39,384 --> 01:00:40,734
I'm sorry.

994
01:00:43,887 --> 01:00:45,455
No, I-

995
01:00:45,523 --> 01:00:47,657
it doesn't mean never.

996
01:01:20,191 --> 01:01:23,460
It's gonna... It's gonna rain.

997
01:01:23,527 --> 01:01:25,012
Ready for today's lesson?

998
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:26,179
I can only imagine

999
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:28,114
what you got in store for me today.

1000
01:01:28,182 --> 01:01:30,701
Yes, sir. Today we play golf.

1001
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:34,821
Good. What should I hit, a driver?

1002
01:01:34,889 --> 01:01:36,239
No, no, no, no.

1003
01:01:36,307 --> 01:01:40,060
Today we visit the history of the game

1004
01:01:40,127 --> 01:01:41,478
and its future.

1005
01:01:41,546 --> 01:01:43,447
You're gonna be playing
with hickory sticks

1006
01:01:43,515 --> 01:01:45,565
and a face-on putter.

1007
01:01:46,667 --> 01:01:47,851
Ooh.

1008
01:01:47,918 --> 01:01:49,119
Not bad.

1009
01:01:49,187 --> 01:01:50,721
Perfect.

1010
01:01:50,788 --> 01:01:52,689
S.F.T.

1011
01:01:52,756 --> 01:01:53,957
One for you.

1012
01:01:56,978 --> 01:01:59,179
See it. Feel it.

1013
01:01:59,364 --> 01:02:00,330
Trust it.

1014
01:02:00,398 --> 01:02:02,682
Little butter cut over that left tree.

1015
01:02:03,801 --> 01:02:05,001
How far?

1016
01:02:05,069 --> 01:02:06,936
About 310.

1017
01:02:07,004 --> 01:02:08,671
210.

1018
01:02:08,706 --> 01:02:10,557
What's the course record?

1019
01:02:10,624 --> 01:02:13,844
Well, you ever shot a 59?

1020
01:02:13,912 --> 01:02:16,563
You keep playing this
way, you just might.

1021
01:02:17,465 --> 01:02:18,899
Weather permitting, of course.

1022
01:02:27,441 --> 01:02:29,158
Yes, sir. Boom.

1023
01:02:29,226 --> 01:02:31,311
Not sure we can get this round in.

1024
01:02:31,379 --> 01:02:33,363
There ain't nothing stopping me.

1025
01:02:33,431 --> 01:02:35,365
I'm seeing it, feeling it,

1026
01:02:35,433 --> 01:02:37,300
and trusting it.

1027
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:01,074
It's time to wrap it up, son.

1028
01:03:01,141 --> 01:03:03,059
It's not the time to
start playing it safe.

1029
01:03:03,127 --> 01:03:04,410
We got one more hole.

1030
01:03:04,479 --> 01:03:07,230
No, no, no. 59 doesn't matter, Luke.

1031
01:03:07,298 --> 01:03:08,181
It's matters to me.

1032
01:03:08,249 --> 01:03:09,365
That's not the lesson.

1033
01:03:09,634 --> 01:03:10,283
That was never the lesson.

1034
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:11,835
You spent the whole week

1035
01:03:11,902 --> 01:03:14,271
teaching me how to play
the best golf of my life.

1036
01:03:14,339 --> 01:03:16,356
Now I'm playing it.

1037
01:03:22,379 --> 01:03:25,231
All right. Well, you don't have
to prove anything to me, Luke,

1038
01:03:25,299 --> 01:03:26,667
because I'm not your father.

1039
01:03:26,734 --> 01:03:29,703
You don't know anything
about my dad, so back off.

1040
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:31,621
No, you can't spend your life

1041
01:03:31,689 --> 01:03:33,473
trying to validate
yourself with a golf score.

1042
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:34,825
Well, how would you know?

1043
01:03:34,892 --> 01:03:36,393
It looks to me like
you quit on your dream,

1044
01:03:36,461 --> 01:03:38,712
living out here on this
God forsaken goat ranch.

1045
01:03:38,779 --> 01:03:40,297
And this is your dream today?

1046
01:03:40,364 --> 01:03:41,681
This? This is your dream?

1047
01:03:50,725 --> 01:03:51,908
You can lead a horse to water,

1048
01:03:51,975 --> 01:03:54,077
but you can't make him drink.

1049
01:04:46,331 --> 01:04:47,364
I'm sorry, Johnny.

1050
01:04:47,431 --> 01:04:50,817
I forgive you, son.

1051
01:05:02,129 --> 01:05:04,047
Whose grave you digging?

1052
01:05:04,114 --> 01:05:07,234
You'll soon see.

1053
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:12,722
What's yours gonna say?

1054
01:05:16,561 --> 01:05:17,877
Mine?

1055
01:05:17,945 --> 01:05:21,898
Yeah, your epitaph, your headstone.

1056
01:05:21,965 --> 01:05:24,501
What do you want people to say about you

1057
01:05:24,568 --> 01:05:28,455
when you're gone, huh?

1058
01:05:30,941 --> 01:05:34,844
Maybe it'll say you shot a 59.

1059
01:05:37,014 --> 01:05:37,564
Huh?

1060
01:05:37,632 --> 01:05:41,501
I never thought of it like that.

1061
01:05:41,569 --> 01:05:46,572
Maybe we'll just leave it blank for now.

1062
01:05:51,262 --> 01:05:53,896
No. I mean...

1063
01:05:53,964 --> 01:05:57,100
I'd want it to say...

1064
01:06:00,304 --> 01:06:01,738
Something.

1065
01:06:03,157 --> 01:06:07,060
It will.

1066
01:06:07,128 --> 01:06:13,450
But I don't think that
your coming here...

1067
01:06:13,518 --> 01:06:15,919
Was an accident.

1068
01:06:17,704 --> 01:06:18,755
But only you can decide

1069
01:06:18,823 --> 01:06:20,423
what to do from here on out,

1070
01:06:20,491 --> 01:06:22,759
'cause, I mean,

1071
01:06:22,827 --> 01:06:27,214
there's nothing more
I can teach you, son.

1072
01:06:36,523 --> 01:06:38,608
Thank you, Johnny.

1073
01:06:38,676 --> 01:06:41,361
No, don't thank me.

1074
01:06:41,429 --> 01:06:43,463
Thank him.

1075
01:06:43,531 --> 01:06:46,199
'Cause God is all around us.

1076
01:06:46,267 --> 01:06:51,020
Inside of each of us, if you listen...

1077
01:06:51,088 --> 01:06:54,123
There's a still small voice of truth

1078
01:06:54,191 --> 01:06:55,809
leading us...

1079
01:06:57,761 --> 01:06:59,696
Talking to us,

1080
01:06:59,763 --> 01:07:01,448
and telling you

1081
01:07:01,516 --> 01:07:03,650
that you...

1082
01:07:06,837 --> 01:07:08,938
Can see God's face...

1083
01:07:11,375 --> 01:07:14,660
Feel his presence...

1084
01:07:14,728 --> 01:07:17,113
Trust his love.

1085
01:07:17,181 --> 01:07:19,199
Yeah.

1086
01:07:19,267 --> 01:07:21,901
S.F.T.

1087
01:07:21,969 --> 01:07:24,020
Huh?

1088
01:07:26,524 --> 01:07:27,974
S.F.T.

1089
01:07:29,259 --> 01:07:31,294
God bless you.

1090
01:07:31,362 --> 01:07:32,912
Happy easter.

1091
01:08:04,111 --> 01:08:06,279
Luke, inside this box

1092
01:08:06,347 --> 01:08:09,182
is a pencil and two pieces of paper.

1093
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:12,635
One is for writing down
all the truths you learned

1094
01:08:12,703 --> 01:08:15,321
during your time here in utopia.

1095
01:08:15,389 --> 01:08:19,359
The truth that life is
about faith, relationships,

1096
01:08:19,426 --> 01:08:21,678
character, and integrity.

1097
01:08:21,746 --> 01:08:24,614
That God has a purpose
and calling for you

1098
01:08:24,682 --> 01:08:25,948
that is much deeper

1099
01:08:26,016 --> 01:08:28,785
than a little white ball
falling into the cup.

1100
01:08:28,853 --> 01:08:32,188
These truths will become
your new heartbeat,

1101
01:08:32,256 --> 01:08:34,674
the foundation of your new life.

1102
01:08:34,741 --> 01:08:36,860
The other piece of paper

1103
01:08:36,928 --> 01:08:38,294
is for writing down all the lies

1104
01:08:38,362 --> 01:08:40,897
you've been told during your life.

1105
01:08:40,965 --> 01:08:42,298
Lies like your golf score

1106
01:08:42,567 --> 01:08:45,385
being a reflection of your true identity

1107
01:08:45,453 --> 01:08:46,719
and self-worth,

1108
01:08:46,787 --> 01:08:48,388
or that failure in golf

1109
01:08:48,456 --> 01:08:50,357
is failure in life.

1110
01:08:50,424 --> 01:08:52,242
Take the truths with you,

1111
01:08:52,309 --> 01:08:56,929
but bury the lies right here, right now.

1112
01:08:56,997 --> 01:09:00,183
Once you have buried your lies,

1113
01:09:00,251 --> 01:09:02,919
chisel your living epitaph.

1114
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:08,658
 Today I found myself 

1115
01:09:08,725 --> 01:09:15,682
 after searching all these years 

1116
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:18,134
 and the man that I saw 

1117
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:19,902
 he wasn't at all 

1118
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:24,273
 who I thought he'd be 

1119
01:09:24,341 --> 01:09:29,679
 I was lost when you found me here 

1120
01:09:29,747 --> 01:09:35,484
 I was broken beyond repair 

1121
01:09:35,552 --> 01:09:38,487
 then you came along 

1122
01:09:38,555 --> 01:09:40,823
 and you sang your song 

1123
01:09:40,891 --> 01:09:46,780
 over me 

1124
01:09:46,847 --> 01:09:51,050
 it feels like I'm born again 

1125
01:09:51,118 --> 01:09:56,539
 it feels like I'm living 

1126
01:09:56,606 --> 01:10:00,110
 for the very first time 

1127
01:10:00,177 --> 01:10:04,814
 I'm living for the first time 

1128
01:10:04,882 --> 01:10:08,868
 it feels like I'm born again 

1129
01:10:08,935 --> 01:10:13,956
 it feels like I'm living 

1130
01:10:14,024 --> 01:10:22,649
 for the very first time 

1131
01:10:22,716 --> 01:10:27,370
 it feels like I'm breathing 

1132
01:10:27,438 --> 01:10:32,192
 it feels like I'm moving 

1133
01:10:32,259 --> 01:10:35,328
 for the very first time 

1134
01:10:35,396 --> 01:10:40,516
 in my life 

1135
01:11:00,738 --> 01:11:02,955
all ready to go, are we?

1136
01:11:03,023 --> 01:11:05,641
Yeah, I think so.

1137
01:11:05,709 --> 01:11:06,993
Don't think.

1138
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:10,179
See, feel, trust.

1139
01:11:12,099 --> 01:11:13,082
Yeah.

1140
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:15,167
Now, before you leave,

1141
01:11:15,235 --> 01:11:16,819
I have something for you.

1142
01:11:16,887 --> 01:11:18,488
I have something here.

1143
01:11:18,556 --> 01:11:23,859
Well, you've given me
more than I can repay, sir.

1144
01:11:23,927 --> 01:11:26,079
Well, gifts aren't meant to be repaid.

1145
01:11:26,147 --> 01:11:28,614
They're meant to be passed along.

1146
01:11:28,683 --> 01:11:30,183
Look at this.

1147
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:34,721
That was my last tournament.

1148
01:11:34,788 --> 01:11:35,871
You notice anything?

1149
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,223
Huh?

1150
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:40,827
Well, you're not on the leaderboard.

1151
01:11:40,895 --> 01:11:43,279
Yeah, that, but no.
Look again. Look again.

1152
01:11:43,347 --> 01:11:44,447
Look.

1153
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:49,352
Oh, it's the Texas open.

1154
01:11:49,419 --> 01:11:50,186
Right.

1155
01:11:50,254 --> 01:11:51,387
That's this weekend.

1156
01:11:51,455 --> 01:11:53,890
Yeah. The tournament's main sponsor

1157
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:55,058
is an old friend.

1158
01:11:55,075 --> 01:11:56,409
He says as a personal favor

1159
01:11:56,477 --> 01:12:01,064
he'll offer you one
of his free exemptions.

1160
01:12:02,299 --> 01:12:04,633
All right?

1161
01:12:04,701 --> 01:12:07,486
Huh?

1162
01:12:07,554 --> 01:12:09,471
Man.

1163
01:12:14,912 --> 01:12:16,846
I don't...

1164
01:12:16,914 --> 01:12:18,198
I don't know what to say.

1165
01:12:18,265 --> 01:12:20,116
Well, I think, between you and me,

1166
01:12:20,184 --> 01:12:22,318
it's all about the ratings.

1167
01:12:22,386 --> 01:12:24,537
He's probably hoping you
have another meltdown,

1168
01:12:24,605 --> 01:12:27,757
and I'm hoping that
you can prove him wrong.

1169
01:12:27,825 --> 01:12:29,609
Yeah.

1170
01:12:29,677 --> 01:12:31,377
Well, you can count on it.

1171
01:12:31,445 --> 01:12:32,612
Oh, yeah.

1172
01:12:38,218 --> 01:12:41,120
Now, don't go running
over any of them cows,

1173
01:12:41,188 --> 01:12:43,439
because I don't want you to ruin my pie.

1174
01:12:43,507 --> 01:12:44,690
Well, don't worry.

1175
01:12:44,759 --> 01:12:46,242
I can see a little better now.

1176
01:12:46,594 --> 01:12:47,159
Yeah, you can.

1177
01:12:47,227 --> 01:12:50,630
Okay. God bless you, son.

1178
01:12:50,697 --> 01:12:52,215
God bless you.

1179
01:12:53,717 --> 01:12:55,835
Aw, I'm gonna miss you.

1180
01:12:55,902 --> 01:12:57,420
I'm gonna miss y'all, too.

1181
01:12:57,487 --> 01:12:59,839
Thank you so much for everything.

1182
01:12:59,906 --> 01:13:01,357
You bet.

1183
01:13:09,816 --> 01:13:12,785
Got you a little gift.

1184
01:13:12,852 --> 01:13:14,854
Just keep the lid off it

1185
01:13:14,922 --> 01:13:16,956
and you can come visit
whenever you want.

1186
01:13:17,024 --> 01:13:19,558
Well...

1187
01:13:22,129 --> 01:13:24,213
Till next time, then.

1188
01:13:24,281 --> 01:13:25,665
Next time.

1189
01:13:40,831 --> 01:13:42,582
You need any more putting lessons,

1190
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:44,133
you just let me know.

1191
01:13:47,588 --> 01:13:48,955
Hey, tour boy.

1192
01:13:54,945 --> 01:13:56,278
Well, if you need some lessons

1193
01:13:56,346 --> 01:13:58,114
on some cowboy poker,

1194
01:13:58,182 --> 01:14:02,518
well, you're just gonna have
to figure it out yourself.

1195
01:14:07,091 --> 01:14:08,357
Johnny.

1196
01:14:08,425 --> 01:14:09,842
Yeah.

1197
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:11,344
Thank you for everything.

1198
01:14:11,411 --> 01:14:14,831
No, I wanna thank you for everything.

1199
01:14:14,898 --> 01:14:16,632
I really do.

1200
01:14:18,452 --> 01:14:19,719
Yeah.

1201
01:14:26,393 --> 01:14:30,330
And, son, I do believe.

1202
01:14:30,397 --> 01:14:31,798
Okay?

1203
01:14:31,865 --> 01:14:32,799
Yes, sir.

1204
01:14:32,816 --> 01:14:35,501
God bless you.

1205
01:14:35,569 --> 01:14:36,803
Thank you.

1206
01:15:28,722 --> 01:15:30,990
Let's get you something to eat.

1207
01:15:31,058 --> 01:15:32,558
Yes, mom.

1208
01:15:44,838 --> 01:15:47,173
Hey, bud.

1209
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:51,076
I got you a little present.

1210
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:56,315
Callaway's latest and greatest.

1211
01:16:01,588 --> 01:16:03,356
Thanks, dad.

1212
01:16:14,935 --> 01:16:19,021
Luke, uh...

1213
01:16:19,089 --> 01:16:23,025
My actions last week...

1214
01:16:23,093 --> 01:16:26,529
Were wrong.

1215
01:16:26,596 --> 01:16:31,967
I pushed you your whole
life to succeed at golf,

1216
01:16:32,035 --> 01:16:33,969
and I never once asked

1217
01:16:34,037 --> 01:16:35,971
if that's what you wanted.

1218
01:16:39,242 --> 01:16:40,827
I'm sorry for that.

1219
01:16:44,081 --> 01:16:46,231
Well, I forgive you.

1220
01:16:48,669 --> 01:16:51,187
I only want what's best for you.

1221
01:16:55,308 --> 01:16:56,776
I know.

1222
01:16:59,996 --> 01:17:02,831
I love you, dad.

1223
01:17:02,899 --> 01:17:04,917
I love you, too, son.

1224
01:17:09,239 --> 01:17:10,973
Well...

1225
01:17:12,659 --> 01:17:15,878
Ain't looked at mine in a while.

1226
01:17:17,314 --> 01:17:19,265
Might be overdue.

1227
01:17:23,036 --> 01:17:25,104
Good night, son.

1228
01:17:25,171 --> 01:17:26,806
Welcome home.

1229
01:17:28,775 --> 01:17:31,694
Hey, dad.

1230
01:17:31,762 --> 01:17:35,248
Yeah?

1231
01:17:35,315 --> 01:17:36,999
I almost forgot.

1232
01:17:39,636 --> 01:17:42,704
You wanna caddy for me
this week in the Texas open?

1233
01:17:58,805 --> 01:18:00,089
Welcome, everyone,

1234
01:18:00,157 --> 01:18:02,091
to the pride of the lone star state,

1235
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:03,559
the Valero Texas open.

1236
01:18:03,626 --> 01:18:04,726
I'm Kelly Tilghman

1237
01:18:04,794 --> 01:18:07,263
with pga tour winner Brandel Chamblee.

1238
01:18:07,331 --> 01:18:09,248
A compelling story this week, Brandel,

1239
01:18:09,316 --> 01:18:11,150
was the sponsor invite, Luke Chisolm.

1240
01:18:11,218 --> 01:18:12,318
How does one go

1241
01:18:12,386 --> 01:18:14,153
from oblivion to center stage?

1242
01:18:14,221 --> 01:18:15,754
This man knows, Kelly.

1243
01:18:15,822 --> 01:18:17,556
In his first pga tour event,

1244
01:18:17,624 --> 01:18:19,609
he has a chance for redemption.

1245
01:18:19,676 --> 01:18:20,759
Now on the first tee,

1246
01:18:20,827 --> 01:18:23,262
from waco, Texas, Luke Chisolm.

1247
01:18:38,562 --> 01:18:39,729
Round two and three

1248
01:18:39,863 --> 01:18:41,364
saw heated action atop the leaderboard.

1249
01:18:41,431 --> 01:18:42,865
Some of golf's biggest names

1250
01:18:42,932 --> 01:18:43,899
pining for the lead.

1251
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,968
Rich beem, Stewart Cink,

1252
01:18:46,036 --> 01:18:48,487
TKO, and Ricky Fowler.

1253
01:18:54,528 --> 01:18:57,145
Come on, TKO!

1254
01:18:57,213 --> 01:18:58,497
This pressure-filled Sunday

1255
01:18:58,565 --> 01:18:59,598
at the Texas open

1256
01:18:59,767 --> 01:19:01,501
offers an abundance of characters.

1257
01:19:01,568 --> 01:19:05,404
Stewart Cink, four
time masters champ TKO,

1258
01:19:05,472 --> 01:19:08,123
and we have a local
talent with fresh wounds.

1259
01:19:08,191 --> 01:19:09,625
The surprise performance

1260
01:19:09,693 --> 01:19:12,961
coming from Luke Chisolm,
just two weeks removed

1261
01:19:13,029 --> 01:19:14,547
from that complete meltdown

1262
01:19:14,614 --> 01:19:16,632
at the lone star event in San Antonio.

1263
01:19:16,699 --> 01:19:18,867
And now, he finds himself chasing,

1264
01:19:18,935 --> 01:19:21,587
of all people, TKO,
atop the leaderboard.

1265
01:19:21,655 --> 01:19:24,240
And, Kelly, you really
couldn't script it

1266
01:19:24,307 --> 01:19:25,140
any better than this.

1267
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:26,492
No. No, you can't Brandel.

1268
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,444
We've seen cinderella stories before,

1269
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,761
but we've also seen

1270
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:31,413
what TKO has done to
those glass slippers.

1271
01:19:31,481 --> 01:19:32,731
He has crushed them.

1272
01:19:32,799 --> 01:19:33,982
And we pick up with Luke Chisolm

1273
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:36,835
now on the 10th tee.

1274
01:19:38,255 --> 01:19:39,555
Let's hit 3-wood.

1275
01:19:39,623 --> 01:19:41,941
Fairway's a little tight.

1276
01:19:43,627 --> 01:19:45,428
Chisolm playing it safe here

1277
01:19:45,495 --> 01:19:48,631
with the 3-wood on this
very reachable par 5.

1278
01:20:02,595 --> 01:20:04,112
That's okay, Luke.

1279
01:20:05,465 --> 01:20:07,483
And that shot will very likely

1280
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:09,285
put some demons in his head.

1281
01:20:09,352 --> 01:20:11,370
It was a shot almost identical to that

1282
01:20:11,437 --> 01:20:14,106
that started his monumental blowup

1283
01:20:14,174 --> 01:20:15,440
a few weeks ago.

1284
01:20:15,508 --> 01:20:17,509
Luke's gonna have to
conquer those demons

1285
01:20:17,577 --> 01:20:19,128
if he wants to win,

1286
01:20:19,195 --> 01:20:21,496
and that's one of the
toughest things to do in golf.

1287
01:20:21,564 --> 01:20:23,782
Well, what you want to do, son?

1288
01:20:28,037 --> 01:20:30,506
Go back to the tee.

1289
01:20:35,062 --> 01:20:36,529
Head up, Luke.

1290
01:20:39,933 --> 01:20:43,402
Well, it's gonna be
one heck of a par, dad.

1291
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:44,820
Oh, you got it.

1292
01:20:46,406 --> 01:20:49,408
Having taken an unplayable
lie on his first drive,

1293
01:20:49,476 --> 01:20:51,343
Chisolm is now back on the tee

1294
01:20:51,411 --> 01:20:52,545
hitting his third shot.

1295
01:20:52,662 --> 01:20:53,729
Looks like he's going

1296
01:20:53,796 --> 01:20:54,763
with the driver this time, Brandel.

1297
01:20:54,831 --> 01:20:56,031
And Kelly, I don't know why

1298
01:20:56,099 --> 01:20:57,433
he didn't use driver
the first go around.

1299
01:20:57,667 --> 01:20:59,635
He hasn't sniffed missing a tee shot

1300
01:20:59,703 --> 01:21:02,838
all week long with that
callaway octane driver.

1301
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:45,347
Perfect!

1302
01:21:45,415 --> 01:21:47,883
Exactly as he has all week long.

1303
01:21:47,918 --> 01:21:50,352
See you in the clubhouse, boys.

1304
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:52,137
Y'all play well.

1305
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:55,674
A par after taking an unplayable

1306
01:21:55,742 --> 01:21:59,128
could be a turning point for Chisolm.

1307
01:22:03,683 --> 01:22:06,118
This Sunday has given
us a great leaderboard.

1308
01:22:06,153 --> 01:22:08,403
Rich beem capable of a big charge,

1309
01:22:08,438 --> 01:22:09,655
question marks surrounding Luke Chisolm,

1310
01:22:09,722 --> 01:22:11,841
and TKO as intimidating as ever.

1311
01:22:11,941 --> 01:22:14,427
But it looks like we're
winding down to just two.

1312
01:22:14,494 --> 01:22:16,778
A classic David and Goliath story

1313
01:22:16,846 --> 01:22:18,730
between Chisolm and TKO.

1314
01:22:21,585 --> 01:22:24,603
Chisolm from 12 feet...

1315
01:22:24,671 --> 01:22:26,304
And he sinks it!

1316
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,607
Luke Chisolm just one back of TKO.

1317
01:22:28,675 --> 01:22:30,442
You know he's licking
his chops right here,

1318
01:22:30,477 --> 01:22:31,576
not only to make birdie,

1319
01:22:31,644 --> 01:22:33,312
but to put the pressure on TKO

1320
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:35,781
to do the same and avoid a playoff.

1321
01:22:35,849 --> 01:22:38,467
Remember, TKO eagled
this hole yesterday.

1322
01:22:38,534 --> 01:22:40,669
And now Luke Chisolm
with his second shot

1323
01:22:40,737 --> 01:22:43,071
to this par 4 on the 18th hole.

1324
01:23:03,243 --> 01:23:05,027
Yeah!

1325
01:23:17,974 --> 01:23:20,726
The pressure is really on TKO now.

1326
01:23:20,793 --> 01:23:24,045
He has no choice but
to go for the green.

1327
01:23:26,216 --> 01:23:28,100
This one's looking good, Brandel.

1328
01:23:28,168 --> 01:23:32,087
It's on the green
with a chance at eagle.

1329
01:23:32,155 --> 01:23:34,957
He makes it look easy,
doesn't he, Kelly?

1330
01:23:39,495 --> 01:23:42,714
What an answer by the
steely veteran TKO,

1331
01:23:42,782 --> 01:23:44,149
who drove the green.

1332
01:23:44,217 --> 01:23:47,620
If he makes this eagle putt, he wins.

1333
01:23:59,633 --> 01:24:00,866
And how's this for excitement?

1334
01:24:00,933 --> 01:24:03,953
Tko and Chisolm are headed to a playoff,

1335
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:05,821
both men tied at 16 under.

1336
01:24:05,889 --> 01:24:07,656
And TKO has the upper hand once again.

1337
01:24:07,724 --> 01:24:09,124
He's never been defeated in a playoff

1338
01:24:09,191 --> 01:24:10,392
on the pga tour,

1339
01:24:10,459 --> 01:24:12,961
and Luke Chisolm, his
first taste in extra holes.

1340
01:24:13,113 --> 01:24:14,879
They're going back to the 18th tee,

1341
01:24:14,947 --> 01:24:16,781
where anything can happen.

1342
01:24:23,723 --> 01:24:26,625
Tko and Luke Chisolm
are about to tee off

1343
01:24:26,927 --> 01:24:28,711
on one of the greatest risk/reward holes

1344
01:24:28,778 --> 01:24:29,879
in all of golf.

1345
01:24:29,946 --> 01:24:31,897
And earlier, Brandel had a chance

1346
01:24:31,964 --> 01:24:35,651
to take a closer look at this
tremendous finishing hole.

1347
01:24:35,686 --> 01:24:38,036
The finishing hole here is a great one.

1348
01:24:38,104 --> 01:24:40,806
A drivable par 4 of 355 yards

1349
01:24:40,874 --> 01:24:42,208
that plays downhill

1350
01:24:42,275 --> 01:24:43,958
and gives the players a lot of choices.

1351
01:24:44,026 --> 01:24:46,328
But those choices come with risks.

1352
01:24:46,396 --> 01:24:48,897
The green is protected
by a tree and a bunker

1353
01:24:48,965 --> 01:24:50,548
and a treacherous water hazard.

1354
01:24:50,616 --> 01:24:53,902
The green itself is
very narrow and fast,

1355
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:55,120
with a lot of slope in it.

1356
01:24:55,188 --> 01:24:56,304
And a two-putt from above the hole

1357
01:24:56,372 --> 01:24:58,306
is highly unlikely.

1358
01:24:58,374 --> 01:24:59,992
But one of the worst places

1359
01:25:00,059 --> 01:25:01,560
that a player could drive the ball

1360
01:25:01,628 --> 01:25:03,229
would be long and to the left

1361
01:25:03,296 --> 01:25:04,346
in that area there,

1362
01:25:04,414 --> 01:25:07,833
because an up and down
would be almost impossible.

1363
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,085
And his pitch shot

1364
01:25:10,152 --> 01:25:12,721
would most likely run off
the front of the green.

1365
01:25:12,789 --> 01:25:15,106
And there you have it, folks.

1366
01:25:15,175 --> 01:25:17,943
This hole provides the perfect stage

1367
01:25:18,011 --> 01:25:19,778
for the drama that's about to unfold.

1368
01:25:24,968 --> 01:25:26,902
Well, no surprise here, folks,

1369
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:28,737
that TKO has taken driver out.

1370
01:25:28,805 --> 01:25:30,072
Obviously trying to make an eagle

1371
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:31,540
and win this thing outright.

1372
01:25:31,607 --> 01:25:34,109
But in doing so, he brings
double bogey into play.

1373
01:25:34,177 --> 01:25:37,229
Tko lives for moments like this.

1374
01:25:37,297 --> 01:25:40,449
And TKO is one of
perhaps just 10 players

1375
01:25:40,516 --> 01:25:42,150
who can drive this green.

1376
01:25:42,218 --> 01:25:45,437
We saw him do it just
moments ago in regulation.

1377
01:25:52,179 --> 01:25:54,096
Oh, it sounds like he crushed that one.

1378
01:25:54,164 --> 01:25:55,380
Yeah, it's a good looking swing.

1379
01:25:55,448 --> 01:25:56,131
Always in balance.

1380
01:25:56,199 --> 01:25:58,150
It took off on the right line.

1381
01:25:58,217 --> 01:26:00,619
But there's more wind now
than there was earlier.

1382
01:26:00,686 --> 01:26:01,686
He's getting more help,

1383
01:26:01,754 --> 01:26:03,855
and with his high ball flight,

1384
01:26:03,923 --> 01:26:05,840
carrying that creek
should not be a problem,

1385
01:26:05,908 --> 01:26:10,662
but holding this green will be.

1386
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:11,946
Oh, look at this.

1387
01:26:12,014 --> 01:26:14,065
This could be serious trouble.

1388
01:26:14,133 --> 01:26:17,352
That's the danger zone
Brandel was just describing.

1389
01:26:24,511 --> 01:26:27,446
Luke Chisolm going with
the conservative play,

1390
01:26:27,514 --> 01:26:28,413
iron off the tee.

1391
01:26:28,481 --> 01:26:30,081
No surprise there, Kelly.

1392
01:26:30,149 --> 01:26:32,133
He's stuck to that game plan all week,

1393
01:26:32,201 --> 01:26:33,702
and with only one exception

1394
01:26:33,769 --> 01:26:35,004
has he strayed from the fairway.

1395
01:26:35,071 --> 01:26:36,238
He's looking to put this ball

1396
01:26:36,306 --> 01:26:38,407
in a spot where he
gets the right number,

1397
01:26:38,475 --> 01:26:39,842
gets a wedge in his hand,

1398
01:26:39,909 --> 01:26:43,078
and he can put the pressure on TKO.

1399
01:27:10,022 --> 01:27:11,539
Luke seems relaxed.

1400
01:27:11,607 --> 01:27:13,708
Is this the same player
from two weeks ago?

1401
01:27:13,776 --> 01:27:14,960
No, it's not the same player.

1402
01:27:15,028 --> 01:27:16,161
He may have the same swing,

1403
01:27:16,229 --> 01:27:18,497
but a completely different outlook.

1404
01:27:18,564 --> 01:27:20,165
What do we got?

1405
01:27:20,233 --> 01:27:21,800
75 yards?

1406
01:27:21,868 --> 01:27:23,468
Just like in regulation.

1407
01:27:23,536 --> 01:27:24,469
Yeah.

1408
01:27:24,537 --> 01:27:26,138
Lob wedge.

1409
01:27:26,205 --> 01:27:27,423
Thank you.

1410
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:28,774
This is the same shot

1411
01:27:28,842 --> 01:27:30,526
he had just a few moments ago,

1412
01:27:30,593 --> 01:27:33,095
however, the situation
is entirely different.

1413
01:27:33,162 --> 01:27:35,630
He knows that given TKO's lie,

1414
01:27:35,698 --> 01:27:36,932
he could win this tournament.

1415
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,333
Whereas a few moments ago,

1416
01:27:38,401 --> 01:27:40,802
he was chasing.

1417
01:27:45,575 --> 01:27:48,326
See it.

1418
01:27:48,394 --> 01:27:50,712
Feel it.

1419
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:52,380
And trust.

1420
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:06,077
Not quite like his
holeout in regulation,

1421
01:28:06,145 --> 01:28:08,163
but under the circumstances,
a very solid shot.

1422
01:28:08,231 --> 01:28:09,982
If TKO was looking for a gift

1423
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:11,767
from an inexperienced Luke,

1424
01:28:11,834 --> 01:28:13,068
he didn't get it.

1425
01:28:13,136 --> 01:28:16,071
Tko has a nearly impossible pitch.

1426
01:28:16,139 --> 01:28:17,405
He's looking at a tight flag,

1427
01:28:17,473 --> 01:28:19,108
the green is running away from him,

1428
01:28:19,175 --> 01:28:21,076
not to mention the water.

1429
01:28:21,144 --> 01:28:22,778
Anything short of hitting that flagstick

1430
01:28:22,846 --> 01:28:24,062
and he's probably going swimming.

1431
01:28:24,129 --> 01:28:25,314
Plain and simple here, Kelly.

1432
01:28:25,381 --> 01:28:26,648
He needs to play away from the hole.

1433
01:28:26,715 --> 01:28:28,066
It's a pretty safe bet

1434
01:28:28,133 --> 01:28:29,968
that's going to have
a longer birdie putt

1435
01:28:30,035 --> 01:28:31,787
than Luke's 8 footer.

1436
01:28:31,855 --> 01:28:34,022
The ultimate test for TKO,

1437
01:28:34,089 --> 01:28:35,207
but I wouldn't put it past him.

1438
01:28:35,274 --> 01:28:36,491
He's done it before.

1439
01:28:36,559 --> 01:28:38,443
Look at him sizing this up.

1440
01:28:38,511 --> 01:28:40,162
It almost looks like-

1441
01:28:40,229 --> 01:28:41,096
and he is, I think,

1442
01:28:41,164 --> 01:28:42,430
gonna go right at this hole.

1443
01:28:42,498 --> 01:28:44,183
This absolutely makes no sense to me.

1444
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:45,951
If he doesn't hole this,

1445
01:28:46,019 --> 01:28:47,202
it's very likely that this ball's

1446
01:28:47,237 --> 01:28:48,320
gonna run off of the green.

1447
01:28:48,387 --> 01:28:49,955
This would really be something.

1448
01:28:50,023 --> 01:28:52,807
And he's got to aim
right for the flagstick.

1449
01:28:52,875 --> 01:28:54,742
Anything short of perfect here,

1450
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:56,678
he's looking at bogie at best.

1451
01:28:56,746 --> 01:28:58,297
That's if he's lucky
enough to avoid the water.

1452
01:28:58,364 --> 01:29:00,849
The only way to pull this shot off

1453
01:29:00,917 --> 01:29:02,584
on that line is with a lot of speed

1454
01:29:02,652 --> 01:29:03,452
a lot of spin,

1455
01:29:03,519 --> 01:29:05,119
and he has to land it in an area

1456
01:29:05,187 --> 01:29:07,539
about as big as a dinner plate.

1457
01:29:18,767 --> 01:29:20,652
And it looks good.

1458
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:25,507
It's got a chance.

1459
01:29:26,842 --> 01:29:28,860
Remarkable!

1460
01:29:28,928 --> 01:29:30,045
He's unlucky, Kelly,

1461
01:29:30,113 --> 01:29:31,046
that that ball didn't go in,

1462
01:29:31,114 --> 01:29:32,831
but lucky that it stayed on the green

1463
01:29:32,898 --> 01:29:35,851
and gave him about a
15-foot putt up the hill,

1464
01:29:35,918 --> 01:29:37,852
and maybe he can put
the pressure on Luke.

1465
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:40,822
And look at him. He's not even phased.

1466
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:43,908
This is a makeable putt for TKO.

1467
01:29:43,976 --> 01:29:45,727
Is this where experience pays off?

1468
01:29:45,794 --> 01:29:47,095
Generally speaking, first in

1469
01:29:47,163 --> 01:29:48,429
in a playoff wins.

1470
01:29:48,497 --> 01:29:50,498
And if he makes this, I promise you,

1471
01:29:50,566 --> 01:29:53,202
that hole will look
a lot smaller to Luke.

1472
01:29:56,772 --> 01:30:01,176
How many times has TKO
been in this exact spot

1473
01:30:01,244 --> 01:30:02,844
and emerged victorious?

1474
01:30:02,912 --> 01:30:04,346
It's that mental edge

1475
01:30:04,413 --> 01:30:08,350
that makes him the
great player that he is.

1476
01:30:18,144 --> 01:30:19,594
He thought he had that one.

1477
01:30:19,662 --> 01:30:20,361
Tko's tee shot

1478
01:30:20,396 --> 01:30:22,113
left him with a lot of stress.

1479
01:30:22,181 --> 01:30:24,483
His second shot left
him with a lot of work.

1480
01:30:24,551 --> 01:30:26,985
And now it's Luke who
has the work to do.

1481
01:30:27,053 --> 01:30:28,837
And TKO no longer has control

1482
01:30:28,988 --> 01:30:30,038
of his own fate.

1483
01:30:30,106 --> 01:30:32,758
That control lies with Luke Chisolm.

1484
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:36,278
It was a great par

1485
01:30:36,345 --> 01:30:39,081
for TKO just to stay in it.

1486
01:30:39,148 --> 01:30:40,581
But now the door is open

1487
01:30:40,649 --> 01:30:43,585
for Luke Chisolm to win the Texas open.

1488
01:30:43,653 --> 01:30:45,854
One can only imagine what's going on

1489
01:30:46,005 --> 01:30:47,506
in the mind of Luke Chisolm right now.

1490
01:30:47,574 --> 01:30:50,008
Two weeks ago his career was over,

1491
01:30:50,076 --> 01:30:52,010
and now he is one putt away

1492
01:30:52,078 --> 01:30:53,512
from taking the Texas open

1493
01:30:53,579 --> 01:30:55,430
and beating the best player in golf

1494
01:30:55,498 --> 01:30:57,448
in the process.

1495
01:31:27,597 --> 01:31:30,899
Luke knew this putt was meaningless

1496
01:31:30,967 --> 01:31:32,167
in the big picture.

1497
01:31:32,234 --> 01:31:37,372
He was now answering
to a higher calling.

1498
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:40,858
It was time to go to a
place beyond tradition,

1499
01:31:40,926 --> 01:31:43,178
to a place of buried lies

1500
01:31:43,246 --> 01:31:47,366
and unearthed truths.

1501
01:31:47,483 --> 01:31:51,036
A revolution had begun
within Luke's soul.

1502
01:31:51,103 --> 01:31:54,039
He had a purpose and a calling

1503
01:31:54,106 --> 01:31:56,174
that went beyond any scoreboard.

1504
01:32:55,984 --> 01:32:59,287
He saw, felt, trusted,

1505
01:32:59,355 --> 01:33:02,641
and stroked the putt of his life.

1506
01:33:12,801 --> 01:33:17,772
Utopia is defined as a
place of mythical perfection,

1507
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,108
but I knew differently.

1508
01:33:20,176 --> 01:33:23,045
Utopia is indeed real.

1509
01:33:23,112 --> 01:33:27,182
It's a place where the
voice of truth resides

1510
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:31,453
and eternal trophies line the shelves.

1511
01:33:31,521 --> 01:33:36,324
A place where there are no accidents.

1512
01:33:36,392 --> 01:33:38,126
I guess you're asking yourselves

1513
01:33:38,194 --> 01:33:40,962
whether or not he made the putt.

1514
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:43,898
The better question is,

1515
01:33:43,966 --> 01:33:47,235
does it really matter?

1516
01:33:47,303 --> 01:33:51,306
How can a game have such an effect

1517
01:33:51,374 --> 01:33:53,375
on a man's soul?
