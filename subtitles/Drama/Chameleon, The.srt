00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,950
I'll be doing it.

3
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,118
What y'all digging around for?

4
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:25,000
A dead body.

5
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,400
Well, it's bad for business.

6
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,300
A cold beer?

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,900
No, thanks. I'm not thirsty.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,200
Oh, who says you gotta be thirsty 
to drink a cold beer ...

00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,995
My name is Nicholas Mark Randall.

12
00:03:17,045 --> 00:03:18,900
I'm sixteen years old.

13
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,200
My mother's name is ... Kimberly Miller.

14
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,400
My sister's name is Kathy Jansen.

15
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
I was kidnapped.

16
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,900
Kimberly Miller?

17
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,100
Yeah.

18
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,775
I was raped ... tortured.  

19
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:45,500
I was scared, all the time.

20
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,700
I just want to go home.

21
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,300
Mom ...

22
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,100
What are you doing here?

23
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,700
Is there anyone in here?

24
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,500
They say they found Nicky.

25
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Your sister is here.

26
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,600
Oh, Nicky ...

27
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:10,429
Nicky.

28
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,400
Hi, guys.   Hey, babe. 
Hey, Nick.

29
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,900
How are you, man?

30
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,232
So, Brian and me thought it would be

31
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:25,900
 better if you stayed with us for now.

32
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,200
Right, Brian?
Yeah.

33
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,500
We got a room all set up for you.

34
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,010
It's just, um, Mom ain't ready to have

35
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,400
you at her place ... yet.

36
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,600
You know, she needs time to get 
used to this.

37
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,210
You'll be just fine with us, Nicky.

38
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,000
You'll see.

39
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:51,297
Yo.

40
00:09:00,077 --> 00:09:01,877
Welcome home, Nicky. 

41
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,719
Welcome home.

42
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,300
So, when you're use the shower

43
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:14,937
Watch out.

44
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,100
Hot and cold are the wrong way around.

45
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
It's the faucets.  Brian's been talking
 about fixing it for years.

46
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
What are you babbling about, Kathy?

47
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,200
You're acting like Nicky never had
had a sleepover here, before.

48
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,700
Yeah, of course.

49
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,249
I know, I'm just so happy ...

50
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:34,600
I don't know what I'm saying, sorry.

51
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,800
I love you, Mom.

52
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,200
Let's go.

53
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,700
We, a, we went fishing.

54
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,900
Babe, this is so good.

55
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,400
What's up, man? Don't you like
your sister's cooking, anymore?

56
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,300
Fried chicken's your favorite.

57
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,800
Brian, let him be, okay. He's not
a child anymore, his tastes have changed.

58
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,500
Well, I'll eat it tomorrow.

59
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,900
Did, ... did I come here often?

60
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
You, ... you don't remember?

61
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,000
Things come and go.

62
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,700
Sometimes, I have flashes of memory

63
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,400
and other times, ...  it's like big
chunks of my life are missing.

64
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,300
But, the doctors say it's only natural
after what I went through.

65
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,902
They'll come back, 

66
00:10:42,952 --> 00:10:44,100
bit by bit.

67
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Hey, wait a second.

68
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Album time.

69
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:52,458
She does this a lot.

70
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,300
Let's see what I got here.

71
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,200
Okay, so ...

72
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,500
Here's you in the yard, 
it was your birthday ... 10 years old.

73
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,543
Isn't he cute?

74
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:10,200
Yeah.

75
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,600
And, ...God ... this is that, um,   
that trip we took to Disneyland.

76
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,900
You remember that?

77
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,200
Vaguely.

78
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,400
Here's Mom and Brendan.

79
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,500
You haven't forgotten about Brendan,
have you?

80
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,200
Brendan is his brother.

81
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,300
I'm sure he's gonna come see you soon.

82
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,600
No big rush. Right, Nick?

83
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,700
Who's Nicholas Mark Randall?

84
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,000
A sixteen year old.

85
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,600
Found after he went missing four years ago.

86
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,100
Kidnapping. When he first disappeared,
the BRPD headed the look for him.

87
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,800
He turns up, just like that.
After, four years?

88
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,769
Alive and well? 

89
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:15,100
It's a miracle.

90
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,600
You mean, you still believe in miracles.

91
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,300
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

92
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,900
Hey, just like old times, huh?

93
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,275
Here, ... 

94
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:36,500
Take some corn to Mom.

95
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,100
She'll like that.

96
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,300
Go on, off you go.

97
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,200
Here.

98
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,200
I'm sorry.

99
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,300
Go on, go get me another.

100
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,500
Not too cold, huh?

101
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,700
All right.

102
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
Clumsy as ever.

103
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,400
I'll get it.

104
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,600
Do you have another beer for Mom?

105
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,700
Yeah, in the cooler. Help yourself.

106
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,100
Not too cold. That, I remember.

107
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,305
She is just so happy to see us
all here together.

108
00:13:39,355 --> 00:13:41,300
And, ... she can barely believe it.

109
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,400
Yeah, me neither.

110
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,800
Look, ... she needs time.

111
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,100
More than we do.

112
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,300
Yeah, ... right.

113
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,000
That was Brendan. He's almost here.

114
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,500
Shit.

115
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,000
Why don't you open it for me?

116
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't want him to see what Nicky,
okay?

117
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,900
I'll take care of it. Trust me.

118
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,372
Yeah, but ... it's not that I don't  

119
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:12,500
trust you, I just don't ...

120
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,300
I'll bring him inside, okay?

121
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,900
No, I should go, okay?

122
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,650
Okay.

123
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,511
This is your fault.

124
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:32,600
 This is your fucking fault.
Get him the fuck out of here.

125
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,100
Don't you fucking give me orders. 
This is my home, I do what I want.

126
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,400
I don't give a shit what you think. 
I'm not scared of you.

127
00:14:40,074 --> 00:14:42,574
Is this the heroine in you? 
Some kind of fucking saint?

128
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,300
Is that what you're trying to be?

129
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,400
Get the fuck out of my home.

130
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,700
Fuck you.

131
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,700
And don't you dare let Nicky see you.

132
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,700
Dumb bitch.

133
00:15:18,354 --> 00:15:19,554
[Mom's voice coming from digital camera]

134
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,600
Brendan, stop that.

135
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,200
Just leave him alone.

136
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,400
Leave him alone.

137
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,736
Cut it out now.

138
00:15:30,786 --> 00:15:32,200
Goddamn it.

139
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:33,816
You're a strung up shit.

140
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,900
Brendan, quit that.
Just leave it alone.

141
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,200
Baton Rouge teen, Nicholas Randall, 
reported missing four years ago ...

142
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,900
has been found in the French Alps.

143
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,900
He has told authorities that he was
abducted by kidnappers ...

144
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,700
and taken to Europe, where he was 
tortured and abused.

145
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,400
French authorities are working 
with federal agencies ...

146
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,300
to bring the captors to justice.

147
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,500
They even tried to change my
physical appearance.

148
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
They tried to make me
into someone else.

149
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,700
The French accent,
where does that come from?

150
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,206
Claims the kidnappers made
him speak French.

151
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,900
Want to see the rest of it?

152
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,200
No.

153
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,400
He, he looks totally at ease
in front of the camera.

154
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,300
It seems like he enjoys telling his story.

155
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,000
Has he seen a social service psychologist?

156
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,400
Family is refusing.

157
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,000
No one in the family questions 
his identity?

158
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,800
Nope.  Not a one of them.

159
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,100
Otherwise, we'd already 
done a DNA test.

160
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,100
Come on, Mitch, there's something
fishy about this whole business.

161
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,200
Okay.   Go for it, but go easy.

162
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,900
Family's in shock.

YES

165
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,900
Hi.

166
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,700
Mom wanted me to give all your  
stuff away, or burn it.

167
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,300
She couldn't bring herself to do it.

168
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,100
She didn't think you were
coming back, you know?

169
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,000
It hurt her too much.

170
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,603
But, I ...

171
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:20,300
I kept this stuff, anyway.

172
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,800
Good thing I did, huh?

173
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,700
Thanks.

174
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,200
Okay, um, ... I'll just ...

175
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,836
He was a problem kid. 

176
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,200
Violent, difficult ...

177
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,900
Arrested three or four times 
at age twelve ...

178
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,216
Minor offenses, ... usual stuff. 

179
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,300
He was headed for trouble, I guess.

180
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
He lived with his mother, right?

181
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,300
Yes, and his half brother Brendan, ... 
junkie.

182
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Twelve years old and had been in and
out of rehab over the years.

183
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,900
What about Nicholas' father?

184
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,000
Vanished when the kid was born.

185
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,700
Nicholas was due to be in a home for 
troubled children.

186
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
I guess he wasn't keen on that idea.

187
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,301
He wouldn't hear of it. 

188
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:41,500
The day he vanished ...

189
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,700
he was due to be in front
of the juvenile judge.

190
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,198
Left home on time, but didn't arrive

191
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:48,200
 at the courthouse or at school.

192
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:50,336
 According to the report, 
the family claims

193
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:51,996
that was the last time they
heard from Nicholas.

194
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,400
Which is why everyone thought
he had run away.

195
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,500
Makes sense.

196
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,000
But, kidnapped?

197
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,300
Poor kid.

198
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,200
Oh, we'll see.

199
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,803
Kid's been found. 

200
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,800
His sister formally identified him.

201
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,204
After 48 hours, the probability

202
00:19:11,254 --> 00:19:13,300
of finding a kidnapped kid alive ...

203
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,600
is close to zero.

204
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,326
As for four years later, 

205
00:19:17,376 --> 00:19:18,600
you do the math.

206
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:28,509
Miss Jansen.

207
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,100
Jennifer Johnson, FBI.

208
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,300
Your brother claimed on TV he
was kidnapped by a French sect.

209
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,500
So, if it had been aliens,
 what difference would it make?

210
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,600
We just want Nicholas to tell us what 
he told the reporters.

211
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,100
Look, if people keep making him talk
 about those terrible things ...

212
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,300
how can he ever get over it?

213
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,200
He's just a kid.

214
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,500
Ever since he got back,

215
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:54,456
people have been out here every day,

216
00:19:54,724 --> 00:19:56,224
stirring up this shit.

217
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,300
Hi, Mom.

218
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
What the hell are you doing here?

219
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,051
Why did you come here like this? 

220
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:42,600
Is there some kind of problem?

221
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,000
No, no, I just wanted to surprise you.

222
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,500
I thought you'd be pleased.

223
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,300
You want to please me.

224
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,900
The boss doesn't like us to have visitors
during working hours.

225
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,200
A surprise, huh?

226
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,400
You never really bothered about  
me much, before.

227
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,185
Just in case you've forgotten, 

228
00:21:15,235 --> 00:21:17,600
it wasn't exactly sunshine
between you and  me.

229
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,400
You made my life hell.

230
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
You sure have changed, though.

231
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,900
Only natural, I suppose.

232
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,223
What are you all staring at? 

233
00:21:39,273 --> 00:21:42,000
You look like you've seen a ghost.

234
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,300
Go on, eat this outside.

235
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,320
Go on back to your sister's house now,

236
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,000
I, I gotta get back to work.

237
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,619
And don't becoming around here
 again without calling me.

238
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:59,300
 I can get fired from my job.

239
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,500
Go on, get.

240
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,500
Brendan Kerrigan?

241
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
Brendan Kerrigan.

242
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah.

243
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,300
Could you turn that off, please?

244
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,700
Jennifer Johnson, FBI.

245
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,300
I'm clean.

246
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,200
I'm in rehab, you can check.

247
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,100
I'm here about your brother Nicholas.

248
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,539
Oh, yeah?   What's he done now,

249
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:35,700
up to the the same old shit?

250
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,600
What "shit"?

251
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,419
You know as well as I do. 

252
00:22:39,469 --> 00:22:42,700
You probably have his file memorized,
right?

253
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,900
Have you, uh, seen Nicholas
since he got back?

254
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,100
Yeah.

255
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,800
Hows that?  

256
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:52,538
You know, four years is a long time.

257
00:22:53,343 --> 00:22:54,543
Is he different?

258
00:22:55,443 --> 00:22:58,300
I'm not playing the cat
and mouse game here.

259
00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:01,104
I do not know what you're looking for,
Frankly, I really don't care.

260
00:23:01,204 --> 00:23:03,600
 Yeah, I saw my brother.

261
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,919
I went to go see him, wanted to see
 what he looked like,

262
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,300
I was curious, you know?

263
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,428
One thing I do know,

264
00:23:10,478 --> 00:23:12,300
is four years ago, Nicky was a
mean low-down piece of shit.

265
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,600
I don't have the impression he's
changed that much, either.

266
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,600
That's it.

267
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,700
I'm not going to pretend 
to love my brother.

268
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,600
Me and him just didn't get along, ever.

269
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,351
Yeah, he's back. 

270
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:30,100
It's great for the ones who 
are happy to see him. 

271
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,478
Nicholas? 

272
00:23:39,528 --> 00:23:42,000
It's Nicholas, right?

273
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,300
I'm, a, investigating your kidnapping.

274
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,600
Why is there an investigation?

275
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,228
Well ... because kidnapping is a crime,

276
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:52,700
 and you're the victim.

277
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,900
It's our job is to find out who did it.

278
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,950
I don't really want to talk 
about this anymore. 

279
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
The doctor said ...

280
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,600
Which doctors?

281
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,000
The ones you've refused to see 
since you got back?

282
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,701
[In a whisper] Don't hurt me.

283
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:06,200
What?

284
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
Nicholas, I just ...

285
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,439
I, I just want ...

286
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:11,600
Don't hurt me!

287
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,800
Don't touch! 
Don't you dare touch him!

288
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,208
Let's get out of here. 

289
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:19,900
Just leave our family be!

290
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,376
This article is unbelieveable. 

291
00:24:25,426 --> 00:24:27,300
His loving sister can't praise you enough.

292
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,242
Harassment of her brother?
Verbal attacks?

293
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:33,500
And, what the kid has to say
is heartbreaking.

294
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,220
I mean, I told you to go easy, Jennifer.

295
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,700
 The kid's a minor ...

296
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
his family's in a state of shock.

297
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,100
Mitch, he's lying.

298
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,600
He's lying about his age, his accent,
his kidnapping.

299
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,700
 That fit in the parking lot was
impressive, but it was all an act.

300
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,833
And, the mother, the brother, 
the sister ...

301
00:24:50,883 --> 00:24:51,700
They're all lying?

302
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,685
Look, Mitch, just ... 

303
00:24:57,735 --> 00:25:01,200
just give me one more week.
Two, at the most.

304
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,243
Okay, fine.   But, I want evidence,

305
00:25:04,293 --> 00:25:07,300
 hard evidence, scientific evidence. 

306
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,500
Hey. You haven't forgotten me, 
have you, Nicky boy?

307
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,900
Come on, get in.

308
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,300
Come on!

309
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,800
Well, Nicky's really grown up, huh?

310
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,900
You're a man now. ...
Right?

311
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,100
A real fucking man.

312
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,400
Are you happy to see me?

313
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,375
Yeah.

314
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:02,800
Well, me too.

315
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,890
I'm very happy, Nicky boy.

316
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:08,100
Very happy, indeed.

317
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,900
Little Nicky.

318
00:26:14,235 --> 00:26:15,435
Huh?

319
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,800
Yeah, you can walk back from here.

320
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,559
Just, don't lose your way, huh.

321
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:24,900
Get run down by a fucking car.

322
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,400
Be a real shame, too.

323
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,200
Right after you've come back from
the dead and everything.

324
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,100
Go on, have a little bit.

325
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,019
No, it's fine.

326
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:39,300
Come on, have a little bit.

327
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,100
Come on.  Come on!
Come on!

328
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,300
There you go.

329
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,906
Hey, little bro. 

330
00:26:53,956 --> 00:26:57,300
No need to tell that bitch Kathy
about our little drive, okay?

331
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:57,679
Okay.

332
00:26:57,729 --> 00:27:00,900
Good old Nicky.  We had a good time,
 didn't we?

333
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,500
I thought I told you not to come here.

334
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,989
Did I run away because of Brendan?

335
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:11,600
Run away?

336
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,600
Weren't you kidnapped?

337
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,800
Isn't that what you told the cops?

338
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,600
TV reporters, everybody you 
talked to?

339
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,900
What happened exactly the day I
went missing?

340
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
You don't remember nothing?

341
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,000
Maybe, that's for the best, huh.

342
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,100
Please tell me, 
I really need to know.

343
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,506
You know what I tell you, kid, 

344
00:28:37,556 --> 00:28:39,900
there's a lot of people who
do just about anything ...

345
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,100
to forget their past
 and start over from scratch.

346
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,955
Might be your lucky break.

347
00:28:49,005 --> 00:28:52,000
You ought to make the most of it.

348
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,792
Mom, wait.

349
00:28:53,842 --> 00:28:55,700
Let go of me!

350
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,300
I was never a very good mother to you.

351
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,600
I guess you forgot that too, huh?

352
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,412
He was always weak. 

353
00:29:37,462 --> 00:29:40,700
Never had any backbone.

354
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,706
You wouldn't know.

355
00:29:43,756 --> 00:29:46,200
You don't have him on your hands
all day long.

356
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,500
What about the money that Brian 
and me borrowed for a plane ticket?

357
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,400
How the hell will we ever ...

358
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,010
You were stupid to borrow that money.

359
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,900
I told you, so.

360
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,596
You know, Brendan's right.

361
00:30:01,646 --> 00:30:04,400
We never should have gone over to get him.

362
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,800
Don't say "we."
You were.

363
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,892
Come on Nicky, we'll be late to school.

364
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm not going.

365
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,555
Come on, cut the bullshit, Nicky. 

366
00:30:22,605 --> 00:30:24,600
You sister's doing this for you ...

367
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:32,669
Hey.

368
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:34,673
Trust your sister. 

369
00:30:34,723 --> 00:30:36,800
And, just try to help me make a 
fresh start, you know?

370
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,450
I don't want to go. 

371
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,000
No one's going to make me do
what I don't want to do.

372
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,500
Nicky ...

373
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,600
So, everything is just like before, huh?

374
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,100
Are you here for a manicure?

375
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,094
I, uh, want to apologize for 
 the other day.

376
00:31:13,144 --> 00:31:15,600
I was out of line. I shouldn't have
insisted like that.

377
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,503
Forget it, spare me your pity. 

378
00:31:18,553 --> 00:31:20,900
So, what do you want done?

379
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,190
So, are you here on your own?

380
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,300
Maybe, he's waiting for mommy.

381
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,900
Mommy gave me permission to 
stay 'til midnight.

382
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,100
Until then, I can do what I want.

383
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,600
Where'd you get the sexy accent?

384
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,800
France.

385
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,089
France? ... You're French? 

386
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,300
What are you doing in this dump?

387
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,600
It's hard to, um, to bond again with 
a family member when they return.

388
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,700
You don't dare talk about what
 happened, not even between yourselves.

389
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,700
So, you start imagining things, 
which is worse.

390
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,800
And, little by little,
you become afraid.

391
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,400
Then you hate yourself for that.
You're ashamed.

392
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,600
Does, um, does Nicholas scare you?

393
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,600
A little.

394
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,700
And, um, before, did he scare you, too?

395
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,500
I mean, Nicky has never been 
easier to deal with.

396
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,000
Before, he was young,
he was just a kid.

397
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,300
He was difficult, of course, but ...

398
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,000
You know, Kathy, it, um, it might help
Nicholas to, um, to see a psychologist.

399
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,336
He ain't sick, okay?

400
00:32:58,386 --> 00:33:00,000
No, no, no, of course not, but ...

401
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,900
He's been through a traumatic experience.

402
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,466
He needs to talk to somebody about it, 

403
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,900
somebody who's not part of the family ...

404
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,900
somebody who can, um, who can listen
to him without judging him.

405
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,308
Get out!

406
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,500
Are you out of your fucking mind?

407
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,742
He's scared too, you know?

408
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:20,000
He's ashamed.

409
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:59,994
[siren starts]

410
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,995
What's gotten into you?

411
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:16,900
I needed a change.

412
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,392
What is that?

413
00:34:39,442 --> 00:34:40,500
What?

414
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,600
Hey, what is she doing here?
You knew about this?

415
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,860
Nicholas, it's okay. 

416
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,900
I'm the one who convinced your sister.

417
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,900
You need to see a doctor. He specializes
 in post traumatic disorders.

418
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,200
Don't worry. 
He's there to help you.

419
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,966
I just want you to get better. 

420
00:34:57,016 --> 00:34:58,900
I just want to help you get better.

421
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,739
Yeah, right. 

422
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:02,700
You just want to get rid of me ...
like everyone else!

423
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
Don't say that, Nicky! 
It's not true!

424
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,400
Can you put the radio on, please?

425
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,700
You're not going ask me what
the guys who kidnapped me did?

426
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,600
That's why I am here, right?

427
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,900
Turn your hands over, please.

428
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,900
You want to tell me about it?

429
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,902
Answering one question with another ... 

430
00:35:57,952 --> 00:35:59,700
You're a real doctor, huh?

431
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,000
Don't move, hold still.

432
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,500
Okay, you can relax.

433
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,300
You can take your vest off.

434
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,128
Have you seen a lot of doctors?

435
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:20,800
When you've see one, you've seen them all.

436
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
You don't trust them?

437
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,607
Noone trusts me.

438
00:36:26,657 --> 00:36:29,600
Why would I trust other people?

439
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,800
Did you do a lot of sport 
when you were younger?

440
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,400
I don't know ... maybe.
Like most people.

441
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,200
You know why I'm asking, don't you?

442
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,000
My brother and I, we used to fight.

443
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,825
Don't you mean he used to beat you? 

444
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:54,100
Him or someone else?

445
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,400
We used to fight, okay?

446
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,300
He was bigger than me,
but he didn't scare me.

447
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,729
Because, one time, I whipped his ass.

448
00:37:04,779 --> 00:37:06,100
For real.

449
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,944
When I was done with him, 
he wasn't moving.

450
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:11,200
[chuckling] I thought he was dead.

451
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,500
Well, that was real interesting,
huh, doc?

452
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,400
May I see you?   Alone.

453
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:27,100
Kathy?  Uh,Jennifer Johnson speaking. 
Listen, um, ...

454
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,364
I know this is going to be hard to hear,

455
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,100
 but, uh, ...

456
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,900
the doctor doesn't think
this boy's your brother.

457
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,948
I'm, I'm real sorry.

458
00:37:35,998 --> 00:37:38,500
 Can you hear me?

459
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,500
Kathy ... Kathy, calm down.

460
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,600
From now on, this case is in the
 hands of the FBI, okay?

461
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,900
I'm going to need you to sign
an affidavit, so I can press charges.

462
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,357
So, what did the doctor tell you?

463
00:37:58,407 --> 00:37:59,900
What do you think?

464
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,442
I'm not Nicholas Mark Randall? 

465
00:38:02,492 --> 00:38:05,000
Otherwise, you wouldn't look so happy.

466
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,100
I'm not happy.

467
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,393
It's what you wanted to hear, right?

468
00:38:10,443 --> 00:38:12,500
No, I wanted to hear the truth.

469
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,500
[scoffs] The truth ...

470
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,400
Kathy, I've got the documents
for you to sign.

471
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,100
Hey, are you okay?
It's best that he stays in the car.

472
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,225
Open the door, please.

473
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:46,300
Get away from the car.

474
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,110
Hey, come on.

475
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,700
I got it.

476
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,416
He's my brother, okay?

477
00:38:49,466 --> 00:38:52,200
I identified him, my mother did, too.

478
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,600
I mean, Nicky's a minor and you can't
  do anything without my consent.

479
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,600
Not a damn thing.

480
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,675
Open the door ... Now.

481
00:39:01,725 --> 00:39:05,100
Let him out of the car, all right?

482
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,675
Get out of the car.

483
00:39:08,725 --> 00:39:10,900
Get out of the car!

484
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,100
Don't ever come here, again.

485
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,921
Did they tell you why I, um, left the 

486
00:39:42,971 --> 00:39:45,200
department for missing children
in New York?

487
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,000
No, they didn't.

488
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,700
Alec, a ten year old boy,
goes missing.

489
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,700
His parents think he's run away.

490
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:02,100
After 48 hours, still no sign of Alec.

491
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,700
His parents are devastated.

492
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,200
Luckily, they have the support
 of their neighbor, Alec' godfather.

493
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,983
I went to his place several times,

494
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:15,800
 for, for the case.

495
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,500
Then we went other places, together ...

496
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,000
not only for the case.

497
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,700
One night, he, um, he invited me
over for dinner.

498
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,000
We drank, ...
laughed a lot ...

499
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,959
and over dessert, he slipped up.

500
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:43,200
Lied.

501
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,200
Useless, unimportant, 
dumb little lie. 

502
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,000
I stood up, stammered I was tired ...

503
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:59,200
I smiled, he didn't insist and left.

504
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,500
The next day, I came back with
a search warrant.

505
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,300
All I had to go on was this
one little lie.

506
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,500
We had to break down the door.

507
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,800
I had the house searched.

508
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,800
We found Alec in the basement ...

509
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,000
dead.

510
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,700
During dinner the night before,
he had been in the room below us ...

511
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,600
alive.

512
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,000
Maybe, he could heard us talking, 
laughing, joking ...

513
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,886
That guy pretending to be 

514
00:41:52,936 --> 00:41:55,700
Nicholas Randall is not a boy, 
he's a man. 

515
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,500
A liar.

516
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,800
Perverse, dangerous ...

517
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,300
Just like that other guy.

518
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,700
Pancakes and jelly ...
just like when you were a kid.

519
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,300
I'm not hungry.

520
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,100
Come on, it's your favorite.

521
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,800
Why did you do that?

522
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,000
I'm not Nicky.

523
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,600
What are you talking about?

524
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,028
I made it all up. 

525
00:42:59,078 --> 00:43:01,900
The kidnapping, the torture ...

526
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,800
I'm a liar, passing myself off as Nicky.

527
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,005
Stop it, stop it Nicky, don't ...

528
00:43:09,055 --> 00:43:11,500
 don't say that, it's not true.

529
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,800
Then, why did you let that FBI
woman arrest me, huh?

530
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,000
Why did you let them drag me 
to see that doctor?

531
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,829
Noone believes me!   You, Mom, Brian.

532
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:23,900
 Noone believes I'm Nicky!

533
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,161
Stop it ... 

534
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:27,200
I'm so sorry.

535
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,800
She kept insisting ...

536
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,200
You're, you're my little brother, 
right? I know.

537
00:43:37,543 --> 00:43:38,743
I know it.

538
00:43:39,644 --> 00:43:42,079
How do you know that, huh? 

539
00:43:42,129 --> 00:43:44,200
How can you be so sure?

540
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,900
I can't handle this ... I can't.

541
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,300
You stop messing with my wife! 
Okay, Nicky ...

542
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,094
Nicky not?

543
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,700
I don't know, anymore.

544
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,912
I mean, Kathy's a mess. 

545
00:44:08,962 --> 00:44:10,500
You see what you're doing to her?

546
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,790
In any case, everyone around here 

547
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,900
says that the real Nicky's dead.

548
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,328
So, if Kathy is your sister, 

549
00:44:17,378 --> 00:44:19,300
which I highly doubt ...

550
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,800
you better stop messing
 with her, okay?

551
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,657
Jennifer, it's Nicholas.

552
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:34,500
I have to talk to you.

553
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,141
At Fred's, on the river near,
it's next to the bridge.

554
00:44:39,191 --> 00:44:41,900
I'll wait for you there.

555
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,220
[shouts]

556
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,500
Nicholas.

557
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,800
I can't believe this.
 Are you tailing me or what?

558
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,518
You wanted to talk to me.

559
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,200
What's up?

560
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,896
I have nothing to say.

561
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,100
Nothing, at all.

562
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,193
Right, cut the crap, okay.

563
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:45,200
You, a, you called me in here.

564
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,800
Let's go outside,
it's too noisy in here.

565
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,836
Me, calling you? 

566
00:45:49,886 --> 00:45:52,400
In your dreams, maybe.

567
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,984
You should go see a shrink or something.

568
00:45:56,034 --> 00:45:57,900
Get off my back, will you?

569
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,500
You think you're a hot shot?

570
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,400
A manipulator, ... fabulous liar.

571
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,300
You're just some poor lost kid.

572
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,100
Right now, you're scared shitless.

573
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,887
Guess what, pal? 

574
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:17,000
I'm tired ... of playing games with you.

575
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,000
Hello.

576
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,417
Hello. 

577
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,400
Who is this?

578
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,600
Nicky?

579
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,900
Nicky, is that you?

580
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,500
My name is Nicholas Mark Randall.
I am sixteen years old.

581
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,300
My mother's name is Kimberly Miller.

582
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,300
My sister's name is Kathy Jansen.

583
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,400
My name is Nicholas Mark Randall. 
I am sixteen years old.

584
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,900
My mother's name is Kimberly Miller.

585
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,400
My sister's name is Kathy Jansen.

586
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,031
I was kidnapped.

587
00:48:18,081 --> 00:48:19,500
Your sister is here.

588
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,300
I was raped ...

589
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,400
Tortured ...

590
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,000
I was scared all the time.

591
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,500
I just want to go home.

592
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,100
Hello, this is Kimberly, I'm not here...

593
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,900
Are you okay?

594
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,975
Did Kathy send you?

595
00:49:37,025 --> 00:49:37,600
No.

596
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,415
You've got guts.

597
00:49:47,465 --> 00:49:49,400
A lot of guts.

598
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,200
You have the will power.

599
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,500
You're very smart, too.

600
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,991
With all of that,

601
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:03,500
 you could do something else 
with your life.

602
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,500
My life ...

603
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,003
Yeah, your life, your own life.

604
00:50:10,053 --> 00:50:11,700
 Not someone elses.

605
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,852
I know how you feel.

606
00:50:27,902 --> 00:50:30,632
You're alone, ... 

607
00:50:30,682 --> 00:50:32,800
totally alone.

608
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,300
Twenty-four hours a day in
someone else's skin ...

609
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,500
it's got to be unbearable.

610
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,000
I can help you.

611
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,000
You feeling better?

612
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,000
You don't look too bad.

613
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,100
Don't you got nothing to say to me?

614
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,900
You're not pleased to see your old Mom?

615
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,200
I am.

616
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,300
You'll be staying with me now.

617
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,700
Humph, did you find the beer there?

618
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,100
Well, grab yourself one.

619
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,378
Why you standing there
like some damn fool?

620
00:51:59,428 --> 00:52:01,100
 Come on, sit down next me.

621
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,800
I ain't gonna bite you.

622
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,500
Cheers.

623
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,000
Welcome to hell.

624
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,800
You sure screwed up with
that knife, huh?

625
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,900
Clumsy as ever.

626
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,505
I ain't working tonight,

627
00:52:46,555 --> 00:52:48,500
so I thought maybe we'd a ...

628
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,400
 Get something to eat, go to a movie,maybe. 
How does that sound?

629
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,000
Sounds good.

630
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,400
Sounds really good.

631
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,918
You gonna be sleeping here ...

632
00:53:06,968 --> 00:53:08,600
like before.

633
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,800
I rented out Brendan's room.

634
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,400
I do not think he'll
be coming back.

635
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,401
You understand, huh?

636
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:30,100
Yeah, ... I understand.

637
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,000
You understand everything, don't you?

638
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,480
[knocking at door]

639
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,200
Maybe, I'll go and fix 
your dressing now, ...

640
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,800
that nurse gave me everything I need.

641
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,923
It's in my room.

642
00:53:56,973 --> 00:53:58,400
I'll go get it.

643
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,700
Don't move, I'll be right back.

644
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,500
You got a problem with this?

645
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,500
You going to call the cops on me?

646
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,600
I'm all you got, boy.

647
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,000
I started after you left.

648
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,000
I didn't leave.

649
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,200
I was kidnapped.

650
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,667
First you,

651
00:55:15,717 --> 00:55:18,400
then Brendan ...

652
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,700
You know what that means?

653
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,500
I'm all alone.

654
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,300
Why did Brendan leave?

655
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,281
For that ... 

656
00:55:41,332 --> 00:55:44,500
fucking bastard...

657
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,675
Rise and shine, sleepy head.

658
00:56:39,725 --> 00:56:40,600
It's Sunday.

659
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:42,940
Come on.

660
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:46,600
That'll put a little meat on your bones.

661
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,100
Where are we going?

662
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:18,900
Let's go.

663
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,900
Why are you crying?

664
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,400
Why did we came here?
You can tell me.

665
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,500
You drive, I'm tired.

666
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,081
I don't have my license.

667
00:59:33,131 --> 00:59:34,300
Just drive.

668
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,699
Brendan.

669
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:50,800
Brendan should go to hell ...

670
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:55,700
and God will never forgive me.

671
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,125
Get away from me!

672
01:00:08,175 --> 01:00:10,200
Get away from me.

673
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:14,600
You made me life like hell since
 the day you were born.

674
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:23,900
Stay away ... you fucking dealer.

675
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,000
You can go to hell with that too.

676
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:35,200
But she never should have
turned you over to the cops, Nicky.

677
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:42,194
You don't rat on family. Family.

678
01:00:42,244 --> 01:00:45,600
It's no good. No good.

679
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,789
The night you called,

680
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:51,500
 I was so drunk.

681
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:58,300
I didn't mean for that to happen.

682
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:04,900
I swear ... I swear, I didn't
mean for it to happen.

683
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,700
You can't die twice, kid.

684
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,500
You can't die twice.

685
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,716
Hi, Nicky boy.

686
01:01:59,766 --> 01:02:01,800
Let's go for a ride.

687
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,388
I don't really feel like it.

688
01:02:04,438 --> 01:02:05,400
Well, I do.

689
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,400
Come on. Watch your toes.

690
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,493
Just think ... 

691
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:30,000
before you got back ...

692
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,501
you know, there were jerks out there who

693
01:02:32,552 --> 01:02:34,600
thought that I had actually killed you.

694
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,845
That's incredible, huh? 

695
01:02:37,895 --> 01:02:41,400
All because we were at each others
 throats, now and again.

696
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,800
Is that what your girlfriend
at the FBI thinks?

697
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,600
She's not my girlfriend.

698
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:56,000
Anyways ... she can't suspect
 you of killing me.

699
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,000
I'm alive.

700
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,900
Hey, ain't that right, baby bro?

701
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,900
Ain't that right?

702
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,560
Come on, let's take a little drive, 

703
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:07,500
just the two of us.

704
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,600
Where?

705
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,100
That depends.

706
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,606
Depends on what?

707
01:03:12,656 --> 01:03:15,400
It depends on you, it depends on me.

708
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,879
And, your FBI girlfriend, too. Come on.

709
01:03:18,929 --> 01:03:19,500
Why her?

710
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,900
Come on, let's drive to the bayou, huh.

711
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,221
Why would you want to go to the bayou?

712
01:03:24,271 --> 01:03:25,700
 There's nothing out there.

713
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,200
You know, when you were gone ...

714
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,900
when the little green man came 
and took you away.

715
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,500
Mom used to go down to the bayou a lot.

716
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,500
All alone, ... you know why?

717
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,200
To talk to you, man.

718
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,900
She went down there to talk to you.

719
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:49,450
Yeah.

720
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,900
Have you guys driven own there?

721
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,200
You always were a fucking liar, Nicky.

722
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,200
What, are you scared, huh?

723
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,800
What are you scared of, huh?

724
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,900
Of me?  What the hell am I going
to do to you now?

725
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,400
Come on, let's get baby home to Mommy.

726
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,500
You're not scared of Mommy too, are you?

727
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,815
She's a good Mom, all right?

728
01:04:16,865 --> 01:04:18,600
She's nice and cuddly.

729
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,500
I'm going to keep my
eye on you, Nicky.

730
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,600
You never know what might
happen in this part of town.

731
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,800
Hey, give my love to mom!

732
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,300
It's a Court order, Mrs. Miller.

733
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,600
You have to comply,
like it or not.

734
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:15,700
I won't do it.

735
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,200
I heard you can do the same
test with saliva.

736
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,500
Did you know that?

737
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,000
Going out.

738
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:06,925
Open the fucking door.

739
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:08,600
Open the fucking door!

740
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,500
Open it, you fuck!

741
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,450
Is he in there?

742
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,100
Get out of here, Brendan.

743
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:14,950
Open this Goddamn door, 

744
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,300
Let me see the little prick's face ...

745
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,800
I know about the test! 
The whole fucking town knows!

746
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,591
You listen to me listen to me, 
you fucker,

747
01:06:22,641 --> 01:06:24,600
if that test will comes back
and proves you're a goddamn liar ...

748
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,075
you've destroyed our family

749
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:28,700
for a second time!

750
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,800
You've ruined my Mom's hopes!

751
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,100
Fuck!

752
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,809
I will kill you, do you understand? 

753
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:39,100
I will fucking kill you
with my bare hands!

754
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,300
You got it?

755
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,400
Get out of here!

756
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,645
You are nothing to me.

757
01:06:45,695 --> 01:06:47,200
 You ain't my son.

758
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,938
Oh, come on, Brendan.

759
01:06:49,988 --> 01:06:52,300
Hit me. Just once, do it.

760
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,188
I ain't scared of you, boy. 

761
01:06:58,239 --> 01:06:59,800
And, I never was.

762
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,000
I'll fucking kill him!

763
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,938
His name is Frederic Fortin.

764
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:46,200
 He's French.

765
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:47,800
Twenty-five years old.

766
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,098
As soon as the results came through, 

767
01:08:51,148 --> 01:08:52,800
I sent his fingerprints to Interpol.

768
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:55,700
He is the illegitimate son 
of Giselle Fortin

769
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,567
who was eighteen and poor

770
01:08:57,617 --> 01:08:59,600
 when she gave birth to him.

771
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,600
He was place in the custody of his
grandparents when he was two ...

772
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:05,500
and sent to a junvenile home
when he was twelve.

773
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,200
He has more than 150 
different identities.

774
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,011
I know I've been cruel,

775
01:09:14,061 --> 01:09:15,600
but I'm not a monster.

776
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,400
He invented the first one
when he was a teenager.

777
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:19,979
Calls the cops, says a 

778
01:09:20,029 --> 01:09:21,900
lost kid has been found ...

779
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,693
He's been abused or raped, 

780
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:26,200
the parents are dead or kicked him out.

781
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,675
He's been in and out of a hundred

782
01:09:28,725 --> 01:09:30,900
homes for minors all over Europe.

783
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:34,859
They found no evidence of sexual deviance 

784
01:09:34,909 --> 01:09:36,400
or financial motive.

785
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,100
His profit seems to have been
 purely emotional.

786
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,700
What took you so long?

787
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,900
Why did you come see me?

788
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:56,200
They treating you okay, in there?

789
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:02,900
Yeah, I speak a little bit of Spanish,
 so ...

790
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,600
Has Brendan ever been in prison?

791
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,800
Two times.

792
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,200
Did you visit him?

793
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:30,400
Did you go back to the bayou?

794
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,000
What?

795
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,119
The bayou. 

796
01:11:36,169 --> 01:11:40,200
The place you took me after Mardi Gras.

797
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,400
I go there often.

798
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,200
It does me good.

799
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,700
What do you say to Nicholas?

800
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,600
I ask him for forgiveness.

801
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,200
Thank you.

802
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:20,200
For what?

803
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,400
For coming here.

804
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,300
YES

805
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,750
I heard about your mother.

806
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,800
I'm very sorry.

807
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:00,300
Why?

808
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,936
I know it wasn't easy to ...

809
01:14:02,985 --> 01:14:04,800
You do not know anything, at all.

810
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,600
French police sent me your file.

811
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,028
What now? 

812
01:14:11,078 --> 01:14:13,600
You think you understood everything?

813
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,900
You just have to put me behind bars and 
all of a sudden the case is closed?

814
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:22,200
The others must be laughing
their asses off.

815
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,800
What others?

816
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,100
You really can't see shit, can you?

817
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,500
They always knew I wasn't Nicholas.

818
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,630
Since the beginning they knew.

819
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:42,500
The mother, the sister, 
the brother, everyone knew.

820
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,400
Kimberly knows things about Brendan
that she won't tell.

821
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,900
What things, what are you talking about?

822
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:52,240
Well, you're the cop, right?

823
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:54,300
All right, goodbye, Frederic.

824
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,600
There's a place in the bayou
 where she goes all the time.

825
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,700
To talk to him.

826
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:01,937
And Brendan ...

827
01:15:01,986 --> 01:15:03,500
 well, he does not like it.

828
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,400
He doesn't like it one bit.

829
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,300
Who does she go talk to, Frederic?

830
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,100
Who does she go talk to, Frederic?

831
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,400
Nicholas.

832
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,800
Any news of Brendan?

833
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:34,942
He quit his job, left the clinic. 

834
01:15:35,217 --> 01:15:36,214
Vanished.

835
01:15:36,264 --> 01:15:37,717
Two days ago.

836
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,300
You could give Kimberly a polygraph.

837
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,200
She has the right to refuse.

838
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,100
It wouldn't be in her best interest,
but she's got the right.

839
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,600
Do you accept it.

840
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,900
Is your name Kimberly Miller?

841
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,500
Yes

842
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:57,200
Is your birth date August 8, 1955?

843
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,600
Yes

844
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,200
Do you have any doubts whether Frederic
Fortin was your son?

845
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,100
the first time she saw him?

846
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,800
No.

847
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:12,200
Did you realize Frederic wasn't your son

848
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,100
while you were living with him?

849
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,900
Did you realize Frederic wasn't your son

850
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,500
while you were living with him?

851
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
No.

852
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:28,000
Did you always know this boy
wasn't your son?

853
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,400
No.

854
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:31,600
Do you miss Nicholas?

855
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,700
Yes

856
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,500
Do you know where Nicholas is?

857
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,200
Do you know where Nicholas is?

858
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,100
No.

859
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,200
Do you think you'll ever see
Nicholas alive one day?

860
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,500
Do you think you'll ever see
Nicholas alive one day?

861
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,648
Do you think you'll ever see ...?

862
01:17:00,698 --> 01:17:01,700
Yes.

863
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,400
No.

864
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,800
Do you think you'll ever see
Nicholas alive one day?

865
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,700
No.

866
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:13,400
I know he's dead.

867
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:17,904
It was all Nicky's fault, 

868
01:17:17,954 --> 01:17:20,500
he made everybody's life hell.

869
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:32,341
All right, what are you going do with this? 

870
01:17:32,391 --> 01:17:34,000
You can't use it in court.

871
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:36,500
Frederic, I believe you.

872
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,100
I believe that what you told me is true.

873
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,300
Kimberly is coming.

874
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,900
We're going to put you both in 
the same room ...

875
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:44,700
to see if she'll slip up.

876
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:47,100
If we can prove you were manipulated ...

877
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:50,800
that you were used as an alibi
in this case ...

878
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:55,100
you could go free.

879
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,294
But you have to tell me 
everything you know,

880
01:17:58,344 --> 01:17:59,500
 again ...  Right now.

881
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,100
Okay?

882
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,200
The truth.

883
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,700
It's your only chance.

884
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,600
Come on in.

885
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,800
Have a seat, Mrs. Miller.

886
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,200
When, uh,  Kathy Jansen saw you
for the first time ...

887
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:33,100
Did she hesitate before identifying 
you as her brother Nicholas?

888
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,200
No.

889
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,200
She called me Nicky and then she cried.

890
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,600
Oh, Nicky.

891
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,368
And, with, um, Kimberly Miller,

892
01:18:41,418 --> 01:18:44,500
when you got to Baton Rouge,
 how did that go?

893
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,200
Didn't really look at me ...

894
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:50,900
as if she didn't dare to.

895
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,900
She kind of hugged me and
she didn't say a thing.

896
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,100
When did you first realize that Kimberly
 and the rest of the family ...

897
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,500
knew you weren't Nicholas?

898
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,068
What the hell kind of question ...?

899
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:04,400
Let him speak, Mrs. Miller.

900
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,500
When Kathy told Kimberly ...

901
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,600
that she never should have
come to get me.

902
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,700
I think Kathy was trying 
to rebuild something with me ...

903
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,800
to save her family or something ...

904
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,000
because he felt guilty.

905
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:21,200
Guilty, what for?

906
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,189
Not having protected ...

907
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:27,100
Who?

908
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,700
Nicholas.

909
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:34,900
Do you think Kimberly Miller knows
 what happened to her son?

910
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,058
What about Brendan?

911
01:19:42,108 --> 01:19:43,800
Tell me about Brendan.

912
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,400
He came to see me a few times.

913
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:51,100
To take me for a ride in his car.

914
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,300
Good old Nicky.

915
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:59,500
He played with me like a ...
 like a cat with a mouse.

916
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:02,800
Did Brendan Kerrigan tell you about a 
place where his mother would ...

917
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,700
go talk to Nicholas?

918
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:07,100
No smoking allowed in here, Mrs. Miller.

919
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,900
 Did Kimberly ever mentioned this
 place in your presence?

920
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,800
Did she ever take you there?

921
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,400
Did she ever take you there?

922
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:38,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

923
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,500
Do you have any reason to believe ...

924
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,800
that Brendan Kerrigan killed his brother?

925
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:47,000
That's what you want me to say ...

926
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,900
but it's not true.

927
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,300
Nothing is true.

928
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,700
I made it all up.

929
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,548
I'm afraid of prison, and,

930
01:20:55,598 --> 01:20:57,100
and you promised me that ...

931
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,538
if I would testify against my family,

932
01:20:59,587 --> 01:21:02,500
 I wouldn't go to jail 
if Brendan was charged.

933
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:06,400
The whole family thought I was Nicholas.

934
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,200
They all tried to believe,
and so did I

935
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,100
I'm sorry.

936
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,800
You want to take me home now?

937
01:21:26,676 --> 01:21:27,876
Yeah.

938
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:48,000
I, I just don't understand it.

939
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:51,400
I don't understand why someone 
would do something like that.

940
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,000
It makes me sick.

941
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,400
Makes me feel so sick.

942
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,100
He must be a pretty unhappy kid 
to do what he did.

943
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,700
I don't hold it against him.

944
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:12,600
He sits on his knees when
he watches TV ...

945
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,600
My boy did that.

946
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:26,065
I felt I had found a family that would

947
01:22:26,115 --> 01:22:28,400
accept me and love me.

948
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,100
They were so happy.

949
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,600
They kept telling me how much
they loved me.

950
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,600
Right, Kathy?

951
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,400
You know, I never wanted to hurt anyone.

952
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,600
Far, from it.

953
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,100
Love ... that's all I wanted.

954
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,500
To be loved, to give love ...

955
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,785
I'm guilty of what,

956
01:22:52,835 --> 01:22:54,400
of looking for love?

957
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:57,996
In my ten years as a prosecutor,

958
01:22:58,045 --> 01:23:01,400
rarely have I seen such
a morally repulsive crime.

959
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:04,500
This defendant has no remorse,
whatsoever ...

960
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,800
and now he dares speaks of love?

961
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:09,671
No. In Louisiana we got values,

962
01:23:09,721 --> 01:23:11,500
we have true values.

963
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,038
Frederic Fortin: 

964
01:23:15,087 --> 01:23:18,000
Based on the evidence
presented here today ....

965
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:19,619
The Baton Rouge federal court,

966
01:23:19,668 --> 01:23:22,600
sentences you to a prison term of five 
years and eleven months ...

967
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,500
in the Big Spring penitentiary.

968
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,000
You will also pay a fine of $10,300 ...

969
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:31,200
and serve three years probation 
after your release.

970
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,800
This court is now adjourned.

971
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:10,443
Deceased name: Brendan Kerrigan. 

972
01:24:10,493 --> 01:24:15,500
He deceased last night about 11,
believed to be about 11:10.

973
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,667
The manager called it in about an hour ago. 

974
01:24:18,717 --> 01:24:20,100
Looks like an overdose.

975
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:35,300
I ... I'm sorry.

976
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,700
It had to happen, sooner or later.

977
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,200
Your mother's not here?

978
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,800
She doesn't live around here, anymore.

979
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:53,071
I don't know where she is ... 

980
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:55,000
and I don't want know.

981
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,708
Hello .... Hello?

982
01:25:18,758 --> 01:25:23,200
Your voice hasn't changed, Jenny.

983
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:26,355
They say that if you work on it, 

984
01:25:26,405 --> 01:25:27,900
your voice never ages.

985
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,300
Where are you?

986
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,500
In France.

987
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,400
What do you want?

988
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:41,000
I have a lot of things to tell you.

989
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:42,500
Like what?

990
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:45,600
I know where he is.

991
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,283
Hang up and take a look,

992
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:49,500
I'll call back.

993
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,100
Two photos, Jen.

994
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,155
One phone call and two photos,

995
01:26:19,205 --> 01:26:21,700
sent by this lunatic, that's all you have ...

996
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,400
you're raring to go.

997
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,611
You got a search team for
a couple of days, 

998
01:26:28,661 --> 01:26:29,700
it's the best I can do.

999
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,600
Thanks.

1000
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:33,413
Ma'am?

1001
01:26:33,463 --> 01:26:35,700
Could you come with me, please?

1002
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:45,500
We found something. 
Not sure if it'll interest you.

1003
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,400
Must be the boss's dog.

1004
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,600
We keep digging, 
maybe, we'll find his wife.

1005
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,817
Keep going.  Just ... 

1006
01:26:57,867 --> 01:26:59,600
dig behind that tree.

1007
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:06,980
Thanks.

1008
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:10,152
It's over, Jen. 

1009
01:27:10,641 --> 01:27:12,502
Did all I could.

1010
01:27:12,552 --> 01:27:13,941
So, have you.

1011
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,300
The kid isn't here.

1012
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,100
You can't dredge up all the
mud in this swamp.

1013
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,700
He lied to you, one more time.

1014
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:31,600
Maybe, he isn't the one who lied.

1015
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:38,100
Lady ... phone for you.

1016
01:27:38,149 --> 01:27:39,600
Thanks. Sorry.

1017
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:43,500
Hello.
[Kimberly] Can't you leave Nicky in peace?

1018
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,055
Can't you just leave him where he is, 

1019
01:27:46,105 --> 01:27:47,100
once and for all?

1020
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:50,800
He's not here, Kimberly.

1021
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,700
Nicholas is not buried here.

1022
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:57,005
We found nothing.

1023
01:27:57,055 --> 01:27:59,300
Brendan lied to you.

1024
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,900
Who cares where he is?

1025
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,502
The only thing I'm sure of is,

1026
01:28:04,552 --> 01:28:06,300
I'll never see him again.

1027
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,800
Where are you?

1028
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,300
What do you care?

1029
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,300
If you ever hear from that
kid Frederic, again ...

1030
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,700
you tell him I said to take care.

1031
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,100
Kimberly!

1032
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,487
Kimberly, wait!

1033
01:28:26,537 --> 01:28:27,900
Kimberly!

1034
01:29:50,395 --> 01:29:55,395
