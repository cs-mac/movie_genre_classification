1
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,320
I came to tell you

2
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Today I have been sworn in
as a lawyer.

3
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,840
You must be sorry,
but I am sworn in...

4
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,920
...and this is the last time
I'll come here.

5
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,920
Farewell for ever.
You no longer exist for me.

6
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,200
Congratulations.

7
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,160
You congratulate me?

8
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,680
I can't take your hand.

9
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,160
The hand of someone
who always opposed me.

10
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,200
Or helped...or helped.

11
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,640
Or helped...or helped!

12
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,840
CHARACTER

13
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,480
The victim congratulates you...
He says "congratulations",

14
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,480
extends his hand...
you take it and then leave.

15
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,920
It must have been quite
a handshake!

16
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,880
On the way downstairs...
...you stumbled on the stairs.

17
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,440
Have you seen this before?

18
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,360
You don't recognise it?
It's a lovely knife.

19
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,240
But not as lovely as this...

20
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,440
Take it...

21
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,160
Go on! Take it.

22
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,200
You know the feeling? Do you?

23
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,040
Call a doctor.

24
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,120
Would you like something
to drinkng? To eat?

25
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,600
For me too, please.

26
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,400
Mr Jacob Willem Katadreuffe...

27
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,680
Is that the right pronunciation?
"Katadreuffe?"

28
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,440
You are suspected of murder
or manslaughter of bailiff...

29
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,280
Arend Barend Dreverhaven.

30
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,520
That name sounds like
imminent thunder.

31
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,120
So you visited Dreverhaven
this afternoon...

32
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,440
...but nothing unusual happened.

33
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,480
What was your relationship
to Mr Dreverhaven.

34
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,640
Mr Katadreuffe?

35
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,400
Dreverhaven...

36
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,280
The name was a legend long
before I heard it.

37
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,200
It won't be long, sir,
maybe tonight...

38
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,360
God bless you, sir,
you're a good...

39
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,560
Bastard! Dirty bastard!

40
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,200
Dreverhaven,

41
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,400
Bailiff...

42
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,440
Law without compassion...

43
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,520
...the curse of the poor.

44
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,360
I know Dreverhaven's reputation...

45
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,240
but what was your relationship
to him?

46
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,440
You did business with him?

47
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,480
You worked for him?

48
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,120
He worked for you?

49
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,560
When did you first
meet Dreverhaven?

50
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,760
At home...

51
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,640
At home he had a housekeeper.

52
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,440
...Jacoba, Joba for short.

53
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,320
She was a surly young woman,
but he didn't mind.

54
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,360
He didn't say much either.

55
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,880
She worked for him for
a year when one evening...

56
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,800
it happened only once.
Nothing changed between them...

57
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,280
...but six weeks later
she broke the silence.

58
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,560
I am pregnant.

59
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,760
Well...

60
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,760
I'm leaving.

61
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,520
The father has to
support the child.

62
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,880
You will make him pay, won't you?

63
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,600
No.

64
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,640
Have you written to him?

65
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,520
No.

66
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,640
But you will write?!

67
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,680
No! No!

68
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Dreverhaven is your father.

69
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,600
I am named after my mother.

70
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,800
You mean... Dreverhaven wouldn't
take responsibility?

71
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,280
No...

72
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,240
It wasn't that. After the birth
we moved to the other side of town

73
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,600
She moved to East.

74
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,520
She rented a room
at 142 Zeilstraat...

75
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,360
...for 7 guilders a week.

76
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,800
She keeps house for
three middle-class families...

77
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,880
...and a doctor on East Quay.

78
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,480
And the child? It has a name?

79
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,840
Jacob.

80
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,800
Jacob Willem.

81
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,600
Dreverhaven's message
was three words.

82
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,280
WHEN'S OUR WEDDING?

83
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,560
The proposal was accompanied by
a postal order for a suitable sum

84
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,280
"Returned to sender"!

85
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,720
Dreverhaven took the money back...

86
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,960
...and sent it to
her again a month later.

87
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,600
And she sent it back again...

88
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,840
...and the sent it again
the next month.

89
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,720
"Returned to sender"!

90
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,800
The postal-order duel lasted
more than a year.

91
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Would you like to come in?

92
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,920
The money went back and
forth 13 times...

93
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,480
...so she decided to
reconsider his proposal.

94
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,640
BASTARD

95
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,480
Your monther is a whore!

96
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,520
It wasn't the first time
my father's "absence" was mentioned.

97
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,480
When I asked who or where he was
she always answered:

98
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,040
We need nothing of him
We need nothing of him.

99
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,160
Then she was silent, as always.

100
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,000
I live across the road
Am I intruding?

101
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,600
My wife died.

102
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,160
Well I thought, just seeing you...

103
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,120
that you may want to
know I'm available.

104
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,960
You don't have to decide at once.

105
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,880
I shall consider your proposal.

106
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,840
I thought it was a good idea
to marry him.

107
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,960
Unfortunately
we soon left the area.

108
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,000
Your mother's a whore.

109
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,760
Jacob, Jacob...

110
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,120
Go home!

111
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,960
Whore!

112
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,520
Go away!

113
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,160
That same day,
mother packed our cases...

114
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,520
...and we looked for
another house.

115
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,640
My mother said nothing
all evening...

116
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,600
...but I know I had hurt her...

117
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,600
...because I had lost control.

118
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,000
I decided to
control myself an all times.

119
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,920
That is a good intention,
Mr Katadreuffe.

120
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,320
Did you stick to it today?

121
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,120
Yes.

122
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,960
That didn't help Dreverhaven.

123
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,200
That's what you say.

124
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,680
Anyway, you met Dreverhaven
this afternoon.

125
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,760
I assume it wasn't the first time

126
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,840
Yes.

127
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,120
Our move took us closer to him.

128
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,200
By the harbour.

129
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,120
Mother bought a sewing machine
to earn the rent.

130
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,680
That house also had something that
was to play a major role later.

131
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,920
The books were in
a foreign language...

132
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,280
and the previous inhabitants had
moved abroad, so I could keep them.

133
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,160
From then on it was easier to
be silent with her.

134
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,280
I studied the wonderful pictures
for days...

135
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,800
and the strange words
were less alien than I thought.

136
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,040
Elephant.

137
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,280
Elephant in English.

138
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,920
My monther's eternal silence made me
think...she could not bear my company.

139
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,680
Only later did I realise
our characters clashed.

140
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,040
Our contacts were awkward and...

141
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,400
...would always remain awkward,
because we were opposites.

142
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,080
Jacob!

143
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,320
Joba!

144
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
Come on...

145
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,960
Jacob! Jacob!

146
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,240
- There's a boy at the door.
- He's looking for his father.

147
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,920
Name?

148
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,080
Smith...

149
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,600
Smith...

150
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,040
Smith...

151
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,640
Name?

152
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,080
De Beer.

153
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,600
Maas...

154
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,120
Verkerk...

155
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,600
Dreverhaven.

156
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,720
Dreverhaven, 11 South Quay.

157
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,200
I'm sorry, I've never seen
this boy before.

158
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:32,880
Shit

159
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,520
We need nothing of him.

160
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,160
Wait.

161
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,400
From then on I decided to
leave him alone.

162
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,880
I can understand that. Cigarette?

163
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,120
Thanks.

164
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,280
How did you get on then?

165
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,280
You're a lawyer,
you must have studied.

166
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
After school,
Mother didn't let me learn a trade

167
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,840
There was no money.
I had to take care of myself.

168
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,600
I had one job after another.

169
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,400
Van Zwavel, Huizing, Kerk...

170
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,680
...Katadreuffe!

171
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,560
I'm sorry. Try again next month.
Off you go.

172
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,360
Work was usually temporary,
with weeks unemployed in between.

173
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,520
I filled the time reading
my encyclopedia.

174
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,960
It only went up to T,
but I didn't care.

175
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,920
I used a dictionary to decipher it.
I absorbed the knowledge pate by page.

176
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,440
Meanwhile we increasingly got on
each others nerves.

177
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,920
I wanted to leave
and earn my own living.

178
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,760
She apparently wanted
exactly the same.

179
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,680
It's small, but dry and warm.

180
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,320
My son is moving to
the back room.

181
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,200
How much?

182
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,320
Seven guilders, full board.

183
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,200
I'd rather you didn't smoke
in the room.

184
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,920
I'm Jan Maan.

185
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,880
Jan Maan was a Communist.
A lathe operator who moved in...

186
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,520
...after quarrelling with
his parents about his fiancee.

187
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,440
Trudy...I met her in a lunchroom.

188
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,960
My mother said; Lunchroom?
She lives off tips.

189
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,360
Four weeks later
the engagement was off.

190
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,440
But Jan Maan always stayed
with us.

191
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,480
I looked outside this morning,

192
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,920
summer is late this year, madam.

193
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,040
No sign of it yet.

194
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,680
It could be quite a while.

195
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,640
- She never speaks.
- Something between you?

196
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,760
She thinks
I should get out more.

197
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,640
Look for work.

198
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,840
Build something, climb the ladder

199
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,640
This society doesn't want climbers.

200
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,880
You're going to change that?

201
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,360
The Party is growing steadily.

202
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,760
That's because of unemployment.

203
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,960
Everyone will be a Communist by
the end of the century.

204
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,080
You have time to come along
with me.

205
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Good afternoon, we came about
the advert.

206
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,880
You have a shop for sale?

207
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,120
You're standing in it, Mr...?

208
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Katadreuffe.

209
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,040
The name's Lucas Meijer.

210
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,840
What will it cost, Mr Meijer?

211
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,720
Nine hundred.

212
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,000
200 for the stock and 700 for
the goodwill.

213
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,680
I don't know

214
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,520
but 700 for the goodwill?

215
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,560
I don't think he has any customers

216
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,760
I can see something in it.

217
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,120
You see any customers?

218
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,920
It's early and about to rain.

219
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,040
And who's going to pay the money?

220
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,040
I want to loan.

221
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,600
How much?

222
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,960
Nine hundred.

223
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,040
Nine hundred.

224
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,360
I assume
you have enough collateral.

225
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,400
You have collateral?

226
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,040
You have no collateral?!

227
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
I don't think we can do business.

228
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,640
I'm very sorry sir.

229
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,440
MONEY FAST?
PEOPLE'S CREDIT SOCIETY

230
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,840
Good afternoon.
I wondered if I could...

231
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,520
Yes, how much?

232
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:43,480
I borrowed 900 to take over a cigar shop.

233
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,480
I'm moving out.

234
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,680
You could say something.

235
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,160
Do as you please.

236
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,600
Do as you please!
She's in for a surprise.

237
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,000
It's very quiet here.

238
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,120
It's early.

239
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,600
And it's about to rain, right?

240
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,680
You might be right.

241
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,600
Look,

242
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,120
if you need me,
you can always find me.

243
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,160
Good luck.

244
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,720
Good luck and thank you.

245
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,960
The best of luck...

246
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,840
Tell mother not to worry.

247
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,920
I've come to see Mr Meijer,
it's urgent!

248
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,160
Meijer!

249
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,240
Mr Lucas Meijer?

250
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,320
Yes, what do you want?

251
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,240
Bak with mother I realised
I never wanted my own business.

252
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,200
Certainly not a cigar shop.

253
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,760
It was just an attempt to
escaped her.

254
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,920
But with serious consequences.

255
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,760
Dear Mr Katadreuffe,
you were not home...

256
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,280
but your bankruptcy
has been requested...

257
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,800
bankruptcy requested by
the Peoles's Credit Society.

258
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,880
That bank?

259
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,640
Your property has been
inventoried today.

260
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,720
My books!

261
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,000
Please report to
my office tomorrow...

262
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,760
with a summary of the bookkeeping
bank debts and rent...

263
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,160
and a list of other debtors.

264
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,240
Yours truly, J. de Gankelarr,
receiver.

265
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,880
Good afternoon,
you have an appointment?

266
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,960
Yes, I came to see Dr de Gankelaar
Mr Katadreuffe?

267
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,200
Mr Katadreuffe
for Dr de Gankelaar.

268
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,960
Sir, come this way.

269
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,800
Jacob? Well?

270
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,080
"Come back tomorrow."

271
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,480
I told them all about the business
the bank, everything...

272
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,840
I have to come back tomorrow.

273
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,240
They can't get money
if you're broke.

274
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,480
They need someone
and I said you had experience.

275
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,800
I know it isn't true,
but you just have to use your head

276
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,080
Yes, but listen...

277
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,320
I have a job...

278
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,360
I will have a job...at that office

279
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,440
What office?

280
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,240
That law office. I'll work there.

281
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,520
You asked for work there?

282
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
I'm going to ask. I'll work there

283
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,920
At a law office?

284
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,400
Yes.

285
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,800
But lawyers work think.

286
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,480
Yes.

287
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,240
- Then you...
- I'm going home, to think

288
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,440
Jacob!

289
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,960
Jacob!

290
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,440
Your property is worth 15 guilders

291
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,400
That is the value of your books
and that's all you have?

292
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,560
Fifteen guilders is not enough
for a bankruptcy...

293
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,240
I shall advise the court to suspend
your bankruptcy of lack of funds...

294
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,360
I assume you don't object?

295
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,640
You mean...?

296
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,520
I mean I shall ask the court to
suspend your bankruptcy,

297
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,320
agreed?

298
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,840
Good.

299
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,320
Sir, I would like to
ask you something else.

300
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,520
What will you do?
Your plans for the future?

301
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,600
I have been looking for work.

302
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,040
Work, terrible.

303
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,520
Office work.

304
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,080
Even worse. Don't do it.

305
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,640
I thought of an office like this.

306
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,040
Don't, it's so boring.

307
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,520
I could use an assistant,
of coures...

308
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,960
You mean that?

309
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,040
It's been nice meeting you.

310
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,600
Don't let me keep you.

311
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,960
You want to know
my qualifications.

312
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,880
Excuse me?

313
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,240
I don't want to sound arrogant,

314
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,280
but I know more than
you would think.

315
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:31,560
You mean your books?
Your encyclopedia?

316
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,120
It may be outdated and incomplete

317
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,560
It only goes up to T...

318
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,960
To "T"? That means...

319
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,600
that you can't "type", but can
do bookkeeping and shorthand.

320
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,720
There are things I shall have
to learn...

321
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,440
You are zealous, but what are
your skills, Mr Katadreuffe?

322
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,240
Could you come down?
A client of Dr Stroomkoning.

323
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,920
Mr F. from E.

324
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,600
I'm coming.

325
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:05,720
You've fascinated me,Mr Katadreuffe
but you haven't convinced me.

326
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,320
Please excuse me.

327
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,480
Mr Forester, what a suprise.

328
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:21,240
What's wrong? He did'nt pick me.

329
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,200
He's not here.

330
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,240
There must be an explanation,
Miss Sibculo...

331
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,200
Yes, Dr de Gankelaar?

332
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,960
Dr Stroomkoning wrongly went to
the station an hour late.

333
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,440
We're trying to reach the station

334
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,560
How's it?

335
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,200
Sorry for interupt

336
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,160
The man gets wrong

337
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,640
He's late for one hour

338
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,000
We're looking for him

339
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,200
He's at station or home.

340
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,560
I see, who are you

341
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,200
Dr Stroomkoning called

342
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:17,280
and he's on his way!

343
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,440
Young man, who are you

344
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,640
and what on earth are you doing?

345
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,360
Sorry.

346
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,200
- I'm very sorry.
- It's ok, but..

347
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,800
Who's this young man?

348
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,720
He applied for a job,

349
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,520
as my personal clerk.

350
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,640
Clerk?

351
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,800
He speaks good English, does'nt he?

352
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,360
Sir? To be honest...

353
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,560
I think we could use him.

354
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,560
That has to be now?

355
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,800
May I be allowed to comment?

356
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,200
I think he will be an asset.

357
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,080
Sixty guilders a month and
that's all.

358
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,520
- Come on...
- Sir? Sir...

359
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,640
Congratulations.

360
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,440
My mother said nothing
about me leaving. Nothing...

361
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,440
Not even "do as you please".

362
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,200
You will drop by, won't you?

363
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,680
And you know where to find me.

364
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,560
I decided not to worry.

365
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,160
I rented a room with
the office caretaker.

366
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,760
I was free and we were free of
each other at last.

367
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,320
Thank you.

368
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,160
If you need anything, just ask.

369
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,520
Jacob Willem,

370
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,560
here are two new shirts.
Be careful with them. Mother.

371
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,160
My work was to start in 5 days.

372
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,520
At night I taught myself to
type at the office...

373
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,320
and during the day
I practiced shorthand in my room.

374
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,480
Mr Katadreuffe: Miss Sibculo,

375
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,160
Dr Carlion, Dr Rustenburger...

376
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,560
Miss Born, behind Dr Sprengers,
then the Buregijks...

377
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,680
And of course Mr Rentenstein,

378
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,760
meet our new colleague.

379
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,720
No introduction necessary.
I saw his show last week.

380
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,480
I hope we shall be spared more of
such performances.

381
00:44:53,600 --> 00:45:00,280
And invite you to consider
a mutually acceptable solution.

382
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,440
What are you doing?

383
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,840
Counting the syllables per minute

384
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,560
It could be faster, couldn't it?

385
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,600
I think so, sir.

386
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,880
You think so...

387
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,400
Do you realise the consequences?

388
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:16,840
If you get faster, I must too.

389
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,760
I don't mean to rush you, sir.

390
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,960
Miss te George, just in time.

391
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,440
My new clerk is too fast.
Please take over.

392
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:27,920
You have met?

393
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,720
No

394
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,000
Mr katadreuffe, miss te George

395
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,800
is Dr Stoomkoning's secretary.

396
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,360
Don't worry, she only came to
tack down some French.

397
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,000
You don't speak French too,
do you?

398
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:38,920
No...That's a relief.

399
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,440
I propose you find
a machine downstairs...

400
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,240
To type this morning's dictation.
Don't hurry.

401
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,880
What a wonderful case.

402
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,640
I knew I had found my destiny.

403
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,600
In this place...

404
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,720
In this office,
the world opened up to me.

405
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,520
No one could stop me.

406
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,000
Mr. Katadreuffe,that was very nasty
of Mr. Rentenstein earlier.

407
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,960
Don't take any notice.

408
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,800
Not even Mr. Rentenstein.

409
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,920
Miss Sibculo...

410
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,560
The man who just went to
see Mr. Rentenstein?

411
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,640
What's he doing here?

412
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,760
Bailiff Dreverhaven,
you don't know him?

413
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,520
Does he work here?
No, thank goodness.

414
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,080
That bolldhound only comes
for Rentenstein...

415
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,560
Or if we need a bailiff.

416
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,520
What did you say?

417
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,840
If we need a bailiff.

418
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,680
"Bankruptcy J.W. Katadreuffe,

419
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,440
books, most in bad condition.

420
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,400
Encyclopedia, incomplete,
value 15 guilders.

421
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,000
He came to our house.

422
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,600
I'm de Gankelaar. I have come for
Mr J.W. Katadreuffe.

423
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,320
Where is it?

424
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,840
I fear the People's Credit Society
wants his bankruptcy.

425
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:26,000
He borrowed 900
Guilders in April 1923.

426
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:32,520
It is known that his cigar shop
was not particularly successful.

427
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,400
Could I take a look?

428
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,360
It seems you've look it before.

429
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,560
Mr. Katadreuffe.

430
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,840
Mr. Katadreuffe, come with me.

431
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,440
Dear sir,

432
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,520
we inform you that the bank

433
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,720
has again requested bankruptcy.

434
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:10,640
Please appear in court
next Wednesday.

435
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,120
Yours truly, Dr Schuwagt.

436
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,880
- You can't get money
- If you're broke, but now you aren't you have an income.

437
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
They'll take your wages, unless
we can make a deal with Schuwagt...

438
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,640
But Dreverhaven will never agree.

439
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,480
Why Dreverhaven?

440
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,600
You borrowed from him, didn't you?

441
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,120
Didn't you know it was his bank?

442
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,680
Everybody knows.
It's not easy to get out of it.

443
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,120
Please excuse me.

444
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,000
It's his bank!

445
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,840
It's his bank!
I borrowed the money from him!

446
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,680
He pronounced me bankrupt!

447
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:57,800
Well?

448
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,760
Debt is debt.

449
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,240
Why didn't you say he was here?

450
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,120
Why don't you ever say anything?

451
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,960
I'm going out. See you later?

452
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,040
I'll go with you.

453
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,120
Why don't you go and see him.

454
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,080
Go to him?

455
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,560
I did once. It wasn't a good idea

456
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,040
So you do nothing?

457
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:44,200
I do: I go bankrupt...
Lose my job and get drunk.

458
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:49,840
The situation is in danger of
escalating...

459
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,920
Do we watch helpless...

460
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,560
as our comrades are thrown in jail?

461
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,200
No

462
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,640
Or...

463
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:08,200
do we go to
Ruigbroekstraat tonight?

464
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,000
To show the enemy
we're not afraid...

465
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,560
Look him in the eye...
And fight for our rights!

466
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,920
Go on!

467
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,000
Jacob Willem.
You came to pay your debt?

468
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:16,040
Did she send you?
No, she couldn't.

469
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,320
Why are you doing this?

470
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,160
To you?

471
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,240
Yes, to me, To her. Why?

472
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,640
You didn't come to do business.

473
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,880
No. I came to...

474
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,880
I came to say
I'm not afraid of you.

475
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,360
Good, then I'll see you tomorrow
in court.

476
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,080
Hello

477
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,960
Stop!

478
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,160
Stop!

479
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,080
I want to know
why you're doing this.

480
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,280
Good... We'll come to terms.

481
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:19,840
I suggest payment is 36 instalments
on the same conditions as the loan.

482
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,800
This is a once-only offer...

483
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,200
I didn't ask for that!

484
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,160
If you don't like it...

485
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,800
Never mind.

486
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,520
Take him home.
He can think about my proposal.

487
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,080
I need nothing of you.
I'd rather go bankrupt.

488
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,120
Bailiff Dreverhaven with
an eviction order in Ruigbroekstraat.

489
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,320
Bailiff Dreverhaven with
an eviction order in Ruigbroekstraat.

490
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,040
Tonight? He can't be serious.

491
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,320
That's suicide. Come back
in a week.

492
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,800
Dreverhaven!

493
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,760
Dreverhaven!

494
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,280
Dreverhaven!

495
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:48,120
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

496
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,480
Don't shoot!

497
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,800
Dreverhaven was not in court
for my bankruptcy.

498
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,440
His interests were represented
by Dr Schuwagt.

499
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,560
And Dr de Wever
was appointed receiver.

500
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:35,160
Plus fifteen guilders from
your wages.

501
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,520
Are you sure you can spare it
every month?

502
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,080
The sooner the debt is payed off.

503
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,280
You have no other possessions?

504
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,360
No.

505
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,680
De Wever, may I speak to you
in private?

506
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,560
Dr de Wever...

507
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:11,800
The books. I hope we can avoid...
Them being seized.

508
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,440
The value is 15 guilders.
What do you suggest?

509
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,400
The boy is in your debt.

510
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:28,720
Based on my present wages... My
bankruptcy would last at least 18 months.

511
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:32,280
It was a miserable time
but there was hope.

512
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,400
Good evening.

513
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,600
Good evening, miss.

514
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:54,320
You shouldn't work too hard
You don't ollk too good.

515
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,720
It's good to study,
but in moderation.

516
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:01,880
How do you know I'm studying?

517
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,600
We all know. You read books.

518
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,640
I do.
But I don't have much time now.

519
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,280
What are you working on?

520
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,160
A plea, and you?

521
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,920
I'm translating a contract
for Dr Stroomkoning.

522
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,320
In French.

523
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,400
Yes. Is your room satisfactory?

524
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,720
Yes. I'm satisfied with it.

525
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,400
May I see it?

526
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,560
Not now. Later, when we Finish.

527
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,840
It was already there.

528
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,600
Can you open this?

529
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:58,720
To be homest... I never tried.

530
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,560
Your own roof garden. Not bad.

531
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,920
Where do you live?

532
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,560
At home, with my parents.
I lived in the suburbs.

533
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,600
I lived with my mother too.

534
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,000
You have other relatives?

535
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,360
I bear my mother's name.
I'm her only child.

536
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,680
I mean: a friend of mine lodges there.

537
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,280
He's a communist.
We have heated debates about it.

538
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:36,000
Who? You and him
or you and your mother?

539
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:39,560
He and I.
My mother never says much.

540
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,080
It's good
if people can be quiet together.

541
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,640
You aren't afraid of heights?

542
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,480
It's getting late.

543
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:19,080
On 1 February 1924,
my debt was paid.

544
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,920
I took mother and Jan Maan out
to celebrate.

545
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:27,040
I was free of Dreverhaven...
But did not feel at all satisfied

546
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:51,560
The whole sum. In cluding interest,
paid punctually in twelve instalments.

547
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,360
"Exceptional."

548
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,760
I'll drink to that.

549
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,080
To you, Jacob Willem.

550
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,040
Because you are "exceptional".

551
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,480
Tomorrow morning... At 8 a.m.

552
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:28,000
you will be evicted...

553
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,200
In the name of the law.

554
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,040
You don't have the right!

555
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:39,280
You don't have the right!

556
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,520
Filthy bastard!

557
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I want another loan from you.

558
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,520
I need money.

559
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,680
How much?

560
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,000
Two thousand guilders.

561
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,200
Tomorrow at 9 a.m. at the bank.

562
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,040
You wanted another loan?

563
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,680
You were free of him at last.

564
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:39,160
You didn't need to see him again.

565
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:43,240
But you went back and
started again?

566
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,880
I wanted to challenge him.
To beat him.

567
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,360
There's a lawyer for you, and
the coroner wants to talk to you.

568
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,040
Mr Katadreuffe,

569
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,960
your militancy comes from
your mother.

570
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:02,040
Your birth was a fight too.

571
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,360
I remember, she suffered
strange contractions.

572
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,040
As if she didn't want you bom.

573
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,960
You approached Dreverhaven
because you wanted to defeat him.

574
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,200
I can understand that, but why...

575
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:21,720
Did Dreverhaven accept?

576
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,880
Dreverhaven didn't need to.
He had already won...

577
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,400
Several times.

578
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,840
What did Dreverhaven want?

579
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,880
At first I thought
it was business.

580
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:41,080
Next morning
he lent me the whole sum.

581
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,800
The interest was only 8 percent.

582
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,320
But there was one explicit clause

583
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,720
You realise Mr Dreverhaven
can reclaim his loan at any moment?

584
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,440
- You mean that...
- That at any moment, we can reclaim the money,

585
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,840
whether it suits you or not.

586
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:08,800
Agreed.

587
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,640
Are you sure?

588
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,000
Details?

589
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,400
Is the contract.

590
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,920
The signature?

591
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,840
Despite Dreverhaven's condition,

592
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,760
I felt sure of myself.

593
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,720
I used his money to dedicate myself
to private lessons for two years.

594
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:36,160
It is not truth that counts...

595
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:40,440
Truth doesn't count in law...

596
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:41,880
but proof.

597
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,760
But that which can be proven...

598
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,840
proven...

599
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,120
You'll soon pass your exams,
young man...

600
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,200
The sooner better, madame.

601
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,480
The sooner The better.

602
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,480
Good-bye

603
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,480
Good-night

604
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,240
Miss te George...

605
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,920
Good-bye

606
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:14,960
Miss te George...

607
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,280
I see you are leavintg,
but wondered...

608
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:21,920
If you could show me

609
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,840
Dr Srtoomkoning's library.

610
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:31,240
Go on in.

611
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,560
It's lovely.

612
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,440
That's where you work?

613
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,240
You can go in.

614
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,160
I'm on holiday from tomorrow...

615
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,560
Until the end of July.

616
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,400
You'll like that.

617
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,880
I'm not so sure.

618
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,960
The prospect of staying at home...

619
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,560
I like working here.
I like being here.

620
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,000
So do I.

621
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:43,280
You know...
I want to tell you something.

622
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,480
I'm not so sure I should.

623
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,960
You may think I'm silly.

624
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,000
But when I first came here...

625
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,280
And saw the office from
the outside...

626
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,440
The sun shimmered...
And I saw...

627
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,920
I saw my own name on the front.

628
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:09,000
Between Messrs Carlion
and Rustenburger.

629
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,120
That's strange, isn't it.

630
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:18,320
Miss te George...still at work?

631
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:23,040
Mr Katadreuffe wanted to
see the library.

632
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:25,520
That's very good,

633
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,080
but I want to lock up.

634
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,000
Don't let us stop you,
we've finished.

635
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,200
Good evening, Mr. Katadreuffe,

636
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,360
Mr. Rentenstein...

637
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,120
Mr. Rentenstein...

638
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,560
Mr. Katadreuffe...

639
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,960
Mr. Katadreuffe!

640
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,360
You've worked here for some time.

641
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:01,440
I see you are still just
as ambitious.

642
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,160
I even hear from Dr de Gankelaar

643
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,640
That your study
is progressing very well.

644
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:09,400
Dr de Gankelaar overestimates me.

645
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,520
I don't think
you can be overestimated.

646
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,600
But I should warn you that this office
offers opportunities. For people of your class...

647
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:22,560
But they are not unlimited.
Understand?

648
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,000
I understand.

649
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:32,080
I'm grateful for your reminder,
Mr Rentenstein.

650
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,440
That's all right.

651
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,440
I assume you speak from experience

652
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,480
The encounter with Miss te george

653
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,640
Her reaction to my vision...

654
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:51,440
Kept me awake for several nights.

655
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,240
She was still on my mind...

656
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,640
When Jan Maan introduced
his new fiancee three weeks later.

657
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,200
That's not true!

658
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,040
You'd forget to feed him.
She forgets everything.

659
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:14,200
Listen to him! Scoundrel!

660
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,160
What a temperament.

661
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,040
Coby.

662
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,520
I met Coby in a store.

663
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,400
My parents don't approve.

664
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,200
"All sorts pass by there.

665
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:36,480
That's no good," said mother.

666
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,240
Coby ran off three weeks later
"With another".

667
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,760
Mr Katadreuffe!

668
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,720
Mr Katadreuffe!

669
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,520
I know what you think.That meeting
here is an incredible coincidence,

670
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,760
but there's no such thing...

671
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,640
Who says there's no such thing?

672
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,440
I do. But I'm sure there
are theories. I'm over there.

673
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,360
Have you been swimming?

674
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,440
I only just arrived, And you?

675
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,760
This morning, briefly.

676
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,560
But if you go,

677
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,480
I'd love to come too.

678
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,400
Unless you object.

679
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:22,240
Not at all,it's just...

680
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,520
You can swim?

681
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,800
I don't have a costume...
Just books.

682
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:30,440
- You came here to...
- Just to study, yes.

683
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,480
I should have known.

684
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,200
How about a stroll?

685
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,400
A stroll... You have time?

686
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,080
Of course.

687
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,320
Lorna?

688
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,360
- Hello.
- Changed already?

689
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,600
And who's this?

690
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,720
He's from the office.

691
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,480
Van Rijn's the name.

692
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:52,240
Katadreuffe.

693
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,160
Right you are. Cigarette?

694
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,320
No thank you.

695
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,320
How about you, Lorna.

696
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,840
No thanks.

697
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,680
Lovely here, isn't it?

698
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,880
Lorna.

699
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,760
It was the first time
I heard her first name.

700
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:07,800
This man called her Lorna.

701
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,320
Jacob, Jacob!

702
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,320
Friends of yours?

703
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,440
We're back, yoohoo.

704
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,760
Cheerful types.

705
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,640
I'd better go and see.

706
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,160
Nice to meet you

707
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,360
Mr...Van Rijn. And you.

708
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,160
Strange fellow...

709
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,760
Who are they? From the office?

710
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,280
I'm going home.

711
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,320
We just got here.

712
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,800
Sorry,I have a terrible headache.

713
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:33,840
Jacob?

714
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:35,680
Van Rijn.

715
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,800
Jacob?

716
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:40,480
Van Rijn.
She never mentioned him before.

717
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,760
Never! She was never brought
or fetched by a Mr van Rijn.

718
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,400
Mr. Katadreuffe?

719
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,200
Mr. Katadreuffe.

720
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,360
Mr. Katadreuffe?

721
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,480
I'm sorry to interrupt... But Dr. Stroomkoning
wants to see you urgently.

722
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,800
He expects you in half an hour.

723
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,720
That's a joke.

724
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,760
You haven't seen the last of me.

725
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,600
Mr. Katadreuffe,
maybe you've heard...

726
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:42,760
That there have been
cash deficits recently.

727
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,440
As a result I have just dismissed
Mr. Rentenstein.

728
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:52,200
I assume you are not sorry.
Nor me.

729
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,440
Would you like to eat?

730
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,520
No thank you.

731
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:00,400
Then I'll come to the point
and make a proposal.

732
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:07,400
I was appointed office manager...

733
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,040
But we'd not seen the last of
Rentenstein.

734
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:18,920
Mr. Katadreuffe...Congratulations
on your well-earned promotion.

735
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,600
Secondly...

736
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:24,000
Dreverhaven wants his money back
at once.

737
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,440
The whole sum within three days.

738
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:30,240
Now?! Just before my exams!

739
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:33,040
He's already applied for
your bankruptcy.

740
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,000
But that's impossible.

741
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:39,040
Last time I was in debt to
the bank and the landlord.

742
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,280
Now I only have one creditor
so I can't go bankrupt.

743
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,440
That's right,
but Dreverhaven knows that too.

744
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,440
He's bluffing.

745
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,840
I'm not in debt to anyone else.

746
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:53,520
If you go bankrupt, Stroomkoning can't
keep you. You'll lose everything.

747
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,320
Dreverhaven doesn't have a chance

748
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,560
I'll represent you.

749
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,560
Thank you, but no.

750
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:06,280
The PCS bank
versys J.W.Katadreuffe.

751
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,400
I see Dr de Gankelaar
represents you?

752
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,000
Yes, your honour.

753
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,080
Very good.

754
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,080
This concerns a debt to...

755
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,880
This concerns a debt to...

756
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,400
The people's Credit Society.

757
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,400
Is this debt recognised?

758
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,000
Yes indeed, your honour.

759
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,640
Does the petitioned havae
any other debts?

760
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,960
No, your honour,

761
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,880
just one.

762
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,800
Sorry, your honour.

763
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,040
My client has no other debts.

764
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,640
Is that correct, Dr Schuwagt?

765
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,520
That is incorrect.

766
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,840
You are misinformed, sir.

767
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,000
Dr de Gankelaar!

768
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:02,360
Your honour, let me state that
the petitioned has been bankrupt.

769
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:07,880
That did end with repayment but... The petitioned
has since incurred other debts.

770
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:08,960
That is not true, your honour.

771
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:12,440
Dr de Gankelaar,
I am warning your client.

772
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:14,600
Not necessary, your honour.

773
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:17,640
I have my information form
the best source, Mr Katadreuffe.

774
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:23,440
The list of your previous bankruptcy
includes an entry under assets...

775
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,400
"Private sale of books,
fifteen guilders."

776
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:31,720
Dr de Gankelaar paid the fifteen guilders...
To prevent seizure of the books.

777
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,760
Your honour...

778
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:36,960
But the petitioned still has
the books, so that means...

779
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:37,640
Your honour...

780
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:42,920
Dr de gankelaar is a creditor for
the sum of fifteen guilders.

781
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,880
I would like a brief adjournment,
your honour.

782
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,520
May I?

783
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,080
I'm sorry. He's right.

784
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:54,480
I bought your books to
prevent seizure.

785
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,800
I don't want that!
I'll give you the fifteen guilders.

786
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:00,480
You don't understand. I give it
to you and the case is closed.

787
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:01,520
I can't possibly accept it.

788
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,520
Excuse me?

789
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:06,080
Dreverhaven has won,
I should never have taken him on.

790
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,800
Are you crazy? I give you
the money and it's all over.

791
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,600
That's very nice,
but I can't accept.

792
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:11,720
What?

793
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,960
A debt is a debt.

794
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,840
Who taught you that?

795
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,720
Who taught you that
senseless self-chastisement?

796
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,960
I give you the money
and you take it!

797
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:29,520
People who can't accept a gift,
can't give either,

798
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,960
Jacob Willem!

799
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:37,040
And you have so much to give,
boy!

800
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,920
I won't let them take it away
from you.

801
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,680
De Gankelaar decided the case
in our favour.

802
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:56,000
The second debt is irrelevant
and the bankruptcy is rejected.

803
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,640
The loser could take
two more steps.

804
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:04,640
He can force stroomkoning to
deduct from your salary or appeal.

805
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:07,160
But Dreverhaven
didn't do anything.

806
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,920
He didn't really want me
bankrupt either.

807
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,560
He just wanted to show
who was in charge...

808
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,040
What?

809
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:26,560
Three months later
I took my exams.

810
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,200
When I came home,there was no one
to congratulate me.

811
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:35,200
On the way home I thought of
visiting the enemy.

812
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:38,040
But I would have nothing to
say to him.

813
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:41,240
Just as I realised that...

814
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,960
He was standing in front of me.

815
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,640
Jacob willem...

816
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,840
What do you want?

817
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,600
What do you want?

818
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,320
I came to say
you didn't defeat me in court.

819
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,080
And that you'd better
leave me alone.

820
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,960
Or else?

821
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:20,880
Do something to me.

822
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:28,760
Do something to me!

823
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,120
Do something to me!

824
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,960
Do SOMETHING!

825
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,240
MR Katadreuffe.

826
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:18,440
Could you come in.

827
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:22,800
Miss George?

828
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:37,960
Miss George?

829
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,320
Surprise!

830
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,360
What? You didn't fail?

831
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,840
Bravo!

832
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,480
This is the latest edition.

833
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:17,000
And complete, all 24 parts.

834
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:22,440
"Knowledge" up to "Z".

835
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,680
Most is from Dr Stroomkoning...

836
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:29,840
But everyoune contributed.
It's from all of us.

837
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,200
Congratulations!

838
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:34,880
Thank you.

839
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,080
I fear I startled you.

840
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,720
You looked very shocked.

841
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,520
It's a strange evening.

842
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,400
I had my doubts.

843
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,400
You mean...

844
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,000
About tonight.

845
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:55,080
Whether I should do it.

846
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,360
I really appreciate it.

847
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,920
That afternoon, by the sea...

848
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:03,120
I think I owe you an explanation
I think you should know...

849
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,160
you don't need to.

850
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:07,520
I'm the one who should explain.

851
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,960
I don't know what was wrong
with me.

852
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,000
But this evening I know.

853
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,760
Mr. Katadreuffe, if I may...

854
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,120
Friends,

855
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,600
I'm very happy

856
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,200
Thank you for
the wonderful evening.

857
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,320
But I have something else to say.

858
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:50,360
Some may already have suspected,
but...

859
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:55,440
In september I start law school.

860
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:58,280
Bravo!

861
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,880
Bravo!

862
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,600
Everyone has certain gifts.

863
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,560
Each has to discover them.

864
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:11,520
Then he has to develop them...
So he can make propress.

865
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,560
I'm sure

866
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,040
each of us can make progress...

867
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,640
However low he starts.

868
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:21,520
Anyone with one goal who fights...

869
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:25,240
And is willing to
sacrifice everything...

870
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:29,080
Shall overcome all resistance

871
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,960
and setbacks.

872
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,680
As long as just one goal remains...

873
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,520
And he is not distracted..

874
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,040
And puts everything else aside.

875
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:49,360
Of that I am convinced.

876
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,360
I just wanted to say...

877
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:02,520
That I hope we all work together
in harmony.

878
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:07,120
I fear it was more of a sermon.

879
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:08,360
Thank you.

880
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:17,960
Nicely spoken, sir.

881
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,920
Are you tipsy?

882
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:27,440
Mr. Katadreuffe?

883
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:30,640
And so to bed...

884
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,120
I couldn't see it.
I didn't understand the signals.

885
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,560
I was so full of myself...
of my future...

886
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:06,360
Miss te George?

887
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,600
Miss?

888
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,560
I have to show you out.

889
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:43,240
Come back in,
the party's not over yet.

890
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,800
Miss te George did not come to
the office any more.

891
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:16,040
Next day she wrote to Stroomkoning
offering her resignation...

892
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:19,480
Without stating a reason

893
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,520
and she was never heard of again.

894
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:31,600
Mr. Katadreuffe, you are not well

895
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:35,320
You are very nervous
and physically exhausted.

896
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,200
You have no resistance.

897
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:37,840
But do you think I...

898
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,680
I don't think you can work.

899
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:44,680
You are burnt out
and a mental wreck.

900
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,680
Is that all?

901
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,080
No,one other thing.

902
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,200
Your mother is not well.

903
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:54,160
You know she has weak lungs.

904
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:56,360
It got worse recently.

905
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:01,400
There is no immediate cause
for concern.

906
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,120
Her illness is slow and
she could remain stable for years.

907
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,560
I wanted you to know.

908
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:18,680
She never mentions it.

909
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:23,720
Yeah

910
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:25,640
One day I might have to leave her

911
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,680
But I shall never marry.

912
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,400
I'm not the marrying type
and nor are you, Jacob.

913
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:36,360
A quiet period ensued,
the still before the storm.

914
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,160
I was still in debt...

915
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:42,600
But for two years
I heard nothing from Dreverhaven.

916
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:48,840
I heard his business was ailing

917
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:55,840
and about alcohol abuse
and fights...

918
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,960
When is the wedding, Joba?

919
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,440
When will we marry, joba?

920
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:58,840
Why not leave our boy in peace?

921
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,400
That boy...

922
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:09,720
I'll strangle him for nine tenths and the
last tenth will make him strong.

923
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,680
I shall never marry you.

924
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:19,320
But I assure you,
there has never been another.

925
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,920
Maybe I'll strangle him for
the last tenth too.

926
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,880
I'm giving notice.

927
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:15,720
You have three days to get out.

928
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:21,720
I'm giving notice.
You have three days.

929
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:26,320
You have three days
before I evict you.

930
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:55,880
The eviction tomorrow...
I'll call the police.

931
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,040
Tomorrow at 8 a.m...

932
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:44,400
You'll be evicted...

933
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,520
In the name of the law.

934
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:20,120
Come on. Let's go home.

935
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:39,120
Yes, be sensible...

936
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:40,880
And head for home.

937
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:43,720
Be sensible.

938
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:47,680
Go home.

939
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:45,920
Dreverhaven had
the floors removed...

940
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:48,000
For a lift
he would never install.

941
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:52,520
He's angry at them.

942
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:56,280
But the longer
he left me alone...

943
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:59,040
The more he haunted my thoughts.

944
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:06,240
But that first boarding
was quite something.

945
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,360
The ship had to be chained up
that afternoon.

946
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:12,960
We went looking for a bailiff.

947
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:16,360
When we found Dreverhaven,
the ship had sailed.

948
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,880
We chased it in a boat.

949
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,120
Then we saw
the ship heading down the river.

950
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:25,200
It had not picked up speed...

951
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:29,320
So Dreverhaven ordered the boat
to the bow.

952
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,720
Guess what he did? He jumped...

953
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:36,920
He jumped in the water.

954
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,600
How did you know?

955
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:45,160
I must have told the story
a hundred times.

956
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:50,880
Indeed, he jumped in the water

957
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:54,400
and everyone shouted:
"man overboard!"

958
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:58,160
Our boat was on the other side of
the bow...

959
01:37:58,280 --> 01:37:59,080
Joba!

960
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:03,200
So they had to
hoist Dreverhavaen aboard.

961
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:06,640
When he showed his bailiff s badge
to the captain...

962
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,760
Joba!

963
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:09,880
It was all over.

964
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,040
That man was brave.

965
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:22,800
Dreverhaven?
Brave or tired of life?

966
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:25,960
Yes, you could say tired of life.

967
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:27,880
He was afraid of nothing.

968
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:31,360
Someone like that
may know no fear, but isn't brave.

969
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:34,880
He's indifferent and
that makes him dangerous.

970
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:37,640
Dangerous? Come, come...

971
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:43,320
If dreverhaven hadn't stopped
that ship, we wouldn't be here.

972
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:47,800
Jacob?

973
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:01,240
I'm leaving the office.
I have applied for a position abroad.

974
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:05,800
When?

975
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,040
In four weeks time.

976
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:11,680
I'm about to graduate.

977
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,760
You'll be all right.

978
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,360
I wish I could come too.

979
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:24,720
No, you still
have some unfinished business.

980
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,480
Will you take care?

981
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:39,280
A month later,
De Gankelaar left for New Guinea.

982
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:44,400
He had been my mentor
and I was his protege.

983
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:47,120
I would miss him.

984
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,200
Good-bye.

985
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:53,000
Now he had left the office...

986
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:57,800
I decided to celebrate my graduation
With mother and Jan Maan.

987
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:08,240
You should thank God for
giving you such a good brain.

988
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:10,520
God?

989
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:14,360
Since when is God mentioned here?

990
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:17,560
To the next round.

991
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:21,760
Jacob? I'd like to go outside.

992
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:35,920
A lot's changed here.
These trees...weren't here.

993
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,520
Planted after the war.

994
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,960
Mother? When he first asked you

995
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,320
Why didn't you marry him?

996
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:05,000
You could see East Quay from here.

997
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:09,160
It was ugly, this is much better.

998
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,240
Mr. Katadreuffe!

999
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,640
Mrs ten Have.

1000
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:27,840
But Miss te George to you.

1001
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:30,360
Do you still live where you...?

1002
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,480
No, but not far from here.

1003
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:35,920
I persuaded my husband
to move here.

1004
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,400
He's a bookkeeper.

1005
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:43,000
How are you?

1006
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:45,840
Fine. I start my doctoral studies
tomorrow.

1007
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:49,640
Of course you'll pass
You always succeed.

1008
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,160
Then you'll be a lawyer.

1009
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,520
To begin with, yes...

1010
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:56,400
Being a lawyer is only the start.

1011
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:59,480
Then I have to specialise...

1012
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:02,480
Then things really start.

1013
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:05,200
And then I'm still not there,
because if I asid that...

1014
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:07,280
You haven't changed.

1015
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:09,360
I shall never marry anyone else.

1016
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,320
I never forgot you.

1017
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:24,920
You see that woman?
That's my mother.

1018
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,160
She's special.

1019
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:39,600
She must be...
If she's your mother.

1020
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:43,960
Will I see you again?

1021
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:47,200
By chance...

1022
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:51,000
I will wait for that chance.

1023
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:02,600
An old acquaintance.

1024
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:06,600
She was Stroomkoning's secretary.

1025
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,320
Was she spoken for?

1026
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,600
No.

1027
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:17,040
Really, you were an ass,
Jacob Willem.

1028
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:24,440
My mother died in
her sleep 18 months later.

1029
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,080
I hadn't seen Dreverhaven for
six years.

1030
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:13,000
He had left me alone.

1031
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:17,560
I wondered if this was the momnet
he'd been waiting for.

1032
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Now she was not between us,

1033
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:21,760
he could strike at any moment.

1034
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,320
But Dreverhaven did nothing.

1035
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:28,360
When I was sworn in
four months later...

1036
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:31,240
I started to realise
why he had done nothing.

1037
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:34,480
You sit over there,
Mr. Katadreuffe.

1038
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,320
If you'd excuse me a moment...

1039
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:38,640
As you wish.

1040
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:40,680
Come on, sit down...

1041
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:44,120
I had achieved all I wanted...

1042
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:45,600
But

1043
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,600
at the same time nothing.

1044
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:51,720
Dreverhaven knew that.

1045
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:54,760
He had known all along.

1046
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,520
Dreverhaven knew I would come
to see him today.

1047
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,520
Mr. Katadreuffe,
may I congratulate...

1048
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,880
I came to tell you:
Today I have been sworn in as lawyer.

1049
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:54,160
You must be sorry,
but I am sworn in...

1050
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:56,360
And this is the last time
I'll come here.

1051
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:04,440
Farewell for ever.
You no longer exist for me.

1052
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:18,600
Congratulations.

1053
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:21,760
You congratulate me?

1054
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:29,520
I can't take your hand.

1055
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:32,400
The hand of someone
who always opposed me.

1056
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,800
Or helped...

1057
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:41,520
Or helped!

1058
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:05,520
Help, help... Jacob.
Help me.

1059
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,920
Jocob

1060
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:45,080
Dreverhaven begged you to stab him
but you didn't

1061
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:49,120
you walked outside.

1062
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,200
You left Dreverhaven alive.

1063
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:58,160
Yes.

1064
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:00,600
Rubbish.

1065
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:05,600
It's the truth.

1066
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:10,200
Come with me.

1067
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:19,520
Dreverhaven was found by his lawyer
yesterday just before midnight.

1068
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:24,560
Not in the attic, but on
the ground floor...

1069
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:28,720
With a knife in his belly
and a broken neck from the fall.

1070
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:34,240
Witnesses saw Katadreuffe leave
at five p.m.

1071
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:40,800
This shows that the fatal wounds
were not inflicted before 11 p.m.

1072
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:43,240
I think the man is telling
the truth.

1073
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,880
Mr. Katadreuffe?

1074
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:07,600
What do you think happened
in the meantime?

1075
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:17,640
You think an "accident"?

1076
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,040
Jan!

1077
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:45,040
Christ, you look awful.

1078
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:47,680
I've been sitting here all night.

1079
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:50,120
I thought
you'd done something stupid.

1080
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:57,400
Good-bye

1081
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:01,280
I have something for you.

1082
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:05,240
Brought personally by
Dreverhaven's lawyer.

1083
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:13,040
Dear Jacob Willem...

1084
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:22,480
Of his houses, the bank...
his property.

1085
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:23,160
That's all.

1086
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:24,720
That's all!

1087
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:28,320
- You're becoming a Capitalist!
- You expected more?

1088
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:33,360
- Not from him.
- I wish you all the best.

1089
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,040
I say...

1090
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:40,000
"Estimated total value:
320,000 guilders...

1091
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:42,240
"Please contact
my lawyer soonest..."

1092
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:45,000
"Signed A.B. Dreverhaven,
bailiff."

1093
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:47,200
That's not what it says.

1094
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:59,280
"Please contact my deputy,
Mr Schuwagt,

1095
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:01,400
yours truly...

1096
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:08,960
"FATHER"!

1097
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:43,160
You have been watching
"Character"
