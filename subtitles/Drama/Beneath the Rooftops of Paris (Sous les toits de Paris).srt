2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,820
Bunny.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,930
How's Alex?

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:19,400
He's sleeping. The doctor said he should
stay in the hospital for a couple of days.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,660
He let the disease grow.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,420
By the way, isn't Kay with you?

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,900
I didn't see him.
Didn't you leave with him?

8
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,100
Kay.

9
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:54,570
The aura around you
is so depressingly gray.

10
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,970
It means there's something you're worrying about.

11
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,270
Am I right?

12
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,940
What?

13
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,640
Pick one.
Come on.

14
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,360
Fortune's wheel.

15
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,770
It means life altering, luck
or a fateful meeting.

16
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,590
Kay, did you get a girlfriend?

17
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,370
Shut up.

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,860
A fateful meeting?

19
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,730
I hate her so much.

20
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,440
She looks bad on the screen
because her skin is so bad.

21
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,890
Why does she take it out on me?

22
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,910
She's a chain smoker
and has a bad temper.

23
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,550
And she's foul-mouthed.
She swears a lot.

24
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,500
You shouldn't hear any swear words.
Your pretty ears will get dirty.

25
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,120
My eyes are about to get dirty.

26
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,920
What the heck is this?

27
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,620
You think I can even buy
gum with this money?

28
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,260
Don't play with me like this.
Prepare more money. Understand?

29
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,650
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,500
I'm sorry. Excuse me, can I get a bill?

31
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,530
How can she smile like
that in this situation?

32
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,040
I see. I should go see Alex later.

33
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,330
- Jin, take care of Alex's customers too.
- Okay. Don't worry.

34
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,470
- Why isn't Kay here yet?
- He must be late.

35
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,740
Bunny, take this.

36
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,870
Nail class?

37
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:42,490
Alex asked me for that. You should go there
and take the class 3 times a week. Good luck.

38
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,440
- Okay.
- Get to work, guys.

39
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,070
Why?
Are you impressed by Alex?

40
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,110
No.

41
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,050
You got a new haircut, Kay.

42
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,490
Yeah.

43
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,270
You look good.

44
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,210
What's wrong with him?

45
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:13,300
Just ask me why Pororo wears stupid glasses.

46
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,770
Why does he wear that?

47
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,170
Because he wants to.

48
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,890
Excuse me, can I sit here?

49
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,600
Sure.

50
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,010
- What's wrong?
- No. Nothing.

51
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,660
Nice to meet you.
I'm Jeong Mi Ae.

52
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,920
I'm Hong...

53
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,230
Just call me Bunny.

54
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:29,290
Now, you're going to practice with
someone who's sitting next you.

55
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,870
I'll do it first.

56
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,790
What's wrong?

57
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,250
Nothing.

58
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,930
Boss.

59
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,140
You brought a lot of stuff.

60
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,000
Comic books?

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,050
I thought he would be bored.

62
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,310
Bunny is better than me.

63
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,380
I'll leave you two alone.
I have to make a call.

64
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,160
Have a seat.

65
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,370
How's the class?
Do you like it?

66
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,670
Yeah.

67
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:44,290
Alex, do you remember Tae Hee?

68
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:52,060
You said you noticed Tae Hee got the blues
by seeing red lines on her nails or something.

69
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,950
Anyway, is that right?

70
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,650
Yeah. Why do you ask?

71
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,680
There's this girl that has
red lines on her nails.

72
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,140
But an interesting thing is that she doesn't
seem like a person with depression.

73
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:14,020
She always smiles like a robot.

74
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,180
Maybe she did become a robot.

75
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,390
What?

76
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,050
There are some people like her.

77
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,410
They have to smile everyday for
their job and it becomes a habit.

78
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,170
So even if they want to cry and be angry,
they just smile like a machine.

79
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,700
Bunny.

80
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,070
You're sharp.

81
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,840
Take care of her.
She might need some help.

82
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,040
Okay.
Don't worry.

83
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,500
You study so hard.

84
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,190
Are you not going to write
your novel anymore?

85
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:15,860
It's good to become a nail artist but think
about the people who are waiting for your novel.

86
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,400
Are you not meeting Jin tonight?

87
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,040
One of my co-workers told me
not to meet him too often.

88
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,140
Why not?

89
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,910
She said if I meet him too much,
he will get tired of me.

90
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,770
That doesn't make sense at all.

91
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,090
You're right.

92
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,590
Jin, it's me.

93
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,580
Why is she so happy?

94
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,820
- What are you doing?
- Stay still. I'm an expert, you know.

95
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:30,360
If a person has clean nails, she is
beloved by many people around her.

96
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,820
You're one of them.

97
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,300
Nice.

98
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,400
Give me a second.

99
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,040
What's that?

100
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,580
It's couple's nails.

101
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,250
I'll buy couple's rings for us.
Just wait.

102
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,880
How are you feeling?

103
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,010
Good.
Are you going somewhere?

104
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,090
Yeah.
It won't take long.

105
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,290
Do you love that man?

106
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,930
He can make you become a human,
but he might be a hunter.

107
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,210
Since you know how to assimilate with humans

108
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,480
you don't have to risk your life like this.

109
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:03,090
And that might put other
Gumihos into danger.

110
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,840
<i>I'm sorry.
Good bye.</i>

111
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,540
Let's go.

112
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,810
You're such a bad brat.
You made me stay up all night.

113
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,420
Hey, don't be sloppy!

114
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,290
What's wrong, Kay?
There are customers here.

115
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,900
Don't worry, Bunny.
Kay must be in a bad mood today.

116
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,700
Okay.

117
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,990
Smile.
Smile!

118
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,150
Stop.

119
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,500
- You're like a goldfish.
- Dude!

120
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,620
What's wrong with me?

121
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,550
Bye.

122
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,140
That man extorted you of your money,
didn't he?

123
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,540
You saw it?

124
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,350
Are you smiling?

125
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,550
Actually, I saw him at the
restaurant the other day.

126
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,630
You shouldn't be smiling like this now.

127
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,950
I'm sorry.

128
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,990
I've been working at a mall and
dealing with customers for a long time.

129
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,040
Smiling became my habit.

130
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,980
Look. Do you see these
red lines on your nail?

131
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,660
This means that you're depressed.

132
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:31,930
You might not feel it but your mind is
suffering because of that damn man.

133
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,010
You need to stay away from
that bastard right now.

134
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,120
If you can't do it, I'll help you.

135
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,840
Who is this little brat?

136
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,260
Don't contact Mi Ae every again.

137
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,650
Don't even come near her.

138
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,700
What is this load of bollocks?

139
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,070
You think she likes you because
she doesn't get mad at you?

140
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,730
Hey.

141
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:24,050
You don't know who you're messing with.

142
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,660
I'm done talking.
Bye.

143
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,350
Excuse me.
You can't do this here.

144
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,260
If you bother her one more
time, I'm not letting it go.

145
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,450
Don't forget.

146
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,590
Let's go.

147
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,090
You're so brave. Weren't you scared?

148
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:05,920
You should've called me.

149
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,110
Why?
So you could help me?

150
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,490
No. So I can tell Kay to help you.

151
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,180
Anyway, people like him should get punished.

152
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,180
Why does he exploit people like her?

153
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,610
I told you she's changed.

154
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,530
By the way, did you read a fan
fiction that our fans wrote?

155
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,540
A fan fiction?

156
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,940
It's so funny. You and I are dating
and Kay has a crush on you.

157
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,210
So it becomes a love triangle.

158
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,860
It's kind of erotic too.

159
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,610
Kay bullies me all the time.
That's not possible.

160
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:52,760
You know, if somebody likes you, they want
to bully you so they can get your attention.

161
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,730
It's like that.

162
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,960
Not possible.

163
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,470
You read this fan fiction, too?

164
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,490
Isn't it so funny?

165
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,900
Hey, Jin.

166
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:31,430
The way I treated Beanie...
was that weird?

167
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,820
Of course, it was.

168
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,770
What's the matter with you?
You acted like you have feelings for him.

169
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,540
Where is he now?

170
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,180
In the hospital.

171
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,930
What's wrong?

172
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,420
Does he really have feelings
for Bunny?

173
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,700
- Bunny.
- There you are.

174
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,980
Are you going somewhere?

175
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,900
He's about to get examined.
Have a seat while you wait.

176
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,440
Okay.

177
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,300
Are you not done yet?

178
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,690
Bunny, is everything okay?

179
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,810
What?
Yeah.

180
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,700
Why are you zoning out?

181
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:46,650
Jin, what's the relationship
between Boss and Alex?

182
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,010
Relationship?

183
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,830
Employer and employee.

184
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:54,810
No, no. How did they meet?

185
00:19:54,810 --> 00:20:00,360
I heard that when Alex was
wandering after he quit his job...

186
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,020
Boss was the one who led him
to become a nail artist.

187
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,620
So she was like his savior.

188
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,830
Come to think of it, everyone
here had hard times.

189
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,120
The same goes for me and Kay.

190
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,520
By the way, I'm going to Club with Ji Soo.
Do you want to come with us?

191
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,950
I'm not interested in that.

192
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,290
You're only interested in Alex,
aren't you?

193
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,470
You're a stalker.

194
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,100
Dude!

195
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,820
Didn't you go home yet?

196
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,730
No.
I left something here.

197
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,580
- Bye, Kay.
- Bye.

198
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,150
Why do I have to lie because
of Beanie?

199
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,010
Excuse me.

200
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,310
Is Bunny here?

201
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,190
I'm not going to worry about him.

202
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,520
<i>Beanie.</i>

203
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,800
Let go.

204
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,220
Where are we going?

205
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:22,160
Why? You turned on me in a fury
the other day. Do it again.

206
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,280
You think I can't do that?

207
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,200
Just wait there.

208
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,960
Guys, look at this brat.

209
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,950
Get him!

210
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,590
My phone.

211
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,820
There are you are, you little rat.

212
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,680
What are you doing here?

213
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,500
How are you feeling?

214
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,170
I'm okay.

215
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,340
What's wrong?
Are you worried about something?

216
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,630
You're not the type of guy who'd come
visit me just because you're worried.

217
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,070
- Kay.
- Yes?

218
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,030
Check my hand.

219
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,660
You said you know everything
if you check a hand.

220
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:50,260
Check if I'm crazy or mentally ill.

221
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,930
What the heck are you saying?

222
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,600
Jin.

223
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,130
What's up?

224
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,730
Kay, did you see Bunny?

225
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,390
Why are you asking me that?

226
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,010
You were the last
person at the salon.

227
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:16,920
Ji Soo wanted Bunny to join us so I called
him but he's not answering the phone.

228
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,200
Ask him if Bunny said where
he's going.

229
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,450
Kay, did he say where
he was going?

230
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:28,960
No. He was with this man...

231
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,080
Is Bunny here?

232
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,640
I have to go.

233
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,420
Kay.

234
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,110
You know a man with a
scar on his face, don't you?

235
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,700
Where's that bastard?

236
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,810
You little brat.

237
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,070
What do you care about the
business between me and Mi Ae?

238
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,310
Hey, do you really have
a crush on her?

239
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,960
- He looks like a girl.
- Why would two girls be together?

240
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,680
Yeah, he looks so pretty.
Why don't we strip him and check?

241
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,940
Let me go.
Stop!

242
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,910
You shouldn't have been rude to me.

243
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,360
What the hell?

244
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,800
- Kay.
- If you want to keep walking with two legs...

245
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,430
Bring my shoe back and
get out of here.

246
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,370
Look at that son of a bitch.

247
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,950
Go kill him.

248
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,600
Watch out.

249
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,610
Kay.

250
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,750
Bro, your arm is bleeding.

251
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,980
Don't you have a brain?

252
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,030
You don't know how to think?

253
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,110
Why did you follow him?
You don't even know how to fight.

254
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,090
Did you want to kill yourself
or something?

255
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:42,580
I didn't follow him. He forced me.
What was I supposed to do?

256
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,840
You are...

257
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,600
You should've taken your
phone with you.

258
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,450
I didn't have time for that.

259
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,770
Bunny.
Are you okay?

260
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:10,050
- Did you get hurt?
- Yeo... Ki Joo.

261
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,490
You must be so shocked.

262
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:21,840
If this happens one more time,
I'm not going to worry about it.

263
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,580
- Understand?
- What's wrong with you? He's shocked.

264
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,330
Damn bastard.

265
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,420
You made me so worried.

266
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,600
Are you Jeong Mi Ae?

267
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,370
I see.
Bunny must have been so scared.

268
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,520
- Is that all?
- Pardon?

269
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,530
I thought you would worry
about him more than that.

270
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,050
I feel so sorry.
He was in trouble because of me.

271
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:40,500
You can report it to the police or whatever.
It's not my business.

272
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,670
I have to leave now.

273
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,500
Are you okay?

274
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,650
- Yes.
- Is she a psycho by any chance?

275
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:54,110
I mean a psychopath.

276
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,570
She doesn't seem like one.

277
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:03,060
Kay, you think you can
find Hyung Shik again?

278
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,580
Why? Are you really
reporting him to the police?

279
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,950
No, I'm not.

280
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:14,690
Bunny, you said they've known
each other for a long time, right?

281
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,550
Yes. She told me she has
known him since high school.

282
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,990
He might know what her problem is.

283
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,250
What do you mean?

284
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,850
She doesn't feel emotions and she
suffers from severe migraines.

285
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,510
I think she has alexithymia.

286
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,420
Alexi...what?

287
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,170
Alexithymia.

288
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:45,750
It's like you can't feel
nor express your emotions.

289
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,180
Of course, it's impossible to
notice how other people feel.

290
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,870
Then what's going to happen to her?

291
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:57,260
It might lead her to premature dementia
in the worst case.

292
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,230
Isn't that a serious disease?

293
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:03,580
It might be because of a
congenital handicap.

294
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,010
But I think it's because
of some kind of trauma.

295
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:12,680
It's like her old wounds from the
past blocked her emotions.

296
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:17,750
So to cure her disease, we need
to dig up her old wounds.

297
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,950
Wouldn't Hyung Shik know
about something?

298
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,070
Park Hyung Shik.

299
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,740
Can I talk to you for a second?

300
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,950
What?
Trauma?

301
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:55,300
I'm too stupid to know what
that word means.

302
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,730
But I know that bitch isn't
a normal girl.

303
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,790
Do you know why she has
to pay money to me?

304
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,340
<i>Her classmates didn't talk to her since
she always looked depressed.</i>

305
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,940
<i>She ended up getting bullied.</i>

306
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,820
<i>I figured out that she was
raped by her stepfather.</i>

307
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,890
She was going to kill herself.

308
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:23,160
She was 16 years old at the time.

309
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,980
Since that incident,
she has been like that.

310
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:33,710
She doesn't get mad nor sad,
like a robot.

311
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,890
Well... after she got a job at the
mall, she smiles all the time.

312
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:45,620
But do you know why her smile
drives me nuts?

313
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:54,380
But you've been watching her because you
have feelings for her. Am I wrong?

314
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:01,570
I followed her to get money from
her because she owed me her life.

315
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,320
Let's go.

316
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,200
Thank you, anyway.

317
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,290
Hey.

318
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,440
I know I'm a hopeless man.

319
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,390
But please help that girl.

320
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:27,530
If you let her go, she might
try to kill herself again.

321
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:33,980
I never thought she had that kind of past.

322
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,000
What do we do now?

323
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
The best thing is get her to see a doctor.

324
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,710
But she needs to be able to
admit her problem first.

325
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:47,520
It won't be easy.

326
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,660
You have to use a little mysticism for this kind of problem.

327
00:33:53,660 --> 00:34:00,840
I mean I assume that people like
her are possessed by a ghost.

328
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,540
So she was probably possessed
by a furious ghost.

329
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,070
- You're talking nonsense again.
- No, I'm not.

330
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:17,980
The best cure for this is to use a
person with pure and honest energy.

331
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:24,170
The best treatment for her is a person
who has clear and fresh energy.

332
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:27,340
Whatever. Can you make us pork cutlet please?

333
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,290
Dude, it's real.

334
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,320
Hey, make one pork cutlet.

335
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,980
He might be right.

336
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,490
Don't say that.

337
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,640
I'm not sure about everything he said,

338
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:47,910
but a person's heart can be
healed by another person.

339
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:55,700
Bunny, you started this.
So you need to help her until the end.

340
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:00,040
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

341
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,100
Good job today.
I'll see you tomorrow.

342
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,080
- Bye.
- Bye.

343
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,400
Let's go.

344
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,450
You go ahead, Jin.

345
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,420
I'm going to go see Ji Soo.

346
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,820
Kay.

347
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,980
You walk so fast.

348
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,510
Your legs are short.

349
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,500
Thank you for what you did on that day.

350
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,360
I didn't get to say thank you so...

351
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,470
Is your arm okay now?

352
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,260
Why do you care?

353
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,230
How can I not care?
Your arm got hurt because of me.

354
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:08,440
- That's it?
- What?

355
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,640
Never mind.

356
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:20,310
You think I can help her?

357
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,920
I'm talking about Mi Ae.

358
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,820
I told the boss I can help her.

359
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:34,340
But I honestly don't know.
Maybe I should never have gotten involved.

360
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,560
There's no such thing as a single
right answer in the real world.

361
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:46,490
Pick anything and make that your answer.
Then that becomes the answer.

362
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,900
You're so cool, Kay.

363
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,200
I understand why you have fans.

364
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,100
Are you crazy?

365
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,240
Kay, where are you going?

366
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:16,790
<i>Diamond Nail</i>

367
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,940
Hello.

368
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,930
Bunny.

369
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,280
Are you okay now?

370
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,800
Yeah.

371
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,380
But did you really worry about me?

372
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,480
Well...

373
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,550
Do you want to go out on a date with me?

374
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,110
You're free on this weekend?

375
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,320
What?

376
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,460
You're mad, aren't you?
Don't you get mad?

377
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,490
I'm sorry.
I acted a little crazy, didn't I?

378
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:16,820
I wanted to see the real you,
not that smile today.

379
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,620
But it's not working.

380
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:29,120
Alex said you're sick now.

381
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,610
Because of the deep wound in your heart,

382
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,560
this thing that connects your
brain and heart is broken.

383
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,350
So you don't feel mad, happy, and sad.
You don't try to feel those emotions.

384
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:49,780
But I thought if I tried,
you would open your mind.

385
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:53,530
Maybe I was wrong.

386
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:02,560
Bunny, if you're done talking, can I go home?

387
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:06,070
I'm tired.

388
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,240
Sure.

389
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,760
Hey Bunny,
How did it go?

390
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,480
It didn't work at all.

391
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,650
Maybe I can't help her.

392
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:49,070
Don't be disappointed.
It's hard to cure that disease.

393
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:52,780
Is there really no way to fix her?

394
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,960
Come in.

395
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,940
Bunny, we could've practiced in class.

396
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,060
We should practice like it's for real.

397
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,080
Have a seat.

398
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,770
What is he trying to do?

399
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:25,440
He's trying to figure it out.
She's his first customer.

400
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:38,580
We're supposed to practice glue-on nails, right?

401
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,310
I'll begin.

402
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,160
Do you like this place?

403
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,120
I like it.

404
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,140
Do you know why this place is called Paris?

405
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:11,060
When I first started working
here, my boss told me why.

406
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,040
Just like the myth of Paris,

407
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:21,270
our goal is to comfort and
cure customers' wounds.

408
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:32,930
To help our customers, my co-workers
sometimes have to fight and get hurt.

409
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:39,140
They even get cursed at.

410
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:45,950
Seeing all that, I realized what
my boss was talking about.

411
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,360
So this time, I'm going to give it a shot.

412
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,490
You're my customer.

413
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:13,030
I don't have a mother.

414
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,910
On top of that, I was from the countryside.

415
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:26,300
So people made fun of me.
They even bullied me.

416
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,510
So as time went by and I got
older, I never left my house.

417
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,850
I got a job that I could do alone.

418
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,460
And I had only one friend, my roommate.

419
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:48,830
I thought I was happy at that time.

420
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:52,790
But I wasn't.

421
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:56,580
Because of other people,

422
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:01,010
Sometimes, I feel happy, sad...

423
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:05,870
mad, angry...

424
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:08,900
annoyed, disappointed...

425
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,280
and scared.

426
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,640
Without having those feelings,
I wasn't really living a life.

427
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:28,840
So I decided not to let
Mi Ae's life to be my old life.

428
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:32,860
Bunny.

429
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:40,060
I heard from Hyung Shik what had
happened to you in the past.

430
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,260
I understand why you closed your mind.

431
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:52,660
But I really want to teach you how
it is to feel those emotions.

432
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:59,450
Just like this, I'm never going to let you go.

433
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:12,890
So?
Do you like your the diamond glue-on nails?

434
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,190
Mi Ae...

435
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:29,830
What's wrong with me?

436
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:33,270
Your body does feel.

437
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:43,230
Even if your brain doesn't feel
anything, your body and heart can feel.

438
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:50,330
They feel hurt and sad.

439
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,540
Help me, Bunny.

440
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:00,980
What do I do now?

441
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:29,420
So what's she going to do?

442
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,640
I went to see a doctor with her and
got her admitted for treatment.

443
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,450
The doctor said it's not
an easy disease to cure.

444
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:40,470
But since Mi Ae has the will to get better,
she's going to be fine.

445
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:44,900
Wow!  You did a great job
with your first customer.

446
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,460
I guess so.

447
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:53,060
Anyways, congratulations for becoming a
member of our Paris family officially.

448
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,810
Hello.

449
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:06,630
Sure.
I'll go now.

450
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:08,630
Bye.

451
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:13,300
I'm sorry.
I have to leave now.

452
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,190
Who was it?
Your girlfriend?

453
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,520
Have fun, guys.

454
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:35,050
- I'm leaving too.
- Kay.

455
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,890
Kay!

456
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,490
What's wrong with them?

457
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:45,110
Bunny, how about we go to a club?

458
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:46,950
No.

459
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:51,390
Bunny, I couldn't even enjoy the club
last time because of you.

460
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:18,680
I knew it would be like this.

461
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,620
Where did she go?

462
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,970
Call her.

463
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,270
Yeo Joo, where are you?

464
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:45,610
- I'm going home.
- Why didn't you tell us?

465
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:49,040
You guy were having fun without me anyway.

466
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,690
Just have fun, guys.

467
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:53,800
Bye.

468
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,920
What's wrong with her?

469
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,060
Yeo Joo...

470
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:11,340
Jin!

471
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:16,170
- I didn't look! I swear!
- What?

472
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:20,180
Where am I anyway?

473
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,490
Should I get a taxi?

474
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,350
That car...

475
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:19,280
- What are you doing?
- What the heck?

476
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,530
Are you okay, Jin?

477
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:42,000
You're such a mess.

478
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,440
Why are you being so nice to me?

479
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,300
What's wrong Yeo Joo?
Are you crying?

480
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,120
Ji Soo, I'm so sad.

481
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,670
I'm so sad, Ji soo!
