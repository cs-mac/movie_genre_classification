What a splendid cake, my dear Keto!

22
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,680
Thank you.

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,331
Oh, God!
What a misfortune!

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,157
What happened, Apollon?

25
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,398
What a great man we have lost!

26
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,691
Oh, my God...
Oh, God!

27
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,317
Was he your relative?

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,072
More than a relative!

29
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,670
He was my closest friend.

30
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,678
Lucky you!

31
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,683
This is the end to my luck!
My dear Varlam is gone!

32
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,849
And still you're lucky
to have known such a man.

33
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,491
We'll never have a mayor
as good as he was.

34
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,917
I hope you do well in your studies?

35
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,771
What a man we have lost!
What a great loss!

36
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,920
What a painful word, 'death'!
What a painful word!

37
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,678
My condolences.

38
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,330
By the way,
why is he not buried in the pantheon?

39
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,168
He must have not wanted it himself?

40
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,831
Good for Varlam, he was known
for his modesty.

41
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,075
Thank you.

42
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,080
I commiserate with you over your loss.

43
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,157
Thank you, I appreciate it.

44
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,410
Varlam is not dead, no!

45
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,487
His soul is here, over us,
it's hovering in the air.

46
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,999
Tseretso is here.

47
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,315
Pull yourselves together!

48
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,010
Thank you very much, patron.
I appreciate it.

49
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,327
Hurray for our benefactor Tseretso!
Let's give him a round of applause!

50
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,078
Ladies and gentlemen!

51
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,717
In a few minutes

52
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,590
the parting bell will ring

53
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,928
and we'll commit to the earth

54
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,478
the remains of a great son of his
motherland, a man of a lofty soul,

55
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,079
a bright mind and a kind heart,

56
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,556
loved by everyone,

57
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,162
our highly esteemed
Varlam Aravidze.

58
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,170
I think many of you have taken
notice of the highly emotional

59
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,924
and wise inscription on the wreath
from the friends of the deceased.

60
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:02,084
“One dead man is sometimes better
than a thousand live ones.“

61
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,241
Our dear Varlam
had many virtues,

62
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,487
it's hard to enumerate them all.

63
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,160
He had an extraordinary gift

64
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,991
to turn his enemy into his friend,
and his friend into his enemy.

65
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,670
Indeed, this is a quality of the chosen!

66
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,686
A coffin, like a smorgasbord,

67
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,238
stands in a spacious vault.

68
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,159
And faces grow dim in a faded mirror.

69
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,231
But there's no death,

70
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,131
only a somersault
of sinful flesh

71
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,158
and agonizing fear.

72
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,768
May you rest in peace, indefatigable
toiler!

73
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,070
Rest in peace in your native earth.

74
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,330
He'll be gone, another'll come
into this blooming world.

75
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,999
Indeed.

76
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,400
Why didn't your sweetheart honor
the funeral with her presence?

77
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,677
Don't say nonsense.

78
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,486
Though everything went off well
even without her.

79
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,477
Shut up, will you?

80
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,081
My dear boy!
MY Poor orphan!

81
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,830
Poor Abel...

82
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,556
What's the matter with you?
Stop clowning, it's enough.

83
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,917
Why is this portrait here?

84
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,691
Allez-hop!

85
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,476
Why is he howling, damn it?

86
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,677
Don't get up, I'll go and look.

87
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,235
Abel!

88
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,410
What's the matter? What's wrong?

89
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,236
It's Varlam over there!
Don't go there, Abel!

90
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,910
Don't come near, Abel!

91
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,167
Abel!

92
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,477
- Varlam!
- What?

93
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,393
The corpse.

94
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,565
- Arrest him.
- Yes.

95
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,237
Who saw him first?

96
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,555
Guliko.

97
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,922
How are you, esteemed Guliko?
When did you see him first?

98
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,080
I woke up this morning and saw him,
poor thing, propped up against a tree.

99
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,671
- We'll have to arrest the deceased.
- What do you mean, to arrest?

100
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,076
We need it for the inquiry.

101
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,489
In an hour you'll have your dear
Varlam back safe and sound.

102
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,677
Go ahead, then.

103
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,317
But do it in gloves.

104
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,556
What times we're living in...
They arrested Varlam himself.

105
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,998
- Well?
- Have you been there?

106
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,157
- I have.
- And what?

107
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,170
They didn't receive me.

108
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,313
Someone had forestalled us.

109
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,830
My highly esteemed neighbor Abel!

110
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,770
Did you really hope
they would help you?

111
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,839
What else can I do?

112
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,690
- Why is he butting in?
- He's a fool.

113
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,473
Listen to my advice:

114
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,690
Put an iron cage on the grave,

115
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,396
with a lock on the door,
close it, just like that,

116
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,321
put the key in your pocket,
and that's it, let them dig then.

117
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,490
The lion's in the cage.
Let anyone try to touch him.

118
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,690
Even pharaohs never had
such pyramids.

119
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,076
Your group goes behind that grave!

120
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,238
Don't make a step without my command,
I'm in charge here!

121
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,318
And you move over here.

122
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:44,081
No smoking, no talking,
keep your eyes and ears open!

123
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,684
Take your positions!
Move!

124
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,331
Abel, the prefect himself
is overseeing the operation.

125
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,920
Yes, he's a warm-hearted man, he did
not abandon me in my time of misery.

126
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:11,250
Abel, do you see those brightly lit
windows beyond the cemetery?

127
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,921
- Yes, I do.
- My relative lives there.

128
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,671
When he learned that we'd be
at a stone's throw from his house,

129
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,009
he had prepared a royal feast.

130
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,071
He'll be offended
if we don't pay him a visit.

131
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,238
You want us to leave the grave?

132
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,230
No one will show up before midnight.
If anything, the guards will call us.

133
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,470
- I don't know. Ask the prefect.
- So you're for it? I'll be back.

134
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,010
- Philip. Meliton.
- Yes, sir!

135
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,690
Do you see that house,
with a big lamp in the window?

136
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,995
Yes, sir!

137
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,999
We're going there.

138
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,236
If anything happens,
call us right away. Is it clear?

139
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,919
Yes, sir!

140
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,002
- When did you give up drinking?
- Yesterday.

141
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,409
Yesterday? O Lord, may my friend
Philip's soul rest in peace.

142
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,407
Enough, or you'll drop dead!

143
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,400
Boring life is not worth living.

144
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,929
Drink, sleep off, and drink again!

145
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,394
Lucretius?

146
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,397
I beg your pardon, dear sir!
One can't do it here!

147
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,669
What a poet he was, eh?
The king of poets!

148
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,251
Halt! Don't move!
Or I'll fire!

149
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,329
I'm going to strangle you, bastard!

150
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,674
Let me go!
Let go of me!

151
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,395
So it's you who's desecrating
our grave, scoundrel?

152
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,240
Just let loose the dogs on him!

153
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,157
Good Lord, it's a woman!

154
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,398
Defendant Barateli!

155
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,090
During the preliminary investigation
you confessed that

156
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,763
you had thrice dug up the deceased
and carried him to the family's house.

157
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,082
Do you confirm that fact
and do you plead guilty?

158
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,158
I confirm the fact,
but I don't plead guilty.

159
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,488
But you did plead guilty during
the investigation.

160
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,328
It's a lie, I never pleaded guilty
during the investigation.

161
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,078
Is that your spade?

162
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,319
Yes, I dug up the deceased
with this spade.

163
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,082
But where's the bullet
which was extracted from my arm?

164
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,250
- So you did dig up the deceased?
- Yes.

165
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,990
That's what you're guilty of,
that's the fact of the crime.

166
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,070
Yes, I dug him up from the grave,
but I don't plead guilty.

167
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,395
Be seated.

168
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,327
Please, be seated
and observe the court order.

169
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,319
The trial has already taken place
and the verdict has been passed!

170
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,074
Sit down!

171
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,230
As long as I live Varlam Aravidze
will not rest in the ground.

172
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,475
This verdict is final,
without appeal.

173
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,003
For it was pronounced by Providence
to both of us: Aravidze and me.

174
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,691
I will dig him up three hundred
times, not just three!

175
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,250
Sit down!

176
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:52,399
Your Honour, the defendant is
agitated, it's only natural.

177
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,393
May I have the floor?

178
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,407
The counselor for defense may speak.

179
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,684
Your Honour, dear citizens!

180
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,082
Today we're dealing
with an unprecedented case.

181
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,764
The deceased had been thrice dug up
from his grave. Three times!

182
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,170
It is an indisputable fact that
the motive was not robbery:

183
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,489
The valuables buried with the deceased
had not been touched.

184
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,476
What was it then?
What was the motive of the crime?

185
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,684
I tried to talk to the defendant,
but she refused to speak.

186
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,000
Therefore, we'll have to conduct
both a hearing and an investigation,

187
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,248
and, certainly, pass the verdict,
right here.

188
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,648
That's why I ask this court
to listen carefully to the defendant.

189
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,155
The defendant may speak.

190
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,160
Of course, all of you wonder
why I'm persecuting the deceased.

191
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,250
It is the last thing I would want,

192
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,091
settling a score with a dead man.

193
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,396
Vengeance doesn't bring me any joy.

194
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,010
It's my misfortune.

195
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,677
My cross.

196
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,759
But there's no other way for me.

197
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,011
So, who is Varlam Aravidze?

198
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:52,232
I was eight years old
when he became our mayor.

199
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,604
Shortly before his death,
Einstein raised his voice

200
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:02,001
for the last time to tell the world
of the tragedy of a modern scientist.

201
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,837
This was his testament:

202
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,330
“The fate of a modern scientist
is tragic.

203
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,239
His inspiration leads him to clarity
and inner independence.

204
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,329
By almost superhuman efforts

205
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,490
he had forged a weapon
of his own social enslavement

206
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,916
and destruction of his personality.

207
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,009
The situation even reached a point

208
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,329
where the political authorities
had muzzled him.

209
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,677
Has the time really passed

210
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,316
when the scientist's intellectual
freedom and independent research

211
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,161
could enlighten
and enrich people's lives?

212
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,842
Has he forgotten, in his blind
quest for the scientific truth,

213
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,920
about his moral responsibility before
humanity and about his honour?

214
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,001
Our world is under threat of a crisis

215
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,751
the scope of which seems not to be
realized by those in authority...

216
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,318
The released power of the atom changed
everything but our way of thinking,

217
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:03,075
and thus we keep sliding down to
a catastrophe never seen heretofore.

218
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,991
For the mankind to survive, we have
to learn to think in a new way.

219
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,997
The most difficult task of our time
is to avert this threat.

220
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,474
At this decisive moment,

221
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,088
I'll be appealing to you
with all my feeble capacity.”

222
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,249
Our program “The world's great
thinkers: Albert Einstein“ is over.

223
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,090
Now listen to a concert of light
music.

224
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,394
The vibration has damaged
not only the frescos.

225
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,237
There are cracks
in the walls of the church.

226
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,000
If it goes on this way,

227
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,838
the church will collapse.

228
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,321
By the way,
the church stands on piles.

229
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,671
We ask you to immediately stop
laboratory experiments in the church

230
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,993
and put up as soon as possible
a new building

231
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,160
for the research institute.

232
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,478
You mean to say that you're against
science and progress?

233
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,919
We're against the science that
destroys ancient monuments.

234
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,349
Esteemed Varlam!

235
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,922
Only you, as the town's mayor,
can save that church.

236
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,680
We count on your help.

237
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,679
Doksopulo, what was that church
directive about?

238
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,247
It's about a dilapidated church.

239
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,922
- Who says it's dilapidated?
- It's almost ruined.

240
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,326
Almost. You hear that? Almost!

241
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,931
The building is almost ruined,

242
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,090
it's the nidus of infection.

243
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,250
There're snakes and lizards
breeding in its foundation.

244
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,750
No one attends your church anymore.

245
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,080
Long past are the times when people
were being told that God created man.

246
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,149
The fact that we all had descended
from a monkey was concealed.

247
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,329
That's why it's been decided to pull
the church down and on that place...

248
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,750
Wait, Doksopulo!

249
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,678
Esteemed Doksopulo!

250
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,677
The Church of the Mother of God

251
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,157
is one of the greatest monuments
of early Christianity.

252
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,678
A cultural monument!

253
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,837
Demolishing it means

254
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,407
cutting off the life-giving roots

255
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,844
that nourish and spiritually
enrich our people.

256
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,670
Then throw into fire
the works of Rustaveli and Dante!

257
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,316
Stop playing
Bach, Beethoven, Verdi!

258
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:18,399
Let's demolish the St. Peter Church,
Notre Dame, Svetitskhoveli...

259
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,315
Esteemed Varlam!

260
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,309
Our church used to have
some unique relics.

261
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,682
Through centuries our ancestors had
protected them up to this day.

262
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,091
But they've been lost without a trace.

263
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,112
Now the building is collapsing.

264
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,915
But we...

265
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,398
Doksopulo, give me the text of
my directive on the laboratory.

266
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,155
Look what's written here:

267
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,011
“L deem appropriate the construction
of a new building of the laboratory.

268
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,239
However, in view of lack of funds, we
should temporarily abstain from it.“

269
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,669
You see, we're concerned, too.

270
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,760
But it seems we can't put it off any
longer, you have convinced me.

271
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,478
Doksopulo!
Do you have a mother?

272
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,075
Yes.

273
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,569
- How old is she?
- Very old.

274
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,331
Aren't you supposed
to take care of her?

275
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,760
The same goes for that church,
the monument of the 6th century,

276
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,671
our pride and our history.

277
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,991
A son should never leave his sick
mother without care.

278
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,998
Remember it well.

279
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,681
We should be grateful
to these noble people

280
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,850
for opening up our eyes,
for telling us the truth.

281
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:55,069
I give you my word that I won't spare
any effort to solve this problem.

282
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:03,233
And the experiments, as far as I know,
are conducted at a minimal capacity.

283
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,330
It will go on this way
until the new building is erected.

284
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,672
If the high voltage installations
work at a full capacity,

285
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,009
not only the church, but the whole
town will blow up.

286
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,405
What did you say?

287
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,831
I'm destroying this document
in your presence.

288
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,679
You can go.

289
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,682
- What else can I do for you?
- That's all, thank you.

290
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,402
Then let's clarify
some biographical details.

291
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,929
The biographies of esteemed Miriam
and esteemed Mosse,

292
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:46,479
those representatives of blue blood,
are well known to me.

293
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,567
As for esteemed Sandro,
I'm interested in just one fact.

294
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,485
Dear Sandro!

295
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,397
Have you ever heard of
a Tarasi Taraskaneli?

296
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:04,570
Of course, I have. Tarasi Taraskaneli
is my great-great-grandfather.

297
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,475
It turns out we have a common
forefather.

298
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,850
I'm also a descendant of
Tarasi Taraskaneli.

299
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,327
- In what way?
- Yes, yes, I am.

300
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,490
But we'll talk about it later.
Now you'd better tell me this.

301
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,328
You live on the town square in
a two-story house, don't you?

302
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,491
During the ceremony a girl was
blowing soap-bubbles from the window.

303
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,404
Was that your apartment?

304
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,761
Yes.

305
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,011
I see everything, I notice everything.

306
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,069
So beware of me, be careful.

307
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,161
Though, this is no time for joking.
As a matter of fact, this is life.

308
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,684
Some blow soap-bubbles, others
prosecute the enemies of the people.

309
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,850
You artists
are burning with creativity.

310
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:05,160
Paupers are begging, murderers are
killing, whores, pardon, are whoring.

311
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,477
But is that normal?

312
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,837
Is that normal?!

313
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,440
This is how it used to be,
but it will never be this way again.

314
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,319
We'll turn our town into Paradise!

315
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,682
With your help, my dear people,
with your assistance.

316
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,077
The audience is over.

317
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,909
Perhaps Aravidze
doesn't know about it?

318
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,909
Why did they arrest those old people,
can you explain it?

319
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,475
Some spies!

320
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,237
They're not guilty of anything.

321
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,330
Of course, it's because of the church.

322
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,720
Calm down.

323
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,920
That's his revenge for having to tear
his directive.

324
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,672
I'll go to him, he must set the old
people free immediately,

325
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,837
or let him arrest me, too!

326
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,081
Calm down, dear Sandro.
What do you have to do with it?

327
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,318
I took them to Aravidze, I'm to blame
for their arrest, it's the church...

328
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,559
- It's not because of the church.
- Why, then?

329
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,159
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

330
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,088
Sandro, you must calm down.

331
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,919
I promise you, I'll do my best.

332
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,160
Varlam will look into it
and report to me.

333
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,489
What is there to look into? What?

334
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,690
It's not fair, Sandro.
What do you want from Aravidze?

335
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,837
He wasn't here...

336
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,928
Stop your ravings.

337
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,251
Go home and let me deal with it...

338
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,999
Yes, Varlam.

339
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:21,079
Varlam, we should use discretion
in such matters.

340
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,076
No. Yes. Of course.

341
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,251
Thank you. Goodbye.

342
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,928
You're a strange man, Sandro.

343
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,237
A real crank.

344
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,558
Varlam looked into it
and set them free.

345
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,690
What do you say now?

346
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,520
Mommy!

347
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,310
I don't know if Sandro Barateli can
be compared to the great Botticelli,

348
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,762
but I know that Nino Barateli looks
like Botticelli's heavenly Madonnas.

349
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,680
I hope I didn't scare you,
lovely Nino?

350
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,009
One kisses hands
of common mortals,

351
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,568
as for goddesses and saints,
one ought to bow down to them.

352
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:57,071
Dear Nino,
I've heard so much about you,

353
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,672
about the artist Sandro Barateli
and his beautiful wife.

354
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,089
I have dreamed of meeting you
and seeing your pictures.

355
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,079
But Mikhail and Yelena
kept me waiting...

356
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,079
That's slander, esteemed Varlam.

357
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,250
It's you who is constantly busy,
especially lately.

358
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:22,244
Dear Sandro, I'd like to apologize
for my zealous assistants.

359
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:27,766
I'm glad you so timely stood up
for the unfairly punished old people.

360
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,919
- How long had they been there?
- For 24 hours.

361
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:36,570
- Poor things must have been scared?
- Not much, they're not easily scared.

362
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,243
Well, they're the old guard, right?
Esteemed Mosse, beautiful Miriam.

363
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,570
And this is the most important member
of the family, Keti Barateli.

364
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,478
Dear Keti!

365
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,280
Dear Keti, please!

366
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,314
Thank you.

367
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,997
Keti, take Abel
to your room to play.

368
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,309
Sandro has already met
our esteemed Kaiosro Doksopulo.

369
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,160
As for Geno Rictafelov...

370
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,920
his name sounds like rictafela,
a children's game of tagging.

371
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:27,090
It's a piece of wood
to tap a stick with.

372
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,160
Anyway, both of my companions
are first-rate singers.

373
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,327
Bravo!

374
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,475
That's a talent, too,
my dear hostess.

375
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,484
Forgive us for being a little tipsy,

376
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,476
we talk too much, we sing,
we even stumble a bit.

377
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,087
We won't bother you for long.

378
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,075
Sandro!

379
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,000
Any of your works can do credit
to the world's finest museums.

380
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,689
Excuse me, Nino.

381
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,566
That's the kind of painting we need:

382
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,556
Serious, thoughtful, profound.

383
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,250
Dear Sandro!

384
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,247
Is it really impossible

385
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,909
that our contemporaries would have

386
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:01,684
such spiritually inspired faces,

387
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,160
instead of the stereotyped, soulless
physiognomies, all looking alike?

388
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:12,561
Why can't we paint
a toiling woman as a Madonna?

389
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,318
What could be more beautiful than
a working person? Nothing!

390
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,491
Although you'll have a lot of
antagonists, isn't it so, Yelena?

391
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,677
Of course, it's absolutely true.

392
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,850
They will say:
“What do we need this art for?

393
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,330
This is just chamber art,
fit for a boudoir.

394
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,327
In fact, it's escapism.“

395
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,678
And I would say to them:

396
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,486
“Sometimes escapism

397
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,690
means plunging
into the greater reality.

398
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,670
Our people need
the great reality.“

399
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,571
Though, do you know how
our enemies may interpret it?

400
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:59,672
As a call to anarchy.
Yes, yes, to all-out anarchy.

401
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,919
And who is this?

402
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,161
Very good, Sandro, very good!

403
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:18,073
And here's our Nino.
Splendid work!

404
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,328
It would be interesting to look into
their brains. What's going on there?

405
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,679
Dear Sandro,
at least they're literate.

406
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:55,330
And what ignoramuses I have to deal
with in my line of duty!

407
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,080
- Isn't that true, dear Yelena?
- Absolutely true.

408
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,763
Today we need to have beside us
the artists exactly like you.

409
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:07,239
You have a great mission.

410
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:12,328
We must enlighten the people,
elevate their cultural level.

411
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,405
Dear Varlam!

412
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,916
Do you think that I, with my paintings,

413
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,397
or you, by your efforts,

414
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:26,762
can enlighten the people that had
created “The Knight in a Tiger's Skin“?

415
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:33,310
The people can be enlightened
only by a spiritual pastor.

416
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,247
A moral hero.

417
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,929
Modesty is a virtue.

418
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:56,162
You're right, Sandro,
I'm not a spiritual pastor.

419
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,843
But have a little patience,
do not hasten us.

420
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,407
Give us some time.
A hero is born by his time.

421
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:15,003
Perhaps the time of trial will come
soon, both for you and me.

422
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,155
What was Christ tortured for?

423
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,250
He was tortured for the truth.

424
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,922
Don't be afraid, Christ isn't dead.

425
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,478
He rose from the dead and flew to
the sky, like a bird. He's in the sky.

426
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,920
There're only kind people there.
Evil people cannot get there.

427
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,091
- Why not?
- The evil ones are heavy.

428
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,435
- Why are they heavy?
- You don't know? Because of sins.

429
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:54,682
And a kind person's soul is pure and
light as a bird, it can easily fly.

430
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,922
- How do you know it?
- My mother told me.

431
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,487
You know, this is a miracle-working
crucifix.

432
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,920
If you ask it for something before
going to sleep or during the new moon,

433
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,168
everything will come true.

434
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,157
- Everything?
- Yes, everything.

435
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,677
Really? Everything will come true?

436
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,678
Everything!

437
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,008
Can it revive my mother?

438
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,006
You have no mother?

439
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,488
Your mother loves you.

440
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:50,320
She's alive, she's in Heaven, with
angels, and she's looking at you.

441
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,080
She's thinking about you.

442
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,330
- Nino, come here for a minute!
- Coming!

443
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,609
Bravo!

444
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,078
We have to go,
it's time for the child to go to bed.

445
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,486
Abel!

446
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,315
Abel!

447
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:53,242
I'm going to ask your dad to let you
stay here for a while.

448
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,236
Uncle Varlam, may Abel
stay for a minute?

449
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,330
- For a minute, he may.
- Thank you.

450
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,678
But only for one minute.

451
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,088
Esteemed Varlam, will you sing again?

452
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,408
Sing something else, please.

453
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,472
Don't refuse, please, dear Varlam!

454
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,477
With great pleasure.

455
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,844
Tired with all these,
for restful death I cry,

456
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:46,671
As, to behold desert a beggar born,

457
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,475
And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,

458
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:56,160
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,

459
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:02,489
And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,

460
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,475
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,

461
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:12,991
And right perfection wrongfully
disgraced,

462
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:18,845
And strength by limping sway disabled,

463
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,753
And art made tongue-tied by authority,

464
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:34,673
And folly, doctor-like, controlling
skill,

465
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,160
And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,

466
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,673
And captive good attending captain
ill.

467
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:52,167
William Shakespeare. Sonnet 66.

468
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,999
A regimen is a regimen.

469
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,476
Abel, allez-hop!

470
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,078
I'll come to see you again.

471
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,671
Mommy, he galloped off!

472
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,912
A comedian. A clown.

473
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,007
Excuse me, Nino, it's me again.

474
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:53,561
My silly boy took your crucifix.
He says Keti gave it to him.

475
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,310
He believes this thing will revive
his mommy. I'm glad I noticed it.

476
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:00,077
Take care of it, this is a very
valuable thing.

477
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,245
Lovely Nino.

478
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,476
Will you include me in the list
of your admirers?

479
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,473
Please!

480
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,246
Sandro!

481
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,691
- What is it?
- I saw an awful dream, Sandro.

482
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:24,470
Let's leave this town,
let's go to some faraway place.

483
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,998
As far from here as possible.

484
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,762
If they want to,
they'll find us wherever we are.

485
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:46,072
Oh God! That was exactly my dream!
What are we going to do?

486
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:50,672
Nino, you remind me of the hare
that is running like mad.

487
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,997
“Where are you running?“ he's asked.

488
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,317
“They're hunting the wolves, “ he says.

489
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,238
“What do you have to do with it?“

490
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,410
“If they catch me, I'll never prove
I'm not a wolf.“

491
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,476
My little Wimp!

492
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,480
Sandro, that's them. Sandro...

493
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,928
I'm sure that's them!

494
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,911
Peace onto this house.
Are you Sandro Barateli?

495
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,155
Yes.

496
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,000
You'll have to come with us.

497
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,554
As you wish.

498
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,678
Hello, esteemed Mikhail.

499
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,850
On what grounds did you arrest
Sandro Barateli yesterday?

500
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,759
What is this?

501
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,484
Read it.

502
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,396
“The daub of some so-called painters
has lately taken on

503
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,557
the characteristics of individualism.

504
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,407
That conceited hooligan of an artist...

505
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,486
He is connected to anarchist poets.

506
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:30,078
The other day, in a circle of his
fellow artists he publicly threatened

507
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:33,079
to cut off, with his grandfather's
dagger, the arm of anyone

508
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:36,079
who would dare to even touch
the Church of the Mother of God.

509
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,250
We wonder who is patronizing

510
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:48,071
this maniac by organizing
his personal exhibitions?

511
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:52,991
The art of anarchist Barateli
is a disgrace to our culture.

512
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:56,477
It is dangerous for our society.

513
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:01,844
If you don't deal with
this shady character,

514
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,475
we will appeal to the appropriate
organs!

515
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,404
A group of artists.“

516
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:13,690
And this letter was the reason
for Barateli's arrest?

517
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,771
I'm asking you.

518
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:25,318
You arrested him because of that
rubbish, that filth?

519
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,249
The nation's real enemies are those
who wrote this.

520
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:39,476
They simply ran amok.
It's outrageous!

521
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,477
Barateli is my friend.

522
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:47,156
Moreover, he is my pupil,
and I'm proud of him.

523
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:51,749
You mean to say that my friend...

524
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:55,410
and my pupil is an enemy?

525
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:01,691
I understand, but this is not
an argument for the letter's authors.

526
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,669
Maybe the artist's talent isn't
a strong argument for them either?

527
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,921
They have in mind his stand.

528
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:16,169
What are you talking about? Talent is
kindness, and that's already a stand!

529
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,999
I understand that Sandro Barateli
is your friend and pupil.

530
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,330
By the way, do you know
that he's my relative?

531
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:34,171
No... I didn't know that.

532
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,489
Even a close relative.

533
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,090
Write a protest,
esteemed Mikhail.

534
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,091
Barateli is arrested, but he's not
convicted.

535
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:49,469
I was just executing the people's will,
masses stand behind that letter.

536
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,690
And each word coming from the masses
is the holy of holies for me.

537
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,691
Write a protest,
esteemed Mikhail.

538
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,314
To write a protest?

539
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,921
Yes, I have nothing against it.

540
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:04,069
Wait, wait... What do you mean,
“nothing against it“?

541
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,830
What can you possibly have against
the truth?

542
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,091
The truth? Nothing.

543
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,681
Well, I'll write it!

544
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,669
Go ahead, write it. But take
that letter into account, too.

545
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:22,230
What does that letter, that filth
have to do with it?

546
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,158
That provocation?!

547
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,829
Not a provocation, but a document
registered in thousands of places.

548
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,010
- I don't care where it's registered.
- You're wrong, esteemed Mikhail.

549
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:37,558
It's my duty to take the position of
the majority, for the majority decides.

550
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,242
What majority?
What are you talking about?

551
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,763
One man of reason outweighs
a thousand idiots.

552
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,485
I understand that you're talking
about me.

553
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:56,251
Stand up for him. Defending one
person is not such a big deal.

554
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,249
But remember, as the letter's authors
see it, you're protecting the enemy.

555
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:06,671
Yes, your friend and my relative
is our enemy now.

556
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,079
And we are his victims.

557
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,678
Who is the enemy?

558
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,409
Who is the enemy?!

559
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,483
Children go ahead of the line,
children ahead of the line.

560
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,238
Let us through, let us through.

561
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,157
Children ahead of the line!

562
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:46,394
- Baakashvili.
- Your document.

563
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,325
The parcel is accepted.

564
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,930
Koreli, Elizbar.

565
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,155
Exiled without right of correspondence.

566
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:11,673
Where was he exiled to? Where?
To what place?

567
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:16,410
You'd better tell me he is not alive,
that he's dead.

568
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,685
Stop torturing us!
Say that he's dead...

569
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,405
The parcel is accepted.

570
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,394
Barateli.

571
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,680
Exiled without right of correspondence.

572
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,757
My dear, you can't go there.

573
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,691
Mikhail Korisheli has been arrested.

574
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,554
Go away
before you get in trouble, too.

575
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,079
Esteemed Varlam!

576
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:51,561
Help us, help us, please!

577
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,557
Sandro is perishing.

578
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,670
Save him!

579
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,069
I beg you, esteemed Varlam!

580
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,928
Help us, esteemed Varlam!

581
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:42,196
Aunt Nino,
they brought logs to the station.

582
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,489
People say there're the names

583
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,326
and addresses of the exiled on them.

584
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:55,318
Perhaps Uncle Sandro
has written his name, too.

585
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,677
My mother sent me to you.

586
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:07,081
Keti, get up!
Hurry up. “it's 9°-

587
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,169
Amiran Abashidze

588
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,407
I've found it.

589
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,241
I've found him, mother! Mother!

590
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:58,070
Sit down in the chair.
Would you like to smoke?

591
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,319
Thank you, I don't smoke.

592
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:08,751
Believe me, your sincere confession
will help to alleviate your lot.

593
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:14,161
The leader of the secret organization,
Mikhail Korisheli himself,

594
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:18,331
named you as one of
its active members.

595
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,682
It's immoral to slander
an honest man

596
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,406
in order to extract false evidence.

597
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:28,686
Anything that is useful
for the common cause is moral.

598
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:34,672
What good can the prosecution of
the innocent do the common cause?

599
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:40,490
There's irrefutable proof that each
“innocent“ is an enemy of the nation.

600
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,074
Like myself.

601
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,834
You don't believe me?

602
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,360
How can I believe you

603
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:49,406
when I myself was arrested on no
grounds at all, for nothing.

604
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:52,007
And now you try to resort to any means

605
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,571
to make me sign
a false testimony.

606
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,678
False?

607
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:03,316
And if we confront you
with Mikhail Korisheli,

608
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,477
what would you say then?

609
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:10,925
Nobody will ever convince me
that Mikhail Korisheli is an enemy.

610
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,851
If such honest people
are being arrested,

611
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,088
then you have to arrest the whole
country.

612
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,989
Bring in Mikhail Korisheli.

613
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,486
Is it true that you were a Pontoss
spy?

614
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,155
Yes.

615
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,770
What was your mission as an agent?

616
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,409
I was to dig a tunnel
from Bombay to London.

617
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:07,169
Who helped you?

618
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,842
- The entire group of conspirators.
- Namely?

619
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,090
- How many people?
- 2,700.

620
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,087
You don't remember the names,
of course?

621
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:25,000
There's a list of the conspirators.
I think you can easily find it.

622
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:28,569
In what acts of sabotage
were you engaged?

623
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:36,081
To exterminate the population,
we had poisoned corn sown.

624
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:40,995
Was Sandro Barateli
a member of your organization?

625
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,920
Yes, he was.

626
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,677
You two can talk.

627
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:53,080
I'll leave you alone for a while and
be back after I see to my business.

628
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,758
Listen, Sandro.

629
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:41,829
I thought a lot.
I was thinking all nights through.

630
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:48,921
We must name as many people as
possible as the nation's enemies.

631
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,762
They can't arrest them all.

632
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:55,681
And when the number of the accused
reaches an astronomical figure,

633
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:00,912
those at the top will think twice,
convene an extraordinary assembly

634
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,677
and expose all the criminals

635
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:08,557
that have misled the government.
Do you understand, Sandro?

636
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,671
This is tactics.

637
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,396
A cunning, crafty tactics.

638
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:25,922
We'll sign everything, we'll bring it
to absurdity, to absolute nonsense.

639
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,555
We'll make thousands of absurd
statements.

640
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:33,241
The tunnel from Bombay
to London, and so on.

641
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,568
Eventually, the government
will understand everything.

642
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:36,989
It will become indignant,

643
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:42,479
get, with its iron hand,
at the throat of the villains

644
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,918
and destroy them.

645
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:57,675
I've been suggested all this
by the wisdom of imagination.

646
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,690
Do you understand me, Sandro?

647
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:07,171
We should trust no one,

648
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:13,310
no one's deeds or words!

649
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:20,170
We must be vigilant
and know how to detect an enemy.

650
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:24,088
That's our paramount task. And not
an easy one, ladies and gentlemen!

651
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:29,171
Even more complicated, because out of
every three people, four are enemies.

652
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:34,913
Don't be surprised! Quantitatively,
one enemy is more than one friend.

653
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:39,683
It's always been so.

654
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,677
And it's so today.

655
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:48,233
Our Motherland is in danger,
ladies and gentlemen!

656
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:55,481
Let our people
become like a tight fist,

657
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,487
like the Great Wall of China

658
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:02,396
the enemy would be powerless
to surmount.

659
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,487
It would also be appropriate
to recall a Chinese wisdom.

660
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,404
Confucius said:

661
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:12,082
“It is hard to catch a black cat
in a dark room.

662
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,237
Especially if there is no cat.“

663
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:19,170
No doubt, we're confronted
with a most difficult task.

664
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:24,330
But there're no barriers we can't
overcome.

665
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:28,077
If we want it very much...

666
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:33,832
we will catch a cat
in a dark room.

667
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:38,841
Even if there is no cat.

668
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,120
Nino!

669
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:55,919
I'm glad you came.
What's the news?

670
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:00,077
Wait, I'll find out everything.

671
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,157
3-17, please.

672
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:08,679
Nika, it's me.
Nino is here.

673
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,235
Any news about our men?

674
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:17,249
Yes, I see. All right.

675
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:22,488
Everything will be the way we want it
to be.

676
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:27,317
Of course, the arrest of Sandro and
Mikhail is a mistake.

677
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:32,309
We must summon up patience,
both you and I.

678
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:36,764
You'll see, Nika will do everything.
They'll look into it and free them.

679
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,079
You must be strong, Nino.

680
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,751
Don't forget that you have Keti.
You're responsible for her.

681
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:47,318
I'm sure it will end well,
everything will be all right.

682
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,490
They're bound to find the truth
and set Sandro free.

683
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,075
I'm sure of it!

684
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,760
Nino, I'm thinking now
of your girl.

685
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:00,088
Keti must become a good citizen
and an honorable woman.

686
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:03,318
Your misfortune must not
lead her astray.

687
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:05,318
Don't forget

688
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,929
that we're serving a great cause.

689
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:12,930
The future generations
will be proud of us.

690
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:20,844
But since the scale of events is so
grand, big mistakes are inevitable.

691
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,680
It may even happen that
innocent people are victimized.

692
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:27,089
But I can already hear our favorite
“Ode to Joy“ by Beethoven

693
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:30,318
which will surely sound all over
the world very soon.

694
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:30,839
What happened, mommy?

695
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,077
We have lost our father...

696
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,687
What?

697
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:45,315
They have blown up the church.

698
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:40,489
What's the use of knocking? There is
no one there. Yelena was arrested.

699
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,928
Don't you see that the apartment
is sealed up?

700
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,326
Yes, I got it.

701
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:55,040
I see.

702
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,759
I've brought them, esteemed Varlam.

703
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:01,486
Yes, certainly.

704
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:07,476
Yes... Goodbye.

705
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:19,074
Whom have you brought?

706
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:24,078
Those Darbaisseli.
I've carried out your directive.

707
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:26,158
Which Darbaisseli?

708
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,916
That you instructed me to bring.

709
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,671
I instructed you? Are you crazy?

710
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:36,850
Esteemed Varlam,
you told me to find

711
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,680
and bring everyone by the name
Darbaisseli.

712
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:42,691
Where are they?

713
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:48,079
In a truck.

714
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,555
Let them go home at once.

715
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:21,487
I thought you'd thank me.
I brought you a truck full of enemies.

716
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,157
And you, instead of gratitude...

717
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:29,832
For tracking down just one spy,
Rictafelov got a flat and a raise.

718
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:33,315
Why are some people so lucky?!

719
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:36,008
Do as I say.

720
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:40,330
Or you'll get behind the bars
instead of them.

721
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:43,087
Let them go home now!

722
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:44,566
Esteemed Varlam!

723
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,316
Have I done all that work in vain?

724
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:52,397
I've been chasing these damn people
for a month, I got them all together.

725
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:56,475
Let's lock them up in a cellar,
they may come in handy tomorrow.

726
01:38:56,720 --> 01:39:00,156
Go apologize to these people,
and set them free.

727
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:04,521
Then come back, sit at that table
and write...

728
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:06,074
At that table?

729
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:15,831
And write your resignation.

730
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,677
But you know that I'm illiterate.

731
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,678
Get out!

732
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:44,670
Don't let Doksopulo leave.
And you come in here.

733
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,848
Can you explain what it all means?

734
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:36,753
Doksopulo dear, please, go in.

735
01:40:55,520 --> 01:41:00,549
All right, the hell with you and with
them! Arrest them all.

736
01:41:03,281 --> 01:41:06,558
Thank you, esteemed Varlam!

737
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:33,797
Don't be afraid
and listen carefully.

738
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:38,555
Tonight they will come for you.

739
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:45,831
Here's some money and train tickets.

740
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:49,238
Hurry up, you may still manage
to save yourselves.

741
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,238
Mommy, who was that woman?

742
01:42:09,521 --> 01:42:12,252
Keti, get ready, quick.
We have to leave!

743
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:15,330
- Where are we going?
- To the country.

744
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:16,835
To the country?

745
01:42:19,441 --> 01:42:22,411
Yes, to the country. Hurry!

746
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:29,008
- Will we be back soon?
- Yes.

747
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:39,082
Peace onto this house.
Are you Nino Barateli?

748
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,475
Yes.

749
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,397
Keep your hands off! Let her go!

750
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:28,571
Mommy! Mommy!

751
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:30,751
Keti, don't be afraid!

752
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,159
Mommy!

753
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:53,490
Nino Barateli bid farewell
to her past.

754
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,124
That's the end of my story.

755
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:08,679
On behalf of everyone

756
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:13,672
who was unjustly punished,
I demand

757
01:44:15,601 --> 01:44:17,319
that Varlam Aravidze

758
01:44:18,161 --> 01:44:22,485
be dug up from his grave
by his own relatives.

759
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:25,484
I protest!

760
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:30,568
All you've heard here
is a lie and slander!

761
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:37,569
Slander?
Prove that it's a slander!

762
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:40,810
You mean that the deceased should
not be buried?

763
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,923
No, you must not bury him!

764
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:49,089
Burying him means forgiving him,

765
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:52,079
shutting our eyes to everything
he had perpetrated.

766
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:55,319
I publicly declare once again:

767
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:58,830
If you don't dig him up,

768
01:44:59,121 --> 01:45:03,672
I will get him,
I will not leave him in peace!

769
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:06,850
She's crazy, ladies and gentlemen,
she's absolutely crazy!

770
01:45:07,441 --> 01:45:13,153
She doesn't deserve a trial. She's
insane, she can do anything, bitch!

771
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,678
Leave the court immediately!

772
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:20,410
Leave it? And you sit here, gaping
and listening to that fool!

773
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:25,083
We haven't come here from the moon,
either. We're not idiots!

774
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:32,770
Any questions to the defendant?

775
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:38,671
Then this court is adjourned
for today.

776
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:56,843
No one is without sin, my boy.
We all were born in sin.

777
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:06,003
Help me, Tornike.
The sun is rising! The sun!

778
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:09,997
Don't be afraid, Grandpa. It's dark
in here, you can't see anything.

779
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:13,837
There, a ray! Do you see it?

780
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:19,684
What does it want from me?
Why is it pestering me?

781
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:25,071
Let's black it out,
or else I'll bleed up.

782
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:28,087
Why will you bleed up, Grandpa?

783
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:33,756
Look at my fingers.
Do you see blood trickling down?

784
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:39,475
When the sun rises,
I start bleeding.

785
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:45,470
Let's black the light out, quick,
or I'll lose all my blood.

786
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:49,078
Stop it, Grandpa!
Stop it now and calm down!

787
01:46:52,721 --> 01:46:54,485
Why are you pestering me?

788
01:46:57,521 --> 01:46:59,080
Why are you prying into my soul?

789
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:02,759
Why all this soul-searching?

790
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:07,070
I'll have you put out in a moment!

791
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:12,491
I'll have you extinguished!

792
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:56,484
You see? I've blacked it out.

793
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:09,397
It went completely out.

794
01:48:22,321 --> 01:48:23,846
Grandpa is dead!

795
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:26,915
Mother!

796
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:34,248
Mother! Grandpa has died!

797
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:45,241
Dear Guliko, I'm sorry
I have to leave you.

798
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:49,841
They say my father was a bad man,
I'm going to dig him up!

799
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:53,157
Did you know about all this?

800
01:49:57,041 --> 01:49:58,691
About what?

801
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:02,088
About Grandpa.

802
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:05,669
Your grandfather did nothing wrong.

803
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:12,751
That was a very complicated time.
It's difficult to explain it now.

804
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:17,837
What time has to do with it?

805
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,479
A lot!

806
01:50:25,201 --> 01:50:27,329
The situation was different.

807
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:30,749
The question was to be or not to be.

808
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:34,569
We were surrounded by enemies.
They were fighting against us.

809
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:38,556
You want to say that we were supposed
to pat the enemies on the back?

810
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:41,077
But Barateli wasn't an enemy.

811
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:43,246
He was.

812
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:48,476
He may have been a good artist,
but he didn't understand many things.

813
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:51,680
I don't mean to say
that we made no mistakes.

814
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:57,069
But what is the life of one man when
the happiness of millions is at stake?

815
01:50:57,880 --> 01:50:59,837
We were confronted with great tasks.

816
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:03,249
One should remember this
and be more broad-minded.

817
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:09,997
You measured human lives
arithmetically.

818
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:12,600
The most important thing was
to keep it in proportion, right?

819
01:51:13,521 --> 01:51:15,751
Spare me your irony, smart guy!

820
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:20,487
You're old enough to know that
for a public servant, public interests

821
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:23,087
should always be above personal
considerations.

822
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:27,236
Yes, above personal considerations!

823
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:35,691
Man is born a human being,
he becomes a public figure later.

824
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:43,241
You have your head up in the clouds,
but reality is different.

825
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:47,670
Varlam was always guided by
the interests of society.

826
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:53,912
But sometimes he had to act
against his will.

827
01:51:56,360 --> 01:52:00,149
And if he were ordered to destroy
the world, would he have done it?

828
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:04,439
You know what?

829
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:09,070
Your grandfather never killed anyone
with his own hands!

830
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:13,475
And you did fire at a human being!
What kind of morals you're talking of?

831
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:18,770
I didn't know who I was firing at.

832
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:21,930
What difference does it make?
You did fire at a human!

833
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:27,469
Yes, I did...
And it makes our guilt even worse.

834
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:30,087
- Whose guilt?
- Grandfather's, mine, and yours.

835
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:32,078
What do you blame me for?

836
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:36,251
Forjustifying grandfather
and for following in his steps.

837
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:41,090
You're a worse murderer than me,
because you don't pity that woman.

838
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:43,317
Why should I pity her? Are you out
of your mind?

839
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:46,160
You'd rather strangle her
than ask her forgiveness.

840
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:48,841
I couldn't imagine that you were such
an idiot!

841
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:56,681
She digs up my father from his grave,
and I'm supposed to apologize?

842
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:00,169
Yes, I will strangle her, and you too,
if you don't come to your senses.

843
01:53:00,721 --> 01:53:02,849
I shall not let her desecrate
the deceased!

844
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:06,074
I hate you.

845
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:09,669
I hate you!

846
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:19,924
No one is without sin...
We all are born in sin...

847
01:53:21,521 --> 01:53:24,195
A young man's psyche is very
unstable.

848
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:28,681
Depression, insomnia,

849
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:31,678
the disruption of the daily routine...

850
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:37,569
Even a grown-up would get depressed
seeing a dead man every day.

851
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:40,491
He needs rest. This medicine

852
01:53:41,041 --> 01:53:43,237
should be given to him three times
daily.

853
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:45,750
Tornike is a strong boy,
don't fear for him.

854
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:51,149
A state of shock normally doesn't
last long.

855
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:56,911
I think tomorrow he will already
come into contact with you.

856
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:27,249
Of course, the court will pass
some sentence.

857
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:32,683
But what am I to do?
Keep burying my father every day?

858
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:35,557
She will get what she deserves.

859
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:40,084
Come on, they won't give her as much
as a year. She'll get off with a fine.

860
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:43,410
What do you mean? Pay a fine,
and you're immediately released?

861
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:45,678
Oh God, the laws we have!

862
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:48,407
We're being planted a dead man,

863
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:52,571
and the culprit is not put in jail.

864
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:59,674
Abel, if I see the dug-up Varlam
once more, I'll go mad.

865
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:01,406
I'm sure I will!

866
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:04,069
Listen, old chap.

867
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:09,477
I'll send my boys after her
and she'll become as meek as a lamb.

868
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:11,245
No, it won't work.

869
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:17,079
Worse luck for her, I'll stick her
like a pig right on Varlam's grave.

870
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:19,246
Come on, cut it out...

871
01:56:19,441 --> 01:56:23,992
Abel, there's a limit to everything,
you have to make up your mind.

872
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:27,602
Don't you understand
that I'm losing my son!

873
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:33,000
He almost went crazy when his grand-
father died, and now another murder?

874
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:37,321
Don't use our son as an excuse.
My boy is not a coward.

875
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:40,672
He was the first to attack
that slut with a rifle!

876
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:44,671
I understand you, Abel,
you're protecting your son.

877
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:48,157
But one day he will ask you
why you did nothing at all

878
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:51,069
when his grandfather was dug up from
the grave.

879
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:54,919
If you make a mistake now, he'll never
forgive you.

880
01:56:55,120 --> 01:56:57,316
Shall we try to settle it with her
once more?

881
01:56:57,521 --> 01:57:01,003
Out of the question. She went wild
when she heard about the money.

882
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:04,410
It looks like she's really
out of her mind.

883
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:09,010
Tell me, please,
has her head been checked?

884
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:11,840
Yes, she's all right.

885
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:15,090
The doctors' conclusion is one thing,
and the facts are another.

886
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,681
You think her behavior
can be considered normal?

887
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:23,408
She's taken all kind of vengeance:
She desecrated poor Varlam,

888
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:26,565
she disgraced you in the eyes of
the entire town.

889
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:31,391
What else does she want?
It's obvious she's reached her goal!

890
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:34,930
But she keeps saying: “I'll dig him up
anyway!“ She's absolutely crazy!

891
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:37,680
It makes no difference now.

892
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:41,010
The expert established
that she's sane.

893
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:48,488
Wait, wait... What do you mean,
no difference?

894
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:52,490
If the defendant is mentally ill,

895
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:56,670
there will be no trial.

896
01:57:57,520 --> 01:58:00,922
She will be sent to a hospital
to be treated... forever...

897
01:58:01,120 --> 01:58:03,316
- Wait, how do we do it?
- It's very simple.

898
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:08,481
Mr. Dzhui, Abel's lawyer,
will request another examination.

899
01:58:08,881 --> 01:58:11,680
- And who's the chief expert?
- Dorofey.

900
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:15,476
Did you hear it, Abel? Our Dorofey.

901
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:19,326
How come we didn't think of it before?

902
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:22,565
No one could imagine it would go
so far.

903
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:28,240
Your Honor, esteemed Prosecutor,
our esteemed public!

904
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:31,680
Be patient, we haven't started
our work yet.

905
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:34,487
That's why I ask for your attention!

906
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:39,318
This trial cannot go on.
The defendant is ill.

907
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:42,155
The medical experts' report
is on file.

908
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:49,319
The medical experts' report
is on file. Item No. 76.

909
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:54,091
It says:

910
01:58:54,961 --> 01:58:58,682
“The defendant is not mentally ill.

911
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:02,682
She is a psychopathic personality

912
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:06,396
prone to affecting acts.“

913
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:10,157
I ask you a question:

914
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:15,480
Can such personality develop
a delirious idea?

915
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:17,313
It certainly can!

916
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:22,845
Through the trial I've been listening
carefully to what the defendant said.

917
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:26,750
Some moments
of her unfortunate life story

918
01:59:26,961 --> 01:59:29,328
had moved me to tears.

919
01:59:29,521 --> 01:59:33,606
But the defendant's persistent claims
that even if she's given 100 years

920
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:37,919
she will dig up the deceased anyway,

921
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:42,844
the strange categoricalness
of that declaration

922
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:47,318
go beyond obsessive ideas
and simply turn into delirium.

923
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:51,992
And delirium is a symptom
of mental disturbance.

924
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:57,764
Meanwhile, the law forbids to bring
a mentally disturbed person to trial.

925
01:59:58,280 --> 02:00:03,480
It's necessary that our
authoritative doctors and experts

926
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:05,677
should have their say.

927
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:08,397
I earnestly request the court

928
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:16,331
that the defendant be sent to
a hospital for another examination.

929
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:20,010
Your Honor!

930
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:23,682
I'm surprised at the superficiality
of my colleague's reasoning.

931
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:27,089
“Can the defendant develop
a delirious idea?“

932
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:30,921
he poses an unexpected question.

933
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:36,320
And he answers it himself:
“She certainly can.“

934
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:40,673
He paints the picture of a person
possessed by delirious ideas,

935
02:00:40,881 --> 02:00:44,317
about whom it is written clearly:
“She is not mentally ill.“

936
02:00:44,721 --> 02:00:48,328
I hope my colleague will excuse me,
but such perfunctoryjudgement

937
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:54,323
of the fate of a long-suffering person
is a patent sacrilege.

938
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:58,525
The severe mental trauma,
the abnormal living conditions

939
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:01,087
had affected the defendant's health

940
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:05,319
and, as the psychiatrists say,
deformed her personality.

941
02:01:05,521 --> 02:01:11,483
But her vengeance is not the result
of a decision nurtured for years,

942
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:16,840
but a temporary insanity, not
psychosis but a reaction of protest!

943
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:19,487
Your Honor! The members of the jury!

944
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:23,759
I'm not asking for your leniency,
I plead with you

945
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:25,917
to take into consideration all
the aforesaid

946
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:29,158
and, based on this, pass on the
defendant the verdict of 'not guilty'.

947
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,405
O Lord...

948
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:46,557
What is it, my son?

949
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:51,091
I came to confess, Father.

950
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:56,158
I've been sinning,
my soul is split in two.

951
02:02:56,960 --> 02:03:03,070
Man has been split in two
since he tasted the forbidden fruit

952
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:05,757
and learned what's good and what's
evil.

953
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:07,918
It's not a great sin.

954
02:03:09,041 --> 02:03:11,681
It's not the split I'm speaking of.

955
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:14,919
My conscience is split in two,
it's my conscience.

956
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:19,476
I'm preaching atheism
while wearing a cross.

957
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:22,317
Perhaps that's why my life
got so confused...

958
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:25,160
After preaching atheism,

959
02:03:25,361 --> 02:03:28,672
it's good to go to church
and confess your sins.

960
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:30,929
No, you didn't understand me.

961
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:36,923
I'm worried about losing, little by
little, my moral principles.

962
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:41,931
I don't see any difference between
good and evil any longer.

963
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:45,316
I've lost faith! Faith!

964
02:03:45,521 --> 02:03:46,841
What faith?

965
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:50,408
I'm ready to forgive everyone

966
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:53,770
and justify any loathsomeness:

967
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:57,681
Snitching, treachery,
cowardliness, deception, baseness.

968
02:03:58,120 --> 02:04:02,091
Then you're a Christ, my son!
It's not for you to complain.

969
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:04,917
You're not lying, are you?

970
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:08,761
No... it's an absolute truth.

971
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:11,677
You think so?

972
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:14,679
Who are you trying to deceive,
hypocrite?

973
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:20,239
You will grind to dust anyone
who stands in your way.

974
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:23,330
If you're struck on one cheek,
you won't turn the other one,

975
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:26,672
you'll strike back so hard
that the other's neck is broken.

976
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:29,486
Your kind is not capable of
splitting!

977
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:32,155
You don't give a damn about good
and evil.

978
02:04:32,360 --> 02:04:37,150
It's not splitting you're worried
about, it's fear that's killing you!

979
02:04:37,361 --> 02:04:38,681
What fear?

980
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:40,837
You fear yourself.

981
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:44,681
All your life you've been after
prestige, proud of your model family,

982
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:46,928
and, suddenly, your world is
collapsing.

983
02:04:47,120 --> 02:04:48,838
- No!
- Yes.

984
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:50,997
Your father is thrown out of his
grave,

985
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:54,329
you're losing your power,
your only son rebels against you.

986
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:57,672
All that stood for the name of Abel
Aravidze is slipping away from you.

987
02:04:57,880 --> 02:05:01,487
And you're left alone,
helpless and weak.

988
02:05:01,720 --> 02:05:05,475
- No! No!!!
- Yes, you're afraid!

989
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:07,677
You're being eaten up by your fear
of loneliness.

990
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:12,409
For a lonely unbeliever

991
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:17,681
thinks only of death.

992
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:21,689
Yes, I'm afraid!

993
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:28,155
I'm surrounded by emptiness.

994
02:05:31,121 --> 02:05:34,489
All my life I've been trying to run
away from it, pretending and lying.

995
02:05:35,601 --> 02:05:38,070
Both my family and my work

996
02:05:40,721 --> 02:05:45,921
are just self-deception, for I am
afraid to be left alone with myself.

997
02:05:47,121 --> 02:05:48,680
Afraid to think.

998
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:50,405
About what?

999
02:05:52,360 --> 02:05:54,670
About what's most important.

1000
02:05:56,721 --> 02:05:58,485
Who are you?

1001
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:04,922
What do you live for?
What's the point of your existence?

1002
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:10,558
Who are you?
What did you live for?

1003
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:17,074
And you?

1004
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:22,474
And you?

1005
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:28,473
Who are you?

1006
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:39,078
Who are you, Abel Aravidze?

1007
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:43,236
Abel Aravidze, Abel Aravidze...

1008
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:49,079
Who are we? What did we come to this
world for? Where are we rushing to?

1009
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:54,691
You know what?
Forget all this nonsense.

1010
02:06:58,440 --> 02:07:03,765
Tomorrow everything will return to
normal and you'll live as you used to.

1011
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:06,326
Trying to atone for your sins?

1012
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:08,477
A coward, that's what you are!

1013
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:14,087
If it were up to me,
I would have sent you right to Hell!

1014
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:20,239
Who are you?
Who are you? Answer me!

1015
02:07:23,121 --> 02:07:25,078
Didn't you recognize me, my boy?

1016
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:28,672
So you came to confess to the devil?

1017
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:37,850
Abel, what's the matter with you?

1018
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:44,680
What is this?

1019
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:49,690
What is it?

1020
02:07:56,721 --> 02:08:01,750
There's no truth, it's the end...
My life is over.

1021
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:04,691
Are you all right?

1022
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:13,236
Take it. Pull yourself together.
Everyone is looking at us.

1023
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:18,557
What does the Prosecutor have to say?

1024
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:25,842
I demand that the case
be re-examined,

1025
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:30,398
legally brought to trial,

1026
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:36,409
and henceforth be known as
“Aravidze versus Barateli“ case.

1027
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:40,490
I'm telling you that Aravidze
will not rest in the ground.

1028
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:44,088
As soon as I'm released,
I'll dig him up.

1029
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:51,011
I hope that Ms. Barateli
is not the primitive creature

1030
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:54,238
that believes it's possible
to achieve a moral objective

1031
02:08:54,440 --> 02:08:58,684
by an immoral act,
by insulting a deceased.

1032
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:01,486
It's possible, because Aravidze
is not dead!

1033
02:09:01,720 --> 02:09:04,394
- You think... he's alive?
- Yes, he's alive!

1034
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:08,924
And as you defend him, he goes on
living and corrupting the society.

1035
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:11,077
<i>Just a minute.</i>

1036
02:09:11,281 --> 02:09:16,242
Excuse me. So you're asserting
that he's alive?

1037
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:17,440
Yes.

1038
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:21,480
Your Honor, members of the jury,
esteemed Prosecutor!

1039
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:25,691
I categorically demand that
the defendant Barateli be sent

1040
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:30,841
to a psychiatric hospital
for examination.

1041
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:35,490
And I do repeat as categorically:
The defendant is sane!

1042
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:39,930
This has been established by an expert
examination and recorded in the report

1043
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:41,679
which is in the file.

1044
02:09:45,720 --> 02:09:47,677
What is the opinion of the jury?

1045
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:51,327
I think so, too.

1046
02:09:55,441 --> 02:09:59,162
It's the court's unanimous decision
that this session be adjourned.

1047
02:09:59,601 --> 02:10:05,233
Goodbye,
esteemed members of the court

1048
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:08,157
and esteemed public.

1049
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:15,917
I'll dig him up anyway.

1050
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:49,011
Evening, spring, and shadows clumping,

1051
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:53,088
On the branch a bird is jumping.

1052
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:57,770
May a new dream me enfold.

1053
02:10:57,960 --> 02:11:00,930
Moon has waned Earth to behold.

1054
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:08,480
I'm Tornike Aravidze,
Varlam Aravidze's grandson.

1055
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:14,477
What do you want?

1056
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:24,750
I came... I came
to ask your forgiveness.

1057
02:11:26,440 --> 02:11:29,842
I'm not the God
to give absolution.

1058
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:38,318
I fired at you.
I'm a murderer.

1059
02:11:41,361 --> 02:11:44,331
Oh God, what a fateful star
I was born under,

1060
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:49,566
if I have made even you,
an innocent boy, a murderer?

1061
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:56,485
Evening, spring, and shadows clumping,

1062
02:11:57,361 --> 02:12:00,092
On the branch a bird is jumping.

1063
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:07,678
Are you making fun of me?

1064
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:12,762
I'm crazy, don't you know it?
Crazy.

1065
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:16,557
I'm really crazy.

1066
02:12:19,720 --> 02:12:23,839
Tomorrow they'll come,
take me by my arms

1067
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:27,487
and drag me to a lunatic asylum.

1068
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:31,170
A lunatic asylum?

1069
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:56,317
Father, what have you done?

1070
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:26,478
What does it all mean?
What are you accusing me of?

1071
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:30,759
The court decided she's crazy
and ordered to put her in an asylum.

1072
02:14:30,961 --> 02:14:34,090
I didn't ask them to.

1073
02:14:34,280 --> 02:14:37,523
She's not crazy, no!
And she's not guilty.

1074
02:14:37,720 --> 02:14:38,915
The hell she isn't!

1075
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:45,491
For how long will you continue
to live by lies?

1076
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:49,839
Because of that slut, you want me
to dig up grandfather from his grave?

1077
02:14:50,040 --> 02:14:54,489
Yes! It's all disgusting!
I can't bear any more lies!

1078
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:56,677
- Calm down, Tornike.
- Leave me alone!

1079
02:14:56,881 --> 02:15:00,090
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself?

1080
02:15:00,280 --> 02:15:03,682
For the sake of your own well-being
you're ready to out anyone's throat,

1081
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:09,242
declare an innocent person a criminal,
a normal one crazy!

1082
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:12,080
Is there anything sacred for you?!

1083
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:13,680
Doesn't your conscience bother you?

1084
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:16,486
Do you know why grandfather
hid in the bunker?

1085
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:20,401
- Shut up, little viper!
- Because he was ashamed!

1086
02:15:20,600 --> 02:15:23,604
- Stop it, Tornike!
- Leave me alone!

1087
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:28,522
I hate you, I hate you all!
This is not a home, it's a grave!

1088
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:31,553
Shut up, you shit!"

1089
02:15:32,360 --> 02:15:34,317
You're not a man any longer.

1090
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:08,079
Tornike, open the door now!
Do you hear me?

1091
02:16:08,520 --> 02:16:14,232
Tornike, open the door, I said!

1092
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:20,681
Tornike, open the door.
Open up.

1093
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:25,829
Abel...

1094
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:27,251
To my dear grandson from
grandfather Varlam

1095
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:33,910
May your name be cursed...

1096
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:40,488
as your life and deeds, Abel Aravidze!

1097
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:44,752
What have you done!

1098
02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:52,409
Monster!

1099
02:17:53,201 --> 02:17:59,243
May your blood...

1100
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:07,688
turn to water...

1101
02:18:10,040 --> 02:18:16,002
and your bread...

1102
02:18:16,881 --> 02:18:22,570
to dust!

1103
02:18:24,440 --> 02:18:27,239
May your flesh...

1104
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:33,170
burn in Hell's fire...

1105
02:18:34,720 --> 02:18:41,001
and not be honored...

1106
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:46,156
like your father...

1107
02:18:47,360 --> 02:18:52,230
with an earthly burial!

1108
02:18:53,361 --> 02:18:57,685
Why were you born...

1109
02:19:01,440 --> 02:19:08,085
devil incarnate...

1110
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:11,848
Abel Aravidze?

1111
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:18,160
And why was your father born?

1112
02:19:20,280 --> 02:19:21,759
And your son?

1113
02:19:32,721 --> 02:19:35,486
It's grown so dark, it's pitch dark!

1114
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:42,479
Oh God, all this is so senseless!

1115
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:29,407
“Having fulfilled his duty, he passed
away, a loyal son to his Motherland,

1116
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:34,241
an exemplary citizen
and an irreproachable man.

1117
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:39,000
May his blessed memory
live forever

1118
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:42,409
in the hearts
of his friends and comrades.“

1119
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:47,750
So you knew Aravidze well?

1120
02:20:48,360 --> 02:20:50,829
He was fifteen years older than me.

1121
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:54,672
He would have been 78 now.

1122
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:58,319
He had lived a big,
eventful life.

1123
02:20:59,880 --> 02:21:03,089
He was a good man, a great man!

1124
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:07,850
But people say that his sins
gave him no peace.

1125
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:15,671
Not at all, my dear!
People talk such rubbish.

1126
02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:17,759
There was no other man in the world

1127
02:21:17,960 --> 02:21:21,999
as pure and sympathetic as he.

1128
02:21:22,360 --> 02:21:25,330
His only concern was
how to be useful to people.

1129
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:40,251
Excuse me, does this street
lead to a church?

1130
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:46,081
I want to know whether this street
leads to a church.

1131
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:51,399
No, this is Varlam Street,
and it doesn't lead to a church.

1132
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:55,555
Then what do you need it for?

1133
02:21:56,440 --> 02:22:00,479
Why have a road
that doesn't lead to a church?

1134
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:02,565
