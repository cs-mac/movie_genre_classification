1
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,552
George - What do you want?

2
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,233
Where are we going?

3
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,113
Forgot that already, did you?

4
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,437
I forgot.  I tried not to forget. Honest I did.

5
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,839
OK, OK, I'll tell you again- I got nothin else to do.

6
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,628
Might as well spend my time tellin you things. You forget em, and I'll tell you again.

7
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,433
I tried and I tried, but it didn't do no good.

8
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,560
I remember about the rabbits, George!

9
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,040
Oh yeah ... Ya can remember a thing- Rabbits.

10
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,189
Don't you remember us goin into Johnson and Beaties in Frisco, and they give us the bus tickets and the work cards?

11
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,596
Oh, sure- I remember that now.

12
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,876
George...

13
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,710
What?

14
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,872
I ain't got mine.  I must've lost it.

15
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,060
Ya never had none-  I got em both here.

16
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,580
Ya think I'd let ya carry your own work card?

17
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,330
I thought I put it right here in my side pocket.

18
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,045
I think we're gettin to her ... I'm gonna ask the driver.

19
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,730
How far to No. 3 ranch, bud?

20
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,440
Didn't I take you guys to Weed just a short time ago?

21
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,180
Don't strain your memory, just answer my question!

22
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,580
OK, OK- Don't get sore.

23
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,476
It's just a little stretch down the road.

24
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,718
You'll do better if you get off here.

25
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,920
C'mon, Lennie.

26
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,920
Ranch No. 3: Ten- Ten Miles!

27
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,440
Soledad Land Company.

28
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,360
Ten miles!

29
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,951
"It's just a little stretch up the road", he says! 

30
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,560
Ten miles and the hottest day we've had.

31
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,930
If I ever see that bus driver again, I'll bust his n..

32
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,629
...

33
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,930
Lennie!

34
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,830
Hey, Lennie!

35
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,115
Hey Lennie- Don't drink so much water- you're gonna be sick!

36
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,090
Lennie, do you hear me? You're gonna be sick!

37
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,120
Lennie...

38
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,340
That's good, George. You drink some, too.

39
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:52,592
You take a good big drink.

40
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,860
I ain't sure its good water.

41
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,160
Looks kinda scummy-

42
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,075
Tastes alright.

43
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,193
It don't seem to be wrong

44
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,910
Ya never oughtta drink water, when it ain't runnin, Lennie.

45
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,980
You'd drink out of a gutter, if you were thirsty.

46
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,309
What'd you take out of your pocket?

47
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,160
I ain't got a thing in my pocket, George.

48
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,840
I know it - Ya got it in your hand.  What have you got in your hand?

49
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,580
I ain't got nothin in my hand, George, honest.

50
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,030
Come on- Give it here.

51
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,790
I-its only a bird.

52
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,890
A bird?

53
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,390
A live bird?

54
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,880
No! Just a dead bird- I didn't kill it, though- I found it- I found it dead.

55
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:43,890
Alright- give it here.

56
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,320
Ah- Let me have it, George. - Give it to me!

57
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,680
What do you want with a dead bird?

58
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,010
Last week, it was a mouse.

59
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,720
I was just pettin him with my thumb while we walked along.

60
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,040
You ain't pettin no bird while you're walkin with me.

61
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,592
Oh- Why ain't we going to the ranch to get some supper.

62
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,580
They got supper at the ranch.

63
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,077
No reason at all- I just like it here. 

64
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,460
Lennie, tomorrow we'll be goin to work.

65
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,530
Bustin our backs liftin up them barley bags.

66
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,116
For tonight-

67
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,180
I'm just gonna lay here and look up.

68
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,000
Not carin for about a grain bag or a boss in the world

69
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,220
- Ain't we gonna have no supper?  -Sure we are

70
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,520
If you get us some dead willow sticks, me - I got three cans of beans here in my binbo.

71
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,290
You get that fire ready, and I'll give ya a match and we'll get the sticks together.

72
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,240
We'll heat up these beans and have supper.

73
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,280
I like beans with ketchup.

74
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,080
We ain't got no ketchup-

75
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,560
Now go on- get them sticks.

76
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,140
Don't you fool around none, neither.

77
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,320
It'll be dark soon.

78
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,880
I guess they're about done.

79
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,040
Ya got enough beans there for 4 men.

80
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,620
I like 'em with ketchup.

81
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,860
I told you we ain't got none.

82
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,520
Whatever we ain't got, that's what you want.

83
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,040
If I was alone, I could live so easy.

84
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,460
At the end of the month, I could take my 50 bucks, go into town and get whatever I want.

85
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,560
Gallon of whisky, sit in a poolroom, playin cards, or shoot pool.

86
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,410
And what do I got? I got you.

87
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,990
You just keep me shovin, all over the country, all the time.

88
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,760
And that ain't the worst ... you do bad things.

89
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,509
You get in trouble all the time and I have to get you out.

90
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,520
Like what ya done up in Weed.

91
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,120
They'd have lynched you if they'd a caught you.

92
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,920
You just wanted touch that girl's dress.

93
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,590
Cause it looked so nice and soft.

94
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,797
Ya just wanted to pet it like it was a bird, or a rabbit.

95
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,320
And what did you hold on for, when she started yellin her head off.

96
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,436
Whyn't you let go?

97
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,870
I- I wasn't gonna hurt her.

98
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,840
I wish I could put ya in a cage with about a million rabbits and leave ya there.

99
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,580
And let them pet you.

100
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,240
You- want I should go away and leave ya alone?

101
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,930
Where could you go?

102
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,120
I could - I could go right up in them hills and someplace find a cave.

103
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,060
Alright- and how'd you eat?

104
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,620
You ain't got sense enough to find somethin to eat.

105
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,820
uh- I'd find things.

106
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,319
I don't need no nice food with ketchup on it.

107
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,560
I could lay out in the sun, where nobody'd hurt me.

108
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,330
I've been mean, ain't I?  ... Ain't I?

109
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,360
Well, if you don't want me-

110
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,420
You only just gotta say so.

111
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,390
Oh- I could go right up in them hills and live by myself.

112
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,680
And I won't get no birds stole from me.

113
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,110
Someody'd shoot you for a coyote, if you was by yourself.

114
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,260
You better stay with me.

115
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,090
George...

116
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,590
What?

117
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,080
Tell me, like ya done before

118
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,590
- Tell you what? - About the Rabbits-

119
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,160
Now you ain't puttin nothin over on me.

120
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,440
No George, please.  Tell me like ya done before.

121
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,620
You get a kick outta that, don't ya? - Uh huh.

122
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,755
Alright, I'll tell ya.  Go ahead and eat your beans.

123
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,310
Go on, George ...

124
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,680
Well...

125
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,620
Guys like us that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world.

126
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,060
They come to the ranch, they work up a stake, ...

127
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,020
They go into town, they blow that stake, 

128
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,960
And then the first thing you know, 

129
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,160
They're poundin their tail in another ranch.

130
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,280
so they got nothin to look ahead to.

131
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,690
That's right- But not us.

132
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,440
Now tell how it is with us.

133
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,510
Well, with us, it ain't like that.

134
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,760
We got a future.

135
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,080
We got somebody to talk to that gives a hoot about us.

136
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,991
We don't have to set in no bar room blowin away our jack cause we got no place to go,

137
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,480
If them other guys go to jail, they can rot for all anybody cares.

138
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,047
But not us..  And why?

139
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,620
Because I got you to look after me, and you got me to look after you. And that's why.

140
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,990
Go on, George.

141
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,810
You can do it yourself- You know it by heart.

142
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,040
Please. I forget some of the stuff.

143
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,210
Go on, George ... Tell how it's gonna be.

144
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,970
Well...  Someday we're gonna get the jack together

145
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,830
and we're gonna get a little house

146
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,060
on a couple of acres

147
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,280
A cow, chickens, pigs ...

148
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,620
And rabbits! Go on, George. Tell about the rabbits ...

149
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,880
and cages, and the rain in the winter, and the stove, 

150
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,790
and the cream so thick that you can't even cut it with a knife.

151
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,440
Tell about that, George.

152
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,840
I don't know why you don't do it yourself, you know it all-

153
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,880
Oh, please- it ain't the same if I tell it. Go on, George.

154
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,940
Tell about the rabbits and how I get to tan them.

155
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,260
Well, we're gonna have...

156
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,120
a...

157
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,830
a big vegetable patch.

158
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,960
Some chickens, and a rabbit hutch.

159
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,120
And we can live on the fat of the land.

160
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,510
And live on the fat of the land.

161
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,490
In the winter, when it rains ... we're gonna say- Skip the work.

162
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,730
We're gonna light a big fire in the stove,

163
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,210
We're gonna sit around, and listen to the rain comin

164
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,740
down on the roof.

165
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,080
And ... I ain't got time for no more.  Let's hit the hay.

166
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,410
Look, Lennie- What are ya gonna say when the boss asks you questions? 

167
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,760
Huh?

168
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,690
I- ain't gonna say a word.

169
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,170
Good boy- Say, that's fine.

170
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,370
Look, Lennie ... I want for you to look around here.

171
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,840
Do you think that you can remember this place?

172
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,720
Sure, George. I can remember here.

173
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,590
Didn't I remember about not sayin a word?

174
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,380
Yes, of course you did.  Now look- Lennie

175
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,490
Lennie!

176
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,420
If you just happen to get in trouble, like you always done before-

177
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,920
I want for you to come back here ...

178
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,760
and hide in the brush.

179
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,530
Hide in the brush.

180
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,960
Hide in the brush until I come for ya.

181
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,280
Can you remember that?

182
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,080
Sure, George. I can remember. Hide in the brush until you come.

183
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,450
Until I come ... But ...

184
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,630
You ain't gonna get in no trouble, cause if you do, I ain't gonna let you tend them rabbits.

185
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,260
I ain't gonna get in no trouble, George.

186
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,620
I ain't gonna say a word.

187
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,240
You got it-  At least I hope so.

188
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,820
Alright, let's hit the hay.

189
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,080
Alright.

190
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,230
It's gonna be nice sleepin here-

191
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,160
Lookin up ... With the leaves ...

192
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,633
Boy, you sure feel free when you ain't got a job.

193
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,080
And if you ain't hungry.

194
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,840
Let's have different color rabbits, George.

195
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,290
Sure we will.

196
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,260
Red and blue and pink ones, Lennie.

197
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,690
Millions of em.

198
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,820
Furry ones- Like I seen at the fair in Sacramento.

199
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,240
Furry ones ...

200
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,930
of course-

201
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,430
I can just as well go up in them hills 

202
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,675
And find a cave if you don't want me.

203
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,380
Shut up-

204
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,360
- George? - What?

205
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,920
I'm shuttin up, George.

206
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,831
Come in!

207
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,834
Some new guys have come, boss.

208
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,116
Bring em in.

209
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,120
Got your work slips?

210
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:39,711
Yes.

211
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,752
I see its not Johnson and Beattie's fault.

212
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,033
It says right here on your work slips, you should have been here last night.

213
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,805
Ready to go to work this morning.

214
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,354
The bus driver gave us a bum steer, and we had to walk 10 miles.

215
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,598
I had to send the barley wagon without two buckers.

216
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,477
What's your name?

217
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,988
My name is George Milton.

218
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,196
George...

219
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,191
Milton.

220
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:05,878
Milton.

221
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,677
Yours.

222
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,720
His name is Lennie Small.

223
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,755
Lennie Small.

224
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,390
Lemme see-

225
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,113
It is Friday the 20th- 

226
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,237
About 1:35PM ... Half an hour yet before you have to work at 2.

227
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,115
Where you boys been working?

228
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,196
Around Weed.

229
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,311
You too?

230
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,038
Yes.

231
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,516
Him too.

232
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,909
He ain't much of a talker, is he?

233
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,152
No, he's a good worker, though- strong as a bull.

234
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,799
I'm strong as a bull.

235
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,605
What can you do?

236
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,277
He can do anything.

237
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,805
Listen, Small, what can you do?

238
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,800
Anything you like. He's a good skinner, he can wrestle grain bags,  drive a cultivator, anything you like.  Just give him a try.

239
00:17:58,835 --> 00:18:00,233
Then why not let him answer?

240
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,469
What are you trying to pull over?

241
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,956
I don't say he's bright- he ain't, but I say he's a good worker. He can put up a 400 lb bale.

242
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,596
Say...

243
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,549
What are you sellin?

244
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,557
What?

245
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,989
What stake ya got in this guy?

246
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,476
You takin his pay away from him?

247
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,471
Of course I ain't.

248
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,638
I never seen one guy go to so much trouble for another guy,.

249
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,754
I would just like to know what your percentage is.

250
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,315
He is my cousin.

251
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,992
I told his old lady that I'd take care of him.

252
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,075
He got kicked in the head by a horse when he was kid.

253
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,954
He just ain't bright, but he'll do anything you tell him.

254
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,031
Alright.

255
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,590
I guess it don't take much brains to buck barley bags.

256
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,832
But don't try to put anything over, Milton.  

257
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,955
I've got my eye on you.

258
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,315
Why did you quit in Weed?

259
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,269
Ah- the job was done.

260
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,716
What kinda job?

261
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,269
Digging a cesspool.

262
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,556
Alright.

263
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,353
But don't try to put anything over.

264
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,432
I've seen wise guys before.

265
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,390
Show these guys to the bunkhouse, then take them out to Slim.

266
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,677
Uh- Yes, sir.

267
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,795
Candy!

268
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:20,872
Yes, sir?

269
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,356
Do not forget to tell them what a nice guy the boss is.

270
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,952
I wasn't gonna say nothin, boss.

271
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,150
Hi, Crooks-

272
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,189
What you got there?

273
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,595
Ross' busted saddle.

274
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,788
Them two guys is the new stiffs.

275
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,917
I know.

276
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,195
Did the boss raise enough cain with me when they didn't show up?

277
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,790
He sure did.

278
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,478
The boss always takes it out on Crooks when he gets mad.

279
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,355
Got that crooked back when a horse kicked him.

280
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,233
He reads a lot. Got books in his room.

281
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,471
Yes?

282
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,799
Alright, what kind of a guy is the boss?

283
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,990
Come on, come on.  What's he like?

284
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,837
Well, he's a pretty nice fella for a boss.

285
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,394
He gets mad sometimes, but he's pretty nice.

286
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,360
You know what he done at Christmas?

287
00:20:17,395 --> 00:20:17,758
What?

288
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,153
Brought a gallon of whiskey right in the bunkhouse and says:

289
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,194
Drink hearty boys, Christmas comes but once a year.

290
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,875
A whole gallon. huh?

291
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,599
Oh, by golly, we had fun.

292
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,436
What were you saying?

293
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,320
They let Crooks come in that night...

294
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:35,880
Yes?

295
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,278
Well, sir, a little skinner, named uh, Smittie, takes after the black boy

296
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,189
The guys wouldn't let him use his feet, 

297
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,629
So Crooks got him.

298
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,474
The guy says, onna count of the black man got a crooked back, 

299
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,028
Smittie can't use his feet.

300
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:48,957
I see.

301
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,079
After that, the guys went into town, and they tore 'er to pieces.

302
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,429
I didn't go in there.

303
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,273
I ain't got the steam no more.

304
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,790
A pretty old dog, huh?

305
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,675
Had him ever since he was a pup.

306
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,913
He was a good sheep dog when he was young.

307
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,870
Over here.

308
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,160
You can have them two beds there.

309
00:21:25,195 --> 00:21:26,354
Alright

310
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,513
I'll take the top one- I don't want you fallin down on me.

311
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,430
What is this?

312
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,000
Hmm?

313
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,755
What's this?

314
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,001
I don't know.

315
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,991
No?

316
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,236
Says "Positively kills fleas, lice, and other scourges".

317
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,359
What kind of bed you have given us?

318
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,191
No no, I'll tell you what.  The last guy that had that bunk was a blacksmith

319
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,589
As clean a fella as you'd wanna meet.

320
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,832
He used to wash his hands even after he et.

321
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,278
Then how come he got pillow pigeons?

322
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,792
Well, he's the kinda fella that'd put that stuff around even if there wasn't no bugs.

323
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,677
Now, he'd peel his boiled potatoes. And he'd pick out every little speck before he'd eat it.

324
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,539
If there was a red blotch on an egg, he'd scrape it off.  And then he finally quit.

325
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,671
I'll bet he did.

326
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,508
No- About the food.  That's the kind of guy he was - clean.

327
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,557
If I find a single pillow pigeon in this bed, you're gonna hear from me.

328
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,151
OK- now

329
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,474
you two fellas get set, and

330
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,951
I'll come back in a minute to take you to Slim.

331
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,765
Seen my old man, Candy?

332
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,472
Just left him back at your house a little while ago.

333
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,957
I'll try to catch him.

334
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,230
You the new guys my old man was looking for?

335
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,270
Yeah, we just come.

336
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,710
Let the big guy talk.

337
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,365
What if he don't wanna talk?

338
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,310
He's gotta talk when he's spoke to-

339
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,725
What are you shovin into this for?

340
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,079
Him and me travel together.

341
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,872
And you won't let the big guy talk, is that it?

342
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,713
He'll talk if he wants to tell you anything.

343
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,877
We just come in.

344
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,273
Well, next time answer when you're spoke to.

345
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,432
What are you pickin on him for? He ain't done nothin to you.

346
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,238
Are you drawin cards this hand?

347
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,075
I might.

348
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,438
Well, I'll see you get a chance to ante.

349
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,199
What's he got on his shoulder?  Lennie didn't say nothin to him.

350
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,192
Well, I'll tell you what.  Curley's like a lot of little guys- He hates big guys.

351
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,110
It's kinda like he's mad at em cause he ain't a big guy.

352
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,074
You've seen lots o little guys, ain't you?  Always scrappin.

353
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,073
Curley sounds like a skunk to me.

354
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,953
I hate mean little guys.

355
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,394
It seems to me like Curley's the worst.  Got married a couple months ago, his wife lives over in the boss' house.

356
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,514
Seems like Curley's got worse since he got married-

357
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:27,240
Like he's sitten on an ant hill.

358
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,719
Maybe he's showin off for his wife.

359
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,756
Yes. You just wait'll you see Curley's wife.

360
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,995
One, two. One, two.

361
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,828
The two new buckers showed up, Curley.

362
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,836
I've seen 'em, Dad.

363
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,515
Don't like their looks much.

364
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,548
Well, I'm not gonna hold that against them.

365
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,629
We wouldn't have a man on the place if I waited for you to like somebody's looks.

366
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,994
If I didn't watch 'em like a hawk every minute, we wouldn't have a place.

367
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,430
Seen Mae?

368
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,234
Oh, let her alone for a minute.

369
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,394
Why do you keep pesterin her?

370
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,830
She ain't doin no harm.

371
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,111
How do I know that?

372
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,990
Y'know, maybe if Mae had some women to talk to...

373
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,190
It ain't women I'm worried about.

374
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,593
Ah, stick to your job, and forget your wife for an hour.

375
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,394
You sure trust me, don't ya, Curley?

376
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,673
As far as I can spit.

377
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,000
Who's in there with you?

378
00:25:48,035 --> 00:25:49,513
There ain't nobody in there.

379
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,470
Ya punch drunk pug- I ain't even seen the boy.

380
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,239
He must have just come in.

381
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,557
Get out of here!

382
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,073
Next time, they'll carry you out.

383
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,391
This'll happen to any guy I catch with you.

384
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,555
What did I ever do to give you the right to treat me like..

385
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,596
Nothing.

386
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,512
But I ain't takin no chances.

387
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,071
You got a home. You got a husband.

388
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,518
You got no business messing around.

389
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,313
Sure I got a home.

390
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,514
Ya think all I wanna do is sit in that 2x4 just waitin for ya?

391
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,828
I want to see somebody.

392
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,432
Just see 'em, and talk to 'em.

393
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,512
I tell you, I just want to talk to somebody!

394
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,949
You got me to talk to ya.

395
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,360
Yes. I lead with my left twice, see.  Then I bring the ol' right cross.

396
00:27:01,395 --> 00:27:04,177
One, two. One, two and down.

397
00:27:04,212 --> 00:27:06,959
One, two. I can hear it in my sleep.

398
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,669
Where did ya get that pup?

399
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,075
He was given to me.

400
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,350
Slim gave him to you, didn't he?

401
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,317
And what if he did?

402
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,755
No guy's giving my wife presents.

403
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,034
You're giving that pup back.

404
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,316
Oh yeah?

405
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,880
If you're not giving it back, Slim's gonna take it back.

406
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:27,677
No- He's not afraid of you.

407
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,194
We'll see whether he is or not.

408
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,718
Wait'll he takes the ol' "one-two".

409
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:35,996
One, two.

410
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,308
One, two.

411
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,040
Hey, Slim!

412
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,960
Come on down here!

413
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,155
Looks like we're gonna have fun.

414
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,110
 I know you're the best skinner my old man's got on the place.

415
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,875
And I know he won't let me can ya,

416
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,954
But he can't stop me from tanglin with you if you don't lay off my wife.

417
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,233
What is it this time, Mr. Jackson?

418
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,834
You gave her one of your pups.

419
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,645
and?

420
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,520
I do not want no ranch hand givin' my wife presents.

421
00:28:37,555 --> 00:28:38,350
and?

422
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,600
She won't give it up, so you've got to take it back.

423
00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:42,749
That's right.

424
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,355
Curley ain't never going to tangle with Slim.

425
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,034
Not with Slim, he ain't.

426
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,390
After work, Slim.

427
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,559
I'll give it to you on your own time.

428
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,717
Hey, Slim!

429
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,268
I'm riding over to the barn.

430
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,474
I'm making sure you've got no more pups to give away.

431
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,356
Holy Smoke- That guy tried to kill us!

432
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,874
He was aimin at Lennie.

433
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,751
It's like I told you. He hates big guys.

434
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,796
Well, come on, you fellas.

435
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,549
This here's Slim, fellas.  What Slim says goes around here.

436
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,750
Ah, lay off, Candy.

437
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,836
Candy is right.

438
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,440
The boss tells you what to do, but if you want to know how to do it,

439
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:07,032
you gotta ask the mule skinner.

440
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,794
My name is George Milton.

441
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,237
He's my partner here, Lennie Small.

442
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,045
You fellas travel around together?

443
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,275
Yes, we kind of look out for each other.

444
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,318
Not many fellas travelin around together.

445
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,517
Go on, George. Ask him.

446
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,236
What's eatin him?

447
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,156
He has heard Curley talk about your pups, and now he wants one.

448
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,039
One white and brown.

449
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,469
Okay, big boy.

450
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,875
We get back to the barn, I'll give you one.

451
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,316
A brown and white one.

452
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,679
You guys ever buck any barley?

453
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,885
I'll say. 

454
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,990
I'm nothin to scream about, but this big guy ...

455
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,429
Watch this, mister.

456
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,516
You all right?

457
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,037
Ready, Lennie?

458
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,032
OK- Let her go.

459
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,431
Hey, Slim, Slim ... Get this.

460
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,999
Get out from under that wheel!

461
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,477
He won't drop it till I tell him- unless the supper bell rings.

462
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,277
There ya are.

463
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,637
Alright, Lennie, let her down.

464
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,654
Easy now ...

465
00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:18,709
Easy, boy ...

466
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,311
That's right.

467
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,437
OK-

468
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,154
You sure was right about him.

469
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,153
I've never seen such a strong guy.

470
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,708
Give us the word, Slim- We'll show ya.

471
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,195
Hey, Slim!

472
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,795
OK, boys- Let em buck.

473
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,879
There's Curley's wife now.

474
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,520
You know what I think? I think Curley's married hisself a pack of trouble.

475
00:31:47,555 --> 00:31:48,714
There's plenty done that.

476
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,236
You look her over, and see if I ain't right.

477
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,475
You're the fellas that just come, ain't you?

478
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,557
Yes.

479
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:02,917
Yes.

480
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,718
What Candy says about her is right-

481
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,508
Curley has got a pack of trouble.

482
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,475
Gosh, she's pretty.

483
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,670
Now you listen to me-

484
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,269
Don't you even look at her!

485
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,598
Ah, I never done nothin, George.

486
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,315
No you never.

487
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,275
But when she was standin here, you wasn't lookin the other way, neither.

488
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,348
I never meant no harm, George- Honest I never.

489
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,870
She was so pretty and she had a pup.

490
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,510
You keep away from her.

491
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,350
Yes. Let Curley take the rap.

492
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,073
He let himself in for her.

493
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,200
I do not like this place. This ain't no nice place.

494
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,519
I do not like this place.

495
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,751
Listen! I don't like it no better than you!

496
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,311
But we gotta keep here until we got a stake!

497
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,760
Come on, George, let's go- Let's get outta here.

498
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:15,749
It's mean here.

499
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,036
Shut up, and get up and get to work- Here comes that skunk again.

500
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,308
Did you see a girl around here?

501
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,831
Get back to work.

502
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,275
A couple of minutes ago, maybe.

503
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,076
What was she doin?

504
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,510
I did not ask her.

505
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,030
Which way'd she go?

506
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,193
I don't know. I didn't want to know.

507
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,479
You know, Lennie? I'm scared I'm gonna tangle with that palooka myself.

508
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,154
I hate the sight of him.

509
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,319
You ain't mad, George.

510
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,589
I ain't mad at you.

511
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,554
I'm mad at this Curley.

512
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,196
You keep away from him.

513
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:08,990
Sure I will.

514
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,669
I won't say a word.

515
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,513
Do not let them pull you in.

516
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,075
But if he takes a sock at ya, let him have it.

517
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,549
Let him have what, George?

518
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,951
Never mind.

519
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,392
Look- if you get into any kind of trouble, do you remember what I told you?

520
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,078
That if I get in any trouble ...

521
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,191
you ain't gonna let me tend the rabbits.

522
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,715
That ain't what I mean...

523
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,357
Do you remember where we slept last night?

524
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,635
Down by the river?

525
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,193
Oh, sure- I remember that.

526
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,515
I go there and hide in the brush until you come.

527
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,165
That's it.

528
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,634
You hide until I come for ya. Now say that over.

529
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,034
Hide in the brush by the river.

530
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,108
Down in the brush by the river.

531
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,034
If you get into trouble.

532
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,960
If I get into trouble.

533
00:35:04,995 --> 00:35:05,631
That's it.

534
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,549
Hide in the brush by the river.

535
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,710
Down in the brush by the river.

536
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,996
Hide in the brush by the river.

537
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,949
I'll take them, Slim-

538
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,550
I was just given the pups some milk, Slim.

539
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,469
She's feelin fine.

540
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,631
Thanks, Candy.

541
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,871
Curley ain't been messin around with the pups, has he?

542
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,110
I ain't seen him, Slim.

543
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,319
How are ya, Slim-  How'd it go today?

544
00:36:01,354 --> 00:36:03,278
Pretty good, we got two good men now.

545
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,916
That so? 

546
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:07,360
Glad to know ya.  My name's Carlson.

547
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,475
My name's George Milton.

548
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,992
This here's my partner, Lennie Small.

549
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,552
He ain't very small.  No, he ain't small at all.

550
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,275
Here ya are, Lennie ... A brown and white one.

551
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,394
How many pups ya got left, Slim?

552
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,835
I gave this to Curley's wife.

553
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,470
Got two left.

554
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,640
Are you gonna keep em both?

555
00:36:43,675 --> 00:36:44,197
I dont know.

556
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,951
Got to keep em a while to drink up Lula's milk.

557
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,111
You know, Slim? That ol dog of Candy's, he's so old he can hardly walk.

558
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,030
Every time Candy brings him in the bunkhouse, I can smell him for two or three days.

559
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,400
Why don't ya get Candy to shoot the old dog, 

560
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:02,391
and give him one of them pups to raise up.

561
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,797
Cmon, Let's wash up. There'll be nothin left to eat in a few minutes.

562
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,634
Kind of put you on the spot-

563
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,032
Lennie- put that pup back a while. Come and wash up.

564
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,278
I'm coming, George.

565
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,672
Very been very nice of you to give Lennie that pup.

566
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,111
Ah, it wasn't nothing.  No need to thank me for that.

567
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,910
Well, it wasn't much to you, maybe, but it's a lot to him.

568
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,430
I do not know how we're gonna get him to sleep in the bunkhouse tonight-

569
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,353
He'll want to stay right out here in the barn.

570
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,078
Gonna have trouble keepin him from gettin right in that box with those pups.

571
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,957
What do we do? Catch a shower?

572
00:37:44,992 --> 00:37:46,154
You can catch a shower any time.

573
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,672
The only dish out that grub once.

574
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:49,791
Lennie!

575
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,309
You sure were right about him-

576
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,513
I never seen such a worker.

577
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,957
I thought he was gonna kill you buckin that barley.

578
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,910
You just tell Lennie what to do and he'll do it.

579
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,509
If it don't take no figurin'.

580
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,319
Funny, you and him stringin along together.

581
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,915
What's so funny about it?

582
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,036
I dont know.

583
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,629
Just seems kind of funny-

584
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,312
cuckoo like him and a smart guy like you.

585
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,678
He ain't no cuckoo- He's dumb, but he ain't crazy.

586
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,473
And I ain't so smart, neither- 
I wouldn't be buckin barley for my 50 and fun.

587
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,389
If I was bright; if I was even a bit smarter,

588
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,989
I'd have a place of my own.  Bringin in my own crops.

589
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,435
Instead of doing all the work and not gettin what comes up outta the ground.

590
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,394
Yeah, I'd kinda like to do that.

591
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,432
I sometimes'd like to cuss out a string of mules that was my own mules

592
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,511
Sure-

593
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,830
It ain't so funny about me and Lennie travelin together-

594
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,710
We growed up together.

595
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,112
At first, I made fun of Lennie-

596
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,398
I used to play jokes on him, cause he was too dumb to take care of himself.

597
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,759
He was too dumb to know that jokes was bein played on him.

598
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,790
Yes. I had fun.

599
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,436
It made me seem smart, alongside of him.

600
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,753
Yeah, I seen it that way.

601
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,037
I'll tell you what made me stop playin jokes.

602
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,878
There was a bunch of us standing along side the Sacramento River.

603
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,077
I was feelin kind of show-off, see, so I turns to Lennie and I says

604
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,078
"Jump in".    - What happened?

605
00:39:21,078 --> 00:39:22,200
He jumps

606
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,509
He couldn't swim a stroke, so he nearly drowned.

607
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,592
And he was so nice to me, because I pulled him out.

608
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,996
See, he clean forgot I told him to jump in.

609
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,473
I never done anything like that since.

610
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,031
It makes me feel kinda sick talkin about it.

611
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,157
Lennie!

612
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,312
I'll go wash up pretty soon, George.

613
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,470
You go now-

614
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,990
I'll tell Slim not to let you have that pup.

615
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,753
I'm goin...

616
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,989
Just like a kid, ain't he?

617
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,038
There's no more harm in him than a kid, neither.

618
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,075
Except he's so strong.

619
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,115
He ain't got enough sense to take care of himself.

620
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,273
That's alright- Nice fella.

621
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,398
A guy don't need no sense to be a nice fella.

622
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,672
Lennie is a nuisance most of the time, 

623
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,229
But you get used to goin around with the guy, and ya can't get rid of him.

624
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,436
Do you want to get rid of him?

625
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,878
He gets in trouble all the time.

626
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,029
Like he done in Weed.

627
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,230
You wouldn't tell anybody, would ya?

628
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,271
What did he do in Weed?

629
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,875
You wouldn't tell anybody, would ya?

630
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,195
No, of course you wouldn't-

631
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,430
What did he do in Weed?

632
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,836
Well, there was this girl come along in a red dress-

633
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,029
Here he comes. I'll tell you later.

634
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,198
I done just like you told me, George.

635
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:55,958
That's fine.

636
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,389
Eat your supper.

637
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,220
It's brown and white, just like I wanted.

638
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,772
Ain't you gonna take me to the movies, like ya promised?

639
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,198
I seen it the other night with some of the boys.

640
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,076
Hello Slim-

641
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,875
Hello George.

642
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,354
Don't neither of you play any horshoes?

643
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,949
I don't like to play every night.

644
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,500
You guys got a slug of whiskey? I gotta cramp.

645
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,500
I ain't.

646
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,280
If I had any, I'd drink it myself.

647
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,395
I ain't got no cramp, neither.

648
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,500
Cabbage does it to me- Know'd it was gonna, afor I et it.

649
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,393
You ought've seen that stable buck Bitshune-

650
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,197
He never give nobody a chance to win.

651
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,759
Man alive, that dog smells.

652
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,315
Candy, get him out of here.

653
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,429
I don't know nothin smells as bad as old dog smell

654
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,548
I been around him so much, 

655
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,033
I've never noticed how he smells.

656
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,958
Well, I can't stand him in here.

657
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,476
That smell hangs around even after he's gone.

658
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,000
Look at him, Candy- The old fella's all stiff with rheumatism. 

659
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,320
He ain't no good to ya.

660
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,309
Why don't you shoot him?

661
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,300
I tell ya what, Mr. Carlson,  I had him so long.

662
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,500
I herded sheep with him-

663
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,836
You wouldn't think to look at him now, 

664
00:45:49,836 --> 00:45:53,040
But he was the best sheep dog I ever seen

665
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,500
I knowd a guy in Weed with an Airdale that could herd sheep. 

666
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,520
Learned it from the other dogs.

667
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,432
That old fella just suffers hisself all the time-

668
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,437
If you was to take him out and shoot him, 

669
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,514
Right in the back of the head.

670
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,590
Why, he'd never know what hit him.

671
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,229
So you won't shoot him.

672
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,268
No. I couldn't do that.  

673
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,077
I had him too long.

674
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,953
He don't have no fun no more-

675
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,869
Besides he smells bad.

676
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,796
I tell you what I'll do.

677
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,510
I'll shoot him for ya, so it won't be you that done it.

678
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,350
Leave him alone, Carl. It ain't a guys dog that matters,

679
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,112
its the way a guy feels about his dog.

680
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,750
Me- I wouldn't trade my mutt here for one of them field trial pointers.

681
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,595
Candy ain't bein nice to him, leavin him alive.

682
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,834
LIsten- Slim's hound has that litter now-

683
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,311
I bet you he'd give you one of them pups to raise up.

684
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,789
Wouldn't ya, Slim?

685
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,994
Yeah, you can have a pup.

686
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,988
Carl is right, Candy.

687
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,990
That poor dog ain't no good for himself.

688
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,795
I wish someone'd shoot me if I get old and a cripple.

689
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,949
Maybe it'd hurt him.  I don't mind takin care of him.

690
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,073
He'd be better off dead. The way I'd shoot him, he wouldn't feel nothin.

691
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,040
Say- Have you guys seen this?  Right here- Read that.

692
00:47:36,075 --> 00:47:37,393
I don't want to read nothin.

693
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,197
It'll be over in a minute, Candy- Come on.

694
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:41,956
Did you see it, Slim?

695
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,158
What is this?

696
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,708
Read that- Read it out loud.

697
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:45,877
- Dear Editor?  - Yeah.

698
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,309
I been readin your mag for the past 6 months,

699
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,439
I think its the best on the market.

700
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,398
I like stories by Peter Rand.

701
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,310
I think he is a wingding-

702
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,035
What did you want me to read that for?

703
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,714
Read the name at the bottom.

704
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,152
"Yours for success, William Tanner."

705
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,749
What did you want me to read that for?

706
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,078
You don't remember Bill Tanner; worked here till about three months ago?

707
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,440
Oh- sure- Carl, you remember him, a little guy.

708
00:48:11,475 --> 00:48:12,759
Yeah, Slim.  Yeah, that's the guy.

709
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,337
Now, Candy, if you want me to, I'll put the ol fella out of his misery right now.

710
00:48:21,372 --> 00:48:25,675
There's nothing left for him-  Can't eat, can't see- Can't hardly walk.

711
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,125
You aint got no gun-

712
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,200
Yes I have, I have a Luger right here in my bag.

713
00:48:32,234 --> 00:48:33,320
The way I'll shoot him, he won't feel nothin.

714
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,199
Maybe tomorrow-  Let's wait till tomorrow.

715
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,077
I don't see no sense in waitin. 

716
00:48:41,077 --> 00:48:44,480
Ya know, I aint got no hankerin for this- I'm a doin it for you.

717
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,629
What do you say, Candy?

718
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,437
Candy, you better let him go.

719
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:20,552
Alright.  You can take him. 

720
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,954
One of my lead mules has a bad hoof-  Gotta get some tar on it.

721
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,356
I bet Lennie's out there in the barn with his pup.

722
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,031
Yeah, bet  he won't ever come back in here, now that he's got a pup.

723
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,878
Anybody like to play a little Rummy?

724
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,194
I'll lay out a few with ya.

725
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,872
What's takin him so long?

726
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,432
Lay out some cards, why don't you- we get no Rummy played this way.

727
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,189
I am working!

728
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,388
Hey Slim, I think I better get that other brush.

729
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,196
Hey, Lennie- you gotta quit pettin that pup for the night- it aint good for him.

730
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,516
Put him back with his mother and run over to the bunkhouse.

731
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:22,911
I'll do whatever you say that's good for the pup, you bet- I'm goin right now.

732
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,839
Thanks for sendin the big guy out- I gotta talk to you.

733
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,195
You got nothin to say to me.

734
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,512
Please, Slim- I gotta talk to somebody-

735
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,111
or I'll go crazy ...Please-

736
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,237
I ain't meant to live like this.

737
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,194
I'd leave this place, only I've got no money.

738
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,268
My mother won't take me back.

739
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,149
I only married Curley to get away from her.

740
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:58,273
Maybe I ought not say this, but I don't like Curley.

741
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:05,429
No, you oughtn't.  You oughtn't be here. You ought not talk to me or any guy on the ranch.

742
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,517
Go on back to the house where you belong.

743
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,397
I don't want to listen to your troubles. 

744
00:54:17,397 --> 00:54:19,640
You got no troubles except what you bring on yourself.

745
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,349
Poor kid- I should've let her talk.

746
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,240
Any of you guys seen my wife?

747
00:55:02,275 --> 00:55:03,309
She ain't been here.

748
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,030
Where is Slim?

749
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,995
He went out to the barn. Said he had to put some tar on a split hoof.

750
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,685
How long ago did he go?

751
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,631
Oh- 5-10 minutes? I don't know.

752
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,192
I think I might like to see this.

753
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,595
Let's all take a look.

754
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,473
Curley must be spoilin-  He wouldn't start for Slim.

755
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,790
Curley thinks Slim's with his wife, don't he?

756
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,834
Yeah, it looks like it.  Course Slim ain't.

757
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,759
At least I don't think Slim is...  Come on!

758
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,032
Did you see Slim out there in the barn?

759
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,915
Yeah= He told me not to pet that pup no more tonight.

760
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,713
Did that girl come in there?

761
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,832
You mean, Curley's girl?

762
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,360
Yes, Curley's girl-  Did she come into the barn?

763
00:55:58,395 --> 00:56:00,191
Yeah, I seen her.

764
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,672
OK- I guess them guys ain't gonna see no fight.

765
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,909
Lennie.

766
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,909
If there is any fightin, are you gonna get out the way and stay out?

767
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,156
I ain't gonna say.

768
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,636
Lennie...

769
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,113
Both ends the same.  Why is both ends the same, George?

770
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,519
Because they just build em that way.

771
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,835
George...

772
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,595
What do you want?

773
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,916
How long is it gonna be before we get that little place, and live on the fat of the land?

774
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,715
I dont know. You gotta get a big stake together first.

775
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,311
I know a little place we can get cheap, but they ain't giving it away.

776
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,671
Tell about that place, George.

777
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,760
Now Lennie, I just told you just last night.

778
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:16,389
Ah, please ... tell again.

779
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,189
Alright;  Well, we have a couple of acres...

780
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,989
and there'll be a little windmill, and a little shack on it, and a chicken run.

781
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:32,034
Its got a kitchen orchard with cherries, apples, peaches, 'cots, nuts, ...

782
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,593
Its got a few berries, and a place for alfalfa, with plenty of water to flood it,

783
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,640
There's a pig pen ...

784
00:57:37,675 --> 00:57:38,675
And rabbits!

785
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,285
I could easy build a few hutches,

786
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,788
and you could feed alfalfa to those rabbits, now there.

787
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,916
They'd nibble and they'd nibble, like I've seen em do.

788
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,031
You know, we wouldn't have to sleep in no bunkhouse no more?

789
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,799
And nobody could fire us in the middle of a job.

790
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,550
Tell about the house, George.

791
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,036
Yeah, alright- We'd have a little house, and a room to ourselves,

792
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,679
And when we put that crop in, we'd be there to take that crop up.

793
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,397
And what else? Go on, George. You know more somethin else.

794
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:17,392
Alright, now wait a minute.  Yea, I know.

795
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,280
You know what? We could have a few pigeons...

796
00:58:19,315 --> 00:58:21,236
...to fly around the windmill.

797
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,828
Like they done when I was a kid.

798
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,036
And it'd be our own, and could nobody can us,

799
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:33,920
and if we didn't like a guy, we can say, "Git", and he'd have to do it.

800
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,600
But if a friend come, we'd have an extra bunk...

801
00:58:37,635 --> 00:58:38,845
And you know you would say? Huh?

802
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,792
We'd say, "Hey, why don't you spend the night?

803
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,236
And by golly, he would.

804
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:50,000
And we'd have a setter dog, a couple of striped cats-

805
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,980
You'd have to watch out them cats didn't get after the little rabbits.

806
00:58:54,980 --> 00:59:01,590
You just let em try- I'll break their neck.  I'll smash them cats right with a stick, that's what I'll do.

807
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,760
You know where's a place like that?

808
00:59:06,795 --> 00:59:07,795
What?

809
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,032
You know where's a place like that?

810
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,909
Suppose I do- What's that to you.

811
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,988
You don't have to tell me where its at, it might be anyplace.

812
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,192
Yeah, that's right.  Why, he couldn't find that in a 1000 years.

813
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,431
How much they want for a place like that?

814
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:27,358
I could get it for 600 bucks- the old people that own it are flat bust

815
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,678
.. the old lady needs medicine ...

816
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,830
Say- what's that to you- you got nothin to do with us-

817
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:40,318
I know I ain't much good with only one hand-

818
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,353
I lost my hand right here on the ranch when they give me a job swampin.

819
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,917
and they gave me $250 cause I lost my hand.

820
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,076
I got 50 more save up, so that'd be $300.

821
00:59:52,111 --> 00:59:54,712
and I got 40 more comin at the end of the month.

822
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,555
Tell you what- S'pose I went in with you guys.

823
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,960
That'd be $340 I'd put in...

824
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,754
How would it be?

825
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:12,197
No- I gotta think about that.

826
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,520
We was always gonna does it by ourselves- me and Lennie.

827
01:00:16,555 --> 01:00:17,565
I never thought about nobody else-

828
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:23,152
I'd make a will, and leave my share to you guys if I kicked off.

829
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,432
Maybe we could go there right now- You guys got any money?

830
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,958
Sure- we got ten bucks between us.

831
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:42,034
If me and Lennie worked a month and didn't spend nothing, we'd have $100.

832
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:50,311
That would make $440- I think we could swing her on that.

833
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:56,555
Maybe you and Lennie could go and get it started, and I could get a job to make up the rest.

834
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:03,640
I think we could swing it.  I think we could swing it.

835
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,037
I got hurt 4 years ago-

836
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,992
They'll can me pretty soon-

837
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,749
Just as soon as I can't swamp out no bunkhouses=

838
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,394
They'll put me on the county-

839
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,285
Maybe if I give you guys more money ...

840
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,153
you'll let me hoe in the garden, even after I ain't no good at it.

841
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,791
And I could wash dishes and do chicken stuff like that...

842
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,805
But it'd be at my own place.

843
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,400
And I'd be left to work at my own place.

844
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,673
You seen what they done to my dog, too.

845
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,605
They said he was no good to hisself, and nobody else

846
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:42,556
When they can me, I wish someone'd shoot me- They won't do nothing like that-

847
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:49,716
And I won't have no place to go- I can't get no more jobs.

848
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,878
We'll do 'er-  Candy, we'll do 'er.

849
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,435
Yes! We'll pick up that little ol' place, and we'll go live there.

850
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:18,714
And look- If there is a carnival or circus come to town, or ballgame, or anything like that, we'll go to it.

851
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,194
We wouldn't ask anybody if we could- 

852
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:25,280
We'd say- We'll go to it, and we would!  And we'd milk the cow, and we'd take the grain and

853
01:02:25,315 --> 01:02:26,000
we'd sling it to the chickens ... We could!

854
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,700
And put some grass to the rabbits! I wouldn't forget to do that!

855
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,870
When are we going to do it, George?

856
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,800
In one month- right smack in one month.

857
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:35,725
You know what I'm gonna do?

858
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,228
I'm gonna write those old people that own the place that we'll take 'er.

859
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,352
Maybe Candy'd give us 100 bucks to bind 'er?

860
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,877
I sure will.  I sure will.  I got it right here.

861
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,800
They got a good stove there?

862
01:02:46,835 --> 01:02:48,595
Yes, it's a nice stove, isn't it?

863
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,356
It burns both coal and wood.

864
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,000
You can have the whole $300 right now.

865
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:55,720
I'm goin to tell my pup- I bet he'd like it there!

866
01:02:55,755 --> 01:02:56,845
No, no, wait.

867
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,040
Now don't tell anybody about this.  Just us three and nobody else.

868
01:03:00,075 --> 01:03:04,045
Now you got that?  Cause they're liable to can us and we won't get no stake.

869
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,934
We just go on as if we were gonna buck barley for the rest of our lives.

870
01:03:07,969 --> 01:03:11,789
And then one day, all of a sudden, Bang!  We'll grab our pay and we'll scram.

871
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,110
Let's see, there's $300 right there.

872
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,112
And we won't tell nobody, George.

873
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,005
You bet we won't.

874
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,917
We won't tell nobody.

875
01:03:19,815 --> 01:03:21,040
George...

876
01:03:21,075 --> 01:03:22,711
Yes?

877
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:26,196
I shouldn't oughta let a stranger shoot my dog.

878
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,190
I'd have shot my dog myself, George.

879
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,039
Alright- Now you know.

880
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,110
I'm just askin- You don't have to get sore about it.

881
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:41,770
I aint sore about it- I don't want any more questions, that's all.

882
01:03:43,659 --> 01:03:45,360
Just don't want any more questions.

883
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,831
Well. I didn't mean nothin, Slim- I was just askin.

884
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,156
Well, you're askin too much- I'm gettin sick of it.

885
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:55,391
If you can't look after your own wife, what do you expect me to do about it? You lay off of me.

886
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,552
Now I'm just tryin to tell ya I didn't mean nothin.

887
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,365
I just thought you might've saw her.

888
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,550
Why don't you tell her stay home where she belongs?

889
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,111
You let her hang around the bunkhouse, first thing you know you'll have somethin on your hands.

890
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,159
You stay outta this.  Unless you want to step outside.

891
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:13,950
Why, ya palooka- You're as yella as the bottom side of a frog. If you ever come at me, I'd take your head off.

892
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,920
He tried to throw a scare into Slim, too, but he couldn't make it stick.  We seen it.

893
01:04:16,955 --> 01:04:18,194
Yeah- I seen him.

894
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,518
What do you think you're laughin at?  Get up on your feet.

895
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,519
No big lug is gonna laugh at me.

896
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,630
I'll show you who's dumb-

897
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,512
Put up your hand, Lennie!  Fight 'im back!

898
01:04:31,512 --> 01:04:33,680
Don't make me- Leave me alone!

899
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,910
Don't let him do it- Get him, Lennie!

900
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:37,874
Fight back, Lennie- You'll kill him if you fight back!

901
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,480
George!  Make him stop!

902
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,837
Put your hands up, Lennie!

903
01:04:40,872 --> 01:04:42,194
Fight him, why don't you, Lennie!

904
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,951
George!  George!

905
01:04:45,951 --> 01:04:46,440
Fight him, Lennie!

906
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:52,470
Get him-  I said get him!  Don't let him do that you ya, Lennie!  Get him!  Get him!

907
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,285
Let him go, Lennie- Let him go.

908
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:09,039
Lennie!  That's enough, Lennie - Let him go!

909
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,471
Lennie, let go of him.  Let go of his hand!

910
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,005
Get some water, Whit.

911
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:28,200
You told me to George- I heard you tell me to.

912
01:05:28,235 --> 01:05:29,030
Got a knife?

913
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,436
Looks to me like every bone in his hand is busted.

914
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,360
Carlson, get out the buckboard.  We'll have to get him to town to see a doctor.

915
01:05:48,395 --> 01:05:49,031
Right.

916
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,788
I didn't wanta-  I didn't want to hurt him!

917
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:55,991
Sh- alright, Lennie.

918
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,315
Wasn't your fault, Lennie.   He sure had it coming to him.

919
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:04,035
Slim- Are George and Lennie gonna get canned now?

920
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,873
Is his old man gonna can them now?

921
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,073
I don't know.

922
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,277
You got your senses enough to listen?

923
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:17,108
Now you listen- I think you got your hand caught in a machine.

924
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,030
If you don't tell nobody what happened, we won't.

925
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,085
If you do tell and try to get this guy canned, 

926
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:29,556
We'll tell everybody.  Then will you get to laugh.

927
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,555
I won't tell

928
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,798
Whoah, Nelly.

929
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,753
Say, this is a swell joint.

930
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:21,440
What did I tell you? Just can get a shot heree for just 15 cents, and no water in the whisky, neither.

931
01:07:21,475 --> 01:07:22,713
Hiya, Whit!

932
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:23,952
Susie!

933
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,315
Get your coats on girls, it's the sheriff.

934
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:32,959
Hey, George- shake hands with Susie- Shes' a card- Always crackin jokes.

935
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,549
--Hi. -- Hello

936
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,220
Sit down-

937
01:07:36,255 --> 01:07:37,487
Boys, sit down.

938
01:07:37,522 --> 01:07:38,685
Take a weight of your feet.

939
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,440
You boys know Pops.

940
01:07:40,475 --> 01:07:42,795
(Carlson) I'll pop you.

941
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,597
This one here's Marlene Dietrich.

942
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,120
Ah now, Susie- You know I don't look much like Dietrich.

943
01:07:49,155 --> 01:07:50,599
You look nothin like her.

944
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,399
And that's Hedy Lamarr-

945
01:07:52,434 --> 01:07:53,879
And that's Greta Garbo ...

946
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,957
I want to be alone ...

947
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:01,355
See- What'd I tell you, George?  Aint she a laugh?  She can keep it up all night.

948
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,396
What's that?

949
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,712
A posey for getting nosey...

950
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,150
What's so funny?

951
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:15,520
Why don't you take a walk?  Nobody's talkin about you.  Drink up, pie-faced pal.

952
01:08:15,555 --> 01:08:16,839
Be sure you don't

953
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,675
What's eatin him?

954
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:25,715
Say- I bet he came down here special to see that nobody talks about what happened last night.

955
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,085
What did happen?

956
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:31,079
No, nothing. He won't be satisfied till he's slugged somebody tonight.

957
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,278
He didn't do so good the last time.

958
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,471
I ain't even gonna get a chance, cause I ain't stayin long.

959
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,799
What's your hurry?

960
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,400
Lennie's at the ranch.  I don't like to leave him alone very long.

961
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:51,639
You got no right to come into my room.  I ain't wanted in the bunkhouse, and you ain't wanted in my room.

962
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,629
Why ain't you wanted?

963
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:01,472
Because I'm black.  They play cards in there, but I can't play cause I'm black.

964
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:07,160
Everybody's gone to town.   George says I gotta stay here 

965
01:09:07,195 --> 01:09:10,391
and not get in no trouble-  I seen your light.

966
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,230
Don't see what you'd do in the bar anyway.

967
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,273
My pup-  I just come in to see my pup.

968
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:29,440
Come on in and sit a while.  As long as you won't get out and let me alone-

969
01:09:29,475 --> 01:09:31,112
Might as well come in and sit down.

970
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,839
All the boys gone to town. huh?

971
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:52,679
Everybody but ol' Candy.. He just sits in the bunkhouse sharpenin his pencils.

972
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:58,160
Sharpenin and figurin.  And sharpenin.  And figurin.

973
01:09:58,195 --> 01:10:00,674
Figurin?  What's Candy figurin about?

974
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,319
About the rabbits!

975
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,405
In the bunkhouse.  What rabbits you talkin about.

976
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:09,149
About the rabbits we're gonna get.    And I get to tend em.

977
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:14,668
That's baloney.  I don't blame the guy you travelin with to keep you outta sight.

978
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,398
You think its a lie, but we're gonna do it.

979
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:23,356
We're gonna get a little place, and live on the fat of the land.

980
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,432
You can ask George.

981
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,200
You've been travelin around with that guy a long time, haven't you?

982
01:10:29,235 --> 01:10:30,394
Sure.

983
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,839
Sometimes, George talks to you, you don't know what he's talkin about.

984
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,356
Ain't that so?  Ain't that so?

985
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:45,238
Yeah- sometimes

986
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:54,991
George knows what he's about.  Just tells you things, it don't matter to him if you understand or not.

987
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:07,271
It's just havin someone to talk to.  It's just bein with another guy.  That's why he travels around wit you.

988
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,797
Sure- Him and me goes everyplace together.

989
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,710
Suppose George didn't come back no more.  Suppose he took a powder, and he ain't coming back.  What'd you do then?

990
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:25,871
Imagine going out and not coming back. What would you do then?

991
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,085
What? What?

992
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,715
Suppose George went to town tonight and you never heard of him no more.  Just suppose that.

993
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:35,829
He won't do that!  George won't go leave me!  He'll come back!

994
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,955
Don't you think he will?

995
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:47,800
Do you want me to tell what'd happen?  They'd take you to a booby-hatch.

996
01:11:47,835 --> 01:11:54,273
They will tie you up with a collar like a dog.  Then you'd be just like me.  Livin in a kennel.

997
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,600
You hurt George!

998
01:12:04,635 --> 01:12:05,845
I was just supposin- George ain't hurt!

999
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:09,873
What are you supposin for?  Ain't nobody gonna suppose no hurt to George!

1000
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:17,152
Of course they ain't.  But maybe you can see now.  You got George.

1001
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:21,839
You know he's comin back.  Suppose you didn't have nobody.

1002
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,950
Suppose you can't go to the bunkhouse and play Rummy cause you're black.

1003
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,995
Suppose you have to sit out here and read books.

1004
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:33,598
Books ain't no good.  A guy needs somebody to talk to him.

1005
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:37,357
I tell you if you get too lonely, you get sick.

1006
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:48,874
George won't go away and leave me.  I know George won't do that.

1007
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,789
Lennie...

1008
01:12:52,789 --> 01:12:55,150
Lennie...

1009
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:59,311
Look, Lennie- I've been figurin out something about the place.

1010
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,279
You can come on in if you want.

1011
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,832
Oh, I don't know.  Course if you want me to-

1012
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:16,551
Oh, come on in.  Everybody's comin in- You might just as well.  Gettin to be like a racetrack.

1013
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:24,405
Nice cozy little place you got here.

1014
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,795
Must be nice to have a room all to yourself this way.

1015
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:32,478
Sure ... and a dung heap under my window.   All to myself.

1016
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,918
About the place-  You said about the place.

1017
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:42,800
I got it all figured out.  We can make some real money on them rabbits, if we go about it right.

1018
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:45,553
But I get to tend them-  George says I get to tend them.

1019
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,751
You guys just kiddin yourselves.

1020
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,993
You'll be a swamper here till they take you out in a box.

1021
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:55,314
I seen hundreds of guys come by on the road, knowin ranches.  

1022
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,070
Figures on the back and same fool thing in their head.

1023
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:04,150
Everyone's got a little piece of land in his head, and never a one of them gets it.

1024
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,645
We are, too.

1025
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:11,437
It's just like heaven.  Nobody ever gets to heaven.  And nobody gets no land.

1026
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:16,392
Well, we're gonna do it.  George says we are.  He's got the money right now.

1027
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:18,765
He's got the money?

1028
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,999
Well, he's got most of it- There's just a little bit more to get.  And George's got the land picked out, too.

1029
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,276
Now, you take 12 rabbits.

1030
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:35,589
I never seen a guy really do it.  I've seen guys most crazy with loneliness for land-

1031
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,630
But every time a dame or a blackjack game took it away from him.

1032
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,612
Well, they ain't gonna get it this time.

1033
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,472
Let's go to Chuck's Roadhouse.  I got twenty bucks left.

1034
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:49,989
Whatever I got, that goes for me, too.  Monday starts another month- Yippee!

1035
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:57,992
Twelve rabbits

1036
01:14:57,992 --> 01:15:02,360
At six months

1037
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,670
If you guys would want a hand to work for nothing, 

1038
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:12,957
just for his keep, I'd come and lend a hand.  I ain't so crippled I can't work like a mischief.

1039
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,000
Well, alright, but we gotta talk to George about that.

1040
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,200
Now- You take 12 rabbits.

1041
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,189
12 rabbits ...

1042
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,073
Different color rabbits

1043
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:28,000
Sure, sure.  Twelve rabbits and six months time...

1044
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,800
Uh- got that right here.

1045
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,272
For a second there, George, I thought that little place you told me about was a goner.

1046
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,593
It's off-  Ain't nothin gonna stop us now.

1047
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
There's a meetin here tonight-  There's a meetin here tonight..

1048
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I know you by your daily walk- There's a meetin here tonight. (Repeats)

1049
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:19,360
I told em that they ought not be here, but they come in anyhow.

1050
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:23,079
Couldn't go to bed like I told you, could you Lennie.

1051
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,154
No- You have to get out in society and flap your big mouth.

1052
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,593
I never done nothin bad, George, honest.

1053
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,117
Look, George. I've been figurin and figurin

1054
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:36,074
I've even got it doped out how we can make some money on them rabbits.

1055
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,873
I thought you wasn't gonna tell nobody.

1056
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,000
I didn't tell nobody but Crooks.

1057
01:16:43,035 --> 01:16:44,353
What'd you tell him for?

1058
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,960
Look, George, Crooks says that if we let him come in with us...

1059
01:16:47,995 --> 01:16:49,365
Get outta here, both of you.

1060
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,765
But George, Crooks said he'll work...

1061
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,598
Maybe you better go- I ain't sure I want in no more.

1062
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,758
Listen, Crooks. It ain't nothin against you.

1063
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,840
It's just that we said that we wouldn't tell nobody else.

1064
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:07,751
I know. Them guys comin in here, set and made me forget.

1065
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:19,956
I suppose you're lookin for Curley.  Well Curley ain't here.

1066
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:26,435
I know Curley ain't here.  It's Saturday night, isn't it?  Got his arm in a sling, and he went anyhow.

1067
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,080
I come to ask Crooks something.

1068
01:17:30,115 --> 01:17:31,911
You don't want to ask me nothing.

1069
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,950
Saturday night! Everybody's out doin something.

1070
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:40,758
What am I doin?  Standin here, talkin to a bunch of bindlestiffs.

1071
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:44,277
You ain't wanted here.  We told ya

1072
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,878
You ain't got sense enough in that chicken head to see that we ain't stiffs.

1073
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:54,470
You do not know that we got our own ranch to go to.  And our own house.  We ain't gotta stay here.

1074
01:17:54,760 --> 01:18:01,677
We gotta house, we got chickens, we got fruit trees, and we got a place that's 100 times bettern this. And we got friends.

1075
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:04,196
That's what we got. We got friends.

1076
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,993
You old goat.

1077
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:10,952
If you had two bits, you'd be in town gettin a drink and suckin the bottom of the glass.

1078
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,074
I know you guys.

1079
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:16,438
Maybe she'll ask Crooks what she come to ask, and then get home.

1080
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,352
What happened to Curley's hand?

1081
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,753
So it wasn't a machine.  Curley didn't act like he was tellin the truth.

1082
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,680
Cmon Crooks, what happened?

1083
01:18:29,715 --> 01:18:31,005
I wasn't there.  Didn't see it.

1084
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:36,560
What happened? I won't let on to Curley.  He said he caught it in a gear.  Who done it?

1085
01:18:36,595 --> 01:18:37,913
Nobody done it.

1086
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:42,360
So you done it.  Well, he had it comin.

1087
01:18:42,395 --> 01:18:43,952
I didn't have no fuss with Curley.

1088
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:50,350
Maybe now you ain't scared of him no more.  Maybe you'll talk to me sometimes.  Everybody was scared of him.

1089
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:54,000
Say- I didn't sock Curley.  If Curley had any trouble, its none of our affair.

1090
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Ask Curley about it.

1091
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,873
Look- I'm gonna try to tell you somethin.  I tried to tell you to get out-  That didn't do no good.

1092
01:19:02,873 --> 01:19:04,240
So I'm gonna try to tell you in another way-

1093
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:09,075
Now you see- Us guys got somethin that we're gonna do.

1094
01:19:09,075 --> 01:19:10,680
But if you stick around, you're gonna gum up the works.

1095
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:14,000
It ain't your fault, but

1096
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:20,200
Look- If a fella steps on a round pebble, and falls down and breaks his neck, it ain't the pebble's fault.

1097
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,475
But the guy wouldn't of done it if the pebble hadn't been there.

1098
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,991
What are you talking about pebbles for?  If you didn't sock Curley, who did?

1099
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,670
Nobody socked Curley.  He got his hand caught in a machine.

1100
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,633
Where did you get them bruises on your face?

1101
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,432
He caught his hand in a machine.

1102
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:49,159
So it was you. Maybe you're dumb like they say ya are, and maybe you're the only guy on the ranch with nerve.

1103
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,549
You're a nice fella.

1104
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:56,317
Listen!  I've tried to give you a break, but I'm not gonna let you mess up what we're gonna do.

1105
01:19:56,317 --> 01:19:57,040
You let that guy alone, and you get outta here.

1106
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:01,640
You won't tell me what to do- I got a right to talk to anybody I want!

1107
01:20:01,675 --> 01:20:02,709
MIlton!

1108
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:26,594
You couldn't hardly wait for your pup to get home from his night's drunk  so's you could snitch on me, could ya?

1109
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:32,875
But you didn't tell him what I know to tell him.

1110
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,518
Who busted your hand, Curley?

1111
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,335
I told you I caught it in a machine.

1112
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:41,990
I saw that machine last night.

1113
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,157
I told ya.

1114
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,192
And why didn't you tell your old man, so he could can him?

1115
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:46,725
Double crossing...

1116
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:51,515
I'll tell you why. Cause you was scared that if you talked, they'd talk, too.

1117
01:20:52,160 --> 01:21:01,910
You were scared to get the horse laugh- Like I'm givin you now.  There's a pug with a crippled hand.

1118
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,074
I ain't even gonna slug ya.

1119
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:12,039
I'm goin upstairs and pack your junk.  You're gettin outa here.  You and me are through.

1120
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:18,352
One, two!  The ol' one, two.

1121
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:39,790
Toothpick?

1122
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:41,680
That sure was a good breakfast, George.

1123
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,117
Probably the last one we'll get in this place.

1124
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,916
George - Slim says not to worry.  He's went to talk to the boss.

1125
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,190
If you'd only stayed in your place like I told you.

1126
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:55,789
George- DId you send off the money when you was in town last night?

1127
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,615
How many times do I have to tell you? You guys drive me crazy.

1128
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:02,750
Don't get sore, George.  I only asked ya...  George-

1129
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:03,876
What?

1130
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,793
Did you have fun in town?

1131
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:09,530
We just sat around.

1132
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:15,290
Susie was crackin jokes.  Guys was just startin out to raise a little puny cain.

1133
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,620
I never been like this in my life.

1134
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:23,370
You know, just pushing out a dime and a nickel to buy a drink-

1135
01:22:24,365 --> 01:22:27,276
and I think what a lot of carrot seed you can get for 15 cents.

1136
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:32,440
Not to belittle you and all, but bulk seed, you sure can.

1137
01:22:32,475 --> 01:22:35,113
Seeds-  I can't think of nothin else.

1138
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:41,435
Well, a guy's gotta have some fun.  I went to a dance hall in Bakersfield once.

1139
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:48,879
What a place!  Went upstairs on a red carpet-  There's big pictures on the wall.

1140
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:55,156
So I went and sat in a big soft chair.  There was cigarettes on the table, and they was free.

1141
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:59,874
Pretty soon a chap comes in with drinks on a tray, and them drinks was free.

1142
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:05,189
You could take all you want.  Pretty soon a girl comes in.  Said she was hostess.

1143
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:14,350
She was so polite and nice, quiet and pretty, it made me scared to ask her for a dance.  That was a long time ago.

1144
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,198
Are you sayin all this was free?

1145
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,632
Right up till I was leavin.

1146
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,628
And then how much did them soft chairs set you back?

1147
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:25,759
15 bucks.

1148
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:32,031
You had a cigarette and a drink and a look at a pretty dress, and that cost you 15 bucks?

1149
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,517
You just shot a week's pay to walk on the red carpet.

1150
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:40,834
A week's pay?  Sure.  But I worked weeks all my life.

1151
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:49,394
I don't remember none of them weeks- but this, nearly 20 years ago, I remember that.

1152
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:57,630
The girl I met was named Arline, with had a pink silk dress.

1153
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:03,669
Well, its OK.  You guys ain't gonna get canned.

1154
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,485
You sure, Slim?

1155
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,114
Lucky for you, the boss has to move that grain.

1156
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,630
I bet Curley's wife catches it, though.

1157
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:30,231
I went clear out the gate, then I remembered your foolish little face.  You're comin with me.

1158
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,678
Whatcha coverin up there?

1159
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:57,157
Just my pup.  Just my little ol pup.

1160
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,394
He's dead.

1161
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:08,100
He was so little- I was just playin with him and he made like he was gonna bite me

1162
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:13,000
And then I made like I was gonna smack him, and

1163
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,120
and then he was dead.

1164
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:21,100
But don't worry none- He was just a mutt.

1165
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:24,760
You'll get another one easy- The whole country's full of mutts.

1166
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:30,000
Yeah- It ain't that so much.  George said if I done any more bad things

1167
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,550
Wait a minute, where are you going?

1168
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:41,671
I ain't gonna have nothin to do with you.  George said I ain't to talk to you nor nothin.

1169
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:45,354
Listen- Don't worry about talkin to me.

1170
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,312
You know those guys yellin out there?  They got a tournament.

1171
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:52,990
None of em aint gonna leave till its over, and it aint gonna be over till dark.

1172
01:25:54,290 --> 01:26:00,340
I ain't supposed to.  George sees me talkin to you, he's gonna be mad.  He told me so.

1173
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,518
What's the matter with me?  I ain't got the right to talk to nobody?

1174
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,605
George says you're gonna get us in a mess.

1175
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:13,158
What harm am I doin to you?  Seems like they ain't none of them cares how I gotta live.

1176
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:23,309
Confidentially, I'm goin away from here.

1177
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,437
I gotta make somethin outta myself yet.  I ain't used to livin like this.

1178
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,672
I come from Salinas.  Come there when I was a kid.

1179
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:36,599
 There was a show comin through there once, and I met one of the actors.

1180
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,037
We're gonna have a little place, and rabbits.

1181
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:43,510
He said he was going to put me in a movie - Says I was a natural.

1182
01:26:44,111 --> 01:26:48,641
Soon's he got back to Hollywood, he was gonna write me about it-  You listenin?

1183
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:54,320
I never got that letter.  I always thought my old lady stole it.

1184
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:57,940
I wasn't gonna stay in a place where you couldn't get nowhere.

1185
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:01,182
or make somethin outta yourself, or they stole your letters.

1186
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:05,170
I asked her if she stole them, too, and she said "no".

1187
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:11,830
so I married Curley and went to the Riverside Dance Palace that same night.

1188
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:15,597
I sure hope George ain't gonna be mad about that there pup.

1189
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:23,310
I do not like Curley- I'll leave him.  I'm gonna thumb a ride to Hollywood.

1190
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,278
We goin away from here pretty soon.  This ain't no nice place.

1191
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:33,429
I'm gonna get in the movies, and wear all them nice clothes.

1192
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:35,780
I want nice clothes like they wear.

1193
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,840
And I'll set in them big hotels and they'll take pictures of me.

1194
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:42,920
When they have them opens, I'll go and talk on the radio.

1195
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,440
and it won't cost me nothin because I'm in the picture.

1196
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:50,720
I want nice clothes like they wear.  This guy says I'm a natural.

1197
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:56,558
We goin away.  Far away from here.

1198
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:02,311
Course, when my ol lady hears I run away from Curley, she won't ever speak to me no more.

1199
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:08,394
She'll think that I aint decent, that's what she'll think.  Well, we ain't really decent-

1200
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:14,118
no matter what my ol lady tries to hide.  My ol man was a drunk- They put im away.

1201
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,596
One night when I was just a little kid, him and my ol lady had a terrible fight.

1202
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,672
They was always fightin.

1203
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:26,718
In the middle of the night he come into my room and he says- "let's you and me run away".

1204
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:34,272
He says we gonna live together.  We gonna live together cause you're my own little girl.

1205
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:41,719
Why, you'll bake little cakes for me, and I'll paint pretty pictures all over the wall.

1206
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,550
And in the mornin, they caught us and put him away.

1207
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:57,473
Uh - I wish I woulda went.

1208
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:06,435
They locked him up for drunk, and in a little while, he died.

1209
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:13,120
Maybe if I took that there pup and throwed him away, George wouldn't never know.

1210
01:29:13,155 --> 01:29:15,793
Then maybe I could tend the rabbits without no trouble.

1211
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:17,989
You're goofy.

1212
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:21,718
No I ain't.  George says I aint.

1213
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:26,352
I just like to pet nice things- Smooth things.

1214
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,109
Well, who don't?  Everybody likes that.

1215
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,877
I like the feel of silk and velvet! You like the feel of velvet?

1216
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:38,620
You bet by golly.  I had some, too.  A lady give it to me.

1217
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:41,560
Aunt Clara-  She give it right to me.

1218
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:46,620
About this big a piece.  I wish I had that velvet right now.

1219
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:54,410
I ain't seen it for a long time.  I musta lost it.

1220
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:56,790
You're goofy.

1221
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,880
But you're kind of a nice fella.  Just like a big baby.

1222
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:04,360
A person can kinda see what you mean-

1223
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:09,420
Sometimes, when I'm doin my hair, I just sit there and stroke it cause its so soft.

1224
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:14,693
Some people got kinda coarse hair- You take Curley.

1225
01:30:15,193 --> 01:30:19,828
His hair is just like wire-  Mine's soft and fine.

1226
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:21,940
Here- feel.

1227
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:24,873
Right here.

1228
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Don't you muss it up.

1229
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,000
You're messing it up - Ow!

1230
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Stop and let go!

1231
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,200
Please- Please don't yell-  George is gonna say I done a bad thing!

1232
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:48,873
Don't do that! You're gonna get me in trouble just like George says you will!

1233
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,269
Lennie!

1234
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:54,795
Lennie!

1235
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:23,500
George is gonna be pretty mad at him taking that pup out.

1236
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:28,677
Slim says I can have one of you guys

1237
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:47,320
I'll ask im.

1238
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:52,000
Oh, Slim-

1239
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,740
It's OK, Candy-

1240
01:33:01,930 --> 01:33:03,580
Your old dog wouldn't mind.

1241
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:08,040
Lonesome for a guy, without a dog.

1242
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:09,940
He'll have a lot of fun at our little place.

1243
01:33:10,095 --> 01:33:11,520
Sure he could. 

1244
01:33:11,555 --> 01:33:12,325
You seen Lennie in the barn?

1245
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:14,365
His pup wasn't there.

1246
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,517
He must be out playin with him some place.  Now don't be mad with him, George.

1247
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:21,112
I gotta get him or he won't remember to get any supper.

1248
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:30,993
Candy! Did that dog follow you out of the barn?  Come on!

1249
01:33:55,520 --> 01:34:00,150
What done it?  George- What done it?

1250
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:06,800
I should have know'd it.

1251
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:10,920
I think way back in my head, I did.

1252
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:13,150
What are we gonna do, George? What are we going to do now?

1253
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:18,997
We can't let him get away.

1254
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:24,460
No- we oughta let him get away.  You don't know about Curley- Curley's gonna wanna get him lynched.  Curley's gonna kill him.

1255
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:27,558
Yes, that's right-  Curley will, and the other guys

1256
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:38,792
You and me get that little place, won't we George?  You and me can go there, and live nice.

1257
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,794
Can't we George?  ...  Can't we?

1258
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:49,959
It's all off, I know...  It's all off.

1259
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:57,565
He was such a nice fella I didn't think he'd do nothin like this.

1260
01:34:57,620 --> 01:35:01,960
Lennie never done it outa meanness.  All the times he done bad things, he never done one of em mean!

1261
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:16,040
I ain't gonna let em hurt Lennie.

1262
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:20,290
Listen- I'm goin over to the bunkhouse.

1263
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:25,589
Then in a minute you come out and tell the guys about her.  I'll come along and make out like I never seen here.  Will you do that?

1264
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:26,740
Sure, George.

1265
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:30,080
Give me a minute, and you come out and yell like you just found her.

1266
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:31,870
Okay, okay ...

1267
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:46,795
Ya done it, didn't ya.  I suppose you're gonna act- Everybody knows you'd messed things up.

1268
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:51,050
You wasn't no good.  And you ain't no good now.

1269
01:35:52,660 --> 01:36:00,340
I could have hoe'd the garden, washed the dishes for them guys. Could'a had pigs, and chickens

1270
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:04,310
And in the winter ... the little fat stove.

1271
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:10,250
with the wind, and the rain comin- And us just sittin there.

1272
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:24,876
Hey! Hey! Hey you guys!

1273
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,000
Someone's murdered Curley's wife.

1274
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:43,960
What?

1275
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:15,740
I know who done it.  That big guy done it-  I know he done it.

1276
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:17,710
Why, everyone else was out there playin horseshoes.

1277
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:19,560
Hey- My Luger's gone- it ain't in my bag.

1278
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:20,930
Maybe you lost it.

1279
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:24,760
No- I seen it there this mornin.  It's been took.
Then he's armed.

1280
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:29,560
Listen, Mr. Jackson. The poor guy didn't know what he was doin.  Tell them not to shoot him.

1281
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:35,650
Shoot him? He got Carlson's gun, eh?  Sure, I'm gonna shoot him.  I'm gonna get him myself.

1282
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:37,660
Here they are, Mr. Jackson.

1283
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:46,220
I suppose we couldn't let him get away?

1284
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:47,540
Not a chance.

1285
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,760
Couldn't we bring him in, and then lock him up safe?

1286
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:56,020
If we could only keep Curley here.  But you heard him- He's still mad about his hand.

1287
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:02,130
Supposin they catch him.  They'll bring him back, strap him down,

1288
01:38:02,260 --> 01:38:06,240
then lock him up in a cage ... That's ain't no good, George.

1289
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:08,870
I know it...  I know it.

1290
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:12,430
Got any idea where he mighta went?

1291
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:17,470
I think there's only one way to get Lennie outa this.

1292
01:39:34,190 --> 01:39:35,730
You want I should go away?

1293
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:39,520
I'll be close by.

1294
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:52,120
Lennie?

1295
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:58,160
You see, George? I come right back here, just like you told me.

1296
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:01,650
You wasn't gonna go away and leave me, was you, George?

1297
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,720
I heard them guys walking through the woods ...

1298
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:09,170
What was them guys doin in the woods, George?

1299
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:13,210
Huntin ...

1300
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:17,350
Why don't we go with them?  I like huntin.

1301
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:24,420
Is it- cause I done a bad thing?

1302
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:29,079
That don't make no difference.

1303
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,040
Is that why we can't go huntin with them guys.

1304
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:34,490
That don't make no difference.

1305
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:43,810
George, ... Ain't you gonna ball me out?

1306
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:46,630
will you have it?

1307
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,720
Sure- like you always done.

1308
01:40:49,890 --> 01:40:55,790
Like if I didn't have you, I could take my 50 bucks,

1309
01:40:55,980 --> 01:40:59,780
Lennie, you can't never remember nothin that happens

1310
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:03,998
but you remember every word I say, don't you.

1311
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:10,159
Ain't you gonna say it?  Go on, George- Say it.

1312
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:18,460
If I was alone- I could live so easy-

1313
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:24,180
could get me a job ... never have no mess.

1314
01:41:24,390 --> 01:41:25,920
... And when the end of the month comes

1315
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:31,476
... and when the end of the month comes, I'd take my 50 bucks

1316
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:57,680
Go on, George. Tell how its gonna be.

1317
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:05,660
Lennie- I want for you to sit down there.

1318
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:10,980
And I want for you to look across that river-

1319
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:15,510
... cause I'm gonna tell you like you could almost see it.

1320
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:22,440
Go on, George.

1321
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,280
We're gonna have a little place-
We're gonna have a little place-

1322
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,360
We're gonna have cows, pigs and chickens.

1323
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:36,120
And down on the flat, we're gonna have a field of alfalfa.

1324
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:39,410
- For the rabbits ... 
- For the rabbits.

1325
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:40,880
And I get to tend the rabbits?

1326
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:43,060
Tend the rabbits.

1327
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:47,380
