1
00:00:17,945 --> 00:00:20,322
Don't be such a sore head Joey

2
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,407
I was only teasing

3
00:00:23,283 --> 00:00:26,120
I did not mean to drop
a bat on your head

4
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:29,305
Anyways I didn't think it
would hurt so much

5
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:32,584
Oh yeah.  It hurts every time you throw it.

6
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:41,640
subtitles by sixsnobs

7
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:57,900
That's Lennie.  He's my big brother

8
00:00:58,151 --> 00:01:00,069
He's twelve today.

9
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:03,656
That's his birthday present,
the harmonica.

10
00:01:04,073 --> 00:01:06,200
Lennie is a good harmonica player

11
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:08,953
He's a good baseball player too.

12
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,166
He shouldn't got no birthday present
'cause for all the time he's teasing me

13
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,795
not even lets me touch
his harmonica

14
00:01:18,463 --> 00:01:19,881
That's my kid brother Joey

15
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:21,841
 Everyone says quickety kisses

16
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:23,634
oh go ahead, kiss him

17
00:01:24,343 --> 00:01:25,678
Joey isn't so bad

18
00:01:25,845 --> 00:01:27,597
but he's a pain in the
neck in the summer

19
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:30,516
on account of my mom working
I take care of him.

20
00:01:30,683 --> 00:01:33,060
Boy am I glad it's Saturday.

21
00:01:33,853 --> 00:01:37,190
Joey's smart for his age,
especially about horses.

22
00:01:37,356 --> 00:01:39,317
He don't hardly think
a nottin' else.

23
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:42,403
only in ya whole life you
never met a kid

24
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:44,614
that happened to be so
crazy about horses.

25
00:01:46,657 --> 00:01:48,659
Come on let's play ball.

26
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:51,612
Okay, but anyways you
don't have to grab

27
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:53,498
Let me play Lennie

28
00:01:53,873 --> 00:01:55,833
You play with us?

29
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:57,919
Okay, take your gun off.

30
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,796
I don't want to take it off.
Don't play!

31
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:02,506
I want to play!

32
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:05,883
Okay, come on.

33
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:13,600
Wanta get a lick Lennie?
Okay, Harry.

34
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:16,978
 I want to be up first.
Listen to him.

35
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:19,147
You play in the out field pest.

36
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:20,314
Way out!  Not fun!

37
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:34,162
Hey Charley!

38
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,914
How many times you been up?

39
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,457
Ahh Fifteen.

40
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,417
I ain't been up yet.

41
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,419
those paws without butter fingers?

42
00:02:41,837 --> 00:02:43,738
You didn't hit anything to me.

43
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,424
Here's one Joey.

44
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,635
I got it. I'm up.

45
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:50,929
Come on, guys.  Let's knock off.

46
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
What say Lennie?

47
00:02:52,764 --> 00:02:55,524
It's my turn, my turn.

48
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:57,394
Oh, why should I worry about him?

49
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:59,229
You didn't give me a turn.

50
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,732
Boy I'm hot.

51
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:05,944
I hope its even hotter tomorrow
when we go to Coney Island.

52
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,654
Hey fellas, I almost forgot.

53
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:12,116
Look at this!

54
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:14,660
They're real!

55
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,979
Sure, my mom gave it
to me for my birthday.

56
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:18,289
to spend on Coney.

57
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:20,082
Wow, we can all go on a parachute!

58
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:21,584
Where do you get that all stuff?

59
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,378
Means I can go on the
parachute, plenty of times.

60
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,088
Give me the ball.

61
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:28,966
I'm going to practise throwing
so I can win a prize tomorrow.

62
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:31,469
You know where you
knock the bottles down.

63
00:03:31,635 --> 00:03:34,263
Oh yeah. I think I
know the place.

64
00:03:36,307 --> 00:03:37,767
Come on fellas.

65
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,187
Good shot!

66
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:43,564
Nice throwin'.

67
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:44,982
Let me try.

68
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:47,526
What for?  You don't need no practise.

69
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:49,779
You ain't going to Coney with us.

70
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:53,282
Just 'coz Joey ain't even old enough to
come with us you don't have to rub it in.

71
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:56,368
Huh! I suppose you won't be glad
have him as a pet for a whole day.

72
00:03:56,994 --> 00:03:59,288
Sure I will but you
don't have to rub it in.

73
00:03:59,455 --> 00:04:01,791
Please Lennie, let me try.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,211
Okay, knock 'em down

75
00:04:10,215 --> 00:04:11,299
See, Stay!

76
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:13,468
Do you think the Dodgers
would hire him Harry?

77
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:15,095
He'd play for the giants.

78
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:16,763
Come on fellas,
I got to go.

79
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,099
Yeah, we better go too.
Come on Joey.

80
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:30,276
Ma! Ma!

81
00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:34,489
Ma, Lennie's teasing me!

82
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:36,741
Quiet, l'm on long distance.

83
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:39,619
Have you had the doctor?

84
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:41,663
Are you sure that's what it is?

85
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:44,040
Or what he thinks.

86
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:46,584
Of course, of course.

87
00:04:47,794 --> 00:04:49,712
You got to have someone ...

88
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,090
Did you call Helen?

89
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:53,924
Oh ...

90
00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:57,554
All right.

91
00:04:57,929 --> 00:04:58,929
Ma!

92
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:01,641
Shut up, mom
is on long distance.

93
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:02,976
What's the matter mom?

94
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:05,687
Grandmother is very sick boys.
I've got to go to her.

95
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:08,898
Is grandma going to die ma?

96
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:10,775
Shut up you dope.

97
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:12,485
Don't worry ma, she'll be okay.

98
00:05:13,194 --> 00:05:16,656
I will only be gone as able.
I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.

99
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,825
Tomorrow afternoon?
You mean you're going today?

100
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,160
Yes dear.

101
00:05:21,326 --> 00:05:23,704
I'm making a 2 o'clock train.

102
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:26,165
But mom..  Come on!

103
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:29,543
Who's going to take care of Joey tomorrow?
You'll have to.

104
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:30,919
But mom ...

105
00:05:32,337 --> 00:05:35,841
Aw, tomorrow's when I'm supposed to go
with the fellas to Coney Island.

106
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:37,843
My birthday present.

107
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,604
I don't want to take Joey with me.
No Dear.

108
00:05:40,763 --> 00:05:43,348
Joey can't go to Coney Island.
Neither can you.

109
00:05:43,724 --> 00:05:46,042
I'm sorry Lennie, but this is an emergency.

110
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:48,103
Why can't I go mom?

111
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:49,897
Why can't Joey stay home alone?

112
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:51,774
I don't want to stay home alone.

113
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:55,194
If your father were alive,
things would different

114
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,810
But you're the man
of the family now.

115
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,614
I don't want to be the man
of the family.

116
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:01,241
I want to go to Coney Island
with the fellas.

117
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:03,869
You don't want. You want.

118
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:07,331
You think I'm going to work every day
in a department store,

119
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:11,543
and stand on my feet behind a counter
at Polancer and Keethouse.

120
00:06:11,752 --> 00:06:13,253
But I got to do it
or we don't eat.

121
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:16,173
And you got to stay home
with Joey tomorrow.

122
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:17,716
Don't look like that.

123
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,761
It's not such a big sacrifice.

124
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:24,013
You go to Coney Island some other time.

125
00:06:24,388 --> 00:06:26,557
Come on have your lunch Lennie.

126
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:32,521
Oh Lennie!

127
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:35,358
See that Joey gets to bed on time tonight.

128
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:37,652
And you stay in with him.

129
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,826
Lennie. I am leaving you a
shopping list with six dollars

130
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:46,994
A five and a one.

131
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:49,747
Make sure you get the right
change for the five now.

132
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:51,791
Don't forget.  Promise.

133
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:56,379
And remember Mrs. Carlson is always
home, in case anything happens.

134
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:10,852
Roses are red,
violets are blue,

135
00:07:11,018 --> 00:07:14,689
I can't go to Coney Island
and you can't too.

136
00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:29,577
Lennie!

137
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:32,164
If it's nice tomorrow,
I think Joey to get some air.

138
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,041
I don't want you both cooped
up in the house all day long.

139
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,795
I know you think you take care of
your brother.  Your a good boy Lennie.

140
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:41,923
I'm glad I have two wonderful boys.

141
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:47,095
Lennie!

142
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:48,472
Oh, Joey!

143
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:51,641
Oh gosh, what I put out and you
haven't touched a thing

144
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:53,393
I'm not hungry.

145
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:57,105
I don't know how you live.
Come on. Drink your milk.

146
00:07:57,397 --> 00:08:01,234
I'm  leaving money and the shopping list
right here under the telephone.

147
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:02,778
'bye, Lennie.

148
00:08:02,944 --> 00:08:04,029
Goodbye.

149
00:08:05,322 --> 00:08:06,615
Bye, Joey.

150
00:08:07,282 --> 00:08:08,617
Bye, mom.

151
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:11,453
Bye boys.

152
00:08:22,422 --> 00:08:23,965
Get out of here!

153
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:18,769
Happy birthday.

154
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:22,273
Drop dead!

155
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:36,036
Play with me Lennie.
No!

156
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:38,497
Mom says you should take care of me

157
00:09:38,664 --> 00:09:40,249
I want to play.

158
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:42,208
Stop pestering me.

159
00:09:44,252 --> 00:09:45,628
Do you want to play?

160
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,800
Okay.  Let's play hide and seek.

161
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:50,341
Alright.

162
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:52,469
Start counting.

163
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:53,969
10 ...

164
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:56,652
Hot!

165
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:01,366
I can't go tomorrow fellas.
What do you mean you can't go?

166
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,188
I just can't go, that's all.

167
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:05,607
I got stay home and mind Joey.
Aw Jeez.

168
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:08,067
My mother went away.

169
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:12,155
I got to mind Joey
Aw Jeez.

170
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:29,672
Hey Lennie,

171
00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:31,758
Look at this.

172
00:10:33,051 --> 00:10:37,097
I bet you if this here
was Joey this was you.

173
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:39,307
Joey ain't got that much blood.

174
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,930
I know how you can get rid of Joey.

175
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:44,145
How?

176
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:47,899
You bury him under the sidewalk
and cement it up again.

177
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,691
They'd  never find the body.

178
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,944
Ah, you'd have to kill him first.

179
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,530
Why?

180
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,907
It was only an idea.

181
00:10:58,117 --> 00:11:00,160
Wait a minute, I got it.

182
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,497
We stab him with an icicle.

183
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,081
So what?

184
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,709
They never find the
murder weapon.  It melts.

185
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:11,088
Where'd we get an icicle
in the summertime?

186
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,260
I read a good one.
The Indians used to do it.

187
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,429
We take Joey on a desert

188
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:22,015
Then we take a keg of ice with a rattle
snake in it and put it on his chest.

189
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:25,853
Then the sun melts the ice.
I'm worried.

190
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:30,691
Last night on the television they
blood come out of a guy's ear.

191
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,777
Blood, you dope. That's ketchup!

192
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:38,407
Ketchup?
So that's how they do it ...

193
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,684
You'd better change your shirt Lennie,
It's going to get full of ketchup.

194
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,028
Where was you?

195
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,173
Why didn't you find me?

196
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,176
I looked everywhere,
but you wasn't there.

197
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,052
I got tired tired of hiding.

198
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,138
Hey Joey, Harry has a real gun.

199
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,516
A real one?
Yeah, he's over on the big rock.  Come on.

200
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,194
Hi Lennie.

201
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,612
Watch this.

202
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,285
Boing! Bull's-eye

203
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,083
There comes a lion.

204
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,546
Bam! Right between the eyes.

205
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,423
Let me have it.

206
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,344
Ain't she a beauty?

207
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,183
She's a beauty alright Harry.
Where'd you get it?

208
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,977
What do you think?
Where my old man hides it.

209
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,145
Hey...

210
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,939
Don't let Joey touch it.

211
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,441
He's too young to handle Guns.
I am not.

212
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,984
Aw, Let him have a turn.

213
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:00,237
Well.. Okay.

214
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:02,823
But I'll have to keep my hands on it.

215
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,908
Let's see it.

216
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:08,703
Now here is how
you hold a real gun.

217
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,372
Where do you put the bullets?

218
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,915
Right here.

219
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,919
Say Joey, would you like
to shoot a real bullet?

220
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,338
But I don't got a real bullet.

221
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:20,339
Look.

222
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,009
First you put it in here.

223
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:25,929
Now you cock it.

224
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,305
There.

225
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:29,433
That's good, Joey.

226
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,476
Now remember Joey,

227
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:34,688
This is a real gun
with a real bullet.

228
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,733
You could hurt someone,
even kill someone!

229
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,402
Now take Aim.

230
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,655
Perfect, now you pull the trigger.

231
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,450
Go ahead, Softy, Squeeze it!

232
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:52,831
Lennie! Lennie!

233
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,835
Lennie's shot, Lennie's shot!

234
00:13:57,544 --> 00:14:00,944
Lennie?  Lennie?  Do you think
he's dead?  Do you think he's dead?

235
00:14:01,214 --> 00:14:02,424
Yeah, I think he's dead.

236
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,591
Dead, yeah.

237
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:07,052
You've shot him Joey
you shot your brother.

238
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:08,512
Yeah, you shot him Joey.

239
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:10,473
I didn't, I didn't!

240
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:12,833
Think we should we call the cops, Harry?

241
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,312
I guess so. They'll sure give Joey
the electric chair.

242
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:19,940
You'll fry Joey, you'll burn!
Won't he Charlie?

243
00:14:20,107 --> 00:14:23,736
Poor Joey, What do ya say Harry?
Let's give the kid a break.

244
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:24,987
Well I guess so.

245
00:14:25,154 --> 00:14:27,435
If you tell his mother
she has two kids dead.

246
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:29,812
Boy, what if she finds out
what happened to Lennie.

247
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:30,951
You got to beat it Joey!

248
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:33,120
We'll give you an hours
head start on the cops.

249
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:34,997
Better hide, Joey.

250
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,943
Take on the lam kid.

251
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:39,536
Yeah, hold up until this blows over.

252
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:48,343
Hey Joey.  Wait a minute.
Hey Joey.

253
00:14:48,478 --> 00:14:51,856
Something to remember Lennie by,
You don't need it no more.

254
00:14:58,521 --> 00:15:01,690
You had to see him run!
You had to see him run, Lennie!

255
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:03,734
Hey, Lennie!

256
00:15:06,612 --> 00:15:07,655
Lennie.

257
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,028
Keep ringing operator.

258
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:40,871
Boy, can't wait to see Joey's face
when he sees you Lennie.

259
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,332
Hey, I got an idea.

260
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:46,668
We get some flour, see, then you
you put it on your face ...

261
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:47,961
You mean like a ghost?

262
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:50,589
That's it.
Naw, we did enough.

263
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:53,759
I feel kind of sorry for Joey anyway.

264
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:55,886
Hey, my harmonica!

265
00:16:56,053 --> 00:16:57,762
I left it back in the lot.

266
00:16:58,013 --> 00:16:59,890
Oh no you didn't, I gave it to Joey.

267
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:01,100
You what?

268
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:03,936
That's right, I gave it to him.
Then he new you were dead.

269
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:06,980
If anything happens to that
harmonica, you'll pay.

270
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:08,732
Says who?
Says Me!

271
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:10,526
Aw fellas.

272
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,820
You stay out of this Charley.

273
00:17:12,986 --> 00:17:15,364
This is all Harry's idea,
and I think it stinks.

274
00:17:15,531 --> 00:17:16,657
Listen to him.

275
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:20,536
He's all the time picking on Joey instead
of picking on anybody that's his size.

276
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,121
Well your my size.

277
00:17:26,707 --> 00:17:31,376
Hey fellas, I got to go now fellas.
Hey fellas, I got to go.

278
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:51,065
Give up?

279
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:57,947
I never want to talk to you
again as long as I live.

280
00:17:58,114 --> 00:18:00,742
I'll get even with you yet.
Wait and see.

281
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:05,747
Joey?

282
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:08,458
Hey Joey!

283
00:18:10,469 --> 00:18:11,469
Joey!

284
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:16,269

Perfect.  Hold it, Hold it now.  Smile

288
00:23:49,252 --> 00:23:50,753
Joey!  You can smile.

289
00:23:51,462 --> 00:23:52,462
Please!

290
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:54,132
Smile Joey.

291
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:57,218
Please smile.

292
00:23:57,843 --> 00:23:58,927
Smile.

293
00:23:59,386 --> 00:24:00,386
Smile, Joey.

294
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:03,848
That's right, that's good.

295
00:24:12,774 --> 00:24:14,484
All right, same smile.

296
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,862
Come on now.. Good.

297

Good.  Hold it.

I got it!

299
00:24:20,824 --> 00:24:22,826
It won't take long.
No time at all.

300
00:24:23,034 --> 00:24:24,453

301
00:26:03,205 --> 00:26:04,205
Now Smile.

00:26:15,353 --> 00:26:16,730
Hold it.

303
00:26:21,443 --> 00:26:23,610
Look, my new assistant.

00:26:42,756 --> 00:26:45,091

You know he didn't
even yell for help.

Stan, there right next to him.

436
00:52:45,961 --> 00:52:48,172

Yep!

442
00:58:55,284 --> 00:58:57,934
You know, If you want to be a cowboy,

443
00:58:57,953 --> 00:58:59,205
Like roping.

444
00:58:59,372 --> 00:59:01,248
Cowboys got to learn
to handle a rope.

445
00:59:01,415 --> 00:59:02,415
Like this.

446
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:14,702

452
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:28,512
Another thing Joey.  Cowboys have to
be able to hold off a steer too.  Watch!

Where's my brother?

491
01:03:03,478 --> 01:03:04,478
Not here

492
01:03:04,738 --> 01:03:05,906
Not here?

493
01:03:06,323 --> 01:03:07,949
No, not anymore.

494
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:10,619
Better tell me what this is all about.

495
01:03:11,328 --> 01:03:13,038
It was.. It was only a joke.

496
01:03:14,664 --> 01:03:16,208
And then you called me on the phone.

497
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:19,169
Look Lennie, I think you
better go to the cops.

498
01:03:19,336 --> 01:03:21,480
 But my mother will find out and she ...
 And maybe she will..

499
01:03:21,546 --> 01:03:25,217
But you can't a little kid like Joey
wander around Coney Island alone.

500
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,177
After all he's only seven!

501
01:03:28,053 --> 01:03:30,555
Now I'm going tol tell you
how to find a police officer.

502
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,765
And tell the sergeant to check all the
merry-go-rounds and pony rides.

503
01:03:37,812 --> 01:03:39,663
'cause your kid brother is
 nuts about horses.

504
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:42,132
Yeah, I'll tell him.  Thanks.

505
01:04:00,376 --> 01:04:03,688
Hey mister, have you seen a red
headed kid with a cowboy gun?

506
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,551
Hmm.. Nope. Not today.

507
01:04:14,748 --> 01:04:15,748
No sonny.

508
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:17,143

509
01:04:17,394 --> 01:04:18,394
No.

510
01:04:18,562 --> 01:04:19,562
Not here.

511
01:04:20,176 --> 01:04:21,176
Sorry kid.

512
01:05:13,615 --> 01:05:14,315
That's Lennie?

513
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:18,553
Rolll them far and win a balloon.
Everybody wins a big balloon.

514
01:05:18,609 --> 01:05:20,542
Everybody wins a big balloon.

515
01:05:55,738 --> 01:05:58,917
This is looks like a good site.
Yeah, lots a room here.

516
01:06:03,163 --> 01:06:04,790
Come on take an end.

517
01:06:09,837 --> 01:06:10,838
Go away.

518
01:06:12,256 --> 01:06:13,632
Where's your mother?

519
01:06:45,122 --> 01:06:46,290
Hey mister.

520
01:06:56,507 --> 01:06:57,759
Hey mister.

521
01:07:06,225 --> 01:07:09,228
Hey mister you're laying on my pants.

522
01:07:12,761 --> 01:07:15,228
Hey mister you're laying on my pants.

523
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:34,087

Policeman? You want a cop?

Well, under the boardwalk
there is a lost childrens Pen

538
01:12:34,215 --> 01:12:36,676
About two blocks down, you'll
probably find a cop there.

01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:37,709
Thanks.

540
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:18,228

Hey Joey!

542
01:16:41,334 --> 01:16:44,337
What did you run away for?
It was only a joke.

543
01:16:45,129 --> 01:16:46,755
