2
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,969
Harlem life is... Harlem life...

3
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,575
Harlem life is hard body.

4
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,945
Uptown, baby. Holler.

5
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,517
Harlem life is hard.

6
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,988
Harlem life is hard body.

7
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,359
Less than 16 but eight.

8
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:38,028
But eight to sum it up,
and make this whole city late.

9
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,663
Less than 16 but eight.

10
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,464
To sum it up,
and make this whole city late.

11
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,196
Shit.

12
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,012
But eight...

13
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,222
All right. Freeze.

14
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,518
Do not move.

15
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,256
Sorry, Ma.
I just needed the money.

16
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,263
So is this how you got
your MP3?

17
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,631
Hello?

18
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,203
Money for what?

19
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,202
Cross the street.

20
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,366
For what?

21
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,171
- For a contest.
- What contest?

22
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,009
The winner gets a record deal.
It's tonight. Look, I had no choice.

23
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,277
Rob, you always have a choice.

24
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,250
Always.

25
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,191
It's not like you would have
given me cash.

26
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,758
Try me.

27
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,987
You ain't never wonder why
a car like that was just sitting there?

28
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,495
Parked like that?

29
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,696
Whose is it?

30
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,391
Electric.

31
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,060
- Who's that?
- He's syndicate.

32
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:55,332
- Syndicate?
- The Mafia, son.

33
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,171
- Are you serious, man?
- Yeah, I'm serious, son.

34
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,503
Damn.

35
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,967
What up, what up, what up, yo?
Let's hear it for Young Rome.

36
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,766
And now, my dog
from the pound, y'all.

37
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,274
DJ Trippe and Rob Royce.

38
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,446
Hey, yo, what's good, fam?
Coming straight out of Harlem.

39
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:39,949
We gonna have a good time tonight.
It's gonna be all good.

40
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,458
Put your hands up.

41
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,122
That's that punk
that ripped off my rims?

42
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,102
Let's shut this club down.

43
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,211
- This way.
- I gotta get my mom.

44
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,214
- I'll get your mother. Just go, man.
- Shit!

45
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,488
Okay. No.

46
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,957
I'll call you back. Bye.

47
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,030
Who was that?

48
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:08,900
Ma.

49
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,201
It was your father.

50
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,249
My father?

51
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,980
I thought you said
you didn't know where he was.

52
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,551
Well, I do.

53
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,926
He's in Puerto Rico, and he wants you
to come stay with him for a little while.

54
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,898
I don't even know that dude.
I don't know what he looks like.

55
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,761
- He's still your father.
- To me, he's not.

56
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,199
Someone shot at you last night
in front of my own eyes.

57
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,241
Ma, what you want me to do,
keep running?

58
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,569
You are going, and that is that.

59
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,214
I love you, son.

60
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,820
Robert?

61
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,989
Yeah.

62
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,725
- Let me take this for you.
- No, no, it's cool, I got it.

63
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,630
The car is over here.

64
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,877
You speak Spanish?

65
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,539
No.

66
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,680
It's okay.

67
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,252
Most people here speak English.

68
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,431
You're gonna meet Marivi,
my wife, and Javi.

69
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,005
This is Marivi.

70
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,082
It's very nice to meet you.

71
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,739
Hi.

72
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:37,789
We made a bed for you.
It's not much...

73
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,625
...but it's yours
as long as you need it.

74
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,362
It's much more comfortable
than it looks.

75
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,737
Well, then. I...

76
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,770
I guess I better be getting
back to work.

77
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,735
I'll see you in the morning.

78
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,417
Well, I'm sure you're tired, so...

79
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,653
The bathroom is down the hall.

80
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,494
Okay. Have a good night, okay?

81
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,894
Thanks.

82
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,417
Good morning.
How did you sleep?

83
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,686
Fine, thanks.

84
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,196
Now, I hope you're hungry.
Breakfast is almost ready.

85
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,643
Javi.

86
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,244
Javi, come on. I have to go.

87
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,950
- Robert, this is Javi.
- What's up?

88
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,859
This is Robert.
He was so excited to meet you.

89
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,433
But anyway, I have to go to work,
so you make yourself at home.

90
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,331
Show him around.

91
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,433
You know, show him the city.

92
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,734
And, okay, here is some money
your dad left...

93
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,343
...just in case
you need anything.

94
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,702
All right.

95
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,708
I'll see you later. Okay? Bye-bye.

96
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,392
- You smoke?
- Smoke what?

97
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,057
New York, really?

98
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,237
One day I would love
to live in New York.

99
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,839
My father told me a lot of stories
about New York.

100
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,942
Your father?

101
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,808
Where is he?

102
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,838
He died.

103
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,280
He died like a few years ago.

104
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,754
- I'm sorry, man.
- That's okay, man.

105
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,823
I hear you have some problems
back home.

106
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:34,824
You see that bald guy on the left?
Up there.

107
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:39,028
You ever need anything,
he's the guy to talk to.

108
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,332
He'll take care of you
as long as he likes you.

109
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:42,599
Oh, okay.

110
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,840
How you say?

111
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,744
It's the unofficial mayor
of the neighborhood.

112
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,451
Oh, you wanna go to Old San Juan,
get some piraguas?

113
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,713
- I got money, brother. I got money.
- Oh, so that's how you do it?

114
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,790
You ask for money,
you get money, right?

115
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,520
Muchacho, no, man. It's because
you here I got this, brother.

116
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,656
You wanna play a game?
You want this $20?

117
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,164
If you can catch it, the money's yours.
You ready?

118
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,597
- You ready?
- Right here.

119
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,101
- You ready?
- Yep.

120
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,698
Watch out.

121
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,435
Yeah!

122
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,576
So look, man.

123
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,416
Back home, I stole some rims
from this dude, man.

124
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,580
That's the reason why I'm here.

125
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,689
Have you ever really needed
to do something real bad, man?

126
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,324
And you just couldn't?

127
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,054
Yeah, pero not that bad.

128
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:13,388
I guess you had it
a little bit better than I did.

129
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,502
Shit happens, man.
Don't worry about it.

130
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,264
Please come and see us, okay?

131
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,174
- Check this out.
- I'll see you there.

132
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,747
Do you guys wanna come
to a show tonight?

133
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,784
Ten o'clock. My friend's performing.

134
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,094
- Bye.
- Bye.

135
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,128
Damn. That's how y'all
doing it in 'Rico?

136
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,890
That's how we do it.

137
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,297
Voltio. You ever heard of Voltio?

138
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,437
He's an amazing
reggaeton artist.

139
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:56,707
His music is like a mix of, like,
reggae, rap, parranda, merengue.

140
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,366
Oh, that's dope, man.

141
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,478
Seems like
a crazy combination, man.

142
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,375
It's like music from the ghetto.

143
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:06,416
You know, it's about our struggle,
our dreams. You ever had a dream?

144
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,448
Come on, tell me.

145
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,759
All right, well,
you know what I'm saying?

146
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,193
Maybe, you know, getting in front
of an audience, performing, you know.

147
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,957
Rapping, doing my thing,
you know.

148
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,892
Same here, brother.
It's the same, man.

149
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,197
Everybody has a dream, man.
And dreaming is free.

150
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,337
Okay, senora.

151
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,739
Gracias, Linda.

152
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,833
You like the food, Rob?
It's a typical Puerto Rican dish.

153
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,872
Ma. You think he's going to say
your food sucks?

154
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,240
There's a reggaeton show
tonight.

155
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:13,151
- Oh, really? Again?
- No, pero, Dad, it's Pedro's son.

156
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,719
Julio Voltio.

157
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,754
Oh, yeah, yeah, Julio.

158
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,323
You're gonna see tonight.
You're gonna see.

159
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,553
You know,
Roberto's a musician also.

160
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,290
- He played with some of the best...
- Oh, Marivi, please.

161
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,802
So you used to play music, huh?

162
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,264
I don't play anymore.

163
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,446
What's up, mama?

164
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,164
Hey, give me a Heineken.

165
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,072
Thanks.

166
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,971
Hey, what's up, bro?
What's going on?

167
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,448
- Chilling.
- Your music is hot!

168
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,588
You know it.
Reggaeton is where it's at!

169
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,451
Look, this is my stepbrother, Rob.

170
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,614
What's going on, bro?

171
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,954
- It's good.
- All right?

172
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,426
Man, are you still playing?

173
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:48,191
Always, brother, always.

174
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,925
That's it, brother.

175
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,229
Man, say hi
to your father, Roberto.

176
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,798
Sure, thank you.

177
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,440
- Yeah, you got it!
- Take care.

178
00:17:56,608 --> 00:18:00,738
Hey, what's up, girl?
Wanna dance the Perrero?

179
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,115
- It was so good.
- Thank you so much. You liked it?

180
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,754
- I did.
- It was good, right?

181
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,412
Thank you.

182
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,285
Hey, I saw you on the stage.

183
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,191
- It was hot.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

184
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,928
- How do you know Voltio?
- His father and my father...

185
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,863
...went to the same school.
- Oh, yeah?

186
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,798
They had a band
called The Artichokes.

187
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,200
So you guys are musicians too?

188
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,432
My brother is a rapper
from New York.

189
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,169
I'm trying to be,
you know what I'm saying? But l...

190
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,176
- Yo, C.C.
- Hey.

191
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,374
We gotta talk.

192
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,710
Leave me alone.

193
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,649
I'm not your girlfriend anymore.

194
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,718
- Would you just talk to me?
- I can't.

195
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,956
Do you wanna come smoke
with me?

196
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,597
- So you smoke now?
- Yes, I do.

197
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,304
Hey, my bad about inside,
you know what I'm saying?

198
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,173
It's okay.

199
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:12,912
- Look, I don't really smoke.
- I don't either.

200
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,150
- Rob, right?
- Yeah. C.C.?

201
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,724
- Yeah.
- All right.

202
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,990
C.C.

203
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,325
We are headed to San Juan.
Alexis and Fido are playing.

204
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,493
Do you guys wanna go?

205
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,971
- Let's go.
- All right.

206
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,554
Oh, yeah, C.C., nice boyfriend.

207
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,240
Okay.

208
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,241
The Vega brothers
are getting some tonight.

209
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,957
Come on, let's go dance.

210
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:31,922
Let's groove.

211
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,141
There you go, Mimi.

212
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,818
Come on, dance with me.

213
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,968
So can I see you again?

214
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,675
- Why?
- What do you mean why?

215
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:30,771
- Why do you wanna see me again?
- Because we have things in common.

216
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,843
No, but I think you're cool.

217
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,356
Okay. I'll give you a call.

218
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,820
Yo, Javi.

219
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,824
Yo, what's the number?

220
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,095
255-3489.

221
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,726
He's crazy.
All right, do you got it?

222
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,768
- Yes, I got it.
- Okay.

223
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,631
I need to go.

224
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:58,571
All right, peace.
That was funny.

225
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:01,906
Call me.

226
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,440
Bye.

227
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,645
Bye.

228
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,851
Do you have everything?

229
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,082
Yo. Yo.

230
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,286
Hurry.

231
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,255
Come on, right here.

232
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,847
- Hello.
- Hello, Rob.

233
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,886
Yeah, what's good?

234
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,622
- Am I calling you too early?
- No, just in time.

235
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,387
Can I come over?
I need some help with something.

236
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,588
Yeah, sure, no problem.

237
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,297
- Are you okay?
- I'll call you back. Bye.

238
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,699
Come on.

239
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,991
Yo.

240
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,994
What's good, man?
What you doing?

241
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:11,135
Making music. Come sit down,
I wanna show you something.

242
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,338
That's your basic
reggaeton beat.

243
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,876
Okay.

244
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,073
Yo, man,
how'd you get all this stuff?

245
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,650
I broadcast music online.

246
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,678
Oh, that's what's up.

247
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,382
This is something
I've been working on.

248
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:43,464
Okay. Okay.

249
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,975
- Slow it down a little bit. Slow it down.
- No, no, no.

250
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:55,442
The idea is to go the other way.
Otherwise you have hip-hop.

251
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,138
- Okay.
- Yeah.

252
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,976
- Okay. Okay.
- Keep going. Keep going.

253
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,742
Okay.

254
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,181
Okay.

255
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,513
- Sing. Come on.
- Okay. Okay.

256
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,191
Your boy Rob.

257
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,930
Coming straight out of Harlem.
Uptown, baby.

258
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,267
Uptown...

259
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,343
Okay. Check it out, check it out.

260
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,913
Yo, I'm trying to be
the Superman of the ghetto.

261
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,744
Get this paper, take this music
to a whole other level.

262
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:36,910
Trouble found me,
then I found myself in Puerto Rico.

263
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,749
That's why I got high,
I had to roll.

264
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,322
- Something like that?
- Yeah.

265
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,722
- Something like that?
- That's off the hook.

266
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,023
Oh, yeah.

267
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:48,860
We moved from New York
to Puerto Rico when I was 8.

268
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,434
Anyway, I came here
to talk about personal business.

269
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,934
- Oh, personal business?
- Yeah.

270
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,833
Well, what personal business
is that?

271
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,531
I actually plan on making it
to New York this summer...

272
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,074
...to study dance.

273
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:04,343
I have this application
that I need to correct.

274
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,347
Can you do it for me?

275
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,379
- It's in English.
- But your English is perfect.

276
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,317
Spoken, not written.

277
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:15,289
It's not a lot. It's just a couple of pages
and you can just correct it as you go.

278
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,620
Okay.

279
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:20,128
So, what do I get out of this?

280
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,266
Why do you have to get
something out of it?

281
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:25,528
Well, I mean, usually I charge a fee,
but, you know...

282
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,633
I can give you
my lucky-charm bracelet.

283
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,340
- Hey. What's up?
- Play this.

284
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,345
- Hey, what's up, man?
- What is it?

285
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:41,144
- I'm not gonna mess up your date.
- Okay.

286
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:50,756
Were you recording?

287
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,588
This is you?

288
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,603
This is crazy.

289
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,970
This is real hot.
You guys need to record this.

290
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:09,307
My neighbor has his own studio.
I can call him if you want.

291
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,715
- That would be dope.
- Okay.

292
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,547
- All right.
- Bye.

293
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,985
What have you been up to?

294
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,628
- I'm sorry, what did you say?
- What have you been up to?

295
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,892
Well, nothing.

296
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,304
Did you happen to see anyone
hanging around the house today?

297
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,030
No. Why?

298
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,233
Someone stole
Marivi's engagement ring.

299
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,803
No, I haven't seen anybody
around here today.

300
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,613
It meant a lot to her.

301
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,419
It meant a lot to me too.

302
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,932
- Hey, Rosie.
- Thank you, C.C.

303
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:12,726
Excuse me.
Can I ask you a question?

304
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:16,271
I was wondering... I saw you
at the club, and you dance great.

305
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:19,069
- Man, you've got some great moves.
- Thank you. Thank you.

306
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,404
- What's your name?
- C.C.

307
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,012
- I'm Jeffrey. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

308
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:26,582
I was wondering if you'd ever consider
taking on, like, private clients.

309
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,083
I would have to check.
I don't think they allow it.

310
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:32,382
I'd be willing to pay handsomely
and make it worth your while.

311
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,653
- I'll look into it.
- Okay. Will you take a card?

312
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,727
- Sure.
- Maybe call me?

313
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,391
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

314
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,090
Nice to meet you.

315
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,337
I'm not feeling it.
I don't like it.

316
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,674
No. Look, try it like this:

317
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,646
- Know what I'm saying?
- That's too much hip-hop.

318
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,414
What? That's how all the best
hip-hop records were made.

319
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,615
That's the point.
It's not supposed to sound like that.

320
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,760
Look, man, just try it.
Just check it out.

321
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,623
You check it out.

322
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,962
Yo, why you being
all stubborn for, man?

323
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,465
Just try it.

324
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,339
Yo, look, man,
I'm not trying to battle with you, okay?

325
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,177
But if we gonna make music,
we gotta make music as a team.

326
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:36,218
How we do music if you wanna do
one thing, I wanna do another?

327
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,287
- You tell me.
- What are you talking about?

328
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,016
- I'm doing hip-hop.
- We're in Puerto Rico, not New York.

329
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,659
We don't do hip-hop,
we do reggaeton.

330
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:45,455
I like 50 Cent
and Snoop Doggy Dogg.

331
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:50,023
Okay, yeah, and I like Daddy Yankee
and what is his name? Pitbull.

332
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,260
- That's not the point.
- That's not the point.

333
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,836
I swear...

334
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,971
Yo, you hear that?

335
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,911
Yo, you hear that?

336
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,183
What...? Yo, what's that?

337
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,589
A frog, the coqui.

338
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,522
I like that sound, man.

339
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,191
Might wanna use that,
you know what I'm saying?

340
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,662
Like in a song or something.

341
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,927
Yeah, yeah.

342
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,261
- No, no, no.
- What?

343
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,001
Okay, okay, okay.

344
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,011
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

345
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,656
- Hello. Yo.
- Are you there?

346
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,621
- Rob?
- Yeah.

347
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,261
- What's good?
- Nothing, I just wanted to call you...

348
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,489
...and say thank you for correcting
my paper. Thank you.

349
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,565
- It's no problem.
- I spoke to my friend...

350
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,065
...about using the studio.

351
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,966
- I think I can get that for you guys.
- Oh, thanks. Appreciate that.

352
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,869
I'll get in contact with him
and let you guys know, okay?

353
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,805
All right.

354
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,239
Peace.

355
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,577
Talking to her, right?

356
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,114
That's her? You talking to her?

357
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,844
I'm talking to none of your
damn business, that's who.

358
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,453
- Not my business?
- Yeah.

359
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,385
Everything around here
is my business, negro pendejo.

360
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,022
Say what? Say what?

361
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,026
I know where you live.

362
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:05,769
I know where you live. I know where
your parents work, you'll see.

363
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,167
You'll see,
I'm going to kill them all.

364
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,328
Whatever, man.

365
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,168
Stupid...

366
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,216
You understand
what they're saying?

367
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,045
No. Don't know.

368
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:26,250
It's that today is la conmemoracion
del Estado Libre Asociado.

369
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,659
It's Constitution Day.

370
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:32,125
Oh, okay.

371
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,129
But I thought Puerto Rico
was, like, a colonized country.

372
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,323
Something like that.

373
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,937
It is. We're the oldest colony
in the world.

374
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,298
Well, that's easy to say.

375
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,532
We have no natural resources.
Tourism is it.

376
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,677
What about reggaeton
and sugar?

377
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:50,075
The truth is, we know we can't be
a dependent country forever.

378
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:53,046
The economy is broke anyway,
so something has to happen.

379
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,651
To that day, salud.

380
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,954
- You hear anything about the ring?
- No. Not yet.

381
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,119
I'm sure it's somewhere.

382
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,733
Ma, you're always losing something
and then you find it.

383
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:13,865
He's speaking the truth.

384
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,300
I hear you're working on a song.

385
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:23,009
- We are.
- What is it?

386
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:27,851
Well, you know,
it's a little bit of everything.

387
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,144
You wanna hear it?

388
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,222
No, no.
Not while we're eating dinner.

389
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,218
Maybe later.

390
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,113
How you doing?

391
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,683
Just working on my music.

392
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,558
I know we haven't had a chance
to talk about things.

393
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,355
About us.

394
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,361
Well, you don't have to.

395
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,661
I just...

396
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,534
I just want you to know...

397
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,367
...that I always
thought about you.

398
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:30,579
I know it's not fair for me
to try to be a father...

399
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,511
...after all these years, but...

400
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,150
So don't.

401
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,984
It's not what you think.

402
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,082
Look, who cares now?

403
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,627
- You have to know, son.
- No, I don't.

404
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,126
L...

405
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,190
No, I don't.

406
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,361
I never thought I'd see the day
I'd be getting money.

407
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,794
Making music so haters
can't take nothing from me.

408
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,127
When chicks wouldn't holler
I'd just play back.

409
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:26,359
All I had was a flow and a ball cap.

410
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,038
Wall to wall, boom, boom
across the room.

411
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,174
Thinking they'd be
dancing to me soon.

412
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,469
I'm in the game but I'm still
in the streets.

413
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,737
Prepped for Harlem
and Puerto Rico.

414
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:40,407
Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico.
Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico.

415
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,484
Puerto Rico.

416
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:54,694
That was hot. You guys make
a crazy team together.

417
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:55,991
Oh, thanks.

418
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:00,297
We appreciate, you know what I'm
saying? The recording spot. Thanks.

419
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,530
You're welcome. Where's Javi?

420
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:06,302
Oh, he had to run some errands.
Yeah.

421
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,744
So...

422
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,141
...what you wanna do?

423
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,575
Do you know a place
where we can go get some drinks?

424
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,729
You know, there's a place like this
in New York.

425
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:30,423
Or New York
is just like this place.

426
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:34,833
Looks like in Puerto Rico,
you can go all day and all night.

427
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,767
Do you dance to this music?

428
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,173
No, not really.

429
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,713
- Why are you laughing?
- Why not?

430
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,080
- Because I don't dance, you know?
- I'll show you. Come on.

431
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:40,004
- Welcome back.
- Yeah, I'll be right back.

432
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,801
- Welcome back.
- Yeah, I'll be right back.

433
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,667
Don't go too far.

434
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,816
Hi. How are you?

435
00:40:56,987 --> 00:41:00,013
- Very good. How are you?
- I'm just waiting for my class to start.

436
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,715
This must be fate.

437
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,517
Yeah.

438
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,219
I'm waiting too, you know,
for that phone call. So?

439
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,991
I asked, and we're just...
We're not allowed to.

440
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,066
- Really?
- Yeah.

441
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,066
- Okay, well...
- What are you...?

442
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:16,104
Just down here scouting talent.

443
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:19,933
- You don't happen to sing, do you?
- No. I don't sing.

444
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,170
But I have some friends
that are really talented.

445
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,680
- Really? I'd love to hear them.
- I can get you their music if you want.

446
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,151
That'd be great.
That'd be excellent.

447
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,982
Okay. How long
are you in town for?

448
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,750
- Just a couple more days.
- Okay. We'll talk.

449
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:35,914
- Call me?
- Yeah.

450
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,721
I've heard that before.
If you don't call, I'll call you?

451
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,124
Bye.

452
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,068
So I heard
you had a date last night.

453
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:56,338
- How did it go?
- It was cool.

454
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,846
We went to the club, chilled...

455
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,041
...you know,
danced and stuff like that.

456
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,049
It was cool. I enjoyed myself.

457
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:06,181
So do you like
the music here, or...?

458
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,518
Oh, yeah, yeah,
the music is real different.

459
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,785
- I like it.
- Marivi.

460
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:15,529
Ready?

461
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,028
Okay, I'll see you at home.

462
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,736
See, yo, I don't know nothing
you just said, man.

463
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:28,401
Talking in Spanish.

464
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,963
Come home soon
because I'm going to cook.

465
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,794
- Really?
- Yes.

466
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,336
Well, then I'll run home.

467
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:11,578
Give me another beer.

468
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:23,731
The total is $ 15,
including this one.

469
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,703
Hey, I said it's $ 15!

470
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,974
I already heard you.

471
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:49,317
Can you settle up?
It's just that I'm about to close...

472
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:50,858
You will not close because...

473
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,586
I put money in the jukebox...

474
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,526
...I put money in the pool table.

475
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:57,189
I'm having a drink,
and you're going to throw me out?

476
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,328
- Can I get you something else?
- Margarita, please.

477
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,094
Right away.

478
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,702
This is really good.

479
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,307
I'll be right back.

480
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:35,127
You know, I never thought that
he would go after your family, Rob.

481
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,834
I'm so sorry.

482
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,464
Look, don't worry about it.

483
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:49,436
Marivi, she's gonna be okay.

484
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:53,109
Plus, I know it wasn't your fault.

485
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,717
You know what I'm saying?

486
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,618
I had some good news for you.

487
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:06,322
The record producer that I met?

488
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:07,930
He really liked your demo.

489
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:10,690
Oh, yeah?

490
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,899
Yeah.

491
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:23,211
Look, I'm gonna get back inside
and see how she is.

492
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,611
- See you later, all right?
- Okay. See you.

493
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,236
Hey.

494
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:54,036
I'm sorry, I didn't...

495
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,144
Let's go outside.

496
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,222
How is she?

497
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,359
Yeah, she'll be okay.

498
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,326
They're gonna
let her out tomorrow.

499
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,494
So, what's gonna happen
to the dude who did it?

500
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,794
He'll be dealt with.

501
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:23,238
Who? You or the man?

502
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:28,036
There's a way of doing things
in our neighborhood.

503
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:31,347
She was asking about you.

504
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,780
I didn't know if I should
come in there or not.

505
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,251
I'm happy you did.

506
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,751
- Hey, Vico.
- Vico.

507
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,446
Hey, Vico.

508
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:27,069
- Yo, Vico, where you going?
- The mayor has a message for you.

509
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,205
- Vico.
- Around here, we don't hit no woman.

510
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,568
- Vico.
- Yo, the mayor doesn't like that, man.

511
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,472
- Beating up on women?
- What were you thinking, huh?

512
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,308
You're not bigger.
The rules are the rules.

513
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,331
So anyway,
as I was saying to C. C...

514
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,235
...you put together
a kick-ass demo...

515
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:07,844
...but I got a producer who's gonna
take you to the next level. All right?

516
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:11,208
Okay. But we want to be able to do
our music the way we want to.

517
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,576
Right. And the guy I got in mind,
he's the best.

518
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,082
Best producer in New York.
Peter Black is his name.

519
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,687
Produced Usher, everybody.
And you're gonna love him.

520
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:20,649
Gonna love him.

521
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:23,156
Well, let me talk it over
with my business partner.

522
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:26,785
You should. But you gotta do it quickly
because I gotta get out of town.

523
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:29,931
- All right, cool.
- All right.

524
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,829
- So you'll let me know?
- I will.

525
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,803
Thank you for seeing us.
Take care.

526
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:39,841
My pleasure. Thanks, C.C.
All right. I expect a call.

527
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,711
So?

528
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:54,986
I don't know.

529
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,921
What do you mean
you don't know?

530
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,221
Do you understand
what just happened here, Rob?

531
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:02,593
I mean, I understand.
But I don't know if you do.

532
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,963
A record executive
just left here.

533
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,660
Wants to cut your record,
you're talking about something else.

534
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,271
Calm down, mama.
Calm down.

535
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:14,575
Look, Robert,
I think she's right.

536
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:16,178
What we have to lose?

537
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,553
Yeah!

538
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,865
So it's off to New York.

539
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,558
Yeah, exactly what you wanted.

540
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:41,761
Actually, it's even better.

541
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:44,566
- Yeah, why?
- Because you're coming.

542
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,143
Oh, and also because Jeffrey
wants to introduce me...

543
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:51,576
...to some artist managers
that need dancers for music videos.

544
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:52,772
Yeah, that's cool.

545
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:54,974
- That's good, right?
- Yeah.

546
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,354
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

547
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,187
You sure?

548
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,500
Okay, well...

549
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,571
...guess I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

550
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,565
- Phone.
- Bye.

551
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:24,303
Call you.

552
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:31,743
Hi, Ma. So we got a producer
who wants to record us in New York.

553
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,618
That's great. What about the guys
that are looking for you?

554
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:38,318
The producer got us a place to stay
in Brooklyn, so he won't find me there.

555
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,430
- I'll text you the address, all right?
- Okay.

556
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,088
Meet me there. I love you.

557
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,961
Love you too, babe.

558
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:58,847
Hey, Robert.
What are you doing here?

559
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:01,041
Well...

560
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:06,155
I came to tell you
that I'm leaving.

561
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:09,622
What? You're leaving? Why?

562
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,261
We got a gig back in New York.

563
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:15,091
- You serious?
- Yeah.

564
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:17,324
Congratulations.

565
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:25,731
You know, I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time.

566
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,571
Something I really need
to tell you.

567
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:33,682
Have a drink with me.

568
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,958
You know,
when I met your mother...

569
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:52,099
...I was playing with a band
in New York.

570
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:55,900
And I...

571
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:01,108
I was a mess at that time.

572
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:03,136
Booze...

573
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,478
...drugs.

574
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,016
We had our whole life
in front of us.

575
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,120
One night, after the show...

576
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,848
...Tanya was waiting for me
in the car with you.

577
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,258
You were...

578
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:18,690
You were just a baby then.

579
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:25,633
And I got behind the wheel
and I was drunk.

580
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:28,100
And we had a horrible accident.

581
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,006
Now, thank God we survived.

582
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,835
Tanya didn't wanna speak to me
after that.

583
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:38,105
She asked me to leave.

584
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:41,546
So I came down here
to start over.

585
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:45,749
And I was calling her
and calling her...

586
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:48,220
...but she had disappeared
with you.

587
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,888
I couldn't play music after that.

588
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,325
And I never again
returned to New York.

589
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,509
It's still all about you.

590
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:18,153
You know,
it's always been about you.

591
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:23,517
Look, as far as I'm concerned,
I didn't have a father.

592
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:28,561
And now all of a sudden
you and my mom decide that I do?

593
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:37,662
You know, man, maybe if you hadn't
abandoned us in the first place...

594
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:41,607
...I wouldn't have ended up like this.
Hiding, running.

595
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:45,607
I'm supposed to be dead.

596
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:50,277
Robert, I am so sorry.

597
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,250
Just forget it, man.

598
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:16,641
So I guess
you'll be leaving us soon.

599
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,474
Yeah.

600
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:21,479
That's too bad.

601
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:25,620
Well, I just wanted to tell you
that I really appreciate you...

602
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:28,815
...you know, allowing me
to stay here and all.

603
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:32,120
And I'm really sorry
about the trouble and stuff.

604
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,357
It's okay.

605
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:40,696
Look, before you go,
something I wanna show you.

606
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,304
Go in that box, in the corner.

607
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:45,932
This one?

608
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:49,772
Sit down.

609
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:59,188
These are yours.

610
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,962
Your father
always looks at those...

611
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,758
...every time your birthday
comes around.

612
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,197
September 28th, right?

613
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,597
What's wrong?

614
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:39,819
I mean, I wasn't gonna
sell it or anything.

615
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:42,863
I don't know
why I took it. I just...

616
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,062
I'm sorry.

617
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:52,302
Don't worry.

618
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:55,340
I'll just tell him
I found it somewhere.

619
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,776
You have every right
to feel the way you do...

620
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,815
...but just so you know...

621
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:05,750
...he was so happy to see you.

622
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:28,602
Take care of yourself, okay?

623
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,707
- Do you have your tickets?
- Yeah, I think so.

624
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:33,849
Do you have
everything you need?

625
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,646
Take it easy.

626
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:39,915
All right.

627
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:45,358
Let's go to New York.

628
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:48,323
- Take care of them.
- Okay.

629
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,464
Listen to it, okay?

630
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,830
Okay.

631
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:01,738
And make sure you clap
when the plane lands. It's tradition.

632
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,454
Man, it feels good to be home.

633
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,224
What up, New York?

634
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:26,095
Yo, man, look at this.
This is dope.

635
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:28,499
Man, this is crazy.

636
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:31,703
I told you guys
Jeffrey was gonna hook us up.

637
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:35,538
Well, I hope this place
comes with a cleaning lady.

638
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:49,749
- What's good?
- Hey.

639
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:52,451
I'm saying let's go out.
Let's go out and celebrate.

640
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:54,893
Hey, man, why don't you come
soup your boy up?

641
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:07,266
Yo, have you spoken to your ex
since you got back?

642
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,538
No.

643
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,180
You still think about her?

644
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:16,751
I mean, from time to time,
but, I mean, you see what I got.

645
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,722
Hey, she got that spice, son.
For real.

646
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,689
Don't let it happen again,
my nigga.

647
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:27,022
You talking about
the falling-in-love thing?

648
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:30,632
Never. Never.

649
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:34,603
You wanna dance?

650
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:39,038
Never. Never.

651
01:00:56,619 --> 01:01:00,180
So, what do you think?
It's got a layer of African fusion.

652
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:03,018
I mean, I don't mind
combining it with something else...

653
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:05,524
...I just wasn't too crazy about that,
you know?

654
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:08,858
Yeah, I think the boys were hoping
to stick to the original beat.

655
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:10,056
Is that right, guys?

656
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:13,361
- Did you at least listen to our demo?
- What demo?

657
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:16,061
The one sent from the office.
They didn't send that?

658
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:17,866
- No.
- You gotta be kidding me.

659
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,134
Javi, do you got
some music on you?

660
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:21,799
Yeah.

661
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:23,902
All right.

662
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,259
All right, all right.
I can work with this.

663
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:48,927
Well, all right, then.
You kids can take it from here.

664
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:52,871
- Absolutely.
- C.C., let's jet.

665
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,401
Where you going?

666
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:58,411
He's gonna introduce me
to some artists for a music video.

667
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:01,049
- We'll do something tonight, all right?
- All right.

668
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,946
- See what you can do.
- No, I got it.

669
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,143
It's gonna be great.

670
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,686
- Be back later, all right?
- Yeah.

671
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:08,346
Bye.

672
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:29,368
Bye.

673
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:41,249
- Hey, baby.
- There she is.

674
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:48,621
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

675
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:51,096
You know exactly what I mean.
You're acting weird.

676
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:54,767
Did I do something?

677
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:58,266
I don't know, you tell me.

678
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:03,467
Look, I thought we had plans tonight.
Like, tonight.

679
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:05,045
Rob, look, I'm sorry.

680
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:08,115
Jeffrey took me around everywhere,
and my battery died today...

681
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:11,617
Oh, come on, man. Look, I understand
you gotta go out, do your thing...

682
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,779
...but it's the way
you doing your thing.

683
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,948
Using what you got
to get to the next level.

684
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,821
- So you have a good time?
- What?

685
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:24,364
- You and Jeffrey.
- You don't know a thing about me.

686
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:26,468
All I know
is what you told me, okay?

687
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,968
How you always
wanna get what you want.

688
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:32,574
Fuck you. I don't need this.

689
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:38,707
Damn it.

690
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:43,986
Where to, miss?

691
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,050
I'm going to Manhattan,
240 Central Park West.

692
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:48,884
Okay.

693
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:08,008
I'm glad you called.

694
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:12,111
So this is my apartment.

695
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:15,043
- It's nice.
- Thank you.

696
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:18,051
Can I get you a drink,
or do you wanna talk about anything?

697
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:20,985
No, thank you. I just...

698
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,517
- I'd rather just go to sleep.
- You sure?

699
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,354
- Yeah.
- Okay.

700
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:27,922
Well, let me show you
where you're going.

701
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:29,428
You can stay down here.

702
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,693
You got fresh sheets and towels
and a bathroom back here.

703
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,302
You can make yourself at home.

704
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:38,137
Let me try this.

705
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:42,407
Now it's better. Yeah.

706
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:57,255
- Hi, boys.
- You guys know Noelia, right?

707
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,758
She's got an amazing voice.

708
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:02,557
Jeffrey asked me to have her
sing the hook on your song.

709
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:04,663
- What?
- No, no, no. No way.

710
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:07,632
Yo, look, my man,
we've been talking to you all day.

711
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:10,067
Those are not even the tracks
that we gave you.

712
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,969
Now you asking us to incorporate
somebody on our hook?

713
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:16,111
We need something commercial,
something people already know.

714
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:18,247
- People are tired of the same old.
- Yeah.

715
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,644
We were brought here
to make our music.

716
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:24,115
- We are making your music.
- No, we're making your music.

717
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:27,415
You know what? If you don't like it,
you know where the door is.

718
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:30,448
- Come on, come on.
- Okay, okay, stop. Take it easy.

719
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:32,116
Come on.

720
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:34,892
We are going
to lose the deal, man.

721
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:37,931
Look, man, I understand
that this is a great opportunity...

722
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,897
...but I'm not feeling this, man.

723
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:41,434
Damn, we're so close.

724
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,128
Close to what, Javi?

725
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,103
That music in there was wack.

726
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:49,574
And we can't do it like this.
This is not how dreams come true.

727
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,942
If we gonna do it,
we gotta do it our way.

728
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:57,109
Let me deal with it.
All right, whatever.

729
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,810
Yeah, bye.

730
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:00,888
What happened?

731
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:04,459
Your friends just quit.

732
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:10,260
Don't worry about it.

733
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:15,566
Anyway, I invited some artists
over for cocktails.

734
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:20,032
But why? That's all I'm asking.
Why would you quit?

735
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:21,972
Ma, they was messing up
the music.

736
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:25,978
But these people are professionals.
Maybe they were trying to help you.

737
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:28,445
Look, don't worry.

738
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,551
I'm not gonna be like dad.

739
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:34,550
What do you mean?

740
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:36,214
He told me what happened.

741
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,660
Don't worry, Ma.

742
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:42,359
I understand.

743
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:44,761
You do?

744
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:55,004
- I love you, Ma.
- I love you too, son.

745
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,145
New Yorkers are preparing
for the annual...

746
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:59,076
...Puerto Rican Day parade
this Sunday.

747
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,716
Many of our local celebrities
will be attending.

748
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:05,217
Some of Puerto Rico's greatest
reggaeton artists will be performing...

749
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:10,121
...such as Voltio, Alexis y Fido,
Calle 13 and others.

750
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:13,352
In other news, the weather
in New York has been hitting highs...

751
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,520
...and the beaches
have been very crowded.

752
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,394
Please stay tuned for...

753
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:31,734
Pay attention to what these guys
are doing, what she's doing.

754
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:33,499
So when you make
your own record...

755
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:36,645
...you'll be more familiar
with the process, okay?

756
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,314
But I don't wanna be a singer.

757
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:42,542
What do you mean
you don't wanna be a singer?

758
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:45,346
Come on. That's what they all say
in the beginning.

759
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:47,489
You'll be a great singer.

760
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:52,551
- What?
- Nothing.

761
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,322
I'll be right back.

762
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,663
- Where you going?
- Just to the ladies' room. I'll be back.

763
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,510
Oh, what am I doing?

764
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:27,061
Yo, man,
I wanna know where she at.

765
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:30,090
Does she know anyone here?

766
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:33,927
No, I don't think so,
I mean, Jeffrey.

767
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:37,069
What a prick, man.

768
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:39,833
I'm so glad we didn't sign anything
before coming here.

769
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,068
- It was a good move.
- Word.

770
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:50,285
What's up, beautiful?

771
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:52,545
Do you need a ride, mommy?

772
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,948
Tell that kid of yours
we wanna talk to him.

773
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:57,592
Tell him Electric
wants to talk to him.

774
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,456
Tonight, 9:00.

775
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:01,991
Remember...

776
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:05,065
...we know where to find you
in case he forgets to show up.

777
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:07,399
You got that?

778
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:14,973
Let the cops deal with it.

779
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:17,635
Ma, the cops don't care
nothing about this.

780
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:21,112
- To them, I'm one less nigger.
- Watch your mouth.

781
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:22,841
I know these dudes.

782
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:25,543
They gonna keep messing with me,
keep looking for me.

783
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:28,918
You are on probation.
I won't be able to get you out of jail.

784
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:31,818
Look, I'm not running no more.

785
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,828
I ain't running no more.

786
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:03,487
Dear C. C., I just wanted
to apologize for what I said to you.

787
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:13,830
I just... I think I'm drunk.

788
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:17,132
- You think?
- I think.

789
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:18,629
- Really?
- Yeah.

790
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:20,968
Yeah.

791
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:24,010
- Can I tell you a secret?
- What?

792
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:26,545
You're so beautiful.

793
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:30,575
You're... God, you're...

794
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:34,154
You're handsome too, and...

795
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:39,860
And what? What?

796
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,327
- I don't know.
- Old?

797
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:46,059
No. I wasn't gonna say that.

798
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:48,066
What were you gonna say?

799
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:52,838
I don't know.

800
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:57,637
I don't know, I...

801
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:03,383
Well, I'm just trying to tell you
how special you are.

802
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:06,953
I want you to know that, okay?
And talented.

803
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:09,386
I mean, you...
You have a bright future...

804
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:11,423
...and you can do
anything you want.

805
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:14,357
Dancing, sing if you want.

806
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:17,328
You can have anything you want.

807
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:23,833
You got something... Pardon me.

808
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:33,009
I don't feel well.

809
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:51,123
The producers, they screwed us.
They're messing up the music.

810
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:54,061
L... We have no money...

811
01:12:54,236 --> 01:12:56,295
...and I can't stay with Tanya
for too long.

812
01:12:57,673 --> 01:12:58,697
I'll take care of it.

813
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:01,738
Hello?

814
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:03,444
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello?

815
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:04,872
Hello?

816
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:06,505
Hello?

817
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:12,243
Right then,
you know what I'm saying...?

818
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:24,498
- Yo, yo, yo.
- Oh, he there?

819
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:26,531
- That's him, right?
- That's the kid, son.

820
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:28,431
That's it?

821
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:31,573
Yo, yo, yo, keep it low,
keep it low, keep it low.

822
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:34,272
What I gotta do
to make this right, man?

823
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:38,607
- All right. You pick one of my boys...
- This clown right here.

824
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:41,944
...fight them, shoot a fair one,
then we done.

825
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:48,484
Hey.

826
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:53,154
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to make sure you feel okay.

827
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:57,526
- Punk.
- Yo, pick me. Come on.

828
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:04,536
Get him, get him. Get him. Yeah.

829
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:09,035
- I just want to kiss your lips.
- No, I can't.

830
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:10,473
Come here for one second.

831
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:12,944
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right, all right, all right.

832
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,483
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

833
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:19,646
Yeah, get him,
get him, get him.

834
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:21,813
- Please, C.C., don't...
- No.

835
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,159
That's for my 'Vette.

836
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:29,530
That's for being a punk.

837
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,491
- Stop it.
- That's for wasting my time.

838
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,403
Stop!

839
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,299
Cops. Break up, break up.

840
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:49,981
Yeah!

841
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:33,454
Javi, it's for you.

842
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:36,386
Hello.

843
01:15:36,565 --> 01:15:38,430
Yo, this is Voltio, what's up?

844
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,261
Hey, what's up?

845
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:43,199
You know, your father
gave me your demo.

846
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,964
It's amazing, we all love it!

847
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:46,971
Our producer
wants to work with that.

848
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:49,906
It's hot. Listen.

849
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:52,342
I'm about to board a plane
to come to New York...

850
01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:54,175
...for the Puerto Rican Day Parade.

851
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:55,873
I wanna see you and your crew
on stage. Meet me there. Bye.

852
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:57,416
That's great, thanks.

853
01:15:57,586 --> 01:15:59,315
Okay.

854
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:04,055
- Yo. Yo, what you doing?
- Wake up.

855
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,490
You're not gonna believe
what just happened.

856
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:09,222
Voltio wants us to join him
at the parade.

857
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:12,595
- He just called me right now.
- What parade?

858
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:15,737
We're here at the 49th annual
Puerto Rican Day Parade...

859
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:18,566
...being led by Grand Marshal
Marc Anthony and his wife...

860
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,072
...movie star and recording artist,
Jennifer Lopez.

861
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,108
We're having great weather
in New York...

862
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:25,303
...and the spirits are running high.

863
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,347
Puerto Rico's greatest musicians
have joined the parade...

864
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:30,280
...including artists such as Voltio.

865
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:33,250
According to police estimates,
the crowds are now building...

866
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:35,913
...to over three million people.

867
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:59,537
Dear C. C...

868
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:02,980
...I wanted to apologize
for what I said to you.

869
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:05,984
I wish I understood myself
a little better.

870
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:09,621
And in case I don't see you
or go back...

871
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:12,919
...I wish that you become
an amazing dancer.

872
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,892
You deserve it.

873
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:16,291
Peace, Rob.

874
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:32,771
Where are you?

875
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,130
Puerto Rico!

876
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:24,913
What's up, everybody?

877
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:30,284
Yeah, you know what's up!

878
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:33,825
Hey, everybody, we're here
at the Puerto Rican Day Parade.

879
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:36,791
And we're here chilling hard.

880
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:39,832
And today,
I have some special guests...

881
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:42,935
...that came all the way
from San Juan, Puerto Rico...

882
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:46,399
...the Vega Brothers!

883
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:49,340
All right, let's go, baby.

884
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:55,643
What's up?

885
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:57,609
Javi, what's up, papi?

886
01:20:57,786 --> 01:21:00,482
Hey, yo, what's good,
what's good?

887
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:03,350
All right, all right, all right.
So check it out.

888
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:06,585
My name is Rob,
coming straight out of Harlem.

889
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:09,559
You know, we came to do
a little something for y'all today.

890
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:12,199
That's my boy Javi
coming straight out of Puerto Rico.

891
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,267
Matter of fact,
I love Puerto Rico.

892
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:16,870
Yo, yo, do a little something
for them, Javi.

893
01:21:18,006 --> 01:21:19,598
Okay.

894
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:25,603
Yes, sir. So check it out.

895
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:28,146
Y'all can put your hands up
just like this.

896
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:31,911
Put your hands up. Yeah, yeah.
Don't be afraid. It's all good.

897
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:37,850
I have a surprise
for this man right here.

898
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:40,927
Joining us
is one of the best musicians.

899
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:43,530
One of the best musicians
from Puerto Rico.

900
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:47,600
An amazing percussionist.

901
01:21:47,769 --> 01:21:51,398
Here he is, Roberto Vega.

902
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:56,906
Julio Voltio.

903
01:21:58,413 --> 01:21:59,744
It's good to see you.

904
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:03,011
How are you?

905
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:06,176
It's great to be here in New York City.
It's good to see you.

906
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:09,687
- Man, this is crazy.
- Yeah, I can't believe he came.

907
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:15,153
Yeah, yeah, put your hands up,
Puerto Rico.

908
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,159
I'm so glad you're here.

909
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,637
I am so proud of you, son.

910
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:26,664
Thanks.

911
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:28,674
Man...

912
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:43,257
Did you get my message?

913
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:47,290
Yeah, I got it.
So I'll see you after?

914
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,791
All right.
All right, let's do this.

915
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:58,468
Here we go.

916
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:02,939
Yeah. Put your hands up.

917
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,889
Put your hands up.
