1
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,158
Dad, your phone call.

2
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,595
Just wait a moment, who's calling?

3
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,638
The court.
Forgotten.

4
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,109
Calling from the court?

5
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,577
The Medical Association promotes
dad to be the committee member.

6
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,943
To solve the family problems.

7
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:09,086
Such as divorces, heritages,
arguments, etc.

8
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:11,714
This is not a easy job.

9
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,958
Dad loves to be a negotiator.

10
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,690
l'm forced to listen to him.

11
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,735
The court starts at 1 :00 today.

12
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,130
To spend the whole afternoon.

13
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,709
l get troubles for myself.

14
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,376
Tokyo Family Court.

15
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,308
Family Problems Migistrates.

16
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:52,992
You come out here.

17
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:57,201
You'd know that father-in-law has
been looking after my daughter.

18
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:01,001
We never have any
unacceptable requests.

19
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:03,674
My daughter was just born.

20
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,744
You just wait here.
l remind you.

21
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,976
We are from the same hole.

22
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:15,319
Why do you disturb us?

23
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,121
You are only the son-in-law.

24
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,723
lndifferent from the others.

25
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,785
Although you are not registered.

26
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:24,988
lt is his blood.

27
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,388
Listen to me.

28
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:30,397
What is this case relevant to you?

29
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:35,103
Shut up, listen to me.

30
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,437
l think you need to discuss.

31
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:40,405
But please listen to me today.

32
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,271
We have to convince dad first.

33
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:47,786
Otherwise the lawsuit finishes today.

34
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:51,114
Please stay here for a while.

35
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:02,959
Wait.
l said it so clearly.

36
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,429
l don't know your relationship
with dad.

37
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,298
We don't mean to ignore you.

38
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:12,343
Convince dad first.
However.

39
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:16,948
l am the magistrate here.

40
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:23,254
l am sorry, excuse me.

41
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,258
Shit.

42
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:31,754
Dad, don't be angry.
Anyway l must keep it.

43
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:32,729
l am sorry.

44
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,898
Anyway l don't care.

45
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:43,307
Can outsiders bother the business?

46
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:47,780
Sorry, dad is always impulsive.

47
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,984
Yat says something to convince dad.

48
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,322
Dad, in fact.
Bastard.

49
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,320
We have discussed.

50
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:04,963
We hope dad can accept our requests.

51
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:08,432
To formally submit the declaration.

52
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,927
Anyway l don't care about your ideas.

53
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:14,335
This declaration is enforced by law.

54
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:17,938
Dad you say that.

55
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,842
Means you don't admit that
we are individuals.

56
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:27,181
Why can you say
some mature words?

57
00:06:27,422 --> 00:06:29,913
You only peep on my assets.

58
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,452
All are not loyal.

59
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:34,485
How come?
Dad.

60
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:38,092
We also understand dad.

61
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:42,227
The whole Japan is also feeling
worried as you are.

62
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:45,836
Right, but you are too rude dad.

63
00:06:46,441 --> 00:06:48,170
Brother, do you agree?

64
00:06:48,243 --> 00:06:50,404
Does it mean l am mad?

65
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:51,909
Not that.

66
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:54,178
So why don't you listen to me?

67
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:03,515
You have to care of mum.

68
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:06,583
Go back, we go home.

69
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:08,121
Mum, please don't cry.

70
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:09,992
No one want to see this.

71
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:11,429
We don't want to quarrel.

72
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,860
Do we come to lose face?

73
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:18,862
Yat, say something.

74
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:22,540
Don't look like a man.

75
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,101
Too bad.

76
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,544
l am really sorry.

77
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:33,013
Bothering you.

78
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:35,954
lt's OK, this is my job.

79
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,957
Here is for solving family problems.

80
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:52,367
Even the quarrels between couples.

81
00:07:58,747 --> 00:08:03,241
And quarrels between
fathers and sons.

82
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:07,047
Can see anything.

83
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:10,748
This is so-called everyone.

84
00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:16,958
Sometimes it needs a third party
to solve the problems.

85
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,824
lf everyone is honest.

86
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:24,803
There'll be no mistakes.

87
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:29,633
Our job is to listen.

88
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,113
And try to give advise.

89
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:40,344
l have a suggestion.

90
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:49,027
You continue to discuss,
we try to judge.

91
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:58,028
Tin, get ready.

92
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,202
Please wait at the corridor.

93
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:12,009
Dad...

94
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:21,726
Ridiculous, without
my permission to do it.

95
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:34,398
This quarrel is complicated,
hard for you.

96
00:09:35,277 --> 00:09:36,266
lntroduce first.

97
00:09:36,478 --> 00:09:39,470
The Law Society and the
Medical Association Yuen.

98
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:42,241
How are you?
How do you do?

99
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:45,876
Talk about the details of
declaration first.

100
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:48,912
Time is running late,
let me say it.

101
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:58,163
lgnore the name and address
of the client.

102
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,231
Say the aim of the declaration first.

103
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,801
The aim of the declaration.

104
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:06,330
Chung.

105
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:11,439
ls requested not to use the assets.

106
00:10:13,048 --> 00:10:14,709
The case is.

107
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:20,478
The victim is Chung's wife.

108
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:25,917
Chung in June last year.

109
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:31,755
To the radiation format the bomb.

110
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:35,334
Feels so frightened.

111
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:44,435
ls sick of worries.

112
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,345
September in the same year
he needed to leave home.

113
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:54,219
lgnored the objection of the family.

114
00:10:55,357 --> 00:11:01,853
Bought 480 miles land in Chow.

115
00:11:02,564 --> 00:11:06,056
To build some strange houses.

116
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:08,526
November the same year.

117
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:16,811
Knew that the place might be radiated.

118
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:19,469
To stop the progress.

119
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:22,147
As a result.

120
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:29,848
Make the Chung's family
to suffer a loss of 7.4 million.

121
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:35,486
But to his strange behaviour.

122
00:11:36,198 --> 00:11:40,532
He didn't feel sorry and became mad.

123
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:44,328
Chung wanted to find a piece
of peace land on earth.

124
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:46,997
ln South America.

125
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:53,839
Planned to migrate to Basil.

126
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,248
ln order to implement.

127
00:11:56,985 --> 00:12:02,480
He declared to use all the wealth.

128
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:09,925
The family therefore applied for
an injunction from the court.

129
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:12,895
lf it lasts.

130
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:19,835
Chung's behaviour will destroy
the family life.

131
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:26,646
So we have this declaration.

132
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:45,990
This declaration affects us a lot.

133
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:49,364
This is not kidding.

134
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:54,675
Dad can't use the assets.

135
00:12:54,943 --> 00:12:58,106
By law the wife is the guardian.

136
00:12:59,982 --> 00:13:01,973
How about our daughters?

137
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:05,676
Don't worry, Chiu.

138
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:07,812
Nowadays the young can do.

139
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:11,089
Please call the victim to come.

140
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,325
Mum...

141
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:24,729
l don't go in, you make the decision.

142
00:13:24,974 --> 00:13:28,808
No way, mum is the victim.

143
00:13:29,245 --> 00:13:32,237
Must turn up the meeting.
l don't want to quarrel.

144
00:13:32,348 --> 00:13:35,010
Be good, don't waste time.

145
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:41,153
Are you Ms Chung?

146
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:42,212
This way please.

147
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:44,215
The elder son Yat.
Please.

148
00:13:45,695 --> 00:13:47,686
The second son Yeen.
Please.

149
00:13:48,264 --> 00:13:49,424
The elder daughter Haa.

150
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:51,697
l am Haa's husband.

151
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:55,230
Outsiders can go in.

152
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:57,833
l don't plan to listen.

153
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,289
Chun.
What?

154
00:15:01,737 --> 00:15:05,730
What do you see the bombs of
radiation and hydrogen?

155
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:09,771
Why do you ask that?
Answer me first.

156
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:15,081
Afraid?
So frightened.

157
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:18,743
Really?

158
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:22,622
Everyone is frightened.

159
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:27,126
So why do you look ''don't care''?

160
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:30,989
Needless to say?

161
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:34,226
This is not under control.

162
00:15:35,705 --> 00:15:37,195
Ching, give me some rice.

163
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,529
Coming.

164
00:15:43,046 --> 00:15:44,536
Sorry to keep you waiting.

165
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:03,655
However.

166
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:08,530
Someone is planning to escape.

167
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:10,336
Don't joke.

168
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:12,868
That man must be mad.

169
00:16:14,043 --> 00:16:16,034
l disagree.

170
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:20,980
He is absolutely not mad.

171
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:23,808
What is this case?

172
00:16:25,655 --> 00:16:26,986
ls this about the case
in the morning?

173
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:31,757
What is the result?

174
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:39,963
Nothing.

175
00:18:04,054 --> 00:18:05,214
For you.

176
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:10,424
320 for 7 tonnes.
Mrs. please.

177
00:18:18,335 --> 00:18:19,825
ls No 2 Canton Gas?

178
00:18:20,704 --> 00:18:23,366
ls older than our No A1 .

179
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:27,341
12% coals.

180
00:18:29,746 --> 00:18:33,910
The deferred cheque is OK,
to catch the right time.

181
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:37,184
How much?
1 7500 for a tonne.

182
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:40,484
Recently the transportation
fee is increased.

183
00:18:42,426 --> 00:18:44,257
9% coals.

184
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:46,156
The gas experiment in
Tokyo is finished.

185
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:47,924
How about the boiling
water yesterday?

186
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:51,695
No such case.
Deduct 1500 for me.

187
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:54,363
lmpossible?
Pay cash tomorrow.

188
00:18:57,474 --> 00:18:59,305
You are great.

189
00:18:59,443 --> 00:19:01,843
Yat, be careful of the incinerator
at the workshop.

190
00:19:02,513 --> 00:19:04,003
l said many times already.

191
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:07,414
We'd collapse for this price.

192
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:08,240
This is dad's idea.

193
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,851
Brother, don't make Shek proud of it.

194
00:19:11,055 --> 00:19:13,546
Kwai, what did you say?

195
00:19:13,724 --> 00:19:15,715
You are soft to be cheated brother.

196
00:19:16,494 --> 00:19:19,156
You need a guardian.

197
00:19:19,763 --> 00:19:21,094
Children shut up.

198
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,690
We forgot brother is an adult.

199
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:26,125
Four of you guys.

200
00:19:26,704 --> 00:19:28,535
Went to the court for what?

201
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:31,806
What?
Just calm down.

202
00:19:32,076 --> 00:19:33,907
l am impulsive.
Stupid.

203
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:39,777
Stop, don't make unhappy.

204
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:05,940
Who is that man?

205
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,271
Tung's Kong.
Does it need you to say?

206
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:12,939
Do you know him brother?

207
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:40,204
How are you Mrs. Chung?

208
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:42,235
Make up your mind?

209
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,270
You were worried before.

210
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:49,041
l was shocked to listen to his plan.

211
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:51,582
Maybe he was in a hurry.

212
00:20:51,823 --> 00:20:53,654
He might feel regrets.

213
00:20:53,858 --> 00:20:56,349
lt's true when seriouly
thinking about it.

214
00:20:56,894 --> 00:20:59,226
His decision is not easy.

215
00:21:00,665 --> 00:21:02,656
But the world is strange.

216
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,031
Some people quit.

217
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:07,601
Some people do.

218
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:10,066
This is my neighbour.

219
00:21:10,341 --> 00:21:12,832
He has a good farm there.

220
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:12,429
Don't disturb.

221
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:17,838
l have thought it over.

222
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:20,270
This is like to examine in person.

223
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:22,936
l want to let you study first.

224
00:22:23,682 --> 00:22:25,843
But that is a good place.

225
00:22:52,677 --> 00:22:54,338
You look.

226
00:22:55,246 --> 00:22:58,738
That is your house.
Really.

227
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:02,242
This looks comfortable.

228
00:24:01,212 --> 00:24:03,203
Whose is it?

229
00:24:05,216 --> 00:24:06,376
Please come in.

230
00:24:11,856 --> 00:24:14,518
Why does dad come here so early?

231
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,290
How are you dad?

232
00:24:24,636 --> 00:24:25,796
Lost the lawsuit?

233
00:24:26,171 --> 00:24:28,662
Stupid, don't need your concern.

234
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:50,288
This pay for this month.

235
00:24:57,569 --> 00:25:02,233
This is not good not for dad
to use the assets.

236
00:25:03,775 --> 00:25:05,936
The decision is not human being.

237
00:25:08,547 --> 00:25:11,038
l want to show you something.

238
00:25:12,851 --> 00:25:20,348
l saw the farm film last night.

239
00:25:21,693 --> 00:25:23,854
lt looks good.

240
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:27,826
Honestly l feel better.

241
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,161
Better to have seen.

242
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:39,004
They didn't say anything.

243
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,781
Like this.

244
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:51,079
You also bring mum's board.

245
00:25:51,323 --> 00:25:53,154
To migrate to Basil.

246
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,659
Dad.

247
00:26:07,606 --> 00:26:08,937
No thanks.

248
00:26:10,342 --> 00:26:12,003
Anyway l am too much.

249
00:26:13,412 --> 00:26:17,246
l don't want to be a burden.

250
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:24,916
As long as dad can pay
some living costs.

251
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,421
lt's OK for me to stay in Japan.

252
00:26:27,993 --> 00:26:30,325
l don't want to be a burden.
Don't bull shit.

253
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:33,387
You probably...
However.

254
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,131
You just feel good.

255
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,430
Dad will handle.

256
00:26:40,172 --> 00:26:44,165
Dad...

257
00:26:45,878 --> 00:26:47,038
St. Paul.

258
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:50,947
Mui.

259
00:26:51,117 --> 00:26:52,948
Studying Geography?

260
00:26:55,054 --> 00:26:57,215
The farm is near the city St. Paul.

261
00:26:58,057 --> 00:27:03,120
Don't be exciting after
seeing the film.

262
00:27:03,362 --> 00:27:06,354
Although dad asked us to go.

263
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:09,728
But l don't feel so.

264
00:27:11,036 --> 00:27:14,699
This may be disgraced.

265
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,432
Stupid, what are you doing?

266
00:27:19,912 --> 00:27:23,245
Nothing, let me say something.

267
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:36,684
How much for the
purchasing fees this month?

268
00:27:37,196 --> 00:27:39,187
l want to talk to you.

269
00:27:39,465 --> 00:27:43,128
We have to migrate anyway,
why have to purchase?

270
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,159
Stupid.

271
00:27:45,904 --> 00:27:48,065
However...
Understood.

272
00:27:49,975 --> 00:27:51,806
l'd rather die.

273
00:27:52,178 --> 00:27:53,509
Who said going to Basil?

274
00:28:02,121 --> 00:28:05,955
City St. Paul? No joking.

275
00:28:07,326 --> 00:28:08,987
l don't really understand.

276
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:16,828
Why are you against me?

277
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,270
l am the host in the family.

278
00:28:29,181 --> 00:28:32,014
How can you criticize my way?

279
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:34,412
Can't you follow me?

280
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:36,511
We don't need your concern.

281
00:28:37,156 --> 00:28:38,487
l'm responsible for the family.

282
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,022
Laughing at what?

283
00:28:42,695 --> 00:28:46,187
Dad is funny.

284
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,999
Your bureautic saying
makes people stay.

285
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:59,068
Don't you want to go?

286
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,511
Really don't go?

287
00:29:02,682 --> 00:29:05,014
That's right.

288
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,276
Why do you do that?

289
00:29:58,304 --> 00:30:02,297
Which one...

290
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:14,585
The second trail is on the 23rd.

291
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,179
Hold earlier?

292
00:30:19,826 --> 00:30:25,992
The clients ignore the warning
from the court.

293
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:31,000
To carry out his plan.

294
00:30:31,671 --> 00:30:34,834
His family said they couldn't wait.

295
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:39,072
That's right.

296
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:43,675
Please tell Mr. Wat.

297
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,055
Giving you more troubles.

298
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,371
Mr. Chung, express mail.

299
00:32:20,347 --> 00:32:24,511
There'll be a typhoon today.

300
00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:31,788
You are back.

301
00:33:06,827 --> 00:33:11,491
Dad's plan is not thorough.

302
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:15,195
Although he wanted to buy
a house there.

303
00:33:16,003 --> 00:33:18,995
How to solve the money problem?

304
00:33:20,807 --> 00:33:25,801
lt needs a good reason to migrate.

305
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,673
lt's funny to be afraid
to go abroad.

306
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,045
ln fact we can give him the money.

307
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:38,080
l directly talked to the Ministry.

308
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:41,457
This Basil migration plan.

309
00:33:42,262 --> 00:33:46,096
Just can be done silently.

310
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:48,027
Stupid.

311
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:54,470
Although we have no money.

312
00:33:55,008 --> 00:33:56,999
We can buy farms in Basil.

313
00:33:58,612 --> 00:33:59,772
What do you mean?

314
00:34:01,715 --> 00:34:06,209
The farm lord wants to go home,
it's simple.

315
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:09,815
Just do the barter.

316
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:19,659
This is illegal.

317
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:25,069
The law doesn't say.

318
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:32,806
Anyway, this is a clever way.

319
00:34:34,813 --> 00:34:37,976
Found any seller?
Got it.

320
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,297
You say first.

321
00:35:04,944 --> 00:35:11,281
Anyway your dad thinks it over.

322
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,815
Just follow your dad's plan.

323
00:35:16,622 --> 00:35:20,114
Listen to your dad's explanations.

324
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:24,327
l think it's not bad to migrate.

325
00:35:24,731 --> 00:35:29,065
Many people want to go to Basil.

326
00:35:29,602 --> 00:35:31,593
lt's not easy to buy a cruise ticket.

327
00:35:32,072 --> 00:35:33,232
Excuse for my words.

328
00:35:34,107 --> 00:35:39,773
You don't really understand
our family.

329
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:41,676
Please think it again.

330
00:35:42,582 --> 00:35:45,244
We are now so good.

331
00:35:45,618 --> 00:35:47,950
Satisfied with the current situation,
do you think so brother.

332
00:35:50,757 --> 00:35:54,090
We were brought up in the workshop.

333
00:35:54,327 --> 00:35:56,659
We don't want to leave.

334
00:35:56,862 --> 00:36:02,027
Can't imagine a day
without workshop.

335
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:08,004
The workshop is my blood.

336
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:13,868
lt's painful for me to drop it.

337
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,790
We understand dad.

338
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:30,429
- SORRY, THE ORIGINAL VOBSUB WAS CORRUPTED HERE -
- - p D i ffig h pi

339
00:36:30,429 --> 00:36:32,420
For our sake to migrate.

340
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,727
We thank dad in heart.

341
00:36:35,368 --> 00:36:39,202
But also need to care about
our feeling.

342
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,132
l teach French, what can
l do in Basil?

343
00:36:46,713 --> 00:36:48,704
The workshop employs workers.

344
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,249
You can't see the danger.

345
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:57,013
Dad, fate is not under control.

346
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,914
Everyone will die.

347
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,052
What radiation? Can we care?

348
00:37:03,663 --> 00:37:05,494
Brother is right.

349
00:37:05,965 --> 00:37:08,126
l accept the concept of death.

350
00:37:08,502 --> 00:37:09,833
But l don't want to be murdered.

351
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:40,422
Dad, l have a question.

352
00:37:41,602 --> 00:37:43,763
Only we got o Basil or...

353
00:37:44,071 --> 00:37:47,734
Yeen.
l must ask this.

354
00:37:48,908 --> 00:37:53,140
Recently our relationship is bad.

355
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,538
Still remember the man we met
at the corridor?

356
00:37:56,483 --> 00:38:01,648
l don't want to let them down.

357
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:04,617
All because of dad.

358
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:09,158
l need to take care of five people.

359
00:38:10,764 --> 00:38:13,756
Two wives, two children.

360
00:38:14,768 --> 00:38:17,760
And a child of the passed wife.

361
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,971
l certainly want them to go.

362
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,467
lt's so ridiculous.

363
00:38:27,147 --> 00:38:30,639
We can tolerate, it's bull shit.

364
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:34,752
You'd also talk to mum clearly.

365
00:38:35,655 --> 00:38:37,145
How can you let mum cry?

366
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,752
You should know it dad.

367
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,451
You are so wild.

368
00:38:42,662 --> 00:38:45,495
Selfish and not considerate.

369
00:38:46,633 --> 00:38:48,965
Don't ask us to be the victims.

370
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:54,504
Just go to Basil alone.

371
00:38:54,842 --> 00:38:58,175
And bring all the wives and kids.

372
00:38:58,645 --> 00:38:59,805
We won't listen to you.

373
00:39:00,981 --> 00:39:02,642
You are a bad son.

374
00:39:04,651 --> 00:39:08,644
Dad, stop.

375
00:39:18,832 --> 00:39:20,823
Miss, thank you.

376
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:28,769
Where is the boss?

377
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:29,898
Dad?

378
00:39:29,977 --> 00:39:31,638
Dad went to the court.

379
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:33,670
lsn't that finished?

380
00:39:33,814 --> 00:39:35,645
Today is the critical moment.

381
00:39:47,027 --> 00:39:48,517
Where is dad?

382
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,590
Has he gone home?

383
00:39:54,902 --> 00:39:55,891
How come?

384
00:39:57,037 --> 00:39:58,527
Let him go.

385
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,239
That means we win.

386
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:34,032
That's only can stop him from
using the assets.

387
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:38,861
What do you see Yeun?

388
00:41:43,244 --> 00:41:44,905
Just make it.

389
00:41:47,615 --> 00:41:49,606
Please wait.

390
00:41:51,852 --> 00:41:54,685
l have another thought.

391
00:41:55,289 --> 00:42:00,124
This injunction.

392
00:42:00,328 --> 00:42:03,991
ls only applied to addicts.

393
00:42:04,265 --> 00:42:06,426
Now he's only afraid of radiation.

394
00:42:06,834 --> 00:42:08,825
ln general this is.

395
00:42:10,004 --> 00:42:15,169
But he's abnormal.

396
00:42:15,943 --> 00:42:19,106
Doctors said he's OK.

397
00:42:20,215 --> 00:42:21,876
But his words are abnormal.

398
00:42:22,116 --> 00:42:24,949
This is the quarrel point.

399
00:42:26,154 --> 00:42:31,820
We feel uncomfortable to the bombs.

400
00:42:33,027 --> 00:42:36,690
l believe you have the same feeling.

401
00:42:38,032 --> 00:42:39,863
Am l right?

402
00:42:40,735 --> 00:42:44,728
But we are unlike Chung who
is worried too much.

403
00:42:45,306 --> 00:42:48,298
No underneath house is built.

404
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:51,400
And no migration to Basil.

405
00:42:52,814 --> 00:42:58,980
lt's not difficult to understand
his feeling.

406
00:42:59,987 --> 00:43:05,983
Everyone is different.

407
00:43:06,928 --> 00:43:12,264
How can we say easily
that he is wrong?

408
00:43:14,169 --> 00:43:17,502
l think the judgment must
be realistic.

409
00:43:18,907 --> 00:43:21,239
Chung has a view.

410
00:43:21,409 --> 00:43:26,904
But his family also has its ideas.

411
00:43:28,082 --> 00:43:32,075
This is human rights.

412
00:43:33,255 --> 00:43:36,418
lf we don't control him.

413
00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:41,786
He must sell the family assets.

414
00:43:42,797 --> 00:43:48,463
The family will lose support,
which causes problems in living.

415
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:53,204
l just make the judgment in
accordance with the report.

416
00:43:53,441 --> 00:43:54,931
That's right.

417
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:57,542
To prevent any accident,
we must do that.

418
00:43:58,313 --> 00:44:00,304
We must stop him from
using the assets.

419
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:03,177
This is reasonable, however...

420
00:44:03,551 --> 00:44:09,547
Your decision is childish.

421
00:44:14,496 --> 00:44:20,162
Chung's words have meaning.

422
00:44:22,804 --> 00:44:26,797
We even don't understand his family.

423
00:44:27,743 --> 00:44:31,907
Only let Chung suffer the fierce.

424
00:44:32,113 --> 00:44:36,106
This is the worries to radiation.

425
00:44:36,518 --> 00:44:40,852
Have we considered other reasons.

426
00:44:42,457 --> 00:44:44,857
Why can't we find
the root of fierce?

427
00:44:50,631 --> 00:44:52,121
Worried?

428
00:44:53,435 --> 00:44:55,426
Can't be observed.

429
00:45:02,444 --> 00:45:04,605
Why do we migrate
to Basil so quickly?

430
00:45:06,681 --> 00:45:11,015
l just want to leave the
disguisting radiation.

431
00:45:11,987 --> 00:45:14,148
lt's worthless to be killed
by this stuff.

432
00:45:14,556 --> 00:45:17,548
So l have to run.

433
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,152
Only chicks use the emu policy.

434
00:45:23,164 --> 00:45:25,155
Sons are a good example.

435
00:45:38,013 --> 00:45:39,844
Emu?

436
00:45:45,153 --> 00:45:49,647
Unfortunate, we all are chicks.

437
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:01,065
So how should we judge?

438
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:03,201
lt's hard to do.

439
00:46:03,906 --> 00:46:05,066
Yuen.

440
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:07,872
How about this suggestion.

441
00:46:09,044 --> 00:46:12,536
Anyway Chung is so impulsive.

442
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:17,074
Personal effort is so little.

443
00:46:18,854 --> 00:46:23,188
We may not go there.

444
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:29,661
Now we use the law to stop him.

445
00:46:31,934 --> 00:46:35,768
l think this is the best way.

446
00:46:43,778 --> 00:46:45,609
Tin, please let them in.

447
00:46:51,753 --> 00:46:53,243
This way please.

448
00:47:23,585 --> 00:47:25,246
Dad, it's eleven.

449
00:47:32,627 --> 00:47:33,958
What are you looking?

450
00:47:42,771 --> 00:47:45,103
Death ashes.

451
00:47:45,774 --> 00:47:47,173
Dad, won't you change?

452
00:47:47,309 --> 00:47:49,539
lt's bad if you also want
to go to Basil.

453
00:47:50,179 --> 00:47:54,673
You read it in the viewpoint
of a Japanese.

454
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,081
l think it may cause
a trend to retreat.

455
00:48:28,651 --> 00:48:30,312
Chun.

456
00:48:31,987 --> 00:48:34,649
lt's sorry to think about it.

457
00:48:36,292 --> 00:48:37,953
The lawsuit?

458
00:48:39,095 --> 00:48:40,255
Don't worry.

459
00:48:40,863 --> 00:48:43,354
Does the old man stop?

460
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:47,128
lf he appeals.

461
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:51,262
lt will be sent to the High court.

462
00:48:51,407 --> 00:48:55,241
Can dad relax for a while?

463
00:49:44,494 --> 00:49:49,488
The dream of 30 years comes true.

464
00:49:50,733 --> 00:49:52,724
The winter is unique.

465
00:49:53,269 --> 00:49:57,103
l also want to stay here.

466
00:49:57,907 --> 00:50:00,068
Do you want to sell the farm?

467
00:50:01,143 --> 00:50:05,136
You really want to buy this land?

468
00:50:07,716 --> 00:50:09,707
How much for this hill?

469
00:50:09,752 --> 00:50:13,711
Here is about ten yards.

470
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:18,792
Equal to 20 small towns.

471
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:20,888
How much?

472
00:50:23,066 --> 00:50:28,902
8.2 million.

473
00:50:29,505 --> 00:50:33,908
Can buy 4000 yards in Basil.

474
00:50:35,445 --> 00:50:37,936
Any deposit?

475
00:50:39,015 --> 00:50:44,510
As soon as possible, there are
other buyers.

476
00:50:44,887 --> 00:50:46,218
How much indeed?

477
00:50:49,092 --> 00:50:51,424
1 .5 million.

478
00:51:05,841 --> 00:51:10,005
Yeen, it's not good to do it?

479
00:51:10,146 --> 00:51:11,477
No other choice.

480
00:51:11,647 --> 00:51:13,478
Don't know if dad has other ideas.

481
00:51:14,017 --> 00:51:17,009
lt's no use even you know the
PlN number of the safety box.

482
00:51:29,932 --> 00:51:32,423
Brother, what to do?

483
00:51:41,177 --> 00:51:43,008
What to do?
We can't do anything.

484
00:51:44,147 --> 00:51:45,808
Give me some water.

485
00:51:51,521 --> 00:51:52,510
What to do?

486
00:51:53,456 --> 00:51:54,787
We are careless.

487
00:51:55,424 --> 00:51:57,915
They don't know dad is injuncted.

488
00:51:58,161 --> 00:52:01,153
They thought it's OK
to give dad credit.

489
00:52:02,165 --> 00:52:03,826
ln total how much?

490
00:52:04,801 --> 00:52:07,463
Really don't know what they think.

491
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:08,731
How much?

492
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:17,743
Pei Asso 300 thousands,
Chung lron 430 thuosands.

493
00:52:18,115 --> 00:52:21,778
Ko 160 thousands, Sam 150 thousands,
Hau 200 thousands.

494
00:52:22,552 --> 00:52:23,712
ln total how much?

495
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,084
1 .2 million.
1 .2 million?

496
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:32,718
Dad is great, he gathers
it within 2 days.

497
00:52:36,567 --> 00:52:37,226
Shit.

498
00:52:39,202 --> 00:52:45,198
Yeen shuts up.

499
00:52:47,844 --> 00:52:50,176
You are stupid.

500
00:53:00,924 --> 00:53:05,088
Can you lend me your
mum's term deposit?

501
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:07,620
What's wrong with dad?

502
00:53:07,831 --> 00:53:11,665
ln need, lend me first.

503
00:53:14,537 --> 00:53:18,200
No hurry.
l know it earlier.

504
00:53:19,776 --> 00:53:23,769
lf dad wants to appeal.

505
00:53:24,881 --> 00:53:27,714
You can't win the lawsuit easily.

506
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:29,912
Bull shit, l must win.

507
00:53:30,521 --> 00:53:31,852
l am not optimistic.

508
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,593
Don't you save?

509
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:44,131
That term deposit is important to me.

510
00:53:56,279 --> 00:53:58,110
The rights of the shop?

511
00:53:58,982 --> 00:54:02,315
Anyway mortgage it for
300 thousands first.

512
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:07,250
Repay you soon.

513
00:54:11,095 --> 00:54:12,756
No way.

514
00:54:15,031 --> 00:54:18,194
How about Mui's account?

515
00:54:20,003 --> 00:54:23,336
No account, it's bad to mortgage
the house.

516
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,571
Of course to give her an account.

517
00:54:27,644 --> 00:54:34,812
Just let her register first.

518
00:54:42,793 --> 00:54:46,627
Where is the flowers?
l am sorry.

519
00:54:47,197 --> 00:54:50,030
Not hard working.
What?

520
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,393
Have you received a cheque of
200 thousands?

521
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:57,066
Can you lend me some money?

522
00:54:58,074 --> 00:54:59,735
This is dangerous.

523
00:55:00,377 --> 00:55:02,368
l have no other choice.

524
00:55:03,313 --> 00:55:04,644
A difficult question.

525
00:55:04,948 --> 00:55:08,281
Take it out.
Take what out?

526
00:55:08,351 --> 00:55:10,342
Don't pretend, it's money.

527
00:55:10,721 --> 00:55:12,211
All spent.

528
00:55:12,422 --> 00:55:13,912
Have finished all?

529
00:55:14,224 --> 00:55:16,385
lmpossible to spend 200
thousands in half a day.

530
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:19,025
You don't look brave.

531
00:55:19,229 --> 00:55:21,220
Really haven't.
Don't pretend.

532
00:55:44,255 --> 00:55:46,314
Only these money?

533
00:55:46,657 --> 00:55:48,648
All spent on women.
Bull shit.

534
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,351
lt will be disclosed soon,
l'll go to check.

535
00:56:17,354 --> 00:56:20,346
To hide to avoid dad.

536
00:56:21,959 --> 00:56:24,450
To save a little every month.

537
00:56:25,529 --> 00:56:28,862
Although it doesn't help much.

538
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:31,590
lt's not enough, forget it.

539
00:56:32,703 --> 00:56:34,864
How? lt's not dad's temper.

540
00:56:36,774 --> 00:56:39,106
lt's useless for insufficient money.

541
00:56:40,644 --> 00:56:42,305
Although we don't know
what happened.

542
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:46,012
lt's a man to say the truth.

543
00:56:47,518 --> 00:56:48,849
lf l were him, l'd do it.

544
00:57:29,794 --> 00:57:34,458
You are good, so honest.

545
00:57:35,566 --> 00:57:37,397
l like you this point.

546
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:41,361
No hurry, l wait for your reply.

547
00:57:42,473 --> 00:57:45,965
l can't just wait here.

548
00:57:47,711 --> 00:57:50,544
l plan to go back in a few days.

549
00:57:51,582 --> 00:57:53,072
You don't worry.

550
00:57:53,651 --> 00:57:55,642
A good man keeps his words.

551
00:57:57,521 --> 00:58:01,685
You just go to visit my farm.

552
00:58:02,427 --> 00:58:03,587
l'll be the host.

553
00:58:04,996 --> 00:58:08,659
You go back tonight.

554
00:58:10,534 --> 00:58:16,200
When my dad said to migrate to Basil,

555
00:58:16,908 --> 00:58:19,570
l seriously objected.

556
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:25,842
Then there's on fire, the whole
home was burnt.

557
00:58:27,084 --> 00:58:30,747
lt's all fate.

558
00:58:32,756 --> 00:58:34,587
Man is lonely.

559
00:58:35,459 --> 00:58:38,121
The feeling of your son can
be understood.

560
00:58:39,697 --> 00:58:44,532
To repay them these money.

561
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:48,561
And discuss peacefully.

562
00:58:49,173 --> 00:58:51,664
Anyway you are father and son.

563
00:59:16,234 --> 00:59:17,895
Thanks.

564
00:59:20,871 --> 00:59:21,860
Wait, brother.

565
00:59:23,608 --> 00:59:26,771
The money can't be given to dad.

566
00:59:27,979 --> 00:59:31,471
This is against the court decision.

567
00:59:34,652 --> 00:59:35,983
Don't you understand?

568
00:59:36,254 --> 00:59:38,916
The court ordered that dad
couldn't use the assets.

569
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:40,851
What do you bull shit about?

570
00:59:41,892 --> 00:59:44,884
Don't be angry, anyway
it's not our fault.

571
00:59:45,263 --> 00:59:46,924
Dad, you deserve the suffer.

572
00:59:47,699 --> 00:59:51,191
Your impulsive action makes
us hard to follow.

573
00:59:51,902 --> 00:59:54,564
We ask for an injunction
from the court.

574
00:59:55,273 --> 01:00:00,939
No one can use the assets
without permission.

575
01:00:01,546 --> 01:00:05,038
Dad is illegal to do it.

576
01:00:06,084 --> 01:00:08,917
Dad's appeal is useless.

577
01:00:09,154 --> 01:00:11,987
But the money is collected by dad.

578
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:13,851
Dad can't have the money.

579
01:00:14,225 --> 01:00:15,556
Yeen.

580
01:00:17,295 --> 01:00:18,626
Yeen.

581
01:00:18,796 --> 01:00:20,957
Apologize to dad.

582
01:00:36,914 --> 01:00:39,075
Now the traffic is convenient.

583
01:00:39,951 --> 01:00:43,614
lt takes a few days to Basil.

584
01:00:45,624 --> 01:00:47,615
That is a good man.

585
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:52,593
You should feel OK.

586
01:02:00,399 --> 01:02:01,730
Sorry to disturb.

587
01:02:04,436 --> 01:02:06,097
Are you Mr. Chung?

588
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:11,273
Still remember me? l am Yuen.

589
01:02:12,911 --> 01:02:15,903
From the Family Migistrate.

590
01:03:03,095 --> 01:03:05,256
Mr. Chung.

591
01:03:10,136 --> 01:03:11,296
What can l do for you?

592
01:03:12,337 --> 01:03:17,001
l am sorry for that, honestly...

593
01:03:17,242 --> 01:03:18,402
Don't waste my time.

594
01:03:37,529 --> 01:03:40,521
l just want to tell you.

595
01:03:40,933 --> 01:03:43,925
And that bastard who
made the decision.

596
01:03:44,536 --> 01:03:49,530
l am not scared of any radiation
or hydrogen bombs.

597
01:03:50,376 --> 01:03:52,867
But you open your eyes
to see clearly.

598
01:03:54,746 --> 01:03:57,579
l am now not feeling good.

599
01:04:00,118 --> 01:04:03,451
All because of you.

600
01:04:04,823 --> 01:04:08,156
You made me like
a bird in a cage.

601
01:04:09,028 --> 01:04:14,364
Just to think about the radiation.

602
01:04:14,766 --> 01:04:16,757
Wait until die.

603
01:04:17,503 --> 01:04:21,997
And felling worser and worser.

604
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,933
But l can't do anything.

605
01:04:25,744 --> 01:04:27,905
lt's the most painful in life.

606
01:04:55,674 --> 01:05:01,670
That judgment is disappointing.

607
01:05:02,847 --> 01:05:07,011
l can't forget it.

608
01:05:08,787 --> 01:05:14,453
But do we have other choice?

609
01:05:15,594 --> 01:05:19,928
lf l were not a magistrate.

610
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:24,659
To think about it in the
viewpoint of Chung.

611
01:05:25,804 --> 01:05:28,796
He can't avoid the tragedy.

612
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:34,773
No one should be blamed.

613
01:05:35,948 --> 01:05:39,111
Since there are radiation problems.

614
01:05:40,052 --> 01:05:44,045
And he is more sensitive
than the others.

615
01:05:45,824 --> 01:05:47,655
ln fact that man.

616
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:51,019
ls very careful.

617
01:05:52,732 --> 01:05:57,226
This time he is stuck.

618
01:06:56,129 --> 01:07:01,965
This boring weather persists a while.

619
01:07:04,737 --> 01:07:10,232
The report says because of the
hydrogen bomb experiment.

620
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:18,081
Father-in-law should know it.

621
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:23,111
You should know better about
the effects of radiation.

622
01:07:23,856 --> 01:07:26,848
Better to be in USA and Russia.

623
01:07:27,893 --> 01:07:31,226
The radiation ashes come to Japan.

624
01:07:37,203 --> 01:07:42,197
Because of the weather.

625
01:07:44,042 --> 01:07:49,207
Radiation'd be gathered in Japan.

626
01:07:50,783 --> 01:07:53,775
We are the people.

627
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,812
Don't know what to become.

628
01:08:05,865 --> 01:08:07,856
Hair drops.

629
01:08:11,137 --> 01:08:13,128
Bone deteriorates.

630
01:08:15,074 --> 01:08:18,237
Then is all bad luck.

631
01:08:23,816 --> 01:08:29,311
We saw the nuclear bomb before.

632
01:08:30,956 --> 01:08:33,618
lt's cruel to watch.

633
01:08:37,365 --> 01:08:39,356
Have you seen?

634
01:08:40,335 --> 01:08:42,997
A little child.
Shut up.

635
01:08:43,338 --> 01:08:44,999
Sorry for my words.

636
01:08:45,373 --> 01:08:50,936
You understand everything and
decide to migrate.

637
01:08:51,013 --> 01:08:54,414
However...

638
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:58,182
Worried to an extent.

639
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:03,153
lt's useless to worry
if you are broke.

640
01:09:05,326 --> 01:09:06,987
Don't stand on your point.

641
01:09:07,762 --> 01:09:11,926
Let's be good.

642
01:09:17,271 --> 01:09:19,762
lnfact you are fortunate.

643
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:22,866
lt's not bad to stop you from
using the assets.

644
01:09:24,278 --> 01:09:26,439
Now you are having a quiet life.

645
01:09:30,086 --> 01:09:34,921
Where is the fortune?

646
01:09:45,767 --> 01:09:48,099
Asleep? Thanks.

647
01:09:50,372 --> 01:09:53,034
What? No way.

648
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:57,071
Haven't slept for a few days.

649
01:10:08,257 --> 01:10:09,747
Murderer.

650
01:10:09,924 --> 01:10:12,085
Japan's become a radiation country.

651
01:10:13,997 --> 01:10:16,329
Only invented this stuff.

652
01:10:20,702 --> 01:10:23,034
Where to go?

653
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:26,529
Go home.

654
01:10:26,943 --> 01:10:29,434
You also follow me.

655
01:10:31,646 --> 01:10:35,480
We should know what to do?

656
01:10:35,717 --> 01:10:36,877
Doesn't matter. Follow me.

657
01:10:58,908 --> 01:11:00,569
Sorry to disturb.

658
01:11:44,219 --> 01:11:48,212
What does dad ask us to do together?

659
01:12:07,776 --> 01:12:11,109
l beg you all.

660
01:12:12,714 --> 01:12:14,204
Follow me to Basil.

661
01:12:14,984 --> 01:12:19,648
The whole family go there.

662
01:12:22,591 --> 01:12:25,583
Maybe l am mad.

663
01:12:25,928 --> 01:12:30,592
But the radiation pollution is close.

664
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:33,926
Don't know when the war comes.

665
01:12:35,004 --> 01:12:37,996
ln war times no one can go.

666
01:12:38,741 --> 01:12:40,732
No one can go.

667
01:12:41,811 --> 01:12:43,802
Take the chance now.

668
01:12:44,747 --> 01:12:46,237
lt's not late to go now.

669
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:56,982
Can't let the children die.

670
01:12:58,126 --> 01:13:01,960
We can't let the radiation
kill our children.

671
01:13:06,536 --> 01:13:08,026
lt doesn't matter me.

672
01:13:09,671 --> 01:13:13,004
lt's useless if you don't care.

673
01:13:14,176 --> 01:13:16,667
But think for the children.

674
01:13:17,612 --> 01:13:18,943
l have thought this way.

675
01:13:20,282 --> 01:13:25,276
But l also love you.

676
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:28,251
How can l leave you?

677
01:13:29,725 --> 01:13:34,059
Please follow me.

678
01:13:40,769 --> 01:13:43,260
A letter from Basil.

679
01:13:43,739 --> 01:13:46,731
They are kind to invite.

680
01:13:47,175 --> 01:13:49,837
lnvite us to get the living rights.

681
01:13:50,678 --> 01:13:52,339
He is our saviour.

682
01:13:54,017 --> 01:13:56,178
Just go to Basil.

683
01:13:56,785 --> 01:14:00,949
Strangers also care us.

684
01:14:02,758 --> 01:14:05,750
Beg you.

685
01:14:06,228 --> 01:14:08,219
To follow me to Basil.

686
01:14:08,965 --> 01:14:13,129
Please listen to me once.

687
01:14:15,605 --> 01:14:19,097
We go together.

688
01:14:19,943 --> 01:14:21,934
Dad is doing of our future.

689
01:14:23,745 --> 01:14:26,976
l also beg you.

690
01:14:28,918 --> 01:14:30,749
To go with dad.

691
01:14:31,252 --> 01:14:36,246
Dad is the host and alright.

692
01:14:36,926 --> 01:14:39,258
Dad is pro-active.

693
01:14:40,228 --> 01:14:43,720
And he is considerate.

694
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:48,063
To go with dad, Yat.

695
01:14:48,871 --> 01:14:51,704
Yeen, go together.

696
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:57,209
Hau, let's go.

697
01:15:01,017 --> 01:15:02,678
What are you silent?

698
01:15:03,987 --> 01:15:05,978
No objection?

699
01:15:17,265 --> 01:15:20,928
Dad, l follow you.

700
01:15:24,773 --> 01:15:28,766
Dad.

701
01:15:29,845 --> 01:15:33,337
Dad.

702
01:15:34,984 --> 01:15:37,817
He's tired, just give him a rest.

703
01:15:38,354 --> 01:15:41,187
Give him some medicine to sleep.

704
01:15:46,963 --> 01:15:51,297
l don't want to be here.

705
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:57,733
Solve the account problem first.

706
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:01,173
ln case dad passes away.

707
01:16:01,444 --> 01:16:04,436
Have hm have a will.

708
01:16:05,215 --> 01:16:06,705
A will?

709
01:16:42,953 --> 01:16:45,285
Did sister take away all the assets
at her marriage?

710
01:16:46,155 --> 01:16:49,818
At that time we need to expand
the workshop, she didn't take much.

711
01:16:50,526 --> 01:16:54,189
We need dad's instructions.

712
01:16:54,365 --> 01:16:55,354
Otherwise it's not lawful.

713
01:16:55,732 --> 01:16:57,222
You always talk about
laws recently.

714
01:17:05,876 --> 01:17:09,368
A will?
What do you say?

715
01:17:11,415 --> 01:17:13,076
They ask dad to have a will.

716
01:17:14,116 --> 01:17:17,449
So disgraced to bless dad.

717
01:17:22,091 --> 01:17:23,251
Wait.

718
01:17:27,263 --> 01:17:28,753
What is relevant?

719
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,161
ls it clear to do that?

720
01:17:32,235 --> 01:17:35,568
Yeen can't be proud.

721
01:17:58,093 --> 01:17:59,754
Tired of her.

722
01:18:00,797 --> 01:18:02,458
Let her sleep in my room.

723
01:18:02,832 --> 01:18:05,665
This way, come on, it's OK.

724
01:18:06,169 --> 01:18:07,659
This way.

725
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:15,572
Dad calms down today.

726
01:18:15,678 --> 01:18:18,010
However...
We stop here today.

727
01:18:18,748 --> 01:18:20,909
What do you mean?

728
01:18:21,452 --> 01:18:23,443
The family judgement.

729
01:18:23,652 --> 01:18:25,483
Should let us attend the trial?

730
01:18:25,755 --> 01:18:29,987
We are busy at home, busy to talk.

731
01:18:30,193 --> 01:18:33,594
We also don't want to talk it now.

732
01:18:34,599 --> 01:18:36,590
This say makes people feel sorry.

733
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:39,165
But now it's the time.

734
01:18:41,105 --> 01:18:43,596
Let me talk to dad.

735
01:18:44,206 --> 01:18:47,698
lt's not easy for dad to calm down.

736
01:18:48,912 --> 01:18:52,905
Doctors say it's good for dad.

737
01:19:02,759 --> 01:19:06,923
lt's bad to ask a patient
to have a will.

738
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:27,881
Really sorry.

739
01:19:28,785 --> 01:19:31,948
Shouldn't come to disturb.

740
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:38,784
Look mum, the child looks like dad.

741
01:19:43,766 --> 01:19:45,757
Mum, don't you mind?

742
01:19:46,702 --> 01:19:48,533
What are you saying?

743
01:19:50,642 --> 01:19:53,975
Mum is not angry at you indeed.

744
01:19:55,211 --> 01:19:58,044
For the sake of the children.

745
01:19:59,715 --> 01:20:02,047
Stupid children.

746
01:20:17,001 --> 01:20:18,332
You look.

747
01:20:30,313 --> 01:20:32,144
All are your relatives?

748
01:20:37,956 --> 01:20:40,288
Your dad is so unacceptable.

749
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,092
Taken at the beach during
the vacation last year.

750
01:20:45,996 --> 01:20:47,657
We were very happy.

751
01:20:49,166 --> 01:20:51,327
Really very happy.

752
01:20:52,936 --> 01:20:56,770
But it may be too happy.

753
01:20:57,708 --> 01:21:03,704
l think that may cause tragedy.

754
01:21:04,682 --> 01:21:06,673
So we have been very careful.

755
01:21:07,352 --> 01:21:09,843
Now here it is.

756
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,149
Really don't go to Basil?

757
01:22:57,394 --> 01:22:59,385
Don't try to convince me.

758
01:23:00,231 --> 01:23:03,223
Mum and Kwai want to go.

759
01:23:04,236 --> 01:23:05,897
ln term of money...

760
01:23:06,839 --> 01:23:10,331
lt's bad if mum cancels
the injunction.

761
01:23:12,144 --> 01:23:14,135
So what do we do?

762
01:23:14,512 --> 01:23:18,505
How much can we share the assets?

763
01:23:19,283 --> 01:23:22,116
But staying in Japan
to be against dad.

764
01:23:22,386 --> 01:23:24,047
Not having too much.

765
01:23:24,522 --> 01:23:27,355
What to do with the workshop?

766
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:30,954
l seriously object
to sell the workshop.

767
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:34,261
We must keep the workshop.

768
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:38,992
Just get the workshop on hand.

769
01:23:59,992 --> 01:24:01,220
Please.

770
01:24:01,427 --> 01:24:04,089
Where is Chung's workshop?
ln Chuen.

771
01:24:04,362 --> 01:24:06,023
Shit.

772
01:24:06,432 --> 01:24:08,093
lt's really bad.

773
01:25:27,511 --> 01:25:29,172
Please explain it clearly to me.

774
01:25:30,215 --> 01:25:31,876
Why don't you pay attention?

775
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:33,911
Must be forgetten.

776
01:25:34,353 --> 01:25:36,514
All forgetten?

777
01:25:39,557 --> 01:25:41,957
Dad had reminded you many times.

778
01:25:42,627 --> 01:25:44,458
Check carefully before you quit.

779
01:25:45,563 --> 01:25:47,224
You look why it is so bad.

780
01:25:54,471 --> 01:25:57,304
Boss, l am sorry.

781
01:26:17,028 --> 01:26:23,866
No, l did it.

782
01:26:24,669 --> 01:26:27,502
Dad, it's not the time to save them.

783
01:26:28,405 --> 01:26:30,396
The police are coming to investigate.

784
01:26:30,642 --> 01:26:33,475
l made an arson at the workshop.

785
01:26:34,011 --> 01:26:35,501
lsn't it too exciting?

786
01:26:36,548 --> 01:26:40,040
Mum, you go to take a rest with dad.

787
01:26:42,254 --> 01:26:47,248
You won't leave the workshop.

788
01:26:48,059 --> 01:26:49,549
Not willing to go to Basil.

789
01:26:50,595 --> 01:26:53,257
lt solves the problem if
the workshop is destroyed.

790
01:26:58,771 --> 01:27:00,602
Kwai.

791
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,671
Kwai.

792
01:27:05,878 --> 01:27:07,869
What's happened?

793
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:10,371
Kwai.

794
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:13,850
Tell me what's happened?

795
01:27:14,619 --> 01:27:16,280
Why do you remain silent?

796
01:27:19,591 --> 01:27:21,752
What's happened?

797
01:27:22,394 --> 01:27:23,554
Kwai, what?

798
01:27:23,996 --> 01:27:25,987
What's happened?

799
01:27:28,334 --> 01:27:30,495
Kwai found the fire first.

800
01:27:31,737 --> 01:27:33,728
What did you see from the window?

801
01:27:34,907 --> 01:27:38,070
Who left the workshop first?

802
01:27:38,610 --> 01:27:39,941
Tell us.

803
01:27:42,515 --> 01:27:44,346
Kwai.

804
01:27:45,384 --> 01:27:46,715
Don't cry.

805
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:50,310
lt doesn't matter.

806
01:27:52,757 --> 01:27:58,423
We can build the workshop in Basil.

807
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,561
Boss.

808
01:28:05,437 --> 01:28:09,931
So you don't care about our lives?

809
01:28:12,679 --> 01:28:17,514
Boss, what do we do?

810
01:28:17,916 --> 01:28:20,908
Just leave us?

811
01:28:22,555 --> 01:28:24,386
All bull shit.

812
01:28:29,461 --> 01:28:32,794
What do you plan to do?

813
01:28:51,184 --> 01:28:53,675
Sorry, it's my fault.

814
01:28:55,387 --> 01:28:58,049
You also go to Basil.

815
01:29:07,066 --> 01:29:11,400
l can just consider myself.

816
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:16,433
l must save everyone.

817
01:29:16,676 --> 01:29:22,171
Please migrate with us.

818
01:29:22,749 --> 01:29:24,910
You go with us.

819
01:29:25,151 --> 01:29:26,812
Where is the money from?

820
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:33,422
lt's a question if
the workers want to go.

821
01:29:34,194 --> 01:29:36,856
Dad doesn't think of consequences.

822
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:38,961
The Basil man hurts us.

823
01:29:39,599 --> 01:29:41,089
To pretend a good man.

824
01:29:41,799 --> 01:29:44,461
He only wants to get dad
there to be a victim.

825
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:45,831
Anyway l won't go.

826
01:29:46,872 --> 01:29:48,032
Understood.

827
01:29:49,609 --> 01:29:52,100
So l refuse him.

828
01:29:52,746 --> 01:29:55,909
We can live in anywhere if
we are hard working.

829
01:29:56,515 --> 01:29:58,506
Even migrating to Amazon.

830
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:02,849
Even no guarantee of safety in Basil.

831
01:30:02,988 --> 01:30:04,148
There is no absolutely safe place
on the earth.

832
01:30:05,024 --> 01:30:07,515
400 tonnes of hydrogen bombs
can destroy the world.

833
01:30:07,593 --> 01:30:10,255
There are not just 400 tonnes
in the world.

834
01:30:11,597 --> 01:30:13,588
You can lie without responsibilities.

835
01:30:13,833 --> 01:30:15,824
You won't think about it.

836
01:30:16,570 --> 01:30:22,236
Dad is worried about our safety.

837
01:30:23,077 --> 01:30:25,568
You are all selfish.

838
01:31:16,963 --> 01:31:18,794
He burnt his home.

839
01:31:19,731 --> 01:31:23,223
Wanted to get the compensation?
lt's not interesting.

840
01:31:23,736 --> 01:31:24,896
He's really mad.

841
01:31:26,104 --> 01:31:27,594
Please let me calm down.

842
01:31:49,662 --> 01:31:53,996
Hydrogen bomb explosion?
How great is that.

843
01:31:57,904 --> 01:32:00,896
Too worried, stupid.

844
01:32:01,273 --> 01:32:03,104
Just let the minister worry.

845
01:32:03,742 --> 01:32:09,078
Only to drop the earth
to avoid radiation.

846
01:32:57,631 --> 01:33:01,795
To dad this result is not bad.

847
01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:53,442
ls it Mr. Yuen? Thanks for your help.

848
01:33:54,354 --> 01:33:58,256
No worries.

849
01:33:59,426 --> 01:34:01,087
Coming to visit dad?

850
01:34:02,129 --> 01:34:07,294
l can leave him.

851
01:34:09,436 --> 01:34:14,100
l think the judgment was wrong.

852
01:34:15,009 --> 01:34:20,345
lt's our fault.

853
01:34:22,181 --> 01:34:26,845
Should bring this to the court.

854
01:34:26,987 --> 01:34:28,545
Should have sent dad here early.

855
01:34:30,756 --> 01:34:35,250
To all of us it's a good result.

856
01:34:37,965 --> 01:34:39,956
You go to see dad.

857
01:34:50,410 --> 01:34:52,071
Excuse me.

858
01:35:26,346 --> 01:35:34,014
l am down to see the patient.

859
01:35:37,323 --> 01:35:38,984
lt's the first time to come across.

860
01:35:40,995 --> 01:35:46,831
Every mad man is the same.

861
01:35:49,970 --> 01:35:54,964
But when seeing the patient.

862
01:35:59,479 --> 01:36:03,142
The feeling is different.

863
01:36:03,449 --> 01:36:09,945
He makes me feel uncomfortable.

864
01:36:13,762 --> 01:36:17,095
Anyway he's mad.

865
01:36:20,534 --> 01:36:27,702
Or we are really the mad man.

866
01:36:38,686 --> 01:36:40,017
Please come over.

867
01:37:48,888 --> 01:37:50,549
l am Yuen.

868
01:38:00,635 --> 01:38:04,298
Thanks for coming.

869
01:38:06,274 --> 01:38:10,768
Welcome.

870
01:38:14,114 --> 01:38:20,610
lt's safe to stay here, no worries.

871
01:38:25,727 --> 01:38:32,223
How about the earth now?

872
01:38:34,702 --> 01:38:37,034
Human is living?

873
01:38:40,574 --> 01:38:42,735
Life is going on?

874
01:38:47,648 --> 01:38:52,142
lt's not possible.

875
01:38:53,388 --> 01:38:56,380
Regrets if you don't escape.

876
01:38:58,025 --> 01:39:00,016
Why don't they understand?

877
01:39:02,263 --> 01:39:06,097
Must leave this planet ASAP.

878
01:39:07,335 --> 01:39:09,166
Hurry to this planet.

879
01:39:11,306 --> 01:39:14,139
ls it burning?

880
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:21,012
The earth is burning.

881
01:39:22,116 --> 01:39:25,608
The earth is on fire.

882
01:39:29,991 --> 01:39:32,152
On fire.

883
01:39:34,996 --> 01:39:36,327
On fire.

884
01:39:43,205 --> 01:39:45,173
Burning.

885
01:39:49,977 --> 01:39:52,571
The earth is destroyed.
