All that long, long time ago...

we can see now--

the stars, the earh...

00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:28,808
the animals and plants--
not a single one existed.

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,736
only god existed...

10
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,293
and so only He
could have created them.

11
00:00:33,339 --> 00:00:34,931
And He did.

You are... ?

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,972
I'm Berha Mills, ma 'am.

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,169
And this is Edmund Tuttle.

32
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,811
Pleased to meet you, ma 'am.

33
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:36,531
You must be the gardener.

34
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,809
That's right. The gardener.

35
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:42,693
And this young lady
is called Lydia.

36
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:45,094
Have you had
much experience in service ?

oh, don 't let that angel face
fool you, ma 'am.

00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:50,250
She 's older than she looks.

00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:52,096
Can you iron ?

00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:56,329
what's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue ?

She can 't talk, ma 'am.

The poor little mite 's a mute.

oh.

00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,098
oh, but she 's
a good little worker.

45
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:06,288
I can promise you that.

46
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:08,773
All right.

47
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,253
All right. The other girl
I had spoke too much, anyway.

48
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:13,893
Follow me.
Mrs Mills, you and the girl...

49
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:16,578
will sleep in the attic room
at the top of the stairs.

50
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:19,850
-And you, Mr...
- Tuttle, ma 'am.

51
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:24,256
You could sleep in the shed
around the back.

52
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:27,530
As you can see, the housework
has been rather neglected...

53
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:29,888
since the servants disappeared
almost a week ago.

54
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,975
You mean they just vanished?

55
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:34,692
GRACE: Into thin air.

56
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:36,889
No notice, nothing. They didn 't
even collect their wages.

57
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:39,692
They... they just left us.

58
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:41,889
MRS MILLS :
what a strange thing to do.

59
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:43,850
GRACE: You 'll soon find out
there are times...

60
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:47,255
when this house is not
exactly an ideal home.

61
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:48,937
Hence my adverisement
in the newspaper...

62
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:52,289
requesting honest,
hard-working people.

63
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,978
There 's nobody more honest
or hard-working than us.

64
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:56,293
Isn 't that right, Mr Tuttle ?

65
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,409
oh, aye, we 're very honest.

66
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:01,451
And, um, very hard-working.

67
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:06,494
The kitchen.

68
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,336
I have breakfast at 8. 00...

69
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:10,335
the children at 9. 00.

70
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:13,451
Lunch will be served at 1. 00
and dinner at 7 30.

MRS MILLS :
And the master, ma 'am ?

72
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:20,608
The master went off to war...

73
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:22,456
a year and a half ago.

74
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:26,287
I've had no news
since the war ended.

75
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,738
which of you does the cooking?

76
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:30,054
MRS MILLS :
I'm so sorry, ma 'am.

which of you does the cooking?

78
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:33,936
You 'll notice what I'm doing.

79
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:37,369
In this house,
no door must be opened...

80
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:39,455
without the previous one
being closed first.

81
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:42,059
It is vital
that you remember this.

82
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:44,055
It's not as easy
as it may seem.

83
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:47,057
There are 1 5 different keys
for all of the 50 doors...

84
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:50,375
depending on which area of
the house you 're in at the time.

85
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:52,887
Mrs Mills,
from tomorrow onwards...

86
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:55,294
I will be leaving
a set of keys in your charge.

87
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:56,738
Yes, ma 'am.

88
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:58,656
The music room.

89
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,929
That old piano was already here
when we moved in.

90
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:04,938
Please do not let
the children thump away on it.

91
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,617
It sets off my migraine.

92
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:11,130
Silence is something that we
prize very highly in this house.

93
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:13,739
That is why you will not find
a telephone, a radio...

94
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:15,895
or anything else
that makes a racket.

95
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:18,089
oh, we don 't have
electricity, either.

96
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:20,369
During the war, the germans
kept cutting it off...

97
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:22,887
so we learned to live
without it. Let's continue.

98
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:25,453
Ma 'am, there 's no need
to show us the whole house.

a door, a sideboard...

104
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:41,098
or one of my children
playing hide and seek.

00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:47,051

to the children.

The children have
a very serious allergy to light.

They are photosensitive

00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:06,736
I know, but he 's in France.

165
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,897
That's enough, chatterboxes.
Finish up your breakfasts.

166
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:14,329
Are you going to leave us, too ?

167
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:17,655
of course not!

168
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:19,417
why should I leave you?

169
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:21,415
The others
said they wouldn 't...

170
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:23,370
but they did,
and then it happened.

171
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:25,296
Be quiet!

172
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:31,489
what do you mean, Anne ?
what happened?

173
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:35,578
Mummy went... mad.

174
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:38,292
-Nothing happened.
- Yes, it did.

175
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,216
-No, it didn 't!
- Yes, it did!

176
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:42,329
GRACE: Be quiet.

177
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:47,011
what's going on ?
I want those plates empty...

178
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:49,254
in less than a minute.
Is that clear?

179
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,569
Mrs Mills, would you
come outside a moment?

180
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:56,575
I'd like a word with you.

181
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:59,692
Yes, ma 'am.

182
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:07,218
The postman usually
comes every wednesday.

183
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:08,658
But I just checked
the letter-box...

184
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:10,894
and this week he hasn 't.

185
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:12,850
I'm afraid
I don 't follow, ma 'am.

186
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,730
This letter
should have been collected...

187
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:17,339
and delivered to
the newspaper five days ago.

188
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:18,778
It's an adverisement
for servants.

189
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:20,013
Since it was never published...

190
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:22,653
would you explain
what you 're doing here ?

191
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:25,497
oh, I understand.

192
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:28,497
Ma 'am, that's what
I was going to say to you...

193
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:29,972
when you opened the door to us.

194
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:32,408
The truth is
that we just come by...

195
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,654
on the off chance.

196
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:36,212
A big house like this...

197
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:38,727
is always in need of someone
who knows the ropes.

198
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:41,577
You 've served in a house
like this one before ?

199
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:44,133
This may come as a surprise
to you, ma 'am, but...

200
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:47,808
we, in fact,
used to work here.

201
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:50,128
Here ?

202
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:54,457
oh, now,
'twas a few years ago.

203
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:57,332
If you don 't mind
my saying so, ma 'am...

204
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:01,008
they were the best years
of my life.

205
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:04,256
That's why we come by,
because this house...

206
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:06,130
means a lot to us.

207
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:09,012
Perhaps I'd best show you
our references, ma 'am.

208
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:11,732
No, no, no. Don 't bother.
There 's no need.

209
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:13,849
So you say
you know the house well?

210
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,254
MRS MILLS :
Like the back of my hand.

211
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:19,291
That is assuming the walls
haven 't sprouted legs...

212
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,250
and moved in the meantime.

213
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:24,336
GRACE: The only thing
that moves here is the light.

214
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,771
[Sighs]
But it changes everything.

215
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:35,773
It's rather difficult,
to say the least.

216
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:41,018
one might
almost say... unbearable.

217
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:46,529
The only way of enduring it
is by keeping a cool head.

218
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:48,774
oh, yes, ma 'am.

219
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:51,379
I don 't like fantasies.

220
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:53,694
Strange ideas.
Do you know what I mean ?

221
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,697
I think so, ma 'am.

222
00:12:56,739 --> 00:13:00,527
My children sometimes
have strange ideas.

223
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,252
But you mustn 't pay
any attention to them.

224
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,177
Children will be children.

225
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,494
Yes, of course, ma 'am.

226
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:13,329
All right. You can stay.

227
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:17,333
Thank you very much, ma 'am.

228
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:30,409
It did happen.

229
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:41,817
NICHOLAS : "The Roman governor
tried to make them...

230
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:43,611
"change their minds
afterwards... "

231
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:46,810
"To make them change
their minds. " Full stop.

232
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,770
- "Afterwards... "
-Mm-hmm.

233
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:50,332
"He ordered them
to be beaten.

234
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:54,338
"But Justus and Pastor,
far from being afraid...

235
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:56,813
"rejoiced and showed themselves
willing to die for Christ.

236
00:13:56,859 --> 00:13:58,497
"when he saw this...

237
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,336
"the Roman governor

[Snickers]

241
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:10,617
what do you find so amusing?

242
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:12,058
well...

243
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:13,976
well, what?

244
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,408
Those children
were really stupid.

245
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,415
why?

246
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:20,177
Because they said
they only believed in Jesus...

247
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:22,779
and then
they got killed for it.

248
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:24,969
And what would you have done,
deny Christ?

249
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,418
ANNE: well, yes.

250
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,290
Inside I would have
believed in him...

251
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:31,058
but I wouldn 't have told
the ROMANS that.

252
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:35,570
Is that what you think, too,
Nicholas ?

253
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:41,494
I see.

254
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:44,929
So you would have lied
to the point of denying Christ.

255
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:49,211
You 'd have saved your heads
from the ROMANS, that's true.

256
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:50,897
But what would have
happened afterwards ?

257
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:52,088
when ?

258
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,289
In the next life.

259
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:56,375
The one waiting for us
after we die.

260
00:14:56,419 --> 00:14:58,296
where would you have gone ?

261
00:14:58,339 --> 00:14:59,488
Ahh.

262
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:01,052
where, Nicholas ?

263
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:02,578
To the children 's limbo.

00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:04,496
GRACE: what is
the children 's limbo, Anne ?

265
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:06,575
one of the four Hells.

GRACE: No. Let him answer.
which are ?

270
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:17,939
There 's the Hell
where the damned go...

271
00:15:17,979 --> 00:15:19,935
then there 's Purgatory...

272
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:21,253
Yes.

273
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:22,891
And the bosom of Abraham
where the just go...

274
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:24,611
and limbo where children go.

275
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:25,978
At the centre of the earh.

276
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:28,931
where it's very, very hot.

277
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:30,458
That's where children
go who tell lies...

278
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:32,490
but they don 't just go
there for a few days.

oh, no.

No, they're damned. Forever.

Try to imagine
the end of eternity.

:
Now do you understand...

289
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,977
why Justus and Pastor
told the truth ?

290

no playing at all today.

used to this house by now.

NICHOLAS :
what if we see a ghost?

304
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:42,131
Has your sister been telling you
one of her stories ?

305

I haven 't told him anything!

you say "Hello "...

No, Anne, don 't lie to me.

645
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:23,333
ANNE: Honestly, Mummy.
And she asks me things.

646
00:35:23,379 --> 00:35:25,176
Victor told me she 's a witch.

647
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:26,572
: what does she ask you?

648
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:28,496

00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:33,057
Her breath smells.

650
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:37,889

all the curains.

651
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:40,089
I don 't want any dark corners
where someone could hide.

00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,413
Yes, ma 'am.

You both search the right side,
and I'll take the left.

Perhaps they're ghosts...

who lived
in this house before.

658
00:36:57,699 --> 00:37:00,088
Don 't be stupid.
I've already told you.

659
00:37:00,139 --> 00:37:01,652
ghosts go about
in white sheets...

660
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:04,293
and carry chains
and go "ooo. "

661
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:05,567
MRS MILLS : Now, Anne.

662
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:08,053
why do you make up
such stories ?

663
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:10,090
ANNE: I don 't.
I read them in books.

664
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:11,970
well, you shouldn 't
believe everything...

665
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:13,168
that you read in books.

666
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:14,698
That's what our mother says.

667
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:18,129
She says all this stuff
about ghosts is rubbish...

668
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:20,056
and then she expects us...

669
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:22,169
to believe everything
written in the Bible.

670
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:23,652
And don 't you believe it?

671
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,848
I believe some things.

672
00:37:24,899 --> 00:37:27,129
But, for example,
I don 't believe...

673
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:29,693
that god made the world
in seven days.

674
00:37:29,739 --> 00:37:31,331
And I don 't believe
that Noah...

675
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:33,495
got all those animals
into one boat...

676
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:36,007
or the Holy Spirit is a dove.

677
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:38,254
No, I don 't
believe that, either.

678
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:39,971
ANNE:
Doves are anything but holy.

679
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:41,532
They poo on our windows.

any of this to your mother?

00:37:54,499 --> 00:37:56,137

[Knocking]
MRS MILLS : Ma 'am.

684
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:57,011
Yes ?

685
00:38:57,059 --> 00:38:59,254
They've searched
everywhere, ma 'am.

686
00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:00,812
There 's no one.

00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:02,531

Yes, ma 'am ?

00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,532
Do you have any idea
what this might be ?

691
00:39:13,379 --> 00:39:15,256
'Tis a photograph album, ma 'am.

692
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:16,732
No, but look.
They're all asleep.

693
00:39:16,779 --> 00:39:18,770
Look.

694
00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:21,379
They're not asleep, ma 'am.
They're dead.

695
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:24,728
'Tis a book of the dead.

696
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,610
In the last century,
I believe...

697
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:28,490
they used to take
photographs of the dead...

698
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:30,370
in the hopes
that their souls...

699
00:39:30,419 --> 00:39:33,092
would go on living
through the porraits.

700
00:39:35,779 --> 00:39:37,974
: There are even
group porraits.

[gasps] And children!

oh, it's macabre!

703
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:47,852
How could these people
be so superstitious ?

704
00:39:47,899 --> 00:39:50,094
grief over the death
of a loved one...

705
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:54,178
can lead people to do
the strangest things.

706
00:39:57,299 --> 00:40:00,257
GRACE: get rid of it.
I don 't want it in the house.

707
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:02,096
MRS MILLS : Yes, ma 'am.

708
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:14,775
Mrs Mills, it's cold.

709
00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:16,935
why don 't you come
and sit by the fire ?

710
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:31,016
Thank you very much, ma 'am.

711
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:34,768
So... tell me about
when you worked here before.

712
00:40:34,819 --> 00:40:36,935
Did you have
to look after children then ?

713
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:41,211
No, I was in charge of
organizing the housework.

714
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:43,819
Hmm.
were there many servants ?

715
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:47,613
oh, about fifteen.

716
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:48,853
Though in the end...

717
00:40:48,899 --> 00:40:51,049
there were just
the three of us left.

718
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:52,373
why?

719
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:54,569
My employers moved to London.

720
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:58,407
They came here
less and less...

721
00:40:58,459 --> 00:41:00,575
it being
so out of the way like.

722
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:04,817
So gradually the house
just became empty.

723
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:09,455
Everybody ends up leaving
this damned island.

724
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:12,650
My family left
in the summer of 1 940....

725
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:15,975
just before the invasion.

726
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:18,214
That was the last
I've heard of them.

727
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:21,617
ohh.

728
00:41:22,659 --> 00:41:25,219
I don 't blame them.

729
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:28,649
Actually, we left, too.

730
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:30,371
Although, you know...

731
00:41:30,419 --> 00:41:32,410
sometimes when
you leave a place...

732
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:36,816
it's like it's there
with you all the time.

733
00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:40,408
I always felt like I
never left this house.

734
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:42,609
why did you leave ?

735
00:41:42,659 --> 00:41:44,854
oh, 'twas on account
of the tuberculosis.

736
00:41:44,899 --> 00:41:48,016
The whole area was evacuated.

737
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:50,368
ohh.

738
00:41:50,419 --> 00:41:52,614
was that when Lydia went dumb ?

739
00:41:52,659 --> 00:41:55,457
Yes, I think so...

740
00:41:55,499 --> 00:41:59,208
though my memory's
a bit rusty these days, ma 'am.

741
00:41:59,259 --> 00:42:00,851
what happened to her?

742
00:42:05,979 --> 00:42:08,857
It was suddenly one day.

743
00:42:08,899 --> 00:42:12,733
She just... stopped talking.

744
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:15,612
There must've been a reason.

745
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:18,048
People don 't just stop talking.

746
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:19,452
These things
are always the result...

747
00:42:19,499 --> 00:42:22,571
of some sor of trauma.

748
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:24,610
Something
must've happened to her.

Did your employers
treat you well?

750
00:42:30,379 --> 00:42:32,256
oh, they were always
very kind to us.

They treated us
just like family.

01:31:00,659 --> 01:31:04,732
I got the rifle.

1463
01:31:04,779 --> 01:31:06,929
I put it to my forehead.

1464
01:31:10,939 --> 01:31:13,089
Then I pulled the trigger.

1465
01:31:16,699 --> 01:31:18,849
Nothing.

1466
01:31:25,299 --> 01:31:29,975
Then I heard your laughter
in the bedroom.

1467
01:31:30,019 --> 01:31:32,897
Ahh.

1468
01:31:32,939 --> 01:31:34,292
You were playing
with the pillows...

1469
01:31:34,339 --> 01:31:36,648
as if nothing had happened.

1470
01:31:38,179 --> 01:31:45,051
And I thought
the Lord in His great mercy...

1471
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:50,776
was giving me another chance...

1472
01:31:50,819 --> 01:31:55,131
telling me, "Don 't give up. "

1473
01:31:58,139 --> 01:31:59,731
"Be strong. "

1474
01:32:01,459 --> 01:32:03,097
"Be a good mother. "

1475
01:32:05,419 --> 01:32:06,738
"For them. "

1476
01:32:10,659 --> 01:32:15,528
But now...

1477
01:32:15,579 --> 01:32:17,092
now...

1478
01:32:20,379 --> 01:32:22,290
what does all this mean ?

1479
01:32:26,659 --> 01:32:28,012
where are we ?

1480
01:32:29,859 --> 01:32:32,327
MRS MILLS : Young Lydia
said the very same thing...

1481
01:32:32,379 --> 01:32:35,849
when she realized
the three of us were dead.

1482
01:32:37,099 --> 01:32:40,091
And that was the last time
she ever spoke.

1483
01:32:42,059 --> 01:32:44,892
But I couldn 't tell you
that before now.

1484
01:32:49,139 --> 01:32:52,495
Shall I make us
a nice cup of tea, ma 'am ?

1485
01:32:56,259 --> 01:32:58,250
The intruders are leaving...

1486
01:32:58,299 --> 01:33:00,529
but others will come.

1487
01:33:00,579 --> 01:33:02,535
Now, sometimes we 'll sense them.

1488
01:33:02,579 --> 01:33:06,015
other times, we won 't.

1489
01:33:06,059 --> 01:33:09,256
But that's the way
it's always been.

1490
01:33:11,179 --> 01:33:12,407
Ma 'am.

1491
01:33:16,539 --> 01:33:19,099
NICHOLAS : Mummy...

1492
01:33:19,139 --> 01:33:21,369
Daddy died in the war,
didn 't he ?

1493
01:33:21,419 --> 01:33:22,852
GRACE: Yes.

1494
01:33:22,899 --> 01:33:24,571
will we ever see him again ?

1495
01:33:24,619 --> 01:33:27,452
I don 't know.

1496
01:33:27,499 --> 01:33:32,095
If we 're dead, where 's limbo ?

1497
01:33:35,899 --> 01:33:38,777
I don 't know
if there even is a limbo.

1498
01:33:40,859 --> 01:33:43,612
I'm no wiser than you are.

1499
01:33:45,699 --> 01:33:49,692
But I do know that I love you.

1500
01:33:49,739 --> 01:33:52,412
I've always loved you.

1501
01:33:55,099 --> 01:33:57,977
And this house is ours.

1502
01:33:59,539 --> 01:34:02,576
You say it with me.

1503
01:34:02,619 --> 01:34:03,813
This house is ours.

1504
01:34:03,859 --> 01:34:05,338
NICHOLAS :
This house is ours.

1505
01:34:05,379 --> 01:34:07,449
This house is ours.

1506
01:34:07,499 --> 01:34:10,377
[All repeating]

1507
01:34:27,179 --> 01:34:30,649
Mummy, look.
It doesn 't hur any more.

1508
01:34:41,059 --> 01:34:43,892
No one can make us
leave this house.

1509
01:35:08,819 --> 01:35:10,491
Come along, Victor.
