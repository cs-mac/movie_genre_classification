1
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,648
You make a habit
of taking things
ain't yours?

2
00:04:36,713 --> 00:04:39,778
Your name's
Meecham, ain't it?

3
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:41,604
They sent you to
collar me, then?

4
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:44,738
<i>Yes, sir, they did.</i>

5
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,141
How much
they paying you
to bring me in?

6
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:48,799
Twenty dollars.

7
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,976
<i>Did they already
give you the cash?</i>

8
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:53,696
Not till I
show up with you.

9
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:55,074
I see.

10
00:04:55,142 --> 00:04:56,735
Well, you...

11
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,416
you help me find my
timepiece down here,

12
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:04,739
and I'll let you
bring me back to
the authorities.

13
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,495
Shit.

14
00:05:13,924 --> 00:05:15,418
Gosh.

15
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,530
<i>Sir, I don't know
what to tell you.</i>

16
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:19,610
I believe that watch
made a run for it.

17
00:05:19,683 --> 00:05:21,176
<i>Hell, no, it didn't.</i>

18
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:23,388
That's the problem
with your generation...

19
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,280
no follow-through.

20
00:05:25,346 --> 00:05:28,477
I've had that
timepiece 50 years.

21
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:30,434
<i>My wife give it to me.</i>

22
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,886
Man, we looked over
there, like, three
times already, man.

23
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:34,423
<i>Like I said...</i>

24
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:38,745
no follow-through.

25
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:45,280
Twenty dollars, huh?

26
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,718
Yes, sir.

27
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:57,468
I'll give you 25 to
forget that old
folks' home

28
00:05:57,534 --> 00:06:00,532
and drive me out past
Ackerman's Field.

29
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:46,070
<i>Ackerman's Field, man.</i>

30
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:48,656
Shit.

31
00:07:23,283 --> 00:07:25,423
<i>Looks like you
got company.</i>

32
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:27,912
You sure this is
the right place?

33
00:07:27,986 --> 00:07:30,319
My name's on
the mailbox,
ain't it?

34
00:07:49,423 --> 00:07:51,278
How much was it
that I owed you?

35
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,374
Just $20,
like I said.

36
00:07:54,447 --> 00:07:56,302
Worth every
nickel of it.

37
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:59,116
Twenty dollars
worth of distance
from Linden, Tennessee.

38
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:00,130
That'll do it.

39
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:01,189
Here.

40
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:02,211
No, shit, man.

41
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:03,366
No. No, here.

42
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,772
Okay, thank you.

43
00:08:05,837 --> 00:08:10,146
You know that girl?
She your relations?

44
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,490
Not by a
considerable sight.

45
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:15,043
<i>(cabbie)
I hate just
to drive off.</i>

46
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:17,027
<i>It's whole lot of
nothing out here.</i>

47
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,133
Way I like it. Don't
worry nothing on me.

48
00:08:20,204 --> 00:08:21,830
Suit yourself, Homes.

49
00:08:25,676 --> 00:08:27,912
Take it easy
in this heat,
man, all right?

50
00:08:45,673 --> 00:08:47,495
Howdy.

51
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:52,551
Who are you people?

52
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,036
What are
you doing
on my farm?

53
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:58,373
Well, my name's Pamela,
and I'm sunbathing.

54
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:01,569
Um, mama's in
the house,
I guess,

55
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,435
<i>probably cooking,
and I don't know
where Daddy is.</i>

56
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,420
Somewhere. Probably.

57
00:09:07,494 --> 00:09:09,882
<i>I mean,
what are you
even doing here?</i>

58
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,812
Why are you here?

59
00:09:13,477 --> 00:09:15,265
We live here.

60
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:18,364
Ain't you Mr. Meecham?

61
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:20,225
I certainly am,

62
00:09:20,324 --> 00:09:22,397
and this is
my place.

63
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:26,907
<i>Oh, I'm Mrs. Choat.
Ludie Choat.</i>

64
00:09:29,507 --> 00:09:31,809
Lonzo's wife.

65
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,144
You... you remember
Lonzo Choat?

66
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:36,129
Oh, Lord God.

67
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:38,944
We rented
this place
from your son.

68
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:41,343
Been here going
on three months.

69
00:09:41,441 --> 00:09:43,330
I was hardly gone
three months!

70
00:09:43,393 --> 00:09:46,688
<i>Well, we
got the papers...
and everything.</i>

71
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,858
We thought you was
in the old folks' home

72
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:50,368
over in Perry County.

73
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:53,280
I was. I
ain't no more.

74
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:55,645
I need to use
the telephone.

75
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:57,653
<i>Uh, we ain't got
a telephone.</i>

76
00:09:57,761 --> 00:09:59,799
<i>Of course there's
a telephone!</i>

77
00:09:59,871 --> 00:10:01,245
We always
had a phone!

78
00:10:01,312 --> 00:10:02,872
<i>There's one
in there, but...</i>

79
00:10:02,943 --> 00:10:05,877
<i>it don't work.
Ain't, um, hooked up,</i>

80
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,544
or... or something.
I don't know.

81
00:10:07,646 --> 00:10:09,075
You can talk
to Lonzo about it.

82
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,320
He'll... he'll be
here directly.

83
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,877
I'm an old man.
I may die directly.

84
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:47,412
Abner Meecham.

85
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,611
Is it true Paul
rented you
this farm?

86
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:55,316
Ninety-day lease,
option to buy.

87
00:10:55,384 --> 00:11:00,053
<i>I guess
this is news
to you, then.</i>

88
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:02,508
Sorry you had to
come all this
way out here.

89
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:09,292
Cover yourself, girl.

90
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,751
<i>An option
to buy, huh?</i>

91
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:56,775
Yeah, that's right.

92
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:00,591
<i>Let's get
one thing clear
out of the gate.</i>

93
00:12:00,657 --> 00:12:02,761
That will
never happen.

94
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:04,838
Will... never... happen.

95
00:12:04,943 --> 00:12:06,983
<i>You know why?</i>

96
00:12:07,055 --> 00:12:09,324
<i>Because you wasn't
never nothing but
a loafer, Choat.</i>

97
00:12:09,423 --> 00:12:10,916
You and your
daddy both

98
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,390
never owned so much
as a pair of pliers.

99
00:12:13,455 --> 00:12:17,961
Hell, that's my wrecking bar
you're holding right there.

100
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,036
You're still
as contrary as
you ever was.

101
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:22,343
<i>If you think you
can buy a farm
this size</i>

102
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:25,729
with food stamps,
you're mighty mistaken.

103
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:28,105
You remember
that time I
tried to rent

104
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:30,115
that tenant shack
out there from you?

105
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:31,814
<i>No.</i>

106
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,272
Well, I did,
and you wouldn't
rent it to me.

107
00:12:34,348 --> 00:12:36,038
Ain't life funny.

108
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:38,114
<i>I never rented
that house to nobody!</i>

109
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:40,837
It was built too close
to the main house
to begin with!

110
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:43,458
There wouldn't
have been privacy
for either place.

111
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:45,473
Hell, that
must've been
20 years ago.

112
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,456
You do remember.

113
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,537
Remember how long ago
it was I needed it

114
00:12:49,609 --> 00:12:51,170
and I
didn't get it.

115
00:12:51,242 --> 00:12:52,933
<i>And life is funny.</i>

116
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:54,975
<i>And you can forget
about your food stamps.</i>

117
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,838
I got
plenty of money
now, Meecham.

118
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:59,490
I'm buying this place.
I'm gonna tend
to it, too.

119
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,862
I'm gonna have it up
and running in no time.

120
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:03,935
I ain't seen none
of this famous money.

121
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:07,836
Besides, this place
ain't Paul's to sell.

122
00:13:07,943 --> 00:13:09,536
We fixed it up legal.

123
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:11,167
<i>If I was you, I'd
be packing my stuff!</i>

124
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:12,516
<i>We'll see.</i>

125
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:13,728
<i>We sure
as hell will.</i>

126
00:13:13,797 --> 00:13:14,976
Now, where's
that paper?

127
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:16,476
Right here.

128
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:23,068
<i>I thought you'd
want to see it.</i>

129
00:13:24,998 --> 00:13:27,070
Why don't
you step out
into the light?

130
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,312
I can see just fine!

131
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,529
This ain't
no legal bond!

132
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,458
The hell it ain't.

133
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,686
<i>Unless you
got something
else to say, then...</i>

134
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:47,547
Where are you
going, Meecham?

135
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,624
How you aimin'
to get back
to town?

136
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,966
Hold... slow... slow
down, Meecham.

137
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:53,889
Slow down, slow
down, listen.

138
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:56,025
Now, I can't
let you go
inside the house.

139
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:57,471
The furniture come
with the place.

140
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:58,966
That was part
of the deal.

141
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,414
But not my stuff!

142
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,171
Ain't none of your
stuff in there.

143
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,583
We cleaned
all that out,

144
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:05,623
put it out
in the tenant house.

145
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:08,031
Now, listen.
Listen to me.

146
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:10,267
If you want
to go over there

147
00:14:10,335 --> 00:14:12,823
and get whatever it is
you need to get, you can.

148
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:16,026
Then I need you
to be gone, okay?

149
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:28,183
Okay?!

150
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:47,218
Yeah...

151
00:15:51,058 --> 00:15:53,448
Ma'am.

152
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:55,528
<i>Lonzo is down
in the barn still.</i>

153
00:15:55,602 --> 00:15:57,391
I know.

154
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:03,437
I- I don't think
it's a good idea,

155
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,156
Mr. Meecham, not
unless Lonzo is here.

156
00:16:06,225 --> 00:16:09,389
I just want to have
a look around,
that's all.

157
00:16:09,457 --> 00:16:11,692
Check on things.

158
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,094
Everything's just
fine in here.

159
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:28,742
<i>That cab's coming
for you, I guess?</i>

160
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:30,090
What's that?

161
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:31,849
That taxicab?

162
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,502
It's coming back
to pick you up soon?

163
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:37,028
Exactly how am I supposed
to contact that taxicab,

164
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,791
Ma'am, you want
to tell me that?

165
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,802
<i>Am I supposed to use
that phone in there,</i>

166
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:42,818
<i>the one you broke?</i>

167
00:16:42,893 --> 00:16:44,419
Maybe I should
just walk back.

168
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:46,182
Hell, it's only
about 20 mile.

169
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:48,107
I'm only about
80 year old.

170
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:49,764
Okay, okay.

171
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:52,257
I'll leave when
I'm good and ready.

172
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:54,719
You tell
Lonzo the same.

173
00:18:03,906 --> 00:18:06,142
You ain't gonna
shoot me, are you?

174
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:07,256
Wha...?

175
00:18:07,329 --> 00:18:08,791
I wasn't planning to,

176
00:18:08,896 --> 00:18:11,134
but you go sneaking up
on me like that,

177
00:18:11,201 --> 00:18:14,813
I can't be responsible
for what transpires.

178
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,736
Mama sent this.

179
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:19,134
She said she bet
you was hungry,

180
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:22,069
and hot as it was,
you needed something
cold to drink.

181
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,932
Well, what did
Lonzo say about this?

182
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:25,689
He didn't.

183
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:27,613
He left to go
play poker at
Mr. Goodwin's house.

184
00:18:27,678 --> 00:18:29,368
Here, let
me help you.

185
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:31,129
No, I can...
I can... uh,

186
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:32,409
I can do it.

187
00:18:38,236 --> 00:18:39,927
Yeah.

188
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:44,468
Yeah.

189
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:51,608
Tell your mama
I'm much obliged.

190
00:18:59,098 --> 00:19:00,887
Is this
your stuff?

191
00:19:00,954 --> 00:19:03,605
I've been wondering
who all this shit
belonged to.

192
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,910
This ain't shit, kid.

193
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,733
<i>A child your age
ought not to use</i>

194
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:09,328
<i>that kind of language.</i>

195
00:19:09,402 --> 00:19:11,343
Lord, you cheer
a person up.

196
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:13,490
Are you always in
this good a mood?

197
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:16,309
<i>Just when I get routed
away from the trough.</i>

198
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:18,231
It's just a word.

199
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:20,205
I'm sure
you've said it
a time or two.

200
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,093
I'm 80 years old.
I can say whatever
I care to.

201
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:27,917
What are you doing
in here, anyway?

202
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:29,999
Making myself
some quarters.

203
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,681
You're moving in here?
Daddy won't like that.

204
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:38,704
I don't rightly care
what your daddy likes.

205
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:40,628
I'm sure
he'll give you
a lift to town,

206
00:19:40,694 --> 00:19:42,286
if that's
what you need.

207
00:19:42,357 --> 00:19:45,423
Ha! Folks in hell
will be eating
Eskimo pies

208
00:19:45,493 --> 00:19:47,913
before Alonzo Choat
hauls me anywhere.

209
00:19:51,092 --> 00:19:53,099
Well, if you're
gonna stay here,

210
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:55,920
you ought to get up
some nicer curtains, then.

211
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:58,856
Maybe even some flowers
to help get the
smell out.

212
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,582
<i>Yeah. Maybe I'll
even get me a dog,</i>

213
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:03,505
liven up
the place a bit.

214
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,675
Oh, Daddy won't
allow no dogs.

215
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,655
He can't stand
to hear 'em bark.

216
00:20:08,722 --> 00:20:10,379
You say he can't?

217
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,871
I had the
cutest little pup
when I was a girl.

218
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,407
His name
was Nipper.

219
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:17,328
Daddy hated him
'cause he was so loud.

220
00:20:17,393 --> 00:20:20,392
Plus he
shit everywhere.

221
00:20:20,464 --> 00:20:21,642
Sorry.

222
00:20:21,712 --> 00:20:23,085
<i>(Ludie)
Pamelal</i>

223
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:25,421
Mama and I
got church.

224
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:27,593
Well, it's nice
to talk to you,
Mr. Meecham.

225
00:20:27,663 --> 00:20:29,419
Just put that dish
out on the porch

226
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:31,111
in the morning,
all right?

227
00:20:31,183 --> 00:20:32,873
<i>All right.</i>

228
00:20:32,943 --> 00:20:36,619
If I ain't badly mistaken,
it's mine anyway.

229
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,172
What do
you want, Choat?

230
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,149
You're too late
for chatter.

231
00:21:25,224 --> 00:21:27,427
Hell do you think
you're doing?

232
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:30,627
<i>I think I'm
sleeping in the damn
sharecroppers cabin,</i>

233
00:21:30,696 --> 00:21:33,728
and I ain't
proud of it.

234
00:21:33,832 --> 00:21:36,286
I tried to be polite,
make this easy, but...

235
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,214
you ain't
gonna have
that, are you?

236
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,613
This is my place,

237
00:21:40,678 --> 00:21:42,466
and will be my place

238
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,922
till they lay me
in the goddamn ground!

239
00:21:44,998 --> 00:21:47,866
Now, go on!
Let me rest.

240
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:51,650
Being old and crazy gets
you a little extra rope.

241
00:21:51,717 --> 00:21:53,821
Best not hang
yourself with it.

242
00:21:58,532 --> 00:22:00,157
Old people, man,

243
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:02,365
don't know when the
fucking clock's
run out!

244
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:06,910
Son of a bitch.

245
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:18,040
<i># She's long, she's tall #</i>

246

You're back.

259
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:30,100
Did you run off?

260
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:31,794
I guess.

261
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,250
Are they
after you?

262
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:39,313
<i>Hellfire, it's
an old folks' home,
Thurl, not a chain gang.</i>

263
00:23:39,382 --> 00:23:40,659
Well, I
don't know.

264
00:23:40,726 --> 00:23:42,188
I don't know
nothing about it,

265
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,683
which is just as much
as I want to know.

266
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,449
<i>You get in
this morning?</i>

267
00:23:46,518 --> 00:23:47,891
Yesterday.

268
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,714
<i>Where'd you sleep?</i>

269
00:23:49,782 --> 00:23:52,203
Choat make
you a pallet
down on the floor?

270
00:23:52,277 --> 00:23:53,934
I slept in
the tenant cabin.

271
00:23:54,005 --> 00:23:55,728
That's mainly why
I come over here.

272
00:23:55,797 --> 00:23:57,390
I need to use
your telephone.

273
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,276
Gotta call Paul,
get Choat outta there.

274
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:18,993
How was it,

275
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:21,391
you know,
down there
in Linden?

276
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:23,399
It was all right.

277
00:24:23,473 --> 00:24:25,164
Was it?

278
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:28,429
That why
you'd rather sleep
in the slave cabin?

279
00:24:32,017 --> 00:24:34,187
They fed you decent,
and nobody...

280
00:24:34,256 --> 00:24:37,703
nobody mistreated you.

281
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,645
I got the feeling
if you died in your
sleep some night,

282
00:24:40,718 --> 00:24:44,264
they just move you out,
move somebody else in,

283
00:24:44,335 --> 00:24:46,571
nobody much
give a shit.

284
00:24:48,174 --> 00:24:50,083
That ain't no life.

285
00:24:51,853 --> 00:24:54,090
Ought to make
that call now.

286
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:02,474
<i>Hello?</i>

287
00:25:02,573 --> 00:25:04,033
They broke my phone
or something.

288
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:06,114
Dad? What... who?

289
00:25:06,188 --> 00:25:08,358
<i>That Choat bunch.
Who do you think?</i>

290
00:25:08,427 --> 00:25:10,402
Dad, where are you
calling from?

291
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,133
You're supposed to be
at the home.

292
00:25:12,203 --> 00:25:14,440
I'm supposed to be
where I damn
well please.

293
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:16,362
<i>Look, I'm
in the middle
of a trial, Dad.</i>

294
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:18,915
I want them out of
my house, and i want
them out today!

295
00:25:18,987 --> 00:25:21,288
<i>Laying up there,
sleeping in your
mama's bed,</i>

<i>eating off
her dishesl</i>

297
00:25:22,665 --> 00:25:24,640
You ought to be
ashamed, son.

298
00:25:24,713 --> 00:25:26,623
<i>Look, Dad, this is
too complicated for
the phone.</i>

299
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,704
Just get a cab,
go back to the home.

300
00:25:28,808 --> 00:25:30,270
I'll call you tonight and
I'll explain everything
about the sale.

301
00:25:30,344 --> 00:25:31,937
You can't sell
what ain't yours!

302
00:25:32,008 --> 00:25:33,285
Well, I'm your
legal guardian

303
00:25:33,353 --> 00:25:35,239
and the trustee
of your estate.

304
00:25:35,304 --> 00:25:37,192
<i>Look, Dad,
I can't talk
about this right now.</i>

305
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:39,938
You think you're
the only lawyer ever
to hit a golf ball?

306
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,973
Dad, go back to the
home. I'll call you
tonight, okay?

307
00:25:43,047 --> 00:25:44,258
Okay?

308
00:25:44,326 --> 00:25:46,017
<i>Hello?</i>

309
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:03,299
Take it y'all didn't
exactly see eye to eye.

310
00:26:05,925 --> 00:26:08,160
You still got
that old Cherokee?

311
00:26:08,227 --> 00:26:10,496
Yeah, I got it,
but I can't drive it.

312
00:26:10,563 --> 00:26:12,320
They took away
my license.

313
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:14,111
Why'd they do that?

314
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,851
I hit some folk.

315
00:26:17,922 --> 00:26:20,094
Who'd you run into?

316
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:23,129
Uh, Mary Margaret Davies.

317
00:26:23,201 --> 00:26:25,274
Oh! Is she...
she okay?

318
00:26:25,345 --> 00:26:27,134
Oh, yeah,
she's fine.

319
00:26:27,202 --> 00:26:29,143
I run into her butt!

320
00:26:31,297 --> 00:26:32,824
You tried
all them years.

321
00:26:32,897 --> 00:26:34,653
I reckon you finally
banged up against it.

322
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:37,628
So, how you get
around, then?

323
00:26:37,695 --> 00:26:40,086
Oh, Julie comes
over on Tuesday

324
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,013
after she gets
the kids to school,

325
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,948
and then picks me up
and takes me to
town shopping.

326
00:26:45,023 --> 00:26:47,838
Makes sure I
get my fiber.

327
00:26:47,903 --> 00:26:50,106
You know, it's amazing.

328
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,564
<i>After they raise
their own young' uns,</i>

329
00:26:52,638 --> 00:26:55,768
they come back
wanting to raise us.

330
00:26:55,838 --> 00:26:58,588
She was always
a good kid.

331
00:26:58,653 --> 00:27:00,147
How much you
want for it?

332
00:27:00,221 --> 00:27:01,814
I got errands
to run.

333
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:04,186
Oh, I don't know.
It ain't worth
much to me.

334
00:27:04,253 --> 00:27:07,218
Uh, $200?
Would you pay that?

335
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,682
Uh... I gotta take
a look at it first.

336
00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:11,544
You ain't got the
best reputation

337
00:27:11,612 --> 00:27:13,783
for taking care of
your stuff, you know.

338
00:27:13,852 --> 00:27:15,760
Let it rain in
your carburetors
and all.

339
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:18,168
Oh, I know.
I know.

340
00:27:18,235 --> 00:27:21,649
<i>At least it's
my carburetors.</i>

341
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,381
<i>(Abner)
I can't make out
what's what in there.</i>

342
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,068
When was the last time
you cleaned this engine?

343
00:27:30,137 --> 00:27:31,992
About a week
before never.

344
00:27:32,057 --> 00:27:34,228
Do you want
her or not?

345
00:27:34,297 --> 00:27:37,842
Yeah. I'll take it.

346
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,639
Uh, I don't have
enough cash.

347
00:27:42,712 --> 00:27:47,283
Well, $200 ain't gonna
cure any of my problems.

348
00:27:48,471 --> 00:27:49,998
Don't worry about it.

349
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:54,096
<i>He do that
all the time?</i>

350
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:56,173
<i>Yeah, that's the
noisiest damn dog</i>

351
00:27:56,246 --> 00:27:58,734
in Ackerman's Field.

352
00:27:58,806 --> 00:28:00,714
He starts out
about sundown

353
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,374
and keeps it up
till first light.

354
00:28:03,446 --> 00:28:04,875
That so?

355
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:24,334
<i>Good boy.</i>

356
00:28:28,946 --> 00:28:31,848
<i>Hang on, I'll get
your food in a minute.</i>

357
00:28:39,762 --> 00:28:41,582
<i>You still here?</i>

358
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:44,715
I live here.

359
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:47,597
That's what
you think.

360
00:28:51,055 --> 00:28:53,444
She sure is pretty.

361
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,777
This dog
follow you home?

362
00:29:02,543 --> 00:29:03,916
Something like that.

363
00:29:03,982 --> 00:29:06,403
Daddy ain't
gonna like that!

364
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:08,485
He sure is a cute
little thing.

365
00:29:08,557 --> 00:29:10,466
Oh, yes, you are!

366
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,231
You're a cute
little thing.

367
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:14,406
You even look
like my Nipper.

368
00:29:14,477 --> 00:29:16,548
Come on, come on,
let's do your business.

369
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,086
Can I tell
you a secret?

370
00:29:34,153 --> 00:29:35,266
No.

371
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:37,442
Well, you're no fun.

372
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:39,423
Never claimed to be.

373
00:29:39,497 --> 00:29:41,351
I got a date tonight.

374
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:44,961
Oh. Why
is that
a secret?

375
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,846
I didn't take you
for the homely type.

376
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:51,654
Well, for one, he's
a little bit older
than me,

377
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:54,567
and Daddy don't
especially like
me dating older boys,

378
00:29:54,631 --> 00:29:57,598
but really it's
because this boy's daddy

379
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,486
got my
daddy drunk playing
gin rummy last fall,

380
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,526
and when my
daddy woke up
the next day

381
00:30:02,598 --> 00:30:05,118
he was missing $40
and a Swiss Army knife

382
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,808
that my paw-paw gave him
when he was just a boy,

383
00:30:07,877 --> 00:30:09,438
but Steve Jr...

384
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:11,199
That's the boy
I'm dating tonight...

385
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:14,051
Steve Jr. Said his daddy
won it fair and square

386
00:30:14,116 --> 00:30:17,432
and that my daddy
just ought not play
gin rummy when he's drunk,

387
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:19,330
'cause he sucks
pretty bad at it

388
00:30:19,396 --> 00:30:21,534
even when he's
stone sober.

389
00:30:21,604 --> 00:30:24,025
<i>But Daddy says Steve Jr.
Just wants what's
in my underwear</i>

390
00:30:24,132 --> 00:30:26,302
and he won't stop
till he has it.

391
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:28,639
And then he'll probably
take $40 from me, too,

392
00:30:28,707 --> 00:30:31,007
but I don't
even have $40.

393
00:30:31,073 --> 00:30:33,888
I just think he's mad
'cause he lost
paw-paw's knife.

394
00:30:36,481 --> 00:30:37,495
I see.

395
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,617
Yeah.

396
00:30:38,689 --> 00:30:40,478
Oh.

397
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:49,109
You're not gonna
tell him, are you,

398
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:50,646
about my date?

399
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:52,694
A child
shouldn't lie
to her father,

400
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,003
even if
her father's
Lonzo Choat.

401
00:30:55,072 --> 00:30:57,242
Ain't nothing good
gonna come from that.

402
00:30:57,311 --> 00:31:00,060
<i>You and your rules.
I'm not a child.</i>

403
00:31:00,127 --> 00:31:03,421
I'm 16, and I'm not
lying to him, either.

404
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,875
I just got
some secrets,
that's all.

405
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,218
Everybody does.

406
00:31:08,317 --> 00:31:10,455
Who does this gun
belong to, anyway?

407
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:12,532
You ask a lot
of questions.

408
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,361
There's a lot
I don't know.

409
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:17,244
I bought it for my son
when he graduated
law school.

410
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,578
That's a weird gift.

411
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,295
I thought I
might, uh,

412
00:31:22,363 --> 00:31:25,080
get some target practice
back there in the woods,

413
00:31:25,147 --> 00:31:29,173
maybe shoot me a
squirrel for dinner.

414
00:31:29,243 --> 00:31:31,098
You're funny.

415
00:31:31,195 --> 00:31:33,649
I can't imagine why anybody'd
put you in an old folks' home.

416
00:31:33,721 --> 00:31:35,511
You seem fine to me.

417
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:37,072
<i>I am fine.</i>

418
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:39,732
Then why'd you go?

419
00:31:43,065 --> 00:31:45,269
I think I need
to get some rest.

420
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:49,112
Well, it was nice
to talk to you.

421
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:51,725
Bye, doggy.

422
00:31:53,336 --> 00:31:55,474
<i>You never did
tell me his name.</i>

423
00:31:55,543 --> 00:31:58,063
How about
we call
him Nipper?

424
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,704
<i>Hupl Come here.</i>

425
00:32:06,773 --> 00:32:08,629
Yeah.

426
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:10,930
Hush, Nipper, hush.

427
00:32:15,573 --> 00:32:17,166
Hush, Nipper, hush.

428
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:19,246
Atta a boy.

429
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:24,911
Hush, Nipper, hush.

430
00:32:26,771 --> 00:32:29,160
You're a good dog.

431
00:32:36,595 --> 00:32:38,285
Okay.

432
00:32:38,354 --> 00:32:41,649
Now, here we
go, Nipper.

433
00:32:41,714 --> 00:32:43,087
Hush, Nipper, hush.

434
00:32:44,273 --> 00:32:46,128
Hush. Yeah. Good.

435
00:32:46,194 --> 00:32:47,339
Good boy.

436
00:32:50,449 --> 00:32:51,659
Hush, nipper, hush.

437
00:32:54,448 --> 00:32:55,820
<i>Good boy.</i>

438
00:32:57,264 --> 00:32:58,825
<i>Hush, Nipper, hush.</i>

439
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:03,972
Hush, Nipper,
hush! Hush!

440
00:33:08,783 --> 00:33:12,460
<i>Hush, hush I</i>

441
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:15,657
How about shutting up some
of that goddamn racket!

442
00:33:26,701 --> 00:33:29,896
You even walk like it.

443
00:33:29,963 --> 00:33:32,298
What's that?

444
00:33:32,364 --> 00:33:33,738
White trash.

445
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,558
You even walk like it.

446
00:33:35,626 --> 00:33:39,718
Heh. It amuses me.

447
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,273
Must be great
to be so funny.

448
00:33:42,346 --> 00:33:44,037
Helps to
pass the time.

449
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,731
<i>Thought you said
that boy of yours</i>

450
00:33:45,802 --> 00:33:47,176
was coming to
haul you back

451
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,834
to the nursing
home today.

452
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:50,693
<i>I guess he
couldn't make it.</i>

453
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:52,833
Probably tried to call...

454
00:33:52,904 --> 00:33:55,718
but since you rednecks
can't pay a telephone bill,

455
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,118
he likely had trouble
getting through.

456
00:33:59,944 --> 00:34:01,635
Yeah, well, you'd
better find a way

457
00:34:01,703 --> 00:34:03,078
to get ahold
of him, then.

458
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:11,708
Where'd you get
that ugly thing?

459
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,953
I guess you
could say
I found him.

460
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:16,029
You'd better
lose him, then.

461
00:34:16,102 --> 00:34:17,923
Well, he
don't bark much.

462
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,989
Yeah, I heard him
not barking much
most the goddamn day.

463
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:23,330
He'll come up
with his neck wrung,

464
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:24,990
and you
may not fare
much better.

465
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,711
<i>Oh, he... he don't
mean no harm.</i>

466
00:34:27,781 --> 00:34:30,169
Oh, you hush,
Nipper. Hush!

467
00:34:33,956 --> 00:34:36,443
<i>I just don't think
he likes you, Choat.</i>

468
00:34:36,515 --> 00:34:38,370
That's all.
It's all right, boy.

469
00:34:38,435 --> 00:34:42,264
He... he... sh, sh,
he's all bark.

470
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:44,193
You've been trying
to start a fight
with me

471
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,428
ever since you set foot
on this land yesterday.

472
00:34:46,497 --> 00:34:49,246
I ain't trying
to fight you, Choat,

473
00:34:49,314 --> 00:34:51,419
just claiming
what's rightly mine.

474
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,686
<i>This is my land now,
Meecham, can you
understand that?</i>

475
00:34:54,753 --> 00:34:56,444
And I can
do with it

476
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:58,367
what I want to
when I want to.

477
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:00,826
I can paint
this house,

478
00:35:00,928 --> 00:35:02,335
I can raise
a new harvest,

479
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,992
I can...
I can... I can...

480
00:35:04,096 --> 00:35:05,950
bathe in that big tub
and lay in that soft bed

481
00:35:06,047 --> 00:35:07,803
and can't nobody
tell me different...

482
00:35:07,871 --> 00:35:11,644
not you, nobody!

483
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,524
<i>And that just eats
you up, don't it?</i>

484
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,208
It just claws
on your insides.

485
00:35:21,629 --> 00:35:24,182
That's what you
work for in this
life, Meecham...

486
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:28,245
land, to have a home,
to be a landowner.

487
00:35:28,317 --> 00:35:32,342
And I'm the goddamn
landowner now!

488
00:35:32,412 --> 00:35:34,834
How do you expect
to run a farm
this size

489
00:35:34,908 --> 00:35:37,144
when you can't even
keep the lawn mowed?

490
00:35:37,212 --> 00:35:39,796
You're in over
your head, son.

491
00:35:41,627 --> 00:35:44,594
Heh, yeah. Yeah, well,
we'll see about that.

492
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:46,576
Stupid old coot.

493
00:35:51,161 --> 00:35:54,194
Hell, I'll just
sit right here
and outlive you.

494
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:55,312
How about that?

495
00:35:58,745 --> 00:36:00,915
You're older
than Moses, anyhow.

496
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:03,318
Can't walk for shit.

497
00:36:03,384 --> 00:36:05,773
Falling apart
before my
very eyes.

498
00:36:05,848 --> 00:36:07,473
<i>Why do you think
your boy put you</i>

499
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:09,398
<i>out to seed in the
first place, Meecham?</i>

500
00:36:09,463 --> 00:36:11,470
He ain't stupid.

501
00:36:11,543 --> 00:36:14,096
Some point you gotta
let go, friend.

502
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:19,474
I ain't no
friend of yours.

503
00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:27,278
<i>That's right.</i>

504
00:36:27,348 --> 00:36:29,771
Go on and get another beer,
you miserable drunk.

505
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:38,736
<i>You're nasty when
you're drinking, Choat.</i>

506
00:36:38,803 --> 00:36:40,330
Yeah.

507
00:36:40,404 --> 00:36:43,153
Well, you nasty
just about all
the time.

508
00:37:16,432 --> 00:37:18,406
Well, I'm
going to bed.

509
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:22,343
When you coming?

510
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:24,421
(Lonzo)
I don't know.

511
00:37:26,253 --> 00:37:28,708
Don't let him
worry you, Lonzo.

512
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,643
He's just a
harmless old man.

513
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:34,571
Come on to bed.

514
00:37:37,836 --> 00:37:38,948
Please.

515
00:37:40,747 --> 00:37:42,339
Lonzo, come on.

516
00:37:43,851 --> 00:37:46,569
The way the TV glows...

517
00:37:46,635 --> 00:37:50,791
I can see right
through that gown.

518
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:02,147
This is
serious, Lonzo.

519
00:38:02,217 --> 00:38:06,177
Don't do something
you'll regret.

520
00:38:06,248 --> 00:38:07,591
Please.

521
00:38:14,152 --> 00:38:16,638
Don't you pay
him no mind.

522
00:38:21,543 --> 00:38:23,615
He'll be
gone tomorrow.

523
00:38:23,686 --> 00:38:25,857
This'll all
be over.

524
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:37,820
I got land now, Ludie,

525
00:38:37,892 --> 00:38:41,437
And I aim to keep it.

526
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,158
Shouldn't a man
protect his family, huh?

527
00:38:44,228 --> 00:38:47,130
What kind of man would
I be if I didn't do that?

528
00:38:47,203 --> 00:38:49,439
He ain't gonna do
nothing to me or Pam.

529
00:38:49,507 --> 00:38:52,059
It's the money
you need to be
worrying about.

530
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,596
What the hell
does that mean?

531
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:01,376
Nothin'.

532
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:05,691
Nothin'. It don't
mean nothin'.

533
00:39:07,521 --> 00:39:09,375
Ludie...

534
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,196
tell me...

535
00:39:11,264 --> 00:39:13,652
what do you mean?

536
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,316
You know damn well what I mean.

537
00:39:20,383 --> 00:39:24,211
Those checks ain't
enough anymore.

538
00:39:24,286 --> 00:39:29,043
We ain't ever
gonna get a loan
without any income.

539
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:33,427
You don't think I
can support this
family on my own?

540
00:39:33,502 --> 00:39:37,429
<i>You don't think
I can bring in
a proper harvest?</i>

541
00:39:37,533 --> 00:39:40,151
Well, you ain't even
planted anything yet.

542
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,456
That's because the whole
goddamn equipment's broke.

543
00:39:42,524 --> 00:39:45,012
He left it broken,
I gotta fix it,
and it ain't easy!

544
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:47,188
I know. I know.

545
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,364
If we don't
have the rest
of that down payment

546
00:39:49,435 --> 00:39:51,672
in a couple weeks,
we're gonna lose
this place

547
00:39:51,738 --> 00:39:53,364
and what we
already put
into it.

548
00:39:55,898 --> 00:39:57,905
I'll get the loan, Ludie.

549
00:39:57,977 --> 00:39:59,833
Okay.

550
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,523
Just...

551
00:40:01,594 --> 00:40:03,829
tell me how.

552
00:40:05,753 --> 00:40:08,884
You're just
like him,
ain't you?

553
00:40:08,954 --> 00:40:11,091
You're just
like all them.

554
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,687
You don't think
a man can change,

555
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:14,482
make something
better of himself.

556
00:40:14,552 --> 00:40:15,501
That's not true!

557
00:40:15,577 --> 00:40:17,103
Oh, it's true.

558
00:40:19,991 --> 00:40:21,682
Well, I'll show you.

559
00:40:21,751 --> 00:40:23,823
I'll show the
goddamn lot of you.

560
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:28,236
And get off me.

561
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:32,944
Get off me, Ludie!

562
00:41:20,463 --> 00:41:22,951
Last year
I fell down
the porch steps

563
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:25,893
and broke my hip.

564
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:27,908
Just slipped
on a patch of ice

565
00:41:27,982 --> 00:41:30,698
and boom,
that was it.

566
00:41:30,766 --> 00:41:33,417
<i>I couldn't
move at all
laying there,</i>

567
00:41:33,486 --> 00:41:35,012
<i>pain like...</i>

568
00:41:35,086 --> 00:41:37,158
<i>nothing you
can imagine,</i>

569
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,756
like some
blade of fire

570
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,676
slicing up
the side of
my body.

571
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,594
This was a...

572
00:41:46,668 --> 00:41:51,273
this was a Sunday
about dusk, and...

573
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,209
it was late December,
around Christmas.

574
00:41:56,075 --> 00:41:58,311
It was real cold.

575
00:41:58,379 --> 00:42:01,030
I hollered
and carried on,
but this far out,

576
00:42:01,098 --> 00:42:03,487
ain't nobody gonna...

577
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:05,471
nobody gonna hear ya.

578
00:42:09,162 --> 00:42:10,656
Then darkness come

579
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,769
and, uh, all I could do
was just lay there,

580
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,222
foot of them steps,
and ache.

581
00:42:16,297 --> 00:42:20,071
I thought my time
had come, I truly did.

582
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:23,004
Next morning,
Thurl Chessor
happened up on me.

583
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,375
Just... stopped
by on a whim.

584
00:42:26,439 --> 00:42:28,065
It saved my life.

585
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:33,309
Spent a few weeks
at a hospital,

586
00:42:33,383 --> 00:42:35,968
got myself a new hip.

587
00:42:37,414 --> 00:42:39,421
And I come
back out here.

588
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:42,942
To my home.

589
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:47,969
I knew pretty quick, uh,

590
00:42:48,036 --> 00:42:50,458
I couldn't tend
the farm no more,

591
00:42:50,533 --> 00:42:53,978
just didn't have it in me,
didn't have the strength.

592
00:42:55,332 --> 00:42:57,305
Paul had told me I...

593
00:42:57,379 --> 00:42:59,168
needed a change...

594
00:43:00,675 --> 00:43:02,366
needed to meet people.

595
00:43:02,435 --> 00:43:05,402
Being out
here all by myself
wasn't good for me.

596
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,360
I reckon I was in
a good deal of pain
at the time,

597
00:43:10,434 --> 00:43:13,499
feeling pretty
lonely, and so...

598
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,220
seemed like
a good idea.

599
00:43:19,712 --> 00:43:20,825
But I...

600
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:26,100
I was lonelier there with
all them people around...

601
00:43:28,928 --> 00:43:31,861
than I ever was
out here by myself.

602
00:43:38,941 --> 00:43:40,054
Hey.

603
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:42,738
That's a boy.

604
00:43:42,815 --> 00:43:44,669
Yeah.

605
00:43:44,734 --> 00:43:47,898
That's a good boy.

606
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,616
Where's Pam?

607
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:06,260
Out with Neely Watkins
and that gang, I think.

608
00:44:07,642 --> 00:44:09,070
You think?

609
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,055
Yeah.

610
00:44:11,129 --> 00:44:13,496
Think they were
going down to the
Snow White Cafe

611
00:44:13,562 --> 00:44:16,595
or somewhere in town.

612
00:44:16,665 --> 00:44:19,153
You think or you know?

613
00:44:21,497 --> 00:44:22,773
I don't know.

614
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:36,976
Who else
is with them?

615
00:44:38,294 --> 00:44:41,011
Steve Jr. With them?

616
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:42,900
It's just Neely
picked her up.

617
00:46:01,228 --> 00:46:03,562
<i>But wait. Hey, man. Wait I</i>

618
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:06,825
<i>What are you
doing, boy, huh?</i>

619
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,353
<i>What are
you doing I</i>

620
00:46:08,427 --> 00:46:09,953
<i>(Pamela)
Daddy I
stop it I</i>

621
00:46:10,026 --> 00:46:11,041
<i>Get outta
that damn
car, boy I</i>

622
00:46:11,115 --> 00:46:13,154
<i>Daddy, stop it.</i>

623
00:46:13,227 --> 00:46:14,501
<i>What are you doing?
I told you not to
go out with him.</i>

624
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:15,618
<i>Nothing's going on.</i>

625
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,184
<i>Wait I</i>

626
00:46:17,289 --> 00:46:18,183
<i>Get your ass out...
I'll kick him...</i>

627
00:46:18,282 --> 00:46:19,295
<i>Mama! Mama!</i>

628
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:21,191
<i>I will kill you I</i>

629
00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:22,151
<i>Huh, you wanna
go with me?
Get your ass...</i>

630
00:46:22,249 --> 00:46:23,526
Mama!
Mama!

631
00:46:23,593 --> 00:46:25,022
Comin' here
with my daughter...

632
00:46:25,128 --> 00:46:26,274
I told you never
to come by here, boy!

633
00:46:26,345 --> 00:46:27,393
Mama!

634
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,337
<i>Stop it I</i>

635
00:46:30,407 --> 00:46:32,000
<i>Stop it, Daddy I</i>

636
00:46:32,072 --> 00:46:33,927
Get your ass up!

637
00:46:35,206 --> 00:46:36,188
No! No!

638
00:46:36,264 --> 00:46:38,652
Yeah! Damn you!

639
00:46:38,759 --> 00:46:41,541
Stop it!
Daddy, stop it!

640
00:46:41,607 --> 00:46:42,653
Get off of me!

641
00:46:44,998 --> 00:46:46,656
Get off... God!

642
00:46:46,725 --> 00:46:48,068
<i>Stop it I
Lonzo, stop it!</i>

643
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:49,541
<i>You wanna
go with me?</i>

644
00:46:49,638 --> 00:46:50,814
Aah! No, please,
leave it alone now!

645
00:46:57,221 --> 00:47:01,376
Get your goddamn ass outta here!

646
00:47:01,476 --> 00:47:03,297
<i>Lonzo, just go
inside, baby!</i>

647
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:05,468
How many times
do I gotta tell
you, girl...

648
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,749
Just go
inside, baby!

649
00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:08,248
Get your ass
outta my way!

650
00:47:08,324 --> 00:47:09,271
You little slut.

651
00:47:09,347 --> 00:47:10,394
<i>Stop it!</i>

652
00:47:10,466 --> 00:47:11,449
You...

653
00:47:11,556 --> 00:47:12,417
<i>Stop it!</i>

654
00:47:24,546 --> 00:47:28,156
I ain't gonna stand
here and watch you
beat folks, Choat.

655
00:47:28,226 --> 00:47:29,785
That's a
young girl, there.

656
00:47:29,856 --> 00:47:32,823
A child,
not a dumb brute.

657
00:47:32,895 --> 00:47:34,902
You better get
your goddamn ass

658
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:37,310
back in
that house
right now!

659
00:47:37,377 --> 00:47:39,383
You raise
that hose
one more time,

660
00:47:39,455 --> 00:47:42,270
and I'll lay a slug
right in that rabbit
turd you call a brain.

661
00:47:42,334 --> 00:47:45,530
You ain't got
the balls, Meecham.

662
00:47:50,782 --> 00:47:53,268
<i>Gonna call
the High Sheriff
in the morning, too,</i>

663
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,869
First thing.

664
00:47:54,942 --> 00:47:57,112
There's bound
to be laws
against beating

665
00:47:57,182 --> 00:47:58,904
<i>young girls
with garden hoses.</i>

666
00:47:58,973 --> 00:48:00,729
You'll regret
this, Meecham.

667
00:48:00,796 --> 00:48:03,217
You'll be sorry
every day of
your life

668
00:48:03,293 --> 00:48:05,364
that you shot
toward me.

669
00:48:05,436 --> 00:48:07,376
Get this circus
out of my yard

670
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,840
so a man can get
some sleep.

671
00:48:13,851 --> 00:48:15,280
Let's get
you inside.

672
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,402
You okay, baby?

673
00:48:36,787 --> 00:48:41,970
<i>No returns or exchanges.
Company policy.</i>

674
00:48:42,067 --> 00:48:44,042
I wouldn't even
consider it.

675
00:48:44,115 --> 00:48:48,851
Best damn dog
I ever knew.

676
00:48:48,949 --> 00:48:52,211
Your boy called
last evening.

677
00:48:52,308 --> 00:48:53,966
Said you were
supposed to
go back

678
00:48:54,036 --> 00:48:56,208
to the nursing home,
but you never went.

679
00:48:56,277 --> 00:48:57,739
Yeah?

680
00:48:57,812 --> 00:49:00,365
I'd have come
and told you
last night,

681
00:49:00,436 --> 00:49:03,404
but, uh, you
got my car,
of course,

682
00:49:03,476 --> 00:49:06,772
and I'm too lazy
to walk all that way.

683
00:49:06,837 --> 00:49:08,747
How come you
not to go?

684
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:10,228
It's my farm, Thurl.

685
00:49:10,292 --> 00:49:11,668
Can't just let it go

686
00:49:11,734 --> 00:49:13,261
like it don't mean
nothing to me.

687
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:15,024
<i>Said he was going
to come down here</i>

688
00:49:15,093 --> 00:49:16,784
<i>and fetch you back.</i>

689
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:18,380
That a fact?

690
00:49:18,453 --> 00:49:20,210
He say when?

691
00:49:20,278 --> 00:49:21,969
Well, maybe today.

692
00:49:22,038 --> 00:49:23,793
More likely tomorrow.

693
00:49:23,862 --> 00:49:26,545
He don't know. He's
busy with that trial
down there.

694
00:49:26,613 --> 00:49:28,436
Busy, huh?

695
00:49:28,503 --> 00:49:31,634
<i>Kid's got a
right to make
a living, Abner.</i>

696
00:49:31,703 --> 00:49:33,426
You ought to
be glad for him.

697
00:49:33,493 --> 00:49:34,922
He got out
of this town,

698
00:49:34,998 --> 00:49:36,656
<i>making something
of himself.</i>

699
00:49:36,758 --> 00:49:38,765
I am glad for him, Thurl,
but there's a difference

700
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:40,300
between leaving home

701
00:49:40,374 --> 00:49:42,611
and forgetting
the place altogether.

702
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:45,105
You want some coffee?

703
00:49:45,175 --> 00:49:47,029
<i>No, thanks...</i>

704
00:49:47,095 --> 00:49:48,437
<i>but I... I would like
to use your
phone again.</i>

705
00:49:48,503 --> 00:49:50,194
I gotta call Ma Bell

706
00:49:50,263 --> 00:49:53,230
and get one of her boys
out here to fix my phone.

707
00:49:53,303 --> 00:49:55,824
Go and help yourself.
It's in the same place.

708
00:50:30,297 --> 00:50:33,080
<i>Thought I heard
shots last night.</i>

709
00:50:33,146 --> 00:50:35,567
<i>(Abner)
This is
Tennessee, Thurl.</i>

710
00:50:35,641 --> 00:50:38,128
Gunshots are a
daily occurrence.

711
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,208
Not a nightly one.

712
00:50:42,553 --> 00:50:44,146
Aw, hell.

713
00:50:46,137 --> 00:50:48,527
Choat was beating on
those two girls of his

714
00:50:48,603 --> 00:50:50,512
like they
was racehorses.

715
00:50:50,585 --> 00:50:52,953
Using a garden hose,
for Pete's sake,

716
00:50:53,018 --> 00:50:55,188
with a metal tip!

717
00:50:55,258 --> 00:50:56,949
He must've been drunk.

718
00:50:57,018 --> 00:50:59,189
Seems to me
he's always drunk.

719
00:50:59,258 --> 00:51:01,746
Don't know how
he ever kept
a job.

720
00:51:01,817 --> 00:51:03,957
Choat ain't
got no job.

721
00:51:04,026 --> 00:51:07,954
He ain't held a job
in, oh, damn near
a decade.

722
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:11,991
I- I don't follow.

723
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:14,612
Well, he pays his rent
with disability checks,

724
00:51:14,683 --> 00:51:16,624
that and the big cash
settlement he got,

725
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,609
which he probably
already squandered.

726
00:51:18,683 --> 00:51:20,690
I thought
you knew that.

727
00:51:20,763 --> 00:51:22,770
First I ever
heard of it.

728
00:51:22,843 --> 00:51:24,698
Don't you remember
when that Tate boy

729
00:51:24,763 --> 00:51:27,960
dropped a
load of lumber
almost on his head?

730
00:51:28,026 --> 00:51:30,361
<i>They was hauling
for Doug Watson
at the time.</i>

731
00:51:30,428 --> 00:51:32,217
No.

732
00:51:32,316 --> 00:51:36,472
Well, Choat wandered
into that Tate boy's
blind spot.

733
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,198
Boy pulled the lever,

734
00:51:38,268 --> 00:51:41,018
and 800 pounds of timber
rolled up Choat's leg,

735
00:51:41,084 --> 00:51:43,255
<i>broke 'em both
clean through.</i>

736
00:51:43,323 --> 00:51:46,521
Still getting paid
for that ten years
after the fact?

737
00:51:46,588 --> 00:51:48,922
Well, maybe he's decided
to fend for himself now.

738
00:51:48,989 --> 00:51:50,713
That's why he wants
to buy your farm

739
00:51:50,781 --> 00:51:52,275
and get it
running again.

740
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:53,909
I'd rather that place
go to pot than see

741
00:51:53,981 --> 00:51:55,836
Lonzo Choat
at the helm.

742
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:59,197
Well, who else you got
in mind to run that
place, Abner?

743
00:51:59,261 --> 00:52:00,537
I gotta run.

744
00:52:00,637 --> 00:52:02,612
Where are you off to?

745
00:52:02,716 --> 00:52:04,692
<i>Going to get
Choat locked up.</i>

746
00:52:48,382 --> 00:52:51,579
Hey, Dad.

747
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,779
Mr. Chessor told me
I might find you here.

748
00:52:54,848 --> 00:52:58,459
You, uh, you talking
to the Sheriff?

749
00:52:58,528 --> 00:53:01,014
That what you got
on that piece
of paper?

750
00:53:01,087 --> 00:53:03,030
Taking care of
some business.

751
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,324
Can I buy
you lunch?

752
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:10,775
<i>(Abner)
I was out there eight years
after your mama died, Paul.</i>

753
00:53:10,848 --> 00:53:13,085
Eight years.

754
00:53:13,153 --> 00:53:15,520
Sunup to sundown.

755
00:53:15,585 --> 00:53:18,073
<i>Winter, spring,
summer, and fall.</i>

756
00:53:18,145 --> 00:53:19,486
I worked the
land by myself.

757
00:53:19,553 --> 00:53:20,862
I was
plenty capable.

758
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:22,456
Yes, sir, you were.

759
00:53:22,561 --> 00:53:23,739
<i>And you
go and make
a big deal</i>

760
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,182
out of one
little episode.

761
00:53:25,281 --> 00:53:27,004
Well, it wasn't
the first episode,

762
00:53:27,072 --> 00:53:29,821
<i>and you
could've died
that night, Dad...</i>

763
00:53:29,889 --> 00:53:31,963
and nobody
would've known.

764
00:53:32,034 --> 00:53:34,619
<i>You come out here
to straighten out
this mess, I hope.</i>

765
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:37,111
I n a way, yes.

766
00:53:37,185 --> 00:53:39,160
I came out here
to pick you up

767
00:53:39,234 --> 00:53:41,241
and to drive you
back to Linden.

768
00:53:41,314 --> 00:53:44,184
Then you wasted gas
and a good deal of
your very valuable time.

769
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:45,599
Dad...

770
00:53:45,665 --> 00:53:47,192
Hell's gonna be
ass-deep in snow

771
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:49,021
before you guile me
into that place again.

772
00:53:49,122 --> 00:53:50,366
You fooled me, Paul.

773
00:53:50,433 --> 00:53:51,896
Dad, we talked
about this...

774
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:53,400
I get mad every time
I think about it.

775
00:53:53,475 --> 00:53:54,784
Dad, we talked
about this.

776
00:53:54,883 --> 00:53:56,606
And it's the
best solution.

777
00:53:56,675 --> 00:53:58,715
For who?

778
00:54:00,643 --> 00:54:03,807
Look, it's
just until I get
this straightened out.

779
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:07,736
Now, I've signed a
lease. It has to
run its course.

780
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:09,665
But the 90 days
are almost up.

781
00:54:09,731 --> 00:54:11,258
Now, let me
talk to Lonzo

782
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,502
and see if I can
get out of the sale,

783
00:54:13,571 --> 00:54:15,677
<i>and then you can
move back in.</i>

784
00:54:15,748 --> 00:54:18,082
<i>And if we... if
we need to get</i>

785
00:54:18,148 --> 00:54:20,963
a nurse for
you, well, then,
we'll get one.

786
00:54:21,028 --> 00:54:24,640
I would think
not being able to lie
convincingly to a jury

787
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:28,482
would be a considerable
handicap in your trade.

788
00:54:28,548 --> 00:54:30,937
You think
I don't know you?

789
00:54:31,012 --> 00:54:33,281
You think I can't see
through your skin

790
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:35,420
to every lie
you ever told?

791
00:54:35,492 --> 00:54:38,875
I know how
these deals
work, Paul.

792
00:54:38,949 --> 00:54:41,338
Your mother
loved that farm.

793
00:54:41,412 --> 00:54:43,005
<i>She loved you.</i>

794
00:54:43,076 --> 00:54:45,084
And I loved
her too, Dad.
And I always will.

795
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,618
<i>You want to throw
all that away</i>

796
00:54:46,693 --> 00:54:48,002
<i>for a little bit
of money?</i>

797
00:54:48,067 --> 00:54:49,409
I never taught you
to be greedy.

798
00:54:49,476 --> 00:54:50,884
You learned that
somewhere else.

799
00:54:50,948 --> 00:54:52,836
This is not
about greed.

800
00:54:52,933 --> 00:54:54,941
<i>There's nothing out
there for you
anymore, Dad.</i>

801
00:54:55,014 --> 00:54:56,639
Things change.

802
00:54:56,709 --> 00:54:58,531
Life goes on,

803
00:54:58,597 --> 00:55:00,485
and you gotta
go on with it.

804
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:02,304
<i>There ain't
any more to
it than that.</i>

805
00:55:02,406 --> 00:55:03,453
Life goes on, huh?

806
00:55:03,525 --> 00:55:05,019
For those who let it.

807
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,620
I'm an
80-year-old man

808
00:55:06,694 --> 00:55:08,450
with a bum hip
and a weak heart.

809
00:55:08,518 --> 00:55:11,103
How much life you
think I got left
to go on with?

810
00:55:11,173 --> 00:55:13,115
<i>I'm no fool, Paul.</i>

811
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:15,165
<i>The road ahead,
it ain't long
and it ain't winding.</i>

812
00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:18,850
It's short and straight
as a goddamn poisoned arrow.

813
00:55:18,919 --> 00:55:21,284
<i>But it's all I got,</i>

814
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:24,001
and I deserve to do
with it as I please.

815
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:26,689
And what makes me
so angry is that

816
00:55:26,759 --> 00:55:29,246
I cut and scraped
and did without...

817
00:55:29,318 --> 00:55:31,806
<i>so that you could go
to an expensive school</i>

818
00:55:31,878 --> 00:55:35,108
<i>and learn a trade
which you now seem
intent on using</i>

819
00:55:35,175 --> 00:55:37,280
to do me out of
what has taken me

820
00:55:37,351 --> 00:55:39,839
a lifetime
to accumulate!

821
00:55:39,911 --> 00:55:43,260
This must be
God's finest joke.

822
00:55:43,336 --> 00:55:46,532
So you're angry at
me for getting
an education.

823
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:48,639
I'm angry at you
for not caring

824
00:55:48,711 --> 00:55:50,849
about the
only thing left
that matters to me.

825
00:55:53,128 --> 00:55:54,470
And I don't
need a nurse.

826
00:55:54,536 --> 00:55:56,227
Yeah, well, you
need something,

827
00:55:56,296 --> 00:55:58,085
and it's not
gonna be cheap,

828
00:55:58,152 --> 00:56:00,388
and I'm the one who
has to pay for it.

829
00:56:00,456 --> 00:56:01,569
Then it is
about money.

830
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,200
It's about
you, Dad.

831
00:56:03,272 --> 00:56:05,661
It's about me
trying to help you.

832
00:56:05,736 --> 00:56:07,394
I don't need
your help.

833
00:56:07,496 --> 00:56:10,311
You know,
goddamn it, why
can't you just be easy?

834
00:56:10,376 --> 00:56:12,448
For once?

835
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,888
You know, I didn't
want this to
get ugly.

836
00:56:14,953 --> 00:56:16,808
Ugly? What are you
gonna do, Paul?

837
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:20,222
Drag me off by my ear
the way I done you
as a boy?

838
00:56:20,297 --> 00:56:21,824
I told you
I'd buy lunch.

839
00:56:21,897 --> 00:56:23,522
I don't want
your bribes.

840
00:56:23,593 --> 00:56:25,088
Jesus Christ.

841
00:56:25,161 --> 00:56:28,129
<i>Ah, now there's
someone, I bet...</i>

842
00:56:28,202 --> 00:56:31,649
who could solve
all this nonsense,
and quick.

843
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,729
Now, you straighten
out this Choat mess

844
00:56:33,802 --> 00:56:35,209
and you do it today.

845
00:56:35,274 --> 00:56:37,128
Otherwise, I don't
want to see you.

846
00:56:47,978 --> 00:56:50,149
<i>What the shit?</i>

847
00:57:09,579 --> 00:57:12,481
# Oh, she's long,
She's tall #

848
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:16,134
# She's six feet
From the ground #

849
00:57:16,204 --> 00:57:17,448

857
00:57:38,764 --> 00:57:40,325
What's going on?

858
00:57:40,397 --> 00:57:41,771
# She's telling me #

859
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:43,177
For what?

860
00:57:43,244 --> 00:57:45,612
# She ain't
No hand-me-down #

861
00:57:45,677 --> 00:57:46,789
<i>(Lonzo)
He shot at me.</i>

862
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:47,908
# Ooh #

863
00:57:48,013 --> 00:57:49,125
Bullshit.

864
00:57:49,197 --> 00:57:50,953
This is bullshit.

865
00:57:51,021 --> 00:57:54,884
<i># She's tailor-made #</i>

886
00:59:17,489 --> 00:59:19,050
He's trying,
you know.

887
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:23,596
Trying to kill
you, maybe.

888
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:27,015
Stop acting like
you know anything
about us.

889
00:59:27,088 --> 00:59:29,097
I know what
I've seen.

890
00:59:29,169 --> 00:59:31,536
I know I'd never treat
my wife like that.

891
00:59:31,602 --> 00:59:33,456
Y- you don't
know anything.

892
00:59:33,522 --> 00:59:35,048
I love Lonzo.

893
00:59:35,121 --> 00:59:36,878
You don't just run off
and leave somebody

894
00:59:36,946 --> 00:59:38,473
'cause they
got problems.

895
00:59:38,547 --> 00:59:40,140
So you stick around
till he finally

896
00:59:40,211 --> 00:59:41,804
lays you
out for good?

897
00:59:41,906 --> 00:59:44,012
Can't you see?
We finally got
a new start.

898
00:59:44,083 --> 00:59:45,992
We finally got
a chance to be

899
00:59:46,066 --> 00:59:47,976
something more than
we've ever been,

900
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:49,578
something better!

901
00:59:49,651 --> 00:59:51,756
Now, I-I
ain't making
excuses for him,

902
00:59:51,827 --> 00:59:54,794
but he ain't laid
a finger on us
in a long time.

903
00:59:54,867 --> 00:59:56,723
But even
one time
is too many.

904
00:59:56,788 --> 00:59:59,057
And then you show
up and all hell
breaks loose!

905
00:59:59,122 --> 01:00:01,130
What, you're saying
I'm to blame for this?

906
01:00:01,203 --> 01:00:03,211
I'm saying this ain't
a game, Mr. Meecham!

907
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:06,925
Now, we don't have
money laying around

908
01:00:07,028 --> 01:00:08,337
to go and
pay a bail man

909
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:10,259
just so you
can prove
a point.

910
01:00:10,324 --> 01:00:11,982
Well, I ain't got
time to waste

911
01:00:12,052 --> 01:00:14,059
waiting for folks
who never should've
been here

912
01:00:14,131 --> 01:00:18,639
in the first place
to move off my farm.

913
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,715
Well, I wish you had
something better

914
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:22,893
to do with your life
than sitting around

915
01:00:22,965 --> 01:00:24,971
being bitter
and lonely.

916
01:00:25,044 --> 01:00:28,972
Surely that
must grow old.

917
01:01:31,671 --> 01:01:33,843
<i>Oh, God.</i>

# I'll tell a story sad #

928
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:18,417
# How drinking rum
And the gambling hell #

929
01:03:18,493 --> 01:03:22,901

01:03:32,317 --> 01:03:36,659
# And now I know
She's watching #

933
01:03:36,732 --> 01:03:41,306
# A lonely orphan child #

934
01:03:52,254 --> 01:03:56,826
# We all were
Once so happy #

935
01:03:56,894 --> 01:04:01,532
# And had a happy home #

936
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:06,071
# Till Dad, he went
To drinking rum #

937
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:09,045
# And then
He gambled some #

938
01:04:10,431 --> 01:04:11,609
<i>Hello?</i>

939
01:04:11,709 --> 01:04:13,849
# He left my darling mother #

940
01:04:13,919 --> 01:04:15,228
Hello?

941
01:04:15,295 --> 01:04:18,590
# She died
Of a broken heart #

942
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:20,085
You Mr. Meecham?

943
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:23,226
That's me, owner
of this house.

944
01:04:23,296 --> 01:04:24,725
Owner of this farm.

945
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:26,425
Name's Hollis Pemberton.

946
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:27,870
I'm with the phone company.

947
01:04:27,935 --> 01:04:29,342
I got a work order here

948
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,334
says you need
some phone lines fixed.

949
01:04:30,432 --> 01:04:31,773
Yeah.

950
01:04:31,871 --> 01:04:33,115
You wanna show me
where they're at?

951
01:04:33,183 --> 01:04:34,165
Come on in.

952
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,418
All right, sir.

953
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:38,902
# My mother,
She is dead #

954
01:04:38,976 --> 01:04:40,799
# And I am just
An orphan child #

955
01:04:40,864 --> 01:04:42,174
Uh...

956
01:04:42,273 --> 01:04:43,068
Now, is... is that
Jimmie Rodgers?

957
01:04:43,137 --> 01:04:44,599
Yeah.

958
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:46,330
Man, I ain't
heard that
in forever.

959
01:04:46,401 --> 01:04:48,092
My grand-pappy
used to play that.

960
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,266
Called it, uh,
skirt-chasing music.

961
01:04:50,337 --> 01:04:51,766
Yeah.

962
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:53,149
Yeah, well,
it ain't no
Toby Keith,

963
01:04:53,217 --> 01:04:54,646
but I reckon you
could do worse.

964
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:55,997
This it here?

965
01:04:56,065 --> 01:04:57,494
Yeah, just...
just take a look

966
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,193
and tell me how much
it's gonna cost.

967
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:00,574
Yes, sir.
Will do.

968
01:05:00,673 --> 01:05:02,015
# Someday I'll
Find a welcome #

969
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:07,136
# On heaven's golden shore #

970
01:05:07,201 --> 01:05:12,090
# Don't weep for me
And Mother #

971
01:05:12,162 --> 01:05:16,896
# Although I know
It is sad #

972
01:05:16,961 --> 01:05:21,632
# But try to get
Someone to cheer #

973
01:05:21,698 --> 01:05:25,692
# And save
My poor lonely dad #

974
01:05:25,763 --> 01:05:30,651
# I'm awful cold
And hungry #

975
01:05:30,723 --> 01:05:34,498
# She closed her eyes
And sighed #

976
01:05:34,562 --> 01:05:35,740
That was quick.

977
01:05:35,842 --> 01:05:37,369
Well, your
wiring's fine.

978
01:05:37,474 --> 01:05:38,816
You just need to get
your service restored.

979
01:05:38,914 --> 01:05:39,896
I can do that
for you tomorrow.

980
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:41,432
Fine.

981
01:05:41,506 --> 01:05:42,881
Hey, where's the
other phone line at?

982
01:05:42,948 --> 01:05:44,093
Uh, it's in the
tenant house here.

983
01:05:44,195 --> 01:05:45,210
Come on,
I'll show you.

984
01:05:45,284 --> 01:05:46,429
All right, sir.

985
01:06:43,206 --> 01:06:45,540
<i>I just wanna
know one thing.</i>

986
01:06:45,638 --> 01:06:48,672
<i>(female voice on TV)
You never have to
know just one thing.</i>

987
01:06:48,743 --> 01:06:51,460
<i>You have to know it all,
and that's the matter
with you.</i>

988
01:06:51,527 --> 01:06:55,138
<i>I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

989
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:19,614
<i>All right, I'm coming.
I'm coming. Here.</i>

990
01:07:21,608 --> 01:07:23,233
All right, go on.

991
01:08:30,187 --> 01:08:31,780
Hi, little buddy.

992
01:08:31,851 --> 01:08:33,378
Hi, buddy.
Come here.

993
01:08:33,451 --> 01:08:35,840
Yeah, come on.

994
01:08:35,915 --> 01:08:37,224
<i>Come here,
little buddy.</i>

995
01:08:37,323 --> 01:08:38,600
<i>Come on.</i>

996
01:08:38,667 --> 01:08:40,522
<i>Come on.
There you go.</i>

997
01:08:40,587 --> 01:08:45,803
Yeah. Yeah.

998
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:19,557
Nipper?

999
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:25,862
Nipper!

1000
01:12:13,398 --> 01:12:16,049
<i>Hey, wanna come down here
and help me hang this?</i>

1001
01:12:38,134 --> 01:12:40,371
It's not you
he's angry at.

1002
01:12:40,438 --> 01:12:42,991
<i>He's angry
at that old man.</i>

1003
01:12:44,854 --> 01:12:47,539
He's angry
at himself.

1004
01:12:47,608 --> 01:12:49,844
<i>I'm tired
of it, Mama.</i>

1005
01:12:51,959 --> 01:12:53,453
I know.

1006
01:12:53,527 --> 01:12:55,120
It's gonna be better
now, though. It is.

1007
01:12:55,223 --> 01:12:57,973
<i>You don't think
he's coming back here?</i>

1008
01:12:58,039 --> 01:13:00,909
<i>Well, been gone
two days, so...</i>

1009
01:13:00,983 --> 01:13:02,510
I guess not.

1010
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:05,333
Maybe he finally
just got wise.

1011
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:07,636
<i>Maybe even
old hardheaded
bastards like him</i>

1012
01:13:07,704 --> 01:13:09,941
can learn a lesson
every now and then.

1013
01:13:10,008 --> 01:13:11,895
What'd you do, Lonzo?

1014
01:13:11,961 --> 01:13:13,717
<i>Stood my ground,
that's what I did,</i>

1015
01:13:13,784 --> 01:13:15,639
like I told
you I would.

1016
01:13:15,704 --> 01:13:19,086
Like a man ought to.

1017
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:22,990
<i>No, what'd
you do to him?</i>

1018
01:13:23,096 --> 01:13:25,168
I didn't
lay a finger
on that man.

1019
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:28,056
I just made things
a little clearer
to him.

1020
01:13:28,121 --> 01:13:30,456
<i>He understood that.</i>

1021
01:13:30,521 --> 01:13:31,895
He respected that.

1022
01:13:43,737 --> 01:13:45,712
Or maybe not.

1023
01:13:54,266 --> 01:13:56,600
<i>Ahh, that's
a good boy.</i>

1024
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:58,935
I'm gonna
take you out,
now, see?

1025
01:14:00,378 --> 01:14:04,917
Yeah. Come
on. Okay?

1026
01:14:04,986 --> 01:14:07,158
There you are, there.
You're okay.

1027
01:14:16,059 --> 01:14:17,171
Yeah.

1028
01:14:18,139 --> 01:14:19,513
There you go.

1029
01:14:19,579 --> 01:14:21,237
I want you to look
right up there

1030
01:14:21,307 --> 01:14:22,900
and keep an eye
on them for me.

1031
01:14:22,971 --> 01:14:24,018
Will you do that?

1032
01:14:24,091 --> 01:14:26,513
Okay. Okay.

1033
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:28,596
<i>Don't go down
there. Lonzol</i>

1034
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:31,482
He's lost his mind.
Can't you see that?

1035
01:14:31,547 --> 01:14:34,198
<i>You watch
these things.</i>

1036
01:14:34,268 --> 01:14:35,894
Keep watching
there, all right?

1037
01:14:41,564 --> 01:14:42,676
Come on.

1038
01:14:44,764 --> 01:14:46,138
<i>Fetch, nipper!</i>

1039
01:14:46,204 --> 01:14:48,114
<i>Fetch. Come on,
boy. Ha ha!</i>

1040
01:14:48,189 --> 01:14:49,563
Come on, come on.

1041
01:14:49,629 --> 01:14:51,255
Fetch, Nipper, fetch!

1042
01:14:53,309 --> 01:14:54,869
I wouldn't hold
my breath

1043
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:56,664
waiting on
him to bring
that stick back.

1044
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:00,984
Yeah, he's
a slow study.

1045
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:05,304
I believe he's
got some Choat

1046
01:15:05,373 --> 01:15:09,083
in his family
tree somewhere.

1047
01:15:09,182 --> 01:15:11,484
If I could buy you
for what you're worth

1048
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:14,136
and sell you for what
you think you're worth,

1049
01:15:14,206 --> 01:15:16,115
I'd retire.

1050
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:18,426
I thought
you had retired,

1051
01:15:18,493 --> 01:15:20,599
taking taxpayers'
hard-earned money

1052
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:23,484
so you can sit
on your lazy ass.

1053
01:15:24,605 --> 01:15:26,460
You're one to talk.

1054
01:15:26,525 --> 01:15:28,053
How much of your
social security

1055
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:30,298
did you waste on
that piece of shit?

1056
01:15:32,286 --> 01:15:34,839
I bet the little sum-bitch
is a light eater, though.

1057
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:36,765
He don't eat much,

1058
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:39,700
but he's one hell
of a watchdog.

1059
01:15:39,775 --> 01:15:42,141
Lays across my
feet all night,

1060
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:45,076
never shuts an eye.

1061
01:15:45,183 --> 01:15:47,572
One of these nights
the feller who
strung him up

1062
01:15:47,646 --> 01:15:49,982
is gonna come easing
through that door.

1063
01:15:50,048 --> 01:15:54,139
I'll make him a date
with the undertaker.

1064
01:15:54,208 --> 01:15:57,557
Sure is easy to talk
when you're old
as Adam.

1065
01:15:57,632 --> 01:15:59,803
I may be old,

1066
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:03,254
but I can whip the piss
out of any man I choose.

1067
01:16:03,328 --> 01:16:05,237
Come on.
Come on.

1068
01:16:05,312 --> 01:16:08,608
My God,
if you ain't
bat-shit crazy.

1069
01:16:08,672 --> 01:16:11,094
I worked too hard
and too long.

1070
01:16:11,169 --> 01:16:13,405
I ain't going down
without a fight!

1071
01:16:13,472 --> 01:16:15,065
You might go down
if the wind

1072
01:16:15,136 --> 01:16:16,762
blows you hard
enough, old man.

1073
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:18,458
You want this land?

1074
01:16:18,528 --> 01:16:20,089
You're gonna have
to take it!

1075
01:16:20,192 --> 01:16:22,778
Lt'll be the
easiest thing
I done all day.

1076
01:16:35,713 --> 01:16:36,924
You son of a bitch!

1077
01:16:36,994 --> 01:16:40,703
Give me
that fucking gun.

1078
01:16:40,769 --> 01:16:42,941
I'll light this place
like a stack of kindling

1079
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:44,024
and you with it.

1080
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:51,324
You crazy old man.

1081
01:17:41,892 --> 01:17:42,840
Dad.

1082
01:17:46,948 --> 01:17:49,468
I was wondering when
you'd show up again.

1083
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:52,541
Didn't know you were
bringing the law, too.

1084
01:17:52,613 --> 01:17:54,304
Well, I gave you
every opportunity

1085
01:17:54,373 --> 01:17:57,504
to leave
on your own.

1086
01:17:57,573 --> 01:18:01,250
You know where
I stand on that.

1087
01:18:01,349 --> 01:18:03,072
I called
Mr. Chessor's place

1088
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:05,029
all day yesterday
looking for you.

1089
01:18:05,093 --> 01:18:08,060
<i>I had
an errand to run
down Waynesboro.</i>

1090
01:18:08,133 --> 01:18:09,955
Took a little longer
than I expected,

1091
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:11,811
so I stayed the night.

1092
01:18:19,398 --> 01:18:21,089
This is out
of control, Dad.

1093
01:18:27,974 --> 01:18:30,844
I never was one
to let things slide.

1094
01:18:30,919 --> 01:18:33,985
No, sir, you
never were that.

1095
01:18:34,055 --> 01:18:36,062
I don't
suppose you plan
to do anything

1096
01:18:36,135 --> 01:18:38,524
about Choat's
disability scam.

1097
01:18:38,599 --> 01:18:40,290
What disability scam?

1098
01:18:40,359 --> 01:18:43,010
What business
is that of
yours, anyway?

1099
01:18:43,079 --> 01:18:45,348
I pay taxes,
don't I?

1100
01:18:45,415 --> 01:18:47,586
You're reaching, Dad.

1101
01:18:47,655 --> 01:18:49,827
That's a
little pathetic
even for you.

1102
01:18:52,072 --> 01:18:54,625
You're a danger
to people, Dad.

1103
01:18:54,697 --> 01:18:56,551
Like hell.

1104
01:18:56,617 --> 01:18:58,755
Shooting a
pistol at a man?

1105
01:18:58,824 --> 01:19:00,996
Having him arrested
so that his family

1106
01:19:01,065 --> 01:19:03,431
<i>has to go and bail
him out with money
that they don't have?</i>

1107
01:19:03,496 --> 01:19:04,837
What do you
call that, Dad?

1108
01:19:04,905 --> 01:19:06,814
And this...

1109
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,157
<i>I- I don't even
want to know what
this is about.</i>

1110
01:19:09,224 --> 01:19:11,745
For God's sakes,
Dad, you need help.

1111
01:19:11,817 --> 01:19:14,152
I can't say
I didn't do it,

1112
01:19:14,217 --> 01:19:17,250
but you got the
wrong slant on
it, Paul,

1113
01:19:17,321 --> 01:19:20,071
always saying things
from the wrong angle.

1114
01:19:20,137 --> 01:19:23,966
Now, I ain't... I ain't
gonna argue with you.

1115
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:27,587
Arguing with you always
was a waste of time.

1116
01:19:27,657 --> 01:19:30,308
You just...

1117
01:19:30,377 --> 01:19:32,549
you just lie
your way out of it.

1118
01:19:32,618 --> 01:19:37,255
You're a mean son
of a bitch, you
know that?

1119
01:19:37,322 --> 01:19:40,934
You were
mean to her.

1120
01:19:41,034 --> 01:19:44,546
You were
mean to me.

1121
01:19:44,618 --> 01:19:46,658
I just want
my farm back, Paul.

1122
01:19:56,715 --> 01:19:59,082
He said if your dad
is gone by morning,

1123
01:19:59,147 --> 01:20:02,791
he's willing to
let things lie.

1124
01:20:02,859 --> 01:20:04,615
Well, what's it
gonna be, Dad?

1125
01:20:08,843 --> 01:20:10,272
<i>Just give
me a second.</i>

1126
01:20:17,515 --> 01:20:20,363
You need any help
packing your stuff up?

1127
01:20:21,355 --> 01:20:23,210
No.

1128
01:20:23,275 --> 01:20:27,498
<i>There are a few things...
I'd like to keep, though,</i>

1129
01:20:27,564 --> 01:20:30,379
<i>Take back with me
to the home.</i>

1130
01:20:30,444 --> 01:20:33,347
<i>Your mama's things.</i>

1131
01:20:33,421 --> 01:20:35,177
I'll go through
it all tonight,

1132
01:20:35,245 --> 01:20:38,212
get it all packed up.

1133
01:20:38,284 --> 01:20:41,099
I can drive myself back.

1134
01:20:41,164 --> 01:20:44,776
Okay.

1135
01:20:44,877 --> 01:20:46,949
Okay, but I want you to
get on the road, okay?

1136
01:20:47,021 --> 01:20:48,876
I don't want you
driving after dark.

1137
01:21:18,062 --> 01:21:21,837
<i>(Abner)
You don't think he'd
burn a man out, do you?</i>

1138
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:24,363
<i>(Thurl)
Lonzo?</i>

1139
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:26,219
<i>No, I don't
think so.</i>

1140
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:27,977
<i>I've never
known him
to do anybody</i>

1141
01:21:28,047 --> 01:21:31,495
any real harm.
There you go.

1142
01:21:31,567 --> 01:21:33,161
Of course, he'd
steal anything

1143
01:21:33,232 --> 01:21:35,239
that wasn't
tied down
or on fire,

1144
01:21:35,312 --> 01:21:37,581
but, uh, he's a
trifling bit lazy.

1145
01:21:37,648 --> 01:21:40,136
He won't do nothing
if it makes any effort.

1146
01:21:40,208 --> 01:21:42,062
You wouldn't have
called him lazy

1147
01:21:42,128 --> 01:21:46,056
if you'd seen him
beating those girls
with a rubber hose.

1148
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:50,316
Anyway, he said he
was gonna burn
me out,

1149
01:21:50,384 --> 01:21:52,391
and I believe
he'll try it.

1150
01:21:52,463 --> 01:21:54,603
You ought to get
the law on it, Abner.

1151
01:21:54,673 --> 01:21:56,047
Call the high sheriff.

1152
01:21:56,112 --> 01:21:58,054
He wouldn't believe me.

1153
01:21:58,128 --> 01:22:03,114
Paul's convinced
him I'm crazy.

1154
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:06,152
All I want
you to do...

1155
01:22:06,225 --> 01:22:09,192
is to speak up
if anything does happen.

1156
01:22:09,265 --> 01:22:10,955
You tell the law

1157
01:22:11,024 --> 01:22:12,879
that I told you
ahead of time

1158
01:22:12,944 --> 01:22:17,102
that he threatened
to do it.

1159
01:22:17,202 --> 01:22:19,024
Would you do that?

1160
01:22:19,089 --> 01:22:23,180
I'll do that.

1161
01:22:23,281 --> 01:22:26,380
Wouldn't want him
to get clean away
with it.

1162
01:22:27,889 --> 01:22:29,383
No, we wouldn't
want that.

1163
01:23:03,284 --> 01:23:08,237
Last time I
saw her alive
was on a Saturday.

1164
01:23:08,307 --> 01:23:10,282
We were
getting ready
to go into town

1165
01:23:10,356 --> 01:23:12,243
for a cattle sale.

1166
01:23:12,307 --> 01:23:15,178
<i>I was in a hurry, but
she kept dragging around,</i>

1167
01:23:15,252 --> 01:23:17,674
<i>dragging around.</i>

1168
01:23:17,749 --> 01:23:21,262
<i>This dress,
that dress.</i>

1169
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:23,602
<i>Something, and I can't...</i>

1170
01:23:23,668 --> 01:23:26,537
<i>"I don't know
which one to wear. "</i>

1171
01:23:26,612 --> 01:23:29,514
Always frustrated me
when she did that.

1172
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:35,754
I... I never had
very much patience.

1173
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:38,218
I said, "You best be
for wearing one
of them.

1174
01:23:38,293 --> 01:23:40,562
I don't care which."

1175
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:44,786
<i>I said, "I'm going
out to the truck...</i>

1176
01:23:44,885 --> 01:23:47,918
<i>"and if you ain't there
in five minutes, I'm gone.</i>

1177
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:49,964
<i>"Then you have the
rest of the afternoon</i>

1178
01:23:50,038 --> 01:23:53,354
<i>to make up your mind. "</i>

1179
01:23:53,429 --> 01:23:56,725
I had said such things
a thousand times.

1180
01:23:56,790 --> 01:24:00,882
I got in the truck and...

1181
01:24:00,951 --> 01:24:03,601
and I-I laid this...

1182
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:06,867
pocket watch on
the passenger seat.

1183
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:14,319
<i>When the
five minutes was up,
I cranked the truck.</i>

1184
01:24:14,391 --> 01:24:17,042
<i>I looked back
at the house,</i>

1185
01:24:17,111 --> 01:24:19,413
<i>and I saw her hand</i>

1186
01:24:19,479 --> 01:24:23,189
<i>pull aside the
kitchen curtain.</i>

1187
01:24:26,007 --> 01:24:28,593
She pressed her face
against the glass...

1188
01:24:31,735 --> 01:24:33,328
and I drove away.

1189
01:24:38,648 --> 01:24:40,208
<i>When I come back,</i>

1190
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,385
<i>she was laying on
the kitchen floor.</i>

1191
01:24:42,456 --> 01:24:44,725
<i>Her eyes
were wide open,</i>

1192
01:24:44,792 --> 01:24:46,799
<i>staring at the linoleum</i>

1193
01:24:46,872 --> 01:24:52,786
<i>like there was some
secret message...</i>

1194
01:24:52,888 --> 01:24:55,125
encoded in a tile.

1195
01:25:16,474 --> 01:25:19,191
Keep a
good lookout
for me, friend.

1196
01:26:05,051 --> 01:26:06,164
Argh!

1197
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:12,150
What you doing?

1198
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:15,122
What? Damn!

1199
01:26:15,196 --> 01:26:16,626
Girl, you...

1200
01:26:16,701 --> 01:26:20,149
<i>you got some
bad timing.</i>

1201
01:26:20,253 --> 01:26:21,846
Sorry.

1202
01:26:21,917 --> 01:26:23,739
<i>What are
you doing
with the bag?</i>

1203
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:27,666
Leavin'.

1204
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:29,267
Leavin' what?

1205
01:26:29,341 --> 01:26:32,570
Here.

1206
01:26:32,637 --> 01:26:34,459
Him.

1207
01:26:34,525 --> 01:26:36,313
You stealing
his truck?

1208
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:39,131
Taking that
old Cutlass.

1209
01:26:39,198 --> 01:26:43,289
Mama gave me the keys.

1210
01:26:43,357 --> 01:26:45,332
Hurt you
pretty good, huh?

1211
01:26:50,558 --> 01:26:56,090
It ain't your fault
your dad is a
drunk, Pamela.

1212
01:26:56,158 --> 01:26:59,737
That's the first time
you ever called me
by my name.

1213
01:27:01,663 --> 01:27:03,124
<i>I'll be all right.</i>

1214
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:06,614
My aunt lives
over in Centerville.

1215
01:27:06,687 --> 01:27:08,410
Mama's sister.

1216
01:27:08,478 --> 01:27:10,966
I'll stay
there a while.

1217
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:14,487
I can't blame you
for wanting out.

1218
01:27:14,559 --> 01:27:19,131
But if you stayed here,
he really would be
nicer to us.

1219
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,858
He'd have to be!

1220
01:27:20,928 --> 01:27:22,389
I'm sure we
can work it out.

1221
01:27:22,463 --> 01:27:23,990
You can keep on
living out here.

1222
01:27:24,064 --> 01:27:25,209
No.

1223
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:26,938
I'll help you
fix it up.

1224
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:28,470
No, no. No. That...
that's out of
the question.

1225
01:27:28,575 --> 01:27:29,819
Please, Mr. Meecham...

1226
01:27:29,888 --> 01:27:31,317
No, now, Pamela,
I just need

1227
01:27:31,423 --> 01:27:33,016
for you to get on
the road now, Pamela.

1228
01:27:33,087 --> 01:27:34,396
<i>Get in that car...</i>

1229
01:27:34,464 --> 01:27:35,773
What's going
on, Mr. Meecham?

1230
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,182
Get in the car.
Get on the road.

1231
01:27:37,248 --> 01:27:38,710
I don't really feel
like it yet.

1232
01:27:38,784 --> 01:27:40,857
<i>Just gol Gol Get I</i>

1233
01:27:40,929 --> 01:27:42,303
I've tried
to tell you.

1234
01:27:42,369 --> 01:27:44,540
Just go on, Pamela.

1235
01:27:44,608 --> 01:27:45,753
<i>Go on I</i>

1236
01:30:47,849 --> 01:30:50,883
<i>Nol Oh I</i>

1237
01:34:09,874 --> 01:34:12,656
That nurse
lady's hands
were so cold...

1238
01:34:12,722 --> 01:34:17,229
she nearly gave me a seizure
when she pulled on my stuff,

1239
01:34:17,299 --> 01:34:18,826
when she cleaned me.

1240
01:34:18,897 --> 01:34:21,287
<i>But I'd be lying if I said</i>

1241
01:34:21,361 --> 01:34:23,534
<i>I didn't like it
just a little.</i>

1242
01:34:25,524 --> 01:34:28,338
Well, look at that.

1243
01:34:28,404 --> 01:34:31,600
He laughs.

1244
01:34:36,563 --> 01:34:37,676
Here, Dad.

1245
01:34:37,747 --> 01:34:39,308
Right there, that's...

1246
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:42,249
one of the real
tender spots.

1247
01:34:42,323 --> 01:34:43,786
You just take
it easy, Dad.

1248
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:45,453
You got a ways
to go yet.

1249
01:34:45,524 --> 01:34:47,859
I could leave to...

1250
01:34:47,924 --> 01:34:49,712
- Morrow.

1251
01:34:51,701 --> 01:34:53,708
Look, you just do
what the doc says.

1252
01:34:53,781 --> 01:34:57,458
She knows
what's best.

1253
01:34:57,556 --> 01:34:58,833
But you...

1254
01:34:58,899 --> 01:35:00,907
you do look
better, though.

1255
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:03,053
Better... better
than you did.

1256
01:35:06,358 --> 01:35:08,594
What the...

1257
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:11,956
what of the house?

1258
01:35:12,022 --> 01:35:14,193
I guess...

1259
01:35:14,261 --> 01:35:17,294
Choats are
all settled
in there now.

1260
01:35:19,285 --> 01:35:21,773
Dad, we don't have to talk
about that right now.

1261
01:35:21,845 --> 01:35:23,701
We got time.

1262
01:35:23,766 --> 01:35:26,635
All right.

1263
01:35:38,006 --> 01:35:40,875
I see your
mother sometimes...

1264
01:35:42,486 --> 01:35:44,079
in dreams.

1265
01:35:46,711 --> 01:35:50,639
Oh. Well, what does...

1266
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:52,980
what does...
what does she say?

1267
01:35:56,087 --> 01:35:58,159
She listens mostly.

1268
01:36:04,504 --> 01:36:07,538
She is so forgiving.

1269
01:36:19,064 --> 01:36:20,657
Um, well,
Dad, I've, uh...

1270
01:36:20,728 --> 01:36:22,484
I've gotta
get on the road.

1271
01:36:22,552 --> 01:36:24,975
I've got a, uh,
I've got a big meeting

1272
01:36:25,049 --> 01:36:27,121
<i>I gotta get
to this morning,</i>

1273
01:36:27,193 --> 01:36:29,560
<i>but, uh, I'll be back
tomorrow to check in
on you, okay?</i>

1274
01:36:33,145 --> 01:36:35,862
Um, Dad, l... l...
found a place.

1275
01:36:36,921 --> 01:36:38,415
It's, um...

1276
01:36:38,489 --> 01:36:40,878
it's a retirement community.

1277
01:36:40,953 --> 01:36:42,448
And, uh, you would...

1278
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:44,560
<i>you'd have
your own apartment...</i>

1279
01:36:44,634 --> 01:36:49,141
<i>and... and... and
your own backyard.</i>

1280
01:36:49,210 --> 01:36:51,216
You know, l... I
thought maybe...

1281
01:36:51,290 --> 01:36:57,137
maybe you could
grow some tomatoes.

1282
01:36:57,210 --> 01:37:00,025
It's only 20 minutes away
from where I live.

1283
01:37:05,562 --> 01:37:07,449
I'd prefer
to grow corn.

1284
01:37:10,907 --> 01:37:12,817
Corn.

1285
01:37:12,923 --> 01:37:14,898
Sure, Dad.

1286
01:37:14,971 --> 01:37:18,997
I'll, um...
I'll see you
tomorrow, okay?
