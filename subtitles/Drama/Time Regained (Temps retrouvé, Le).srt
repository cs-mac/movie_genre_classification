1
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:46,054
THE CORRIDORS OF TIME

2
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:53,934
In the year 1123, men were valiant.

3
00:00:54,174 --> 00:00:56,854
wizards ruled over the forests

4
00:00:57,094 --> 00:01:01,014
with magic spells, potions and remedies.

5
00:01:01,254 --> 00:01:04,654
Godefroy, Count of Montmirail,
returned from war

6
00:01:04,894 --> 00:01:07,374
with his squire, Jacquasse the Crass.

7
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:11,134
He rushed to his betrothed,
sweet Frenegonde.

8
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:15,214
Bewitched by a wicked witch,

9
00:01:15,454 --> 00:01:18,854
he mistook Frenegonde's father
for a bear

10
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:21,214
and slew him with an arrow.

11
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:27,494
Deserted by Frenegonde,
Godefroy consulted the wizard Eusabius,

12
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:31,054
who tried sending Godefroy
through the Corridors of Time

13
00:01:31,294 --> 00:01:33,534
to the moment before the accident.

14
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:35,934
But the wizard goofed.

15
00:01:36,174 --> 00:01:39,454
He thrust our heroes
into the 20th century.

16
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,334
The psychos!

17
00:01:42,574 --> 00:01:44,094
Look at the bums!

18
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:48,094
Godefroy met his descendant,
Beatrice de Montmirail.

19
00:01:48,334 --> 00:01:51,174
she mistook him
for her cousin Hubert,

20
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:53,494
who has the ancestral nose.

21
00:01:53,774 --> 00:01:56,174
But Jacquart, Jacquasse' descendant,

22
00:01:56,414 --> 00:01:58,654
denied any link with such an oaf.

23
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:01,654
Jacquasse and Godefroy met Ginette,

24
00:02:01,894 --> 00:02:04,534
a hobo who mistook them for stuntmen.

25
00:02:05,414 --> 00:02:09,894
But Beatrice wrongly assumed
that Ginette also came

26
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:11,814
from the Middle Ages.

27
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:15,334
Before Godefroy returned to the past,

28
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:19,534
he locked up sergeant Gibbon
and sedated him.

29
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:25,134
He managed to prevent
his future father-in-law's death.

30
00:02:26,654 --> 00:02:28,694
But Jacquasse did something dumb.

31
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:30,974
He stole the Duke'sjewels

32
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:34,294
and hid them in a statue.

33
00:02:34,694 --> 00:02:36,894
By taking them into the future,

34
00:02:37,134 --> 00:02:40,694
and sending Jacquart back to the past

35
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:45,094
in the coat Ginette had bought for him,

36
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:48,414
Jacquasse the Crass has left

37
00:02:48,654 --> 00:02:51,854
the Corridors of Time wide open.

38
00:02:55,014 --> 00:02:56,374
Out of my way!

39
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:07,134
Cousin Hubert!
what's going on here?

40
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:12,014
where the hell am I?

41
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:19,454
sire! The Crass obeys you not.
He flees!

42
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:25,214
Let me drag him back
by his ball-sack.

43
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:27,974
He is thrilled to be home.

44
00:03:28,214 --> 00:03:30,014
Let him drink the tavern dry.

45
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:32,014
He'll return soon after.

46
00:03:46,054 --> 00:03:48,734
No network! what a great buy!

47
00:03:50,654 --> 00:03:53,854
It's ice-cold here!

48
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:24,974
Daughter,
you will not wed Count Godefroy.

49
00:04:25,494 --> 00:04:27,534
His subjects are thieves.

50
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:29,094
Jewel thieves!

51
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,134
How can it be?

52
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:33,054
I had them this morning.

53
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:35,934
Now they're gone, as if by magic!

54
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:38,334
A spell was cast on me!

55
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:43,254
Relax thyself. I will investigate.
If thief there be, he will hang!

56
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:47,334
Among the stolen family jewels
is our Holy Relic.

57
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:48,974
The sacred tooth!

58
00:04:49,574 --> 00:04:53,614
All that remained of saint Rolande
after Caesar's lions devoured her.

59
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:55,254
It brings fertility!

60
00:04:55,814 --> 00:04:57,214
woe to my daughter

61
00:04:57,494 --> 00:04:59,894
if she is without it at her wedding!

62
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,654
she will be sterile!

63
00:05:03,614 --> 00:05:08,334
I vow to find the sacred tooth,
even if Hell awaits me!

64
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:10,454
My faith is in thee!

65
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:11,494
Loyal lady!

66
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:14,254
Find the relic before the new moon

67
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:16,654
or it will be paid for
in blood!

68
00:05:17,454 --> 00:05:20,894
Damned this icy land of yours!
August approaches,

69
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:22,414
and we freeze!

70
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:28,174
what ails thee?

71
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:29,694
Sire!

72
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:35,174
why are you here, Eusabius?

73
00:05:35,414 --> 00:05:37,134
You're back safe and sound?

74
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:38,414
Indeed.

75
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:41,734
Your squire too?
All is back to normal?

76
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:45,334
while he drinks,
someone swiped the Duke's jewels.

77
00:05:45,694 --> 00:05:47,254
My crystal balls are cloudy.

78
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:50,174
My potions boil over! I'm scared!

79
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:53,574
Go now.
I will call you when I need you.

80
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:57,494
It is as if the Corridors of Time
were still open!

81
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:14,334
Strange dogs!

82
00:06:14,854 --> 00:06:16,254
Nice doggies...

83
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:20,334
They look like wolves.

84
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:24,134
I don't believe it!
They are wolves!

85
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:26,134
wolves in the woods!

86
00:06:52,574 --> 00:06:53,574
Unbelievable!

87
00:06:58,054 --> 00:07:00,494
Hello, sir. Call the police!

88
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:03,854
Circus animals
are running loose in the woods!

89
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:04,814
It's horrific!

90
00:07:05,054 --> 00:07:06,534
Look at me, man!

91
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:10,534
what bad breath!
It's like a septic tank!

92
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:13,134
He looks like Jacquasse the Crass!

93
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:14,974
He's far too dainty!

94
00:07:15,214 --> 00:07:18,174
Maybe he seduced
a foreign princess!

95
00:07:20,414 --> 00:07:22,254
He's handsomely dressed

96
00:07:23,014 --> 00:07:24,334
and so cute!

97
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:25,814
You're crazy!

98
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:28,934
Get your hairy hands off me,
ass breath!

99
00:07:29,894 --> 00:07:32,614
Holy scrotum! Catch him!

100
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:34,614
Out of my way!

101
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:48,014
stop him!

102
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:50,494
If he flees,
he must be guilty!

103
00:07:52,134 --> 00:07:54,334
That hurts! Let go!

104
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,334
Hands off!

105
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:57,614
Grand Inquisitor, look!

106
00:07:57,854 --> 00:07:58,974
Monks?

107
00:08:02,334 --> 00:08:05,214
Hey! Grand Guru! Head Honcho!

108
00:08:05,454 --> 00:08:08,014
Let me go
and I'll keep quiet.

109
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,494
Just call me a taxi.

110
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:12,014
Confess and die in peace.

111
00:08:12,614 --> 00:08:15,694
Look! A little catapult!

112
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:23,254
stand back!

113
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:25,014
It's not mine!

114
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,774
I was drugged
and put in these stupid clothes!

115
00:08:34,174 --> 00:08:36,374
The stake!
Fire will purge him!

116
00:08:36,614 --> 00:08:39,294
It's a toy! It's Jacquasse's!

117
00:08:40,374 --> 00:08:41,734
Burn him!

118
00:08:44,494 --> 00:08:48,854
It's a cow moo!
what do you have against cows?

119
00:08:49,534 --> 00:08:50,814
Hurry, my love!

120
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:56,334
My father has boils.
He vomiteth pus.

121
00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:01,334
The Relic!

122
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:04,294
Have you found the Relic

123
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:06,774
of saint Rolande?

124
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:20,214
He is possessed.
we need an exorcist!

125
00:09:24,054 --> 00:09:28,934
we found Jacquasse!
The Inquisitor wants to burn him!

126
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:29,934
My Jacquasse?

127
00:09:30,174 --> 00:09:31,614
what's this scuzz?

128
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:35,454
Hey there, Big Cheese!

129
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:38,294
Let me join your sect
and send you

130
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,214
a big fat check!

131
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:45,094
Abandon satan and die forgiven.

132
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,014
Do you speak French?

133
00:09:47,574 --> 00:09:49,494
won't you take my check?

134
00:09:51,894 --> 00:09:53,734
Put that tuna down, okay?

135
00:09:53,974 --> 00:09:55,214
Okayyy!

136
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:58,854
No touching the fish!

137
00:09:59,094 --> 00:10:00,574
wondrous codpieces!

138
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:03,654
Our salesgirls
are happy to serve you.

139
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:05,414
Mighty meats!

140
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:08,134
- Keep your cod!
- so get out!

141
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,134
Okay?

142
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:12,974
Lady Ginette!

143
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:15,894
Juicy beans
and big fat sausage!

144
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:18,894
It's locked inside! Thievery!

145
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:21,054
stop shaking the bean stew!

146
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:22,414
Give it to me!

147
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:25,094
You'll break it!

148
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:30,014
My shoes!

149
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:32,814
Eat this!

150
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:44,374
- what's that?
- To make bread!

151
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:47,654
Good riddance!
we don't want your kind here!

152
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:49,614
Bums!

153
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:53,294
These hurt!

154
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:56,814
- Open your window!
- I prefer my bootlets!

155
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:57,774
It's vile!

156
00:10:58,014 --> 00:11:00,214
- I smell nothing.
- It reeks!

157
00:11:00,454 --> 00:11:02,374
They reek not!

158
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:07,294
Long live the Count!

159
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,654
You're making a big boo-boo!

160
00:11:09,894 --> 00:11:11,774
It's warming up!

161
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:13,974
There's Cousin Hubert!

162
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:16,814
I am the Count.

163
00:11:17,214 --> 00:11:19,374
How dare you burn him on my land?

164
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:22,854
The life and death
of my serfs is my affair.

165
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:25,174
Destroying satan is mine.

166
00:11:27,574 --> 00:11:29,814
He is my loyal servant, Jacquasse.

167
00:11:30,094 --> 00:11:34,134
Explain the satanic noise
this box makes.

168
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:38,014
Yes? I'm waiting.

169
00:11:38,854 --> 00:11:40,094
I'm getting hot!

170
00:11:40,454 --> 00:11:42,134
I've had enough!

171
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:45,854
If he sinned, he will be punished.

172
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:48,654
But I'll attend the trial. Obey the law.

173
00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:51,294
we'll interrogate him in your castle.

174
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:53,294
It won't take long.

175
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:55,014
I dislike your manners.

176
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:56,574
And I, yours.

177
00:11:56,814 --> 00:11:59,134
while you yak away, I'm burning!

178
00:12:03,894 --> 00:12:05,494
About time!

179
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:08,694
what is this madhouse?
who are these crazies?

180
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:11,294
Holy scrotums!
Jacquasse's descendant!

181
00:12:11,894 --> 00:12:13,934
I'm not his descendant at all!

182
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:17,734
Take me to the hotel.
I'm calling the police chief!

183
00:12:17,974 --> 00:12:19,814
Believe me, heads will roll!

184
00:12:20,054 --> 00:12:21,614
Keep quiet, peasant,

185
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:23,654
or you will die.

186
00:12:24,054 --> 00:12:27,134
I want him in irons and shackles.

187
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,734
I agree! Gag him too!

188
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:31,494
what the hell?

189
00:12:37,654 --> 00:12:39,254
Honey for my gullet!

190
00:12:39,494 --> 00:12:41,414
It's chocolate, not honey!

191
00:12:41,814 --> 00:12:45,494
10 Crunch Bars in 5 minutes!
You'll be sick as a dog!

192
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:49,334
Crunch! Chocolate!
Long live chocolate!

193
00:12:49,614 --> 00:12:50,694
Let me steer!

194
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:52,654
Got a license?

195
00:12:52,894 --> 00:12:54,014
Here, drive.

196
00:12:54,254 --> 00:12:57,254
Careful, dummy,
or we'll bite the dust!

197
00:12:58,534 --> 00:13:01,174
You're zigzagging, buddy!

198
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:03,414
Keep cool, baby.

199
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:04,854
Cool!

200
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:06,974
You're a real ace!

201
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:08,494
My turn now.

202
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:10,374
Ace charioteer!

203
00:13:15,014 --> 00:13:16,694
Learn to drive, asshole!

204
00:13:21,094 --> 00:13:25,254
vile beggar! slug-eating rascal!
Away with you!

205
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:28,774
You sound dumb!
Kinda like a medieval knight!

206
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:31,494
what means "medieval"?

207
00:13:31,974 --> 00:13:33,054
You don't know?

208
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:36,534
Culture-wise, you're a real dick!

209
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:38,774
what befalls?

210
00:13:40,614 --> 00:13:42,614
Oh shit!

211
00:13:43,174 --> 00:13:46,014
This shit heap guzzles gas!

212
00:13:46,694 --> 00:13:48,414
shit heap!

213
00:13:48,654 --> 00:13:51,654
we'll pawn your jewels
and buy another.

214
00:13:51,894 --> 00:13:54,654
No, I'll bury my jewels
at Lady Beatrice's

215
00:13:54,894 --> 00:13:56,854
and save them for my bastards.

216
00:13:57,094 --> 00:14:00,014
Let's blow it all!
That's what money's for!

217
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:02,854
Let's tan our toes in saint Tropez!

218
00:14:03,854 --> 00:14:08,094
No, we'll return to our Good Mistress.
we'll toil away for her.

219
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:10,734
In turn,
she will pay and protect us.

220
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:13,654
Lady Beatrice is mean.
she's a bimbo.

221
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:15,734
A bimbo? Yes, yes...

222
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:17,294
Yeah, a bimbo!

223
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:21,174
Let's go see
Lady Beatrice the Bimbo.

224
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,134
Jean-Pierre, you're exhausting me!

225
00:14:28,374 --> 00:14:31,694
I expected more from you
than stupid skepticism.

226
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:34,974
I'm not the only skeptical one,
right doctor?

227
00:14:35,214 --> 00:14:39,054
Godefroy, Mr. Kass and Dame Ginette
are from the Middle Ages.

228
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:40,854
I know you can be thick,

229
00:14:41,094 --> 00:14:44,454
but think in terms of
the Tv show "The X-Files",

230
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:46,934
which you hate and the kids love.

231
00:14:48,894 --> 00:14:52,014
Sir, Madame de Montmirail
is calling you back.

232
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:53,374
You told Mummy?

233
00:14:53,614 --> 00:14:55,534
No, it's Cora. Hubert's wife.

234
00:14:55,774 --> 00:14:57,254
I told her he's back!

235
00:14:57,854 --> 00:14:59,814
That was a big mistake.

236
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,734
Cora? Jean-Pierre here.

237
00:15:02,974 --> 00:15:04,014
How dumb! Hang up!

238
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:07,414
Your husband has turned up.
Here.

239
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,374
How irresponsible!

240
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:13,974
I kept quiet
when I thought Godefroy was Hubert

241
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:18,174
because even before he went to Borneo,
he hated her.

242
00:15:18,414 --> 00:15:20,414
She's your problem now.

243
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:21,934
Relax! You're tired.

244
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,534
Take your drops
and I'll have Pizza Hut deliver.

245
00:15:26,974 --> 00:15:28,014
A trumpet?

246
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:34,414
why work for these asses?

247
00:15:35,494 --> 00:15:36,694
Hi, Mr. Goulard.

248
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:37,654
what now?

249
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:39,574
Sustenance and shelter!

250
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,694
Let us toil
for Lady Beatrice the Bimbo

251
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:44,414
for food and lodging.

252
00:15:44,654 --> 00:15:46,454
- what?
- I won't bust my buns!

253
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:48,414
Beatrice is sick.

254
00:15:49,454 --> 00:15:51,614
That asshole hurt you!

255
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:54,694
Jean-Pierre, you're awful!

256
00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:58,534
Jacques Kass is a friend
and you kick him out!

257
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:00,374
Come in, Mr. Kass.

258
00:16:01,014 --> 00:16:02,614
Not with their rubbish!

259
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:07,334
Off'rings for my mistress,
Beatrice the Bimbo.

260
00:16:07,574 --> 00:16:08,334
what?

261
00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:11,174
"Off'rings"
is the word from back then.

262
00:16:11,414 --> 00:16:14,774
It means "gifts".
A thousand thanks, dear servant.

263
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:17,254
Enter with your damsel.

264
00:16:17,494 --> 00:16:19,134
He called you a bimbo.

265
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:21,814
For them
the meaning is different.

266
00:16:22,054 --> 00:16:23,494
Not for me!

267
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,974
Bring your goodly victuals
into the kitchen.

268
00:16:27,214 --> 00:16:29,774
Hastily,
Lady Beatrice the Bimbo!

269
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:33,654
She loves this bimbo stuff.
Help us.

270
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:36,974
what a nice surprise!

271
00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:37,934
You forgot?

272
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:40,694
Not at all.
Go in. I'll join you.

273
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:45,214
Beatrice! I'm repairing a bridge.
Call me if the Kasses

274
00:16:45,454 --> 00:16:46,654
make any trouble.

275
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:49,454
Gentle servant,
we have a grave problem.

276
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:52,534
Mr. Jacquart
went back to your times.

277
00:16:53,094 --> 00:16:54,814
- Understand?
- Yes!

278
00:16:55,054 --> 00:16:56,894
we can't leave him there.

279
00:16:57,774 --> 00:16:58,934
Yes!

280
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:00,894
Let's solve this now.

281
00:17:01,974 --> 00:17:04,534
Too new a word. solveth?

282
00:17:08,614 --> 00:17:11,094
You understand?
Let's solveth this.

283
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,334
'Tis an honor for him to serve

284
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,414
as sire Godefroy's squire.

285
00:17:15,654 --> 00:17:17,374
Mr. Kass, Jacquart cannot

286
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:19,494
be a squire. He's too...

287
00:17:19,854 --> 00:17:22,614
sophisticated.
He'll hate the climate.

288
00:17:22,854 --> 00:17:24,734
Go home and send him back.

289
00:17:25,014 --> 00:17:26,854
Have you any potion left?

290
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:30,214
No more of that vile potion!
Never again!

291
00:17:32,854 --> 00:17:36,854
Don't spit on my floor!
It took hours to get that shine!

292
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,694
Is Ginette medieval too?

293
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:45,934
That's what I thought.

294
00:17:46,254 --> 00:17:48,054
Dame Ginette...

295
00:17:48,294 --> 00:17:51,134
would you and Mr. Kass
be so goodly

296
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:54,494
as to set the goodly table
for my goodly family

297
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:57,494
so that we may break bread?

298
00:17:57,734 --> 00:17:59,214
I must see someone

299
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,934
who'll send you back
you-know-where.

300
00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:04,334
- where?
- To the land of castles

301
00:18:04,694 --> 00:18:06,334
and valiant knights.

302
00:18:06,574 --> 00:18:08,934
Are you feeling well,
Mrs. Goulard?

303
00:18:09,174 --> 00:18:12,414
You'll both eat at the table,
not on the floor.

304
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:14,934
we're not dogs.

305
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:19,454
I'm tolerant. My husband's a commoner
but I don't mind.

306
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:20,454
Thanks a ton!

307
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:22,294
So setteth the table.

308
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,494
Yeah, I get it. I'm the new slave.

309
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:46,574
Get lost!

310
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,614
- The peasant!
- Go!

311
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,894
what a pain!

312
00:18:53,374 --> 00:18:54,814
A new gardener?

313
00:18:55,054 --> 00:18:57,974
My wife decided to help
a hobo and his wife.

314
00:18:58,614 --> 00:18:59,734
we all should.

315
00:19:00,694 --> 00:19:03,134
If you want ours,
be my guest!

316
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,534
sorry, it's just the gum.
I can't see a thing.

317
00:19:12,774 --> 00:19:14,654
Here, put this on it.

318
00:19:20,214 --> 00:19:21,694
My cigars in the sink!

319
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:27,894
Did you touch these?

320
00:19:29,854 --> 00:19:30,494
I see...

321
00:19:37,974 --> 00:19:39,934
I have an urgent errand to run.

322
00:19:40,174 --> 00:19:41,094
where?

323
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:43,934
I have to send Mr. Kass

324
00:19:44,174 --> 00:19:45,734
and Dame Ginette back.

325
00:19:45,974 --> 00:19:47,494
They'll be home alone?

326
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:49,894
I'll put them in front of the Tv.

327
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:57,294
It blew!

328
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:14,494
what's this mess?
why did you touch the fridge?

329
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:16,294
Bea!

330
00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:21,374
Kass is breaking bottles
in the kitchen!

331
00:20:22,774 --> 00:20:24,134
Come here.

332
00:20:24,374 --> 00:20:27,334
Everything here
is too unusual for you.

333
00:20:28,174 --> 00:20:30,534
- Unusual?
- It's all so new to you.

334
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:32,054
Bitch.

335
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:36,374
Excuse me... Back to work.

336
00:20:37,974 --> 00:20:41,414
You two will be good
and sit on this bench

337
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:43,374
which we call a "sofa".

338
00:20:43,614 --> 00:20:44,654
surprise time!

339
00:20:44,894 --> 00:20:46,014
Like minstrels?

340
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:50,734
Hark! Hark!
Here they come!

341
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:54,494
Great, isn't it?
Now get Mr. Kass

342
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:57,454
and show him the "minstrel box"!

343
00:20:57,894 --> 00:21:00,334
Yeah, right.
The minstrel box.

344
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:01,854
Old bat!

345
00:21:08,294 --> 00:21:10,334
Daddy-o! Bimbo-bo left.

346
00:21:10,574 --> 00:21:13,054
It's cocktail time!
see if they have

347
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:14,414
cable TV.

348
00:21:16,334 --> 00:21:18,974
Go look. step on it!

349
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:27,294
Devilry!

350
00:21:33,774 --> 00:21:36,614
Don't move, ma'am.
This is the hard part.

351
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:47,814
what the hell did they do?
I knew it!

352
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,734
The needle's in your palate.

353
00:21:53,974 --> 00:21:55,574
I'll take it right out.

354
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:57,654
Devilry!

355
00:21:58,094 --> 00:21:59,654
what's wrong, Daddy-o?

356
00:22:02,814 --> 00:22:04,214
God Almighty!

357
00:22:05,694 --> 00:22:07,934
what on earth happened?

358
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:11,974
what happened? what did you do?
The Tv imploded!

359
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:14,254
I'm deaf! I'm deaf!

360
00:22:14,494 --> 00:22:16,414
It exploded in his face!

361
00:22:16,654 --> 00:22:18,374
stop moving. Let me look.

362
00:22:20,494 --> 00:22:21,774
I'm deaf!

363
00:22:22,014 --> 00:22:24,214
His ear is full of wax!

364
00:22:24,454 --> 00:22:26,614
My poor Daddy-o! Call a doctor!

365
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,334
I am a doctor!

366
00:22:28,574 --> 00:22:31,534
I'm deaf! stone-deaf!

367
00:22:31,774 --> 00:22:34,534
Try to yawn. Yawn!

368
00:22:39,494 --> 00:22:42,294
Nice going, Daddy-o! Nice going!

369
00:22:43,414 --> 00:22:46,134
I can hear! I can hear!

370
00:22:46,374 --> 00:22:48,374
The Devil box burst into flames!

371
00:22:48,614 --> 00:22:50,974
Shitty TV! was it secondhand?

372
00:22:51,214 --> 00:22:52,254
shut up!

373
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:56,494
what's that smell?
something's burning!

374
00:22:58,694 --> 00:22:59,934
The sofas!

375
00:23:00,294 --> 00:23:01,654
water, fast!

376
00:23:01,894 --> 00:23:03,774
water! water!

377
00:23:04,094 --> 00:23:05,654
The Fire Department!

378
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:12,974
water! water! Here comes water!

379
00:23:18,374 --> 00:23:20,054
Dr. Eusebe - Medium

380
00:23:24,214 --> 00:23:27,334
That hurts!
The professor gave my ancestor

381
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,334
a time-traveling potion.

382
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,334
He's sick.

383
00:23:30,574 --> 00:23:32,694
Let her in, Mariette!

384
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:35,974
sorry to bother you,

385
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:39,494
but I need a drop of the potion

386
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:41,774
you gave Godefroy, my ancestor?

387
00:23:42,174 --> 00:23:44,734
He left his servant and his wife here

388
00:23:44,974 --> 00:23:47,214
and took off with Jacquart.

389
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:48,534
Get it?

390
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:52,334
Everyone must get back into place.

391
00:23:55,694 --> 00:23:57,934
Goodness gracious!
Books of magic!

392
00:23:59,094 --> 00:24:01,574
I'll need strength
to concoct the potion.

393
00:24:01,814 --> 00:24:03,974
It requires concentration.

394
00:24:04,214 --> 00:24:06,814
Mariette will deliver it at dawn.

395
00:24:07,094 --> 00:24:09,454
Never mention what you've seen.

396
00:24:09,694 --> 00:24:12,054
No one wants
to believe these things,

397
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:15,854
and the uninitiated pay for it dearly.

398
00:24:16,894 --> 00:24:18,854
There are rats!

399
00:24:19,094 --> 00:24:21,254
Help! Rats!

400
00:24:28,254 --> 00:24:29,574
Rats!

401
00:24:30,014 --> 00:24:32,014
Here's your slop, satan child!

402
00:24:32,534 --> 00:24:36,734
Eat up, because tomorrow,
you'll be on the rack!

403
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:39,254
It's you!
Don't you recognize me?

404
00:24:40,574 --> 00:24:42,374
Aren't you Jacques Kass?

405
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:43,894
You know my brother?

406
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:47,694
That toad!
I'm Prosper the Manure Man.

407
00:24:47,934 --> 00:24:49,894
- The what?
- I collect manure.

408
00:24:50,214 --> 00:24:51,814
That's what I smell!

409
00:24:52,614 --> 00:24:55,494
we're family.
You can't abandon me!

410
00:24:55,734 --> 00:24:58,814
I have a gorgeous
18-carat gold watch.

411
00:24:59,054 --> 00:25:01,374
If you let me out, it's yours!

412
00:25:02,054 --> 00:25:03,414
It's chic!

413
00:25:03,854 --> 00:25:06,334
Thief! Come back here!

414
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:08,854
- Piglet!
- I'm sorry!

415
00:25:11,374 --> 00:25:13,454
Don't go, cousin!

416
00:25:13,694 --> 00:25:16,734
we found sergeant Gibbon
squeezed into a cage,

417
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,254
half-dressed,

418
00:25:18,494 --> 00:25:21,654
drugged with a massive dose
of Dragonal.

419
00:25:21,894 --> 00:25:24,294
I'm investigating the assault.

420
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:26,974
when can I interrogate Gibbon?

421
00:25:27,214 --> 00:25:30,054
He's safe,
but full of anti-depressants.

422
00:25:30,294 --> 00:25:32,534
He'll be on cloud nine for weeks.

423
00:25:32,774 --> 00:25:34,254
Unfortunate.

424
00:25:35,614 --> 00:25:38,934
I hear he jotted things down
in a notebook.

425
00:25:39,174 --> 00:25:40,734
Bingo.

426
00:25:43,094 --> 00:25:44,494
Unusual.

427
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:47,934
Is it a prescription drug?

428
00:25:48,174 --> 00:25:50,374
Dragonal?
small doses are calming.

429
00:25:50,614 --> 00:25:54,534
Large doses plus alcohol
make it an antidysleptic.

430
00:25:54,774 --> 00:25:57,574
Lots of kids stuff themselves with it

431
00:25:57,814 --> 00:26:00,814
at rave parties.
They all look like him.

432
00:26:01,054 --> 00:26:03,454
Rave parties,
peptic antidepressants...

433
00:26:03,694 --> 00:26:05,454
Psychodysleptic.

434
00:26:06,014 --> 00:26:07,014
Yeah, psycho.

435
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:23,814
Thanks, but keep clear.

436
00:26:24,174 --> 00:26:26,414
Leave it to us, okay?

437
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:35,654
Am I speaking Chinese? Get lost!

438
00:26:43,454 --> 00:26:44,454
Ignoramus!

439
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,294
Gilbert! Rene!

440
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:52,494
The needle broke
and I can't get it out.

441
00:26:55,534 --> 00:26:57,534
Excuse me. It may be my wife.

442
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:02,254
Cora, we got cut off before.

443
00:27:02,494 --> 00:27:05,134
Bad timing. The Tv imploded.

444
00:27:05,934 --> 00:27:07,014
Hubert's fine.

445
00:27:07,254 --> 00:27:10,334
Just amnesiac.
I'll let his friend explain.

446
00:27:11,094 --> 00:27:13,174
Mr. Kass! Mr. Kass!

447
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:15,054
Come here!

448
00:27:18,654 --> 00:27:19,734
Gilbert!

449
00:27:20,374 --> 00:27:22,254
Cousin Hube's wife.

450
00:27:27,294 --> 00:27:28,774
Here he is.

451
00:27:35,374 --> 00:27:38,134
Hello, sir.
Are you Montmirail's friend?

452
00:27:38,374 --> 00:27:40,654
Me? I'm Jacquasse!

453
00:27:41,454 --> 00:27:43,654
Is this amnesia stuff
for the birds?

454
00:27:43,894 --> 00:27:44,654
what is it?

455
00:27:45,254 --> 00:27:48,814
The birds? Bird chasing!

456
00:27:56,494 --> 00:27:57,734
Must you whistle?

457
00:27:57,974 --> 00:28:01,214
why did that bastard
disappear from my life

458
00:28:01,454 --> 00:28:02,974
for 15 years?

459
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:04,574
You're embarrassed!

460
00:28:04,814 --> 00:28:08,134
The minstrel box is in flames!
It is devilry!

461
00:28:09,014 --> 00:28:10,814
what? who is this idiot!

462
00:28:11,974 --> 00:28:14,214
- where is Montmirail?
- In his fortress.

463
00:28:14,454 --> 00:28:16,854
Celebrating his marriage!

464
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:19,374
He's remarrying? Perfect.

465
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,734
Tell him to expect
some legal trouble, okay?

466
00:28:24,374 --> 00:28:25,734
This guy's an ass.

467
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:28,414
Can I speak to Hubert?

468
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:30,934
Are you Hubert's friend?

469
00:28:31,414 --> 00:28:32,454
Do you know him?

470
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:35,894
The idiot doesn't even know Hubert.

471
00:28:38,094 --> 00:28:40,054
He hung up on me!

472
00:28:47,614 --> 00:28:49,894
Philippine, your father's alive.

473
00:28:50,534 --> 00:28:51,214
He is?

474
00:28:56,934 --> 00:29:00,054
Look. I was five
when he disappeared.

475
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:08,494
Gilbert, let her rip!

476
00:29:08,734 --> 00:29:11,254
Gilbert! Let her rip!

477
00:29:11,614 --> 00:29:15,174
- what happened?
- A fire due to a Tv that imploded.

478
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:17,374
Hilda, are the kids okay?

479
00:29:17,614 --> 00:29:18,894
we just got here.

480
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:22,014
Is the man who insists on helping
a relative?

481
00:29:22,254 --> 00:29:24,174
Mr. Kass? Yes, he's... kin.

482
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:29,814
Tell him to stop. He may get hurt.
He'll ruin our equipment.

483
00:29:30,054 --> 00:29:31,854
Dame Ginette, please tell

484
00:29:32,094 --> 00:29:35,174
your goodly companion not to help the...

485
00:29:36,294 --> 00:29:39,214
The helmeted foot soldiers
can manage alone.

486
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:41,294
say what?

487
00:29:41,534 --> 00:29:44,374
They don't need him.
where is Jean-Pierre?

488
00:29:44,614 --> 00:29:46,414
what a shitty day!

489
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:51,214
All done. what a day!

490
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:56,134
we don't need a second hose!

491
00:29:56,374 --> 00:29:57,214
It unwinds!

492
00:29:57,454 --> 00:29:58,494
Rinse!

493
00:29:58,734 --> 00:30:01,854
They're flooding the house!
what happened?

494
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:05,454
Kass threw vodka on the fire!

495
00:30:12,414 --> 00:30:15,094
Turn it off! It's wet enough.

496
00:30:15,894 --> 00:30:17,774
All my carpets are floating!

497
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:21,574
we did what we had to.
You can sleep safe and sound.

498
00:30:28,014 --> 00:30:31,374
Do I have to wait much longer?

499
00:30:38,574 --> 00:30:40,574
Cut off the water!

500
00:30:40,814 --> 00:30:41,574
Cut!

501
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:53,654
A mop!

502
00:31:08,854 --> 00:31:11,334
The water's cut off, chief!

503
00:31:12,774 --> 00:31:14,654
what asshole turned it on?

504
00:31:17,694 --> 00:31:18,454
Shit heap!

505
00:31:18,694 --> 00:31:19,374
Excuse me?

506
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:20,574
Hands off.

507
00:31:21,374 --> 00:31:22,894
Dumb ass!

508
00:31:23,254 --> 00:31:25,334
The bum broke the siren!

509
00:31:33,094 --> 00:31:35,454
This joke is in bad taste!

510
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,934
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I forgot about you.

511
00:31:39,174 --> 00:31:41,214
Your hobo hosed me down!

512
00:31:41,454 --> 00:31:44,134
I'll ruin your reputation!

513
00:31:47,014 --> 00:31:48,494
Swine!

514
00:31:49,054 --> 00:31:51,574
I paid to get my mouth destroyed!

515
00:31:51,814 --> 00:31:53,334
I won't forget this!

516
00:31:53,574 --> 00:31:56,374
Kass!
why did you soak his patient?

517
00:31:57,814 --> 00:32:00,014
You and your Dame
must go back home.

518
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:02,294
what the hell is going on?

519
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:04,774
You're a butcher, not a dentist!

520
00:32:08,374 --> 00:32:09,734
You okay?

521
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:12,494
No more ice.

522
00:32:19,294 --> 00:32:21,934
That's risky, Daddy-o!

523
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:26,134
They're safer
in Hot Mama's little bag.

524
00:32:26,574 --> 00:32:28,574
The Duke lost his jewels?

525
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:31,654
Heal him or I shan't marry.

526
00:32:32,094 --> 00:32:34,534
Take the man on the stake

527
00:32:34,774 --> 00:32:38,134
back to his time,
or the seven plagues of Egypt

528
00:32:38,654 --> 00:32:41,374
will strike your lands.

529
00:32:41,854 --> 00:32:46,694
Icy winds sweep
through the open Corridors of Time.

530
00:32:47,254 --> 00:32:49,214
I'll prepare the potion.

531
00:32:49,454 --> 00:32:51,934
Make haste
before Jacquasse's descendant

532
00:32:52,174 --> 00:32:55,254
denounces us all to the Inquisitor.

533
00:32:55,694 --> 00:32:57,094
The Inquisitor? Here?

534
00:32:57,494 --> 00:33:00,414
I will pack my bags
and leave at once!

535
00:33:00,654 --> 00:33:02,414
First fix the plagues!

536
00:33:05,094 --> 00:33:06,414
what is it?

537
00:33:06,854 --> 00:33:08,574
It's for me. The old biddy.

538
00:33:10,454 --> 00:33:12,734
Half a glass for each.

539
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:16,334
Here's the spell.

540
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:19,054
It stinks! They'll never drink this!

541
00:33:19,294 --> 00:33:21,574
You can't taste it in cocoa.

542
00:33:21,814 --> 00:33:24,614
And it doesn't alter the potion.

543
00:33:29,894 --> 00:33:31,614
A drop of magic potion...

544
00:33:35,494 --> 00:33:37,734
Rise and shine! Breakfast time!

545
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,134
Her again.

546
00:33:39,374 --> 00:33:42,294
Hot cocoa!
Have you ever had chocolate?

547
00:33:42,534 --> 00:33:45,574
Hot, hot, hot, hot cocoa!

548
00:33:45,814 --> 00:33:48,094
Chocolate! Crunch! Crunch!

549
00:33:48,454 --> 00:33:50,974
You know Crunch Bars?
This is Nesquik!

550
00:33:52,174 --> 00:33:54,654
Slowly, don't choke!

551
00:33:55,174 --> 00:33:56,134
I'm off!

552
00:33:56,374 --> 00:33:58,374
Happy golfing! see you tonight!

553
00:33:58,614 --> 00:33:59,734
Begone, peasant!

554
00:33:59,974 --> 00:34:01,134
I'll handle them.

555
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:06,014
Hot cocoa! what a good idea.
we never have it.

556
00:34:06,254 --> 00:34:07,774
Cocoa is new to you.

557
00:34:08,094 --> 00:34:11,574
The conquistadores
brought it back

558
00:34:11,814 --> 00:34:13,614
from Mejico ages ago.

559
00:34:13,854 --> 00:34:15,134
It was the rage!

560
00:34:15,374 --> 00:34:18,014
People adore it! As Jean-Pierre says:

561
00:34:18,254 --> 00:34:22,094
"Try new things
or you'll end up a dum-dum!"

562
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:26,734
No way, bimbo-bo!
screw your Mexican snobs!

563
00:34:26,974 --> 00:34:28,574
I won't puke for you.

564
00:34:28,814 --> 00:34:30,254
Give me her nectar!

565
00:34:30,494 --> 00:34:32,334
stop, it's not for you!

566
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:35,334
It's your turn!

567
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,974
Get off my back! stop hounding me!

568
00:34:38,214 --> 00:34:40,454
I'm not Bimbo-bo's slave!

569
00:34:40,694 --> 00:34:43,214
I'll get gas and hock the jewels.

570
00:34:43,894 --> 00:34:45,534
Then it's party time!

571
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:48,254
First drink your cocoa!

572
00:34:48,494 --> 00:34:50,134
My jewels!

573
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:54,614
- I'll cut her throat!
- Stay here!

574
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,694
why are you screaming?

575
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:01,774
Per horus et per ra

576
00:35:04,374 --> 00:35:06,014
per solem invictus du chere

577
00:35:15,574 --> 00:35:17,374
Jean-Pierre! It works!

578
00:35:17,614 --> 00:35:19,014
That proves it!

579
00:35:21,134 --> 00:35:23,334
what are all these golf balls?

580
00:35:26,134 --> 00:35:28,934
Dame Ginette...
she's no piece of cake.

581
00:35:30,774 --> 00:35:33,094
Hark! Hark!
Goodly Dame Ginette!

582
00:35:33,334 --> 00:35:34,414
Hear ye!

583
00:35:34,654 --> 00:35:37,814
Can thou manage
in this hostile world?

584
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:40,094
- You bet.
- vaunt thee not!

585
00:35:40,334 --> 00:35:42,134
I'm off to Bourges.

586
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:44,494
That's 500, not 50.

587
00:35:44,734 --> 00:35:47,654
she talks weird.
Is she a foreigner?

588
00:35:47,894 --> 00:35:50,494
Pure French
with a stick up her ass.

589
00:35:51,254 --> 00:35:52,174
Dame Ginette!

590
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:55,334
You're blocking the corridors!

591
00:35:55,574 --> 00:35:57,014
Lend me an ear!

592
00:35:57,254 --> 00:36:00,014
I'll stick like glue
till you try my cocoa.

593
00:36:00,254 --> 00:36:03,334
Okay, Glue Girl.
You can help me. Carry these.

594
00:36:03,574 --> 00:36:06,334
I got a bad back.
we'll talk cocoa later.

595
00:36:06,574 --> 00:36:07,974
You're on!

596
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:10,174
very heavy...

597
00:36:10,454 --> 00:36:11,254
Dame Ginette!

598
00:36:12,094 --> 00:36:14,614
what's all this gas for?

599
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:17,254
You know about combustion?

600
00:36:17,494 --> 00:36:19,054
shut up and walk!

601
00:36:19,294 --> 00:36:22,374
You're a fast learner!
Good for you!

602
00:36:22,654 --> 00:36:27,014
Do you really think
you can live without Mr. Kass?

603
00:36:27,254 --> 00:36:30,494
Mrs. Goulard,
I'm an emancipated woman.

604
00:36:30,734 --> 00:36:32,214
I'm no guy's slave.

605
00:36:32,454 --> 00:36:36,254
Me neither. I say "Halt!"
when my hubby gets macho.

606
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:42,534
what am I doing here?

607
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,974
Help!

608
00:37:04,854 --> 00:37:05,814
sire Goulard!

609
00:37:06,374 --> 00:37:08,734
Mr. Kass! what's going on here?

610
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:12,534
Black magic!
we're in wolfen times!

611
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:14,174
what times?

612
00:37:16,294 --> 00:37:18,614
You took my gold letter-opener?

613
00:37:20,494 --> 00:37:23,214
what are you doing?

614
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:29,334
Idiot! You busted my coccyx!

615
00:37:29,574 --> 00:37:30,894
Hush!

616
00:37:33,414 --> 00:37:35,934
I smell horses! Hide thyself!

617
00:37:36,174 --> 00:37:40,134
stop playing cowboys and Indians!
Answer me!

618
00:37:45,654 --> 00:37:47,494
- who's that?
- The Thug!

619
00:37:47,774 --> 00:37:50,734
The Duke of Luigny!
Burgundy scum!

620
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,254
what's that fortress over there?

621
00:38:00,494 --> 00:38:01,494
It's Montmirail's.

622
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:03,694
- what year is this?
- Follow me!

623
00:38:03,934 --> 00:38:05,934
The Thug attacks!

624
00:38:17,054 --> 00:38:18,294
I'm in slippers!

625
00:38:21,414 --> 00:38:24,174
where are we, Mr. Kass?

626
00:38:27,174 --> 00:38:30,014
I don't like this!

627
00:38:42,694 --> 00:38:44,654
Jacquasse is back!

628
00:38:45,094 --> 00:38:47,254
Be gentle, Boniface.

629
00:38:48,454 --> 00:38:49,894
The Thug attacks!

630
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:59,494
I take this village in ransom!

631
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:14,014
what is this place?

632
00:39:14,694 --> 00:39:18,294
My task is terrible,
but to free you of Evil

633
00:39:18,534 --> 00:39:20,414
it must be done.

634
00:39:20,654 --> 00:39:23,374
what are you going to do?

635
00:39:24,134 --> 00:39:25,094
The funnel!

636
00:39:27,174 --> 00:39:28,334
what's that thing?

637
00:39:32,814 --> 00:39:35,014
Postpone this. The alarm sounds.

638
00:39:35,254 --> 00:39:36,974
I must aid my serfs.

639
00:39:38,174 --> 00:39:40,574
Do your duty and I'll do mine.

640
00:39:41,054 --> 00:39:42,454
water!

641
00:39:44,614 --> 00:39:46,614
we will make him confess.

642
00:39:46,854 --> 00:39:48,094
we'll have proof

643
00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:51,694
to hang this sinner by his guts!
The trial by water

644
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:54,294
will merely loosen him up.

645
00:39:54,534 --> 00:39:56,854
should ever you slay him,

646
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,374
I'll slay you.

647
00:40:14,134 --> 00:40:16,974
He's after me, Mr. Kass!

648
00:40:24,774 --> 00:40:27,414
I want 9 holes of golf,
not a Holy war!

649
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:32,654
The Thug!

650
00:40:32,894 --> 00:40:34,254
Flee!

651
00:40:36,214 --> 00:40:37,894
Let's pillage!

652
00:40:47,414 --> 00:40:48,894
wait for me!

653
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:06,854
I'm clad like a fancy merchant!

654
00:41:13,494 --> 00:41:15,454
Help! Jacquasse is back!

655
00:41:15,934 --> 00:41:17,574
Help! Help!

656
00:41:17,814 --> 00:41:20,534
why did I marry you, wench?

657
00:41:22,174 --> 00:41:24,574
- who are you?
- Relax!

658
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:28,894
wait for me, Mr. Kass!

659
00:41:32,694 --> 00:41:34,214
Holy scrotums!

660
00:41:49,294 --> 00:41:52,294
we've caught Montmirail's squire!

661
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:54,574
Long live Burgundy!

662
00:41:54,934 --> 00:41:56,934
we'll drown him in a sack!

663
00:42:00,014 --> 00:42:02,214
Toil, never recoil!

664
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:06,614
Prepare to die, Montmirail.

665
00:42:07,374 --> 00:42:08,934
Your land will be mine.

666
00:42:09,174 --> 00:42:12,254
Kneel before the Duke of Burgundy!

667
00:42:12,494 --> 00:42:15,774
Never. My master is the King of France!

668
00:42:24,014 --> 00:42:25,334
Jacquasse!

669
00:42:25,574 --> 00:42:27,174
sire Ganelon!

670
00:42:44,894 --> 00:42:46,454
I'll be back!

671
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:48,174
Confess beforehand!

672
00:42:51,894 --> 00:42:53,574
Thank you, Master!

673
00:42:53,854 --> 00:42:55,294
Bless you and your kin!

674
00:42:56,014 --> 00:42:58,174
The Crass! You're here?

675
00:42:58,694 --> 00:43:01,974
You didn't send your descendant
in your place?

676
00:43:03,654 --> 00:43:06,974
He is in my dungeon, with the Inquisitor.

677
00:43:07,214 --> 00:43:10,254
My descendant? with the Inquisitor?

678
00:43:10,934 --> 00:43:15,014
A rascal stole the Duke's jewels
and the sacred tooth.

679
00:43:17,694 --> 00:43:20,214
If I marry not,
I will have no heirs.

680
00:43:20,454 --> 00:43:21,854
who can it be?

681
00:43:22,094 --> 00:43:23,494
searcheth me!

682
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:26,734
I charge you to find the evil-doer.

683
00:43:26,974 --> 00:43:28,814
I'll have him skinned alive.

684
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:30,734
Alive?

685
00:43:31,054 --> 00:43:32,974
we will be merciless!

686
00:43:35,054 --> 00:43:38,054
Sire, do not leave me alone!

687
00:43:48,374 --> 00:43:49,334
Run, Crass!

688
00:43:49,574 --> 00:43:51,294
Yes, sire!

689
00:43:57,614 --> 00:43:59,734
You've forgotten how to trot!

690
00:44:01,254 --> 00:44:02,774
You're soft!

691
00:44:03,294 --> 00:44:04,334
Like a pup!

692
00:44:05,094 --> 00:44:06,694
- Lady-love!
- My beloved!

693
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:08,774
Father is gravely ill.

694
00:44:09,014 --> 00:44:10,654
where is the tooth?

695
00:44:10,894 --> 00:44:12,174
The Crass inquires.

696
00:44:12,414 --> 00:44:14,054
I do, your Ladyship.

697
00:44:15,134 --> 00:44:16,374
I'll go pray.

698
00:44:16,894 --> 00:44:18,134
sire!

699
00:44:18,814 --> 00:44:21,854
The wretch is confessing
to vile sins!

700
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:31,054
Disarm him!

701
00:44:31,574 --> 00:44:35,574
I arrest you!
He has divulged your devilish pact!

702
00:44:36,094 --> 00:44:38,694
He burnt... the Range... Rover.

703
00:44:38,934 --> 00:44:41,214
I accuse you
of burning a man named

704
00:44:41,454 --> 00:44:42,774
Range, Robert.

705
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,174
Brother, who is Robert Range?

706
00:44:45,414 --> 00:44:47,574
we'll soon find out. water!

707
00:44:55,654 --> 00:44:57,494
My descendant is choking!

708
00:44:57,734 --> 00:45:00,694
silence! Don't interfere!
Brand his tongue!

709
00:45:12,974 --> 00:45:14,774
Down with the Inquisitor!

710
00:45:53,094 --> 00:45:55,694
Heretics!
Castle of heathens!

711
00:45:55,934 --> 00:45:58,214
Devil worshipers! You'll all burn!

712
00:45:58,494 --> 00:46:00,414
I'll destroy the lot of you!

713
00:46:04,334 --> 00:46:06,374
Lower the portcullis.

714
00:46:07,614 --> 00:46:08,854
I owe you my life.

715
00:46:09,374 --> 00:46:11,174
My duty is to protect you.

716
00:46:17,214 --> 00:46:19,734
My descendant!
His gutlets are swollen!

717
00:46:26,854 --> 00:46:29,574
stop playing with him.
Change your attire.

718
00:46:29,814 --> 00:46:31,254
That suits you not.

719
00:46:44,214 --> 00:46:46,014
sire! Eusabius has arrived.

720
00:46:51,734 --> 00:46:52,854
Jacquasse!

721
00:46:53,254 --> 00:46:55,934
why must I carry
your descendant alone?

722
00:46:56,174 --> 00:46:59,414
I was greeting
my long-lost brother.

723
00:46:59,774 --> 00:47:03,214
what is his problem?
The doorway is too small!

724
00:47:03,814 --> 00:47:05,494
sire! He pisseth!

725
00:47:07,054 --> 00:47:08,494
This is unending!

726
00:47:17,854 --> 00:47:19,814
whence this to-do?

727
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:22,814
It is drafty here.
You'll catcheth cold.

728
00:47:23,054 --> 00:47:24,694
'Tis icy for August!

729
00:47:26,254 --> 00:47:28,214
I have to piss!

730
00:47:28,894 --> 00:47:30,054
He must pisseth!

731
00:47:31,294 --> 00:47:33,294
He pisseth on my shoes!

732
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:51,414
Give me that.

733
00:47:51,974 --> 00:47:54,214
- Drink this!
- I'm full.

734
00:47:55,494 --> 00:47:57,574
Drink, I say!

735
00:47:59,734 --> 00:48:02,814
say the spell, before he vomits!

736
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:31,014
My descendant!
He is but a pile of dung!

737
00:48:34,814 --> 00:48:37,574
Emeralds on your fat fingers?

738
00:48:42,494 --> 00:48:45,334
A present from a secret admirer!

739
00:48:45,574 --> 00:48:47,854
Lies!
You stole from the Duke!

740
00:48:48,094 --> 00:48:49,294
He was dead!

741
00:48:49,534 --> 00:48:52,094
- I want them!
- Dame Ginette robbed me!

742
00:48:52,334 --> 00:48:55,294
Dame Ginette?
You mean... There?

743
00:48:55,534 --> 00:48:58,454
I see!
The Duke is being sucked from within.

744
00:48:59,094 --> 00:49:01,814
His jewels pull him into the Corridors.

745
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:05,254
His jewels cannot stay there

746
00:49:05,494 --> 00:49:06,734
if he is here.

747
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:09,654
I'll slay you, damned slug!

748
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:12,454
You owe me your life!

749
00:49:14,014 --> 00:49:16,454
Calamitas! Give me the potion!

750
00:49:16,694 --> 00:49:20,454
we'll find Dame Ginette
and bring back the sacred tooth.

751
00:49:20,694 --> 00:49:22,414
Or I'll have no heirs!

752
00:49:22,654 --> 00:49:25,374
Not the potion! It twists my guts!

753
00:49:29,214 --> 00:49:30,254
Drink!

754
00:49:39,334 --> 00:49:42,134
I hope to see you soon,
safe and sound.

755
00:49:42,374 --> 00:49:44,134
That potion is dangerous.

756
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:46,454
Drinking it takes courage.

757
00:49:46,694 --> 00:49:47,494
Much courage.

758
00:49:49,054 --> 00:49:50,774
For our return.

759
00:49:51,414 --> 00:49:52,974
I'm scared!

760
00:50:07,574 --> 00:50:08,814
They're gone.

761
00:50:09,334 --> 00:50:12,254
If they don't come back,
I'll bury you

762
00:50:12,494 --> 00:50:14,694
in the deepest dungeons.

763
00:50:22,454 --> 00:50:25,334
I'm impressed!
You're an ace at the wheel!

764
00:50:25,574 --> 00:50:26,974
And no license!

765
00:50:27,214 --> 00:50:29,494
If you had one, I'd be floored.

766
00:50:29,814 --> 00:50:31,014
- where now?
- Bourges.

767
00:50:32,374 --> 00:50:33,534
Tell me...

768
00:50:33,774 --> 00:50:37,294
what is your house like?
A hut with mud walls?

769
00:50:38,054 --> 00:50:41,014
No, we make bricks with our own shit.

770
00:50:43,174 --> 00:50:44,414
Gracious me!

771
00:50:45,614 --> 00:50:48,734
It's a great day
for Jean-Pierre to play golf.

772
00:51:12,974 --> 00:51:16,694
Tell my beloved
we'll be at my cousin's castle.

773
00:51:17,814 --> 00:51:19,134
'Tis Father's wish.

774
00:51:24,174 --> 00:51:26,014
Bea! Bea!

775
00:51:28,254 --> 00:51:30,214
who's this ruffian?

776
00:51:46,094 --> 00:51:47,014
Another madman!

777
00:51:49,414 --> 00:51:51,614
where are you going now?

778
00:51:51,854 --> 00:51:54,374
To find a classy pawnbroker.

779
00:51:55,094 --> 00:51:57,974
I have some hot rocks.
see you at the bar.

780
00:51:58,734 --> 00:52:00,694
I'll wait in this pub.

781
00:52:02,054 --> 00:52:04,494
A glass of water
and an empty glass.

782
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:13,014
Dame Ginette!
Come drink your cocoa!

783
00:52:14,894 --> 00:52:16,334
Naughty girl!

784
00:52:47,894 --> 00:52:49,294
Holy scrotums!

785
00:52:49,854 --> 00:52:53,254
- we're walled in!
- God punished us for drinking!

786
00:52:53,774 --> 00:52:55,414
silence, slug!

787
00:52:56,294 --> 00:52:57,974
Any sign of them?

788
00:52:58,214 --> 00:53:00,614
- Calling Clovis.
- Clovis, here.

789
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:03,774
No Jacquart here.
we'll dredge the pond.

790
00:53:04,294 --> 00:53:07,094
- we're walled in!
- Quiet, serf.

791
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:09,214
Eusabius had warned us!

792
00:53:09,454 --> 00:53:11,254
Doddering clod!

793
00:53:12,854 --> 00:53:15,014
we'll ram with this beam!

794
00:53:17,214 --> 00:53:18,254
It's hefty!

795
00:53:18,494 --> 00:53:20,694
Let's assume he wasn't kidnapped.

796
00:53:20,934 --> 00:53:23,694
Did Mr. Jacquart
ever go away unannounced?

797
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:26,214
sometimes he'd leave
for a few days.

798
00:53:26,654 --> 00:53:28,294
His little outings.

799
00:53:28,534 --> 00:53:31,494
Outings?
what did his outings consist of?

800
00:53:32,174 --> 00:53:34,774
Biking, golf, windsurfing.
Boy's stuff.

801
00:53:39,934 --> 00:53:40,894
Gourmet meals...

802
00:53:41,254 --> 00:53:45,414
with lots of wine.
Did he have a drinking problem?

803
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:56,934
Juglets! Juglets of wine!

804
00:54:03,854 --> 00:54:04,854
Come, boozehound!

805
00:54:05,094 --> 00:54:06,854
To King Louis the Fat!

806
00:54:08,294 --> 00:54:09,454
Long Live the Fat!

807
00:54:10,694 --> 00:54:11,894
Come!

808
00:54:19,014 --> 00:54:22,174
Mr. Jacquart is a wine connoisseur,
that's all.

809
00:54:26,254 --> 00:54:28,614
Here's to you, bumpkins!

810
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,014
who's the hobo?

811
00:54:31,254 --> 00:54:32,334
Jacquart's brother.

812
00:54:32,574 --> 00:54:34,974
He's the wino type.

813
00:54:53,534 --> 00:54:56,494
They don't come running
for our bags!

814
00:54:58,094 --> 00:54:59,094
Anyone here?

815
00:55:02,894 --> 00:55:04,654
The gypsies are back!

816
00:55:05,134 --> 00:55:08,054
Don't move!
what did you do with Jacquart?

817
00:55:08,294 --> 00:55:10,334
silence
and I'll slay thee not.

818
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:13,774
Chocolate! Crunch! Godefroy!

819
00:55:17,134 --> 00:55:19,094
- Come, fool.
- At once, sire!

820
00:55:20,014 --> 00:55:21,614
Put back my mousse!

821
00:55:24,174 --> 00:55:25,734
Thank you, good man!

822
00:55:25,974 --> 00:55:27,654
Thank you, kind lady!

823
00:55:35,974 --> 00:55:38,414
His hair
is aIways picture-perfect!

824
00:55:40,574 --> 00:55:42,294
Toil, never recoil!

825
00:55:43,854 --> 00:55:45,094
what's happening?

826
00:55:48,134 --> 00:55:51,134
strike not, sire!
It is the minstrel box!

827
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:53,214
Hold this mousse, bawd!

828
00:55:53,454 --> 00:55:54,614
And eat it not!

829
00:56:02,934 --> 00:56:04,694
Give me that, wench!

830
00:56:04,934 --> 00:56:07,174
Check how many stars they have.

831
00:56:07,414 --> 00:56:09,774
- why?
- They threw out a Tv.

832
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:11,534
Maybe it's broken.

833
00:56:11,894 --> 00:56:13,974
Gisele... the guide book!

834
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:20,454
The chimney sweep yelled at me!

835
00:56:22,174 --> 00:56:23,494
Here are the porters.

836
00:56:23,774 --> 00:56:26,414
Look at their clothes.
Not very fresh.

837
00:56:27,814 --> 00:56:29,094
You're so critical.

838
00:56:29,334 --> 00:56:31,614
There are more bags in the trunk.

839
00:56:31,854 --> 00:56:34,454
Good man,
take us in your chariot!

840
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:36,574
- Now!
- I say!

841
00:56:36,814 --> 00:56:38,654
- I'll complain!
- Obey or die!

842
00:56:39,414 --> 00:56:40,774
Be still, strumpet!

843
00:56:48,574 --> 00:56:51,454
I can't breathe!
This skunk is killing me!

844
00:56:51,694 --> 00:56:52,414
shut up!

845
00:56:52,814 --> 00:56:54,414
where does Ginette live?

846
00:56:54,814 --> 00:56:57,974
He travels too hastily.
I shall vomit phlegm.

847
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:00,534
sire Godefroy must phlegmeth!

848
00:57:00,774 --> 00:57:02,014
- what?
- Phlegm!

849
00:57:02,254 --> 00:57:02,934
stop!

850
00:57:03,174 --> 00:57:06,254
stop the chariot! He must phlegmeth!

851
00:57:10,054 --> 00:57:11,294
Get off me!

852
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,054
Don't work them up!

853
00:57:13,574 --> 00:57:15,454
You must drink vinegar.

854
00:57:15,694 --> 00:57:18,694
start the car while they're out there!

855
00:57:19,774 --> 00:57:21,734
stop screaming, numbskull!

856
00:57:21,974 --> 00:57:23,614
You're stressing me!

857
00:57:23,854 --> 00:57:26,854
I can steer a chariot!
Dame Ginette taught me!

858
00:57:29,774 --> 00:57:31,574
I'll drive less hastily!

859
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:33,934
Let me die alone!

860
00:57:40,654 --> 00:57:41,334
Hurry!

861
00:57:42,974 --> 00:57:44,454
we're stuck.

862
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:45,734
You stalled!

863
00:57:51,614 --> 00:57:52,694
You try!

864
00:57:53,694 --> 00:57:55,734
- Here we go.
- Backwards!

865
00:57:57,094 --> 00:57:58,494
Drive, godammit!

866
00:57:58,734 --> 00:58:00,854
Hold your horses!

867
00:58:01,174 --> 00:58:02,014
The chariot!

868
00:58:04,094 --> 00:58:06,614
Drive! The lunatics are coming!

869
00:58:10,174 --> 00:58:12,934
Faster! Get him off!

870
00:58:13,174 --> 00:58:14,654
I can't!

871
00:58:19,134 --> 00:58:21,814
You're hopeless! It's unbelievable!

872
00:58:22,054 --> 00:58:23,054
Quiet!

873
00:58:31,934 --> 00:58:33,254
Not bad.

874
00:58:41,854 --> 00:58:45,094
- You shook him off! My hero!
- That's enough!

875
00:58:46,214 --> 00:58:49,454
Hosanna, sire!

876
00:58:51,854 --> 00:58:55,254
Bravo, sire!
Just like in the good old days!

877
00:59:03,814 --> 00:59:07,374
so Hube de Montmirail
abducted Mr. Jacquart?

878
00:59:07,614 --> 00:59:10,334
I bet he strangled him with a chain!

879
00:59:10,574 --> 00:59:12,454
Don't get carried away.

880
00:59:13,654 --> 00:59:15,254
what century is this?

881
00:59:15,494 --> 00:59:16,294
The boss!

882
00:59:16,534 --> 00:59:17,374
where were you?

883
00:59:17,614 --> 00:59:19,254
Force-fed putrid water!

884
00:59:19,494 --> 00:59:21,254
Tortured by a mad monk!

885
00:59:21,494 --> 00:59:23,854
I was in the Middle Ages!

886
00:59:25,494 --> 00:59:29,494
Arrest Montmirail. He drugged me
and sent me to wolfen times.

887
00:59:29,734 --> 00:59:31,334
Like sergeant Gibbon?

888
00:59:32,414 --> 00:59:33,894
Pee-pee!

889
00:59:42,054 --> 00:59:44,134
why is he in the broom closet?

890
00:59:44,374 --> 00:59:45,694
Relieving himself.

891
00:59:48,934 --> 00:59:51,134
- what's downstairs?
- The wine cellar.

892
00:59:51,374 --> 00:59:53,374
The wine cellar. It figures.

893
01:00:01,534 --> 01:00:02,894
To the left!

894
01:00:15,014 --> 01:00:16,814
Drive, since you can!

895
01:00:17,054 --> 01:00:18,934
At once, sire!

896
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:26,934
Nothing, not even a noise!

897
01:00:27,214 --> 01:00:31,334
I am pressing the pedalette,
as did Dame Ginette!

898
01:00:32,774 --> 01:00:35,374
what are all these pedalettes?

899
01:00:36,574 --> 01:00:38,934
Alight, knave!
You are no charioteer!

900
01:00:39,414 --> 01:00:40,894
Hosanna!

901
01:00:47,334 --> 01:00:49,054
Hold the reigns tight!

902
01:00:49,294 --> 01:00:50,654
The van!

903
01:00:52,294 --> 01:00:54,494
I am a master charioteer!

904
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:58,014
All is under control.
Take comfort.

905
01:01:40,374 --> 01:01:41,854
we're going backwards!

906
01:01:42,094 --> 01:01:44,934
Indeed, sire!
But I am not to blame!

907
01:01:49,534 --> 01:01:53,254
It's bolting! It's bolting!

908
01:02:28,214 --> 01:02:30,134
It's the Moor, sire!

909
01:02:30,374 --> 01:02:31,094
The psychos!

910
01:02:32,054 --> 01:02:34,414
The psychos are back!

911
01:02:41,934 --> 01:02:44,654
with this garb,
we can go unnoticed.

912
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:46,454
wily ruse!

913
01:02:50,094 --> 01:02:52,294
No one has remarked us yet.

914
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:54,014
The ruse works!

915
01:02:54,734 --> 01:02:57,494
Officers! Officers!

916
01:02:57,894 --> 01:03:00,174
Officers!

917
01:03:00,454 --> 01:03:01,414
Damned bawd!

918
01:03:01,654 --> 01:03:02,894
silence. Yes, woman?

919
01:03:03,134 --> 01:03:06,014
My son won't do his work.

920
01:03:06,254 --> 01:03:08,774
He just watches Tv. so I said:

921
01:03:09,014 --> 01:03:12,294
"Do your work or I'll call the cops. "

922
01:03:12,534 --> 01:03:15,014
Can you scare him a bit?

923
01:03:15,254 --> 01:03:16,454
Follow me.

924
01:03:22,134 --> 01:03:24,214
Eddy, the police came for you.

925
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,974
Go on. scare him a little.

926
01:03:38,254 --> 01:03:39,614
work, little man!

927
01:03:40,694 --> 01:03:42,414
Cursed minstrel box!

928
01:03:48,774 --> 01:03:51,134
The neighbor's throwing Tvs now!

929
01:04:01,174 --> 01:04:03,134
Here he is!

930
01:04:03,374 --> 01:04:06,214
I'm innocent!
I'm Beatrice's husband!

931
01:04:06,974 --> 01:04:08,574
Drink this potion!

932
01:04:08,814 --> 01:04:10,334
what potion?

933
01:04:17,894 --> 01:04:19,694
My God! They're back!

934
01:04:21,254 --> 01:04:25,214
- Godefroy, why are you here?
- Let's find Dame Ginette!

935
01:04:25,454 --> 01:04:28,414
The jewel thief! we'll cut off her hand!

936
01:04:28,654 --> 01:04:31,094
The jewels of my future father-in-law.

937
01:04:32,094 --> 01:04:35,774
what are you wearing?
where did you steal those?

938
01:04:36,014 --> 01:04:37,734
- we found them.
- In a chariot.

939
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:40,534
If they find you,
we'll be in a crunch!

940
01:04:41,014 --> 01:04:44,374
Chocolate! Crunch! Crunch!

941
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,374
we must find Dame Ginette.

942
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:48,974
she slipped away at Bourges.

943
01:04:49,574 --> 01:04:50,374
To Bourges!

944
01:04:50,614 --> 01:04:52,814
Off with her hand at Bourges!

945
01:04:53,054 --> 01:04:55,374
she vanished. Flew the coop!

946
01:04:55,614 --> 01:04:56,414
vanish'd?

947
01:04:56,654 --> 01:04:58,894
vanish'd! Calamitas!

948
01:04:59,134 --> 01:05:01,294
'Tis tragedy, my child.

949
01:05:01,534 --> 01:05:04,454
Only the Relic can close
the Corridors of Time.

950
01:05:04,694 --> 01:05:07,814
If the Duke dies, I will not marry.

951
01:05:08,134 --> 01:05:09,894
I will have no heirs.

952
01:05:10,134 --> 01:05:12,854
Ultra urgent! we have to hurry.

953
01:05:13,094 --> 01:05:16,974
- Or 7 plagues will strike!
- 7 plagues? Nasty!

954
01:05:21,774 --> 01:05:22,654
Anyone home?

955
01:05:24,974 --> 01:05:27,454
- A marshal!
- Death to him!

956
01:05:34,174 --> 01:05:35,774
Take off your jackets!

957
01:05:36,014 --> 01:05:40,694
Give me that knife.
You better not touch the policeman!

958
01:05:40,934 --> 01:05:42,814
But he'll arrest us!

959
01:05:43,054 --> 01:05:45,174
Take these stripes off.

960
01:05:46,894 --> 01:05:48,614
Get moving!

961
01:05:50,654 --> 01:05:53,654
Godefroy, remember you're cousin Hube.

962
01:05:53,894 --> 01:05:56,414
Be on your best behavior.

963
01:05:56,654 --> 01:05:57,774
Anyone home?

964
01:06:00,534 --> 01:06:01,614
Hello, Colonel.

965
01:06:01,854 --> 01:06:03,014
Captain.

966
01:06:03,254 --> 01:06:04,934
Captain Batardet, I'm looking

967
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:06,934
for Hubert de Montmirail.

968
01:06:07,174 --> 01:06:10,294
You're in luck.
Hube came for tea...

969
01:06:10,934 --> 01:06:12,374
with his mechanic.

970
01:06:14,854 --> 01:06:15,654
Gentlemen...

971
01:06:16,254 --> 01:06:17,974
Hube is a rally driver.

972
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:21,054
Not recommended
for obeying speed limits.

973
01:06:36,774 --> 01:06:38,694
since a near-fatal accident,

974
01:06:38,934 --> 01:06:41,254
they only wear blue and white.

975
01:06:42,494 --> 01:06:43,334
Fair enough.

976
01:06:44,174 --> 01:06:45,134
You had a fire?

977
01:06:45,574 --> 01:06:48,694
The Tv exploded. All of a sudden.

978
01:06:49,334 --> 01:06:51,774
something smells really vile.

979
01:06:52,214 --> 01:06:53,654
The fire.

980
01:06:57,214 --> 01:06:58,894
More like... dirty feet.

981
01:06:59,454 --> 01:07:01,654
Minstrel box caused great fire.

982
01:07:01,894 --> 01:07:04,614
Don't you know
"The Minstrel Box"?

983
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:08,094
A new Tv show
of golden oldies?

984
01:07:08,334 --> 01:07:09,534
very nostalgic.

985
01:07:09,774 --> 01:07:12,774
I stick to the weather
and traffic reports.

986
01:07:13,934 --> 01:07:16,214
Mr. Jacquart claims

987
01:07:16,454 --> 01:07:19,094
you drugged him
and put him in a cage...

988
01:07:28,214 --> 01:07:29,454
Phlegm trouble.

989
01:07:33,294 --> 01:07:36,094
You know Mr. Jacquart, his brother.

990
01:07:36,334 --> 01:07:37,214
The Manure Man!

991
01:07:37,454 --> 01:07:39,374
A brother other than Jacquart?

992
01:07:39,614 --> 01:07:41,094
He's a little Crass!

993
01:07:41,334 --> 01:07:43,974
He is swine, good only for pissing.

994
01:07:44,214 --> 01:07:45,614
You're exaggerating.

995
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:48,134
water torture makes him piss!

996
01:07:48,374 --> 01:07:51,894
sorry to say so,
but he pisses anywhere.

997
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:55,214
so you agree
that his brother is a wino.

998
01:07:56,574 --> 01:07:57,494
They agree.

999
01:07:57,734 --> 01:07:59,654
Let us go find Dame Ginette.

1000
01:07:59,894 --> 01:08:02,934
- And cut her hand off!
- Cut whose hand off?

1001
01:08:03,174 --> 01:08:05,534
she's a friend with leprosy.

1002
01:08:05,774 --> 01:08:07,974
she caught it in Borneo.

1003
01:08:08,214 --> 01:08:11,974
we're gradually cutting off her arm.
It's ghastly.

1004
01:08:12,334 --> 01:08:14,134
God knows where it will end.

1005
01:08:14,854 --> 01:08:16,734
Incurable diseases are awful.

1006
01:08:17,174 --> 01:08:18,254
I'm sorry.

1007
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:19,454
My husband!

1008
01:08:21,334 --> 01:08:23,534
I'm going to bed. I'm dead.

1009
01:08:23,774 --> 01:08:28,094
where were you?
You didn't play golf? what happened?

1010
01:08:28,334 --> 01:08:29,974
I fell asleep.

1011
01:08:30,654 --> 01:08:33,614
In the woods.
I had a terrible nightmare.

1012
01:08:33,974 --> 01:08:35,774
I'm going back to bed.

1013
01:08:36,014 --> 01:08:37,534
At noon? To bed?

1014
01:08:37,774 --> 01:08:39,814
He's back!

1015
01:08:40,254 --> 01:08:44,134
He was at Petronille's!
Chesty Petronille!

1016
01:08:45,574 --> 01:08:48,214
why sleep outside?

1017
01:08:48,614 --> 01:08:50,694
- who's Petronille?
- No idea!

1018
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:54,134
stop by the precinct this week

1019
01:08:54,374 --> 01:08:56,254
if you wish to refute

1020
01:08:56,494 --> 01:08:58,694
his brother's allegations.

1021
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:00,654
He's full of manure!

1022
01:09:01,334 --> 01:09:04,814
Things aren't kissy-kissy
in the family.

1023
01:09:05,334 --> 01:09:07,734
Goodbye, ma'am.
And call a plumber.

1024
01:09:07,974 --> 01:09:12,614
A pipe probably burst in the fire.
It smells like a sewer in here.

1025
01:09:13,014 --> 01:09:14,734
I'll see you out.

1026
01:09:24,134 --> 01:09:25,214
what happened?

1027
01:09:25,454 --> 01:09:28,054
It's nothing.
The lighter exploded.

1028
01:09:28,294 --> 01:09:29,934
The lighter?

1029
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,854
Incredible!

1030
01:09:35,014 --> 01:09:36,454
Mr. Kass, tell me...

1031
01:09:37,334 --> 01:09:39,654
This may sound stupid

1032
01:09:39,894 --> 01:09:43,694
but were we together
in a wet forest with wolves?

1033
01:09:43,934 --> 01:09:45,854
wolfens! wolfens!

1034
01:09:46,094 --> 01:09:47,854
wolves, idiot! Forget it.

1035
01:09:48,214 --> 01:09:49,934
Thanks anyway.

1036
01:09:50,174 --> 01:09:52,094
- Do we have a lighter?
- Yes, sir.

1037
01:09:52,334 --> 01:09:55,574
watch out.
They can rip your face off.

1038
01:09:58,094 --> 01:10:01,254
Beatrice! I finally found
this shack of yours.

1039
01:10:01,934 --> 01:10:02,854
Is Hubert here?

1040
01:10:03,654 --> 01:10:05,454
I'll just open the gate.

1041
01:10:08,094 --> 01:10:10,414
Come, child! In the chariot!

1042
01:10:10,654 --> 01:10:12,734
we're in a pickle! It's Cora,

1043
01:10:12,974 --> 01:10:14,854
Hubert's wife. Hide!

1044
01:10:15,174 --> 01:10:16,374
No, Hubert!

1045
01:10:16,814 --> 01:10:19,574
You've hidden for 10 years.
Not this time!

1046
01:10:21,454 --> 01:10:22,374
That's Dad?

1047
01:10:22,854 --> 01:10:25,934
Yes. He's changed.
I barely recognize you.

1048
01:10:26,174 --> 01:10:27,614
You've gotten old.

1049
01:10:27,854 --> 01:10:31,334
Life hasn't spared thee.
You are unrecognizable.

1050
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:34,734
As rude as usual.
Now I know it's you.

1051
01:10:34,974 --> 01:10:37,134
Cut the trollop's tongue!

1052
01:10:37,374 --> 01:10:38,454
- what?
- silence!

1053
01:10:39,014 --> 01:10:40,214
Dad!

1054
01:10:40,454 --> 01:10:41,694
You won't kiss her?

1055
01:10:44,654 --> 01:10:47,574
A girl-child!
Beautiful bastard!

1056
01:10:47,814 --> 01:10:50,774
Hube has amnesia.
You have to be patient.

1057
01:10:51,014 --> 01:10:52,214
This is Philippine.

1058
01:10:52,534 --> 01:10:54,654
The daughter you had with Cora.

1059
01:10:54,974 --> 01:10:56,254
she's your wife.

1060
01:10:57,494 --> 01:11:00,254
Belle Lippine,
you fill my heart with joy.

1061
01:11:00,494 --> 01:11:03,534
My heirs are
as pure as morning dew.

1062
01:11:03,774 --> 01:11:05,214
I've waited so long.

1063
01:11:05,574 --> 01:11:07,534
You were in Borneo?

1064
01:11:07,774 --> 01:11:10,254
Get the bastard to a nunnery!

1065
01:11:11,414 --> 01:11:13,494
what is he talking about?

1066
01:11:14,654 --> 01:11:16,094
Did we speak yesterday?

1067
01:11:18,134 --> 01:11:19,934
Yes, it's him.

1068
01:11:20,174 --> 01:11:23,414
same old top-class friends.

1069
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:26,894
Do you care about Philippine?

1070
01:11:27,454 --> 01:11:29,774
will you come to her wedding?

1071
01:11:30,014 --> 01:11:31,974
Out of the question.

1072
01:11:32,214 --> 01:11:35,414
My destiny awaits.
I leave you, heavy-hearted.

1073
01:11:35,654 --> 01:11:37,054
Oh misery!

1074
01:11:37,294 --> 01:11:38,854
Poor whore-child!

1075
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:40,454
Please, papa!

1076
01:11:40,694 --> 01:11:44,254
You overwhelm me, chaste wench,
but I must be firm.

1077
01:11:44,494 --> 01:11:47,414
My body must go,
but my soul stays with you.

1078
01:11:47,654 --> 01:11:49,574
It's sad, but that's that.

1079
01:11:49,814 --> 01:11:51,694
Come on. Your father's a pig.

1080
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:55,534
- I could cry.
- Me too. Boo-hoo...

1081
01:11:56,774 --> 01:11:59,094
why does he sound like an old book?

1082
01:11:59,334 --> 01:12:01,854
He's seeking his roots.

1083
01:12:02,894 --> 01:12:04,334
who's the other ass?

1084
01:12:04,574 --> 01:12:06,574
No idea, but they're inseparable.

1085
01:12:06,814 --> 01:12:08,294
Frightful!

1086
01:12:08,654 --> 01:12:09,974
The chariot!

1087
01:12:12,414 --> 01:12:15,014
It's the Flood! The Flood!

1088
01:12:16,734 --> 01:12:19,094
what have you done to the car?

1089
01:12:19,334 --> 01:12:21,934
It's only water!
we are men! Get in!

1090
01:12:22,214 --> 01:12:24,214
what did they do now?

1091
01:12:24,454 --> 01:12:27,374
It's the firemen! It's full of water!

1092
01:12:27,774 --> 01:12:29,614
The motor must be kaput.

1093
01:12:30,334 --> 01:12:33,054
we must find the sacred tooth.

1094
01:12:33,574 --> 01:12:35,014
How strange!

1095
01:12:35,254 --> 01:12:37,654
It's like a big fat cow's tooth.

1096
01:12:38,054 --> 01:12:40,734
why set a tooth in precious stones?

1097
01:12:41,374 --> 01:12:43,494
since we found these gems

1098
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,254
in someone's cookie jar,

1099
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:49,174
we'll go 50-50 with you,
if the price is right.

1100
01:12:49,534 --> 01:12:50,374
I see.

1101
01:12:50,614 --> 01:12:52,974
I've put your call through.

1102
01:12:55,334 --> 01:12:56,534
Mrs. de Montmirail?

1103
01:12:56,774 --> 01:12:58,094
- speaking.
- Hello.

1104
01:12:58,334 --> 01:13:01,054
I'm a pawnbroker in Bourges.
In my office

1105
01:13:01,374 --> 01:13:04,054
is a vulgar woman with jewels

1106
01:13:04,294 --> 01:13:06,454
stolen from your husband.

1107
01:13:08,374 --> 01:13:11,254
Please wait here
while I examine these

1108
01:13:11,494 --> 01:13:13,014
under a microscope.

1109
01:13:13,254 --> 01:13:14,134
Don't go far!

1110
01:13:14,374 --> 01:13:16,414
My husband's car got soaked.

1111
01:13:16,654 --> 01:13:19,654
I need spark plugs and plaid seat covers.

1112
01:13:20,054 --> 01:13:21,534
A mighty chariot!

1113
01:13:32,014 --> 01:13:34,294
where are you from?
Portugal?

1114
01:13:41,774 --> 01:13:42,694
what's that?

1115
01:13:43,134 --> 01:13:44,974
- You want a swig?
- why not?

1116
01:13:46,374 --> 01:13:47,974
Local wine?

1117
01:14:01,214 --> 01:14:02,894
It's for warriors!

1118
01:14:04,454 --> 01:14:05,374
Have more!

1119
01:14:11,294 --> 01:14:12,654
And a battery.

1120
01:14:22,614 --> 01:14:23,974
Up!

1121
01:14:24,374 --> 01:14:25,334
Down!

1122
01:14:28,854 --> 01:14:30,094
Mr. Kass!

1123
01:14:31,294 --> 01:14:33,614
Help me with the battery.

1124
01:14:38,254 --> 01:14:40,654
12 volts.
Gosh, it's heavy!

1125
01:14:42,654 --> 01:14:43,494
How much?

1126
01:14:49,214 --> 01:14:51,974
Paulo!
Careful with the tools!

1127
01:14:53,574 --> 01:14:54,614
Damned workers!

1128
01:14:55,854 --> 01:14:57,054
They break everything.

1129
01:14:57,294 --> 01:15:00,014
Finding good help
is such a chore!

1130
01:15:00,614 --> 01:15:03,814
Mr. Kass! That is not a toy!

1131
01:15:06,694 --> 01:15:08,374
what's this racket?

1132
01:15:08,614 --> 01:15:10,294
Don't make me come out!

1133
01:15:14,734 --> 01:15:15,574
Here.

1134
01:15:16,054 --> 01:15:17,414
There we go!

1135
01:15:17,654 --> 01:15:19,654
2,623. Let's just say 2,620.

1136
01:15:19,934 --> 01:15:21,814
That's swell of you.

1137
01:15:25,734 --> 01:15:27,374
Paulo, what did you do?

1138
01:15:28,494 --> 01:15:31,454
That's called a garage.
Did you enjoy it?

1139
01:15:31,814 --> 01:15:32,694
we drank!

1140
01:15:33,814 --> 01:15:35,974
Paulo is a hearty companion!

1141
01:15:36,214 --> 01:15:37,814
You made friends?

1142
01:15:38,294 --> 01:15:39,294
Good for you.

1143
01:15:39,974 --> 01:15:41,134
It's her.

1144
01:15:46,374 --> 01:15:50,214
I'm stunned.
Hube aIways liked trash,

1145
01:15:50,454 --> 01:15:52,414
but she's an insult to me.

1146
01:15:53,054 --> 01:15:55,414
- Don't you agree?
- Yes...

1147
01:15:55,814 --> 01:15:57,054
Recognize these?

1148
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:01,494
Yes. Hubert must have given them to her.

1149
01:16:03,054 --> 01:16:06,694
Please don't tell my daughter.
she worships her father.

1150
01:16:06,934 --> 01:16:09,894
My lawyer will repay you
for your kindness.

1151
01:16:10,214 --> 01:16:11,694
I wasn't asking.

1152
01:16:12,294 --> 01:16:13,934
I'm sure you weren't.

1153
01:16:18,054 --> 01:16:20,134
I'm getting cramps, gramps.

1154
01:16:20,374 --> 01:16:21,334
Get out!

1155
01:16:21,574 --> 01:16:23,214
watch your mouth, fatso!

1156
01:16:23,494 --> 01:16:26,854
Mrs. de Montmirail
kindly did not call the police.

1157
01:16:27,094 --> 01:16:28,054
But I will!

1158
01:16:28,294 --> 01:16:32,294
Give me my rocks
or I'll kick your balls off!

1159
01:16:39,174 --> 01:16:40,454
Mrs. de Montmirail?

1160
01:16:40,974 --> 01:16:42,974
- Is your cousin here?
- Yes. why?

1161
01:16:43,294 --> 01:16:45,774
Charges have been pressed
against you.

1162
01:16:46,014 --> 01:16:48,254
Follow me.
Your mechanic too.

1163
01:16:48,494 --> 01:16:50,574
- Me?
- No, he's the mechanic.

1164
01:16:52,894 --> 01:16:54,694
They're charged with locking

1165
01:16:54,934 --> 01:16:57,814
sergeant Gibbon in a cage.

1166
01:17:10,134 --> 01:17:11,574
Little Crass is back!

1167
01:17:12,054 --> 01:17:14,414
Little Crass! Little Crass!

1168
01:17:17,574 --> 01:17:20,534
I'm glad he's back too,
but don't overdo it!

1169
01:17:20,774 --> 01:17:23,694
Kiss your brother
so we can begin.

1170
01:17:23,934 --> 01:17:27,534
I don't kiss swine.
Question him, the gang leader.

1171
01:17:27,774 --> 01:17:29,854
I decide who I question.

1172
01:17:30,214 --> 01:17:33,534
- Do you know sergeant Gibbon?
- Indeed.

1173
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:37,214
He claims
you locked him up and beat him.

1174
01:17:37,454 --> 01:17:38,254
violently.

1175
01:17:38,494 --> 01:17:41,974
And made him swallow
a huge amount of psycho...

1176
01:17:42,214 --> 01:17:43,734
Psychodysleptics.

1177
01:17:43,974 --> 01:17:47,534
- Result: fainting, delirium, vomiting...
- Diarrhea.

1178
01:17:47,774 --> 01:17:50,214
Dehydration.
Right, Gibbon?

1179
01:17:50,454 --> 01:17:53,094
Right.
Right and right again!

1180
01:17:53,334 --> 01:17:55,294
He's an officer of the law.

1181
01:17:55,534 --> 01:17:57,134
so answer carefully.

1182
01:17:57,654 --> 01:18:01,854
This villain entered my room
without my permission.

1183
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:05,494
Gibbon searched your room
without a warrant?

1184
01:18:05,734 --> 01:18:06,534
Get serious!

1185
01:18:06,774 --> 01:18:10,614
If this is how you investigate,
I'll call my good friend,

1186
01:18:10,854 --> 01:18:12,174
the police chief.

1187
01:18:12,494 --> 01:18:14,214
I love thee, baby Crass!

1188
01:18:14,454 --> 01:18:17,454
Be nice, Mr. Ass.
Oops... sorry.

1189
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:18,854
Keep your cool.

1190
01:18:19,094 --> 01:18:21,494
I asked Gibbon to search his room.

1191
01:18:21,734 --> 01:18:25,574
I suspected
that he and that noxious gnome

1192
01:18:25,814 --> 01:18:27,054
were medieval!

1193
01:18:28,174 --> 01:18:29,854
He's my boy! I saved him!

1194
01:18:30,094 --> 01:18:31,694
Look!

1195
01:18:32,534 --> 01:18:35,574
Is that normal?
No, he's from the Dark Ages!

1196
01:18:36,774 --> 01:18:39,334
Cool it, Kass. I'm coming unglued.

1197
01:18:39,574 --> 01:18:42,534
And Muscle Man here
made me drink a potion

1198
01:18:42,774 --> 01:18:45,054
and I woke up in the year 1000!

1199
01:18:45,334 --> 01:18:47,814
stinky dwarves stole my gold watch!

1200
01:18:48,414 --> 01:18:51,654
I was covered with tar
and burnt at the stake!

1201
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:53,454
And then,

1202
01:18:53,694 --> 01:18:56,814
a sicko priest tortured me
with putrid water.

1203
01:18:57,054 --> 01:19:00,214
My bladder's still swollen
and I pee all over.

1204
01:19:00,454 --> 01:19:01,534
I noticed.

1205
01:19:01,774 --> 01:19:03,774
Captain! I understand!

1206
01:19:04,014 --> 01:19:06,094
Jacquart gave me the answer

1207
01:19:06,334 --> 01:19:07,694
to all my questions!

1208
01:19:08,894 --> 01:19:10,894
- The Middle Ages!
- Obviously!

1209
01:19:11,934 --> 01:19:13,894
It's obvious. Only a retard

1210
01:19:14,134 --> 01:19:16,054
couldn't figure it out!

1211
01:19:16,454 --> 01:19:19,334
They're stinking rats
from the Middle Ages!

1212
01:19:19,574 --> 01:19:23,774
Body odor is no proof
they're medieval.

1213
01:19:24,014 --> 01:19:27,174
smell our fellow officers.

1214
01:19:28,174 --> 01:19:30,774
It's the only way
it makes sense!

1215
01:19:31,014 --> 01:19:33,454
"Toil, never recoil!"

1216
01:19:33,694 --> 01:19:35,374
The Montmirail treasure.

1217
01:19:35,734 --> 01:19:38,014
It all makes sense now.
villains!

1218
01:19:38,254 --> 01:19:40,454
You're all villains!

1219
01:19:42,614 --> 01:19:45,334
I understand! It's all so clear!

1220
01:19:45,574 --> 01:19:48,614
That's enough.
spare us your circus act.

1221
01:19:50,214 --> 01:19:53,214
I was burnt at the stake.
My toe is red.

1222
01:19:53,454 --> 01:19:55,494
Am I making this up?

1223
01:19:55,734 --> 01:19:59,054
Compare my two big toes!

1224
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:01,574
Look! so?

1225
01:20:01,814 --> 01:20:02,974
sedate him.

1226
01:20:03,254 --> 01:20:05,414
You're all villains...

1227
01:20:05,654 --> 01:20:08,894
Defrocked monk habits!
Another invention?

1228
01:20:09,134 --> 01:20:11,254
Do I wear this on the town?

1229
01:20:11,494 --> 01:20:12,694
Inquisition garb!

1230
01:20:12,934 --> 01:20:14,854
They reek of wine and cheese.

1231
01:20:15,174 --> 01:20:17,254
He'll sleep for 24 hours.

1232
01:20:21,134 --> 01:20:22,574
Enough for a horse.

1233
01:20:22,814 --> 01:20:24,854
I don't want to sleep!

1234
01:20:27,254 --> 01:20:30,294
I'm sorry things got out of hand, sir.

1235
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:31,854
we'll meet on Monday.

1236
01:20:32,094 --> 01:20:34,374
Hopefully
they'll talk more sense.

1237
01:20:34,614 --> 01:20:35,934
You are a goodly man.

1238
01:20:36,174 --> 01:20:39,334
I promise not to seek revenge on them.

1239
01:20:39,574 --> 01:20:41,334
That's really smart of you.

1240
01:20:41,694 --> 01:20:42,734
God keep you.

1241
01:20:43,054 --> 01:20:46,334
Little Crass is ill.
Give him vinegar!

1242
01:20:46,574 --> 01:20:47,614
It's obvious!

1243
01:20:47,854 --> 01:20:50,414
vinegar is not the solution!

1244
01:20:50,654 --> 01:20:52,534
was your father a wino too?

1245
01:20:52,854 --> 01:20:55,974
My club-footed father
died frozen in a swamp

1246
01:20:56,214 --> 01:20:57,814
on his way to the tavern!

1247
01:20:58,414 --> 01:21:01,694
You must be the family's pride and joy.

1248
01:21:05,774 --> 01:21:08,174
Your husband's on the phone.

1249
01:21:10,814 --> 01:21:12,974
what's wrong? More trouble?

1250
01:21:13,214 --> 01:21:14,934
The bum just came back.

1251
01:21:15,174 --> 01:21:16,934
- Dame Ginette?
- Yeah, her.

1252
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:19,054
what luck!

1253
01:21:19,294 --> 01:21:21,294
she got beaten up by two women.

1254
01:21:21,534 --> 01:21:23,734
They're in pretty bad shape too!

1255
01:21:23,974 --> 01:21:24,814
I'm coming.

1256
01:21:25,054 --> 01:21:27,174
Off with her hand!

1257
01:21:28,294 --> 01:21:29,494
stop it.

1258
01:21:29,934 --> 01:21:32,094
we don't cut people here.

1259
01:21:32,334 --> 01:21:34,534
- Not the hands of thieves?
- Nothing.

1260
01:21:35,054 --> 01:21:36,214
They keep thieving.

1261
01:21:36,454 --> 01:21:39,174
It's hard to explain.
I'm out of breath.

1262
01:21:39,414 --> 01:21:40,574
There you are!

1263
01:21:41,014 --> 01:21:42,534
I haven't the time.

1264
01:21:42,774 --> 01:21:45,814
Your Portuguese gardener
pushed the button.

1265
01:21:46,054 --> 01:21:47,494
My Portuguese gardener?

1266
01:21:50,254 --> 01:21:51,694
see?

1267
01:21:52,614 --> 01:21:55,574
I see. I'll speak to my husband

1268
01:21:55,934 --> 01:21:57,174
and I'll call you.

1269
01:21:57,414 --> 01:22:00,614
Call fast!
I have to pay for a new van!

1270
01:22:05,574 --> 01:22:08,094
Not while I'm working!

1271
01:22:08,334 --> 01:22:09,814
They stole your gems!

1272
01:22:11,454 --> 01:22:13,214
what are these for?

1273
01:22:14,374 --> 01:22:18,054
It's their inquisition.
Jean-Pierre's the torturer!

1274
01:22:18,454 --> 01:22:21,254
- Come!
- Robberess!

1275
01:22:21,654 --> 01:22:22,694
You're staying?

1276
01:22:23,374 --> 01:22:25,334
- Get to work, torturer.
- what?

1277
01:22:25,574 --> 01:22:26,534
Torturer! sadist!

1278
01:22:26,774 --> 01:22:29,534
I gave you a shot.
she got in a fight.

1279
01:22:29,774 --> 01:22:31,614
Two fat pigs beat me up!

1280
01:22:31,854 --> 01:22:33,694
My jewels, bandit lady!

1281
01:22:33,934 --> 01:22:35,374
Or off with your hand!

1282
01:22:35,614 --> 01:22:37,574
sit down! settle this after!

1283
01:22:38,334 --> 01:22:39,934
Open your mouth!

1284
01:22:40,574 --> 01:22:42,774
I'll make you a nice tin tooth.

1285
01:22:43,174 --> 01:22:45,494
No way! It'll be ugly!

1286
01:22:45,734 --> 01:22:47,654
Can you afford better?

1287
01:22:48,974 --> 01:22:50,454
Close your mouth.

1288
01:22:54,774 --> 01:22:56,614
stop play-acting.

1289
01:22:59,414 --> 01:23:00,614
Rinse!

1290
01:23:00,854 --> 01:23:02,294
You hurt me!

1291
01:23:02,534 --> 01:23:04,414
A wee fountain!

1292
01:23:04,974 --> 01:23:05,894
Go away!

1293
01:23:06,174 --> 01:23:07,534
I'm no glamour girl.

1294
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:10,774
The garage owner
wants a new van.

1295
01:23:11,014 --> 01:23:13,614
Get out!
Torture is not for women's eyes!

1296
01:23:15,094 --> 01:23:17,134
These nuts are driving me crazy!

1297
01:23:17,374 --> 01:23:19,774
we need the gems, goodly Ginette.

1298
01:23:20,094 --> 01:23:22,094
Hube's chick stole them.

1299
01:23:22,494 --> 01:23:23,334
Chick?

1300
01:23:23,574 --> 01:23:26,534
"Chick" means woman.
Hube's chick is his wife.

1301
01:23:26,774 --> 01:23:29,814
- Cora.
- Let's go to Chick Cora.

1302
01:23:37,854 --> 01:23:39,454
They must be loaded!

1303
01:23:39,694 --> 01:23:41,054
The chick must bleed!

1304
01:23:41,294 --> 01:23:44,174
It's her fault I lost a tooth.

1305
01:23:44,414 --> 01:23:47,854
No one must bleed.
we'll use tact.

1306
01:23:48,654 --> 01:23:51,014
If you want your relic back,

1307
01:23:51,254 --> 01:23:52,494
you're Hube now.

1308
01:23:53,014 --> 01:23:55,574
I hate to lie,
but if I must, I can.

1309
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:01,574
Open up!

1310
01:24:01,814 --> 01:24:03,014
Relax, Mr. Kass.

1311
01:24:04,934 --> 01:24:06,774
what's this racket?

1312
01:24:07,014 --> 01:24:08,614
Hubert, why are you here?

1313
01:24:08,854 --> 01:24:11,374
I told everyone
you were busy overseas.

1314
01:24:11,614 --> 01:24:15,214
- who's this rabble?
- who pays for my tooth?

1315
01:24:15,454 --> 01:24:16,134
Later.

1316
01:24:16,374 --> 01:24:19,734
This fair Chick is mine.
seeing you soothes my eyes.

1317
01:24:20,014 --> 01:24:21,454
You are morning dew.

1318
01:24:22,054 --> 01:24:24,694
For my gems,
sweet kisses will be thine.

1319
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:26,614
I get it now.

1320
01:24:27,174 --> 01:24:29,414
Your jewels are with my lawyer.

1321
01:24:29,654 --> 01:24:30,574
Fetch them!

1322
01:24:30,814 --> 01:24:32,534
why bother him at night?

1323
01:24:32,774 --> 01:24:35,014
To make this slut happy?

1324
01:24:35,254 --> 01:24:38,174
Me, a slut?
speak for yourself, floozy!

1325
01:24:38,534 --> 01:24:42,094
The jewelry or we chop off your hand!
Floozy!

1326
01:24:42,334 --> 01:24:44,094
Cora, what's keeping you?

1327
01:24:44,574 --> 01:24:47,054
I decanted the wine. It's divine!

1328
01:24:47,334 --> 01:24:50,094
- Luigny!
- The Duke of Burgundy! Die!

1329
01:24:52,054 --> 01:24:54,414
- You're crazy!
- Crazy!

1330
01:24:54,654 --> 01:24:57,094
Be calm.
He is only Thug's heir.

1331
01:24:58,694 --> 01:25:00,614
He almost killed him!

1332
01:25:00,854 --> 01:25:04,174
Excuse him.
He is uncouth. He got scared.

1333
01:25:04,414 --> 01:25:06,454
You stormed in so violently!

1334
01:25:06,694 --> 01:25:08,214
It was like an attack.

1335
01:25:08,454 --> 01:25:10,374
I'm the one who attacked?

1336
01:25:10,734 --> 01:25:11,934
In a way.

1337
01:25:12,174 --> 01:25:16,134
Daddy, you're here!
Everyone wants to meet you.

1338
01:25:19,254 --> 01:25:24,454
Tact sucks! Tacky's better.
Let's just ask for tooth money!

1339
01:25:24,694 --> 01:25:27,934
No! we'll wait, Mrs. Kass.

1340
01:25:29,694 --> 01:25:32,134
My in-laws are dying to meet you.

1341
01:25:32,374 --> 01:25:34,574
The Lumeau-Pericards,
my father.

1342
01:25:34,814 --> 01:25:36,614
He's head of the school Board,

1343
01:25:36,854 --> 01:25:39,054
and a famous expert in history.

1344
01:25:39,574 --> 01:25:41,414
That's just... "her-story".

1345
01:25:53,094 --> 01:25:54,934
Beatrice de Montmirail.

1346
01:25:55,174 --> 01:25:56,774
- My pleasure.
- Good evening!

1347
01:25:57,014 --> 01:25:57,774
Evenin'!

1348
01:25:58,014 --> 01:25:59,494
Mr. and Mrs...

1349
01:25:59,734 --> 01:26:01,174
Kass. Hube's help.

1350
01:26:02,294 --> 01:26:03,694
They won't be dining.

1351
01:26:03,934 --> 01:26:06,574
Holy scrotums! No reveling?

1352
01:26:06,814 --> 01:26:10,454
That dickwad is named Kass.
I'm Ginette sarclay.

1353
01:26:10,694 --> 01:26:12,254
Mrs. Dickwad...

1354
01:26:13,454 --> 01:26:15,014
Unpaid help, I might add!

1355
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:16,814
My fiance, Benoit.

1356
01:26:17,054 --> 01:26:18,734
It's an honor, sir.

1357
01:26:19,894 --> 01:26:22,494
virgin boy, be vigorous!

1358
01:26:22,734 --> 01:26:24,214
On your wedding night

1359
01:26:24,814 --> 01:26:26,814
use your skills on your beloved

1360
01:26:27,054 --> 01:26:28,894
to give us a male heir.

1361
01:26:29,254 --> 01:26:30,454
How original!

1362
01:26:30,694 --> 01:26:33,374
Long live the young lovers!

1363
01:26:36,054 --> 01:26:38,094
Hube's very big on toasts.

1364
01:26:46,774 --> 01:26:48,454
Rich beverage!

1365
01:26:49,534 --> 01:26:52,614
Chick, why is Thug on Montmirail land?

1366
01:26:52,854 --> 01:26:55,734
whatever you heard
is surely exaggerated.

1367
01:26:55,974 --> 01:26:58,774
Don't justify yourself!
I beg your pardon.

1368
01:26:59,014 --> 01:27:01,134
- He acted fast!
- Philippine!

1369
01:27:01,374 --> 01:27:02,774
shut your mouth!

1370
01:27:03,014 --> 01:27:05,454
That does it! Now you die!

1371
01:27:05,694 --> 01:27:06,694
Burgundy swine!

1372
01:27:06,934 --> 01:27:09,014
Kass, drop that penknife!

1373
01:27:09,254 --> 01:27:10,734
Please, Daddy! Enough!

1374
01:27:10,974 --> 01:27:13,134
Mercy, please! Have pity!

1375
01:27:14,734 --> 01:27:15,854
Thou art lucky.

1376
01:27:17,094 --> 01:27:18,734
I'm dreadfully sorry.

1377
01:27:20,334 --> 01:27:23,574
Hubert, leave this house at once.

1378
01:27:23,814 --> 01:27:26,534
You'll have your jewels
tomorrow morning.

1379
01:27:26,774 --> 01:27:29,534
That will be that between us.

1380
01:27:29,894 --> 01:27:30,934
'Tis all I ask.

1381
01:27:31,934 --> 01:27:33,374
Horse shit!

1382
01:27:33,614 --> 01:27:36,774
I obviously won't ask you
to dine with us.

1383
01:27:37,014 --> 01:27:39,774
And lastly:
your friends are an ugly lot.

1384
01:27:41,134 --> 01:27:42,654
Bye, folks.

1385
01:27:44,014 --> 01:27:45,654
It was a pleasure.

1386
01:27:47,214 --> 01:27:50,454
Farewell,
good ladies and fair damsel.

1387
01:27:51,854 --> 01:27:52,774
very original.

1388
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:54,614
They were snippy.

1389
01:27:54,854 --> 01:27:58,374
we lacked tact,
clobbering the Duke de Luigny.

1390
01:27:58,614 --> 01:28:01,454
- He's a thief.
- A shit-eating slug!

1391
01:28:01,694 --> 01:28:03,534
Mind your manners, Mr. Kass.

1392
01:28:05,134 --> 01:28:06,854
I could eat a horse!

1393
01:28:07,094 --> 01:28:10,134
A pit stop at Pizza Hut!
I'm starving.

1394
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:17,094
Leg or breast, Kass?

1395
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:18,574
Leg!

1396
01:28:18,814 --> 01:28:21,134
Dame Ginette, white or dark?

1397
01:28:21,374 --> 01:28:22,894
whatever.

1398
01:28:24,054 --> 01:28:25,774
The rich at the table,

1399
01:28:26,014 --> 01:28:27,334
poor on the floor.

1400
01:28:27,614 --> 01:28:29,294
silence, wench.

1401
01:28:29,534 --> 01:28:31,534
Keep it down. Have some fries.

1402
01:28:34,294 --> 01:28:35,654
Fries!

1403
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:37,574
You gross me out!

1404
01:28:39,654 --> 01:28:41,534
Fries!

1405
01:28:42,654 --> 01:28:44,694
I want to eat on the floor!

1406
01:28:44,934 --> 01:28:47,094
You're a Montmirail, not a serf.

1407
01:28:47,334 --> 01:28:49,094
- Never forget it.
- Yes, sir.

1408
01:28:49,334 --> 01:28:52,094
- He's also a Goulard.
- Don't nit-pick.

1409
01:28:52,334 --> 01:28:55,334
- we deserve our share!
- Cursed jewelry!

1410
01:28:55,574 --> 01:28:58,414
It is not mine.
Jacquasse will get rubies

1411
01:28:58,654 --> 01:29:01,134
if he returns with me tomorrow.

1412
01:29:01,454 --> 01:29:03,494
I won't go! I'll flee!

1413
01:29:03,734 --> 01:29:07,254
Don't be an idiot!
You don't like rubies?

1414
01:29:07,494 --> 01:29:08,894
would you go?

1415
01:29:09,134 --> 01:29:11,174
Good idea! You'll all go

1416
01:29:11,414 --> 01:29:14,374
tomorrow
and life will return to normal.

1417
01:29:14,694 --> 01:29:15,654
Good riddance!

1418
01:29:26,934 --> 01:29:29,174
Madame is expecting you.

1419
01:29:29,654 --> 01:29:30,654
I'll wait here.

1420
01:29:37,214 --> 01:29:38,134
what an outfit!

1421
01:29:38,654 --> 01:29:40,014
Hurry, woman.

1422
01:29:40,254 --> 01:29:41,934
They're all there. Check.

1423
01:29:43,774 --> 01:29:45,134
The sacred Tooth.

1424
01:29:45,614 --> 01:29:46,654
sweet Cora...

1425
01:29:46,894 --> 01:29:48,694
spare me your hypocrisy.

1426
01:29:48,934 --> 01:29:51,974
I'm not thrilled
to have you for the wedding

1427
01:29:52,214 --> 01:29:54,734
but Philippine would love it.

1428
01:29:58,574 --> 01:30:00,494
I hate thee not, Corrosive Cora.

1429
01:30:04,694 --> 01:30:06,614
Nor do I hate thee, Hubert.

1430
01:30:08,974 --> 01:30:10,734
- Get the tooth?
- Indeed!

1431
01:30:11,374 --> 01:30:16,054
we'll go home, make hot cocoa and...
it's travel time!

1432
01:30:16,294 --> 01:30:18,374
The Corridors must shut at once.

1433
01:30:18,774 --> 01:30:20,014
Daddy!

1434
01:30:20,574 --> 01:30:22,334
- wait at the chariot!
- No time!

1435
01:30:22,574 --> 01:30:23,614
wait in silence!

1436
01:30:23,854 --> 01:30:27,414
I see.
If that's how you want it...

1437
01:30:28,174 --> 01:30:30,974
- You get the goods?
- wait in silence!

1438
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:34,574
You're not staying?

1439
01:30:35,374 --> 01:30:38,254
My heart is in tears,
but I cannot remain.

1440
01:30:38,494 --> 01:30:39,734
Today, of all days.

1441
01:30:40,054 --> 01:30:41,454
You're here, so stay.

1442
01:30:41,694 --> 01:30:45,774
I am not your father.
I must embark on a great journey home.

1443
01:30:46,014 --> 01:30:48,014
who are you, if not my father?

1444
01:30:48,254 --> 01:30:49,614
You look like him.

1445
01:30:49,854 --> 01:30:53,054
I am an ancestor,
but I feel for you like a father.

1446
01:30:53,294 --> 01:30:56,534
It hurt so much to be fatherless.

1447
01:30:57,614 --> 01:30:59,974
Take his place today. For me.

1448
01:31:02,294 --> 01:31:03,974
You know not what you ask.

1449
01:31:04,214 --> 01:31:05,574
when I saw you,

1450
01:31:05,814 --> 01:31:10,174
I was so moved.
so proud to introduce you to them.

1451
01:31:10,414 --> 01:31:11,894
Don't steal my happiness.

1452
01:31:12,214 --> 01:31:16,014
say you love me and you'll stay,
whoever you are.

1453
01:31:16,654 --> 01:31:18,454
Lord, what will then happen

1454
01:31:18,694 --> 01:31:20,014
to my father-in-law?

1455
01:31:20,254 --> 01:31:21,374
Please say yes.

1456
01:31:22,254 --> 01:31:22,934
Please.

1457
01:31:23,294 --> 01:31:25,934
I love you my great,
great, great grandchild.

1458
01:31:26,174 --> 01:31:29,334
I'll lead you to the altar.
I swear on my sword.

1459
01:31:31,494 --> 01:31:34,654
- I'm proud to be your kin.
- Me too.

1460
01:31:38,214 --> 01:31:41,534
- They take tradition seriously.
- Are those family arms?

1461
01:31:43,054 --> 01:31:44,654
why must she wear that?

1462
01:31:45,094 --> 01:31:47,654
He said he'll take it back.

1463
01:31:54,454 --> 01:31:56,614
It smells like cheese in here.

1464
01:31:57,414 --> 01:31:58,894
Feet.

1465
01:32:00,454 --> 01:32:02,334
Dirty feet, honey.

1466
01:32:23,734 --> 01:32:25,894
where is The Crass? we must go!

1467
01:32:26,134 --> 01:32:27,254
I'll make cocoa.

1468
01:32:27,974 --> 01:32:31,214
Child! Those things are done,
but never spoken!

1469
01:32:31,494 --> 01:32:32,494
It's a secret.

1470
01:32:38,974 --> 01:32:41,334
Keep a look-out, Daddy-o!

1471
01:32:44,814 --> 01:32:46,534
Beauteous finery!

1472
01:32:46,774 --> 01:32:49,094
what's that?
It'll give us away!

1473
01:32:49,334 --> 01:32:52,014
such choice fabric! with gold!

1474
01:32:52,774 --> 01:32:55,294
You got the servant bug
up your ass!

1475
01:32:56,614 --> 01:32:59,054
Have you any powdered cocoa?

1476
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:02,174
I need something
or it tastes like glue.

1477
01:33:02,454 --> 01:33:04,934
The Kasses will never swallow it.

1478
01:33:05,174 --> 01:33:07,454
Do you mind if I have a look?

1479
01:33:07,694 --> 01:33:09,854
I'm Bea, Cora's cousin.

1480
01:33:18,294 --> 01:33:20,894
I'll be in Bimbo-bo's car.
Get the keys!

1481
01:33:21,174 --> 01:33:22,534
Provender!

1482
01:33:33,174 --> 01:33:34,854
Lush fish!

1483
01:33:38,974 --> 01:33:40,934
- Forgive me, sire!
- It's nothing.

1484
01:33:41,174 --> 01:33:44,214
I know you.
Jacquart's brother! How are you?

1485
01:33:44,454 --> 01:33:46,214
Finely, Marshal! Finely!

1486
01:33:46,894 --> 01:33:49,174
Parking cars for the reception?

1487
01:33:49,614 --> 01:33:51,094
Thank you, good sire!

1488
01:33:55,094 --> 01:33:56,374
Poor guy.

1489
01:34:16,374 --> 01:34:18,534
Oddly enough,
it's a magic potion.

1490
01:34:18,974 --> 01:34:20,214
You couldn't understand.

1491
01:34:26,734 --> 01:34:29,014
Chicklet, have you seen my squire?

1492
01:34:29,254 --> 01:34:30,374
No, Hubert.

1493
01:34:30,614 --> 01:34:32,574
The villain is hiding!

1494
01:34:41,694 --> 01:34:43,934
Can I wash my hands?

1495
01:34:49,774 --> 01:34:50,494
Here I am!

1496
01:34:51,134 --> 01:34:52,694
what's that?

1497
01:34:52,934 --> 01:34:55,174
A savory fish,
fresh and toothsome!

1498
01:34:55,454 --> 01:34:57,854
we can't eat it off the car!

1499
01:34:58,094 --> 01:35:00,214
Did you get the bitch's keys?

1500
01:35:00,454 --> 01:35:02,534
Go back, dummy! Make up a lie

1501
01:35:02,774 --> 01:35:06,494
to get the keys.
Meanwhile, I'll guard the silver.

1502
01:35:06,894 --> 01:35:08,414
- The key!
- Yeah!

1503
01:35:33,094 --> 01:35:34,814
More bass.

1504
01:35:36,574 --> 01:35:39,294
Crank up the reverb.
Damned reverb...

1505
01:35:43,454 --> 01:35:45,094
Take five.

1506
01:35:45,374 --> 01:35:48,334
Coffee break.
Then we sing our lungs out.

1507
01:35:48,574 --> 01:35:50,134
Let's go, girls.

1508
01:36:11,734 --> 01:36:13,094
Down with Burgundy!

1509
01:36:13,334 --> 01:36:15,294
And we'll rip off his stalk

1510
01:36:15,534 --> 01:36:18,534
as we did the Duke of York,

1511
01:36:18,774 --> 01:36:20,894
amid his shrieks and howls.

1512
01:36:21,134 --> 01:36:24,774
we strung him up!
with his bowels!

1513
01:36:26,014 --> 01:36:26,894
what's that?

1514
01:36:27,334 --> 01:36:29,094
The band is tuning up.

1515
01:36:39,854 --> 01:36:42,494
some wise-ass
is using our equipment.

1516
01:36:44,734 --> 01:36:46,774
- How indiscreet!
- It's trendy.

1517
01:37:00,574 --> 01:37:01,414
Jacquasse!

1518
01:37:12,334 --> 01:37:13,574
Louis the Fat!

1519
01:37:14,054 --> 01:37:15,574
Godefroy!

1520
01:37:22,934 --> 01:37:26,774
wise guy, drop the mike!
It's for pros and it's expensive.

1521
01:37:27,134 --> 01:37:30,694
Aye, troubadour.
Gladden us with dulcet melodies.

1522
01:37:30,934 --> 01:37:32,454
He's sick! 4000 francs!

1523
01:37:32,694 --> 01:37:34,334
Mr. Kass!

1524
01:37:35,174 --> 01:37:38,054
Lady Beatrice!
Dame Ginette wants you!

1525
01:37:38,454 --> 01:37:40,774
she wants... the key!

1526
01:37:41,294 --> 01:37:43,254
Yes, fine. In the meantime,

1527
01:37:43,694 --> 01:37:46,894
taste this yummy souplette.

1528
01:37:52,974 --> 01:37:56,534
It's chalky! It's tasteless!
I'll spew my phlegm!

1529
01:37:56,774 --> 01:37:57,854
You're so picky.

1530
01:37:58,614 --> 01:38:00,494
Don't move. I'll be back.

1531
01:38:00,734 --> 01:38:02,414
I await... the key!

1532
01:38:02,654 --> 01:38:04,574
Of course. The key.

1533
01:38:28,254 --> 01:38:30,014
what's that noise?

1534
01:38:47,774 --> 01:38:50,694
- Not dancing?
- with you, I'd be honored.

1535
01:38:54,374 --> 01:38:56,534
Me too, but... Excuse me.

1536
01:38:56,774 --> 01:38:57,694
Maybe later.

1537
01:39:39,574 --> 01:39:40,734
Lovely bride!

1538
01:40:24,614 --> 01:40:26,574
Leave the minstrels!

1539
01:40:35,814 --> 01:40:36,854
what's wrong?

1540
01:40:42,774 --> 01:40:43,894
It's going down!

1541
01:40:44,214 --> 01:40:46,294
I'm sorry. someone pushed me.

1542
01:40:46,534 --> 01:40:47,734
It's slipping down.

1543
01:41:03,974 --> 01:41:07,174
Grand Marnier!
If it's good for crepes suzette,

1544
01:41:07,414 --> 01:41:08,814
it's good for them.

1545
01:41:14,894 --> 01:41:16,254
No deliveries here.

1546
01:41:16,494 --> 01:41:20,374
Do I look like a delivery boy?
I own the Montmirail Hotel!

1547
01:41:20,854 --> 01:41:23,774
I came to see Captain Batardet.
He's here.

1548
01:41:25,214 --> 01:41:28,014
Captain, at last.
I was in the Middle Ages!

1549
01:41:28,334 --> 01:41:30,854
I have proof! I have proof!

1550
01:41:31,094 --> 01:41:32,254
- who's he?
- Jacquart.

1551
01:41:32,494 --> 01:41:33,734
The mechanic's brother.

1552
01:41:35,374 --> 01:41:36,934
- Read this.
- what is it?

1553
01:41:37,174 --> 01:41:39,614
A doctor's prescription. For scabies!

1554
01:41:40,214 --> 01:41:43,334
I have scabies!
The worst case of it in years!

1555
01:41:43,574 --> 01:41:45,574
- It's contagious!
- Terribly so.

1556
01:41:45,814 --> 01:41:47,294
I had to show you.

1557
01:41:47,534 --> 01:41:49,254
Glorious family!

1558
01:41:49,494 --> 01:41:50,854
show him out, Captain.

1559
01:41:51,094 --> 01:41:53,374
Avoid rubbing against the guests.

1560
01:41:53,614 --> 01:41:55,214
I'm no dermatologist.

1561
01:41:55,534 --> 01:41:57,334
where did I catch it?

1562
01:41:57,574 --> 01:42:00,214
Tell me where? In a damp dungeon!

1563
01:42:00,454 --> 01:42:02,374
In the Middle Ages!

1564
01:42:02,614 --> 01:42:05,134
I caught it
from Prosper the Manure Man!

1565
01:42:05,374 --> 01:42:07,614
- who?
- Prosper the Manure Man!

1566
01:42:08,254 --> 01:42:10,014
- You don't believe me?
- I do!

1567
01:42:10,254 --> 01:42:11,814
I'm a cleanliness freak!

1568
01:42:12,054 --> 01:42:14,374
There's no scabies in my hotel!

1569
01:42:14,614 --> 01:42:16,414
Go home, take your medicine

1570
01:42:16,814 --> 01:42:19,134
and everything will be fine.

1571
01:42:19,454 --> 01:42:20,854
Arrest Montmirail!

1572
01:42:21,094 --> 01:42:22,454
Let go of me!

1573
01:42:22,694 --> 01:42:24,454
I think you're a phony cop!

1574
01:42:24,694 --> 01:42:26,614
Have you seen your hat?

1575
01:42:30,894 --> 01:42:32,694
Drink or die by my sword!

1576
01:42:32,934 --> 01:42:34,294
show pity, sire!

1577
01:42:34,534 --> 01:42:36,614
Your lot is to furbish my arms

1578
01:42:36,854 --> 01:42:38,494
and to fight for my glory!

1579
01:42:38,734 --> 01:42:42,014
Mine is a life of peril and labor!

1580
01:42:42,254 --> 01:42:44,134
I spend it in mud,

1581
01:42:44,374 --> 01:42:48,374
trampled by horses and crushed by arms.

1582
01:42:48,614 --> 01:42:51,574
I loved serving you.
You are noble and brave,

1583
01:42:52,014 --> 01:42:54,694
but I'd rather be killed
than go back.

1584
01:42:55,694 --> 01:43:00,294
stand back,
or I'll cut my own throat!

1585
01:43:00,974 --> 01:43:03,054
so be it. I'll not have you die.

1586
01:43:03,574 --> 01:43:07,694
God forgive me for being weak.
I am moved by your pleas.

1587
01:43:09,054 --> 01:43:09,934
You may stay.

1588
01:43:13,334 --> 01:43:14,894
sire!

1589
01:43:15,134 --> 01:43:17,294
Can you really mean it?

1590
01:43:22,734 --> 01:43:23,854
Pig droppings!

1591
01:43:24,254 --> 01:43:25,254
Here you are.

1592
01:43:25,734 --> 01:43:29,934
Taste this souplette.
You'll love it, Mr. Kass.

1593
01:43:30,174 --> 01:43:31,814
It's nice and strong.

1594
01:43:32,054 --> 01:43:34,654
To you, Crass.
Long life with Ginette!

1595
01:43:34,894 --> 01:43:37,694
To your glory, sire.
And to your heirs!

1596
01:43:39,254 --> 01:43:41,454
You are a saintly man.

1597
01:43:44,894 --> 01:43:46,494
A spicy souplette, child.

1598
01:43:46,814 --> 01:43:49,094
A burly broth!

1599
01:43:49,334 --> 01:43:51,774
I really think I pulled it off.

1600
01:43:52,014 --> 01:43:54,494
wait for the spell.
I'll get Ginette.

1601
01:43:54,734 --> 01:43:56,374
"Per Horus etc... "

1602
01:43:58,574 --> 01:44:00,014
I must go, Jacquasse,

1603
01:44:00,294 --> 01:44:02,214
before Philippine sees me.

1604
01:44:03,174 --> 01:44:04,254
Farewell, sire.

1605
01:44:13,774 --> 01:44:15,374
where's Jacquasse?

1606
01:44:17,734 --> 01:44:19,094
Hark! Dame Ginette!

1607
01:44:19,334 --> 01:44:21,534
Your friends loved my souplette.

1608
01:44:21,774 --> 01:44:22,934
Burly broth!

1609
01:44:23,174 --> 01:44:26,534
Drink it,
then Godefroy can say the spell.

1610
01:44:28,254 --> 01:44:30,654
It's pure garlic! Make me puke!

1611
01:44:30,894 --> 01:44:33,614
I'll never drink it!
The nerve of you!

1612
01:44:33,854 --> 01:44:37,014
Dame Ginette!
Look what you've done!

1613
01:44:37,534 --> 01:44:40,454
Leave or I'll throw you out!

1614
01:44:40,694 --> 01:44:42,054
Hey, Jacquart!

1615
01:44:42,414 --> 01:44:44,454
she's medieval too!

1616
01:44:44,694 --> 01:44:45,734
It's Kass's wife!

1617
01:44:45,974 --> 01:44:47,054
Of course.

1618
01:44:47,294 --> 01:44:48,494
Ask for her papers!

1619
01:44:48,734 --> 01:44:50,694
Excuse me, ma'am.

1620
01:44:53,734 --> 01:44:54,574
Me?

1621
01:44:55,334 --> 01:44:59,054
show me your papers
to calm him down.

1622
01:44:59,374 --> 01:45:00,894
I'm innocent!

1623
01:45:02,974 --> 01:45:05,334
Ginette sarclay.
Call that medieval?

1624
01:45:08,614 --> 01:45:09,734
sorry, ma'am.

1625
01:45:09,974 --> 01:45:11,014
Can I go?

1626
01:45:12,894 --> 01:45:14,334
If she's from now,

1627
01:45:14,574 --> 01:45:16,494
where was I? where?

1628
01:45:16,734 --> 01:45:18,614
where was I?

1629
01:45:22,814 --> 01:45:25,054
You'll give me scabies, dirty wino!

1630
01:45:26,854 --> 01:45:28,454
Answer me!

1631
01:45:34,134 --> 01:45:36,254
I need to see the magician!

1632
01:45:37,134 --> 01:45:39,454
Dame Ginette threw away her potion.

1633
01:45:39,694 --> 01:45:42,174
she doesn't like Grand Marnier.

1634
01:45:42,414 --> 01:45:44,054
she used Grand Marnier?

1635
01:45:44,294 --> 01:45:46,334
- Grand Marnier?
- Mistake?

1636
01:45:47,574 --> 01:45:49,694
This is a catastrophe.

1637
01:46:07,174 --> 01:46:09,774
sire! sire! wake up!

1638
01:46:10,254 --> 01:46:11,734
I'm here, sire.

1639
01:46:11,974 --> 01:46:14,814
I'm here! Calamitas!

1640
01:46:15,054 --> 01:46:17,094
we're still here. The magician

1641
01:46:17,334 --> 01:46:18,774
fouled up again.

1642
01:46:19,374 --> 01:46:20,454
Kill them!

1643
01:46:21,254 --> 01:46:23,294
what is this clamor?

1644
01:46:24,574 --> 01:46:26,934
who are those rascals?

1645
01:46:31,054 --> 01:46:32,734
My sword will calm them!

1646
01:46:33,534 --> 01:46:34,574
The cellar!

1647
01:46:34,814 --> 01:46:37,054
we can't hold them back for long!

1648
01:46:37,574 --> 01:46:39,374
You two! Take the trunks.

1649
01:46:39,614 --> 01:46:41,934
we'll find the Brunswick Army.

1650
01:46:42,174 --> 01:46:43,654
Hurry!

1651
01:46:43,894 --> 01:46:45,214
They're coming!

1652
01:46:45,454 --> 01:46:47,014
The door gave way!

1653
01:46:49,054 --> 01:46:51,774
The door gave way, sire!

1654
01:47:00,174 --> 01:47:01,774
what cursed age is this?

1655
01:47:02,014 --> 01:47:03,654
It's black magic!

1656
01:47:19,854 --> 01:47:22,974
who are these hordes?

1657
01:47:26,094 --> 01:47:27,174
Hey you!

1658
01:47:27,854 --> 01:47:30,694
Come join the Revolution!

1659
01:47:34,774 --> 01:47:36,214
Come, citizens!

1660
01:47:38,374 --> 01:47:40,214
He is an aristocrat!

1661
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:42,894
A Crusader!
His friend is English!

1662
01:47:43,294 --> 01:47:45,214
Hands up or I'll shoot!

1663
01:47:45,454 --> 01:47:46,294
You'll die!

1664
01:47:46,534 --> 01:47:47,854
Toil, never recoil!

1665
01:48:01,334 --> 01:48:03,094
Don't shoot those spies!

1666
01:48:07,614 --> 01:48:10,934
I'll question them,
then the guillotine.

1667
01:48:12,294 --> 01:48:13,694
Come, Jacquouillet!

1668
01:48:13,934 --> 01:48:15,454
Hoche awaits my orders.

1669
01:48:15,694 --> 01:48:17,254
Yes, Bonaparte.

1670
01:48:24,814 --> 01:48:26,614
- who are they?
- Bonaparte

1671
01:48:27,214 --> 01:48:29,414
and Jacquouillet, the prosecutor.

1672
01:48:31,294 --> 01:48:32,454
Peasants!

1673
01:48:36,534 --> 01:48:39,654
Jacquasse,
be kindly to Jacquouillet.

1674
01:48:42,254 --> 01:48:44,174
Jacquouillet? He is a skunk!

1675
01:48:44,414 --> 01:48:45,574
He is your cousin!

1676
01:48:45,814 --> 01:48:47,254
My cousin?

1677
01:48:48,934 --> 01:48:50,494
Hail, cousin!

1678
01:48:51,854 --> 01:48:54,934
My cousin! Hail little Crass!
