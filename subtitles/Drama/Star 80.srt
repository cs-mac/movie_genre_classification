1
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,499
When the editor of <i>Playboy</i>

2
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,002
told me I'd won
"Playmate of the year,"

3
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:41,002
the first thing out of my
mouth was, "are you sure?"

4
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:43,504
Did your brother

5
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:44,505
mind you being in the magazine?

6
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:46,509
I think, uh, my brother
was a little shy

7
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:48,010
because he has friends

8
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,512
who are 18 years old,
17 years old, who said,

9
00:00:50,513 --> 00:00:54,015
you know,"hey,
your sister's in <i>Playboy."</i>

10
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,515
But his friends...

11
00:00:55,516 --> 00:00:58,018
Well, I remember when I came
home to visit the family

12
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:00,520
and they came over
and they said,

13
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:02,520
"I couldn't believe it.
We saw you in <i>Playboy,"</i>

14
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,523
and they said,
"How'd you get in?"

15
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:06,025
And, "it's so wonderful."

16
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:08,027
And then he started thinking
that, you know, that...

17
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:11,029
That is pretty neat.
You know, my sister...

18
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,033
<i>Playboy's</i> motto is
"The girl next door."

19
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:17,034
They look for girls

20
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,037
that are wholesome and
fresh and young and naive,

21
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,038
they look for all of that.

22
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,540
So most of those girls do, uh,

23
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,041
have that type of background.

24
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:29,045
It took me 5 months to shoot
my Playmate-of-the-year layout.

25
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:32,547
I shot over 20,000 pictures.
It's perfection.

26
00:01:32,548 --> 00:01:35,551
They don't go for just,
uh, great nude shots.

27
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:38,053
They go for art. Perfect art.

28
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:40,054
And I'm proud of that.

29
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:43,557
And, um, um,
I'm happy to share that

30
00:01:43,558 --> 00:01:45,059
with somebody
who can appreciate it.

31
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,559
Would you like
to be just like your sister

32
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,562
when you grow up?

33
00:01:48,563 --> 00:01:49,562
Yeah.

34
00:01:49,563 --> 00:01:50,562
Why?

35
00:01:50,563 --> 00:01:52,564
Because I'm proud of her.

36
00:04:06,148 --> 00:04:08,148
Hi. How are you?

37
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:10,651
Hello.

38
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:11,653
Paul Snider.

39
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:15,154
Yeah, I'm Paul Snider.

40
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,157
How are you doing?

41
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,159
Snider.

42
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,161
Paul.

43
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,163
Hello.

44
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,166
Ha, ha, yeah.

45
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,168
Paul Snider.

46
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,171
Ah, fuck you.

47
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:36,173
Fuck you all, bastards.

48
00:04:36,174 --> 00:04:38,675
He seemed a little
pissed off at something.

49
00:04:38,676 --> 00:04:40,677
What, I don't know.

50
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:43,178
But not a bad guy.
He's a good tipper.

51
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:45,681
How'd he make his money?

52
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:47,683
All sorts of ways.

53
00:04:47,684 --> 00:04:49,686
He did something for
me here at the club,

54
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,687
a cockamamie idea.

55
00:04:51,688 --> 00:04:55,189
He was always promoting
some cockamamie idea.

56
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,191
What kind of idea was this?

57
00:04:57,192 --> 00:04:59,192
A wet t-shirt contest
using all-local talent.

58
00:04:59,193 --> 00:05:00,194
All right, Milly.

59
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:02,195
Oh, Milly!

60
00:05:02,196 --> 00:05:04,196
There she goes.
All right, Milly!

61
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:06,198
Come on out. Really
show them what you've got!

62
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,701
Milly is Vancouver's
own Dolly parton.

63
00:05:08,702 --> 00:05:10,202
Thank you, sweetheart.

64
00:05:10,203 --> 00:05:13,206
And here comes number four.
It's lovely pat.

65
00:05:13,207 --> 00:05:14,706
All right.

66
00:05:14,707 --> 00:05:16,707
Just step right up
on the runway.

67
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:17,710
There she goes.

68
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:19,711
Watch her go. Whoa!

69
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:21,714
We're all getting wet.
Look at that head go.

70
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:25,716
Look at that head go!
There she is.

71
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:27,217
Whoa, baby.

72
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:28,719
All right.

73
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
Whoa!

74
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,322
Not much difference,
is there, guys, huh?

75
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:33,724
Good sport.

76
00:05:34,224 --> 00:05:35,225
Come on, give her
a nice round of applause.

77
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:38,226
All right, here comes jeri.

78
00:05:38,227 --> 00:05:39,627
All right,
let's get another one in.

79
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:40,728
Come on, there, get in there.

80
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:42,229
We've got 2, 2 just like that.

81
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,732
Now give me 3. Come on,
Milly, get in there.

82
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,734
3 for the price of one.

83
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:49,738
Paul cleared
almost $900 for himself.

84
00:05:50,238 --> 00:05:52,238
Pretty good, I thought.

85
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:53,740
You should have
raised your minimum.

86
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:55,242
You should have advertised.

87
00:05:55,243 --> 00:05:57,243
You blew it, man.

88
00:05:57,244 --> 00:06:00,746
You blew it because
you're too cheap.

89
00:06:00,747 --> 00:06:02,248
Tomorrow, Mac.

90
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,250
He wasn't always easy to take.

91
00:06:06,251 --> 00:06:08,251
How else did he make his money?

92
00:06:08,252 --> 00:06:10,255
Oh, Jesus. He'd try anything.

93
00:06:10,256 --> 00:06:11,756
He pimped...

94
00:06:11,757 --> 00:06:13,257
Did you say pimped?

95
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:16,259
Did I say that?
Did I say pimped?

96
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,261
Yeah, I guess I did.

97
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:20,764
With a couple of girls,
at least that's what I heard.

98
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:21,764
Oh, yeah,

99
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:24,265
he had something to do
with those big auto shows.

100
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:26,769
He supplied them with
hostesses, models, something.

101
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,270
Had the hots for cars,

102
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:31,272
cars and girls, girls and cars!

103
00:06:31,273 --> 00:06:32,774
Yet one thing about
that little cocker,

104
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:35,276
he could remember
everybody's name

105
00:06:35,277 --> 00:06:37,778
if he just met 'em
or met 'em 5 years ago.

106
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,781
He always remembered the name.

107
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:43,283
Now, I admire that.
It's a real gift.

108
00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:44,784
A real gift.

109
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:57,413
They seem like really nice guys.

110
00:06:57,914 --> 00:06:59,914
Al is from racine. Ford.

111
00:06:59,915 --> 00:07:01,917
And Harry and Bob
are from Seattle.

112
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,418
Oldsmobile.

113
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:05,920
I feel funny.

114
00:07:05,921 --> 00:07:08,421
It's just dinner
and some laughs.

115
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:09,923
That's it?

116
00:07:09,924 --> 00:07:11,423
I'll talk to them again.

117
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:12,926
They're really nice guys.

118
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:14,427
They'll tell me straight.

119
00:07:14,428 --> 00:07:16,428
If they expect more...

120
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:18,430
Some guys would...

121
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:20,932
If they expect more,
then it's off, ok?

122
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:22,934
It's off.

123
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:25,436
I am not fucking
for money, Paul.

124
00:07:25,437 --> 00:07:27,438
She's not, but I am.

125
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,440
Ha ha ha ha!

126
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:33,443
Look, let me talk to them again

127
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:35,945
to get it straightened out.

128
00:07:35,946 --> 00:07:39,449
He's a cheap hustler.
He even looks pimpish.

129
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,952
Why she wants to marry him?

130
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:44,451
Some kind of loyalty, I guess.

131
00:07:44,452 --> 00:07:46,453
Get some of our people
to call Vancouver,

132
00:07:46,454 --> 00:07:48,455
check him out,
see if there's anything.

133
00:07:48,456 --> 00:07:50,457
Last name Snider, S-N-I-D-E-R.

134
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,959
First given, Paul,
second given, Leslie.

135
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,961
Yeah, I know him.

136
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:55,463
Small-timer.
Kind of a joke, really.

137
00:07:55,964 --> 00:07:57,465
Always trying something.
Always in trouble.

138
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:59,466
The loan sharks, mostly.

139
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:04,470
Jeez, this isn't funny, man!

140
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:07,473
I... I... I'm getting s-sick.

141
00:08:07,974 --> 00:08:09,976
Let me up. I'm getting sick.

142
00:08:22,486 --> 00:08:24,487
Look at my suit.

143
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:26,990
That's a $400 suit.

144
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:29,492
That wasn't funny, man.

145
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:31,995
I mean, let's be
civilized, huh, man?

146
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:33,996
Oh, shit!

147
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:37,999
That was dangerous,
very dangerous.

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,001
And humiliating.

149
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:41,503
Please, Snider!

150
00:08:43,004 --> 00:08:44,504
Do yourself a favor.

151
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:46,006
Don't say any more, please.

152
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:50,011
7 points is too much, man.

153
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:54,013
You shouldn't
humiliate me, Charlie.

154
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:58,016
Here we go again.

155
00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:01,518
Charlie. Come on, Charlie.
Please, Charlie.

156
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,521
Please, Charlie.

157
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:06,023
Charlie, you bastard!

158
00:09:06,024 --> 00:09:09,526
You smart bastards,
everybody kissing your ass.

159
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:12,029
Everybody down on
their fucking knees!

160
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,530
Well...

161
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:18,034
Not me. I don't
kiss ass for nobody.

162
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:20,035
You're not gonna forget me.

163
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:23,538
You rotten fuckers,
you tried to kill me.

164
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:25,539
I found her, you didn't.

165
00:09:26,543 --> 00:09:28,075
I found her.

166
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:30,545
I was working in this
Dairy Queen part-time

167
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:32,546
while I went to high school,

168
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:34,547
and one day this
gentleman walked in

169
00:09:34,548 --> 00:09:36,049
with this gorgeous blonde.

170
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,550
She had a fur coat on.

171
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:39,052
They both had fur coats on.

172
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:41,054
And I had this ponytail

173
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:43,555
and this little smock on.

174
00:09:43,556 --> 00:09:45,556
And I said, "can I help you?"

175
00:09:45,557 --> 00:09:48,060
And he said, "well,
what's your name?"

176
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:51,562
Ha. Well, what's your name?

177
00:09:51,563 --> 00:09:53,564
Dorothy. Can I help you?

178
00:09:53,565 --> 00:09:55,066
You're beautiful.

179
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:56,568
Me?

180
00:09:57,068 --> 00:09:58,567
May I take your order now?

181
00:09:58,568 --> 00:10:01,071
I'll have something sweet,
soft, and white.

182
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:02,573
You.

183
00:10:03,074 --> 00:10:05,574
Will you please
take their order?

184
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:07,576
Jesus, Paul!

185
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:10,579
She's really beautiful.

186
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,080
She's a baby.

187
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:13,580
Get them while
they're young, right?

188
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:15,083
I'll have a banana split...

189
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,602
God, I didn't go out
with boys very much.

190
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,603
I was very straight.

191
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:42,106
Uh, I couldn't talk
to people easily.

192
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:53,617
So, when do you
get out of school?

193
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,120
June, I hope.

194
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,125
Do you like the car?

195
00:11:06,628 --> 00:11:09,630
Well, one day you'll
have a better one.

196
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:11,631
A Mercedes, maybe.

197
00:11:11,632 --> 00:11:13,133
They're hot.

Excuse me, sir.

206
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:03,178
The management has asked
me to speak to you.

207
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:04,677
Your fly is open,

208
00:12:04,678 --> 00:12:07,180
and the whole restaurant
can see your dong.

209
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:13,185
Someone waiting on me.

210
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:15,188
That's new.

211
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,690
It's very nice here.

212
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:21,693
If you like Italian food,

213
00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:24,696
I know a real knockout place.

214
00:12:26,197 --> 00:12:28,699
I'll take you tomorrow night.

215
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:33,702
I like pizza.

216
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:36,705
Well, this is northern
Italian, 3 stars.

217
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:39,208
I know the maitre d'.

218
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:41,210
Oh.

219
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:51,218
Is there something wrong
with me? I probably

220
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:53,721
have a piece of lettuce
on my nose or something.

221
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:55,722
No, no, no, no.

222
00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:57,224
It's just the light.

223
00:12:57,724 --> 00:12:59,724
The way the light
catches your eyes.

224
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:01,728
Oh. You're an expert,
aren't you?

225
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:03,729
Expert at what?

226
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:06,732
Oh.

227
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:10,234
I found this in the coleslaw

228
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:12,236
at the salad bar.

229
00:13:12,237 --> 00:13:14,739
It's got your name is on it.

230
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:18,742
It's not the Mercedes.

231
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:20,744
Is this a joke?

232
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:31,253
It's a real topaz,

233
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:33,254
2 carats.

234
00:13:33,255 --> 00:13:35,257
It's beautiful.

235
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:39,477
Well, here's this teenager
in a town in Canada

236
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:41,979
working in a tasty freeze
or a dairy queen,

237
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,480
et cetera, whatever,

238
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:46,483
and this, uh...

239
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:49,485
Street-wise guy...

240
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:51,487
Yeah, I suppose initially,

241
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:54,491
he would have some flashy
appeal for her, yeah.

242
00:13:54,492 --> 00:13:57,492

Well, that's enough of that.

251
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:26,517
I don't think I'm any threat
to Paul McCartney, do you?

252
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:29,020
This is pretty.

253
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:32,021
I made it,

254
00:14:32,022 --> 00:14:34,023
tried to sell them.

255
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:37,026
Must have been hard to do.

256
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:47,034
Something like this must
be really hard to do.

257
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:49,537
It's so pretty.

258
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:51,540
I'm a little high.

259
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:56,543
Your hand is shaking.

260
00:14:56,544 --> 00:14:58,546
Oh, and big.

261
00:15:00,047 --> 00:15:02,047
I have the biggest hands.

262
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:04,550
I never wanted to hold
hands with any boys,

263
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:07,554
'cause my hands were
always bigger than his.

264
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:17,562
I don't think I'm any good,

265
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:20,064
you know what I mean?

266
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:24,567
I have a feeling I'm no good.

267
00:15:27,571 --> 00:15:29,071
I'm the first?

268
00:15:29,072 --> 00:15:32,574
Well, there was
this football player.

269
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:34,076
What else?

270
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:37,579
Oh, it was plain awful.

271
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,079
He was so rough,

272
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,081
and it was all over so fast.

273
00:15:41,082 --> 00:15:44,084
Wham-bam-thank-you-
ma'am, type. Ha.

274
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:45,586
I'm not really sure
it happened at all,

275
00:15:45,587 --> 00:15:47,086
but I... I guess it did,

276
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:49,089
'cause he told
everybody at school

277
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,091
I was a lousy...

278
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,307
Hi.

279
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,809
How are you?

280
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,310
Hello.

281
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:56,313
Hello.

282
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:58,315
That's it, yeah.

283
00:16:58,316 --> 00:17:00,318
All right.

284
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:03,819
Hello.

285
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,322
Ha ha. Oh, my, don't we...

286
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:08,823
Ha ha... Look sharp?

287
00:17:08,824 --> 00:17:10,325
Come in.

288
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:14,329
She's not ready yet.

289
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,330
<i>Pour vous.</i>

290
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:17,831
Oh, they're beautiful.

291
00:17:17,832 --> 00:17:20,334
I better put them in
water right away.

292
00:17:20,335 --> 00:17:22,837
She and Eileen have been
upstairs getting ready

293
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:24,337
since this morning.

294
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:26,340
You'd think it was a coronation

295
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:28,842
instead of a high school prom.

296
00:17:30,344 --> 00:17:31,844
Hiya, George.

297
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:36,348
Goin' bowlin'?

298
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:40,351
Oh, lord, he looks
like a tango dancer.

299
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:41,353
He's a friend of mine.

300
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:42,853
Who?

301
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,855
Telly savalas. <i>Kojak.</i>

302
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,856
Bullshit.

303
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,858
Is this too much lipstick?

304
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,360
He said not to use too much.

305
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,860
Does it look all right?

306
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:53,362
Is this too much eye shadow?

307
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,365
Does it look all right?

308
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:59,868
I thought I had a vase but...

309
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:00,869
Get your feet off.

310
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,370
Yes, ma'am.

311
00:18:03,872 --> 00:18:07,874
That was a pretty expensive
dress you bought Dorothy.

312
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,377
Oh, it seemed right for her.

313
00:18:10,378 --> 00:18:12,879
She's almost ready.

314
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,882
You should see her.

315
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:17,383
Smell, mom.

316
00:18:17,384 --> 00:18:18,384
Ooh.

317
00:18:18,385 --> 00:18:19,885
Smell me, George.

318
00:18:19,886 --> 00:18:20,887
Get out of here.

319
00:18:20,888 --> 00:18:22,387
Come on.

320
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:23,388
Aw.

321
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:26,391
Smell it, Paul. Real deep.

322
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:27,892
Mmm!

323
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:29,394
That's what she smells like.

324
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:30,895
It's called toilet water.

325
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:33,397
Wait! Hold on a second.

326
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
The orchid is for Dorothy,

327
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:38,902
and the gardenia's for you.

328
00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:40,403
Thank you.

329
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:42,406
He's here!
We both got a present!

330
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:44,906
They like the way you smell.

331
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:47,409
That Eileen is a knockout.

332
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:55,416
All the ladies in
this house are knockouts.

333
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:56,418
Bullshit again.

334
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:57,919
George.

335
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:00,921
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

336
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:02,922
Here she comes, everybody.

337
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:04,924
She looks like a movie star!

338
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:14,932
Ahh!

339
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:16,434
Doesn't she look beautiful?

340
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:17,435
Terrific.

341
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:18,936
You look lovely.

342
00:19:18,937 --> 00:19:20,438
Can we take a picture, mom?

343
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:21,937
I have a camera in the car.

344
00:19:21,938 --> 00:19:22,938
I'll be right back.

345
00:19:22,939 --> 00:19:23,941

346
00:19:23,942 --> 00:19:24,942

00:20:27,497 --> 00:20:28,997
Yeah, that's him, all right.

367
00:20:29,498 --> 00:20:30,499
A jock.

368
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:32,000
How'd you know?

369
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:35,504
Just by the smart-ass
way he said your name.

370
00:20:35,505 --> 00:20:39,006
Does he think I'm stupid
not to pick up on that?

371
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:44,010
Oh, now, don't start
any trouble, please?

372
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:47,012
Ha ha. It won't be any trouble.

373
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:53,518
<i>♪ ...Although I might not ♪

374
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,021
<i>♪ I don't want clever ♪</i>

375
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,023
<i>♪ Conversation ♪</i>

376
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:02,526
Jesus Christ! Who did that?

377
00:21:04,028 --> 00:21:05,529
Excuse us.

378
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,030
Very funny. Big joke, eh?

379
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:11,535
You hurt him, Paul, didn't you?

380
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,536
Ha. Not enough, the prick.

381
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:20,042
<i>♪ I want you ♪

382
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:39,842
I'm very romantic,

383
00:21:39,843 --> 00:21:41,844
and I like little surprises

384
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:44,346
and, you know, little
gestures like flowers

385
00:21:44,347 --> 00:21:46,848
or a call when
you don't expect it,

386
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:48,350
and, you know, things like that.

387
00:21:48,351 --> 00:21:50,851
Not... not sexual things.

388
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:52,353
Well, would it surprise you

389
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:53,353
if I asked you

390
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,356
to take off your clothes
right now?

391
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:56,857
Would you do it?

392
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,357
No.

393
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,359
Well, why not?

394
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,862
That's...

395
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,364
That's not romantic. That's...

396
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:11,370
It took me five 5
to shoot my Playmate layout.

397
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,370
I shot over 20,000 pictures.

398
00:22:13,371 --> 00:22:14,371
Sit up,

399
00:22:14,372 --> 00:22:15,873
put your knees together
and hug 'em.

400
00:22:15,874 --> 00:22:16,875
Like this?

401
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:17,876
Like that.

402
00:22:19,377 --> 00:22:21,378
That's nice.

403
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:31,387
How about opening
the shirt a little?

404
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,389
I can't.

405
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,391
Oh, yes, you can.

406
00:22:37,392 --> 00:22:39,394
It's fun.

407
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:46,900
Ok.

408
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:48,402
Ok.

409
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,917
What are you doing?

410
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:09,420
Paul.

411
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,923
Wet your lips
and open your mouth.

412
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,423
What?

413
00:23:14,424 --> 00:23:17,426
You know, like you
did last night.

414
00:23:17,427 --> 00:23:18,928
Paul.

415
00:23:23,432 --> 00:23:25,934
I can do that.

416
00:23:37,945 --> 00:23:39,947
Dorothy?

417
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:33,493
Dorothy Stratten,
<i>Playboy</i> centerfold.

418
00:24:33,494 --> 00:24:34,993
You're on <i>Street Talk.</i>

419
00:24:34,994 --> 00:24:36,495
<i>Hi, miss Stratten,
my name is George.</i>

420
00:24:36,496 --> 00:24:38,496
Hi, George.

421
00:24:38,497 --> 00:24:40,499
<i>Listen, we were sitting
around the garage,</i>

422
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
<i>and we had this question...
Uh, what's it like</i>

423
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,501
<i>to pose, uh, nude?
I mean, how's it feel?</i>

424
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:46,503
It feels a little
chilly sometimes.

425
00:24:46,504 --> 00:24:48,505
Score one for Dorothy.

426
00:24:48,506 --> 00:24:51,007
We're talking with
Dorothy Stratten.

427
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,012
Oh, god, I look fat in that one.

428
00:24:59,015 --> 00:25:02,518
Oh, jeez. I hope my mother
never sees these.

429
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:04,519
Oh, god, my mother.
What time is it?

430
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,521
4:30.

431
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:14,528
Hi, mom?

432
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,032
Yes, I know.

433
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:21,533
I'm sorry.

434
00:25:21,534 --> 00:25:24,036
Give me a chance
to explain, mom.

435
00:25:25,538 --> 00:25:27,538
It got so late,

436
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:28,540
I thought you'd be sleeping.

437
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:30,408
I didn't want to wake you.

438
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:35,513
I'm staying over
at Nancy's house.

439
00:25:36,013 --> 00:25:38,515
No, I'm not with him.

440
00:25:38,516 --> 00:25:41,015
Well, he showed
me some polaroids,

441
00:25:41,016 --> 00:25:42,518
and wanted me to do
some test shots.

442
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:45,020
And we, uh, we made a deal.

443
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,023
If she got accepted,
I'd get $1,000.

444
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:48,522
Otherwise, nothing.

445
00:25:48,523 --> 00:25:50,025
That's the usual finder's fee

446
00:25:50,026 --> 00:25:53,027
that <i>Playboy</i> pays... A thousand.

447
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:54,529
He really believed in this girl,

448
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,031
or else he just
wanted to screw her.

449
00:25:57,032 --> 00:26:00,534
I'm still not sure
which, maybe both.

450
00:26:00,535 --> 00:26:02,536
Anyway, he convinced me.

451
00:26:02,537 --> 00:26:04,537
Oh, there you go.

452
00:26:04,538 --> 00:26:06,539
Ok, eyes to me.

453
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,042
Throw your head back.

454
00:26:10,544 --> 00:26:12,544
That's it.

455
00:26:12,545 --> 00:26:14,546
Sorry.

456
00:26:14,547 --> 00:26:16,047
Forget it, Dorothy.

457
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:18,050
You looked better the other way.

458
00:26:18,051 --> 00:26:20,050
You're holding that scarf

459
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:23,053
like it was a security blanket.

460
00:26:23,054 --> 00:26:24,555
Here, come on, just relax.

461
00:26:24,556 --> 00:26:25,555
Yeah.

462
00:26:25,556 --> 00:26:26,557
Arch your back.

463
00:26:27,057 --> 00:26:28,056
Tuck in the tummy.

464
00:26:28,057 --> 00:26:30,060
I think were gonna like
that that much better.

465
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:32,061
Excuse me.

466
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:33,062
Sorry.

467
00:26:36,566 --> 00:26:37,567
That's it. Good girl.

468
00:26:37,568 --> 00:26:41,069
That's perfect.

469
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,070
Right there!

470
00:26:42,571 --> 00:26:43,572
Look over here, Dorothy,

471
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:45,072
and open your mouth.

472
00:26:45,073 --> 00:26:47,075
What stop are you using?

473
00:26:47,576 --> 00:26:49,577
Could I talk to you
for a minute?

474
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,587
Listen, Dorothy, I'm gonna
wait in the dressing room.

475
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:03,588
Too many directors.

476
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,090
Ok.

477
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,098
Now maybe we can
get some work done.

478
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,099
That's good.

479
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
All right.

480
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:18,100
All right,

481
00:27:18,101 --> 00:27:19,602
now throw your head
back a little bit

482
00:27:19,603 --> 00:27:20,604
and give me a smile.

483
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:23,606
Ok, that's good.

484
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:26,608
Ok, now give me a little pout.

485
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:29,110
That a girl. That's good.

486
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:32,113
Ok, now, relax the hands again.

487
00:27:32,114 --> 00:27:33,614
Now, think about an animal.

488
00:27:33,615 --> 00:27:34,615
Ok.

489
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:37,117
Yeah, make it a wild animal.

490
00:27:37,118 --> 00:27:39,120
It's starting to
get hot in here!

491
00:27:39,621 --> 00:27:40,619
That's the way.

492
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,120
That's the way. All right.

493
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:43,121
Yes, all right.

494
00:27:43,122 --> 00:27:44,963
Now, the little girl
is starting to learn here.

495
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:47,126
Let's go. Nice.

496
00:27:47,127 --> 00:27:48,886
Oh, that's good. Now,
hold that, that's nice.

497
00:27:49,128 --> 00:27:50,629
Ha ha. Yes, yes.

498
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,131
Little girl is growing up.

499
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:54,633
All right, here we go.

500
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:56,134
Oh, that's nice.
That's nice. Hold that.

501
00:27:56,135 --> 00:27:57,134
Hold that.

502
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:58,636
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

503
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:00,638
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

504
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,139
She's like a big, sweet kid.

505
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,140
Polite, too.

506
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:04,141
No scars.

507
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:07,644
Maybe have to do
something with her hair.

508
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,646
Not overweight.
I like her a lot.

509
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:10,646
How old?

510
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,147
18, I think.

511
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,147
Now,

512
00:28:13,148 --> 00:28:14,150
here's what
the son of a bitch did.

513
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,151
Now, I worked my ass off.

514
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,652
Then he turns around

515
00:28:17,653 --> 00:28:19,053
and he goes
to another photographer,

516
00:28:19,154 --> 00:28:21,156
and he uses my stuff to
convince the other guy

517
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,657
that the girl is good.

518
00:28:22,658 --> 00:28:24,659
Then he sends
the other guy's test

519
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,659
into <i>Playboy</i>

520
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,161
and screws me out
of the finder's fee...

521
00:28:27,162 --> 00:28:28,161
A 1,000 bucks.

522
00:28:28,162 --> 00:28:30,597
Ha ha ha. I mean,
the guy is a bastard.

523
00:28:30,598 --> 00:28:33,365
They'll fly her
to L.A. first-class,

524
00:28:33,366 --> 00:28:35,366
take some more
test shots of her,

525
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:36,869
and then they'll decide

526
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,371
if they want to use her
in the magazine or not.

527
00:28:38,372 --> 00:28:40,872
That's really
all there is to it.

528
00:28:40,873 --> 00:28:42,373
That's all, huh?

529
00:28:42,374 --> 00:28:44,375
But we do need your consent

530
00:28:44,376 --> 00:28:45,877
because of her age.

531
00:28:45,878 --> 00:28:47,878
And if I don't sign?

532
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:50,881
Then we both jump out a window.

533
00:28:50,882 --> 00:28:52,884
No, seriously,
if you don't sign,

534
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:55,886
then it's... All off.

535
00:28:58,388 --> 00:29:00,890
She wants to go.

536
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:04,392
I'm slowly beginning
to get the idea

537
00:29:04,393 --> 00:29:06,394
that you want her to go.

538
00:29:06,395 --> 00:29:08,897
That leaves me, her mother.

539
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:16,403
I know this could be a
real opportunity for us.

540
00:29:16,404 --> 00:29:18,404
It could change our lives.

541
00:29:18,405 --> 00:29:20,406
What is this "us," "our"?

542
00:29:20,407 --> 00:29:22,909
I don't see any naked
pictures of you here, Paul.

543
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,109
I don't see any pictures of you

544
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,409
with your privates hanging out

545
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,912
for the whole world to look at.

546
00:29:26,913 --> 00:29:28,915
Let's get the camera.
I'm willing.

547
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:31,416
Oh, I bet you are.

548
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:35,920
Oh, I don't know.

549
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:37,923
She wouldn't even
walk around the house

550
00:29:37,924 --> 00:29:40,423
in a nightgown
before she met you.

551
00:29:40,424 --> 00:29:42,426
Do you know who reads <i>Playboy?</i>

552
00:29:42,927 --> 00:29:43,928
No, tell me.

553
00:29:44,428 --> 00:29:46,428
Movie producers, directors,

554
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:48,430
agents, TV people.

555
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:50,933
The people who produce
<i>Charlie's Angels</i>

556
00:29:50,934 --> 00:29:52,434
read <i>Playboy.</i>

557
00:29:52,435 --> 00:29:54,936
I have this feeling
about Dorothy,

558
00:29:54,937 --> 00:29:57,437
this hunch that she's
gonna be a big star

559
00:29:57,438 --> 00:29:59,941
in the movies or on TV,
I don't know,

560
00:29:59,942 --> 00:30:01,442
but a really big star.

561
00:30:01,943 --> 00:30:03,442
But she's gonna need help.

562
00:30:03,443 --> 00:30:04,445
You can't do it alone.

563
00:30:04,446 --> 00:30:05,946
You need somebody.

564
00:30:05,947 --> 00:30:07,949
And you're gonna be
that somebody?

565
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,949
I know all the tricks,

566
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,951
I know all the con games.

567
00:30:11,952 --> 00:30:13,453
Hey, I know all
the bullshitting.

568
00:30:13,954 --> 00:30:15,955
There's plenty
of that, believe me.

569
00:30:16,455 --> 00:30:18,957
Together, we could be somebody.

570
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:20,959
People would know who we are.

571
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,459
People would know our names.

572
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,962
People would treat us
that special way,

573
00:30:25,463 --> 00:30:26,964
the way they treat stars.

574
00:30:26,965 --> 00:30:27,965
People would...

575
00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:30,968
Hell, we'd walk into
a restaurant, people...

576
00:30:35,973 --> 00:30:37,474
I do love her.

577
00:30:37,975 --> 00:30:39,474
What did you say?

578
00:30:39,475 --> 00:30:40,976
I said I love her.

579
00:30:40,977 --> 00:30:44,480
Funny. I could have sworn
you said, "I love <i>it."</i>

580
00:30:44,981 --> 00:30:47,482
You don't like me, do you?

581
00:30:49,985 --> 00:30:51,987
I love Dorothy.

582
00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:53,487
The answer's no.

583
00:30:53,988 --> 00:30:54,989
Why?

584
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:56,490
Give me a reason.

585
00:30:56,991 --> 00:30:58,492
I don't have to
give you a reason.

586
00:30:58,493 --> 00:30:59,993
I'm her mother.

587
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:01,494
That's the reason.

588
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:03,496
That's the reason.

589
00:31:03,997 --> 00:31:05,498
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

590
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:09,501
<i>Western Airlines flight 468
nonstop for Los Angeles...</i>

591
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:11,503
I don't want to go.

592
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:14,506
You're dying to go.

593
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:18,509
I wish you were coming with me.

594
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,510
Everybody's looking
at us. Did you notice?

595
00:31:21,511 --> 00:31:22,511
Yeah, a little.

596
00:31:22,512 --> 00:31:24,514
Straighten up, angel.
You're slouching.

597
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:25,514
Better?

598
00:31:25,515 --> 00:31:26,516
Makes you look taller.

599
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:29,018
Makes you look like a queen.

600
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,521
I never signed it.

601
00:31:33,522 --> 00:31:36,024
Somehow it got signed, yes.

602
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:39,026
But I didn't sign it.

603
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:42,029
I can only guess how.

604
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:46,533
I never would have signed it.

605
00:31:56,376 --> 00:31:57,876
Have you met him yet?

606
00:31:57,877 --> 00:31:58,877
Who?

607
00:31:58,878 --> 00:32:00,378
The man. The man. Hefner.

608
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:02,880
Oh, Paul, he's wonderful,

609
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:05,883
like a father or something.

610
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:07,385
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

611
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:08,885
That's ok.

612
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:10,387
Where are you calling from?

613
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:12,889
Mr. Hefner's house.

614
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,391
You mean the mansion?

615
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:16,391
Oh, Paul, I wish
you could be here.

616
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,395
I wish you could
be here with me.

617
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:19,895
You should see it.

618
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,896
I've never seen
so many pretty girls

619
00:32:21,897 --> 00:32:22,898
in my whole life.

620
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,401
I suddenly feel really ugly.

621
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,902
Is Jimmy caan there?

622
00:32:27,903 --> 00:32:28,903
Who?

623
00:32:28,904 --> 00:32:31,405
Sonny corleone in the <i>godfather.</i>

624
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:32,907
I didn't see it.

625
00:32:33,408 --> 00:32:35,910
He's probably there.
He and hef are pals.

626
00:32:35,911 --> 00:32:37,910
Who did you meet?

627
00:32:37,911 --> 00:32:39,412
Oh, so many people.

628
00:32:39,413 --> 00:32:40,913
Let me think.

629
00:32:40,914 --> 00:32:43,416
I think he's a famous
athlete or something.

630
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:45,417
Name's Billy Bob,

631
00:32:45,418 --> 00:32:47,919
or Willy Joe,
something like that.

632
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,421
Batton? Billy Joe batton?

633
00:32:49,922 --> 00:32:51,922
He sort of half smiles
all the time.

634
00:32:51,923 --> 00:32:53,925
Ha ha. Well, watch out
for that smile.

635
00:32:53,926 --> 00:32:56,427
He's a real cocksman.

636
00:32:56,428 --> 00:32:58,429
Got a bad reputation.

637
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,929
Is telly there?

638
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,431
Did you meet telly?

639
00:33:01,932 --> 00:33:03,433
I don't think so. I'm not sure.

640
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:05,934
Ok, Dorothy,
when you meet people,

641
00:33:05,935 --> 00:33:07,436
you should really make an effort

642
00:33:07,437 --> 00:33:08,936
to try to remember their names.

643
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:10,439
It makes a good impression.

644
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,940
I'll try from now on.

645
00:33:11,941 --> 00:33:14,442
Paul, everything
is happening so fast.

646
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:16,944
It's a little bananas.

647
00:33:16,945 --> 00:33:17,945
Let's see,

648
00:33:17,946 --> 00:33:18,945
they're going to
shoot some more shots

649
00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:21,449
or whatever they
call them, and they say

650
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,949
I'm not going to be
anniversary Playmate,

651
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,953
but they did say
I've got a good chance,

652
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,454
a very good chance

653
00:33:27,455 --> 00:33:28,954
of being centerfold for August.

654
00:33:28,955 --> 00:33:31,958
Mr. Hefner will make
the decision next week.

655
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:35,461
Isn't it terrific?
I am so excited.

656
00:33:35,462 --> 00:33:36,463
What's he like?

657
00:33:36,962 --> 00:33:37,962
Mr. Hefner?

658
00:33:37,963 --> 00:33:39,464
Oh, nice, like I said.

659
00:33:39,465 --> 00:33:40,965
But I get the feeling

660
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:42,206
that everybody trembles a little

661
00:33:42,468 --> 00:33:43,469
when they mention his name.

662
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,970
You know, "Mr. Hefner
wants to see you."

663
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:48,472
Was he wearing pajamas?

664
00:33:48,473 --> 00:33:49,973
How'd you know?

665
00:33:49,974 --> 00:33:52,475
I've been wanting to
have this talk

666
00:33:52,476 --> 00:33:53,477
with you for a while,

667
00:33:53,977 --> 00:33:55,478
but I guess we've been
keeping you pretty busy.

668
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:56,479
I'll say.

669
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Coffee for
miss Stratten. Yes, sir.

670
00:33:58,481 --> 00:34:00,981
Dorothy, it's going to
take a couple weeks or so

671
00:34:00,982 --> 00:34:03,986
to come to a decision
on this thing, et cetera.

672
00:34:03,987 --> 00:34:06,487
Oh, I understand.

673
00:34:06,488 --> 00:34:07,988
Thank you.

674
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:09,490
Have a seat.

675
00:34:09,491 --> 00:34:12,994
In the meantime, I imagine
you could use some money.

676
00:34:12,995 --> 00:34:13,993
Yes, I could.

677
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:15,495
I thought so.

678
00:34:15,496 --> 00:34:18,497
Anyway, our people thought
we could fit you in

679
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:20,501
as a bunny at our club
in century city.

680
00:34:20,502 --> 00:34:22,001
Tips are pretty good.

681
00:34:22,502 --> 00:34:24,002
That'll be just fine.

682
00:34:24,003 --> 00:34:26,505
And I'll see if I can't
get them to find you

683
00:34:26,506 --> 00:34:28,508
a little apartment
while you're waiting.

684
00:34:28,509 --> 00:34:30,508
Not too expensive.

685
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:32,009
In the meantime,

686
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,511
you can stay here,
if you'd like,

687
00:34:33,512 --> 00:34:35,011
in one of the guest rooms.

688
00:34:35,012 --> 00:34:36,612
Well, I can look for
an apartment myself.

689
00:34:37,014 --> 00:34:38,515
No. We'll do all that for you.

690
00:34:38,516 --> 00:34:39,515
Anyway, I have a feeling

691
00:34:39,516 --> 00:34:41,018
it's all very
temporary, Dorothy.

692
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:42,018
I think

693
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:43,519
there are very big
things ahead for you.

694
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,521
I don't know about that,

695
00:34:45,021 --> 00:34:46,221
but I'll certainly try for you.

696
00:34:46,523 --> 00:34:47,524
I know you will.

697
00:34:48,024 --> 00:34:50,026
Well, that just leaves my, uh,

698
00:34:50,527 --> 00:34:52,026
my speech.

699
00:34:52,027 --> 00:34:53,027
Ready?

700
00:34:53,028 --> 00:34:54,028
Yes, sir.

701
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:55,029
<i>Playboy</i>

702
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,030
is a very special
magazine, Dorothy.

703
00:34:57,031 --> 00:34:58,532
There's no other
magazine like it.

704
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:00,032
All the writers,
editors, photographers,

705
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:01,535
all the girls, et cetera,

706
00:35:02,036 --> 00:35:04,538
we all have a very
special relationship.

707
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:06,540
It's not like
any other magazine.

708
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,040
We're all like a...

709
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:10,043
Well, we're just like a family.

710
00:35:10,044 --> 00:35:11,043
A family.

711
00:35:11,044 --> 00:35:13,045
It's like having a family.

712
00:35:13,046 --> 00:35:14,044
The whole magazine

713
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,047
is like having a family.

714
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:16,547
The whole magazine

715
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,050
is like having a family.

716
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:19,051
See?

717
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:21,551
I know a lot of people
say that's a lot of bull,

718
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,052
but that's how I think of it.

719
00:35:23,053 --> 00:35:25,056
That's how we all think of it.

720
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:28,058
It's kind of a world
within a world.

721
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,559
It's a...

722
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,061
Well, it's a family.

723
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:34,062
Wasn't that neat about the job

724
00:35:34,063 --> 00:35:35,564
and the apartment
and everything?

725
00:35:35,565 --> 00:35:37,565
Hey, listen, it all
sounds terrific.

726
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:39,066
And, god, meeting
all those people.

727
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:40,569
They're good contacts.
It can only help.

728
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,571
Know what I mean?

729
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:42,571
I think so.

730
00:35:42,572 --> 00:35:44,572
I'll call tomorrow.

731
00:35:44,573 --> 00:35:45,573
I love you.

732
00:35:45,574 --> 00:35:48,075
I love you, too. Bye.

733
00:35:48,076 --> 00:35:49,077
Thanks, Johnny.

734
00:35:49,578 --> 00:35:52,078
That was some phone call.

735
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,080
How's the kid doing?

736
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:55,581
Sounds like it's
going really right.

737
00:35:55,582 --> 00:35:57,082
She was calling
from hef's place.

738
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,585
Johnny, be a pal and pour me
about that much scotch.

739
00:35:59,586 --> 00:36:01,587
She's in the mansion?

740
00:36:01,588 --> 00:36:04,589
Billy Joe batton
is making a big play for her.

741
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,089
Billy Joe batton
the football player...

742
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,592
Making a move on Dorothy?

743
00:36:07,593 --> 00:36:08,592
Ah, it figures.

744
00:36:08,593 --> 00:36:10,093
That's the kind of town L.A. is.

745
00:36:10,094 --> 00:36:12,097
Jesus Christ... I'd
be going outta my skull

746
00:36:12,098 --> 00:36:13,597
if Billy Joe batton

747
00:36:13,598 --> 00:36:15,099
was trying to get
in my girl's pants.

748
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,600
Ah... what's her name?

757
00:36:31,614 --> 00:36:32,613
I don't like to do, like,

758
00:36:32,614 --> 00:36:34,781
black dudes and white
dudes kind of stuff,

759
00:36:34,782 --> 00:36:35,781
but the thing I've noticed

760
00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:37,783
about black dudes
and white dudes

761
00:36:37,784 --> 00:36:41,288
is that, like, black people
chastise their kids more.

762
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:42,290
And as a result,

763
00:36:42,789 --> 00:36:43,788
you don't see black people
doing crazy things,

764
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:45,790
like shooting the president.
That's true,

765
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:46,791
'cause if a brother would
have shot the president,

766
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:48,294
as they were leading him
away, it'd be like,

767
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:50,294
"look, man, just don't
tell my mama, man.

768
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,298
My mama gonna kill me, man..."

769
00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:54,300
Here she comes.

770
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:59,804
That's room 217 and 218.

771
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:01,305
219.

772
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:02,807
At the Beverly Hilton.

773
00:37:02,808 --> 00:37:05,808
No, I can't, really.

774
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:09,312
Oops. That's not the way
we're supposed to do that.

775
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:12,814
That's called the bunny dip.

776
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:16,318
<i>Playboy's</i> motto
is "the girl next door."

777
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:17,320
They look for girls

778
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:20,821
that are wholesome and
fresh and young and naive.

779
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:23,324
They look for all of that,
so most of those girls

780
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:27,827
do, uh, have that type
of background.

781
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,329
You know, Snider,

782
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,332
I have this theory about you.

783
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,832
Oh, you do, do you?

784
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,832
I think the reason why
you're so good in bed

785
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:37,336
is because you
just plain try harder.

786
00:37:37,337 --> 00:37:39,839
I mean, baby, you
put in an 8-hour day

787
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,340
in 15 minutes.

788
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:42,840
Ha ha ha!

789
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:44,342
Dorothy, on answering
MACHINE: <i>Hi, it's me.</i>

790
00:37:44,343 --> 00:37:45,344
<i>I called earlier, too,</i>

791
00:37:45,844 --> 00:37:47,324
hold it.
<i>But I didn't leave a message.</i>

792
00:37:47,346 --> 00:37:48,845
<i>I just wanted to let you know</i>

793
00:37:48,846 --> 00:37:49,845
<i>that I had to work late,</i>

794
00:37:49,846 --> 00:37:51,348
<i>but I'll call again
when I get home.</i>

795
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:53,351
<i>Oh, thanks for the flowers.
They're beautiful.</i>

796
00:37:53,352 --> 00:37:54,851
Ooh, flowers.

797
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:55,851
<i>These machines
make me so nervous.</i>

798
00:37:55,852 --> 00:37:57,852
<i>I always feel like
if I don't talk fast,</i>

799
00:37:57,853 --> 00:37:59,355
<i>my 30 seconds will run out.</i>

800
00:37:59,356 --> 00:38:00,855
<i>Yes, I think it would be
a terrific idea</i>

801
00:38:00,856 --> 00:38:02,358
<i>if you take Eileen
to the carnival.</i>

802
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:03,359
<i>She'd love it.</i>

803
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,361
<i>Just don't let her
eat too much junk food.</i>

804
00:38:05,362 --> 00:38:07,862
<i>I love you. Bye.
Whew, I made it.</i>

805
00:38:07,863 --> 00:38:10,365
That must be number one.

806
00:38:10,366 --> 00:38:12,366
I bet you was scared as hell

807
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:14,368
she was out last night

808
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:16,370
doin' what we just did.

809
00:38:16,371 --> 00:38:18,372
Look I got to get up early,

810
00:38:18,373 --> 00:38:21,375

But no junk food. Right?

828
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:19,424
Right.

829
00:39:19,425 --> 00:39:21,427

833
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:30,935
You're slouching again.

834
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:31,935
I know...

835
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,937
You want me to look
like a centerfold.

836
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:35,939
Honest? You mean it?

837
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,440
August.

838
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:40,942
Oh, Mr. Hefner, thank you.

839
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:42,444
Miss Stratton,
what about your mother?

840
00:39:42,445 --> 00:39:44,945
How did she feel about
your photos in <i>Playboy?</i>

841
00:39:44,946 --> 00:39:47,449
I don't think she liked
it at all at first,

842
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,451
but then she started
getting calls from

843
00:39:50,452 --> 00:39:53,454
several of her friends
congratulating her,

844
00:39:53,455 --> 00:39:54,955
and she said to me,

845
00:39:54,956 --> 00:39:56,456
"I feel like a movie star."

846
00:39:56,457 --> 00:39:57,958
I mean, she was so excited.

847
00:39:58,459 --> 00:39:59,959
$10,000!

848
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,962
They're gonna give me $10,000

849
00:40:02,463 --> 00:40:03,963
for having my picture taken.

850
00:40:04,464 --> 00:40:05,465
Feels good, huh?

851
00:40:05,466 --> 00:40:07,966
Oh, yes. Yes.

852
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:11,469
Dorothy, do you really love me?

853
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,972
Yes. Yes, I do.

854
00:40:14,473 --> 00:40:15,474
Well, all right.

855
00:40:15,974 --> 00:40:17,055
Here's how it lays out then.

856
00:40:17,476 --> 00:40:18,474
I'll grab a plane by Wednesday,

857
00:40:18,475 --> 00:40:19,477
Thursday at the latest,

858
00:40:19,977 --> 00:40:20,976
and I'll be there.

859
00:40:20,977 --> 00:40:21,979
Well, I wouldn't
have that much time

860
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,480
to spend with you.

861
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:25,482
It's like they've got me
running all day long.

862
00:40:25,982 --> 00:40:27,142
Then when we get some time,

863
00:40:27,484 --> 00:40:29,004
we'll just run over
to Vegas and do it.

864
00:40:29,486 --> 00:40:30,987
We'll just do it, right?

865
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,987
Do it? Do what?

866
00:40:32,988 --> 00:40:34,989
How about getting married?

867
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,492
We'll get married, Dorothy...

868
00:40:37,493 --> 00:40:39,994
Make it permanent,
just like that.

869
00:40:39,995 --> 00:40:43,998
We'll make it
a permanent team...

870
00:40:44,499 --> 00:40:46,000
For life.

871
00:40:47,502 --> 00:40:50,002
We had everything going for us,

872
00:40:50,003 --> 00:40:53,506
but you fucks
wouldn't let me in.

873
00:40:54,007 --> 00:40:56,008
Big fucking deal.

874
00:40:56,509 --> 00:40:59,010
Well, you can take
your magazine,

875
00:40:59,011 --> 00:41:00,012
your mansion, and your movies

876
00:41:00,013 --> 00:41:04,014
and shove them
all up your ass now.

877
00:41:04,015 --> 00:41:05,416
Liar!

878
00:41:05,417 --> 00:41:07,017
I have missed you.

879
00:41:07,018 --> 00:41:10,020
I have missed you so much.

880
00:41:15,025 --> 00:41:17,526
Guess we should go, huh?

881
00:41:27,536 --> 00:41:31,539
Somebody told Mr. Hefner
I was going to pick you up.

882
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,041
It's his personal car.

883
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:36,543
A little embarrassing, isn't it?

884
00:41:36,544 --> 00:41:37,544

Vince Roberts.

904
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:30,090
I'm a big fan.

905
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:31,591
Thanks.

906
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:33,092
Hey, listen, that was
my favorite TV show.

907
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:34,593
Thank you.

908
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,595
Canceled, huh?

909
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:37,596
Yeah.

910
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:40,097
Any chance they'll
bring it back?

911
00:42:40,098 --> 00:42:41,099
I don't think so.

912
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,600
Ah, too bad.

913
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,100
Aren't many actors
around like you.

914
00:42:44,101 --> 00:42:45,603
They're all lightweights.

915
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,605
We need heavyweights like you.

916
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,607
You break my heart.

917
00:42:50,107 --> 00:42:54,109
Jeez, it's been a while
since that show was on.

918
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,611
What is it, a year now?

919
00:42:55,612 --> 00:42:57,112
3.

920
00:42:57,113 --> 00:42:59,615
It's been 3 years
since you were on TV?

921
00:42:59,616 --> 00:43:00,616
Yeah.

922
00:43:00,617 --> 00:43:02,618
Isn't that something?

923
00:43:03,118 --> 00:43:04,119
Bad scripts, huh?

924
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,120
I guess so.

925
00:43:06,121 --> 00:43:08,122
Dorothy, there you are.

926
00:43:08,123 --> 00:43:09,623
Excuse me.

927
00:43:09,624 --> 00:43:11,124
Yeah, you know,

928
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:12,926
good writers are really
hard to find out here.

929
00:43:13,127 --> 00:43:14,628
I've got a couple
of projects in mind...

930
00:43:14,629 --> 00:43:17,629
I could use a good writer,
and I can't find any.

931
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,130
I mean, not
a decent one, anyway,

932
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:20,131
and when you do,

933
00:43:20,132 --> 00:43:22,635
they won't do what
you tell 'em to do.

934
00:43:23,136 --> 00:43:26,137
Yeah. Some writers
are like that.

935
00:43:26,138 --> 00:43:27,639
Would you excuse me?
I'm just gonna...

936
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,639
Well, I for one

937
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,642
hope you're back
on the tube real soon.

938
00:43:30,142 --> 00:43:31,642
Thanks.

939
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:34,645
Um, are you working
on anything new now?

940
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:36,647
Just reading.

941
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:38,148
Just reading.

942
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:39,649
Excuse me.

943
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,153
See ya, Vince.

944
00:43:51,661 --> 00:43:54,162
You should have talked to him.

945
00:43:55,163 --> 00:43:57,165
There's hef. Straighten up.

946
00:44:00,168 --> 00:44:01,168
Hi, Dorothy.

947
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:05,672
Look at her. Oh, wow...

948
00:44:07,675 --> 00:44:08,674
Anytime.

949
00:44:08,675 --> 00:44:09,676
Ok.

950
00:44:10,176 --> 00:44:12,176
I see you got here all right.

951
00:44:12,177 --> 00:44:14,180
Mr. Hefner, this is Paul Snider.

952
00:44:14,181 --> 00:44:16,180
Paul, Mr. Hefner.

953
00:44:16,181 --> 00:44:19,684
If a man has a right
to find god in his own way,

954
00:44:20,185 --> 00:44:21,185
he has a right

955
00:44:21,186 --> 00:44:23,186
to go to the devil
in his own way.

956
00:44:23,187 --> 00:44:24,186
Here's another one...

957
00:44:24,187 --> 00:44:26,690
Descriptions of murder
which we consider a crime

958
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:28,691
are acceptable in art
and literature,

959
00:44:28,692 --> 00:44:31,194
but descriptions of sex
are prohibited.

960
00:44:31,695 --> 00:44:34,197
Our society
has put hate above love,

961
00:44:34,698 --> 00:44:37,199
favored killing over living.

962
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,700
Right?

963
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:41,202
Pretty close, but I think

964
00:44:41,203 --> 00:44:43,705
I said "favored
death over life."

965
00:44:43,706 --> 00:44:46,206
What? I don't understand. What?

966
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,209
He's quoting me.
Old ones at that.

967
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,210
That's great stuff.

968
00:44:50,211 --> 00:44:52,713
Fine piece of work. Fine...

969
00:44:52,714 --> 00:44:55,213
God, I feel hef here and I
are old friends.

970
00:44:55,214 --> 00:44:58,216
You know, I think we even
have some mutual buddies.

971
00:44:58,217 --> 00:44:59,719
Is, uh, telly at this bash?

972
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,719
Telly?

973
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,720
Savalas.

974
00:45:01,721 --> 00:45:03,220
Telly savalas. He's an old pal.

975
00:45:03,221 --> 00:45:04,223
Thought I might see him here.

976
00:45:04,224 --> 00:45:05,223
Oh!

977
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:07,726
Hey, Bobo.

978
00:45:07,727 --> 00:45:10,228
Ah, Bobo. Bobo, I want you
to meet Dorothy Stratten.

979
00:45:10,229 --> 00:45:11,228
Hi. Hi.

980
00:45:11,229 --> 00:45:14,231
Bobo Weller.

981
00:45:14,232 --> 00:45:15,732
I still got your centerfold

982
00:45:15,733 --> 00:45:16,734
on my wall.

983
00:45:17,234 --> 00:45:18,735
Oh, wow.

984
00:45:18,736 --> 00:45:20,738
Your favorite book
is <i>The Hite Report.</i>

985
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:24,239
You like Rod Stewart,
Linda Ronstadt,

986
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,241
and Boz Scaggs, right?

987
00:45:26,242 --> 00:45:27,743
Oh, wow.

988
00:45:27,744 --> 00:45:31,245
I'd know that bod anywhere.

989
00:45:31,246 --> 00:45:32,747
What's your name? Snider.

990
00:45:32,748 --> 00:45:33,748
Dorothy?

991
00:45:33,749 --> 00:45:34,749
Paul.

992
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,751
Excuse us a second. Dorothy...

993
00:45:37,752 --> 00:45:38,753
What do you do?

994
00:45:38,754 --> 00:45:42,222
Uh, I'm a personal manager.

995
00:45:42,223 --> 00:45:44,425
Phil, say hello
to Dorothy Stratten.

996
00:45:44,926 --> 00:45:46,424
He says say hello,
you say hello.

997
00:45:46,425 --> 00:45:47,927
Hello, Dorothy Stratten.

998
00:45:47,928 --> 00:45:48,928
I'm Phil Wass.

999
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:50,430
Hello.

1000
00:45:50,931 --> 00:45:52,932
Phil produces
movies... sometimes.

1001
00:45:52,933 --> 00:45:54,933
Dorothy's our Miss August.

1002
00:45:54,934 --> 00:45:56,214
We're all very
excited about her.

1003
00:45:56,435 --> 00:45:57,434
Maybe if you play
your cards right,

1004
00:45:57,435 --> 00:45:58,937
we might just
let you present her

1005
00:45:58,938 --> 00:45:59,938
in her film debut.

1006
00:45:59,939 --> 00:46:01,940
She's a very fine actress.

1007
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,440
Mr. Hefner...

1008
00:46:03,441 --> 00:46:04,440
Don't worry. He doesn't
know a damn thing

1009
00:46:04,441 --> 00:46:05,443
about acting anyway.

1010
00:46:05,944 --> 00:46:07,943
Excuse me. I'll
leave you 2 alone.

1011
00:46:07,944 --> 00:46:10,946
Listen, I <i>am</i> doing a film
called <i>Ball Bearings.</i>

1012
00:46:10,947 --> 00:46:12,447
Maybe you'd like to drop
over the office tomorrow

1013
00:46:12,448 --> 00:46:13,450
and meet the director.

1014
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:15,451
What have I got to lose?

1015
00:46:15,452 --> 00:46:17,453
You don't know the director.

1016
00:46:18,454 --> 00:46:21,456
Excuse me
for a minute. Yeah, sure.

1017
00:46:21,457 --> 00:46:22,457
It's not much of a part...

1018
00:46:22,458 --> 00:46:23,958
She'll take it.

1019
00:46:23,959 --> 00:46:25,459
Hi. Paul Snider here.

1020
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,961
Miss Stratten,

1021
00:46:26,962 --> 00:46:29,464
I saw your movie debut
in <i>ball bearings.</i>

1022
00:46:29,465 --> 00:46:30,964
Uh-oh. Ha ha...

1023
00:46:30,965 --> 00:46:32,465
Uh-oh is right.

1024
00:46:32,466 --> 00:46:33,967
No, I'm not the film critic,

1025
00:46:33,968 --> 00:46:36,469
but that wasn't much of a part.

1026
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,471
Well, I wasn't much
of an actress, either.

1027
00:46:38,472 --> 00:46:40,973
Oh? Are you better now?

1028
00:46:40,974 --> 00:46:42,976
Oh, god, I hope so.
I'm studying.

1029
00:46:42,977 --> 00:46:43,976
The classics?

1030
00:46:43,977 --> 00:46:46,478
No. Acting. I don't know
anything about music.

1031
00:46:50,482 --> 00:46:52,483
Sorry. I'm so embarrassed.

1032
00:46:54,986 --> 00:46:57,488
Hefner didn't like it
when I quoted him.

1033
00:46:57,489 --> 00:47:00,489
I shoulda kept my mouth shut.

1034
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:01,490
Damn.

1035
00:47:01,491 --> 00:47:03,993
I think it just surprised him.

1036
00:47:03,994 --> 00:47:06,495
Dumb move.

1037
00:47:06,496 --> 00:47:09,998
Maybe you were a little nervous.

1038
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:10,999
Oh...

1039
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,003
Look at these stupid clothes.

1040
00:47:17,005 --> 00:47:19,507
Dumb move quoting him.

1041
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:28,014
You know, I was a little nervous

1042
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:29,375
the first night
I was there, too...

1043
00:47:29,515 --> 00:47:32,017
Jesus, will you
stop sayin' that!

1044
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:40,024
I mean, why the hell
should I be nervous

1045
00:47:40,025 --> 00:47:42,027
around Hefner and that crowd?

1046
00:47:42,028 --> 00:47:44,027
Bunch of smart asses...

1047
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:47,530
With their stupid,
faggy hairstyles,

1048
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,032
smug bastards.

1049
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:50,532
And that Vince Roberts...

1050
00:47:50,533 --> 00:47:53,035
Boy, does he want to
get into your pants.

1051
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,537
He's not going to.

1052
00:47:55,538 --> 00:47:57,540
He's asked you out, hasn't he?

1053
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,540
Yes.

1054
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:00,041
What'd you say?

1055
00:48:02,544 --> 00:48:05,046
I said I had a fella,

1056
00:48:05,047 --> 00:48:07,048
a steady fella.

1057
00:48:08,049 --> 00:48:09,050
You did?

1058
00:48:15,055 --> 00:48:17,057
Maybe you should.

1059
00:48:18,058 --> 00:48:19,558
Should what?

1060
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:20,558
Go out with him.

1061
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,561
He said he was
reading some projects.

1062
00:48:22,562 --> 00:48:26,564
Ho, I'm really tired.
Let's go to bed.

1063
00:48:26,565 --> 00:48:28,564
Do you think Hefner liked me?

1064
00:48:28,565 --> 00:48:29,565
Paul, come on...

1065
00:48:29,566 --> 00:48:31,068
I don't think he liked me.

1066
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:32,570
If he just got to know me...

1067
00:49:17,993 --> 00:49:18,992
Look, Mr. Hefner,

1068
00:49:18,993 --> 00:49:20,493
are you trying to tell me

1069
00:49:20,494 --> 00:49:22,996
that you don't want me
to marry Paul?

1070
00:49:22,997 --> 00:49:24,496
You have to understand, Dorothy,

1071
00:49:24,497 --> 00:49:25,497
that a third party

1072
00:49:25,498 --> 00:49:26,500
is in kind of a funny
position, et cetera,

1073
00:49:27,001 --> 00:49:28,000
when you're trying to
counsel somebody

1074
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:29,000
about marriage.

1075
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:31,004
You never know how
it's going to end up.

1076
00:49:31,005 --> 00:49:32,504
It's not because

1077
00:49:32,505 --> 00:49:35,007
I'm going to be
a Playmate, is it?

1078
00:49:35,008 --> 00:49:36,507
No, no.

1079
00:49:36,508 --> 00:49:37,508
Of course not.

1080
00:49:37,509 --> 00:49:39,010
Well, some of the
other girls told me

1081
00:49:39,011 --> 00:49:40,512
that you didn't
like the playmates

1082
00:49:40,513 --> 00:49:41,512
to be married.

1083
00:49:41,513 --> 00:49:43,013
Frankly, we think
it's better for the image

1084
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:44,013
if they're not.

1085
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:45,516
You understand that, don't you?

1086
00:49:45,517 --> 00:49:47,017
But several have been.

1087
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:48,017
Just a moment, Sam.

1088
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:49,020
Who? Give me some names.

1089
00:49:49,021 --> 00:49:50,020
Cindy was.

1090
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:51,520
Ginger, I think.

1091
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,022
That's right. Cindy, ginger...

1092
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,024
Look, he can't
just come right out

1093
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:55,524
and say it.

1094
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,026
He's trying to
tell you something.

1095
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:58,526
I know he is,

1096
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,529
and I think I know what
he's trying to tell me,

1097
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:03,531
but I don't think
he understands.

1098
00:50:03,532 --> 00:50:06,033
What's wrong with him?

1099
00:50:06,034 --> 00:50:08,035
Well, he's...

1100
00:50:08,036 --> 00:50:10,038
He's got the personality
of a pimp.

1101
00:50:11,539 --> 00:50:14,541
That was improper.
I shouldn't have said that.

1102
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:17,543
Ohh, Mr. Hefner,

1103
00:50:17,544 --> 00:50:19,546
that's just the way
he used to dress.

1104
00:50:19,547 --> 00:50:22,548
He doesn't dress
like that anymore.

1105
00:50:28,503 --> 00:50:30,004
Oh, god...

1106
00:50:30,005 --> 00:50:33,007
I am so confused.

1107
00:50:33,008 --> 00:50:36,509
I don't think
anybody understands.

1108
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:38,511
I owe it to him.

1109
00:50:38,512 --> 00:50:39,512
Miss Stratten,

1110
00:50:39,513 --> 00:50:41,014
may I ask you
a personal question?

1111
00:50:41,015 --> 00:50:43,015
36-24-36.

1112
00:50:43,016 --> 00:50:44,515
No. I have that information

1113
00:50:44,516 --> 00:50:45,516
in the press release right here.

1114
00:50:45,517 --> 00:50:48,020
As a matter of fact,
I have it several times.

1115
00:50:48,021 --> 00:50:49,582
I just wanted to know
if you're married.

1116
00:50:51,023 --> 00:50:52,023
Yes.

1117
00:50:52,024 --> 00:50:53,523
I've been married
about 3 months.

1118
00:50:53,524 --> 00:50:54,524
I wonder why you
looked at miss Davis

1119
00:50:54,525 --> 00:50:55,527
when I asked you that.

1120
00:50:56,028 --> 00:50:57,028
No reason.

1121
00:50:57,029 --> 00:50:58,529
No reason? Is he
traveling with you?

1122
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:59,529
No, he's not.

1123
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:00,531
And why is that?

1124
00:51:01,032 --> 00:51:02,533
I'd like miss Stratten
to answer me...

1125
00:51:02,534 --> 00:51:03,533
If she would.

1126
00:51:03,534 --> 00:51:05,534
He's in L.A. working.

1127
00:51:05,535 --> 00:51:07,036
What sort of work does he do?

1128
00:51:07,037 --> 00:51:08,036
He's doing a show.

1129
00:51:08,037 --> 00:51:09,537
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.

1130
00:51:09,538 --> 00:51:11,258
Could you repeat that
again a little louder?

1131
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:14,543
Hal wants to someday be
the first black president

1132
00:51:14,544 --> 00:51:16,044
of the United States!

1133
00:51:16,045 --> 00:51:17,546
Git on down now!

1134
00:51:18,047 --> 00:51:20,047
Show 'em what you can do!

1135
00:51:20,048 --> 00:51:21,048
Whoo!

1136
00:51:21,049 --> 00:51:22,550
Give him a hand! Hal dafoe!

1137
00:51:22,551 --> 00:51:23,551
Whoa!

1138
00:51:26,554 --> 00:51:29,555
This is number 3. This is Mikey!

1139
00:51:29,556 --> 00:51:31,557
Mikey... whoa...

1140
00:51:31,558 --> 00:51:34,060
Loves to read poetry.

1141
00:51:34,061 --> 00:51:38,563
And Mike hopes to someday
meet Olivia Newton-John!

1142
00:51:38,564 --> 00:51:41,066
Oh, stop. Stop it right there.

1143
00:51:41,067 --> 00:51:43,066
Ladies, stop. I think
I see something.

1144
00:51:43,067 --> 00:51:45,570
Michael, you should be
ashamed of yourself.

1145
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:48,072
No padding!

1146
00:51:49,074 --> 00:51:50,574
Now, that's the rules, boys!

1147
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:52,076
No padding!

1148
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:56,579
Now, you turn around,
you bad boy.

1149
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,080
Naughty, naughty.

1150
00:51:58,081 --> 00:51:59,582
Don't ever do that again!

1151
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,583
Here we go with number 5!

1152
00:52:01,584 --> 00:52:03,085
This is dick!

1153
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:06,087
Oh, ladies, let me tell ya,

1154
00:52:06,088 --> 00:52:07,589
dick speaks fluent French!

1155
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:10,091
I found out last night.

1156
00:52:10,092 --> 00:52:13,594
Oh, dicky, show 'em
what you got, baby.

1157
00:52:14,095 --> 00:52:16,595
<i>Voulez-vous coucher
avec moi, dicky?</i>

1158
00:52:16,596 --> 00:52:18,599
What do you think
of dick's dong?

1159
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,102
Hey, ladies, what do you think

1160
00:52:22,602 --> 00:52:27,605
of all of our beautiful,
well-hung, young men?

1161
00:52:27,606 --> 00:52:29,107
Ok, guys...

1162
00:52:29,108 --> 00:52:31,109
5, 6, 7, 8...

1163
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:32,611
Whooo!

1164
00:52:33,112 --> 00:52:36,613
<i>♪ ...Got to know this one thing ♪</i>

1165
00:52:36,614 --> 00:52:38,115

Comes to 874 bucks apiece.

1172
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,633
Sorry, Paul.
Those are the figures.

1173
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,635
I don't understand.
This place was packed.

1174
00:53:03,636 --> 00:53:06,139
Well, they weren't exactly
a bunch of big spenders.

1175
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,142
It was no shriners convention.

1176
00:53:12,645 --> 00:53:14,146
Any projects in the offing,

1177
00:53:14,147 --> 00:53:15,647
any new films?

1178
00:53:15,648 --> 00:53:17,149
Well, when I go
back to Los Angeles,

1179
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,651
I start a movie called
<i>Wednesday's child.</i>

1180
00:53:19,652 --> 00:53:22,653
What's <i>Wednesday's child</i> about?

1181
00:53:22,654 --> 00:53:24,654
Well, you're going to
spend a lot of time

1182
00:53:24,655 --> 00:53:26,657
watching me get
tied up and beaten.

1183
00:53:27,158 --> 00:53:29,159
It's not a classic. Ha ha.

1184
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,159
Sal, will you

1185
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,161
put the pellet
in her mouth, please?

1186
00:53:32,162 --> 00:53:33,663
Careful now. Don't bite it.

1187
00:53:34,164 --> 00:53:35,663
There's a call for you, Dorothy.

1188
00:53:35,664 --> 00:53:37,166
Not now, for Christ's sake.

1189
00:53:37,167 --> 00:53:39,669
All right, put the gun
back up to her face.

1190
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:41,169
He says his line,

1191
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:43,672
you shake you head no. Harder!

1192
00:53:44,173 --> 00:53:46,175
And then he slaps you across
the face with the gun.

1193
00:53:48,176 --> 00:53:49,176
What?

1194
00:53:49,177 --> 00:53:51,178
You bit the pellet.

1195
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:53,680
Ha ha... God damn it!

1196
00:53:53,681 --> 00:53:56,182
What's so funny? Ha ha ha...

1197
00:53:56,183 --> 00:53:58,185
I'm sorry. Clean her up, please.

1198
00:54:00,187 --> 00:54:02,188
Oh, god.

1199
00:54:02,189 --> 00:54:04,190
Should I tell him to call back?

1200
00:54:04,191 --> 00:54:06,691
He's called 3 times.

1201
00:54:06,692 --> 00:54:08,694
Fucking blood pellets.

1202
00:54:09,195 --> 00:54:10,195
Jesus...

1203
00:54:10,196 --> 00:54:11,694
Look, I'm sorry to bother you,

1204
00:54:11,695 --> 00:54:12,697
but I found it.

1205
00:54:12,698 --> 00:54:14,198
It's beautiful.

1206
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:15,199
Paul, listen,

1207
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,202
I don't think this is
a very good time to talk.

1208
00:54:17,702 --> 00:54:18,901
I am sitting here freaking out.

1209
00:54:19,203 --> 00:54:21,703
It's a Paul Snider/
Dorothy Stratten car

1210
00:54:21,704 --> 00:54:23,206
if ever I've seen one.

1211
00:54:23,207 --> 00:54:25,207
But it's a little
more than I figured.

1212
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:26,209
Look, I was wondering,

1213
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:27,709
is there any way

1214
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,211
that you could get
to the bank today?

1215
00:54:29,212 --> 00:54:30,211
I'd like to sign the papers

1216
00:54:30,212 --> 00:54:32,213
before somebody else grabs it.

1217
00:54:32,214 --> 00:54:34,216
We're gonna need another 3,000.

1218
00:54:36,718 --> 00:54:38,219
On your lunch hour maybe?

1219
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,221
We've been spending
a lot of money lately.

1220
00:54:40,222 --> 00:54:41,721
Maybe we should wait.

1221
00:54:41,722 --> 00:54:42,721
There's not a better-looking set

1222
00:54:42,722 --> 00:54:44,723
of wheels in this
whole friggin' town.

1223
00:54:44,724 --> 00:54:46,226
Do you think
it might be possible

1224
00:54:46,227 --> 00:54:48,226
to drag miss Stratten
off the phone

1225
00:54:48,227 --> 00:54:49,229
for a few minutes?

1226
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:50,730
He'll wait.

1227
00:54:51,231 --> 00:54:52,732
I'm gonna get a license plate

1228
00:54:52,733 --> 00:54:55,233
that spells out "STAR 80."

1229
00:54:55,234 --> 00:54:57,735
It's fan-fucking-tastic.

1230
00:54:57,736 --> 00:55:00,738
You know... S-T-A-R 8-0?

1231
00:55:00,739 --> 00:55:01,739
That's you.

1232
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,741
STAR 80.

1233
00:55:04,242 --> 00:55:05,243
Everyone in this town

1234
00:55:05,244 --> 00:55:08,245
is going to know who we are.

1235
00:55:08,246 --> 00:55:10,247
Can you get to the bank?

1236
00:55:12,249 --> 00:55:13,750
Please?

1237
00:55:16,253 --> 00:55:18,753
Ok. Ok, I'll go to the bank.

1238
00:55:18,754 --> 00:55:20,255
That's my queen.

1239
00:55:20,256 --> 00:55:22,257
David... David...

1240
00:55:22,258 --> 00:55:23,757
Would you bring her in here?

1241
00:55:23,758 --> 00:55:24,760
What time do you think
we're gonna finish?

1242
00:55:24,761 --> 00:55:26,260
Late. Very late.

1243
00:55:26,261 --> 00:55:27,760
Late. He said very late.

1244
00:55:27,761 --> 00:55:29,263
If you're not gonna be home,

1245
00:55:29,264 --> 00:55:30,263
I thought I'd like to drop by

1246
00:55:30,264 --> 00:55:31,266
the mansion for a while.

1247
00:55:31,766 --> 00:55:32,764
Can you give him a call

1248
00:55:32,765 --> 00:55:33,765
and fix it for me,

1249
00:55:33,766 --> 00:55:34,768
let him know I'm coming?

1250
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:37,270
Dorothy, is that all right?

1251
00:55:37,271 --> 00:55:38,772
Mm-hmm.

1252
00:55:39,273 --> 00:55:41,240
Damn, I wish he
wouldn't call me here.

1253
00:55:41,241 --> 00:55:43,493
All right.

1254
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:49,997
It's a Sci-Fi.

1255
00:55:49,998 --> 00:55:53,000
She, uh, she plays a robot.

1256
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:54,502
Get in there, you mother.

1257
00:55:54,503 --> 00:55:56,503
They offered us 10,000.

1258
00:55:56,504 --> 00:55:59,506
Well, I put a stop
to that but fast.

1259
00:55:59,507 --> 00:56:01,007
Startin' it

1260
00:56:01,008 --> 00:56:04,009
right after we finish
<i>Wednesday's Child.</i>

1261
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:06,012
She is so beautiful.

1262
00:56:06,513 --> 00:56:09,015
You can just tell she's
Mr. Hefner's favorite.

1263
00:56:09,016 --> 00:56:11,015
She's the best.

1264
00:56:11,016 --> 00:56:13,017
The best.

1265
00:56:13,018 --> 00:56:15,520
You're pretty good-
looking yourself, Bobo.

1266
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:17,020
I'm all right.

1267
00:56:17,021 --> 00:56:19,023
Hi, Lonni.

1268
00:56:23,027 --> 00:56:27,030
<i>♪ Because you had ♪
♪ to be a big shot, didn't ya? ♪</i>

1269
00:56:27,031 --> 00:56:29,482
<i>♪ You had to open up your mouth ♪</i>

1270
00:56:29,983 --> 00:56:30,982
Where's Dorothy?

1271
00:56:30,983 --> 00:56:32,983
Working. She called
and asked if it was ok

1272
00:56:32,984 --> 00:56:33,986
for him to come over.

1273
00:56:34,487 --> 00:56:36,989
I just couldn't say no to her.

1274
00:56:38,991 --> 00:56:40,992
Oh, hi, hef.

1275
00:56:41,493 --> 00:56:42,993
Hi, hef.

1276
00:56:42,994 --> 00:56:46,497
<i>♪ You had to have ♪
♪ a white-hot spotlight ♪</i>

1277
00:56:46,498 --> 00:56:48,997
<i>♪ You had to be ♪

1278
00:56:48,998 --> 00:56:50,000
You know, that reminds me.

1279
00:56:50,001 --> 00:56:52,001
I got to talk to him later.

1280
00:56:52,002 --> 00:56:54,503
I got an idea for
a poster with Dorothy.

1281
00:56:54,504 --> 00:56:56,505
Damn.

1282
00:56:56,506 --> 00:56:57,507
Oh...

1283
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:02,010
Want to get something to eat?

1284
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:04,011
I'm always hungry.

1285
00:57:04,012 --> 00:57:07,015
Does it look like
I'm gaining weight?

1286
00:57:08,016 --> 00:57:12,519
Well, I, uh,
first met Mr. Snider

1287
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,021
at the Playboy mansion.

1288
00:57:15,022 --> 00:57:16,522
Snider, Paul. Hi.

1289
00:57:16,523 --> 00:57:18,023
Martin Gebber.

1290
00:57:18,024 --> 00:57:20,026
We were just going
to feed our face.

1291
00:57:20,027 --> 00:57:21,527
Would you join us?

1292
00:57:21,528 --> 00:57:22,528
Sure.

1293
00:57:22,529 --> 00:57:24,029
Practice here, Dr. Gebber?

1294
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:25,531
Uh, Geb, please.

1295
00:57:26,031 --> 00:57:29,033
No, Newport Beach,
but I plan to move here.

1296
00:57:29,034 --> 00:57:30,535
Internist?

1297
00:57:30,536 --> 00:57:32,035
Plastic surgery.

1298
00:57:32,036 --> 00:57:33,035
Cosmetic mostly.

1299
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:35,539
Paul is married
to Dorothy Stratten.

1300
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,040
He also manages her.

1301
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:38,041
The chicken.

1302
00:57:38,042 --> 00:57:39,542
He told me he and Dorothy

1303
00:57:39,543 --> 00:57:41,545
were looking for
a new place to live.

1304
00:57:41,546 --> 00:57:45,048
And maybe since I was
moving my practice to L.A.,

1305
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:48,550
we could find a place together,

1306
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:50,051
share expenses.

1307
00:57:50,052 --> 00:57:52,554
We moved in in October,

1308
00:57:52,555 --> 00:57:54,053
and I took the top half,

1309
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:55,556
they lived on the first floor.

1310
00:57:55,557 --> 00:57:57,058
It was right near the freeway,

1311
00:57:57,059 --> 00:57:58,559
noisy as hell.

1312
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,561
But it suited me fine.

1313
00:57:59,562 --> 00:58:01,561
It had a yard for king,

1314
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,563
a garage for my Rolls-Royce.

1315
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:06,566
The Rolls
is an investment for me.

1316
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:08,567
It's an investment.

1317
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:12,571
I'm not into status symbols
like most people out here.

1318
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,573
It's an investment, ok?

1319
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:17,575
Dorothy had already
done the centerfold,

1320
00:58:17,576 --> 00:58:19,076
miss August.

1321
00:58:19,077 --> 00:58:23,081
She had already done parts
in <i>Fantasy Island</i>

1322
00:58:23,581 --> 00:58:26,082
and <i>Buck Rogers.</i>

1323
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:27,584
Things were moving fast for her.

1324
00:58:28,085 --> 00:58:29,586
I became very fond of her.

1325
00:58:30,087 --> 00:58:32,588
She was handling her public
visibility very well.

1326
00:58:32,589 --> 00:58:34,088
She was maturing
very fast for 19,

1327
00:58:34,089 --> 00:58:36,092
but to me,
she was just a friend.

1328
00:58:36,093 --> 00:58:37,593
Understand?

1329
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:38,593
A friend.

1330
00:58:38,594 --> 00:58:40,478
I had a gal...

1331
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:41,979
Robin.

1332
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,482
I stayed with her
most of the time,

1333
00:58:44,483 --> 00:58:47,985
so I didn't spend much time
at the house.

1334
00:58:48,486 --> 00:58:50,486
But we'd get together
once in a while...

1335
00:58:50,487 --> 00:58:53,490
Sunday afternoon barbecue
with a few friends.

1336
00:58:53,491 --> 00:58:54,490
Paul, did you

1337
00:58:54,491 --> 00:58:55,992
make this contraption yourself?

1338
00:58:55,993 --> 00:58:56,992
12 of them.

1339
00:58:56,993 --> 00:58:59,495
Who are you selling them to?

1340
00:58:59,496 --> 00:59:02,497
To anybody who wants to buy one.

1341
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:04,998
She's got no real
competition, you know.

1342
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,000
Oh, what about miss December?

1343
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,000
Vicki something?

1344
00:59:08,001 --> 00:59:10,002
Next to Dorothy? You're kidding.

1345
00:59:10,003 --> 00:59:11,003
Where do you want me to put it?

1346
00:59:11,004 --> 00:59:14,006
In the garage, with all
the other "no sales."

1347
00:59:14,007 --> 00:59:15,508
You should buy
one of those, Nick.

1348
00:59:15,509 --> 00:59:18,510
If Hefner has sense at all,
it will be Dorothy.

1349
00:59:18,511 --> 00:59:20,514
There's nobody else
in the same class.

1350
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,515
Has to be.

1351
00:59:22,516 --> 00:59:25,517
Then you can all
visit us in bel air.

1352
00:59:25,518 --> 00:59:28,520
Do you hear that? What?

1353
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:29,522
You're moving to bel air.

1354
00:59:29,523 --> 00:59:32,022
Oh, yeah, sure. When?

1355
00:59:32,023 --> 00:59:34,025
When you become
Playmate of the year.

1356
00:59:34,026 --> 00:59:35,526
Get out of here.

1357
00:59:35,527 --> 00:59:38,027
No, I'm with him. I think

1358
00:59:38,028 --> 00:59:40,530
you're gonna be Playmate
of the year, too.

1359
00:59:40,531 --> 00:59:41,532
What the hell is this?

1360
00:59:42,032 --> 00:59:43,033
What is it?

1361
00:59:43,534 --> 00:59:44,533
I know what that is.

1362
00:59:44,534 --> 00:59:46,536
I saw that in a shop
on Santa Monica.

1363
00:59:46,537 --> 00:59:47,520
Oh, my god!

1364
00:59:49,489 --> 00:59:51,989
Now, don't tell us
that's for exercise, Paul.

1365
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,992
I think I know what it's for.

1366
00:59:53,993 --> 00:59:54,992
So do I.

1367
00:59:54,993 --> 00:59:56,995
What is it?
Somebody tell me. What?

1368
00:59:56,996 --> 00:59:57,995
Well...

1369
00:59:57,996 --> 00:59:59,497
Tell her.

1370
00:59:59,498 --> 01:00:01,999
Ask the man who built it.

1371
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:13,510
I only made it as a joke.

1372
01:00:31,525 --> 01:00:34,026
What did I do wrong?

1373
01:00:34,027 --> 01:00:36,529
I did everything you did.

1374
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:38,029
Somebody tell me, huh?

1375
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:40,031
What I did wrong?

1376
01:00:40,032 --> 01:00:42,534
You rotten fuckers!

1377
01:01:36,881 --> 01:01:37,881
Ooh!

1378
01:01:37,882 --> 01:01:38,883
Ah!

1379
01:02:07,908 --> 01:02:08,909
Hi, Aram.

1380
01:02:12,913 --> 01:02:14,912
Who's the girl in the red cap?

1381
01:02:14,913 --> 01:02:16,415
Ah. That's Dorothy Stratten.

1382
01:02:16,416 --> 01:02:18,418
Why don't you put her
in your picture, Aram?

1383
01:02:18,419 --> 01:02:20,419
No. Huh?

1384
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:21,919
I need a real actress.

1385
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,421
Let her read. You'll see.

1386
01:02:23,422 --> 01:02:24,922
Who handles her?

1387
01:02:24,923 --> 01:02:26,924
Peter Rose, Rose and matz.

1388
01:02:26,925 --> 01:02:28,925
Only deal with Peter.

1389
01:02:28,926 --> 01:02:30,427
Why?

1390
01:02:30,428 --> 01:02:31,929
I'll tell you another time.

1391
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:33,931
Nice to see you, Aram.

1392
01:02:42,939 --> 01:02:44,938
It'll be a big picture...
5-6 million.

1393
01:02:44,939 --> 01:02:46,441
I hear he's got Newman.

1394
01:02:46,442 --> 01:02:48,943
I wish I knew
some of his pictures.

1395
01:02:48,944 --> 01:02:50,945
<i>Time step?</i> Did you
ever see <i>time step?</i>

1396
01:02:50,946 --> 01:02:51,945
No.

1397
01:02:51,946 --> 01:02:53,447
<i>The last chase?</i>

1398
01:02:53,448 --> 01:02:55,950
No. If it comes up,
should I lie?

1399
01:02:58,452 --> 01:02:59,952
No, I don't think so.

1400
01:02:59,953 --> 01:03:01,953
Just be yourself,
and you'll be fine.

1401
01:03:01,954 --> 01:03:03,957
You've got a quality,
Dorothy. Hef spotted it,

1402
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:06,458
and I'm sure Aram will, too.

1403
01:03:06,459 --> 01:03:08,461
Oh, Peter, that's agent talk.

1404
01:03:08,961 --> 01:03:10,462
That's friend talk.

1405
01:03:12,965 --> 01:03:14,465
Well, here we are.

1406
01:03:15,467 --> 01:03:16,468
Gulp.

1407
01:03:16,968 --> 01:03:17,568
I'll wait here.

1408
01:03:17,969 --> 01:03:18,849
It shouldn't take long.

1409
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:19,970
Ok.

1410
01:03:19,971 --> 01:03:23,473
<i>Time step</i>
and <i>the last chase,</i> right?

1411
01:03:23,474 --> 01:03:24,975
Right.

1412
01:03:31,981 --> 01:03:34,983
A girl can't just
sit back and say,

1413
01:03:34,984 --> 01:03:37,485
well, now my photos have
been seen all over the world

1414
01:03:37,986 --> 01:03:38,986
in <i>Playboy,</i>

1415
01:03:38,987 --> 01:03:40,989
and I'm sure many producers
and directors

1416
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:42,490
have seen my pictures,

1417
01:03:42,491 --> 01:03:44,492
and if they like me,
they'll call me.

1418
01:03:44,493 --> 01:03:46,993
It just doesn't work that way.

1419
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:48,495
So you still
have to go out there

1420
01:03:48,496 --> 01:03:49,497
and seek opportunity?

1421
01:03:49,498 --> 01:03:50,497
Absolutely.

1422
01:03:54,501 --> 01:03:58,003
Don't be nervous.
He's really very nice.

1423
01:04:04,009 --> 01:04:05,009
Hi.

1424
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:06,009
Hi.

1425
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,511
I'm Aram.

1426
01:04:07,512 --> 01:04:08,512
I'm Dorothy.

1427
01:04:08,513 --> 01:04:10,013
Yeah, I know.

1428
01:04:10,014 --> 01:04:11,515
Uh...

1429
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:17,020
You nervous?

1430
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:19,021
Yes.

1431
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:20,522
Yeah, so am I.

1432
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,029
Well, do you know
anything about me?

1433
01:04:27,529 --> 01:04:29,531
<i>Time Step</i> was wonderful.

1434
01:04:31,032 --> 01:04:33,534
Uh, that's <i>The Last Chase.</i>

1435
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:36,035
You didn't see <i>Time Step,</i>
did you?

1436
01:04:36,036 --> 01:04:38,538
No, but I'm going to.

1437
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:43,041
Would you like to see
some of my pictures?

1438
01:04:43,042 --> 01:04:45,044
No.

1439
01:04:48,047 --> 01:04:49,548
Should I read for you?

1440
01:04:49,549 --> 01:04:51,550
Uh...

1441
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:53,551
No. No.

1442
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:02,593
Aram says it's
going to be a closed set

1443
01:05:02,594 --> 01:05:04,593
and a very tight schedule.

1444
01:05:04,594 --> 01:05:07,597
He says we'll be working
really long days...

1445
01:05:08,098 --> 01:05:10,099
14, 16 hours.

1446
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,601
I know New York.

1447
01:05:12,101 --> 01:05:16,604
We wouldn't have that much time
to see each other.

1448
01:05:16,605 --> 01:05:20,608
I could really help you there.

1449
01:05:25,113 --> 01:05:26,612
Something is screwy, Dorothy.

1450
01:05:26,613 --> 01:05:28,114
Something else is going on here.

1451
01:05:28,115 --> 01:05:29,615
I can feel it.

1452
01:05:29,616 --> 01:05:32,118
Aram says I'm going to need

1453
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:34,120
every bit of concentration.

1454
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:35,620
He did, huh?

1455
01:05:35,621 --> 01:05:38,123
Aram says this,
and Aram says that.

1456
01:05:38,124 --> 01:05:40,126
Will you stop with
the fucking Aram!

1457
01:05:40,626 --> 01:05:43,127
Aram is a very nice man.

1458
01:05:43,128 --> 01:05:45,629
Oh, shit!
They're all nice to you!

1459
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:47,631
"Everybody is wonderful.

1460
01:05:47,632 --> 01:05:49,133
Mr. Hefner is wonderful."

1461
01:05:49,134 --> 01:05:52,136
The whole fucking world
is wonderful to you!

1462
01:05:52,137 --> 01:05:54,138
Well, fuck Aram!

1463
01:06:00,143 --> 01:06:02,144
Or maybe you have already.

1464
01:06:02,145 --> 01:06:03,645
Oh, Paul...

1465
01:06:03,646 --> 01:06:05,645
I mean, maybe that's
what this is all about,

1466
01:06:05,646 --> 01:06:07,649
huh? Maybe that's
what has been going on

1467
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:10,152
at those rehearsals
up at his house.

1468
01:06:11,153 --> 01:06:12,652
Did you fuck him?

1469
01:06:12,653 --> 01:06:14,655
Is that how you got the part?

1470
01:06:14,656 --> 01:06:17,657
That's how it's done,
out here, isn't it?

1471
01:06:22,662 --> 01:06:26,165
That's really unfair.

1472
01:06:26,665 --> 01:06:27,666
<i>It may sound corny,</i>

1473
01:06:27,667 --> 01:06:31,169
<i>but I have to concentrate
my love on just one man.</i>

1474
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:32,330
<i>I'm faithful.</i>

1475
01:06:36,674 --> 01:06:37,674
God,

1476
01:06:37,675 --> 01:06:40,678
I'm such a jerk sometimes.

1477
01:06:45,682 --> 01:06:48,184
I'm sorry.

1478
01:06:48,185 --> 01:06:49,684
I'm so sorry.

1479
01:06:49,685 --> 01:06:52,187
I do understand.

1480
01:06:53,689 --> 01:06:55,190
It's...

1481
01:06:55,191 --> 01:06:59,693
It's just that I
love you so damn much.

1482
01:06:59,694 --> 01:07:04,697
Paul, let's go back
to Vancouver.

1483
01:07:04,698 --> 01:07:06,700
I don't have to do this movie.

1484
01:07:06,701 --> 01:07:08,701
I'm afraid.

1485
01:07:08,702 --> 01:07:10,203
Of what?

1486
01:07:10,204 --> 01:07:13,205
I don't know.

1487
01:07:13,206 --> 01:07:15,707
It was nice in Vancouver.

1488
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:17,709
Please, let's go back.

1489
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:19,711
Angel, we can't go back.

1490
01:07:20,212 --> 01:07:22,214
We'd lose all the contacts
we've made here.

1491
01:07:22,215 --> 01:07:24,716
Please.

1492
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:30,220
No.

1493
01:07:31,722 --> 01:07:34,223
Uh-uh.

1494
01:07:34,224 --> 01:07:38,727
But, I have this terrific idea.

1495
01:07:38,728 --> 01:07:40,728
I'm your manager, right?

1496
01:07:40,729 --> 01:07:42,230
Well, as your manager,

1497
01:07:42,231 --> 01:07:44,233
I think you should
go to New York

1498
01:07:44,234 --> 01:07:46,234
and become a big movie star.

1499
01:07:46,235 --> 01:07:47,734
I'll stay here and work

1500
01:07:47,735 --> 01:07:49,236
on the Dorothy Stratten poster.

1501
01:07:49,237 --> 01:07:51,738
It's gonna make us a fortune.

1502
01:07:51,739 --> 01:07:54,241
Good idea?

1503
01:07:54,242 --> 01:07:57,244
It came to me just like that.

1504
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:01,748
Hey.

1505
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:06,752
You're my queen.

1506
01:08:09,755 --> 01:08:13,257
I don't know. He seemed in
exceptionally good spirits

1507
01:08:13,258 --> 01:08:15,260
just before she left,

1508
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,762
helping her with this and that,

1509
01:08:17,763 --> 01:08:19,762
being really attentive.

1510
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:21,264
Gave her a going-away party.

1511
01:08:21,265 --> 01:08:22,766
Must have cost a fortune.

1512
01:08:22,767 --> 01:08:26,268
Borrowed my rolls
to drive her to the airport.

1513
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,771
Said, "the queen
has to go in style."

1514
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,273
And after she left,

1515
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:33,275
he came back here to the house.

1516
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:34,276
And then...

1517
01:08:35,777 --> 01:08:38,279
Then he did the damnedest thing.

1518
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,781
I'm still not sure
why he did it,

1519
01:08:41,782 --> 01:08:45,285
but he built
a doghouse for king.

1520
01:08:45,286 --> 01:08:46,786
A beautiful doghouse.

1521
01:08:46,787 --> 01:08:49,288
Craziest thing.

1522
01:08:49,289 --> 01:08:51,758
I didn't think he even knew
I had a dog.

1523
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:53,960
Yeah, move, Caroline.

1524
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:57,461
Ok. Yeah, come. Give me more.

1525
01:08:57,462 --> 01:08:58,963
Come in a little further.

1526
01:08:58,964 --> 01:09:00,463
Yeah, hold that, hold that.

1527
01:09:00,464 --> 01:09:01,966
Yeah, Mark it. Mark it.

1528
01:09:01,967 --> 01:09:03,968
Take a look, Gary.

1529
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:06,970
Is that ok?

1530
01:09:06,971 --> 01:09:07,972
That's nice.

1531
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,480
You shouldn't chew gum.

1532
01:09:18,481 --> 01:09:19,981
It's got sugar in it.

1533
01:09:26,988 --> 01:09:29,489
Thank you.

1534
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:31,992
It's him. I know it.

1535
01:09:31,993 --> 01:09:33,491
I can tell from the way

1536
01:09:33,492 --> 01:09:34,994
she says his name on the phone.

1537
01:09:34,995 --> 01:09:35,994
And what does she say?

1538
01:09:35,995 --> 01:09:37,497
Not too much. She always says

1539
01:09:37,998 --> 01:09:40,497
she's been working
on Aram's film all day

1540
01:09:40,498 --> 01:09:42,000
and doesn't feel like talking.

1541
01:09:42,001 --> 01:09:43,502
Why can't you accept that?

1542
01:09:43,503 --> 01:09:45,003
She calls it film.

1543
01:09:45,004 --> 01:09:46,505
Christ, she never
said "film" before.

1544
01:09:46,506 --> 01:09:49,006
She always said
movie or picture,

1545
01:09:49,007 --> 01:09:50,508
but never film.

1546
01:09:51,509 --> 01:09:54,510
I bet he calls it film.

1547
01:09:54,511 --> 01:09:56,012
That's hardly sufficient cause

1548
01:09:56,013 --> 01:09:57,514
to put yourself
through all this.

1549
01:09:57,515 --> 01:10:00,516
He's feeding her coke.

1550
01:10:00,517 --> 01:10:03,518
Paul, I know you're upset,

1551
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:05,020
but you shouldn't even say that.

1552
01:10:05,021 --> 01:10:07,023
And knowing Dorothy, I doubt it.

1553
01:10:07,024 --> 01:10:08,023
You're wrong.

1554
01:10:08,024 --> 01:10:10,023
Yeah? She kept
sniffing last night...

1555
01:10:11,526 --> 01:10:14,028
Through the whole conversation
she kept sniffing.

1556
01:10:14,029 --> 01:10:16,030
Maybe she's got a cold.

1557
01:10:16,031 --> 01:10:18,031
Yeah, that's what she said.

1558
01:10:18,032 --> 01:10:19,532
Cold, my ass!

1559
01:10:19,533 --> 01:10:21,533
Paul, you're gonna
make yourself loony

1560
01:10:21,534 --> 01:10:23,036
if you keep going like this.

1561
01:10:23,537 --> 01:10:24,537
You got to realize,

1562
01:10:24,538 --> 01:10:27,039
Dorothy is every man's fantasy.

1563
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,539
Everybody who sees her,

1564
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:30,042
or even her picture
in a magazine,

1565
01:10:30,043 --> 01:10:31,543
for that matter,

1566
01:10:31,544 --> 01:10:33,044
is going to be coming after her.

1567
01:10:33,045 --> 01:10:35,047
And there's always
gonna be someone

1568
01:10:35,048 --> 01:10:39,549
who's richer than you,
more famous than you,

1569
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:42,052
has a longer penis than you,

1570
01:10:42,053 --> 01:10:44,053
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

1571
01:10:44,054 --> 01:10:45,554
She's not herself, man!

1572
01:10:45,555 --> 01:10:47,555
Look, I know these guys, geb.

1573
01:10:47,556 --> 01:10:49,058
They stick a little coke
up a girl's nose,

1574
01:10:49,059 --> 01:10:50,058
they figure she'll do anything.

1575
01:10:50,059 --> 01:10:53,063
Jesus, you haven't heard
one word I've said.

1576
01:10:53,064 --> 01:10:57,066
Look, all you can do is
let her know you love her.

1577
01:10:57,566 --> 01:10:59,067
Get your own feet on the ground.

1578
01:10:59,068 --> 01:11:00,568
Stop complaining!

1579
01:11:00,569 --> 01:11:02,069
Go out and get yourself a job,

1580
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:03,071
get something going,

1581
01:11:03,571 --> 01:11:05,573
and try to make her
proud of you!

1582
01:11:07,075 --> 01:11:09,075
I know it.

1583
01:11:09,076 --> 01:11:11,078
You're right.

1584
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,081
I can handle this.

1585
01:11:15,082 --> 01:11:16,581
I can handle it.

1586
01:11:16,582 --> 01:11:19,084
What kind of business
are you in?

1587
01:11:19,085 --> 01:11:21,085
Well, I was thinking
in terms of a health spa.

1588
01:11:21,086 --> 01:11:24,089
You know who Dorothy Stratten
is, don't you?

1589
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:25,089
I think so.

1590
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:26,091
Well, that's my wife,

1591
01:11:26,591 --> 01:11:27,590
and I'm her personal manager...

1592
01:11:27,591 --> 01:11:28,912
I was thinking of calling it

1593
01:11:29,094 --> 01:11:30,093
"Dorothy Stratten's health spa."

1594
01:11:30,094 --> 01:11:32,094
All modern equipment...
Nautilus, steam, sauna.

1595
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,098
You know, they're into
that sort of thing out here.

1596
01:11:34,598 --> 01:11:36,099
You just give them
white teeth, a suntan,

1597
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,599
and some muscles,
and bang! You're a hit.

1598
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,603
I saw a hot location
on Santa Monica.

1599
01:11:41,104 --> 01:11:42,103
The real estate woman

1600
01:11:42,104 --> 01:11:44,107
said the owner
wants 2,500 a month,

1601
01:11:44,607 --> 01:11:47,609
but she's pretty sure
it'll come down.

1602
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:49,111
What do you think?

1603
01:11:53,115 --> 01:11:55,616
Something wrong, Dorothy?

1604
01:11:57,118 --> 01:11:58,618
No.

1605
01:11:58,619 --> 01:12:02,121
Well, what do you think?

1606
01:12:03,123 --> 01:12:04,623
It sounds ok.

1607
01:12:04,624 --> 01:12:05,625
You don't like it.

1608
01:12:06,126 --> 01:12:07,526
I can tell by the tone
of your voice

1609
01:12:07,627 --> 01:12:09,627
you don't like it. Shit!

1610
01:12:09,628 --> 01:12:12,130
Paul, do you think
we could talk tomorrow?

1611
01:12:12,131 --> 01:12:14,633
I'm really tired, I guess.

1612
01:12:17,135 --> 01:12:19,137
Yeah, sure. Uh...

1613
01:12:19,637 --> 01:12:21,638
Listen...

1614
01:12:21,639 --> 01:12:24,140
I called a couple
of times last night.

1615
01:12:24,141 --> 01:12:26,643
Did, uh, you get
any of my messages?

1616
01:12:27,144 --> 01:12:30,146
Yes, I did,
but we worked very late.

1617
01:12:30,147 --> 01:12:31,146
How late?

1618
01:12:31,147 --> 01:12:33,148
I don't remember exactly.

1619
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:34,649
I was with Peggy.

1620
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,151
Peggy Johnson.

1621
01:12:36,152 --> 01:12:37,153
Who's Peggy Johnson?

1622
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:39,652
She's an actress.
She's in the film, too.

1623
01:12:39,653 --> 01:12:40,655
You'd like her.
She's really nice.

1624
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:41,655
Film.

1625
01:12:41,656 --> 01:12:43,157
Anyway, we've become friends,

1626
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:45,159
and it got so late

1627
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,159
that I spent the night
at her apartment.

1628
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,662
I didn't want to wake you.

1629
01:12:48,663 --> 01:12:50,663
I thought you'd be sleeping.

1630
01:12:50,664 --> 01:12:53,165
I'm staying at Nancy's house.

1631
01:12:54,668 --> 01:12:57,669
I guess you didn't
want to wake me.

1632
01:12:57,670 --> 01:12:59,171
Paul, I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you.

1633
01:12:59,672 --> 01:13:01,672
Nothing. It was nothing.

1634
01:13:01,673 --> 01:13:05,676
So, uh, how are things
going on the set?

1635
01:13:05,677 --> 01:13:07,178
Are you, uh,

1636
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,180
getting along all right
with the director?

1637
01:13:10,181 --> 01:13:12,183
Because I think it's important

1638
01:13:12,184 --> 01:13:14,684
that an actress and her director

1639
01:13:14,685 --> 01:13:17,687
should have a good relationship.

1640
01:13:19,856 --> 01:13:21,858
There must be something
you can do,

1641
01:13:22,359 --> 01:13:24,360
for Christ's sake.
He's stealing my wife.

1642
01:13:24,361 --> 01:13:25,861
Can't we sue him?

1643
01:13:26,362 --> 01:13:27,861
Can't we make the bastard pay?

1644
01:13:27,862 --> 01:13:28,864
Pay for something.

1645
01:13:28,865 --> 01:13:30,864
Sue? For what?

1646
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:32,366
For what?

1647
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:33,867
You're the detective.

1648
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,369
You're supposed to be able

1649
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:36,871
to tell me for what.

1650
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:39,872
Are you her manager?

1651
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:40,873
Yes.

1652
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:43,877
Got any contracts, any papers?

1653
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,881
No, but...

1654
01:13:49,882 --> 01:13:51,383
But it was something
you both talked about, right?

1655
01:13:51,384 --> 01:13:52,882
It was understood, right?

1656
01:13:52,883 --> 01:13:54,385
Yes. It was understood.

1657
01:13:54,386 --> 01:13:56,886
You had a verbal contract,
then, right?

1658
01:13:56,887 --> 01:13:58,407
That's right, we had
a verbal contract.

1659
01:13:58,890 --> 01:13:59,890
We're a team.

1660
01:14:00,391 --> 01:14:01,392
I discovered her.

1661
01:14:01,892 --> 01:14:03,393
Yeah, I know. You said that.

1662
01:14:03,894 --> 01:14:05,395
Well, maybe...

1663
01:14:05,896 --> 01:14:08,898
Maybe we can try
suing him for enticement

1664
01:14:09,399 --> 01:14:12,401
to breach her management
contract with you.

1665
01:14:12,402 --> 01:14:13,902
Yeah, that's it.

1666
01:14:13,903 --> 01:14:15,403
Not so fast. I'm not a lawyer.

1667
01:14:15,904 --> 01:14:16,903
I'd have to check with one.

1668
01:14:16,904 --> 01:14:19,407
I know we'd have to have
documentation.

1669
01:14:19,408 --> 01:14:22,409
I'd like to kill
the son of a bitch.

1670
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:24,411
I can't help you with that.

1671
01:14:24,412 --> 01:14:26,914
He called me 5 times last night.

1672
01:14:26,915 --> 01:14:28,915
I didn't get any sleep.

1673
01:14:28,916 --> 01:14:31,417
That's why I kept
missing my Mark.

1674
01:14:31,418 --> 01:14:33,919
We'll get it after lunch.

1675
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,422
I don't know why
I feel this loyalty to him.

1676
01:14:37,423 --> 01:14:39,924
He's fooling around. I know it.

1677
01:14:39,925 --> 01:14:41,926
He's got other women.

1678
01:14:41,927 --> 01:14:42,927
He always has.

1679
01:14:42,928 --> 01:14:45,429
At about 3:00 in the morning,

1680
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:47,430
every fucking creep on the strip

1681
01:14:47,431 --> 01:14:48,931
seems to wind up at our joint.

1682
01:14:48,932 --> 01:14:50,434
He didn't look any different

1683
01:14:50,935 --> 01:14:52,435
from any other schmuck
in this town,

1684
01:14:52,436 --> 01:14:53,437
but he talked nicer.

1685
01:14:53,438 --> 01:14:55,938
He said he could
get me in <i>Playboy,</i>

1686
01:14:55,939 --> 01:14:57,440
that he knew hef.

1687
01:14:57,441 --> 01:14:58,942
Said he could get me
in the movies.

1688
01:14:59,442 --> 01:15:02,945
He had a business card
and a Mercedes 450 sl,

1689
01:15:03,446 --> 01:15:05,448
so what the fuck?

1690
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:10,450
What about the health club idea?

1691
01:15:10,451 --> 01:15:12,454
He couldn't get
any backing for it.

1692
01:15:12,954 --> 01:15:15,455
No one would give him any money.

1693
01:15:17,458 --> 01:15:18,959
What?

1694
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,961
Say it.

1695
01:15:22,462 --> 01:15:23,961
Well, I just don't think

1696
01:15:23,962 --> 01:15:24,964
you should lend your name

1697
01:15:25,465 --> 01:15:27,465
to something like that...
A health club...

1698
01:15:27,466 --> 01:15:28,967
With him or anyone else.

1699
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:33,471
The more he fails,

1700
01:15:33,472 --> 01:15:35,973
the more he seems
to hang on to me.

1701
01:15:35,974 --> 01:15:37,974
Yeah, this is Paul Snider.

1702
01:15:37,975 --> 01:15:38,976
I've been trying
to get through to hef...

1703
01:15:38,977 --> 01:15:40,477
Snider.

1704
01:15:40,478 --> 01:15:42,978
Mr. Hefner is out of town.
Can I help you?

1705
01:15:42,979 --> 01:15:44,979
Who is this?
Who am I talking to?

1706
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:46,482
I'm Roy, Mr. Hefner's assistant.

1707
01:15:46,483 --> 01:15:49,985
Oh. Well, listen, Roy,
here's what it is.

1708
01:15:49,986 --> 01:15:50,987
I'd like to drop by
the mansion tonight

1709
01:15:51,487 --> 01:15:52,486
and talk to hef.

1710
01:15:52,487 --> 01:15:54,488
I've already
told you... yeah, right. He's out of town.

1711
01:15:54,489 --> 01:15:57,991
Oh, shit. I should've known
you were bullshitting me.

1712
01:15:57,992 --> 01:15:59,493
There is someone
I'd like him to see.

1713
01:15:59,494 --> 01:16:01,496
Would you maybe leave my
name at the gate, Roy?

1714
01:16:01,996 --> 01:16:03,497
I'm very sorry, I can't do that.

1715
01:16:03,498 --> 01:16:04,999
Only Mr. Hefner himself
can do that.

1716
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,498
Aw, sure you can, Roy.

1717
01:16:06,499 --> 01:16:09,000
I know it's done.
It's done all the time.

1718
01:16:09,001 --> 01:16:10,503
Come on, give it a try.

1719
01:16:10,504 --> 01:16:12,003
Hey, we've met, haven't we, Roy?

1720
01:16:12,004 --> 01:16:13,164
I was probably with Dorothy...

1721
01:16:13,507 --> 01:16:14,187
Dorothy Stratten?

1722
01:16:14,507 --> 01:16:15,508
I know who you are,
but I can't help you.

1723
01:16:16,008 --> 01:16:17,329
I will leave
your message, though.

1724
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:18,511
Ok, sport, leave the message.

1725
01:16:18,512 --> 01:16:20,011
I'll call back later.

1726
01:16:20,012 --> 01:16:21,512
What the fuck is this?

1727
01:16:21,513 --> 01:16:23,515
I bet you don't
even know Hefner.

1728
01:16:23,516 --> 01:16:24,515
What time

1729
01:16:24,516 --> 01:16:26,015
would be a good time
to call back?

1730
01:16:26,016 --> 01:16:27,018
I really couldn't tell you.

1731
01:16:27,019 --> 01:16:30,019
No. Well, I didn't
think you could.

1732
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:33,022
Thanks for all your help, Roy.

1733
01:16:33,023 --> 01:16:34,524
You're welcome.

1734
01:16:36,025 --> 01:16:38,527
Are we or aren't we going?

1735
01:16:38,528 --> 01:16:39,529
That son of a bitch

1736
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:41,530
was there the whole time.

1737
01:16:46,418 --> 01:16:48,920
Do you want to stay with him?

1738
01:16:51,422 --> 01:16:55,425
Do you want to leave him?

1739
01:16:55,426 --> 01:16:57,428
What do you want to do?

1740
01:16:59,429 --> 01:17:02,430
I think you're going to
need some legal help.

1741
01:17:02,431 --> 01:17:04,434
You should probably
talk to a lawyer.

1742
01:17:10,939 --> 01:17:13,941
Dorothy, you just can't
let him do this to you.

1743
01:17:13,942 --> 01:17:16,443
He's got to give you
more freedom.

1744
01:17:24,451 --> 01:17:26,452
You got to understand,

1745
01:17:26,453 --> 01:17:27,953
you're just not the same girl

1746
01:17:27,954 --> 01:17:30,455
you were in Vancouver.

1747
01:17:30,456 --> 01:17:33,958
You've grown. You've matured.

1748
01:17:33,959 --> 01:17:37,461
I see it happening
right before my eyes,

1749
01:17:37,462 --> 01:17:39,963
every day.

1750
01:17:39,964 --> 01:17:42,466
You're unique, Dorothy.

1751
01:17:42,966 --> 01:17:46,469
And you have a unique gift.

1752
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:51,473
You've grown, and
he stayed the same.

1753
01:17:51,474 --> 01:17:53,476
<i>Hollywood hasn't changed my values</i>

1754
01:17:53,477 --> 01:17:55,477
<i>or my personality,</i>

1755
01:17:55,478 --> 01:17:58,479
<i>but it's certainly
made me wiser.</i>

1756
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:02,484
<i>I think I've gained 5 years
experience in 18 months.</i>

1757
01:18:03,985 --> 01:18:06,486
You've outgrown him.

1758
01:18:06,487 --> 01:18:08,988
This is a little rough.

1759
01:18:08,989 --> 01:18:11,991
Are you sure
you want to hear it?

1760
01:18:11,992 --> 01:18:12,991
Ok.

1761
01:18:12,992 --> 01:18:15,993
"She's practically
moved out of the wyndham.

1762
01:18:15,994 --> 01:18:17,496
"She usually goes there
after shooting,

1763
01:18:17,497 --> 01:18:18,997
"picks up messages,

1764
01:18:18,998 --> 01:18:21,499
"and walks over to the Plaza.

1765
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,503
"He's in suite 1210.

1766
01:18:25,003 --> 01:18:28,004
"They usually eat in the hotel.

1767
01:18:28,005 --> 01:18:30,007
"And in the morning,
she goes back to the wyndham

1768
01:18:30,508 --> 01:18:32,009
"where she waits
for the studio car

1769
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:33,510
to come pick her up."

1770
01:18:33,511 --> 01:18:35,511
So you were right all along.

1771
01:18:35,512 --> 01:18:37,513
It is him.

1772
01:18:37,514 --> 01:18:40,015
They're hiding it pretty good.

1773
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:42,517
You all right?

1774
01:18:42,518 --> 01:18:44,520
Yeah, sure.

1775
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:48,523
I just got to take a piss.

1776
01:18:48,524 --> 01:18:52,025
If we just had something...
A letter, a tape,

1777
01:18:52,026 --> 01:18:54,528
anything where she talks
about the management thing,

1778
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:57,030
I think we might have something.

1779
01:18:57,031 --> 01:18:59,031
On enticement, I mean.

1780
01:18:59,032 --> 01:19:00,533
Ah, fuck both of them.

1781
01:19:00,534 --> 01:19:02,034
Why don't we just say,

1782
01:19:02,035 --> 01:19:04,536
"look, you want her,
pal? You can have her.

1783
01:19:04,537 --> 01:19:07,038
But you're gonna have to pay."

1784
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:09,541
I know how you feel,
but I don't think so.

1785
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:11,543
Hey, maybe there's something

1786
01:19:11,544 --> 01:19:14,546
in alienation of affections.

1787
01:19:16,047 --> 01:19:18,549
I don't think so.

1788
01:19:28,842 --> 01:19:31,844
Yeah, it was 379.95 new.

1789
01:19:31,845 --> 01:19:34,345
And you can have it
for 250... Even.

1790
01:19:34,346 --> 01:19:36,848
It's only a year old.

1791
01:19:36,849 --> 01:19:38,349
Ha ha ha ha!

1792
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:39,851
It was only fired on Sundays

1793
01:19:39,852 --> 01:19:41,413
by a little old
psychotic schoolteacher.

1794
01:19:41,853 --> 01:19:42,854
How do you load it?

1795
01:19:42,855 --> 01:19:45,355
Oh, easy. It takes one to 5.

1796
01:19:45,356 --> 01:19:47,357
I'll give you one.

1797
01:19:47,358 --> 01:19:49,358
You put it in the chamber,

1798
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:51,861
you press the button,

1799
01:19:52,362 --> 01:19:54,363
and you cock it...

1800
01:19:54,364 --> 01:19:56,366
And she's ready to go.

1801
01:20:04,873 --> 01:20:06,374
Lefty, huh?

1802
01:20:09,878 --> 01:20:12,379
Feels good, doesn't it?

1803
01:20:18,885 --> 01:20:21,387
Well, we got a sale?

1804
01:20:36,901 --> 01:20:39,903
We was acting really weird.

1805
01:20:39,904 --> 01:20:43,406
He pasted, pinned, scotch-taped,

1806
01:20:43,907 --> 01:20:46,408
glued photos of her, of him,

1807
01:20:46,409 --> 01:20:49,410
of him and her, of her and him,

1808
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:50,412
all over the downstairs

1809
01:20:50,913 --> 01:20:53,414
like some sort of
bizarre shrine.

1810
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:54,415
Weird.

1811
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:55,917
Frankly...

1812
01:20:56,417 --> 01:20:59,420
I thought it was a little
like a soap opera.

1813
01:21:00,421 --> 01:21:02,923
And I obviously misread him.

1814
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:05,925
That's pretty much
the same picture.

1815
01:21:05,926 --> 01:21:07,927
Aw, look.

1816
01:21:07,928 --> 01:21:09,929
That's Eileen.

1817
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:11,429
What a kid.

1818
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:12,431
I was thinking

1819
01:21:12,932 --> 01:21:13,931
of bringing her
down here for a visit

1820
01:21:13,932 --> 01:21:15,434
when Dorothy comes back.

1821
01:21:15,435 --> 01:21:17,435
That'd be fun.

1822
01:21:17,436 --> 01:21:20,437
It's rough. It's really rough.

1823
01:21:20,438 --> 01:21:21,939
I'm not sure I can take it.

1824
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:25,442
Listen, Robin, I want
to get these to king.

1825
01:21:25,443 --> 01:21:27,444
Did you see the prom picture?

1826
01:21:27,445 --> 01:21:29,445
Did I show that to you?

1827
01:21:29,446 --> 01:21:32,448
I bought her this white dress.

1828
01:21:32,449 --> 01:21:33,949
Here it is.

1829
01:21:39,455 --> 01:21:41,456
I've never felt this way before.

1830
01:21:41,457 --> 01:21:43,458
She broke my heart.

1831
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:47,461
Nice, huh?

1832
01:21:47,462 --> 01:21:49,462
I've got a better one.

1833
01:21:49,463 --> 01:21:51,463
Paul, look, we really
got to move along.

1834
01:21:51,464 --> 01:21:52,966
It's when I'm holding her

1835
01:21:52,967 --> 01:21:54,969
and we were dancing.
It's really nice.

1836
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:56,468
Wait just a second.

1837
01:21:56,469 --> 01:21:58,971
We'll be back
in an hour, all right?

1838
01:21:58,972 --> 01:21:59,972
Ok, man.

1839
01:21:59,973 --> 01:22:01,974
Ok, we'll catch you later.

1840
01:22:01,975 --> 01:22:03,475
Take it easy, ok?

1841
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:09,981
Whoa!

1842
01:22:09,982 --> 01:22:12,482
Man, I thought I'd crack up

1843
01:22:12,483 --> 01:22:14,985
when he said, "she's
broken my heart."

1844
01:22:14,986 --> 01:22:17,487
I didn't think it was funny.

1845
01:22:17,488 --> 01:22:18,988
I can take a bragging Snider.

1846
01:22:18,989 --> 01:22:20,991
I can take a conniving Snider.

1847
01:22:21,992 --> 01:22:22,992
King!

1848
01:22:22,993 --> 01:22:24,493
Yeah!

1849
01:22:24,494 --> 01:22:28,497
I just can't stomach
a sentimental Snider.

1850
01:22:28,998 --> 01:22:31,000
It's about the only time
I've liked him.

1851
01:22:31,001 --> 01:22:32,500
Get outta here. Why?

1852
01:22:32,501 --> 01:22:34,001
I don't know, really.

1853
01:22:34,002 --> 01:22:36,503
This macho guy like that.

1854
01:22:36,504 --> 01:22:39,006
You don't suppose
he'd do anything crazy,

1855
01:22:39,007 --> 01:22:40,007
do you?

1856
01:22:40,008 --> 01:22:41,007
Like what?

1857
01:22:41,008 --> 01:22:43,008
I don't know. Like hurt himself?

1858
01:22:43,009 --> 01:22:45,012
Not if it means
mussing his hair.

1859
01:22:46,513 --> 01:22:50,515
Can't we talk now?
I'm goin' a little crazy.

1860
01:22:50,516 --> 01:22:53,018
I'll see you
when I come to Los Angeles.

1861
01:22:53,019 --> 01:22:55,020
You closed
the joint bank account.

1862
01:22:55,021 --> 01:22:56,020
Yes.

1863
01:22:56,021 --> 01:22:57,521
Why?

1864
01:22:57,522 --> 01:22:59,523
I'll send you some money.

1865
01:22:59,524 --> 01:23:01,525
You didn't answer why?

1866
01:23:01,526 --> 01:23:03,026
I thought it best.

1867
01:23:03,027 --> 01:23:04,027
For what?

1868
01:23:04,028 --> 01:23:05,029
Our situation, Paul.

1869
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:06,529
I have to hang up now.

1870
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:08,531
No, please don't hang up.

1871
01:23:08,532 --> 01:23:11,533
Just what the hell
is our situation?

1872
01:23:11,534 --> 01:23:14,036
Jesus, tell me something,
will you?

1873
01:23:14,037 --> 01:23:16,039
Look, if you've had an affair,

1874
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,539
that's ok with me. I understand.

1875
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:20,540
But that doesn't
mean that we should

1876
01:23:20,541 --> 01:23:23,044
throw the whole marriage
down the toilet.

1877
01:23:23,045 --> 01:23:24,046
Please, Dorothy.

1878
01:23:24,047 --> 01:23:26,547
Please tell me where I stand.

1879
01:23:28,549 --> 01:23:31,552
I have to have more freedom.

1880
01:23:32,052 --> 01:23:34,053
I want more freedom.

1881
01:23:34,054 --> 01:23:37,056
Dorothy, you can have
more freedom, honest.

1882
01:23:37,057 --> 01:23:39,059
That's not enough.

1883
01:23:42,061 --> 01:23:45,064
Things change.

1884
01:23:45,564 --> 01:23:48,065
I'm not the same girl
I was in Vancouver.

1885
01:23:48,066 --> 01:23:50,568
No, you sure ain't.

1886
01:23:51,069 --> 01:23:53,069
Sounds like you
got a writer now.

1887
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:54,571
I don't understand
what you're saying.

1888
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:56,572
I mean, I have a hunch

1889
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:59,574
that you're sitting
on Aram's knee right now,

1890
01:23:59,575 --> 01:24:02,578
and he's moving your mouth.
He's pulling the strings!

1891
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:04,446
We'll talk when I come in.

1892
01:24:05,414 --> 01:24:07,916
You're living with him.

1893
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:11,919
I'm staying at his house
temporarily.

1894
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,419
You're living with him.

1895
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:14,922
You're sleeping with him.

1896
01:24:14,923 --> 01:24:16,423
You're fucking him.

1897
01:24:16,424 --> 01:24:17,924
Why don't you have
the guts to say it?

1898
01:24:17,925 --> 01:24:18,926
You're doing it.

1899
01:24:19,426 --> 01:24:20,427
Why can't you say it?

1900
01:24:20,428 --> 01:24:25,431
Take off the goddamn glasses.

1901
01:24:30,937 --> 01:24:33,939
I'm broke.

1902
01:24:37,943 --> 01:24:40,944
Paul, I'll take care
of you. You know that.

1903
01:24:40,945 --> 01:24:43,948
Eileen is here, isn't she?

1904
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:49,952
Listen, too much
has happened already.

1905
01:24:49,953 --> 01:24:53,455
I'll call you in a few days.

1906
01:24:53,456 --> 01:24:54,956
Maybe we can talk then.

1907
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:58,459
About a divorce?
Is that what you mean?

1908
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,462
Yes.

1909
01:25:00,963 --> 01:25:02,964
I could change.

1910
01:25:03,464 --> 01:25:05,466
Jesus, give me
a chance, will you?

1911
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:06,967
I'll call.

1912
01:25:08,969 --> 01:25:12,471
God damn it, he must be
having you followed.

1913
01:25:12,472 --> 01:25:13,471
Son of a bitch.

1914
01:25:13,472 --> 01:25:15,475
I don't want you
to see him anymore.

1915
01:25:15,976 --> 01:25:18,477
The whole thing can be
handled in other ways.

1916
01:25:19,979 --> 01:25:22,981
Promise me
you won't see him anymore.

1917
01:25:22,982 --> 01:25:24,481
He seemed so scared.

1918
01:25:24,482 --> 01:25:27,485
Hey, sis, come on in! Please?

1919
01:25:27,986 --> 01:25:30,488
Dorothy, I want you to promise.

1920
01:25:31,488 --> 01:25:33,990
Ok, I promise.

1921
01:25:36,994 --> 01:25:38,493
How's the water?

1922
01:25:38,494 --> 01:25:39,494
It's warm.

1923
01:25:39,495 --> 01:25:41,997
Yeah?

1924
01:25:42,999 --> 01:25:44,999
You'll probably
have to lead her a little.

1925
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,501
Try and get her
to talk about Aram.

1926
01:25:47,002 --> 01:25:48,503
Juicy stuff if you can.

1927
01:25:49,004 --> 01:25:50,003
Even better you can get her

1928
01:25:50,004 --> 01:25:52,005
to talk about
the management thing.

1929
01:25:52,006 --> 01:25:54,008
She's gonna come back.
I know it.

1930
01:25:54,009 --> 01:25:56,009
Yeah, sure.

1931
01:25:56,010 --> 01:25:57,511
Just in case.

1932
01:26:00,014 --> 01:26:02,514
He kept changing
his fucking mind.

1933
01:26:02,515 --> 01:26:04,515
First he said I could have
some of her clothes,

1934
01:26:04,516 --> 01:26:06,519
and then he said no,
she was coming back to him.

1935
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,519
Didn't mean a shit to me.

1936
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,521
Marker.

1937
01:26:10,522 --> 01:26:12,523
Dorothy?

1938
01:26:12,524 --> 01:26:13,525
Sam, I'm here.

1939
01:26:14,026 --> 01:26:16,025
Well, I just have
a few errands to run,

1940
01:26:16,026 --> 01:26:18,529
then I'll be back about
2:30. I promised Eileen

1941
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:22,032
that we'd buy out
rodeo drive this afternoon.

1942
01:26:22,533 --> 01:26:24,533
Oh, wow! It's you!

1943
01:26:24,534 --> 01:26:26,035
You're in the <i>TV guide.</i>

1944
01:26:26,036 --> 01:26:27,536
I'm sorry, Aram.

1945
01:26:27,537 --> 01:26:30,537
Eileen's going a little
bananas over something.

1946
01:26:30,538 --> 01:26:32,040
I didn't hear what you said.

1947
01:26:32,041 --> 01:26:33,540
I said I won't be home
till late.

1948
01:26:33,541 --> 01:26:34,622
I've got to stop at the lab.

1949
01:26:35,044 --> 01:26:36,544
Look, it's you!

1950
01:26:36,545 --> 01:26:38,045
Just a second.

1951
01:26:38,046 --> 01:26:40,048
Take it back a little.

1952
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:44,051
There, try it there.

1953
01:26:45,053 --> 01:26:46,053
She said,

1954
01:26:46,553 --> 01:26:48,054
"I'll always take care of you."

1955
01:26:48,055 --> 01:26:51,058
Yeah. Now, if you can
get her to repeat that...

1956
01:26:51,059 --> 01:26:52,058
Ok.

1957
01:26:52,059 --> 01:26:53,558
Push the button down,

1958
01:26:53,559 --> 01:26:55,560
walk around and talk.

1959
01:26:55,561 --> 01:26:58,063
It's gonna be a different shirt.

1960
01:26:58,064 --> 01:27:00,564
So?

1961
01:27:00,565 --> 01:27:02,567
Well, what do you
want me to say?

1962
01:27:02,568 --> 01:27:04,569
Anything. Anything.

1963
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:08,071
Hi, I'm Paul Snider.

1964
01:27:08,072 --> 01:27:10,074
Paul Snider, hi.

1965
01:27:12,576 --> 01:27:14,578
More, more.

1966
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:18,580
Testing. 1, 2, 3, 4.

1967
01:27:18,581 --> 01:27:22,584
Testing. 1, 2, 3, 4.

1968
01:27:24,086 --> 01:27:25,587
Ok.

1969
01:27:27,589 --> 01:27:29,590
You know, we just need

1970
01:27:29,591 --> 01:27:31,091
to straighten some things out.

1971
01:27:31,092 --> 01:27:34,094
Once we see each other,
it'll be ok.

1972
01:27:38,098 --> 01:27:39,098
Damn.

1973
01:27:39,099 --> 01:27:41,100
Damn thing doesn't work.

1974
01:27:41,101 --> 01:27:42,600
Hell, we don't need it anyway.

1975
01:27:42,601 --> 01:27:44,103
Once we spend
some time together,

1976
01:27:44,104 --> 01:27:45,604
everything's going
to be fine again.

1977
01:27:45,605 --> 01:27:46,604
I know it.

1978
01:27:46,605 --> 01:27:48,106
He called me in the morning

1979
01:27:48,107 --> 01:27:50,109
and said he was
going to see her that day.

1980
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:54,612
It says Thursday at 8 P.M.

1981
01:27:55,113 --> 01:27:56,614
Can we watch it together?

1982
01:27:57,115 --> 01:28:00,116
Absolutely. We've got a date.

1983
01:28:00,117 --> 01:28:02,618
I'll see you 2:30, ok?

1984
01:28:02,619 --> 01:28:06,122
He still had some crazy idea

1985
01:28:06,123 --> 01:28:08,622
he could put it
all back together again.

1986
01:28:08,623 --> 01:28:11,126
He vacuumed the rug,
he polished the vinyl,

1987
01:28:11,127 --> 01:28:13,129
he cleaned the whole house.

1988
01:28:21,136 --> 01:28:24,637
She arrived a little after noon.

1989
01:28:24,638 --> 01:28:27,641
The plan was, I was
to call in an hour or so

1990
01:28:27,642 --> 01:28:29,641
to see how it was going.

1991
01:28:29,642 --> 01:28:32,144
Uh, we worked out a little code

1992
01:28:32,145 --> 01:28:35,647
so she wouldn't know
he was talking to me.

1993
01:28:35,648 --> 01:28:38,149
I tried to get through
on the phone, but, uh...

1994
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:41,319
You know what happened.

1995
01:28:44,322 --> 01:28:47,824
I've been drinking.

1996
01:28:47,825 --> 01:28:50,827
I'm nervous.

1997
01:28:50,828 --> 01:28:53,830
I am, too.

1998
01:28:55,332 --> 01:28:58,335
Look at my hand.

1999
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:03,338
This is a new shirt.

2000
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,840
I must have combed my hair

2001
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:09,343
a dozen times.

2002
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:11,346
I guess I had some crazy idea

2003
01:29:11,347 --> 01:29:12,846
I could win you back.

2004
01:29:12,847 --> 01:29:15,849
A real schmuck, huh?

2005
01:29:17,351 --> 01:29:19,852
There's no chance, is there?

2006
01:29:19,853 --> 01:29:22,354
We have some things
we should talk about.

2007
01:29:25,358 --> 01:29:27,360
I know.

2008
01:29:29,861 --> 01:29:31,362
I love you, Dorothy.

2009
01:29:31,363 --> 01:29:33,364
I love you so much.

2010
01:29:33,365 --> 01:29:36,866
I can give you $7,000.

2011
01:29:36,867 --> 01:29:38,368
Please come back to me.

2012
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:42,872
It's half of everything I have.

2013
01:29:42,873 --> 01:29:45,374
Let's make it
like it was before.

2014
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:46,375
Please?

2015
01:29:46,376 --> 01:29:49,379
I have some of it here with me.

2016
01:29:52,381 --> 01:29:54,383
Remember the ring I gave you?

2017
01:29:55,384 --> 01:29:56,884
Yes.

2018
01:29:56,885 --> 01:29:58,386
Still have it?

2019
01:29:59,387 --> 01:30:00,888
Yes.

2020
01:30:04,392 --> 01:30:05,392
I don't think

2021
01:30:05,393 --> 01:30:08,394
I want to go on
living without you.

2022
01:30:08,395 --> 01:30:10,396
I bought a gun.

2023
01:30:10,397 --> 01:30:13,400
Oh, Paul.

2024
01:30:15,901 --> 01:30:17,402
Things will change for you.

2025
01:30:17,903 --> 01:30:18,903
No!

2026
01:30:18,904 --> 01:30:20,405
What? You mean
maybe I'll grow up

2027
01:30:20,406 --> 01:30:22,406
to be a big movie director?

2028
01:30:22,407 --> 01:30:23,408
Or own a big magazine?

2029
01:30:23,409 --> 01:30:25,409
Is that what you mean?

2030
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:27,410
Maybe then I could get you back!

2031
01:30:27,411 --> 01:30:28,912
Is that what you're saying?

2032
01:30:28,913 --> 01:30:29,912
Sit down!

2033
01:30:29,913 --> 01:30:31,914
Those fucking bastards!

2034
01:30:31,915 --> 01:30:33,416
I want to leave.

2035
01:30:33,417 --> 01:30:35,418
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2036
01:30:35,419 --> 01:30:37,919
Please don't leave.

2037
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,421
I want to show you something.

2038
01:30:39,922 --> 01:30:41,923
Please stay just a minute.

2039
01:30:41,924 --> 01:30:44,926
I won't do that again.

2040
01:30:47,429 --> 01:30:48,930
Please.

2041
01:30:55,936 --> 01:31:00,439
I have been working
my ass off on these.

2042
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:03,943
God, I hope you like them.

2043
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:13,951
They're a lot better than
the Farrah fawcett ones,

2044
01:31:13,952 --> 01:31:15,452
aren't they?

2045
01:31:15,453 --> 01:31:19,956
She sold 5 million of them
in one year.

2046
01:31:19,957 --> 01:31:22,458
Well, which one do you think?

2047
01:31:27,464 --> 01:31:31,467
We could at least still
be in business together.

2048
01:31:32,468 --> 01:31:35,969
Don't shake your fuckin'
head like that at me!

2049
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:39,473
Is it too small-time for
the big movie star, huh?

2050
01:31:39,474 --> 01:31:40,974
Too tasteless, maybe?

2051
01:31:40,975 --> 01:31:41,975
I think...

2052
01:31:41,976 --> 01:31:44,477
Oh ho ho! You <i>think.</i>

2053
01:31:44,978 --> 01:31:47,981
I think that we
should break cleanly.

2054
01:31:48,482 --> 01:31:49,483
Oh.

2055
01:31:49,983 --> 01:31:51,483
I want it to be over.

2056
01:31:51,984 --> 01:31:54,987
Hmm. Is that what Aram
told you to say?

2057
01:31:55,488 --> 01:31:58,989
And what the fuck is $7,000?!

2058
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:00,991
You think I'm stupid.

2059
01:32:00,992 --> 01:32:03,494
I may not be
a Hefner or an Aram,

2060
01:32:03,495 --> 01:32:05,495
but I'm not stupid.

2061
01:32:05,496 --> 01:32:06,995
Not just yet, you don't!

2062
01:32:06,996 --> 01:32:07,998
Not until you tell me

2063
01:32:07,999 --> 01:32:10,500
where the rest of the money is.

2064
01:32:10,501 --> 01:32:13,502
Who's holding it for you?

2065
01:32:13,503 --> 01:32:15,504
Tell me!

2066
01:32:15,505 --> 01:32:16,505
It's half.

2067
01:32:16,506 --> 01:32:18,974
Liar! Get the fuck outta here!

2068
01:32:18,975 --> 01:32:23,677
"I'll always
take care of you, Paul."

2069
01:32:23,678 --> 01:32:25,679
"I love you, Paul."

2070
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:29,182
"I owe you so much, Paul."

2071
01:32:29,183 --> 01:32:31,684
Liar! Liar!

2072
01:32:31,685 --> 01:32:33,186
Liar!

2073
01:32:33,187 --> 01:32:35,188
Liar!

2074
01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:38,691
I don't think you've ever known

2075
01:32:38,692 --> 01:32:40,192
how much I love you.

2076
01:32:40,193 --> 01:32:43,695
Well, maybe now you will.

2077
01:32:56,207 --> 01:32:59,208
You think I'm faking, don't you?

2078
01:32:59,209 --> 01:33:01,711
You don't think
I'd do it, do you?

2079
01:33:04,713 --> 01:33:07,215
You think I'm a coward.

2080
01:33:30,736 --> 01:33:35,239
Let's not hurt
each other anymore, please.

2081
01:33:38,743 --> 01:33:40,745
Oh, please.

2082
01:33:42,746 --> 01:33:46,750
Too small-time for you now, huh?

2083
01:33:48,252 --> 01:33:50,752
You slept with him last night...

2084
01:33:50,753 --> 01:33:52,755
Didn't you?

2085
01:33:54,257 --> 01:33:56,259
Answer me.

2086
01:33:57,259 --> 01:33:58,260
Didn't you?

2087
01:33:59,761 --> 01:34:01,763
Sure you did.

2088
01:34:02,264 --> 01:34:04,764
You fucked the big director.

2089
01:34:04,765 --> 01:34:08,268
Well, now me.

2090
01:34:08,269 --> 01:34:10,269
I'll give you a chance to judge,

2091
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,772
a chance to see
who the real man is!

2092
01:34:12,773 --> 01:34:14,773
Aah!

2093
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:16,275
Stop it, Paul!

2094
01:34:16,776 --> 01:34:18,277
Aah!

2095
01:35:35,344 --> 01:35:39,848
You're gonna do me
a big favor, huh?

2096
01:35:41,849 --> 01:35:43,851
Ok.

2097
01:35:44,852 --> 01:35:46,853
That's me...

2098
01:35:46,854 --> 01:35:48,354
A charity case.

2099
01:35:51,858 --> 01:35:56,862
Now, try to think of
dear Aram if you can.

2100
01:36:07,872 --> 01:36:09,373
They're killing me.

2101
01:36:09,874 --> 01:36:11,875
They're trying to kill me.

2102
01:36:27,889 --> 01:36:31,893
Those bastards!

2103
01:37:11,394 --> 01:37:12,893
Operator, can you
check on a number for me?

2104
01:37:12,894 --> 01:37:14,396
I think it's out of order.

2105
01:37:14,397 --> 01:37:16,398
What's the number, sir?

2106
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:19,400
474-5051.

2107
01:37:19,401 --> 01:37:20,401
Hold on.

2108
01:37:20,402 --> 01:37:21,403
Ok.

2109
01:37:34,414 --> 01:37:35,415
Can you hear me?

2110
01:37:37,417 --> 01:37:39,418
They did this.

2111
01:37:53,931 --> 01:37:55,431
My queen.

2112
01:37:55,432 --> 01:37:57,434
Her name is Billie Joan Worth.

2113
01:37:57,435 --> 01:37:58,934
She's very sweet.

2114
01:37:58,935 --> 01:38:01,437
I was thinking she's
a maybe for November.

2115
01:38:01,438 --> 01:38:02,438
Where's she from?

2116
01:38:02,439 --> 01:38:04,439
Davenport, Iowa.

2117
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:05,440
I like her.

2118
01:38:05,441 --> 01:38:06,440
Well, Bill, she's a technician

2119
01:38:06,441 --> 01:38:07,443
for a pharmaceutical company

2120
01:38:07,444 --> 01:38:08,943
who likes all sports,

2121
01:38:08,944 --> 01:38:10,444
reading, and photography.

2122
01:38:10,945 --> 01:38:12,946
You want sugar?

2123
01:38:12,947 --> 01:38:15,449
Uh, a little, please.

2124
01:39:30,964 --> 01:39:33,967
You won't forget Paul Snider.

2125
01:39:52,484 --> 01:39:54,485
Now that people recognize you,

2126
01:39:54,486 --> 01:39:56,486
what's it like?

2127
01:39:56,487 --> 01:39:57,487
Oh.

2128
01:39:57,488 --> 01:39:58,987
I'll go shopping in the store,

2129
01:39:58,988 --> 01:40:00,490
and I'll see people going,

2130
01:40:00,491 --> 01:40:02,490
"Hey, that's Dorothy Stratten."

2131
01:40:02,491 --> 01:40:04,992
Or, "Hey, can we have
a picture of you?

2132
01:40:04,993 --> 01:40:06,495
Can we have an autograph?"

2133
01:40:06,496 --> 01:40:08,495
Or even in the airport,
you know,

2134
01:40:08,496 --> 01:40:09,996
people rushing up to me

2135
01:40:09,997 --> 01:40:11,499
to get my autograph
or something.

2136
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,002
That's really exciting for me.
