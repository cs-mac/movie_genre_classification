"The Last Mile."

70

We called ours "The Green Mile."

...the worst urinary infection
of my life.

78

Well, he'll get his chance, then.
Won't he?

00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,798
You ugly little piece of shit!

329
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,592
HARRY: Are you listening to me?
-Fuck!

330
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,676
Percy!

331
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,348
I'm gonna rip your diseased head off...

332
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,919
...you little piece of shit!

333
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,230
(PERCY YELLS)

334
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,231
Percy met your mouse.

335
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,837
It's in here somewhere. I'm gonna
squish the little son of a bitch.

336
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,469
Percy, we already tried that.

337
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,159
PERCY:
What'd you say?

338
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,799
I said that we...

339
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,520
Knock yourself out.
Hope you nail the bastard.

340
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,432
Oh, yeah.

341
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,989
Gosh. He ain't in there, huh?

342
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,193
Don't that beat the mousy band?

343
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,915
Percy?

344
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,990
You wanna think about
what you were doing?

345
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,710
I was trying to get the mouse.
Are you blind?

346
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,236
You also scared the living crap
out of me and Bill...

347
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,993
...not to mention the inmates.

348
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,508
So what?

349
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,116
They aren't in cradle school,
case you didn't notice.

350
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,631
Although you treat them that way.

351
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,838
BRUTAL: We don't scare them
any more than we have to.

352
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,593
They're under enough strain.

353
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,831
Men under strain can snap.

354
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,398
Hurt themselves and hurt others.
That's why our job is...

355
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,719
...talking...

356
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,879
...not yelling.

357
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,837
You'd do better to think of this place
like an intensive care ward.

358
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,392
I think of it as a bucket of piss
to drown rats in.

359
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,194
That's all.

360
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,151
Anybody doesn't like it?

361
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,516
You can kiss my ass.

362
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,392
You try it. Go on.

363
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,155
Try it. You'll be on the bread lines
before the week is out.

364
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,913
Okay, Brutal.

365
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,035
We all know who your connections are.

366
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,519
You ever threaten a man on this block
again, we all gonna have a go.

367
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,199
Job be damned.

368
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,073
You done?

369
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,039
Get all this shit back in the room.
You are cluttering up my Mile.

370
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,474
Arlen...

371
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,075
...your daughter and her family
are here.

372
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,159
Let's move. I want at least two
rehearsals before he gets back.

373
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,435
TOOT:
Sitting down, sitting down!

374
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,238
Rehearsing now! Everybody settle!

375
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,277
PAUL:
Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.

376
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,917
Stepping forward, stepping forward,
stepping forward.

377
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,277
-ls his head properly shaved?
-lt's all dandruffy, and it smells.

378
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,873
I will take that as a yes.

379
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,439
PAUL:
Let's go, Arlen.

380
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,118
TOOT:
Walking the Mile, walking the Mile...

381
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,915
...walking the Mile, walking the Mile,
walking the Mile...

382
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,912
...walking the Mile.

383
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,038
I'm getting to my knees.
I'm praying, praying.

384
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,840
Lord is my shepherd
and so forth and so on.

385
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,352
I'm sorry for all the bad shit
I've done and people I've tramped on.

386
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,875
And I hope they forgive me...

387
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,754
...and I'll never do it again,
that's for sure.

388
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,716
Paul?

389
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,678
We're not gonna have some
Cherokee medicine man in here...

390
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,717
...hollering and shaking his dick.

391
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,428
-Actually...
TOOT: Still praying, still praying.

392
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,636
-Getting right with Jesus.
-Do it quietly!

393
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,279
You old gink!

394
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,590
PAUL:
As I was saying...

395
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,354
...I don't believe they actually
shake their dicks.

396
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,876
Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian,
so Reverend Schuster's coming in.

397
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,476
He's good. He's fast too.
Doesn't get them all worked up.

398
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,473
On your feet, Toot.
You prayed enough for one day.

399
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,280
Getting to my feet!
Walking the Mile...

400
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,671
...walking the Mile,
walking the Green Mile.

401
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,638
Walking the Mile.

402
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,558
Walking in the Mile.

403
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,310
Sitting down now.

404
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,197
Sitting down.
I'm taking a seat in Old Sparky.

405
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,589
What do I do?

406
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,198
Watch and learn.

407
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,238
TOOT:
Watch and learn.

408
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,199
Getting strapped.

409
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,872
Getting clamped.

410
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,078
Getting wired.

411
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,114
All right.

412
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,310
Getting all electrode.

413
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,755
Roll on one.

414
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,553
"Roll on one" means I turn
the generator up full.

415
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,836
The lights go brighter
in half the prison.

417

...sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

419
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,589
Anything to say before
your sentence is carried out?

420
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,228
Yeah.

421
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,070
I want fried chicken with gravy on the
taters, and I want to shit in your hat.

422
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,591
I got to have Mae West
sit on my face...

423
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,434
...because I'm one horny motherfucker.

424
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,829
You bastard.

425
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,398
TOOT:
That's a good one.

426
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,874
PAUL:
Quiet.

427
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,349
Quiet! Shut up!

428
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,909
-Shut up!
-Sorry, boss.

429
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,079
One more remark like that, I'll
have Van Hay roll on two for real.

430
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,754
And I'll have one less
crazy old trustee.

431
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,753
It was pretty funny.

432
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,474
I don't like it.
We'll be doing this for real.

433
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,834
I don't want anybody remembering
a stupid joke and getting going again.

434
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,277
Ever try not to laugh in church...

435
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,750
...when something funny gets stuck
in your head?

436
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,516
I'm sorry, Paul. You're right.

437
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,279
Let's keep going.

438
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,629
Harry?

439
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,558
Soak the sponge.

440
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,589
TOOT:
Putting on the black hood.

441
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,913
And putting on my cap.

442
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,037
Why's he putting that sponge
on his head?

443
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,113
Conducts electricity to the brain
fast like a bullet.

444
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,157
You don't ever throw the switch
on a man without that.

(TOOT MAKES GAGGING NOISES)

Hush up there, Toot.

447
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,471

Getting screwed.

448
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,197

00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,719
Amen.

454
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,109
Roll on two.

455
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,479

00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,519
This is a shocking experience!

460
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,152
One of the witnesses
showed up a day early.

461
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,474
Let's do it again,
and let's get it right this time.

462
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,995
Get that idiot out of the chair.

463
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:12,077
Do you think if a man sincerely
repents on what he done wrong...

464
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,430
...that he might get to go back to
the time that was happiest for him...

465
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,718
...and live there forever?

466
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,956
Could that be what heaven's like?

467
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,794
I just about believe that very thing.

468
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,751
Had me a young wife when I was 18.

469
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,877
Spent our first summer in the mountains.
Made love every night.

470
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,518
And she'd lie there after...

471
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,670
...bare-breasted in the firelight.

472
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,957
And we'd talk sometimes
till the sun come up.

473

BURT:
Now you got my curiosity aroused.

719
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,314
John Coffey.

720
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,589
Coffey.

721
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,149
Causing you problems?

722
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:22,996
Can't say he is. He doesn't like
the dark and cries on occasion...

723
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,992
...but other than that...

724
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,357
He cries, does he?
Got a lot to cry about, I'd say.

01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,033
You know what he did.

Y'all come on up.

731

KIDS:
Coming, Mama!

732
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,832
What exactly are you
trying to find out?

733
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,670
I wonder if he did anything
like that before.

734
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,917
Why? Has he said anything?

735
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:54,152
No, but a man who does
a thing like that...

736
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,075
...has often developed a taste for it
over time. It occurred to me...

737
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:02,029
...that it might be easy enough to
follow his back trail. Find out.

738
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:06,435
A man his size, and colored to boot,
can't be that hard to trace.

739
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,513
You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.

740
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,751
Believe me, we tried.

741
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,670
Like he'd dropped out of the sky.

742
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,799
How can that be?

743
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,999
We're in a depression.
A third of the country's out of work.

744
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:25,114
People are drifting by the thousands,
looking for jobs, for greener grass.

745
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,358
Even a giant like Coffey
wouldn't get noticed everywhere.

746
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,310
Not until he kills
a couple of little girls.

747
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,678
He is...

748
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,991
...strange, I admit.

749
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:40,472
But there doesn't seem to be
any real violence in him.

750
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,189
I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith.

751
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:46,153
I deal with them day in and day out.

752
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,434
You didn't come to ask me
whether he killed before.

753
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,513
You came to see if I think
he did it at all.

754
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:54,676
Do you?

755
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,636
One seldom sees a less ambiguous case.

756
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,836
He was found with the victims
in his arms.

757
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,798
And yet you defended him.

758
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,228
Everyone is entitled to a defense.

759
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,193
CYNTHIA:

Y'all listen to your mama!

761
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,638
I'll tell you something.

762
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,030
You listen close too, because it
might be something you need to know.

763
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,554
I'm listening.

764
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,995
We had us a dog.

765
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,871
Just a sweet mongrel.

766
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,553
You know the kind.

767
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:33,150
Well, in many ways,
a good mongrel dog is like a Negro.

768
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,638
You get to know it.

769
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,038
Often, you get to love it.
It is of no particular use...

770
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,670
...but you keep it around
because you think it loves you.

771
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:49,039
If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you
never have to find out any different.

772
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,196
My wife and I were not so lucky.

773
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,559
Caleb, come here for a second.

774
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,029
Come here.

775
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,629
Please, son.

776
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,594
He still has the one good eye.

777
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,990
I suppose he's lucky...

778
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,515
...not to be completely blind.

779
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:16,709
We get down on our knees and thank God
for that much at least.

780
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,674
Right, Caleb?

781
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,316
Go on in, now.

782
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,433
That dog attacked my boy
for no reason.

783
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,116
Just got it in his mind one day.

784
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,239
The same with John Coffey.

785
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:37,519
He was sorry afterwards.
Of that I have no doubt.

786
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,878
But those little girls...

787
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,509
...stayed raped and murdered.

788
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,031
Maybe he'd never done it before.

789
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,790
My dog never bit before.

790
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,074
But I didn't concern myself with that.

791
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:57,828
I went out with my rifle, grabbed
his collar and blew his brains out.

792
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,275
Is Coffey guilty?

793
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,758
Yes, he is.

794
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,958
Don't you doubt it.

795
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,669
And don't you turn your back on him.

796
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:14,513
You may get away with it once
or even a hundred times...

797
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,872
...but in the end...

798
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,199
...you'll get bit.

01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,158
Several times.

814
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:33,430
John, I can smell that from over here.
I surely can.

815
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,390
Can I give Del and Mr. Jingles some?

816
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,396
Well, it's yours, John.
You can do with it as you please.

817
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:48,670
Here. This for Del and Mr. Jingles.

818
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,870
BILL Y: Hey! What about me?
I'm gonna get some too, ain't I?

819
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,872
It's yours, John. As you please.

820
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,040
I think I'll just keep the rest, then.

821
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,750
Courtesy of the gentleman
across the way.

822
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,633
DEL:
John, that's so very fine of you.

823
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:18,274
I thank you. Mr. Jingle thank you.
My mama'd thank you too, but she dead.

824
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,154
Welcome.

825
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,196
BILL Y:
Hey!

826
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:25,399
What about me? Don't you
hold out on me, you big dummy nigger.

827
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,309
(BILL Y LAUGHS)

828
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,679
BILL Y:
Here come the boss man.

829
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,869
You'll keep a civil tongue
on my block.

830
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,796
You get that one for free.

831
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,318
That's the last one.

832
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,873
That's it?
Just that little itty-bitty one?

833
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,637
I guess I'm gonna have to
pay you out for the rest.

834
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,675
(BILL Y LAUGHS)

835
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,148
Yee-ha!

836
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,310
Good shot, weren't it?

837
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,596
The look on your face!

838
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,233
HARRY:
You believe this?

839
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,596
That son of a bitch pissed on me.

840
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,157
BILL Y:
Did y'all like that?

841
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,550
I'm cooking up some turds
to go with it.

842
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,313
Nice soft ones.

843
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,635
Have them out to y'all tomorrow.

844
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,715
We've been meaning to clean out
that room for a while, haven't we?

845
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,115
BILL Y: Be careful with that.
That's fragile.

846
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:47,438
What's it now?
What's it now? Moving day?

847
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,716
Y'all wanna come in here
and dust a little?

848
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,396
You can shine my knob for me
while you're at it.

849
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,630
You can come in here on your legs...

850
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,075
...but you'll go out on your backs.

851
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:14,471
Billy the Kid gonna
guarantee you that.

852
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:15,710
Come on, fuck-stick.

853
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:20,073
No sneaking up on me this time.
We'll go man-to-man.

854
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,475
Piss on me?

855

PAUL: Come on, Wild Bill.
Little walky-walky.

857
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:56,872
Don't you call me that!
Wild Bill Hickok wasn't no range rider!

858
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,997
He was just some
bushwhacking John Law!

859
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:02,630
Dumb son of a bitch sat with his back
to the door, killed by a drunk.

860
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,711
Oh, my suds and body.
A history lesson.

861
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:09,029
You never know what you'll get at work
every day on the Green Mile.

862
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,672
Thank you, Wild Bill.

Not in there.

865
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,149
I'll be good.

866
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,834
Honest injun, I will. I will.

He's pitching a fit.

01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,953
He'll be fine, boys.
Trust me on this one.

870
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,592
Hey! Hey! Hey!

871
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:44,590
Hey, fellers!

872
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,952
All I wanted me was a little
corn bread, you motherfuckers!

873
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,668
All I wanted me was
a little corn bread!

874
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,310
I learned my lesson.

875
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,039
I'll be good.

Psst!

01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,555
Hey, Toot.

879
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,591
Give you a nickel for that Moon Pie.

Yes, sir, yes, sir. How do you do?

Hope your bags are packed.

My bags are packed! I'm ready to go!

Where are we going? Let's go!

No! No! No! No!

BILL Y:
Let me out of here!

888
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,435
That Moon Pie thing was
pretty original.

889
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,159
Gotta give him that.

What you talking about?

Important folks heard about your mouse.
Wanna see him perform.

Not just prison guards.

from the state capitol.

You fellas coming?

No, we got other fish to fry
just now, Del.

But you knock them for a loop.

01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,553
Listen to him squishing in his pant

974
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:20,398
PAUL: Well, what about Dean?
He's got a little boy.

975
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:23,074
He'd love to have a pet mouse, I bet.

976
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,273
How could a boy be trusted
with Mr. Jingle?

977
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,950
Maybe forget to feed him.

978
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:34,955
How he keep up with his training?
He just a boy, n'est-ce pas?

979
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,790
All right. I'll take him, then.

980
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,555
Me.

981
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:52,189
Merci beaucoup.
Thank you kindly, but...

982
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,790
...you live out in the woods.

983
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,554
Mr. Jingle, he be...

984
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:01,312
...he be scared to live
out in the big woods.

985
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:07,632
How about Mouseville?

986
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:09,670
Mouseville?

987
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,229
Tourist attraction down in Florida.

988
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:14,639
Tallahassee, I think.

989
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,309
-ls that right, Paul? Tallahassee?
-Yeah.

990
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:18,629
PAUL:
Tallahassee.

991
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,270
It's just down the road a piece
from the dog university.

992
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:28,235
You think they'd take Mr. Jingles?

993
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,639
BRUTAL:
You think he's got the stuff?

994
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,717
I mean, he is pretty smart.

995
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,558
What is Mouseville?

996
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,677
Tourist attraction, I said.

997
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,592
They got this big tent.

998
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,798
-You have to pay?
-Are you shitting me? Course you pay.

999
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:44,070
Dime apiece.

1000
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,596
-Two cents for the kids.
-For the kids.

1001
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,956
Inside the tent they got this...

1002
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:50,950
...mouse city...

1003
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,193
...made out of...

1004
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:57,911
...old boxes and toilet paper rolls,
little windows so you can look in.

1005
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:02,478
Plus, they got
the Mouseville All-Star Circus.

1006
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:06,473
Yeah, there's mice
that swing on trapeze.

1007
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:10,030
Mice that roll barrels.
Mice that stack coins.

1008
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,955
Yeah, that's it.

1009
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,392
DEL:
That's the place for Mr. Jingles.

1010
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:26,118
You gonna be a circus mouse after all.

1011
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:30,269
You're gonna live in a mouse city
down in Florida.

1012
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:34,476
There he goes.

1013
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,437
No!

1014
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,596
Mr. Jingles!

1015
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,756
I knew I'd get him sooner or later.

1016
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,710
It was just a matter of time, really.

1017
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,952
DEL:
You fucking cruel bastard!

1018
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:11,639
COFFEY:
Give him to me.

1019
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:14,800
Give him to me. Might still be time.

1020
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,473
What are you doing?

1021
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:30,709
Paul?

1022
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,512
What the hell...?

1023
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,432
DEL:
Please, John.

1024
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,714
Help him.

1025
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,991
Please, Johnny, help him.

1026
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,194
Oh, dear Jesus.

1027
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:48,714
The tail.

1028
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,509
Look at the tail.

1029
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:24,398
(COUGHS)

1030
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,315
What'd you do?

1031
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,519
I helped Del's mouse...

1032
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,159
...his circus mouse.

1033
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,910
Gonna live in a mouse city...

1034
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,639
...down in...

1035
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:30,675
Florida.

1036
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:35,511
Boss Percy bad.

1037
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,639
He mean. He step on Del's mouse.

1038
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,318
I took it back, though.

1039
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,273
Merci.

1040
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,674
PAUL:
Brute...

1041
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,231
...you come along with me.

1042
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,637
You fellas go on back
to your cribbage game.

1043
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:21,949
Now, don't start in on me.

1044
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:24,236
It was just a mouse.

1045
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,675
Never belonged here
in the first place.

1046
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:28,638
The mouse is fine.

1047
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:30,476
Just fine.

1048
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:33,148
You're no better at mouse-killing
than you are...

1049
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,477
...at anything else around here.

1050
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,790
PERCY:
Yeah, you expect me to believe that?

1051
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,988
I heard the goddamn thing crunch.

1052
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:46,470
Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is okay?

1053
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,715
After all those talks we had about...

1054
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:51,912
...keeping the prisoners calm?

1055
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:55,398
-Aren't you relieved?
-What kind of game is this?

1056
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:56,993
It's no game.

1057
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:58,639
See for yourself.

1058
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:02,795
Go on.

1059
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:18,473
DEL: Don't let nothing
happen to Mr. Jingle.

1060
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:25,551
You switched them. You switched them
somehow, you bastards.

1061
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:30,273
I always keep a spare mouse in
my wallet for occasions such as this.

1062
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:33,034
Yeah, you playing with me.
Both of you.

1063
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,635
Just who the hell you think you are?

1064
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,072
We're the people you work with.

1065
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,113
But not for long.

1066
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,997
Percy, I want your word.

1067
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,396
My word?

1068
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,560
I put you out front for Del...

1069
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:53,552
...you put in your transfer
to Briar Ridge the next day.

1070
01:31:55,880 --> 01:32:00,237
What if I just call up certain people
and tell them you're harassing me?

1071
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,596
-Bullying me.
PAUL: Go ahead.

1072
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:06,199
I promise you'll leave your share
of blood on the floor.

1073
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:07,589
Over a mouse?

1074
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:08,955
No.

1075
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:13,872
But four men will swear you stood by
while Wild Bill tried to strangle Dean.

1076
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:17,874
About that, people will care.
Even your uncle the governor.

1077
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:20,588
Thing like that goes
on your work record.

1078
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:25,192
Work record can follow a man around
for a long, long time.

1079
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,192
PAUL:
I put you out front...

1080
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:29,676
...you put in for that transfer.

1081
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:32,519
That's the deal.

1082
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:37,834
All right.

1083
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:40,190
All right.

1084
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,515
You make a promise to a man,
you shake his hand.

1085
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,952
Hey, boys.

1086
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:55,397
No, now, say hey, Mr Jingles.

1087
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:59,914
PAUL: Eduard Delacroix,
will you step forward?

1088
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,148
Boss Edgecomb.

1089
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,199
Yes, Del?

1090
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,908
Don't let nothing happen
to Mr. Jingle, okay?

1091
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,034
Here. You take him.

1092
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:30,755
Del?

1093
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:35,432
I can't have a mouse
on my shoulder while...

1094
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:37,716
...you know.

1095
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,472
COFFEY:
I'll take him, boss.

1096
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:44,509
Just for now, if Del don't mind.

1097
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:53,392
You take him, John. You take him
till this foolishment be done.

1098
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,477
You gonna take him to Mouseville?

1099
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,515
We'll do it together, most likely.

1100
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:21,835
Maybe take a little vacation time.

1101
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:22,956
Yeah.

1102
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,794
People pay a dime apiece to see him.

1103
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:28,833
Two cents for the kids.
Ain't that right, Boss Howell?

1104
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:30,638
That's right, Del.

1105
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:34,238
You're a good man, Boss Howell.

1106
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,153
You too, Boss Edgecomb.

1107

met you guys somewheres else.

Hope he's good and scared.

1110
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:30,436
Hope he knows the fires are stoked
and that Satan's imps are waiting.

1111
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:40,992
Del, it's all right.

1112
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:23,189
Roll on one.

1113
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:37,153
You be still, Mr. Jingles.

1114
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:41,836
You be so quiet and so still.

1115
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,713
Eduard Delacroix...

1116
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:50,357
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers.

1117
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:54,229
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1118
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:57,393
You have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1119
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,511
I sorry for what l...

1120

I sorry for what I do.

1121
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,235
I give anything to take it back.

1122
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:21,832
But I can't.

1123
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,070
God have mercy on me.

Ainsi soit-il. Amen.

1125

Don't forget about Mouseville.

Hey...

There's no such place.

1128

That's just a fairy tale these guys
told you to keep you quiet.

Just thought you should know, faggot.

The sponge is dry.

1139
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:01,316
What?

1140
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:10,274
-The goddamn sponge is dry!
-Well, don't you stop him!

1141
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:12,988
Don't you do it!
It's too late for that.

1142
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:28,913
Is this normal?

1143
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:31,720
God, the smell.

1144
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:35,348
He's cooking now!
They cooking him good!

1145
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,352
They're about done, I reckon!

1146
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:44,394
We're gonna have a hoedown!

He's cooking now!

1148

He's cooking now!

'Cution gumbo. Give me some!

1151
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:00,754
Give me some!

1152
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,911
I'm smelling gumbo! I'm smelling...

1153
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:06,191
I said give me some!

1154
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:11,551
I smell it!

1155
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:14,396
Smell it!

1156
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:22,949
Should I kill the juice?

1157
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:24,633
No! Roll, for chrisssake, roll!

1158
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:48,593
He's frying now!

1159
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:50,398
He's frying now!

1160
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:54,519
Why don't you shut it down?

1161
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:57,957
He's still alive. You want me
to shut down while he's still alive?

1162
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:06,599
You watch, you son of a bitch!

1163
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:10,514
It's all right, folks!
It's all under control!

1164
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,759
HAL: Everybody stay calm!
Please, stay calm.

1165
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:20,276
Kill it!

1166
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:28,030
You do it!

1167
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:30,117
You're running this show, ain't you?

1168
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:59,354
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1169
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:02,749
Brutal!

1170
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:03,950
Brutal, no!

1171
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:05,789
What do you mean, no?

1172
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:07,632
You saw what he did!

1173
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:10,678
Delacroix's dead!
Percy is not worth it!

1174
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:13,315
So he just gets away with it!
Is that how it works?

1175

(FOOTSTEPS)

1176
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:24,517
What in the blue fuck was that?

1177
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:26,839
Jesus Christ.

1178
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:29,799
There's puke
all over the floor up there.

1179
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:31,718
And the smell.

1180
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:36,109
I got Van Hay to open both doors, but
that smell won't go out for 5 years.

1181
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:37,918
That's what I'm betting.

1182
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:41,991
And that asshole Wharton
is singing about it!

1183
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:43,839
You can hear him up there!

1184
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:46,868
Can he carry a tune, Hal?

1185
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:59,230
Okay, boys, okay.

1186
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:02,632
Now, what in the hell happened?

1187
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,359
An execution.

1188
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:05,669
A successful one.

1189
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:10,039
How in the name of Christ
can you call that a success?

1190
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,234
Eduard Delacroix is dead.

1191
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:15,676
Isn't he?

1192
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,115
Percy?

1193
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:23,669
Something to say?

1194
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:29,790
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1195
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:33,588
How many years you spend
pissing on the toilet seat...

1196
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:35,871
...before someone told you
to put it up?

1197
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:37,798
Percy fucked up, Hal.

1198
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:39,598
Pure and simple.

1199
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:41,792
That's your official position?

1200
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:43,917
Don't you think it should be?

1201
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:48,154
He's putting in for a transfer request
to Briar Ridge tomorrow.

1202
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,755
Moving on to bigger and better things.

1203
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:52,433
Isn't that right, Percy?

1204
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:55,234
Yeah.

1205

You okay?

1219
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,950
I could feel it from here.

1220
01:46:57,560 --> 01:46:58,913
What do you mean?

1221
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:01,393
You could hear it.

1222
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:03,756
Is that what you mean?
You could hear it.

1223
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,797
He out of it now, though.

1224
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,397
He the lucky one.

1225
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:12,515
No matter how it happened,
Del the lucky one.

Where's Mr. Jingles?

1227
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:23,949
He run away under that door.

1228
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,556
Don't think he'll be back.

1229
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:31,394
He felt it too, through me.

1230
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,991
Didn't mean to hurt him none.

1231
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:38,393
All that hurt just spill out.

1232
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:47,070
Awful tired now, boss.

1233
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,478
Dog-tired.

1234
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,638

I know.

JAN:
Melinda. Hi.

1240
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:24,918
I am so happy to see you.

1241
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:28,512
Look at you.

1242
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:31,351
We missed you at church.

1243
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,275
My hair...

1244
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:40,239
-You look fine.
-I'm just a mess.

1245
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,590
She's having one of her good days.

1246
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,957
I thank God for that.

1247
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:54,032
What's a bad day?

1248
01:49:57,320 --> 01:49:59,072
Sometimes she's...

1249
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:01,799
...she's not herself anymore.

1250
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:03,799
She swears.

1251
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:05,439
She swears?

1252
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:07,193
It just pops out.

1253
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:10,354
Most awful language you can imagine.

1254
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:12,750
She doesn't even know she's doing it.

1255
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:16,759
I didn't know she'd ever heard
words like that.

1256
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,037
To hear her say them
in her sweet voice...

1257
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,514
I'm glad she's having a good day.

1258
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,875
I'm glad for you and Jan.

1259

1260
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:49,474
...if you don't tell me
what's on your mind...

1261
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,072
...l'm afraid I'll have to
smother you with a pillow.

1262
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:03,636
I'm thinking I love you.

1263
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:08,836
I'm thinking I don't know
what I would do if you were gone.

1264
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:12,039
Oh.

1265
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:18,116
I'm also thinking I'm gonna
have the boys over tomorrow.

how to cook chicken.

JAN:
Well, thank you.

1268
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:28,879
This is one delicious treat, ma'am,
before I go to work.

1269
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:30,519
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

1270
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:33,070
Brutal, you gonna hog all them taters?

1271
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:35,709
Yes, I am.
Harry, you want some potatoes?

1272
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:36,955
Come on, now.

1273
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,879
JAN: Soon we'll just see your feet
sticking out of there, Brutus.

1274
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:43,395
You all saw what he did to the mouse.

1275
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:48,355
I could've gone the rest of the day
without you bringing that up.

1276
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:50,318
I could've gone
the rest of the year.

1277
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:52,472
He did the same thing to me.

1278
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:54,831
He put his hands on me.

1279
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:57,591
He took my bladder infection away.

1280
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:03,230
It's true.

1281
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:05,710
When he came home that day, he was...

1282
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:08,479
...all better.

1283
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:12,753
DEAN: Now, wait.
You're talking about...

1284
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,592
...an authentic healing?

1285
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:17,114
A praise-Jesus miracle?

1286
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:19,034
I am.

1287
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:20,949
Oh, yeah.

1288
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:24,397
Well, if you say it, I accept it.

1289
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:27,197
What's it got to do with us?

1290
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:28,913
You're thinking about Melinda.

1291
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:30,559
Melinda?

1292
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:31,876
Melinda Moores?

1293
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:35,829
So, Paul, you really think
you can help her?

1294
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:40,439
It's not a bladder infection
or even a busted mouse...

1295
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:44,113
-...but there might be a chance.
-Hold on now.

1296
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:48,876
You're talking about our jobs.
Sneak a sick woman into a cellblock?

1297
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:51,236
No, Hal would never stand for that.

1298
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:53,954
You know him. He wouldn't believe
anything, even if it fell on him.

1299
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,758
So you're talking about...

1300
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:58,237
...taking John Coffey to her.

1301
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:05,554
That's more than just our jobs, Paul.

1302
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,879
That's prison time,
we get caught.

1303
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:10,998
-Dang right it is.
PAUL: No, not for you, Dean.

1304
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:14,152
The way I figure it,
you stay back on the Mile.

1305
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:15,992
That way, you can deny everything.

1306
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,199
Why do I have to stay behind?

1307
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:22,031
Our boy's grown up...

1308
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:23,508
...gone off to school.

1309
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:26,115
Harry's girls,
they're all married now.

1310
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:27,714
Brutal's a single man.

1311
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:31,191
You're the only one here with
two children, another on the way.

1312
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:34,472
Let's not discuss this as if
we're thinking of doing it.

1313
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:39,194
Brutal, help me out here.

1314
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:42,238
I'm sure she's a fine woman.

1315
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:43,879
The finest.

1316
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:46,156
PAUL: What is happening to her
is an offense, Brutal...

1317
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:48,755
...to the eye and the ear
and to the heart.

1318
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,718
I have no doubt.

1319
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:53,876
But we don't know her
like you and Jan do.

1320
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:57,112
And let's not forget,
John Coffey is a murderer.

1321
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:00,276
HARRY:
Now, what if he escapes?

1322
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:03,512
I'd hate to lose my job
or go to prison...

1323
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:06,832
...but I'd hate worse to have
a dead child on my conscience.

1324
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:08,798
I don't think that's gonna happen.

1325
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:11,759
In fact...

1326
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:15,992
...I don't think he did it at all.

1327
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,595
I do not see God putting
a gift like that...

1328
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:24,796
...in the hands of a man
who'd kill a child.

1329
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:29,312
That's a very tender notion, but
the man is on death row for the crime.

1330
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,035
And plus...

1331
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:34,232
...he's huge.

1332
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:39,316
If he tried to get away, it'd take
a lot of bullets to stop him.

1333
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:43,394
We'd all have shotguns,
in addition to side arms.

1334
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:44,954
I'd insist on that.

1335
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:48,839
BRUTAL: If he tried anything,
anything at all...

1336
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:51,317
...we'd have to take him down.

1337
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:52,869
You understand?

1338
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:05,514
So...

1339
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:07,952
...tell us what you had in mind.

1340

There it is.

1341
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:17,553

01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:29,671

get some too, ain't I?

01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:23,711
-My ass, you get some too.
-What makes you think you deserve any?

1352
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:26,316
Because I got a big pecker.

It's hot in here.

1361
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:53,990
It's hot in this cell, and I'm
dogged to drink. I'm thirsty.

1362
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:56,037
Why don't you give me some?

...or I'll drink this myself
right here.

mules and a crane to pick him up again.

Take it easy, John.
You gotta stay on your feet.

1549
02:16:10,120 --> 02:16:13,078
He'll never sit in Old Sparky.
You know that, don't you?

1550
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:15,476
He swallowed that stuff for a reason.

I give him a few days.

1552

One of us will do a cell check,
and he'll be dead on his bunk.

1553

Well, if that's his choice,
he's earned it.

Shut up and listen.

1579
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:30,754
You deserved to be punished for what
you did to Del. Accept it like a man.

Or else we'll make you sorry
you were ever born.

We'll tell people how you
sabotaged Del's execution...

...and pissed yourself like a frightened

you don't realize that?

except the people in this little room.

02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:07,638
I dreamed Mr. Jingles got down to
that place Boss Howell talked about.

1769
02:39:07,880 --> 02:39:10,075
That Mouseville place.

1770
02:39:10,400 --> 02:39:12,595
I dreamed there's kids.

1771
02:39:13,120 --> 02:39:16,476
And how they laughed
at his tricks. My!

1772
02:39:18,840 --> 02:39:22,435
I dreamed that those two little
blond-headed girls was there.

1773
02:39:22,680 --> 02:39:24,477
They's laughing too.

1774
02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:27,439
I put my arms around them
and set them on my knees.

1775
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:31,593
And they was no blood coming out
of they hair, and they's just fine.

1776
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:34,991
We all watched Mr. Jingles
roll that spool.

1777
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:39,716
How we did laugh.
Fit to bust, we was!

1778
02:39:54,960 --> 02:39:56,552
PAUL:
John?

1779
02:39:57,240 --> 02:40:01,119
They's lots of folks here
that hate me. Lots!

1780
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:04,911
I can feel it.

1781
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:06,838
It's like bees stinging me.

1782
02:40:07,160 --> 02:40:09,469
Well, feel how we feel, then.

1783
02:40:10,680 --> 02:40:11,795
We don't hate you.

1784
02:40:13,160 --> 02:40:14,718
BRUTAL:
Can you feel that?

1785
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:18,870
KLAUS:
Kill him twice, you boys!

1786
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:23,468
You go on and kill that raping
babykiller twice!

1787
02:40:23,720 --> 02:40:25,472
That'd be fine!

1788
02:40:41,480 --> 02:40:43,755
Wipe your face before
you stand up, Dean.

1789
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:45,228
Yes, sir.

1790
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:58,035
Roll on one.

1791
02:41:05,720 --> 02:41:09,110
MARJORIE:
Does it hurt yet? I hope it does.

1792
02:41:09,880 --> 02:41:12,030
I hope it hurts like hell.

1793
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:16,388
John Coffey, you've been condemned
to die in the electric chair...

1794
02:41:16,640 --> 02:41:17,789
...by a jury of your peers.

1795
02:41:18,040 --> 02:41:21,316
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1796
02:41:21,760 --> 02:41:24,832
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1797
02:41:26,520 --> 02:41:28,954
I'm sorry for what I am.

1798
02:41:40,520 --> 02:41:42,112
Please, boss...

1799
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:46,080
...don't put that thing over my face.

1800
02:41:47,200 --> 02:41:49,475
Don't put me in the dark.

1801
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:52,475
I's afraid of the dark.

1802
02:42:01,720 --> 02:42:03,358
All right, John.

1803
02:42:22,720 --> 02:42:25,553
SINGS:
Heaven, I'm in heaven

1804
02:42:25,800 --> 02:42:28,473
Heaven, heaven

1805
02:42:28,720 --> 02:42:30,472
I'm in heaven

1806
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,468
Heaven, heaven

1807
02:42:33,720 --> 02:42:35,358
I'm in heaven

1808
02:42:55,440 --> 02:42:56,953
John Coffey...

1809
02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:00,912
...electricity shall pass through
your body until you are dead...

1810
02:43:01,160 --> 02:43:03,196
...in accordance with state law.

1811
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:09,069
May God have mercy on your soul.

1812
02:43:41,960 --> 02:43:43,109
Paul...

1813
02:43:46,200 --> 02:43:48,031
You have to say it.

1814
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:51,830
You have to give the order.

1815
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:11,350
COFFEY:
He killed them with they love.

1816
02:44:11,600 --> 02:44:16,151
That's how it is every day
all over the world.

1817
02:44:29,440 --> 02:44:30,793
Roll on two.

1818
02:46:11,160 --> 02:46:14,436
PAUL: It was the last execution
I ever took part in.

1819
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:18,229
I just couldn't do it anymore
after that. Brutal either.

1820
02:46:19,400 --> 02:46:23,871
We both transferred out,
took jobs with Boys' Correctional.

1821
02:46:24,120 --> 02:46:25,792
It was all right.

1822
02:46:26,440 --> 02:46:29,238
"Catch them young" became my motto.

1823
02:46:32,360 --> 02:46:33,429
You don't believe me.

1824
02:46:34,240 --> 02:46:36,708
I don't imagine you'd lie to me, Paul.

1825
02:46:37,480 --> 02:46:39,471
-lt's just that...
-lt's quite a story.

1826
02:46:39,720 --> 02:46:41,870
It's quite a story.

1827
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:44,515
One thing I don't understand.

1828
02:46:44,760 --> 02:46:46,432
You said you and Jan...

1829
02:46:46,680 --> 02:46:50,070
...had a grown son in 1935.

1830
02:46:50,360 --> 02:46:51,793
Is that right?

1831
02:46:52,160 --> 02:46:54,037
The math doesn't work, does it?

1832
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:01,954
Do you feel up to taking a walk?

1833
02:47:21,840 --> 02:47:23,159
PAUL:
Watch your step.

1834
02:47:23,640 --> 02:47:25,870
Now let your eyes adjust.

1835
02:47:37,240 --> 02:47:38,229
There.

1836
02:47:41,880 --> 02:47:43,518
Wake up, old fella.

1837
02:47:43,800 --> 02:47:44,994
Wake up.

1838
02:47:48,480 --> 02:47:52,155
Paul, it isn't. It can't be.

1839
02:47:56,160 --> 02:47:57,479
Come over here, boy.

1840
02:47:57,920 --> 02:48:00,195
Come on over here and see this lady.

1841
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,912
That can't be Mr. Jingles.

1842
02:48:11,640 --> 02:48:13,517
(IN FRENCH)

1843
02:48:27,640 --> 02:48:30,108
PAUL:
Go on, you can do it.

1844
02:48:36,920 --> 02:48:41,232
This isn't exactly the Mouseville
we had in mind, is it?

1845
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:45,754
But we make do. Don't we, old fella?

1846
02:48:51,960 --> 02:48:55,509
I think Mr. Jingles
happened by accident.

1847
02:48:55,880 --> 02:49:00,556
I think when we electrocuted Del,
and it all went so badly...

1848
02:49:00,800 --> 02:49:02,995
...well, John could feel that,
you know.

1849
02:49:03,240 --> 02:49:06,516
And I think a part of...

1850
02:49:06,760 --> 02:49:09,320
...whatever magic was inside of him...

1851
02:49:09,600 --> 02:49:12,751
...just leapt into my tiny friend here.

1852
02:49:13,880 --> 02:49:15,791
As for me...

1853
02:49:16,920 --> 02:49:19,388
...John had to give me
a part of himself...

1854
02:49:19,640 --> 02:49:21,710
...a gift, the way he saw it...

1855
02:49:22,040 --> 02:49:25,350
...so that I could see for myself
what Wild Bill had done.

1856
02:49:27,680 --> 02:49:29,750
When John did that...

1857
02:49:31,160 --> 02:49:33,435
...when he took my hand...

1858
02:49:34,400 --> 02:49:38,075
...a part of the power
that worked through him...

1859
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:40,797
...spilled into me.

1860
02:49:41,120 --> 02:49:42,872
He...what?

1861
02:49:43,360 --> 02:49:46,716
He infected you with life?

1862
02:49:48,200 --> 02:49:50,475
It's as good a word as any.

1863
02:49:51,880 --> 02:49:54,633
He infected us both,
didn't he, Mr. Jingles?

1864
02:49:54,880 --> 02:49:56,313
With life.

1865
02:50:00,160 --> 02:50:03,152
I'm 108 years old, Elaine.

1866
02:50:03,400 --> 02:50:07,552
I was 44 the year that John Coffey
walked the Green Mile.

1867
02:50:10,400 --> 02:50:13,949
You mustn't blame John.
He couldn't help what happened.

1868
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:18,557
He was just a force of nature.

1869
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:23,039
I've lived to see
some amazing things, Ellie.

1870
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,878
Another century come to pass.

1871
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:33,752
But I've had to see my friends and
loved ones die off through the years.

1872
02:50:34,120 --> 02:50:36,111
Hal and Melinda...

1873
02:50:36,560 --> 02:50:37,879
...Brutus Howell...

1874
02:50:38,120 --> 02:50:40,680
...my wife, my boy.

1875
02:50:43,520 --> 02:50:45,317
And you, Elaine.

1876
02:50:46,240 --> 02:50:47,958
You'll die too.

1877
02:50:49,440 --> 02:50:53,592
And my curse is knowing
that I'll be there to see it.

1878
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,355
It's my atonement, you see.

1879
02:50:57,880 --> 02:50:59,518
It's my punishment...

1880
02:50:59,760 --> 02:51:02,228
...for letting John Coffey
ride the lightning.

1881
02:51:03,880 --> 02:51:06,553
For killing a miracle of God.

1882
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,719
PRIEST:
Almighty, everlasting God...

1883
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,230
...the source of all being and life.

1884
02:51:13,480 --> 02:51:17,632
PAUL: You'll be gone like all the
others. I'll have to stay.

1885
02:51:19,560 --> 02:51:23,599
I'll die eventually.
Of that I'm sure.

1886
02:51:24,320 --> 02:51:28,108
I have no illusions of immortality.

1887
02:51:28,520 --> 02:51:30,875
But I will have wished for death...

1888
02:51:31,600 --> 02:51:33,670
...long before death finds me.

1889
02:51:34,720 --> 02:51:38,395
In truth, I wish for it already.

1890
02:51:39,560 --> 02:51:41,949
(MAN SINGS OVER RADIO)

1891
02:51:49,960 --> 02:51:51,871
Mr. Jingles?

1892
02:52:00,520 --> 02:52:02,590
Where you been?

1893
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:06,117
Been worried about you, boy.
You hungry?

1894
02:52:06,920 --> 02:52:09,275
Let's see if we can find you
something to eat.

1895
02:52:10,360 --> 02:52:13,909
A few crumbs anyway.
I know you'd like that.

1896
02:52:15,360 --> 02:52:16,634
Look at you.

1897
02:52:18,240 --> 02:52:21,915
PAUL: I lie in bed most nights
thinking about it.

1898
02:52:22,160 --> 02:52:24,116
And I wait.

1899
02:52:24,960 --> 02:52:27,554
I think about all the people
I've loved...

1900
02:52:27,800 --> 02:52:29,870
...now long gone.

1901
02:52:30,600 --> 02:52:32,875
I think about my beautiful Jan...

1902
02:52:33,120 --> 02:52:35,998
...how I lost her so many years ago.

1903
02:52:37,360 --> 02:52:41,717
And I think about all of us walking
our own Green Mile...

1904
02:52:41,960 --> 02:52:44,554
...each in our own time.

1905
02:52:45,560 --> 02:52:48,597
But one thought
more than any other...

1906
02:52:48,840 --> 02:52:51,400
...keeps me awake most nights:

1907
02:52:52,520 --> 02:52:56,308
If he could make a mouse
live so long...

1908
02:52:56,760 --> 02:52:59,672
...how much longer do I have?

1909
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:05,474
We each owe a death.

1910
02:53:05,720 --> 02:53:08,109
There are no exceptions.

1911
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:10,751
But, oh, God...

1912
02:53:11,680 --> 02:53:13,398
...sometimes...

1913
02:53:13,920 --> 02:53:17,435
...the Green Mile seems so long.
