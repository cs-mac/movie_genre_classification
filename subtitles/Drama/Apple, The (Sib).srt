1
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:22,167
Hurry up, it's a big day.

2
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,626
You don't want to make the
bride wait for you, do you?

3
00:01:45,126 --> 00:01:46,959
The usual, boss.

4
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:51,376
Put it on my mom's tab.

5
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:52,376
All right, no problem

6
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:54,209
1994

7
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:56,542
I was 16 that year

8
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:58,792
Chang Yu-Sheng's voice was
still heard on TV shows.

9
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:02,709
Jacky Cheung sold more than one million
cassettes for the "KissGoodbye" album.

10
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:04,792
The bookies hadn't started watching CPBL

11
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,709
and the classic Dragon-Elephant games
were always sold out.

12
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:08,792
That year

13
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:11,792
a girl with tanned skin won the
championship on the local talent show

14
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:13,917
for five consecutive rounds.

15
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:16,126
That year...

16
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,584
Those years.

17
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:21,626
My name is Ko Ching-Teng.

18
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:23,792
My friends called me Ko-Teng

19
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:27,417
I went to Jingcheng in Changhua City
for junior high school.

20
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:30,376
As for high school, I stuck
to the same one, too.

21
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:35,417
This is Hsu Bo-Chun.

22
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:38,584
He has been my best friend
since junior high school.

23
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:41,292
He's always getting a boner

24
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:44,584
that's why we named him "Boner".

25
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:47,876
Fuck!

26
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,001
Fuck what?

27
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,334
You are dead meat. Don't run.

28
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:58,209
This is A-Ho.

29
00:02:58,334 --> 00:03:01,292
We have been in the same class all the way
from elementary to high school.

30
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:04,001
There is a fat guy in every story.

31
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:06,376
A-Ho is the fat guy in our story.

32
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:12,042
Stop bugging me.

33
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:14,042
Why not?

34
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:46,209
Good morning, Sir.

35
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:46,667
Good morning.

36
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:47,667
Good morning, Sir.

37
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:48,626
Good morning.

38
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:50,001
Good morning, Sir.

39
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:51,667
Good morning, Sir.

40
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:52,501
Good morning.

41
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:54,001
Good morning, Sir.

42
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:56,084
Your hair is too long.

43
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:57,709
It's time to get a haircut.

44
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:06,459
Gosh, can you stop that?

45
00:04:06,584 --> 00:04:07,459
What?

46
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:09,542
Stop doing that

47
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,959
I have told you a million times!

48
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:11,751
Why not?

49
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,209
You totally wasted my food

50
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:14,501
I only had one bite of that hotdog.

51
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:15,626
So...

52
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:19,084
Don't you know how to catch?

53
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:22,667
Cock Tsao.

54
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:23,959
Why are you such a jackass in the morning.

55
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:25,917
You know what?

56
00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:35,584
I won a Grant Hill 1 to 40
limited edition card yesterday.

57
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:37,751
This is Tsao.

58
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:41,417
We have been classmates ever since junior
high and he has always been an ass.

59
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,126
We called him.

60
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:48,292
(Cock, Cocky, Dumbass Tsao
or "Tsao motherfucker")

61
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:51,126
Show off?

62
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:56,376
We can switch then for your
1 to 100 Penny Hardaway cards.

63
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:57,709
No way!

64
00:04:58,292 --> 00:04:59,876
Piss off, then.

65
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:10,459
The only thing that these
boys shared in common with...

66
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:13,084
was that they all had a crush
on the honor student in the class.

67
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:15,084
Shen Chia-Yi.

68
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:17,417
From my point of view.

69
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:20,792
Shen Chia-Yi was only slightly prettier
than the other girls.

70
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:22,792
Don't know what the guys were thinking.

71
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:25,459
Shen Chia-Yi.

72
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:26,084
Yes?

73
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:28,001
Did you watch Rose Night yesterday?

74
00:05:29,084 --> 00:05:31,417
Are you talking about
the Taichi Gorge photo?

75
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:32,709
Yeah, the picture was horrifying

76
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:35,084
I got goose bumps all over.

77
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:37,292
The story sounds terrifying but...

78
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:39,876
I can't really tell from the picture though

79
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:42,334
I think it was the shooting
angle that does the trick.

80
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,417
You think so?

81
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:50,417
Now, start doing the exercises
for lesson five and six.

82
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:52,584
Continue after the assembly
if you can't finish.

83
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:53,709
Focus on your own exercises.

84
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:55,001
No discussion.

85
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:56,834
This is Liao Ying-Hung.

86
00:05:57,376 --> 00:05:58,292
His surname, Liao, is a verb in Chinese.

87
00:05:58,417 --> 00:05:59,334
And it means to scratch.

88
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:01,917
Since it's a verb

89
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:03,751
we should make good use of this verb.

90
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:06,084
Thus, we gave him a nickname.

91
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:07,376
"Groin" (Scratching Groin)

92
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:11,876
"Groin" likes Shen Chia-Yi, too.

93
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:14,292
That's because he likes
every girl in the class.

94
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,084
It's early morning and
everyone looks half asleep.

95
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,959
Stand straight.

96
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:00,251
Wake up!

97
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:01,292
Stand straight.

98
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:11,501
Stop moving.

99
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:22,792
Stand up.

100
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:26,001
Attention.

101
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:27,334
Salute.

102
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:30,001
Good morning, Miss Chou.

103
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:32,251
Good morning, everyone. Sit down.

104
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:33,667
In year 1974, it was
still the Qing dynasty.

105
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:34,334
So it means that.

106
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:36,584
It was the thirty second year that China
was ruled under Emperor Qianlong.

107
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:39,292
There was really not that much difference
between junior high and senior high.

108
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,084
Just a matter of how deep you are in hell.

109
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:46,251
Endless studies, exams...
it's all very boring!

110
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:49,626
There is the character, the
time and then it's the place.

111
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:51,584
Where is the place?

112
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:57,376
The place...

113
00:07:58,001 --> 00:08:02,001
But, we can always find a
way to entertain ourselves!

114
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:07,709
Hsu Bo-Chun

115
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:09,834
stand up and read the next section.

116
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:14,959
Stand up and read.

117
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:19,542
You don't even know where we are.

118
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:20,751
Hello... are you in the classroom.

119
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:22,834
Ko Ching-Teng

120
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:24,834
what are you laughing at?

121
00:09:25,251 --> 00:09:26,001
You read it.

122
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:31,542
(Reading paragraphs from the textbook)

123
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:32,667
Stand up and read.

124
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,209
It's not very convenient.

125
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:39,042
What do you mean "not very convenient"?

126
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:40,001
Stand up.

127
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:50,834
Jerking off.

128
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,751
Jerking off right in the class

129
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:54,834
I have been a teacher for so many years

130
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,501
I have seen students who cheat

131
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:57,667
get into fights

132
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,001
black mail.

133
00:09:59,126 --> 00:10:01,376
Or even those who beat up teachers!

134
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,042
I have seen all kinds
of problematic students

135
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,126
but just no perverts like you!

136
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:07,667
I didn't even ejaculate.

137
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:08,959
And that's an excuse?

138
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,292
Yeah.

139
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:11,001
We were just fooling around...

140
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:12,417
You, too.

141
00:10:15,626 --> 00:10:18,667
Your parents spent so much money
to send you to school

142
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:20,834
and you guys don't even
cherish how lucky you are.

143
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:23,709
What's jerk off?

144
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,709
Jerking off in the classroom.

145
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,376
Hey?

146
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:31,084
I don't know.

147
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:35,792
Shen Chia-Yi

148
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:37,251
come out here for a second.

149
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:45,126
Shen Chia-Yi

150
00:10:45,251 --> 00:10:47,292
from now on, Ko Ching-Teng
will sit in front of you.

151
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:49,417
Keep an eye on him for me.

152
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:51,792
Don't let him be a bad influence on others.

153
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,751
Give him a push on his schoolwork, as well.

154
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:54,876
Okay?

155
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:02,792
Hsu Bo-Chun.

156
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,001
In the future

157
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:05,626
you will sit in front of Hsieh Ming-Ho.

158
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:06,626
The same goes for you.

159
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,251
Don't goof around again.

160
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,917
If you do, I will ask your
parents to come to school.

161
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:10,959
Get it?

162
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:12,001
Got it.

163
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:14,542
Now, go to your class.

164
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:16,876
Thank you, sir.

165
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:29,751
Even though Shen Chia-Yi and I have been
in the same class ever since junior high

166
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:32,501
the distance between an honor student
and a bad student

167
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:35,167
always stayed the same.

168
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:39,876
It's shitty luck to sit
in such a shitty seat.

169
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:42,792
Who has bad luck now?

170
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:43,917
You are sitting in front of me now.

171
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:45,709
You better stop your childish pranks.

172
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,001
So you don't bring me unnecessary troubles.

173
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:49,667
It must be nice to be an honor student.

174
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,876
Just because you have good marks

175
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,501
doesn't mean you can boss people around.

176
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:54,501
Who cares about what you think?

177
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:57,084
Don't mind him, don't let him bother you.

178
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:58,584
That's right.

179
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:01,167
He just likes to masturbate
in the classroom.

180
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:02,751
Fuck.

181
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:06,834
The reason you like to goof around is because
you don't concentrate on your studies.

182
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:08,459
Yeah.

183
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:11,792
You're so clever, you are such a smart ass.

184
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:19,917
A nerd like Shen Chia-Yi

185
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:23,417
likes to poke her nose into other people's
business whenever she gets a chance.

186
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:07,251
All you do is drawing these
retarded figures every day.

187
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:08,626
Where's the future in that?

188
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:09,626
It's none of your business

189
00:13:09,751 --> 00:13:12,459
I'm pretty much minding my own business.
I just want to have a good laugh.

190
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:15,167
Moron.

191
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:18,334
How come every retard you drew is bald?

192
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:20,709
Do you discriminate against
bald heads or retards?

193
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,751
Mind your own business.

194
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:38,167
Man, you are as slow as a turtle!

195
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,084
Bye.

196
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:13,334
Ko-Teng.

197
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,167
Ko-Teng.

198
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:17,209
What?

199
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,251
Stop giving Shen Chia-Yi a hard time.

200
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:22,792
Yeah right.

201
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:26,084
That's all.

202
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:28,209
That's all???

203
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:41,084
Every man wants to be the strongest man.

204
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:42,792
Including me.

205
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:44,167
One day

206
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:47,542
I will be as strong as my master.

207
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:51,251
You are D.E.A.D.

208
00:14:58,042 --> 00:15:02,709
The fact that I am so reckless
has got something to do with my family.

209
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:05,584
Ma, shampoo is out.

210
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:09,042
Hey, put some clothes on.

211
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:10,834
You're a grown-up now

212
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,417
I know, it has grown so big, right?

213
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:22,876
My father also likes to walk around
butt naked in the house.

214
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:27,292
The school called today.

215
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:32,959
What's the big deal about coed school?

216
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,292
Concentrate at school.

217
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:37,542
Stop goofing around.

218
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:42,001
What did I do?

219
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:48,584
Eat first, while it's still hot.

220
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,876
Talk later.

221
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:58,084
Why are your grades always
in the bottom percentile?

222
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,417
Is it because you are thinking about
girls all the time, is that why?

223
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:04,709
No, I am not interested in girls!

224
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,751
I'm not interested in guys, either.

225
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,292
Speaking of girls.

226
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:17,417
Each one of my good friend

227
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:20,751
liked Shen Chia-Yi in a different way.

228
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:24,501
Groin, what are you doing?

229
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:25,626
Shen Chia-Yi

230
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,292
I have just invented a new magic trick

231
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:28,959
I want you to be the first one to see it.

232
00:16:29,084 --> 00:16:31,001
Hu Chia-Wei, do you want to see it, too.

233
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:31,876
Is it a prank?

234
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:33,792
No way. It's amazing.

235
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:35,834
Look closely.

236
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:38,084
Basically, Groin was on the right track.

237
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:39,334
It's to cheer the girls
up and make them laugh.

238
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:42,001
Nothing in this hand, either.

239
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:47,001
Look closely.

240
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:56,126
Groin, you are such a bore.

241
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,334
Besides Groin's retarded magic.

242
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,542
Tsao had a very different
way to make girls happy.

243
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:07,751
Shen Chia-Yi.

244
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:11,917
Tsao Kuo-Sheng.

245
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:13,376
And no one gets it.

246
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:18,251
A-Ho liked to read what grown-ups read.

247
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:21,167
So he knew many things that we didn't.

248
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:22,709
Shen Chia-Yi.

249
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,542
Do you remember the Air
Supply album that I lent you.

250
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:27,376
Um... I remember.

251
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,626
They are coming next month.

252
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:32,084
Do you want to go if I have tickets?

253
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,042
To Taipei?

254
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,334
We can take the train.

255
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:38,084
Hu Chia-Wei.

256
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:39,709
Do you want to go with us?

257
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:40,876
Yes, sure.

258
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:42,501
Sounds fun.

259
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:46,334
The adult's way is the most subtle way
to chase after Shen Chia-Yi.

260
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,042
Who is Air Supply?

261
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:56,584
Someone said.

262
00:17:56,709 --> 00:18:01,084
Showing one's clumsy side
is also another way to pursuit girls

263
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:02,126
I think.

264
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:04,792
Boner has tried this many times.

265
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:07,542
Hsu Bo-Chun.

266
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,251
Can you stop playing?

267
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:12,459
And it proves that his
way doesn't work at all.

268
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,751
Me? Yes, there's also a girl I like.

269
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:26,584
But it's unlikely that we can develop
anything at that point in time.

270
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:29,042
That's fine

271
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:30,542
I will grow up.

272
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,876
One clay, I will turn to be
the man that deserves her.

273
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:42,501
That day.

274
00:18:42,626 --> 00:18:44,542
Nobody knew if the English teacher
had lost money in the stock market

275
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:46,376
or her menstruation period went wild.

276
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,376
She had a shitty face.

277
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:51,251
She looked like she was
about to kill someone.

278
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,209
Stand up.

279
00:18:56,751 --> 00:18:58,251
Sit down. Let's begin

280
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:03,959
I thought

281
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:07,376
it would be great fun to see the
smart ass student, Shen Chia-Yi

282
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:09,584
makes a blunder

283
00:19:12,292 --> 00:19:13,292
I meant.

284
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:14,501
"I thought."

285
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,417
Stand up if you didn't bring your textbook.

286
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,084
Ko Ching-Teng

287
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,376
we have gone through a
third of this semester.

288
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:32,751
And you don't even have your English
textbook with you, which we use every day.

289
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:34,292
Are you serious about getting an education?

290
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:35,542
Chair.

291
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,584
Don't you know private
schools are expensive?

292
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,584
If you don't even have your textbook

293
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:49,292
then why do you even
bother coming to school?

294
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:50,709
Here to eat your lunchbox?

295
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:53,709
Lunch is essential!
Of course I have to eat it.

296
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,834
You think you're very funny, huh?

297
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,667
Have you no shame?

298
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:06,292
Raise your arms higher.

299
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:08,709
Raise them higher.

300
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,376
So weak! Didn't you eat?

301
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:15,001
Go do 10 rounds of squat jumps outside.

302
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,334
Did I ask you to put your hands down?

303
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:20,876
Higher!

304
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:26,334
(Reciting English textbook)

305
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:28,126
my friends

306
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:32,501
that in spite of the difficulties
and frustrations of the moment

307
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,376
I still have a dream

308
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:39,376
that in spite of the difficulties
and frustrations of the moment

309
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:41,334
I still have a dream.

310
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:49,459
It is a dream deeply rooted
in the American dream

311
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:52,292
I have a dream

312
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,792
that one day this nation will rise up.

313
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:58,001
(Shen Chia-Yi would be kind of cute
if she wasn't such a prude)

314
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:03,792
and live up the true meaning of its dream.

315
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:21,417
What are you thinking?

316
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:23,292
You've been weird all day long.

317
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:24,959
Nothing.

318
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:28,792
Do you need an exorcism?

319
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:32,376
You are thinking too much.

320
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,876
Head office announcement

321
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:45,626
Jay Chou in third year

322
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:47,042
please come to the head office now.

323
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:48,917
Sweet.

324
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:04,876
What?

325
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,417
Thank you for yesterday.

326
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:10,417
No big deal. I have no shame anyway.

327
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:15,834
Thank you.

328
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,626
Why not just buy me a drink?

329
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:25,959
It's weird to hear you
keep on saying "thank you".

330
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:29,792
Can I ask you a question?

331
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,209
Go ahead.

332
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:32,667
Why don't you want to study?

333
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:37,709
It's not like I don't want to

334
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:39,126
I am afraid if I really tried

335
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:42,292
I would be so good that I
would even scare myself.

336
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:43,709
You better watch out then if I do study

337
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:46,334
I would beat you immediately.

338
00:22:50,209 --> 00:22:51,501
Wanna take up the challenge?

339
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:53,376
Sure, why not.

340
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:19,917
Ko Ching-Teng.

341
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:30,501
What?

342
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,334
This is a quiz I made up myself.

343
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,542
Take it and do it at home.

344
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,209
Bring it back tomorrow.

345
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:43,876
Are you for real?

346
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:45,792
A quiz made out of love.

347
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:54,834
And here is a math exercise book.

348
00:23:56,959 --> 00:24:00,001
See the questions I've highlighted in yellow?
Do them three times.

349
00:24:00,126 --> 00:24:03,042
You will probably score at
least 50% in the next quiz.

350
00:24:03,626 --> 00:24:04,709
Only 50%

351
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:08,626
I didn't say it's easy to get good grades

352
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:10,834
I will give you some harder problems

353
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:12,709
after you finish the basics.

354
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:15,042
What do I owe you?

355
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:16,459
Why should I listen to you?

356
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:18,834
Because I don't want to look down on you.

357
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,376
Yeah right!

358
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,251
You can be so stuck up just because
you have good grades.

359
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:25,042
Go on then, I don't really care

360
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:28,667
I don't look down on people with bad grades

361
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:29,542
I look down on you because

362
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:31,792
you pick on people with good grades

363
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:34,334
while you don't even try to work hard.

364
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:51,417
Put on some clothes.

365
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:52,751
Otherwise you'll catch a cold.

366
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:53,751
That's impossible.

367
00:24:53,876 --> 00:24:55,751
My master is Bruce Lee.

368
00:24:55,876 --> 00:24:57,667
Swallow your food before you speak.

369
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,584
Why is our tissue paper
running out so fast?

370
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:28,126
What?

371
00:25:28,251 --> 00:25:29,417
Your quiz.

372
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:47,834
You made so many mistakes.

373
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:50,667
You did the problems without reading
the exercise book, didn't you?

374
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,667
You can find the answers for these
two problems in the exercise book.

375
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:56,959
This one is harder.

376
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:58,917
It's not the kind of problem
you can solve with a formula.

377
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:01,459
You need to use these theories.

378
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:03,626
You go home and read the parts I circled.

379
00:26:08,876 --> 00:26:10,376
It's such a pain to study.

380
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:13,751
That's why people who are
good at studying rule.

381
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:21,042
Why are you helping Ko Ching-Teng to study?

382
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:24,167
Did you see his grades?

383
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,751
It's none of your business.

384
00:26:28,626 --> 00:26:30,167
They are really bad.

385
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:33,334
Still, it has nothing to do with you.

386
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:40,001
Miss, this is yours and this is yours.

387
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:42,167
Thank you!

388
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:50,376
It's so not you

389
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:56,126
I hate people who are lazy and have
no sense of self-awareness at all.

390
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:58,959
Ok

391
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:03,501
I'm not talking about you.

392
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:07,417
You sure?

393
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:22,126
It's so boring to study

394
00:27:22,584 --> 00:27:25,084
I don't understand
why Shen Chia-Yi can do this every day.

395
00:27:26,751 --> 00:27:29,334
Do you have any idea?

396
00:27:30,084 --> 00:27:31,292
Let me tell you.

397
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,126
Being able to solve these
tricky math questions.

398
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,251
Does nothing good in life!

399
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:48,292
Here.

400
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:52,376
Why do you work so hard?

401
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:54,751
No, I just study when I feel like it.

402
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:56,834
If you want to study, study hard then.

403
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,251
What do you mean "when you feel like it"?

404
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:00,251
Fine, I will think about it.

405
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,042
Eat porridge.

406
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:11,834
Don't finish it too quickly.

407
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:45,542
By the way

408
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:49,917
there was a new shipment in the store a few days ago.
The whole package was unopened

409
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:52,042
so the store owner wants to
sell the whole thing together.

410
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:56,501
Do you think I should buy the whole
package of SKYBOX or two boxes of CC?

411
00:28:56,626 --> 00:28:58,334
SKYBOX is too expensive.

412
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:02,042
So, two boxes of CC?

413
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:03,709
How many times did you jerk off yesterday?

414
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:05,167
Why are you so tired?

415
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:08,417
Jerk off your ass.

416
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:11,459
Mind your own business.

417
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:12,751
Fuck!

418
00:29:14,126 --> 00:29:15,042
Get up and eat your meatballs.

419
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:16,876
If you don't eat it, I'm
going to finish yours, too.

420
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:21,834
Shen Chia-Yi, check out my new magic.

421
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:31,959
You idiot.

422
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:33,209
Not bad!

423
00:29:33,334 --> 00:29:34,209
Gross!

424
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:35,709
It's the best this year.

425
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:37,042
Isn't it?

426
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:39,334
What are you guys doing?

427
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:40,084
It's a new magic.

428
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:40,959
For real? Show me! Show me!

429
00:29:41,084 --> 00:29:42,001
I will show you.

430
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:42,959
It's gross.

431
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:52,417
Just pretend that you are
drinking, but don't swallow it.

432
00:29:59,334 --> 00:29:59,709
You suck.

433
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:01,417
You are so gross.

434
00:30:05,334 --> 00:30:06,167
Make correction

435
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:07,417
10 minutes.

436
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:09,626
Because I am so damn smart

437
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:11,667
5 minutes is more than enough.

438
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,626
Don't study in the toilet

439
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:27,542
I am going to pee in my pants.

440
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:29,626
Ma, stop scaring me.

441
00:30:29,751 --> 00:30:31,292
Why would I?

442
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,292
Dump it out and come out.

443
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:39,417
Hurry up.

444
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:51,042
Why are you up so late?

445
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:52,417
What the hell are you doing in there?

446
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:54,542
I am studying English

447
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:56,376
English is useless for you

448
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:58,751
I FUCK YOU

449
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:00,334
Go to sleep

450
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:06,417
I sleep late because I
study English very hard.

451
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:10,251
Hsieh Ming-Ho

452
00:31:11,459 --> 00:31:12,917
87%

453
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:15,376
Not bad, not bad.

454
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:16,876
Keep it up

455
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:21,584
Chang Chia-Chi

456
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:24,084
44%

457
00:31:24,209 --> 00:31:26,001
Work harder.

458
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:28,334
Ko Ching-Teng

459
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:29,876
75%

460
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:36,209
You have been studying hard lately?

461
00:31:36,334 --> 00:31:37,667
Not really, I am a genius.

462
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:40,042
Then, be a genius from now on.

463
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:42,959
Okay, Class dismiss.

464
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:46,376
Remember the test next week.

465
00:31:46,501 --> 00:31:47,626
Genius?

466
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:48,751
Are you serious?

467
00:31:50,751 --> 00:31:54,709
It's not a big deal that you know
how to solve these problems

468
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:55,876
I bet you

469
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:58,876
in 10 years time, I wouldn't
even know what log is

470
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,876
and it makes no difference to my life.

471
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:01,667
Emmmm...

472
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:04,292
You don't believe me?

473
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:05,667
I do.

474
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:07,751
Then, why do you still work so hard?

475
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:11,376
You don't expect returns
from everything you do.

476
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:15,542
You really like to pitch high
notes like adults, don't you?

477
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:21,376
It will be no help to your life whatsoever
if you continue to be so childish like this.

478
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:23,334
How would you know

479
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:24,959
if you've never been childish ever?

480
00:32:25,084 --> 00:32:28,001
You know something is
meaningless without trying it.

481
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:41,501
This is shit.

482
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:43,292
Next group

483
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:54,084
I heard you will become a
zombie if you are bitten by one

484
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:58,126
I don't buy that.

485
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:00,251
This must be some rumors.

486
00:33:00,376 --> 00:33:02,084
But he had to learn this
from somewhere, right?

487
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:03,292
What are we going to do?

488
00:33:05,626 --> 00:33:06,376
Hey.

489
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:12,376
What?

490
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:15,876
Have you heard that rumor lately?

491
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:18,834
You mean the one that every
girl wants to date me?

492
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:20,542
Moron.

493
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,334
Okay, what is it?

494
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:27,376
I heard some stowaways
from China were drowned.

495
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:28,959
And they had became zombies

496
00:33:29,084 --> 00:33:30,542
after their bodies were washed up on shore.

497
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:34,251
Oh! Those zombies

498
00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:35,501
I've heard about them.

499
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:41,001
They jumped, jumped and
jumped all the way here.

500
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:42,626
Shit.

501
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:43,709
Are you for real?

502
00:33:44,209 --> 00:33:45,001
Of course.

503
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:47,792
With whole bunch of people jumping
around up in the hills at night

504
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:49,167
what do you think they are?

505
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:54,084
Yes, I remember seeing that on
the newspaper a few days ago.

506
00:33:54,876 --> 00:33:57,417
If they jumped harder

507
00:33:57,542 --> 00:33:59,667
they should have reached
Baguashan Mountain by now.

508
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:23,834
So, do you want to see them?

509
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:25,917
No way

510
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:30,584
I don't think you can see
them even if they are real.

511
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:34,459
Maybe they got lost in Baguashan Mountain

512
00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:37,501
and jumped directly into Changhua city.

513
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:40,209
Don't think it's impossible.

514
00:34:40,334 --> 00:34:42,376
Zombies don't have a sense of direction.

515
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:02,126
What?

516
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:05,626
You and Shen Chia-Yi seem
to have a lot to talk about lately.

517
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,042
Do me a favor.

518
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:08,376
No way.

519
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:10,376
Don't tell me you want
to write a love letter?

520
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:12,042
You write it

521
00:35:12,459 --> 00:35:13,751
and I copy it

522
00:35:13,876 --> 00:35:16,709
I don't think one drink is enough

523
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:18,417
if she says yes

524
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:19,876
I will buy you one year worth.

525
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:24,834
Plus a Grant Hill 100:1 All-Star Card.

526
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:28,501
Alright, deal.

527
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:53,751
Ko Ching-Teng.

528
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:55,501
Are you going to cram school tonight?

529
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:57,626
What for?

530
00:35:57,751 --> 00:35:59,667
You are so dumb, how can you not go!

531
00:36:03,626 --> 00:36:04,834
Mind your own business.

532
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:07,917
Starting tonight

533
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,376
you stay here and study after school.

534
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,709
Stay at school?

535
00:36:12,459 --> 00:36:14,584
What's your problem?

536
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:16,209
I will stay, too.

537
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:18,959
What the hell?

538
00:36:25,376 --> 00:36:27,417
It turned out that Shen Chia-Yi
stayed behind to study

539
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:29,834
when she didn't have to go to cram school.

540
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:42,667
So, you asked me to stay
behind at school with you

541
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:44,084
only because you are afraid
of those zombies, right?

542
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:46,667
I am just worried you're getting stupid.

543
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:57,334
Right.

544
00:36:57,876 --> 00:37:01,042
Tsao asked me to give you this letter.

545
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:13,042
My dear Shen Chia-Yi

546
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:14,292
I like you very much.

547
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:18,167
As the song goes,
"Nothing's gonna change my love for you.

548
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:20,709
Making love out of nothing at all"

549
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:24,126
barely expresses my feelings for you.

550
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:27,001
This is your handwriting.

551
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:32,126
Ko Ching-Teng

552
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,584
I must say

553
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,751
you suck at writing love letters.

554
00:37:36,876 --> 00:37:37,876
What do you mean?

555
00:37:38,001 --> 00:37:40,334
I am that close to William
Shakespeare, okay?

556
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,042
Since you have the time to write
love letters for someone else.

557
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:45,834
Why don't you use the time
to memorize some English vocabulary?

558
00:37:54,626 --> 00:37:55,584
Ok.

559
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:59,792
Even though I am cute, smart
and incredibly humorous

560
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:02,417
don't fall in love with me easily.

561
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:07,251
Because I am a lone wolf
traveling in the wild wind.

562
00:38:07,376 --> 00:38:08,542
Oh, thanks

563
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,417
I'm not interested in guys
who are dumber than me.

564
00:38:10,626 --> 00:38:12,709
Shen Chia-Yi doesn't like
guys that are dumber than her.

565
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:13,876
Dumb?

566
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,584
Come on, I let you win on purpose

567
00:38:16,709 --> 00:38:18,626
I don't study hard cause
I don't want to beat you

568
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:20,084
and I don't want to hurt your feelings!

569
00:38:21,251 --> 00:38:22,542
Pardon me.

570
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,792
Save your kindness, mister.
You are welcome to try to beat me anytime!

571
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:28,834
I dare you to bet with me.

572
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:33,376
Let's bet on...

573
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:34,834
Your hair.

574
00:38:36,084 --> 00:38:36,834
How?

575
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:39,751
If you beat me in the next midterm

576
00:38:39,876 --> 00:38:41,542
you can do whatever you want to me.

577
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:43,292
But, if I won

578
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,709
you will have to wear a
ponytail for a month.

579
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,376
Sure, whatever.

580
00:38:49,501 --> 00:38:51,501
It's not like you would win anyway!

581
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:55,667
I was struck by her cocky
confidence right away.

582
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:29,584
Hey, you.

583
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:30,584
Why on earth you need to
study freaking English

584
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:32,751
in the middle of the night?

585
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:45,459
I fuck you

586
00:39:46,126 --> 00:39:47,334
I fuck you too

587
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:50,709
I fuck your mother.

588
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:57,084
What's wrong with you?

589
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:08,084
Fuck you fuck you

590
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:09,876
I love you

591
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:11,584
I LOVE YOU

592
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:16,376
Hey, Ma'am.

593
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:18,334
A super hot and charming jar head, please.

594
00:41:18,751 --> 00:41:20,792
Idiot, how can a jar head be handsome?

595
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:22,001
Of course there is.

596
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:23,626
Give it a try if you don't believe me.

597
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:43,542
Here, I don't owe you any more.

598
00:41:58,709 --> 00:41:59,917
Stop that.

599
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:01,917
Rumor has it that Inoue Takehiko
has died a couple weeks ago!

600
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:05,876
I heard that he died in a car accident.

601
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:06,917
Really.

602
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:10,792
No wonder I felt something was different
in his drawing style.

603
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:16,834
More powerful that is,
how can such a genius die just like that.

604
00:42:51,584 --> 00:42:52,751
Don't you think...

605
00:42:52,876 --> 00:42:54,042
Think What?

606
00:42:54,876 --> 00:42:58,042
Don't you think Shen Chia-Yi likes me?

607
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:00,834
If not, why would she
wear a ponytail today?

608
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:02,542
Maybe!

609
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:07,126
How did Shen Chia-Yi
know I like girls who wear ponytails?

610
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:08,667
You too?

611
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:11,501
I always like girls who wear ponytails.

612
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:12,792
So do!

613
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:16,709
I don't know why Shen Chia-Yi wore a ponytail
that day even though she won the bet.

614
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:18,542
However, ever since then

615
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:22,626
studying hard had become an
enthusiastic thing for me.

616
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:37,959
The class funds went missing.

617
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:43,584
It was still here when the class leader
checked about an hour ago.

618
00:43:44,334 --> 00:43:46,167
Now school is almost finished.

619
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:52,501
Who else could have stolen that money?

620
00:43:53,292 --> 00:43:55,751
It must be someone sitting
in this classroom!

621
00:43:59,084 --> 00:44:02,251
Whoever stole that money,
you better turn yourself in right now.

622
00:44:02,917 --> 00:44:05,584
Otherwise, don't blame me for
being too harsh afterwards.

623
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:15,501
Fine.

624
00:44:18,584 --> 00:44:20,667
It's okay if no one wants to admit it

625
00:44:22,501 --> 00:44:25,792
I guarantee that the thief is
sitting right here in this room.

626
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:29,042
The person must thinks that
he can get away with this.

627
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,334
Good

628
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:34,667
very good.

629
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:38,417
Now, take out your pen, everyone.

630
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:42,292
And write down the name of the person that
you think it's most likely to be the thief.

631
00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:45,667
The top three named

632
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:49,334
will have to bring your bags forward,
and I will check them personally.

633
00:44:53,501 --> 00:44:54,834
Now!

634
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:57,209
Take out your paper right now.

635
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,167
Tsao Kuo-Sheng.

636
00:45:04,292 --> 00:45:05,667
What are you doing?

637
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:07,042
Sir.

638
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:09,001
Who do you think you are to have
us suspect our own classmates?

639
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:12,167
Now who is the supervisor? Are you or am I?

640
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:16,376
You are, sir.

641
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:17,792
But you are an ass hole!

642
00:45:18,417 --> 00:45:19,292
What did you say?

643
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:20,959
I said you are an asshole.

644
00:45:22,209 --> 00:45:24,417
Ko Ching-Teng, Tsao Kuo-Sheng

645
00:45:24,542 --> 00:45:27,292
I think you guys are bluffing

646
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:31,834
bring your bags now and I
will check yours first.

647
00:45:32,626 --> 00:45:33,542
Excuse me, Sir.

648
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:34,834
You have no right to do that

649
00:45:36,251 --> 00:45:37,834
I have no right to do what?

650
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:40,542
You can't ask us to write down names
and vote on such a thing.

651
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:42,542
You can't ask us to suspect
our own classmates.

652
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:44,959
We can just all pay the fees again.

653
00:45:45,084 --> 00:45:46,626
It's no big deal.

654
00:45:46,751 --> 00:45:47,584
Exactly.

655
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:48,834
We can just pay again.

656
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:53,126
Being an honor student doesn't mean
that you can say whatever you want.

657
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,167
Bring your bag over here.

658
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:56,667
No way.

659
00:45:57,001 --> 00:45:58,459
We are not thieves.

660
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:02,376
Douche.

661
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:04,042
What did you say?

662
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:05,459
I said you are a douchebag.

663
00:46:07,084 --> 00:46:09,084
Bring your bags over now, all of you.

664
00:46:10,459 --> 00:46:11,251
No.

665
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:18,084
Sir

666
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:20,626
I now suspect that you have no balls.

667
00:46:20,751 --> 00:46:21,792
Take your pants off now.

668
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:22,959
What did you say?

669
00:46:23,084 --> 00:46:23,917
Take your pants off.

670
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:25,626
Bring your bags over.

671
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:28,126
Fine, here you go!

672
00:46:40,792 --> 00:46:42,584
Stop staring at me.

673
00:46:42,709 --> 00:46:44,334
It's very embarrassing. I feel so ashamed.

674
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:46,876
There is nothing to be ashamed of.

675
00:46:47,001 --> 00:46:48,126
You kicked ass!

676
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:51,126
Don't need to be too serious about this.

677
00:46:51,251 --> 00:46:52,376
Shen Chia-Yi.

678
00:46:53,084 --> 00:46:54,209
Relax a bit.

679
00:46:55,792 --> 00:46:57,542
Just pretend, it's no big deal.

680
00:46:57,667 --> 00:47:00,417
Those teachers are not watching anyway.

681
00:47:01,626 --> 00:47:04,251
It's kind of nice to be a bad
student once in a while, isn't it?

682
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:06,584
I am so ashamed.

683
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:11,001
Ever since I knew you from junior high

684
00:47:12,001 --> 00:47:14,292
that was the only time
I was amazed by how tough you really are.

685
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:17,542
Shen Chia-Yi, you rock!

686
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:19,542
You look so pretty even when you cry.

687
00:47:20,001 --> 00:47:20,751
Yeah.

688
00:47:21,501 --> 00:47:22,709
Super duper cool.

689
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:26,209
Unbelievably cool.

690
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:38,376
Unlike quizzes

691
00:47:39,042 --> 00:47:42,084
you never find a correct answer in life.

692
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:46,209
No one really knew who stole our money,
but no one really cared.

693
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:50,334
All I remembered from that
day was Shen Chia-Yi's face

694
00:47:50,459 --> 00:47:53,167
beautifully and delicately
engraved in my heart.

695
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:14,959
Six years ago, when we first stepped
in to Jing-Cheng high school

696
00:48:15,334 --> 00:48:18,501
we were all young and immature.

697
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:22,417
Although we had great
dreams about our future

698
00:48:22,542 --> 00:48:27,334
we weren't really sure what we were going
to learn and encounter during these years.

699
00:48:28,501 --> 00:48:32,001
Thanks to the teachers who led us and
furnished us with abundant knowledge.

700
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:35,084
Thanks to all the peers
who accompanied us throughout the years

701
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:39,959
with bitter and sweet memories.

702
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:45,251
Ching-Chen high school
represents our young and crazy days

703
00:48:45,376 --> 00:48:47,626
it gave us the most
wonderful times of our life.

704
00:48:48,251 --> 00:48:49,251
From now on

705
00:48:49,376 --> 00:48:54,292
it's time for us to spread our
wings and chase our dreams.

706
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:56,292
So long, my friends.

707
00:48:57,084 --> 00:49:00,667
So long, my friends.

708
00:49:49,126 --> 00:49:50,292
How I envy you.

709
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:53,751
You have so many guys chasing
after you throughout the years!

710
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:58,084
Yes, it's quite nice to
be liked by someone.

711
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:00,167
But...

712
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:06,292
Don't tell me that you feel annoyed
because you are too popular.

713
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:07,542
No

714
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:13,959
I just think that I am a very lucky girl.

715
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:18,209
So, have you decided?

716
00:50:18,709 --> 00:50:19,917
Decided what?

717
00:50:20,042 --> 00:50:23,251
Decided whom you want to be with.

718
00:50:26,876 --> 00:50:29,292
Come on, you can't even tell me?

719
00:50:33,751 --> 00:50:34,334
Ok, if...

720
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:38,501
I will be really happy.

721
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:50,917
Happy graduation.

722
00:50:58,167 --> 00:51:00,334
Finally, the colleague entrance exam came.

723
00:51:01,209 --> 00:51:04,417
To me, the exam was more like a test for
Shen Chia-Yi's special training programs

724
00:51:04,542 --> 00:51:07,417
rather than an exam for college.

725
00:51:34,751 --> 00:51:40,626
We spent most of our time at the beach
during the summer before college.

726
00:52:21,959 --> 00:52:22,834
They are so childish

727
00:52:22,959 --> 00:52:24,459
I know, so childish.

728
00:52:27,126 --> 00:52:28,876
You don't really like
childish guys, do you?

729
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:29,834
No.

730
00:52:31,459 --> 00:52:33,584
Who do you think
is the most childish one among them all.

731
00:52:35,042 --> 00:52:36,501
Ko-Teng, maybe?

732
00:52:41,459 --> 00:52:42,501
How about me?

733
00:52:46,626 --> 00:52:48,876
You are so childish.

734
00:53:12,626 --> 00:53:13,876
Now that we have graduated

735
00:53:14,001 --> 00:53:16,084
have you thought about
what you want to do in the future?

736
00:53:19,542 --> 00:53:21,709
I want to work in the Hsinchu
Science and Industrial Park

737
00:53:21,834 --> 00:53:24,167
so I can get stocks for
bonuses and tons of money.

738
00:53:24,292 --> 00:53:25,626
And then I can marry Shen Chia-Yi...

739
00:53:25,751 --> 00:53:26,626
or Hu Chia-Wei.

740
00:53:26,751 --> 00:53:28,459
Who wants to marry you?

741
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,792
I want to study abroad.

742
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:37,709
It'll be such a waste of money, okay?

743
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:39,292
Oh, fuck off.

744
00:53:43,709 --> 00:53:44,959
Study abroad?

745
00:53:45,084 --> 00:53:46,667
I want to study abroad, too.

746
00:53:47,042 --> 00:53:50,167
Maybe I will apply for government
scholarships and get an MBA degree

747
00:53:53,751 --> 00:53:57,709
I want to keep on playing basketball.

748
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:01,042
And maybe one day make my way to NBA.

749
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:05,376
What about you, Chia-Wei?

750
00:54:07,876 --> 00:54:09,167
Me?

751
00:54:09,292 --> 00:54:11,376
I think I will find myself
a rich man to marry.

752
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:13,667
Go away.

753
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,459
What about you, Shen Chia-Yi?

754
00:54:18,292 --> 00:54:21,667
I don't expect much about
my future, really.

755
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,417
Ko-Teng, it's your turn

756
00:54:35,251 --> 00:54:37,084
I want to be a kickass person.

757
00:54:39,834 --> 00:54:42,376
What are you talking about?

758
00:54:42,501 --> 00:54:44,376
What is a kickass person?

759
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:52,376
I want the world to be a little
bit better because of me.

760
00:54:59,084 --> 00:55:03,417
And you are the only person
that is going to make my world better.

761
00:55:17,084 --> 00:55:18,584
Hello. Yes?

762
00:55:57,209 --> 00:55:59,042
I am a nerd

763
00:56:00,417 --> 00:56:02,334
I am a bookworm.

764
00:56:05,001 --> 00:56:08,126
Ever since junior high and high school.

765
00:56:08,251 --> 00:56:10,292
All I did was studying

766
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:15,167
I still screwed it up.

767
00:57:12,501 --> 00:57:14,126
No matter which university you go to

768
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:18,501
there is something that
I want to say to you.

769
00:57:20,917 --> 00:57:21,292
Please.

770
00:57:21,417 --> 00:57:23,959
Don't tell me you like me now

771
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:27,751
I do like you

772
00:57:28,126 --> 00:57:29,834
and you knew that already.

773
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:33,626
What do you want to tell me, then?

774
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:22,001
The results were out.

775
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:25,084
A-Ho got into Economics Major
in National Tsing Hua University

776
00:58:25,209 --> 00:58:27,834
which means he made one step forward
to his overseas dream.

777
00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:31,251
Groin got into Information Engineering
at Feng Chia University

778
00:58:31,376 --> 00:58:34,042
to become one of those
Science Park smart engineers.

779
00:58:40,251 --> 00:58:43,501
Tsao got into Chemical Engineering
at Cheng Kung University.

780
00:58:43,626 --> 00:58:47,626
So I guess it's most unlikely
that he would make it into NBA.

781
00:58:48,709 --> 00:58:50,209
Although Shen Chia-Yi didn't
do as well as she expected

782
00:58:50,334 --> 00:58:52,667
she still got into University of Education

783
00:58:52,792 --> 00:58:57,376
I could totally imagine Shen Chia-Yi
being a teacher, it really suits her.

784
00:59:04,334 --> 00:59:05,167
Here, for you.

785
00:59:08,542 --> 00:59:09,626
What is this?

786
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:12,042
I drew it myself.

787
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:13,667
Not my best work

788
00:59:14,709 --> 00:59:16,292
but I think it's okay.

789
00:59:21,834 --> 00:59:22,834
Thanks.

790
00:59:34,959 --> 00:59:38,917
Shen Chia-Yi, promise me something.

791
00:59:39,834 --> 00:59:42,626
Don't let boys get you too
soon after you go to college.

792
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:44,792
Ok?

793
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,251
What are you talking about?

794
01:00:34,459 --> 01:00:36,584
You Are the Apple of My Eye.

795
01:00:44,751 --> 01:00:46,876
Oh, yes, as for the masturbating Boner.

796
01:00:47,084 --> 01:00:49,751
He decided to stay
and take the college entrance exam again.

797
01:00:50,084 --> 01:00:56,251
Take the entrance exam
next year with me please!

798
01:00:59,626 --> 01:01:01,834
I have also come to the
next stage in my life

799
01:01:03,251 --> 01:01:05,542
a school without Shen Chia-Yi

800
01:01:10,126 --> 01:01:14,292
I never thought that Shen Chia-Yi would not
be the first girl that I hold hands with.

801
01:01:14,792 --> 01:01:17,584
Instead of her, it was a girl named...

802
01:01:17,709 --> 01:01:18,584
Named...

803
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:20,501
Hello, my name was Hsu Ke-Shin.

804
01:01:21,126 --> 01:01:23,167
Hi, my name is Ko Ching-Teng.

805
01:01:29,376 --> 01:01:31,626
There were many weird
stories in the dormitory.

806
01:01:31,751 --> 01:01:33,542
Most of them were ghost stories.

807
01:01:33,667 --> 01:01:34,251
But

808
01:01:34,376 --> 01:01:37,251
there's one story about
a four-legged beast.

809
01:01:37,376 --> 01:01:39,167
It was definitely real...

810
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:52,251
My roommates came from all walks of life.

811
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:57,459
Hsiao-Lun was a muscle maniac, who did
nothing but lifted weights all day long.

812
01:02:03,251 --> 01:02:04,417
The ultimate weirdo is Yi-Chi.

813
01:02:04,542 --> 01:02:07,667
He was never in the classroom
because he's always reading Manga.

814
01:02:12,667 --> 01:02:15,709
Chien-Han, who started to prepare for
graduate school from the day he arrived

815
01:02:15,834 --> 01:02:17,834
was studying twenty four seven.

816
01:02:18,709 --> 01:02:21,876
Luckily, we had some common
interests to talk about.

817
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:27,501
See, Iijima Ai is way too old.

818
01:02:27,626 --> 01:02:29,167
Her tits have turned dark.

819
01:02:30,251 --> 01:02:32,376
Emmm... Madoza Ozawa
looks hotter and yummier

820
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:34,126
Anna Ohura is not too bad, either

821
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:39,001
I have some nice stuff
called the Human Sex Program.

822
01:02:39,126 --> 01:02:41,001
Let's watch it together later.

823
01:02:41,417 --> 01:02:44,459
Don't you think it's too weird
to watch cartoon characters having sex?

824
01:02:45,459 --> 01:02:47,959
There're ones with dogs and eels, too.

825
01:02:51,709 --> 01:02:54,334
That was the time before
mobile phones were common.

826
01:02:54,459 --> 01:02:57,834
At night, all the guys acted
like they casted a spell.

827
01:02:57,959 --> 01:03:00,459
Everyone one of us
was lining up in front the telephone booth

828
01:03:02,876 --> 01:03:07,626
I miss you so much my
sweetie little pumpkin pie

829
01:03:09,459 --> 01:03:13,917
I miss you 10 times every
hour on a regular basis.

830
01:03:15,334 --> 01:03:16,876
It's true.

831
01:03:17,876 --> 01:03:20,251
So do you miss me this much, too?

832
01:03:22,792 --> 01:03:25,251
How many times per hour?

833
01:03:27,251 --> 01:03:29,584
10 times at least?

834
01:03:34,751 --> 01:03:35,959
Hey.

835
01:03:36,084 --> 01:03:38,376
You are not asleep yet, are you?

836
01:03:39,459 --> 01:03:40,167
No, not yet.

837
01:03:40,292 --> 01:03:41,251
Go to sleep

838
01:03:41,376 --> 01:03:44,001
I talked to Shen Chia-Yi every night.

839
01:03:44,626 --> 01:03:46,792
Sometimes, she fell asleep in
the middle of our conversations.

840
01:03:46,917 --> 01:03:49,792
Sometimes I spent all my money on phone
calls and left no money for food.

841
01:03:49,917 --> 01:03:52,126
Welcome party? Next week.

842
01:03:52,251 --> 01:03:53,501
Next week.

843
01:03:54,126 --> 01:03:56,667
Listen.

844
01:03:57,167 --> 01:04:00,209
Can you please not dance with anyone?

845
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:03,042
Why not?

846
01:04:03,709 --> 01:04:05,251
Because...

847
01:04:05,376 --> 01:04:08,876
Ok, I know we are not
seeing each other yet.

848
01:04:09,001 --> 01:04:12,042
But those guys who you don't even know.

849
01:04:12,167 --> 01:04:13,751
Can you not let them hold your hands?

850
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,167
I haven't even held them myself.

851
01:04:16,709 --> 01:04:17,709
What about you?

852
01:04:17,834 --> 01:04:19,042
You didn't dance with anyone?

853
01:04:19,542 --> 01:04:22,001
I don't believe you didn't
hold any girl's hands.

854
01:04:23,376 --> 01:04:26,209
Oh, well... yeah, but only a little bit.

855
01:04:27,209 --> 01:04:28,709
That's because...

856
01:04:29,209 --> 01:04:31,376
I imagined that she was you.

857
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:33,667
Oh please, I don't believe you.

858
01:04:33,792 --> 01:04:34,376
Really.

859
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:36,334
Then I can also imagine the
guy I dance with was you.

860
01:04:36,626 --> 01:04:37,501
No man, I'm for real.

861
01:04:37,626 --> 01:04:39,376
All right, I am serious.

862
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:41,167
Don't let anyone hold your hands.

863
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:43,834
Bye.

864
01:04:48,626 --> 01:04:52,292
Finally, it was the first Christmas
after we entered college.

865
01:04:59,167 --> 01:05:00,292
Hey.

866
01:05:02,001 --> 01:05:03,834
Is this considered a date?

867
01:05:05,042 --> 01:05:06,376
Why ask me?

868
01:05:11,376 --> 01:05:12,459
Why is it so cold in Taipei?

869
01:05:35,542 --> 01:05:36,667
Hurry up, my turn for a picture!

870
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:38,667
Hurry up! It's leaving.

871
01:05:56,542 --> 01:05:57,584
Oops, I didn't get it.

872
01:06:00,084 --> 01:06:00,751
You.

873
01:06:05,084 --> 01:06:06,251
Come back.

874
01:06:24,251 --> 01:06:25,709
Ko Ching-Teng.

875
01:06:26,751 --> 01:06:28,501
Do you really like me a lot?

876
01:06:29,167 --> 01:06:30,084
Yes, I do.

877
01:06:31,376 --> 01:06:32,751
Very much

878
01:06:34,917 --> 01:06:38,876
I always feel that you
give me too much credit

879
01:06:39,584 --> 01:06:41,584
I'm not as good as you think

880
01:06:42,376 --> 01:06:48,001
I feel weird about the
fact that you like me.

881
01:06:49,709 --> 01:06:51,334
What's so weird about it?

882
01:06:52,876 --> 01:06:55,917
There is another side of me
that you don't know about

883
01:06:56,042 --> 01:06:59,501
I am very sloppy at home.

884
01:06:59,626 --> 01:07:00,876
Emm...

885
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:02,876
I get very grumpy when I wake up early.

886
01:07:04,417 --> 01:07:08,167
And I get pissed off with my little
sister at times just for minor stuff

887
01:07:09,209 --> 01:07:10,626
I am... you know.

888
01:07:10,751 --> 01:07:12,376
Very ordinary.

889
01:07:19,792 --> 01:07:22,626
Maybe, the person that you like

890
01:07:23,042 --> 01:07:25,001
is in your imagination

891
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,834
I am not that imaginative.

892
01:07:31,459 --> 01:07:32,626
Look.

893
01:07:33,126 --> 01:07:34,751
Think carefully.

894
01:07:35,334 --> 01:07:36,876
Do you like me that much?

895
01:07:37,542 --> 01:07:38,667
Hell yeah.

896
01:07:41,042 --> 01:07:42,709
You are so childish.

897
01:07:42,834 --> 01:07:44,334
You didn't even think through it.

898
01:07:44,459 --> 01:07:45,667
Think about it carefully
before you tell me.

899
01:07:50,334 --> 01:07:52,417
What did Shen Chia-Yi mean?

900
01:07:52,834 --> 01:07:55,001
Was she trying to turn
me down in a nice way?

901
01:07:55,626 --> 01:07:57,001
I was afraid.

902
01:07:57,667 --> 01:08:01,167
For a long time,
I always thought that I am a confident guy.

903
01:08:01,709 --> 01:08:03,501
At that moment, I realized that

904
01:08:03,626 --> 01:08:07,917
I was really a coward in
front of the girl I liked.

905
01:08:37,251 --> 01:08:38,417
What do you wish for?

906
01:08:40,084 --> 01:08:42,292
Write your own, no peeking.

907
01:08:44,251 --> 01:08:45,709
Come on, I just want to have a look.

908
01:08:56,584 --> 01:08:57,417
Shen Chia-Yi

909
01:09:00,209 --> 01:09:01,751
I like you very much

910
01:09:01,876 --> 01:09:03,209
I like you a lot.

911
01:09:04,542 --> 01:09:07,959
One day you will be mine.

912
01:09:08,626 --> 01:09:11,876
One day, I will make you mine.

913
01:09:17,584 --> 01:09:19,251
Do you want to know the answer?

914
01:09:20,876 --> 01:09:22,667
I can tell you right now.

915
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:28,209
No

916
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:31,709
I didn't ask you.

917
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,501
So you can't turn me down.

918
01:09:36,709 --> 01:09:38,167
You really don't want to know?

919
01:09:41,084 --> 01:09:42,709
Please don't tell me now.

920
01:09:45,376 --> 01:09:48,917
Just let me keep on liking you.

921
01:10:06,751 --> 01:10:09,126
Every guy wants to show his strongest side.

922
01:10:09,251 --> 01:10:11,001
Especially in front of the girl he likes.

923
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:14,376
So what should I show to Shen Chia-Yi?

924
01:10:14,834 --> 01:10:19,042
It took me a long time
before the answer suddenly hit me one day.

925
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:34,376
Why can't you just go pee in the toilet?

926
01:10:35,126 --> 01:10:36,251
Man, it's far.

927
01:10:39,334 --> 01:10:41,334
Hey, are you going out?

928
01:10:41,959 --> 01:10:43,667
Empty this for me on
your way out, will you?

929
01:10:46,251 --> 01:10:47,292
You fucking serious?

930
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:50,626
Come on, just do me a favor...

931
01:10:52,001 --> 01:10:53,167
Don't you guys think.

932
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:54,876
It's time to battle?

933
01:10:57,126 --> 01:10:58,334
Come on.

934
01:10:58,459 --> 01:10:59,459
Let's fight

935
01:11:02,417 --> 01:11:02,876
I am organizing a competition.

936
01:11:03,001 --> 01:11:04,209
Anyone wants to join me?

937
01:11:05,834 --> 01:11:07,126
Anyone wants to join the competition?

938
01:11:09,209 --> 01:11:09,751
Anyone wants to fight?

939
01:11:09,876 --> 01:11:11,626
Fighting competition, anyone?

940
01:11:12,417 --> 01:11:13,667
Do you want to fight in a competition?

941
01:11:13,792 --> 01:11:15,042
Do you want to fight in
a combat tournament?

942
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:16,334
Anyone wants to fight?

943
01:11:16,459 --> 01:11:17,334
Anyone wants to join?

944
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:22,501
Can I stay until you guys finish?

945
01:11:22,626 --> 01:11:23,834
What's the big deal with
the regular sports?

946
01:11:23,959 --> 01:11:26,042
Combat is definitely cooler.

947
01:11:27,084 --> 01:11:28,584
Seriously, you have to be here

948
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:29,709
I just put out posters.

949
01:11:29,834 --> 01:11:31,584
It's going to be a full house.

950
01:11:32,292 --> 01:11:34,459
Why do you want to organize
such a dangerous competition?

951
01:11:34,584 --> 01:11:36,376
Don't you guys need to study
and look after your marks?

952
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:37,667
Exactly! People study way too hard.

953
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:39,667
That's why they need to exercise

954
01:11:39,792 --> 01:11:40,959
I want to give them some trainings.

955
01:11:41,792 --> 01:11:43,167
It's just a fight.

956
01:11:43,876 --> 01:11:47,251
Fine, if you really want to put it that way

957
01:11:49,376 --> 01:11:52,292
I really don't get you sometimes.

958
01:12:11,959 --> 01:12:13,709
You can nail this easily

959
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:18,584
I thought everyone in college was a pussy

960
01:12:19,042 --> 01:12:20,292
I was wrong.

961
01:12:20,792 --> 01:12:22,126
There was a tough guy named Chien-Wei.

962
01:12:22,251 --> 01:12:25,667
He was the second chair of the
taekwondo club, a black belt.

963
01:12:25,792 --> 01:12:27,084
He looked cocky.

964
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:29,459
And he looked tough.

965
01:12:30,251 --> 01:12:31,792
Just the kind of guy
that I was looking for.

966
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:36,792
We follow the rules of the highest
martial arts order in the world.

967
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:38,751
No killing.

968
01:12:38,876 --> 01:12:40,334
You cannot go outside of the boundaries.

969
01:12:40,459 --> 01:12:42,376
No kicking on penises.

970
01:12:43,126 --> 01:12:46,542
You lose if you are knocked down and unable
to get up after the referee counts to 10.

971
01:12:47,334 --> 01:12:48,876
Ready!

972
01:12:49,792 --> 01:12:51,126
Put it on.

973
01:12:51,251 --> 01:12:52,376
What the hell?

974
01:12:52,834 --> 01:12:55,001
Wear it so I know I won't kill you.

975
01:12:56,167 --> 01:12:57,876
Go fuck yourself.

976
01:13:17,251 --> 01:13:18,334
Go

977
01:13:31,167 --> 01:13:32,709
I am going to kill you.

978
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,292
Punch him with Gazelle punch.

979
01:14:04,959 --> 01:14:06,417
Stand up.

980
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:07,334
Ko-Teng.

981
01:14:07,459 --> 01:14:08,167
Hurry up.

982
01:14:08,292 --> 01:14:11,626
Fight back.

983
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:14,292
Ko-Teng, fight back.

984
01:14:14,417 --> 01:14:15,876
Beat him up.

985
01:14:22,001 --> 01:14:24,917
Stand up and beat him, stand up.

986
01:14:39,584 --> 01:14:50,001
One... Two... Three... Four...
Five... Six... Seven.

987
01:14:50,126 --> 01:14:53,084
Ko-Teng stand up.

988
01:14:53,209 --> 01:14:54,084
Stand up now.

989
01:14:54,209 --> 01:14:55,876
Time is running out.

990
01:14:56,001 --> 01:14:57,417
Ko-Teng.

991
01:14:57,542 --> 01:14:59,042
Fight back.

992
01:15:17,292 --> 01:15:18,501
Who is that? She's so hot.

993
01:15:23,376 --> 01:15:25,209
Hey! I didn't see you
when the game was over

994
01:15:25,334 --> 01:15:26,376
I thought I was knocked out...

995
01:15:26,709 --> 01:15:27,959
Did you see that guy?

996
01:15:28,084 --> 01:15:29,209
He kicked my ass so bad

997
01:15:29,334 --> 01:15:29,917
I couldn't get away from him.

998
01:15:30,042 --> 01:15:31,126
Was it fun?

999
01:15:31,501 --> 01:15:32,542
Not bad!

1000
01:15:32,667 --> 01:15:34,251
I was so excited when I saw you!

1001
01:15:34,376 --> 01:15:37,001
Answer my question, was it fun?

1002
01:15:38,459 --> 01:15:39,667
Now what?

1003
01:15:40,126 --> 01:15:41,959
Why did you insist on organizing
such a weird competition?

1004
01:15:42,459 --> 01:15:44,542
What's the meaning of it?

1005
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:46,709
Don't you think it's super cool?

1006
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,542
That kind of...
win or lose between two men.

1007
01:15:48,667 --> 01:15:50,251
It's just violence.

1008
01:15:50,376 --> 01:15:51,334
Ko Ching-Teng.

1009
01:15:51,459 --> 01:15:53,876
You organized a game to get yourself hurt.

1010
01:15:54,001 --> 01:15:55,376
Why are you so childish?

1011
01:15:56,834 --> 01:15:57,667
Childish?

1012
01:15:58,042 --> 01:15:59,667
Right, childish.

1013
01:15:59,792 --> 01:16:01,126
Very childish.

1014
01:16:01,251 --> 01:16:02,084
Let me ask you something.

1015
01:16:02,209 --> 01:16:04,834
What exactly did you learn from this game?

1016
01:16:05,709 --> 01:16:07,001
"Learn"?

1017
01:16:07,126 --> 01:16:09,501
Why do I have to learn something
from everything that I do?

1018
01:16:10,042 --> 01:16:12,709
At least you learned that having a competition
like this will get yourself hurt.

1019
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,001
And it is totally unnecessary.

1020
01:16:15,376 --> 01:16:16,542
You are so childish.

1021
01:16:16,667 --> 01:16:19,167
See those bruises on your face?
You deserve it

1022
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:20,959
I am childish?

1023
01:16:21,084 --> 01:16:23,501
Do you know this competition
is a fantastic experience for me?

1024
01:16:23,626 --> 01:16:25,626
Can't you just be happy for me?

1025
01:16:26,792 --> 01:16:28,209
So you are going to do it again?

1026
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:29,292
Of course I will do it again.

1027
01:16:29,417 --> 01:16:30,459
Why not?

1028
01:16:31,417 --> 01:16:32,251
Grow up will you?

1029
01:16:33,834 --> 01:16:36,084
Why do you always look down on things
that matter to me?

1030
01:16:36,209 --> 01:16:39,709
Things that matter to you
are things that hurt you?

1031
01:16:42,459 --> 01:16:43,167
Fine

1032
01:16:43,292 --> 01:16:43,917
I am childish.

1033
01:16:44,042 --> 01:16:46,126
And that's why I would go after
such a good school girl like you

1034
01:16:46,251 --> 01:16:48,459
I am this naive so I could
chase you for so long.

1035
01:16:55,209 --> 01:16:57,459
Stop trying then.

1036
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:11,501
Idiot.

1037
01:17:11,876 --> 01:17:14,126
Right! I am an idiot.

1038
01:17:15,542 --> 01:17:16,584
Moron.

1039
01:17:17,209 --> 01:17:19,126
Only a moron can keep on trying to chase
after you for such a long time.

1040
01:17:20,917 --> 01:17:22,459
You don't understand anything.

1041
01:17:22,917 --> 01:17:24,667
No, I don't understand anything.

1042
01:17:31,917 --> 01:17:35,417
The cruelest part in “growing up”

1043
01:17:36,126 --> 01:17:38,792
is that girls are always more
mature than guys of the same age.

1044
01:17:39,959 --> 01:17:44,251
No guys can handle girls at their age.

1045
01:17:46,876 --> 01:17:48,126
What? A big fight?

1046
01:17:48,251 --> 01:17:50,501
Does that mean you are not going
to be a couple after this?

1047
01:17:50,626 --> 01:17:52,376
What's your problem?

1048
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,667
For real? Not plans of making up?

1049
01:17:54,792 --> 01:17:56,792
Oh yes, so I have a chance now?

1050
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:58,501
Tsao took off right away on his motorcycle

1051
01:17:58,626 --> 01:18:01,709
and rode from Tainan to Taipei.

1052
01:18:01,834 --> 01:18:03,876
He was ready to confess
his love to Shen Chia-Yi.

1053
01:18:05,001 --> 01:18:08,042
A-Ho, on the other hand, bought
a ticket for the next train.

1054
01:18:17,542 --> 01:18:18,876
It turned out that

1055
01:18:19,417 --> 01:18:21,042
the train is faster

1056
01:18:23,292 --> 01:18:25,334
I know we have always been good friends.

1057
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:33,751
But somehow I always knew
that Ko-Teng is the one.

1058
01:18:37,501 --> 01:18:39,376
Being childish is something that

1059
01:18:40,084 --> 01:18:42,167
I can never learn.

1060
01:18:43,834 --> 01:18:49,376
Even though you said you
hate childish guys.

1061
01:18:50,251 --> 01:18:52,542
Every time when you called Ko-Teng childish

1062
01:18:52,667 --> 01:18:54,334
I can tell how much you like
that childishness in him.

1063
01:18:57,209 --> 01:18:59,209
Why are you telling me this now?

1064
01:19:01,251 --> 01:19:02,667
If I don't do anything now

1065
01:19:04,001 --> 01:19:05,542
you guys will get back together eventually.

1066
01:19:05,667 --> 01:19:06,834
Right?

1067
01:19:13,959 --> 01:19:15,167
I am sorry.

1068
01:19:16,667 --> 01:19:19,001
Since you guys are not in good terms now,
I would like to take my chances.

1069
01:19:51,251 --> 01:19:56,584
When Tsao saw A-Ho and Shen Chia-Yi walked
across the street, he took off again.

1070
01:19:57,792 --> 01:20:02,126
This time, he rode his way
around the whole island.

1071
01:20:06,834 --> 01:20:08,292
When Tsao made it to Tainan

1072
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:11,876
he took the wrong exit so
he went straight to Chiayi.

1073
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:16,584
Then he thought why not just take
another round around Taiwan.

1074
01:20:17,292 --> 01:20:20,417
This time, he stopped to picked me up.

1075
01:20:24,917 --> 01:20:26,084
What?

1076
01:20:31,876 --> 01:20:33,209
Fuck.

1077
01:20:36,126 --> 01:20:37,126
What do you want?

1078
01:20:37,251 --> 01:20:38,542
Hit me back.

1079
01:20:42,917 --> 01:20:44,709
What's your freaking problem?

1080
01:20:45,917 --> 01:20:47,417
Idiot?

1081
01:21:06,084 --> 01:21:07,209
I was heart broken

1082
01:21:08,792 --> 01:21:10,667
I had lost Shen Chia-Yi.

1083
01:21:12,251 --> 01:21:16,584
There was nothing left in me

1084
01:21:21,584 --> 01:21:24,626
I met quite a lot of girls
after I lost Shen Chia-Yi.

1085
01:21:24,751 --> 01:21:27,542
It's just that they all
happened to be Japanese.

1086
01:21:27,667 --> 01:21:30,334
For that, I felt there was
something missing in my heart.

1087
01:21:31,001 --> 01:21:32,376
Sakuragi Hanamichi was right.

1088
01:21:32,501 --> 01:21:33,876
You can only use one hand, your left hand.

1089
01:21:34,001 --> 01:21:36,501
Because you need your
right hand on the mouse.

1090
01:21:39,751 --> 01:21:42,126
What's the point of us
masturbating all day long?

1091
01:21:42,251 --> 01:21:43,292
Who cares?

1092
01:21:43,417 --> 01:21:44,542
As long as I get to ejaculate, who cares!

1093
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:46,751
I am coming, I am coming, I AM COMING!

1094
01:21:47,209 --> 01:21:49,709
Even though getting a diploma
might not be crucial

1095
01:21:50,167 --> 01:21:52,084
but a bachelor degree
seems to be not enough

1096
01:21:52,334 --> 01:21:55,709
I admit that I might be childish,
just like how Shen Chia-Yi described me.

1097
01:21:56,126 --> 01:21:57,626
A-Ho has been a really good friend of mine.

1098
01:21:57,751 --> 01:22:01,209
But I just couldn't bring
myself to congratulate him.

1099
01:22:05,834 --> 01:22:07,584
It'd be nice to plan things ahead.

1100
01:22:07,709 --> 01:22:10,334
We should start thinking
about graduate schools.

1101
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:12,876
If you really want to be a teacher.

1102
01:22:13,001 --> 01:22:15,542
Then getting a Master of
education would be nice.

1103
01:22:16,459 --> 01:22:20,626
At least people will pay
you more in the future.

1104
01:23:10,626 --> 01:23:13,959
A-Ho was with Shen Chia-Yi
for only five months.

1105
01:23:14,417 --> 01:23:17,834
But that was more than enough
to make me jealous like hell.

1106
01:24:39,501 --> 01:24:40,501
Fuck, what's happening?

1107
01:24:40,626 --> 01:24:41,834
Shit.

1108
01:24:41,959 --> 01:24:46,042
Fuck, what's going on!

1109
01:24:46,167 --> 01:24:51,042
Ghost! Ghost!
Let's get the hell out of here!

1110
01:24:53,501 --> 01:24:56,334
Shit... ghost? Where? Where?

1111
01:24:57,667 --> 01:24:58,834
This is crazy, man!

1112
01:24:59,959 --> 01:25:02,501
My mom just called and said that the
hotel next to my house just collapsed.

1113
01:25:02,626 --> 01:25:03,792
You are from Taipei, aren't you?

1114
01:25:03,917 --> 01:25:05,667
So the epicenter is in Taipei?

1115
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:08,501
It's too crowded here, the
system is probably overloaded.

1116
01:25:08,626 --> 01:25:11,292
Try to give it a shot at
somewhere less crowded.

1117
01:25:11,417 --> 01:25:12,792
Are you sure?

1118
01:25:12,917 --> 01:25:14,334
I don't know.

1119
01:26:42,834 --> 01:26:44,042
Hello.

1120
01:26:44,417 --> 01:26:45,334
Ko-Teng?

1121
01:26:46,376 --> 01:26:47,251
I am safe, don't worry.

1122
01:26:47,376 --> 01:26:49,042
Everyone is out on the street, though.

1123
01:26:49,167 --> 01:26:50,167
Thank god

1124
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:51,709
I heard that the epicenter is in Taipei.

1125
01:26:51,834 --> 01:26:53,834
And the whole building collapsed

1126
01:26:56,042 --> 01:26:57,501
anyway.

1127
01:26:57,876 --> 01:26:59,626
Good to hear that you are safe.

1128
01:27:01,334 --> 01:27:02,667
Thank you.

1129
01:27:10,376 --> 01:27:11,751
Alright then

1130
01:27:12,959 --> 01:27:14,917
better go.

1131
01:27:15,042 --> 01:27:16,292
Wait a minute

1132
01:27:16,417 --> 01:27:17,251
I am touched, really.

1133
01:27:17,626 --> 01:27:19,292
Yeah right.

1134
01:27:19,417 --> 01:27:21,709
You are the girl that I chased for years!

1135
01:27:21,834 --> 01:27:23,209
Who else is going to share
this memory with me

1136
01:27:23,334 --> 01:27:25,626
if you are gone.

1137
01:27:26,209 --> 01:27:27,459
Hey, come on.

1138
01:27:27,584 --> 01:27:29,292
You didn't even try to contact
me in the past two years.

1139
01:27:29,751 --> 01:27:31,209
You didn't call either.

1140
01:27:31,334 --> 01:27:32,459
How dare you mention it.

1141
01:27:34,126 --> 01:27:36,292
So, what have you been doing lately?

1142
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:37,751
Nothing much, really.

1143
01:27:37,876 --> 01:27:39,542
Same old thing, studying.

1144
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:41,292
What about you?

1145
01:27:41,417 --> 01:27:43,001
Still skipping classes?

1146
01:27:43,126 --> 01:27:44,376
Of course

1147
01:27:44,501 --> 01:27:46,167
I never liked studying anyway

1148
01:27:46,292 --> 01:27:48,001
I only studied because of you.

1149
01:27:48,626 --> 01:27:50,709
Wow! So sweet.

1150
01:27:51,292 --> 01:27:54,167
We had a long chat that night,
talking about the old days.

1151
01:27:55,126 --> 01:27:58,959
The old days when I tried
everything to get closer to her.

1152
01:27:59,459 --> 01:28:01,626
So, do you have a boyfriend now?

1153
01:28:02,126 --> 01:28:03,542
It's none of your business.

1154
01:28:07,709 --> 01:28:09,209
I...um...

1155
01:28:09,709 --> 01:28:11,792
I... was with A-Ho for a while

1156
01:28:12,334 --> 01:28:13,084
I know

1157
01:28:13,209 --> 01:28:14,334
I heard.

1158
01:28:14,459 --> 01:28:15,917
Why did you guys split up?

1159
01:28:16,334 --> 01:28:19,042
I didn't want to ask him cause that
just made me want to kick his ass.

1160
01:28:19,626 --> 01:28:21,042
Was he mean to you?

1161
01:28:21,709 --> 01:28:23,126
Not really

1162
01:28:24,251 --> 01:28:28,292
I just felt that he
didn't like me that much.

1163
01:28:29,042 --> 01:28:31,584
No, A-Ho was crazy about
you, head over heels!

1164
01:28:33,959 --> 01:28:39,917
Having being loved by you makes it
harder for me to feel other's love.

1165
01:28:40,501 --> 01:28:42,584
You are kidding me right?

1166
01:28:43,001 --> 01:28:45,709
Don't ruin it now.

1167
01:28:48,959 --> 01:28:50,626
Hey, Shen Chia-Yi.

1168
01:28:52,501 --> 01:28:53,917
Can I ask you a question?

1169
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:57,376
Why didn't you want to
be with me at that time?

1170
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:00,709
You know...

1171
01:29:01,459 --> 01:29:03,501
People always say that the most
wonderful time of a relationship

1172
01:29:03,626 --> 01:29:05,417
happens before it really happens.

1173
01:29:06,501 --> 01:29:08,292
When two people are together.

1174
01:29:08,959 --> 01:29:12,001
The magic vanishes easily.

1175
01:29:12,959 --> 01:29:16,917
So I thought it'd be better
if I let you chase me longer.

1176
01:29:17,042 --> 01:29:21,376
Otherwise, if we got together
right away, it'd be less fun.

1177
01:29:21,709 --> 01:29:23,209
Man, that's slack!

1178
01:29:30,459 --> 01:29:31,834
Shen Chia-Yi.

1179
01:29:32,751 --> 01:29:35,667
Do you believe in parallel universe?

1180
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:45,376
Maybe in that universe, we are together.

1181
01:29:47,126 --> 01:29:48,834
How I envy them.

1182
01:29:54,084 --> 01:29:56,626
Thank you for liking me.

1183
01:30:01,751 --> 01:30:03,334
Yes.

1184
01:30:04,001 --> 01:30:05,792
Thank you for letting me
like you in those years.

1185
01:30:07,334 --> 01:30:11,084
You are always the apple of my eye.

1186
01:30:19,876 --> 01:30:20,792
Then it came to Senior year.

1187
01:30:20,917 --> 01:30:24,167
Everyone around me was
preparing for grad schools

1188
01:30:24,292 --> 01:30:26,667
I had no idea what I
wanted to do at that time.

1189
01:30:26,792 --> 01:30:29,959
Everyone was studying so
hard and it made me nervous.

1190
01:30:30,084 --> 01:30:32,626
So I decided to join them in the library.

1191
01:30:34,792 --> 01:30:38,917
And out of the blue, I started
to write stories on my blog.

1192
01:31:16,792 --> 01:31:19,667
Tsao didn't make his way to NBA.

1193
01:31:19,792 --> 01:31:21,792
He ended up selling second hand cars.

1194
01:31:22,501 --> 01:31:23,834
And it turned out he's pretty good at it.

1195
01:31:23,959 --> 01:31:26,001
On average, he sells one
car every other day.

1196
01:31:26,126 --> 01:31:26,792
Unbelievable.

1197
01:31:26,917 --> 01:31:28,626
The engine never lies.

1198
01:31:28,751 --> 01:31:29,334
Here.

1199
01:31:29,459 --> 01:31:31,584
Put your foot on the gas gently.

1200
01:31:38,251 --> 01:31:40,251
Hear that sound?

1201
01:31:40,376 --> 01:31:43,917
It's this powerful before we upgrade it,
can you imagine if we do?

1202
01:31:44,042 --> 01:31:47,084
I bet it is going to run over
2000 rpm when it hits the road.

1203
01:31:47,209 --> 01:31:50,209
The horsepower is beyond your imagination.

1204
01:31:50,667 --> 01:31:51,834
What do you think? You like it?

1205
01:31:51,959 --> 01:31:52,626
I like it.

1206
01:31:52,751 --> 01:31:55,084
Well then, how about we take
this beast out for a ride?

1207
01:31:55,209 --> 01:31:55,709
Okay.

1208
01:31:56,251 --> 01:31:57,209
GO

1209
01:31:58,876 --> 01:32:00,917
Groin passed the government worker's exam.

1210
01:32:01,042 --> 01:32:03,917
He is now working as a librarian.

1211
01:32:04,042 --> 01:32:06,709
Which he gets to play perform magic
to young innocent girls every day.

1212
01:32:08,542 --> 01:32:12,542
See this book? Blow on it.

1213
01:32:19,542 --> 01:32:20,834
Now, pay attention.

1214
01:32:24,501 --> 01:32:26,209
Are you nuts?

1215
01:32:26,667 --> 01:32:27,834
Stop there.

1216
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:31,042
A-Ho became an insurance sales man.

1217
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:32,584
He loves driving his car.

1218
01:32:32,709 --> 01:32:37,376
Every day he spends about 12 hours in it,
even though it's tough

1219
01:32:37,501 --> 01:32:39,251
I do believe he will succeed one day.

1220
01:32:39,376 --> 01:32:43,334
After all he is the only person
who has officially dated Shen Chia-Yi.

1221
01:32:49,042 --> 01:32:50,501
Hello, is this Mr. Lee?

1222
01:32:50,626 --> 01:32:52,626
Yes, speaking.

1223
01:32:52,751 --> 01:32:55,542
Hi, remember the insurance plan
that I talked to you about last time?

1224
01:32:55,667 --> 01:32:57,292
I have already gathered all
the information for you.

1225
01:32:57,417 --> 01:33:01,126
Just wondering when is a good time
to pay you a visit in your office.

1226
01:33:03,209 --> 01:33:08,709
Boner flew to America for graduate school
immediately after his military service.

1227
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:10,626
Boner's English sucked

1228
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:14,292
I don't know how the hell
he had the guts to go to the States.

1229
01:33:14,417 --> 01:33:17,709
Perhaps he wanted to masturbate
in a different country.

1230
01:33:17,834 --> 01:33:21,167
If you can't stand it, just
come back, understand?

1231
01:33:21,292 --> 01:33:23,417
Ma, stop talking nonsense

1232
01:33:23,542 --> 01:33:25,167
I am serious.

1233
01:33:25,292 --> 01:33:26,959
If it's too hard, then just come back

1234
01:33:27,084 --> 01:33:29,042
I will not blame you, I promise.

1235
01:33:33,126 --> 01:33:35,042
Fine, I got it.

1236
01:33:40,667 --> 01:33:43,126
Okay, it's dad's turn to say good-bye now.

1237
01:33:48,167 --> 01:33:51,917
Two years gone by while Boner was overseas.

1238
01:33:54,084 --> 01:33:56,126
Oh, yes, and there is Hu Chia-Wei.

1239
01:34:02,626 --> 01:34:05,042
That girl who always drew
retarded stuff in her books.

1240
01:34:05,167 --> 01:34:07,667
She now has another name.

1241
01:34:07,792 --> 01:34:09,251
Wan Wan.

1242
01:34:13,917 --> 01:34:16,501
So it proves that those
who realize their dreams

1243
01:34:16,626 --> 01:34:18,542
are often not the most
clever ones in school.

1244
01:34:19,001 --> 01:34:22,834
But they are definitely those
who persist till the end

1245
01:34:25,084 --> 01:34:27,584
I am very glad that I was wrong.

1246
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:35,126
When Boner came home with a foreign degree

1247
01:34:35,251 --> 01:34:37,209
I received a phone call.

1248
01:34:41,667 --> 01:34:42,709
Hello.

1249
01:34:42,834 --> 01:34:45,126
Hello, old friend, are you busy?

1250
01:34:45,626 --> 01:34:46,959
Of course I am busy

1251
01:34:47,584 --> 01:34:51,334
I don't care, there is something that
I want you to be the first to know.

1252
01:34:51,876 --> 01:34:52,584
What is it?

1253
01:34:52,709 --> 01:34:55,376
You got time for me to go after you again?

1254
01:34:56,501 --> 01:34:58,626
Not this time, I am afraid.

1255
01:34:58,751 --> 01:34:59,917
Why?

1256
01:35:10,292 --> 01:35:11,084
Hurry up!

1257
01:35:11,209 --> 01:35:12,501
It's a big day today.

1258
01:35:13,251 --> 01:35:15,334
You want to make the bride wait for you?

1259
01:35:22,292 --> 01:35:23,667
Cheers.

1260
01:35:25,417 --> 01:35:26,292
Regret it now?

1261
01:35:26,417 --> 01:35:29,167
I was so available back then,
but you guys all went for Shen Chia-Yi.

1262
01:35:30,001 --> 01:35:31,209
So does that mean I still have a chance?

1263
01:35:31,334 --> 01:35:33,376
You suck!

1264
01:35:34,334 --> 01:35:35,376
I got to tell you something

1265
01:35:35,501 --> 01:35:37,709
I wasn't really serious about chasing
after Shen Chia-Yi before.

1266
01:35:37,834 --> 01:35:39,042
Why?

1267
01:35:39,167 --> 01:35:41,042
I just didn't want to miss out.

1268
01:35:41,167 --> 01:35:43,209
Everyone went after her, so I did, too.

1269
01:35:47,542 --> 01:35:48,501
In comparison to me

1270
01:35:48,626 --> 01:35:50,667
I must say, you guys are shameless.

1271
01:35:50,792 --> 01:35:52,792
She is the bride today, but
none of you is the groom.

1272
01:35:52,917 --> 01:35:55,334
How dare you guys show
your faces at this wedding.

1273
01:35:55,459 --> 01:35:57,084
Shameless!

1274
01:35:57,792 --> 01:35:58,709
Hsu Bo-Chun.

1275
01:35:58,834 --> 01:35:59,876
Kiss my ass.

1276
01:36:00,001 --> 01:36:01,292
Just drink!

1277
01:36:02,167 --> 01:36:04,167
Oh, please, I have dated her, haven't I?

1278
01:36:04,542 --> 01:36:05,834
That was a scam.

1279
01:36:05,959 --> 01:36:07,001
Exactly, cheater!

1280
01:36:07,126 --> 01:36:09,626
Hey, let's make a bet.

1281
01:36:09,751 --> 01:36:10,834
Let's do paper, scissors stone.

1282
01:36:10,959 --> 01:36:12,334
The loser

1283
01:36:12,459 --> 01:36:17,584
will have to trip the groom
when they walk in later.

1284
01:36:17,709 --> 01:36:21,209
What the hell was that? It's embarrassing!

1285
01:36:21,334 --> 01:36:24,876
You guys are mean.
Can't you just show some love to the couple?

1286
01:36:25,126 --> 01:36:26,334
You won't understand.

1287
01:36:26,459 --> 01:36:29,417
If you really like a girl.

1288
01:36:29,542 --> 01:36:33,251
It is impossible to see her marry
to another guy and still bless them.

1289
01:36:33,542 --> 01:36:34,126
That's right.

1290
01:36:34,251 --> 01:36:37,501
True love means someone should sneak up
and stabs the groom in the back.

1291
01:36:37,626 --> 01:36:39,292
Correct.

1292
01:36:39,417 --> 01:36:42,626
Trip him!

1293
01:37:43,334 --> 01:37:44,834
But I am wrong.

1294
01:37:45,376 --> 01:37:49,834
In fact, when you really like a
girl, you'd be happy for her.

1295
01:37:50,626 --> 01:37:53,917
When you see her finding her Mr. Right.

1296
01:37:54,292 --> 01:37:57,042
You will want them to be together.

1297
01:37:57,167 --> 01:38:00,167
And to live happily ever after.

1298
01:38:07,417 --> 01:38:08,834
Come closer.

1299
01:38:10,167 --> 01:38:11,292
One more, ready

1300
01:38:11,709 --> 01:38:13,001
1,2, 3, go.

1301
01:38:13,834 --> 01:38:14,709
OK

1302
01:38:15,626 --> 01:38:19,084
Congratulations, happy marriage.

1303
01:38:19,209 --> 01:38:19,792
Come, quickly

1304
01:38:19,917 --> 01:38:20,876
I want to stand next to Shen Chia-Yi.

1305
01:38:21,001 --> 01:38:22,209
We should take more photos.

1306
01:38:25,126 --> 01:38:25,959
How do I look? Get a pretty one for me.

1307
01:38:26,084 --> 01:38:28,459
All right. Here it comes.

1308
01:38:28,584 --> 01:38:29,667
Ready.

1309
01:38:31,084 --> 01:38:32,626
Ok, one, two, three, go.

1310
01:38:33,917 --> 01:38:35,959
One more, one, two, three... done.

1311
01:38:37,209 --> 01:38:37,626
OK

1312
01:38:37,751 --> 01:38:38,417
Thank you.

1313
01:38:38,542 --> 01:38:41,334
Hey, man, we have a suggestion.

1314
01:38:41,459 --> 01:38:42,376
About what?

1315
01:38:42,501 --> 01:38:44,167
See, the thing is that we
have loaded you with cash.

1316
01:38:44,626 --> 01:38:47,876
Don't you think we have the
right to kiss the bride?

1317
01:38:49,126 --> 01:38:52,167
Well, I am fine if she says fine.

1318
01:38:55,459 --> 01:38:56,126
Well, fine.

1319
01:38:59,334 --> 01:39:01,542
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1320
01:39:01,667 --> 01:39:04,584
You can kiss the bride.

1321
01:39:04,709 --> 01:39:06,501
But you have to kiss me first.

1322
01:39:06,626 --> 01:39:08,542
Kiss me the way you want to
kiss her, so that's fair.

1323
01:39:10,876 --> 01:39:12,459
Bullshit!

1324
01:39:12,584 --> 01:39:13,876
What kind of rule is that?

1325
01:39:14,001 --> 01:39:15,251
Yeah, no way.

1326
01:39:15,376 --> 01:39:16,542
Don't be stingy.

1327
01:39:16,667 --> 01:39:18,667
That is not right.

1328
01:39:20,292 --> 01:39:21,959
Well then... sorry.

1329
01:39:22,084 --> 01:39:24,001
Ha, ha... Look at yourself, guys.

1330
01:40:25,667 --> 01:40:26,876
What?

1331
01:40:28,209 --> 01:40:29,626
Thank you for yesterday.

1332
01:40:30,751 --> 01:40:31,626
Are you for real?

1333
01:40:31,751 --> 01:40:33,334
A quiz made out of love...

1334
01:40:35,667 --> 01:40:37,001
You made so many mistakes.

1335
01:40:37,126 --> 01:40:39,667
You did the problems without reading
the exercise book, didn't you?

1336
01:40:46,167 --> 01:40:47,167
Shen Chia-Yi.

1337
01:40:47,292 --> 01:40:48,709
You were so cool when you shouted at him.

1338
01:40:48,834 --> 01:40:50,417
You look so pretty when you cry, too.

1339
01:41:13,584 --> 01:41:17,042
Even though we are not
seeing each other yet.

1340
01:41:17,167 --> 01:41:20,334
But those guys who you don't even know.

1341
01:41:20,459 --> 01:41:22,334
Can you not let them hold your hands?

1342
01:41:22,917 --> 01:41:24,292
I haven't even held them myself.

1343
01:41:38,251 --> 01:41:40,709
You held this game and got yourself hurt.

1344
01:41:40,834 --> 01:41:42,459
How can you be so childish?

1345
01:41:42,792 --> 01:41:43,959
Childish?

1346
01:41:46,251 --> 01:41:47,251
Yes, childish.

1347
01:41:47,376 --> 01:41:48,584
Very childish and totally immature.

1348
01:42:02,209 --> 01:42:03,459
Idiot.

1349
01:42:03,584 --> 01:42:05,917
Yes, I am an idiot.

1350
01:42:08,959 --> 01:42:10,459
Moron.

1351
01:42:10,584 --> 01:42:12,584
Only a moron can keep on trying
to chase you for such a long time.

1352
01:42:14,417 --> 01:42:16,209
You don't understand anything.

1353
01:42:16,334 --> 01:42:18,209
You're right, I don't!

1354
01:42:58,209 --> 01:42:59,251
Sorry

1355
01:42:59,376 --> 01:43:00,876
I was the immature one.

1356
01:43:18,459 --> 01:43:22,417
Being able to solve these tricky math
questions does not help anything in life!

1357
01:43:22,542 --> 01:43:23,584
You want to bet?

1358
01:43:23,709 --> 01:43:26,542
I won't even know what “log”
means ten years later.

1359
01:43:26,667 --> 01:43:28,292
And it doesn't make my life any harder.

1360
01:43:28,417 --> 01:43:29,542
Emmmm.

1361
01:43:31,001 --> 01:43:32,292
You don't believe me

1362
01:43:32,417 --> 01:43:33,501
I do believe you.

1363
01:43:33,626 --> 01:43:35,584
Then, why do you still work so hard?

1364
01:43:36,626 --> 01:43:39,209
You don't expect returns
from everything you do.

1365
01:43:52,834 --> 01:43:54,542
Do you want to know the answer?

1366
01:43:57,001 --> 01:44:01,626
If Ko Ching-Teng comes
and confesses to me I will be very happy.

1367
01:44:08,667 --> 01:44:11,042
Shen Chia-Yi

1368
01:44:11,167 --> 01:44:14,751
I like you very much.

1369
01:44:15,584 --> 01:44:20,084
(Ok, let's be together)

1370
01:44:21,417 --> 01:44:23,251
How I envy them.

1371
01:44:27,459 --> 01:44:29,459
Thank you for liking me.

1372
01:44:56,209 --> 01:44:58,042
Well then, I am just going
to keep on acting childish.

1373
01:44:59,876 --> 01:45:01,459
Sure, why not!

1374
01:45:08,209 --> 01:45:11,584
(Happy Marriage, to the apple of my eye)

1375
01:45:31,209 --> 01:45:32,584
Hey, Yankees.

1376
01:45:32,959 --> 01:45:34,167
Yeah!

1377
01:45:36,084 --> 01:45:36,917
A- Chian.

1378
01:45:52,584 --> 01:45:53,792
Hey, Ko-Teng.

1379
01:45:54,167 --> 01:45:57,501
Have you thought about writing our story?

1380
01:45:58,876 --> 01:46:00,501
Of course I did!

1381
01:46:01,167 --> 01:46:03,917
I just haven't come up a
good name to start with.

1382
01:46:05,751 --> 01:46:08,251
Hey, can you leave out the part
which I was masturbating?

1383
01:46:10,167 --> 01:46:11,917
Sorry man... that has to be in the story.

1384
01:46:12,834 --> 01:46:14,459
If you really are going to write it.

1385
01:46:15,667 --> 01:46:17,084
Don't forget to let your
readers know how handsome I am.

1386
01:46:18,667 --> 01:46:20,334
By the way, can you put in some
dating advertisements for me, too!

1387
01:46:21,126 --> 01:46:22,667
Come on, I thought you
are going after Wan Wan?

1388
01:46:25,042 --> 01:46:26,126
Haha, doesn't really matter.

1389
01:48:22,251 --> 01:48:25,167
This is the last image
we shot before wrapping up shooting.

1390
01:48:25,292 --> 01:48:27,959
The director conspired
with the make-up artist to prank the cast.

1391
01:48:28,084 --> 01:48:30,959
And painted Michelle Chen's face into...
