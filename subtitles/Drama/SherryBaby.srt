1
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,602
Excuse you.

2
00:02:19,603 --> 00:02:22,383
Hey, excuse me.

3
00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:24,590
Hey, sir, you just
bumped into me.

4
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:28,906
Fuckin' rude motherfucker.

5
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,444
Swanson, 95-G4-620.

6
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:09,321
Dorothy Washington,
house manager.

7
00:04:09,322 --> 00:04:10,857
Come on in.

8
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:18,242
Most everyone's at work,

9
00:04:18,243 --> 00:04:19,583
but this house
fills up real good

10
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:21,501
around 7:00, 8:00 at night.

11
00:04:21,502 --> 00:04:22,652
<i>Your box came yesterday.</i>

12
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:23,995
<i>Show me your release sheet,</i>

13
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:26,202
<i>and then we'll get you a room.</i>

14
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:34,833
<i>Ladies, this here
is Sherry Swanson.</i>

15
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:35,793
Hey.

16
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:36,793
<i>Hi.</i>

17
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,328
You got some privacy,

18
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:46,054
but we don't lock bedroom doors.

19
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:47,493
This is for the locker

20
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:48,548
where you store
all your valuables,

21
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:49,549
in the corner, there.

22
00:04:49,604 --> 00:04:51,233
You get your house keys
after 30 days

23
00:04:51,234 --> 00:04:52,576
with no write-ups:

24
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:54,110
No infractions
of our house rules,

25
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:55,837
do your chores, all that.

26
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,563
I'm sure you'll be fine, honey.

27
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:58,907
Yeah.

28
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:15,403
<i>Get the phone!</i>

29
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:31,898
<i>Do you like the blue ones,
the green ones?</i>

30
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:32,858
<i>The pink ones.</i>

31
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:33,912
<i>What size are you?</i>

32
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:34,872
Bobby?

33
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:36,022
<i>Hello?</i>

34
00:05:36,023 --> 00:05:37,653
Hey, it's Sherry.

35
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:39,571
<i>Sherry, is that you?</i>

36
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:43,503
Yeah, what's up?

37
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:46,860
<i>Listen, I got to wrap it up.</i>

38
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:47,820
Want a cigarette?

39
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:50,984
Yeah, okay, um...

40
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:52,902
that's cool.

41
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:54,629
Tell everybody I said hi.

42
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,875
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

43
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:57,410
Kiss my baby for me.

44
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:59,904
Kiss Lexi for me.
Tell her I'm coming.

45
00:05:59,905 --> 00:06:02,589
What time are you
coming tomorrow?

46
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,699
<i>After lunch.
Listen, I got to run.</i>

47
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,906
Cool, peace.

48
00:06:07,002 --> 00:06:08,535
<i>Blanquita.</i>

49
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:09,878
<i>Blanquita,</i>

50
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,988
you think you're
too good for us?

51
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:13,618
<i>Destiny, chill out.</i>

52
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:15,921
<i>The girl just got her release.</i>

53
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:27,046
<i>Parole office.</i>

54
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:29,156
Could I talk to PO Hernandez?

55
00:06:29,157 --> 00:06:30,690
<i>Who's calling?</i>

56
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:31,841
Swanson.

57
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:32,992
<i>Parole number?</i>

58
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,487
95-G4-620.

59
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:40,569
No crossing state lines without
permission from this office.

60
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,487
Any change in residence

61
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:43,926
must be reported in writing.

62
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:45,207
Do you understand the conditions

63
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:46,899
of your parole, Ms. Swanson?

64
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,338
Mm-hmm.

65
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:53,516
Here's the rest
of your commissary.

66
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:55,051
Count it out in front of me.

67
00:06:55,052 --> 00:06:56,298
Sign the receipt.

68
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:58,217
Make sure it's all there.

69
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,259
On each and every reporting day,

70
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,890
you will submit your pay stubs

71
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,945
along with this form.

72
00:07:13,946 --> 00:07:17,877
Make sure the form
is filled out correctly.

73
00:07:17,878 --> 00:07:19,795
Can I smoke in here?

74
00:07:19,796 --> 00:07:22,673
Get a job as soon as possible.

75
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:24,554
Otherwise, I have to see you
three times a week,

76
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:27,853
and, frankly, I don't have
the time for that right now.

77
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:47,993
Could I ask you
about something now, or...

78
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:53,843
Um, this... this curfew thing?

79
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:55,473
<i>I just, um...</i>

80
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:58,542
<i>I would like to spend the night
at my family's house,</i>

81
00:07:58,543 --> 00:07:59,502
<i>at my brother's house.</i>

82
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:01,995
I haven't seen them
for a long time.

83
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:05,257
I thought you had
no problems, Swanson.

84
00:08:05,353 --> 00:08:06,695
Yeah.

85
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:09,188
Any unreported police contact

86
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,298
will result in the immediate
violation of your parole,

87
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:12,449
and I will violate you.

88
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,984
You will be returned to prison

89
00:08:13,985 --> 00:08:15,518
to serve the remainder
of your sentence,

90
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,436
plus any new charges
you may incur.

91
00:08:17,437 --> 00:08:19,738
Monday at 9:00 a. M. ,
you report to Mr. Monroe

92
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:22,519
at 1138 Clifford Street.

93
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,246
Please give me a pass.

94
00:08:24,247 --> 00:08:26,740
Are you trying to fuck
with me, Swanson?

95
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:31,919
Or are you here to successfully
complete your parole?

96
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,179
To successfully complete
my parole, sir.

97
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,632
<i>I just really...</i>

98
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,647
I have to see my daughter.

99
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:46,881
I haven't seen her
in a long time.

100
00:08:57,623 --> 00:09:00,595
Your brother's name
and address, what is it?

101
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:02,322
Robert Swanson.

102
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:04,432
<i>1334 Ridge Drive.</i>

103
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:06,351
Slow down.

104
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:09,323
One...

105
00:09:09,324 --> 00:09:12,776
334 Ridge Drive.

106
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:17,764
Mountainside, New Jersey.

107
00:09:28,218 --> 00:09:29,943
<i>Come on, there's nothing
to see here.</i>

108
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,286
<i>Come on, keep moving.
Keep moving.</i>

109
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:32,287
Let's go. Let's go.

110
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:41,686
Dump it.

111
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,043
Yo, bitch, why do you...
I told you,

112
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:53,825
I ain't coming
up off that rock for free.

113
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:48,396
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

114
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,451
Good luck tomorrow, okay?

115
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:50,411
<i>Thanks, Andy.</i>

116
00:10:50,412 --> 00:10:52,616
<i>Thanks for helping me out.</i>

117
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:53,576
How do you do?

118
00:10:53,577 --> 00:10:55,973
Hey.

119
00:10:55,974 --> 00:10:57,412
I'm Andy Kelly.

120
00:10:57,413 --> 00:10:58,946
I'm the director
of this program.

121
00:10:58,947 --> 00:10:59,906
Oh, hey, I'm Sherry.

122
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:00,865
I just got here.

123
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:02,207
Nice to meet you...
Sherry Swanson.

124
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,167
Yeah.

125
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:04,413
Right, I processed your intake.

126
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,373
Oh.

127
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:06,907
Welcome to Genesis House.

128
00:11:06,908 --> 00:11:08,249
Thanks.

129
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,935
Is that your Bible?

130
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,565
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, it is.

131
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:14,004
Well, you know what
you should do?

132
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:15,731
Take a look at this one.

133
00:11:15,827 --> 00:11:17,936
What's laid out in the first
164 pages of this book

134
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:19,375
gram for life.

135
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:21,485
It's a program of change
that'll spin your head around

136
00:11:21,486 --> 00:11:23,019
and make you happier
than you ever were

137
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,362
when you were on drugs
and alcohol.

138
00:11:24,363 --> 00:11:25,417
I know all about it.

139
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,431
I did a year of 12-step
when I was locked up.

140
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:28,486
Really?

141
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:32,995
I, um... I like
the Good Book better.

142
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:36,105
Gotcha.

143
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:40,475
Do you want some coffee?

144
00:11:40,476 --> 00:11:41,817
Yeah.

145
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:44,696
<i>Please.</i>

146
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,013
Oh. Oh, stop.

147
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,356
Stop, stop.

148
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:07,329
Damn.

149
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,248
I could go all night.

150
00:12:14,523 --> 00:12:15,674
Look at this.

151
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:21,236
My friend shaved it.

152
00:12:21,237 --> 00:12:23,059
You want to kiss it?

153
00:12:24,018 --> 00:12:25,168
Come on, baby.

154
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:26,128
Come on, kiss it.

155
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:27,183
Okay.

156
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:53,557
You have a visitor.

157
00:12:53,558 --> 00:12:54,613
Okay.

158
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:21,562
Oh, shit.

159
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:23,384
Put some meat on your bones.

160
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:28,659
Yeah.

161
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,769
I missed you.

162
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,168
You should have come see me.

163
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,443
Okay, let's get
the fuck out of here.

164
00:13:42,184 --> 00:13:43,717
It's all pretty much the same.

165
00:13:43,718 --> 00:13:46,882
The only thing different
is we got a new table.

166
00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:52,254
Well, I guess Lynette
redecorated the living room.

167
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,171
We got Alexis a new bed.

168
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:57,240
She didn't want to get rid
of her little baby bed.

169
00:13:57,241 --> 00:14:01,460
But you'll see;
Everything's the same.

170
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:03,379
It'll be like you never left.

171
00:14:10,477 --> 00:14:12,202
<i>Did you hear Chris Cuzar died?</i>

172
00:14:12,203 --> 00:14:15,175
How am I supposed to hear that?

173
00:14:15,176 --> 00:14:17,861
I don't know who you talk to.

174
00:14:17,862 --> 00:14:19,491
Nobody.

175
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:25,054
I don't talk to nobody, Bob.

176
00:14:25,055 --> 00:14:27,451
How'd he die, from the dope?

177
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:28,795
Yep.

178
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:35,699
Shit, do you have a cigarette?

179
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,097
Nope, I quit.

180
00:14:38,098 --> 00:14:39,825
Fuck you.

181
00:14:42,894 --> 00:14:44,523
Look at the little mermaid.

182
00:14:44,524 --> 00:14:45,962
Don't go too far.

183
00:14:45,963 --> 00:14:47,496
Come back here.

184
00:14:47,497 --> 00:14:48,935
Get over here.

185
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:52,388
<i>Munchkin.</i>

00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:53,826
Hey, girls.

187
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:54,977
Hey, hon.

188
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:55,937
<i>Lynnie.</i>

Welcome home.

191
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:06,966
Hi.

192
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:08,789
<i>You're here, wow.</i>

193
00:15:08,885 --> 00:15:10,323
Not going to hug you... I'm wet.

194
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,312
You remember Sherry, Lexi?

195
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:27,298
Mommy?

196
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:28,833
Hi.

197
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:29,888
I'm going to clean the pool.

198
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:30,848
It's dirty.

199
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:31,807
Hey, baby.

200
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:33,245
Oh, you want to hug me?

201
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:35,738
Yeah?

202
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:37,465
Oh, baby.

203
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:40,054
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

204
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:45,521
Oh, Lexi, I'm so sorry.

205
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:47,632
I'm so sorry, baby.

206
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:55,592
I missed you so much.

207
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:11,801
Where were you?

208
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:17,842
<i>Mommy, Mommy,</i>

209
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:18,802
Mommy, Mommy.

210
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:21,200
Damn, girl, you got heavy.

211
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:23,980
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

212
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:27,338
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

213
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:30,790
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

217
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:39,517
Don't jump on the couch,
sweetie.

218
00:16:39,518 --> 00:16:40,477
Sit down, baby.

219
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:41,820
Let me put on your robe.

220
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:43,930
Arm.

221
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:46,423
You want to see
your presents, baby?

222
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:47,766
What are you doing, silly goose?

223
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:49,875
<i>Okay, look at this one.</i>

224
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,849
Look at that.

225
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,383
I picked that for you.

226
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:56,302
Eeee.

227
00:16:57,261 --> 00:16:58,411
I like that.

228
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:00,138
I think that's cute.

229
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:02,152
Okay, look at that.

230
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:04,455
I already got that stuff.

231
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,700
You do?

232
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:07,235
Okay, whatever.

233
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,674
<i>A Barbie.</i>

234
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:10,496
Yeah, you like Barbie?

235
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:11,743
She's so pretty.

236
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:13,086
You do?

237
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:17,785
Oh, can I kiss her too?

238
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,183
Smooch!

239
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:22,964
<i>Okay, now this present
is the most special one,</i>

240
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:25,170
that's behind my back.

241
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:27,855
This one is from my best friend.

242
00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:29,486
<i>She made it.</i>

243
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:31,692
<i>She made it all
by herself for you.</i>

244
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:34,377
Red, red, red.

245
00:17:34,378 --> 00:17:37,350
Ohh.

246
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:38,310
I like it.

247
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:39,556
You like it?

248
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:41,282
Uh-huh.

249
00:17:41,283 --> 00:17:42,338
You do?

250
00:17:42,434 --> 00:17:43,680
Uh-huh.

251
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:45,598
Oh, I love you, Lexi.

252
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,667
You want Mommy to tell you
the story now

253
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:51,257
of what happened to me?

254
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:52,217
Mm-hmm.

255
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:53,271
Yeah?

256
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:58,450
Look, honey, come here.

257
00:17:58,451 --> 00:18:00,560
I want to tell you
the truth, okay?

258
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:01,520
Okay?

259
00:18:01,521 --> 00:18:05,164
And sometimes it's not easy

260
00:18:05,165 --> 00:18:07,178
to tell the truth;
You know what I mean?

261
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:08,904
Mm-hmm.

262
00:18:08,905 --> 00:18:12,740
I did a bad thing,
and they sent me to jail.

263
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:14,563
<i>Do you know what that is?</i>

264
00:18:14,564 --> 00:18:21,085
<i>What bad thing?</i>

265
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:27,990
I stole from people
to get money for drugs.

266
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:29,429
Mm-hmm.

267
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,484
Oh, baby, come here.

268
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:36,909
Oh, honey, I missed you
so, so, so, so much.

269
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,074
I used to talk to you.

270
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:41,417
Did you hear me?

271
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:43,143
Mm-mm.

272
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:45,638
No?

273
00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:55,612
Lord, please, please, please,

274
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:57,817
please, please
hear my extra prayer tonight.

275
00:18:57,818 --> 00:19:00,120
Y weaknesses and my mistakes.

276
00:19:00,216 --> 00:19:02,037
Give me the strength
to take life one day at a time

277
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:03,957
and take care
of my daughter again, amen.

278
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,905
Three years in Clinton, huh?

279
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:28,412
Well, there's the Del Monte
plant in Irvington,

280
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:30,618
just started hiring new people.

281
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:32,920
Actually, I would like
to work with kids.

282
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,167
Kids?

283
00:19:34,168 --> 00:19:38,196
Yes, I graduated the Parenting
From the Inside program,

284
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:41,456
and I worked 13 months

285
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:45,676
<i>in the family trailers
and 6 in the children's center.</i>

286
00:19:45,677 --> 00:19:50,855
So I'd like to work
in a Head Start

287
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,581
or a day care
or something like that.

288
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:53,541
Uh-huh.

289
00:19:53,542 --> 00:20:00,351
<i>Also, I have a child.</i>

290
00:20:02,844 --> 00:20:04,474
Swanson, you're a young,
pretty girl.

291
00:20:04,475 --> 00:20:05,434
If you don't want to work

292
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:06,776
<i>in the factory,</i>

293
00:20:06,777 --> 00:20:10,420
<i>you know, maybe you could
wait tables, cocktail...</i>

294
00:20:10,421 --> 00:20:11,380
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no,</i>

295
00:20:11,381 --> 00:20:14,928
not... not with...

296
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:17,998
<i>Hmm.</i>

297
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:21,163
Wait, I, um...

298
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:27,301
I have some papers.

299
00:20:33,535 --> 00:20:35,932
This is from
the parenting program.

300
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:38,042
Okay.

301
00:20:38,043 --> 00:20:40,440
This one is from
the children's center.

302
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:41,495
Okay.

303
00:20:41,496 --> 00:20:42,645
And...

304
00:20:42,646 --> 00:20:45,620
And... and what?

305
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:01,827
Nice.

306
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:05,569
I'll suck your dick
if you give me the job I want.

307
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:26,285
The fuck you looking at?

308
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,083
God, grant me the serenity

309
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:57,742
to accept things
I cannot change,

310
00:21:57,743 --> 00:21:59,660
and the wisdom to know
the difference.

311
00:21:59,661 --> 00:22:02,633
Tonight Dean will be reading
the preamble.

312
00:22:02,634 --> 00:22:03,880
My name's Dean.

313
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:05,702
I'm an alcoholic and an addict.

314
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:07,045
<i>Hi, Dean.</i>

315
00:22:07,046 --> 00:22:08,196
Genesis Recovery

316
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:09,922
<i>is a fellowship of men and women</i>

317
00:22:09,923 --> 00:22:11,649
o share their experience,

318
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,010
strength, and hope
with each other,

319
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:15,197
that they may solve
their common problem

320
00:22:15,198 --> 00:22:17,979
<i>and help others to recover</i>

321
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,417
from alcoholism
and drug addiction.

322
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:20,185
Is there anyone here tonight

323
00:22:20,186 --> 00:22:22,391
that feels the need
to drink or use?

324
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,076
Go ahead, little sister.

325
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,762
<i>Don't be shy.</i>

326
00:22:30,735 --> 00:22:33,324
Um, I'm Sherry. I'm an addict.

327
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:34,859
Hi, Sherry.

328
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:43,586
Um, I've got 2 1/2 years clean.

329
00:22:43,587 --> 00:22:47,039
I got clean in prison,

330
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,957
and...

331
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:52,315
I feel like using so bad.

332
00:22:56,055 --> 00:23:01,042
From the age of 16 to 22,
heroin was the love of my life.

333
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:07,659
I mean, I had a daughter,

334
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,016
and I never even
took care of her,

335
00:23:11,017 --> 00:23:16,866
and I want to take care of her,

336
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:20,894
but I got to...

337
00:23:20,895 --> 00:23:24,443
stay clean, so I'm just here

338
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,938
to stay clean and...

339
00:23:33,268 --> 00:23:36,529
That's all I got.

340
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:43,529
Hey, Sherry.

341
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:46,694
Hey.

342
00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:50,051
Listen, don't worry
about your problems.

343
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:52,928
I mean, you're not alone.

344
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:54,367
Like, me, I could
completely relate

345
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,517
to what you were saying,

346
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:56,956
because I come
from a dysfunctional,

347
00:23:56,957 --> 00:23:58,299
alcoholic family.

348
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,327
And drugs were part
of my entire teenage life.

349
00:24:02,328 --> 00:24:03,478
When I was growing up,

350
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:05,684
I knew we weren't supposed
to be doing drugs,

351
00:24:05,685 --> 00:24:07,218
but everyone
was doing them anyway,

352
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:10,384
so I just...
I just fell into that, you know?

353
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,877
She's not hearing you, friend.

354
00:24:12,878 --> 00:24:16,234
She's got too much on her mind.

355
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:19,495
Do you need a ride home?

356
00:24:19,496 --> 00:24:21,605
Okay, thanks.

357
00:24:21,606 --> 00:24:23,236
He's right, Andy. I'm sorry.

358
00:24:24,387 --> 00:24:25,921
I'll catch up with you tomorrow.

359
00:24:40,787 --> 00:24:42,417
Sherry, did you ever

360
00:24:42,418 --> 00:24:47,404
<i>work at Tony Martino's joint,
the Paradise?</i>

361
00:24:47,405 --> 00:24:48,939
I used to cook speed

362
00:24:49,035 --> 00:24:51,048
in a warehouse
over at South Kearny.

363
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:53,926
<i>Tony was one of my partners.</i>

364
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:55,940
What's your name again?

365
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:57,187
Dean Walker.

366
00:24:57,188 --> 00:24:59,680
Dean Walker?

367
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:02,366
I don't know you.

368
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:06,873
Man, I was, like, 16
when I worked there, I think.

369
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,887
<i>Tony named me Lolita.</i>

370
00:25:08,888 --> 00:25:11,285
That was my stage name
because I was so young, Lolita.

371
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:13,012
<i>I had really long hair.</i>

372
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:14,067
Yeah, I remember.

373
00:25:14,068 --> 00:25:15,217
<i>You do?</i>

374
00:25:15,218 --> 00:25:16,848
You know
they closed that place down.

375
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:17,808
<i>Why,</i>

376
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,150
too many underage girls?

377
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,069
<i>No,</i>

378
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,123
it all came down

379
00:25:22,124 --> 00:25:23,370
when Richardson got into office.

380
00:25:23,371 --> 00:25:24,425
Tony lost all his juice.

381
00:25:24,426 --> 00:25:27,591
Where's he at, anyways?

382
00:25:27,687 --> 00:25:29,028
<i>Greenhaven.</i>

383
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:31,714
He got busted making a big move
in the city last year.

384
00:25:31,715 --> 00:25:33,344
They gave him 15 to life.

385
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:36,701
15 to life.

386
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,674
Damn, that's deep.

387
00:25:39,675 --> 00:25:41,880
<i>He probably deserved it,
though, right?</i>

388
00:25:41,881 --> 00:25:43,031
Ugh!

389
00:25:43,032 --> 00:25:44,853
Do you know Richie Parks?

390
00:25:44,854 --> 00:25:46,004
Richie Parks.

391
00:25:46,005 --> 00:25:47,635
No, I don't know him.
Who's that?

392
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:50,032
He's another lowlife scumbag.

393
00:25:50,033 --> 00:25:52,142
He's also my baby's daddy.

394
00:25:52,143 --> 00:25:54,828
He broke out a while ago.

395
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:57,513
I don't know
if he's alive or dead.

396
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,952
Do you have kids?

397
00:25:58,953 --> 00:25:59,912
Oh, yeah.

398
00:25:59,913 --> 00:26:01,541
I got three boys and two girls.

399
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:04,323
They all live in Oklahoma
with their mamas.

400
00:26:04,324 --> 00:26:05,570
Hmm.

401
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:06,720
Do you take care of them?

402
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:09,118
<i>Oh, yeah, I do now.</i>

403
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,940
So far away.

404
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:13,435
Yeah.

405
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,325
Okay, thanks, man.

406
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,764
Good night, little sister.

407
00:26:19,765 --> 00:26:21,011
And you take care, all right?

408
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,641
And be careful.

409
00:26:22,642 --> 00:26:24,464
Bye.

410
00:26:34,918 --> 00:26:36,836
I love you too.

411
00:26:36,837 --> 00:26:39,905
All right.

412
00:26:39,906 --> 00:26:41,728
Okay, bye.

413
00:26:45,468 --> 00:26:47,098
What's up?

414
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:49,304
Some fucking real-life bullshit
I had to deal with today.

415
00:26:49,305 --> 00:26:50,455
Are you done with the phone?

416
00:26:50,456 --> 00:26:51,989
Yeah, go ahead.

417
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,770
I forgot how it gets, you know.

418
00:26:54,771 --> 00:26:57,840
Here I was,
thinking prison was the worst;

419
00:26:57,841 --> 00:26:59,470
This was gonna be, like,
some kind of heaven,

420
00:26:59,471 --> 00:27:00,909
but it ain't, you know?

421
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,594
I heard that.

422
00:27:03,595 --> 00:27:07,143
That job shit got me tight.

423
00:27:07,144 --> 00:27:11,364
You all right?

424
00:27:19,324 --> 00:27:21,625
Good looking out, girl.

425
00:27:21,626 --> 00:27:24,503
Ain't no thing.

426
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,708
What are you looking at?

427
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:32,558
<i>Damn, white girl,
you are always on the phone.</i>

428
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,436
¿Estás sorda?

429
00:27:35,437 --> 00:27:37,258
Hey, Lynette. Hi.

430
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:38,984
How are you? It's Sherry.

431
00:27:38,985 --> 00:27:41,382
Is Bobby there?

432
00:27:41,383 --> 00:27:43,204
Don't you hear me?

433
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:47,520
Ah... Hey, Bobby, what's up?

434
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:49,630
It's Sherry, yeah.

435
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:52,316
How you doing?

436
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:54,713
Yeah?

437
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,207
Cool. Listen, I called
to talk to Alexis, actually.

438
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,262
Is she there?

439
00:27:58,263 --> 00:28:00,084
Why, you think
you're something special?

440
00:28:00,085 --> 00:28:01,524
What? She's sleeping?

441
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,770
Wait. Hold on a second.

442
00:28:02,771 --> 00:28:04,784
Get out of my face.

443
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:05,839
Bitch.

444
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,236
Uh...

445
00:28:08,237 --> 00:28:10,250
Okay, well,

446
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:12,552
I'm gonna call back tomorrow,
then, early,

447
00:28:12,553 --> 00:28:15,526
because I really want
to talk to her, okay?

448
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,472
Okay.

449
00:28:21,473 --> 00:28:23,295
Okay, Bobby. Bye.

450
00:28:33,557 --> 00:28:35,858
Have you got a problem with me?

451
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:38,735
Yeah, I've got
a problem with you, bitch.

452
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:40,175
You jealous of me or something?

453
00:28:40,271 --> 00:28:42,572
Your mother's a bitch.

454
00:28:42,573 --> 00:28:44,682
Oh, my mother's a bitch?

455
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:48,997
My mother's dead,
you fucking stupid crackhead.

456
00:28:48,998 --> 00:28:50,340
But you turned out good.

457
00:28:50,341 --> 00:28:51,779
Look at you.

458
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,409
Your daddy's
a fucking baby raper.

459
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,944
Get the...

460
00:28:54,945 --> 00:28:57,247
Fuck you, you fucking cunt!

461
00:28:58,206 --> 00:28:59,165
I'll call the cops!

462
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,698
Do you hear me?

463
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:02,904
Fuck you,
you fucking toothless cunt!

464
00:29:02,905 --> 00:29:04,343
Fuck you, <i>puta!</i>

465
00:29:04,344 --> 00:29:05,686
Now that you've
both been fucked,

466
00:29:05,687 --> 00:29:06,932
you should feel better.

467
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:08,083
I'm telling you, bitch,

468
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:09,810
you don't fuck with me,
because I will hurt you.

469
00:29:09,811 --> 00:29:11,632
Go to your rooms, now,

470
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:13,166
or I'm calling 911.

471
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:14,222
Go.

472
00:30:21,262 --> 00:30:23,085
Sherry, wake up.

473
00:30:26,442 --> 00:30:27,783
Oh.

474
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,607
What's going on?

475
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,553
Sorry.

476
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,430
Sorry to show up like this.

477
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:47,445
Bob.

478
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:48,405
<i>Yes, hon?</i>

479
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:52,337
Your sister's here.

480
00:30:53,871 --> 00:30:55,213
<i>Hey.</i>

481
00:30:55,214 --> 00:30:56,460
<i>Hey.</i>

482
00:30:56,461 --> 00:30:57,803
What are you doing here?

483
00:30:57,804 --> 00:30:59,049
Mommy!

484
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,968
Hey. Oh.

485
00:31:00,969 --> 00:31:02,598
<i>Hey, Lexi.</i>

486
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:06,339
<i>How you doing, kiddo?</i>

487
00:31:08,258 --> 00:31:11,038
Why do you have a garbage bag?

488
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,285
<i>A garbage bag?</i>

489
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:14,971
Okay, come on.

490
00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:16,698
Let's finish getting ready
for camp.

491
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:31,275
I can't stay at that place.

492
00:31:31,276 --> 00:31:33,768
<i>It's like being in prison
all over again.</i>

493
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,166
I know. I know. I hear you.

494
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:38,468
Mm.

495
00:31:38,469 --> 00:31:40,386
<i>But don't you
have to stay there?</i>

496
00:31:40,387 --> 00:31:41,441
No.

497
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:42,976
<i>I can live wherever I want.</i>

498
00:31:42,977 --> 00:31:44,031
<i>I just have a curfew.</i>

499
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:45,373
You take sugar?

500
00:31:45,374 --> 00:31:48,634
No.

501
00:31:48,635 --> 00:31:50,265
Milk?

502
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:52,088
No, thanks.

503
00:31:55,636 --> 00:31:57,266
So, Bobby,

504
00:31:57,267 --> 00:32:00,719
<i>I'm not asking to move in here.</i>

505
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,157
Okay?

506
00:32:02,158 --> 00:32:04,843
But I do need to stay here
for a little while.

507
00:32:04,844 --> 00:32:07,816
<i>Two weeks.</i>

508
00:32:07,817 --> 00:32:10,789
If I stay at that place,

509
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,187
I'm gonna violate.

510
00:32:13,188 --> 00:32:14,626
I can feel it.

511
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,518
Okay.

512
00:32:21,436 --> 00:32:23,257
Okay.

513
00:32:23,258 --> 00:32:26,230
No drugs in this house, Sherry.

514
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:28,340
You bring drugs in here,
and I'm going to call the cops.

515
00:32:28,341 --> 00:32:29,395
<i>Bobby,</i>

516
00:32:29,396 --> 00:32:32,657
how many times
do I got to tell you this?

517
00:32:32,753 --> 00:32:34,766
I'm clean.

518
00:32:34,767 --> 00:32:36,397
<i>Okay.</i>

519
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:37,739
Promise?

520
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,754
<i>Hey, my baby.</i>

521
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:44,070
I'm going to camp now, Sherry.

522
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:48,290
"Sherry"?

523
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:53,181
You want to give your mama
a kiss?

524
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:54,907
I think you do.

525
00:32:54,908 --> 00:32:55,867
<i>Alexis.</i>

526
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:57,305
An Eskimo kiss?

527
00:32:57,306 --> 00:32:58,935
<i>You're gonna be late for camp.</i>

528
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:00,470
<i>You remember what that one is?</i>

529
00:33:00,471 --> 00:33:01,471
Smooch!

530
00:33:02,868 --> 00:33:04,210
You have a good day, baby.

531
00:33:04,211 --> 00:33:05,170
Mm-hm. Okay.

532
00:33:05,171 --> 00:33:07,759
Bye, Alexis.

533
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,293
Have a good day, okay?

534
00:33:09,294 --> 00:33:10,294
Bye, baby.

535
00:33:10,349 --> 00:33:11,787
Oh, yeah, here's your lunch.

536
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:13,610
Bye, Sherry.

537
00:33:19,077 --> 00:33:20,323
What the fuck was that?

538
00:33:20,324 --> 00:33:21,283
What?

539
00:33:21,284 --> 00:33:23,679
She just called me Sherry.

540
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,763
Yeah.

541
00:33:28,764 --> 00:33:30,873
Me and Lynette were trying
to talk to you about that

542
00:33:30,874 --> 00:33:33,174
<i>the last time you were here.</i>

543
00:33:33,175 --> 00:33:34,901
You want to help me
with these boxes?

544
00:33:34,902 --> 00:33:36,436
<i>Yeah, babe.</i>

545
00:33:42,191 --> 00:33:43,341
I'll be right back.

546
00:33:43,342 --> 00:33:45,164
Oh, yeah, whatever.

547
00:33:53,124 --> 00:33:55,906
I'm her...
I'm her fucking mother.

548
00:35:09,755 --> 00:35:14,359
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

549
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,596
You want one?

550
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,748
Sure.

551
00:35:48,886 --> 00:35:50,420
Thanks.

552
00:35:54,545 --> 00:35:58,572
You don't think these pants
are too tight, do you?

553
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,203
Turn around. Let me see you.

554
00:36:04,135 --> 00:36:06,436
No, you got a good figure.

555
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:07,684
You look cute.

556
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:16,411
You think Lexi's
gonna get my body?

557
00:36:16,412 --> 00:36:17,371
I don't know.

558
00:36:17,372 --> 00:36:19,576
<i>I do.</i>

559
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:23,413
That girl is going to be
tall and skinny.

560
00:36:23,509 --> 00:36:26,865
Watch.

561
00:36:26,866 --> 00:36:28,688
I'm gonna look out for her.

562
00:36:31,373 --> 00:36:33,100
Want me to do your makeup later?

563
00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:37,798
Would you?

564
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:39,812
Sure.

565
00:36:39,813 --> 00:36:42,691
Just let me finish this first.

566
00:36:44,801 --> 00:36:47,485
I'm going to do your eyes purple
to match your pants, okay?

567
00:36:47,486 --> 00:36:49,211
And I'll give it to you
when I'm done,

568
00:36:49,212 --> 00:36:51,226
so you can have it.

569
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,584
I never got a professional
makeup job before.

570
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:02,736
Thank you.

571
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,544
You know, every Friday night
in my cell,

572
00:37:09,545 --> 00:37:11,750
we'd have ladies' night.

573
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:13,956
We'd put on face masks
and wear lingerie

574
00:37:13,957 --> 00:37:15,491
and stuff like that.

575
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,573
Lingerie in jail.

576
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:21,916
You're really nuts.

577
00:37:21,917 --> 00:37:23,067
That's what happens

578
00:37:23,068 --> 00:37:24,890
when you got to wear
state clothes every day.

579
00:37:27,192 --> 00:37:30,069
You didn't go with any girls,
did you?

580
00:37:35,248 --> 00:37:36,590
No.

581
00:37:36,591 --> 00:37:38,700
Some girls in there
tried to get with me,

582
00:37:38,701 --> 00:37:42,154
but I told them
what time it was.

583
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,292
Daddy.

584
00:37:55,293 --> 00:37:58,074
Sherry Anne.

585
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,129
What's that?

586
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,855
Hi. How are you?

587
00:38:00,856 --> 00:38:02,102
Well, we got into some traffic.

588
00:38:02,103 --> 00:38:03,349
Hey, Marcia.

589
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,787
<i>Hey, how you doing?</i> Good.

590
00:38:04,788 --> 00:38:06,227
<i>Don't cry. You'll make me cry.</i>

591
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,254
Oh.

592
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:12,460
Come on, stop it.

593
00:38:12,461 --> 00:38:14,954
It's okay.

594
00:38:14,955 --> 00:38:17,255
We should have taken 22, and...

595
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:19,366
I missed you so much.

596
00:38:19,462 --> 00:38:21,764
I missed you too.

597
00:38:23,203 --> 00:38:25,504
Come on, say hi to my wife.

598
00:38:25,505 --> 00:38:26,464
Look at my makeup.

599
00:38:26,465 --> 00:38:27,805
It's real pretty.

600
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,244
<i>Yeah, we took 78, and...</i>

601
00:38:29,245 --> 00:38:30,587
Remember Marcia?

602
00:38:30,588 --> 00:38:31,643
Hi. Hi.

603
00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:34,040
Bob.

604
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,190
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

605
00:38:35,191 --> 00:38:37,108
You really got to clean out
those gutters, you know?

606
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:38,548
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.</i>

607
00:38:43,152 --> 00:38:44,206
This ought to help you out.

608
00:38:44,207 --> 00:38:45,166
You know, Dad,

609
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:48,906
<i>you don't have to give me money.</i>

610
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:50,920
<i>Grandpa's here.</i>

611
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,879
Oh, there she is.

612
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,125
Oh, Lexi.

613
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:54,947
There's my precious little girl.

614
00:38:54,948 --> 00:38:57,153
Here, honey. This is for you.

615
00:38:57,154 --> 00:38:58,497
Can I just fix this?

616
00:38:58,593 --> 00:38:59,839
Dad.

617
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,799
Oh, this is hot.

618
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,045
Attagirl.

619
00:39:02,046 --> 00:39:04,442
Look at you and Grandpa.

620
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:05,785
What do you say, Alexis?

621
00:39:05,786 --> 00:39:06,745
Thank you, Grandma.

622
00:39:06,746 --> 00:39:07,799
<i>You're welcome.</i>

623
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,759
Hey, Dad.

624
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,197
Hey, Dad.

625
00:39:10,198 --> 00:39:12,211
Dad, look at how much
we look alike

626
00:39:12,212 --> 00:39:14,129
now that she's got bigger.

627
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,089
Look at that.

628
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,911
She's beautiful, isn't she?

629
00:39:16,912 --> 00:39:17,965
What do you got there?

630
00:39:17,966 --> 00:39:19,212
Dad.

631
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:22,185
Dad, there's a...
I want to show you something.

632
00:39:22,186 --> 00:39:23,528
<i>Daddy.</i>

633
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:24,488
Come on.

634
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:25,638
I want to show you something.

635
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,173
Come on.
Let's go see what Sherry wants.

636
00:39:27,174 --> 00:39:28,133
<i>I got my GED.</i>

637
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:29,092
Okeydoke.

638
00:39:29,093 --> 00:39:30,146
<i>Okeydoke.</i>

639
00:39:30,147 --> 00:39:33,119
<i>I want to show you.</i>

640
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,092
I want to welcome home my baby,

641
00:39:36,093 --> 00:39:38,107
Sherry Anne.

642
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:40,409
Welcome home, Sher.

643
00:39:41,752 --> 00:39:43,669
Cheers. Cheers.

644
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,670
Cheers.

645
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:47,123
<i>I want soda.</i>

646
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:49,423
Milk first.

647
00:39:49,424 --> 00:39:51,629
<i>Then you'll get your soda.</i>

648
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,986
Hey, Lynnie,
this sure looks good.

649
00:39:54,987 --> 00:39:58,247
Did you help with this?

650
00:39:58,248 --> 00:39:59,248
No.

651
00:40:03,427 --> 00:40:04,769
So how's the Caddy
holding up, Dad?

652
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,207
Eat your burger first.

653
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:07,838
<i>It's the perfect piece
of machinery.</i>

654
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,468
<i>You know, you've had
that car so long,</i>

655
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:10,523
<i>I don't think it's safe for you</i>

656
00:40:10,524 --> 00:40:11,674
to drive it down to Florida
this year.

657
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:12,825
<i>I don't think so either.</i>

658
00:40:12,826 --> 00:40:13,880
<i>You need a new car, Dad.</i>

659
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:14,840
Now?

660
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:15,895
Okay.

661
00:40:15,991 --> 00:40:17,711
I swear, she's hooked
on the Disney Channel.

662
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,786
<i>Did you see that email</i>

663
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:21,746
Marty sent around?

664
00:40:21,747 --> 00:40:22,800
Bobby, that's disgusting.

665
00:40:22,801 --> 00:40:24,622
We're eating here.

666
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:26,828
<i>They're going to start charging
for emails, you know.</i>

667
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:28,746
<i>Alexis, come eat
more of your burger.</i>

668
00:40:28,747 --> 00:40:30,472
<i>That's what I keep saying,
you know.</i>

669
00:40:30,473 --> 00:40:32,486
<i>That Marty,
he's a real piece of work.</i>

670
00:40:32,487 --> 00:40:34,021
I don't know
where he finds that stuff,

671
00:40:34,022 --> 00:40:36,610
but he does.

672
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:39,488
<i>Come on, pass me
that potato salad.</i>

673
00:40:39,489 --> 00:40:41,310
<i>There you go.</i>

674
00:40:41,311 --> 00:40:43,420
<i>I don't want to waste room
on salad.</i>

675
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:46,201
Yeah?

676
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:47,256
You do?

677
00:40:47,257 --> 00:40:48,599
<i>Yeah.</i>

678
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,284
Okay, Alexis wants
to hear me sing for you all.

679
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:52,915
Spare us, Sher.

680
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:54,450
We don't want to break
any glasses.

681
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:00,013
<i>Alexis.</i>

682
00:42:14,918 --> 00:42:15,972
That was good, Sher.

683
00:42:15,973 --> 00:42:17,698
Should have gone
on <i>American Idol.</i>

684
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:18,849
You'd probably win.

685
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:21,438
Don't be a wise guy.

686
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:22,399
Sherry's a good singer.

687
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,028
<i>Beautiful, baby.</i>

688
00:42:24,029 --> 00:42:27,002
Okay, I'm going to get
some more wine.

689
00:42:28,441 --> 00:42:31,413
<i>Come on, baby bear.</i>

690
00:42:31,414 --> 00:42:32,564
<i>I'm putting him in.</i>

691
00:42:32,565 --> 00:42:33,715
<i>I'm putting him in.</i>

692
00:42:33,716 --> 00:42:37,647
I think this looks good
like that.

693
00:42:37,648 --> 00:42:39,086
Can I come in yet?

694
00:42:39,087 --> 00:42:40,716
<i>Nope.</i>

695
00:42:40,717 --> 00:42:43,018
Is that good?

696
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,936
<i>Yeah, that's good.</i>

697
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,526
<i>This can be your baby.</i>

698
00:42:47,527 --> 00:42:49,636
And this can be mine.

699
00:42:49,637 --> 00:42:51,267
What's your baby's name?

700
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:54,815
My baby...

701
00:42:54,816 --> 00:42:55,870
um...

702
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,555
my baby is named Alexis.

703
00:42:58,556 --> 00:42:59,898
No!

704
00:42:59,899 --> 00:43:01,624
What do you mean, "no"?

705
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:04,501
This is pretend,

706
00:43:04,502 --> 00:43:07,666
and you have to pick a new name.

707
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:09,489
Why?

708
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,790
Because.

709
00:43:11,791 --> 00:43:14,955
But Alexis is my favorite name.

710
00:43:14,956 --> 00:43:16,106
No.

711
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:18,216
Besides, there could be
two Alexises.

712
00:43:18,217 --> 00:43:20,518
Well, okay.

713
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:21,861
You can call her that,

714
00:43:21,862 --> 00:43:24,738
but then my baby's name
can be Sherry.

715
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:27,807
Two Alexises and two Sherrys.

716
00:43:27,808 --> 00:43:28,959
Two Alexises...

717
00:43:29,055 --> 00:43:31,069
And two Sherrys.

718
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:36,343
Ah!

719
00:43:36,344 --> 00:43:37,303
Mm-mm.

720
00:43:37,304 --> 00:43:38,933
In the fort, in here.

721
00:43:38,934 --> 00:43:39,893
Let's go.

722
00:43:39,893 --> 00:43:40,852
Okay.

723
00:43:40,853 --> 00:43:44,880
Should I take this Sherry?

724
00:43:46,127 --> 00:43:49,770
Lynnie told me to call you
Sherry, not Mommy.

725
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:55,812
Yeah, I figured.

726
00:43:55,813 --> 00:43:57,251
Squeak, squeak, squeak.

727
00:43:57,252 --> 00:43:58,690
When you come and live with me,

728
00:43:58,691 --> 00:44:00,512
<i>you can call me Momm</i>

729
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,814
Alexis, Grandma Mary's here
to see you.

730
00:44:02,815 --> 00:44:03,965
<i>Grandma Mary.</i>

731
00:44:03,966 --> 00:44:06,458
No, baby.

732
00:44:06,459 --> 00:44:07,898
<i>She's waiting.</i>

733
00:44:09,528 --> 00:44:12,021
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

734
00:44:12,022 --> 00:44:13,556
<i>Hi, Grandma.</i>

735
00:44:13,557 --> 00:44:17,392
You are confusing her
with this Sherry bullshit.

736
00:44:17,393 --> 00:44:19,310
I'm confusing her?

737
00:44:19,311 --> 00:44:20,749
I don't think so.

738
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,187
She was fine
until you showed up again.

739
00:44:22,188 --> 00:44:23,434
I'm her mother.

740
00:44:23,435 --> 00:44:24,394
Well, act like one.

741
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:25,736
What, are you fucking jealous?

742
00:44:25,737 --> 00:44:27,654
You want to... you're gonna
curse in front of her?

743
00:44:27,655 --> 00:44:29,093
You want to see
my stretch marks, Lyn?

744
00:44:29,094 --> 00:44:30,435
<i>Don't be disgusting.</i>

745
00:44:30,436 --> 00:44:33,314
Check this out.
You want to check this out?

746
00:44:50,098 --> 00:44:52,495
It's just too many people
in a house.

747
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:11,292
I told you, you can't just keep
sleeping on the floor like that.

748
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:13,499
You should be on my side.

749
00:45:19,637 --> 00:45:22,034
<i>Here, you need some cash?</i>

750
00:45:22,035 --> 00:45:25,200
Daddy, gave me some cash.

751
00:45:25,296 --> 00:45:28,652
Sherry, here.

752
00:45:28,653 --> 00:45:31,913
I'm your fucking sister.

753
00:45:31,914 --> 00:45:33,351
Shit!

754
00:45:33,352 --> 00:45:38,340
I'll just wait out here,
make sure you get a room.

755
00:45:52,342 --> 00:45:54,835
Dean, hey, it's Sherry,

756
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:56,561
Tony Martino's girl.

757
00:45:56,562 --> 00:45:57,562
Yeah.

758
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,699
Yeah, I met you
at Genesis Recovery, remember?

759
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,386
I was just, um...

760
00:46:05,482 --> 00:46:08,647
uh...

761
00:46:10,661 --> 00:46:15,551
Well, I was just calling
because I was...

762
00:46:15,552 --> 00:46:22,169
I was...

763
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,375
I was wondering if, um...

764
00:46:24,376 --> 00:46:26,390
What you were doing.

765
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,311
<i>Who's there?</i>

766
00:46:42,407 --> 00:46:44,229
<i>Dean.</i>

767
00:46:55,258 --> 00:46:56,792
Greetings.

768
00:46:56,793 --> 00:46:59,574
Damn, you got here late.

769
00:47:07,343 --> 00:47:09,261
Oh, no.

770
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:20,962
Damn.

771
00:47:25,086 --> 00:47:26,619
<i>You like my hair?</i>

772
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:29,210
Yeah, it ain't bad.

773
00:47:44,555 --> 00:47:47,911
Ooh, look at that.

774
00:47:47,912 --> 00:47:49,446
Mm-hmm.

775
00:47:49,447 --> 00:47:51,076
Mmm.

776
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:54,433
Looking good, little Lolita.

777
00:47:54,434 --> 00:47:58,174
Don't call me that.

778
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:04,312
You got to stop
drinking that poison.

779
00:48:23,206 --> 00:48:24,644
Did you ever see me dance?

780
00:48:24,645 --> 00:48:26,850
Oh, yeah.

781
00:48:26,851 --> 00:48:29,056
Are you going to dance
for me tonight?

782
00:48:29,057 --> 00:48:30,016
No.

783
00:48:30,017 --> 00:48:34,811
I gave that shit up.

784
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:38,168
Good little girl.

785
00:48:38,264 --> 00:48:43,059
Doesn't dance
for anybody anymore.

786
00:49:16,148 --> 00:49:18,068
You had any police contact
this weekend, Swanson?

787
00:49:18,162 --> 00:49:19,887
No, but I called... On the wall!

788
00:49:19,888 --> 00:49:21,134
Get your hands on the wall now!

789
00:49:21,135 --> 00:49:22,765
I told you I was going
to my brother's house.

790
00:49:22,766 --> 00:49:24,395
I called you. I left you a...
You didn't get my message?

791
00:49:24,396 --> 00:49:25,355
Shut up!

792
00:49:25,355 --> 00:49:26,314
What the fuck?

793
00:49:26,315 --> 00:49:27,368
You can stay where you want,

794
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:29,286
but you will go through
the proper channels.

795
00:49:29,287 --> 00:49:30,917
Spread 'em.
Kick your shoes off; Let's go.

796
00:49:30,918 --> 00:49:33,219
Kick them off. Kick them off.

797
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,657
Spread 'em out.
Come on; Let's go.

798
00:49:34,658 --> 00:49:35,617
You've done this before.

799
00:49:35,618 --> 00:49:36,767
Pat her down.

800
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:38,494
Keep that chest
pressed against the wall.

801
00:49:38,495 --> 00:49:40,316
<i>You think just because you can
send me back to prison,</i>

802
00:49:40,317 --> 00:49:41,371
<i>you're strong?</i>

803
00:49:41,372 --> 00:49:42,618
<i>Control yourself.</i> I'm strong.

804
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:43,578
<i>Shut up.</i>

805
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:45,687
Stand up straight.

806
00:49:45,688 --> 00:49:48,372
Right foot up. Right foot up.

807
00:49:48,373 --> 00:49:50,098
Right foot up.

808
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:51,441
You are fucking
with the wrong one today.

809
00:49:51,442 --> 00:49:53,042
Put your right foot up.
Get your foot up!

810
00:49:54,128 --> 00:49:56,142
Left foot up.

811
00:49:56,238 --> 00:49:57,963
Left food up.

812
00:49:57,964 --> 00:50:00,170
Spread 'em. Officer.

813
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:09,184
<i>I could violate your ass
right now,</i>

814
00:50:09,185 --> 00:50:10,335
send you back to prison
for two more years.

815
00:50:10,336 --> 00:50:11,336
Is that what you want?

816
00:50:24,435 --> 00:50:27,599
But a job came through for you,

817
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,381
and I'm going
to let you take it.

818
00:50:34,313 --> 00:50:36,807
Top of your head. Look away.

819
00:50:42,178 --> 00:50:43,328
Listen, I'm going to do good.

820
00:50:43,329 --> 00:50:44,670
Just... just be quiet.

821
00:50:44,671 --> 00:50:46,493
I graduated a lot of programs
when I was in prison.

822
00:50:46,494 --> 00:50:48,794
Look, shut up.

823
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,618
Put your shoes back on.

824
00:50:56,468 --> 00:50:58,385
It's a Catholic Charities
youth organization,

825
00:50:58,386 --> 00:51:00,304
summer program
over on Irvine Turner.

826
00:51:00,305 --> 00:51:02,605
Monroe somehow convinced them

827
00:51:02,606 --> 00:51:05,003
<i>that you'd been rehabilitated.</i>

828
00:51:05,004 --> 00:51:06,443
<i>Here's the address.</i>

829
00:51:13,348 --> 00:51:16,800
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

830
00:51:16,801 --> 00:51:18,143
Thank you.

831
00:51:19,582 --> 00:51:21,212
<i>Everybody in line?
Everybody ready?</i>

832
00:51:21,213 --> 00:51:23,226
<i>I want to see if you guys
are tough.</i>

833
00:51:23,227 --> 00:51:24,664
All right. Okay, come on.

834
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:26,295
Let's see what you got.

835
00:51:26,296 --> 00:51:27,829
Good, good.

836
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:28,789
Okay, end of the line.

837
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:29,939
What's your name? Zak.

838
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,282
Okay, Zak,
let's see what you got.

839
00:51:31,283 --> 00:51:32,242
Uh-huh, uh-huh,

840
00:51:32,243 --> 00:51:33,392
but this is what you got to do.

841
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:34,831
You got to bend your knees, see?

842
00:51:34,832 --> 00:51:36,077
And you got to follow through.

843
00:51:36,078 --> 00:51:37,037
Okay, let's see.

844
00:51:37,038 --> 00:51:38,955
Follow through. Good, good.

845
00:51:38,956 --> 00:51:40,297
You are a little badass.

846
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:41,257
One more.

847
00:51:41,258 --> 00:51:42,311
Ow!

848
00:51:42,312 --> 00:51:43,462
Ow, he's strong.

849
00:51:43,463 --> 00:51:44,517
He's... how about you?

850
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,668
What have you got?

851
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:46,915
You got to show me
a little harder.

852
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:48,641
I want to see
that power you got.

853
00:51:48,642 --> 00:51:49,888
Good.

854
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:51,903
Yeah, you know
what you're doing.

855
00:51:51,999 --> 00:51:53,149
You got to bend your knees.

856
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,396
You got to focus, Chastity.

857
00:51:54,397 --> 00:51:55,356
You got to focus.

858
00:51:55,357 --> 00:51:56,410
You got to focus.

859
00:51:56,411 --> 00:51:57,753
Yeah, what's your name?

860
00:51:57,754 --> 00:51:59,191
Russel. That's good, Russel.

861
00:51:59,192 --> 00:52:00,534
One more, Russel.
You got one more.

862
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:02,164
Good, good, good.

863
00:52:02,165 --> 00:52:03,315
All right, I know your name.

864
00:52:03,316 --> 00:52:05,521
Let's see...

865
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:06,481
Okay.

866
00:52:06,482 --> 00:52:07,727
We can't play this game anymore.

867
00:52:07,728 --> 00:52:08,687
Let's play another game.

868
00:52:08,688 --> 00:52:09,741
Let's play z

869
00:52:09,742 --> 00:52:12,715
Okay, who told me
they wanted to be a dinosaur?

870
00:52:52,134 --> 00:52:53,188
What's up?

871
00:52:53,189 --> 00:52:54,818
What are you doing here?

872
00:52:54,819 --> 00:52:56,449
I just came by to say hey.

873
00:52:56,450 --> 00:53:00,477
Uh... I'm kind of busy
right now.

874
00:53:00,478 --> 00:53:02,107
Oh, yeah?

875
00:53:02,108 --> 00:53:03,738
Yeah.

876
00:53:03,739 --> 00:53:06,808
You got a broad in there?

877
00:53:09,014 --> 00:53:11,506
I fucking thought
you liked me, man.

878
00:53:11,507 --> 00:53:12,753
I do like you.

879
00:53:12,754 --> 00:53:14,096
Hey, no, wait, wait, wait.

880
00:53:14,097 --> 00:53:15,822
<i>From a bank robbery</i>

881
00:53:15,823 --> 00:53:17,165
<i>at 10913rd Avenue.</i>

882
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:18,987
<i>A male black about 6 feet tall</i>

883
00:53:18,988 --> 00:53:21,864
<i>with one eye,
wearing a white do-rag</i>

884
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,591

885
00:53:23,592 --> 00:53:24,838
<i>The direction?</i>

886
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:26,468
<i>It's heading...</i>

887
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:29,154
All right, come back
in 20 minutes, all right?

888
00:53:29,155 --> 00:53:31,647
Yeah, okay. Okay!

889
00:53:31,648 --> 00:53:33,566
20 minutes.

890
00:54:11,258 --> 00:54:13,176
So what's her name?

891
00:54:13,177 --> 00:54:14,136
<i>Where does she live?</i>

892
00:54:14,137 --> 00:54:15,381
<i>Why should I tell you,</i>

893
00:54:15,382 --> 00:54:16,724
<i>so you can hunt her down
and beat her ass?</i>

894
00:54:16,725 --> 00:54:19,026
No, I'm not going
back to prison, Dean.

895
00:54:19,027 --> 00:54:20,656
I just want to know
who this bitch is

896
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:23,246
you'd rather be fucking than me.

897
00:54:23,247 --> 00:54:26,124
<i>No way you want to go
down that road.</i>

898
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:30,535
Oh, yeah, tell me more.

899
00:54:30,536 --> 00:54:31,782
I be you wouldn't like it

900
00:54:31,783 --> 00:54:34,084
<i>if I started fucking Andy Kelly.</i>

901
00:54:34,085 --> 00:54:35,330
<i>It wouldn't matter to me.</i>

902
00:54:35,331 --> 00:54:37,057
Oh, no?

903
00:54:37,058 --> 00:54:39,742
Fucking figures.

904
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:42,045
At least he knows
how to eat pussy.

905
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,921
What was that?
I didn't hear you.

906
00:54:44,922 --> 00:54:46,553
Nothing.

907
00:54:52,211 --> 00:54:54,225
Shit.

908
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,103
I'm sorry.

909
00:54:58,925 --> 00:55:01,897
I'm such a piece of shit
sometimes.

910
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:04,199
I can't control myself.

911
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,940
Nobody owns anybody.

912
00:55:08,036 --> 00:55:11,585
The state of New Jersey
owns my ass.

913
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:21,846
I miss my friend, man.

914
00:55:21,847 --> 00:55:23,189
Crusher.

915
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,627
<i>She always had my back.</i>

916
00:55:24,628 --> 00:55:26,162
Well, I can be your friend.

917
00:55:26,163 --> 00:55:27,697
It's not about that.

918
00:55:30,671 --> 00:55:33,067
What are you cooking?

919
00:55:33,068 --> 00:55:34,986
Venison stew.

920
00:55:36,329 --> 00:55:37,671
What's that?

921
00:55:37,672 --> 00:55:39,685
It's deer meat.

922
00:55:39,686 --> 00:55:41,315
Mmm.

923
00:55:41,316 --> 00:55:43,810
I never ate Bambi before.

924
00:55:43,906 --> 00:55:45,823
Well, actually, it isn't Bambi.

925
00:55:45,824 --> 00:55:48,892
It's Bambi's daddy.

926
00:55:48,893 --> 00:55:49,947
Ooh, yeah?

927
00:55:49,948 --> 00:55:54,264
Bambi's daddy,
that's pretty funny.

928
00:56:13,446 --> 00:56:16,514
Bobby, hey, what's up?

929
00:56:16,515 --> 00:56:18,048
Yeah?

930
00:56:18,049 --> 00:56:21,117
I had my first day
of work today.

931
00:56:21,118 --> 00:56:22,173
It was cool.

932
00:56:22,269 --> 00:56:24,954
Made me think of my baby.

933
00:56:24,955 --> 00:56:30,517
Is she there?
I really want to talk to her.

934
00:56:30,518 --> 00:56:33,010
Why do you always got to tell me
the same shit, Bobby?

935
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:34,065
I know she's there.

936
00:56:34,066 --> 00:56:35,504
I know she's fucking awake.

937
00:56:35,505 --> 00:56:41,162
It's 7:30.

938
00:56:41,163 --> 00:56:42,217
What about her birthday?

939
00:56:42,218 --> 00:56:44,807
You guys have anything planned?

940
00:56:44,808 --> 00:56:47,110
Oh, yeah, I will...
I will be there.

941
00:58:01,822 --> 00:58:05,082
<i>Okay, at this next block,</i>

942
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:06,329
turn left.

943
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:07,960
Yes, ma'am.

944
00:58:07,961 --> 00:58:10,645
<i>It's the third house
on the left.</i>

945
00:58:10,646 --> 00:58:12,180
<i>You grew up there?</i>

946
00:58:12,181 --> 00:58:13,235
<i>Yup.</i>

947
00:58:13,236 --> 00:58:15,057
<i>That's fancy.</i>

948
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:16,591
<i>I guess.</i>

949
00:58:16,592 --> 00:58:17,551
<i>You want to come in</i>

950
00:58:17,552 --> 00:58:18,894
and meet my family?

951
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:21,195
No, no, you go
and enjoy your daughter.

952
00:58:21,196 --> 00:58:25,128
Call me when you're ready
to be picked up.

953
00:58:27,526 --> 00:58:29,059
All right, I'll see you later.

954
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,499
Bye-bye.

955
00:58:38,843 --> 00:58:40,665
Hello!

956
00:58:48,338 --> 00:58:49,967
Hey, wait.

957
00:58:49,968 --> 00:58:51,022
Dean!

958
00:58:51,023 --> 00:58:53,996
Dean, wait! Wait! Wait!

959
00:58:56,011 --> 00:58:59,559
Those fuckers aren't home.

960
00:58:59,655 --> 00:59:00,805
<i>What do you want to do?</i>

961
00:59:00,806 --> 00:59:03,299
Um...

962
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,929
Let's go to my dad's house.

963
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:07,520
Maybe they're there.

964
00:59:29,675 --> 00:59:31,592
You're late.
We just finished the cake.

965
00:59:31,593 --> 00:59:33,606
Well, maybe if you'd told me
where the party was at...

966
00:59:33,607 --> 00:59:35,333
Hold on one second.

967
00:59:43,102 --> 00:59:45,786
<i>Hey, Alexis, I think you have
more presents to open.</i>

968
00:59:45,787 --> 00:59:47,226
<i>Don't push me.</i>

969
00:59:49,528 --> 00:59:52,212
Hi, Alexis.

970
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:55,089
Alexis, hey.

971
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:57,199
Happy birthday, baby.

972
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,735
Happy birthday.

973
01:00:00,269 --> 01:00:03,817
<i>Happy, happy, happy birthday.</i>

974
01:00:03,818 --> 01:00:05,735
Sherry brought you
some presents.

975
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:06,886
What do you say?

976
01:00:06,887 --> 01:00:08,804
Thanks.

977
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:10,051
Here you go, babe.

978
01:00:10,052 --> 01:00:11,011
Can I open it?

979
01:00:11,012 --> 01:00:12,737
Go ahead; Open it.

980
01:00:12,738 --> 01:00:14,176
<i>Open all of them. Open them.</i>

981
01:00:14,272 --> 01:00:15,326
<i>I want to open one.</i>

982
01:00:15,327 --> 01:00:16,765
Oh, look at this.

983
01:00:16,766 --> 01:00:19,931
You're going to look
just like a ballerina.

984
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:22,327
<i>Sherry Anne.</i>

985
01:00:22,328 --> 01:00:26,643
Welcome.

986
01:00:26,644 --> 01:00:27,794
Can I get you a drink?

987
01:00:27,795 --> 01:00:29,904
Yeah, thanks.

988
01:00:29,905 --> 01:00:32,014
Number two.

989
01:00:32,015 --> 01:00:33,549
<i>I don't want to play anymore!</i>

990
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:35,850
Look at it.
Look at the front, though.

991
01:00:35,851 --> 01:00:38,152
Candy lipstick.

992
01:00:38,153 --> 01:00:41,221
And this is special gum.

993
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:42,372
Special gum?

994
01:00:42,373 --> 01:00:43,523
Yeah, but it's inside.

995
01:00:43,524 --> 01:00:44,674
So much candy.

996
01:00:44,675 --> 01:00:46,976
You want to open it?

997
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:48,798
Game Boy.

998
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,716
You have one of those
already, sweetie.

999
01:00:50,717 --> 01:00:52,155
You do? I could take it back.

1000
01:00:52,156 --> 01:00:54,170
If you want to,
I'll find you something else.

1001
01:00:54,266 --> 01:00:55,320
No.

1002
01:00:55,321 --> 01:00:56,471
I want two Game Boys.

1003
01:00:56,472 --> 01:00:58,005
You can't have two;
That's silly.

1004
01:00:58,006 --> 01:01:00,019
You can have
whatever you want, baby.

1005
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,938
<i>Lookit. You got finger paints.</i>

1006
01:01:01,939 --> 01:01:03,472
<i>No!</i>

1007
01:01:03,473 --> 01:01:05,103
That's my present!

1008
01:01:05,104 --> 01:01:06,445
It's mine.

1009
01:01:06,446 --> 01:01:08,939
No fair.

1010
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,337
It's my present.

1011
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:12,775
Yes, honey.

1012
01:01:12,776 --> 01:01:13,735
Alexis.

1013
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:14,789
It's your present.

1014
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:16,132
Nobody is going to take it
away from you.

1015
01:01:16,133 --> 01:01:17,762
<i>What happened?</i>

1016
01:01:17,763 --> 01:01:20,064
<i>What's going on?</i>

1017
01:01:20,065 --> 01:01:21,119
Let's go, guys.

1018
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,037
Let's go downstairs
and play musical chairs.

1019
01:01:23,038 --> 01:01:24,284
<i>Let's go, everybody.</i>

1020
01:01:24,285 --> 01:01:25,531
I think they need some time out.

1021
01:01:25,532 --> 01:01:27,449
<i>You come too.</i>

1022
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,463
<i>Here we go, everybody.</i>

1023
01:01:29,464 --> 01:01:30,807
<i>We're all coming.</i>

1024
01:01:35,027 --> 01:01:36,561
What a mess, huh?

1025
01:01:36,562 --> 01:01:39,534
<i>Whoo!</i>

1026
01:01:39,535 --> 01:01:43,563
<i>Okay, not fair.</i>

1027
01:01:47,783 --> 01:01:48,838
You all right?

1028
01:01:52,578 --> 01:01:55,934
<i>Dad,</i>

1029
01:01:55,935 --> 01:01:58,332
I feel like...

1030
01:01:58,333 --> 01:02:00,058
I don't know what to do.

1031
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:03,607
I feel like they're taking her
away from me.

1032
01:02:03,608 --> 01:02:06,676
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1033
01:02:07,732 --> 01:02:10,897
Bobby and Lynette,
they love you a whole lot.

1034
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:12,622
I love you.

1035
01:02:12,623 --> 01:02:16,938
<i>Dad, she won't even talk to me.</i>

1036
01:02:16,939 --> 01:02:20,870
You should have seen her
when I first came back.

1037
01:02:20,871 --> 01:02:22,021
She was playing with me.

1038
01:02:22,022 --> 01:02:23,076
She was hugging me.

1039
01:02:23,077 --> 01:02:24,227
She was calling me Mommy.

1040
01:02:24,228 --> 01:02:27,680
They told her
not to call me Mommy anymore.

1041
01:02:27,681 --> 01:02:29,023
<i>Can you believe that shit?</i>

1042
01:02:29,024 --> 01:02:30,845
<i>Sherry, just give them some time</i>

1043
01:02:30,846 --> 01:02:32,380
<i>to get used to you again.</i>

1044
01:02:33,531 --> 01:02:35,544
Come on.

1045
01:02:35,545 --> 01:02:37,463
I know, but...

1046
01:02:40,245 --> 01:02:42,163
Come on.

1047
01:02:50,219 --> 01:02:52,233
<i>Just give it a little time,
honey.</i>

1048
01:03:06,811 --> 01:03:07,811
<i>What?</i>

1049
01:03:10,744 --> 01:03:14,101
Sherry, what?

1050
01:03:51,313 --> 01:03:53,135
Baby, you got that taste?

1051
01:06:27,356 --> 01:06:29,465
Keep you coming back.

1052
01:06:29,466 --> 01:06:30,904
It works if you work it.

1053
01:06:30,905 --> 01:06:33,398
It won't if you don't.

1054
01:06:38,673 --> 01:06:40,112
What happened to you?

1055
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:43,084
I walked home, man.

1056
01:06:43,085 --> 01:06:45,961
You're also fucked up.

1057
01:06:45,962 --> 01:06:47,400
Come on; Let's go clean you up.

1058
01:06:47,401 --> 01:06:50,565
Hey, lay off the goods, man.

1059
01:06:50,566 --> 01:06:52,004
I can walk.

1060
01:06:52,005 --> 01:06:53,827
Well, then, let's walk.

1061
01:07:26,532 --> 01:07:27,969
<i>Can I come in?</i>

1062
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:29,889
Yeah.

1063
01:07:45,426 --> 01:07:47,344
<i>Come on; Get undressed.</i>

1064
01:08:12,376 --> 01:08:16,212
You are a real,
live Injun, Dean.

1065
01:08:24,269 --> 01:08:28,488
I bet you're a good dad.

1066
01:08:28,489 --> 01:08:32,036
It's too bad your kids
never get to see you.

1067
01:08:32,037 --> 01:08:36,929
I'm... I'm going this winter.

1068
01:08:37,024 --> 01:08:38,847
Want to go with me?

1069
01:08:43,163 --> 01:08:45,177
One day at a time, right?

1070
01:08:47,287 --> 01:08:51,410
<i>Hey.</i>

1071
01:08:51,411 --> 01:08:52,561
Lazy lady.

1072
01:08:52,562 --> 01:08:53,807
Come on, sleepy, get up.

1073
01:08:53,808 --> 01:08:56,397
Wake up.

1074
01:08:56,398 --> 01:08:59,274
I was dreaming so much.

1075
01:08:59,275 --> 01:09:02,343
I want my baby back, Dean.

1076
01:09:02,344 --> 01:09:06,659
I want Alexis.

1077
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,481
You know, if you
stop talking so much

1078
01:09:08,482 --> 01:09:10,975
about what you want,
stop being so selfish,

1079
01:09:10,976 --> 01:09:15,963
maybe what you want
will come to you on its own.

1080
01:09:16,059 --> 01:09:17,977
Okay.

1081
01:09:22,485 --> 01:09:24,691
I'm just mad 'cause I suck.

1082
01:09:28,144 --> 01:09:30,540
Shit.

1083
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,746
Dean?

1084
01:09:32,747 --> 01:09:34,089
<i>Yeah?</i>

1085
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:36,870
Do you have a long-sleeved shirt
or something I could borrow?

1086
01:09:36,871 --> 01:09:40,516
I can't go out like this.

1087
01:10:32,402 --> 01:10:33,361
Shh!

1088
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:35,183
Shh!

1089
01:10:35,184 --> 01:10:37,868
<i>Baby bird.</i>

1090
01:10:37,869 --> 01:10:41,706
They're sleeping.

1091
01:10:51,776 --> 01:10:55,515
How was work today?

1092
01:10:55,516 --> 01:10:57,050
How'd you get in here?

1093
01:10:57,051 --> 01:10:59,160
I'm the one
who asks the questions.

1094
01:10:59,161 --> 01:11:00,407
<i>I don't answer.</i>

1095
01:11:00,408 --> 01:11:02,804
Fuck me, snoopy.

1096
01:11:02,805 --> 01:11:05,683
<i>You got to give me a break.</i>

1097
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,177
You look terrible.

1098
01:11:15,178 --> 01:11:16,178
Yeah.

1099
01:11:21,412 --> 01:11:23,138
What's going on?

1100
01:11:26,687 --> 01:11:28,893
I'm going to tell you the truth.

1101
01:11:34,167 --> 01:11:36,086
I'm in trouble.

1102
01:11:41,648 --> 01:11:43,949
I'm dirty.

1103
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:45,964
You want to get clean?

1104
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:50,856
You want inpatient?

1105
01:11:50,951 --> 01:11:52,773
No, I want outpatient.
Or prison.

1106
01:11:52,774 --> 01:11:55,939
No, because
I have to keep this job.

1107
01:11:56,994 --> 01:11:58,623
This job is the only thing
that I haven't...

1108
01:11:58,624 --> 01:12:00,062
Please, please,
let me keep this job.

1109
01:12:00,063 --> 01:12:01,118
It's inpatient or prison.

1110
01:12:02,748 --> 01:12:04,378
Hello.

1111
01:12:04,379 --> 01:12:05,720
Yeah, I got my PO here.

1112
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:07,926
Can I call you back?

1113
01:12:07,927 --> 01:12:10,804
Please, please, please,
please, please.

1114
01:12:10,805 --> 01:12:12,626
I lost my daughter. I lost her.

1115
01:12:12,627 --> 01:12:14,736
I don't know... there's no
other way I can get her back.

1116
01:12:14,737 --> 01:12:17,229
Inpatient or prison;
Your choice.

1117
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:20,011
Ugh!

1118
01:12:20,012 --> 01:12:21,066
You know, I don't get you.

1119
01:12:21,067 --> 01:12:22,121
You want to get clean.

1120
01:12:22,122 --> 01:12:23,272
You don't want to do the work.

1121
01:12:23,273 --> 01:12:24,518
You want your daughter,

1122
01:12:24,519 --> 01:12:29,027
but you don't want
to do the work.

1123
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,630
I wish it could be
some other way,

1124
01:12:33,631 --> 01:12:34,685
but at this point,

1125
01:12:34,686 --> 01:12:39,288
you do not qualify
for outpatient.

1126
01:12:39,289 --> 01:12:41,302
Take the weekend.

1127
01:12:41,303 --> 01:12:43,029
Say good-bye to your family.

1128
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:45,043
Report to me Monday morning
at 8:00 a. M. ,

1129
01:12:45,044 --> 01:12:46,673
and I will take you down.

1130
01:12:46,674 --> 01:12:49,742
If I don't see you,
I will issue a warrant

1131
01:12:49,743 --> 01:12:51,662
for your arrest.

1132
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:15,350
<i>You're probably not
going to believe this,</i>

1133
01:13:15,351 --> 01:13:17,845
<i>but I think about you
all the time.</i>

1134
01:13:19,571 --> 01:13:21,488
You're my sister.

1135
01:13:21,489 --> 01:13:23,310
I never forgot you.

1136
01:13:23,311 --> 01:13:29,832
You snaked me
with that bitch, Bobby.

1137
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:31,463
I can't trust you.

1138
01:13:31,464 --> 01:13:35,299
I want you to get to know
your daughter, Sherry.

1139
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,546
I really do.

1140
01:13:36,547 --> 01:13:38,560
<i>But you got to put yourself
in our shoes.</i>

1141
01:13:38,561 --> 01:13:40,670
<i>Lynette loves that little girl</i>

1142
01:13:40,671 --> 01:13:42,684
like she was her own,
and to tell you the truth,

1143
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:45,946
<i>I do too.</i>

1144
01:13:47,576 --> 01:13:48,576
<i>Leave mine alone?</i>

1145
01:13:49,398 --> 01:13:51,603
We've been taking care of her.

1146
01:13:51,604 --> 01:13:53,330
You think that's easy?

1147
01:13:53,331 --> 01:13:55,440
<i>And we are going
to have our own kid,</i>

1148
01:13:55,441 --> 01:13:56,974
<i>maybe even two,</i>

1149
01:13:56,975 --> 01:13:58,605
but we've been taking care
of Alexis

1150
01:13:58,606 --> 01:14:00,139
<i>because of you, remember?</i>

1151
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:04,359
I know. I know. I fucked up.

1152
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,854
I always fuck up.

1153
01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:17,786
I know what you've been through.

1154
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:19,705
Don't think I don't know
what you've been through.

1155
01:14:19,706 --> 01:14:22,678
What's that mean?

1156
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:23,925
It means I'm on your side.

1157
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:25,652
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

1158
01:14:25,748 --> 01:14:29,104
<i>It means I'm on your side, okay?</i>

1159
01:14:29,105 --> 01:14:30,543
<i>I'm on your fucking side.</i>

1160
01:14:36,873 --> 01:14:39,462
So will you let me
take her out alone,

1161
01:14:39,463 --> 01:14:42,723
<i>just me and her,</i>

1162
01:14:42,724 --> 01:14:44,642
so she's not
scared of me anymore?

1163
01:14:49,437 --> 01:14:51,164
<i>Okay.</i>

1164
01:14:52,698 --> 01:14:54,711
Okay, but no sleepovers, okay?

1165
01:14:54,712 --> 01:14:59,315
<i>One step at a time, okay?</i>

1166
01:14:59,316 --> 01:15:00,753
You love me?

1167
01:15:00,754 --> 01:15:03,248
Yes, I love you.

1168
01:15:03,344 --> 01:15:06,029
<i>I know.</i>

1169
01:15:50,435 --> 01:15:51,777
<i>No!</i>

1170
01:15:51,778 --> 01:15:53,025
<i>Alexis.</i>

1171
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,244
Oh, hi.

1172
01:15:57,245 --> 01:15:58,245
<i>Hey.</i>

1173
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:01,176
Hi.

1174
01:16:01,177 --> 01:16:02,806
Alexis, go put on your shoes.

1175
01:16:02,807 --> 01:16:04,053
Sherry's here to take you.

1176
01:16:04,054 --> 01:16:05,492
I'll go get her ready.

1177
01:16:05,493 --> 01:16:07,218
I hope you're happy,

1178
01:16:07,219 --> 01:16:09,232
because nobody else is.

1179
01:16:09,233 --> 01:16:11,822
Excuse me.

1180
01:16:11,823 --> 01:16:13,644
Come on,
put your shoesies on, okay?

1181
01:16:13,645 --> 01:16:15,946
<i>And you should like...</i>

1182
01:16:15,947 --> 01:16:19,111
Hey, Lexi.

1183
01:16:19,112 --> 01:16:20,167
<i>What is it, baby?</i>

1184
01:16:20,263 --> 01:16:21,604
<i>I don't want to go, Bobby.</i>

1185
01:16:21,605 --> 01:16:22,851
<i>It's okay, sweetie.</i>

1186
01:16:22,852 --> 01:16:24,673
You're going to have a fun day
with your mother.

1187
01:16:24,674 --> 01:16:26,879
Why, baby? You scared?

1188
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,318
You can tell Mama.

1189
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:31,771
Let's pack her green shirt too,
just in case she gets dirty.

1190
01:16:31,772 --> 01:16:33,305
Okay.

1191
01:16:33,306 --> 01:16:34,456
I got it.

1192
01:16:35,992 --> 01:16:37,717
<i>Alexis, let's put
your backpack on.</i>

1193
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:39,635
<i>Come on, sweetie, please.</i>

1194
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:40,786
I don't want to go, Bobby.

1195
01:16:40,787 --> 01:16:42,992
Sweetie, come on;
It's going to be fun.

1196
01:16:42,993 --> 01:16:44,526
Here, I'll carry you out, okay?

1197
01:16:44,527 --> 01:16:45,965
<i>Don't forget this.</i>

1198
01:16:45,966 --> 01:16:47,020
You look so pretty in this.

1199
01:16:47,021 --> 01:16:48,650
<i>Oh, what a big girl.</i>

1200
01:16:48,651 --> 01:16:49,897
Come here; Let me
put this on you.

1201
01:16:49,898 --> 01:16:52,487
Keep your hair out of your face.

1202
01:16:52,488 --> 01:16:53,638
<i>I'll see you later, okay,</i>

1203
01:16:53,639 --> 01:16:56,035
<i>and make some cheeseburgers
for supper, okay?</i>

1204
01:16:56,036 --> 01:16:57,379
<i>Okay, have fun.</i>

1205
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:02,653
<i>Bye, Lyn.</i>

1206
01:17:02,654 --> 01:17:06,585
Okay.

1207
01:17:06,586 --> 01:17:08,791
You're gonna have
a fun day, okay?

1208
01:17:08,792 --> 01:17:13,107
Remember what I told you?

1209
01:17:13,108 --> 01:17:16,560
You're gonna have fun.

1210
01:17:16,561 --> 01:17:19,725
Can you get the door?

1211
01:17:19,726 --> 01:17:24,424
It's going to be a good time;
I promise, okay?

1212
01:17:24,425 --> 01:17:25,672
Come on, let go.

1213
01:17:27,303 --> 01:17:28,357
Let go, baby.

1214
01:17:28,358 --> 01:17:29,699
Okay.

1215
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,522
No, no, no, no,
put it in the front seat.

1216
01:17:31,523 --> 01:17:33,536
Sherry, it needs to go
in the back; That's the law.

1217
01:17:33,537 --> 01:17:34,496
Always in the back, okay?

1218
01:17:34,497 --> 01:17:36,797
Come here, sweetie.

1219
01:17:36,798 --> 01:17:38,236
Come on, please.

1220
01:17:38,332 --> 01:17:39,771
Come on. Here we go.

1221
01:17:41,689 --> 01:17:44,182
Put your legs down.

1222
01:17:44,183 --> 01:17:46,004
Just like our car.

1223
01:17:46,005 --> 01:17:47,922
I don't want to go, Bobby.

1224
01:17:47,923 --> 01:17:49,456
Okay, but see, this is the day

1225
01:17:49,457 --> 01:17:51,280
that you get to know Sherry
better, okay?

1226
01:17:52,814 --> 01:17:53,773
<i>Okay?</i>

1227
01:17:53,774 --> 01:17:54,827
Okay.

1228
01:17:54,828 --> 01:17:55,882
<i>I don't want to go.</i>

1229
01:17:55,883 --> 01:17:57,033
<i>You don't want to go?</i>

1230
01:17:57,034 --> 01:17:58,184
<i>Well, listen to me.</i>

1231
01:17:58,185 --> 01:18:00,006
<i>You're going to have fun, okay?</i>

1232
01:18:00,007 --> 01:18:01,253
<i>I promise.</i>

1233
01:18:01,254 --> 01:18:02,596
Okay.

1234
01:18:02,597 --> 01:18:05,665
<i>What time are you
going to have her back?</i>

1235
01:18:05,666 --> 01:18:07,391
Um...

1236
01:18:07,392 --> 01:18:09,022
I don't know, 4:00 or something.

1237
01:18:09,023 --> 01:18:10,748
Okay, 4:00.

1238
01:18:10,749 --> 01:18:12,955
<i>Hey. You okay, baby?</i>

1239
01:18:14,394 --> 01:18:15,353
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1240
01:18:15,354 --> 01:18:16,504
<i>She's okay.</i>

1241
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,421
She'll be...
She'll be all right.

1242
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:24,751
<i>Alexis, it's going to be okay.</i>

1243
01:18:24,752 --> 01:18:28,587
<i>You're going to have
a fun day, okay?</i>

1244
01:18:28,588 --> 01:18:30,697
You're going to have
a good time.

1245
01:18:30,698 --> 01:18:32,423
Have fun with her, okay?

1246
01:18:32,424 --> 01:18:34,534
Thanks.

1247
01:19:57,783 --> 01:19:59,412
I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

1248
01:19:59,413 --> 01:20:00,373
Yeah.

1249
01:20:00,374 --> 01:20:02,098
You want junk food?

1250
01:20:02,099 --> 01:20:03,728
Yes. Yes.

1251
01:20:03,729 --> 01:20:04,783
I'm starving.

1252
01:20:04,784 --> 01:20:06,797
Me too.

1253
01:20:06,798 --> 01:20:08,044
You want to push it?

1254
01:20:08,045 --> 01:20:10,058
I want chicken nuggets.

1255
01:20:10,059 --> 01:20:11,113
Okay.

1256
01:20:11,114 --> 01:20:12,937
<i>And I want to eat...</i>

1257
01:20:13,033 --> 01:20:14,950
<i>french fries.</i>

1258
01:20:14,951 --> 01:20:16,868
I want french fries too.

1259
01:20:16,869 --> 01:20:18,211
And...

1260
01:20:18,212 --> 01:20:20,992
So when are we going to get
to miniature golf?

1261
01:20:20,993 --> 01:20:23,677
Soon.

1262
01:20:23,678 --> 01:20:25,691
Really soon.

1263
01:20:25,692 --> 01:20:29,336
I've never did
miniature golf before.

1264
01:20:29,337 --> 01:20:30,583
You never did?

1265
01:20:30,584 --> 01:20:31,925
Uh-uh, never.

1266
01:20:31,926 --> 01:20:34,611
That's a shame.

1267
01:20:34,612 --> 01:20:37,488
Did you ever go to Florida?

1268
01:20:37,489 --> 01:20:38,448
Florida?

1269
01:20:38,449 --> 01:20:40,174
Yeah.

1270
01:20:40,175 --> 01:20:41,708
No.

1271
01:20:41,709 --> 01:20:43,435
Me neither.

1272
01:20:43,436 --> 01:20:45,353
You want to go?

1273
01:20:45,354 --> 01:20:48,230
Lyn and Bobby went,

1274
01:20:48,231 --> 01:20:50,436
and I stayed at Grandma Mary's.

1275
01:20:50,437 --> 01:20:51,588
Hmm.

1276
01:20:51,684 --> 01:20:57,629
She... she lets me stay up late
and watch late movies...

1277
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:59,355
This thing looks like it hurts.

1278
01:20:59,356 --> 01:21:03,575
And has a little dog
that's named Isabella.

1279
01:21:03,576 --> 01:21:04,918
It's mean?

1280
01:21:04,919 --> 01:21:08,371
No, it's named Isabella,
but it's a nice dog.

1281
01:21:08,372 --> 01:21:10,289
It's a little French bulldog.

1282
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:15,468
So do you want to go to Florida?

1283
01:21:15,469 --> 01:21:17,098
Mommy?

1284
01:21:17,099 --> 01:21:18,825
Yes, my love?

1285
01:21:18,826 --> 01:21:20,551
I have to go to the bathroom.

1286
01:21:20,552 --> 01:21:22,469
You do?

1287
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:25,060
Okay, let's go. One more.

1288
01:21:30,718 --> 01:21:34,554
<i>Come on. Damn it.</i>

1289
01:21:34,555 --> 01:21:35,514
<i>Go in the bathroom.</i>

1290
01:21:35,515 --> 01:21:37,047
Jesus Christ.

1291
01:21:37,048 --> 01:21:39,637
You like embarrassing me
like that?

1292
01:21:39,638 --> 01:21:41,555
Do you?

1293
01:21:41,556 --> 01:21:43,377
Why don't you answer me?

1294
01:21:43,378 --> 01:21:46,446
You never listen to me,
and you never answer me.

1295
01:21:46,447 --> 01:21:47,693
Look at me when I talk to you.

1296
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:48,844
You want me to leave you here?

1297
01:21:48,845 --> 01:21:49,899
Is that what you want?

1298
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,530
You're lucky
that I'm here with my girl,

1299
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:53,064
or I'd beat the living shit
out of you,

1300
01:21:53,065 --> 01:21:54,120
you fucking bully!

1301
01:21:58,532 --> 01:22:00,737
Lexis?

1302
01:22:00,738 --> 01:22:05,436
Lexis, I'm sorry.

1303
01:22:05,437 --> 01:22:07,067
Lexi, Lexi.

1304
01:22:07,068 --> 01:22:09,082
Hey, baby.

1305
01:22:09,178 --> 01:22:10,903
Alexis, what are you doing?

1306
01:22:10,904 --> 01:22:13,397
Did you go to the bathroom?

1307
01:22:13,398 --> 01:22:15,315
Lexi, open up the door.

1308
01:22:15,316 --> 01:22:17,425
Open up the door.

1309
01:22:18,769 --> 01:22:21,070
Come here. What is it?

1310
01:22:22,029 --> 01:22:23,660
Oh, what happened?

1311
01:22:26,921 --> 01:22:28,167
It's okay.

1312
01:22:28,168 --> 01:22:30,372
I'm scared, Sherry.

1313
01:22:30,373 --> 01:22:31,373
It's okay.

1314
01:22:39,773 --> 01:22:41,114
All right.

1315
01:22:41,115 --> 01:22:43,416
I'm just gonna get the keys.

1316
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:45,239
Ugh, fuck.

1317
01:22:49,555 --> 01:22:52,337
Let's get these wet pants
off you.

1318
01:22:54,447 --> 01:22:57,515
Come on, you got to help me
get your shoes off.

1319
01:22:57,516 --> 01:22:59,625
Oh... come on. Jesus.

1320
01:22:59,626 --> 01:23:03,750
Okay, and you do the other one.

1321
01:23:06,531 --> 01:23:08,929
Fuck me.

1322
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:17,368
<i>Okay, look what I got.</i>

1323
01:23:17,369 --> 01:23:18,614
<i>Oh...</i>

1324
01:23:18,615 --> 01:23:19,765
What's that?

1325
01:23:19,766 --> 01:23:22,547
Oh, look at this.

1326
01:23:22,548 --> 01:23:24,273
Come on, baby.

1327
01:23:24,274 --> 01:23:25,713
I'm trying.

1328
01:23:25,809 --> 01:23:27,534
Come here.

1329
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:30,219
Okay,
take your panties off, Lex.

1330
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:32,138
Sherry, close the door.

1331
01:23:32,139 --> 01:23:33,769
Hey, you got to help me.

1332
01:23:36,359 --> 01:23:37,359
All right.

1333
01:23:39,619 --> 01:23:40,579
Come on, left foot.

1334
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:42,208
Left foot.

1335
01:23:42,209 --> 01:23:44,703
Do you even love me?

1336
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:54,772
Tell me you love me.

1337
01:23:54,773 --> 01:23:55,923
I love you.

1338
01:23:55,924 --> 01:23:59,951
Tell me, "I love you, Mommy. "

1339
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:04,652
I love you, Mommy.

1340
01:24:38,028 --> 01:24:39,850
Come on.

1341
01:25:13,706 --> 01:25:15,528
You know what?

1342
01:25:18,693 --> 01:25:23,584
I used to get scared too...

1343
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,598
all the time.

1344
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:54,178
Watch your step, honey.

1345
01:25:54,179 --> 01:25:55,521
Why don't you go
say hi to Lynnie?

1346
01:25:55,522 --> 01:25:56,864
She's worried about you.

1347
01:25:56,865 --> 01:26:00,413
Lyn. Come here, Lyn.
I got to tell you something.

1348
01:26:04,633 --> 01:26:06,168
Did you guys have fun?

1349
01:26:07,702 --> 01:26:10,003
Yeah.

1350
01:26:10,004 --> 01:26:12,881
Thanks for calling.

1351
01:26:18,923 --> 01:26:20,937
You know what, Bob?

1352
01:26:20,938 --> 01:26:22,760
What?

1353
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:31,678
I never asked you this
the whole time that I was away.

1354
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:33,596
I never asked you...

1355
01:26:33,597 --> 01:26:35,420
Asked me what, Sherry?

1356
01:26:43,284 --> 01:26:49,517
Could you help me
take care of my daughter?

1357
01:26:49,518 --> 01:26:53,355
I can't do it by myself.

1358
01:26:54,601 --> 01:26:55,751
Of course I can.

1359
01:26:55,752 --> 01:26:57,478
What do you think
I've been doing?

1360
01:26:57,479 --> 01:26:59,876
I know, but I never asked you.

1361
01:27:06,494 --> 01:27:07,453
Come here.

1362
01:27:07,454 --> 01:27:09,563
Yes.

1363
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:18,674
You're gonna be okay.

1364
01:27:24,045 --> 01:27:25,675
You want to come inside?

1365
01:27:25,676 --> 01:27:28,744
No.

1366
01:27:28,745 --> 01:27:30,374
You think you were worried
about Lexi.

1367
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:33,636
Dean's probably waiting
by the window for his baby.

1368
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:40,350
Thanks.
