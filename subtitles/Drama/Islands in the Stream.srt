1
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,773
Here comes Richard.

2
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,336
All right, you there, stand aside.
Stand aside.

3
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,947
Let us through. Can't you see
this man is gravely injured?

4
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,378
Out of the way.

5
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:42,043
I warned Captain Ralph if he continues
running these foreign refugees,

6
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,950
someone will be shot.

7
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,125
Hey, hey. You, you, you. Hey.

8
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,987
This man has been shot.

9
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,395
Hey, Tom.

10
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,464
Tom, you should've been
with me last night.

11
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,502
It was a hell of a night.

12
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,572
You sure look like hell.
Who shot you up?

13
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:06,074
Who else?
The goddamn Cuban coast guard.

14
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,404
Getting so as a man cannot
make a decent living

15
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,674
without somebody
taking a shot at him.

16
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,679
Hey, how about a drink?

17
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:15,513
No, not now. I'll see you later.

18
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,227
Joseph.

19
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,758
Good morning, Tom.

20
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,453
- Thought you was working today.
- Where's Eddy?

21
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,725
- Working on his eye.
- What happened to his eye?

22
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,502
Somebody balled his fist in it.

23
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,272
Goddamn it, don't come in here.

24
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,010
Oh, it's you.

25
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,206
What are you doing here?
You've never quit this early.

26
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,884
What are you so jumpy about?

27
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,553
Come on back and have a look.

28
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,120
What did you do to your mouth?

29
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,292
Oh, some kind of trouble last night.

30
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,622
There. Ain't that a beauty.

31
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,698
It comes with four ammo clips
and 200 rounds.

32
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:02,959
Where'd you get it?

33
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:06,366
You know the tuna boat that was in
yesterday? First mate had it.

34
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,632
- What'd you do, fight him for it?
- No, I beat him at poker.

35
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,139
Fight came afterwards.

36
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,770
Well, keep that locked up.

37
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,740
Don't worry. As long as the kids
are here, it'll be locked.

38
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,943
Eddy,

39
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,622
why do you get into fights?

40
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,188
Oh, it's truth and right, Tom.

41
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,086
I keep hoping
that truth and right will win,

42
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,228
but then somebody comes along
and knocks truth and right on the ass.

43
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,898
- You hurt?
- No, I hurt, but I ain't hurt.

44
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,067
Hell, they were only trying to prove
that I was wrong.

45
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,160
About what?

46
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:39,963
Damned if I can remember.

47
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,337
How do you think the boys
will take seeing us, Tom?

48
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,538
- I don't know.
- I've got everything ready.

49
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:53,014
I put two extra cases of Coca-Cola
onboard this morning.

50
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,650
Be nice to have the boys again,
won't it?

51
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,686
After four years?

52
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,518
Eddy, there won't be nothing
like it since the big fire.

53
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,093
I rank it right along
with the Second Coming.

54
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,257
- Oh, yeah.
- You gonna have one at Mr. Bobby's?

55
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,433
Yeah.

56
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,830
You mind if I go along for one?
My liver's giving me hell this morning.

57
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,834
You still got a liver?

58
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,473
I had the last time I looked.
I don't wanna get the shakes.

59
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:16,869
Go home and go to bed, Eddy.

60
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,007
Tom, it is the queen mother's birthday.
I mean, 87 today

61
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,182
and still a wonderful woman.
I mean, a bit on the stiff side for me,

62
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,214
but still a wonderful piece, by God.

63
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,318
Go home, Eddy.

64
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,833
Beautiful.

65
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,624
Dead. You're a hell of a shooter,
Thomas.

66
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,490
- Joseph, break out that Very pistol.
- Got it.

67
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:15,599
Tom, give us a toast to the queen,
an eloquent one.

68
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,831
All right.

69
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,769
Gentlemen and lady...

70
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,100
...the queen mother.

71
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,146
I do not think
she would like this island,

72
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,214
and I'm not sure that she would
do very well here,

73
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,944
but, gentlemen and lady,

74
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,416
the queen,

75
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,782
God bless her.

76
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,292
Careful out there, damn it!

77
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,623
Take it easy, Tom. Those things
could hurt people.

78
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,234
The hell with take it easy. Watch me
bag the commissioner's house.

79
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,530
- You'll burn it.
- If he burns it, I'll pay for it.

80
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,366
Try it, Tom, try a red one.

81
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,135
Here, just get a red one,
burn the son of a bitch.

82
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,869
- Burn him, what do you say?
- Burn him, burn him.

83
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,079
Take it easy, Tom.
We don't have to play rough.

84
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,053
This is my night, mine
and the queen mother's,

85
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,625
so get out of my way,
and watch me nail Brown's dock.

86
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,025
- He's got gas on it.
- Not for long.

87
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,437
You did it, Tom.

88
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,764
How about the commissioner, Tom.
Try a green one.

89
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,238
- He is ashes now.
- Tom.

90
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,476
Tom.

91
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,746
Oh, Jesus.

92
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,080
You did it, you son of a bitch.
You did it.

93
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,416
Well, you wait till you see this one.

94
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,991
You keep your good eye
on this one now, Willy.

95
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,971
That was a hell of a shot, Tom.

96
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,347
Now for Brown's gas.

97
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,349
Well, you certainly cooled him.

98
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,688
Yeah, he needed cooling off.

99
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,964
Tom, you're drunk, bad drunk.

100
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,162
Tom, where you going?

101
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,397
- Tom.
- Thomas.

102
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,136
Tom?

103
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,470
Come on back, Thomas.

104
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,508
Tom.

105
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,041
What's the matter with him?

106
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,617
His kids are coming tomorrow.

107
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,586
Where's Eddy?

108
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,297
Shouldn't he be bringing the car by?

109
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,031
Shouldn't we be getting down
to the dock pretty soon?

110
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,965
You can walk down.
I'm not gonna meet the plane.

111
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,298
- You're kidding me, ain't you?
- No.

112
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,040
You haven't seen those babies
in four years.

113
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,075
I gotta work.

114
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,541
What are you doing?
What the hell's going on?

115
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,104
You wanna say hello to your kids?

116
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,948
They didn't wanna interrupt
you working,

117
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,049
so they stayed in the car.

118
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,422
Yeah.

119
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,593
What the hell.

120
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,191
That's what I say, Tom. What the hell.

121
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,246
Well, you might as well come in,
get out of the rain.

122
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,015
Damn it, Papa.

123
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,222
Papa.

124
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,366
Come on, Andrew.

125
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,559
Papa.

126
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,529
Papa.

127
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,080
Hello, Davy.

128
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:04,843
Gotcha.

129
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,619
Did you draw that, Papa?

130
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,295
That's my mother.

131
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,524
She sure is pretty.

132
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,496
How come you didn't
draw one of our mom?

133
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,638
Well, your mom...

134
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,909
I didn't work very much
when I was with your mom.

135
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,476
- You still paint, don't you?
- No.

136
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,615
Well, how come?

137
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,580
I wanted to try something new
when I came to this island.

138
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,379
You did that in Paris, didn't you?

139
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,853
- Yes, you remember Paris, Tom?
- Sure.

140
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,121
Remember how we used to shoot
the pigeons with a slingshot?

141
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,725
Why'd you do that?

142
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,022
We ate them.

143
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,662
Going to the café with Mother because
it was so cold in the apartment,

144
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,361
and the three of us sitting
in the corner by one of those...

145
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,201
- What do you call them?
- Braziers.

146
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,477
I thought that was what ladies wore.

147
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,372
Well, what do I know?

148
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,943
- Do I have to sit here?
- What's the matter, Davy?

149
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,983
- I've got a headache.
- Why don't you lay down.

150
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,620
- I'll get an aspirin.
- I'm all right.

151
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,484
- Go lay down if you don't feel well.
- I'm all right.

152
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,155
He's always like that.

153
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:34,059
Mom says he's going
through P.U. Birdy.

154
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,099
- What's that?
- You know, P.U. Birdy.

155
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,237
Like when you're 14.

156
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,539
<i>- Bring you the nightly broadcast of
Elmer Davis and the News.</i>

157
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,872
<i>Hitler, proclaiming that
the triumph over France</i>

158
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,106
<i>was the most glorious
victory of all time,</i>

159
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,217
<i>ordered a ten-day celebration
in Germany.</i>

160
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,944
It doesn't make any sense,
me and Andy being here.

161
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,349
What kind of sense is that?

162
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,524
He doesn't care about us.

163
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,022
Oh, come on.

164
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,660
<i>- German and Polish refugees...
- He's our father, isn't he?</i>

165
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:07,263
- He's your father. It's different with us.
- Different?

166
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,996
What do you remember
about him, huh?

167
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,693
- Lots of things.
- Did he ever hit your mother?

168
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,965
- No.
- Well, he hit ours.

169
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,166
- I remember.
- So do I.

170
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,402
Boy, the fights they had...

171
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:21,943
You were too little to remember it.

172
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,479
Well, I remember Mom crying a lot.

173
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,310
I remember the night that he hit her,

174
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,715
and she screamed,
and how scared we were.

175
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,152
I remember all that, all right.

176
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,555
He was mean then.
He's nicer now, don't you think?

177
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,457
He hasn't changed.
Still a mean bastard.

178
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,154
That's what Mom always says.

179
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,627
Look, Dave, don't you know by now

180
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,395
that when two people get married,
they fight a lot?

181
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,867
Now, he just couldn't have done
anything that bad.

182
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,267
You weren't there.

183
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,204
You don't know him
like me and Andy know him.

184
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,605
Damn it, Davy, give him a chance,
will you?

185
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,474
Who did he ever give a chance?
Besides you.

186
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,843
Davy, you're a bastard sometimes.

187
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,914
Just because you're bigger,
don't call me names.

188
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,918
- Knock it off, Andy.
- You aren't my boss.

189
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,524
- I'm your older brother.
- Half brother.

190
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,023
Half-assed.

191
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,229
- Oh, now you're gonna get it.
- Hey.

192
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,523
- All right.
- Don't.

193
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,109
Hey.

194
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,046
What's going on here?

195
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,719
Well, we were...

196
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,721
Why, you little...

197
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,458
It's all right, Davy.

198
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,125
It's all right.

199
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,374
Jesus Christ, here he comes.

200
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,808
Tom. Tom! Jesus, what a
son of a bitching hammerhead.

201
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,846
How the hell did that thing
get inside the reef?

202
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,171
What's going on? Who's shooting?

203
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,989
Oh, God. Tommy! Tommy!

204
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,389
Throw the fish, Tommy!

205
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,359
Throw it!

206
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,377
Would you like me
to stay down here with you

207
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,054
so you won't have to drink alone?

208
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,155
No, Andy.

209
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:36,250
You aren't getting mixed up
in anything, are you?

210
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,625
I don't have to drink.

211
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:42,089
I don't have to do anything
except earn my living.

212
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,196
I just feel good, Andy.

213
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,666
Did you see me shoot him true?

214
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:50,074
Eddy, it was the greatest thing
I ever saw.

215
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,713
I only asked if you wanted me to stay
so you wouldn't be lonesome.

216
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,683
I've never been lonesome
in my life, Andy.

217
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:04,845
I'm just happy. What I've got here
makes me happier.

218
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,705
Papa,

219
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,068
is Eddy a rummy?

220
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,280
The only reason I ask is
because when I was down below,

221
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:34,976
I saw him take eight drinks from that
bottle since we started in.

222
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,348
Saw him shoot that shark, didn't you?

223
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:38,989
Boy, did I.

224
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,819
That's not the way rummies shoot.

225
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,642
Wonder why David's afraid of the dark.

226
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,213
Don't know. Weren't you?

227
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,583
I don't think so.

228
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,285
I was always afraid of dying.

229
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,666
- You ain't working tomorrow, are you?
- No.

230
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,638
Good. Then we can break training
and drink these.

231
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,244
After today, I think we need it.

232
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,916
Thank you for today.

233
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,285
Not at all.

234
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,962
Anybody that couldn't hit that
hammerhead with one of those things

235
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,826
ought to throw the bloody thing away
before he got into trouble with it.

236
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,627
You sure know how to shoot it.

237
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,303
At that range, no one could miss.

238
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:09,868
I did.

239
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,108
You were shooting awfully
close to him, Tom.

240
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,780
Did everything but hit it.

241
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,048
I panicked.

242
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,188
Simple as that.

243
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,955
- What's that?
- Papa.

244
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,999
God almighty.

245
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,535
What is it?

246
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,803
It's a freighter that's been torpedoed,
Andy.

247
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:51,213
You mean the Krauts
are right out there? Really?

248
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,036
Stay back.

249
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,682
Is he dead?

250
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,115
Let's go see.

251
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,691
I've never seen
a real dead person before.

252
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,759
You heard your father.

253
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,661
Boys, go back to the house.

254
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,264
Come on.

255
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,401
Do we have to?

256
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,504
Come on.

257
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,315
Come on.

258
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,127
Tom, will the boys go to this war?

259
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,200
Tommy will be 19 next month.

260
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,069
I will pray for a short war.

261
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,646
Do it often.

262
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,563
Why did you come
to a place like this,

263
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:31,105
a British island way the hell away
from everything?

264
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,402
I used to come here fishing
in the old days. I like it.

265
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,239
The people here leave you alone.

266
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,940
The only thing I don't like about it
is not seeing you kids.

267
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:45,450
You still love Mother, don't you?

268
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,658
I don't think I've ever truly loved
anyone else.

269
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,193
Then how come you got divorced?

270
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,322
Your mother and I were very poor,
very young,

271
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,899
for a long time, very, very happy,

272
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,298
but it went bad for us.

273
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,338
With Dave and Andy's mother,
we always had money.

274
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,338
She needed it,
like the apartment in New York

275
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,637
and the house in Palm Beach
and all the parties and friends she had.

276
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,273
But didn't she need you?

277
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,075
Not really.

278
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:17,050
I don't think she ever
really did need me.

279
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,019
Your mother did, though,
as much as I needed her.

280
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,193
Then how come you got a divorce
from each other?

281
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,692
I don't know, we...

282
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,627
Maybe we loved too much,
demanded too much.

283
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,960
We wore it all out.

284
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,034
Hell, I blew it.

285
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,697
But you still love her.

286
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:39,670
Yeah, I still love her.

287
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,544
Hello, Tom.

288
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,951
- Lil, how are you?
- Wonderful.

289
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,558
This your son?

290
00:29:58,229 --> 00:29:59,662
Yes.

291
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:00,853
Tommy, Lil.

292
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,894
Pleased to meet you.

293
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,997
I think he's beautiful.

294
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,242
- Who's she?
- Friend.

295
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,550
She doesn't give it away free,
though.

296
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:24,385
That kind of friend.

297
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,226
Let's see if we've done any good
with this thing, huh?

298
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,827
- Can I try?
- Sure.

299
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,849
Dad, who are those people?

300
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,949
Refugees from Europe.

301
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,783
Jews, mostly.

302
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,625
They come in
from Lisbon and Istanbul.

303
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:03,919
How they got there
is anybody's guess.

304
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,119
They work their way
through these islands

305
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,095
and try to get boats
to the States or Cuba.

306
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,460
Who takes them across from here?

307
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,037
Now? Only Captain Ralph.

308
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:18,900
What happened to the others?

309
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,010
Caught or sunk.

310
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,812
They sure look pitiful.

311
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,710
They're the lucky ones.

312
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,684
They got here.

313
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,948
- Finished?
- Yeah.

314
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,155
Holy jeez. Andy.

315
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,972
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi. You finished?

316
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,937
- All done. Wanna see it?
- Okay.

317
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,475
Put that down, Tom.

318
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,973
- Where's Eddy?
- Eddy?

319
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,319
- Well, you see, he's...
- I'm here.

320
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,592
Well, I'll be a sad son of a bitch.

321
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,437
Dad?

322
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,169
Yeah, Andy, what is it?

323
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,412
- I'm 10 now, you know.
- Sure.

324
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,674
Is 10 too old to kiss
your father good night?

325
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,948
I don't think so, Andy.

326
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,487
Good night, Dad.

327
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,683
Good night, son.

328
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,175
Okay.

329
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,141
Try now.

330
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,582
Well, we'll have to send
to Miami for a new pump.

331
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,115
You mean we can't use it?

332
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,584
Nope.

333
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,418
Well, how are we gonna
go to the bathroom?

334
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:49,820
Over the side.

335
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,788
Over the side? How?

336
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,795
Carefully.

337
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,374
Fish!

338
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,447
Get that rod, Davy.

339
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:16,817
Sit down.

340
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,819
Put the butt in the socket
in the chair and keep it there.

341
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:24,961
Keep the drag off so you can
slack it to him when he hits.

342
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:30,195
If he hits with the drag on,
he can jerk you right overboard.

343
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,804
He took it.

344
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,707
The drag, damn it.

345
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,414
The drag.

346
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,885
Sorry, I forgot.

347
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,889
Listen, Davy,
a fish like this can kill you.

348
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,396
If you had the harness on,
it'd pull you right over the side.

349
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,034
Well, then what do I do now?

350
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,830
I think I'd hit him, Davy, now.

351
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,073
- Hit him again. Really put it to him.
- Caught it.

352
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,871
I think I've got it into him.

353
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,020
Holy Moses.

354
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,799
Ease up on the drag, Davy.

355
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,195
- He's gone.
- No, he's not.

356
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,499
Ease up on the drag, quick.

357
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,304
What's he gonna do?

358
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:54,280
He's gonna start his run now.
We'll chase him.

359
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,984
You okay?

360
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,378
What's happening now?

361
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,674
I don't dare ask anybody down there.

362
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,475
The fish is sounding.

363
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:03,984
It will just keep going down
until Davy stops him.

364
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,980
And Davy is gonna have
to try to get him up.

365
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,658
What can I do?

366
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,665
You hold it, Davy.

367
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,498
He'll get sick of it, then he'll come up.

368
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:26,206
My shoulders are killing me.

369
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,606
Rig the harness for us, will you?

370
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:32,647
Tie down the line
if the loops are too long.

371
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,622
Damn it! Why does he
have to keep sounding?

372
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,766
He'll come up, you'll see.

373
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,928
All of a sudden,
there won't be anything to it.

374
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,806
Wanna rinse your mouth out? Just...

375
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:04,209
Just swallow just a little, now,
and spit the rest out.

376
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,224
Over an hour and a half.

377
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,277
Well...

378
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,722
...what do you think, Joseph?

379
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,789
Will you stop worrying?

380
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,927
I can't help it.

381
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:54,222
I'm the one in the family
that always worries.

382
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,328
You don't know him like I do.

383
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,967
He'll let that fish kill him.

384
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,138
Just so he can show
Papa that he can take it.

385
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,465
Take her ahead just
a touch, Joseph.

386
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,662
Ahead just a touch.

387
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,771
He's sounding again, Davy.

388
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,639
He's right under the boat.
You gotta get to the stern.

389
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,839
Loosen up on the drag a little
so you can get the butt out.

390
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,057
I've...

391
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,631
I've seen a grown man,

392
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,964
strong, you know,
big shoulders, like a bull,

393
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:09,537
quit with half the work you put in
on this fish already.

394
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,934
Big guy.

395
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,406
Trained for it.
Fished all the time.

396
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,806
I've got to stop him.

397
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,174
Son...

398
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,921
Your hands and your feet,
they don't mean a damn thing.

399
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:30,389
They hurt, and they look bad,
but they're all right.

400
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,954
That's the way a fisherman's hands
and feet are supposed to look, right?

401
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:36,360
It will toughen them up
for the next time.

402
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,899
The point is, are you all right?

403
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,665
You sure you don't want
me to take him?

404
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,907
Wouldn't be like quitting now.
It just makes sense, you know.

405
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,511
Am I doing anything wrong?

406
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:51,681
You're doing perfectly.

407
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,779
Then why do you want me
to quit on him?

408
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,188
Son...

409
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,523
...he's giving you an awful beating.
I don't want him to hurt you.

410
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,694
He's the one
with the hook in his mouth.

411
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,693
He isn't giving me a beating.
I'm giving him a beating.

412
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,627
The son of a bitch.

413
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,233
I don't care if he kills me.

414
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,426
Son of a bitch.

415
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,371
Save your wind.

416
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:19,975
And if you stay calm and quiet,
we'll stay with him forever.

417
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,174
How's the line, Tom?

418
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,575
I don't think there's 10 feet left.

419
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,424
He's stopped him.

420
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,927
Three hours.

421
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,218
This is where the fight really starts.

422
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:04,614
See if you can get some line
back on him.

423
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,126
Back on him, Joseph.

424
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,561
Get some line out of his belly.

425
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,898
He's come up from way down,
he's got a bellyful of line,

426
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,904
and you can get some of it.

427
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,114
Oh, no. He's going out again.

428
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:35,217
No, no, that's all right. That's supposed
to happen. He's on the outturn now.

429
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:38,513
He circled in toward you, and you got
line. Now he's taking it back again.

430
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,349
Try him again, Davy.

431
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:47,461
You've got him coming in.
Now, get on that line. Try him again.

432
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,197
This is the time, now.

433
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,100
He's really coming in.

434
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,332
Stay with him, Davy.

435
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,470
Steady.

436
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:04,410
There's the hook. You got him now.

437
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,742
Hang with it, Davy.

438
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:32,407
He's coming in just fine.

439
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:40,816
- You ready for him, Eddy?
- Sure.

440
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,883
You watch him, Tom.

441
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,447
Slack up on your drag.

442
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,230
Davy, he looks as big as a log.

443
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,873
- Can you reach him?
- Not yet.

444
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:08,074
Keep him coming.

445
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:09,973
Easy.

446
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,971
Easy.

447
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:17,883
- Can you reach him now?
- Not quite yet.

448
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,186
Easy.

449
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,316
Easy.

450
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:12,208
He really was as big as Eddy
said he was, wasn't he?

451
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,008
I'm sure of it.

452
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,611
I've never seen
a bigger fish, ever.

453
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,946
You know, it sounds crazy,

454
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,019
but in the worst parts...

455
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:29,683
...when I was the tiredest...

456
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,987
...I began to love him,

457
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:36,223
more than anything on earth.

458
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,635
I know.

459
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,402
I'm sorry we lost him.

460
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:50,038
I'm glad he got away.

461
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:54,848
You're a good boy, Davy.
And I'm proud of you.

462
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,385
God knows how much I love you.

463
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,682
Oh, Papa.

464
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:03,617
Papa.

465
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,507
Get any mail off the pilot boat?

466
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,979
Mail don't amount to
much of anything.

467
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:25,847
A couple with women's
writing on them.

468
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:30,075
One from New York and one
from Palm Beach. Pretty writing.

469
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:33,751
One from the gentleman who
sells your stuff in New York.

470
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,292
And a couple more unknown to me.

471
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,195
Would you like to
answer them for me?

472
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:42,825
Yes, sir, if that's what you want.

473
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:46,298
I'm educated way beyond my means.

474
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,861
Nice morning.

475
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:22,005
I've been thinking all night
about how I'm gonna miss all this.

476
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,109
Dad, you know, I've decided
what I'm going to do.

477
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:27,843
Yeah, what?

478
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:30,343
I'm going up to Canada
and join the RAF.

479
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:34,879
Sure.

480
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,417
I'm gonna be a fighter pilot.

481
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,453
You talk to your mother about this?

482
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:43,649
Just after graduation.

483
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,158
What did she have to say?

484
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:47,953
She was worried about
what you'd say.

485
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:54,298
You know how much fun
we've had this summer?

486
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:58,338
You know how much I wish we could
all be together, all of the time?

487
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:03,409
You know, that Dave
is some brother.

488
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:06,447
I was so proud of him with that fish.

489
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:10,350
Dad, I know you love him
the most. And that's right,

490
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,419
because he's the best of us.

491
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,818
Why do you say I love him the most?

492
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,822
You ought to.

493
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,658
I've loved you the longest.

494
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:28,794
Wanna go get some breakfast?

495
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:31,232
Not yet. I think I'll go
for a walk, okay?

496
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:32,931
Okay.

497
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,286
Thanks, Dad.

498
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,254
Okay, boys.

499
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,362
Well, guess we better get
on board, huh?

500
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,997
Guess we better.

501
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:36,162
We've had a swell time.

502
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,840
Goodbye, Papa.

503
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,358
You okay, Andrew?

504
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:04,065
You can't keep the plane
waiting all day, you know.

505
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:07,828
Papa, can't I stay with you?

506
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,966
I don't want you to be all alone.

507
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:14,501
Well,

508
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:18,747
be a good boy and take
good care of your brother. Okay?

509
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,877
Goodbye, son.

510
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,660
Goodbye, Eddy.

511
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:47,833
Goodbye.

512
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,578
Well, Tom.

513
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,052
Yeah.

514
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:58,754
I'll see Mother in New York
before I go.

515
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:01,287
Is there anything you want me
to tell her?

516
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,048
"Hello."

517
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:04,892
Right.

518
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,094
Good luck, kid.

519
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:23,138
Davy, it's from Papa.

520
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,081
Read it out loud.

521
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,520
"Dear boys,

522
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,020
it was good to get your letters.

523
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,892
Good to hear all is going well."

524
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,327
<i>So much has changed
since you were here.</i>

525
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:52,367
<i>The war still seems remote to us
on the island, but yet closer.</i>

526
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:55,567
<i>There are a few more refugees
coming through here now.</i>

527
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:57,998
<i>The Germans are sinking
a lot of ships</i>

528
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,733
<i>in the stream
between here and Florida.</i>

529
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,276
<i>Sometimes at night you
can see them burning.</i>

530
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,846
<i>Often two and three at a time.</i>

531
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:08,616
<i>There isn't enough navy,
British or American, around</i>

532
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,718
<i>to do anything about it.</i>

533
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:16,350
<i>Work has been progressing
steadily and well since you left.</i>

534
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,358
<i>I've completed five or six
pieces to sell in New York</i>

535
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:23,260
<i>and am now working very hard
to get ahead so we can fish.</i>

536
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:28,699
<i>I love the sea and would
not be anywhere else.</i>

537
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:31,806
<i>She's my home, my religion.</i>

538
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,972
<i>Perhaps, correctly,
I should say that she is</i>

539
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,941
<i>what we have instead
of religion or God.</i>

540
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:42,240
<i>She creates life, and she ends it.</i>

541
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:46,286
<i>She has beauty and great mystery.</i>

542
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:48,457
<i>And she is eternal.</i>

543
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,288
<i>This island is a lovely place.</i>

544
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:55,589
<i>But the house is empty.</i>

545
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:59,633
<i>I think I know almost all there is
to know about living alone.</i>

546
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:02,464
<i>And I have known what it is</i>

547
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:05,500
<i>to live with someone who you love</i>

548
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,968
<i>and who loves you.</i>

549
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,780
<i>I've always loved you boys.</i>

550
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:16,283
<i>But I've never before realized how
bad it is that I do not live with you.</i>

551
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:39,164
<i>I feel isolated.</i>

552
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:45,042
<i>I keep remembering how happy
I became when you were all here.</i>

553
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:51,479
<i>You moved into a part of me that,
when you moved out, became empty.</i>

554
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:54,813
<i>And it's been bad for a long time.</i>

555
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:59,051
<i>When you were here,
we experienced happiness.</i>

556
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:01,853
"Now in the night, I'm lonely for it.

557
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:04,363
But I know the loneliness
is only a stage

558
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:06,303
on the way until you all come back."

559
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:07,301
On the way until you all come back."

560
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:13,502
<i>All my love, your father.</i>

561
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:37,295
Hey, Tom. Let's have
the best one of the day.

562
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,229
Why the hell didn't
you guys take care of him?

563
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:43,133
Don't get plugged, Tom.
He's upstairs. Lil's with him.

564
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,275
How is he, Lil?

565
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,177
Tight as a tick.

566
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:56,818
What's the matter?

567
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:01,851
How many times have I told
you not to get into fights?

568
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:06,421
We're just unlucky,
you and me, Tom.

569
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:09,964
Maybe we're lucky with women, eh?

570
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:13,660
Anybody hit you first?

571
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,027
All of them.

572
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:18,537
But I hit at them first.

573
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,941
Damn.

574
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:26,773
I'm dying for a drink.

575
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,218
I bet you are.

576
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:35,720
- Get him to eat.
- No, you can, but I can't.

577
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:37,916
I'll beg him to eat.
I'll plead with him to eat.

578
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:42,189
I'll even set him an example by eating.
But, Tom, what he wants is a drink.

579
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:44,461
Wouldn't you?

580
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:51,372
He doesn't like things
to happen to Eddy.

581
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,734
Ain't that the truth.

582
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:01,579
- He's okay, isn't he?
- Yeah.

583
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,047
Can I buy you a drink?

584
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,744
No, thanks. Take one up to Eddy
and Willy, though, if you would.

585
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,855
Sure.

586
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:13,487
Let me have two beers.

587
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,734
Thanks for taking care of Eddy.

588
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,569
You don't have to thank me.
I like him as much as you.

589
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:31,572
And I feel sorry for him.

590
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,476
Are you going to work today?

591
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:40,253
No.

592
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:43,492
We could go up to my place.

593
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:45,558
What's the matter?

594
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,863
Hello, you.

595
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:29,633
I went out to your house.

596
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,569
How'd you get here?

597
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,269
On the morning plane.

598
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,477
You going to spend
your day in that place?

599
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,182
I was, but I just had
a change of plans.

600
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:46,287
Good. Can I offer you a ride home?

601
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:20,581
Who was your friend at the bar?

602
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:23,289
Just my friend at the bar.

603
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:40,167
Driver, stop here.

604
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:43,803
- Why are you stopping?
- It's a nice walk.

605
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:48,848
But what if I don't wanna walk?

606
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:51,486
Take the car, I'll meet you there.

607
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:01,727
I'll never understand why things
have to go your way.

608
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,831
Because I like it that way.

609
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:37,226
How long can you stay?

610
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:40,629
A day, maybe two.

611
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:43,705
I wanna kiss you.

612
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:48,303
- You in love with anyone?
- No. You?

613
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:51,842
I'm afraid so.

614
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,040
Bastard.

615
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:57,617
Isn't it terrible? The first time
I meet you since I left you,

616
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,345
you're not in love
with anyone and I am.

617
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:04,253
- You left me?
- Yeah, that's my story.

618
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,824
- Is he nice?
- Very nice.

619
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:11,796
Who is he?

620
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:15,732
A general, and he loves me
very much.

621
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:19,032
- You gonna marry him?
- He just asked me.

622
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:20,231
And?

623
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,671
I accepted.

624
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:28,382
Don't be so stuffy just because
I'm in love with someone.

625
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:32,076
You don't consult me when you fall
in love with people.

626
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,179
How much do you love him?

627
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:38,554
I didn't say I loved him.
I said I was in love with him.

628
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:41,855
I won't even be in love with him
today or tomorrow if you don't want.

629
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:44,124
I don't want not to be polite.

630
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:48,593
Go to hell.

631
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:59,179
Yes, you may kiss me, if you like.

632
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,043
Really gonna marry
this military character?

633
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:37,584
Yes. In June.

634
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:43,020
The 6th, to be exact.
Any more questions?

635
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:48,929
You're not jealous? Oh, Tom, really.

636
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:51,160
Does it really mean anything to you?

637
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,335
You think it doesn't?
You think I'm pretending?

638
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:56,331
Well, you might be.
You're a wonderful actor.

639
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,337
I've seen you play
all your great roles.

640
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:04,206
The one I loved you best in was
when you played the faithful husband.

641
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:06,779
And you were doing it
so wonderfully.

642
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:09,178
There was this big spot
on your trousers.

643
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:12,252
Every time you looked
at me, it was bigger.

644
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:15,184
That was at the Ritz, I believe.

645
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:18,122
That's where I played
the faithful husband the best.

646
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:21,454
<i>You're a little confused. I think you
played it best on the Normandie.</i>

647
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:24,762
<i>To the Normandie.</i>

648
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:29,466
That was a role of greatness.

649
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:32,766
It was, I believe, my best friend
at that time,

650
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:37,002
the one who later became
the second Mrs. Thomas Hudson.

651
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:38,974
Remember her?

652
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:45,118
Oh, Tom, you were magnificent.

653
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,288
To our best roles.

654
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:25,459
I hear you've given up painting.
Is it true?

655
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:29,495
Do you still love me?

656
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:32,532
Haven't I given any sign of it?

657
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,302
Yes.

658
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,436
Did I?

659
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,642
You think making love
to a woman is enough.

660
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,634
You never think about her wanting
to be proud of you.

661
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:46,406
Or about small tendernesses.

662
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:49,278
You locked yourself away
behind that wall of yours.

663
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:52,818
A protective shell you built
to keep out intruders.

664
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:54,950
Why couldn't you have
been more needing?

665
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:57,022
Make me feel wanted, necessary?

666
01:04:57,226 --> 01:05:00,957
It's a damn give-and-take...
Take it away, I'm not hungry.

667
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:03,893
What did you come here for,
a moral lecture?

668
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:05,990
No.

669
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:09,865
You wanted to get approval of
your marriage to that military asshole.

670
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,562
Well, I damn well don't need either.

671
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:14,106
I'm doing very well with my life
right now, thank you.

672
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,540
I don't need any
of your goddamn charity.

673
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:20,144
That's the trouble, you never did.

674
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:22,317
Just what did you think
you'd get by coming here?

675
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:25,580
Can I have another drink?

676
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:44,437
Here's to us, to all our mistakes
and all our losses.

677
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,642
Tommy.

678
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:57,617
Sorry I said all those things.

679
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,355
Well,

680
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:05,220
those things are good for me.
I've been saying them myself.

681
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:08,522
Quite often, for a long time now.

682
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:12,857
Do you remember skiing
at Schruns that year?

683
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:15,594
The year that Joan came
to stay with us.

684
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:17,398
I remember everything.

685
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:19,870
All three of us together.

686
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:22,237
When you came down from work
you had two lovelies

687
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:26,381
waiting for you and in love with you
and a little boy who adored you.

688
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:28,640
I think of it quite often.

689
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:31,046
So happy together.

690
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:33,619
Remember skiing with Tommy
on your shoulders?

691
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,518
How we'd sing together,

692
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:39,661
coming down through the orchard
behind the inn at dusk.

693
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,795
That was the year
of all the avalanches.

694
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,595
Yes, we were snowed in
for a week that year, remember?

695
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:52,002
Joan was such a good friend.

696
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:55,439
You know, I never knew, really.

697
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:58,477
<i>Until that crossing
on the Normandie.</i>

698
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:02,509
I still don't understand

699
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:05,482
how we could have been
such good friends

700
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:11,555
and had such a lovely time
and have it all turn out so badly.

701
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:13,692
Why were we so stupid?

702
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:15,830
Oh, God, Audrey.

703
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:23,800
Can I have something else to drink?
Isn't there some wine in the house?

704
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:25,701
I'll look.

705
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,036
You heard from Tom?

706
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,069
Yes.

707
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:36,541
You remember when he couldn't
speak any English?

708
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:39,312
How dirt-poor we all were
together in Paris?

709
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:43,151
We were never poor together,
Tom, not really.

710
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:46,684
Can I have that wine now?

711
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:48,387
Sure.

712
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:14,955
He's dead.

713
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:21,389
Isn't he?

714
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,237
Sure.

715
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:58,389
Tommy.

716
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:05,033
Tommy.

717
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,289
Think she'll be back?

718
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:31,055
Why should she?

719
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:35,536
How can such things happen, Tom?

720
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,971
He was shot down...

721
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:48,515
...on a routine sweep over Abbeville.

722
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:54,550
When he bailed out,
his chute caught fire.

723
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,060
Oh, my God.

724
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:33,593
Tom.

725
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,399
Tom.

726
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:43,130
Don't you want nothing?

727
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:46,173
Don't you want something to eat?

728
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:49,700
Tom, you've got to eat.

729
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:51,677
No, thanks, Joseph.

730
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:59,345
Tom, I just don't give a damn
no more.

731
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:04,188
Neither do I.

732
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,264
Damn it.

733
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:12,364
What the hell they kill Tommy for?

734
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,703
Joe, come on.

735
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:20,542
Sorry, Tom, but I just can't.

736
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:21,869
I know.

737
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:26,239
I guess...

738
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:30,717
...essentially, I'm a very stupid man.

739
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:35,522
I've been here all day.

740
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,287
Wanting to...

741
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:43,855
...ask forgiveness of someone...

742
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:48,165
...wishing it all hadn't happened.

743
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,602
Wishing I had him always.

744
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,274
That's silly.

745
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,309
I can't have him.

746
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:08,949
I have to let him go.

747
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:13,022
I have to remember how he was

748
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:15,563
and write him off.

749
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:23,597
I have to do it, sooner or later.

750
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:28,971
I wanted to do it now.

751
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:32,611
But I can't.

752
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:09,579
Tom?

753
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:24,799
I've seen Joseph.

754
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:29,360
He says we're going across tomorrow.

755
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:51,385
What's it gonna be, then, Tom?

756
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:54,886
Going to Key West, ain't we?

757
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:00,462
Tom.

758
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,597
Can I have a drink?

759
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:17,113
Thanks.

760
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:20,878
I knew you were my pal, Tom.

761
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:25,083
Couldn't have nobody
better than me.

762
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,285
I'm with you on anything, Tom.

763
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:32,726
You're a rummy, Eddy.

764
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:38,097
No, I ain't.

765
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:42,938
You always said I wasn't no rummy.

766
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,010
Not really.

767
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:48,306
You know I'm not a rummy.

768
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:52,577
I ain't, am I?

769
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:04,526
Listen, Tom, I won't drink.

770
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:07,491
I'll quit.

771
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:10,704
We'll go to Key West

772
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:13,431
and you can work in the mornings,
and we'll fish in the afternoons,

773
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:16,440
just like you did before
you came here.

774
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,075
I'm a good man, Tom.

775
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:30,124
You're not going.

776
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:36,128
You're not gonna cross alone.
It's dangerous to go alone.

777
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:39,162
It's only 100 miles.

778
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:42,798
You think having a rummy on board
is gonna make any difference?

779
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:49,739
What's the matter, Tom?

780
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:53,612
Ain't no use calling
me names, is there?

781
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:00,616
What did you have
to call me a rummy for?

782
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:02,685
So you'd believe it.

783
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:08,453
Who's gonna be your mate?

784
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:10,721
Joseph.

785
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:14,034
I'm closing up the house.

786
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:16,401
What do you mean,
you're closing up the house?

787
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:18,800
I'm not coming back.

788
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:22,904
You're just...
You're just leaving like that?

789
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,138
Where are you going, Tom?

790
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:28,646
I'm going to be with my kids.
I'm through with this island.

791
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:35,857
Tom, we're old pals.

792
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:39,355
Why won't you take me?

793
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:41,691
You belong here.

794
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:44,795
What the hell would you
do on the mainland?

795
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:48,596
It's for your own damn good.

796
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:54,374
- You're just upset.
- I'll see you, Eddy.

797
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:57,945
I feel as bad about it as you do.

798
01:16:58,146 --> 01:16:59,408
Hell, Tom, I'm fond of them

799
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:02,516
- like they was my boys.
- I'll see you, Eddy.

800
01:17:19,534 --> 01:17:21,764
Poor damn rummy.

801
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:31,795
Oh, hell.

802
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,206
What's the matter?

803
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:38,004
What are you looking
at me like that for?

804
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:40,681
How did you get here?

805
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:43,783
Somebody's gotta look
after you, haven't they?

806
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,814
I knew you'd take me.

807
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:33,628
Do you see him?

808
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:37,662
- It's Captain Ralph, ain't it?
- Yeah.

809
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:02,660
Give him a drink.

810
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:07,734
You'd better break out some cans
of that soup and heat it up.

811
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,427
- They look like they could use it.
- Right.

812
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:19,847
- What happened?
- German submarine.

813
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:22,380
They boarded us about 10 last night.

814
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:26,816
They'd been out a long time.
They wanted anything we had.

815
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:29,413
What are you gonna do
with those people?

816
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:31,091
Well, we could take them
in to Key West.

817
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:33,056
No, they ain't got a legal paper
among them.

818
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:36,253
Immigration will tie up your boat,
and Ralph and me will go to jail.

819
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:41,625
Five years. Five years, at least.
That's some rap, brother.

820
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:43,937
Well, what's gonna happen to them?

821
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:47,302
Who knows? Hell, Eddy,
they're Jews.

822
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:00,920
Where were you gonna take them?

823
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:04,888
Into Cuba, but they're getting
very nervous over there.

824
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:08,119
They say German subs
are landing spies all over.

825
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:12,030
I can't say that it's not risky, Tom.

826
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:20,970
Where did you figure
to put them ashore?

827
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:25,773
Bacuranao. It will be pretty close
to daylight by the time we get in.

828
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:27,908
- Tom?
- What about surf?

829
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:30,550
Not bad this time of year, Tom,
3 or 4 feet.

830
01:21:30,752 --> 01:21:32,413
Tom.

831
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:35,355
My God, how did
we get into this mess?

832
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:39,556
Better get that soup out
to those people, Eddy.

833
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:13,859
That's coming from the wolf packs
way up north.

834
01:22:14,062 --> 01:22:17,361
It's just naval gibberish,
you know, one sub to another.

835
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:35,812
What is your name?

836
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:37,348
Hudson.

837
01:22:37,552 --> 01:22:39,520
Thank you, Mr. Hudson.

838
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:45,559
When do we reach Cuba?

839
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:48,391
Oh, about an hour or so.

840
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:51,963
We have friends in Havana
who will help us.

841
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:55,967
My God, I can't believe that
we've already reached Cuba.

842
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:58,105
After all this time.

843
01:22:58,306 --> 01:23:00,399
How long has it been?

844
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:06,103
Two years. Two years
since we left Vienna.

845
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,280
Have you ever been
to Europe, Mr. Hudson?

846
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:12,920
Yes, I lived there
about 20 years ago.

847
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:15,989
You can't imagine how bad it is now.

848
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:23,796
I don't know how to thank you for...

849
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:46,185
Better get in and out fast, Tom.

850
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:49,448
The light will be coming up
in about ten minutes.

851
01:23:49,657 --> 01:23:51,284
Want a drink?

852
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:56,855
No, I think I'll take this one straight.
I'm scared as hell.

853
01:23:57,465 --> 01:23:59,057
So am I.

854
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:01,861
The thing I don't like is trouble.

855
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:04,704
You used to be pretty good
at trouble.

856
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:10,001
That was the old days.
I was younger.

857
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:12,873
Didn't know how
much trouble there really was.

858
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:16,273
You got about 5 feet.

859
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:20,412
How much water you
got on the stern?

860
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:26,489
About 4 and a half feet.

861
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:30,425
Get the dinghy off. Think you
can make it through this surf?

862
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:32,532
I can make it.

863
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:40,805
- Hold it right here till I tell you.
- Okay, chief.

864
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:10,030
Eddy.

865
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:13,231
- Take that.
- Oh, boy.

866
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:14,806
Don't shoot that unless I tell you.

867
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:17,705
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
- Okay, chief.

868
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:21,674
Just like the old days, when
we use to run booze from here.

869
01:25:24,752 --> 01:25:25,776
Hey.

870
01:25:28,656 --> 01:25:30,021
Over you go.

871
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:47,271
It's the goddamn
Cuban coast guard.

872
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:58,816
No! No!

873
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:03,515
Oh, God! Oh, no!

874
01:26:32,387 --> 01:26:34,014
Put one right through it.

875
01:26:36,124 --> 01:26:39,719
We'll play to hell
trying to fix that thing.

876
01:26:39,928 --> 01:26:42,590
There's a lot of water between
here and Key West.

877
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:44,424
Think we can make it on one engine?

878
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:48,501
- We'll have to.
- Tom.

879
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:51,067
Tom.

880
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:54,469
A boat.

881
01:26:56,578 --> 01:26:58,170
What do you figure, Tom?

882
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:03,573
- Crank her up, let's get out of here.
- All right.

883
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:12,617
What can that boat do?

884
01:27:12,827 --> 01:27:15,728
Maybe 14, 15 knots.

885
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,060
There's another one.

886
01:27:20,268 --> 01:27:21,860
Oh, Jesus.

887
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:33,009
Do you know this coast?

888
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:35,182
Know it's no good, why?

889
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:36,975
I think we should go around
that reef there.

890
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:39,119
There's a river inside it.
We could duck in there.

891
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,288
Hell, there are dozens
of channels back in that river.

892
01:27:41,489 --> 01:27:43,184
If we can get in there,
they'll never find us.

893
01:27:43,391 --> 01:27:45,723
Figure we got enough water
to get across the reef?

894
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:50,664
- It's your boat.
- Yeah, and everybody's ass.

895
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:53,867
The hell with it. Either we got
enough water, or we don't.

896
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:07,042
They're shooting at us. The bastards
are bloody shooting at us.

897
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:25,518
You always said I shouldn't
get into fights, Tom.

898
01:29:49,584 --> 01:29:51,381
How is he?

899
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,358
He's dead.

900
01:31:12,266 --> 01:31:14,666
You were a good man, Eddy.

901
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,234
Best I ever knew.

902
01:31:57,211 --> 01:31:59,441
Which channel do we want?

903
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:01,274
The one on the right.

904
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:54,334
What now?

905
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:17,686
No luck.

906
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:57,093
What's up?

907
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:58,788
Listen.

908
01:34:08,275 --> 01:34:10,641
We're downwind, Tom.
Maybe they ain't heard us.

909
01:34:11,946 --> 01:34:13,675
Don't bet on it.

910
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:21,982
We've got ourselves
pretty well screwed this time, Willy.

911
01:34:22,189 --> 01:34:24,384
Yeah, we've been screwed
from the start.

912
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:29,156
Joseph, we're gonna go up
this channel right here.

913
01:34:29,363 --> 01:34:31,126
Tom, there ain't no way out of there.

914
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:33,232
We still got a chance.

915
01:34:43,377 --> 01:34:45,937
They must be on the other side
of those trees.

916
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:52,379
Break out some rope.

917
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:55,105
Willy, get the boat turned around.

918
01:36:10,064 --> 01:36:11,463
Tom.

919
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:58,373
She's loose, Tom.

920
01:36:58,579 --> 01:37:01,639
Give me the Very pistol
and another can of gasoline.

921
01:37:05,719 --> 01:37:08,688
All right, now,
you know what to do.

922
01:37:08,889 --> 01:37:10,254
Remember what I told you.

923
01:37:10,457 --> 01:37:11,651
Keep the sun at your backs.

924
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:14,760
You'll hit the Havana road, maybe
three or four miles due east of here.

925
01:37:14,962 --> 01:37:16,987
- Got it?
- Yes.

926
01:37:18,232 --> 01:37:19,699
Good luck.

927
01:37:20,401 --> 01:37:23,131
Thank you, Mr. Hudson.
Thank you very much.

928
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:32,174
I loaded the green one
for luck, Tom.

929
01:37:33,113 --> 01:37:34,910
Get the boat to the end
of the channel.

930
01:38:45,052 --> 01:38:46,952
Get the engine started.

931
01:39:11,211 --> 01:39:13,008
Let's get out of here.

932
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:55,415
I'll fix you up real good, Tom.

933
01:39:56,256 --> 01:39:58,247
Just lay quiet, now.

934
01:40:03,263 --> 01:40:05,697
How are we back there?

935
01:40:05,899 --> 01:40:07,491
We're all clear.

936
01:40:08,469 --> 01:40:11,165
You lay quiet. Just take it easy.

937
01:40:30,724 --> 01:40:35,627
<i>I've always loved you and couldn't
help it and can't help it now.</i>

938
01:40:40,601 --> 01:40:43,092
<i>I wish I could be
some real good to you.</i>

939
01:40:43,303 --> 01:40:45,100
<i>Maybe I can if we get by this one</i>

940
01:40:45,305 --> 01:40:48,035
<i>and the next one and the next one.</i>

941
01:41:00,521 --> 01:41:02,284
Tom.

942
01:41:03,090 --> 01:41:05,558
I love you, you son of a bitch.

943
01:41:06,193 --> 01:41:08,491
Try to understand if you can.

944
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:14,126
I'm trying, Joseph.

945
01:41:15,769 --> 01:41:18,329
Oh, hell.

946
01:41:18,539 --> 01:41:21,167
You never understand
about anybody that loves you.

947
01:41:55,709 --> 01:41:58,940
Tom, don't you die.

948
01:42:03,517 --> 01:42:05,712
Not me, Joseph.

949
01:42:07,688 --> 01:42:09,212
Not me.

950
01:42:37,851 --> 01:42:40,615
<i>I've had a lot of luck
to have such a life.</i>

951
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:44,222
<i>I wish there was some way
to pass on what I've learned, though.</i>

952
01:42:45,459 --> 01:42:48,792
<i>My God, I was learning fast
there at the end.</i>

953
01:43:01,241 --> 01:43:02,606
Tom.

954
01:43:02,809 --> 01:43:04,140
Tom.

955
01:43:07,881 --> 01:43:11,840
<i>I know now there is
no one thing that is true.</i>

956
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:15,153
<i>It is all true.</i>

957
01:43:34,741 --> 01:43:36,606
Tom?

958
01:43:37,244 --> 01:43:40,270
Oh, Tom.
