1
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,576
Hey, it's Lotte!

2
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,097
Isn't it Lotte who's come home?

3
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,412
Did you manage to
save the world, then?

4
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,614
You don't recognize me?

5
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,298
I'm Fischer.
Shall I say hello to him?

6
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,533
I'll tell him hello then.

7
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,089
The UN Resolution gave us the
right. I've done nothing wrong.

8
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,549
The prime minister
rejected criticism...

9
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,694
of Denmark's
militaryrolein Iraq.

9
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:45,691
- Check.
- King high.

10
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,629
Raise. Call One pair.
Nines.

11
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,851
Ace high.
You lose.

10
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,229
Yes?

11
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,812
Peekaboo!

12
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,499
Hi, dad.

13
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,011
You've come home?

14
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,575
Yes.

15
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,217
How long have you been back?

16
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,299
A couple of months.

17
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,533
And your old dad had to hear it
from Fischer?

18
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,691
Been partying, maybe?

19
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,258
- You haven't got much of a tan.
- Leave it.

20
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,189
- You came home early.
- I'd had enough.

21
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,773
I thought you'd signed up for years.

22
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,549
I've quit smoking.

23
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,211
Nice.

24
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,414
Get dressed.

25
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,457
- Why?
- You need a proper meal.

26
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,577
Get dressed and we'll
find somewhere to eat.

27
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,336
Do as your old dad tells you!

28
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,577
Do as you're told!
Come on!

29
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,869
When a real sailor goes ashore.

30
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,189
You never know what will happen.

31
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,218
All along the dockside
The girls wave and say

32
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,850
When a sailor.

33
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,589
A real sailor Goes ashore.

34
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,269
You never know what will happen.

35
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,389
If a girl is nice to him
Maybe she'll get a kiss... Lotte!

36
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:41,372
Let's have Lotte on stage!
Lotte!

37
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,939
Lotte, Lotte...

38
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,979
When a sailor

39
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,989
When a real sailor goes ashore.

40
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,549
You never know what will happen

41
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,850
...I'll tell you in a whisper

42
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,301
When a sailor...

43
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:31,349
A real sailor goes ashore
You never know what will happen.

44
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,299
All along the dockside
The girls wave and say

45
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,091
When a sailor...

46
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,869
Don't look so miserable.

47
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,853
You're a good-looking girl.
Haven't you got a boyfriend?

48
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,669
- I want to go home.
- Get back in the saddle.

49
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,537
Back in the saddle.
Hop up!

50
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,818
Come on! Come on!

51
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,300
You're too heavy, baby.

52
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,732
Baby?

53
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,501
You're too heavy.

54
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,740
Can you lend me some money?

55
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,109
I'll give you a job.
... Get back in the saddle, baby.

56
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,615
I am your dad
and I'll give you a job.

57
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,255
Baby? Lotte!

58
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:24,019
Little soldier, you've got no money.

59
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,374
Lilly?

60
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,340
Lilly?
... Almost 6 weeks.

61
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:21,941
I'm pleased you got home in
one piece... did I tell you that?

62
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,829
- Home made.
- She cooks, too?

63
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:43,549
I made them. All she can do
is moan and shake her booty.

64
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,029
Well, as long as
she's good at that...

65
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:53,060
I used Splenda instead of sugar.
It's just as good.

66
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,536
- For goodness sake...
- They taste great.

67
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,372
That job...

68
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:12,189
- There isn't a job, is there?
- Of course. For my daughter.

69
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,429
You can be the odd job girl.
Drive me around. Stuff.

70
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,989
- Drive you?
- I'm banned.

71
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:24,589
I'd had a couple and Iran into
the back of a van on the bypass.

72
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,094
- In the Jag?
- No, the old wreck, luckily.

73
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,349
Can't you take cabs
and lend me some money?

74
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,454
No.

75
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,216
This is nice.

76
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,695
The manual is in the glove
compartment if you need it.

77
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:01,539
- There's a funny noise. Hear it?
- Just.

78
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,211
I miss driving.
Badly.

79
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:17,814
Fischer's got a grandchild.
He's younger than me.

80
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,739
Just thought I'd mention it.

81
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,338
Hi, Kurt.

82
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,099
Sit.

83
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:50,013
You can start by putting these
into a ring binder. In date order.

84
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:57,541
- Yes. I might need two ring binders.
- Got to start somewhere.

85
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,172
Hang these up.

86
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,691
And then get us some lunch.

87
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,977
What the hell is this?

88
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,029
Hi, Lotte.

89
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,549
I'll ask you again:
What the hell is this?

90
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,989
I fell down my steps last night.

91
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,629
"Fell down my steps?"

92
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,417
What use is that to me?

93
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,829
- I won't be able to drive for 6 weeks.
- She needs a driver in an hour.

94
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:34,655
- I can drive her.
- Like heck. The drivers are men.

95
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,774
Don't you think I can handle it?

96
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,173
She can, you know.

97
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,309
400 crowns a ride.

98
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:55,099
And it's only for today.
I'll find someone else.

99
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,897
Okay, ladies...

100
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,816
Could you say hello?

101
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:41,172
Alright? You two.
Get outta there.

102
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,339
- She can drive.
- I will not have any female driver!

103
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,060
- She's a soldiers.
- I'm not anymore.

104
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,917
Hey... your my girl.

105
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:10,317
I'll let nothing
happen to you, you know that.

106
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:11,689
And...

107
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,429
you'll be save with her.
Come here.

108
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,898
That is no good.

109
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:24,136
- I'm not happy.
- I will make you happy.

110
00:14:24,137 --> 00:14:25,936
You know that, hm?

111
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,737
Now smile, hm?

112
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:38,871
- You're my girl, Lilly.
- Yes, pappa.

113
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:40,971
Now, now, now.

114
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,309
And drive safely.

115
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:53,577
She really doesn't want to meet
the cops, if you know what I mean.

116
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,691
You look wonderful.

117
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,493
Fuck you, very much.

118
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:15,101
...garbage and whether politicians
are interested in recycling...

119
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,812
I'm in room 218.

120
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,829
I'll go up
and meet the customer.

121
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:33,135
And if everything
seems okay,

122
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:36,629
I'll call you before
10 minutes and say "okay".

123
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,669
Okay.

124
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,565
If I call you and something
is wrong up there,

125
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:46,269
I say a differnd name
when I call you.

126
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,689
I call you Nico, I say: "Hello Nico.
Everything is fine up here".

127
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,247
"Nico" means,
everything is not fine.

128
00:15:53,248 --> 00:15:56,489
You now come and kick in
the door and get me out.

129
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,029
Okay.

130
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:03,058
- Do you have a baseball bat?
- Don't worry.

131
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,011
Get a baseball bat.

132
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,701
- Yeah.
- Everything is fine up here.

133
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:44,701
- I come down in 1/2 hour sharp.
- Have fun.

134
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,889
- That was fast.
- It was good.

135
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,589
To another

136
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,891
- Yep 500.
- Thanks.

137
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:48,297
So, did you kill anyone?

138
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,719
So... did you fuck anyone?

139
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,229
All the time.

140
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:05,149
The next one is a handicapped guy.
His mother pays me.

141
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,974
- I'm a saint.
- Yeah.

142
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,109
Pappa is still at work.

143
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,429
- Du knepper ham da, right?
- Sure.

144
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:30,891
- So, he's not your pappa, is he?
- You're jealous.

145
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:36,781
- There were hundreds before you.
- Yes, pappa's still going strong.

146
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,496
Don't slam the door, please.

147
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,174
Thanks.

148
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:22,178
That funny noise gets worse
once the engine warms up.

149
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,214
One of the trucks was involved
in a bad crash in Milan.

150
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,177
Piss!

151
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,259
I keep feeling dizzy.

152
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,653
And I can't find her a driver.

153
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,941
Not one I can trust.

154
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,577
I'll go on driving her.

155
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,429
I am her driver.
That's fine.

156
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,149
- Like hell.
- I'm only helping.

157
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:11,975
- Till Fischer is all right.
- Fischer is a fucking twat.

158
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,135
I'm not sure your
lady'll be too thrilled.

159
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,135
- It's none of her business.
- No.

160
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,490
I know you can handle it.

161
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,059
So your old dad had a job
for you after all, eh?

162
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,016
Eh?

163
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,175
Yes, he's just fantastic.

164
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:21,617
You can go. I've got to wait for
a fax from Milan. I'll call a cab.

165
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,812
We'll go out for dinner
again soon. Right?

166
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,349
You have to come with me
to the next one.

167
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,327
- He has necrophilia.
- What?

168
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,773
He likes to fuck dead girls.

169
00:22:03,774 --> 00:22:07,173
He gives me something,
to fuck me, you must come.

170
00:22:07,174 --> 00:22:12,096
He pays more.
He's a good customer.

171
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,231
I got to go to
the post-office and send this.

172
00:22:19,232 --> 00:22:20,709
Send it?

173
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,796
For my daughter.

174
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,109
You think I'm here
for laughs?

175
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,041
Don't slam the door, please.

176
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,069
Good to see you, Henning.

177
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,016
Good to see you, Lilly.

178
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,989
This is my driver
for today, Lotte.

179
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,016
Brought a lady today?

180
00:22:56,017 --> 00:22:58,889
She is tough.
She's a soldier.

181
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:04,297
I better behave then.
Come inside, please.

182
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,095
Yes, come in.

183
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,269
There's the money,
right here.

184
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,772
Thank you.

185
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,951
Now turn around please, Lilly.

186
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,971
Thank you, Henning.

187
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:36,991
And now... please take
your vitamin pill.

188
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,979
- I better go and lie down.
- Yes.

189
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,661
And now we wait.

190
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:15,455
Would you like a cup of coffee?

191
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,899
Fischer usually sits over there.

192
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:41,090
I drink too much coffee.
I'd like to cut down.

193
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,814
I've never seen
a lady driver before.

194
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:10,869
Lilly and I leave
the bedroom door open...

195
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:15,855
so you can always check to see
that everything is all right.

196
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,989
Yes?

197
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,429
It's Lotte from next door.

198
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:10,189
- Yes?
- I've locked myself out.

199
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,421
- Okay, I'll let you in.
- Thanks.

200
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,571
- Hi.
- Hi.

201
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,789
- Don't you have a key to my flat?
- I don't know.

202
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:26,737
- Miriam has just moved out.
- Oh.

203
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,539
Come in and we'll see
if we can find it.

204
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,309
It's nice to hear
noise from your flat again.

205
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,971
Yes.

206
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:51,412
- Was it hard?
- Well...

207
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:55,691
My mom would be very upset
if I went there.

208
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:00,349
- What did your mom say?
- Oh, she's dead.

209
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,029
- I didn't know.
- She died ages ago. I was 11.

210
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,589
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

211
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:11,493
That's all right. I grew up
with my granny and granddad.

212
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:18,371
- What about your dad?
- He runs a hauling company.

213
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:25,374
- Hey! Is this the one?
- Yes.

214
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,061
Thanks.

215
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,534
Wait a minute...

216
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,493
That's for you.

217
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,821
It's a geranium.

218
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,269
They usually die on me.
I'm not very...

219
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,829
It just needs watering
now and then.

220
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:54,891
If you forget, don't worry.
It'll survive.

221
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,976
Thanks.

222
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:09,291
- What are we doing?
- Trading.

223
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,412
Trading what?

224
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,451
I'm trading girls
with some geezers from Sweden.

225
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,850
We rotate them.

226
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,789
How many girls are you running?

227
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:30,309
I'm doing them a favor.

228
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:34,132
Nigeria is a fucking dump.

229
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,339
I help them.

230
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,380
I've done nothing wrong.

231
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,989
- Why're you so miserable?
- I'm driving.

232
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,572
Yes, like a twat.
Let's step on it.

233
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,235
- Yeah, yeah, Cheeky bastard.
- Who is this?

234
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,891
That's my daughter.

235
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,109
Maybe
there's something you like.

236
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,851
It's great stuff.
Take a look.

237
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,736
They're great, huh?

238
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,749
- A present.
- Thanks.

239
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,060
I'll take these.

240
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:40,069
No, forget it. We're friends.
It's a present from...

241
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:44,061
- one friend to another.
- Alright, thanks.

242
00:30:44,062 --> 00:30:45,661
- Be seeing you.
- Yeah.

243
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,293
She's living here now.

244
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,419
- Hello, Lotte.
- Hello, Fischer.

245
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,539
Hi Lotte!

246
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,339
Hi.

247
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,254
- Nice car.
- Ah, it's my dad's.

248
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,189
What're you doing here?

249
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:56,669
- What are you?
- I work at the school here.

250
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:01,220
Trying to knock knowledge
into impossible kids.

251
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:07,773
- What're you doing?
- Finding something to eat.

252
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,701
You like Thai food?

253
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:19,181
Shall I cook you
a Thai dinner tonight?

254
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,733
- Seven o'clock?
- Eight.

255
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:33,060
- I must be getting on.
- See you at eight?

256
00:33:33,061 --> 00:33:34,360
Yes.

257
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:41,261
We have three hours to kill.

258
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,620
- You don't dance?
- No.

259
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:29,789
- Do you like my bag?
- No.

260
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:33,511
It's Prada. A copy.

261
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:48,658
So... why did you become
a soldier?

262
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,870
Were...

263
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:58,829
- To do something good.
- Soldiers do good?

264
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,716
Yes... sometimes.

265
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,552
You kill many people?

266
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:13,309
- What about your daughter?
- What about her?

267
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:19,320
- How old is she?
- I'm saving up money for her.

268
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:25,456
- How old is she?
- Nine.

269
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:31,491
- When did you see her last?
- Are you the police, or what?

270
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,019
Business isn't too great, is it?

271
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:48,174
Look what I'm wearing...

272
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,189
Cute as hell.

273
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,819
Look what I found at home.

274
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,974
Look!

275
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,820
From your confirmation.

276
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:12,859
- You looked sweet in that dress.
- Look at those shoes!

277
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,860
Look!

278
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:26,269
- It was a real occasion.
- Not that you were there.

279
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,789
- I was!
- Come on!

280
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:34,535
I begged granny for years to
let you come, but you never did.

281
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,949
Yes... for that...

282
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:43,356
- I took the pictures!
- Christian took the pictures.

283
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,655
I was...

284
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,133
- I gave you a Walkman.
- Yes.

285
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:57,421
You sent it by mail
and I sent you those pictures.

286
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:07,419
A good thing
I've got charm.

287
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:13,938
I'm taking Lilly out for dinner.
And you too.

288
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:18,334
- Not tonight.
- Why not?

289
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:24,177
- They're going all to a party.
- They'll have to wait. Come on.

290
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:35,749
- Everything okay?
- One customer.

291
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,435
Oh, oh, our buisness
is terrible.

292
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,389
Don't you slap me!
What're you doing?

293
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,909
I want my money back!
Now!

294
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,629
- She's useless.
- Take it easy.

295
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:52,349
- Now!
- He's crazy, I do nice.

296
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:56,160
Shut up.
I want my money back. Now.

297
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:58,360
Hey, you better calm down.

298
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,269
Shut up, you ugly tart.

299
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,349
Don't call me a tart.

300
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,295
Tart.

301
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,895
Wait...

302
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:42,636
His jacket...
get his jacket.

303
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,553
And don't come back, pal.

304
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,999
Thank you.

305
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,100
Right.

306
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,737
Right?

307
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:28,173
You can go, me and Lilly...
We'll take a taxi.

308
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:47,136
Did you like it?

309
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,736
I'm sorry. I...

310
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:55,575
I had to help my dad and...

311
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,299
I lost track.

312
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:02,949
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

313
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,975
Are you?

314
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:14,217
Would you...
ike some coffee?

315
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,134
Maybe it's a bad time?

316
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:48,973
I'll come for coffee another day.
I'm busy, actually.

317
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,020
Oh, Okay.

318
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,289
- Purges.
- You got it.

319
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:01,789
- Hello, Soldier.
- We have to go now.

320
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:05,769
I only wish I could, he cancelled.
He's to sick to fuck.

321
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:09,829
You can come in
and have coffee with us.

322
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:14,455
- Come in, Soldier. Come in.
- Come on.

323
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,941
Hey, I can do your hair,

324
00:42:16,942 --> 00:42:19,441
make a lots of big
braidings for you.

325
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,358
- Okay?
- No.

326
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,659
- Our Madam in Nigeria...
- She has no hair.

327
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,768
And says she wants braidings.

328
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:28,469
"Make me breadings,
make breadings out of...!"

329
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:32,989
- She's a big fuck, big butch head.
- And she sets you up too.

330
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:36,231
You can be just
a big Madam like her.

330
00:42:36,232 --> 00:42:37,709
Who is Madam?

331
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:41,589
- "Who is Madam?"
- Fucking dog. Madam.

332
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:45,517
- Madam...
- She said once you go to Europe,

332
00:42:45,518 --> 00:42:48,777
you become a Madam
and borrow money from her.

333
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:52,896
You borrow maybe
40 to 60 thousand euro,

334
00:42:52,897 --> 00:42:56,189
and she'll arrange to get you
to Europe... Italy, France.

335
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,669
But you must pay her back, and...
of course they'll come and get you.

336
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:02,889
- She knows exactly where we are.
- She's your family.

337
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:03,832
Yes.

337
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:05,432
But I would like
to be a Madam too.

338
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:09,989
You, go fuck that ugly man, bitch.
and give me my 500 kroner.

339
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:12,373
As Madam,
you have to be really forceful.

340
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:17,789
- Hello.
- It's me.

341
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:22,389
The telephone lady says
there's not much going on today.

342
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,949
So, come and get me.

343
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:29,660
Pick me up at seven...
at the shop, okay?

344
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,774
Did that noise get worse?

345
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:54,461
Maybe it didn't.

346
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:58,773
What the hell's
the matter with you?

347
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:05,334
- What're you getting at?
- About the fight with the John.

348
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:11,539
You're hard.
Really hard.

349
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,174
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

350
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:25,450
Your dad's an old fool.
I froze, okay?


351
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:31,661
Let's not talk about it.

352
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,629
I am a hauler.
I'm old.

353
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:38,053
Yeah.

354
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:46,051
Forward march, bum, bum, bum.

355
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:00,378
Piss on them.

356
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:16,229
Don't Albanians learn
to tell the time?

357
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,301
Maybe there's a time difference.

358
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:26,056
So, this is Pearl.

359
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:32,300
Maria. Hot chick.
Very popular in Sweden.

360
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:39,939
- What the hell is this?
- That's no problem.

361
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:43,749
No problem?
Who wants to buy her?

362
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:47,029
You can't punish 'em like this,
there's other ways.

363
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:51,629
- It's bad for business.
- Little make-up, she'll be fine.

364
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:54,610
I see a sexy, hot body.

365
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:58,120
Send me another one.
I can't use her. We're leaving.

365
00:45:58,121 --> 00:46:00,920
Don't make a big deal
outta this. She looks fine.

366
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,949
They're out of their damn minds.
What the hell are they thinking?

367
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:14,820
Nobody'll buy a tart that looks
like she's been hit by a truck.

368
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,853
Ouch...

369
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,269
What's the matter?

370
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,818
It's gone now.
Just get me home.

371
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:09,654
- My keys...
- I'll get them.

372
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:14,192
Come on.

348
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:19,336
Come on.

373
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:29,140
- Pffrrrr. Pffrrrr.
- Let's take the jacket off, come.

374
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:33,429
- Kiss...
- Lotte...

351
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,598
take off your jacket.

375
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,925
So.

376
00:47:36,926 --> 00:47:40,109
- You want to kiss?
- No, you're somthing...

377
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,813
- You can kiss me.
- No, I can't do that.

378
00:47:42,814 --> 00:47:45,888
- Hey, you can kiss me, come!
- No, thanks.

378
00:47:45,889 --> 00:47:46,989
So.

379
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,334
- Come on. Come!
- Off with your jacket...

379
00:47:50,335 --> 00:47:52,989
- Kiss...
- No! No.

380
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:55,869
- Come on...
- No.

381
00:47:55,870 --> 00:48:01,581
Ah, no, no. Come, you need to
get some sleep. Go to bed.

382
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:05,818
- Yes, with you.
- No, not with me.

383
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:30,296
No... no, Lotte.

384
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:33,972
You need some sleep.

385
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:39,137
You would rather
have a school teacher...

385
00:48:39,138 --> 00:48:41,537
who has her hair in a bun...

386
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:47,789
enjoys watering her plants and
has dinner, at 6 o'clock sharp.

387
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,949
Exactly.
Lie down.

388
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:58,096
And after that you hold hands...
and watch TV.

389
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:00,909
And now the blanket...
No, Lotte.

390
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:04,469
Please stay with me.

391
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:07,029
And kiss me.

392
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,629
No, Lotte.

393
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:11,669
No.

394
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:13,269
No.

395
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:15,018
Good night.

396
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:21,056
Lotte, lie down. Come.

396
00:49:21,057 --> 00:49:22,856
Stop.

397
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:34,417
Lie down.
go to sleep.

398
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:41,176
Get out
before I'll kick your ass.

372
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:47,269
- He wants two hours.
- Jesus!

373
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:52,989
I don't think so.
He's Swedish.

374
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:58,072
Room 555.
I'll call you.

376
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,569
Yes?

377
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:19,981
Hello, Nico.
Everything is okay.

378
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,460
Lilly?

399
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,269
- Hey?
- Yes?

400
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:17,734
My sister's inside and needs help.
Can you open the door for me.

382
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:28,769
- Please, don't shoot me.
- You're a goddamn cunt!

383
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:33,509
- Full of dirt.
- 

384
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:39,414
- I hate the smell of cunt.
- I don't want to die.

401
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:45,869
Forgive me, forgive me,
forgive me. You're so lovely.

402
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:48,974
You're very beautiful.

402
00:52:48,975 --> 00:52:50,974
Please don't shoot me.

403
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:55,139
Your skin is so soft.

388
00:52:55,950 --> 00:53:00,254
I'm going to cut off your boobs
and feed them to the dogs.

404
00:53:00,255 --> 00:53:04,332
No, no, I really didn't mean it.
No, no, I'm sorry.

405
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:08,815
I'm real tired and exhausted
I just can't sleep, right?

406
00:53:08,816 --> 00:53:15,854
I'm so tired. I'm tired,
but I just can't sleep.

407
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:20,579
Yes, you can sleep now.

408
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:24,892
I love you.

409
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:43,052
Come on.

395
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:13,979
Okay.
That bastard is history.

396
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:17,839
Okay?

397
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:23,009
Okay?

398
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,989
If you say so.

399
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:31,418
I'm okay.
I'll forget that sick fuck.

399
00:54:31,419 --> 00:54:34,418
I'll forget him like that.

400
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:44,755
Two more hours.
Let's have coffee then.

402
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,940
Okay.

403
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:57,318
You did okay... up there.

404
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:01,136
You did okay, Soldier.

405
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:58,292
- I don't think so.
- Neither do I.

406
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:21,334
What is her name?

407
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:24,629
Blessing.

408
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:27,940
We called her Bess,
but for her it's Blessing.

409
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:35,631
- Who takes care of her?
- My mother.

410
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:39,909
When did you see her last?

411
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:44,851
Five years ago.

412
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,900
I have her picture.

413
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:55,598
Look.

414
00:57:56,870 --> 00:58:00,671
My mother has no work,
my father is dead,

414
00:58:00,672 --> 00:58:02,871
So I earn money.

415
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:07,053
I also have her
on a little videoklip.

416
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:14,349
Shew, fly, don't bother me,
'cause I belong to somebody.

417
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:19,789
I feel, I feel,
I feel like a morning star.

418
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:26,059
I feel, I feel,
I feel like a morning star.

419
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:30,932
- What about her father?
- Ass-hole.

420
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:39,549
I do well. She has
good food and good clothes.

421
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:43,469
She can go to a good school
and become somebody.

422
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:48,149
- I'm a good mother.
- 5 years is a real long time.

423
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:53,372
- I want to save up the money.
- Yes. Fine.

424
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:58,949
We are lucky. If I were fat
and ugly, we all would starve.

425
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:02,069
When are you going home?

426
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:05,527
I must pay back Madam
the last 8 thousand euros.

426
00:59:05,528 --> 00:59:07,929
I'll save up the money.

427
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:12,029
Then one day, I'll marry
a good man in Europe...

428
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:15,869
and get her here.

429
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:22,139
Nice life, nice place,
London maybe.

430
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:26,789
- I know what you think.
- You don't know what I think.

431
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:31,901
I do, I know.
But you're wrong.

432
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:36,786
It's possible.

410
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:14,838
Is it too much for you?
Should I get another driver?

411
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:17,752
What'd you mean?

412
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:24,970
What lousy customers, eh?
Shall I find another driver?

413
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:34,752
- I'm doing fine, don't you think?
- You're doing a fantastic job.

414
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:40,900
Daddy's tough warrior.

415
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:47,339
- We'll go out for a good dinner.
- I'm not hungry.

416
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:50,749
Something real nice.
Something differend.

417
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,900
Maybe Bananas.

418
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:55,058
Bananas.

419
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:00,173
Lotte...

420
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:09,999
23~24~48.

421
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:13,376
- What?
- The code.

422
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:21,749
You're my daughter.

423
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:24,993
The money it's yours.

424
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:28,171
I'm proud of you.

425
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:35,738
We have to send out the ships.
We must send... the ships... 

426
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:38,392
Out...

427
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:42,938
We... must... Lilly...

428
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:50,852
Where's Lilly?

429
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:53,758
On her way.

430
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:01,989
What?

431
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:04,174
What?

432
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:11,629
They say it's nothing serious.
Just my insulin again.

433
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:15,909
I'm always getting it wrong.
And there's the stress.

434
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:19,380
And too much booze.
And I forget to eat.

435
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,611
You just need a vacation.

436
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:35,573
You told me stuff...

437
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:45,373
Just a bunch of nonsense.

438
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:49,899
I don't remember a thing.
I just collapsed.

460
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:56,129
Thank you.

461
01:02:56,530 --> 01:03:00,110
- You scared me, pappa.
- Don't worry, sweetheart.

461
01:03:00,111 --> 01:03:02,890
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

462
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:06,797
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Don't worry,

462
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:09,457
- Are you okay?
- I am okay.

463
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:27,689
- Come in with me.
- I'm tired.

464
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:33,709
- I don't want to be alone tonight.
- You are alone.

465
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,712
Not if you come with me.

466
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:43,809
Your "pappa"
might be home tomorrow.

467
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:48,949
Have you seen
how the other girls live?

468
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:52,820
He don't drink.
He don't beat me.

468
01:03:52,821 --> 01:03:54,820
It's a good house.

469
01:03:56,630 --> 01:04:01,949
- Maybe he will marry you someday.
- I am lucky...

470
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:07,009
I'm with the boss.
I only work in that town.

471
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:10,091
I have no rent
I get the good customers.

472
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:16,417
The other girls must take
this shit back then, wind up...

472
01:04:16,418 --> 01:04:19,917
with burns from cigarettes
and get piece of shit.

472
01:04:21,317 --> 01:04:22,789
I'm lucky.

473
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:25,531
- But you're alone.
- So are you!

474
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:13,893
My name is not Lilly.

475
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:19,797
My real name is Kimmie.

476
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:27,773
What is this?

477
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:31,740
I was shot.

478
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:35,773
Shot?

479
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:44,198
I made a mistake.

480
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:57,532
I...

481
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:04,536
I... I didn't...
I didn't

483
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:12,697
It's okay.

484
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:29,411
It's okay.

485
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:01,613
It's okay.

486
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:17,934
It's okay.

487
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:37,069
Shew, fly, don't bother me
shew, fly, don't bother me.

488
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:39,994
- Lilly.
- Shew, fly...

439
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:52,281
- Peekaboo!
- Are you alright?

440
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:58,389
- You're now full-time, huh?
- She was in a mess.

441
01:09:58,390 --> 01:10:01,461
- She didn't want to be alone.
- No?

442
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:04,174
No.

443
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:09,829
- You can drive me to work, then.
- What about your head?

444
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:14,892
Blah, blah, blah. I've got two
artics to get off to Madrid today.

494
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:19,949
Oh, hello beautiful.
Come to pappa.

495
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:24,989
- You feeling betTer?
- Oh yeah, I'm king of the world.

495
01:10:30,738 --> 01:10:31,950
Hello?

445
01:10:31,951 --> 01:10:35,893
- We're leaving in 5 minutes.
- Yeah, okay.

446
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:41,629
- That noise is getting worse.
- We'll take it to the mechanic.

447
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:47,375
The sailor knows
That there are sweet girlish hearts.

448
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:52,176
Beating in every port.

449
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:56,970
As soon as he's there...

450
01:10:57,230 --> 01:11:00,269
When a sailor...

451
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:03,291
When a real sailor
steps ashore.

452
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:19,252
- Sure you wouldn't like coffee?
- I'd rather not.

453
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:21,813
I need mine.

454
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:25,738
I could make tea?

455
01:11:56,110 --> 01:11:59,261
You can have your money back.

456
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:05,021
Lilly? Lilly? Come on!

457
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:07,015
My nose!

511
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:45,379
Drink this.

512
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:57,341
- Where am I?
- In my place.

513
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:05,829
What happened?

514
01:14:07,230 --> 01:14:10,989
I hit him
and gave him his money back.

515
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:16,189
You did what?
You hit Henning?

516
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:22,379
- I got you out.
- You hit a good customer?

517
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:28,771
Are you a fucking idiot?

518
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:32,469
- You hit Henning?
- He's a sick person.

519
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:34,977
Mind your own
fucking buisness.

520
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:57,933
- Let me help you.
- My money is for my daughter.

521
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:05,935
- Please, let me help you.
- You hit Henning!

522
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:09,893
Okay?

523
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:12,909
Easy for you.

524
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:17,698
You are so fucking spoiled!

525
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:25,777
My money for my daughter!

526
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:35,901
- Well, I...
- Fuck you, very, very much!

458
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:57,069
- Nice of you to drop by.
- I thought you'd like your car back.

459
01:15:57,070 --> 01:16:03,008
Henning's been using my girls since
I started, and he always behaved.

459
01:16:03,009 --> 01:16:04,298
Well...

460
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:16,149
- You slapped me?
- There's more where that came from.

461
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:20,291
And she's off to Sweden on Friday.
So you can beat it.

462
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:22,749
Sweden?

463
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,791
Beat it, I said.

464
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:32,069
- You're giving her to the Swedes?
- She wants to make money.

465
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:37,098
But you don't get that.
You're too damn spoiled.

535
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:49,052
- You cannot up there.
- I'm not talking to you.

536
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:52,469
These men are sick people.

537
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:57,674
I'll take a taxi.
I forgot my fucking insulin.

537
01:16:57,675 --> 01:16:59,874
John will pick you up.

466
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:01,941
He isn't here.

467
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:06,349
He took a taxi home.
I don't know if he'll be back.

468
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:09,421
I'll go, then.

469
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:12,894
Yeah.

470
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:17,701
- See you, Fischer.
- Yeah.

543
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:47,181
Come in.

544
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:01,734
Call John.

545
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:11,659
Everything is fine here.

546
01:21:17,230 --> 01:21:19,732
So...

547
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:23,779
How would you like me
to fuck you?

548
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:32,509
Put this on.

549
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:35,736
You want to fuck yourself?

550
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:40,736
- Your passport.
- What?

551
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:43,869
And money.

552
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:47,363
You're going home.

552
01:21:47,364 --> 01:21:49,669
What the fuck
are you talking about?

553
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:52,157
There's a plane being charterd
by some buisness men...

553
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:55,229
and they're
going to London in 3 hours.

554
01:21:55,230 --> 01:22:01,078
I've booked a seat for you.
From there you go to Lagos.

555
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:04,749
Fix your own life.

556
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:08,749
You have a daughter, and now
you have money. Go home.

557
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:13,539
I'm not going anywhere.
Do you want to fuck or what?

558
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:22,134
- You're going home.
- Fuck you!

559
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:31,549
I will call up the police.

560
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:34,708
I will tell them where you live
and what you're doing here...

560
01:22:34,708 --> 01:22:37,909
and then... they will
send you home with no money.

561
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:39,909
I'll do it.

562
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:42,986
I know poor countries.

562
01:22:42,987 --> 01:22:45,729
This is a lot of money
in a poor country.

563
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:49,189
I'll go home,
when I... want to.

564
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:52,609
You can pay your Madam.

565
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:54,161
Look...

565
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:57,187
You can even start
a new live, with this money.

565
01:22:57,188 --> 01:22:59,189
You don't understand.

566
01:22:59,190 --> 01:23:04,059
- You don't understand!
- Listen to me, listen!

567
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:09,249
I will call... the police.
Understand?

568
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:13,571
You fucking bitch!
You fucking bitch!

568
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,771
You have a daughter, come on.
You have a daughter!

569
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:21,629
She's... she's in Lagos,
and I'm getting you out.

570
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:24,769
- No!
- I'm getting you out!

571
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:26,508
- Understand?
- No!

571
01:23:26,509 --> 01:23:28,758
I'm getting you out!

572
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:33,669
- You fucking...
- I'm getting you out!

573
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:39,989
Don't do this.
Don't do this.

574
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:41,773
You're free now.

575
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:55,136
Put this on.

576
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:07,216
Come on.

578
01:25:23,150 --> 01:25:24,626
Are you going London?

578
01:25:24,627 --> 01:25:27,629
- Yes we are.
- Are you with us?

579
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:31,069
- Yes, thank you.
- Do you need this?

580
01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:34,494
We're going.

581
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:42,721
- This is shit.
- No.

582
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:53,896
- This is shit.
- Say hello to yout daughter.

471
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:47,652
Hi, baby.

472
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:59,909
You've been into my piggy bank.

473
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:02,509
You said it was for me.

474
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:04,660
Come with me.

475
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:19,789
- You gave Lilly all the money?
- She's going home.

476
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:21,860
I doubt it.

477
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:29,189
They never go back to the pig sty.
They make too much here.

478
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:31,949
She's going home.

479
01:28:31,950 --> 01:28:35,389
She'll get off in Rome.
Or London.

480
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:40,339
Or wherever.
And set herself up as a madam.

481
01:28:41,070 --> 01:28:43,971
Now she can buy her own girls.

482
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:48,579
She's going home.

483
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:55,469
You still think you can
save the world, don't you?

484
01:28:55,470 --> 01:28:57,620
I wouldn't know.

485
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:04,349
You need a lesson.

486
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:08,013
A beating
never did anyone any harm.

487
01:29:11,230 --> 01:29:14,469
In that case
you'll have to give it to me.

488
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:17,496
I won't hit back,
don't be scared.

489
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:22,229
What do you reckon, John?

490
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:25,549
Don't you agree?
A dad gives his own beatings.

491
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:27,989
Give him the bat, John.

492
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:30,697
I won't hurt him.

493
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:35,855
Give him the bat, John!

494
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:56,500
Go on.
You can do it.

495
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:02,970
Go on!

496
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:02,881
Lotte?

496
01:31:05,350 --> 01:31:06,881
Come on.

496
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:09,798
Come on.

496
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:30,581
We'll take you home.

497
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:36,098
And say no more about it.

498
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:44,975
We're hard, you and me.

499
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:48,378
We're a tough breed.

500
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:04,210
My little soldier.

501
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:18,094
Baby?

502
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:30,499
Lotte?
