1
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,840
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

2
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,640
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

3
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,440
Are the rumors true, Albus?

4
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,640
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

5
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,000
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

6
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

7
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,680
Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

8
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,200
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

9
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,120
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

10
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,160
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

11
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,320
Try not to wake him.

12
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,040
There you go.

13
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,080
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

14
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,360
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

15
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,400
- They really are...
- The only family he has.

16
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,360
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

17
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,200
Exactly.

18
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,040
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

19
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,040
Until he's ready.

20
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,840
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

21
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,560
Good luck...

22
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,680
...Harry Potter.

23
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,400
Up. Get up!

24
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,360
Now!

25
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,720
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

26
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,520
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

27
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.

28
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,760
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

29
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,760
...for my Dudley's special day!

30
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,720
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

31
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,440
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

32
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,360
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

33
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,640
36?! But last year I had 37!

34
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,560
- But some are bigger than last year's.
- I don't care!

35
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,160
This is what we're going to do.

36
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,080
We're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

37
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:30,360
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

38
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,760
I'm warning you now, boy.

39
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,320
Any funny business, any at all...

40
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,960
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

41
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,360
Get in.

42
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,560
Make it move.

43
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,280
Move!

44
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,840
- Move!
- He's asleep!

45
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,000
He's boring.

46
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,200
Sorry about him.

47
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,320
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there...

48
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,680
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

49
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,880
Can you hear me?

50
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,880
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

51
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,440
Do you...?

52
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,480
Do you talk to people often?

53
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,840
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

54
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,760
Do you miss your family?

55
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,520
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

56
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:51,040
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

57
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,600
Thanks.

58
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,680
Anytime.

59
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,720
Snake!

60
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,280
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

61
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,760
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

62
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,360
Who did this? How did you get
in there? Is there a snake?

63
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,120
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

64
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,080
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

65
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,520
The glass was there
and then it was gone, like magic.

66
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,440
There's no such thing as magic.

67
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,760
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

68
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,040
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!

69
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,400
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

70
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,760
No more mail through this letterbox.

71
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,160
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

72
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,480
Shoo! Go on.

73
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,960
Fine day, Sunday.

74
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,640
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

75
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,080
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

76
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,080
No post on Sunday.

77
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,400
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

78
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,880
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

79
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,680
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...

80
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,840
Make it stop, please!

81
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,400
Stop it!

82
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,200
Mummy, what's happening?

83
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,640
Give me that! Give me that letter!

84
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,840
Get off!

85
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,520
They're my letters! Let go of me!

86
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,040
That's it! We're going away!

87
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,760
Far away, where they can't find us!

88
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,600
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

89
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,280
Make a wish, Harry.

90
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,680
Who's there?

91
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,680
Sorry about that.

92
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,680
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.

93
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,160
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

94
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,000
I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

95
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,560
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.

96
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm not Harry.

97
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,360
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

98
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,080
Got something for you.

99
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:39,160
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

100
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,840
Baked it myself, words and all.

101
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
Thank you.

102
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,360
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?

103
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,360
Excuse me, but who are you?

104
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,320
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

105
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,440
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

106
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,400
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

107
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,920
Learned what?

108
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,520
You're a wizard, Harry.

109
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,680
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

110
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,840
A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.

111
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,800
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

112
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,320
...I can't be a wizard.

113
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,920
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

114
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,960
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

115
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:59,160
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

116
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,360
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

117
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,680
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

118
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,640
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

119
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,880
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

120
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,040
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

121
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,800
My perfect sister being who she was.

122
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,720
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

123
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,920
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

124
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,640
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

125
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,520
A freak!

126
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,560
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

127
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,240
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

128
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,240
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.

129
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,320
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

130
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,640
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

131
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,600
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!

132
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,160
He'll not be going.

133
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,520
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

134
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,840
Muggle?

135
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,880
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

136
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,800
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

137
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,680
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

138
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,480
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

139
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,040
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

140
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,720
...in front of me.

141
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,440
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

142
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,600
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

143
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:22,200
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

144
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,200
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

145
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,560
"All students must be equipped with...

146
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,560
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

147
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:55,360
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

148
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,040
Can we find all this in London?

149
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,040
If you know where to go.

150
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,200
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

151
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,120
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

152
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,320
Just helping Harry buy
his school supplies.

153
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,440
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

154
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,360
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

155
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,960
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

156
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

157
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,840
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

158
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,840
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

159
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,400
Oh, nice to meet you.

160
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,560
Fearfully fascinating subject.

161
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,880
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

162
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,080
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

163
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,480
Goodbye.

164
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,000
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?

165
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,520
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?

166
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,880
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

167
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,800
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

168
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,400
Here, you get your quills and ink.

169
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,880
Over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.

170
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,360
It's a world-class racing broom.

171
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,320
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

172
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,200
It's the fastest model yet.

173
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,640
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

174
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,080
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

175
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:05,080
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

176
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,520
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

177
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,760
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.

178
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,360
Best stay close.

179
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,760
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

180
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,040
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

181
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,840
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

182
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,760
Ha! There's the little devil.

183
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,720
And there's something else as well.

184
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,640
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

185
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:07,920
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

186
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,520
Very well.

187
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,240
Vault 687.

188
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,280
Lamp, please.

189
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,720
Key, please.

190
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,320
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

191
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,080
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

192
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,320
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

193
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,520
Stand back.

194
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,320
Best not to mention this to anyone.

195
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,640
I still need a wand.

196
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,600
You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

197
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:00,240
Run along there and wait.
I got one more thing to do.

198
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,240
Hello?

199
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,840
Hello?

200
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,320
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

201
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,440
It seems only yesterday...

202
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:46,760
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

203
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,360
Here we are.

204
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,040
Give it a wave.

205
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,680
Apparently not.

206
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,920
Perhaps...

207
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,600
...this.

208
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,800
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

209
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,280
I wonder...

210
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,960
Curious.

211
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,960
Very curious.

212
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,680
Sorry, but what's curious?

213
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,960
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

214
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,800
It so happens that the phoenix...

215
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,720
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

216
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,880
Just one other.

217
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,280
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

218
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:49,440
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

219
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,360
And who owned that wand?

220
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,120
We do not speak his name.

221
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,680
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

222
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,920
It's not always clear why.

223
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,480
But I think it is clear...

224
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,440
...that we can expect
great things from you.

225
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,760
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

226
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,520
...did great things.

227
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,880
Terrible...

228
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,720
...yes, but great.

229
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,720
Harry! Harry!

230
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,720
Happy birthday.

231
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,560
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

232
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:49,120
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

233
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,320
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

234
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,880
First, and understand this
because it's very important:

235
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,520
Not all wizards are good.

236
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,120
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

237
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,120
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V...

238
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,800
- His name was V...
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

239
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,800
No, I can't spell it.

240
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,600
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

241
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,560
It was dark times, Harry.

242
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,280
<i>Voldemort started
to gather some followers.</i>

243
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,800
<i>Brought them over to the Dark Side.</i>

244
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,880
<i>Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.</i>

245
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,000
<i>Your parents fought against him.</i>

246
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,360
<i>But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.</i>

247
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,520
<i>Nobody, not one.</i>

248
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,520
<i>Except you.</i>

249
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,120
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

250
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,400
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

251
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,120
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

252
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,680
What happened to V...?
To You-Know-Who?

253
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,120
Well, some say he died.

254
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,640
Codswallop, in my opinion.

255
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,960
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

256
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,000
...too tired to carry on.

257
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,440
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

258
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,960
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

259
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,200
You're the boy who lived.

260
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,760
What are you looking at?

261
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,840
Blimey, is that the time?

262
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,880
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his...

263
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,760
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

264
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,600
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.

265
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,000
"Platform 9 3/4?"

266
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,800
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3/4.

267
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,720
There's no such thing, is there?

268
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,720
Sorry.

269
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,560
Excuse me. Excuse me.

270
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,280
On your left.

271
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,120
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 3/4?

272
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,760
Think you're being funny, do you?

273
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,400
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles.

274
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,360
- Muggles?
- Platform 9 3/4, this way.

275
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,840
All right, Percy, you first.

276
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,040
Fred, you next.

277
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,800
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?

278
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,400
I'm sorry, George.

279
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,680
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

280
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,040
Excuse me.

281
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,920
Could you tell me how to...?

282
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,520
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

283
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,080
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

284
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,960
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

285
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,000
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

286
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,800
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

287
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,640
Not at all.

288
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,440
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

289
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,280
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

290
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,440
So it's true!

291
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,680
I mean, do you really have the...?

292
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,160
- The what?
- The scar?

293
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,320
Wicked!

294
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,640
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

295
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,720
We'll take the lot.

296
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:56,280
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

297
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,720
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...

298
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,600
...spinach, liver and tripe.

299
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,320
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.

300
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,400
- Are they real frogs?
- It's a spell. You want the cards.

301
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:24,080
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

302
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,000
Watch it!

303
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,560
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

304
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:40,080
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

305
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,720
Hey, he's gone!

306
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,640
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

307
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,840
This is Scabbers.
Pathetic, isn't he?

308
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,160
A little.

309
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,560
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

310
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,240
Yeah.

311
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,920
Has anyone seen a toad?

312
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,040
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

313
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,200
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

314
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,600
<i>Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow</i>

315
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,280
<i>Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow</i>

316
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,800
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

317
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,120
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

318
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,360
...but they've all worked for me.

319
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,440
For example:

320
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,840
<i>Oculus Reparo.</i>

321
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,760
That's better, isn't it?

322
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,720
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

323
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,840
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

324
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,120
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

325
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:05,720
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

326
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,480
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

327
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,080
Just there.

328
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,040
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

329
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,760
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

330
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,640
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.

331
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,520
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

332
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,080
Wicked.

333
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,720
Welcome to Hogwarts.

334
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,760
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

335
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,800
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

336
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,000
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

337
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,680
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

338
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:26,120
While you're here, your house
will be like your family.

339
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,680
Your triumphs will earn you points.

340
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,840
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

341
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:39,160
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points wins the house cup.

342
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,120
Trevor!

343
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,720
Sorry.

344
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,800
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

345
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,400
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

346
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,120
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

347
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,080
Harry Potter?

348
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,840
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

349
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,360
And I'm Malfoy.

350
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,320
Draco Malfoy.

351
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,120
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

352
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:23,560
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

353
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,640
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

354
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,480
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

355
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,280
I can help you there.

356
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,080
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

357
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,600
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

358
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,360
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.

359
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,840
I read about it
in "Hogwarts, A History".

360
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,920
Will you wait along here, please?

361
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,800
Now, before we begin...

362
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,120
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

363
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,080
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

364
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,400
The first years, please note...

365
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:48,400
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

366
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,880
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

367
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:58,600
...that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

368
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,960
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

369
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,560
Thank you.

370
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,640
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

371
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,320
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

372
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,600
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

373
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Hermione Granger.

374
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,160
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

375
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,120
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

376
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,560
Right, then. Right.

377
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,720
Okay. Gryffindor!

378
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,840
Draco Malfoy.

379
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,520
Slytherin!

380
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,520
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

381
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,680
Susan Bones.

382
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,440
Harry, what is it?

383
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,280
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

384
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,880
Let's see...

385
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:26,760
I know! Hufflepuff!

386
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,760
Ronald Weasley.

387
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,800
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

388
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,720
Gryffindor!

389
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,080
Harry Potter.

390
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,760
Difficult, very difficult.

391
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,760
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

392
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,160
There's talent, oh, yes.

393
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,040
And a thirst to prove yourself.

394
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,680
But where to put you?

395
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,320
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

396
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,000
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

397
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,880
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

398
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:48,320
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.

399
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,960
No? Well, if you're sure.

400
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,840
Better be...

401
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,440
...Gryffindor!

402
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,600
Your attention, please.

403
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,160
Let the feast begin.

404
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,360
I'm half and half.

405
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,680
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

406
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,000
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

407
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,960
Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

408
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,160
Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

409
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,200
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

410
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:10,280
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

411
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,360
Hello! How are you?

412
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,320
Welcome to Gryffindor.

413
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,400
It's the Bloody Baron!

414
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,000
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

415
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:44,920
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

416
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,120
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

417
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,960
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

418
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,640
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

419
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,240
Like this.

420
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,000
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.

421
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:15,400
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

422
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,800
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

423
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:24,520
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

424
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:37,320
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

425
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,080
That picture's moving.

426
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,160
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

427
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,560
- Look!
- Who's that girl?

428
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,720
Welcome to Hogwarts.

429
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,320
Password?

430
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,720
Caput Draconis.

431
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,880
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

432
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,800
Gather around here.

433
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,080
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

434
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:35,520
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.

435
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,240
Your belongings have
already been brought up.

436
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,680
Made it!

437
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,640
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

438
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,000
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.

439
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,320
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

440
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,600
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

441
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:12,840
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

442
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,600
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

443
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:28,320
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

444
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,080
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

445
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,920
However, for those select few...

446
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,840
...who possess the predisposition...

447
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,000
...I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

448
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,000
...and ensnare the senses.

449
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,640
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

450
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:59,040
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

451
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,080
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts with abilities...

452
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:12,000
...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

453
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,560
...to not pay attention.

454
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,200
Mr. Potter.

455
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,600
Our new celebrity.

456
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:37,240
What would I get if I added root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

457
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,160
You don't know? Let's try again.

458
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,840
Where would you look
if I asked you to find a bezoar?

459
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,440
I don't know, sir.

460
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,840
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

461
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,760
I don't know, sir.

462
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,720
Pity.

463
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,400
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

464
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,800
...is it, Mr. Potter?

465
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:16,720
<i>Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum</i>

466
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,520
<i>Eye of rabbit...</i>

467
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,320
What's Seamus trying to do
to the water?

468
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:27,560
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before...

469
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,840
Mail's here.

470
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,640
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

471
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,000
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

472
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:19,640
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

473
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,120
The problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

474
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,600
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

475
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,360
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...

476
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:36,040
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken."

477
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:41,720
"The vault in question, number 713,
had been emptied earlier that same day."

478
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:47,520
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

479
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,160
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

480
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,080
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

481
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,640
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

482
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,600
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.

483
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:14,160
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up".

484
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,280
Up!

485
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,640
Up.

486
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,120
Up.

487
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,760
Up. Up!

488
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,400
With feeling.

489
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,280
Shut up, Harry.

490
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,920
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

491
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,120
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

492
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:50,080
When I blow my whistle, I want you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

493
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,960
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

494
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,320
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

495
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:03,040
On my whistle. Three, two...

496
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,680
Mr. Longbottom.

497
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,360
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

498
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,280
Neville!

499
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:21,400
Come back down this instant!

500
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,480
Everyone out of the way!

501
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,520
Is he all right?

502
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:04,200
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

503
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,880
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.

504
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,600
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

505
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:17,840
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.

506
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,880
Did you see his face?

507
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,760
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.

508
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,960
Give it here, Malfoy.

509
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:32,240
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

510
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,000
How about on the roof?

511
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,400
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

512
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,960
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

513
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,040
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

514
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,600
What an idiot.

515
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,680
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

516
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,440
Is that so?

517
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,640
Have it your way, then.

518
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,000
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

519
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,880
Harry Potter!

520
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,520
Follow me.

521
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,880
You wait here.

522
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:07,120
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

523
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,600
Yes, of course.

524
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:21,560
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

525
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,440
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

526
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,000
I always knew he'd do well.

527
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:32,080
Seeker? But first years
never make the house teams.

528
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:36,600
- You must be the youngest player in...
- A century, McGonagall says.

529
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,320
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

530
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,920
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

531
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,680
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

532
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,440
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.

533
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,440
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.

534
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,320
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

535
00:57:55,560 --> 00:58:00,920
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

536
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,400
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?

537
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:10,720
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

538
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,680
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

539
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,520
I didn't know.

540
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:32,720
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

541
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,800
Who doesn't?

542
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,040
What's happening?

543
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:43,800
The staircases change, remember?

544
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:53,320
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

545
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,440
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

546
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,680
We're not supposed to be here.

547
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,560
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

548
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,800
Let's go.

549
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,680
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

550
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:24,520
Quick, let's hide through that door!

551
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,880
- It's locked!
- We're done for!

552
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,880
Move over!

553
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,760
<i>Alohomora.</i>

554
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,800
Get in.

555
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,040
"Alohomora?"

556
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,680
<i>Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.</i>

557
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:47,640
Anyone here, my sweet?

558
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,720
Come on.

559
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,320
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.

560
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:01,520
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

561
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:29,880
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?

562
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,600
Didn't you see what
it was standing on?

563
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:37,800
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.

564
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,760
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

565
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,480
It was standing on a trap door.
It wasn't there by accident.

566
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,280
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

567
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:52,080
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

568
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,760
...before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.

569
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,480
Or worse, expelled.

570
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:07,680
She needs to sort out her priorities.

571
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,640
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

572
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:21,840
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

573
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:29,160
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

574
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:35,080
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.

575
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:39,480
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

576
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:45,480
I think so. What are those?

577
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,760
You better take this.

578
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,080
Careful now, it's coming back.

579
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,880
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

580
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,040
What was that?

581
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,840
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

582
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:37,920
But you are a Seeker.

583
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:44,280
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

584
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,880
The Golden Snitch.

585
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,960
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

586
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:54,000
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

587
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,080
What do I do with it?

588
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:59,440
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

589
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,000
You catch this, the game's over.

590
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:07,520
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

591
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:19,800
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

592
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,800
...or the ability to make objects fly.

593
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,360
Do you have your feathers? Good.

594
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:31,480
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

595
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:35,200
The swish and flick. Everyone.

596
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:41,280
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

597
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:46,400
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.</i>

598
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,040
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

599
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:53,000
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

600
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,280
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

601
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:05,560
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's "Leviosa", not "Leviosar".

602
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,800
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

603
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:15,480
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

604
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:26,560
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

605
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,880
Splendid!

606
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,520
Well done, dear.

607
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:41,480
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.

608
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:50,320
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."

609
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:56,080
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

610
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:00,240
I think she heard you.

611
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,200
Where's Hermione?

612
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,400
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.

613
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:37,040
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

614
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:43,320
Troll in the dungeon!

615
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:48,240
Troll in the dungeon!

616
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,160
Thought you ought to know.

617
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:02,480
Silence!

618
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:06,800
Everyone will please not panic!

619
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,520
Now...

620
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:13,560
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

621
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:19,880
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

622
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

623
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,880
How could a troll get in?

624
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:39,040
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

625
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:44,600
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

626
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:59,320
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

627
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:05,120
It's going into the girls' bathroom.

628
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,160
Hermione, move!

629
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:44,360
Help! Help!

630
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:48,280
Hey, pea brain!

631
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,000
Help!

632
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:24,200
Do something!

633
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:28,600
- What?
- Anything!

634
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,120
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

635
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:35,080
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

636
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:47,480
Cool.

637
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,080
Is it dead?

638
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:17,560
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

639
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,800
Troll boogers.

640
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:30,080
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

641
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:36,240
- Well, what it is...
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

642
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,600
Miss Granger?

643
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:43,680
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

644
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,680
But I was wrong.

645
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:51,480
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

646
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:55,920
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

647
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:01,560
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

648
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,640
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

649
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,520
...for your serious lack of judgment.

650
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,640
As for you two gentlemen...

651
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,120
...I just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

652
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:17,600
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

653
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,360
...and live to tell the tale.

654
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,000
Five points...

655
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:28,720
...will be awarded to each of you...

656
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:33,200
...for sheer dumb luck.

657
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:42,160
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

658
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,800
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

659
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,080
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

660
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,760
I'm not hungry.

661
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,360
Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.

662
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,600
A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.

663
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:10,320
Even if it is against Slytherin.

664
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,640
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

665
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,800
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

666
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,560
...so he could get past that dog.

667
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,440
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.

668
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,200
But why would anyone go near that dog?

669
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,520
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

670
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,840
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

671
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,120
You're saying...

672
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:46,160
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

673
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:01,360
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

674
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,560
Let's open it.

675
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,560
It's a broomstick.

676
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:19,920
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

677
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,600
But who...?

678
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,240
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

679
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,960
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

680
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,600
- What happened?
- I don't really remember.

681
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,360
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

682
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,800
Woke up in hospital a week later.

683
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,800
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

684
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:29,040
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

685
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,920
The players take their positions...

686
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,760
...as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!

687
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,560
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

688
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,600
...from all of you!

689
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,800
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

690
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,600
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

691
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:24,960
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

692
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:34,800
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

693
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:57,320
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

694
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,520
Well done!

695
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:13,200
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

696
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:46,600
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

697
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:01,640
Give me that!

698
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:34,320
Take that side!

699
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:24,880
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

700
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:34,040
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

701
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:39,960
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

702
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,320
Come on, Hermione!

703
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:19,440
<i>Lacarnum Inflamarae.</i>

704
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:29,160
Fire! You're on fire!

705
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,360
Go, go, go, go!

706
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:39,800
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

707
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:41,400
He's got the Snitch!

708
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:45,520
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

709
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,840
Gryffindor wins!

710
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:33,200
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

711
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:37,160
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

712
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,680
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

713
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:43,400
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he has a name. He's mine.

714
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:48,680
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard...

715
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:53,640
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

716
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:57,680
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

717
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,480
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

718
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:06,560
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

719
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,200
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

720
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:13,000
Exactly.

721
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,840
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

722
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:20,520
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

723
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:25,600
What that dog is guarding is
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

724
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,920
Nicholas Flamel?

725
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:32,640
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

726
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,760
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

727
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,400
I don't know.

728
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,720
<i>Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas</i>

729
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:02,600
<i>Ring the Hogwart bell</i>

730
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,480
<i>Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas</i>

731
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:10,000
<i>Cast a Christmas spell</i>

732
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:26,240
Knight to e5.

733
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:35,680
Queen to e5.

734
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,320
That's totally barbaric!

735
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,920
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

736
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,680
I see you haven't.

737
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:51,800
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

738
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:55,680
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry.

739
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,120
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.

740
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:03,080
We've looked a hundred times!

741
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:09,840
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

742
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:14,760
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

743
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:21,360
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

744
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:32,480
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

745
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:35,160
What are you wearing?

746
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:39,800
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

747
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:43,840
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

748
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:52,960
There they are.

749
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:05,400
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

750
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:11,080
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

751
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:29,320
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

752
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:33,840
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

753
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:38,760
My body's gone!

754
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,720
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

755
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,000
I'm invisible?

756
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:49,680
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

757
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:56,000
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well".

758
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:27,040
<i>Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.</i>

759
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:34,360
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

760
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:54,240
Who's there?

761
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:05,520
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

762
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:16,200
Who is it? Show yourself.

763
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,680
Severus, I...

764
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:05,600
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

765
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:11,840
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

766
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,920
We'll have another little chat soon.

767
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:35,400
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

768
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:40,160
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

769
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:46,720
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

770
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:16,800
Mum?

771
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:21,840
Dad?

772
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:59,920
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

773
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,920
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

774
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:08,080
- Why?
- There's something you've got to see!

775
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:18,320
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

776
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,440
I only see us.

777
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,840
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

778
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:30,000
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

779
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:32,480
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

780
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:37,560
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

781
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,520
I look good.

782
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:44,400
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

783
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:50,880
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

784
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:15,160
Back again, Harry?

785
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:19,000
I see that you,
like many before you...

786
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:23,320
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

787
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:28,560
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

788
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,520
Let me give you a clue.

789
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,760
The happiest man on earth...

790
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,200
...would look in the mirror
and see only himself...

791
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,640
...exactly as he is.

792
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:44,680
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

793
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:48,320
Yes. And no.

794
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,880
It shows us nothing more or less...

795
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:56,800
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

796
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:01,520
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

797
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:05,440
...you see them standing beside you.

798
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:08,000
But remember this, Harry.

799
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:13,840
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

800
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:16,800
...or truth.

801
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:23,600
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

802
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:27,760
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

803
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,520
And I must ask you...

804
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:34,960
...not to go looking for it again.

805
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,520
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

806
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:43,000
...and forget to live.

807
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:39,440
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

808
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:42,600
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

809
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:46,240
This is light?

810
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:51,440
Of course! Here it is!

811
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:55,520
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

812
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,280
The what?

813
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,360
Honestly, don't you two read?

814
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:04,880
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers."

815
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:07,600
"It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

816
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:11,640
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

817
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:13,920
- Immortal?
- It means you'll never die.

818
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:16,760
I know what it means!

819
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,480
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

820
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:28,160
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

821
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,360
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

822
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:36,600
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

823
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:54,800
Don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no state to entertain.

824
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:59,120
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

825
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:07,040
- We think Snape's trying to steal it.
- Are you still on about him?

826
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,080
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.

827
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:14,320
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.

828
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:15,520
What?

829
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,000
You heard. Come on,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

830
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:21,760
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers?"

831
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,680
There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

832
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,440
- Spells, enchantments.
- Right.

833
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:31,560
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

834
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,760
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

835
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,520
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

836
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:42,680
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

837
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:59,360
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's...

838
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,480
I know what that is!

839
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:04,360
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

840
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,680
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

841
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:13,320
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

842
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,800
Is that...

843
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,120
...a dragon?

844
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:41,560
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

845
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:44,520
My brother works
with these in Romania.

846
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:49,840
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

847
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:51,840
Hello, Norbert.

848
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:56,680
- Norbert?
- He's gotta have a name, don't he?

849
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:00,760
Don't you, Norbert?

850
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:10,440
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

851
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:16,160
Who's that?

852
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,800
Malfoy.

853
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,880
Oh, dear.

854
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:26,600
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.

855
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:30,680
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

856
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:34,880
- I don't understand. Is that bad?
- It's bad.

857
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:38,680
Good evening.

858
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:43,480
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

859
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:47,040
...gives a student the right
to walk about at night.

860
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:51,920
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

861
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:55,160
- 50?!
- Each.

862
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,640
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

863
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:01,720
...all four of you
will receive detention.

864
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:04,760
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

865
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,200
I thought you said the four of us.

866
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,800
No, you heard me correctly.

867
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:15,040
Honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

868
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:19,600
You will join your classmates
in detention.

869
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:32,680
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

870
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:37,400
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

871
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:41,840
God, I miss the screaming.

872
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,920
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

873
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:52,760
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

874
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:57,280
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

875
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:03,800
Good God, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

876
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,760
Norbert's gone.

877
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,440
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

878
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:13,720
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.

879
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:16,160
What if he don't like Romania?

880
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:20,840
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.

881
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:26,080
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.

882
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,560
Got to have your wits about you.

883
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:34,440
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

884
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:39,840
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

885
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,200
...werewolves.

886
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,560
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.

887
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,840
You can be sure of that.

888
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:52,080
Nighty-night.

889
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:57,280
Right. Let's go.

890
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:34,720
Hagrid, what is that?

891
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:38,440
What we're here for.
See that?

892
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:44,120
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

893
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:50,240
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

894
01:40:55,960 --> 01:41:01,440
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

895
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:04,880
Ron, Hermione, come with me.

896
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:09,240
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

897
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,600
Okay. Then I get Fang.

898
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:18,840
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

899
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:25,640
Wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

900
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:29,600
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.

901
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:33,160
I'm not scared, Potter.

902
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:36,760
Do you hear that?

903
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:39,040
Come on, Fang.

904
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:42,200
Scared!

905
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:08,240
What is it, Fang?

906
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:19,480
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

907
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:23,520
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

908
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:26,360
What was that thing you saved me from?

909
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:31,680
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

910
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:37,200
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.

911
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:42,280
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...

912
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:47,120
...that the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

913
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:49,040
A cursed life.

914
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:53,040
- Who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

915
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:58,120
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...

916
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:02,080
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

917
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:07,840
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?

918
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:10,600
The Philosopher's Stone.

919
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:13,080
Harry!

920
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:17,600
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

921
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:20,760
You all right there, Harry?

922
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,720
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

923
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:31,120
You're safe now. Good luck.

924
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:40,880
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

925
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,760
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

926
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,760
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

927
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:51,160
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants it for Voldemort.

928
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:55,720
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

929
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:57,440
He'll come back.

930
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:59,360
But if he comes back...

931
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:04,120
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

932
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:07,720
If he'd had the chance,
he might have tried tonight.

933
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:11,360
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

934
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:15,160
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

935
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:20,560
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

936
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:25,680
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

937
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:31,280
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

938
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:40,480
I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were
frightful, but I found that enjoyable.

939
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:44,200
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

940
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:49,360
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

941
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:52,120
- Not like this.
- You should see the nurse.

942
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:57,200
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

943
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,360
- Of course!
- What is it?

944
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:09,160
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

945
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:12,320
...and a stranger just happens
to have one?

946
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,080
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?

947
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:18,960
Why didn't I see it before?

948
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:26,160
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

949
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:29,000
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

950
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:32,040
You and this stranger
must have talked.

951
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:35,640
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

952
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:39,680
I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem".

953
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:44,360
- Was he interested in Fluffy?
- Of course he was interested.

954
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:48,560
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?

955
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:54,160
But I told him, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him".

956
01:46:54,400 --> 01:47:01,120
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.

957
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:03,800
I shouldn't have told you that.

958
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:07,640
Where are you going?

959
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:15,720
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

960
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:18,440
I'm afraid he's not here.

961
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:22,960
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.

962
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:25,640
He's gone?
But this is important!

963
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:29,480
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

964
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:33,760
- How do you know...?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

965
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,960
I don't know how you know,
but I assure you it is well protected.

966
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:44,800
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

967
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:53,920
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.

968
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:56,680
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

969
01:47:56,920 --> 01:48:02,120
- And with Dumbledore gone...
- Good afternoon.

970
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:05,560
What would three young Gryffindors...

971
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:11,400
...be doing inside on a day like this?

972
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:18,160
- We were just...
- You ought to be careful.

973
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:21,760
People will think you're...

974
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:28,480
...up to something.

975
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:38,760
Now what do we do?

976
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:44,080
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

977
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:57,280
Trevor.

978
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:00,800
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

979
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:06,200
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

980
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:10,240
- Neville, listen. We were...
- No, I won't let you!

981
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:14,840
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

982
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:20,680
<i>Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.</i>

983
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:30,480
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

984
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:34,600
Brilliant, but scary.

985
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:36,760
Let's go.

986
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:42,560
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

987
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:51,560
- You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

988
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:57,240
<i>Alohomora.</i>

989
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:10,680
Wait a minute. He's...

990
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:14,480
...snoring.

991
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:22,200
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

992
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:26,600
It's got horrible breath.

993
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,560
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

994
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:32,640
Come on!

995
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:38,520
Okay. Push.

996
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:02,680
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

997
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:08,240
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

998
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:12,240
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

999
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:14,640
The harp.

1000
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:18,960
It's stopped playing.

1001
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:29,680
Jump!

1002
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:46,760
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1003
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:02,040
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1004
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:05,800
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1005
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:12,320
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1006
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,600
Hermione!

1007
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:18,440
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

1008
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:24,480
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

1009
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:32,960
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1010
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:36,080
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

1011
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:38,720
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

1012
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:42,360
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1013
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:46,240
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

1014
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:50,680
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.

1015
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:54,360
<i>Lumus Solem.</i>

1016
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:04,600
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

1017
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:08,560
Lucky we didn't panic.

1018
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:13,640
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1019
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:15,120
What is that?

1020
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:20,400
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1021
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:34,800
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

1022
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:38,480
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1023
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:43,520
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1024
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:51,280
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

1025
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,560
Strange.

1026
01:53:57,800 --> 01:54:01,480
"Alohomora!"

1027
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:04,960
Well, it was worth a try.

1028
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:08,280
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

1029
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:12,240
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

1030
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:17,240
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1031
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:22,040
What's wrong?

1032
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:23,680
It's too simple.

1033
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:28,440
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1034
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:33,560
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1035
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:52,600
This complicates things a bit.

1036
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:14,840
Catch the key!

1037
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:20,920
Hurry up!

1038
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:55,040
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1039
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:58,440
Where are we? A graveyard.

1040
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:02,680
This is no graveyard.

1041
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:12,680
It's a chessboard.

1042
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:26,000
There's the door.

1043
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:37,640
Now what do we do?

1044
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:42,160
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1045
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:46,080
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1046
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:50,360
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1047
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:55,960
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1048
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:03,520
What happens now?

1049
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:06,600
Well, white moves first.

1050
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:10,120
And then...

1051
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:13,000
...we play.

1052
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:26,520
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1053
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:30,280
...real wizard's chess, do you?

1054
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:34,840
You there, d5.

1055
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:48,840
Yes, Hermione.

1056
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:55,440
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1057
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:03,520
Castle to e4!

1058
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:09,200
Pawn to c3!

1059
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:54,360
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

1060
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:59,480
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1061
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:01,920
Then you're free to check the king.

1062
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:05,120
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

1063
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:09,800
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, there must be another way!

1064
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:13,600
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1065
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:17,520
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1066
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:21,880
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1067
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:34,520
Knight to h3.

1068
01:59:53,120 --> 01:59:56,520
Check.

1069
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:24,680
Ron!

1070
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:31,960
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1071
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:47,640
Checkmate.

1072
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,640
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1073
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:11,560
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1074
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:13,840
I have to go on.

1075
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:19,720
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1076
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:22,920
Not as good as you.

1077
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:28,720
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1078
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:35,840
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1079
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:13,000
You?

1080
02:02:13,240 --> 02:02:16,880
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the...

1081
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:20,000
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1082
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:23,200
Next to him, who would suspect...

1083
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:27,160
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1084
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:32,520
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1085
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:35,680
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1086
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:39,880
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1087
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:42,200
...I would have succeeded.

1088
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:45,280
Even with Snape muttering
his countercurse.

1089
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:47,600
Snape was trying to save me?

1090
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:52,920
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.

1091
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:57,200
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

1092
02:02:57,440 --> 02:03:00,640
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1093
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:06,280
While everyone ran about,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1094
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:10,600
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1095
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:15,840
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1096
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:19,920
I'm never alone. Never.

1097
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:25,560
Now, what does this mirror do?

1098
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:27,920
I see what I desire.

1099
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:32,360
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

1100
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:35,200
Use the boy.

1101
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:40,680
Come here, Potter! Now!

1102
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:56,120
Tell me, what do you see?

1103
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:21,040
What is it? What do you see?

1104
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:26,200
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1105
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:28,160
He lies.

1106
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:31,920
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1107
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:36,360
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

1108
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:41,920
I have strength enough for this.

1109
02:04:57,880 --> 02:05:00,600
Harry Potter...

1110
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:03,040
...we meet again.

1111
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:04,600
Voldemort.

1112
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:08,640
Yes. You see what I've become?

1113
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:12,280
See what I must do to survive?

1114
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:16,880
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1115
02:05:17,120 --> 02:05:20,280
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1116
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:24,000
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1117
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:27,600
But there is something that can.

1118
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:33,400
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1119
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:36,600
Stop him!

1120
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:42,840
Don't be a fool.

1121
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:46,040
Why suffer an horrific death...

1122
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:49,720
...when you can join me and live?

1123
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:52,480
Never!

1124
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:58,000
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1125
02:05:58,240 --> 02:06:01,400
Tell me, Harry...

1126
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:05,360
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1127
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:07,560
Together...

1128
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:10,400
...we can bring them back.

1129
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:16,640
All I ask is for something in return.

1130
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:25,200
That's it, Harry.

1131
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:29,120
There is no good and evil.

1132
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:32,200
There is only power...

1133
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:36,800
...and those too weak to seek it.

1134
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:42,040
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

1135
02:06:42,280 --> 02:06:45,920
Just give me the Stone!

1136
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,040
You liar!

1137
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:51,800
Kill him!

1138
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:19,480
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

1139
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:02,840
Good afternoon, Harry.

1140
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:07,680
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

1141
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:13,640
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.

1142
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:19,960
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1143
02:09:20,720 --> 02:09:24,160
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1144
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:27,080
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1145
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:30,160
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?

1146
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:35,400
Fine. They're both just fine.

1147
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:38,400
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

1148
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:41,360
The Stone has been destroyed.

1149
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:45,600
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1150
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:49,600
...and agreed it was best all around.

1151
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:55,000
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1152
02:09:55,480 --> 02:10:00,720
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1153
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:04,000
But yes, he will die.

1154
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:06,560
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1155
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:09,200
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and...

1156
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:13,400
You see, only a person...

1157
02:10:13,640 --> 02:10:17,400
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1158
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:22,680
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1159
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:26,240
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1160
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:32,480
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1161
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:37,680
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1162
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:41,280
I'm afraid...

1163
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:45,840
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1164
02:10:46,080 --> 02:10:48,520
Harry, do you know why...

1165
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:52,560
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1166
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:57,520
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1167
02:10:57,760 --> 02:11:00,800
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1168
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:04,640
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1169
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:10,160
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

1170
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:15,480
Love, Harry. Love.

1171
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:25,640
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1172
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:30,360
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1173
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:33,720
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.

1174
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:37,160
But I think I could be safe...

1175
02:11:37,400 --> 02:11:41,160
...with a nice toffee.

1176
02:11:43,600 --> 02:11:45,520
Alas!

1177
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:49,280
Earwax.

1178
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:06,280
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

1179
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:09,520
All right. Hermione?

1180
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:13,000
Never better.

1181
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:29,520
Another year gone.

1182
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:34,080
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1183
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:36,800
And the points stand thus:

1184
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:44,080
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1185
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:51,400
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1186
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:56,680
In second place...

1187
02:12:56,920 --> 02:13:03,000
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1188
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:08,680
And in first place...

1189
02:13:08,920 --> 02:13:15,600
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1190
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:23,080
Nice one, mate.

1191
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:29,200
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.

1192
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:33,520
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1193
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:38,880
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1194
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:44,360
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1195
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:47,720
...while others were in grave peril...

1196
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:50,760
...50 points.

1197
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,720
Good job.

1198
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:05,680
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1199
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:12,440
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1200
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:17,640
And third...

1201
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:20,600
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1202
02:14:20,840 --> 02:14:25,280
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1203
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:31,680
...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1204
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:39,960
We're tied with Slytherin!

1205
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:45,920
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1206
02:14:46,160 --> 02:14:49,840
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1207
02:14:50,080 --> 02:14:52,880
I award 10 points...

1208
02:14:53,120 --> 02:14:57,680
...to Neville Longbottom.

1209
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,240
Assuming that my calculations
are correct...

1210
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:18,320
...I believe that a change
of decoration is in order.

1211
02:15:21,680 --> 02:15:26,400
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1212
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:04,560
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1213
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:10,400
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1214
02:16:14,120 --> 02:16:18,760
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

1215
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:28,360
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1216
02:16:29,960 --> 02:16:33,200
This is for you.

1217
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:51,320
Thanks, Hagrid.

1218
02:16:55,440 --> 02:16:59,840
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1219
02:17:00,080 --> 02:17:04,360
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1220
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:07,120
...you could always threaten him...

1221
02:17:07,360 --> 02:17:10,080
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.

1222
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:15,400
But we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1223
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:21,280
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1224
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:28,040
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1225
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:30,240
I'm not going home.

1226
02:17:30,480 --> 02:17:33,800
Not really.

1227
02:17:47,144 --> 02:17:52,634
Thanks: SDI Media Group
