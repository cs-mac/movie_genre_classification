1
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:47,961
This story is based
faith.

2
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:52,282
Faith makes the impossible
occurs.

3
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:56,482
Faith makes the impossible
possible.

4
00:00:57,322 --> 00:01:02,922
One of those stories intended
by the sound of faith.

5
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:44,245
Here are your 10 rupees ...
Hey! Where are you going?

6
00:01:44,685 --> 00:01:48,326
Give me that bribery o'hare

7
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:50,205
Put some money or will lose
your work.

8
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:57,887
Put it there.

9
00:02:13,128 --> 00:02:16,367
Karan Singh and Arjun Singh,
put my bribe.

10
00:02:17,648 --> 00:02:21,569
- We do not descuestes today.
- What's special about today?

11
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:24,809
- That's a secret.
- What secret?

12
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:28,409
- We'll tell you later.
- We do not take out 2 rupees.

13
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:31,049
We'll give you all pay
tomorrow.

14
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:37,610
Oh, yeah? I trust units. that
They are the sons of Durga.

15
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:40,129
But tomorrow will repent.

16
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,090
Tomorrow, 20 rupees for me!

17
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,170
Father, tomorrow is Sunday.
No works.

18
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:48,131
Goodbye!

19
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,211
Art thou fallen from heaven, man?

20
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,891
Forget that. Tell me how
Bangles cost.

21
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,531
Why you should buy bracelets?

22
00:02:57,892 --> 00:03:00,892
Do not worry about that. Just tell me
As the bracelets cost.

23
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:03,172
- Show me that.
- No. That green.

24
00:03:04,012 --> 00:03:06,211
- Red These bracelets.
- These golden bracelets.

25
00:03:06,972 --> 00:03:11,251
- These colorful.
- They are very beautiful.

26
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:05,816
- I win, right mom?
- No! I win!

27
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:11,617
Children are won and lost
in competition.

28
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,257
And only compete enemies.

29
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,257
- I first tap your foot.
- No! I did it!

30
00:04:18,577 --> 00:04:20,657
- I did ...!
- Stop it.

31
00:04:22,257 --> 00:04:24,257
They're still competing
between units.!

32
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,458
Neither this nor ahead ...
not from behind.

33
00:04:28,617 --> 00:04:32,178
My children are ahead
worldwide!

34
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:35,538
- Ma, we have something for you.
- What is?

35
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:37,818
- First close your eyes.
- For what?

36
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:40,338
- Close your eyes! Come on!
- Okay.

37
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,938
Open your eyes now.

38
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:51,660
Now you will use bracelets as
the other village women.

39
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,540
We can not stand to see your
hands as empty.

40
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,300
Reach out your hand breast.

41
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,141
Come on, mom.

42
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,901
No!
I can not wear those bracelets.

43
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,461
Why not?

44
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:15,941
I can not use my bracelets
old tontitos.

45
00:05:16,302 --> 00:05:17,662
I understand, mama!

46
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:20,702
She will use the bracelets only
when Dad gets back from the city.

47
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:23,342
- That's true, right?
- It's been many years.

48
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:25,622
He already would have returned,
if he wanted to.

49
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:28,423
- She forgot about us!
- We know nothing of him.

50
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:30,622
And you always wait for it!

51
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:33,783
Let's return
bracelets. We will.

52
00:05:34,163 --> 00:05:35,583
No. .. wait!:By:Mr.MAGDY

53
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:41,823
Give me those bracelets ... give it to me.

54
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:50,263
I'll give these bracelets
their wives.

55
00:05:51,744 --> 00:05:55,424
- But they were for ...
- Go to swim fast.

56
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:56,607
We have to go to the temple.

57
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:43,607
When the sun is far
the sky?

58
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:46,607
When the moon is far from
its rays?

59
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,607
When the fragrance is far
Wind?

60
00:06:49,781 --> 00:06:52,607
When spring is far
the yard?

61
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:58,607
This bond is a bond of love.

62
00:06:58,781 --> 00:07:04,607
It is the union of life after life.

63
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:10,607
This bond is a bond of love.

64
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:16,607
It is the union of life after life.

65
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:20,607
When the sun is far
the sky?

66
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:23,607
When the moon is far from
its rays?

67
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:26,607
When the fragrance is far
Wind?

68
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:29,607
When spring is far
the yard?

00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:35,607
This bond is a bond of love.

70
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:41,607
It is the union of life after life.

71
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:16,607
Only units. are my life.

72
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:20,407
Vivire only to watch them.

73
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:31,607
Vivire only to watch them.

74
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:34,607
For units ...

75
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,407
Would drink all the poison ..
world.

76
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:40,007
In your holy feet ...

77
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:43,607
'll Do that .. you all heaven
make a bow.

78
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:46,607
If there is a fire in your way ...

00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:49,607
Lieth me .. so your passes.

80

It is the union of life after life.

84
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:48,607
In the temple of motherly love ..

85
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:51,607
You are in. .. more

86
00:09:57,581 --> 00:10:00,607
In the temple of motherly love ..

00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:03,607
You are in. .. more
dear.

88
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:06,607
The image of God appears ...

89
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:09,607
... When I see your face.

90
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:12,607
When born in this
world ...

91
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:15,607
Alone ... I'll find your veil.

92
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,607
On the wall separating the
births ...

93
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:21,607
Our love ... write.

94
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:27,607
This bond is a bond of love.

95
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:33,607
It is the union of life after life.

96
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:39,607
This bond is a bond of love.

97
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:45,607
It is the union of life after life.

98
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:15,848
- Regards, ma'am.
- The counter? You?

99
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:20,689
Achieve get here very
difficulty.

100
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:24,049
If anyone saw me coming
here, my life would be in danger.

101
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:28,769
But what brings you here so late?

102
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,209
The old Thakur called you
his mansion.

103
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,569
That mansion?

104
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:39,209
In which we closed the
doors to the side of God?

105
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,890
The mansion, where the wounds
are still raw in

106
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,730
the heart?

107
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:52,452
Go. Never whereon the mansion.

108
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,811
Fulfill the last wish of a
dying man ...

109
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:59,012
Is considered the ... more
largest of the noble works.

110
00:11:59,371 --> 00:12:01,891
As ... The landlord ...?

111
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:05,852
If. The landowner is
breathing for the last time.

112
00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:08,372
His last wish is to see you.

113
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:14,612
But it makes so much damn
Durjan Singh threw his shadow there.

114
00:12:15,012 --> 00:12:17,732
How can I ever go there?

115
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:19,334
Tomorrow is the festival
Goddess Kali.

116
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:21,693
Durjan, with his brothers,
Shamsher Singh Nahar and ...

117
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:24,333
Will be in the temple ... with
their families.

118
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:26,733
Wait for you outside the
mansion.

119
00:12:27,974 --> 00:12:29,654
- Please come.
- Very good.

120
00:12:36,894 --> 00:12:40,415
- Who was that man?
- And who is the landlord?

121
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:49,215
We hide a secret
many years.

122
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:56,176
How would I know that the time,
someday, stoke your fire?

123
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,096
It is the story of my life ...

124
00:13:01,576 --> 00:13:05,856
... You always hide in
secret units.

125
00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:11,297
But today I will have to tell
truth.

126
00:13:12,137 --> 00:13:15,577
I'll tell you everything.

127
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:21,458
The landowner is his grandfather.

128
00:13:22,238 --> 00:13:22,918
That!

129
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:26,018
Our grandfather?
The landlord?

130
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:29,259
If. I'm his daughter.

131
00:13:30,658 --> 00:13:33,899
I was a poor woman. And the
father of you. she married me.

132
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:38,859
But the landlord, instigated
by Durjan Singh, his nephew ...

133
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:42,259
He ... refused to accept me as your
daughter.

134
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:46,060
They took me out of the mansion.

135
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,820
Your father found a job
in the village school.

136
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,421
We were happy in our own
world, despite our poverty.

137
00:13:57,261 --> 00:14:03,781
And the arrival of pcs. brought more
happiness and joy to our lives.

138
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,701
But our happiness soon
he became pain.

139
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:14,422
Durjan Singh dreamed of inheriting
the wealth of the family.

140
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:18,342
And one night,
pure treason ...

141
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:23,902
Durjan Singh murderer father
of you.!

142
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:28,384
That! Papa was ...

143
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:32,263
You mean that you always
what ...?

144
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:42,104
If. To keep this
secret, make up a story.

145
00:14:42,504 --> 00:14:48,624
I did not want you guys. feel
orphans.

146
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:58,944
How would I know that my past
golperia one day at my door?

147
00:14:59,905 --> 00:15:04,025
I should go to the mansion
always detest!

148
00:15:04,306 --> 00:15:09,506
No. We're not going to the mansion
fit our father!

149
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:12,945
If. No there will tread ...

150
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:16,947
You ... that sank into poverty
and despair.

151
00:15:17,947 --> 00:15:22,386
I know how flames
fanning hatred ...

152
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:25,987
... When one remembers the
humiliation he has suffered.

153
00:15:26,587 --> 00:15:31,587
But always teach them
lessons of love and compassion.

154
00:15:31,868 --> 00:15:33,268
Do not hate.

155
00:15:34,787 --> 00:15:38,108
Hate only makes the
man and society coming apart.

156
00:15:39,348 --> 00:15:42,268
Hate is the shadow of the devil,
my children.

157
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:44,508
It is the shadow of the devil!

158
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:21,391
Gloria Goddess Kali!

159
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:28,691
Gloria Goddess Kali!

160
00:16:36,731 --> 00:16:42,691
Gloria Goddess Kali!

161
00:16:58,474 --> 00:17:00,274
Welcome, lady ...

162
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:04,554
The landlord was talking
on pc. since morning.

163
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:07,915
He longs to see Karan and Arjun.

164
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,315
Welcome, daughter.

165
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:14,915
Please do not touch me ... I'm
a sinner!

166
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:21,756
No, father. What happened was
part of our destiny.

167
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:27,436
No. It was my arrogance that
dampened your destination.

168
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:31,557
Lanze my own blood in
flames of misfortune.

169
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:34,797
I must be severely punished.

170
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:38,756
A terrible death that no
sinner has even suffered!

171
00:17:39,677 --> 00:17:41,718
Do not say that.

172
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:46,918
Ointment every time heals
wound inflicted by life.

173
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:51,477
Before dying, only once ..

174
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:54,518
No ondary me the right to
hug?

175
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:58,999
Right? Our lives are
for you.

176
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:01,199
Karan and Arjun are their children.

177
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,719
Let my children.

178
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:10,919
My children!

179
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:13,279
I'm really unhappy.

180
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,280
I could not play with pcs.

181
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,521
We will return the right
snatch.

182
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:33,081
You are now this lady
mansion.

183
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:38,442
And your children are heirs.

184
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:40,682
Take this.

185
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:48,043
The body becomes useless in
old age.

186
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:51,842
But you ruined your life!

188
00:18:57,122 --> 00:18:59,643
I did not come to this mansion
to go!

189
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:02,843
Every brick of this house is
mio!

190
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,723
We service all your life!

191
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:11,324
Eat? You tried to kill me
at every turn!

192
00:19:12,165 --> 00:19:13,565
But no mori me.

193
00:19:14,204 --> 00:19:18,365
Because I have a debt to pay,
give these guys your right!

194
00:19:18,685 --> 00:19:22,285
I will not give them to these beggars
a penny!

195
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:28,006
Instead, you and your
I'll give family death!

196
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:31,486
No! I make this pledge.

197
00:19:33,525 --> 00:19:35,046
We want nothing!

198
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:38,686
You can have it all.
We want nothing!

199
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:40,445
What do you say?

200
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:51,046
Daughter called me and keep
close to your heart to my children.

201
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:53,967
We have all the wealth in
the world.

202
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:55,968
We want nothing more.

203
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:58,768
Let children.

204
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:10,328
Brother, you left those two
live snakes?

205
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:13,729
Snakes can show their
fangs at any time.

206
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:18,969
They are just snakes
small, they are not snakes.

207
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,730
Still do not have fangs
poisonous.

208
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:24,769
Their father was the
snake.

209
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,809
Children are dying in my
hands as the father died!

210
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:33,489
That? You killed my son?

211
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,371
If. I did it.

212
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:42,131
And their children will die too
in my hands.

213
00:20:42,651 --> 00:20:45,931
- That can not happen!
- It happened!

214
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:52,171
Because your family this
sentenced to die in my hands!

215
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,971
Look at this man!

216
00:20:56,612 --> 00:21:00,812
You see the black shadow of your
death in my palm!

217
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:23,174
Run!

218
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,894
Corran my kids!

219
00:22:10,574 --> 00:22:11,494
Arjun!

220
00:22:11,674 --> 00:22:13,594
Arjun!

221
00:22:13,774 --> 00:22:14,694
Karan!

222
00:22:14,774 --> 00:22:15,894
Karan!

223
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:20,899
Let my children!

224
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:23,659
- Let me and my Karan Arjun!
- These small snakes?

225
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:26,979
The game just begun, old.

226
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:30,059
It will be fun!

227
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:33,219
Look there, old lady!

228
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:41,340
Look there!

229
00:22:52,021 --> 00:22:54,780
Enough!

230
00:23:01,582 --> 00:23:04,381
Bit me!

231
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:14,503
Mama!

232
00:23:22,682 --> 00:23:24,622
Mama!

233
00:23:30,704 --> 00:23:31,743
You hit my mother?

234
00:23:47,064 --> 00:23:48,465
Flee!

235
00:23:55,986 --> 00:23:58,986
Spread Arjun!

236
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,506
I tell you to run!

237
00:24:02,505 --> 00:24:04,506
Karan!

238
00:25:19,272 --> 00:25:22,431
Mother! My children can not
die!

239
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:25,431
Mother! My children can not
die!

240
00:25:26,352 --> 00:25:28,753
This can not happen!

241
00:25:31,232 --> 00:25:33,472
You are also a mother.

242
00:25:34,112 --> 00:25:38,272
A mother can not destroy
the womb of another mother!

243
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:46,033
My children are the gift that I
gave your feet!

244
00:25:46,794 --> 00:25:50,954
You can not take the gift
once gave me!

245
00:25:51,474 --> 00:25:54,154
You'll have to give me back my
children!

246
00:25:55,074 --> 00:25:57,554
Give me back my children, mother!

247
00:25:58,354 --> 00:26:01,635
Give me back my children, mother!

248
00:26:03,234 --> 00:26:06,635
Give me back my children, mother!

249
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:38,198
Bid more. A little more.

250
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:26,962
He ate his mother as soon
as national!

251
00:27:27,701 --> 00:27:29,462
Now you'll eat my bottle
liquor?

252
00:27:29,762 --> 00:27:33,882
I have no money for my drink! Of
beareth money where your milk?

253
00:27:34,641 --> 00:27:36,642
Do not cry baby.

254
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:40,442
Our son will grow and be
a great man.

255
00:27:40,602 --> 00:27:43,082
Even God will feel proud
of the.

256
00:27:43,302 --> 00:27:46,483
All thanks to Pestonbhai.

257
00:27:46,823 --> 00:27:50,603
Work on your riding club and
I make my living.

258
00:27:50,763 --> 00:27:53,563
It is the Lord who does all.

259
00:27:53,663 --> 00:27:57,563
Who knows? Maybe your son
direct my riding club someday!

260
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,004
You bring alcohol?

261
00:28:06,323 --> 00:28:09,005
No. I'm hungry. Brought food.

262
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:13,645
Rogue! When you were little
crying for milk!

263
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:16,244
And now food!

264
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:19,645
- Give me some alcohol!
- No, you do not dare!

265
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:22,566
Fighting with your father?

266
00:28:24,366 --> 00:28:26,325
- Let go of my hand!
- No! First let the bag!

267
00:28:26,726 --> 00:28:28,766
Small, but has the
strength of a horse!

268
00:28:28,886 --> 00:28:31,366
- Do not will loose?
- Scoundrel!

269
00:28:40,846 --> 00:28:41,607
What happened son?

270
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:44,247
He was stealing grain
so drop it.

271
00:28:44,647 --> 00:28:47,088
Wow! That marksmanship!

272
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,492
Suddenly, that you?

273
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:44,131
Kill him?

274
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,612
Why do you hit?
The fighting for you.

275
00:29:48,051 --> 00:29:51,652
This guy told you drunk.
So Ajay hit him.

276
00:29:52,132 --> 00:29:54,133
Control your child.

277
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:58,333
All those who have no mother
end well.

278
00:29:59,853 --> 00:30:02,733
Mother ruined it ruined it, mother!

279
00:30:03,252 --> 00:30:05,653
I am with child!

280
00:30:05,752 --> 00:30:06,653
I am with child!

281
00:30:07,053 --> 00:30:09,494
- Mother ruined it!
- Doctor,'s wrong?

282
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:12,294
No need to worry.

283
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:17,094
This hallucinating.
Stop by high fever.

284
00:30:18,494 --> 00:30:21,454
Mother! Mother!

285
00:30:30,654 --> 00:30:32,016
Priest.

286
00:30:36,354 --> 00:30:37,016
Priest.

287
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:42,736
I listen? I hear?

288
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,616
My son cries for me!

289
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:50,376
They will come. My Karan and my
Arjun will return!

290
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:51,876
Lady ...

291
00:30:52,537 --> 00:30:55,657
I heard it for 20 years.

292
00:30:55,716 --> 00:30:58,458
Karan and Arjun will return.

293
00:30:59,856 --> 00:31:02,537
But this world is a place ..

294
00:31:03,098 --> 00:31:08,698
Once people destroyed
This world never more return.

295
00:31:09,178 --> 00:31:10,977
Wait and see.

296
00:31:11,658 --> 00:31:14,779
Me and my Karan Arjun will return!

297
00:31:15,138 --> 00:31:17,039
Definitely will return!

298
00:31:17,738 --> 00:31:19,339
What a joke!

299
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,538
Karan and Arjun will return?

300
00:31:22,418 --> 00:31:23,778
Old crazy!

301
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,499
My father, Durjan Singh, les
gave a terrible death ...

302
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:31,859
God ... I think that even 10
times before sending them here!

303
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,219
Move!

304
00:32:11,382 --> 00:32:12,903
Old crazy!

305
00:32:13,382 --> 00:32:17,142
It seems that not even think
your sons are dead.

306
00:32:18,743 --> 00:32:23,424
Here, put on the girnalda
photography.

307
00:32:23,783 --> 00:32:28,183
Watch her every day so you
convince your kids

308
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:29,344
are no longer.

309
00:32:30,304 --> 00:32:32,503
This is for me.

310
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:35,104
And for me.

311
00:32:48,985 --> 00:32:52,945
Priest, my son is going to
abroad.

312
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:56,585
I brought it to Mother
Bless.

313
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:59,386
So again with the success of your
mission.

314
00:33:00,026 --> 00:33:02,827
After torment a
mother ...

315
00:33:03,226 --> 00:33:07,547
You ask your other mother
blessing?

316
00:33:09,306 --> 00:33:13,627
You'll have to beg my kids.

317
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:17,788
Ruegales for your life.
To let you live.

318
00:33:19,107 --> 00:33:22,428
Remember, these three garlands ..

319
00:33:22,948 --> 00:33:27,228
If not ... your body adornment
these ...

320
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:30,029
I'm not worthy of my
name, Durga!

321
00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:37,549
Remember this Durjan.

322
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:41,189
My children will return!

323
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:44,229
Me and my Karan Arjun will return!

324
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,869
Stupid woman!
As can return the dead?

325
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:52,270
They will break the land
and will come!

326
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,310
They rend the sky
and will come!

327
00:34:10,111 --> 00:34:11,551
That guy is finished!

328
00:34:11,911 --> 00:34:14,071
Punch him!

329
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:09,755
You were great!

330
00:35:10,516 --> 00:35:13,235
You did a miracle defeating
Kalia to favorite! Mira.

331
00:35:13,596 --> 00:35:15,157
A shower of money!

332
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:20,596
Here's your part. From today
you are the favorite here.

333
00:35:26,677 --> 00:35:28,877
Eunuch! You marry me?

334
00:35:30,237 --> 00:35:32,517
I'll start the brain!

335
00:35:33,078 --> 00:35:35,077
Papa, she mistreats us!

336
00:35:37,118 --> 00:35:39,558
Get lost!

337
00:35:39,998 --> 00:35:41,718
Never find a boyfriend
like me!

338
00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:47,999
You seem to live in this area.

339
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,998
It's a girl or a boy?

340
00:35:50,178 --> 00:35:53,839
Who you ask?
I'll tell you who I am.

341
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,040
Run! I enuco!

342
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,840
See that?
It was the fifth copy.

343
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:08,320
Before my dad will my
hand to someone else ...

344
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Take my hand.

345
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:18,761
A's not interested in you, but your
persecuting him like a fool.

346
00:36:19,161 --> 00:36:22,081
It has the special that
I just want him?

347
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:27,681
Pope has what no
else has.

348
00:36:28,482 --> 00:36:30,842
He gave me a slap when
was small.

349
00:36:31,202 --> 00:36:33,762
In my cheek, but I leave a
printed mark in my heart.

350
00:36:34,562 --> 00:36:39,683
The day they give you a slap,
you forgot to get me a boyfriend!

351
00:36:45,883 --> 00:36:48,364
No! It's nothing ... just a
remedy.

352
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,603
Liquor in a bottle of medicine?

353
00:36:56,245 --> 00:36:59,484
I have a hard buy
remedies.

354
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:02,204
And you have this poison?

355
00:37:03,204 --> 00:37:05,645
I want to save you and your
You want to die?

356
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:08,485
There is still time. Change!

357
00:37:18,246 --> 00:37:20,366
Great! Just great!

358
00:37:44,546 --> 00:37:46,366
Incredible!

359
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:50,407
It's fantastic!

360
00:37:50,607 --> 00:37:56,707
Fantastico or elastic, any
girl who comes here does

361
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,888
their teacher.

362
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:04,369
You really are amazing.

363
00:38:05,289 --> 00:38:08,369
As you learned such excellent
riding and target shooting?

364
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:10,129
I put my heart in it and learned.

365
00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:12,569
If you put your heart in it,
you too will learn.

366
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,690
His heart is also in it.

367
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,330
That's what I'm seeing. It
comes daily half hour before.

368
00:38:20,611 --> 00:38:26,530
I do? Since I came here,
I do not like being at home.

369
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,971
Like a comet that is pulled
with a thread ...

370
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:31,671
I'm the same.

371
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:34,571
Maybe that affect you.

372
00:38:34,971 --> 00:38:37,211
- That?
- If. That.

373
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:44,892
But in just two meetings,
Mogambo step ...

374
00:38:46,472 --> 00:38:47,572
Who is Mogambo?

375
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,072
My horse.

376
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:59,172
Yes, I am drawn to Mogambo
and someone else too.

377
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:02,774
Anyone else? Who?

378
00:39:06,234 --> 00:39:08,014
- Really?
- If.

379
00:39:08,494 --> 00:39:10,294
- Swear.
- I swear.

380
00:39:11,534 --> 00:39:18,494
I can see it in your eyes, but
also want to hear.

381
00:39:18,934 --> 00:39:20,574
- Who is it?
- La Gomera.

382
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:21,674
La Gomera?

383
00:39:21,894 --> 00:39:25,135
This slingshot as I enter
a love scene?

384
00:39:26,775 --> 00:39:29,775
People love hearts and your
you fell from a slingshot?

385
00:39:30,096 --> 00:39:32,775
You can have my slingshot,
if not my heart.

386
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:36,375
- Do not know how.
- You just know how to shoot arrows.

387
00:39:37,096 --> 00:39:38,256
I'll show you.

388
00:39:38,816 --> 00:39:42,616
Hold this right hand
and this left.

389
00:39:45,056 --> 00:39:47,297
And strip.

390
00:39:48,976 --> 00:39:51,498
Now keep it tight.

391
00:39:54,337 --> 00:39:55,857
Who is this fat hippo?

392
00:39:56,536 --> 00:39:57,518
My bodyguard.

393
00:39:57,636 --> 00:39:58,618
Your bodyguard?

394
00:39:58,736 --> 00:39:59,618
I hate it.

395
00:39:59,657 --> 00:40:01,258
Pope sent me.

396
00:40:01,938 --> 00:40:04,377
If someone gives me problems,
on the LYM.

397
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:05,577
LYM?

398
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:07,898
Yes, let
And Mutilated travelers with disabilities.

399
00:40:09,018 --> 00:40:11,579
Let's see.

400
00:40:13,618 --> 00:40:15,418
Hippo, where are you?

401
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,259
- You?
- Yes, I do.

402
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,759
- With the baby ...?
- If the baby.

403
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,859
- What did you do?
- The kiss.

404
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,300
Be careful.

405
00:40:51,181 --> 00:40:52,062
I pushed!

406
00:40:53,222 --> 00:40:57,182
Rogue!

407
00:40:58,662 --> 00:41:00,202
The hippo on a horse?

408
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:06,422
Where is my gun?

409
00:41:11,742 --> 00:41:12,622
Oh, that fight!

410
00:41:13,442 --> 00:41:15,322
You are a true Superman!
Goodbye!

411
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,064
Miss, seems I'll have
to teach something else ..

412
00:41:20,383 --> 00:41:23,143
- In addition to riding and shooting.
- What else?

413
00:41:24,623 --> 00:41:27,624
A kiss on the lips, not
cheek.

414
00:41:28,504 --> 00:41:30,544
- Here.
- Also I will learn it.

415
00:41:35,505 --> 00:41:39,505
Where is the ruffian?
Do not forgive!

416
00:41:40,066 --> 00:41:42,105
Who does he think he is?
It was a terrible fight?

417
00:41:42,425 --> 00:41:48,185
They like to heart.
And revano the villain.

418
00:41:48,466 --> 00:41:49,906
My ears were burning!

419
00:41:50,046 --> 00:41:51,505
- You also would be ...
- What?

420
00:41:51,646 --> 00:41:52,505
In flames.

421
00:41:52,826 --> 00:41:55,046
- Where?
- Mouth, ears, nose ...

422
00:41:56,086 --> 00:41:57,800
You rostizare if you say another
word!

423
00:41:57,826 --> 00:42:01,027
Always talking in a
sense as Dada Kondke!

424
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:03,347
Who was that ruffian, son?

425
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:06,107
A flower and a spine.
I take!

426
00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:11,948
Well done son! WHILE your
this hand on the head ...

427
00:42:12,267 --> 00:42:13,867
These thugs .. my club
hipico oversteering.

428
00:42:14,188 --> 00:42:16,707
Who would take care of the stable
if it was not for you?

429
00:42:17,107 --> 00:42:20,268
I am in your debt.

430
00:42:21,189 --> 00:42:24,829
No man.
I am in your debt.

431
00:42:25,428 --> 00:42:29,389
You took care of me after that
my parents died.

432
00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:31,108
I loved him like a son.

433
00:42:31,509 --> 00:42:33,189
You brought me up, gave me a job.

434
00:42:33,629 --> 00:42:38,149
Your father was my friend.
What I did was friendship.

435
00:42:38,669 --> 00:42:42,310
We will. It's time for your
students come riding.

436
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,390
He was talking about the.

437
00:42:46,151 --> 00:42:48,230
He can alone against a hundred.

438
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:51,470
- If you see it once ...
- We'll see.

439
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:52,070
Papi!

440
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:54,591
You're back girl?

441
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:56,591
Papi not move!
Do not move!

442
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,391
- Put the bowl on top.
- The cup?

443
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:02,791
- Slightly higher.
- Oh, come on.

444
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:04,591
Shit!

445
00:43:05,632 --> 00:43:07,911
- How childish is this?
- Gomera.

446
00:43:08,232 --> 00:43:10,151
I was practicing, but my
aiming is not good.

447
00:43:10,232 --> 00:43:10,751
Punteria?

448
00:43:13,672 --> 00:43:17,833
You went to learn riding.
From where it comes?

449
00:43:18,892 --> 00:43:22,233
What you plan to never go,
and what happens is not planned.

450
00:43:22,473 --> 00:43:25,633
And what ever you think some
It happens.

451
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:27,813
I mean it was great!

452
00:43:31,094 --> 00:43:32,573
You understand what I said?

453
00:43:32,753 --> 00:43:34,634
If. I'm not stupid.

454
00:43:39,853 --> 00:43:40,634
Hello?

455
00:43:46,194 --> 00:43:46,876
Good morning, sir.

456
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:51,876
When I leave my mansion ...

457
00:43:52,355 --> 00:43:57,755
I think in another world, the world
our friendship.

458
00:43:58,956 --> 00:44:05,196
This friendship soon
will convert into a relationship.

459
00:44:05,556 --> 00:44:09,036
Your son will be my son Suraj.

460
00:44:09,476 --> 00:44:12,997
Suraj and Sonia can commit
as soon as you return from London.

461
00:44:13,676 --> 00:44:20,517
Saxena, enough sweetness.
Let's talk about something bitter now.

462
00:44:20,957 --> 00:44:23,457
So the poison
bitterness does not spread in

463
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:24,957
our friendship.

464
00:44:25,437 --> 00:44:30,217
I have still not paying
your assets.

465
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:36,358
When I gave my goods
This retracing payment.

466
00:44:36,878 --> 00:44:40,039
Since it is dangerous, I
that ...

467
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,259
When it comes to money,
I am very immoral.

468
00:44:44,419 --> 00:44:47,039
Much more with friends and enemies.

469
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,079
Do not hesitate to kill my
own people.

470
00:44:52,779 --> 00:44:57,960
My payment should arrive within a week.

471
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,621
Why did you stop the car?

472
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,881
Look forward.

473
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:08,041
Move.

474
00:45:15,962 --> 00:45:18,401
Looking your eyes feel ...

475
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:22,242
May the Goddess Kali lives in it!

476
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:28,161
If she says with confidence that
their children will come, they must

477
00:45:28,161 --> 00:45:29,642
be on the way ...

478
00:45:29,723 --> 00:45:32,582
- Contador!
- I mean ...

479
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:37,283
Brother, the story ends
that old witch today!

480
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:41,844
Brother, his words penetrate
like needles!

481
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:44,043
Flatten.

482
00:45:45,044 --> 00:45:50,003
What do you say? She is already dead.

483
00:45:50,364 --> 00:45:53,604
Warriors do not attack
women!

484
00:45:54,044 --> 00:45:57,364
- I said I will tread the old!
- No.

485
00:45:58,165 --> 00:45:59,445
No! What are you doing?

486
00:46:18,206 --> 00:46:20,206
Why do you get them?

487
00:46:20,606 --> 00:46:24,006
They terrify the whole people.
Why do you want to kill yourself?

488
00:46:24,446 --> 00:46:28,447
If I were to die,
I would have died long ago.

489
00:46:29,007 --> 00:46:33,087
Death can not destroy me
until I have been destroyed.

490
00:46:33,567 --> 00:46:36,327
My children will come to destroy them.

491
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:39,367
The arms of a mother.

492
00:46:40,327 --> 00:46:43,207
Karan and Arjun will come.

493
00:46:43,288 --> 00:46:44,969
Mama!

494
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:50,808
Mama.

495
00:47:28,371 --> 00:47:32,292
Run! Arjun run!

496
00:47:36,051 --> 00:47:40,892
What's going on? People
suffer from sleepwalking?

497
00:47:41,112 --> 00:47:43,052
You talk in your sleep?

498
00:47:43,872 --> 00:47:50,573
I see? My heart beats like the
neck sliced ??a chicken!

499
00:47:50,773 --> 00:47:55,974
These bones resonate as
coins on a carom table.

500
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,573
Who are you talking in your sleep?

501
00:48:00,174 --> 00:48:01,854
I do not know.

502
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:06,494
But I could see strange shadows
of my childhood.

503
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:10,635
I feel like I have
relationship with them.

504
00:48:13,095 --> 00:48:15,274
A deep bond with them.

505
00:48:17,175 --> 00:48:21,295
Something that attracts me to them.

506
00:48:21,634 --> 00:48:23,095
Calling me.

507
00:48:24,216 --> 00:48:28,015
And what happened today ...

508
00:48:29,795 --> 00:48:31,436
Happened before ... ever.

509
00:48:32,156 --> 00:48:33,816
What happened?

510
00:48:36,576 --> 00:48:38,497
There's a town.

511
00:48:39,656 --> 00:48:41,497
Bell in a temple.

512
00:48:42,536 --> 00:48:44,197
A road ...

513
00:48:45,136 --> 00:48:47,736
And I saw myself.

514
00:48:48,818 --> 00:48:53,017
I'm running and someone yells ..

515
00:48:54,177 --> 00:48:56,178
Run Arjun run!

516
00:48:56,818 --> 00:48:58,137
Run Arjun run!

517
00:49:02,538 --> 00:49:04,698
Ajay, your father vomiting blood.

518
00:49:04,898 --> 00:49:06,779
The doctor said that this is
very serious.

519
00:49:09,058 --> 00:49:12,139
The liquor destroyed his liver.
We'll have to operate.

520
00:49:12,939 --> 00:49:15,219
- How much money is needed?
- 10,000 rupees.

521
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,660
Well, let it run.

522
00:49:25,781 --> 00:49:26,421
That?

523
00:49:27,681 --> 00:49:29,221
- You will lose this fight?
- If.

524
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,180
Because today I beat
Death.

525
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,201
It is a matter of life my dad.

526
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:38,301
I need 10,000 rupees.

527
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,420
Another windfall!

528
00:49:40,641 --> 00:49:43,221
Money? As a companion?

529
00:49:43,301 --> 00:49:46,642
He is the favorite.
People bet on it.

530
00:49:46,801 --> 00:49:48,761
He makes it his to lose.

531
00:49:49,322 --> 00:49:51,742
And we will not have to pay
anyone!

532
00:49:53,621 --> 00:49:56,223
But you really will lose?

533
00:49:58,403 --> 00:49:59,443
10,000 rupees.

534
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:07,423
Is there someone else?

535
00:50:07,703 --> 00:50:09,123
Anyone?

536
00:50:09,784 --> 00:50:12,163
Here! Local favorite Ajay.

537
00:50:59,547 --> 00:51:01,647
That is not crushed by the
picture you showed me?

538
00:51:01,868 --> 00:51:04,747
If. But I do not understand how
change the tide.

539
00:51:04,868 --> 00:51:05,647
Shut!

540
00:52:08,812 --> 00:52:10,832
What are you doing? 'll Ruin us!

541
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:46,755
What are you doing?

542
00:52:47,035 --> 00:52:49,675
Controlate. What are you doing?

543
00:52:49,955 --> 00:52:51,356
You needed Rs 10,000!

544
00:52:51,636 --> 00:52:56,076
You said you'd lose the fight!
But we arruinastes to win!

545
00:52:56,636 --> 00:52:58,195
What's wrong?

546
00:53:00,116 --> 00:53:01,196
I wanted to lose the fight.

547
00:53:03,316 --> 00:53:03,916
But ...

548
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,916
I do not know what happened.

549
00:53:20,657 --> 00:53:24,198
You've got a lifetime to
know who I am.

550
00:53:24,998 --> 00:53:29,119
But right now your father
only has a short time. I take it.

551
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:32,198
And this is my card.

552
00:53:57,221 --> 00:53:59,401
- Who are you?
- My name is Ajay.

553
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,520
- This Mr. Saxena?
- Yes, sit down. I'll go look for it.

554
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:23,520
Hello?

555
00:54:24,843 --> 00:54:26,503
- Who is it?
- My name is Ajay.

556
00:54:26,843 --> 00:54:27,403
Ajay?

557
00:54:28,663 --> 00:54:32,223
But nobody called Ajay in
the home of Mr. Saxon.

558
00:54:33,723 --> 00:54:34,663
I am visiting.

559
00:54:34,743 --> 00:54:38,084
Caballero, all visits are
in this world.

560
00:54:39,184 --> 00:54:43,764
However, my phone line
ud is a link.

561
00:54:44,663 --> 00:54:47,964
During the talk, our
also be linked hearts.

562
00:54:48,324 --> 00:54:50,764
And we could be friends.

563
00:54:51,164 --> 00:54:53,144
So we're friends?

564
00:54:53,604 --> 00:54:55,005
I'm not interested.

565
00:54:57,165 --> 00:55:01,125
Lord,
looks tight man.

566
00:55:01,845 --> 00:55:02,506
No. ..

567
00:55:03,545 --> 00:55:06,406
I just turn on the pyre
my father's funeral.

568
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:07,606
Sorry brother.

569
00:55:08,666 --> 00:55:12,166
Please call Sonia.
I am Vijay.

570
00:55:13,206 --> 00:55:15,287
Sorry ... there is a call for
Sonia.

571
00:55:15,566 --> 00:55:17,085
Tell Sonia came.

572
00:55:18,627 --> 00:55:19,527
She came out.

573
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:22,086
Sonia darling, hurry!

574
00:55:22,866 --> 00:55:24,806
We have to go to the airport
Suraj to receive.

575
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:27,567
- She recently came out.
- You?

576
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:31,308
How is your father?

577
00:55:31,726 --> 00:55:32,608
He died.

578
00:55:34,128 --> 00:55:38,368
Here are just 8,000 rupees.
Spend Rs 2,000 cremation.

579
00:55:38,889 --> 00:55:40,408
Devolvere would soon.

580
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:50,069
I like your sense of dignity.

581
00:55:52,009 --> 00:55:54,089
- Working for me?
- Working for you.?

582
00:55:55,669 --> 00:56:01,370
Your strength, your obsession, the
fire burning in your eyes.

583
00:56:01,449 --> 00:56:03,970
I like. Would work?

584
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:08,370
Otherwise I would have rejected,
but I am indebted with you.

585
00:56:08,451 --> 00:56:09,470
I'll start tomorrow.

586
00:56:09,651 --> 00:56:12,610
Not tomorrow, right now.

587
00:56:13,731 --> 00:56:15,010
We have to go to the airport.

588
00:56:24,731 --> 00:56:26,010
Welcome Suraj.

589
00:56:26,731 --> 00:56:28,692
- How was the trip?
- Fantastico.

590
00:56:28,991 --> 00:56:33,132
- Where is Sonia?
- This anxious waiting at home.

591
00:56:35,133 --> 00:56:37,732
My white Mercedes this out.

592
00:56:38,452 --> 00:56:40,273
You go ahead. I must go through the
customs.

593
00:56:40,452 --> 00:56:41,573
Right.

594
00:56:52,793 --> 00:56:54,273
This is the order of the
Mr. Saxena?

595
00:56:55,074 --> 00:56:57,174
Save this briefcase in the car.

596
00:56:59,714 --> 00:57:02,494
Hear what I said?
Save this briefcase in the car!

597
00:57:04,315 --> 00:57:05,495
I'm not the servant of your father!

598
00:57:05,715 --> 00:57:06,895
What a joke!

599
00:57:07,854 --> 00:57:11,014
You dare to call on the name
my father?

600
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:18,815
Keep your right hand on the
pocket.

601
00:57:19,336 --> 00:57:22,576
Or you'll have to eat with your
left forever.

602
00:57:23,036 --> 00:57:24,576
What a joke!

603
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,756
I think that you. two longer
they met.

604
00:57:28,116 --> 00:57:30,017
He is Ajay, a super fighter.

605
00:57:30,536 --> 00:57:33,176
And is Suraj Singh,
Sonia's fiance.

606
00:58:12,736 --> 00:58:14,176
Now I'm ...

607
00:58:14,936 --> 00:58:16,176
What's the hurry?

608
00:58:17,236 --> 00:58:18,376
My heart is racing.

609
00:58:19,636 --> 00:58:21,176
Why?

610
00:58:26,036 --> 00:58:27,176
Now I'm ...

611
00:58:28,336 --> 00:58:29,676
What's the hurry?

612
00:58:30,736 --> 00:58:31,776
My heart is racing.

613
00:58:32,736 --> 00:58:34,176
Why?

614
00:58:36,336 --> 00:58:40,676
I began to fear even
myself.

615
00:58:40,736 --> 00:58:44,576
I have started to fall in love.

616
00:58:45,036 --> 00:58:49,176
If you're afraid of your own ...

617
00:58:49,736 --> 00:58:53,176
Like .. you'll love?

618
00:58:53,336 --> 00:58:54,176
Now I'm ...

619
00:58:55,336 --> 00:58:56,776
What's the hurry?

620
00:58:57,736 --> 00:58:59,176
My heart is racing.

621
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:01,476
Why?

622
00:59:34,536 --> 00:59:42,176
The magic of your body attracts me
to you.

623
00:59:43,136 --> 00:59:46,776
When I see you ...

624
00:59:47,836 --> 00:59:51,176
.. I lose control of myself.

625
00:59:56,736 --> 01:00:05,176
The magic of your body attracts me
to you.

626
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:09,776
When I see you ...

627
01:00:10,336 --> 01:00:14,176
.. I lose control of myself.

628
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:18,676
What do you think of this?

629
01:00:18,836 --> 01:00:23,576
You have no faith in my love?

630
01:00:23,836 --> 01:00:26,776
I trust you,
but I do not trust me.

631
01:00:27,036 --> 01:00:28,776
Now I'm ...

632
01:00:29,636 --> 01:00:31,176
What's the hurry?

633
01:00:31,736 --> 01:00:33,176
My heart is racing.

634
01:00:33,736 --> 01:00:35,176
Why?

635
01:00:37,336 --> 01:00:41,776
I began to fear even
myself.

636
01:00:41,836 --> 01:00:45,676
I have started to fall in love.

637
01:00:46,036 --> 01:00:50,176
If you're afraid of your own ...

638
01:00:50,836 --> 01:00:53,676
Like .. you'll love?

639
01:00:54,036 --> 01:00:55,176
Now I'm ...

640
01:00:56,336 --> 01:00:57,876
What's the hurry?

641
01:00:58,836 --> 01:01:00,176
My heart is racing.

642
01:01:00,836 --> 01:01:02,876
Why?

643
01:01:39,836 --> 01:01:43,176
With the red of your lips ...

644
01:01:44,536 --> 01:01:47,776
.. I will color my life.

645
01:01:48,736 --> 01:01:52,176
Top up my dreams with you ...

646
01:01:53,436 --> 01:01:57,176
.. So I can live another day.

647
01:02:01,736 --> 01:02:05,176
Oh, the red of your
lips ...

648
01:02:06,736 --> 01:02:10,176
.. I will color my life.

649
01:02:11,536 --> 01:02:15,176
Top up my dreams with you ...

650
01:02:15,836 --> 01:02:19,176
.. So I can live another day.

651
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:24,376
You must control yourself,
I also let me control myself.

652
01:02:24,636 --> 01:02:29,176
Do not love me so much that you'll
crazy.

653
01:02:29,336 --> 01:02:32,576
Love is madness,
no sanity.

654
01:02:32,736 --> 01:02:34,176
Now I'm ...

655
01:02:34,736 --> 01:02:36,176
What's the hurry?

656
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:38,276
My heart is racing.

657
01:02:39,636 --> 01:02:41,176
Why?

658
01:02:42,736 --> 01:02:47,376
I began to fear even
myself.

659
01:02:47,636 --> 01:02:51,176
I have started to fall in love.

660
01:02:51,736 --> 01:02:56,376
If you're afraid of your own ...

661
01:02:56,636 --> 01:02:59,676
Like .. you'll love?

662
01:02:59,736 --> 01:03:01,176
Now I'm ...

663
01:03:01,836 --> 01:03:03,176
What's the hurry?

664
01:03:03,936 --> 01:03:06,176
My heart is racing.

665
01:03:06,636 --> 01:03:08,176
Why?

666
01:03:08,736 --> 01:03:10,176
Now I'm ...

667
01:03:26,763 --> 01:03:29,663
Dude, since you get only
I hear that.

668
01:03:29,823 --> 01:03:33,284
Sonia is on the way.
Soon came.

669
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:36,364
Morning and afternoon returned
still no sign of Sonia ...

670
01:03:37,743 --> 01:03:38,164
What a joke!

671
01:03:38,363 --> 01:03:40,105
Here is Sonia!

672
01:03:42,463 --> 01:03:43,805
Hi Sonia, how are you?

673
01:03:44,544 --> 01:03:47,925
You did not go to the airport or
you were not home!

674
01:03:48,164 --> 01:03:50,564
I want to tell you so many things!
And hear a lot!

675
01:03:50,804 --> 01:03:53,446
First you listen to me or me
TELL you?

676
01:03:53,844 --> 01:03:57,205
Now I must listen and
I have to tell?

677
01:03:57,345 --> 01:03:57,686
Why?

678
01:03:57,745 --> 01:04:00,086
If you hear me,
you will forget about you.

679
01:04:00,205 --> 01:04:02,005
And if you forget yours,
did you remember me?

680
01:04:02,366 --> 01:04:06,366
If you remembered, that sense
have to do something that does not work?

681
01:04:06,646 --> 01:04:08,825
I'm right? Bye.

682
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:11,825
What a joke!

683
01:04:12,767 --> 01:04:16,007
I said? Dude, you understand?

684
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:19,407
Son, I'm not stupid.

685
01:04:28,807 --> 01:04:34,128
They saw? This weapon can destroy
a steel plate of 3 inches.

686
01:04:34,409 --> 01:04:36,889
You can destroy pieces one
bulletproof glass.

687
01:04:37,129 --> 01:04:39,968
As people choose pearls
in the bottom of the sea ...

688
01:04:40,329 --> 01:04:43,589
Select this weapon ...
mortal and this is no joke.

689
01:04:44,029 --> 01:04:44,889
Look at them ..

690
01:04:45,829 --> 01:04:46,489
Knights ..

691
01:04:47,929 --> 01:04:51,929
In one month, these weapons
will be delivered at the border.

692
01:04:52,209 --> 01:04:57,330
As always, these weapons I
came through Durjan Singh.

693
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,009
And I'll give to the units.

694
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:03,051
Ask for the amount of
weapons they want.

695
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:04,851
- This clear?
- If.

696
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:08,731
Dude, I think, that one of
our customers did not come.

697
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:09,731
Vikto ..

698
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:10,431
That?

699
01:05:10,611 --> 01:05:12,931
- It has been relebado?
- No.

700
01:05:13,852 --> 01:05:15,571
He returned dishonest.

701
01:05:16,271 --> 01:05:21,652
I do not pay for things that
suit last time.

702
01:05:22,192 --> 01:05:27,172
And each time I send one of
my men for money ...

703
01:05:27,412 --> 01:05:29,372
Not become live.

704
01:05:29,652 --> 01:05:32,013
You mean swallowed
our money?

705
01:05:33,232 --> 01:05:35,653
A man was not born yet so!

706
01:05:37,593 --> 01:05:43,894
I have created a man of steel
to get back at him.

707
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:11,416
Peter, talk to your man
by telephone.

708
01:06:12,155 --> 01:06:16,335
Ask him to pay me.

709
01:06:16,736 --> 01:06:18,875
Or take your body!

710
01:06:24,436 --> 01:06:28,577
What happens? You are trying
see you looking today?

711
01:06:34,617 --> 01:06:37,317
Shot.
All my debts are paid.

712
01:06:37,538 --> 01:06:38,357
Okay, sir.

713
01:06:40,057 --> 01:06:42,817
You are paying all the debt.

714
01:06:43,097 --> 01:06:45,737
- When you will pay my debt?
- That you remove?

715
01:06:46,258 --> 01:06:51,438
That you took? than anyone
He could never take off.

716
01:06:52,298 --> 01:06:53,259
Do not understand?

717
01:06:53,818 --> 01:06:57,099
You took the heart of
this girl.

718
01:06:57,259 --> 01:06:59,058
That? Your a girl?

719
01:07:00,819 --> 01:07:05,060
Look in the mirror. You do not look
as a girl at any angle.

720
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,140
I'm not a girl ...?

721
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:14,840
A guy my age,
oh, a guy my age.

722
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:19,840
A guy my age,
oh, a guy my age.

723
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:25,840
And watch it, know nothing about
affairs of the heart.

724
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:35,840
Just look at this cruel guy, no
knows nothing about love and romance.

725
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:49,740
A guy my age,
oh, a guy my age.

726
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:55,640
A guy my age,
oh, a guy my age.

727
01:08:55,700 --> 01:09:01,540
And watch it, know nothing about
affairs of the heart.

728
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:10,840
Just look at this cruel guy, no
knows nothing about love and romance.

729
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:50,240
My bracelets sound calling you.

730
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:56,840
I got beautiful just for you.

731
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:07,340
My bracelets sound calling you.

732
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:13,340
I got beautiful just for you.

733
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:19,740
I got beautiful just for you.

734
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:23,640
My heart is crazy ...

735
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:27,640
Crazy for you .. ..

736
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,640
My heart is crazy ...

737
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:33,640
Crazy for you ... ...

738
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:38,740
What good is my beauty if your
no notes?

739
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:48,740
Oh cruel boy, serving
my beauty if you did not notice?

740
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:16,240
Tell me why are you avoiding my eyes.

741
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:22,740
Not supposed to be shy
with your nearest and dearest.

742
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:33,540
Tell me why are you avoiding my eyes.

743
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:39,440
Not supposed to be shy
with your nearest and dearest.

744
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:45,440
Not supposed to be shy
with your nearest and dearest.

745
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:53,440
I'll show you the way
which ...

746
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:59,540
I'll show you the way
which ...

747
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:04,740
.. Walk into the heart of someone.

748
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:11,700
Oh cruel guy, I'll show you the
way by which you enter the

749
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,940
heart of someone.

750
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:21,940
A guy my age,
oh, a guy my age.

751
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:28,340
A guy my age,
oh, a guy my age.

752
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:33,940
And watch it, know nothing about
affairs of the heart.

753
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:43,940
Just look at this cruel guy, no
knows nothing about love and romance.

754
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:12,507
What happens?

755
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:17,327
Nothing. I felt like ...

756
01:13:18,447 --> 01:13:20,387
I felt as if these bracelets ..

757
01:13:54,671 --> 01:13:55,311
Sonia ...

758
01:13:57,671 --> 01:14:00,811
I can only buy bangles
glass.

759
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:02,631
Not gold.

760
01:14:02,931 --> 01:14:06,171
Vijay, happens to you today?

761
01:14:06,571 --> 01:14:09,491
- You say?
- Yes, Sonia.

762
01:14:10,812 --> 01:14:12,472
I fall in love with you.

763
01:14:14,011 --> 01:14:18,292
But I never thought that your
serious ... a princess.

764
01:14:18,832 --> 01:14:20,612
And the dust of the roads.

765
01:14:22,472 --> 01:14:23,752
I could give you all ..?

766
01:14:23,972 --> 01:14:26,852
You mean wealth
is everything?

767
01:14:27,292 --> 01:14:32,013
No. The money helps man
to buy expensive things.

768
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:34,313
But not a heart.

769
01:14:35,353 --> 01:14:37,893
Man can buy
food with money.

770
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:40,013
But hunger.

771
01:14:40,653 --> 01:14:45,334
A man can buy a body
with money, but not true love!

772
01:14:46,054 --> 01:14:49,494
Love is more wealth
big this universe.

773
01:14:50,314 --> 01:14:53,294
Which we have.

774
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:56,415
Your love and affection.

775
01:14:58,395 --> 01:15:02,855
These bracelets are the treasure
of my life.

776
01:15:04,396 --> 01:15:07,475
Never leave this treasure
stay away from me.

777
01:15:20,917 --> 01:15:23,076
I want to see in palaces.

778
01:15:23,476 --> 01:15:29,538
And decided to do a caregiver
Horse your life partner!

779
01:15:29,737 --> 01:15:35,658
Not only my life partner,
We promised to live and die together!

780
01:15:36,257 --> 01:15:40,498
Your anger and cruelty can not
change our thoughts.

781
01:15:40,717 --> 01:15:43,098
I'll change your life!

782
01:15:43,838 --> 01:15:47,178
I will destroy!
I can do anything!

783
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:51,638
You can bring your pyre
daughter on your shoulders?

784
01:15:51,999 --> 01:15:58,459
These blind in his love. I'll
show you when the time comes.

785
01:15:59,579 --> 01:16:02,060
I'll shoot you if you leave the
room tonight!

786
01:16:14,741 --> 01:16:19,101
You lead a quiet life.
You are very lucky.

787
01:16:19,461 --> 01:16:22,021
You have no voltage
about food.

788
01:16:22,601 --> 01:16:26,141
I massaged, I serve you.

789
01:16:26,482 --> 01:16:29,901
Whoever serves me? Nobody.

790
01:16:30,381 --> 01:16:33,422
In the next life will be born
as a horse ...

791
01:16:33,502 --> 01:16:36,182
Lingayya ... and your like.

792
01:16:38,042 --> 01:16:40,022
Why are you laughing?

793
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:41,842
Lingayya Hey!
Why do you talk to a horse?

794
01:16:41,943 --> 01:16:44,883
You have time to talk
me?

795
01:16:45,323 --> 01:16:47,983
These busy diving in
pool of love!

796
01:16:48,223 --> 01:16:52,703
The sea of ??love is very
deep. If you drown ...

797
01:16:52,824 --> 01:16:56,104
Hey! Drowning is what
call love, right?

798
01:16:58,064 --> 01:17:03,765
It really became an
Lovesick Romeo in 1 week.

799
01:17:04,824 --> 01:17:08,625
The emotion is not the same when
risk your life riding ...

800
01:17:09,204 --> 01:17:11,525
When the emotion ...
risk your heart in love.

801
01:17:11,804 --> 01:17:13,025
What a joke!

802
01:17:15,645 --> 01:17:21,326
If you do not hear me, your life
will be at risk.

803
01:17:22,086 --> 01:17:24,906
Because your death suit
my hand!

804
01:17:26,706 --> 01:17:29,586
Death at the hands of a tiger
a mosquito?

805
01:17:30,066 --> 01:17:34,627
Who is this impediment
the way of love?

806
01:17:33,866 --> 01:17:34,527
Shut!

807
01:17:36,407 --> 01:17:40,187
I am the son of Durjan Singh and
Sonia's fiance.

808
01:17:40,327 --> 01:17:42,027
My name is Suraj Singh.

809
01:19:03,355 --> 01:19:04,835
Papa ... papa ...

810
01:19:31,155 --> 01:19:33,435
Burn it!

811
01:20:04,358 --> 01:20:08,599
Clutch it and go! Rapido!

812
01:20:37,858 --> 01:20:38,899
What a joke!

813
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,381
Love will burn!
The lover was burned!

814
01:20:43,561 --> 01:20:45,181
All right, son!

815
01:20:45,621 --> 01:20:49,122
The road shows obstacles
and destroy enemies ...

816
01:20:49,481 --> 01:20:51,582
Is the tradition ...
this family.

817
01:20:51,861 --> 01:20:55,201
So compliance with
Family tradition. Right?

818
01:20:55,361 --> 01:20:56,401
What a joke!

819
01:20:56,882 --> 01:21:01,542
Tonto! Joking aside. Prepare
for your commitment to Sonia.

820
01:21:01,882 --> 01:21:03,483
We'll go there.

821
01:21:05,882 --> 01:21:06,783
Your attention please!

822
01:21:06,882 --> 01:21:11,483
Ladies and gentlemen,
great applause.

823
01:21:14,882 --> 01:21:16,483
Thank you very much friends!

824
01:21:16,882 --> 01:21:17,883
Friends ..

825
01:21:18,323 --> 01:21:22,203
Today is the happiest day of my
life.

826
01:21:22,463 --> 01:21:26,563
Because today announced the
My only commitment ...

827
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:31,904
... Daughter, Sonia with Suraj.
Durjan Singh's son.

828
01:21:35,185 --> 01:21:38,605
As soon as he arrives, the
tradition of commitment will ..

829
01:21:39,885 --> 01:21:41,385
Look, here comes.

830
01:21:43,785 --> 01:21:44,585
Vijay!

831
01:21:44,785 --> 01:21:45,585
Vijay!

832
01:21:46,685 --> 01:21:47,485
Vijay!

833
01:21:48,105 --> 01:21:49,125
Stop it!

834
01:21:59,307 --> 01:22:01,466
You burned my father's barn!

835
01:22:01,507 --> 01:22:03,526
I'll burn your fingers!

836
01:22:04,927 --> 01:22:06,806
- Call the police.
- A non-police!

837
01:22:10,727 --> 01:22:11,806
Hello police!

838
01:22:17,527 --> 01:22:18,806
Ajay kill him!

839
01:24:29,757 --> 01:24:30,838
Get off!

840
01:24:31,978 --> 01:24:37,539
Run! Arjun run!

841
01:24:38,419 --> 01:24:40,138
Run! Arjun run!

842
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:44,019
I tell you to run!

843
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:04,740
I arrest him!

844
01:25:24,852 --> 01:25:27,812
We are Thakurs of birth.

845
01:25:28,292 --> 01:25:32,192
Pride and anger are at
through our veins along

846
01:25:32,192 --> 01:25:32,992
with blood.

847
01:25:34,293 --> 01:25:39,793
Every time our women give
step in the quicksand of

848
01:25:39,793 --> 01:25:40,533
Discredit .. ...

849
01:25:41,093 --> 01:25:46,734
The buried alive in the
walls of our homes!

850
01:25:47,214 --> 01:25:50,733
But the love of my son
stops.

851
01:25:51,335 --> 01:25:55,134
I have always fulfilled every dream
my son.

852
01:25:55,574 --> 01:25:59,094
And today will fulfill this dream.

853
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:02,854
You married my son in my
house.

854
01:26:03,695 --> 01:26:07,695
Prepare to leave.

855
01:26:09,175 --> 01:26:12,135
I do not understand.

856
01:26:13,855 --> 01:26:17,696
Suddenly because our
hands stopped fighting?

857
01:26:18,376 --> 01:26:20,296
And because I said that?

858
01:26:20,615 --> 01:26:25,816
Spread Arjun!
And he obeyed?

859
01:26:26,217 --> 01:26:29,057
You said? Repeat it again.

860
01:26:29,457 --> 01:26:32,377
Spread Arjun! Run!

861
01:26:33,137 --> 01:26:34,536
Something is very wrong!

862
01:26:35,016 --> 01:26:38,257
This is the same phrase that
say while you sleep!

863
01:26:39,498 --> 01:26:40,698
That's what I'm thinking.

864
01:26:42,658 --> 01:26:44,697
The words repeat
while I sleep ...

865
01:26:45,378 --> 01:26:46,858
Segui murmurandolas.

866
01:26:47,818 --> 01:26:50,738
The same words.
The same name.

867
01:26:53,579 --> 01:26:54,918
As they came to my lips?

868
01:26:56,139 --> 01:26:58,339
Who is Arjun?

869
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:23,661
Who are you?

870
01:27:24,021 --> 01:27:26,340
That's what I want to ask.

871
01:27:26,801 --> 01:27:32,062
- What it feels like ...?
- We met?

872
01:27:33,621 --> 01:27:35,782
We have a deep bond.

873
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:40,542
There is a bond that brings us close
from each other.

874
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:44,382
We have already met before?

875
01:27:45,742 --> 01:27:49,462
No. I do not even know your name.

876
01:27:50,023 --> 01:27:53,742
Then at the party
said ...

877
01:27:54,222 --> 01:27:56,224
Spread Arjun! Run!

878
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:59,783
I am also worried.
I can not understand.

879
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:04,065
How are you words came
to my lips?

880
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:07,224
Who forced me to say them?

881
01:28:08,264 --> 01:28:10,344
Arjun not know any.

882
01:28:12,025 --> 01:28:14,024
I did not know
Arjun product.

883
01:28:15,425 --> 01:28:19,425
It feels like we have one
strange relationship to that name.

884
01:28:20,805 --> 01:28:22,105
Some old association.

885
01:28:24,626 --> 01:28:32,507
My name is Vijay.
Thank you for saving my life.

886
01:28:34,347 --> 01:28:37,086
God forbid, if any
After facing one situation so ..

887
01:28:38,106 --> 01:28:41,947
I'll pay the debt.

888
01:29:01,748 --> 01:29:02,828
Vijay!

889
01:29:03,348 --> 01:29:04,528
Vijay!

890
01:29:04,748 --> 01:29:07,828
Vijay! Sonia letter for you!

891
01:29:08,748 --> 01:29:10,549
Something seems to be wrong!

892
01:29:12,869 --> 01:29:14,070
His servant gave me.

893
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:20,150
What about child?

894
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:25,270
Are being forcibly
Sonia to my mansion

895
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:25,950
Durjan Singh.

896
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:29,630
She asks me to rescue.

897
01:29:31,551 --> 01:29:34,951
She writes that if I will not
alli ...

898
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:39,551
Took poison and killed,
but not to marry Suraj.

899
01:29:39,831 --> 01:29:43,351
What are you thinking?
Prepare to go.

900
01:29:44,832 --> 01:29:48,472
If I go, what happens to your stable?

901
01:29:49,592 --> 01:29:51,992
- Your business ...?
- Businesses continue.

902
01:29:52,552 --> 01:29:55,792
But once that is lost,
as it comes to life?

903
01:29:56,272 --> 01:29:59,313
She is your love. Go my son.

904
01:29:59,412 --> 01:30:00,932
God be with you.

905
01:30:04,434 --> 01:30:05,174
What a joke!

906
01:30:06,134 --> 01:30:09,174
That rascal gave you these
bracelets, right?

907
01:30:09,854 --> 01:30:10,813
Throw them.

908
01:30:12,854 --> 01:30:16,414
- Throw them, dear.
- No! It is a memory of Vijay.

909
01:30:16,813 --> 01:30:20,294
Vijay no!
That's forgotten history!

910
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:26,800
Rare station.
I do not see a single person.

911
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:30,540
We'll ask him.

912
01:31:34,979 --> 01:31:37,219
How far is the mansion
Durjan Singh?

913
01:31:43,098 --> 01:31:47,458
That's what I look?

914
01:31:48,938 --> 01:31:51,098
Dude, where are you?

915
01:31:52,617 --> 01:31:55,017
No. This can not be true!

916
01:31:58,776 --> 01:32:01,695
I hope this is not the mansion
haunted.

917
01:32:02,136 --> 01:32:06,855
The old fled on hearing the
name! Something is not right!

918
01:32:08,255 --> 01:32:09,774
- Come on.
- Come on.

919
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:21,453
You fell in love, but the game
Love is very dangerous.

920
01:32:21,733 --> 01:32:24,433
Unless you play with
you will enjoy the chance never

921
01:32:24,433 --> 01:32:25,053
life with love.

922
01:32:25,252 --> 01:32:27,693
Life is not a delicacy for
enjoy!

923
01:32:53,289 --> 01:32:59,128
A people that bring me?

924
01:32:59,648 --> 01:33:01,847
Here I do not see a single person!

925
01:33:46,722 --> 01:33:49,521
You look in the lake?

926
01:33:49,841 --> 01:33:51,402
Want to go fishing?

927
01:33:52,161 --> 01:33:58,801
I feel like I've seen this
place before.

928
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,360
What do you say?

929
01:34:02,999 --> 01:34:05,439
I know from childhood.
You were born between horses.

930
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:09,119
Something is not right here!

931
01:34:11,558 --> 01:34:15,718
No. I've worked here.

932
01:34:17,718 --> 01:34:20,558
Here they used to lift huge
rocks.

933
01:34:20,957 --> 01:34:22,238
You're right sir.

934
01:34:22,797 --> 01:34:27,197
People say that makes many
years by the rocks being raised

935
01:34:27,197 --> 01:34:27,997
with camels.

936
01:34:34,636 --> 01:34:39,075
Here, there are some market
bracelets?

937
01:34:39,355 --> 01:34:41,554
There is a big market.

938
01:35:02,128 --> 01:35:04,488
Art thou fallen from heaven, man?

939
01:35:04,888 --> 01:35:08,328
Forget that. Tell me how
Bangles cost.

940
01:35:09,008 --> 01:35:11,088
Why you should buy bracelets?

941
01:35:12,728 --> 01:35:13,728
Show me that.

942
01:35:14,728 --> 01:35:16,128
These golden bracelets.

943
01:35:16,728 --> 01:35:18,449
These colorful.

944
01:35:46,669 --> 01:35:47,490
Arjun!

945
01:35:49,969 --> 01:35:51,490
I said?

946
01:35:51,930 --> 01:35:56,570
I can not believe it! You are Arjun.

947
01:35:58,210 --> 01:36:02,010
- Who is Arjun?
- The light of the eyes of this woman.

948
01:36:03,851 --> 01:36:06,250
That was extinguished by a
bad man.

949
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:09,171
Your name was Arjun.

950
01:36:09,611 --> 01:36:14,011
Listen to this name so many times.

951
01:36:21,931 --> 01:36:27,772
I have seen this in my temple
dreams.

952
01:36:30,772 --> 01:36:32,972
I can not understand anything.

953
01:36:33,612 --> 01:36:36,332
What is all this?

954
01:36:39,493 --> 01:36:42,973
Mother! This means ...

955
01:36:44,692 --> 01:36:47,293
What have you done this miracle!

956
01:36:49,333 --> 01:36:54,813
The impossible is born as
possible!

957
01:36:56,334 --> 01:36:57,974
You are Arjun.

958
01:36:59,173 --> 01:37:01,374
The blessing of the Goddess Kali.

959
01:37:02,653 --> 01:37:07,094
The blessing requested in this
place by the mother.

960
01:37:08,254 --> 01:37:11,094
's Mother?
The mother who?

961
01:37:12,214 --> 01:37:13,875
Your mother.

962
01:37:17,694 --> 01:37:18,935
My mother?

963
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:24,735
ARJUN!

964
01:37:33,975 --> 01:37:35,775
My Arjun is back!

965
01:37:36,255 --> 01:37:38,456
My son has returned!

966
01:37:47,875 --> 01:37:49,575
My Arjun is back!

967
01:37:49,755 --> 01:37:51,056
My son has returned!

968
01:37:53,655 --> 01:37:54,656
Arjun!

969
01:38:00,755 --> 01:38:01,856
Arjun!

970
01:38:28,858 --> 01:38:31,538
MAMA!

971
01:38:39,939 --> 01:38:40,698
I. ..

972
01:38:50,659 --> 01:38:54,660
Where have you gone, leaving me alone?

973
01:38:55,259 --> 01:38:57,460
Where have you gone my son?

974
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:06,100
I have shed many tears
in your pain.

975
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:13,220
There is no place or way in this
people ...

976
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:16,261
Where there is no ... searched by you.

977
01:39:17,541 --> 01:39:20,181
You went too far?

978
01:39:21,381 --> 01:39:24,341
What took you so long to come back?

979
01:39:25,301 --> 01:39:28,421
Speak my son.

980
01:39:29,741 --> 01:39:31,821
Ageing.

981
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:34,862
My eyes have weakened.

982
01:39:35,382 --> 01:39:38,942
But my heart is not weakened.

983
01:39:40,182 --> 01:39:44,262
He was sure he'd come back.

984
01:39:44,982 --> 01:39:49,182
Definitely return to pay
debt of maternal love.

985
01:39:49,743 --> 01:39:54,742
The Mother Goddess hear my
prayers.

986
01:39:55,022 --> 01:39:56,862
And you came back!

987
01:40:00,423 --> 01:40:00,982
My son!

988
01:40:16,904 --> 01:40:23,904
No, my son. Do not cry baby.

989
01:40:24,424 --> 01:40:27,305
Already cried enough for
us.

990
01:40:27,624 --> 01:40:29,465
Do not cry.

991
01:40:43,025 --> 01:40:44,985
Not brought Karan?

992
01:40:47,345 --> 01:40:48,985
When will come the?

993
01:40:57,586 --> 01:41:02,146
If returned Arjun, Karan also
will he, mama.

994
01:41:05,747 --> 01:41:06,447
Ajay!

995
01:41:07,847 --> 01:41:08,547
Ajay!

996
01:41:10,547 --> 01:41:13,747
Do not cry.
I just sentenced to 6 months.

997
01:41:15,946 --> 01:41:21,827
When I get out, I'll take care of
each of the Saxena family!

998
01:41:31,987 --> 01:41:33,107
Where are you taking him?

999
01:41:33,787 --> 01:41:34,807
A prison.

1000
01:42:05,429 --> 01:42:09,310
Ajay, the other day asked
who I was.

1001
01:42:16,830 --> 01:42:18,590
Today I bring not only my
presentation ..

1002
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:22,090
But also ... yours.

1003
01:42:33,231 --> 01:42:36,471
You are Karan. And I'm Arjun.

1004
01:42:37,230 --> 01:42:39,271
We have reincarnated.

1005
01:42:53,031 --> 01:42:56,511
And our mother is still waiting
our return.

1006
01:42:57,752 --> 01:42:59,712
The sun gets tired and hides.

1007
01:43:00,472 --> 01:43:03,752
But the eyes of the mother
still searching for their children.

1008
01:43:06,193 --> 01:43:07,832
She is awake.

1009
01:43:11,793 --> 01:43:22,832
People die.

1010
01:43:24,893 --> 01:43:35,832
But faith never dies.

1011
01:43:37,793 --> 01:43:48,832
The impossible became ...

1012
01:43:50,793 --> 01:44:01,832
Possible .. in faith.

1013
01:44:04,593 --> 01:44:07,832
The dreams came true.

1014
01:44:08,793 --> 01:44:11,832
All and each of the
sentences are useful.

1015
01:44:12,793 --> 01:44:15,832
This bond of faith is such ...

1016
01:44:16,693 --> 01:44:19,532
.. We back together
everyone.

1017
01:44:19,793 --> 01:44:27,832
This bond is a bond of love.

1018
01:44:28,793 --> 01:44:34,832
It is the union of life after life.

1019
01:44:36,693 --> 01:44:38,832
It is the union ...

1020
01:44:45,637 --> 01:44:49,077
For a crowd met?

1021
01:44:49,638 --> 01:44:51,278
Someone fell off the horse?

1022
01:44:52,438 --> 01:44:53,837
Let me see.

1023
01:44:59,838 --> 01:45:02,437
Karan? Arjun?

1024
01:45:06,319 --> 01:45:08,999
Ready! The Thakur receive
its deserved!

1025
01:45:09,319 --> 01:45:11,799
The Thakur receive their
deserved!

1026
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:26,440
He's finished!

1027
01:45:27,159 --> 01:45:32,160
Who should I give these
good news? Already!

1028
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:39,880
We take liquor daily. We should
prove the beauty of the people?

1029
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:43,680
If Nahar.
It's been weeks.

1030
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:48,760
We hunt or animals or
women.

1031
01:45:49,321 --> 01:45:52,761
The caseria starts now
lords.

1032
01:45:53,461 --> 01:45:56,401
Are aimed to a cemetery,
wearing sneakers!

1033
01:45:56,761 --> 01:45:58,282
And I'm just looking!

1034
01:45:58,601 --> 01:45:59,841
Hey! What are you barking?

1035
01:46:00,201 --> 01:46:05,522
I bark. I am a dog.
But pcs. is a goat.

1036
01:46:06,482 --> 01:46:10,242
They will be slaughtered.
The owner is doomed!

1037
01:46:10,521 --> 01:46:11,442
What happens?

1038
01:46:11,722 --> 01:46:13,202
The drama will take place.

1039
01:46:13,522 --> 01:46:18,682
Both are back.
The owner is doomed!

1040
01:46:19,162 --> 01:46:21,683
- Who?
- The same.

1041
01:46:22,202 --> 01:46:26,962
- Karan and Arjun.
- Who are they?

1042
01:46:27,243 --> 01:46:29,363
Those who kill for years?

1043
01:46:29,683 --> 01:46:32,843
- Same Karan and Arjun?
- Yes!

1044
01:46:34,603 --> 01:46:38,203
- The dead are not revived.
- They do.

1045
01:46:38,563 --> 01:46:40,523
A miracle occurred.

1046
01:46:40,763 --> 01:46:44,483
I recommend you do the bags
and go on pilgrimage.

1047
01:46:44,724 --> 01:46:49,923
My heart beats faster!
The owner is doomed!

1048
01:46:52,444 --> 01:46:57,004
- I wonder if this ...
- Yes, Nahar.

1049
01:46:58,284 --> 01:47:01,484
If it is true what he says ...

1050
01:47:01,844 --> 01:47:04,805
Then we have to reach
their roots.

1051
01:47:05,165 --> 01:47:09,965
Let's see how the broken stick
old got together again.

1052
01:47:10,605 --> 01:47:11,845
Who are Karan and Arjun?

1053
01:47:12,484 --> 01:47:18,325
Look at these stones. Us
We used to work here.

1054
01:47:25,566 --> 01:47:28,285
What happens?
Why are you silent?

1055
01:47:30,786 --> 01:47:34,286
You were quiet when you saw
breast even before the

1056
01:47:34,286 --> 01:47:35,006
Village.

1057
01:47:35,746 --> 01:47:36,726
And even these are silent.

1058
01:47:39,667 --> 01:47:44,087
- This can not be true.
- It can not be true? That?

1059
01:47:46,486 --> 01:47:49,687
I do not think this story
reincarnation.

1060
01:47:50,807 --> 01:47:51,607
It's all rubbish.

1061
01:47:52,747 --> 01:47:59,127
Rubbish? All the people
I looked and I called Karan!

1062
01:47:59,767 --> 01:48:00,487
That's rubbish?

1063
01:48:01,707 --> 01:48:04,927
The heart of a mother you
and call you hug your child.

1064
01:48:05,288 --> 01:48:07,168
That's rubbish?

1065
01:48:07,768 --> 01:48:10,647
You could see the love behind
the tears of a mother?

1066
01:48:11,008 --> 01:48:14,248
That mother is lying?
His love is false?

1067
01:48:14,568 --> 01:48:16,288
Your wait for years is a
simulation?

1068
01:48:16,568 --> 01:48:21,288
But there may be born
like his son.

1069
01:48:21,728 --> 01:48:25,048
If that's true, that
stopped hitting me at the party?

1070
01:48:25,409 --> 01:48:27,729
What you said
'Run Arjun! Run '?

1071
01:48:28,729 --> 01:48:30,769
My name was Arjun
in my last life.

1072
01:48:30,889 --> 01:48:32,369
And you were Karan.

1073
01:48:32,609 --> 01:48:34,868
Us were children.

1074
01:48:37,809 --> 01:48:40,369
And a terrible injustice
he committed against her!

1075
01:48:40,809 --> 01:48:42,449
We were both killed.

1076
01:48:42,770 --> 01:48:44,690
And we returned to reincarnate.

1077
01:48:48,170 --> 01:48:49,810
Remember nothing, not even
now?

1078
01:48:50,290 --> 01:48:53,570
No. I do not remember anything.

1079
01:48:54,130 --> 01:49:00,450
Brothers! Shamsher Singh and Nahar
are bothering your mother!

1080
01:49:10,851 --> 01:49:14,811
Hear God commanded you support
you need for retirement?

1081
01:49:15,051 --> 01:49:16,451
Where are they?

1082
01:49:17,251 --> 01:49:19,731
Where are your children? Answer!

1083
01:49:21,812 --> 01:49:26,252
Answer elderly! Where are
Karan Arjun your and your?

1084
01:49:27,332 --> 01:49:28,451
Answer!

1085
01:49:30,132 --> 01:49:35,612
Elderly! To answer it or not?

1086
01:49:48,632 --> 01:49:49,412
Arjun!

1087
01:49:51,712 --> 01:49:53,513
The son of this mother
helpless ..

1088
01:49:54,712 --> 01:49:57,213
Has returned to ..
wipe her tears.

1089
01:49:57,994 --> 01:49:58,833
Son?

1090
01:50:02,573 --> 01:50:04,934
The same son who kill
years?

1091
01:50:08,333 --> 01:50:10,814
He is someone who looks
the son of this old hag.

1092
01:50:11,814 --> 01:50:14,414
I think it is a Cheat
city.

1093
01:50:16,134 --> 01:50:19,414
Sure did not hear the story
the death of their children.

1094
01:50:20,894 --> 01:50:22,815
If you'd heard ...

1095
01:50:23,894 --> 01:50:26,415
You .. you had not dared to
Pressing this town!

1096
01:50:26,855 --> 01:50:32,055
But now that he's here,
matesmoslo too!

1097
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:09,180
ARJUN!

1098
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:14,180
I'm there!

1099
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:22,660
Son beat them! Do you know
my kids again!

1100
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:16,660
Bailemos bhangada.

1101
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,260
Come on, come on.

1102
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:24,160
Bailemos bhangada.

1103
01:54:26,580 --> 01:54:28,160
Come on, come on.

1104
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:33,760
Tell me, tell me, where is
your heart?

1105
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:37,660
My heart is where you are.

1106
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:40,760
If you have your life,
not lose it.

1107
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:44,060
While you live, do not
Stick with me.

1108
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,160
Bailemos bhangada.

1109
01:54:48,580 --> 01:54:49,660
Come on, come on.

1110
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:00,660
While living.

1111
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:05,660
While living.

1112
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:09,660
While living.

1113
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,660
While living.

1114
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:16,660
While living.

1115
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:20,660
While living.

1116
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:44,680
On the shore sounded the
anklets.

1117
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:49,360
The river sing once more.

1118
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:58,680
On the shore sounded the
anklets.

1119
01:55:58,780 --> 01:56:02,460
The river sing once more.

1120
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:10,660
A smiles and wishes,
nobody can imprison.

1121
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:16,360
Love shines in your eyes,
the heart becomes restless.

1122
01:56:16,580 --> 01:56:19,960
Everyone dances with abandon.

1123
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:21,660
Bailemos bhangada.

1124
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:25,660
Come on, come on.

1125
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:29,160
Bailemos bhangada.

1126
01:56:31,180 --> 01:56:32,660
Come on, come on.

1127
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:38,660
Tell me, tell me, where is
your heart?

1128
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:42,060
My heart is where you are.

1129
01:56:42,580 --> 01:56:45,660
If you have your life,
not lose it.

1130
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:49,660
While you live, do not
Stick with me.

1131
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:51,660
Bailemos bhangada.

1132
01:56:53,580 --> 01:56:54,660
Come on, come on.

1133
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:56,660
That truth that can cut,
where a sword like that?

1134
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:09,660
That truth that can cut,
where a sword like that?

1135
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:15,580
That can keep the love
imprisoned, where there is a

1136
01:58:15,580 --> 01:58:17,460
door so?

1137
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:42,660
Let no one feel helplessness, which
no one is destroyed by pain.

1138
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:45,960
Let no one feel helplessness, which
no one is destroyed by pain.

1139
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:50,160
Come on,
celebrate this happiness.

1140
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:53,260
Bailemos bhangada.

1141
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:57,360
Come on, come on.

1142
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:03,260
Tell me, tell me, where is
your heart?

1143
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:06,360
My heart is where you are.

1144
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:10,360
If you have your life,
not lose it.

1145
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:14,360
While you live, do not
Stick with me.

1146
01:59:44,844 --> 01:59:48,403
Fools! They became crazy
intoxicated.

1147
01:59:49,404 --> 01:59:51,163
They have gone to a world
illusions!

1148
01:59:52,364 --> 01:59:55,044
They say the Karan and Arjun
beat?

1149
01:59:55,524 --> 01:59:58,404
They Karan and Arjun
they went to hell?

1150
01:59:58,924 --> 02:00:00,404
Our eyes
they can not fool us.

1151
02:00:00,764 --> 02:00:05,445
We saw their faces! How could we
forget their faces?

1152
02:00:05,765 --> 02:00:10,565
If. You can forget when
someone hits them both!

1153
02:00:11,045 --> 02:00:15,285
Who are you arguing?
Who are Karan and Arjun?

1154
02:00:15,645 --> 02:00:20,485
Those who kill for years Saxena.

1155
02:00:20,765 --> 02:00:23,925
They say they have become.

1156
02:00:24,285 --> 02:00:26,285
And beat them ...!

1157
02:00:29,126 --> 02:00:31,685
How can it be? Impossible!

1158
02:00:32,126 --> 02:00:33,525
That's what I say.

1159
02:00:34,366 --> 02:00:40,286
You always retas my brothers.
Do not believe them at all.

1160
02:00:40,566 --> 02:00:43,166
- Shut up!
- Ask if they think the.

1161
02:00:43,527 --> 02:00:45,606
Why ask me what my?

1162
02:00:46,206 --> 02:00:52,567
If he does not believe them,
I would think that to me?

1163
02:00:53,167 --> 02:00:55,706
Right. Ask him to
villagers.

1164
02:00:57,727 --> 02:01:01,767
Villagers,
I ask them who are they?

1165
02:01:03,288 --> 02:01:04,687
Where are they?

1166
02:01:05,408 --> 02:01:09,168
Who dares to oppose me
and wait for their death?

1167
02:01:10,368 --> 02:01:11,808
Of the speaker, sir?

1168
02:01:12,868 --> 02:01:13,608
What a joke!

1169
02:01:14,688 --> 02:01:18,168
They do not know! I speak of those
two of my uncles beat them.

1170
02:01:18,608 --> 02:01:22,168
Who would dare
raise them a finger?

1171
02:01:22,448 --> 02:01:23,848
Hey, man!

1172
02:01:24,049 --> 02:01:28,248
Why do not you say that Karan and
Arjun beat us like dogs?

1173
02:01:28,568 --> 02:01:30,689
You make us look like liars
before our brother?

1174
02:01:30,969 --> 02:01:34,849
Why do not you say old man, who
Karan and Arjun beat us?

1175
02:01:35,249 --> 02:01:36,448
Where is the old Durga?

1176
02:01:38,249 --> 02:01:42,169
Durga is crazy!
that diambula by the people.

1177
02:01:42,929 --> 02:01:45,610
We have not seen in months.
So where did you see?

1178
02:01:49,570 --> 02:01:55,370
You die! One
girnalda decorate your photo!

1179
02:01:55,729 --> 02:01:58,370
Losing their cavity!
I myself saw.

1180
02:01:58,690 --> 02:02:03,170
They embraced Durga close
Hill.

1181
02:02:03,690 --> 02:02:09,410
Lord Karan and Arjun have
come to this town.

1182
02:02:09,770 --> 02:02:12,410
You not current. Today,
They got in trouble at all.

1183
02:02:12,730 --> 02:02:16,131
Tomorrow, the Ref
ud problems ...

1184
02:02:21,811 --> 02:02:23,131
Are there!

1185
02:02:28,611 --> 02:02:29,431
What a joke!

1186
02:02:29,932 --> 02:02:30,912
There's nobody there.

1187
02:02:31,572 --> 02:02:33,612
Hey! You're trying to scare us?

1188
02:02:37,812 --> 02:02:43,493
No, no ... I saw myself ...
I saw Karan and Arjun.

1189
02:02:43,813 --> 02:02:47,012
Ask him to his brothers
if you do not believe me.

1190
02:02:47,972 --> 02:02:51,253
- Not you see there?
- No.

1191
02:02:51,772 --> 02:02:53,533
- See them?
- No!

1192
02:02:54,332 --> 02:02:57,973
Haran kill me! Sometimes it
sometimes accept and deny.

1193
02:02:58,213 --> 02:02:59,213
Haran that hit me!

1194
02:03:04,373 --> 02:03:06,374
This is not an eggplant?

1195
02:03:07,293 --> 02:03:08,814
This is not a carrot?

1196
02:03:09,613 --> 02:03:11,774
This is not a radish?

1197
02:03:12,894 --> 02:03:15,654
If I can identify a
carrot and radish ...

1198
02:03:16,134 --> 02:03:19,294
Why could not do it
Karan and Arjun?

1199
02:03:19,534 --> 02:03:21,735
They were truly
Karan and Arjun.

1200
02:03:24,495 --> 02:03:28,414
Because you look around? I said
Karan and Arjun who were.

1201
02:03:30,895 --> 02:03:32,135
Who is this?

1202
02:03:33,735 --> 02:03:35,975
I'm talking, rogue. Yo!

1203
02:03:37,135 --> 02:03:39,056
But the voice comes
from the inside?

1204
02:03:39,335 --> 02:03:44,296
Tonto! The voice does not come from
in, but beneath you.

1205
02:03:44,776 --> 02:03:48,616
From under me? My voice comes
from above ...

1206
02:03:50,295 --> 02:03:55,136
I'm dead! Where I came
that earthquake?

1207
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:57,136
From Latur!

1208
02:04:00,656 --> 02:04:03,056
Who are you? You scared me.

1209
02:04:03,417 --> 02:04:07,577
I am the one hiding and gives
know the truth. Your villager.

1210
02:04:10,416 --> 02:04:14,257
But ... I never saw you in the
people.

1211
02:04:14,777 --> 02:04:18,477
You call an eggplant one
carrot, and a carrot

1212
02:04:18,477 --> 02:04:19,258
one radish!

1213
02:04:20,578 --> 02:04:24,058
Implying that there is a
mistake in my eyes?

1214
02:04:24,378 --> 02:04:28,098
No. Your head tells you saw,
but your eyes say otherwise.

1215
02:04:28,738 --> 02:04:31,738
If. That is what is happening.

1216
02:04:32,178 --> 02:04:34,878
Listen to what your eyes tell you.

1217
02:04:35,378 --> 02:04:39,178
Karan and Arjun are in their
people. I saw them!

1218
02:04:40,738 --> 02:04:44,338
I have to give an answer
this beating by the owner.

1219
02:04:45,579 --> 02:04:49,618
Serious able to say this
before the owner?

1220
02:04:50,099 --> 02:04:54,539
Not only the owner,
I can say in front of everyone!

1221
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:58,619
Even the terrible consequences
shame I will not have to talk to

1222
02:04:58,619 --> 02:04:59,300
the truth!

1223
02:04:59,660 --> 02:05:01,940
It is true what I said, I saw
Karan and Arjun.

1224
02:05:02,260 --> 02:05:03,699
- Then come with me!
- Where to?

1225
02:05:04,979 --> 02:05:07,540
You fixed a favorable date
Suraj for wedding and Sonia?

1226
02:05:08,579 --> 02:05:14,220
If. The auspicious date is three
days after 'Dasara'.

1227
02:05:14,821 --> 02:05:16,740
Created such a sensation ...

1228
02:05:17,060 --> 02:05:23,460
Marriage .. my son
would set an example .. a story.

1229
02:05:24,981 --> 02:05:26,661
- Bless you, sir.
- You're back again?

1230
02:05:27,301 --> 02:05:31,101
I receive for my honesty
and veracity?

1231
02:05:31,741 --> 02:05:33,501
Betel leaf. Eat it.

1232
02:05:34,021 --> 02:05:38,941
Lady, hit me very hard
front of all the people.

1233
02:05:39,542 --> 02:05:41,421
Also suit evidence.

1234
02:05:42,381 --> 02:05:45,501
Not just me, until the villager
has seen Karan and Arjun.

1235
02:05:46,702 --> 02:05:49,582
- That villager?
- Him ..

1236
02:05:49,822 --> 02:05:52,382
Blessings, landlord!

1237
02:05:52,822 --> 02:05:55,342
Get up! You saw?

1238
02:05:55,902 --> 02:06:00,303
See? I saw? Oh God!

1239
02:06:00,902 --> 02:06:04,023
Fed horses
strong and tall.

1240
02:06:05,063 --> 02:06:10,183
They were galloping. Black horses
white, good and bad!

1241
02:06:12,223 --> 02:06:17,623
Horse stables! Practice
shot in the stables!

1242
02:06:18,223 --> 02:06:23,184
Gomeras in the stables!
In the stables ...

1243
02:06:23,463 --> 02:06:25,464
As the bottles were breaking!

1244
02:06:26,863 --> 02:06:29,864
As white were
hit with the rubber!

1245
02:06:30,104 --> 02:06:32,224
As galloped Mogambo!
Mogambo was amazing, sir!

1246
02:06:32,504 --> 02:06:33,464
Why are you shouting?

1247
02:06:34,224 --> 02:06:37,784
He said it cost him
listen.

1248
02:06:41,224 --> 02:06:44,425
- When I say that?
- You did not say at the door?

1249
02:06:44,824 --> 02:06:48,144
You have not said what I brought you
here to say.

1250
02:06:49,185 --> 02:06:52,585
About Karan and Arjun ...
What did you say? Nothing!

1251
02:06:53,105 --> 02:06:55,825
Tell the Karan and Arjun on!

1252
02:06:56,905 --> 02:06:59,545
- Who are Karan and Arjun?
- Haras to kill me!

1253
02:06:59,985 --> 02:07:04,026
Haras it hit me! Hey, that ...

1254
02:07:04,265 --> 02:07:08,666
Karan and Arjun!
They looked so gallant, sir!

1255
02:07:09,065 --> 02:07:12,146
As they fought! They killed all
one by one!

1256
02:07:14,666 --> 02:07:17,226
Karan and Arjun are incredible!

1257
02:07:18,626 --> 02:07:21,987
- Where did you see?
- In television, sir.

1258
02:07:22,786 --> 02:07:25,187
I showed 'Mahabharata' in
TV. He told me to say ...

1259
02:07:25,467 --> 02:07:28,506
I saw ... Karan and Arjun,
She even gave me 100 rupees.

1260
02:07:28,826 --> 02:07:30,306
No!

1261
02:07:32,667 --> 02:07:34,227
No! No!

1262
02:07:34,507 --> 02:07:39,627
Lord ... he's ... lying!

1263
02:07:40,427 --> 02:07:42,468
- You came to tease me?
- No!

1264
02:07:46,467 --> 02:07:48,348
So if you play a joke
so ...

1265
02:07:48,708 --> 02:07:51,308
You will not be able to ... talk!

1266
02:07:51,988 --> 02:07:52,668
Go!

1267
02:07:55,548 --> 02:07:57,028
- Come on!
- My work is done!

1268
02:07:58,668 --> 02:08:03,029
I'm so close to you as your
own heartbeat.

1269
02:08:04,509 --> 02:08:08,629
At the first opportunity, you
I'm free and I will take away.

1270
02:08:10,189 --> 02:08:13,509
- Daughter!
- What are you doing?

1271
02:08:13,989 --> 02:08:15,389
I'll go crazy!

1272
02:08:17,629 --> 02:08:22,550
I saw with my own eyes.
You must be very happy.

1273
02:08:23,110 --> 02:08:29,550
Your children have returned to answer
Thakur's atrocities!

1274
02:08:30,470 --> 02:08:33,150
But villagers say
They have not returned.

1275
02:08:33,830 --> 02:08:38,590
You tell me if Karan and Arjun
have returned.

1276
02:08:39,070 --> 02:08:42,770
As children can be away
his mother after listening

1277
02:08:42,770 --> 02:08:43,391
call?

1278
02:08:44,231 --> 02:08:49,191
When a mother is tormented,
to heaven in strategic crisis.

1279
02:08:50,711 --> 02:08:53,231
Karan and Arjun are back.

1280
02:08:54,391 --> 02:08:55,911
Are there.

1281
02:08:58,671 --> 02:09:02,992
They are Karan and Arjun!

1282
02:09:03,832 --> 02:09:08,912
The same face! The same body!
The same eyes!

1283
02:09:10,952 --> 02:09:14,672
Thakur is dead!

1284
02:09:14,992 --> 02:09:15,992
If.

1285
02:09:17,832 --> 02:09:22,153
Spring returned to my
sad life.

1286
02:09:23,713 --> 02:09:25,473
Durjan Singh started this war.

1287
02:09:27,153 --> 02:09:29,433
But my children finished.

1288
02:09:30,673 --> 02:09:34,993
I am with you in this battle!

1289
02:09:46,754 --> 02:09:49,394
Check if everything is fine.

1290
02:09:52,355 --> 02:09:56,475
If Pope. They are the same weapons
you select.

1291
02:10:09,275 --> 02:10:11,395
That's his.

1292
02:10:11,775 --> 02:10:14,395
Take the truck to the warehouse.

1293
02:10:14,715 --> 02:10:16,236
And send it from there.

1294
02:10:16,955 --> 02:10:21,636
Be careful.
No mistakes this time.

1295
02:10:22,156 --> 02:10:23,796
Or suffer great losses.

1296
02:10:24,516 --> 02:10:28,476
This contains our profit
also, not just yours.

1297
02:10:28,836 --> 02:10:32,276
We have a participation in
this, like you. Do not worry.

1298
02:10:32,956 --> 02:10:38,117
- Go then.
- Because so much trouble?

1299
02:10:38,837 --> 02:10:41,356
First let me touch the band.

1300
02:10:41,837 --> 02:10:42,756
What a joke!

1301
02:10:43,437 --> 02:10:45,437
That band? The band who?

1302
02:10:46,997 --> 02:10:50,997
His band, and yours too.

1303
02:10:52,277 --> 02:10:54,117
It was your order.

1304
02:10:55,077 --> 02:10:58,638
Your organized a drinking party?

1305
02:10:59,758 --> 02:11:05,758
I made some fantastic arrangements
you ...!

1306
02:11:36,358 --> 02:11:40,758
Why do you have a veil
so long?

1307
02:11:44,758 --> 02:11:49,358
Why do you have a veil
so long?

1308
02:11:49,758 --> 02:11:53,758
What did you feel
embarrassed?

1309
02:11:57,758 --> 02:12:02,658
Your friends tell you to say
quietly.

1310
02:12:02,758 --> 02:12:06,258
What did you do at night?

1311
02:12:10,758 --> 02:12:14,858
On the roof slept my brother ..

1312
02:12:15,758 --> 02:12:19,258
On the roof slept my brother ..

1313
02:12:19,758 --> 02:12:24,558
Slept with .. and thinking that
was you.

1314
02:12:24,758 --> 02:12:27,758
Forgive Ranji ..

1315
02:12:28,158 --> 02:12:30,758
.. For the mistake I made.

1316
02:12:31,158 --> 02:12:34,458
Forgive Ranji ..

1317
02:12:34,758 --> 02:12:37,758
.. For the mistake I made.

1318
02:12:41,758 --> 02:12:45,658
On the roof slept my brother ..

1319
02:12:45,858 --> 02:12:49,958
On the roof slept my brother ..

1320
02:12:50,258 --> 02:12:54,558
Slept with .. and thinking that
was you.

1321
02:12:54,758 --> 02:12:58,558
Forgive Ranji ..

1322
02:12:58,758 --> 02:13:01,558
.. For the mistake I made.

1323
02:13:01,758 --> 02:13:04,758
Forgive Ranji ..

1324
02:13:04,858 --> 02:13:07,758
.. For the mistake I made.

1325
02:13:38,158 --> 02:13:42,558
Your brother is your brother.

1326
02:13:42,758 --> 02:13:46,758
How is that not distinguished yourself
your husband?

1327
02:13:51,158 --> 02:13:55,758
He was covered with a blanket.

1328
02:13:59,858 --> 02:14:04,758
I thought it was my husband's bed.

1329
02:14:08,858 --> 02:14:16,758
He slept in a half
and in the other half.

1330
02:14:17,358 --> 02:14:20,758
Forgive Ranji ..

1331
02:14:20,858 --> 02:14:23,758
.. For the mistake I made.

1332
02:14:23,858 --> 02:14:27,158
Forgive Ranji ..

1333
02:14:27,658 --> 02:14:30,258
.. For the mistake I made.

1334
02:14:56,458 --> 02:15:00,758
There must have been a flame
lit.

1335
02:15:04,858 --> 02:15:08,758
There must have been a flame
lit.

1336
02:15:08,858 --> 02:15:13,658
The moonlight must have
Tugging on the roof.

1337
02:15:13,858 --> 02:15:17,758
You can not differentiate between
yours and strangers?

1338
02:15:17,858 --> 02:15:22,058
As you made this error?

1339
02:15:26,858 --> 02:15:31,258
I made a mistake but not a
great harm.

1340
02:15:34,858 --> 02:15:39,158
He and my husband have the same
height.

1341
02:15:43,858 --> 02:15:48,158
I was so tired of working
all day ...

1342
02:15:48,258 --> 02:15:51,758
As soon .. I slept I
fell asleep.

1343
02:15:52,858 --> 02:15:55,658
Forgive Ranji ..

1344
02:15:55,858 --> 02:15:58,958
.. For the mistake I made.

1345
02:15:59,258 --> 02:16:02,758
Forgive Ranji ..

1346
02:16:02,858 --> 02:16:05,258
.. For the mistake I made.

1347
02:16:09,858 --> 02:16:14,258
What we all thought ...

1348
02:16:18,658 --> 02:16:22,758
You did not do anything ...

1349
02:16:26,858 --> 02:16:31,758
We can see the truth in your face.

1350
02:16:31,858 --> 02:16:35,758
No difamaste your face for
overnight.

1351
02:17:00,499 --> 02:17:01,620
Where are the weapons?

1352
02:17:02,738 --> 02:17:04,818
Swallow is the land or
ate the sky?

1353
02:17:06,340 --> 02:17:08,661
I want to know how they disappeared
weapons truck.

1354
02:17:08,939 --> 02:17:12,459
The cost of over 10 million!
Who is responsible for this?

1355
02:17:13,061 --> 02:17:17,061
The bottle of wine is the
responsible.

1356
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:22,662
They must have been
drunks lying like dogs!

1357
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:29,661
By greed, we were deceived!

1358
02:17:30,100 --> 02:17:32,061
If you think I removed
money ...

1359
02:17:32,461 --> 02:17:37,501
Do not listen to the sound of
that money!

1360
02:17:39,141 --> 02:17:40,662
Hear the cries of the
death!

1361
02:17:41,861 --> 02:17:43,781
The shrieks of death!

1362
02:17:45,341 --> 02:17:49,663
I do not like anyone deceive me!

1363
02:17:50,663 --> 02:17:54,820
Tell me where are the weapons!

1364
02:17:55,222 --> 02:17:59,342
Or will cast shade
death on pc!

1365
02:18:01,261 --> 02:18:02,222
The Wall of Death!

1366
02:18:03,343 --> 02:18:06,062
I want weapons! Guns!

1367
02:18:07,582 --> 02:18:10,383
We were never so severely
insulted today.

1368
02:18:10,982 --> 02:18:15,744
If, Shamsher! We leave
this degradation clean!

1369
02:18:16,383 --> 02:18:17,383
But how?

1370
02:18:19,744 --> 02:18:23,704
Whatever the truth,
Karan and Arjun have something to do.

1371
02:18:24,222 --> 02:18:25,785
Both the saw.

1372
02:18:27,424 --> 02:18:30,825
Until we throw these two
dogs at the foot of brother ...

1373
02:18:33,263 --> 02:18:35,343
We will not see ... nor the surface
the truth ...

1374
02:18:36,664 --> 02:18:38,804
Neither brother will believe us.

1375
02:18:39,825 --> 02:18:43,384
But how did we get
Karan and Arjun?

1376
02:18:47,825 --> 02:18:49,265
There is only one way.

1377
02:18:49,704 --> 02:18:52,225
Mama! Mama!

1378
02:18:57,625 --> 02:18:58,984
Hey! He is the son of Usha.

1379
02:19:00,186 --> 02:19:01,386
Usha ... your son.

1380
02:19:05,064 --> 02:19:07,865
Son! He happened to my child?

1381
02:19:11,426 --> 02:19:14,787
Get up! What happened?

1382
02:19:19,945 --> 02:19:24,227
"If you do not send it to Karan and Arjun
the hill in an hour ...

1383
02:19:24,706 --> 02:19:28,187
Start sending the ...
body of each child here. "

1384
02:19:40,467 --> 02:19:43,708
I think Karan and Arjun not
received our letter.

1385
02:19:44,145 --> 02:19:46,388
We'll have to send another
letter. I understand?

1386
02:19:55,668 --> 02:19:56,829
Hey! Come here!

1387
02:19:59,148 --> 02:20:00,068
Yes, you!

1388
02:20:05,027 --> 02:20:08,388
Do not kill me! Do not kill me!

1389
02:20:09,589 --> 02:20:10,829
Run or shoot you!

1390
02:20:12,870 --> 02:20:15,629
Help!

1391
02:20:25,148 --> 02:20:29,229
Dress? Our hunters
came as our victims!

1392
02:20:29,391 --> 02:20:30,790
Kill these rascals!

1393
02:20:31,109 --> 02:20:37,070
No. No! First is the
show a brother.

1394
02:20:37,590 --> 02:20:40,189
And prove that you were right,
and the villagers lied.

1395
02:20:42,350 --> 02:20:44,109
- We came.
- Let the children.

1396
02:20:52,912 --> 02:20:54,070
Stand up!

1397
02:21:02,152 --> 02:21:03,232
Let the children.

1398
02:21:12,033 --> 02:21:14,033
Now take with brother.

1399
02:21:23,352 --> 02:21:24,672
Come on!

1400
02:21:28,034 --> 02:21:29,233
Why did you stop?

1401
02:21:37,913 --> 02:21:39,793
You garlands?

1402
02:21:40,273 --> 02:21:43,633
These are the garlands that
gave to the photo of their children.

1403
02:21:43,954 --> 02:21:46,713
These garlands stamp their
destination today.

1404
02:21:47,072 --> 02:21:49,314
Will turn into flowers
his coffin.

1405
02:21:52,152 --> 02:21:53,635
Flowers for our coffin?

1406
02:21:54,395 --> 02:21:58,715
Old! I think we should
read you the last rites ...

1407
02:21:59,076 --> 02:22:01,914
... Along with Karan and
Arjun.

1408
02:22:03,754 --> 02:22:05,475
Shamsher, start the jeep!

1409
02:23:23,958 --> 02:23:25,798
Run!

1410
02:24:43,003 --> 02:24:43,883
As?

1411
02:25:02,804 --> 02:25:04,803
These are the same weapons.

1412
02:25:05,804 --> 02:25:08,603
Thieves caught
with the riot.

1413
02:25:08,964 --> 02:25:13,404
They should have fought for the
loot and killed each other!

1414
02:25:14,084 --> 02:25:16,645
Make fed snakes!

1415
02:25:17,165 --> 02:25:20,604
Snakes? Call them pythons!

1416
02:25:21,125 --> 02:25:25,525
Someday they had swallowed
the mansion too!

1417
02:25:26,645 --> 02:25:29,045
They made a hole in my boat!

1418
02:25:30,206 --> 02:25:31,725
Good thing died the
bastards.

1419
02:25:32,965 --> 02:25:36,126
Or they had drowned and were
they had dragged with them!

1420
02:25:39,046 --> 02:25:41,486
- Police?
- Who called the police?

1421
02:25:41,846 --> 02:25:42,786
Yo.

1422
02:25:43,564 --> 02:25:46,604
These weapons worth millions.

1423
02:25:46,926 --> 02:25:47,604
And you called the police?

1424
02:25:47,926 --> 02:25:51,926
Think about it. If the landowner
I was caught with weapons ...

1425
02:25:52,288 --> 02:25:57,126
The police would have arrested
on, your child and you.

1426
02:25:57,966 --> 02:26:01,447
It would have been dangerous.
So the blame these two.

1427
02:26:05,288 --> 02:26:07,207
- Greetings, sir!
- Greetings!

1428
02:26:07,607 --> 02:26:10,047
It's good that we have
informed through your man.

1429
02:26:10,847 --> 02:26:16,207
Your brothers delivered the
illegal weapons.

1430
02:26:16,648 --> 02:26:19,007
If. Just listen to that.

1431
02:26:20,128 --> 02:26:22,927
They killed each other by
money and weapons.

1432
02:26:24,008 --> 02:26:26,329
Brought dishonor to the name
family.

1433
02:26:30,088 --> 02:26:32,568
Lady! The landowner is
doomed!

1434
02:26:32,888 --> 02:26:36,089
This is called kill two
birds with one stone!

1435
02:26:36,329 --> 02:26:38,609
Goods worth millions, Nahar
Shamsher and all doomed!

1436
02:26:38,888 --> 02:26:40,049
They are doomed ...!

1437
02:26:40,488 --> 02:26:44,009
Not only Nahar and Shamsher ...

1438
02:26:44,370 --> 02:26:48,089
Durjan Singh ... until no
would have been saved!

1439
02:26:48,850 --> 02:26:50,049
- Bindiya!
- Shut up!

1440
02:26:50,370 --> 02:26:51,770
Bindiya, give me a few grains.

1441
02:26:55,689 --> 02:26:56,648
Put more.

1442
02:26:58,330 --> 02:26:59,728
Mas.

1443
02:27:01,728 --> 02:27:03,290
- Hey, you!
- If?

1444
02:27:03,570 --> 02:27:07,729
Eating many grains. You were
a horse in your last life?

1445
02:27:08,932 --> 02:27:10,609
- What are you eating?
- Biscuits.

1446
02:27:11,010 --> 02:27:12,531
You were a dog in your last
life?

1447
02:27:14,210 --> 02:27:16,131
Eat beans! Come cookies.

1448
02:27:18,611 --> 02:27:21,291
Shamsher Nahar and are no longer.

1449
02:27:21,729 --> 02:27:23,371
When the rest ...?

1450
02:27:23,729 --> 02:27:26,131
When will be convicted?

1451
02:27:26,891 --> 02:27:30,531
Our hands are tied
while Sonia is his prisoner.

1452
02:27:31,051 --> 02:27:33,011
Sonia? Who is she?

1453
02:27:33,651 --> 02:27:34,011
Mama ...

1454
02:27:35,811 --> 02:27:37,252
She is your daughter.

1455
02:27:37,511 --> 02:27:38,652
My daughter in law?

1456
02:27:39,170 --> 02:27:43,570
Yes, and wants to make Durjan
his daughter.

1457
02:27:43,891 --> 02:27:48,132
No. At the mansion never
Wedding hear trumpets!

1458
02:27:49,194 --> 02:27:51,252
Only the death march!

1459
02:28:48,894 --> 02:28:54,252
Long live Mother Kaali.

1460
02:28:56,494 --> 02:29:02,252
Long live Mother Kaali.

1461
02:29:03,894 --> 02:29:07,652
If we have to take a life

1462
02:29:07,894 --> 02:29:10,252
or give our lives.

1463
02:29:11,194 --> 02:29:14,852
Offer a sacrifice.

1464
02:29:15,394 --> 02:29:18,780
Long live Mother Kaali,
the destroyer of evil.

1465
02:29:18,894 --> 02:29:22,252
Long live Mother Kaali,
the destroyer of evil.

1466
02:29:22,494 --> 02:29:28,852
Long live Mother Kaali.

1467
02:29:29,894 --> 02:29:37,252
If we have to take a life
or give our lives.

1468
02:29:37,694 --> 02:29:41,252
Offer a sacrifice.

1469
02:29:41,694 --> 02:29:44,794
Long live Mother Kaali,
the destroyer of evil.

1470
02:29:44,894 --> 02:29:48,652
Long live Mother Kaali,
the destroyer of evil.

1471
02:29:48,894 --> 02:29:55,252
Long live Mother Kaali.

1472
02:30:40,894 --> 02:30:48,252
When you're angry all the
world trembles.

1473
02:30:48,894 --> 02:30:55,252
When you're happy the sun shines.

1474
02:30:57,894 --> 02:31:04,652
Goddess of life, the flood.

1475
02:31:05,494 --> 02:31:12,252
Everything is in your hands, oh mother.

1476
02:31:12,899 --> 02:31:16,799
Long live Mother Kaali,
the destroyer of evil.

1477
02:31:16,899 --> 02:31:20,252
Long live Mother Kaali,
the destroyer of evil.

1478
02:31:20,594 --> 02:31:26,252
Long live Mother Kaali.

1479
02:31:27,894 --> 02:31:35,252
If we have to take a life
or give our lives.

1480
02:31:35,694 --> 02:31:39,252
Offer a sacrifice.

1481
02:31:39,594 --> 02:31:42,794
Long live Mother Kaali,
the destroyer of evil.

1482
02:31:42,894 --> 02:31:46,652
Long live Mother Kaali,
the destroyer of evil.

1483
02:31:46,894 --> 02:31:54,152
Long live Mother Kaali.

1484
02:32:35,194 --> 02:32:42,652
Who in this whole world ..

1485
02:32:42,894 --> 02:32:49,852
You can dare to raise
head against you ...

1486
02:32:51,894 --> 02:32:59,552
That head will be cut ...

1487
02:32:59,894 --> 02:33:06,852
.. Which is full of
arrogance.

1488
02:33:07,694 --> 02:33:10,794
Long live Mother Kaali,
the destroyer of evil.

1489
02:33:10,894 --> 02:33:14,652
Long live Mother Kaali,
the destroyer of evil.

1490
02:33:14,894 --> 02:33:20,252
Long live Mother Kaali.

1491
02:33:22,294 --> 02:33:29,252
If we have to take a life
or give our lives.

1492
02:33:29,894 --> 02:33:33,752
Offer a sacrifice.

1493
02:33:33,894 --> 02:33:36,894
Long live Mother Kaali,
the destroyer of evil.

1494
02:33:36,994 --> 02:33:40,852
Long live Mother Kaali,
the destroyer of evil.

1495
02:33:40,994 --> 02:33:47,252
Long live Mother Kaali.

1496
02:33:48,194 --> 02:33:55,252
Long live Mother Kaali.

1497
02:34:12,894 --> 02:34:24,252
Long live Mother Kaali.
Long live Mother Kaali.

1498
02:35:23,354 --> 02:35:26,595
Why do you look so scared?

1499
02:35:29,236 --> 02:35:31,477
I think I saw in the temple.

1500
02:35:32,836 --> 02:35:36,796
No! How can it be?

1501
02:35:39,077 --> 02:35:39,916
But ...

1502
02:35:41,557 --> 02:35:42,636
.. Who were they?

1503
02:35:44,836 --> 02:35:45,577
Who were they?

1504
02:35:45,836 --> 02:35:47,277
Papa, they are Ajay and Vijay.

1505
02:35:47,836 --> 02:35:48,836
Ajay and Vijay?

1506
02:35:49,636 --> 02:35:50,636
Who are Ajay and Vijay?

1507
02:35:51,197 --> 02:35:53,277
The same fools who were
in the temple, sir.

1508
02:35:53,757 --> 02:35:58,316
Those who thought they were Karan
Arjun and Ajay and Vijay are.

1509
02:35:58,797 --> 02:36:01,078
What nonsense, lady!

1510
02:36:01,597 --> 02:36:06,197
Two Ajay and Vijay two Karan and
Arjun. That makes four of them!

1511
02:36:09,395 --> 02:36:13,718
A coffin also need
4 shoulders! Be careful, sir!

1512
02:36:14,398 --> 02:36:16,758
Our stars indeed
appear to be unfavorable.

1513
02:36:17,159 --> 02:36:19,900
Weapons in millions
were encautadas.

1514
02:36:20,700 --> 02:36:21,638
Your brothers killed.

1515
02:36:22,079 --> 02:36:25,959
Now Ajay and Vijay.
Now there is another problem.

1516
02:36:26,439 --> 02:36:28,998
I want the plans
bodan stop for now.

1517
02:36:29,398 --> 02:36:31,079
Volvere to town with my daughter.

1518
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:32,359
Stop the wedding?

1519
02:36:33,700 --> 02:36:34,659
What a joke!

1520
02:36:36,439 --> 02:36:39,759
Until yesterday, you were my companion
in profit or loss.

1521
02:36:40,801 --> 02:36:43,901
But now that we
you about, you are a partner

1522
02:36:43,901 --> 02:36:44,641
in joy and pain.

1523
02:36:45,640 --> 02:36:46,679
The wedding will not be postponed.

1524
02:36:47,821 --> 02:36:49,520
Will take place on the date
We decided!

1525
02:36:50,559 --> 02:36:52,520
- But ...
- If you wear reluctant ...

1526
02:36:53,860 --> 02:36:57,359
Not you, but your body will go to
town!

1527
02:37:03,161 --> 02:37:04,760
- Apologies?
- Yes, dear.

1528
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:07,439
I am ashamed of my actions.

1529
02:37:09,821 --> 02:37:12,720
Fix your marriage with
wrong family.

1530
02:37:15,479 --> 02:37:20,479
A man threatens to
kill his friend ...

1531
02:37:21,881 --> 02:37:22,982
It is capable of anything.

1532
02:37:24,841 --> 02:37:29,562
So I can not bear to see
enter this hell!

1533
02:37:31,243 --> 02:37:34,163
Your Vijay has come.

1534
02:37:35,283 --> 02:37:36,441
Get away with.

1535
02:37:37,163 --> 02:37:37,982
If.

1536
02:37:44,863 --> 02:37:45,882
If dear.

1537
02:37:47,763 --> 02:37:49,523
I grew up with lots of love.

1538
02:37:50,722 --> 02:37:52,402
Do not cry my child.

1539
02:37:53,244 --> 02:37:55,244
I can not bear to see tears
in your eyes.

1540
02:37:56,802 --> 02:38:01,285
As anticipated wed help
escape from this house.

1541
02:38:22,484 --> 02:38:23,404
Where fleeing?

1542
02:38:24,286 --> 02:38:27,843
Stop or I'll shoot!

1543
02:38:31,125 --> 02:38:32,686
- But Daddy, you ...?
- Do not worry about me.

1544
02:38:42,845 --> 02:38:43,725
Run!

1545
02:38:44,727 --> 02:38:48,966
For me, run!

1546
02:38:52,445 --> 02:38:54,367
Brother!

1547
02:38:56,367 --> 02:38:58,206
A girl is screaming Vijay!

1548
02:38:59,667 --> 02:39:00,406
A girl?

1549
02:39:10,807 --> 02:39:13,809
Sonia? You and here?

1550
02:39:15,368 --> 02:39:17,847
Pope acceded to the light
our love.

1551
02:39:18,288 --> 02:39:22,408
He understood that my life would be
ruined that man.

1552
02:39:43,888 --> 02:39:45,008
The Bodyguard?

1553
02:39:52,888 --> 02:39:53,508
Papi?

1554
02:39:54,249 --> 02:39:59,451
See that? People use goats
to hunt tigers.

1555
02:39:59,968 --> 02:40:02,250
I use my daughter.

1556
02:40:05,290 --> 02:40:11,371
I did not think anyone in this
world was worse than me.

1557
02:40:11,811 --> 02:40:16,729
But I showed bastard
You can be at the right time.

1558
02:40:17,010 --> 02:40:19,412
That I became a slave to your
baseness.

1559
02:40:20,371 --> 02:40:23,891
Kill that rascal in such
so ...

1560
02:40:24,171 --> 02:40:26,770
God finished his ..
reincarnation system!

1561
02:40:28,811 --> 02:40:30,570
Go! Bring it!

1562
02:40:32,092 --> 02:40:35,811
When Arjun comes,
Karan also will come!

1563
02:40:42,291 --> 02:40:42,770
Kill him!

1564
02:40:54,770 --> 02:40:56,732
Where were those two?

1565
02:40:57,533 --> 02:40:58,372
Ahi!

1566
02:41:03,413 --> 02:41:03,972
Follow them!

1567
02:41:46,496 --> 02:41:48,775
- What happened?
- No one in the village.

1568
02:41:50,135 --> 02:41:51,734
- The town is abandoned.
- What?

1569
02:41:53,415 --> 02:41:55,895
- There's no one in town?
- No, the village is empty.

1570
02:41:56,936 --> 02:41:58,895
Villagers died?

1571
02:42:02,216 --> 02:42:07,016
They died before seeing the
flames of my anger?

1572
02:42:08,695 --> 02:42:11,895
Price, who gave shelter to
my enemies ...

1573
02:42:12,176 --> 02:42:14,937
I will not give them room to be
cremated!

1574
02:42:16,617 --> 02:42:22,497
His body rotted in the
way as stray dogs!

1575
02:42:23,895 --> 02:42:25,578
Where did everybody go?

1576
02:42:27,337 --> 02:42:28,618
Loons! Scoundrels!

1577
02:42:30,837 --> 02:42:33,618
Durjan!

1578
02:42:46,818 --> 02:42:47,257
What happens?

1579
02:42:53,818 --> 02:42:54,857
Durga!

1580
02:42:55,818 --> 02:43:01,700
I'm alive just to see you be
so tortured.

1581
02:43:02,700 --> 02:43:06,378
Play with blood! Today'll see ...

1582
02:43:07,859 --> 02:43:11,020
whose blood will be shed
body and who will fall!

1583
02:43:13,700 --> 02:43:14,779
As you can kill me?

1584
02:43:15,700 --> 02:43:17,259
Death to about
head!

1585
02:43:23,661 --> 02:43:25,460
The pattern is doomed!

1586
02:43:27,300 --> 02:43:29,460
- Rogue!
- Shoot!

1587
02:43:37,781 --> 02:43:38,461
Them!

1588
02:44:11,703 --> 02:44:12,982
Close the door!

1589
02:44:26,784 --> 02:44:27,503
Here come!

1590
02:44:45,984 --> 02:44:46,825
Drop!

1591
02:46:06,628 --> 02:46:07,588
Shot.

1592
02:47:33,713 --> 02:47:35,033
Rogue! Rufian!

1593
02:47:40,434 --> 02:47:41,753
How did that happen?

1594
02:49:25,718 --> 02:49:29,318
Son! He happened to my son?

1595
02:49:29,999 --> 02:49:34,759
What happened son?

1596
02:49:42,959 --> 02:49:45,400
My son!

1597
02:49:52,240 --> 02:49:55,318
Karan and Arjun killed my son!

1598
02:49:56,959 --> 02:49:59,320
They killed my son!

1599
02:50:02,880 --> 02:50:10,520
Saxena, Saxena.
Those ruffians killed your son.

1600
02:50:11,960 --> 02:50:14,641
They killed the husband of Sonia!

1601
02:50:22,801 --> 02:50:25,961
They turned off the lamp
of our family!

1602
02:50:26,722 --> 02:50:30,441
Controlate.

1603
02:50:44,761 --> 02:50:46,122
What are you doing?

1604
02:50:55,361 --> 02:50:57,122
PAPI!

1605
02:51:03,603 --> 02:51:06,603
Dress? I'm in my right mind!

1606
02:51:07,684 --> 02:51:12,923
There is no better way to catch
the murderers of my son!

1607
02:51:16,124 --> 02:51:18,204
My son died for you!

1608
02:51:19,245 --> 02:51:23,004
And now these two ruffians
will die because of you!

1609
02:51:23,363 --> 02:51:27,125
For you! For you!

1610
02:51:32,604 --> 02:51:35,728
These thugs will die for you!

1611
02:51:41,967 --> 02:51:43,806
Slowly walk towards me.

1612
02:51:44,326 --> 02:51:46,887
Do not get ready! Come on!

1613
02:52:13,408 --> 02:52:14,645
Hag!

1614
02:52:15,770 --> 02:52:17,288
Death is not in my head!

1615
02:52:18,527 --> 02:52:23,847
Instead, I am facing
to as the Death!

1616
02:53:39,853 --> 02:53:40,935
Save me!

1617
02:53:42,413 --> 02:53:44,214
Karan and Arjun killed me!

1618
02:53:44,894 --> 02:53:46,332
Perdoname.

1619
02:53:49,291 --> 02:53:53,254
This is your wreath
gave me.

1620
02:53:53,895 --> 02:53:57,770
Pierced my heart like a
spine until today.

1621
02:53:59,254 --> 02:54:04,533
Today will cast the same
wreath over your dead body.

1622
02:54:04,812 --> 02:54:06,295
And then I'll be alone.

1623
02:54:07,174 --> 02:54:09,611
And your sins were completed.

1624
02:54:13,812 --> 02:54:14,837
Karan and Arjun ...

1625
02:54:15,837 --> 02:54:17,135
Kill it ...!

1626
02:54:38,837 --> 02:54:44,837

1628
02:54:58,837 --> 02:55:01,835
When the sun is far
the sky?

1629
02:55:01,837 --> 02:55:04,235
When the moon is far from
its rays?

1630
02:55:04,837 --> 02:55:07,535
When the fragrance is far
Wind?

1631
02:55:07,837 --> 02:55:10,535
When spring is far
the yard?

1632
02:55:10,637 --> 02:55:16,735
This bond is a bond of love.

1633
02:55:16,837 --> 02:55:22,735
It is the union of life after life.

1634
02:55:22,837 --> 02:55:28,835
This bond is a bond of love.

1635
02:55:29,237 --> 02:55:34,335
It is the union of life after life.
