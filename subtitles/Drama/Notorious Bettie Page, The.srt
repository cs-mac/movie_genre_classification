1
00:00:01,541 --> 00:00:03,387
I'm here
to present an opportunity.

2
00:00:03,387 --> 00:00:06,381
An interview with Carlos Mora
in Mexico.

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:07,758
You know him as "El Toro."

4
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:09,593
El Toro wants me
to interview him.

5
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,720
The biggest narco trafficker
since Escobar?

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,097
He's just gonna use Louise
to drum up support.

7
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,725
It's the opportunity
of a lifetime.

8
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,769
Julia, I really think
this is a bad idea.

9
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,020
I'm gonna be fine.

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,147
And then you will executive
produce your first show.

11
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,623
<i>Más rapido.</i>
<i>Más rapido!</i>

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,884
Julia, let's go.

13
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,902
I don't know
how long she's been gone.

14
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,529
Have you called
the Embassy?
Yes.

15
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:13,490
They have a legal attaché
to coordinate the investigation

16
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,992
from the U. S. side,
but we ‐‐
Don't worry.

17
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,451
We're experienced in handling
missing people.

18
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,662
No, she's not missing.
She was taken!

19
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,289
There's blood
in her room.

20
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,748
She's an American
journalist.

21
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,125
So you came here
to cover a story?

22
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,885
Wait a minute.

23
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,387
You were in the cantina
last night.

24
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,598
‐No, you are mistaken.
‐No, I'm not.

25
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,891
What was a <i>federal</i> doing here
last night?

26
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,143
Preserving peace
and order.

27
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,520
You were tipped off.

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,188
You knew we were here
to meet El Toro.
<i>Señora.</i>

29
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,690
If El Toro's
people saw you here,

30
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,442
they would've assumed
we said something.

31
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,776
You're the reason
Julia got kidnapped.

32
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,111
You came to my country
to interview

33
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,696
the most wanted man
in Mexico,

34
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:53,989
the leader
of a drug cartel responsible

35
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,282
for thousands of murders.

36
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,450
You're the one responsible

37
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,036
for whatever happens
to your friend, not me.

38
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,001
I killed Johnny Weston
because he was a predator.

39
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,003
He was sleeping with me

40
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,838
and my daughter
at the same time...
Megan, I'm sorry,
excuse me.

41
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,006
Why are you playing me
last night's show?

42
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,382
I was here.

43
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,675
I will call you
right back.

44
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,720
Dana's on‐air confession is
the country's top story.

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,473
I want you to come on tonight
and share your perspective.

46
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,058
‐I don't think so.
‐Come on, Jake.

47
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,976
It's only my second show
executive producing,

48
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,436
and I'd feel
a lot more comfortable

49
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,104
if you were
in the interview chair.

50
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,607
Megan, I represent Maya,
not her mother.

51
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,108
Coming on your show is
not going to help my client.

52
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,985
Is Maya still
in the psych ward?

53
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,278
She gets out
this afternoon.

54
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:35,656
Avery.

55
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,616
Avery Whitsell,
Jake Gregorian.

56
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:41,119
Avery just joined WCN
from our Vermont affiliate.

57
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,788
Tonight,
she's subbing for Louise.

58
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,873
Nice to meet you.
Nice to me you.
Congratulations.

59
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,583
‐Thank you.
‐I was hoping Jake would be

60
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,794
your guest tonight,
but he's playing hard to get.

61
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:49,795
‐Ooh.

62
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,255
Work your magic,
please.

63
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,424
So, uh, how do you
like L. A. so far?
Hello?

64
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,385
Louise, what's wrong?
Sunshine, palm trees...

65
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,347
And there wasn't a note
or a ransom demand, nothing?

66
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,515
No, I reached out
to the Embassy,

67
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,891
but I'm getting
the runaround.

68
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,227
Call my contact at State
until she answers,

69
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,312
the Under Secretary
for Civilian Security.

70
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,939
See what she knows.
‐Of course.

71
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,732
I'll keep you posted.

72
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,905
So, Mr. Gregorian, how can
I convince you to be my guest?

73
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,782
Uh...
Excuse me, Jake, can I talk
to you for a minute?

74
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,867
Yes, you can.
One moment.
Sure.

75
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,372
What is it?

76
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,873
Julia and Louise went
to Mexico last night

77
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,458
to interview El Toro.

78
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,709
Apparently,
the federales were tipped off,

79
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,253
and Julia was taken.

80
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,088
‐What do you mean "taken"?
‐She was kidnapped.

81
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,520
iRaúl!
iAquí estamos!

82
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,195
Stop fighting,
or this will get a lot worse.

83
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,447
Go on in.

84
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,351
Who are you?
Take the tape off, Raúl.

85
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,022
Aah.

86
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,943
My name is
Julia George.

87
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,196
Louise Herrick and I are here
in Mexico at your invitation.

88
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,864
Your men approached us.
‐Davíd!

89
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,616
I'm not your enemy.
I'm a journalist.

90
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,325
Come here.

91
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,917
What happened?

92
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:55,462
This is not Louise.

93
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,088
I did as you said.

94
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,548
I watched the lobby,
and you were right.

95
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,175
There were some federales
in the bar,

96
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,135
so we went upstairs
to room 3.

97
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,804
No. Louise wanted my room,
so we switched.

98
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,306
I can fix this.

99
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,351
Raúl.
Please.

100
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,229
Carlos, please,
I can fix this.
Davíd, hey.

101
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,772
You don't have
to do this.

102
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,613
I have been wanting
to talk to Louise Herrick

103
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,491
ever since her interview with
the Prime Minister of Canada.

104
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,035
I remember she flirted
with him just enough

105
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,620
to make him feel
comfortable,

106
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,665
and then...she pounced.

107
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,583
He gave it
right back to her,

108
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,753
and they both looked
brilliant.

109
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,964
I think she may have won him
the election.

110
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,096
I agree.
I produced that episode.

111
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,056
I know you want Louise
to interview you,

112
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,724
but I can do it.

113
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,852
No.

114
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,020
The world doesn't recognize
your face.

115
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,857
You cannot help me.

116
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,276
You're staying until I decide
what to do with you.

117
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,694
Come.
Let's go.

118
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,797
Come back! At least ‐‐
At least talk to me!

119
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,215
Save your breath.

120
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,886
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

121
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,388
I'm not one of them.

122
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,349
You're Ignacio Enriquez
from <i>Las Noticias.</i>

123
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,560
Yeah.

124
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,353
And you are?
‐I'm Julia George.

125
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,856
I'm a producer
from "Louise Herrick Live."

126
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,984
We thought you were dead.

127
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,319
Not quite yet.

128
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,239
Corporate called
a meeting upstairs.

129
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,366
Savannah Barbour, our C. E. O.,
arrived a few minutes ago.

130
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,201
Good. What about
the State Department?

131
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,953
The U. S. embassy
in Mexico

132
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,122
and Mexican Secretariat
of Foreign Affairs are aware

133
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,498
of the situation.

134
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,500
They're doing due diligence ‐‐
whatever that means.

135
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,710
Yeah, it means
everyone's scared to act.

136
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,045
No one wants
an international incident.

137
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,671
Darin, any news?

138
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,839
No.

139
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,049
Heading up
to that briefing.

140
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,675
K&amp;R team's already here.

141
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,886
‐What's K&amp;R?
‐Kidnap and ransom.

142
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,013
Corporations have
insurance policies for
situations like this.

143
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,265
The K&amp;R guys will do whatever it
takes to get the victim back.

144
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,142
I just don't believe
the richest drug lord

145
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,728
in North America would kidnap
Julia for the ransom money.

146
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,647
You're not coming
to this meeting.
The hell I'm not.

147
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,776
K&amp;R has directed corporate
to wait for the kidnapper

148
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,028
to claim responsibility,
provide proof of life,

149
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,030
or demand a ransom.

150
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,407
Now, obviously,
our primary concern is

151
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,577
Julia's life, but our K&amp;R
insurance policy will

152
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,664
be invalidated if we don't abide
by their directive.

153
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,207
We cannot let that happen.

154
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,709
Uh, Mr. Gregorian,
this is a private meeting.

155
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,002
Are you sure
about that, Savannah?

156
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,003
See, I represent
Julia George's interests,

157
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,297
so I should be here.

158
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,716
But last I checked, the
district attorney was not
an employee of your company.

159
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,344
My contact in Mexico called me
when Julia went missing.

160
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,804
It was me
that informed the network.

161
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,222
Your contact in Mexico ‐‐

162
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,182
You knew Julia was going
to Mexico.

163
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,101
You had federales
follow her, Max?

164
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,104
She was hell‐bent on going,
so I put some security in place.

165
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,146
Great idea.

166
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,731
All due respect, Savannah,

167
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,316
K&amp;R orders
of operation notwithstanding,

168
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,859
we do not have time
to wait.

169
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,611
We're dealing with Carlos Mora.
There man is a terrorist.

170
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,738
Julia will be dead
before K&amp;R lifts a finger.

171
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,365
We're doing this
by the book!

172
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,784
Per K&amp;R directive,
I'm calling for a media blackout

173
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,119
on Julia's disappearance.

174
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,495
And let's reconvene
after two hours.

175
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,164
If anybody finds anything out,
my office is always open.

176
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,885
‐How did you get here?

177
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,762
I mean, everyone heard
rumors that you were
interviewing El Toro,

178
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,763
and then nothing.

179
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,181
A few months ago,

180
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,142
a guy showed up
at my apartment.

181
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,520
He showed me a photo
of Carlos Mora reading my paper.

182
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,772
And then, he offered me
an exclusive with Carlos.

183
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,274
As soon as I started talking

184
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,527
about how his Robin Hood act
was a sham,

185
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,821
how he has done more
to harm the poor communities

186
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,866
in Mexico than help them,
he shut me down.

187
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,452
All he wanted was to use
the most respected paper

188
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,829
in Mexico to shout
his insane ideas

189
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,122
about revolution.

190
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,790
That's probably why he wanted
Louise to interview him.

191
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,293
People in my country are
desperate for change.

192
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,086
If I allowed El Toro
to shout nonsense

193
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,673
under my byline,
it would end with violence.

194
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,968
So, I refused,

195
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,344
and he threw me
in here,

196
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,680
where I get to be
his guest until I give him

197
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,223
the interview he wants.

198
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,685
I admire your principles,
but what good are they doing you

199
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,562
if everyone thinks
you're dead?

200
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,023
We have to get out of here ‐‐
whatever it takes.

201
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,525
No, no, no, no, no,
not if it means

202
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,985
legitimizing a madman.

203
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,361
The people want change.

204
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,572
If you give El Toro
a platform,

205
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,990
some people will listen
to him,

206
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,200
and there will be blood
in the streets.

207
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,163
I refuse to participate
in that,

208
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,790
even if it kills me.

209
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,129
I hope
you will do the same.

210
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,434
Here's what we know ‐‐
WCN has K&amp;R on the case,

211
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,229
but they're waiting on El Toro
to make the first move.

212
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,897
And, unofficially,
the federales are waiting

213
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,941
to take their cue from
the Embassy's legal attaché.

214
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,652
That explains why the federales
aren't breaking down any doors.

215
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,362
No one wants
to poke the bull.

216
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,571
Darin, can you get me
an affiliate crew?

217
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,365
We need to tell the world
what's going on.

218
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,034
Savannah called
a news blackout.

219
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,537
When Laura Ling and Euna Lee
were kidnapped by North Korea,

220
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,038
their families relied
on the news

221
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,498
to appeal to their captors.

222
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,458
We know El Toro watches
my show.

223
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,127
He likes me.
I'll make a direct appeal.

224
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,628
I just need a crew.

225
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,297
All right.
I'll do what I can.

226
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,507
In the meantime,
I'll pursue another option.

227
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,591
It's a long shot,

228
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,094
but Carlos Mora's nephew is
in custody.

229
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,762
Maybe we can make a deal.
‐What kind of deal?

230
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,430
Two years ago,
the Cuban government released

231
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,057
an American civilian
on the same day

232
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,518
that we released three
of their intelligence officers.

233
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,602
Now, the feds said
it was a coincidence,

234
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,229
but that's a hell
of a coincidence.

235
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,856
It's an avenue
worth pursuing.

236
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:48,857
Let's stay in touch.

237
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,116
Even if you pry them off,

238
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,243
the windows are boarded
from the outside, as well.

239
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,078
What do you know about
this place? I mean, how
far are we from help?

240
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,540
Not a lot of coming
and going ‐‐

241
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,501
Carlos keeps a small group
so they can move quickly.

242
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,795
He's got safe houses
across the country.

243
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,339
I've heard the guards talking
about moving soon.

244
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,216
The guards talk
in front of you?

245
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,052
Well, they speak
Zapoteca.

246
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,512
They don't know
I understand them,

247
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,764
so they don't watch
their words around me.

248
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,266
Right now,
they're pretty nervous.

249
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,185
Apparently, there was
a recent raid

250
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,937
in one of his compounds
in Saltillo.

251
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,939
He's convinced
one of them sold him out.

252
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,951
You should eat.

253
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,329
I want to talk
to Mr. Mora.

254
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,623
I have a theory
about the raid in Saltillo.

255
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,468
What are you doing?

256
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,178
I'm trying to get
an audience with El Toro.

257
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,471
It's our way out.

258
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,354
El Toro's brother is
Raúl Mora.

259
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,314
Raúl's son is Emilio.

260
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,191
Emilio immigrated
to the U. S. last year.

261
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,859
Four months ago,
he was pulled over

262
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,319
for running a red light.

263
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,654
When local P. D. realized
who they had,

264
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,322
they called the FBI.

265
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,907
The Justice Department threw
the book at this kid ‐‐

266
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,576
I mean, RICO charges,
money laundering, conspiracy.

267
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,370
So does he work
for the cartel?
Unclear.

268
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,955
El Toro tried and failed

269
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,706
to break Emilio out
a couple months ago.

270
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,041
He doesn't have
any sons.

271
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,876
I'm assuming he loves Emilio
and wants him back.

272
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,544
So El Toro might be open
to a trade.

273
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,713
Maybe, if we can convince
the U. S. Attorney

274
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,131
to even consider it.

275
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,426
100 grand.

276
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,387
‐Thank you, Ella.
‐What's that about?

277
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,264
You remember our old client
Graham Barrett?

278
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,057
Well, he still lives
in Mexico, Bradley,

279
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,559
and he has a contact
who can get me to El Toro ‐‐

280
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,811
his mistress, Maria Alvarez.

281
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,479
Wait, Graham is
a money launderer

282
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,605
a‐and a bail jumper.

283
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,232
I mean,
you can't trust him.

284
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,109
Jake, I know you want
to get Julia back,

285
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,194
but this is too dangerous.
I have a private plane waiting
for me, Bradley.

286
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,154
I will check in with you
when I land.

287
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,208
Hi. I'm Louise Herrick.
Thanks for coming.

288
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,418
How quickly
can you set up?

289
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,919
Uh, we'll uplink
to your control room,

290
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,504
and then we'll be all set.

291
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,631
‐The sooner the better.
‐Get yourself wired up, please.

292
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,098
Annie, we go
that uplink yet?

293
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,099
No, nothing yet.

294
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,854
You talk to Rita in New York?
They know we're preempting them?

295
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,689
Yes. I didn't say why.
I just said it was authorized.

296
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,483
Good.
Show me Louise and preview 4.
Got it.

297
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,944
Avery, prompter's loaded
with your copy,

298
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,529
then you'll throw to Louise.
Got it.

299
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,947
How's it going
in here, everybody?

300
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,699
‐Great.
‐Uplink is live.

301
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,867
Okay, we've got picture.

302
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,160
Louise, it's Megan.

303
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,619
I can see you.
Do you copy?

304
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,829
Loud and clear.

305
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,685
Louise.

306
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,479
Louise!

307
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,315
Get the signal back!
Louise!

308
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,448
Are you okay?
Yeah.

309
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,038
Louise, what happened?
Are you okay?

310
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,415
Yeah, we're fine,
but the van is toast.

311
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,042
Without a satellite
or a high‐quality phone,

312
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,376
I'm no use to you.

313
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,462
Okay, please,
go somewhere safe now.

314
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,298
Megan, you need to use
my show to break the news.

315
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,883
The kidnappers have
to understand

316
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,218
how important Julia is.

317
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,886
And if we make noise,
we can pressure

318
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,263
the diplomatic community
to help secure her release.

319
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,182
You've got two hours
to put it together.

320
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,062
Okay.

321
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,397
Get me a copy of Julia's
contact list from her computer.

322
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,067
Find footage
of Julia in WCN B‐roll ‐‐

323
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,318
photos, too.
‐Yes, ma'am.

324
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,946
Megan, we got
to keep this quiet.

325
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,239
I know.

326
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,616
Otherwise,
Savannah will shut us down.

327
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,328
I've been calling my contact

328
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,539
at the State Department
about the possible swap,

329
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,165
but I haven't heard
anything back.

330
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,667
I'm not getting anywhere
with the U. S. Attorney, either.

331
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,586
They don't want to talk
about Emilio Mora.

332
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,797
‐How would you know that?
‐'Cause I know you've tried.

333
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,049
Bradley put in a call
to his attorney this morning.

334
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,593
She called me thinking
there were new charges pending

335
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,845
against her client.

336
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,179
It wasn't hard to put
two and two together.

337
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,390
You're trying to use Emilio
to swap for Julia.

338
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,058
So what if we are?

339
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,685
I want to help.

340
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,728
Like how you helped
Jake get indicted for murder?

341
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,605
Look, I understand
why you don't trust me,

342
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,357
but I care about Julia,

343
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,234
and I'm gonna do
anything I can to help her.

344
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,610
I have some information
that might persuade

345
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,820
the government to act.

346
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,866
‐I'm listening.
‐The case against Emilio relies

347
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,701
upon a confession
he made to his cellmate,

348
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,161
Antonio de Silva.

349
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,038
Now, the problem is de Silva
isn't just some random guy.

350
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,875
The FBI placed him in Emilio's
cell to act as their agent.

351
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,668
Shouldn't that invalidate
the confession

352
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,962
and therefore the entire case
against Emilio?

353
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,047
Absolutely, and if you look
into de Silva's history,

354
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,883
he snitched
on three other cellmates.

355
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,510
If his involvement in
Emilio's case became public,

356
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,512
it would call those verdicts
into question, too.

357
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,181
The FBI would do
just about anything

358
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,807
to avoid that level
of embarrassment.

359
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,934
Right, not to mention
three possible retrials.

360
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,186
Assuming we can orchestrate
the swap,

361
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,313
we need to make sure
Emilio will cooperate.

362
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,857
Can you get us
on the approved‐visitor list?

363
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,192
I'll see what I can do.

364
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,196
♪♪

365
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,201
How do you not
go crazy in here?

366
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,161
I mean, six hours, and I
already feel like I'm losing it.

367
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,913
It helps to stick
to a routine.

368
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,248
Sun comes up ‐‐
I meditate.

369
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,751
I pace the room 500 times
for exercise.

370
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,127
And I've never stopped
reporting.

371
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,046
What do you mean?

372
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:48,257
I listen.
I watch.

373
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,468
I file away everything
that seems important.

374
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,511
‐What have you heard?
‐Raúl is picking up ammo

375
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,681
next Tuesday in Jalisco
from a man called Vicente.

376
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,476
The guards have mentioned fights
between the two brothers.

377
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,770
They think Vicente
might attack Raúl.

378
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,025
You, come with me.

379
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,260
So, tell me ‐‐
What do you know about Saltillo?

380
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,053
Nothing.

381
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,640
That is not
what my brother says.

382
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,350
I lied to him
so I could talk to you.

383
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,935
And here I am.

384
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,771
Your boss, Louise, is not
one to be trusted.

385
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,774
Clearly,
neither are you.

386
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,318
Louise isn't my boss.
I'm <i>her</i> boss.

387
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,195
I'm the one
behind the curtain ‐‐

388
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,573
just like you.
‐Should that impress me?

389
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,325
You come from a town so small
it doesn't even have a name.

390
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,160
You were raised
by your grandmother.

391
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,204
Your mother,
Graciela, taught you

392
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,998
how to turn poppies
into morphine

393
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,666
and morphine into heroin.

394
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,334
You think America's
War on Drugs is a joke.

395
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,378
It's not a radical position,
but I have a feeling

396
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:08,754
a man
of your intelligence has

397
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,964
an interesting take
on the subject.

398
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,175
What is your point?

399
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,344
Let me do the interview ‐‐
one hour.

400
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,221
You can say
whatever you want,

401
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,640
and I will broadcast it
on "LHL,"

402
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,267
which airs
in 130 countries.

403
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,357
You will ask
only the questions I give you,

404
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,734
and you will air
the footage unedited.

405
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:33,404
In exchange,
you will release Ignacio and me.

406
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,785
Do we have a deal?

407
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:48,252
Raúl, get the camera ready
in the other room.

408
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,378
I have to get ready.

409
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,758
You can wear the clothes
I bought for Louise.

410
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,843
Raúl, show her
where they are.

411
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,821
I should have known
you'd show up.

412
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,823
I'm just here
for some fresh air...

413
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,325
and to meet
an old friend.

414
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,163
Graham,
thanks for coming.

415
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,249
Well, I, uh ‐‐ I still owe you
about 10 grand, technically,

416
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,376
so it's my pleasure.

417
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,127
"Technically," huh?
This is Louise.

418
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,253
Louise,
this is Graham Barrett.

419
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,922
I was his lawyer
before he jumped bail

420
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,548
and headed to this side
of the border.

421
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,717
You're gonna help Jake
find El Toro?
Well, I can get you close.

422
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,260
His mistress has
a reputation of doing

423
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,720
just about anything
for a price.

424
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,389
I've got that covered.
Let's go.

425
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,307
All right.

426
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,892
I'd rather you be armed
than sorry.

427
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,102
Hey, hold on.

428
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,978
Your plan is
to just walk up to El Toro

429
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,480
and pay him
to hand over Julia?

430
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,400
No, Louise, I'm here
100% off the record

431
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,360
strictly to negotiate
a prisoner swap ‐‐

432
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,361
Julia for El Toro's
nephew Emilio.

433
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,281
I'm going with you.
If anything happens to her, I ‐‐

434
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,533
I understand.
Come on, let's go.

435
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,172
Good evening. I'm
Avery Whitsell filling
in for Louise Herrick.

436
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,382
We have breaking news.

437
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,967
Julia George,
the executive producer of "LHL,"

438
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,010
has been abducted in Mexico.

439
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,430
It is believed
that drug kingpin Carlos Mora,

440
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,641
A. K. A. "El Toro," is
behind the kidnapping.

441
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,643
We are devoting tonight's show
to her story as we make

442
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,230
a united appeal for her quick
and safe release.

443
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,232
With us tonight is
Dr. Sanjay Gupta,

444
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,109
Julia's friend
and colleague.

445
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,236
Dr. Gupta, how long
have you known Julia?

446
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,529
I guess it's been
about five years now.

447
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,031
We first met while covering
Hurricane Sandy.

448
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,283
And what was that like?

449
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,659
Well, you know,
I should start off

450
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,202
by telling you
that Julia was supposed

451
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,579
to be on vacation
that week in New York,

452
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,788
but then the storm hit.

453
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,040
And, of course, no surprise,
she came in to work.

454
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,460
And after Julia finished
producing her piece,

455
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,004
she started packing up
hospital supplies

456
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,756
and loading patients
into ambulances...
What the hell is going on?!

457
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,466
...for transport
to other hospitals.

458
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,384
And nobody asked her to do that.
I know it's early,

459
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,510
but cut to commercial.
She just saw the need.

460
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,345
Julia is
a pretty remarkable woman.

461
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,930
Thank you, Sanjay.
We'll be right back.

462
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,931
We're clear.

463
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,183
When we get back
from commercial,

464
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,268
air a repeat ‐‐
something upbeat.

465
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,270
No one talks
about Julia.

466
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,272
Savannah, I understand
there's protocol,

467
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,107
but we can't just sit
on our hands.

468
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,234
Every other station will cover
Julia's kidnapping.

469
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,569
If we bury this story now,

470
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,529
the network loses
all credibility.

471
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,531
Which I'm guessing was
your plan all along.

472
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,991
You're only keeping quiet

473
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,785
so we don't void
our insurance policy.

474
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,036
Darin, you're fired.

475
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,374
The story's out.

476
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,959
We don't have a choice now.

477
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,127
Finish the show.

478
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:39,840
What are you
still doing here?

479
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:44,970
All right,
let's keep going.

480
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,935
We're back in 10.

481
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,565
Dad.

482
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,441
Dad!

483
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,653
This isn't fair.

484
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,196
Savannah's just doing
her job, son.

485
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,823
I got in her way.
She fired me.

486
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,157
That's how it works.

487
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,451
You gonna be okay?

488
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,161
Yeah.

489
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,789
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

490
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,208
Don't you worry about me.

491
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,756
Dad.

492
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,133
I'll come by
for Sunday dinner.

493
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,094
I'd really like that.

494
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,895
I'm, uh, ready to begin.

495
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:40,651
I'm Julia George,
and I'm here with Carlos Mora,

496
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,153
the man known to millions
as El Toro.

497
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,531
This interview is being recorded
in an undisclosed location

498
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,700
in a safe house owned
by Mr. Mora.

499
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,411
Uh, please,
call me Carlos.

500
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,290
I'd like to begin
the interview by discussing

501
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,417
the alarming number
of drug‐related deaths

502
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,502
in our two countries ‐‐
by some accounts

503
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,589
750,000 deaths
in the U. S. and Mexico

504
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,132
in the last 15 years.

505
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,843
That is far too many.

506
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,553
I am aware
of the propaganda being told

507
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,680
by the newspapers
and the politicians ‐‐

508
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,390
that I am a terrorist,

509
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,226
that somehow I am the one
to blame for the violence.

510
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,353
But this blood is not
on my hands.

511
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,188
It's on the hands
of the government ‐‐

512
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,940
yours and mine.

513
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,066
What's your solution?

514
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,235
People will use
these drugs regardless.

515
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,322
Why not legalize them,
tax them, and use the money

516
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,240
to support the working people
of my country?

517
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,492
So, you're advocating drugs
as a way to save the poor,

518
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,453
including Schedule I
narcotics?

519
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,913
And to fund
the revolution.

520
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,331
There should be bombs
on every corner

521
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,749
until the state represents
the will and needs

522
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,918
of the people,
including the poor.

523
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:45,007
In a revolution, won't
more families get killed

524
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,301
than institutional
oppressors?

525
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,552
How does that serve
the poor?

526
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,807
Raúl, cut the camera.

527
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,767
Cut the camera.

528
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,855
Do you want to end up
like Ignacio?

529
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,650
You will keep your ignorant
commentary to yourself.

530
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,401
You understand?
‐Yes.

531
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,820
The world has to see
that you support my agenda.

532
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,780
Okay.

533
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,034
Let's try again.

534
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,594
Who are you?

535
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,679
I'm Bradley Gregorian,

536
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,348
and this is my colleague,
Ella Benjamin.

537
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,308
We're here to broker
your release.

538
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,895
My lawyer hasn't said
anything about anything.

539
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,398
Your Uncle Carlos kidnapped
an American journalist.

540
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,816
Our associate is
on his way right now

541
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,442
to negotiate
the exchange.

542
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,486
My uncle hasn't made
an honest deal in his life.

543
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,904
I don't want
to be part of this.

544
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,990
Your uncle tried to break
you out of jail six weeks ago.

545
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,243
No, the media got it wrong.
My uncle didn't try to free me.

546
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,661
He tried to have me killed.

547
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,121
And if I walk out of here
as part of some exchange,

548
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,205
he'll try it again.

549
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,540
Well, if that's true,

550
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,417
what makes you think you're
safer in here than outside?

551
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,252
Our associate is meeting
with his mistress,

552
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,254
Maria Alvarez.
‐It's a trap.

553
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,214
Maria is gonna demand money
and send him off to be murdered.

554
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,757
She'll <i>never</i> betray Carlos.

555
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,259
Do you know
where Carlos is?

556
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:13,303
Emilio, please, help us.
The clock is ticking.

557
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,680
We'll do whatever we can
to get you out of here

558
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,889
and keep you safe.

559
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,642
Please.

560
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,769
Where is your friend
meeting Maria?

561
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,606
Um, northern Mexico,
in Sonora.

562
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,151
My uncle has one safe house
in that territory.

563
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,946
I can tell you where.

564
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,586
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stay here.
I want to go bring Maria out.

565
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:46,628
We should do this
in the open.

566
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,635
What if Maria won't talk?
What if she can't help us?
This will work.

567
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,138
I trust Graham.
A criminal who ran off
without paying you?

568
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,431
He's the only option,
Louise.

569
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,312
Hey. What's going on?
I've got intel on Maria Alvarez.

570
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,272
Do not trust her.

571
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,899
Also, I got
a possible location.

572
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,400
Okay, thanks.
Got to go.

573
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,530
All right,
let's make us a deal.

574
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,283
Maria says she has the
directions to Carlos' compound.

575
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,451
Not to fast.

576
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,119
As you Americans say,
show me the money.

577
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,331
Nice to meet you,
too, Maria.

578
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,249
Hmm.

579
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,461
Carlos is staying in a farm
10 miles outside of Galeana.

580
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,421
There's an unmarked road
after the highway ends.

581
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,923
You can't miss it.
‐Let me guess ‐‐

582
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,424
Is that where
your friends take our truck

583
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,634
and leave us for dead?

584
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,636
That's crazy.
I would never do s‐‐

585
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,013
I just got the real coordinates
to the safe house.

586
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,435
Keep eyes on her
for the rest of the day.

587
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,645
Make sure she talks
to no one.

588
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,021
You got that, boss.

589
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,147
I'll be taking your car.

590
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,318
Consider your debt paid.
Thanks.

591
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,027
Let's go.

592
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,081
Although people think
of Julia and me as competitors,

593
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,916
I call her a friend.

594
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,417
We keep each other
on our toes.

595
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,837
We push each other
to work even harder.

596
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,673
And I beg the captors
to treat this amazing woman

597
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,675
with dignity and respect.

598
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,218
Thank you so much
for your time.

599
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,011
That was news anchor
Greta Van Susteren,

600
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,180
and we'll be back
after commercial.

601
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,598
And we're clear.

602
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,016
We're out of guests.

603
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,518
What do you mean?

604
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,228
We had at least
two other remotes lined up.

605
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,896
No, Anderson Cooper is
on a plane.

606
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,773
Katie Couric's interview with
Princess Kate is running long.

607
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:30,816
Who's up next, Megan?

608
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,818
Stand by.

609
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,444
Okay, we have 15 minutes.

610
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,655
We need to find someone
who knows Julia well,

611
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,116
someone who can make
an emotional plea on her behalf.

612
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,159
I hate to point out the obvious,
but that's you.

613
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,120
No, I have to run
the show.

614
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,831
‐We're running out of options.
‐I can cover for you.

615
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,208
Let's go.
Megan, you're on.

616
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:57,134
Just to wrap up the interview,
we have a few more questions.

617
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,553
Where do you see yourself
post‐revolution?

618
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,764
I'm only concerned
with the people in my country.

619
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,683
Do you see yourself
in a leadership role?

620
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,022
If my people ask me to lead,
I will lead.

621
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,691
It would be an honor.

622
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,110
Thank you, Ms. George.

623
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,282
Okay, uh...

624
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,286
Okay.

625
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,624
We should celebrate.

626
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,375
Um, champagne?

627
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,711
Uh, no, thank you.

628
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,963
Carlos, get in here!

629
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,298
They're talking
about Julia on TV.

630
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,341
Come on.

631
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,842
Oh, oh, <i>sí.</i>

632
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,138
<i>I'm here with "LHL"</i>
<i>senior associate producer</i>

633
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,016
<i>Megan Byrd, Julia George's</i>
<i>second‐in‐command.</i>

634
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,477
<i>Megan, how is</i>
<i>your team holding up?</i>

635
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:52,105
<i>We're all scared</i>
<i>and worried, but we just ‐‐</i>

636
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,941
<i>We want to do right</i>
<i>by our boss.</i>

637
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,568
<i>We want her to be proud</i>
<i>when she comes home.</i>

638
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,320
So, Megan,
what can you tell me

639
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,405
about Julia George
that no one knows?

640
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,284
Why does she inspire
such a fierce loyalty?

641
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,621
A couple months into
this job, I made a mistake.

642
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:10,791
I had drinks with a colleague
from another network,

643
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,251
and I let something slip.

644
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,587
The network brass wanted
to fire me,

645
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,089
but Julia defended me.

646
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:23,637
She said that if I go,
then she goes.

647
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,138
<i>I owe her everything.</i>

648
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,641
<i>And when I think about what</i>
<i>might be happening to her ‐‐</i>

649
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,935
<i>I just want her</i>
<i>to come home.</i>

650
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,269
Nice.

651
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,688
Let's cut to commercial.

652
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,940
We'll be right back.

653
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,066
Look at that.

654
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,110
Your return is gonna be
a huge story,

655
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,237
and the interview is
gonna be well‐received ‐‐

656
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:43,198
perhaps your
best ratings ever.

657
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,200
I actually agree
with you on that.

658
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,871
Megan, you have
to see this.

659
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,540
All right, everyone,
we're back in 20 seconds.

660
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,127
Louise took photos
of Julia's room.

661
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,713
She put up
a hell of a fight.

662
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,965
‐We have to air these.
‐No! Absolutely not.

663
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,300
We made a decision to talk
about Julia's character,

664
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,219
not about the crime
or the kidnappers.

665
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,679
Yeah, but this is part
of the story.

666
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,182
Avery, not the one
we're telling.

667
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:14,896
And we're back
in 5... 4... 3... 2...

668
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,901
<i>It's been almost 24 hours since</i>
<i>Julia George was kidnapped.</i>

669
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,446
<i>We're speaking today with</i>
<i>her friends and loved ones.</i>

670
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,781
<i>But the question</i>
<i>on everyone's mind ‐‐</i>

671
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,075
<i>Why hasn't the kidnapper</i>
<i>made a demand?</i>

672
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:30,162
<i>I'm speaking directly</i>
<i>to El Toro right now.</i>

673
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,163
<i>What do you want?</i>

674
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,789
Avery,
get back on point.

675
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:33,832
You want money?

676
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,542
We have people ‐‐
a whole corporation.

677
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,044
Make a demand.

678
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:39,588
<i>Only a coward would kidnap</i>
<i>a journalist</i>

679
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,798
<i>who was invited</i>
<i>to conduct an interview ‐‐</i>

680
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,133
<i>a coward and a liar.</i>

681
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,468
‐Avery ‐‐
‐You are pathetic.

682
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,344
‐Cut.
‐You are not to be trusted.

683
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,055
‐Cut!
‐You are a weak man...

684
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,390
Go to commercial, dude.
It's only been a minute.
... Carlos Mora...

685
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,309
Who cares? Do it.
... and the full force
of the U. S. government

686
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,852
will make you pay
for what you have done.

687
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,313
Your crimes will not go
unpunished.
Cut!

688
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,023
Avery, go
to commercial now.

689
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,193
<i>We'll be right back.</i>
You.

690
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,528
You're gonna pay for this.

691
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,075
What the hell was that?!

692
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,535
I'm sorry. Just
after seeing those photos ‐‐
You're sorry?!

693
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,912
After seeing
the photos, I...

694
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,581
Carlos, please.

695
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,834
Your people have insulted me
in front of 130 countries.

696
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,127
I had nothing
to do with that.

697
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,337
Here's what's
gonna happen ‐‐

698
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,172
You will go back
to America.

699
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,632
You will air
our interview tomorrow ‐‐

700
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,509
no edits,
no commentary.

701
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:28,386
And Ignacio stays here
another 30 days.
No, that was not our deal.

702
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,930
It is now!!

703
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,391
And if you do anything
to disgrace me,

704
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,143
I will kill him myself.

705
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,312
Then, I'll come
after you.

706
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:42,275
Emilio gave us
El Toro's location.

707
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,485
The feds have been trying
to get him to talk

708
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,778
ever since his arrest.

709
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,655
Yeah, they'd assumed
he was an enemy of the state,

710
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,365
but the truth is he doesn't want
to leave this country.

711
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,242
I told him we'd do our best,
but no promises.

712
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,493
Well, I've got bad news.

713
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,829
The U. S. Attorney won't
even entertain a deal.

714
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,373
He thinks that releasing Emilio
would set a dangerous precedent.

715
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:57,749
And letting
an American die wouldn't?

716
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,167
Bradley, at this point,

717
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,961
Jake has no leverage
with El Toro.

718
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,337
He's on a suicide mission.

719
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,883
You have to call him off.

720
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,306
According
to Bradley's coordinates,

721
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,891
we're practically
on top of the safe house.

722
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,226
I don't see anything.

723
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,232
Damn it.

724
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,986
Jake. Jake!

725
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,992
What now?

726
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:34,744
‐Go with them. Go.
‐Okay.

727
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,580
Easy, easy.

728
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,707
‐Money? Where's the money?

729
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:39,916
Okay, okay.

730
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,305
Julia.

731
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,849
Are you okay?

732
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:56,975
‐What are you doing here?
‐Carlos!

733
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:08,862
Hello, Louise.

734
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,452
So pleased
to finally meet you.

735
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,918
Who are you?

736
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,669
I'm Jake Gregorian.

737
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,004
I'm a lawyer here
to negotiate Julia's release.

738
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,437
I don't need your money.

739
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,106
I have something
that money can't buy, Carlos ‐‐

740
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,524
your nephew's freedom.

741
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,735
Emilio?

742
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,528
You can free my son?

743
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,947
My team is finalizing
a deal for his freedom ‐‐

744
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,199
if you release Julia.

745
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:01,331
So, that is
how you found me?

746
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,792
‐Emilio gave you my location?

747
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,126
This could be good.

748
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,337
Emilio made
a gentleman's agreement

749
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,338
so we could bring
this deal to you.

750
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:11,132
It was off the record.
No one else knows, I swear.

751
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,135
If he's told you,

752
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,345
he's told others.

753
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:16,930
No, Emilio
wouldn't do that.

754
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,890
He's my son.
He's family!

755
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,934
We have to leave here.

756
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,394
We're no longer safe.

757
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,145
We have to go.

758
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,273
Pack everything.
We're leaving.

759
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,399
<i>Sí, jefe.</i>

760
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,150
Take Julia
back to her room.

761
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,362
Kill the lawyer.

762
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,909
Okay.

763
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,376
‐Did they hurt you?
‐I'm fine.

764
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,086
It's you I'm worried about.
‐Shut up, both of you.

765
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,923
Raúl, why not convince Carlos
to take this deal, hmm?

766
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,508
Why not save your son?

767
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,094
We will get justice
for Emilio when it's time.

768
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,222
You have a meeting with
a weapons dealer on Tuesday.

769
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,017
His name is Vicente.
Isn't that true?

770
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,227
‐How would you know that?
‐There's not gonna be any deal.

771
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,146
Carlos paid him to kill you.

772
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,023
If you want
to live past Tuesday,

773
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,692
if you ever want
to see Emilio again,

774
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,193
you've got to trust us.

775
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,155
Get inside.
Move.

776
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:20,035
Please, make yourself
at home.

777
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,582
So, do I call you Carlos
or El Toro?

778
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,504
Whatever you like is fine.

779
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,839
What happens now?

780
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,174
You will travel with me

781
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:38,094
and report on my operations
exclusively.

782
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,764
You like
something to drink?

783
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:41,931
I hope you like wine?

784
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:42,974
I prefer red.

785
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,019
Red it is.

786
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:51,483
You got to be the most famous
journalist in the world.

787
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,443
We'd have to figure out
an arrangement.

788
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,653
I don't work for free.

789
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,281
Money is not a problem.

790
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,243
Only a very wealthy man
would be so uninterested

791
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,745
in a bag of money.

792
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:07,040
What can I say?

793
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,668
It's just
a drop in the ocean.

794
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,713
Mind if I take a look?

795
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,422
Go ahead.

796
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,685
Are you looking
for something?

797
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,111
I'm not an idiot, Louise.

798
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,576
Jake.

799
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,371
He could not be trusted.

800
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,081
Now, sit.
Sit!

801
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,761
Perhaps...

802
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,055
I will grow
to trust you later.

803
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,478
Not just yet.

804
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,447
‐It's done.
‐Good.

805
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,532
Louise will be joining us.

806
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,534
We'll come back and get her
when everything is ready.

807
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:27,996
Carlos, stop!

808
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,168
What are you doing?

809
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,128
You set me up.
You paid Vicente to kill me.

810
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,005
Why would I do that?

811
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,298
You're my brother.

812
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,800
You had a chance
to let Emilio go free.

813
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,053
My son wasting away in jail
because of your crimes!

814
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:47,307
Raúl, put the gun down.
Be reasonable.

815
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:48,600
I'm done taking orders
from you.

816
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,018
You're a dad man!
No!

817
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,117
Please, don't hurt me.

818
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,376
The keys are
in the S. U. V.

819
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,003
Your friends will meet you
by the back door.

820
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,421
‐They're alive?
‐Yes.

821
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,632
‐Now, listen to me ‐‐

822
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,592
I want you to go back
to America.

823
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,177
You get my son out of jail.
You understand?

824
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,889
Now, go.

825
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,988
Come on, get in!

826
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,088
I couldn't see where I was going
the whole way to the safe house.

827
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,006
I had the bag
over my head.

828
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:06,386
And then, he killed a man
like it was nothing.

829
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,012
Why?

830
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,682
Because he took me
and not you.

831
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,228
I'm so sorry, Julia.

832
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,940
It's ‐‐ I'm fine.

833
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,401
I'm glad
they didn't take you.

834
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,944
You would have hated
the food.

835
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,909
I really thought,
at any moment...

836
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,619
he might kill me.

837
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,315
Good evening.

838
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,816
Everyone here
at "Louise Herrick Live" is

839
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,736
grateful for the safe return
of our executive producer,

840
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,196
Julia George,
kidnapped two nights ago

841
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,782
by member
of Carlos Mora's cartel.

842
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:13,870
Mora, known as El Toro, was
found dead in Mexico yesterday.

843
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,873
His brother Raúl Mora is
the suspect in El Toro's murder,

844
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:19,083
and he is still at large.

845
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,294
In a separate
but related story...
Cue the photo.

846
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:24,881
...El Toro's nephew Emilio Mora,
who was being held in California

847
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:27,175
on conspiracy charges, is
in the process

848
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,718
of being released

849
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:31,095
after Assistant U. S. Attorney
Gerald Lee dropped

850
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,555
all charges against him.

851
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,098
I don't buy
that coincidence.

852
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,391
With Carlos Mora dead,

853
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,810
the feds don't need Emilio
for leverage anymore.

854
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,563
Emilio Mora moved
to America several years ago...

855
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,732
Well, maybe I shouldn't have
said that.

856
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,693
... and he graduated
magna cum laude...
I take it you and Ella are
still doing well.

857
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,738
Yeah. Sorry.

858
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:52,325
Oh, never apologize
for having a good source...

859
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:53,868
or being happy.

860
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,204
I'm honored to have a
special guest with us tonight ‐‐

861
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,539
Ignacio Enriquez,
the journalist

862
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,042
from Mexico's
<i>Las Noticias</i> newspaper,

863
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,586
held by Carlos Mora
for three months.

864
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,755
Ignacio, it's good to see you.
How are you doing?

865
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,882
I am good.
Thank you.

866
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,885
I have been granted
an emergency refugee visa,

867
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,930
and I have just accepted
a job covering cartel operations

868
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,182
north of the border
for the <i>L. A. Times.</i>

869
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,559
I have no plans
to back down from my work.

870
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,730
And, of course, I am so thankful
to Julia George.

871
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,024
She, uh ‐‐
She saved my life.

872
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,193
Tell us what kind of work
you'd like to do

873
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,278
now that you've gained
your freedom.

874
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,365
‐Megan, can you take this?
‐Of course.

875
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:33,825
Hey, what's up
with the 911 text?

876
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,326
I'm in the middle
of a show.

877
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,620
Julia,
I have some bad news.

878
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,165
I got a call from a detective
friend of mine in the LAPD.

879
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,584
He knows I represent
Maya Hartman.

880
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,671
Her car was found abandoned
on the Broadway Bridge.

881
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:50,299
She left her keys,
a wallet.

882
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,551
They think
she might have jumped.

883
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,927
She left a note
on the windshield.

884
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,262
What does it say?

885
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,222
"I'm sorry, Julia.
Please help my mom."

886
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,309
We're gonna get
through this together.

887
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,103
You believe me, right?

888
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,146
Yeah.

889
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:05,106
I got to go.
