<i>[Episode 45]

4
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:41,009
My strategy in taking Qi State is indeed
attacking swiftly from the north.

5
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,445
It might seem that we are taking
a longer route

6
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:48,918
but we will be attacking Qi State
from where they least expected it!

7
00:01:50,707 --> 00:01:55,316
By doing so, I just need to take down
Jing Yang and Ping Yang

8
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:56,853
before heading straight for Ye City!

9
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:02,292
I want to take down Qi State
in three battles!

10
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,237
Your Majesty, forgive me for
being so bold as to say that

11
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:09,909
it seems to be too risky and dangerous
to take Qi State in three battles?

12
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:11,599
Please consider your safety
as the priority.

13
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,146
My reason for taking down Qi State
in three battles is to

14
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:17,562
minimize the casualty of our men
and the people of Qi State.

15
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:22,127
Under the tyranny of Gao Wei, the people
of Qi State are already in great misery.

16
00:02:23,807 --> 00:02:28,178
Our invasion of Qi State
is an act of righteousness.

17
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:33,204
Our soldiers must not hurt any
people in Qi State during this battle.

18
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:36,848
Anyone who disobeys my orders
will be sentenced to death!

19
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:39,278
It's our people's blessing to have
a wise King like you!

20
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:40,721
We will obey your orders!

21
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:09,087
Victory will be ours!

22
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:20,719
Wang Shi Liang.

23
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,967
You and your men have always fought well.

24
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:25,621
I'm sure that you'll live up to my
expectations this time as well.

25
00:03:26,742 --> 00:03:29,966
Yes, Your Majesty. We will not fail you!

26
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:41,599
Tian Hong!

27
00:03:43,444 --> 00:03:45,148
I've only taken on this position
for a few days

28
00:03:45,148 --> 00:03:46,848
but Your Majesty already
remembers my name!

29
00:03:55,273 --> 00:04:00,694
I look to you and your men to do
your best on the battlefield.

30
00:04:00,694 --> 00:04:03,813
Conquer the lands for Zhou State!

31
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:05,100
Yes, Your Majesty!

32
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:36,744
Give me some food!

33
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:39,005
Spare me some coins!

34
00:04:39,857 --> 00:04:40,857
Your Majesty!

35
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:44,424
Give me some food! Please...

36
00:04:45,122 --> 00:04:48,723
- Your Majesty...
- Why did you snatch my bowl? Look!

37
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:53,213
Your Majesty! If you keep neglecting
the affairs of this state

38
00:04:53,213 --> 00:04:56,213
we could well be conquered
by Zhou State!

39
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,782
Who cares about that bowl?

40
00:04:57,782 --> 00:05:01,625
Zhou State? What about it?

41
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,368
Zhou State is launching a war
on us without any warning.

42
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:05,471
They have already taken down
Ping Yang City!

43
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,133
Ping Yang City?

44
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:10,654
I can't remember...

45
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:14,353
If Zhou State fancies it
just give it to them!

46
00:05:16,472 --> 00:05:18,406
The army of Zhou is invading with
great ferocity!

47
00:05:18,406 --> 00:05:20,785
Not to mention that Yuwen Yung
is leading the army himself.

48
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:23,460
They couldn't just be
after Ping Yang City.

49
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,636
They will continue down south

50
00:05:25,636 --> 00:05:27,140
and eventually invade Ye City!

51
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,460
Ye City...

52
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:34,179
Look! Look at me.

53
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:40,419
What makes you think that I'm bothered
to manage such matters?

54
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:42,425
I'll leave it to you.

55
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,163
When he really attacks Ye City

56
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:47,400
you will be here anyway.

57
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:52,329
Your Majesty, have you forgotten
who and what you are?

58
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:54,460
You are the King of Qi State!

59
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,933
Not a beggar!

60
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,096
How could you not be concerned
about the state affairs?

61
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:03,245
What are you fussing about
when I'm not even worried?

62
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:11,292
Your Majesty! You'll end up like this
bowl if you don't pick yourself up!

63
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,430
It's been a while, Fifth Prince.

64
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:39,468
Your Majesty, has that annoying rascal
been making you upset?

65
00:06:40,753 --> 00:06:42,797
Prince of An De came to report to me
that the army of Zhou State

66
00:06:42,797 --> 00:06:44,797
has already invaded and
taken over Ping Yang City.

67
00:06:44,797 --> 00:06:46,667
He wants me to get ready for war.

68
00:06:48,262 --> 00:06:50,013
Look at how I am now.

69
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:52,513
How could I be in the right mindset
to think about this matter?

70
00:06:54,473 --> 00:06:56,047
A war?

71
00:06:56,047 --> 00:07:01,239
Your Majesty, I've only read about wars
in books since I was young.

72
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:03,479
I've never been fortunate enough to
look at a battle up close

73
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,939
and witness the splendor of war horses
and the raging troops.

74
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:10,447
Could you let me come with you?

75
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:15,630
My Queen is interested in wars?

76
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,132
The sight of two states at war must be
a magnificent sight to behold.

77
00:07:19,132 --> 00:07:28,735
I believe... Your Majesty must be
dashing in your armor.

78
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:32,762
Sure! My Queen wants to view the war?

79
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:35,415
I'll lead all my armed forces
to a great victory for you!

80
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,294
Your Majesty is in such high spirits!

81
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:40,543
The army of Zhou State is sure to be
petrified to know of such news!

82
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:43,401
I'll get dressed.

83
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:44,559
Do you really want to see me
on the battlefield?

84
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,869
I really do!

85
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:47,069
I'll go to war for you!

86
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:49,389
- Si Xi! Let's get changed!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

87
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:56,538
Fire beacons for war will be lit up.

88
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:03,519
Fourth Prince, by then
when this state is raging in war

89
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,051
I don't believe that you will still
be in hiding.

90
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:14,790
<i>576 AD, the battle of Ping Yang

91
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:19,514
<i>it was recorded in Historical Mirror
Scroll one hundred and seventy-three

92
00:08:19,514 --> 00:08:21,690
<i>that in the fifth year of Jian-De
(Era name of Zhou State)

93
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:26,308
<i>King of Zhou State, Yuwen Yung
gathered an army of 140 thousand men

94
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:29,651
<i>to attack an ailing Qi State.

95
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:32,370
<i>He took a very different route
from the past

96
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,469
<i>and led the army straight into
Jing Province.

97
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:37,158
<i>By the end of October
the army of Zhou arrived 

98
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:39,758
<i>at the gates of Ping Yang City.

99
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,045
I've promised the Queen
a victorious battle

100
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:52,018
so that she can witness the power
of Qi State.

101
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:53,559
Why can't I take down Ping Yang City

102
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,950
after using so many soldiers
in such a long period of time?

103
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,808
Your Majesty, all the soldiers have
already done their very best...

104
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:01,033
I just want to take down Ping Yang City
with no explanations needed.

105
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:02,371
Your Majesty!

106
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:06,282
Deputy General of Ping Yang City
risked his life to report

107
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:08,548
that hundreds of their men are hidden
in the city

108
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,352
and willing to join forces with us
to fight against our enemies.

109
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:13,752
They will open the West Gate
at three in the afternoon today.

110
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:16,472
- Our army can then barge right in!
- Great! This is fantastic!

111
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,644
That will be our chance to triumph
over our enemies!

112
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:20,817
- Yes!
- Your Majesty.

113
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:24,993
I'd love to witness the sight of
our army taking over the city.

114
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:29,435
Could you wait for me to join you
later to witness that sight?

115
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:32,218
Of course, you can.

116
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:33,818
I came out here all for you.

117
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:35,249
So why wouldn't I wait for you?

118
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:36,615
I'll wait for you.

119
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:40,579
Brothers! Let's save Ping Yang City!

120
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,463
Let's save Ping Yang City!

121
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:44,925
Hurry up!

122
00:10:03,138 --> 00:10:05,347
Your Majesty, it is almost
three o'clock in the afternoon!

123
00:10:05,347 --> 00:10:06,622
Please command the troops
to make a move!

124
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:09,607
Wait for a while. A thrilling sight
of our men taking over the city

125
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:11,332
must be witnessed by the Queen.
I've already promised her.

126
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:14,214
Hong-E!

127
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,359
- Your Majesty.
- Where is the Queen?

128
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:20,230
Her Highness is still dressing up.

129
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,711
She said that Your Majesty is here
at war for her sake

130
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:24,317
so she should dress up properly.

131
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:25,403
Get lost!

132
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:30,722
Your Majesty, our men is risking
their lives to open the gates.

133
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:34,578
If we don't attack now, we will
most possibly lose Ping Yang City!

134
00:10:34,578 --> 00:10:35,578
Exactly!

135
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,115
No, I want to wait for the Queen.

136
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:11,418
Gao Chang Gong, as long as
you don't show up

137
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:18,497
Qi State will never have
a day of victory.

138
00:11:23,418 --> 00:11:26,007
Your Majesty, it's already three o'clock!

139
00:11:26,007 --> 00:11:27,378
Please send out the troops!

140
00:11:27,378 --> 00:11:29,294
Exactly! Your Majesty, we can't
afford to wait any longer.

141
00:11:29,294 --> 00:11:31,352
The consequences will be
too ghastly to bear!

142
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:35,142
Keep waiting. I did.

143
00:11:35,142 --> 00:11:36,581
So should everyone else.

144
00:11:37,452 --> 00:11:40,398
Your Majesty, you kept holding off
the right timing to launch the troops.

145
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:44,022
I can't sit around to witness
the death of our men!

146
00:11:44,022 --> 00:11:46,428
I'm going to send my men to
rescue the soldiers in the city!

147
00:11:46,428 --> 00:11:47,748
I will go with you!

148
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:51,428
Reporting! Your Majesty!

149
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:53,710
Ping Yang City is now being conquered!

150
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,169
All the soldiers in the city
were all wiped out!

151
00:12:15,046 --> 00:12:17,442
Your Majesty is so wise. Everything
was as Your Majesty expected.

152
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:19,280
The army of Qi is defeated
and ours have won.

153
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:21,888
The ruler of Qi State is incompetent.

154
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:27,019
He's forsaken his opportunity and
disregarded the lives of his men.

155
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:30,947
It makes no difference whether or not
he is leading the army.

156
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:34,962
Do not harm any civilians of Qi State!

157
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:38,041
Enter the city!

158
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:54,289
<i>[Ping Yang City]

159
00:12:54,627 --> 00:12:58,121
Fourth Prince, I'll take my leave now.

160
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:10,583
Is it news from Fifth Prince?

161
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,619
Are there news from Ye City?

162
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:18,857
Yuwen Yung attacked Qi State
from the north.

163
00:13:18,857 --> 00:13:20,425
He has already taken Ping Yang City.

164
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:25,587
I'm not surprised that Yuwen Yung
sent out his troops to Qi State.

165
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:27,810
But I hadn't expected him
to do so that soon.

166
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,961
My brother has news that

167
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:33,305
after Yuwen Yung took Ping Yang

168
00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:35,555
he didn't slaughter or rob our people
like Yuwen Hu did.

169
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:39,026
He warned his men not to
harass the people.

170
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:42,652
Therefore, our people are still safe.

171
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:48,250
He did keep my words in mind.

172
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,040
Even if the day comes when he has to
stop a war with another war

173
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,196
he will not harm the innocent civilians.

174
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:00,462
The battle has begun.

175
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:05,372
My brother said that General Hulu has gone
with the King to take Ping Yang City back.

176
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:09,763
But he himself angered the King
with his constant advice

177
00:14:09,763 --> 00:14:12,934
and is now imprisoned in An De Manor.

178
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:15,213
Is he and Xiao Cui all right?

179
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:18,319
The house arrest should be temporary.

180
00:14:33,891 --> 00:14:37,868
Fourth Prince, both kings are leading
their armies in person.

181
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:41,267
What is your perspective on this battle?

182
00:14:45,113 --> 00:14:47,552
Zhou State avoided attacking major
cities like Luo Yang.

183
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:49,585
They launched an unexpected attack
from the north.

184
00:14:49,585 --> 00:14:52,701
He can reach Ye City after taking
down two cities.

185
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,395
But the army of Zhou came from afar
and will be exhausted from travel.

186
00:14:57,395 --> 00:15:01,484
Geographically speaking, our army
should have the upper hand.

187
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,954
But when two armies collide

188
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:08,544
victory depends on the ability
of the commander.

189
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:37,546
Your Majesty, don't pull
such a long face.

190
00:15:37,546 --> 00:15:41,432
Or I'll think that you're secretly
holding a grudge against me.

191
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:44,339
I don't blame you.

192
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:49,163
I blame my men for not being able
to defend Ping Yang City.

193
00:15:49,163 --> 00:15:51,201
Don't worry about it, Your Majesty.

194
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,171
It's just a city.

195
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:54,823
If Yuwen Yung wants it

196
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:56,335
just give it to him out of sympathy.

197
00:15:56,335 --> 00:16:00,913
Your Majesty, Ping Yang City was taken
and we suffered great casualty

198
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:04,231
because of Her Highness.

199
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:10,966
Your Highness, you now trample the souls
of our men under your feet!

200
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:14,390
- I'm so scared, Your Majesty.
- Hulu Guang!

201
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,603
Mind your manners.

202
00:16:16,603 --> 00:16:19,825
You were conferred the title of
Great General by the late King.

203
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:22,724
I respect that but you should know
not to go overboard.

204
00:16:24,553 --> 00:16:29,918
Your Majesty, generations of my family
have served Qi State loyally.

205
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:34,041
My son, Xu Da died in the war.

206
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:38,576
I have no regrets that he died
serving our state!

207
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:44,193
But this battle that took place today
is unworthy of my son's sacrifice!

208
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,581
You favor the villains and
neglected the state affairs.

209
00:16:48,581 --> 00:16:52,235
And you! Evil Queen!

210
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:54,785
Qi State will ruined by you!

211
00:16:54,785 --> 00:16:56,192
Are you aware of that?

212
00:16:57,123 --> 00:17:00,618
Are you indicating that
I am an evil queen?

213
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:01,698
Exactly!

214
00:17:01,698 --> 00:17:04,238
Hulu Guang! How insolent of you!

215
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:06,701
You don't think that I'll kill you?

216
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:08,984
I do.

217
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:14,482
If I haven't been entrusted by
Prince of Lan Ling to assist you

218
00:17:14,482 --> 00:17:18,871
I'd have retired and live in seclusion.

219
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:26,095
I'm in living hell having to serve a
fatuous king and evil queen like you!

220
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:31,009
Your Majesty, my life can be sacrificed.

221
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:35,510
But Qi State will now be ruined in
the hands of a fatuous king like you!

222
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:40,415
Fine! Since you've always thought me
inferior to Gao Chang Gong

223
00:17:40,415 --> 00:17:42,078
I'll grant you your death.

224
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:43,545
- Guards!
- At your service!

225
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:46,240
- Execute Hulu Guang on the spot.
- Yes!

226
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,040
Your Majesty!

227
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,522
The army of Zhou State is attacking
with great ferocity.

228
00:17:52,522 --> 00:17:55,031
And yet ours is losing all the battles.

229
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:58,047
General Hulu has fought Zhou State
countless times.

230
00:17:58,047 --> 00:17:59,488
He has had great merits!

231
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:03,018
Honest advice is always harsh
but you're going to kill him for it?

232
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:07,142
This will only cause us pain
but benefit our enemies!

233
00:18:07,142 --> 00:18:08,674
I don't believe in that.

234
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:12,151
Would Qi State be destroyed
without Hulu Guang?

235
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:23,822
I have such regrets...

236
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:29,907
If only the throne was given
to Prince of Lan Ling

237
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:35,121
Qi State would never be in
such a predicament!

238
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:40,205
Your Majesty, please don't!

239
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:43,569
Who would fight the war for you
if you kill the general?

240
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:45,884
Who would protect Qi State for you?

241
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:16,031
General!

It was our foolish loyalty that
brought you to this end...

249
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:59,449
His Majesty can't tolerate his kinsmen

250
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,711
and now he can't even bear to
take in honest advice!

251
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:04,444
- Do you like him so much?
- Your Majesty!

252
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:05,761
Prince of Lan Ling!

253
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:07,824
Please don't be angry, Your Majesty!

254
00:20:07,824 --> 00:20:10,221
Don't upset yourself because of
these sinful subjects.

255
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:13,204
Here, have a seat, Your Majesty.

256
00:20:13,704 --> 00:20:16,667
Don't be angry, Your Majesty.

257
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,714
Don't be angry...

258
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:24,814
Why don't we imprison Duan Shao first
and then execute him later?

259
00:20:24,814 --> 00:20:25,938
What do you think?

- Guards!
- At your service!

Throw Duan Shao in prison
and head back to the palace!

262
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:34,595
Yes!

263
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:39,674
Dear brother... I'll be joining you soon!

264
00:20:39,674 --> 00:20:43,861
- Evil Queen! You'll die tragically!
- Don't be angry.

265
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:46,172
- I'll kill you, old man!
- Don't be angry.

- Evil Queen...
- Don't be angry, Your Majesty.

267
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:50,360
Be good, don't be angry.

268
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,163
Your Majesty, Ye City is at a great risk.

269
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:06,329
Although we have tens of thousands of
soldiers here at Ye City

270
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:08,081
we might still not be able to fend off
the army of Zhou State.

271
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:09,920
May I be so bold as to suggest that

272
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,353
Your Majesty relocate our capital
to the south

273
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:14,781
in order for Qi State to survive.

274
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:19,566
Your Majesty, I also think that
it's hard to defend Ye City against Zhou.

275
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:21,458
We should relocate down south
immediately to seek refuge!

276
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,338
Your Majesty, you mustn't!

277
00:21:23,338 --> 00:21:26,059
Once Ye City is taken, we will be
utterly defenseless.

278
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:27,160
It would be no less that being defeated!

279
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,156
Your Majesty, please defend
Ye City to your death!

280
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:33,884
Neither could we go to war

281
00:21:33,884 --> 00:21:36,170
nor could we defend ourselves

282
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,792
what are you asking of me?

283
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:42,887
Why don't you just tell me that
Qi State has already been subjugated!

284
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,957
A bunch of useless bums!

285
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:52,315
Get lost.

286
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:16,095
Your Highness.

287
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:19,030
What's the matter with the King?

288
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,038
Since the defeat of Ping Yang

289
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:23,949
the King has been discussing strategies
with the officials to win the war.

290
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:27,029
Now that Jing City has been conquered
Ye City is in great peril.

291
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:29,079
His Majesty is very anxious.

292
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,435
- You may dismiss.
- Yes.

293
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,459
Your Majesty, have some wine
to let off some steam.

294
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,678
The army of Zhou State will soon
be here in the blink of an eye.

295
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,903
Will you be frightened, My Queen?

296
00:23:02,437 --> 00:23:05,290
I won't be scared as long as
I am with you.

297
00:23:06,482 --> 00:23:08,822
I'm at ease knowing that
you won't be scared.

298
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:10,804
I have a plan.

299
00:23:10,804 --> 00:23:13,706
It will not only rid us of our fear
for the army of Zhou State

300
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:15,977
but also allow us to
be together for life.

301
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:19,854
What plan do you have in mind?

302
00:23:21,758 --> 00:23:24,779
The army of Zhou State is attacking
at full force this time.

303
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,297
We will be helpless and defenseless.

304
00:23:28,297 --> 00:23:31,995
Indeed, I do not have the capacity
to rule a state.

305
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:34,699
But I refuse to surrender to Zhou State.

306
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:38,225
Therefore, I've decided to
burn down Ye City

307
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:41,916
before the army of Zhou State arrives.

308
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,370
Burn down Ye City?

309
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,109
This is a red herring.

310
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:49,872
The army of Zhou State will think that
I have killed myself in the fire.

311
00:23:49,872 --> 00:23:52,272
But the truth is, we would have both
fled the palace by then.

312
00:23:52,272 --> 00:23:55,493
Gao Wei and Feng Xiao Lian
will no longer exist.

313
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:58,021
We will just be another loving couple.

314
00:24:02,893 --> 00:24:04,529
Are you willing to go along
with my plan?

315
00:24:07,842 --> 00:24:09,441
Yes, I do.

316
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:11,479
It's a brilliant plan, Your Majesty.

317
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:14,524
But I think that this plan must be
known to as few people as possible.

318
00:24:14,524 --> 00:24:17,547
The morale of the army will be influenced
should this plan be known to them.

319
00:24:17,547 --> 00:24:21,081
Why don't we station large troops of
soldiers right outside the palace gate?

320
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:23,468
We'll just have some guards
in the palace to protect us?

321
00:24:23,468 --> 00:24:25,567
What do you think about that?

322
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:28,163
My Queen is indeed very thoughtful.

323
00:24:28,163 --> 00:24:29,720
I'll send some men to get that done.

324
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:36,208
Xiao Lian, are you truly willing to
lead an ordinary life with me

325
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,208
as husband and wife?

326
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:45,050
Your Majesty, that is my honor.

327
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:49,651
I'm so happy.

328
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:56,902
I will retire to my chamber now
to get ready for our escape.

329
00:25:07,436 --> 00:25:08,671
Your Highness.

330
00:25:10,028 --> 00:25:11,200
Your Highness.

331
00:25:12,197 --> 00:25:14,995
Hong-E, send out my orders.

332
00:25:14,995 --> 00:25:18,257
Behead Duan Shao tomorrow at noon.

333
00:25:18,257 --> 00:25:20,187
Yes, Your Highness.

334
00:25:22,591 --> 00:25:25,899
<i>Gao Chang Gong, I don't believe that
you'll still be in hiding

335
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,552
<i>if I execute Duan Shao in public.

336
00:25:31,457 --> 00:25:32,955
Gao Wei is sick!

337
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:38,830
A Great General was toyed
to death by him!

338
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:47,327
Old General Hulu taught us martial arts
and sword fighting since we were little.

339
00:25:47,327 --> 00:25:50,155
He was like an elderly relative to us.

340
00:25:50,155 --> 00:25:54,918
Who would have thought that
he would be...

341
00:25:54,918 --> 00:25:57,992
The housekeeper of Imperial Tutor
came to me last night.

342
00:25:57,992 --> 00:26:00,062
I only knew about this then.

343
00:26:00,062 --> 00:26:03,624
I barged into the palace to seek audience
with the king but he drove me out.

344
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:07,218
Yuwen Yung will soon attack Ye City.

345
00:26:07,218 --> 00:26:10,404
The King plans to burn down Ye City
and sacrifice all of our people!

346
00:26:13,726 --> 00:26:15,808
Gao Wei is bringing upon
his own downfall.

347
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:18,043
It's a matter of time that
Qi State is ruined.

348
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:21,855
After we lost Ping Yang City,
we've also lost the crucial Jing Yang.

349
00:26:21,855 --> 00:26:23,917
We're now too fatigued to
hold out on a long battle.

350
00:26:25,162 --> 00:26:28,475
His Majesty missed several chances to
attack because of the evil queen.

351
00:26:28,475 --> 00:26:30,236
The morale of our army is obviously low.

352
00:26:30,236 --> 00:26:33,970
We then lost all the battles.

353
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,435
A wolf that leads a pack of lambs
is sure to win a pack of wolves

354
00:26:36,435 --> 00:26:38,235
that are lead by a lamb.

355
00:26:39,251 --> 00:26:40,849
How is the Imperial Tutor?

356
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:45,656
The evil queen will have him executed
tomorrow at noon!

357
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:50,771
Fourth Prince.

358
00:26:52,326 --> 00:26:59,067
You once promised me that we
will face all dangers together.

359
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:04,680
Say whatever you have in mind now
to Fifth Prince in my presence.

360
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,551
If I couldn't read your mind

361
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:14,407
after hearing that Imperial Tutor
will soon be executed

362
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:17,199
I'm not fit to be your wife.

363
00:27:18,394 --> 00:27:22,963
There's not a minute to waste to save
Imperial Tutor and the people of Ye City.

364
00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:32,188
Send my message to Imperial Tutor
when you get back to the city.

365
00:27:32,188 --> 00:27:34,392
Tell him that he must hang in there.

366
00:27:34,392 --> 00:27:36,655
I'll be sure to rescue him.

367
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:40,595
We'll meet up at your manor
again tonight.

368
00:27:40,595 --> 00:27:41,762
All right.

369
00:27:42,676 --> 00:27:44,292
Fifth Prince.

370
00:27:46,437 --> 00:27:51,034
Fourth Prince, why don't we have
Fifth Prince bring Xiao Cui over

371
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:55,860
to look after each other while
the men are at work?

372
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:02,111
I'll be more at ease if Xiao Cui is here
with my sister-in-law.

373
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:04,770
I'll go and get ready.

374
00:28:08,128 --> 00:28:09,128
My brother!

375
00:28:10,283 --> 00:28:11,578
Fourth Brother.

376
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:19,163
Gather Yang Shi Shen and our men to
your manor tonight.

377
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:21,596
We'll have a better chance with more men.

378
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:27,006
Besides rescuing Imperial Tutor Duan

379
00:28:28,753 --> 00:28:31,187
I'm also going to get rid of the
evil queen and fatuous king.

380
00:28:33,321 --> 00:28:35,764
I will definitely follow your orders.

381
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,493
Will you not tell your wife
about the assassination?

382
00:28:47,438 --> 00:28:49,081
I'll think about it.

383
00:28:53,393 --> 00:28:54,439
All right.

384
00:29:08,089 --> 00:29:15,243
I've packed your mask in this bag along
with some medications just in case.

385
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:19,345
Xue Wu.

386
00:29:23,744 --> 00:29:26,371
Even if you won't tell me

387
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:28,451
I could guess easily that

388
00:29:28,451 --> 00:29:30,846
on your mission to rescue
Imperial Tutor Duan

389
00:29:30,846 --> 00:29:32,949
you are bound to go up
against Gao Wei and Zheng Er.

390
00:29:34,204 --> 00:29:37,902
Perhaps, that was the real reason
why you came back to life.

391
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:42,339
You're to put an end to the war that
Qi State is destined to lose

392
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:45,038
so our people can be spared.

393
00:29:49,112 --> 00:29:54,602
Tens of years, what has the Gao family
given to the people?

394
00:29:57,158 --> 00:30:02,069
Nothing except for misery and turmoil.

395
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:06,587
There is Prince of Lan Ling.

396
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:10,034
The people know that no matter
how hard their life might be

397
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:12,509
Prince of Lan Ling will bring them hope.

398
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:16,172
Now that Prince of Lan Ling is dead
there's still the masked warrior.

399
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:22,548
Fourth Prince, you have to go.

400
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,414
Xue Wu, are you really willing to
let me go on this mission?

401
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:41,718
As a mother

402
00:30:41,718 --> 00:30:45,478
it pains me to see how the state
is now in war

403
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:47,557
and children in suffering.

404
00:30:47,557 --> 00:30:53,941
I've always supported your every
decision with abandonment.

405
00:30:55,711 --> 00:30:59,722
As for every decision that I make

406
00:30:59,722 --> 00:31:03,069
I'm sure that you'll support it as well.

407
00:31:08,614 --> 00:31:10,091
Xue Wu...

408
00:31:12,608 --> 00:31:16,001
You're such a brave, strong and
unique woman.

409
00:31:18,053 --> 00:31:23,739
I have nothing to regret
with you as my wife.

410
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:56,064
Your Majesty, I've already carried
out your orders.

411
00:31:56,064 --> 00:31:58,765
There are only ten some guards
left in the palace.

412
00:31:58,765 --> 00:32:00,690
A large troop is stationed
outside the city.

413
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,322
The people have no idea that
Ye City will soon be burned down.

414
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,822
Please rest assured.

415
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:19,150
What about the arrangement
for the corpses?

416
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,894
I've also carried out your orders.

417
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,857
Bring them over!

418
00:32:29,298 --> 00:32:34,750
I'm made your personal guard and the
Queen's maid, Hong-E take their lives

419
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,290
to use their corpses as
replacements for you and the queen.

420
00:33:14,497 --> 00:33:16,239
Take them to the main hall.

421
00:33:25,465 --> 00:33:30,023
Great... Si Xi, you've done very well.

422
00:33:30,023 --> 00:33:36,165
But I'm worried that this secret will be
leaked if others know about this?

423
00:33:36,165 --> 00:33:37,469
Definitely not.

424
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:39,473
No one else will know about this.

425
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,769
Please spare me, Your Majesty...

426
00:33:58,424 --> 00:34:01,767
I wouldn't say a word about it!

427
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,728
Get up!

428
00:34:12,482 --> 00:34:14,140
I like you.

429
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:20,171
Tell me how long you have been
serving me?

430
00:34:21,913 --> 00:34:23,671
I've been here for ten some years.

431
00:34:23,671 --> 00:34:26,163
I've served both the deceased king
and you, Your Majesty.

432
00:34:26,163 --> 00:34:27,779
I might not have any merits

433
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:30,090
but I did work really hard.

434
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:39,901
Ten years have gone by so quickly.

435
00:34:39,901 --> 00:34:44,324
So... it could be said that
you watched me grow up.

436
00:34:44,324 --> 00:34:45,913
I wouldn't dare say so.

437
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:57,239
Si Xi, I've been grateful to you
for all these years.

438
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:02,502
I offer you this wine as a toast. Here.

439
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:05,570
Your Majesty...

440
00:35:08,163 --> 00:35:13,662
What? Are you rejecting my gratitude?

441
00:35:20,137 --> 00:35:21,268
Drink it up.

442
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,346
Thank you, Your Majesty.

443
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,024
Yes, Si Xi, I know that
you are suffering.

444
00:35:44,024 --> 00:35:45,368
I know that you are suffering.

445
00:35:45,368 --> 00:35:46,729
Bear with it.

446
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:48,506
It's almost over, Si Xi.

447
00:35:48,506 --> 00:35:51,070
Bear with it. It's almost over!

448
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,144
It's almost over!

449
00:35:57,542 --> 00:35:58,888
It's almost over...

450
00:35:58,888 --> 00:36:00,414
- Your Majesty!
- It's almost over...

451
00:36:03,882 --> 00:36:06,922
Xiao Lian!

452
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,199
Why have you come so late?

453
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:12,332
I'm petrified.

454
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,158
I've decided to burn down
Ye City tomorrow.

455
00:36:20,158 --> 00:36:21,633
I've got everything in place.

456
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:23,969
Gao Wei and Feng Xiao Lian
will no longer exist.

457
00:36:23,969 --> 00:36:25,734
I'll escape from the palace with you!

458
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,743
I want to lead an ordinary life with you.

459
00:36:31,313 --> 00:36:32,519
What do you say?

460
00:36:33,615 --> 00:36:39,316
So... you've arranged for Hong-E's
corpse to be my replacement?

461
00:36:39,316 --> 00:36:42,478
You've arranged corpses to replace ours?

462
00:36:48,621 --> 00:36:50,667
Come here, Your Majesty.

463
00:37:08,803 --> 00:37:09,803
Here...

464
00:37:13,069 --> 00:37:14,167
Keep me company.

465
00:37:20,534 --> 00:37:26,199
Your Majesty, this is your final night
in the palace.

466
00:37:27,965 --> 00:37:30,152
You have to rest well.

467
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:38,001
Here.

468
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,451
I might mess things up if I fall asleep.

469
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:52,552
I'd like to stay alert so that

470
00:37:52,552 --> 00:37:56,369
I can escape with you
at the right timing.

471
00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:00,359
Could I... not take the medication?

472
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:06,496
Since we're running for our lives

473
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:08,903
we'll need to be re-energized.

474
00:38:08,903 --> 00:38:12,151
Your Majesty, heed my advice.

475
00:38:12,151 --> 00:38:15,594
Rest well so that you will have
the energy to escape with me.

476
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:21,966
Here.

477
00:38:23,913 --> 00:38:25,177
Take your medication.

478
00:38:30,348 --> 00:38:32,467
Your words make perfect sense.

479
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:49,011
<i>Xiao Lian, this is already
our last night here.

480
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:52,603
<i>What is it that you are lying to me about?

481
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:59,193
These are?

482
00:39:59,193 --> 00:40:00,708
This wooden horse...

483
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:06,475
was carved by me whenever
I miss you and Ping An.

484
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,589
This wooden sword...

485
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,494
was made by my mother
when I was little.

486
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:23,785
I'm leaving all of these to Ping An.

487
00:40:36,072 --> 00:40:37,486
What about that sketch?

488
00:40:38,902 --> 00:40:40,208
It's?

489
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:45,543
One day when Ping An
asks about his father

490
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:48,028
and what he looked like

491
00:40:50,443 --> 00:40:52,634
you can show him the sketch.

492
00:40:52,634 --> 00:40:54,129
That's unnecessary.

493
00:41:07,805 --> 00:41:09,846
There's no need for that.

494
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,390
Even without it, I can tell Ping An that...

495
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:22,081
his father was a uniquely gorgeous man.

496
00:41:25,313 --> 00:41:29,773
I even accidentally mistook him
for a woman.

497
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:37,174
He had such deep and beautiful eyes.

498
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:42,110
He wasn't very good with his words

499
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:44,741
but if you look into his eyes

500
00:41:46,126 --> 00:41:48,441
you will know what
his true feelings are.

501
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:57,372
He has a tall nose.

502
00:42:01,243 --> 00:42:07,466
He had that charming, boyish look
when he smiled.

503
00:42:10,372 --> 00:42:16,384
He had scars of all shapes and sizes
all over his body.

504
00:42:19,855 --> 00:42:24,689
He... is the best man in the world.

505
00:42:53,123 --> 00:43:00,123
