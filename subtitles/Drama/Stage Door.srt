1
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,920
# La-la-la-de-de-de...

2
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,800
# ..de-de-de-de-te-te-te-ti-ta...

3
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,640
# ..ta-ta-te-te-de-du-do-doo. #

4
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,280
- Do you have to do that? 
- RING RING

5
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,320
Get that, Hattie.

6
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,680
Is it for me? I don't know.

7
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,280
Miss Ju-u-u-dith.

8
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,240
- It's yours, Judy. 
- What? Oh...

9
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,280
Look what mother sent. What are they? Pecans.

10
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, I COULD get out of my date.

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,240
- ..sure I'll get a girl. 
- Where is she...

12
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,840
- Take 'em off. 
- Are you speaking to me?

13
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,880
- You heard me. 
- What do you mean? 
- Come on, get 'em off. 
- They're mine!

14
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,920
- They are not! I'm not starving to buy you stockings. 
- You owe me a pair.

15
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,280
Mrs Orcutt, Linda's doing a strip-tease. Why don't you split 'em?

16
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,200
Go bare-legged. Places YOU go, it won't matter.

17
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,520
What's the trouble? What kind of place are you running?

18
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,600
What is going on? She's accusing me of stealing stockings...

19
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,600
- They're the last you get from me. 
- How can I run a decent house... 
- You're doing your best!

20
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,080
- This guttersnipe... 
- I'll guttersnipe you!

21
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,680
I will not have this in my house!

22
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,080
- I'll slap her ears. 
- I'd like to see you! 
- Come here then.

23
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,520
Girls, girls. I'm moving in with Madeline.

24
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:33,280
- It won't take long. Everything you own is on your back. 
- Is this brawl over?

25
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,320
- You're all I want to find missing! 
- No, nothing ever happens here!

26
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,360
8 o'clock. You betcha. Goodbye.

27
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,480
- Do you want a date? 
- Huh?

28
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,520
- Do you want a date? 
- More lumbermen? 
- Must I apologise for Seattle?

29
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:57,880
- The last lot were MADE of wood. 
- All right...stay and gorge yourself on lamb stew. Pat, want a date?

30
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:04,240
- Is it for dinner? 
- Yes. 
- Why didn't you say so? That stew's got me counting sheep!

31
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,280
- It's different when it's dinner. 
- I feel safer when we're sitting.

32
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,960
- Try being less insulting this time. 
- Me, insulting to a lumberman? The very idea is preposterous!

33
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,960
- Do we dress? 
- I suppose so. We usually do. 
- I'll be there, pet.

34
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,000
You know me, the lumberman's delight.

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,240
Mr Powell's car, for Miss Shaw. I'll tell her.

36
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,240
- For Linda? 
- Mr Powell's car. 
- I'll be the carrier pigeon.

37
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,840
Oh, Linda, Mr Powell's car is here.

38
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,160
Mr Powell isn't, just his car.

39
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,360
Peaceful place (!)

40
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,280
Anybody use a couple of tired peasants?

41
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,240
How was the matinee? >

42
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,840
More people on stage than in the audience.

43
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,880
It makes me sick. What's Gerda sick about?

44
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,920
- Five weeks rehearsal, two weeks pay. 
- Show closing? 
- Like a tired clam.

45
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,000
Aw, that's too bad. Let's all go on relief.

46
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,040
TAP ON DOOR

47
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,240
What's that? Mice.

48
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,280
How do you get in here?

49
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,400
Use the other door! Can't you read?

50
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:28,320
- ANOTHER show folding. 
- We should move in with scenery. 
- Yeah! 
- DOORBELL

51
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,960
Hattie, the mice are back.

52
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,560
- How many doors are there? 
- How many do you want? 
- I asked a civil question.

53
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,600
- I want to see about accommodation. 
- Which keeper's on duty, Hattie? 
- GIRLS LAUGHING

54
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,000
- How amusing(!) 
- Take a seat.

55
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,040
- I'll get Mrs Orcutt. 
- Thank you, thanks.

56
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,240
Pardon me, I shall take the wolfhounds for a stroll.

57
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,320
- If you spoke louder everyone might hear. 
- I forget you're old and deaf.

58
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,960
If you'd more respect, Mr Powell might send his car for YOU one day.

59
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,280
I can't wait.

60
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,480
- But he'd probably send YOU back. 
- Oh, yeah?

61
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,360
- What about his chauffeur? 
- Ah, he doesn't go as far as Mr Powell.

62
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,480
- Even a chauffeur needs an incentive. 
- You should know(!)

63
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,360
Enjoy your lamb stew again tonight.

64
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,840
- I'll think of you while dining on pheasant bordelaise. 
- Ooh, girls, bordelaise!

65
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,640
Don't eat the bones and give yourself away.

66
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:49,000
- Did you wish to see me? 
- This IS a theatrical boarding house? 
- One of the finest. 
- I had begun to doubt it.

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,080
Are you the person I see about accommodation?

68
00:06:53,080 --> 00:07:00,680
- Yes, indeed! Pardon my appearance, I've been in the kitchen. 
- I would like a private bath.

69
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,920
- Did I say anything strange? 
- Oh, don't mind the girls, we're one happy family.

70
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,720
I may not be able to give you just what you want.

71
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,440
- I CAN put you with a charming girl. 
- How much is it? 
- 13, if you share.

72
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,280
Is there a reduction by the week?

73
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:31,640
- It is 13 a week. 
- Oh, my mistake. 
- That doesn't include luncheon. 
- Do meals go with the 13?

74
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,160
MRS ORCUTT: Yes, and we have a lovely kitchen.

75
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,840
- I have no change. 
- I'll be here for a while.

76
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,680
What shall I do about my baggage?

77
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,040
- Get Miss...? 
- Terry Randall. 
- Miss Randall's baggage.

78
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,600
Pardon me, has Mr Hargraves called me yet? Why, no.

79
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,960
When he does, tell him I couldn't consider his play...

80
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,920
How do you do. This is Miss Randall. Are you in the theatre?

81
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,760
- Not yet. 
- With proper coaching...

82
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,840
- Come with me, please. 
- Excuse me.

83
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,000
- Put the trunks in Miss Maitland's room. 
- What's that?

84
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,720
It's a feature of the club.

85
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,880
It's the chair Bernhardt sat in while rehearsing. I was in the company.

86
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,240
- Oh, you were an actress? 
- Mrs Orcutt supported ME in lots of shows.

87
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:40,520
- That's Bernhardt's picture. They say she was wonderful. 
- She was very good although,

88
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:47,040
- it isn't well known, we had the same coach. 
- Coach? Acting's just common sense.

89
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,240
A good coach applies common sense. If I don't get the right play soon, I may do some coaching myself.

90
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:12,600
- What is this? Another boat docking? 
- Mrs Orcutt told me to put them here. 
- This is not a store-room.

91
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:19,400
- Jean, this is your new room-mate, Miss Randall. 
- We've met before, after a fashion.

92
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,680
I'm sure you'll get on very well.

93
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,080
- I'm sure. 
- Anything else? 
- No, thanks.

94
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,840
- When does your baggage get here? 
- The rest arrives tomorrow.

95
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,720
Well, we can always sleep in the hall(!)

96
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,360
What about the wolfhounds? You don't mind animals?

97
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,920
- I've roomed with them before. 
- I can see that(!)

98
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,960
- Fresh kill? 
- Yes, I trapped them myself.

99
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:05,200
- Can I ask a personal question? 
- Another! 
- These trunks full of bodies? 
- Just those.

100
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:13,240
- We can always live in the trunks. 
- Good idea. You don't mind helping? Sorry, I forgot you're not a maid.

101
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,280
Oh, that's all right. What a lovely dress, made by loving hands?

102
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,720
- Every stitch. 
- Do you cook? 
- Nothing fancy, just plain home cooking.

103
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,320
Bet you boil a great pan of water!

104
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,040
- You don't mind if I put this here? 
- Why not, it'll scare moths away(!)

105
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,400
- Friend? 
- It happens to be my grandfather.

106
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:43,960
- Quite a resemblance round the whiskers(!) 
- That's intelligent, for you(!)

107
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,000
He seems pretty generous.

108
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,560
- He treated me well. 
- Bet you wish he was younger.

109
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,920
In addition to your other charms, you've that insolence caused by an inferior upbringing.

110
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,320
Fancy clothes, fancy language and everything(!)

111
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,520
I also learned to speak English correctly.

112
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,160
We talk pig-latin here.

113
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,160
- And I use the right knife and fork. 
- All you'll need is the knife.

114
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,240
- Mind if I hang these things here? I must take my bath. 
- That might help(!)

115
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Half the wardrobe is yours. Get rid of anything in your way.

116
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,040
I expected a rabbit to jump out of that hat(!)

117
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,080
Orcutt nearly fainted at the 50.

118
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,240
< What's she doing HERE with 50?

119
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,040
It must be counterfeit.

120
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,080
I think she's a phoney.

121
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,320
When she asked if 13 included meals!

122
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,280
- Maybe she's slumming. 
- Yeah! 
- Talking of slumming, when do we eat?

123
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,640
Wash your necks, children, the lamb is about to be sacrificed.

124
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:01,120
< I washed my neck yesterday. < So did I. < Here's Kay.

125
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,640
Hello. < Any luck?

126
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,560
No, but I saw a MANAGER! Hey, Kay saw a manager!

127
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,960
Was it an interview? No, I saw him as he rushed by.

128
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,680
Such animals DO exist! What did he look like?

129
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:25,040
Like any other animal. He had on pants, tie... Did he have hoofs?

130
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,320
- Did he bleat? 
- I wasn't so close. You saw a mirage!

131
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,800
Come and get it!

132
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,240
Henry, mother'll get you some lovely lamb stew. Coming Kay?

133
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,280
- I'll be along later. 
- Aren't you having dinner? 
- I'm not hungry.

134
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,240
You've been awfully blue lately, haven't you?

135
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:56,600
After a season in Powell's office, he might say hello. It's pretty discouraging.

136
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,240
Oh, Miss Hamilton...

137
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,280
I'm afraid... I know, but could you let it go a little longer?

138
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,280
It's three weeks... But I don't eat here, and I've almost got a part.

139
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,720
I don't want to be inconsiderate...

140
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,760
Well, maybe I could give you a little...

141
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,560
Say, 10? That's something. Thanks awfully.

142
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,760
Ella, it's still a community tub, you know.

143
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,800
- Just a minute. > 
- What do you think you are, a seal?

144
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,240
If you want to drown yourself, use the ocean. Hey, Kay!

145
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,240
- Why didn't you say hello? 
- Hello, Jean, I didn't see you.

146
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,240
- You must've heard me. 
- Oh, don't pay any attention to me. 
- What's the matter?

147
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,240
Just one of those days.

148
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,600
- Let's have a good cry. 
- All right, cry on my shoulder. I'm going to bathe anyhow.

149
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,640
"No casting today. Leave your name and number, we'll get in touch...

150
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,400
"Mr Powell isn't seeing anyone until the end of the week"...Last week...

151
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,440
..and the week before. Where did I get the idea I was a good actress?

152
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,480
- Who got all those rave notices? 
- That was a year ago. 
- You DO sound gloomy.

153
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,520
Why am I hanging on? But there's nothing else I can do. No-one to go back to.

154
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,560
Except someone I'll NEVER go back to.

155
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,840
You don't have to go back. You're the best actress here. Something good'll come your way.

156
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,240
I hope so. But it had better be soon.

157
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,640
I don't mean to butt in, but if it's a matter of a few bucks...

158
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:52,240
Oh, Jean, I've got to get that part in "Enchanted April". It's my life. It's me! No-one else can do it.

159
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,520
It belongs to me! Oh, Jean, I've got to get that part... I've GOT to!

160
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,200
That was dinner fit for a king.

161
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,240
I got it caught in my teeth.

162
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,520
Lamb stew must drive sheep herders crazy.

163
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,240
If your cat goes missing, I'm eating out.

164
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,600
Bet Orcutt's husband died of wool poisoning.

165
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,640
I was so interested in your discussion of "Twelfth Night."

166
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,920
- Thank you. I'm afraid the others don't agree. 
- Barbarians!

167
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,760
They've had no training, my dear. When I played in "Twelfth Night"...

168
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,840
- Oh, did you play in "Twelfth Night"? 
- Yes...I...

169
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:44,600
- ..I have some notices, if you'd care to see them... 
- Please. 
- Oh, they're right on top!

170
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,120
Just read the bits that are marked. This is from Atlantic City.

171
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,160
That new gal's got a crush on Shakespeare. Maybe they'll marry.

172
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,240
Shakespeare's dead. No!!

173
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,360
If he wrote "Hamlet", he is.

174
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,160
- Never heard of it. - Oh, you must! - I meet so many people(!)

175
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,840
More Shakespeare coming up.

176
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,960
Is it wrong to discuss the classics?

177
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,440
I won't take my sleeping pill tonight.

178
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,760
All great actresses used to know their Shakespeare.

179
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:29,280
- How about their onions? - Listen to Miss Randall, you might learn something.

180
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:37,400
- I like "Amos and Andy". 
- In my day, we were actresses AND technicians. We learnt our trade with care.

181
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,960
That's what we should have, a trade.

182
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,720
- I'd like to use my hands. 
- - Try your feet, they're bigger.

183
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,760
Trouble is, you don't take anything seriously.

184
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,360
After a year trying to get a job, you won't either.

185
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,680
Do you have to do nothing about it?

186
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,720
My grandfather did nothing till he was 80.

187
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:06,000
If my grandfather had sat around, there would still be Indians in Wichita.

188
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,880
- Who's there now? 
- You're facing difficulties, what about the men who crossed the Rockies?

189
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,040
Did any try to see a manager?

190
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,760
No, but they could have. I bet I can too.

191
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,520
You'll get in with vanishing cream?

192
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,760
Time to be off. If we're not on stage by 8.30, the orchestra gets lonesome.

193
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,960
# Oh, we're the girls of the Edelweiss...#

194
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,000
ALL YODEL

195
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,040
Can't we ever have any peace around here?

196
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,480
Olga wants peace. Can't have peace without a war.

197
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,960
What have you done in the theatre?

198
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,440
Everything but burst out of a pie!

199
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:56,320
Well, if you did something for the theatre, it might do something for you.

200
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,200
- What theatre? 
- Is there one?

201
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,040
I haven't looked lately.

202
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,640
None of you seem to take your work very seriously.

203
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,760
- I'm going to try. I want to know if I can act. 
- Your best friends won't tell you.

204
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,360
Try to stretch your mind further than the next wisecrack.

205
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,440
I tried that once. You girls need training.

206
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,120
< In my day... In centuries past.

207
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,000
- Yes? - Just reading aloud.

208
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,280
Oh.

209
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,880
Who will we pick on now? Not me.

210
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,680
- Judith! 
- My lumber gentlemen. No cracks!

211
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,960
- Sorry we're late. 
- Nice to see you again.

212
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,000
I manage to get down here once a year. Meet Mr Millbank.

213
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,840
- I've known this girl since she was in pig-tails. 
- Let's skip that.

214
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,600
Nobody ever thought that she would be an actress. >

215
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,640
The odds are still the same.

216
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,680
- Have you got a friend? 
- Oh, a charming girl.

217
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,800
Jean, I'd like you to meet some friends.

218
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:14,240
- You said they were dressing. 
- Don't start. 
- They should've worn overalls. 
- Cut it out!

219
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,280
Jean, I'd like you to meet Mr Dukenfield and Mr Millstream.

220
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,600
- Millbank. 
- What did I say? 
- Millstream.

221
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,040
- Do you tear down trees with your hands? 
- Told you she was a kick!

222
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,600
- I love it! 
- I can tell by the size of your shoes(!)

223
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,480
- < What? 
- Ain't she a card?

224
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,480
- You come from Seattle too. 
- How did you know? 
- I can tell a college man.

225
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,640
- I got a taxi waiting. 
- Let's get going.

226
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,680
- A taxi! I bet you drink champagne out of slippers! 
- I never have...

227
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,760
- Let's go to Central Park and hang on the trees. 
- You're killing me!

228
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,800
Pleasant little foursome. I predict a murder before the night's over.

229
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,280
DOOR OPENS

230
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,520
Hello.

231
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,280
How are your folks?

232
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,560
- What happened to you? 
- Nearly everything. 
- You're limping. 
- Am I? So I am.

233
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:31,040
- Ever danced with a Seattle Romeo? 
- I don't remember. 
- You would! 
- Why do you go out with them?

234
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,680
Why do I? They not only jump on you, but bore you to death.

235
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,480
I know how many cords of wood...

236
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,520
..in a pint...a pine tree is not deciduous, but has acidosis...

237
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,760
and Oregon will soon be bald through lack of timber.

238
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:55,120
- Why am I telling you this? 
- Why not? We're sharing a room, why not our troubles?

239
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:02,400
- We started badly. Let's stay that way. 
- Don't you get tired? 
- Can't you take it? 
- I can take it!

240
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,360
Mind if I ask a humble question?

241
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,120
- Ask it in English. 
- What do you do about air in here?

242
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,640
In summer we do without. This time of year, we open a window.

243
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,280
Oh.

244
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,000
This thing is stuck.

245
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,760
Don't pull from the top.

246
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,120
BLAST OF LOUD TRAFFIC NOISES

247
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,560
- What about the sign? 
- Leave it there.

248
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:47,440
- Don't those lights keep you awake? 
- Yes, if you try to out-blink them. We usually use these.

249
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,480
- What do I do? Put it over my eyes? 
- No, swallow it with water (!)

250
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,280
- That's ingenious. Thanks. 
- Don't get sentimental.

251
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,120
- You sleep right away? 
- Why do YOU go to bed?

252
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,640
I thought we might talk.

253
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:11,280
- I've had enough talk for tonight. 
- Are you wondering why I'm here? 
- Why not find somewhere decent?

254
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,000
- Isn't this a decent place? 
- No!

255
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,600
I've always longed for an atmosphere like this.

256
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,680
You haven't seen atmosphere. Wait for the garbage trucks at five.

257
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,040
- Am I getting good? 
- No, that just seemed funny.

258
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:35,280
It isn't funny to me. If I had your clothes, I'd scram, and leave you with your 'atmosphere'.

259
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,440
You wouldn't sell out for a wardrobe.

260
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,480
It's okay for you, you got yours. Linda isn't doing so bad either.

261
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,360
- Linda? Oh, the other girl you fight with. 
- Maybe you two have the right idea.

262
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,000
What idea's that?

263
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,760
- Stop kidding. 
- Oh, you mean having a grandfather.

264
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,200
Call him what you like.

265
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,240
- If I had to do it over, I wouldn't have a grandfather. 
- Says YOU!

266
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,960
Who's in a better position to say, as my grandfather buys my clothes?

267
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:16,520
- Whadyasay? 
- I said, who's in a better... 
- Write it down, I'll read it in the morning.

268
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,440
JAZZY MUSIC ON THE PIANO

269
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,640
Up...one...two... three...four...

270
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,200
Alright, alright. That's enough for today.

271
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,120
- I thought he'd never stop. 
- We ought to get him a whip.

272
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,640
- Let's run through our routine before Olga gets away. 
- I need new legs.

273
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,480
Forget the lumberjacks, and get some sleep.

274
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,520
Olga, will you run through our routine? What about my concert practice?

275
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:10,160
Please. Oh, all right, and for this I studied with Kolijinsky(!)

276
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:16,640
- Tony Powell, how are you? 
- Alex, how's the new school? 
- Fine. You putting on a musical?

277
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,280
- Not unless I find an angel. Seen one? 
- No, not lately.

278
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,920
- Hit it, Olga! 
- JAZZ MUSIC ON PIANO

279
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:32,600
- Who's the blonde? 
- Want to meet her? 
- Never mind, I'll introduce myself.

280
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Look who's giving us the once-over.

281
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,160
- Where? 
- Over there. 
- Who is it?

282
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,200
Nobody but Anthony Powell.

283
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,640
Oh, so that's Linda's soulmate.

284
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,680
- Uh-huh. 
- Who's he staring at?

285
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,720
- I don't know, but I hope it's me. 
- You can have him.

286
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,640
- You rehearsing for a musical? 
- No, we're just getting over the DTs.

287
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,920
- Nice routine. 
- I hear yours is okay. 
- We haven't got to the best part.

288
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,280
- What's the matter with your friend? 
- Well, I think she's kinda nervous...

289
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,320
- ..meeting a great man like you. 
- Do I make you nervous? 
- A little.

290
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,360
- Do you kids expect to go on stage? 
- We're just waiting to be discovered.

291
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,840
- Well, you're discovered. 
- I didn't mean it that way.

292
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:41,640
- We're looking for nightclub work. Like the Grotto. 
- The Grotto? 
- Well, excuse me, I AM a little nervous.

293
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,080
There's nothing like a cheerful letter from home. Pa got laid off,

294
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:58,000
my brother slugged a detective... lots of love, can you spare 50?

295
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,160
Did you like the soup? It would've made nice hot water.

296
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,360
Next time, I'll use it to wash out my stockings.

297
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,640
That meatloaf came from a museum!

298
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,200
I wonder what was in it.

299
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,240
Let's complain about the food (!)

300
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,520
You could've had a date with me!

301
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,640
- Have my share of those timber wolves. 
- They mean food to me!

302
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,760
- Know any younger men? 
- Hungry ones!

303
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,040
- She needs a good bawling out. 
- Don't start that again!

304
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,480
- Start what? 
- Well, Tony Powell was at rehearsal today.

305
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,520
- So what? 
- The great Anthony Powell?

306
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,960
Uh-huh. He was nice and interested in us, but she ran out on him!

307
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,320
- He kept staring at me! 
- Lucky you!

308
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,160
- Yeah! 
- It makes you want to put a coat on!

309
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,200
Don't forget I'm part of this team. I'm not running AWAY from managers!

310
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,560
You're interfering with my art!

311
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,600
He's got a pretty good act himself!

312
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,640
- You need pumping up! 
- Well, she ain't exactly a flat, just a slow leak!

313
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,360
- Food and men! Is that all you talk about? 
- What else is there?

314
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,040
- Hi, Kay. New script? 
- Yes.

315
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,640
Don't you eat here any more?

316
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,640
Some friends are in town, so I've been seeing them.

317
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,680
- Not tree chopper-downers? 
- Just people. 
- Pardon me, there's a dust storm blowing up.

318
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,920
- Howjado. 
- We've met socially? 
- Hope not!

319
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,960
- Hey, that's a good piece of skin. 
- Just a trinket from my Aunt Susan.

320
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,160
- It's good of those animals to die for you. 
- Oh, they're very smart.

321
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,600
They die for the RIGHT people.

322
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,640
YOU know rodents! I saw your Aunt Susan today - you show better taste than HE does.

323
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,240
- Jean. 
- Think of a reply while I get this.

324
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,520
Don't forget Aunt Susan's car is outside. Hello. Miss Maitland here.

325
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:04,040
Yes...Mr Berger, the Club Grotto. Where? When?

326
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,080
I'll go right over. Kids, the depression's over.

327
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,440
- You gone screwy? 
- String bean, wake up!

328
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,480
- Why? 
- It's Gordon from dancing class.

329
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,680
- Did he propose? 
- No, we're to go to the Club Grotto. 
- Why?

330
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,640
He's got an opening in his show!

331
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,680
- What's the excitement? 
- Who knows!

332
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,200
She hasn't worked in so long, this job could be her comeback!

333
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,240
- There's lots of action here! 
- Like a circus. 
- A little.

334
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,040
- They're great girls. 
- I think so.

335
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,400
- They don't like ME. 
- Never mind.

336
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,040
- Maybe there's something wrong with me? 
- You're just different.

337
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:51,680
Well now, WHY? I eat the same food, and I'm doing my best to pick up their slang

338
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,360
though I'm not so hot. How's that? "Not so hot"!

339
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,840
- You both need time to understand each other. 
- Yes, I suppose so.

340
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,880
They make a lot of noise to keep up their courage.

341
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,920
But they're young enough to have courage.

342
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:17,680
Young enough to have fears, too. Look how excited Jean and Ann were at just the CHANCE of a job.

343
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,640
It's awful, hoping some manager will interview you.

344
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:27,560
You don't have that worry. I saw you last year, you KNOW you're good.

345
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:32,600
I'm not sure. Who is an actress and who isn't?

346
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,200
You can't just walk up and down a room and act.

347
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,760
Without that job and those lines, an actress is like any girl trying not to look as scared as she feels.

348
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,240
Here's something to try. I've had dinner.

349
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,640
This is special, I'm practising cooking.

350
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,480
I'm glad someone is!

351
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,680
I'll leave it. You may get hungry.

352
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,600
Hattie! Coming.

353
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,960
- That's final? 
- Yes, Dad, that's final.

354
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,320
I thought you might have satisfied this whim of yours and come home.

355
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,880
If I couldn't achieve anything without the family money

356
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,840
- I'd feel useless. 
- Why the stage?

357
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:34,960
- There are other things. 
- It appeals to me. Why did grandfather leave a nice home to become a pioneer?

358
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,040
He made sacrifices for a reason. For economic security.

359
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,960
Security from what? So I can play bridge, ride to hounds, or marry a polo player?

360
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,880
Is that why he endured hardships?

361
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:54,640
- What about the family name? 
- Our family is from the Mid-West. No-one in New York knows our name.

362
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,280
They don't know me yet, but they WILL.

363
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,680
I'm sorry, I can't support you any longer.

364
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,760
Financially or morally?

365
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:12,280
- If you go on with this, you'll have to do it alone. 
- I'll do it alone. 
- What if you fail?

366
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:19,920
- I'll be the first to admit it. 
- It may take years to find out. 
- Yes, but I'm going to stick to it.

367
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,000
Well, are you too proud to come back home if you are a failure?

368
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,200
No!

369
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,200
- You'd come home if you failed? 
- Would you have me?

370
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,240
Well, you're pretty stubborn,

371
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,280
but you're still my favourite daughter. We'll leave it there. Check, please.

372
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,920
JAZZ MUSIC WITH TRUMPETS

373
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,640
Hello Mr Powell, nice to see you again. Miss Shaw, Mr Powell.

374
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,400
- Won't you join us? 
- Hope I'm not intruding. 
- I should say not!

375
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,840
HOW many times have we been "introduced"?

376
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,360
Thirty-seven, including this evening.

377
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,640
- I wonder if we're fooling anyone(!) 
- You're in an ugly mood.

378
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,640
Why can't you get me an interesting STOOGE?

379
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,640
I'm retained as an ESCORT. Stooge fits the bill.

380
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,960
- Let's go, I'm bored. 
- Relax, I want to see some new numbers.

381
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,000
Oh, getting interested in NEW numbers?

382
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,840
We are SUPPOSED to be together(!)

383
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,000
I could get you a job with a ventriloquist(!)

384
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,360
Well, life is FULL of surprises(!)

385
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,520
- Cute kids, aren't they? 
- You think so?

386
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,040
- Wonder who they are. 
- Just RIFF-RAFF they pick up in town.

387
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,400
- Mr Powell, phone call for you. 
- Thank you.

388
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,440
- Why not dance? 
- If it's a WRONG number, you can get your money back.

389
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,480
Well, shall we dance? NO!

390
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,560
- Hear what she called us? 
- US?

391
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,240
- Riff-raff! I could hit her! 
- Well, you almost did!

392
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:59,280
- Powell just sat there. I should've hit him too. 
- That's all we need. 
- What do you mean?

393
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:03,960
I heard tonight he owns half interest in this club.

394
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,000
I THOUGHT it was funny we got this job all of a sudden.

395
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,040
- And THEN came the dawn(!) 
- Think he's involved?

396
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,800
Atta girl! Bet you can put two and two together.

397
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,960
- So that's it! 
- Don't be a dope! If he smiled at me tonight the way he smiled at you, I'd collapse!

398
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,000
- May I come in? 
- Please do.

399
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,960
- I thought you two were very good. 
- We thought so too. 
- May I sit down?

400
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,320
It's your club.

401
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,040
- I have a small interest in it. 
- Don't pay any attention, she's barmy!

402
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:48,520
- You don't like me? 
- I like a man who takes his MOTHER out. That WAS your mother with you?

403
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:56,600
- No, that was a friend's mother. 
- I can speak freely? 
- Yes. 
- Your 'friend' has bad taste in mothers.

404
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,560
I'm beginning to think so myself.

405
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:05,640
My ideal mother is young, blonde, slim and generally intriguing.

406
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:11,840
- I'll get you one. How do you like them? Tall, fat, round? 
- About...YOUR size.

407
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,600
That's not so easy. I'm NOT stock size.

408
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:23,160
- Couldn't we talk it over at dinner? 
- I'm fond of dinner. Could you send your car? 
- Where to?

409
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:30,400
- I'm living at the Footlights Club, but traffic is heavy. 
- I see! 
- So send it here first.

410
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,440
Perhaps that would be better.

411
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,640
- Tomorrow night, after the show? 
- Mama'll have a lamp in the window. 
- Goodnight.

412
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,720
Mr Powell isn't in. Did you have an appointment?

413
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,360
I could wait. Wait if you like but I doubt you'll see him.

414
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:59,560
Hello? You might call later. > Mr Powell is out of town.

415
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,600
How'd you like that? Out of town!

416
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:07,080
I guess that was his DOUBLE peeking through the door(!)

417
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,600
Fancy opening an office NOT to see people.

418
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,640
WHISTLING A CHEERFUL TUNE

419
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,320
You can go in.

420
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,760
- Mammie singer? 
- Maybe Powell forgot his shoes.

421
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,400
- Hello, Kay. 
- Hello. 
- Hello.

422
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,720
- Mr Powell's out of town. 
- He may be hiding.

423
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,760
- We're kidding, but you need an appointment. 
- I've got one.

424
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,880
- I'm reading that part today. 
- Knock him off his chair! 
- I've been studying all night.

425
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,920
- Do you have appointments? 
- We're waiting for Randall. If she can't see Powell, we get lunch.

426
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,920
Starting with caviar, nice, big WHALE caviar. Miss Hamilton. >

427
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,960
- Good luck, kid. 
- Thanks.

428
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,360
I'm sorry, you can't go in now.

429
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,400
Something came up. Mr Powell has had to cancel.

430
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,800
I can wait. Not today. Next week sometime.

431
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,840
If I could see him for five minutes.

432
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,760
Sorry, it'll have to be next week.

433
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,240
Please make it today, because...because...

434
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,560
Somebody catch her!

435
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,600
We'll take care of her.

436
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,240
- What's happened? 
- Powell broke an appointment, and she fainted.

437
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,040
- Let me help. 
- Give me the water.

438
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,040
What a guy! Breaks an appointment to get his shoes shined!

439
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,720
- Who does he think he is? 
- < You can't go in. 
- Watch me!

440
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,800
- Are you Anthony Powell? 
- Who are you?

441
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,600
- Never mind. 
- What... 
- Why do you refuse to see people...?

442
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,880
- That's MY business. 
- A girl fainted because of it.

443
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,080
- I didn't know. 
- You won't, if you don't see people.

444
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:20,200
A great actress could be out there, but you'd never give her a chance!

445
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:27,240
- Are YOU a great actress? 
- Never mind. Those girls need you! They need to be noticed.

446
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,960
I'm sorry, I couldn't stop her.

447
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,840
- The girl who fainted? 
- Her friends are with her. 
- All right.

448
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,320
Thank you.

449
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,320
- I want to talk to you. 
- Go ahead. 
- Okay, sonny.

450
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,360
- Sit down. 
- I'm sitting.

451
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:50,400
I take it you hold me responsible for those girls. Is that correct?

452
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:58,160
- No, but you should see those people. 
- I haven't time to see everyone who comes here. 
- Huh!

453
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,360
Sit down, you're making me nervous.

454
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,960
Every year 50,000 girls decide they want to act.

455
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,440
Most would be better at home, washing dishes.

456
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,880
- The others? 
- There are 50 girls for a job! 
- Do you find the right one?

457
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,640
You never see them to say "no". That would give them SOME contact with the theatre.

458
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:27,400
- You can't complain. I've SEEN you, you're not the type. 
- Very smug, Mr Powell.

459
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:35,040
- Whether you believe I'm to blame or not, run along and leave me with my conscience. 
- Have you one?

460
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,080
I won't see ANYBODY else, I...

461
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:43,360
- Oh...Hello, Mr Carmichael, come in. 
- Hello, Mr Powell.

462
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,400
- How are you? 
- Fine. 
- This has nothing to do with that other matter?

463
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,440
- No, nothing like that. 
- Fine, sit down. Cigar? Cigarette?

464
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,480
- You just missed some excitement. 
- So I hear. Who's the girl? 
- No idea.

465
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,520
- A stage-struck damsel. 
- An actress? 
- A bad one, I can always tell.

466
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,360
- You're sure of that? 
- I seldom miss.

467
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,840
These stage-struck girls would be better off at home.

468
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:16,160
- My client agrees. 
- Client? 
- You've got a play? 
- "Enchanted April", why?

469
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,400
The client I spoke of is interested in the theatre.

470
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,440
I can't mention names, but he'd like to dabble in show-business.

471
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,320
Fresh money is always welcome.

472
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:34,280
- Under the circumstances, I'm not sure you'd be interested. 
- What circumstances?

473
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:41,840
Here's the proposition. We can go over it. If you're still interested, we'll go on from there.

474
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:54,280
Hello. This is the Footlights Club. No, FOOT! How can it be the laundry when it's the Footlights Club?

475
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,320
Yes, I'm sure. I'm standing in it! Oh, go wash your OWN neck!

476
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,960
How's Kay? She's all right.

477
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,840
What did the doctor say? Malnutrition, that's not eating.

478
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,880
She needs good food and a rest.

479
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,360
She hasn't worked for a year. That's a rest.

480
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,520
- Come here. Shake your head. 
- Why? 
- Just shake it.

481
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,760
As I thought, I can hear it rattle.

482
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,360
- What did you say? 
- Nothing!

483
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:31,040
Hope Powell sleeps tonight(!) What's this about Randall telling him off?

484
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,760
She made a lot of noise!

485
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,400
I'm revising my opinion of her.

486
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,560
Is Mr Powell's car here yet? I ain't seen it.

487
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,320
DOORBELL Maybe that's it.

488
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:52,320
These are for Jean Maitland. I'll see she gets them.

489
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,840
Thank you, I recognise the florist. They're for Jean.

490
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,080
Oh, so they are. Let me take them to her.

491
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,160
Save me a trip upstairs.

492
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,840
- Looks like there's a new queen bee. 
- Yes, but the same king!

493
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,160
- How's Kay? 
- Fine.

494
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,960
- It's so silly to go without food. 
- Yes, "terribly silly"! 
- I didn't mean it that way.

495
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,200
- How is she? 
- She'll be all right. 
- She should have told us.

496
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,440
- Sweet of you to send the doctor. 
- Don't mention that.

497
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,480
The whole thing is so unnecessary.

498
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,760
- May I come in? 
- The exterminators don't arrive till tomorrow.

499
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,360
- They missed you last time? 
- I was out with a boyfriend of yours.

500
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:02,000
- These arrived for you. 
- You brought them up! If I could find my purse,

501
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,040
- I'd give you a tip. 
- I came to give YOU a tip.

502
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,920
I'll tell what the note says. "11 roses and the 12th is you."

503
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,560
You're doing well. Tell me more.

504
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:22,000
His routine's the same with all the girls. Ending with supper in his penthouse with all the trimmings.

505
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,360
- There's Harcourt, he's a gem. 
- That isn't him you're wearing?

506
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,360
No, that's a star sapphire.

507
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:35,640
- Harcourt's the butler. He's very discreet, tiptoes backwards. 
- I know the type.

508
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,680
You'll get to know him. He's deaf, so don't bother to scream for help.

509
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,800
I mustn't forget the lighting effect, it's very good. It goes with that tired little boy routine.

510
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,360
- You'll see! 
- How galling for you older women to lose your meal ticket to younger riff-raff!

511
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:59,000
Meantime, I have my sable coat and star sapphire to keep me company.

512
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,120
- You paid too much for it. 
- You're wrong. I'm not as generous as my Aunt Susan.

513
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:10,160
Goodbye! If you need a pallbearer, I'm at your service.

514
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,880
Ahem. I couldn't help overhearing.

515
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,800
- You're NOT running around with that man Powell! 
- Why not?

516
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,000
- Just to spite Linda? 
- I can take care of myself.

517
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,120
- You need a governess! 
- I think he's charming. 
- So are snakes.

518
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:39,360
- If I don't go out with him, Ann and I may lose our jobs. 
- That's a lame excuse.

519
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:46,360
- You got along before. 
- I'm sick of 'getting along'. 
- Stick to your ideals.

520
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,320
- You should talk! 
- NOT that grandfather thing again!

521
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,320
- It's none of your business. 
- Sorry!

522
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:58,360
- That jacket is similar to one of mine. 
- I didn't expect you so soon.

523
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:04,440
- I just wanted to see how I'd feel in one of these. 
- Do you feel different?

524
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,560
- I'll say! 
- Well, why not wear it?

525
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:12,480
- You mean it? 
- Why not go OUT in ermine? You'll come BACK in rags.

526
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,600
- You know, you're not such a bad egg. 
- As eggs go, I have my points.

527
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,560
Gee, thanks!

528
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:36,280
Not at all, not at all, anything for old Seattle. I'm not sure about dinner.

529
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:41,760
- Hattie, what's on tonight? 
- What d'you think? 
- I think I can make it.

530
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,600
I'll try to get another girl.

531
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,640
- What a well-dressed room-mate wears. 
- Pardonnez-moi?

532
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,320
Henry, that's you, if you don't behave.

533
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:58,360
- If you're not busy, I have a couple of lumber... 
- Don't mention the word 'lumber'!

534
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,320
I'm dining tonight on pheasant bordelaise...

535
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,440
- Where's Bordelaise? 
- She doesn't know what PHEASANT is.

536
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,400
There's a difference between PHEASANT and PEASANT.

537
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,360
- My friend won't serve PEASANTS. 
- He WILL take them out.

538
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,760
When he's through, he's through!

539
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,360
It's one thing to borrow him, another to HOLD him.

540
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:29,800
Tell the lady I won't buy anything. Goodbye! When I return I'll tell you how the other half lives.

541
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,560
- Let's not be late again. 
- Lead the way, Higgins.

542
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,720
- You think she was burned up? 
- Oh, have it out with knives(!)

543
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,760
- Hello, Bill. 
- Hi, Palsy. Hello, Ann.

544
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,800
We're in a hurry. What's up with her?

545
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:52,160
- She's a grouch. When did you get back? 
- This morning. The show was one of the quicker flops!

546
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,960
- I gave it up when I was seven. 
- Bright girl. Busy tonight?

547
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,800
- Yeah. 
- Well, I couldn't give you much time tonight. Tomorrow?

548
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:09,280
- Oh, I don't think I can. 
- Why not? 
- Since we've got this job, I haven't had time for anything.

549
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:15,960
- You've given up eating? 
- It's not that. I don't think we'd better see each other for a while.

550
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,000
- Why? 
- I just think it's better.

551
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,320
- Oh. 
- Why do you say 'oh' like that?

552
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:29,880
- How would YOU say it? 
- It sounds like it means something. 
- Does it?

553
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,360
- What I do is my business. 
- < Are you coming? 
- Oh, shut up!

554
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,760
- Did you eat something sour? 
- Sorry.

555
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,160
- I've got to live my own life. 
- Sure.

556
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,480
Does it matter if I walk with you?

557
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,520
No, I guess not.

558
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,520
- That's 50,000 you owe me. 
- Double or nothing. 
- Okay.

559
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,800
Ah, we're even!

560
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:15,760
- Enjoy supper? 
- Didn't dare to. 
- Why? 
- Because I'll go back to lamb stew.

561
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,800
You don't have to go back to that.

562
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:25,800
- D'you eat like this all the time? 
- Practically. Why? 
- Just wondered. Wish I'd been born lucky.

563
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,360
But you are beautiful. I'm the lucky one.

564
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:37,720
- More champagne? 
- No, thanks. I won't be able to stand as it is.

565
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,360
BOO!

566
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,400
- I knew she was lying. 
- Who? 
- He isn't deaf.

567
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,440
- He hasn't been. 
- You can't trust people. 
- No...some coffee?

568
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,480
- S'wonderful view. 
- Yes, it is. 
- Wonderful. 
- It's a beautiful city.

569
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,320
Like a fairyland. Full of colour, romance and glamour.

570
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:05,360
- Depends where you see it from. 
- You should only see it from here.

571
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,400
- Those lights keep you awake? 
- No.

572
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:14,560
I love New York from here. It looks all rouged and manicured and ready to go out.

573
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,600
- Quite a philosopher. 
- It's the champagne talking.

574
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:24,320
- Mighty good talk. 
- Mighty good champagne. 
- Let's have more of both.

575
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,960
- Who are the men? 
- Figures from the Orient. 
- Anyone I know?

576
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,480
This one takes care of girls who work hard.

577
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:40,720
- This one, that they meet the right people. 
- This one went to market... 
- And doesn't make girls eat stew.

578
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,480
- Who's that? 
- Mrs Powell.

579
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,520
We're not divorced. That's Junior. Fine-looking boy.

580
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:53,800
I don't believe in pretence. Lots of men keep quiet about their families,

581
00:49:53,800 --> 00:50:00,880
- but I believe a man can have his home and lead his own life. 
- Mmm. 
- That is, a man of character.

582
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,240
- Big of you! 
- It's the way I feel.

583
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,280
- Very big of you! 
- Relax!

584
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,880
I want to talk to you.

585
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:14,120
You must be tired, dancing all evening.

586
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:19,640
Ooh, there you are again.

587
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:26,080
I'm glad you're not deaf, cos you wouldn't be able to hear. That would be terrible.

588
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,040
- Yes, ma'am. 
- Terrible!

589
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,200
I never know where he's going!

590
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,440
- What?! 
- Isn't that more restful?

591
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,880
- Something blow? 
- It improves the view. 
- S'beautiful.

592
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:51,360
Think what it will look like with your name flashing across the sky.

593
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:56,960
- Your name in letters that big. 
- That big! 
- All right, that big!

594
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:03,680
- It'll keep people awake. 
- It will. I'll mould you into the greatest dancer ever.

595
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,720
I'll be Pygmalion, you, Galatea.

596
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,240
- Sounds like a fairy story. 
- Isn't life a fairy story?

597
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:15,800
At work, I'm gruff Anthony Powell. That's just a pose.

598
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,880
With you, I'm just a boy, dreaming.

599
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,240
- Who are you supposed to be? 
- Huh?

600
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,880
- Who are we? 
- Pygmalion and Galatea. 
- Who am I?

601
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,920
- You're Galatea. 
- I'm Galatea!

602
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:36,120
Pygmalion carved a statue from marble and it was so beautiful, he fell in love with it.

603
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:41,640
His love brought the statue to life and they lived happily ever after.

604
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,720
- Did they marry? 
- No! They didn't in those days.

605
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,760
- That's terrible! 
- What's terrible?

606
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:53,480
- They didn't marry. 
- She was a STATUE! 
- That's what's terrible.

607
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:58,200
- It's just a story! 
- Look at the trouble... 
- It doesn't matter!

608
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:03,280
You're getting hysterical. Besides, he had a wife and son. Harcourt!

609
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,240
He should've thought of that.

610
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,400
You're getting excited... The coat!

611
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:15,080
- It's nothing to you, but it was something to her. He can't DO that! 
- You bet he can't!

612
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,960
- Do something! 
- I will. You run along.

613
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,000
Get some sleep. My lawyer will sort it out.

614
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:30,760
- Sort what out? 
- Don't worry about a thing. 
- You're wonderful! 
- Harcourt's here.

615
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:37,640
- He'll see you to your car. 
- You're wonderful! 
- Yes, I'm wonderful. The whole thing is wonderful.

616
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,680
Whew!

617
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:50,840
# Our penthouse on Park Avenue...

618
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,440
# ..way in the midst of the sky...

619
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:00,240
# ..it certainly seems rather high, it certainly is rather high. #

620
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,920
You seem high yourself. You must've had a good time tonight.

621
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:13,880
It was wonderful. The view was wonderful, supper was wonderful, I won 50,000,

622
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,400
- Harcourt's wonderful. 
- Who's he?

623
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,400
- What's his name? 
- You know your own?

624
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,680
It'll be in letters that big! No, THAT big!

625
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,840
- Yours or Harcourt's? 
- You said it!

626
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,880
He's going to marry Galatea.

627
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,920
Who is Galatea?

628
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,760
She's a statue. Shouldn't have got married... But it'll be wonderful!

629
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,640
Everything will be wonderful(!)

630
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:48,680
- The view is wonderful. 
- You and Harcourt are wonderful. 
- You're wonderful. 
- Yes, yes.

631
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:53,720
- Let me help you take off your things. 
- We're going to the wedding.

632
00:53:53,720 --> 00:54:01,360
- You'll be there? 
- I'll be there. 
- Harcourt's going to marry Galatea, and we'll all live together.

633
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:05,280
- I feel terrible. 
- But isn't it wonderful(?)

634
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,320
- Tomorrow, you'll have a hangover. That WON'T be wonderful. 
- Wonderful!

635
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:15,880
How did you get into the theatre? How did any of us?

636
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,200
I'm always a spectator!

637
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,600
- What about you, Judy? 
- It started years ago.

638
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:27,520
- I went to a circus and I saw a lady in pink tights. Was that you? 
- I don't like pink!

639
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,360
- She was riding a white horse. 
- Sure it wasn't a cow?

640
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,520
Look at me! No job, no pink tights!

641
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:38,400
- Mr Powell's car calling? 
- It calls for me every night.

642
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:46,280
I wondered. I saw him today with another young lady. But you've lasted much longer than I thought.

643
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:50,320
- Is madame certain she isn't seeing things? 
- Quite certain.

644
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:56,600
But you'll get a note saying he's been detained on business. He's very courteous that way!

645
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:01,200
This is where I came in! Let's go.

646
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:13,280
This'll be a great play. Actresses have begged to play Jeanette.

647
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,880
It's one of the best parts ever written. That more restful?

648
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,920
It makes ME uncomfortable.

649
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,960
- I'll tell you about the play. 
- OK.

650
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,640
It opens on Long Island. It's a beautiful spring day.

651
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:33,280
Jeanette, your character, is upset. Her husband is leaving her.

652
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,320
We ARE here to discuss the play?

653
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,360
- Why do you ask? 
- I'm suspicious.

654
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:45,520
- Don't you want to be a star? 
- In the proper circumstances. The couch is more comfortable(!)

655
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:55,080
- Would you like your name... 
- In big letters? They must be big. Jean and I are used to that.

656
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:59,160
- What? 
- You love her? 
- No! I was interested. 
- Oh.

657
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,440
She's a pest now. Are you a lawyer?

658
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,320
- No. 
- What has Jean to do with this?

659
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:10,040
- Do you want this part? 
- How do you know I can act?

660
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,680
Because I know.

661
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:17,280
- You haven't seen me on stage. 
- Oh? 
- I haven't BEEN on stage.

662
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:23,320
- Er...I saw you in my office. 
- I wasn't performing. 
- I know an actress when I see one.

663
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:28,360
- How? 
- Ever stop asking questions? 
- I just like... 
- I'll do the talking.

664
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:33,280
- This part needs emotion. 
- But I'm not an emotional person.

665
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,320
- I'll mould you. 
- I don't want to be moulded. I act with my brain.

666
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,280
- I'll mould you one...Harcourt! 
- DOORBELL

667
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,880
Get the champagne. I'll get that.

668
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,920
Do you mind if I answer the door?

669
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:59,000
- How did YOU get here? 
- Have you got a woman in here? 
- Who wants to know?

670
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,080
- Who has a better right? 
- Go back downstairs.

671
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:06,680
- Don't shout! 
- I'M NOT. 
- Where is she?

672
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,240
By what right do you come...

673
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,840
- Oh, it's YOU. 
- Hello.

674
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,400
- What IS this? 
- Exactly(!)

675
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,640
- We were talking about a play. 
- On the floor?

676
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,360
- What is this, a frame-up? 
- Darling, control yourself.

677
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,920
Don't 'darling' me. Get up!

678
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,360
- You go home. 
- When you hear what I've got to say!

679
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,240
- We're signing a contract. 
- With champagne?

680
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:43,640
I thought I loved you! But I see my mistake now. I only went out with you to spite Linda.

681
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:49,680
- Yes, hide your face. You double-dealing, double... 
- I didn't know what I was doing.

682
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,720
And you preach ideals(!) You and your grandfather!

683
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,680
- That's enough! 
- And behind my back!

684
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:03,680
Take your cape. I'll never borrow another thing, and don't try to borrow from me!

685
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:09,200
- Don't cry AGAIN! 
- Hope you snakes are happy. And you, you reptile!

686
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,880
Never mind.

687
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:20,080
- What's funny? 
- Everything! 
- What she must think!

688
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:25,880
- She's thinking what I want her to think. 
- Why? Why?

689
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:30,480
- I like her. 
- She won't like you! 
- She'll see the light.

690
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,520
- But your reputation! Aren't you a girl scout! 
- I use my brain.

691
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,560
I wanted to show you I could act.

692
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,720
- You're a faker. 
- We both are.

693
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:46,280
- I am NOT. 
- You're a bigger faker than I am. 
- That's libel!

694
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:50,640
Not if I can prove it. This is your son?

695
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:59,440
- I... 
- If he is your son, he must be older than you. That has been used to advertise an academy for years.

696
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,840
- How do you know? 
- My brother went there. And this lady, your 'wife',

697
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,880
has done a lot of face-powder ads!

698
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:15,920
- My friend, you have just broken up a VERY convenient marriage. 
- I think we understand each other.

699
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:22,960
- What about the play? 
- Where were we? 
- Long Island. 
- The scene opens there.

00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,800
It's a beautiful day in spring.

701
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,280
- Jeanette... 
- That's me. 
- Right. Jeanette is broken-hearted.

702
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:34,640
She's losing her husband. Not the way I just lost MY wife...

703
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,480
Ssssh. She's coming!

704
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,680
Where is everyone? I don't know.

705
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:50,720
I was told someone wanted to see me. We'd better put the lights on.

706
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,560
EVERYONE SINGS # Happy birthday to you.

707
00:59:55,560 --> 01:00:00,200
# Happy birthday dear Ka-ay.

708
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:04,800
# Happy birthday to you. #

709
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,280
I've got to sweep all this up!

710
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,480
Ann, it's for you, Ann.

711
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,680
- I feel like crying. 
- Oh, no!

712
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,400
No speeches here!

713
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,400
Sit down, you're the guest of honour.

714
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,160
- You got the years right. 
- We won't tell. 
- Make a wish. >

715
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:45,760
- I'll get the lights. 
- Make a wish, but don't tell.

716
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:50,800
Everyone knows what it is. It's coming true, I can feel it.

717
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,760
She made it!

718
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,360
- I hate to cut it. 
- Maybe you can't!

719
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:09,200
- I resent that. Girls, I've wonderful news! 
- Maybe the house is on fire(!)

720
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:14,160
- I've just talked to Terry Randall. - What's great about that?

721
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:19,280
< She's going to play the lead part in Anthony Powell's new play.

722
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,320
< I've only been coaching her for a short time.

723
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,240
That's how she got it!

724
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,840
Which play? His new one. "Enchanted April"?

725
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,680
Yes. The part of Jeanette? Yes.

726
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,280
You might change your opinion of Randall now.

727
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,040
Perhaps you'll pay more attention to your training.

728
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:48,040
Poor kid. We can't even have a party without Randall ruining it.

729
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,920
Randall hasn't harmed anyone.

730
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,920
But she looks ready to start!

731
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,280
Olga's right. But she stole YOUR part.

732
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:04,000
It wasn't mine. Last year I took a part from someone. This is different.

733
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,760
It isn't different. There's enough pain without our hating each other.

734
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:14,680
- You're crying. 
- Because I'm happy. I've had my moment in the theatre. Terry deserves hers.

735
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:19,600
Saying something to her won't get me the part. There ARE other plays!

736
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:24,280
It's my birthday today. The devil with the theatre!

737
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,680
We'll take this scene again. Go ahead.

738
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:37,280
"Here she is now." "What shall we say to her?"

739
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:42,240
"She's probably broken-hearted. Let me talk to her."

740
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,680
Miss Randall, this is your cue.

741
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:51,120
- Are we rehearsing again? 
- You're to come in on CUE.

742
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:54,400
Would you ask those men to stop?

743
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,160
We find we need those men in the theatre, Miss Randall.

744
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:03,240
If you'd listen and not contradict, you'd get better results.

745
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,360
- Don't be rude. 
- Sorry! Do it again.

746
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,400
Alright, don't get excited!

747
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,480
Go ahead.

748
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:17,520
"She's probably broken-hearted. Let me talk to her."

749
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,960
- FLATLY 
- "Hello mother, hello dad.

750
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:24,600
"The calla lilies are in bloom. A flower suitable for any occasion.

751
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,480
"I carried them for my wedding, now I place them here."

752
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,840
"He needs a thrashing." > "Poor child." >

753
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:36,880
"Have you come..." There's still something wrong with that line.

754
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:41,320
- Try reading it correctly. 
- It was only a suggestion.

755
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:47,520
I've written some important plays. One won the Pulitzer prize. Have you written any plays?

756
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:53,920
- You don't have to be a hen to know a bad egg. 
- The play is fine. I'll explain again.

757
01:03:53,920 --> 01:04:01,560
- This woman's husband is leaving, she's broken-hearted. 
- You told me to be light and sophisticated.

758
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:05,880
On the SURFACE. Inside, your heart is broken.

759
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:10,720
- You smile, but you're crying in your heart. 
- How do I do both?

760
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:15,320
I refuse to watch my play being butchered. Mr Powell,

761
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:18,040
may I put in MY two-cents' worth? >

762
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:22,080
I have my Broadway reputation to consider.

763
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:27,720
- What has that got to do with what we're talking about? 
- Miss Randall.

764
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:31,240
Pay attention to the director.

765
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:35,080
Well, what am I supposed to do?

766
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:38,600
- DO AS YOU'RE TOLD. 
- Don't yell. 
- I AM.

767
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,880
I...I...If I'm so bad, why did you hire me?

768
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:48,640
Temporary insanity. Now do as you're told!

769
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:53,360
- I...I... 
- DO IT!! 
- I'm doing it. The only thing is...

770
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:59,080
- How long have you coached her? 
- A month. 
- To get THAT bad in a month!

771
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:02,120
- I have a suggestion. 
- Anything!

772
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:05,880
Could you see an older woman in the part?

773
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:12,280
- I've got to get out of this contract. Where's Carmichael? 
- He should be here. 
- He is, now.

774
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:15,320
REHEARSALS CONTINUE

775
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:18,960
- How's it going? 
- I want out!

776
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,480
- That's impossible. 
- Who is this client? Is he trying to ruin me?

777
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,640
- I don't understand. 
- Listen to this.

778
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:33,680
- Isn't she turning out well? 
- She's a rank amateur, as emotional as a fish, and she's a nuisance!

779
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:38,720
She questions everyone. This play can't be anything but a flop!

780
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,760
- Is that so? 
- Are you PLEASED?

781
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:47,800
- It is my client's money. 
- But I'll pay you to let me out of the contract. 
- I'm sorry.

782
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,760
Is your client in love with this girl?

783
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,960
- I believe he is. 
- Takes all kinds to make a world.

784
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,000
- Mr Powell! 
- Coming, coming!

785
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,040
I can't understand him. He tells me to laugh AND cry... I don't know.

786
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,080
That's plain. Now let's get going!

787
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,880
SOFT ROMANTIC MELODY ON THE PIANO

788
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:19,360
Is my dress fancy enough? For Randall's opening you should wear black.

789
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,920
We got free tickets. To make sure SOMEBODY was there.

790
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,760
"The night was growing old...

791
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:31,240
..her shoes were full of feet."

792
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:38,320
- Don't you like my dress? 
- Did your mother send it? 
- Yes, she makes all my clothes.

793
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,680
- What are these? Pecans? 
- Just doo-dads.

794
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:45,720
- Can I have 35 cents? 
- For what? 
- Terry's flowers.

795
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:50,760
- Don't make me laugh. 
- Cough up! We need as much as possible.

796
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:55,800
- I'll give a dollar for her funeral. 
- She loves to hate people.

797
01:06:55,800 --> 01:07:00,520
- Keep the change. 
- Wait a minute. 
- You just love to feud!

798
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:06,280
We'll be late. We've got to get the flowers. I'm always a spectator.

799
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:10,320
Cheer up. One day you'll be a sensation.

800
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:14,920
I'll see you later. You're not coming to the opening?

801
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,680
No, I'll catch the CLOSING.

802
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:22,120
- D'you WANT her to flop? 
- I'd like to SEE it.

803
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:26,760
- She's sore 'cos Terry took my boyfriend from her. 
- Boyfriend?!

804
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:32,800
- Tired little boyfriend. 
- One day, we'll sort this out!

805
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,680
Get me! Ain't I the one?

806
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,760
Will you sew me in? You look very fancy.

807
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,360
- I am. 
- You going alone? 
- No, I got a beau.

808
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:50,040
- Who? 
- The butcher's helper, once I told him I had FREE passes.

809
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,080
DOORBELL

810
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:57,120
- That may be him. 
- This is your night. I'll get the door.

811
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:04,360
- Hello. 
- Hello. It's raining. 
- Is that so?

812
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,400
- It's kinda wet. 
- Rain usually is.

813
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:13,400
- Say, Butch, meet some friends. 
- How did you know my name? 
- Same way you knew it was raining.

814
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,200
Butch, I want to talk to you.

815
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:22,760
Next time Hattie visits, could you slip some chicken in with her lamb? Girls, isn't he handsome?

816
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:28,000
Some people do things like that for others. I think you should, too.

817
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,280
- YOU come and get the meat. 
- I will.

818
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:34,880
I saw you the other day,

819
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,880
and you looked wonderful.

820
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:43,920
- I won't turn my back on you! 
- Butch is great, he's promised us some chicken mixed with lamb.

821
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:48,200
- I didn't promise. 
- Now, Butch! You promised!

822
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,760
I'll do something for you one day.

823
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:54,320
Butch, you got a friend? He says no!

824
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:59,320
The..er..."The calla lilies are in bloom again.

825
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,360
"A flower suitable for every occasion...

826
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:12,400
"I carried them on my wedding day, and now place them here." Cue. "Are you gathered to mourn?..."

827
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:15,680
- You need rest. 
- I can't remember!

828
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:20,480
Of course you can't. Nobody CAN an hour before curtain time.

829
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:27,520
- When you put your foot on stage it'll come back. 
- Suppose they don't? 
- They always do.

830
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,280
- Tea? 
- No, I couldn't eat anything. 
- I'll leave it here.

831
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:36,240
"The calla lilies..." I don't KNOW it! "The calla lilies"

832
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:40,760
are in bloom, bloom, bloom. "Such a strange flower...

833
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,680
"Useful..." When are they useful?

834
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,720
I'll never remember. Kay!

835
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,440
- You should be in bed. 
- No.

836
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:55,520
- It's too exciting. 
- But I was coming to see you.

837
01:09:55,520 --> 01:10:00,000
Keep her cheerful, Kay. She's got first-night nerves.

838
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,440
Kay, don't let her do any more rehearsing.

839
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:09,200
- I'll sit on her. 
- It WOULD be raining as well!

840
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:14,280
If I could get through that first speech. Would you mind watching?

841
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:20,760
- "The calla lilies are in bloom again..." 
- May I make a suggestion? 
- I wish you would.

842
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,440
The way you hold the flowers.

843
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:27,480
I thought Jeanette would hold them like a child.

844
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,520
- They never had a child... 
- I see.

845
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,840
- Is that what the author means? 
- Yes.

846
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:43,920
- And when she says "In memory of something that has died"... 
- You know this play? 
- It's not a play!

847
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,960
It happened to someone I know.

848
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,920
Darling, you mustn't do that.

849
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,840
This is my night, too.

850
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:59,560
You must give a great performance, no matter what happens.

851
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:05,560
- Is something the matter? 
- I'm just excited. Sit down, I'll get you some tea.

852
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,960
The condemned woman drank a hearty supper.

853
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:17,000
I felt the same. Like hiding away.

854
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:23,280
But after that opening speech, it's a thrill that only comes once.

855
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:27,320
- Is it a thrill or agony? 
- It's both.

856
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,720
Come, we'll have to hurry.

857
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,760
It's opening night. Be quick.

858
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:38,520
- Wish her luck, Kay. 
- Wish me luck!

859
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,360
- Goodbye! 
- Terry!

860
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:49,120
Take this. A girl gave it to me last year. It brought me luck.

861
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:53,280
I wish you were going to be there.

862
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,120
I'll be there, in spirit.

863
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:59,560
- Are you coming? > 
- Well!

864
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:03,600
PIANO PLAYING SOFTLY

865
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:09,080
GENTLE SINGING OF ROMANTIC MELODY

866
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,600
GIRLS LEAVING FOR THE SHOW

867
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,600
LISTENING TO IMAGINARY CURTAIN CALL

868
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:44,640
'Five minutes, Miss Hamilton, five minutes.'

869
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,400
'Ready, Miss Hamilton?'

870
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,560
'Standby, standby.'

871
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:06,600
'Curtains. Ready, Miss Hamilton? This is your night.'

872
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,640
HEARS TREMENDOUS APPLAUSE

873
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:18,000
SHOUTS OF 'BRAVO' APPLAUSE GETTING LOUDER

874
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:26,280
# Just give me a sailboat

875
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:30,080
# in the moonlight

876
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:34,000
# and you. # TERRIBLE SCREAM

877
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,760
What was that?

878
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:44,400
Kay! She jumped before I could stop her. Kay jumped?

879
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,440
She's lying out there.

880
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:55,640
Car 19. Go to 87 West 58th Street, ambulance call. Girl leaped out window. Possible suicide.

881
01:13:55,640 --> 01:14:01,640
DRAMATIC MUSIC CYMBALS, DRUMS AND TRUMPETS

882
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:16,480
- Good evening, Mr Powell. 
- Good evening.

883
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:20,520
- Full house? 
- They don't know what's in store.

884
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:24,160
Looks like the boyfriend.

885
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:29,800
- This is a bad place. 
- Why? 
- We'll get trampled as they run out.

886
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:33,600
She isn't responsible for Kay's death.

887
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,880
She is. It was Kay's part, but now it's too late.

888
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:42,080
- Kay is dead. 
- Please. 
- Kay is dead.

889
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,960
It's HER fault. She's made out of ice.

890
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:49,000
- You must leave. 
- I'm leaving.

891
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:55,280
I'll sit out there because Kay asked me to. For every line I'll say, 'That was Kay's line.'

892
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,400
Every move, 'That was Kay's move.'

893
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,600
Kay, who's lying alone in a morgue.

894
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,360
I dare you to go on tonight.

895
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,720
I'm not going on.

896
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:15,000
- You've got to! 
- Why wasn't I told?

897
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,040
I'd have given anything to stop this from happening.

898
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:23,040
I'm not going on, and I'll tell them why.

899
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:30,080
- Kay is dead. You had nothing to do with that. 
- I killed her. 
- There are 50 living people depending on you.

900
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:36,600
This show may mean as much to them as it meant to Kay. The ushers, the cleaners.

901
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,440
Each one demands that you go on.

902
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:45,640
- That's theatrical tradition. 
- Hang tradition! I'm thinking of Kay.

903
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:49,320
Then think of Kay. Don't let HER down.

904
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:55,360
You've GOT to give the performance she wanted. You may bring her peace. KNOCK ON DOOR

905
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,920
< Miss Randall, three minutes to curtain.

906
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,080
All right. We're coming. We're ready.

907
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:06,120
OVERTURE: SLOW, DRAMATIC VIOLIN MUSIC

908
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:11,080
Pick an exit. It won't be long now.

909
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:40,240
"Here she is now." > "What shall we say to her?" > "I don't know." >

910
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:44,040
"She's probably broken-hearted. I'll talk to her."

911
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:56,000
- FAINTLY: 
- "Hello mother, hello dad.

912
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,840
"The calla lilies are in bloom again.

913
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,280
"Such a strange flower.

914
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:19,000
"Suitable to any occasion.

915
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:25,920
"I carried them for my wedding, and place them here in memory of something that has died."

916
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:30,520
"He needs a good thrashing." > "You poor child." >

917
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:33,880
"Are you gathered here to mourn,

918
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:37,320
"or here to bring me comfort?"

919
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:46,160
"I've learnt something about love that I never knew before." That I never knew before.

920
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:49,680
You speak of love when it's too late.

921
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:54,280
Help should come to people when they need it.

922
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:59,680
- Why are we always so helpful to each other when it's no use? 
- "My, darling."

923
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:04,600
- Those are NOT the lines. 
- No, but it's the mood.

924
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:11,760
This is my home. This is where I belong. Love was in this house once...

925
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,640
..for me, it will always be here.

926
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,760
- "You're not going to see him?" 
- "Yes, of course.

927
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:22,200
"He's coming today to say goodbye."

928
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,200
- FAINTLY: 
- To say goodbye.

929
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:30,840
One should always listen closely when people say goodbye...

930
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:35,560
..because sometimes, they are really saying farewell.

931
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:45,920
Listen, I'm at the theatre. Get some photographers over here. This Randall girl's going over big.

932
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:50,960
Hear the applause...? Wait till I tell you who she is. This is HOT.

933
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,560
"Love comes back to its ancient dwelling."

934
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:58,120
"The old, old love that we knew of yore."

935
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:01,560
LOUD APPLAUSE

936
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:07,280
Terry Randall...Footlights Club!

937
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,720
- Come on! 
- Hold it.

938
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:29,600
- They're calling for you. 
- Who is? 
- You're a success.

939
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,640
Say something.

940
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,680
VERY LOUD APPLAUSE

941
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:42,200
I SHOULD thank you on behalf of the company.

942
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:48,840
I am grateful for your applause. But I must tell you that I don't deserve it.

943
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:53,760
I'm not responsible for what happened tonight.

944
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:58,360
The person you should be applauding died a few hours ago.

945
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:04,600
A young and brilliant actress who could no longer find a spot in the theatre.

946
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:09,640
It was for HER more than anyone that I was able to go on.

947
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:13,000
And I hope that wherever she is...

948
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,600
..she knows and understands...

949
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:20,360
..and forgives.

950
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:23,840
APPLAUSE

951
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:30,440
CHEERFUL VIOLIN MUSIC

952
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,000
- Hello. 
- Like the show? 
- A bit heavy!

953
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,040
- WHAT was that speech all about? 
- I don't know. But she's a sensation!

954
01:20:53,040 --> 01:21:00,040
I just found out that that guy with Carmichael is her FATHER. He's Henry Simms, the wheat king.

955
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:05,440
- Wheat king. What a publicity stunt! 
- I'll spread it around. There he is.

956
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:09,480
Carmichael, why so blue? We've got a hit!

957
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:17,000
- Exactly(!) 
- I never doubted it. Introduce me... 
- This is... 
- Mr Simms, you didn't fool me.

958
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:22,520
- This hasn't worked out as I hoped. 
- Cheer up! Think of your investment.

959
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:25,640
Money! I could lose my daughter!

960
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:28,160
Well, that's the price of success.

961
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:32,600
Quick, send a basket of flowers to Randall's dressing room.

962
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:37,960
- With wheat in it? 
- Never mind that! Ellsworth, just the man I wanted.

963
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:45,160
- I put one over, didn't I? 
- The wheat king's daughter? 
- Yes. 
- That's not important. 
- I know.

964
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:52,520
- She has a strange quality. Like that girl you brought out last year. 
- Oh, Hamilton? 
- Yes, Kay Hamilton.

965
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:58,880
- Where's she now? 
- Oh, she's around. Don't forget Randall is ANOTHER Anthony Powell 'discovery'.

966
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,960
My dear, you'll never know how good you were. You were simply wonderful.

967
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:07,680
That wasn't ME. It was someone else.

968
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:12,360
WE have to suffer to make the audience feel with us.

969
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:17,280
Does someone have to DIE? Is that what the theatre demands?

970
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:23,320
It takes heart-break as well as grease paint to make an actress.

971
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:26,000
DOOR OPENS

972
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:41,400
Don't try to say anything. We'll go to her.

973
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,200
- Where are you going? 
- To see Kay.

974
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:51,480
But you can't. There are people to see. You're an actress now.

975
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:53,440
KNOCK ON DOOR

976
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,400
- You see them for me. 
- But...

977
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,120
- < 
- Hello?

978
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:01,560
Coming, coming.

979
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,520
Well, where's Miss Randall?

980
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:10,120
- She's gone. 
- Gone? I've got an office full of people and photographers.

981
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:16,640
- Why didn't you keep her here? 
- She had an important engagement. 
- What about her CAREER?

982
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:23,320
- It isn't my fault. 
- I build a star overnight and she runs out on me! Can you believe it?

983
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:28,080
- What about these? 
- Oh, get them out of here.

984
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,600
Wait a minute.

985
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:37,920
Imagine! Take a woman out of a wheat-field and make her a star. Opening night! That's gratitude!

986
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:42,960
I spend time and effort... ..and they run out on you!

987
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:50,400
MELANCHOLY VIOLIN MUSIC

988
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:55,440
DRAMATIC CHANGE TO BRIGHT CHEERFUL MUSIC

989
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:16,000
# La-la-la-de-de-de-de te-te-te-la-la-la-la-de-de #

990
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,040
It may be a mistake. I'll never trust males again.

991
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:23,280
- What's wrong? 
- Henry's in hospital.

992
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:28,080
- An accident? 
- He's just had kittens. 
- Well, change HIS name to HENRIETTA.

993
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,600
I'm completely discouraged.

994
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,560
It's a miracle! Mary Lou's got a part!

995
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:39,200
- Where? 
- Bergen's new show. I'm so thrilled I could scream!

996
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:45,440
Read your part. Well, I'm supposed to be from the South, and I say:

997
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:50,040
- "Let's go up to Westchester." 
- Go on. 
- That's it. 
- That's it?

998
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:54,440
Well, you should say: "Let's go UP to Westchester."

999
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:58,840
That's all wrong - "Let's go up to WESTCHESTER."

1000
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,880
GIRLS IN UNISON

1001
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:07,920
- "Let's go up to Westchester." 
- "Let's go up to Westchester." 
- "Let's go up to Westchester."

1002
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:15,320
Hey, here comes that blushing bride! GIRLS APPLAUD

1003
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:18,360
# Here comes the bride. #

1004
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:21,840
Goodbye everyone. I've got to go.

1005
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:28,720
Thanks for everything. If any of you hams are in Seattle, the house of Millbank welcomes you.

1006
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:32,600
- I thought you lived in trees. 
- Only in the summer(!)

1007
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:36,480
She'll be right there!

1008
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:41,560
Well, goodbye everybody. Now I'm going, I feel like crying.

1009
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:44,440
Hey, it's your first job in a YEAR!

1010
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:51,640
- Cheer up. We're all coming to your anniversary. Heave! 
- # Here goes the bride... #

1011
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:55,000
- On with you! 
- Back to Seattle.

1012
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:03,320
Why she hated to go is a mystery!

1013
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:08,320
I know how she feels. This place is my HOME.

1014
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:16,040
At least she'll have kids to keep HER company. What will WE have? Only old photographs and memories.

1015
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:19,080
We're probably a different race.

1016
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:24,480
Maybe. Tonight I feel like sitting with someone in the moonlight.

1017
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:29,600
Good evening. Who do I see about accommodation?

1018
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:34,000
Mrs Orcutt! She'll take care of you. Come in.

1019
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,800
- Hello? Hello, Bill. 
- Don't be sentimental, you're a ham at heart!

1020
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,000
No, that was a friend of mine.

1021
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:49,880
- How's your new job? 
- Can I give a message to your 'late' Aunt Susan? 
- Hold on. No, no message.

1022
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,600
- I don't use BAD language (!) 
- Just asking.

1023
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,320
Fancy taking an old hag out?...

1024
01:26:56,320 --> 01:27:02,360
It's a feature of the Club. It's the chair Bernhardt sat in. I was in the company.

1025
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:05,920
You'll like it here. We're one happy family!

1026
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:17,600
