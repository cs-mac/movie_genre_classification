00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,775
I won't die.

3
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,754
What I want the most
these days is to die.

4
00:00:57,754 --> 00:01:01,000
What I want the most
these days is to die.

5
00:01:01,013 --> 00:01:04,635
What I want never comes true.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,834
So... I won't die.

7
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,894
Why don't you say "thank you?"

8
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,700
Thank you.

9
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,974
Buy me a drink, then.

10
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,995
You're so gullible.

11
00:01:29,995 --> 00:01:32,293
Forget it.

12
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,400
I'm thinking of getting
surgery on my nose.

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,395
I hear you're supposed
to inform the assailant.

14
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,800
It's going to cost about
two to three million won.

15
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,653
I was going to call it even if you were
willing to buy me a drink.

16
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:54,495
- Excuse me.
- It's too late.

17
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:07,115
Can I go wherever I want?

18
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:19,229
- Are you close to Hee Ran?
- What?

19
00:02:19,235 --> 00:02:22,555
Are you close to Hee Ran?
Producer Kim Hee Ran!

20
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,753
No, not really.

21
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,199
- Good.
- What?

22
00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:29,735
I said it's good that
you're not close to her!

23
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,275
I don't like it when
relationships are complicated.

24
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,615
Someone's friend works at
the same company. Ugh.

25
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:40,900
It's just you and me.

26
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,009
It's nice and clean and there's no one
involved if we bicker or fight.

27
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,099
What did Hee Ran say about me?

28
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:52,009
What did she say when we bumped into
each other at the coffee shop earlier?

29
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:55,770
She said I'm the friend
she talked about.

30
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,669
What did she say about me?

31
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:02,800
I don't remember.

32
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,509
Whoa.

33
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:08,729
Your eyes just told me everything.

34
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:13,669
"Ah, this is the woman she talked about."

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,568
- What did she say about me?
- She said you were pretty!

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,063
Excuse me! Please turn the volume down!

37
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,199
You're too nice and it doesn't suit you.

38
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:03,699
Useless men like that never say
I'm pretty wherever I go.

39
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:06,000
They all think I'm smart and sexy.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,990
It's been like that
ever since I was at school.

41
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,524
You act like number one,
but you're really number three.

42
00:04:10,524 --> 00:04:14,038
Number two and three kids
tend to be jealous.

43
00:04:14,038 --> 00:04:16,074
If you're number...

44
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,574
Unpopular kids aren't like that.

45
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,800
It's too quiet in here.

46
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,829
Mister, turn up the volume please!

47
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,300
What's your name again?
I heard it earlier.

48
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,870
- It's Park Do Kyung.
- Park Do Kyung.

49
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,800
It's pretty.

50
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,963
I'm Oh Hae Young.

51
00:05:15,963 --> 00:05:20,163
The "Hae" is spelled like this.

52
00:05:20,163 --> 00:05:23,800
<i>The "Hae" is spelled like this.</i>

53
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,064
<i>Oh Hae Young.</i>

54
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,199
There were five Hae Youngs
when I was in school.

55
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,600
Lee Hae Young, Kim Hae Young, Park Hae
Young, Oh Hae Young, and Oh Hae Young.

56
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,553
There were two Oh Hae Youngs.

57
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,300
One other girl had the same name as me.
My name is so common.

58
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,500
Why don't you drink?

59
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,300
- Just because.
- Do you get red if you drink even a sip?

60
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,800
No, I just don't drink.

61
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,399
How can you not drink
when it's so wonderful?

62
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,399
I don't drink because I'm afraid of
making mistakes.

63
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,935
You must have made a mistake in the past.
What mistake did you make?

64
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:15,699
No matter how drunk us women get,
we don't ever say things that are taboo.

65
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,800
Even if we get plastered.

66
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,733
It might be different, though, if you
know you'll never see that person again.

67
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,935
Should we never see each other again?

68
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,293
Goodbye!

69
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,173
<i>I'm Oh Hae Young.</i>

70
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:38,194
The "Hae" is spelled this way.

71
00:07:38,697 --> 00:07:42,500
<i>The "Hae" is spelled this way.</i>

72
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,259
<i>Oh Hae Young.</i>

73
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,000
<i>[Episode 2: A relationship
due to willful negligence]</i>

74
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,600
So you didn't tell that woman
everything, right?

75
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,299
That she almost got married
and that you know Han Tae Jin?

76
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:08,200
- I didn't tell her.
- Even about Oh Hae Young?

77
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,408
I didn't tell her.

78
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,830
You really need to be careful. Just try
not to run into her from now on.

79
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,399
You're a horrible liar.

80
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,500
What? "She said you were pretty"?

81
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,600
Are you serious?

82
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,600
What woman would brag about how pretty
her friend is to a man?

83
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,144
You're so clueless about women.

84
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:31,000
Turn around and run if you ever see
that woman in the future.

85
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,183
If she finds out that
you're the one who ruined her wedding...

86
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,543
I don't even want to think about it.

87
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,399
Do you know how she's doing?

88
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,600
You know, the other Oh Hae Young
you used to date.

89
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,548
- I don't know.
- Have you heard from her or not?

90
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:49,110
I haven't heard from her.

91
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,653
There should be rumors about her by now.

92
00:08:52,653 --> 00:08:56,799
Just where on earth is she? You can't
catch a glimpse of her anywhere.

93
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,875
Ever since the incident, there's not a
single person who kept in touch with her.

94
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,033
In fact, no one has seen her.

95
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,100
That's it. She knows too.

96
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
She knows that she's dead
if you catch her

97
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,500
so she went into hiding. I knew it.

98
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,754
She's very clever.

99
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,500
So, what do you think will happen?
Do you see anything?

100
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,174
You're kind of clairvoyant.
Have you been seeing things lately?

101
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:31,799
- Oh please.
- You've seen that woman in your dreams.

102
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,700
I didn't see her in my dreams.

103
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,514
What is it, then?

104
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,100
She just... she just popped
into my head like a memory.

105
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,609
Ah... so you're just blatantly
having visions, huh?

106
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,649
I don't know.

107
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:52,600
There are a lot of things that can't be
explained when it comes to the past.

108
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,573
So if it can't be explained,
then it's not necessary to explain it.

109
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:01,700
But say you experience it
or it's been experienced.

110
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,433
That's the truth, then.

111
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,600
So?

112
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,600
You have that kind of ability,
but you can't explain it.

113
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,700
It's impossible, so don't say
anything about it.

114
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,899
If you do, then you're going
to have to abandon it.

115
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,803
Honestly, if you're a clairvoyant...

116
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,375
I would be super excited.

117
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,500
What are you, a child?

118
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,634
I'm the only one who knows that you're
psychic. Don't say a word to anyone else.

119
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:43,200
Go to bed.

120
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,000
Do you know there's a village guard
in our neighborhood?

121
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,700
I don't know. Go to bed!

122
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:58,803
There were two ladies at the bus station
wearing village guard vests.

123
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:05,683
<i>Some girl and I got off
the bus together.</i>

124
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:13,234
<i>They looked at us back and forth
and they went to that girl!</i>

125
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:19,509
We are the village guards.
We will safely escort you to your house.

126
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:25,899
Why? Why did they go to her? Why?

127
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:28,568
Apologize, punk!

128
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:35,729
I... came home safely by myself.

129
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,683
Soo Kyung, I was wrong. I apologize.

130
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:49,414
I'm always safe.
I will always forever be safe!

131
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:54,573
- Soo Kyung, I apologize.
- I said go to bed!

132
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:20,200
Get some rest.
I'm sure you had a rough day today.

133
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,953
- You're leaving now?
- You're late.

134
00:12:21,953 --> 00:12:24,200
- Say hello.
- Hello.

135
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,899
This is my brother and his friend. She
works at the convenience store below.

136
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:30,229
I'm Yoo... Anna.

137
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:32,448
- What about Da So?
- They broke up.

138
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:34,500
I hadn't seen her for two weeks
and she cheated on me.

139
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,799
How could she do that in two weeks?

140
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:38,144
She's just that kind of girl, I guess.

141
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:43,067
So this is what it looks like.
It's nice and sweet.

142
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,964
- How old are you?
- 21.

143
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,964
- Give me your ID.
- I'm serious.

144
00:12:51,964 --> 00:12:54,200
Come on, what do you take me for?

145
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,500
Give me your ID!

146
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,943
Just show it to him.

147
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,924
I hardly ever got carded
when I was in high school.

148
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,323
- She's telling the truth.
- See, I told you.

149
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:11,799
- Do you know how old he is?
- 33.

150
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,200
Exactly, so why would a young lady like
you go out with a old geezer like him?

151
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,899
You can communicate with him?

152
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:21,500
Age doesn't matter when
a woman is past the age of 16.

153
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,214
All men are up for grabs.

154
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:28,714
- Let's see each other often.
- Why would I do that?

155
00:13:28,714 --> 00:13:31,774
- I'm going to come visit often.
- Why?

156
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:35,600
Date outside and don't bring women to
the house in the middle of the night.

157
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,799
Jin Sang always comes over.
Why can't my friend visit?

158
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,828
- You two are friends?
- We're friends.

159
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,899
You crazy bastard.

160
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,700
Friends don't do weird things.

161
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,784
We don't do that kind of stuff,
you old farts.

162
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,245
- Do we do weird stuff?
- We only kiss.

163
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,144
Why are you in my room?

164
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,203
You're young.

165
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:36,894
The village guard will
take you home safely.

166
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
Hey!

167
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
<i>Wow.</i>

168
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
<i>Wow.</i>

169
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:03,914
Just use your words! Why are you
being so loud this morning?

170
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,200
Let me ask you one question.

171
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,500
Are you getting beaten up by someone?

172
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Tell me if you are.

173
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,816
This was just an accident.

174
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:30,500
Some random guy came out of nowhere at
the coffee shop and I bumped into him.

175
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,972
You broke your arm and bruised your nose.

176
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,799
My one and only daughter
is living with such excitement--

177
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,220
- It's not boring, so it's nice.
- It's not fun either.

178
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:45,400
Put a mask on before you leave.
The neighbors are going to talk again.

179
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,599
I'll be fine.

180
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,164
Where's my cell phone?

181
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,099
I'm going nuts.

182
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,375
Hello.

183
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,834
Here. You dropped this in my car.

184
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,900
I was looking for it all morning!

185
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,232
You could've just given it to Hee Ran
and I would've picked it up from her.

186
00:17:28,232 --> 00:17:30,929
You came all the way here, thank you.

187
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,799
<i>Wow.</i>

188
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,700
- Look... I'm asking just in case.
- Sure.

189
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,700
- By any chance...
- Yes?

190
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,669
Do you know where I live?

191
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,253
Where do you live?

192
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:55,054
It's nothing. I thought I saw you, so I
was wondering if you remembered or not.

193
00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:58,574
I do have a pretty common face.

194
00:17:58,574 --> 00:18:00,273
- Excuse me then.
- Yes.

195
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:06,834
Thank you! Goodbye!

196
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:09,789
Oh, what a relief!

197
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,400
- You got your cast off.
- Yes, just a little while ago.

198
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,299
They say the bone gets stronger
once you take the cast off.

199
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,434
- Should we duke it out someday?
- No.

200
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,176
Why? I hear you're pretty strong.

201
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:31,319
I got so drunk on an empty stomach

202
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,156
I wasn't seeing straight
that time. Please forgive... me.

203
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,700
Come to think of it,
I didn't do anything right.

204
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,200
I did a poor job of managing the store

205
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,204
and I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
taken care of personal matters that way.

206
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,503
Let me know if you ever
want to duke it out.

207
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,384
I'm curious too.

208
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:59,684
I wonder who will win
if we fight to the death?

209
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:06,834
Of course... it would be me.

210
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:11,574
I'd win.

211
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:15,753
There's no way I would lose to you.

212
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:18,493
I really want to fight her.

213
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:37,694
What is it?

214
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:41,773
Can I pretend I'm crazy
and ask you a question?

215
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:46,914
How do I look today?
Let's say it's been a while.

216
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:49,814
- You saw me 10 years ago.
- I didn't know you 10 years ago.

217
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,733
Then let's say it's your first time
seeing me. How do I look?

218
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,414
You're pretty.

219
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,799
- You're no fun.
- What's going on?

220
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,099
I have a class reunion today

221
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:05,000
and there will be a really pretty woman
there and I'm not sure if I should go.

222
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,500
I understand.

223
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:10,799
- You women.
- She's not just pretty.

224
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,299
She's pretty and we have the same name.

225
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:16,599
There's the beautiful Lee Young Ae
and the obnoxious Lee Young Ae.

226
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,799
Would you understand if they went
to the same school together?

227
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,519
You're not obnoxious!

228
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:25,419
Right? I'm not that bad.

229
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,757
She was a natural.

230
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:32,000
She was smart and her family was wealthy.

231
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,414
She's sexy, skinny, and sweet.

232
00:20:35,174 --> 00:20:39,200
I was a quiet and normal girl in school
and she was a star.

233
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,900
I can't imagine you being quiet.

234
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,700
I started talking
after I graduated from high school.

235
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,799
I was intimidated by her, I guess.

236
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,443
I would only get my feelings hurt
if I got involved

237
00:20:49,443 --> 00:20:51,683
so I pretended like I didn't exist.

238
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:55,583
Just thinking about it makes me cry.

239
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,103
<i>Oh Hae Young! Hae Young!</i>

240
00:20:58,103 --> 00:21:00,843
- Oh Hae Young!
- Hae Young!

241
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:06,103
I'm going to go eat spicy rice cakes.

242
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:07,700
Let's go!

243
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,700
<i>Whenever I heard someone say
"Oh Hae Young!"...</i>

244
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,099
<i>9 out of 10 times it wasn't me.</i>

245
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:19,598
Hae Young! Oh Hae Young!

246
00:21:19,598 --> 00:21:22,178
- Hey!
- Oh Hae Young!

247
00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:24,933
- Let's go!
- Hae Young! Oh Hae Young!

248
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:31,700
Hae Young, you don't have eggs.
You can eat mine.

249
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,193
Thanks.

250
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:37,233
Hae Young! Oh Hae Young!

251
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,634
Hae Young! Hae Young, are you okay?

252
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:48,134
- Hae Young!
- Are you okay?

253
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:50,387
No, she's hurt!

254
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:53,108
Hae Young! Hae Young!

255
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,799
Hello.

256
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,703
Tell Oh Hae Young
to come to the office.

257
00:21:56,703 --> 00:21:57,900
Which Hae Young?

258
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,607
Hae Young! Oh Hae Young! Oh Hae Young!

259
00:22:00,637 --> 00:22:02,938
The teacher is asking for you.

260
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:05,400
- Me?
- No, not you.

261
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,377
The pretty Oh Hae Young.

262
00:22:07,377 --> 00:22:09,657
<i>Since there's two
Oh Hae Youngs in one class</i>

263
00:22:09,657 --> 00:22:12,218
<i>she's the pretty Oh Hae Young.</i>

264
00:22:12,218 --> 00:22:15,833
-<i> I'm....</i>
- Hey, "Dirt" Oh Hae Young!

265
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,973
Are you dead? Erase the board.

266
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:22,099
<i>I was just Oh Hae Young.</i>

267
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:25,493
<i>Just Oh Hae Young.</i>

268
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,328
Oh Hae Young! Oh Hae Young! Oh Hae Young!

269
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:38,594
Oh Hae Young! Oh Hae Young! Oh Hae Young!

270
00:22:38,594 --> 00:22:42,694
Oh Hae Young! Oh Hae Young! Oh Hae Young!

271
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:49,400
<i>Everyone was shouting,
"Oh Hae Young! Oh Hae Young!"</i>

272
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,500
<i>But I knew that Oh Hae Young wasn't me.</i>

273
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,299
Pretty Oh Hae Young!
Pretty Oh Hae Young!

274
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:00,909
<i>I lost intentionally.
I felt like I had to.</i>

275
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,599
Get up and run! Hurry!

276
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,599
<i>You lose if you hate.</i>

277
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,500
<i>You lose if you're jealous.</i>

278
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,200
<i>I'm a strong woman who doesn't
get hurt over these matters.</i>

279
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,500
I<i> gritted my teeth
and told myself that every day.</i>

280
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:26,719
It must have been so hard for you.

281
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:28,299
Why didn't you just change your name?

282
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:31,200
Of course I begged my parents
to change my name.

283
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,700
I cried and pleaded every day to get my
name changed. My dad wouldn't budge.

284
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,900
So, what is that popular girl doing now?

285
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,400
I don't know. I haven't seen her
since I went college.

286
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,044
I didn't even want to know.

287
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:46,419
I made sure I didn't go near Seoul
University when I was going to college.

288
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:48,959
- I didn't want to run into her.
- She went to Seoul University?

289
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,500
So they say.

290
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,500
She's pretty, sexy, sweet,
and went to Seoul University to boot.

291
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,700
- She's horrible!
- Right?

292
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,500
Men don't like women like that
because they're too intimidating.

293
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,329
You say that because you're not
good enough for her.

294
00:24:01,329 --> 00:24:03,769
You would totally go after her
if you were competent.

295
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:07,409
Then are you saying I'm not competent...

296
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:11,299
Wow, it makes me sad to hear you say that
about me. I always spoke highly of you.

297
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:13,099
Sorry.

298
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:16,500
Go to the reunion today. Surprisingly,
there's a lot of people who change.

299
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,599
One guy was so tall and cool in grade
school. I was so shocked at the reunion.

300
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,000
He's exactly the same height.
He didn't get taller!

301
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,500
Oh no!

302
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,400
So go. That girl could've totally
changed in a bad way.

303
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,044
Right? She probably gained
a lot of weight too.

304
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:36,344
Isa-dora is coming!

305
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:10,615
Cut!

306
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,969
It's not remotely scary.

307
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,444
The scene isn't scary.

308
00:25:14,444 --> 00:25:17,423
The scene isn't scary,
so the sound should be!

309
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,794
Recalculate the tempo and do it again.

310
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,689
Be careful! Do you know
how much that costs?

311
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:28,544
Sorry, sir.

312
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:41,200
<i>[Unknown caller]</i>

313
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,424
I'm almost there.
What's the name of the place again?

314
00:25:55,099 --> 00:25:56,299
I see it.

315
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,628
Hey, hey, hey! Hae Young is here.
She's out front.

316
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:02,589
- She's here.
- Over there.

317
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:04,084
There she is.

318
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:10,284
Oh Hae Young! Oh Hae Young!
Oh Hae Young! Oh Hae Young...

319
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,237
Oh Hae Young...

320
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,400
Ah, it's Oh Hae Young.

321
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,434
Sit down, sit down.

322
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:24,214
- Hey, it's good to see you!
- It's so good to see you!

323
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:28,335
- Do you recognize me?
- Hey, it's been a long time!

324
00:26:28,335 --> 00:26:30,674
- You've gotten so pretty.
- Thanks.

325
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:33,473
Ah, right, you were Oh Hae Young too.

326
00:26:33,473 --> 00:26:37,075
Yes, I was Oh Hae Young
and I'm still Oh Hae Young.

327
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:41,815
Can you make it any more obvious?

328
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:47,500
Oh Hae Young! You're that Oh Hae Young!

329
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,974
I thought it was our pretty Oh Hae Young
there for a second.

330
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,075
Sorry for not recognizing you.
You've gotten prettier, though.

331
00:26:57,075 --> 00:27:00,355
- Hey, move over.
- Oh please, you don't even remember me.

332
00:27:00,355 --> 00:27:03,000
Of course I remember you.
You're just Oh Hae Young.

333
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,635
- Just Oh Hae Young, let's drink.
- Goodness.

334
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:08,700
What about pretty Oh Hae Young?
She didn't come?

335
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,700
She didn't come.

336
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,599
No one has kept in touch with her at all?

337
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,400
We talked two years ago,
but she's been quiet ever since then.

338
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,799
I heard she quit her job
and left the country for good.

339
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,099
She even broke up with her boyfriend.

340
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,000
That's right, I heard it was pretty
serious. They broke up?

341
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,700
They broke up.

342
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,619
She should've come to me then.
Why leave the country?

343
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:33,799
You can pretty much keep in touch
with everyone through SNS

344
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:37,640
but I looked for her everywhere
and I can't find her.

345
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,200
She's just gone.

346
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,461
- Do you think Oh Hae Young is dea...
- Hey.

347
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,299
We would've been notified
if she was dead.

348
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:46,799
Right?

349
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,569
I heard Oh Hae Young was getting married
and I thought it was the pretty one.

350
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:56,099
I'm so glad it's just
the regular Oh Hae Young.

351
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,049
So, did you have a wonderful honeymoon?

352
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:11,500
You are so slow to find out.

353
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,365
- Wasn't he like this at school too?
- Always the last to find out.

354
00:28:14,365 --> 00:28:17,265
- Why? Did you get a divorce already?
- I didn't get married.

355
00:28:17,265 --> 00:28:19,385
- I called it off.
- Why?

356
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:27,394
Okay, this is going to be the final
time explaining why I called it off

357
00:28:27,394 --> 00:28:30,654
and I will never talk about it again.
Because I'm sick and tired of it!

358
00:28:30,654 --> 00:28:32,000
Listen carefully.

359
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:37,493
I love men so much.

360
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:42,335
Spending my life with one man...

361
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,433
is going to be difficult.

362
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,375
Oh Hae Young!

363
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,000
Oh Hae Young! Oh Hae Young!

364
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:01,299
At first, they wanted a simple wedding.

365
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:06,099
Looking at the wedding list they sent,
there's even comforters for the in-laws.

366
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:09,388
No one does that these days.

367
00:29:09,388 --> 00:29:12,169
I'm on the fence about it.

368
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,099
I'm getting upset as time goes by.

369
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:19,500
We're not too happy about this whole
process since Hae Young called it off.

370
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,365
And it seems like they want
custom hanboks as well.

371
00:29:23,365 --> 00:29:25,884
It's just too expensive.

372
00:29:25,884 --> 00:29:30,099
Just wear ours. They were custom made,
but we never wore them.

373
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:33,759
No, it might bring us bad luck.

374
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,598
Who would want to wear hanboks from
a bride who called off her wedding?

375
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:45,210
They say you're not supposed to reuse
the family gifts from a previous wedding.

376
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:48,799
My husband doesn't even
like me coming here.

377
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,299
He's afraid I might bring
bad energy into our home.

378
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:54,493
He didn't say anything because I told
him we were making mandu.

379
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,595
Deok Hee, what are you doing?

380
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,154
Are you hot?

381
00:30:05,894 --> 00:30:07,953
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

382
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:14,914
What? Bad luck?
Your mouth brings bad luck!

383
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:18,055
Who do you think you are
to say we're bad luck?

384
00:30:18,055 --> 00:30:20,588
- Kyung Soo!
- You're going to get it!

385
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,470
Hae Young. Oh Hae Young.

386
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:34,549
It must have been hard.
They all liked the pretty Oh Hae Young.

387
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:36,599
- I liked you.
- Yeah right.

388
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,200
I'm serious.

389
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,000
I always root for the weak team
whenever I watch a sports match.

390
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,900
Why? Because it breaks my heart.

391
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,000
Move your arm.

392
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I really mean it. I used to like you.

393
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:54,259
Oh, you are so cool!

394
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,099
You said you couldn't come!

395
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:08,493
My grandfather passed away and I didn't
even pay my respects. Where's Hae Young?

396
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:11,075
- Over there.
- Where? Where?

397
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:15,733
Oh Hae Young! Hae Young!

398
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:25,294
- What is going on?
- Sorry, it's just me.

399
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:29,595
You little...

400
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:33,430
What? It is Oh Hae Young!

401
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:37,174
I'm going to kill you!
Come here! Come here!

402
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,973
- Hey.
- Move!

403
00:31:41,973 --> 00:31:45,917
Sorry that it's just me!
I'm really sorry!

404
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,315
It's midnight. Go home.

405
00:32:15,315 --> 00:32:17,233
I'm going to.

406
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:20,654
I'm waiting for Hoon to finish his work.

407
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:24,273
What are you doing?

408
00:32:24,273 --> 00:32:26,099
- Nothing.
- Are you fixing the scenario again?

409
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:28,400
Are you crazy? I'm tired
and don't have time for that.

410
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,900
- What were you doing, then?
- I just surfed the internet.

411
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,099
If I catch you working on
your scenario, you're dead.

412
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:35,855
I'm not, so don't worry!

413
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:40,855
Someone's calling.

414
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:43,700
It's a message.

415
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,400
- For real?
- Hurry up and answer it!

416
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,599
Isn't this voice phishing?

417
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:53,855
You idiot, who would do voice phishing
through messaging?

418
00:32:53,855 --> 00:32:56,799
Who would send a message
this late at night?

419
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,099
They must want to hear your voice.

420
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:01,693
Hurry up and answer before they hang up.

421
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,273
Why don't you pick it up?
Please answer it!

422
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,015
- Should I do it?
- No.

423
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:24,315
You're so mean. Can't you just let
that person hear your voice?

424
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,953
- You must know who it is.
- That's enough.

425
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
The only person who would call him
like that would be that rude woman.

426
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,713
What did she do?

427
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,414
She ran away on the day of their wedding.

428
00:33:41,414 --> 00:33:44,733
No way! They were going to get married?

429
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:49,153
My mom was against it,
but my brother loved her so much

430
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:52,494
so they set the date
and got everything ready.

431
00:33:52,494 --> 00:33:55,914
She didn't show up and we don't know
if she's dead or alive.

432
00:33:55,914 --> 00:33:59,568
I was looking for my brother all night
hoping he didn't get into an accident...

433
00:33:59,568 --> 00:34:01,108
What are you doing?

434
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:06,650
I was looking for my brother all night
hoping he didn't get into an accident.

435
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,190
He was looking for her
like a crazy person back then.

436
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:13,199
I thought my brother would die
if she died too.

437
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,143
I hope she dropped dead somewhere!

438
00:34:15,143 --> 00:34:17,085
That's harsh.

439
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:19,364
Who is harsh? Me? That bitch is harsh.

440
00:34:19,364 --> 00:34:21,784
How could she betray him like that?

441
00:34:21,784 --> 00:34:25,085
- Why didn't she show up?
- How would I know?

442
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:27,684
We haven't talked about her
ever since that day.

443
00:34:27,684 --> 00:34:30,505
Her name is forbidden in this household.

444
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,425
Oh Hae Young.

445
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,795
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

446
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,695
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

447
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:11,806
- Help us here.
- Hae Young.

448
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,250
- Wait outside.
- Who is this man?

449
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:46,170
Why do I get hungry
every time I drink?

450
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:50,360
This is why I puff up.

451
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:57,809
I should award
whoever invented this instant rice.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

452
00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:00,530
This is ingenious.

453
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:04,639
Good job. Good job.

454
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,059
It looks delicious.

455
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,500
Thank you.

456
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,099
I appreciate that she eats well.

457
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:21,949
Thank you. Thank you.

458
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,400
<i>[Ten missed calls from Mom]</i>

459
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:48,300
Why didn't you answer the phone?
Aren't you seeing Mom today?

460
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,199
- I'm going now.
- Don't make her call me instead.

461
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,199
Please answer her calls.

462
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,519
Stop recording all that.
You’re like a pervert.

463
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:59,530
You won't listen to it anyway.
No one says you're not a music director.

464
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,260
I came in and cursed the other day.
Did you hear that?

465
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,570
Come out. Come out.

466
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,690
You two could eat alone. Why call me?

467
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:19,510
Please address us appropriately.

468
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,670
You two could have
a romantic meal alone. Why call me?

469
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,599
Chairman Jang wants to see you.

470
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:27,659
- What for?
- How would I know that?

471
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:29,739
It's like he's trying to test me.

472
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:32,670
He acts like he is going to give
me money, yet nothing so far.

473
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,699
Don't talk about money between you two.
You sound pathetic.

474
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:37,139
What are you, a gold digger?

475
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:40,710
Hey, why would I date
a poor man at my age?

476
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:44,789
Plus, when he's already investing
here and there, can't he invest in me?

477
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,539
I'm his soon-to-be wife.

478
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:49,750
Whether you will become his wife,
we will have to wait and see.

479
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,300
We may get into an argument.
Let's drop it.

480
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:04,900
Hey, long time no see.

481
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:10,500
- Do you still work through the night?
- I still do.

482
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,099
- Who put your outfit together today?
- I did.

483
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:15,300
Do you like it?

484
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:19,199
It's better than
what your daughter puts together.

485
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:21,780
Please do it yourself from now on.

486
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,380
We will have the usual, please.

487
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,510
I'd like that too.

488
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,940
By the way, how do you know Han Tae Jin?

489
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,099
- Who is he?
- He's a young businessman.

490
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:42,329
I invested in his business.

491
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:47,599
Do Kyung asked me to take out
my investment in his business.

492
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:51,119
I couldn't say no when he asked me.

493
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,530
It was a headache for a while.

494
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:56,300
He kept coming by to ask me the reason.

495
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,590
I didn't have much to say.

496
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:04,139
So I told him
Park Do Kyung asked me to do that.

497
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:08,219
By the way, I hear he is in jail.

498
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,670
Then you got your revenge.

499
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,400
This is your treat today.

500
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,199
Thank you.

501
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,000
What did he ever do to you?

502
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,440
You had to go to an extreme like that?

503
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:38,000
<i>This friend of mine met this hotshot guy.</i>

504
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,300
He was in the economy newspapers and all.

505
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,650
His name is Han Tae Jin.

506
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:46,929
<i>Can you see that man sitting
in front of Chairman Jang?</i>

507
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:51,480
He's the one, Han Tae Jin.

508
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,900
He's marrying Oh Hae Young.

509
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,230
He's the one, right?

510
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:58,420
The guy who was in Europe with
Oh Hae Young on the day of your wedding.

511
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,900
I don't know.
Is this why you asked me out here?

512
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,070
Chairman Jang invested
tons of money in his business.

513
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,719
Do Kyung, this is a chance to crush him.

514
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:10,280
- Why would I want to crush him?
- Hey.

515
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,239
Then will you leave them alone?

516
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,630
Those two humiliated you.

517
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,400
What are you, a saint?

518
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,039
If you say something to Chairman Jang,
you can have your revenge.

519
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:21,039
Why wouldn't you want to do it?

520
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:23,179
I don't care any more.

521
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
You need to drink.

522
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,019
Your true intentions will
come out when you're drunk.

523
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:37,949
If you still say the same thing
after you're drunk

524
00:41:37,949 --> 00:41:40,420
then I will accept that. Drink.

525
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,710
I said drink, man. Bottoms up.

526
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:49,920
There you go.

527
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,460
One more glass.

528
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:55,650
There you go.

529
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:09,599
Now tell me if you have
no feelings for Oh Hae Young.

530
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,500
She left you at the altar
and now she's marrying some other guy.

531
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,300
Is that okay? Are you really okay?

532
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,329
Wouldn't you want to hurt them, huh?

533
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:20,309
Seriously, man.

534
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,820
What are you doing?

535
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:39,110
I will let fate decide.

536
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:42,500
If I hit it right in the center

537
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,869
I will crush that guy.

538
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,300
Hold on.

539
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,159
Why stand so far away?
Come closer and do it.

540
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:05,400
You're being petty.

541
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,940
- Hey, this means you're giving up.
- Shut up.

542
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,780
Yes! Yes!

543
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,780
Hey, you! Wow!

544
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,599
Let's talk later.

545
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:13,000
How did it go? Did you look into it?

546
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,130
Yes.

547
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,139
When people talked about
Chairman Jang taking out his investment

548
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:24,300
everybody else started to
pull out their money and filed lawsuits.

549
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,670
That's why he was sent to jail.

550
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,340
According to what I've heard

551
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:33,599
his business wasn't
that transparent to begin with.

552
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,809
He pulled in wealthy people
to give the titles.

553
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:39,590
So when Chairman Jang
pulled out his money

554
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:41,900
those people went against him.

555
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,389
Find a way to get him out.

556
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,389
We can't get him out.
We didn't file a lawsuit.

557
00:44:46,389 --> 00:44:49,840
So we give up? We're not going to fix it?

558
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,460
Oh my, this was all my fault.

559
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,949
I'm to blame.
I encouraged you for no reason.

560
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,780
The fraud charges against you...

561
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,420
will be dropped 90 percent.

562
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,099
Don't worry. You will be set free soon.

563
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:08,840
You shouldn't have been arrested.

564
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,099
How is Hae Young doing?

565
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:16,289
She's getting by.

566
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:18,909
Did you have to do that to Hae Young?

567
00:45:18,909 --> 00:45:22,000
Then I should've asked her to
wait for me while I'm here?

568
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,500
Then her family would have let her?

569
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:29,389
<i>Did I do something wrong?</i>

570
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:32,429
- No.
- Then why?

571
00:45:33,269 --> 00:45:38,980
I suddenly can't stand seeing you eat.

572
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,530
But...

573
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,800
can I tell others I'm the one
who canceled the wedding?

574
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:53,699
Please say it was me who didn't
want to go through with it.

575
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:55,960
<i>Please do that much.</i>

576
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,400
<i>I'm so humiliated. </i>

577
00:48:17,849 --> 00:48:21,199
I should go see a fortune-teller.

578
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:23,139
I think there is something
else going on with her.

579
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:28,489
Unless she's possessed,
she can't be in that state.

580
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:32,800
Even if she wasn't the daughter
we're most proud of

581
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,909
she wasn't the daughter
we're ashamed of either.

582
00:48:37,809 --> 00:48:41,309
I run when I see her
on the street these days.

583
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,900
She's embarrassing me.

584
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,789
<i>Park Do Kyung is
close to Chairman Jang, so...</i>

585
00:49:07,789 --> 00:49:11,389
he simply told him to be more cautious.

586
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:14,289
He had no idea things would come to this.

587
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:18,269
He said he'd help you to
get out in any way possible.

588
00:49:18,269 --> 00:49:20,559
And plus...

589
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,920
Well, I'm also
a very good lawyer and all.

590
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:31,550
I came to help you find a way
as soon as possible on behalf of Park.

591
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:35,070
Just tell him that
I will find a way on my own.

592
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:37,820
Tell him to take
good care of himself until I get out.

593
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:41,750
By the way, why did he ruin me?
What did I ever do to him?

594
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:45,059
No matter how hard I think,
I never even met the guy.

595
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,940
Can you ask him why he did this to me?

596
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,019
That won't change much at this point.

597
00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:10,440
He wants to see you when he comes out.

598
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,010
Gosh, he's pissed.

599
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,909
Tell him the truth, okay?

600
00:50:14,909 --> 00:50:17,219
There was this bad woman you dated.

601
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:20,409
You confused her with the one
he was marrying. That's what happened.

602
00:50:20,409 --> 00:50:22,869
Come on. We had
every reason to be confused.

603
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:26,320
How could we have known that there were
two Oh Hae Youngs in the same grade?

604
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,170
This is literally...

605
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,070
it was an accident
from willful negligence.

606
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:36,300
Wouldn't you be more
pissed off if you heard that?

607
00:50:36,929 --> 00:50:39,159
I don't know what to do.

608
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:48,880
Honey, let's abandon Hae Young.

609
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,710
She's a crazy woman we can't handle.

610
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,219
What is all this?

611
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:19,800
<i>Now Dad will let you go.</i>

612
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,000
<i>Mom agrees with me.</i>

613
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,280
<i>Have a good and proper life. </i>

614
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,179
What is he doing?

615
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:48,170
Where are you? When will you be done?

616
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,869
No, no reason.

617
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,849
You think I'm some kind of alcoholic?
I drink every day?

618
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,500
Okay. Get back to work.

619
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,199
Hi.

620
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:23,400
- How have you been?
- Good.

621
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,599
- How have you been?
- Good as usual.

622
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:32,150
Nice to see you. It's been so long.

623
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,360
- You're off somewhere.
- Yes, I'm meeting someone.

624
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,340
Wow, it is really nice to see you.

625
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,239
- You've been well, right?
- Yes.

626
00:54:47,699 --> 00:54:53,110
- Tae Jin is doing well, right?
- Yes, he's well.

627
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:55,199
That's great.

628
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,500
It's been a while since we spoke last.

629
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,800
- Say hi to him for me.
- I will.

630
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,079
- Then.
- Sure, bye.

631
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:41,190
<i>How can he possibly be well?</i>

632
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:45,179
<i>How can he possibly be well? How?</i>

633
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:13,050
<i>[Restricted number]</i>

634
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,079
Hello?

635
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,199
This is Oh Hae Young, isn't it?

636
00:56:37,699 --> 00:56:41,380
<i>I'm grateful that you recognized me.</i>

637
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:46,030
This is why
we shouldn't be too nice to others.

638
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:50,099
They think you're a joke until the end.

639
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:54,500
Someone who calls me and can't say
anything because of what she did

640
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,400
is only you, do you know that?

641
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,900
- <i>I miss you</i>.
- Crazy!

642
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,030
Excuse me, can you turn down the music?

643
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:50,800
I asked you to turn down the music!

644
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,510
This is noise, not music!

645
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:07,659
<i>Shall we become total strangers?</i>

646
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:51,539
Why are you crying?
Did someone hit you?

647
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:11,420
You shouldn't think you're
the most miserable person in the world.

648
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:18,000
Because I'm the most miserable person.

649
00:59:19,699 --> 00:59:25,000
Shall we talk about why we're miserable?

650
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,960
We will talk about it and...

651
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,969
we will completely forget it.

652
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,829
I was dumped the day before my wedding.

653
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,500
It's my first time to say that out loud.

654
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:02,380
He said he wasn't sure if
he'd love me for the rest of his life.

655
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,190
And...

656
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:22,500
He said he couldn't stand seeing me eat.

657
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,429
How could he say such a thing?

658
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:45,309
But do you know what I said back to him?

659
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,369
Okay, let's not get married.

660
01:00:51,369 --> 01:00:53,449
But...

661
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,280
tell people I was the one
who canceled the wedding.

662
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,329
Why am I laughing?

663
01:01:18,699 --> 01:01:24,889
I wanted to tell someone this once.

664
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:29,199
To someone I won't see again.

665
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,570
And...

666
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,860
To someone who is as miserable as I am.

667
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:45,750
Now it's your turn to talk.

668
01:01:46,699 --> 01:01:48,699
The reason why you're miserable.

669
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:51,039
I will hear you out.

670
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,110
Talk to me.

671
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,530
Don't if you don't want to.

672
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,159
Let's never see each other again.

673
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,059
I'm sorry.

674
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:22,460
About what?

675
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:50,400
Just live no matter how.

676
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,719
Even if it hurts, still live.

677
01:03:55,699 --> 01:03:57,780
If you survive, it means you've won.

678
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:30,460
It is tough luck
for you guys that I own you.

679
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,110
Let's go.

680
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,289
Together.

681
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,969
There.

682
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,510
She's just left.

683
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,530
Live. No matter how.

684
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:56,489
Live even if it hurts.

685
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,300
Let's get along.

686
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,289
It's okay.

687
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:21,150
It's okay. It's okay.

688
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,469
What is that?

689
01:06:32,469 --> 01:06:35,250
What kind of lousy place is this?

690
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,429
What's with this?

691
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:41,000
Is this wood?

692
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,099
Oh my goodness.

693
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:20,770
<i>Wow. Thank you.</i>

694
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:22,470
<i>We're strangers. </i>

695
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:24,829
<i>I was dumped the day before my wedding.</i>

696
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:40,899
Wow.

697
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,600
Wow.

698
