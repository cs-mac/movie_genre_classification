How dare you say so?

18
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,480
Han Sang-Goo didn't pull the trigger.

00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,610
Can you get

You see, right?

22
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,530
He shot first.

Rabbit.

34
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,120

35
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,960

37
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,230
Don't-don't...

38
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,700

True. What is it?

43
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,450
Picture the Rabbit-Duck illusion-his
Ludwig Wittgenstein.

44
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,690
What do you call this?

45
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,060
Initially looks like a rabbit.

46
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,490
If seen again, like a duck.

47
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,400
If your mind is like a child,
you can't see the duck.

48
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,230

78
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,060
My parents died a long time ago.

79
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,030
Your family just stay your sister.

80
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,500
Wow, dusty.

81
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,340
Wow, the house is right to live.

82
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,140
For 2 years
what are you, ran away from home?

83
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,740
I'm not a teenage boy.

84
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,580
Escape from the house.

85
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,550
The never view a house at all?

86
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,020
've never been here.

87
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,880
Rent what?

88
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
This is my home.

89
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,290
In the center of Seoul

90
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,760
got a property on his own behalf.

91
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,990
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

92
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,360
All the plugs still
attached when you leave the house.

93
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,190
That's why the electric bills are high.

94
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,430
Hey.

95
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,400
Now this I'm reminded of
the memories are sad.

96
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,370
You don't have empathy at all?

97
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,110
Insurance.

98
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,210
Bills of the property.

99
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,610
Gas bills.

100
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,010
This.

101
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,420
Kesedehanaan is called reality.

102
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,320
Now, don't remember back those memories.

103
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,930
I thought 2 this year
upayaku too persistent.

104
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,800
I think I'm out of here.

105
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,980
Escape from feelings of guilt.

106
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,100
No.

107
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,470

<i>Because it is a long, long time
I stress.</i>

122
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,170
<i>What shall we do?
Do not rely on the face.</i>

123
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,180
<i>It's duck-rabbit.</i>

124
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,810
-=Happy Birthday.

127
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,790
<i>Camera.</i>

<I>I must be calm.</i>

129
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,890
<i>Oh, looks like you moved.</i>

130
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,160
<i>From another point of view</i>

131
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,130
<i>the truth can change drastically.</i>

132
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,740
<i>I Hope you can be a repoter
that could see everything.</i>

133
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,010
Since then he always bring this book.

134
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,320
The book was...

135
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,720
and handbook of journalism.

136
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,390
But why Han Sang-Goo it?


137
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,520
Not The Han Sang-Goo.

138
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,760
<i>So he's your brother.</i>

139
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,360
<i>No! Only one time.</i>

140
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,960
<i>other...</i>

141
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,230
The man behind Han Sang-Goo.

142
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,500
But why did he take
his So In?

143
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,510
Can ask you a favor?

144
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,140
There are other things to investigate.

145
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,050
I heard you were good friends So In.

146
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,980
Many a reporter sitting next to me.

147
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,060
Before So In died,
what does he do?

148
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,860
I don't know, I don't remember.

149
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,220
What's more, a long time ago.

150
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,360
Ah, yes.

151
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,000
Looking for someone.

152
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,600
Someone?

153
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,140
<i>You.</i>

154
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,640
<i>What?</i>

155
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,110
<i>If you want to find missing children

156
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,840
<i>should to do?</i>

157
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,740
<i>22 years ago.</i>

158
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,010
<i>For there is a miracle.</i>

159
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,120
<i>This is not a joke.</i>

<i>Sure is still alive?</i>

163
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,590
<i>A lost child is already 22 years old</i>

164
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,660
<I>I will look for it.</i>

165
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,160
<i>Although live or die.</i>

166
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,430
<i>We must see the case first.</i>

167
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,630
<i>But...</i>

168
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,100
<i>why do you want to look it up?</i>

169
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,540
<i>If it is found, I'll tell you.</i>

170
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,570
<i>Maybe...</i>

171
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,680

Who is that kid?

175
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,820
A long-haired boy.

176
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,360
Certainly, it looks like he wants to
a job out of town.

177
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,360
To where?

178
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,100

<i>Han Sang-Goo back with a lot of cases.</i>

206
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,670
<i>Like a time bomb.</i>

<i>So open your mouth,
cannot be undone.</i>

208
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,870
<i>That's why he killed Han Sang-Goo.</i>

209
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,310

213
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,130
You have to see this.

214
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:39,800
Yes.

215
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,500
Where are you?

216
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,370
We got a briefing.

217
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,540
Briefing what?

218
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,440
The case of Han Sang Goo closed.

219
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,110
Why?

220
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,880
Isn't Baek Ah Hyun could not
questioning?

221
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,350
What do you mean?

222
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,880
The Princess of the day it was released.

223
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,480
No.

224
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,190
Han Sang-Goo made a scapegoat.

225
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,590
Choi Seung-Gi.

226
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,360
Are you ready?

227
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,260
Yes, ready.

228
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,690
5 more minutes.

229
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,330
Stop briefingnya.

230
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,700
It's over.

231
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,470
This case can not be directly closed.

232
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,200
Get out of the way.

233
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,470
There is someone in the back of Han Sang-Goo.

234
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What do you mean?

235
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,970
The probability the suspect can escape
but, how much?

236
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,040
Ji Gang Heon in '88
and Choi Boy Bo years '90.

237
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,510
2003, a suspect of theft.

238
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,580
2005 so a drug suspect
and pembunuhaan.

239
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,180
In the last 30 years
there are only 5 events.

240
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,450
So...

241
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,720
Are you going to say?

242
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,350
The opportunity is great.

243
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,590
Plus,

244
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,190
he could release the handcuffs.

245
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,120
Seize a gun and trying to escape.

246
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,690
Open the video.

247
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,200
Look at this.

248
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,770
It's the key to the handcuffs.

249
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,610
That's the key?

250
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,980
Han Sang-Goo escape is not a coincidence.

251
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,250
Someone helped him escape.

252
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,980
But instead brought him death.

253
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,750
Perhaps it was she who ordered
to kill my brother.

254
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,650
You mention the hallucinations?

255
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,090
Because of your sister.

256
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,890
Your obsession against Han Sang-Goo
too excessive.

257
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,230
Han Sang-Goo detained in prisons.
Disconnected with the outside world.

258
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,960
Who can give him the key?

259
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,730
Surely the police in in.

260
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:14,830
Watch your mouth, Nyuk!

261
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,500
There is one more.

262
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,840
I don't know
what's the key to real.

263
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,910
People get into the interrogation room
what name is not a violation?

264
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,740
Using the identity of the previous

265
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,580
Although you said

266
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,680
one of us wanted to kill Han Sang-Goo
and let him escape.

267
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,120
But who of us
who want to kill him?

268
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,820
He himself was carrying a gun.

269
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,660
It...

270
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,330
Baek Ah Hyun how?

271
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,830
Why princess Songha Group that released?

272
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,900
The victim of a student's right not aware.

273
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,130
See this boy.

274
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:48,800
Hey.

275
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,070
You're always in the back of Chun Jae In.

276
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,500
Didn't see the news?

277
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,600

Choi Eun Yoo already aware
2 hours ago.

280
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,280
What?

281
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,580
=He stabbed me.=

282
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,790
-=Han Sang-Goo kidnap victim Choi, 21=-
"Han Sang-Goo stabbed me."

283
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,090
Choi Eun Yoo why...

284
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,420
He lied.

285
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,060
Choi Eun Yoo not stabbed Han Sang-Goo.
But the woman was.

286
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,090
Already I assure you.

287
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,930
The results of the analysis of her blood is clear...

288
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,830
Game Detective Conan.

289
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,700
How is this possible?

290
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,140
The prosecutor's office rejected it.

291
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,040
Snap out of it.

292
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,670
Do you mean the police are behind all this?

293
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,880
As savage as the-wild tiger,
he will not eat his own son

294
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,350
You don't like this.

295
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,680
Who?

296
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,020
Police are targeting who?

297
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,620
At least 2 people who are here

298
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,290
I think I know.

299
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,670

After graduation, I want to be independent.

318

Baek Ah Hyun-ssi was kidnapped Han Sang-Goo.

325
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,420
True.

326
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,790
The reason of her abduction what?

327
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,330
I don't want to think about it.

328
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,330
I don't want to.

329
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,860
Anyway just a formality.

330
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,060
Responsible course.

331
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,730
Who stabbed student?

332
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,370
I.

333

-=Han Sang-Goo=-

334
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,680
The situation at that time?

335
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,480
I have to stay alive.

336
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,690
A kind of game
in between the 2 only 1 living.

337
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,090
If you,
what are you doing?

338
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,500
I picked up the knife.

339
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,010

He let us experience the
what has been experienced.

343
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,790
Han Sang-Goo said so.

344
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,400
No human will be hurt

345
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,570
at the same time learn
how to hurt the other person, not so?

346
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,830
Is that why you're here?

347
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,570
What?

348
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,170
Don't underestimate me.

349
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,720
I was her case worker Han Sang-Goo.

350
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,390
I want to see Geomsa.

351
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,660
Please wait a minute.

You're liberated.

353
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,910
The secret tell me.

354
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,580
Ah, who am I?

355
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,150
I met in that hospital?

356
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,790
Choi Eun Yoo you buy with what?

357
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,820
I bought the front of the woman.

358
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,060
Actually only a few thousand won.

359
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,660
Of course.

360
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,360
not that what I'm doing wrong.

361
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,760
You...

362
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,400
find out Han Sang-Goo will be dead.

363
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,870
I don't know.

364
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,300
It looks like you're curious about a lot of things.

365
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,410
Reinkarnasilah born in a rich family.

366
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,210
Seonbae.

367
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,480
Preferential treatment.

368
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,850
What because she's his daughter Songha Group?

369
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,790
Ah, he is...

370
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,060
Okay, I know who he is.

371
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,930
Baek Ah Hyun attempted murder

372
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,330
why not arrested?

373
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,430
Statement of student victim
and Baek Ah Hyun's partner.

374
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,230
And the suspect dead.

375
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,500
It looks like you have a fantasy about the law.

376
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,540
The law is indeed a respecter of persons.

377
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,540
The results of the analysis of blood
submitted as evidence.

378
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,740
Why rejected?

379
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,040
Because there is a cause.

380
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,950
Their untrained

381
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,980
what have the qualification rate
the methods of science?

382
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,620
What does that mean?

383
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,120
For you to understand?

384
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,660
I see you write a function trigonometrinya
so detailed.

385
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,160
In fact, I
just understand some of it.

386
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,590
Continue to why...

387
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,960
The murder case of Itaewon

388
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,560
blood so decisive evidence.

389
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,830
But...

390
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,330
different with this case.

391
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,840
Because 2 people at the crime SCENE
so the main suspect.

392
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,540
The technique of analysis of blood
introduced in China in 2008.

393
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:12,010
I got all that after review of the data
using such a technique.

394
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:18,090
At the hearing very little evidence
expressed.

395
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,060
So...

396
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,560
if you want the rich princess it is
jailed

397
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,430
please bring proof of the other.

398
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,200
I don't know
you're the one who holds the principle of

399
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,730
although our paths are not the same.

400
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,970
this is not my style.

401
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,140
Talented police officer who failed to,

402
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,010
ever so the legend

403
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,040
consider the death of his family
as his own fault.

404
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,380
wasted 2 years.

405
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,210
The lapse of time, narcissism changed
so torture yourself.

406
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,620
Because of that I couldn't recognize
his or her identity.

407
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,320
Get in here gave a lecture Geomsa.

408
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,860
I'm sorry, but that's not my style.

409
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,200
I have something to say
on hyeongsa.

410
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,680
I'm sorry,
've made a mistake.

411
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,880
Sorry it's free.

412
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,550
Now I understand.

413
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,590
The water in this case
deeper than I thought.

414
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:39,270
I heard you're a hero
that catches Han Sang-Goo.

415
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,500
It was a coincidence.

416
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,370
Before you die, you see?

417
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:44,870
Yes.

418
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,710
Han Sang-Goo said what?
In his last moments.

419
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,050
Because I failed to investigate
crime other, please.

420
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,390
Nothing special.

421
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,020
Name.

422
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,630
Asking me to remember a name.

423
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,230
The name of what?

424
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,330
The Name Of Apollo.

425
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,080
What is it?

426
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,510
I don't know.

427
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,680
It was he said.

428
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,320
He asked you to remember the name of it?

429
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,350
Yes.

For this, thank you.

458

467
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,660

Try to be able to meet
on a regular basis.

482
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,030
The nation's debt continues to grow

483
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,830
China's economic growth amid weakened.

484
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,200

Yes.

489
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,980
Take it.

490
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,520
What are you gonna do?

491
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,920
Anyway in here no one had a cell phone.

498
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,930
Of course.

499
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,170
Be careful.

500
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,570
I see you have
good luck this month.

501
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,240
Ah, never mind.

502
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,340
You should be careful with the water.

503
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,110
I go.

504
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,280
Try not near water.

505
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,350

506
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,930

507
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,050

509
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,150
I ask you to come,
but you don't want to hear.

510
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,760
Sometime our pilgrimage
to the tomb of your father.

511
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,530
During this time, news You good, You?

512
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,660
No.

513
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,600
You Hakjang-nim University Police.

514
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,930
You.

515
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,000
Yesterday I got to the police station.

516
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,700
Reportedly you make leadership a major upset.

517
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,370
The news quickly spread.

518
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,440
I told the suspect not the Han Sang-Goo,
but no one believes.

519
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,080
The Korean police do not do investigation.

520
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,150
They want to protect the organization
that's why.

521
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,850
So you want to protect something,
you will do anything.

522
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,160
Isn't that so?

523
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,620
You are already old.

524
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
Different from the previous

525
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,730
first You like the snaps.

526
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,630
Life's getting older.

527
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,900
But...

528
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,940
You find something
for So In?

529
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,310
New one proof.

530
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,440
It seems So In to investigate something.

531
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,450
What?

532
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,450
I don't know for sure.

533
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,220
Therefore, You must know something

534
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,420
what he's here every day
for dinner?

535
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,260
It's been so long,

536
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,860
but that time,
his face looks uneasy.

537
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,060
I ask her what's wrong.

538
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,670
What did he say?

539
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,300
Didn't say anything.

540
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,810
Don't have a clue.

541
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,780
Because it...

542
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,400
How are you here, Kim Hyeongsa?

543
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,440
Continue to Geomsa-nim, why are you here?

544
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,340
This is called not claimed.

545
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,250
No funeral expenses.

546
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,450
No mourners or family.

547
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,290
Officially not called a cemetery
only recorded as a corpse.

548
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,260
Considered the goods burned.

549
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,900
Rich or a beggar.

550
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,400
Either villain or hero

551
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,930
for the last time

552
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,970
at least, not considered goods.

553
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,410
Should be treated appropriately human.

554
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,410
So sometimes I come here.

555
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,310
If you?

556
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,480
I?

557
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,080
Actually

558
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,520
why I'm here
I don't know.

559
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:49,930
To die,
I can't forgive Han Sang-Goo.

560
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,240
<i>Popeye.</i>

561
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,910
<i>Waiting for you.</i>

562
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,750
<i>what exactly does that mean?</i>

563
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,900
-=Cremation=-

564
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,960
You're more humane
than I thought.

565
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,700
What?

566
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:59,470
You said you often come here to see
bodies not claimed were cremated.

567
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,610
Because the current is small,
I never experience hunger.

568
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,750
The snow fell.

569
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,520
So see the snow come down
I always feel hungry.

570
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,190
Because the granules of snow-like rice.

571
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,100
Really, if rice
it would be nice.

572
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,240
So...

573
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,910
When you have the time?

574
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,680

576
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,840

Ready.

578
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,580

587
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,740
I don't even know.

588
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,450
A letter of resignation is not accepted.

589
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,720
<i>Because...</i>

590
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,190

591
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,420
<i>I want to go back.</i>

<i>If it is I can't help you.</i>

594
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,300
<i>don't be lulled by the comfort,

595
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:12,870
<i>But...</i>

The Case Of Han Sang Goo
will be re-investigated by this team.

599
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,950
This team? Our team?

600
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,920
You know, it has been closed.

601
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,690
I already report it to superiors.

602
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,320
Hey, not at work?

603
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,430
Still want to hangout?

604
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,400
Better.

605
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,400
Hey, Chun Jae In.

606
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,670

Rabbit if disturbed will bite.

608
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,440
I will be working as a police officer.

609
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,040
Arrogant little brat.

610
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,460
Seonbae, I didn't expect
we will meet again.

611
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,120
It is also true.

612
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,730
If talent remarkably buried
will be a pity.

613
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,000
Yes, I am a rather noisy person.

614
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,000

Change the brand, change the people that are communicative.

688
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,390
Like this less is better.

689
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,220

I'm curious why You just shut up.

702
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,530
Actually, we can stop it

703
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,140
Tripang this...

704
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,740
so someone wants to eat it

705
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,680

706
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:20,250
When the enemy offers take
the innards

707
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,850
he could run away again.

708
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,160
Nothing to do with his shell.

709
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,830
Then...

710
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,860
what if he's investigating
the past?

711
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,600
The doctrine of article 13 of the said

712
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,640
During the mouth closed
people could survive.

713
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,310
that can not, will perish.

714
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,110
Watch your mouth.

715
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,790
Oh, you came.

716
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,790
Already had dinner?

717
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,710
Why the sudden see the photos?

718
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,310
Appa, what I've lost?

719
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,880
What are you talking about?

720
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,520
Well, last I saw
ads of missing children.

721
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,090
She's like me.

722
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,090
His name is...

723
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,360
Soo Yi.

724
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,630
Just like times.

725
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,230
The age is the same.

726
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,570
You're just all lost in the pool.

727
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,140
In addition to it's never.

728
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,310
Yes, aren't you?

729
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,910
Certainly not me.

730
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,810
Oh, yes.

731
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,740
Anyways, his hair is long.

732
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,280
But, Appa.

733
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,150
Why do I always wear the same clothes the man?

734
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,480
Appa wanted a son?

735
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,750
There is a saying
"sex change so I can live."

736
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,890
So that can grow up healthy.

737
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,890
Really superstitious.

738
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,860
You're that sickly.

739
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:14,030
Whether superstition or not
must necessarily be carried out.

740
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,170
Born sickly

741
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,500
Appa raised you.

742
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,540
Tell me my childhood.

743
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,780
If you drink milk,
you vomiting and crying.

744
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:34,050
All the photos taken that time
only the doll is filthy.

745
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:39,490
It is very unfortunate lost
when we moved in.

746
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,930
<i>Images before the age of 7 years.</i>

747
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,830
<i> > > Just this one only.</i>

748
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,030
<i>Album picture is missing
what really just happened?</i>

749
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,490
Your father said what?

750
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,520
Of course I'm not.

751
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,660
Kidnapping, kidnapped, lost

752
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,090
at all never.

753
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,430
How is she?

754
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:24,100
I check it out.

755
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,130
I think I know.

756
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,500
Doppelganger.

757
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,070
Do you mean in other parts of the world.
There is someone like you...

758
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,140
Doppelganger?

759
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:33,980
Yes.

760
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:34,840
You know Goethe?

761
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,540
A writer from Germany.

762
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,010
When still young
he met with his doppelganger.

763
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,880
I read in his autobiography.

764
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:44,490
But he said that 2 doppelganger meet
one of them will die.

765
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:45,750
Hey, why are you dead?

766
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,020
Of course, to make sure
we should check his DNA.

767
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,260
Not long ago I downloaded the application.

768
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,860
I can find my doppelganger.

769
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,230
You want to try?

770
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:56,600
How could you look smarter?

771
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,000
My Doppelganger is a superstition Germany
you know what?

772
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,540

I experience things that don't make sense.

779

But...

780
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,320

We from the Police station in Seoul.

873
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,150
We would ask him.

874
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:42,150
Are you guys the police?

875
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:43,120
Yes.

876
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:46,490
20 years ago, he lost his daughter, right?

877
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:47,190
His daughter?

878
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:47,990
Princess what?

879
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:50,120
She had no children.

880
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,860
When diving for shells,
he was brain dead.

881
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,730
Her husband died after a long lay ill.

882
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:57,700
Oh, that's why he cheated.

883
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,570
Strange.

884
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,540
The child was like this.

885
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,210
Kim Seon Ja guardian.

886
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,210
You don't know?

887
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:10,310
Don't know.

888
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,150
This is the first time I saw it.

889
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:13,880
Hey, who is this child?

890
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,380
This is the first time we saw it.

891
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,980
Beautiful.

892
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,550
Settlement Wolguk it

893
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,860
exactly where?

894
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,690
From here, go straight follow the road that

895
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:27,160
you'll find home
the roof is red.

896
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,030
Of course it's empty.

897
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,470
Come on, you two.

898
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:33,470
Because ship-to-3 this
the last ship.

899
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,140
If there is no ship,
we will be staying.

900
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,040
It's no hassle.

901
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:39,440
For young people like you
definitely not convenient.

902
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,340
Anyway this isn't a tourist destination.

903
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,450
I've been having a difficult thing
it doesn't matter.

904
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:45,750
Thank you.

905
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:51,750
Aigoo, she must fall in love with the girl.

906
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,320
See.

907
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,260
Why the sudden change?

908
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,890
I often see in the movies.

909
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,730
Swank missed the boat.

910
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,430
Break it first, new go.

911
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:03,330
Shut the fuck up.

912
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,670
I only test the reaction.

913
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,030
Reaction of what?

914
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:08,100
Don't look back.

915
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:09,470
Continue to course.

916
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,500
The fuck?

917
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,270
They...

918
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:24,100
I feel there is unnatural.

919
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,500
They are right the inhabitants of the village.

920
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,210
We'll see.

921
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,810
What you don't resonate with something in here?

922
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,180
What?

923
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,950
Feel the middle of reminisce.

924
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,650
Or the view is no stranger yes.

925
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,020
Not at all.

926
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,620
Ah, it's him.

927
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,680
It looks like a really blurry
in the last night.

928
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,220
Don't like people who give
prize of 50 million.

929
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,950
And no children.

930
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:18,860
Continue to why is he so her guardian?

931
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,330
This news 1994.

932
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:31,340
Everything is using that to close the window.

933
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,640
The yes live in exile?

934
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:38,240
What this guy ran off with his neighbor?

935
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,250
Seonbae, see this.

936
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:48,620
Now what?

937
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,250
The record investigation no.

938
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,320
The child, the guardian is also not there.

939
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:54,630
His house abandoned.

940
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:31,730
Come on.

941
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:32,930
Where?

942
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:45,510
There are drinks like this?

943
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,340
Stuff from the 90s.

944
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,810
The date of expiration of the same.

945
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:52,150
That's why I collect junk
from Wokguk.

946
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:57,390
Certainly, the boy was lost in 1994.

947
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,820
Did something happen on this island?

948
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:04,430
Maybe this trip will be even longer.

949
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,010
Your rifle there is a permit?

950
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,940
None of your business.

951
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:23,550
It is the task of my profession.

952
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:25,020
I'm a cop.

953
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,420
I have a permit.

954
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:31,260
Or You could make sure of it.

955
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,490
What do You do with that rifle
in this small island?

956
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:35,590
Because there is always a boar
down the mountain.

957
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:37,530
You two be careful.

958
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:52,310
There are people?

959
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,110
There are people?

960
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,150
Grandma.

961
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,860
Grandma.

962
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:11,700
Grandma.

963
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,160
Ah...

964
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,300
I want to ask you something.

965
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:20,470
I thought who...

966
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:27,280
You're back.

967
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:28,850
Son.

968
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,520
I?

969
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,090
But...

970
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,490
What are you doing here?

971
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,260
What?

972
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:42,360
Aigoo.

973
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:48,470
A child who has supernatural powers
don't wander off.

974
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,540
Grandma, You know me?

975
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,610
Hey, what's wrong with you?

976
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,880
Where possible I don't know you?

977
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:02,910
Both of you!

978
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,420
You are the owner of this inn?

979
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:10,550
The air is cold, come on in.

980
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:19,160
You want to stay?

981
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,260
Yes.

982
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:22,130
30,000 won.

983
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,740
He Your Mother?

984
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,240
Alzheimer's Disease.

985
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:29,540
Anyone he met
he felt know.

986
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,510
I rented 2 rooms.

987
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:35,050
In this village, how many families?

988
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:36,310
22 the head of the family.

989
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:37,980
Around 60 people.

990
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,550
Seems like a lot of the move.

991
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:42,550
I was here after the financial crisis.

992
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,760
The pond here is broken because of the hurricane.

993
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:05,480
Not bad.

994
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,530
Yes.

995
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,230
Towel.

996
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:30,100
Thank you.

997
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,050
"Get off this island!
Fast."

998
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,460
What does that mean?
-=Go from this island! Fast!=-

999
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:59,300
He insisted didn't know.

1000
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,730
It looks like a warning.

1001
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,970
I feel bad.

1002
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:08,510
I don't think I could stay on this island.

1003
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:11,810
There is no way.

1004
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,640
The last ship was gone.

1005
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:21,690
Hey, you guys.

1006
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:23,620

00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:36,600
Have a drink.

1011
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,000
I don't drink.

1012
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,740
Fill your cup, and drink it.

1013
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,400
True.

1014
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,410
Come on.

1015
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:44,310

00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:44,910

Drink, drink.

1025
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:03,360
Aigoo.

1026
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,360
Oh, delish.

1027
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,130
Let's eat.

1028
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,400
Try the scallops.

Good.

1030
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,740
Yes.

1031
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:16,970
Hey,

00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,240
Eat fish don't be reversed.

1033
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,150
If you turn it over
this island will be reversed.

1034
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:24,380
Therefore if you eat fish
don't ever be reversed.

1035
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,280
I'm sorry.

1036
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,820
It's all superstition.

1037
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:29,920
People like us fishermen

1038
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,560
dependent life
from the sea.

1039
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:33,690
Superstition?

1040
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:35,760
Not superstition, but faith.

1041
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,130
The era of our first, had a boy

One thousand forty two
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:39,130
like the birth of bait fish.

1043
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:41,260
Because work on the boat
always throw the bait.

1044
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,700
Aigoo, don't digress.

1045
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,530

00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:45,470
Yes, yes.

What is it?

1048
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,440
You don't know?

1049
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:49,640
Based on the lunar month this day

1050
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:51,140

1051
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,410

According to the dating of the East

00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,430
Don't take any objects from the wood.

1057
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,230
He said the bottom of the clothes

1058
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:11,090
So they don't get out of the house.

1059
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:12,400
The ship also did not go to sea.

1060
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,970
Even at night
they hide his shoes.

1061
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:19,500
If the ghosts come and wear your shoes.

1062
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:24,370
Then in between your family
there is someone who will die soon.

1063
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,310
Hey.

1064
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,350
Fear yes?

1065
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:31,410
Makes your skin crawl.

1066
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,480
Aigoo.

1067
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,220
Be careful when sleeping.

1068
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:36,550
Chong-gak(<font color="#ffff80">young</font>).

1069
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,260
Oh, yes. Well so, have a drink.

00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:51,100
Come drink, eat again.

1073
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:31,370
Ghost, ghost.

1074
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:33,180
There is a ghost, a ghost.

1075
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,310
What is it?

1076
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:34,810
Ghost.

1077
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:36,410
A-I see ghosts.

1078
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:39,580
Ghost-ghost it even take
my shoes.

1079
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:40,620
Ghost?

1080
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,420
Where?

1081
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:48,060
What are you looking for?

1082
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:49,760
Tomorrow morning, we go.

1083
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:51,830
Ah, basic.

1084
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,630
Shoes.

1085
01:00:58,070 --> 01:00:59,840
In-in there.

1086
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,770

1087
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:02,340

You go first.

1089
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,900
Can't.

1090
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:33,600
Where are you going?

1091
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:35,470
Let's go back.

1092
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:36,910
Come with me.

1093
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:54,460
What is this?

1094
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:03,330
Grandma.

1095
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:20,820
Out cold, Grandma.

1096
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,450
Made the blanket and go to sleep.

01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:25,620
If so, we excuse me.

1098
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:31,260
They are... condemned.

1099
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:32,930
What?

1100
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:39,770
Who are they?

1101
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:42,340

Said so repeatedly

1108
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:57,720
