1
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,666
Excuse me!

2
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,877
Hello.

3
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,260
Hi.

4
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,261
Sorry to bother you.

5
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,305
I just, um...

6
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,806
Do you live around here?

7
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,433
Yeah.

8
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,478
Um, I'm supposed to meet
my friend at this diner

9
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,563
on, um, 4th and 7th?

10
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,148
Right.

11
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,401
Do you know where that is?
Am I going the right way?

12
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,112
Um...what diner?

13
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:24,991
Um...hang on.

14
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,494
I wrote it down somewhere.

15
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,121
Uh, Daisy's?

16
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,748
Oh, yeah.

17
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,041
You know where it is?

18
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:33,625
Yeah.

19
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,002
OK, so what should I do?

20
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,046
Uh...OK.

21
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:43,134
Um, basically, um, OK,
go out this exit,

22
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,428
go to your right,

23
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,308
and then take the left staircase
out to the floor level.

24
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,896
Um, and then, OK,
you're going to get out

25
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:59,109
and go left on the street right there.

26
00:05:59,192 --> 00:05:59,776
So l--

27
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,652
This street right here.

28
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,029
So I take a left when I go
out to the street?

29
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,032
Yeah, go left,
go left out of the station,

30
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,826
left on the street,

31
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,078
and then go, like,
two blocks up,

32
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,872
and then, um...
what do you see over there?

33
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,959
I'm trying to think.

34
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,127
Um...

35
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,481
Thanks for walking with me.

36
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,275
It's really nice of you.

37
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:40,984
Yeah, no problem.

38
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,029
Kind of a bad situation right now.

39
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,697
My friend--
I should have known.

40
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,574
It's typical of my friend, Samantha.

41
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,534
She, um...

42
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,870
last I heard from her
was on this message

43
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,497
where she said she had lost
her phone charger.

44
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,625
And the only way
I knew where to go

45
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,336
was that she
left me that message

46
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,340
saying to meet at the diner,
so otherwise I would be...

47
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,592
I don't know what I would do.

48
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,593
Really?

49
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,053
Yeah.

50
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,305
That sucks.

51
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,098
Yeah.

52
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,558
It does.

53
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,195
But anyway,
she's really irresponsible,

54
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,697
and, like, she's that kind of person

55
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,033
where if you want to hang out

56
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,410
at, like, 8:00 at night
or something,

57
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:36,331
you should probably tell her
to get ready around 7:00

58
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,125
because just give her
an hour extra

59
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,960
because she's going to be
late anyway.

60
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,922
Then she'd still be late
even if you did that, you know?

61
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,384
Yeah.

62
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,594
Yeah, my friend Rick
is actually like that.

63
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,429
Really?

64
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,515
Yeah, like the other day

65
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,558
we went to eat
at this Mexican place,

66
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,812
and, like, the bill came
and it was like...

67
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,440
like I had cash and, like,
he only had his card,

68
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,068
so he was like, "Oh, I'll just
pay for it on my card

69
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,861
and you can give me cash
or whatever."

70
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,489
And I was like, "OK, cool",
like, not that big of a deal,

71
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,533
and then, you know,
like, two hours later

72
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,326
we were at home
and we realized

73
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,412
that, like, he forgot his card
at the restaurant.

74
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,205
But then it was even worse

75
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,249
because then for, like,
the next three days,

76
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,126
anytime we went and, like,
ate somewhere together

77
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,169
or, like, did anything
that cost money,

78
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,714
he was like,
"Oh, I don't have my card",

79
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,508
and then, like, I was the only
one who, like, had cash on me

80
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,552
so I'd end up paying
for everything, you know.

81
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,679
Oh, that's not cool.
That's not good.

82
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,889
Just, like, flaking

83
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,933
and, you know,
being really, like, forgetful.

84
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:40,812
Yeah, although I have to admit,
I just did that about a week ago.

85
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,565
What? Like forgot
your card somewhere?

86
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,941
Yeah.

87
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,818
Although it's usually
my keys that I forget

88
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,195
because when I come home,
I just, like, throw my stuff down,

89
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,614
I just throw my keys,
but not ever in the same place.

90
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,993
Like it's always just, like,
somewhere where I can't find them.

91
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,828
And, like, I probably waste
ten minutes a day

92
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,954
looking for my keys.

93
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,796
- Hey.
- Hey.

94
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,881
What's up?

95
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,467
Uh, she's not in there,

96
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:17,474
so, um, I guess I'm just going
to wait inside for her,

97
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,393
see if she calls me
or shows up, you know.

98
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,062
OK.

99
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,563
Cool.

100
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,648
Well, I don't know.

101
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,359
Nice meeting you, I guess.

102
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,277
Yeah, nice meeting you, too.

103
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,119
No luck.

104
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,746
No.

105
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,629
So do you come here a lot?

106
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,840
Um, well, I used to,

107
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,634
but I don't so much anymore.

108
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,262
My ex-girlfriend actually
used to like to come here.

109
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,431
Are we going to run into her?

110
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,684
No. She actually
doesn't live here.

111
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,852
She lives in Alaska.

112
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,397
Why Alaska?

113
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:05,897
She's from there.

114
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,732
She's from Alaska?

115
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:08,733
Yeah.

116
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,110
Interesting.

117
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,695
What is she doing there now?

118
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,446
She just went back home, or...

119
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,115
Yeah.

120
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:19,035
She, like, teaches history.

121
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,203
What's her name?

122
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,080
Amy.

123
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,582
Do you guys still talk a lot?

124
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,418
Uh, not really.

125
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,420
We're not on bad terms,

126
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:32,048
but we just don't happen
to speak as much anymore.

127
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,110
We shared a room.

128
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,655
I had, you know, two roommates
at the time,

129
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,490
and she moved in with us.

130
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:01,870
So it was us two in one room
and then my two other roommates,

131
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,663
which was kind of weird

132
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,541
because the whole, like,
eight months that I was living here,

133
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,085
and she was still in Florida,

134
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,629
I was kind of hanging out
with them all the time

135
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,132
because they're my friends
or whatever.

136
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,843
And then kind of when she
got here, it was more about...

137
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,928
I guess I sort of...

138
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,389
we just only kind of wanted
to hang out together,

139
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:26,311
so it was, like, we kind of,

140
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,480
you know, fenced ourselves
off from them

141
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,607
even though we were all living
in the same place.

142
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,817
It was, like, this thing

143
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,737
that you want to just
keep it to yourself, I guess,

144
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,616
if that makes sense.

145
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:44,120
What do you think
you're going to do?

146
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,914
That's a good question.

147
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:49,125
Uh...

148
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,795
is this place open 24 hours or...

149
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,588
Yeah.

150
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,799
What, are you just going
to hang out here all night

151
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,094
and wait for her?

152
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,512
Um, yeah.

153
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,473
You think that's a bad idea?

154
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,934
Uh...I don't know
if it's a bad idea.

155
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:09,270
Maybe it's not necessarily
a great idea.

156
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,772
I mean,
I don't know what--

157
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,651
I guess I could just
keep calling her,

158
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,152
like, try to find--

159
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,155
I don't have her address
or anything.

160
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,198
You can...

161
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,535
if you want to hang out
with me, I don't mind,

162
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:28,039
and I mean, just while you keep
trying to find her, you know.

163
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,375
I mean, we could just
hang out at my place

164
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,379
so you don't have to just sit
in the diner alone, you know.

165
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,672
Really?

166
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:40,677
Yeah, I mean, my couch is open.

167
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,846
It's available.

168
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,723
Well, hopefully
I won't have to spend--

169
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,849
No, no, no, no.

170
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,393
That's really nice.
It's not weird.

171
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,603
I just hopefully won't have to
spend the night or anything

172
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,439
because I'm hoping
that she'll call me back

173
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,525
before that happens.

174
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:05,744
What are you doing now?

175
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:11,082
Just making sure
she hasn't called me.

176
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:14,961
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,130
I'm really, I'm really
nervous right now.

178
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,507
I hope I'm not
freaking you out or, like...

179
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,551
I'm just really nervous.

180
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,719
Sorry.

181
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,940
Can I put my stuff down, like...

182
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,692
Yeah, yeah, wherever.

183
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,110
OK.

184
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,675
Do you want a drink
or something?

185
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,218
Sure.

186
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,678
Let me see.

187
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,846
I'm not sure what we have.

188
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,482
Looks pretty barren.

189
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:21,861
Do you want, like, a drink
or do you want a drinky drink?

190
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,154
Like alcohol?

191
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:24,155
Yeah.

192
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,281
Yeah.

193
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,659
I mean, do you want a drink?

194
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,286
Yeah, we can drink.

195
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,455
Get a little loosey goosey.

196
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:36,042
Um...

197
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,169
All I have is this bottle of wine

198
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:41,423
that I was actually
kind of trying to save

199
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,842
because my dad sent it to me.

200
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,594
My dad's, like,
kind of a wine nut

201
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:50,098
so he'll send me these
random, like, wines.

202
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,767
I never really understand them
when I get them.

203
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,894
Like he'll talk about
how great they are,

204
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,396
and then I'll taste them,

205
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,857
and they all taste
the fuckin' same to me.

206
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,483
But we can try it.

207
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,235
I don't know.

208
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,820
Do you know what pinot noir is?

209
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,530
Is that good?

210
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:10,326
I think it's supposed to be better
than, like, merlot or cabernet.

211
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,871
I like most of those
that I've tried,

212
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,039
if you want to try it.

213
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,167
All right.
We'll give it a whirl.

214
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,251
Thank you.

215
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,128
Yeah, no problem.

216
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,882
So this is really nice of you

217
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,884
to let me stay
at your apartment.

218
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,511
I know I already said this,
but I really appreciate it a lot

219
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,472
just because
I don't really know

220
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,682
what I would be doing
right now if...

221
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:33,725
No, that's fine.

222
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:34,976
You know?

223
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,770
Sorry, but I don't have
any wine glasses.

224
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,605
Would it be weird if...

225
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,482
I'm not really picky.

226
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,566
It's fine.

227
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,029
You want to "cheers"?

228
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,073
Yeah, we probably should.

229
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,158
OK. To what?

230
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,701
I have no idea.

231
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:52,952
My old man?

232
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,037
Nah.

233
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,331
Why not?

234
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,625
Why don't we just cheers
to drinking this wine

235
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,751
that I've been saving?

236
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:00,752
OK.

237
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,087
Sounds good.

238
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,593
It smells weird.

239
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,845
It's pretty bitter.

240
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,557
And kind of sweet
at the same time.

241
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,518
Is that good?

242
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,520
It depends on what you like.

243
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,063
I don't really know.

244
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:23,733
Do you like bitter things
or do you like sweet drinks?

245
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,444
I guess I like sweet, maybe.

246
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,604
Do you know how to play
this keyboard?

247
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:43,605
Not really.

248
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,149
It looks like you were trying
to teach yourself right here.

249
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,609
Yeah.

250
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:51,237
I just hold the easy, like,
chord button.

251
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,341
How would I make a G
over here?

252
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,509
Right here.

253
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,427
This is G.

254
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,680
That's C Major.

255
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:17,681
What's that?

256
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:18,848
Is it D?

257
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,849
No.

258
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:20,850
D Minor.

259
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:21,976
Yeah.

260
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,189
So you hear
the difference in this?

261
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,607
This sounds like it's Halloween.

262
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,567
1, 2, 3, 4...

263
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,911
So D...

264
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,455
- A.
- A.

265
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,707
C.

266
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,333
OK.

267
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,212
Ooh, that was good.

268
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,559
That's good!

269
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,519
Sounds like a real song.

270
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,701
Ooh, you got sad there.

271
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,453
That was the Halloween,
wasn't it?

272
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:22,954
Yes.

273
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,456
You're getting good at this.

274
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,207
That song was genius.

275
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,419
I noticed you have
a little recorder over here.

276
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:30,837
What's on here?

277
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,130
Nothing.

278
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,381
Just words.

279
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:34,382
Words?

280
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:35,383
Yeah.

281
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:36,885
Can I play it?

282
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,053
Um...

283
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:41,139
I'm curious to see
what's on it.

284
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,856
What's that?

285
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,316
Did I do that?

286
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,611
I don't even remember.

287
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:59,574
Sounds like a bunch
of stuff going on.

288
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:00,784
Yeah, it sounds like music

289
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,119
that maybe
I would have recorded,

290
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,913
but I don't remember
doing it, so...

291
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,122
But you?

292
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,040
Like this is you,

293
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,958
or, like, you recorded
some music?

294
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,210
No, recorded me.

295
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:10,502
Oh, really?

296
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:11,920
Yeah, sometimes if l, like,

297
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:15,465
don't feel like actually
recording properly with a mike,

298
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,217
I'll just do that so I can remember

299
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,135
the notes of the song
or the idea, you know.

300
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:20,470
Mm-hmm.

301
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:22,514
So what do you play?

302
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:26,184
I can barely play guitar
and barely play drums.

303
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,144
And now you can play this.

304
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:29,771
Yeah, barely.

305
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,981
This much.

306
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,988
Who cuts your hair?

307
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,783
Why? Does it look stupid?

308
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,868
No.

309
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:31,976
Hey.

310
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,977
Sorry.

311
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:33,978
That's OK.

312
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:34,979
It took forever.

313
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:37,107
I couldn't find these matches.

314
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:37,982
It's so cold.

315
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,234
I know.
I'm freezing.

316
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:43,738
It's really bad.
It's so cold!

317
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:44,781
It's super windy.

318
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,409
I don't even know if I'm going
to be able to light this.

319
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:48,702
I'll help you.

320
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,578
Do you want to build
a little fortress?

321
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:00,130
Try it again.

322
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,391
Got it.

323
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:26,656
Do you always
roll your own cigarettes?

324
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:27,198
No, no.

325
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,951
I just didn't have enough money
to buy any nam-brained--

326
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,203
I mean, name-brand.

327
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:35,206
You just switched the letters.
I do that all the time.

328
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,708
Me, too.

329
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:41,087
How do you feel about the hair?

330
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:45,008
Um...I like it.

331
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,552
Can you tell any difference?

332
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:48,845
Not really.

333
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,014
Yeah, me either.

334
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,391
I was scared.
It was 'cause I was nervous.

335
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,185
I didn't want you
to not like it.

336
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,562
No, it was a valiant effort.

337
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,938
Thanks.

338
00:23:59,022 --> 00:23:59,856
You're welcome.

339
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:01,608
I did cut hair, though.

340
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,693
I wasn't pretending
to cut your hair.

341
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:06,154
I mean, I did cut some,
so there is a difference.

342
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:09,824
No, I can feel the little, like,
hairs on my neck and stuff.

343
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:11,242
Oh, can you?

344
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:11,576
It's kind of making me itch.

345
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,577
Sorry.

346
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,246
No, it's OK.
It's natural, it happens.

347
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,748
Yeah.

348
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,584
Man, it's cold.

349
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:20,710
Are you almost
done with that?

350
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:21,378
What's that?

351
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:22,545
Are you almost done?

352
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:26,800
Yeah, actually, I only need
about half to get the fix.

353
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:30,970
I think I'm going to go
and take a shower anyway

354
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:34,432
just to get the, you know,
get the little hairs off.

355
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,518
OK.

356
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,727
Yeah.

357
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:54,429
Hello?

358
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,977
Hello?

359
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,645
What are you doing?

360
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:11,821
It's not good.

361
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:17,035
No, I can't find my friend.

362
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,498
I can't find Samantha.

363
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,877
No, I'm not, I'm not...

364
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,879
I don't know
what's going on.

365
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:31,883
I was staying with her.

366
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:34,719
I'm staying with some--
this guy.

367
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:37,347
I met this guy, and I'm staying
with this guy.

368
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,017
Yeah, this guy named Charlie.

369
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,270
I don't really know.

370
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:51,152
It's not like that.

371
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:53,613
What else am I supposed to do?

372
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,867
Do you know what I'm saying?

373
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:01,663
Hello?

374
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:09,004
Do you want me to explain
what happened?

375
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,883
Why don't I just tell you
what happened?

376
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:19,264
Don't be like that.

377
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:23,143
Hello?

378
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:46,958
Why did you hang up?

379
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,304
Well...

380
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,308
I'm not doing anything wrong.

381
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:10,315
I would not do that.

382
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,235
I wouldn't do that.

383
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,449
Fine.

384
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:08,581
Hi.

385
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:12,002
Hi. What are you doing?

386
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,384
Just practicing.

387
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:21,011
Yeah? How's that going?

388
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:23,513
It's going good.

389
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:25,932
Whose is this?
Is this yours?

390
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:27,726
No, it's my roommate's.

391
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:29,811
I don't even know what it does.

392
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,648
This is basically
the most useless thing

393
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:35,358
I've ever seen in my life.

394
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:36,401
It woke you up.

395
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:37,402
Yeah, that's true.

396
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:38,903
I think it's fun.

397
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:41,239
Sorry.

398
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,241
How'd you like my bed?

399
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:44,826
It's very comfortable.

400
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:47,412
Yeah.

401
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:48,580
Are you mad?

402
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:50,415
I didn't mean to fall asleep.

403
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:52,625
No, I didn't mean
to say it like that.

404
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:57,422
So...what's up?

405
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:00,175
Did you find your friend?

406
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:01,885
She hasn't called.

407
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:03,970
Are you sick of me yet?

408
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:05,513
No.

409
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,766
Are you sure, because
I understand if you are.

410
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:10,268
Nope, it's OK.

411
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,519
Are you sure?

412
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,521
Yeah, I really have
nothing else to do,

413
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:16,858
so it's actually
a nice, pleasant distraction.

414
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:17,859
Guess what.

415
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,069
What?

416
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:23,615
I think I found her address,
my friend's address.

417
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:24,657
How'd you do that?

418
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:27,494
The Internet.
I tried to look her up.

419
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:28,703
I found it.

420
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:30,288
Really? You can do that?

421
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:31,956
Yeah, you can do that.
You didn't know that?

422
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,334
I don't know if I like that.

423
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:35,877
Well, let me see it just so l
see if I know where it is.

424
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,588
Yeah, I wrote it down.

425
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:46,573
See anything?

426
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:47,657
Nn-nnn.

427
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:07,218
You want to ring
the second floor people,

428
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:08,845
and maybe they'll just
let us in?

429
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:05,271
How's it going?

430
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:07,232
Aah!

431
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:08,733
Shhh, someone might hear.

432
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:11,277
Don't do that.
Someone might hear.

433
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:22,038
Are these hula hoops?

434
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,790
They look kind of big
to be hula hoops.

435
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:24,916
I was going to say
the same thing.

436
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,376
They look really big.

437
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:27,836
Oh, they're really heavy.

438
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:29,671
Try to pick one up.

439
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,676
You look so beautiful.

440
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:35,677
Thanks.

441
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,262
You kind of look like a pilgrim.

442
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:38,763
I kind of look like a pilgrim.

443
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,265
But if you put this on,

444
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:43,435
it's kind of like you can
hear yourself really, really well.

445
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:44,769
I know.

446
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:46,563
I'm hearing really weird, too.

447
00:35:46,604 --> 00:35:47,939
With that hat on?

448
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,607
Uh...yeah, it sounds
really different.

449
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:50,608
Put this hat on.

450
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:52,318
OK.

451
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:53,903
It's really weird.

452
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,668
"Feast For Crows."

453
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:19,804
That's kind of a cool cover.

454
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:20,930
Here.

455
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:27,979
What is that, a leaf?

456
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:29,939
Mm-hmm.

457
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:31,608
That's weird.

458
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:37,447
Maybe she's trying to flatten it
for, like, a scrapbook.

459
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:45,288
Is it flat?

460
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,998
Do you think it's done?

461
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:50,210
I don't know.
I don't want to mess it up.

462
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:51,920
I should put it back.

463
00:36:58,093 --> 00:36:59,511
You're next.

464
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:15,485
Kind of, um...

465
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:17,237
kind of cowardly

466
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,030
so I don't really
face the problem head on

467
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:20,990
and just say,
"This isn't working."

468
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:28,665
I kind of do this really
half-assed gradual...

469
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:31,584
kind of just maybe try to avoid
the person or ignore them

470
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:33,545
until they figure it out

471
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:36,047
because I'm too afraid
to just do it.

472
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:37,757
I just want to be--

473
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:41,720
I want what I do and what I feel
to affect only me.

474
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:43,722
I don't want to be responsible
for other people

475
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,890
and what they feel, you know?

476
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:47,559
Does that make any sense?

477
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:49,561
Well, I guess I've been dating
people like you

478
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:51,646
for the past couple of
relationships until now,

479
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,774
and now I'm you.

480
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:56,651
But I don't really like that,

481
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:58,361
but I do know for sure

482
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,530
that I don't want to be
with that person.

483
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:02,282
Yeah.

484
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:03,783
I don't know.

485
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:06,286
Do you think it's like that

486
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:09,080
we're just kind of, like,
naive and impatient,

487
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:11,082
and then when you get older,

488
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:13,585
you sort of mature
into, like, a person

489
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:18,340
that can actually sustain
a real relationship?

490
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:21,134
Or is it that you just...

491
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:23,887
you know, you're stubborn
when you're young,

492
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,014
and then as you get older,

493
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:28,808
you kind of lower your standards
and settle?

494
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:30,769
I hope that's not true.

495
00:38:30,852 --> 00:38:33,772
I don't like the latter at all.

496
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:35,607
What was the first one again?

497
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,026
You just, you hope that
we're going to grow up?

498
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:43,448
That we'll grow up
and be able to not freak out

499
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:45,325
when it starts to get,
you know, intense

500
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:47,035
and not feel trapped, yeah.

501
00:38:47,118 --> 00:38:47,952
Right.

502
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:50,872
And just kind of actually go with it.

503
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:53,875
Well, this is my first time
feeling like that.

504
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:25,782
My bouncy ball
doesn't work in the grass.

505
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:26,991
Really?

506
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:30,620
Yeah, you try it.

507
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:32,288
It sort of does.

508
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:34,290
Let me try one more time.

509
00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:39,504
That's not very fun.

510
00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:41,798
No, it's better on the pavement.

511
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:47,554
You want to have a race?

512
00:39:47,637 --> 00:39:48,430
You want to race?

513
00:39:48,513 --> 00:39:49,681
Yeah, I want to race.

514
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:50,682
Are you fast?

515
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:52,017
Maybe.

516
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,435
Are you fast?

517
00:39:53,518 --> 00:39:54,644
Probably.

518
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:55,937
Probably?

519
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:58,106
All right, where are
we going to race to?

520
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:03,278
That brown patch of grass
and back.

521
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:04,779
To your jacket?

522
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:06,281
No.

523
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:07,866
To this.

524
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:09,075
OK.

525
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,076
Ready?

526
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,579
Hold on. Get behind it.

527
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:13,580
OK, ready?

528
00:40:13,663 --> 00:40:15,081
All right, wait.

529
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:17,083
Does it go, "1, 2, 3, go",

530
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,752
or, "1, 2, 3" and 3 means go?

531
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:20,086
1, 2, 3...go!

532
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,087
OK.

533
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:22,672
Ready?

534
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:24,507
1, 2, 3...go.

535
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:54,704
I beat you.

536
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:57,040
I think I swallowed something
on the way back.

537
00:40:57,082 --> 00:40:58,625
Like a bug?

538
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,085
Yeah.

539
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:07,759
I ran track in high school.

540
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:09,010
Really?

541
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:10,970
Yeah.

542
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:14,057
But I'm out of shape now.

543
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,100
Me, too.

544
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:16,351
But I still beat you!

545
00:41:16,434 --> 00:41:19,896
I know. I'm terrible.

546
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:26,403
So I'm not holding you back
from doing anything today, am l?

547
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:27,570
Nope.

548
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:28,988
You sure?

549
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:30,949
Yep.

550
00:41:31,032 --> 00:41:32,575
Well, do you want to go

551
00:41:32,617 --> 00:41:34,786
to my friend Robin's
art gallery tonight?

552
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:38,248
Is it going to be
totally awesome?

553
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:39,874
Yeah, it's going to be
totally awesome.

554
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,418
Robin's totally awesome.

555
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:42,794
All right, then I'll go.

556
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:44,421
It's at 6:00.

557
00:41:45,505 --> 00:41:46,589
It's at 6:00?

558
00:41:46,631 --> 00:41:47,882
Mm-hmm.

559
00:41:52,387 --> 00:41:54,639
You know what
I could do, actually?

560
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:55,807
What?

561
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:59,394
While we're in the neighborhood,
I could go get my hat.

562
00:41:59,477 --> 00:42:03,064
My friend has had
this hat that I own.

563
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:04,024
OK.

564
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:05,525
And he's had it forever.

565
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:06,651
OK.

566
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:08,987
I could get it back from him.

567
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,655
Let's get it.

568
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:11,656
Is that OK?

569
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,451
Yeah.

570
00:42:14,492 --> 00:42:16,995
Whatever you want to do.

571
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:19,706
Yeah, let's do that.
You want to go now?

572
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:20,707
Yeah.

573
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,917
I'm still out of breath.

574
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,794
Are you?

575
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:26,504
A little bit.

576
00:42:47,525 --> 00:42:49,986
Which one is it?

577
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,363
4-D.

578
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:57,410
Those are sort of backwards.

579
00:43:06,002 --> 00:43:07,337
Maybe he's not here.

580
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:08,838
Hello?

581
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,675
Hey, man, it's Charlie.

582
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:15,095
I was taking a nap.

583
00:43:15,178 --> 00:43:17,055
Oh, sorry.

584
00:43:17,138 --> 00:43:22,644
Um, I don't know,
can we come up?

585
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:24,938
What? Did you say,
"Can we come up?"

586
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:26,690
Yeah.

587
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:28,608
Who are you with?

588
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:33,029
Um, my friend.

589
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:36,324
Who's your friend?

590
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:37,575
Open the door, please.

591
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:43,832
What?
I can't understand you.

592
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:47,585
I don't know.

593
00:43:47,627 --> 00:43:51,089
Come on,
can we please come in?

594
00:43:51,172 --> 00:43:53,299
Did I hear a girl's voice?

595
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:55,385
Yeah.

596
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:58,596
Who are you, stranger?

597
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,016
I think he said,
"Who are you, stranger?"

598
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:02,434
I'm Jamie.

599
00:44:09,315 --> 00:44:12,277
Hey, Charlie, my friend.

600
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:14,362
Hold on.
Step back from the peep hole.

601
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:15,488
Are you serious?

602
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:17,782
I can't focus you.

603
00:44:17,866 --> 00:44:20,118
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

604
00:44:20,201 --> 00:44:21,077
How you doin', man?

605
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,748
Good. Good to see you.
It's been a long time.

606
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:26,833
Hey, you guys
got to take your shoes off.

607
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:28,835
It's a house rule.

608
00:44:28,918 --> 00:44:30,003
Are you serious?

609
00:44:30,086 --> 00:44:31,338
Yeah.

610
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:34,841
No shoes on the rug
or beyond this point, basically.

611
00:44:34,924 --> 00:44:35,842
OK.

612
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:36,843
Come on in.

613
00:44:36,926 --> 00:44:38,011
My name is Adam.

614
00:44:38,094 --> 00:44:39,012
I'm Jamie.

615
00:44:39,095 --> 00:44:40,013
Nice to meet you.

616
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:41,848
Wow, that's a strong handshake.

617
00:44:41,931 --> 00:44:42,849
Boy.

618
00:44:42,932 --> 00:44:43,975
Uh...

619
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,773
Charlie, today, man.

620
00:44:49,814 --> 00:44:50,815
Sorry.

621
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:53,902
What do you got there?

622
00:44:53,985 --> 00:44:55,111
Got where?

623
00:44:55,153 --> 00:44:56,654
Never mind.

624
00:44:56,738 --> 00:44:59,574
They're stool coasters,
chair coasters.

625
00:44:59,657 --> 00:45:02,243
I don't know what they're called.

626
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:05,455
Jess likes them,
but, you know,

627
00:45:05,538 --> 00:45:09,793
'cause they keep the rug smooth,
but you can see them, you know.

628
00:45:09,834 --> 00:45:11,836
You don't like
that you can see them?

629
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,837
Well, I don't care.

630
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:13,838
I'm just saying
you can see them.

631
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,839
I like your curtains here.

632
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:16,424
Did you pick all this stuff out?

633
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:17,550
I did not.

634
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:20,387
I picked out very little
of this stuff.

635
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:22,347
Who picked it out?
Your girlfriend?

636
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:24,015
My future wife.

637
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:26,351
Wow. Since when?

638
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:27,560
Since when?

639
00:45:27,644 --> 00:45:31,022
Um, since...

640
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:35,026
June is when I proposed,

641
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:38,196
is when I got down
on one knee and...

642
00:45:38,279 --> 00:45:39,989
what do you say?

643
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:44,077
Made it...made, uh...

644
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:48,248
Made her an honest woman.

645
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:49,249
I don't know.

646
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:50,458
Guys don't wear rings, though.

647
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:51,751
There's no way...

648
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:52,877
To know.

649
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:54,087
Yeah.

650
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:56,297
How long have you been dating?

651
00:45:56,381 --> 00:45:59,134
Seven years.

652
00:45:59,217 --> 00:45:59,926
Impressive, right?

653
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,428
It's a long time.

654
00:46:01,511 --> 00:46:03,096
It's almost, like,
embarrassingly long

655
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:05,306
to now finally be engaged.

656
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,017
You wanted to be engaged...

657
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,685
Well, it's like, you know,

658
00:46:08,768 --> 00:46:10,228
once you've reached
the seven-year point

659
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:12,397
and then you're like,
"Oh, now we're engaged?"

660
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,567
It's like we might as well have
gotten engaged four years ago.

661
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:18,820
He really just found out
she had all this nice shit.

662
00:46:18,903 --> 00:46:21,364
Yeah, I found that out.

663
00:46:21,406 --> 00:46:24,325
She finally invited me
into her place,

664
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:26,536
and I was like, "Whoa,
you've got a cool apartment.

665
00:46:26,578 --> 00:46:27,996
Can I live here?"

666
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,414
Out came the ring.

667
00:46:29,497 --> 00:46:30,790
Yeah.

668
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:32,625
Uh, Charlie?

669
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:34,252
Adam.

670
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:36,254
What are you doing here?

671
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:39,049
Um, I just thought
I'd pay you a visit.

672
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:42,927
No, I actually...I wanted to get
my hat that you've had for ages

673
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:45,930
that I am going to need
to reclaim.

674
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:49,059
That figures that
the first time I see you--

675
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,894
How does that figure?

676
00:46:50,977 --> 00:46:54,105
You're all locked up
in paradise here.

677
00:46:54,189 --> 00:46:55,982
I've got your hat.

678
00:46:56,066 --> 00:46:57,150
Thank you.

679
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:58,568
You're welcome.

680
00:47:08,787 --> 00:47:10,205
Are you invited
to the wedding?

681
00:47:10,288 --> 00:47:11,623
Yeah, of course.

682
00:47:11,706 --> 00:47:13,625
Are you going to be
the best man?

683
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,502
Um, I don't think so.

684
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:17,545
I think somebody else
snatched it.

685
00:47:20,298 --> 00:47:22,676
I appreciate the use
of that fine hat.

686
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:24,260
How did it
work out for you?

687
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:25,303
It worked out great.

688
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:26,596
That's a great hat.

689
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:28,765
Hey, are you guys hungry?

690
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:30,475
Do you guys like cole slaw?

691
00:47:30,558 --> 00:47:31,476
Yeah.

692
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:32,811
You want some?

693
00:47:32,894 --> 00:47:34,104
I've got this great cole slaw

694
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:35,939
that I'm actually
really hungry for.

695
00:47:36,022 --> 00:47:38,775
And so I figure if I'm going to
go get myself some...

696
00:47:38,817 --> 00:47:41,111
I feel like cole slaw
is not something

697
00:47:41,152 --> 00:47:43,905
that our generation
really appreciates

698
00:47:43,988 --> 00:47:45,657
as its own thing.

699
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:48,034
I get it for sides
at restaurants all the time.

700
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:49,536
Yeah, but it's a side.

701
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:51,538
It's been relegated to the sides
of other meals.

702
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:53,790
But I'm saying I just sometimes
eat cole slaw.

703
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:55,375
Like a salad of cole slaw?

704
00:47:55,458 --> 00:47:56,835
Not like anything.

705
00:47:56,918 --> 00:48:00,714
Just a big old bowl of cole slaw.

706
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:01,631
It's good, right?

707
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:03,341
Yep.

708
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:05,343
There's more
where that came from.

709
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:06,970
Eat up.

710
00:48:24,362 --> 00:48:26,781
Where's your hat?

711
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:28,575
Oh!

712
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:52,724
What's that?

713
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:53,850
My electric bill,

714
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:57,896
but it's, like, always incorrect.

715
00:48:57,979 --> 00:49:01,483
I need a...

716
00:49:01,566 --> 00:49:04,611
something to spread the mayo.

717
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:08,907
Use this.

718
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:12,619
Yeah, but we just used that.

719
00:49:20,251 --> 00:49:22,879
Is yours delicious?

720
00:49:22,962 --> 00:49:24,547
It's pretty awesome.

721
00:49:24,589 --> 00:49:25,757
Is it?

722
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,550
Yeah.

723
00:49:27,592 --> 00:49:29,719
Are you afraid to try this?

724
00:49:29,803 --> 00:49:31,429
To what?

725
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:32,931
To try this?

726
00:49:32,972 --> 00:49:34,808
Sort of.

727
00:49:34,891 --> 00:49:37,727
That is a slathering
of the mayonnaise and mustard.

728
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:39,229
Eat your own sandwich!

729
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,647
I am.

730
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:45,610
OK, I'm going to
cut it in half first.

731
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:02,669
This is the worst game
I've ever played.

732
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:08,341
That's funny.

733
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:10,885
Isn't that good?

734
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:12,095
That's kind of enjoyable.

735
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:13,096
I know.

736
00:50:13,138 --> 00:50:15,765
Can I take a shower?
Do you mind?

737
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:16,808
No.

738
00:50:53,845 --> 00:50:55,680
Hey, Charlie?

739
00:51:00,101 --> 00:51:01,519
Charlie?

740
00:53:18,656 --> 00:53:21,201
Oh, my God! Jamie!

741
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:26,748
I can't believe you came!

742
00:53:26,831 --> 00:53:27,749
You look great!

743
00:53:27,832 --> 00:53:29,292
It's so good to see you...

744
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:30,669
It's great to see you, too!

745
00:53:30,752 --> 00:53:31,878
...in New York!

746
00:53:31,961 --> 00:53:33,463
I'm so excited to be here!

747
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:42,138
I have this friend, Paul,

748
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,558
who kind of treads
the androgyny line,

749
00:53:45,642 --> 00:53:48,603
and I was sort of
inspired by him.

750
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:51,147
Um, I think I'm going to get
another one...

751
00:53:51,189 --> 00:53:52,691
Which one?

752
00:53:52,732 --> 00:53:54,150
The blue and green one.

753
00:53:54,192 --> 00:53:55,735
It's, like, the only one

754
00:53:55,819 --> 00:53:57,987
that I really can, like,
definitely say I'm proud of.

755
00:54:15,338 --> 00:54:16,715
Charlie Miller.

756
00:54:16,756 --> 00:54:18,008
Ha ha!

757
00:54:18,049 --> 00:54:19,926
What the fuck is up, buddy?

758
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:20,969
How's it going?

759
00:54:21,052 --> 00:54:22,595
What the fuck
are you doing here?

760
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:23,596
Nothing, you know.

761
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,764
Checking out some art.

762
00:54:24,848 --> 00:54:25,932
Yeah?

763
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:27,392
Yeah.

764
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:28,768
Are you writing a paper?

765
00:54:28,852 --> 00:54:29,769
What?

766
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:31,146
Are you writing a paper?

767
00:54:31,229 --> 00:54:32,188
On...

768
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:33,189
The art?

769
00:54:33,231 --> 00:54:34,065
No.

770
00:54:34,149 --> 00:54:35,483
I don't think I've seen you
come out of Park Slope

771
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:38,028
in what, like a month?

772
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:40,321
Uh, I leave.
I come out.

773
00:54:40,405 --> 00:54:41,364
Yeah?

774
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:42,991
Get the paper
or something like that?

775
00:54:43,074 --> 00:54:43,867
I'm out right now.

776
00:54:43,908 --> 00:54:45,994
Yeah, you are right now.

777
00:54:46,077 --> 00:54:47,787
Well, why don't you
call me back sometime?

778
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:49,164
What do you mean?

779
00:54:49,247 --> 00:54:51,541
Like I don't know,
I called you like two weeks ago.

780
00:54:51,624 --> 00:54:53,251
Still haven't heard from you.

781
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:55,754
No, seriously,
like, what are you doing?

782
00:54:55,795 --> 00:54:57,839
I mean, I haven't seen you
in, like, a month.

783
00:54:57,922 --> 00:54:59,424
I don't know.

784
00:54:59,507 --> 00:55:01,092
I mean, I've been kind of...

785
00:55:01,176 --> 00:55:03,803
well, I haven't really
been that busy.

786
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,305
Just forget it.

787
00:55:05,388 --> 00:55:06,848
Who the fuck is this?

788
00:55:08,183 --> 00:55:10,352
I'm Jamie. Hi.

789
00:55:10,435 --> 00:55:11,644
Hi.

790
00:55:12,937 --> 00:55:14,939
So what are you...
how'd you end up here?

791
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:17,567
You just were like, "Hey, I want
to come out of Park Slope

792
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:19,235
for the first time in a year,
so I'm going to go to an art show"?

793
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:22,572
Well, no, her friend
is actually...

794
00:55:22,655 --> 00:55:23,948
Yeah, Robin did...

795
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:25,492
Oh, Robin's your friend?

796
00:55:25,575 --> 00:55:27,577
Yeah, from high school.

797
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:29,996
Yeah, I know Robin.
That's why I'm here.

798
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,039
Oh, great.

799
00:55:31,122 --> 00:55:32,624
I met Robin, like, a year ago.

800
00:55:32,707 --> 00:55:34,626
It was one of those, like,
here's some rock bands

801
00:55:34,709 --> 00:55:36,419
and here's some art
and here's some, you know,

802
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:38,421
face painting,
and get some cotton candy--

803
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:39,339
this little carnival thing.

804
00:55:39,422 --> 00:55:40,715
That's awesome.

805
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,092
It was, like, over on the piers.

806
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:42,884
OK.

807
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:43,593
Are you from here?

808
00:55:43,677 --> 00:55:45,845
No, no,
I'm from Atlanta actually.

809
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:48,098
I was here visiting not Robin,
but another friend,

810
00:55:48,139 --> 00:55:49,933
who I can't find, so...

811
00:55:49,974 --> 00:55:51,101
Isn't Robin from Atlanta?

812
00:55:51,184 --> 00:55:52,435
Yeah, she is.

813
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:54,646
So you've known her
for, like, a long time, right?

814
00:55:54,729 --> 00:55:56,648
Yeah, we pretty much
grew up together.

815
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:57,691
Was she always like that?

816
00:55:57,774 --> 00:55:59,150
Like too cool for school
and all that?

817
00:55:59,192 --> 00:56:00,735
Too cool for school?
Kind of.

818
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:01,903
That's kind of Robin.

819
00:56:01,986 --> 00:56:03,863
But maybe now more so--
her hair.

820
00:56:03,947 --> 00:56:05,448
I haven't seen her hair like that.

821
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:06,783
What do you do?

822
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:10,245
Well, right now I work
at, um, a restaurant.

823
00:56:10,328 --> 00:56:14,374
Oh, yeah?
What kind of restaurant?

824
00:56:14,457 --> 00:56:16,084
A chain restaurant.

825
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:17,752
What do you mean
"a chain restaurant"?

826
00:56:17,836 --> 00:56:19,587
Like Long John Silver's?

827
00:56:19,671 --> 00:56:21,464
Not quite.

828
00:56:21,506 --> 00:56:24,426
Like at the drive-thru,
you're like, "No fish sticks."

829
00:56:24,509 --> 00:56:26,136
Applebee's, actually.

830
00:56:26,177 --> 00:56:27,721
Applebee's!

831
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:37,188
You're not gearing up to what,
go back to Florida, are you?

832
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:38,398
What?

833
00:56:38,481 --> 00:56:40,400
Last time I talked to you,
you said you were like,

834
00:56:40,483 --> 00:56:42,485
"Oh, I'm moving back to Florida,
I'm done with this", and all that,

835
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:45,321
"it's too cold up here,
I hate it."

836
00:56:45,363 --> 00:56:46,990
I didn't know that.

837
00:56:47,073 --> 00:56:49,826
No, he's, like, hung up
on some girl back in Florida.

838
00:56:49,868 --> 00:56:51,077
No, I'm not.

839
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:52,996
Whatever. You talk about her,
like, all the time.

840
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:54,456
No, I don't!
No, I don't!

841
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:56,332
I'm just saying, I mean,
if you move back to Florida,

842
00:56:56,374 --> 00:56:57,375
I'm just letting you know
right now

843
00:56:57,459 --> 00:57:00,295
that that means officially
you and I are no longer friends.

844
00:57:00,378 --> 00:57:02,047
That's all. That's all.

845
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:03,673
Well, thanks a lot for that.

846
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:06,176
It's just a rule I have to make.

847
00:57:12,098 --> 00:57:14,893
This is my good friend,
so you better be nice to her.

848
00:57:14,976 --> 00:57:16,561
Jamie. Yeah, I met Jamie.

849
00:57:16,644 --> 00:57:19,064
He's been OK.
Not too bad.

850
00:57:19,147 --> 00:57:20,565
I had my shots today.

851
00:57:20,648 --> 00:57:22,067
I'm totally right.

852
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:23,693
Your shots, or your shots?

853
00:57:23,735 --> 00:57:24,778
No, both.

854
00:57:24,861 --> 00:57:26,196
OK.

855
00:57:26,237 --> 00:57:27,489
That's good work.

856
00:57:27,572 --> 00:57:28,615
Thanks.

857
00:57:28,698 --> 00:57:30,116
Is that sincere?

858
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,411
Do you...
so do you know Robin?

859
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:34,704
No, we just met.

860
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:35,747
Oh, OK.

861
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:37,374
Me and him, way back.

862
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:38,667
Yeah, sure.

863
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:39,834
Ar, ar.

864
00:57:39,918 --> 00:57:41,419
Really?

865
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:42,128
Yeah.

866
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:43,171
Like this.

867
00:57:43,254 --> 00:57:45,715
High school, middle school...

868
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:47,133
Isn't that kind of weird

869
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:49,844
that they go back
and we go back?

870
00:57:49,928 --> 00:57:51,471
You guys know--
for real?

871
00:57:51,554 --> 00:57:53,390
Yeah, Charlie Miller.

872
00:57:53,431 --> 00:57:55,934
Tell me something
about Charlie.

873
00:57:56,017 --> 00:57:56,935
Charlie used to--

874
00:57:57,018 --> 00:57:58,144
Wait, wait, wait.

875
00:57:58,228 --> 00:58:00,522
OK, uh, tell me...

876
00:58:00,605 --> 00:58:03,400
tell me something
that you know about Charlie

877
00:58:03,441 --> 00:58:06,236
from hanging out with him
for a day,

878
00:58:06,277 --> 00:58:07,904
and then we'll ask,

879
00:58:07,987 --> 00:58:10,198
we'll ask Kyle,
because I don't believe him.

880
00:58:10,281 --> 00:58:11,574
Should I whisper it to you?

881
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:13,118
Yeah, whisper it to me.

882
00:58:13,201 --> 00:58:14,828
All right, all right.

883
00:58:16,913 --> 00:58:19,499
What have you been doing
for the past day?

884
00:58:19,582 --> 00:58:20,875
Nothing.

885
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:22,544
We've just been hanging out.

886
00:58:22,627 --> 00:58:25,630
OK, What is Charlie's
least favorite aspect

887
00:58:25,714 --> 00:58:27,674
of getting his hair cut?

888
00:58:27,757 --> 00:58:30,176
Um, any part of it--

889
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:33,513
paying for it.

890
00:58:33,596 --> 00:58:35,056
So you're saying he's stingy.

891
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,475
The back, the back--
making the back look right.

892
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:40,353
No, it's wrong.
It's the itchy hair.

893
00:58:40,437 --> 00:58:42,772
He doesn't like having
itchy hair down his shirt.

894
00:58:42,814 --> 00:58:45,191
I never cut his hair
when we were in high school

895
00:58:45,275 --> 00:58:46,443
or middle school

896
00:58:46,484 --> 00:58:48,361
because that's not something
you do.

897
00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:49,946
Like who does that,

898
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,490
like, "Hey, guy, let's put
this Nintendo 64 down

899
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:54,325
and cut each other's hair"?

900
00:58:54,409 --> 00:58:55,702
Who does that?

901
00:58:55,785 --> 00:58:56,911
Friends.

902
00:58:56,995 --> 00:58:58,580
We've gotten
our hair cut together.

903
00:58:58,663 --> 00:59:00,081
OK, you're girls.

904
00:59:00,165 --> 00:59:02,208
I've cut her hair, actually.

905
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:05,170
What guy, except for the military,
gets their hair cut together?

906
00:59:05,211 --> 00:59:06,421
I mean, seriously.

907
00:59:06,504 --> 00:59:07,756
So you guys really--

908
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:09,049
I'll give you $20.

909
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:10,425
Go find me a guy

910
00:59:10,508 --> 00:59:12,802
who got his hair cut with
his friend on a regular basis,

911
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:14,763
enough to know he doesn't like
what, itchy hair?

912
00:59:14,846 --> 00:59:16,806
How does she know that?

913
00:59:16,848 --> 00:59:18,475
Is that even true?

914
00:59:18,516 --> 00:59:20,018
I don't like it.

915
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,811
She gave me a haircut, man.

916
00:59:21,853 --> 00:59:23,688
I thought you met her yesterday!

917
00:59:23,772 --> 00:59:25,440
It was yesterday.

918
00:59:25,523 --> 00:59:27,025
What is wrong with you?

919
00:59:27,108 --> 00:59:28,693
You just meet some girl
and you're like,

920
00:59:28,777 --> 00:59:31,196
"Hey, what's up?
Cut my hair, girl."

921
00:59:31,279 --> 00:59:32,697
You can't even tell.

922
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:37,869
That's like a $200 haircut
in this city.

923
00:59:37,952 --> 00:59:39,996
You gave her $200
for that haircut?

924
00:59:40,038 --> 00:59:42,665
That will be $250.

925
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:44,834
I barely did anything.
I was a little nervous.

926
00:59:44,918 --> 00:59:46,753
Can you cut my hair?

927
00:59:46,836 --> 00:59:48,672
I thought you worked
at Applebee's.

928
00:59:48,755 --> 00:59:49,714
You cut hair, too?

929
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:52,008
Yeah, I do, on the side.

930
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:53,051
Kyle, be nice.

931
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:54,386
She brought it up.

932
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:56,888
I didn't tell you
to be rude to my friend.

933
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:59,015
Do you guys, like,
want to leave soon?

934
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:00,016
Sure.

935
01:00:00,058 --> 01:00:02,560
I'm just kind of...

936
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:04,771
OK.

937
01:00:04,854 --> 01:00:05,980
Yeah?

938
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:07,524
Are you guys coming?

939
01:00:07,565 --> 01:00:08,775
Where?

940
01:00:08,858 --> 01:00:10,026
Ah, I think, actually,

941
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:12,070
a bunch of people
are coming to my house later,

942
01:00:12,153 --> 01:00:14,406
but it'll be a little while.

943
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:17,325
Do you just want to sort of
chill out and listen to music?

944
01:03:04,784 --> 01:03:06,327
We got a girl.

945
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:07,537
Ask the girl.

946
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:10,915
If you meet some strange guy
and you go home--

947
01:03:10,999 --> 01:03:12,375
I'm not a strange guy.

948
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:14,002
He's not that strange.

949
01:03:14,085 --> 01:03:15,545
He's a stranger.

950
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:16,880
And you go home with him,

951
01:03:16,963 --> 01:03:19,049
and you sleep over
at his house,

952
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,884
doesn't that mean
you kind of dig him?

953
01:03:20,967 --> 01:03:22,469
Yeah.

954
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,476
OK, ready?

955
01:03:35,148 --> 01:03:36,858
Let me see.

956
01:03:36,941 --> 01:03:39,402
Do you know Robin?

957
01:03:39,444 --> 01:03:40,612
Uh, not really.

958
01:03:40,695 --> 01:03:42,489
I went with a friend of hers,

959
01:03:42,572 --> 01:03:44,866
and I mean,
I subsequently met her,

960
01:03:44,949 --> 01:03:46,743
but I don't know her very well.

961
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:48,745
Do you live in the city?

962
01:03:48,787 --> 01:03:50,580
Yeah, I live in Park Slope.

963
01:03:50,663 --> 01:03:51,623
Nice.

964
01:03:51,664 --> 01:03:53,124
I live in Park Slope, too.

965
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:56,044
That's a lovely place to be.

966
01:03:56,127 --> 01:03:58,088
Yeah, it's great.

967
01:03:58,171 --> 01:04:00,590
And what do you do?

968
01:04:00,632 --> 01:04:03,510
As of right now, not much.

969
01:04:03,593 --> 01:04:06,888
I actually, I just quit my job
a few weeks ago,

970
01:04:06,971 --> 01:04:11,142
and I've just kind of been
slinking around, you know.

971
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:13,269
I've heard of that.

972
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,146
I think I've done that.

973
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:17,691
Actually I'm doing that, too,
to be honest--

974
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:19,192
slinking around.

975
01:04:19,275 --> 01:04:20,944
How's it going for you?

976
01:04:20,985 --> 01:04:25,240
It's not paying the rent, really,
but I'm hoping someday it will.

977
01:04:25,323 --> 01:04:27,742
I'm waiting
for the glory to come.

978
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:29,869
Yeah, we need to devise a plot

979
01:04:29,953 --> 01:04:32,580
to where we can basically do
absolutely nothing

980
01:04:32,664 --> 01:04:34,124
and get our bills paid.

981
01:04:36,042 --> 01:04:37,252
I don't know.

982
01:04:37,335 --> 01:04:38,586
What happened?

983
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:39,587
Nothing.

984
01:04:39,671 --> 01:04:40,630
Nothing happened?

985
01:04:40,714 --> 01:04:42,090
No, I mean,
some stuff happened.

986
01:04:42,173 --> 01:04:43,091
What happened?

987
01:04:43,174 --> 01:04:45,593
I don't know.
Just some stuff.

988
01:04:45,677 --> 01:04:47,804
What? You don't have to tell me.

989
01:04:47,846 --> 01:04:50,098
I didn't sleep with him, though.

990
01:04:50,181 --> 01:04:52,100
But the thing is
that, like, you know,

991
01:04:52,183 --> 01:04:57,105
I've just sort of had,
like, a hard time, um...

992
01:04:57,188 --> 01:05:01,109
crossing that line a little bit,
and I don't really know why.

993
01:05:01,192 --> 01:05:04,320
Like a lot of, like, my,
like, recent boyfriends,

994
01:05:04,362 --> 01:05:10,577
like, I've just had, like,
such an intense connection

995
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:12,078
to them kind of emotionally

996
01:05:12,162 --> 01:05:17,709
and we just talk about
so much stuff that l, um...

997
01:05:17,792 --> 01:05:20,628
it's sort of hard for me
to, like, imagine,

998
01:05:20,712 --> 01:05:24,507
like, being sort of, like,
sexy with them

999
01:05:24,549 --> 01:05:27,302
when, like, it's sort of like
it's all, like, cute

1000
01:05:27,385 --> 01:05:29,679
and, like, sweet
and, like, intense

1001
01:05:29,721 --> 01:05:31,723
but like in a cerebral way,
kind of.

1002
01:05:31,806 --> 01:05:33,308
You, like, see these,
like, movies

1003
01:05:33,391 --> 01:05:35,852
and, like, these sex scenes
are, like, so animalistic,

1004
01:05:35,894 --> 01:05:39,689
and l, like, don't...
I don't know.

1005
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:41,149
I just, like, don't--

1006
01:05:41,232 --> 01:05:45,904
I can't, like, I can't reconcile,
like, something like that

1007
01:05:45,987 --> 01:05:47,906
with, like, something like
what I've had with these people

1008
01:05:47,989 --> 01:05:49,407
that I've sort of had, like,

1009
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:51,993
a little bit longer term
relationships with, you know.

1010
01:05:52,077 --> 01:05:53,078
Mm-hmm.

1011
01:05:53,161 --> 01:05:56,498
Um, so I guess
I decided recently

1012
01:05:56,581 --> 01:05:59,250
that, like, what I really needed
was, like, someone,

1013
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:02,754
like, totally hot,
like, unquestionably hot

1014
01:06:02,796 --> 01:06:05,840
that was kind of a jerk maybe
and so I could just get over it.

1015
01:06:05,924 --> 01:06:08,176
So you could cross the line--

1016
01:06:08,259 --> 01:06:10,553
Well, maybe just get over
some of it, you know,

1017
01:06:10,637 --> 01:06:13,348
because, like--and someone maybe
who I didn't have to...

1018
01:06:13,431 --> 01:06:17,227
like, I would never do anything
with anyone

1019
01:06:17,268 --> 01:06:19,396
who, like, I didn't feel,
like, a connection to,

1020
01:06:19,479 --> 01:06:23,566
but I kind of just wanted, like,
to not have to worry about...

1021
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,777
like, I didn't want this,
like, long history,

1022
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:27,570
like, I didn't want
all these memories of us,

1023
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:29,197
like, sort of having, like,
this, you know,

1024
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,573
psychological stuff going on.

1025
01:06:30,615 --> 01:06:32,742
I just wanted it to be, like,
sort of more visceral.

1026
01:06:32,826 --> 01:06:34,828
I think that's what I need.

1027
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:43,712
I've had some drinks,
I will confess.

1028
01:06:43,795 --> 01:06:45,213
What's your drink of choice?

1029
01:06:45,296 --> 01:06:48,842
Well, the gallery
had beer, so I drank that.

1030
01:06:48,925 --> 01:06:53,221
And, um, there was a few nips
of something along the way.

1031
01:06:53,304 --> 01:06:55,932
I don't know,
I haven't really been--

1032
01:06:56,016 --> 01:06:58,893
Like illicit nips,
or liquid nips?

1033
01:06:58,977 --> 01:07:00,228
Liquid.

1034
01:07:00,311 --> 01:07:01,813
What would be illicit?

1035
01:07:01,896 --> 01:07:05,316
Well, there's, you know,
there's pills, there's powders,

1036
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,651
there's pipes...

1037
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:08,153
No, none of that.

1038
01:07:08,236 --> 01:07:10,780
Strictly something
you put in a glass.

1039
01:07:10,822 --> 01:07:12,907
And is legal.

1040
01:07:12,991 --> 01:07:14,451
Yeah.

1041
01:07:14,492 --> 01:07:16,745
But, uh...

1042
01:07:16,828 --> 01:07:20,749
like, I remember
this one time,

1043
01:07:20,832 --> 01:07:23,043
um, I was sitting in that chair
over there,

1044
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:27,422
and he was, like, lying on
his stomach, like, on the bed,

1045
01:07:27,505 --> 01:07:29,632
and we were just
listening to music and stuff,

1046
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:30,967
and l, like...

1047
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:33,303
I never would have, like,
asked anyone this before,

1048
01:07:33,386 --> 01:07:36,514
but he was lying on his stomach,
like, reading a book,

1049
01:07:36,598 --> 01:07:39,100
and I was just like, "Hey,
Scott, can I ask you something?"

1050
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:40,685
and he's, like, "What?"

1051
01:07:40,769 --> 01:07:46,441
And I was like, "Can I just,
like, lay on top of you?"

1052
01:07:46,524 --> 01:07:47,567
What did he say?

1053
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:50,820
He was, like, "Uh...OK."

1054
01:07:50,862 --> 01:07:54,741
So l, like, came over here
and, like, just laid,

1055
01:07:54,824 --> 01:07:58,578
like, directly, like, stacked,
like, right on top of him

1056
01:07:58,661 --> 01:08:02,957
and just laid on top of him,
and, like, we talked for a while.

1057
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:04,834
And I just remember thinking,
like, you know,

1058
01:08:04,918 --> 01:08:08,254
like one of my roommates,
like, here,

1059
01:08:08,338 --> 01:08:10,423
like, has never even
had a boyfriend,

1060
01:08:10,507 --> 01:08:12,425
and, like, I just remember,
like, saying to him,

1061
01:08:12,509 --> 01:08:14,177
"Like, this, like, feels really good.

1062
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,804
Like, I don't even
know you that well.

1063
01:08:15,887 --> 01:08:16,721
It just feels really good

1064
01:08:16,805 --> 01:08:20,642
to, like, be, like,
close to someone and stuff."

1065
01:08:20,725 --> 01:08:24,104
And it wasn't, like,
really, like, a sexual thing.

1066
01:08:24,187 --> 01:08:26,439
It was kind of like
I was fully clothed,

1067
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:27,982
just, like, laying on top of him,

1068
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:29,359
and I was just like,

1069
01:08:29,442 --> 01:08:32,487
I just sort of felt,
like, sort of sad in that moment

1070
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:34,864
for, like, people who, like,
don't have,

1071
01:08:34,906 --> 01:08:36,366
like, that, like, contact ever.

1072
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:37,784
You know what I mean?

1073
01:08:37,867 --> 01:08:39,577
Because, like, in a sense,
like, it was like,

1074
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:41,371
in a sense
it was, like, all I needed.

1075
01:08:41,454 --> 01:08:43,456
Like I didn't even need,
like, I didn't even need,

1076
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:45,792
like, to get over,
like, all this stuff really.

1077
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:47,794
Like, I think that's really
just what I needed

1078
01:08:47,877 --> 01:08:49,004
was just, like, closeness

1079
01:08:49,087 --> 01:08:50,380
and, like, being, like,
comfortable with someone,

1080
01:08:50,463 --> 01:08:52,340
and I think that's
why it was so hard

1081
01:08:52,424 --> 01:08:55,093
to, like, say the things
that I said to him that night,

1082
01:08:55,176 --> 01:08:59,764
like, when I sort of told him
that I couldn't do it anymore.

1083
01:08:59,848 --> 01:09:01,182
I talked to this girl,

1084
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:02,976
and her dad, like,
runs some old carpet place,

1085
01:09:03,059 --> 01:09:06,271
and she can get, like, remnants,
like, old carpet pieces

1086
01:09:06,354 --> 01:09:07,772
and then just, like,
sew the edges.

1087
01:09:07,856 --> 01:09:09,441
It's, like, 50 bucks
to sew the edges.

1088
01:09:09,524 --> 01:09:12,068
So I got, like, a bunch
of, like, little weird rugs.

1089
01:09:20,535 --> 01:09:22,287
I feel really bad.

1090
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:24,080
No, you should not feel bad.

1091
01:09:24,122 --> 01:09:26,082
I just have this class tomorrow.

1092
01:09:26,124 --> 01:09:27,167
Oh, my God.

1093
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,836
You should have told me
you had class tomorrow.

1094
01:09:41,014 --> 01:09:42,515
Hey.

1095
01:09:42,599 --> 01:09:43,850
How's it going?

1096
01:09:43,933 --> 01:09:44,851
Good.

1097
01:09:44,934 --> 01:09:47,645
I'm just...

1098
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:48,772
Enjoying the taps?

1099
01:09:48,813 --> 01:09:50,899
Oh, yeah, messin' around.

1100
01:09:50,982 --> 01:09:53,109
What have you been doing?

1101
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:55,278
Nothing, just walking around.

1102
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:56,905
Talk to anybody interesting?

1103
01:09:56,988 --> 01:09:58,406
Talked to the same folks.

1104
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:59,741
Folks.

1105
01:09:59,824 --> 01:10:02,744
But no, you can't really get
into anything that important

1106
01:10:02,827 --> 01:10:06,122
in this environment,
can you?

1107
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:08,041
Depending.

1108
01:10:08,124 --> 01:10:11,878
Depending if, you know, what
both people want to talk about.

1109
01:10:18,593 --> 01:10:20,804
What's that for?

1110
01:10:20,845 --> 01:10:21,971
Your concert.

1111
01:10:22,055 --> 01:10:23,765
My playing?

1112
01:10:23,848 --> 01:10:25,350
I was kind of trying to be quiet.

1113
01:10:25,433 --> 01:10:26,643
Watch.

1114
01:10:26,726 --> 01:10:28,603
This is a good technique
for high-five.

1115
01:10:28,687 --> 01:10:30,939
If you look at my elbow
and I look at yours,

1116
01:10:31,022 --> 01:10:32,982
supposedly
we'll connect better.

1117
01:10:33,066 --> 01:10:34,776
Instead of hands.

1118
01:10:34,859 --> 01:10:37,153
Yeah, like, don't look
at my hand when you move.

1119
01:10:37,237 --> 01:10:38,988
Look at my elbow,
and I'll look at yours.

1120
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:39,989
OK, ready?

1121
01:10:40,031 --> 01:10:41,199
Ready, go.

1122
01:10:41,282 --> 01:10:43,326
Wait, hold on.

1123
01:10:44,494 --> 01:10:45,412
OK.

1124
01:10:45,495 --> 01:10:46,955
Do it again.

1125
01:10:47,038 --> 01:10:50,250
You know, I mean, I don't want
to, like, stop your fun.

1126
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:52,293
You should have
told me earlier

1127
01:10:52,377 --> 01:10:56,506
when I said
about the sort of party.

1128
01:10:56,589 --> 01:11:00,218
Maybe if we could, like,
lower the music or something,

1129
01:11:00,301 --> 01:11:02,012
and you can blame it on me.

1130
01:11:02,053 --> 01:11:04,180
You can tell everybody that
I'm a horrendous awful...

1131
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:06,516
No, you're not
a horrendous awful.

1132
01:11:06,558 --> 01:11:08,351
I would never say that!

1133
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:10,311
I would never
say that.

1134
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:12,022
You have to find it.

1135
01:11:12,105 --> 01:11:15,817
It's, like, way back here.

1136
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:16,609
This thing?

1137
01:11:16,693 --> 01:11:19,362
Yeah.

1138
01:11:19,404 --> 01:11:21,531
Make it as tight as possible.

1139
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:28,621
I'm giving the doubled up...

1140
01:11:28,705 --> 01:11:30,373
It's like, here's the single one--

1141
01:11:30,415 --> 01:11:31,499
Not this one.

1142
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,500
Yeah, I know.

1143
01:11:32,584 --> 01:11:33,960
This one.

1144
01:11:34,044 --> 01:11:35,670
You just have to...

1145
01:11:35,754 --> 01:11:37,088
I don't know how
to describe it.

1146
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:38,048
You just...

1147
01:11:38,089 --> 01:11:40,717
I'm doing it.

1148
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,052
Yeah...

1149
01:11:42,093 --> 01:11:44,888
You said, "I'm doin' it."

1150
01:11:44,929 --> 01:11:46,598
I'm doin' it.

1151
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:10,747
OK.

1152
01:12:10,789 --> 01:12:11,706
Looks good.

1153
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:12,832
Thanks.

1154
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:14,918
When is your birthday officially?

1155
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:17,629
My birthday is October 28.

1156
01:12:17,712 --> 01:12:20,423
I just have a dollar,
but I can sign it if you want.

1157
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:22,550
OK. Can you sign it?

1158
01:12:22,634 --> 01:12:24,344
The good thing about that
is I can cash--

1159
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:25,345
well, it is cash.

1160
01:12:25,428 --> 01:12:26,429
I can't cash this.

1161
01:12:26,513 --> 01:12:28,223
This is a totally
erroneous present,

1162
01:12:28,306 --> 01:12:29,516
as far as I'm concerned.

1163
01:12:29,599 --> 01:12:31,518
That's why you should just
smash it over your head.

1164
01:12:31,601 --> 01:12:32,519
But it's not erroneous.

1165
01:12:32,602 --> 01:12:33,561
I like it, though.

1166
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:35,146
That was nice of him
to give it to me.

1167
01:12:35,188 --> 01:12:35,772
Do you want the dollar or not?

1168
01:12:35,855 --> 01:12:38,483
Yeah, I want the dollar.

1169
01:12:38,566 --> 01:12:39,609
Bye.

1170
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:41,111
It was good meeting you.

1171
01:12:41,152 --> 01:12:41,820
I don't know
if I'll see you again.

1172
01:12:41,903 --> 01:12:43,154
We'll do hugs.

1173
01:12:43,238 --> 01:12:45,115
We're doing hugs.

1174
01:12:45,156 --> 01:12:47,117
It was nice meeting you.

1175
01:12:47,158 --> 01:12:48,118
Bye.

1176
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:49,119
All right, guys.

1177
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,870
Have a good night.

1178
01:12:50,954 --> 01:12:53,623
Hey, so you're...

1179
01:12:53,707 --> 01:12:54,624
Oh, no, I'm going to...

1180
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:57,419
Is it...I was going to hang here
for just a couple more minutes.

1181
01:12:57,502 --> 01:12:59,170
That's cool, right?

1182
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:49,591
Carroll Street.

1183
01:15:49,674 --> 01:15:51,259
Transfer for the F train.

1184
01:15:51,343 --> 01:15:54,804
Smith and 9th Streets
next and last stop...
