1
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,363
<i>My dear Charlie,</i>

2
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,149
<i>When you get out...</i>

3
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,993
<i>you're going to feel free as a bird.</i>

4
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,742
<i>There is not much more a man
could want.</i>

5
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,791
<i>Fuck all, I mean,
who would disagree?</i>

6
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,634
<i>I bet you'd love a good meal</i>
<i>for all these years you spent</i>

7
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,674
<i>not able to eat some lobser.</i>

8
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,050
<i>You did right. I...</i>

9
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,928
<i>by letting me help right the
wrong that Chester is doing.</i>

10
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,351
<i>He's the one that needs
to be punished.</i>

11
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,018
<i>To me, it can't get more unfair.</i>

12
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,316
<i>He killed your spirit Charlie.</i>

13
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,484
<i>Take heart though,</i>

14
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,068
<i>his time's up...</i>

15
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,784
<i>I'd place money on it',</i>
<i>if</i> I <i>could.</i>

16
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:53,075
<i>But you have me to
get you started out.</i>

17
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,998
<i>Whatever you're thinking you'll feeling</i>
<i>leaving that cage,</i>

18
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,246
<i>get ready for surprises.</i>

19
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,383
<i>Here it is almost as crazy as there...</i>

20
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,055
<i>Soon you will see yourself, '</i>

21
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,346
<i>but you have me
to get you started out.</i>

22
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,602
<i>Cheers!</i>

23
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,600
<i>The Buddha.</i>

24
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,161
<i>Man don't stand a chance.</i>

25
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,541
<i>In a one sided romance...</i>

26
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,638
<i>Most lovers are tha-a-a-t/.</i>

27
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,680
<i>The rest just lose their minds.</i>

28
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,219
<i>Whoa!</i>

29
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,144
<i>I hear voices...</i>

30
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,813
<i>suss su su su...
whoa-sus sus su...</i>

31
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,815
<i>-suss su su...</i>
<i>-suss su. ...</i>

32
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,780
<i>I<i>hear the foot' tracks...</i>
<i>Ha cha ch ch...</i>

33
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,205
<i>I found the gas. Whoa...</i>

34
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,171
<i>I'm so sad with regret,</i>

35
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,181
<i>'Cause l ain't been happy yet.</i>

36
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,099
<i>And I don't expect to be...</i>

37
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,563
<i>Not in the way love treats me.</i>

38
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,228
<i>I Woahh.</i>

39
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,189
<i>I hear those voices again.</i>

40
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,445
<i>Thirty years I tell you
I need them.</i>

41
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,570
<i>Whoa! Wha su su su.</i>

42
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,871
<i>Why you can even
hear the foot' tracks.</i>

43
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,832
Sir...

44
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,503
a friend told me I might be able to rent
a room here for a night or two.

45
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,133
Really, he must not be
a very good friend,

46
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,422
cause we're all filled up
buddy.

47
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,552
There a guy named
Lorne Corral here?

48
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,843
My friend told me Lorne
would be sure to set it up.

49
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,221
What'd you say
your friends name was?

50
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,855
Billy Pettigrew.

51
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,356
The Buddha sent you here?

52
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:15,403
That's right.

53
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,901
Hey, Troy.

54
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,490
<i>You got a room?
Of course l have a room...</i>

55
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,579
always got a room
for a friend of Buddha's.

56
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,167
Hey, I need a favour,
can you cover here for me.

57
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,209
I reckon I'll be on my way.

58
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,971
<i>Muchas gracias</i>

59
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,427
Sorry.

60
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,979
Listen, entrance for room outside
you got to go through the bar,

61
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,939
out to the left and
around back, okay.

62
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,308
You'll see it.
Okay? Hey listen...

63
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,609
<i>If you need anything,
I mean anything at all.</i>

64
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,943
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

65
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,400
Okay. Thank you.

66
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,001
Hello!

67
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,925
You want to shut the hell up!

68
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,891
Hey!!

69
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,605
Fuck!

70
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,648
<i>No! Calm down and...</i>

71
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,194
<i>Stop it!</i>

72
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,987
<i>In this hell hole Chuck.</i>

73
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,525
God and the Devil
mimic each other.

74
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,578
It's near impossible to
tell them apart.

75
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,953
A smart man...

76
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,956
only wants
someone he can trust.

77
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,090
I thought I had such a friend
but I was deceived.

78
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,424
He stole my money
and took my freedom...

79
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:54,011
but that wasn't half as bad
as what he did to my heart.

80
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,311
If you can't trust another soul
you got nothing.

81
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,693
You're dead.

82
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,736
You do know...

83
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,162
why you're here,
don't you Charlie?

84
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:20,875
I understand.

85
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,797
<i>But why me?</i>

86
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,508
Consider it a favour.

87
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,090
<i>It' is for you.</i>

88
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,337
Not for me.

89
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,727
You talking about this man?

90
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,896
It's the one you want dead...

91
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,524
the one that climbed into
little Charlie's head

92
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,942
and made it his own.

93
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,653
<i>He's still there.</i>

94
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,690
<i>He's still giving the orders.</i>

95
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,321
<i>I can hear him.</i>

96
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,695
<i>Sometimes...</i>

97
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,452
<i>I hear him better than
I hear you.</i>

98
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,461
Good afternoon.

99
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,172
You have good
visit last night?

100
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,095
What do you know about
me having a visitor?

101
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,927
Nothing. I...

102
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,145
"I just figured you" had a long
night with someone.

103
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,105
I mean, it's afternoon.

104
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,686
Why don't you stay out
of my business

105
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,229
and I'll stay out of yours.

106
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,786
Hey, partner.

107
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,663
You want to make a fiver?

108
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,790
What do I have to do for it?

109
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,376
Get a gym bag out of locker 130.

110
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,177
Why don't you get it?

111
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,095
Hey, heY...

112
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,348
Get the bag first, huh.

113
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,141
130.

114
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,621
Hey!

115
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,699
Agh!

116
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,867
Who sent you?

117
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,164
Who gave you the fucking
locker number?

118
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,290
No one did!

119
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,545
Agh!

120
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,084
Agh!

121
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,322
<i>Looking at $189.50.</i>

122
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,595
<i>So how do you find
my new shoes.</i>

123
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,767
<i>You know what they're
saying to me?</i>

124
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,429
<i>They're saying here's nobody is mark.</i>

125
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,682
<i>A guy with his head on his shoulders</i>

126
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,433
<i>an eye to the future.</i>

127
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,856
<i>Somebody who knows how to
take care of business.</i>

128
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,479
<i>Take care of what?</i>

129
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,365
<i>Nice.</i>

130
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,501
What kind of boots are those?

131
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,215
You mean my ventilated
gold diggers?

132
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,638
Save those for
special occasions.

133
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,723
How do you know this one isn't?

134
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,050
Which one?

135
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,559
This one.

136
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,229
I never said it wasn't.

137
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,819
I'm Florence.

138
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,165
The way it works now is you
say what you want me to call you.

139
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,288
Sam.

140
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,127
For Samuel?

141
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,588
For Samson.

142
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,302
Strong guy got
done in by Delilah.

143
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,800
I've never heard that.

144
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,141
You ain't read the Bible?

145
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,773
Mine's the next stop.

146
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,667
Is that Willimette?

147
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,801
Oto, Willimette's a whole
different neighbourhood.

148
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,632
Where you from then?

149
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,885
South a ways.

150
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,012
You ain't giving away
no secrets, are you?

151
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,138
Go ahead.

152
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,141
Ain't that why anybody
talks to strangers?

153
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,277
I figured people got a
lot of reasons to.

154
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,898
Have you got business
in Willimette?

155
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,741
Later I do.

156
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,661
What are you gonna do till then?

157
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,447
Eat something.

158
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,033
There's a pizza joint
right below my place.

159
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:40,162
They only got take out,
but it's pretty good.

160
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,474
My ex left a few things
when he split.

161
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:57,933
0h yeah?

162
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,434
I, I got to keep a clear head, so.

163
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,566
For your mysterious business
in Willimette?

164
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,319
<i>You got anybody Samson?</i>

165
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,163
Like how I ain't got nobody...

166
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,282
except an ex?

167
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,914
I had a dog.

168
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,966
The guy I left it with

169
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,216
when I was in jail said it got run
over by lumber truck.

170
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,554
How long was you in jail for?

171
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,103
Four years.

172
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,482
You smoke weed?

173
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,856
I just told you about that.

174
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,525
Mm, gotta keep a clear head.

175
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,122
<i>Was it a by dog?</i>

176
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,867
It was medium big.

177
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,245
Looked a lot like a
Border Collie...

178
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,005
some Sheppard in it.

179
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,298
Did you treat her good Samson?

180
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,919
Yeah, till I left it with who
I told you about I did.

181
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,887
You think he didn't die
how he said it did?

182
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,015
I think I trusted a good dog

183
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,430
to a son of a bitch who killed it

184
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,929
<i>for the money I sent him
each week to feed it.</i>

185
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:26,313
I loved a cat to death for
six years that died.

186
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:28,903
That's too bad. I'm sorry.

187
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,234
His name was Gold.

188
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,195
On account of his colour.

189
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,117
Do you mind if I smoke Sam?

190
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,285
No.

191
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,327
Your your ex still got a key?

192
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,121
He hasn't used it far as I know.

193
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,586
So no roommate's gonna pop in?

194
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,677
Was us coming here Samson...

195
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,842
was that my idea or yours?

196
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,391
Well, I ain't clear on that either.

197
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,481
You want to watch a movie?

198
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,355
You got one any good?

199
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,153
I got one starring me.

200
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,484
How's that?

201
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,900
As soon <i>as</i> I use the John.

202
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,527
It's over there.

203
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,867
From whom you can hide nothing.

204
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,576
<i>I'm in two minds on this.</i>

205
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,203
<i>Reason I am Samson is,</i>

206
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,001
<i>I've known people and I don't know
whether or not you're one of them</i>

207
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,625
to get the artist mixed
up with their art.

208
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:04,509
<i>They get all sorts of ideas regarding
one from the other.</i>

209
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:08,687
What sort of ones they get?

210
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:09,726
<i>Sister Chastity.</i>

211
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,312
<i>Conclude for example
that's Florence.</i>

212
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,564
It ain't?

213
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,189
<i>Who is she?</i>

214
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,777
<i>Girl named LouAnne.</i>

215
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,615
I'm sorry father, but I have
nothing to confess.

216
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,655
<i>See, I'm Florence,
I'm the actress.</i>

217
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,831
<i>That's somebody else, get it?</i>

218
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:35,507
<i>Each night' I'd lay in bed thinking who</i>
<i>she, and she would come in...</i>

219
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,673
<i>Florence is sort of shy really.</i>

220
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,426
<i>She Iikes to hold hands,
talk, even if it's babble,</i>

221
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,678
do a little blow to cut the ice.

222
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,426
<i>But LouAnne,</i>

223
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,808
<i>wide eyed little LouAnne...</i>

224
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,816
<i>she comes off as all
sweet and innocent at first but,</i>

225
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,527
<i>I'll just say
she ain't no Florence.</i>

226
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,773
Isn't that right father?

227
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,116
<i>Yes, yes!</i>

228
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:06,617
<i>Free yourself of those
nasty habits.</i>

229
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,617
<i>On one hand I'm proud of my
performance.</i>

230
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,585
<i>But on the other hand
LouAnne is so powerful</i>

231
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,299
<i>that after you see
her bigger than life.</i>

232
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,384
<i>What man's gonna want
to know Florence.</i>

233
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,888
A hand holder
with a cat that died.

234
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,178
I never met a movie person
before, but I don't think I'd mix...

235
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,849
one up for the real person.

236
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:36,568
Samson, I think you got
layers, that's what I think.

237
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:42,448
If I put my feet in your lap, will
you rub them good?

238
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,651
Yes?

239
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,343
You hot yet Samson?

240
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,049
Sure I am.

241
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,517
It's gonna be ten o'clock, I gotta
take care of my business.

242
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,275
I aint in no
hurry if you ain't hon.

243
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,984
Do you want
me to take off my clothes,

244
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,778
would that help you
get aroused, huh?

245
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,664
<i>If we could just find
it Samson, I'd see us...</i>

246
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,827
<i>having something really special
together, you know.</i>

247
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,125
<i>Do you see it that way Samson?</i>

248
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,583
Our potential together?

249
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,511
Do you want to fuck me
in the ass?

250
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,438
<i>Hello.</i>

251
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:28,780
<i>Hello?</i>

252
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,623
<i>No! No more.</i>

253
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,491
Agh!

254
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,700
Agh!

255
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,673
Gasps!

256
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,991
No!

257
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:16,415
Agh!

258
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,081
Agh!

259
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,763
Don't fuck...

260
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,898
<i>Get away from me!</i>

261
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,567
<i>Get the fuck away from me!</i>

262
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,813
<i>Whoa!</i>

263
00:36:56,297 --> 00:37:00,473
Samson, I knew you'd recognise the
connection between us.

264
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,495
Mind if I wear these,
my clothes are still drying.

265
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,958
Where'd you find those pants?

266
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,998
Just some drawer,
do you mind or?

267
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:26,915
No.

268
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,859
What happened to you Samson?

269
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,654
You tangle with that lion again?

270
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,991
What Lion? What are
you talking about?

271
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,073
It's where it hurts you most?

272
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,743
Who says anything
hurts me, alright?

273
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,041
Pain's written all over you.

274
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,503
Come here, let me
rub your back.

275
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:17,012
Look, I don't want nothing happening
past what's already happened.

276
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,236
You don't want to be with
me in no kind of way.

277
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,155
Why don't I?

278
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,945
I just ain't.

279
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,618
I ain't a guy you'd end up
liking that's all.

280
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,621
You don't mean that Samson.

281
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,490
You wouldn't have come back
if you didn"t like me

282
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,162
and want me to like you.

283
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,602
<i>There's this rich friend
of mine in prison.</i>

284
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,685
We called him the Buddha.

285
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:20,902
He used to love telling me about all
the fancy dishes he loved to eat.

286
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,527
Shrimp and...

287
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,363
lobster.

288
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,991
He told me when I get out...

289
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,793
that I should find the best damn
restaurant there is...

290
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,708
and I should try some things.

291
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:36,125
You got a right to taste what
other people get to taste.

292
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,969
He write you a check for all that?

293
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,055
I got money.

294
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,550
Are you inviting me to
dinner Samson?

295
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,218
Is that what this is?

296
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,390
Yeah.

297
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,930
And I'll buy you some
new clothes too.

298
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,475
And I am gonna give you a good

299
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,273
barenaked rub.

300
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,562
Look, I don't want you to
rub on me. Alright.

301
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,399
It might go better between us
in that area if

302
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,070
if you let me relax you some.

303
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,989
There's no problem with me
in that area, alright?

304
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,453
Everything's working fine
down there.

305
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:09,245
I ain't worried about it Samson.
I just want you to relax is all.

306
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,742
Just chill.

307
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,869
We have some fun.

308
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,706
I'm gonna buy us a car.

309
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,673
A car?

310
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,463
<i>Yeah, and we're gonna drive</i>
<i>it to the restaurant</i>

311
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,052
where live music is playing.

312
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:24,264
And all the help, they're gonna
wear those black tuxedos.

313
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:27,593
Alright, how about you dress in all black
and I dress in all white?

314
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:28,513
What?

315
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,766
Alright, you wear white and
I'll wear black.

316
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,273
Why? Why? Samson.

317
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,266
Ain't we Looking to make
some noise?

318
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,522
<i>Can we get one with
guts, Samson?</i>

319
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:41,773
<i>With a stick.</i>

320
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,948
Growin' up in the
Oklahoma foster homes,

321
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,113
the next best thing to fucking

322
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,782
was leaning back on
some farm boy's rip-roarer.

323
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,410
Broom! Broom! Broom!

324
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,416
Oh!

325
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,455
Especially if rip roar speeding.

326
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,837
Here's what we could do Samson.

327
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,552
We could use some of your money
to score with huh?

328
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,849
<i>I could be flying.</i>

329
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,764
No.

330
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,775
This is a beauty huh?

331
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,816
Remember that rich
friend I told you about?

332
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:29,238
He made Charlie Rankin see he
born to be something special.

333
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,998
As to keep me in the
nothing that he was.

334
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,666
Who's that?

335
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,248
<i>Who's who? Charlie Rankin.</i>

336
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,210
Just an old con I used to know.

337
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,301
Follow me.

338
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,553
I saw it Samson.

339
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,403
You like that one?

340
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,197
It's way more than I<i>like</i> Samson.

341
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,660
This is the nuts!

342
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,155
Woo! Hey!

343
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,533
<i>What?</i> Where you going?

344
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:15,916
I'm gonna go buy it.

345
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,081
<i>What?</i>

346
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,003
I'm gonna buy it.

347
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,830
That's the one you want right?

348
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,094
You put down your name and
license number too.

349
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,466
No.

350
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,059
It's all hers, it's a gift.

351
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,613
Can't you go any faster?

352
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,997
<i>Come on, seriously!</i>

353
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,379
I'm already going 70.

354
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,757
Don't you want to see what
this baby's got?

355
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,392
Wooo!

356
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:25,236
Wooo! That's it Samson.

357
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:26,946
Woo ho ho!

358
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,918
There's a zoo up ahead
we can go to.

359
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,166
Nah.

360
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,579
You don't like animals?

361
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,839
Mm. Not when they're
locked up in cages.

362
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,629
I don't like that either.

363
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,419
But I still like seeing them.

364
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:51,671
We can go on a picnic.

365
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,140
We can go into the No we ain't goin'
countryside. On no picnic.

366
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,930
We're going to a full blown dinner.

367
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,428
I know we are, but it's still
too early for dinner.

368
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,647
We got the scratch at the
surface anytime we want.

369
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,265
It's the way it works.

370
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,392
Alright! Keep on the expressway

371
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:07,521
<i>it'll take us to the place where all
the fancy eating places are.</i>

372
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,903
What time is it? I mean I ought
to be starved last I ate!

373
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,114
You ain't hungry?

374
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,236
<i>I got a right' to be.</i>

375
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,827
All the shit I ate last four years!

376
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,334
Damn it, what the hell is
goin' on with me?

377
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,001
That's okay Samson.

378
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,249
So we'll just gonna cruise for a while.

379
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,668
Let our appetites build.

380
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,426
I'll be alright.

381
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,378
You ever heard that belief
that when you die,

382
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,675
you come back...

383
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,049
Come back <i>as</i> something else,
llke a rat?

384
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:19,968
You ever heard that?

385
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,102
I wrote a poem about it.

386
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,227
I Remember You
from the Tree Tops.

387
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,310
You figure it happens
that way then, huh?

388
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,570
My poem's the
only place I can't lie.

389
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,194
Everything I feel
believes in him.

390
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,987
Do you believe in it?

391
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,902
Like to but...

392
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,492
just afraid it's all bullshit.

393
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:41,830
<i>What if it is?</i>

394
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,158
Still doesn't hurt for you
to believe.

395
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,958
It sure would if I killed myself
to turn into something better.

396
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,582
Instead found myself
in eternal hell it would.

397
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,917
That's the saddest thought ever.

398
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,010
What are you doing?

399
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,170
I'm changing.

400
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:57,429
What into?

401
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,799
I don't know, not sure,
something cool.

402
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:01,801
What happened?

403
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,263
I got bit.

404
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:06,640
What happened to you?

405
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:08,558
What, here?

406
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:09,775
Can't you see it?

407
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,978
Well that's too bad.

408
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,276
Yeah.

409
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,120
Mm.

410
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,190
You see that Samson?

411
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,471
<i>Hey</i>

412
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,347
Hey.

413
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,849
You see that?

414
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,770
You want to go inside
and see it?

415
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,766
No.

416
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:15,606
Why you don't like churches?

417
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:17,441
Well, you go.

418
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,529
I can tell what it is here
and you talk, huh?

419
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,526
No. That ain't the same Samson.

420
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,654
Come on, I don't want
to go alone.

421
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,313
Do you believe you
have a soul Samson?

422
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,606
I don't know if I do.

423
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,856
You do.

424
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,200
You do. And it's a good one.

425
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,154
It just ain't old like mine.

426
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,916
What proof you got of him?

427
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:14,414
I<i>feel him.</i>

428
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,791
Just like I feel you're
a good soul.

429
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,544
Yeah, what's that feel like?

430
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,339
Let him put
some of it into you.

431
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:25,880
Talk to him.

432
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:27,097
About what?

433
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,638
<i>Tell him how you ain't
got no appetite,</i>

434
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:30,930
<i>your stomach hurts,</i>

435
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,562
<i>and ask him to make it
stop hurting.</i>

436
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:45,533
All my life I...

437
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:50,037
from what I can remember of it,
I'd be dreaming,

438
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,494
about hurting and killing
the people that hurt me.

439
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,334
When I was younger
that made me feel better until

440
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:04,335
I'd wake up
and they were all still alive.

441
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,596
Those dreams were my secret.

442
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,301
I told the Buddha about them.

443
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:16,393
Tell God it ain't your dreams
making your belly sick.

444
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,099
Could have come across
Tell him you don't know how you

445
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:20,693
holding the
money that you are...

446
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,526
and the cuts on
your arms and face.

447
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,566
What do you know about me?

448
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:32,909
Just that your soul is in
so much pain Samson.

449
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,160
No, I asked him.

450
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,502
I asked im for help when I
needed him when I was younger.

451
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:43,632
He gave me nothing.

452
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:48,588
He don't always answer you Samson,
how and when you think he will.

453
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,185
I ain't going in anymore
fucking churches.

454
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:00,558
It's you driving us.

455
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,310
I'm just waiting for
you to feel better

456
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,277
so you pan take
me to dinner Samson.

457
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,025
And to make love to me

458
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:08,199
just a little bit longer
than you did earlier.

459
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,224
<i>The scars on your back.</i>

460
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:41,307
<i>Are they're your dream too?</i>

461
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,008
I gotta see someone in there.

462
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:18,101
Mos?

463
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,679
You know him?

464
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,973
You spend time in
that shit hole?

465
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:27,319
Back when I was young.

466
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:31,858
Hasn't everyone had a
"Mos" phase growing up, huh?

467
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,200
Jeez.

468
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:35,661
I<i>hope not.</i>

469
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,827
<i>It's a wonder to me you
lived this long...</i>

470
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,287
<i>reckless way you go about it.</i>

471
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,123
I'd certainly not live at all
than live like you do Samson.

472
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,045
Not trusting a soul.

473
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,798
Not even the one inside you.

474
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,594
Yeah.

475
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,722
You know a guy named
Lorne Corral?

476
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:09,232
Did he get you into this
business of last night?

477
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,731
Can't say.

478
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,440
I'll be back.

479
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,411
Don't be gone long.

480
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,128
Hey!

481
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:36,440
You lose something?

482
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,847
You want to tell me...

483
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,728
what went wrong last night?

484
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,689
Who told you that?

485
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,569
You did.

486
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,119
You know what they say?

487
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:25,990
Eyes are the windows
to the soul.

488
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:30,286
You gotta learn
how to draw your curtains.

489
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,886
There was someone else there.

490
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,005
There was a woman there.

491
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,052
His wife?

492
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,050
No, some blonde.

493
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:46,184
And?

494
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:49,934
And I tied her up.

495
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:51,189
She wasn't going nowhere.

496
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,478
Charlie.

497
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,360
She didn't see me, alright,
I was wearing a mask.

498
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:56,524
It's fine.

499
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,824
There are other ways
to tell who you are.

500
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:10,124
What do you want me to do now?

501
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,039
Kill that voice.

502
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,302
Just do it.

503
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:49,657
<i>Hey there Samson.</i>

504
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,334
Everything okay?

505
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:55,955
Yeah, let's go.

506
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,152
Samson.

507
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:28,616
Mm?

508
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,906
Bridge is clear.

509
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:40,674
Take a left up here.

510
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:41,667
What for?

511
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,796
There's a bar, we can
kill some time at.

512
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,307
Till you get your appetite back.

513
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,917
You're <i>as</i> pale as a ghost.

514
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,005
You have to eat
something Samson.

515
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,276
Barman.

516
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:43,899
One more.

517
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,047
I gotta go somewhere.

518
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:11,807
I'll be back.

519
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,259
It was nice knowing you.

520
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,019
I said I'll be back.

521
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,346
Sure.

522
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:44,381
<i>49/11!</i>

523
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:13,611
<i>I thought you said you
were leaving?</i>

524
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,079
One more.

525
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:25,338
<i>Use the door.</i>

526
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,923
Time for us to go.

527
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,760
It's "us" now huh?

528
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,350
We can drink somewhere else.

529
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,812
Why don't you cool it man?

530
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,101
Hey, did you hear me?

531
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:47,610
Coming?

532
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:47,921
<i>If you ever think about me...</i>

533
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:54,629
<i>If I ever cross your mind.</i>

534
01:01:56,588 --> 01:02:02,812
<i>Girl, Girl, If you ever think about me...</i>

535
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:09,276
<i>If I ever cross your mind.</i>

536
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,698
<i>Well you know</i>

537
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,858
<i>you know I'm yours.</i>

538
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,445
<i>Friend I know,</i>

539
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,618
<i>I know you're mine.</i>

540
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:29,789
I never have much liked a woman
before, anybody.

541
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,882
Sure do you like you though,
Florence.

542
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,922
Tell me something I don't know.

543
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:43,847
Charlie Rankin...

544
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,397
some old timer I told you about.

545
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,103
Charlie Rankin?

546
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:54,984
He wasn't shit until the Buddha
took an interest in him.

547
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,066
Buddha got him talking again...

548
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,902
made Charlie who he is.

549
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,575
He saved Charlie's life?

550
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:15,964
Why would the cops know to come
looking for you in this car?

551
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:17,502
What?

552
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,221
Unless you done something the cops
might want to talk to you about.

553
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:29,457
You got it all wrong about what's
gonna happen in this life.

554
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:32,119
<i>I don't got a crystal ball Samson.</i>

555
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,170
I don't see the future,

556
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,914
all I see is you so
twisted up inside

557
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,916
and me taking a chance on you.

558
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:43,471
Well I aim to live
as long as I can.

559
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,428
It's good you're back
to wanting to.

560
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,974
What I gotta do to live ain't what
most people gotta do.

561
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:52,848
You talking a
bout being the finger

562
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,774
at the end of
Buddha's long arm?

563
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:05,944
Can't take his money
and just walk away.

564
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:08,075
Is that what you did?

565
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:13,376
<i>Is that What this ride
and this belly ache is all about?</i>

566
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:11,009
No peeking.

567
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:37,710
Fuck Charlie, come on man.

568
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:56,767
Do I rev you up more this way?

569
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,188
What the fuck?

570
01:06:58,473 --> 01:06:59,565
What are you doing?

571
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,062
What's wrong Samson?

572
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:05,651
You don't like it?

573
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:07,615
My God...

574
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:09,818
you're burning up.

575
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,245
Poison me or something?

576
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,492
What'd you do?

577
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,083
The bad is bottled up
in you Samson,

578
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,497
its poisoned you.

579
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:20,586
I knew this was coming.

580
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,334
Florence?

581
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,090
What are you doin?

582
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:26,084
I keep trying to warn you
stay away from me.

583
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,256
I can feel in your skin

584
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:29,425
what a beautiful baby you were.

585
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,014
I keep trying to warn you.

586
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:32,636
About what?

587
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,471
About who I am.

588
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,519
I know who you are.

589
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:39,230
I wouldn't be here if I didn't
know who you are Samson.

590
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:40,098
Yeah, you don't.

591
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:41,850
I'm Charlie.

592
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,608
And I'm Florence.

593
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,906
I'm Florence.

594
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:52,285
I know who you are.

595
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,366
But I came here to kill
someone.

596
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,458
Who did you come here to kill'?

597
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:01,418
Huh?

598
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:05,214
It don't matter who.
It does matter.

599
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,628
It don't fuckin' matter.

600
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,342
It will to whoever you do it to.

601
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:11,133
It'll make you sicker
and sicker.

602
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,382
I don't feel good.

603
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,634
Come here.

604
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,010
Let me just hold you.

605
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:21,059
You hold me. Charlie.

606
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:25,272
My baby.

607
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:32,658
Who are you?

608
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:34,156
Jesus!

609
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,538
Keep fucking doing this to me!

610
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:38,994
Where'd you get this hair, huh?

611
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,662
Where'd you get that, huh?

612
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:44,379
You tell me who you are.
I'm tired of this shit.

613
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:45,667
You tell me now!

614
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,466
Are you her? Are you Florence?

615
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:51,465
Are you?

616
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:53,512
Who are you?

617
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:55,556
Are you real?

618
01:08:57,634 --> 01:09:00,478
Get inside me and feel better.

619
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:03,814
I don't want to
be like this anymore.

620
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:08,778
Get inside me.

621
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:16,012
I can tell by watching you sleep

622
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:19,929
you go to a
scary place Charlie.

623
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:26,348
Do you know where that is?

624
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,650
You look some better anyway.

625
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:38,906
And I love you no matter.

626
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:46,993
You love me?

627
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:50,295
Huh?

628
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:54,926
I don't think I'm made
for that Florence.

629
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,644
Everyone is.

630
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:14,153
You just get somebody to
teach you.

631
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:20,152
You think I can forget about what I...

632
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:22,911
what I dealt with growing up.

633
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,202
Well you're wrong.

634
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:28,000
You're wrong.

635
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:33,415
You talking about Chester?

636
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,927
How do you know about him?

637
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:42,925
Only about the battle you spoke
of in your sleep.

638
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,969
That was the nonsense
of a dream.

639
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,608
The scars on your back...

640
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:55,694
they your dream too?

641
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,451
I'm gonna go to the next town.

642
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:04,112
I'm gonna drop you there.

643
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,619
No you won't.

644
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:14,001
I think I know why you're here
more than you do Charlie.

645
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,518
Are you scared?

646
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,028
Just follow
your instincts Charlie.

647
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:30,160
They'll take you
to the right place

648
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:31,908
and make you do
the right thing.

649
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:33,220
Do you want me to
come with you?

650
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,516
No.

651
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:44,356
Should I come to the
door with you?

652
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:47,150
Will that make it easier?

653
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:01,547
This state ain't got the
death penalty Charlie.

654
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:07,383
I read that in the newspaper.

655
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,628
I'm going to do your
feet here, alright.

656
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:44,757
When you're out there,
walking just listen okay?

657
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:48,840
Just trust.

658
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:51,301
Just trust what you hear.

659
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:52,966
I think I might just dream it.

660
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:54,387
No don't dream.

661
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:55,930
Dreams don't matter.

662
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:58,726
This matters.

663
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:01,682
Right here.

664
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,309
Right now.

665
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:10,112
Put your hands
behind your back.

666
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,241
Lean forward.

667
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,873
Was me who wanted to
come with you,

668
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:24,083
Why would I leave you?

669
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:38,932
Don't be scared Florence.

670
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,480
Don't you be Charlie.

671
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:13,924
Are you the police?

672
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:29,227
Did you see him?

673
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:33,978
He killed him in front of me.

674
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:36,814
I tried to stop him.

675
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:39,950
He was too strong.

676
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:43,988
I'll be right back.

677
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:02,924
Some water.

678
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:06,719
Some Aspirin for your pain.

679
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,767
You're a doctor?

680
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:14,359
No.

681
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:15,860
I could call one?

682
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:19,615
I don't feel good.

683
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:26,664
Those scars?

684
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:28,832
How did you get the scars?

685
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:30,667
What scars?

686
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:32,536
On your hand.

687
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:35,873
That's all long time ago.

688
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:38,459
I was just a kid.

689
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,762
There were scars...

690
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:47,009
he.

691
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:44,241
You got the courage?

692
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:52,830
Compassion paves the way
to the gas chamber Charlie.

693
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:57,621
I aint gonna do it.

694
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:01,583
Then get out of my way.

695
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:05,800
Um.

696
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:17,099
Agh!

697
01:23:51,902 --> 01:23:53,279
What happened?

698
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:55,205
I found somethin'.

699
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:58,868
In there?

700
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:03,213
In... inside.

701
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:11,464
You believe me?

702
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:14,098
<i>Huh?</i>

703
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:19,980
<i>So quiet.</i>

704
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,403
It's...

705
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:28,480
It's quiet.

706
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:39,999
Cry for me.

707
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:52,550
I love you somethin' Charlie.

708
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:55,883
Flo.

709
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:01,729
So.
