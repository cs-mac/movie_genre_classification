<i>[Episode 38]</i>

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,000
Who is Chang Jianxiong?

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If you tell him, he doesn't get it.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,230
If you don't, he is even more clueless.

27
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,000
<i>His acuity when it comes to relationship is really one where he would neither listen to reason nor bow to force.</i>

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
<i>He is the classical model of an egg without any cracks.</i>

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,600
Do you still want your salary and bonus?

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,800
I can't communicate with people like you who don't understand women.

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,000
Looks like the greatest enemy to a woman

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,200
is not aging or a sixteen year old girl.

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,200
It's the brain of a straight man.

34
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,400
Qiao, can I go after Chang Jianxiong?

35
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,600
Chang Jianxiong doesn't belong to me. You shouldn't be asking me this.

36
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
- You should ask... 
- Who?

37
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,300
Yourself.

38
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Shi Yue, you are using the guitar pretending to be Casanova again.

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,300
Thinking about when we were in training camp, you gave the female instructor...

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,600
It's a birthday cake. You need to eat it while it's hot.

41
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,900
It's bad for your health when it's cold.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,800
<i>Do you still remember what you said to the female instructor to cause me to run five kilometers less?</i>

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,200
What female instructor?

44
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,200
- I didn't. I know that every night, you were with... 
- What female instructor?

45
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,400
No, you are my female instructor.

46
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,200
<i>This alcohol's after effects are pretty strong.</i>

47
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,400
Why did you drink so much?

48
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,900
You can't puke here.

49
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,700
I can't take it anymore. I'm dizzy.

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,800
Why are you here?

51
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,200
Aunt.

52
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,700
What are you doing? You...

53
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,980
Dad, what brings you here?

54
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,420
My daughter's home is small. Raising dogs

55
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,510
it'll make them too grumpy.

56
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,500
It's also not convenient for anyone to live here too.

57
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,380
It so happens that I have a big house.

58
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,210
Let's do this. I will take care of them for you for a few days.

59
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,900
What are the names of your dogs?

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,900
This is Eldest, Second, and Third.

61
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,300
Come, Eldest. Get up.

62
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,900
<i>Let's go.</i>

63
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,680
<i>Give that to me.</i>

64
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,990
Grandpa. They haven't agreed yet and you are taking the dogs along with you.

65
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,300
This is not what I meant.

66
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,600
They have ready-made meals here. They haven't finished eating yet. Let's leave after the meal.

67
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,900
His cooking skill is really not bad.

68
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,100
When did you had it?

69
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,500
Why do you raise German Shepherds?

70
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,400
A military dog with lasting affection.

71
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,220
I will open the door for you.

72
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,200
- Be good. 
- Let's go.

73
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,400
<i>Over here.</i>

74
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,000
<i>Let's go.</i>

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,600
What should we do?

76
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,400
Are you worried about the dogs?

77
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,100
I'm worried about you.

78
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,200
What are you worried about?

79
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,100
Once my father extended his hand, there will definitely be no way out.

80
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,590
Why do I feel that your father is an extremely loyal person?

81
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,000
The first time we met, he took our dogs along with him.

82
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,200
I feel that, in the future, there wouldn't be any barriers in our communication.

83
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,800
We can also be good friends.

84
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,400
So thick skinned. Just wait and see.

85
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,600
- Just wait and see. 
- You think that I'm a bit like your father.

86
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,800
What?

87
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,500
I'm a bit like your father.

88
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,000
It was clearly supposed to be mars colliding with earth kind of fighting event.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,400
How come it became a heart-warming Chinese opera of finding joy in helping others?

90
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,600
Grandpa, are you afraid?

91
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
You don't understand. We are here today

92
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,300
not to protest. It's intimidation.

93
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,800
What's the difference?

94
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,800
A show of force relies on fists.

95
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,900
Intimidation relies on wisdom to advance.

96
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,200
To add further, your Aunt was there.

97
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,400
Even if I ask questions, he will give you false answers.

98
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,400
You are really an expert. So, these dogs are actually human hostages?

99
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,000
No, they are dog hostages.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,300
That's right, dog hostages. Let's go.

101
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,900
Director Wen.

102
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,600
Sister Wen Di, you are not loyal.

103
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,000
Yesterday was CEO Shi's birthday. Why didn't you take me along with you?

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,900
He has a host with him. Why would you go there?

105
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,800
There were many good men in Lucid Dream who had hosts too?

106
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,000
No, there were just the four of us.

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,300
Does Brother Chang has a host too?

108
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,200
If Chang Jianxiong were to have a relationship with a woman,

109
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,600
all the sows will be able to climb trees too.

110
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,000
Zhen Hao told me that the best method in love is to take advantage of the situation.

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,500
It's the best opportunity for Brother Chang who is single and lonely now.

112
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,600
I say, this Chang Jianxiong,

113
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,100
is not only stupid. During critical times, he becomes a loser.

114
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,200
He distinctly has muscles.

115
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,400
The more muscles a person has, the smaller his brain is.

116
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,700
The time, place and environment was perfect last night...

117
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,000
Last night? Both of you were in a situation?

118
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,800
What happened? Tell me.

119
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,000
Xiao An, I'm warning you. Don't ever be deceived by men's outer appearances.

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But not only does he has a good outer appearance, he has a good father too.

121
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,800
What's the relationship?

122
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,200
Who knows? His good father may become his weakness.

123
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,400
When there is money, there is less affections. When there is power, there is less loyalty.

124
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,600
What's so great about rich heirs?

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,200
Are things going smoothly on your end?

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I think there seems to be some problems here.

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,800
Listen to me.  I'm here...

128
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,800
I'll call you later.

129
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,200
Sorry. Please wait for a moment.

130
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,700
Is Chang Jianxiong really that bad?

131
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,000
You are...

132
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,820
I'm the Chang Jianxiong's weakness that you were referring to.

133
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,500
Yes, his good father.

134
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,000
Uncle, I wasn't talking bad about you just now.

135
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,800
Yes, I did talk bad about Chang Jianxiong just now.

136
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,900
But you should also know that...

137
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,500
sometimes when one likes that person, she would say...

138
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,800
Don't panic.

139
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,500
I'm on your side.

140
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,620
Do you know that Chang Jianxiong's father took the initiative to visit me?

141
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,000
Why did he look for you?

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The both of you are not even together yet and the elder of the family has jumped out to oppose it?

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,600
Daddy Chang is an assistant that will help me fulfill the impossible.

144
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,800
His style is totally different from your Chief in the family.

145
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,200
Moreover, do you know?

146
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,600
He even volunteered to be my planted agent and

147
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,900
asked me to get his foolish son as soon as possible.

148
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,570
I envy you.

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,400
How are things going at your end?

150
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,500
After your father took away his dogs, have there been any new movements?

151
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,400
None at all.

152
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,200
It has been a few days and there were no movements at all. It's too scary.

153
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,200
I think this is definitely the first step for a son-in-law by the old people.

154
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,000
No, you don't know my father.

155
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,900
I think this is the calm before the storm.

156
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,790
On my end, everything is ready. It's only short of Chang Jianxiong.

157
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,000
On your end, both of you are willing. It's just that there is a father who comes in-between.

158
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,000
Look at how carefree Hao Jie and Ouyang Qi's lives are.

159
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
They have been away for fun for a long time and still not back yet.

160
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,400
Should I learn from Hao Jie and be tyrannical?

161
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,400
I will give you my support.

162
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,500
With someone like Chang Jianxiong who is so slow-paced, you should use strong tactics.

163
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,100
Dad?

164
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,000
I see.

165
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,800
What's going on?

166
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,000
My father wants to see Shi Yue.

167
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,800
This is a good thing. Your father has taken the initiative to attack.

168
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,000
What do you plan to do?

169
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,600
I can't be tyrannical anymore.

170
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,600
I... I should try to outwit him instead.

171
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,480
You've already delivered dog food for three days.

172
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,370
But, you were unable to scout out any signs of activity.

173
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,650
What are you doing?

174
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,410
I just came back from Uncle Nan's house yesterday.

175
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,690
How did it go?

176
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,010
I have never seen Uncle Nan in such a tight predicament.

177
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,300
He chased your three dogs around the entire yard.

178
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,340
His entire life of military training was defeated at the hands of your dogs.

179
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,920
This isn't some good omen.

180
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,500
That is too perfect. I only need three dogs

181
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,260
to test out my father-in-law's true feelings towards me.

182
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,650
What the heck? Do you know how much misfortune your three dogs have brought onto the Nan Family?

183
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,950
So much misfortune,

184
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,840
yet he still has not returned the dogs to me.  Do you know what this means?

185
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,100
Returning grudges with kindness?

186
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,550
Love me, love my dog. Even my dogs could enter and garrison.

187
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,150
How hard could it be for a human?

188
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,300
You are too naive.

189
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,350
I can now confirm this little bit.

190
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,470
The dogs have already entered the house. How far can you be?

191
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:32,980
Of course... Our first meeting was plainly unexpected.

192
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,490
But do you know that being unexpected has its advantage.

193
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,760
This is giving both of us some space, some time.

194
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,500
Letting us have some mental preparation on our second meeting.

195
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,450
What's the result of your first testing?

196
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,390
Very good. I really like this old man.

197
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,530
Kind. A good person.

198
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,460
I actually feel that he's quite like me, isn't it?

199
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,440
Then...I wish you good luck.

200
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,250
- Don't worry. It will surely be fine.
- I'm going now.

201
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,490
Hey! Hey... Wait! Wait!

202
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,940
Oh, right. I still have to give you an advice.

203
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,040
Better prepare yourself well.

204
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,390
No... She texted me earlier...

205
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,350
How come he suddenly wants to see me. Did some major thing happened?

206
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,040
Aren't you constantly been thinking of how to get my father?

207
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,810
But I still am not mentally prepared now.

208
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,980
- I hope that we can...
- My father hates people who run away midway the most.

209
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,900
He is actually easy to amuse.

210
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,820
He kept saying that...

211
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:00,210
Men should be bold and frank and not one that keeps bowing low to others.

212
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,960
Continue saying. Give me more suggestions.

213
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,050
He likes my brother-in-law a lot. Why is that?

214
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,190
Oh, my brother-in-law submit to his commander. Easy, right?

215
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,650
What did your brother-in-law wear during their first meeting then?

216
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,780
I've also called my sister about that.

217
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,330
Won't this be too hot?

218
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,250
It surely will work. Fighting! Go change your clothes.

219
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,620
What if I perspire in front of your father?

220
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,430
I'll help wipe it for you.

221
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,790
Let's drink.

222
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,440
Dad.

223
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,890
- Uncle Chang, you're here too.
- Oh, you're here.

224
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,700
Uncle.

225
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,550
I brought you some gifts. Are my dogs obedient?

226
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,980
We see each other again.

227
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,240
Do you know how to play 'shuang sheng (double lift)'?

228
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,620
A little bit.

229
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,220
Let's go.

230
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,770
Let's go!

231
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,760
A little bit? You have the nerve to say 'a little bit'?

232
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,900
Old Chang.

233
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,760
- You sit there.
- Okay.

234
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,640
- You sit in front of me.
- Okay.

235
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,590
There's no use sitting by his side. I'll still scold him if he plays the wrong cards.

236
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,840
You were in a hurry to tell us to come here just to play cards with you?

237
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,400
A person observing a card game shouldn't talk. That's the rule.

238
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,190
Jianxiong, deal the cards.

239
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,760
Okay!

240
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,930
Blood is thicker than water. Tacit understanding.

241
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,820
Hey, with your speed, it doesn't look good for you two.

242
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,520
Royal Flush

243
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,850
Just get from the deck.

244
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,890
We have tacit understanding.

245
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,270
Don't you know to help me?

246
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,990
Old Chang,

247
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,840
it is the one laughing in the end that's considered the victor.

248
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,360
Jeez, just move faster.

249
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,990
How did you know that my father has 2 Kings?

250
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:38,070
Although the face of your father earlier was so tensed (poker face),

251
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,560
you didn't see that his eyes were shining.

252
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,060
How then did you know that he needs diamonds?

253
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,010
This is based on the pattern that he takes his card.

254
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:55,750
From lower to top, the order was always spade, club, and diamond.

255
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:01,290
In this round, it takes him the longest to get a diamond card. That's why, I gave him a diamond.

256
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,720
Do you know what this is called?

257
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,370
What?

258
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:13,610
Intelligence can change our lives. Details can get you your father-in-law.

259
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,930
You think that you've passed his test already, is that it?

260
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,790
Not only passed, I've completely won him over.

261
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,030
You didn't pay attention to how he looked at me.

262
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,620
One eye is doting.

263
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,690
The other eye is liking.

264
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,060
But do you know what if it's both eyes?

265
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,330
Love.

266
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,430
Since I did so well, shouldn't you give me some reward?

267
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,280
Just focus on driving. You kept talking.

268
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,060
Stop sulking alone.

269
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,010
Look at you. You now have a grandchild and a joyous and harmonious family.

270
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,060
Look at me. Look at my stupid son.

271
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,300
No career achievement. No marriage.

272
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,360
And kept mixing in with those two.

273
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,060
I really don't know what his brain is thinking.

274
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,670
You're just sitting here and awaiting death.

275
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:31,620
Even if you develop hypertension, it won't solve the problem.

276
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,360
If you continue saying it, I indeed will get sick from anger already.

277
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,130
Hey, you should learn from me. Attacking proactively.

278
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,670
How?

279
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:44,390
Catch his key point. Attack his weakness. Test him.

280
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,860
What you did is called testing?

281
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,900
You clearly gave that lad a position in your family.

282
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,730
In looking for a son-in-law, I only have one requirement.

283
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,740
What?

284
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,800
Knows how to play cards.

285
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:08,000
Hey, didn't you say you're going to invite those old guys over?

286
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:13,960
Attack him until not a single armor remains.

287
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,060
<i>[Future Up]</i>

288
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,800
- Look, here.
- Director Wen.

289
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,770
The development of our electronic speed regulator has almost

290
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,560
reached the previous estimate.

291
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,430
The flight panel will also be 80% complete by this week.

292
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,840
Old Qin, what about yours?

293
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,090
The design proposals for the brushless motor and propellers have been submitted to the factory.

294
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:48,000
They said that deliver the sample product, at the latest, by Friday.

295
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,920
Not bad. Based on our progress rate, Hunter can soon start production.

296
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,550
With us working this hard,

297
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:57,190
should we not worry about our year-end bonus already?

298
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,520
Year-end bonus...

299
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,800
Let me award you a little gold medal first. It has an inspiring nature.

300
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,020
Only mental reward?

301
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,970
Isn't health the most precious material award?

302
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,050
What time is it already?

303
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,580
Beijing time...

304
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,190
11 sharp.

305
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,520
<i>How come Xiao Qiao is not yet here?</i>

306
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,530
Miss me already?

307
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,260
The timely rain is here.

308
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,880
Come...it's time for you to relieve me from my shift.

309
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,790
Now that you're here, I can go out and resolve some personal problem.

310
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:34,030
What personal problem? If it's marriage-related, I'll let you go.

311
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,220
It's marriage matters concerning Chang Jianxiong.

312
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,900
Hurry and go. Don't rush to come back.

313
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,860
Boss, let me report my work to you.

314
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,000
Boss, see mine first!

315
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,360
<i>Look.</i>

316
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,850
Uncle Chang.

317
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,050
Xiao Wen, hurry and sit down.

318
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:18,220
Wow! You have ordered so many food.

319
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:22,430
Look and tell me what you think of my strategy.

320
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,860
Is there anything special about these?

321
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,490
There is.

322
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,650
This is about my son.

323
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,310
This is a strategy on how to get my son.

324
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,430
Look at this steak.

325
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:44,090
80% cooked. It's just like the relationship between you two.

326
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,680
You two are very familiar with each other already. But if you want it to progress further,

327
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,020
you still lack 20%.

328
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,400
What you mean is the timing isn't right?

329
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,800
A 80% cooked steak has the best flavor.

330
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:05,360
Now is the best time to gobble it up with one move and it's a chance that must not be missed.

331
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,830
But if you are to wait for it to be 100% cooked

332
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,650
before turning from friends to lovers...

333
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,280
it will be too late.

334
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,070
Look at this plate next.

335
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,180
This is the breakout point in making my son yield to you.

336
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,140
Macaroni?

337
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,990
He likes to eat that?

338
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,690
His heart is empty.

339
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:40,050
But before, he was like this.

340
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,420
Have a one-track mind.

341
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,160
Because that time, his heart only has Nan Qiao.

342
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,840
But don't worry. Based on my observations,

343
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,670
he has now completely put down his thoughts on being Nan Qiao.

344
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,780
Right now, whoever is able to fill up his empty heart,

345
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,710
she'll then be able to eat him.

346
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,650
This person is you, Wen Di.

347
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,380
I understand now.

348
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,920
For the meantime, I should give him more warmth and show up more.

349
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,810
Let his eyes have only me.

350
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:29,680
Slowly, his eyes wiill also have only me.

351
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,980
Get him return to this very fine and long Italian spaghetti.

352
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,410
Being a tactician to an intelligent person is really fun.

353
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,650
Uncle Chang, what strategy does this salad represents?

354
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,950
This...

355
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:59,120
I understand already. What you mean is to make Chang Jianxiong jealous.

356
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,090
Right. Right.

357
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,840
That is indeed what I want to say.

358
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,730
If he gets jealous because of you,

359
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,690
doesn't that mean he cares about you?

360
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,190
If he even made some moves, we can be sure

361
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,600
that he likes you already.

362
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:25,940
We've set the strategy. How then are we going to do the deployment for this operation?

363
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,090
Don't worry about that. Don't forget that I'm exactly in the PR field.

364
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,280
Just wait to see how I

365
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,360
catch Jianxiong while he's inside the jar. (confident to catch him)

366
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,390
Okay. I'll have one advice.

367
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:39,330
You must not hold back.

368
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,030
Come.

369
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:48,420
Yogurt drink paired with Wester cuisine, what strategy is this?

370
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,180
Looking to be in disharmony, but they actually are very compatible.

371
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:57,100
This is like you and Chang Jianxiong.

372
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,600
I like this mix and match.

373
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,990
Welcome!

374
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,370
Take a look.

375
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,800
Thanks.

376
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,550
Hey. What do you think about this?

377
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,670
It doesn't seem to be your style.

378
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:02,310
Is changing my style not good?

379
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,040
What about this?

380
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,610
This is indeed your style.

381
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,160
But the white pants are too large. Not good.

382
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,470
- Drink some juice.
- Thanks.

383
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,910
We have a few dresses in our shop that fits your aura.

384
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,370
Wait a minute. I'll look for it.

385
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,540
Your service here is quite thorough.

386
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,030
I have guessed that you must like drinking juices for your skin is so good.

387
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,440
It's penetratingly rosy and bright.

388
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,590
Look. This dress really fits your figure.

389
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:53,340
It is indeed quite beautiful, but...it seems to be too long. Quite inconvenient.

390
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,460
If you wear this dress, you'll be like a princess.

391
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,190
Any man who sees you wearing this will not bear to let you work anymore.

392
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,800
Hey. What do you think?

393
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,080
I don't know.

394
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,940
- I'll look at others first. 
- Okay.

395
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,750
This one was totally created for you.

396
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,120
Only your figure can carry this.

397
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,760
We have a dressing room here. Do you want to try this on?

398
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,550
It suits you so perfectly.

399
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,670
How about it?

400
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,850
This dress indeed suits you very well.

401
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,290
But the back is too revealing. It's easy to catch a cold.

402
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,530
It's also good this way.

403
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,260
Go out then.

404
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,790
Go out.

405
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,310
I'll pay with my card.

406
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,880
This way please.

407
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,010
Thanks.

408
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,950
I really feel that this dress suits you very well, that's why, I gifted it to you.

409
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,150
But covering up a dress with such good design,

410
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,060
do you understand aesthetics?

411
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,360
Of course, I do.

412
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,970
We've already understand your abilities and experiences.

413
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,070
Do you still have other questions?

414
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,720
It's okay already.

415
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,990
Then, let's end here for today. We'll inform you once we have a decision. Thanks.

416
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,440
Thanks.

417
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Oh, my.

418
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,130
There is one more person who submitted his resume online. He's here.

419
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,740
<i>[Jerry Hao  (Hao Jie)]</i>

420
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,050
Hi.

421
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,130
Why are you imitating them and making trouble here?

422
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,880
Since you two are already in the middle of a job interview,

423
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,460
then interview me too in passing.

424
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,070
I'll leave this one to you.

425
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,080
Bye-bye.

426
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,910
Did you have fun?

427
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:07,160
My name is Hao Jie. Just like my name, I have good looks (hao kan) and an outstanding (jie chu) brain.

428
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,060
You're so annoying. Come then. Height, weight, age.

429
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:16,180
Just right to be grouped, to protect, and to pester Ouyang Qi.

430
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:22,100
This job that you're applying into is not something that I can give.

431
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,580
Nan Qiao, say some fair words with me. I have a fine body, right?

432
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,400
In terms of looks, I can pass, right? For intelligence, let's not even talk about it anymore.

433
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,150
Just casually placing me in the marriage market and I'll be a hot product.

434
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:40,110
How come when it comes to Ouyang Qi, I've become a defective good?

435
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,100
I've also courted a lot of girls before.

436
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,240
But how come I just can't pick up this tyrannical flower?

437
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,140
Why?

438
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:54,350
Because...looks, body, and brain are not the basic requirement

439
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,200
in this job that you're applying into.

440
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,860
If you want to apply as Ouyang Qi's fiancé, you actually just need to do well on

441
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,090
preparing to never leave her.

442
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,330
I'm already ready to be with her forever.

443
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,970
I even proposed marriage to her...

444
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,250
You proposed already?

445
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,480
Did she accept it?

446
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,500
Of course not. She actually feels that only a trained dog

447
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,350
is suitable to find a lifetime partner.

448
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,130
A high level animal like humans

449
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,390
is best to just live alone.

450
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:28,770
After living for so long, I can't even compare to a dog.

451
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,740
She totally have rejected me.

452
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,900
She actually isn't rejecting you.

453
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,550
I can see that you really like Ouyang Qi.

454
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:45,670
I also hope that she can quickly go back to living her life.

455
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,290
I feel that Xiao Qi does like you.

456
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:54,660
She might just not know how to put down Nan Si.

457
00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:00,120
I can wait for her. I have the patience. No matter how long, I can wait for her.

458
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,390
This isn't a time problem. Enough already. Your interview is done.

459
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:10,580
As for if you can be hired or not, go back and put on some more effort.

460
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,830
Okay.

461
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,520
Thanks!

462
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,000
Did you had fun?

463
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,800
It was great.

464
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,400
It's good that you are here. I brought you a gift from my travel.

465
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,800
I actually planned to deliver it to you.

466
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,900
What would you like to drink?

467
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,500
Water.

468
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,600
Xiao Qiao, what are you doing?

469
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Last night, I dreamed that I saw my older brother.

470
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,400
He said these should be returned to its original owner.

471
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,000
It can't be.

472
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,100
You also know that it can't be? You think that if you think about it everyday, it will become possible?

473
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,600
Shouldn't you think for yourself?

474
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,800
Without these, how can it be proven that he existed?

475
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,300
Don't take these away. Leave them with me.

476
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,940
Go with me to a place.

477
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,700
Nothing has changed here.

478
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,000
Look carefully. It has changed.

479
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,400
When you first came to our home, was that tree that tall?

480
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:19,060
We have already replaced the trash bins in our home.

481
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,600
What are you trying to say?

482
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,400
Didn't you learn that motion and stillness are relative?

483
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,900
Changes are absolute.

484
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,300
Everything that are around us will change.

485
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,800
I know what you are worried about. Frankly, you have changed too.

486
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,800
You are just trying to maintain a relative stillness with Nan Si.

487
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,700
I have already experienced firsthand.

488
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,100
Enduring it psychologically has already reached my limit.

489
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,000
You are afraid of being hurt and you closed yourself up forever.

490
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,100
Will you be happy?

491
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,000
Rather than living a lifetime of always being on the edge,

492
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,600
why not just forget each other?

493
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,900
What you should forget now is my older brother.

494
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,500
Come in.

495
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,500
<i>Nan Si, all those years, I'm still used to writing letters to you.</i>

496
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,800
<i>I had them posted to your Team Unit.</i>

497
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,900
<i>Because they couldn't find the recipient, they returned  them.</i>

498
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,200
I knew it would end up like this

499
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,100
but I still insisted on doing it.

500
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,540
Because it would make me think that

501
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,790
you are still somewhere else in this world.

502
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,020
<i>I won't write to you anymore.</i>

503
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,370
I heard you went to Nan Qiao's place for an interview.

504
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,800
That's right.

505
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,700
Which post were you applying for?

506
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,700
You know the answer to that.

507
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,200
Tell me.

508
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,440
As your fiance.

509
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,000
Did you think carefully about this?

510
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,800
Yes, I did. I really thought carefully about this.

511
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,600
I can accept the probation. Furthermore, if I get hired,

512
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,800
I will never resign. If I become disloyal, you can do whatever you want with me.

513
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,600
What else?

514
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,800
Also... your dogs and cats.

515
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,600
And everything in your life. Leave them to me.

516
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,000
<i>Okay?</i>

517
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,430
Fiance? Just only this post?

518
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,300
There is still more. I do want to get promoted to being the official husband.

519
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,400
Let's go.

520
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,800
Where are we going? To celebrate?

521
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,450
Back to the shop. That's what you said. We are giving the dogs and cats a bath.

522
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,900
Okay.

523
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,300
Come here now.

524
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,100
Wear your helmet.

525
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,800
The streamlining of this aircraft body...

526
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,200
it's really not bad when you touch it.

527
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,600
Director Wen, the streamlining you just mentioned,

528
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,200
it was designed by me.

529
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,300
<i>As for the limbs, they are very slim.</i>

530
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,700
Don't look at it as being slim, but its strength and toughness

531
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,200
will definitely exceed your expectations. I'm the one who chose this carbon fiber material.

532
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,400
Move aside.

533
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,200
Director Wen,  the design of my camera is not bad.

534
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,600
Look. This camera lens is so good and has great depth.

535
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Let me tell you that its field of view when flying is as wide as that of a hawk's eye.

536
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,400
Tell me. If this Hunter is human,

537
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,600
wouldn't he be a perfect male god?

538
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,800
Idiot.

539
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,500
Boss, don't you think I'm right?

540
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,220
Of course, Boss would think so too.

541
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,700
I even know who the male god that Boss is thinking of.

542
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,100
He is the source of the inspiration for the design.
