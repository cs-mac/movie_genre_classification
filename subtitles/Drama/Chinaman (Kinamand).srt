1
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,435
Hi.
It's good you're here.

2
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,789
We had an appointment for 8.
Now it's 10 and I don't have all day.

3
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,909
You people always say to hell
with customers and appointments.

4
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,356
- Keld?
- Huh?

5
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,115
- What do you say?
- What?

6
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,158
- What do you say?
- Nothing.

7
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,470
Did you have a look?

8
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,430
- At what?
- At the travel brochures.

9
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,672
Oh, that... No, not really.

10
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,071
I don't think we can afford it.

11
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,036
Have you thought about
going to that dance class?

12
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,918
Yes, but...

13
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,277
- You have that shoulder problem.
- Yeah.

14
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,158
Keld... I'm moving.

15
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,869
I'm moving over to my sister's.

16
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,748
- Really?
- So...

17
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,235
Rie...

18
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,390
<i>This is Jytte Markmand. </i>
<i>I'm tired of waiting -</i>

19
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,269
- <i>so I've found another plumber. </i>
<i>Good-bye</i>.

20
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,833
<i>This is Peter Staal, calling yet again. </i>
<i>Just because you... </i>

21
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,954
CLOSED BECAUSE OF

22
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,870
Rie? Is it you?

23
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:09,879
CHINAMAN

24
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,755
Hi, my friend.
What'll it be?

25
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,635
I'm... having a look...

26
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,598
- Just have a look, okay?
- Right.

27
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,838
- What do you say? 6 with chicken?
- "Sex... with chicken"?

28
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,471
Or number 11?
Fried noodles. It's good, too.

29
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,832
- I think I'll just have a number 1.
- Eat here, or to go?

30
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,833
- Eat here.
- Okay.

31
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,476
Here you are...
Chicken soup.

32
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,708
"Good morning. "

33
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,354
I just wanted to say...
I've thought about everything.

34
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,755
Maybe we could find a good deal
in this travel brochure, anyway.

35
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,115
It's too late, Keld.

36
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,273
I've already booked a trip.
I'm going on a cruise.

37
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,560
- Oh, yeah...? Alone?
- No. Life goes on, Keld.

38
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,911
Pardon me for saying it,
but our marriage was a funeral.

39
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,278
Yeah, hello? It's about selling off
the effects of a deceased.

40
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,436
- $250. Minus the chess game, 225.
- Okay.

41
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,319
Please take your money.

42
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,715
- Bye-bye
- Bye.

43
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,917
"Chess Talent Keld Decker
Strikes Again"

44
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,959
You had number 1 on Tuesday,
number 2 on Wednesday -

45
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,635
- number 3 yesterday.
And today...?

46
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,590
I think a...

47
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,549
- Number 4.
- Number 4?

48
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,429
1, 2, 3, 4.
Dammit, that's funny.

49
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,958
- My name's Feng. What's yours?
- My name's Keld Decker.

50
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,395
- Kelladecker?
- Just Keld.

51
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,348
Okay, Keld.
And every evening, you eat here?

52
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,553
We're in the process
of splitting up, so...

53
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,951
So we'll find
a nice Chinese wife for you.

54
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,556
- No...
- Yes, Chinese wives are <i>very</i> nice.

55
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,076
I don't want a new wife.
I just want number 4.

56
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,676
Okay, number 4.
Spring Roll Special.

57
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,958
- You want soy sauce on it?
- Yes. Eat here.

58
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,117
Keld? What have you done?
Where are all our things?

59
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,474
Where's it all gone?

60
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,472
Someone came who buys up estates
of the deceased.

61
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,556
Where's my chandelier?

62
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,188
He took that, too.

63
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,197
Listen: I'll make sure you get the
divorce papers. You sign them, okay?

64
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,512
Then you send them to me,
we'll be called in to a meeting -

65
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,910
- and then we'll be divorced.

66
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,834
We can skip the separation
if you admit adultery.

67
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,039
- But I haven't...
- I know. This way it'll go faster.

68
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,320
- Can't we think it over?
- No. We're getting it over with. Now.

69
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,429
But Rie, can't we just buy
new furniture and new clothes, or...

70
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,918
"We're family. "

71
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,875
Hi, Poppa.

72
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,270
Give me a hand with this.

73
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,394
Don't worry,
I have the receipt.

74
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,960
What the hell have you done?

75
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,633
- Where the hell's Mom?
- I think she's at your aunt's.

76
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,150
- What's going on?
- I think she needs some time alone.

77
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,718
- Have you been balling other women?
- No. I'm sure she'll be back.

78
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,553
I sure as hell hope so.
For your sake.

79
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,599
- We'll just buy new furniture.
- Okay.

80
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,873
Then we can start
with this television.

81
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,398
If I say two hundred bucks,
you've made yourself a good deal.

82
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,437
Yeah.

83
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,991
Do you have time
for a game of chess?

84
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,277
Since when have we begun
playing chess again?

85
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,238
It must be ten years
since we've played.

86
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,550
Yes, but I just thought...

87
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,029
Just get back together, okay?

88
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,875
I eat here
Tuesday and Thursday.

89
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,310
It's structuralization.

90
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,796
One's everyday life
has to be structured.

91
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,397
On Monday and Friday I eat
at the central station cafeteria.

92
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,236
Wednesday and Saturday
it's the pizzeria -

93
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,437
- but Tuesday and Thursday
I'm here.

94
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,559
- What about Sunday?
- I improvise.

95
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,112
I'm a kind of
culinary refugee.

96
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,831
My stomach can't take
the Swedish cuisine.

97
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,835
Keld doesn't eat here just Tuesday
and Thursday. It's every evening.

98
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,911
No kidding?

99
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,914
- Keld's my best customer.
- That's really something.

100
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,834
- Every single evening?
- Yeah.

101
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,960
Is something wrong?

102
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,872
- Thanks for the help.
- Don't mention it.

103
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,150
I didn't do the plumbing.
It was my uncle.

104
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,669
I don't think
your uncle's a plumber.

105
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,511
No, no. He's just Chinese.
But he said those pipes were tip-top.

106
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,478
- They're not tip-top.
- No...

107
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,036
- That's my son, Zhang.
- Hi.

108
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,919
- And my cousin.
- Hi.

109
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,753
And my wife.

110
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,112
She says we should
give you dry clothes.

111
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,794
It's only water...

112
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,350
Oh, come on...
Come on, Keld.

113
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,434
Okay...

114
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,229
My grandma asked who
the ugly man with the big nose was.

115
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:25,631
- Keld? You're a real plumber?
- Yes.

116
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,759
Will you work for me?
It has to be done right.

117
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,957
All these pipes.

118
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,155
It's quite a big job, you know.

119
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,348
Maybe you could come
every morning and work a little.

120
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,630
Yeah...
I guess I could take a look at it.

121
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,677
But...

122
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,756
- I don't have any money.
- Oh.

123
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,710
We Chinese work hard
but we don't earn much.

124
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,150
All those pizzerias
and shawarma bars...

125
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,790
Dammit, they're killing me.
It's the Pakis.

126
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,837
They steal our trade.

127
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,639
- What? Wives?
- <i>No, trade. </i>

128
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,995
Oh, trade.

129
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,435
But we can say you get
a little black money. <i>Lots</i> of food.

130
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,996
Dammit, Keld!
That boy's driving me crazy.

131
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,757
- Do you have any kids?
- Yes, I have one. A son.

132
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,957
- You hit him, too?
- No, he's grown up.

133
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,636
They think they can
decide everything themselves.

134
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,553
It's no good.
A son saying no to his own father!

135
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,669
- That's not so unusual in Denmark.
- A son <i>must</i> obey his father.

136
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,276
- I'm the one who decides.
- Yeah, well...

137
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,238
Oh, I have customers.

138
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,394
Hey, Keld. A father
must not be afraid of his own son.

139
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,950
That's that.

140
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,270
And the section
about infidelity?

141
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,716
- Yes, well...
- Mom said you should sign it.

142
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,757
I haven't been unfaithful.

143
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,152
What do I know?
She just said it all had to be signed.

144
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,949
I'm not going to do it.

145
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,193
She can just say
she's been unfaithful to <i>me</i>.

146
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,510
We're going
to have to sort this out.

147
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,233
"A good offer. "

148
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,714
Hi, Keld.
Here's some food.

149
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,153
I've noticed a problem.

150
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,952
Yesterday you got number 22. You've
eaten all the numbers. What now?

151
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,590
I think we'll just start over.

152
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,754
Good idea. We start over with
number 1. Of course I make extra.

153
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,798
- A fresh start.
- Okay.

154
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,077
- Oh, Keld. Come...
- What...?

155
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,389
- Hi.
- Hi.

156
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,915
Just have a seat.

157
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,069
I hear you're divorced
from your old wife.

158
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,038
Yes... Soon.

159
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,715
I have a sister named Ling.
She's on a visit now in Denmark.

160
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,238
But she has to go home
because her tourist visa has run out.

161
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,593
It's not good in China for a lady
to live alone. It's very hard, Keld.

162
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,594
I want her to stay
in Denmark and live with us.

163
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,833
But, you know what?
She can't stay in Denmark.

164
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,788
- Why not?
- Immigration laws.

165
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,670
- That's not so good.
- It's very bad... Really bad.

166
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,639
Here you are.
It's Chinese tea. Very good.

167
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,110
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, it's good tea.

168
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,074
Keld.
We're good friends.

169
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,674
- Aren't we?
- Yes.

170
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:11,113
I'll pay you $4,000
to marry my sister.

171
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,512
Until she has
her permanent visa.

172
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:22,908
Then you can get divorced and
she can stay in Denmark anyway.

173
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,428
$4,000.
That's a good price.

174
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,515
Maybe...?

175
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,792
Okay, we'll drop it.

176
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,192
We'll start all over with number 1.
Chicken soup.

177
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,237
- Okay?
- Yes.

178
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,078
You'll have to excuse me.
This is my first divorce, so...

179
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:10,196
You've both signed the divorce
papers, so that's taken care of.

180
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:16,117
And Keld, we note that you have
signed a statement of infidelity.

181
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,754
No, I haven't.

182
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,718
Isn't that your signature?

183
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,149
- Isn't it?
- No.

184
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,273
Are you annulling your
statement of infidelity, or what?

185
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,000
- I haven't...
- Who knows what he's doing.

186
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,596
And Michael was quite sure, too.

187
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,512
All right.
We'll say it's my signature.

188
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,830
Good.

189
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,950
Then we can proceed to the conditions
for a divorce without separation.

190
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,113
Now we have to determine
possible economic compensation.

191
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,192
Like who's going
to keep the flat and...

192
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,079
That's no problem.
Keld can keep the flat.

193
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,835
I earn my own money.
I just want to get on with my life.

194
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,836
One must be careful not to give up
one's rights in the heat of the moment.

195
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,270
Okay, we can say Keld gives me
$8,000, and the case is closed.

196
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,472
What do you say to that, Keld?

197
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,908
- Right...
- Good.

198
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,436
Then the settlement sum
is $8,000.

199
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,834
<i>This is Peter Staal calling yet again. </i>
<i>Just because you're a plumber -</i>

200
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,869
- <i>shouldn't mean you can't</i>
<i>answer the phone once in a while. </i>

201
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,588
Pardon me, Feng.

202
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,593
Dammit, Keld.
That boy's impossible.

203
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,512
Right.

204
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,229
I'm willing...
to marry your sister...

205
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,554
...for $8,000.

206
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,990
Thank you! We say,
thank you very, very much.

207
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,396
- Thanks a lot.
- You want to meet my sister, yes?

208
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:14,351
She's not so well today.
A little headache, but not serious.

209
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,314
We say thank you
very, very, very much!

210
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,679
- <i>"What is your name?"</i>
- What?

211
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,070
<i>"My name is Peter. "</i>

212
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,238
"My name is Peter"... or Keld.

213
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,350
What is this I hear?

214
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,313
What do you hear?

215
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,439
That you're getting married
to his sister.

216
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,350
- It's just to help Feng.
- You're skating on thin ice.

217
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,317
How's that?

218
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,996
You shouldn't get involved
with people like that.

219
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,273
- Why not?
- I wouldn't feel good about it.

220
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,595
If you happen to annoy them...
If you don't keep your word...

221
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,479
What then?

222
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,756
I'd think twice before
I married one of those people.

223
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,190
I mean it.

224
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,313
I hate that grill.

225
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,752
I hate having to live
with my parents. I'm 20 years old.

226
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,798
I want to leave home
like normal people.

227
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,714
My father says:
"You must live close to grill. "

228
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,678
Okay.

229
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,878
This is... Oh, no!

230
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,234
Maybe you could
say something to him.

231
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,075
- About what?
- Now that we're family.

232
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,117
Right.

233
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,033
Keld, this is my little sister.

234
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,190
Hello... My name is Ling.

235
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,396
Hello...

236
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,348
My name is Keld.

237
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,396
Yes, there.

238
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,279
- Just put it in there?
- Yes.

239
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,437
Keld, there has to be
two mattresses.

240
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,593
If the police come,
it has to look like man and wife.

241
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,557
Right.

242
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,236
- Of course you won't sleep here.
- No, of course not.

243
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,870
Dammit, Keld,
you don't have much furniture.

244
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,793
No, I sold it.

245
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,429
- We're friends now, Keld.
- Yes.

246
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,194
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

247
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,191
Hello.

248
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,830
Hello.

249
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,436
"Bathroom"...

250
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,111
Look... Ling has written
a false love letter.

251
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,470
Here... It's a good one.

252
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,991
"Dearest Keld.
I was so happy to hear from you.

253
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:35,077
I am your rosebud that longs
for a gardener's caress. "

254
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,915
She's good at writing about love.
Isn't she, Keld?

255
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,277
- Yes.
- You have to invent letters, too.

256
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,910
- Say something about love.
- Yes... well...

257
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,392
"Thank you for your... letter.

258
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,395
I miss you, too...

259
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,558
...my flower. "

260
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,995
This isn't going to work, Feng.
I can't do it.

261
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:17,032
- Okay, I'll write it for you.
- The immigration people aren't dumb.

262
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,115
- They'll find out.
- We're smart. They won't find out.

263
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,478
We'll fool them.
We'll hold a big wedding.

264
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:36,833
- When do I get that money?
- As soon as the temporary visa comes.

265
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,958
Then you'll get your money.

266
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,473
Okay, Feng, I'm coming.

267
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,672
- Oh... Hi.
- What the hell's happening here?

268
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,474
I'm just going to a wedding.

269
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,430
- Who's getting married?
- It's just pro forma, so...

270
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,273
Okay,
but who's getting married?

271
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,433
It's... I am.

272
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,319
- <i>You're</i> getting married?
- Yes.

273
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,917
It's just some clothes I rented.

274
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,993
- Is it that neighbor with the big boobs?
- No, no, no.

275
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,833
Can you put this on for me?

276
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,589
It's a Chinese lady from China.

277
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,629
I actually don't know her at all.
It's just pro forma.

278
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,678
Does Mom know
you're getting married?

279
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,470
I'm only doing it to raise
that money she's supposed to get.

280
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,555
That's why I came, actually.

281
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,598
- Mom wants her money.
- Yes.

282
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,550
- I'll let her know, then.
- Yes. Come on.

283
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,990
Jesus Christ, man!

284
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,355
Well, congratulations.

285
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,755
Thank you.

286
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,878
- Dammit, Keld, you look great!
- Thanks.

287
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,076
- That's your car.
- Right.

288
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,000
If you sit down
in this car now...

289
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,994
- Then there's no way back.
- Really?

290
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,515
Keld Chinaman.

291
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,557
"Chinaman"?

292
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,429
That's your name.
From now on.

293
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,235
"Chinaman"...

294
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,276
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

295
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,113
- You have to toast each table.
- All the tables?

296
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,479
Yes. It's an important Chinese
tradition. Shall we? Come on.

297
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,875
Cheers... Cheers.

298
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,194
<i>In a lovely garden</i>

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,312
Keld... dammit.
It was a good wedding, wasn't it?

310
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,596
We're family now.

311
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,750
- I'd just like to sleep now.
- Really? But, Keld...

312
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,232
It was only pro forma, right?
No hanky-panky.

313
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,472
- No.
- Okay? Only pro forma.

314
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,156
Thank you.

315
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,316
"Warm"... Warm.

316
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,675
"Vawm".

317
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,917
"Plate".

318
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,718
- "Plate".
- Plate.

319
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,110
- Plate.
- Plate.

320
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:44,191
- "Camping table".
- "Camping table".

321
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,949
Camping table.

322
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,754
- "Things".
- "Things".

323
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,070
Many... things.

324
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,955
"Office".

325
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,475
Thank you.

326
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,398
Hi.

327
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,075
I've just come
to collect Mother's money.

328
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,631
You owe her eight kilos, right?
After your fine wedding.

329
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,033
That's not
how it works, Michael.

330
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,713
The money's not coming
until she's gotten her visa.

331
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,589
- What kind of rule is that?
- I thought you knew.

332
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,115
I'll just tell Mother, then.

333
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,068
The shop's open again,
so everything's under control.

334
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,198
This is Ling, by the way.

335
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,914
"How are you?"

336
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,471
Keld?

337
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,439
- Oh, hi.
- Hi. How's it going?

338
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,309
It's going fine.
I opened the shop again.

339
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,835
Yes, Michael told me.

340
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,117
Anything else been happening?

341
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,990
- I've gotten married.
- He said that, too.

342
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,994
- It's purely pro forma.
- Pro forma...

343
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:41,711
I don't know her. She's from China.
She's Feng's sister.

344
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,750
- And who's this Feng?
- He owns the grill bar.

345
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,708
- Really?
- That's where I eat every evening.

346
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,949
One evening
a water pipe went bust.

347
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:01,399
Then I met his sister and now
we're married. Pro forma, of course.

348
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:05,599
I actually did it because
you need some money, right?

349
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,799
- You'll get it soon.
- There's no big rush.

350
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:15,193
- You were going on a cruise.
- That cruise didn't work out.

351
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,272
- Really?
- Keld...

352
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:23,798
I realize I started all this.
We've said so many wrong things.

353
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:29,790
But... we have so many
good things together, haven't we?

354
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,793
We have to learn
to say the good things.

355
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,674
- Yes.
- We must.

356
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,673
We shouldn't
say anything now.

357
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:59,230
I'm going now. And then...

358
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,075
...we'll think about
what it is we want.

359
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,629
- Okay?
- Yes.

360
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,550
- Bye.
- Bye.

361
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,590
<i>"Keld is a good man</i>
<i>and we love each other very much. "</i>

362
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,672
<i>Yeah, that's what they all say. </i>

363
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,150
<i>But she has a nice name</i>.

364
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,151
- Hi, Keld.
- Is she alright?

365
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,675
- Who?
- Ling.

366
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:35,233
Yes, she's fine. And she says
she likes living in your flat.

367
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,119
Like husband and wife.

368
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,193
It's just that
I happened to notice -

369
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:46,717
- that she has
a lot of pills and medicine.

370
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,793
Those aren't real pills.
Ling's Chinese, right?

371
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,748
- All Chinese take herb medicine.
- It's not real medicine?

372
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,799
No, no, no.
It's ancient Chinese medicine.

373
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,669
All Chinese use it all the time.

374
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,990
- Are you sure?
- Yes, yes.

375
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,958
Ling is feeling fine.

376
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,396
- Everything is fine!
- Okay.

377
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,318
The interpreter
will say this when she comes.

378
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:15,598
Or maybe you know
enough Chinese to understand?

379
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:20,271
- It's probably best to wait.
- Can't you speak any Chinese?

380
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,079
Yes... of course I can.

381
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,715
Would you
translate this for me?

382
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,635
Just something like:
"Congratulations with everything. "

383
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,795
"May I see the menu. "

384
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,110
I would like a spring roll.

385
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,754
"Welcome to our country. "

386
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,189
"Hot water, cold water. "

387
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,228
And:
"Good luck with your new life. "

388
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,517
"Where is the closest hospital?"

389
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,910
I am a plumber.

390
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,396
And now
you may kiss each other.

391
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,157
I'm just kidding!

392
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,118
I hope you'll be
very happy together.

393
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,439
- Dammit, Keld!
- Yes.

394
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,994
- Cheers.
- Congratulations!

395
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,394
- Oh, pardon me.
- Rie?

396
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,948
Congratulations. I haven't
congratulated the two of you.

397
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,190
No...

398
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,158
I can't figure out
what's happening.

399
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:59,711
We're supposed to think about
giving ourselves another chance.

400
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:05,557
- You haven't made a decision?
- No. It's all rather... complicated.

401
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,553
Yes,
it looks a little complicated.

402
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,635
Ling, this is Rie.
Rie, this is Ling.

403
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,876
Hi.

404
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,191
- I'll make a pot of tea.
- Yes.

405
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,073
This is pro forma?
This is just for the money?

406
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,515
Yes.

407
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,071
- Oh, boy.
- "Oh, boy".

408
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,516
Oh, boy. We better hope
no one finds out, huh?

409
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,591
What do you mean?

410
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:43,276
It makes me a little bitter,
you lying in what once was my flat -

411
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,831
- getting an erotic massage from
some little number from Thailand.

412
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,198
She's... from China.
I've told you that.

413
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:56,990
How about you giving all my things
away? How about my chandelier?

414
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,278
She's gotten her visa
so you'll get your money, okay?

415
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,595
That's it, then.

416
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,357
Thank you.

417
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:16,596
It would be good
if I got my money tomorrow.

418
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,389
Otherwise someone
might say the wrong thing.

419
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,552
Like calling the police
and saying it's not a real marriage.

420
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,314
Then she'd be
on her way home again.

421
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:51,078
- You mean you don't have the money?
- No, not yet.

422
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,800
It can't go on like this, Feng.

423
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:00,198
That wedding, you know.
Too many guests. Too much drinking.

424
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,955
<i>Very</i> expensive marriage.
So I don't lose face.

425
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,509
What do you call this, then?

426
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,112
Now I lose face with you.
I'm not good at keeping agreements.

427
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,193
- You promised me 8,000!
- Really, Keld?

428
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:21,797
If I don't get the money, your
sister goes straight back to China.

429
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,952
Let's have 6 with chicken
and calm down.

430
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:29,910
I don't want 6 with chicken.
I need the money, Feng. Right now.

431
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,919
- Dammit, Keld.
- Stop that "dammit, Keld".

432
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,552
You can just come
with your fucking triads.

433
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,518
I could care less if I get killed.

434
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,709
And your fucking pipes
are fixed... dammit!

435
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,360
Oh, Jesus Christ!

436
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,749
Speak Danish, dammit!

437
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,595
This is Denmark, so learn
Danish if you want to be here.

438
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:18,993
It's not so damn hard.
"Front door"! "Wallpaper"!

439
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:22,197
"Ceiling"! "Floor"!

440
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,635
"Jacket"!

441
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,275
"I'm sorry. "

442
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,880
- Hi.
- Hi.

443
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:40,192
- Here's something from my father.
- Oh? Where'd he get it?

444
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:43,113
He borrowed it
from some cousins.

445
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:49,628
It wasn't easy for him. He lost face,
which isn't so good if you're Chinese.

446
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:55,788
I think he feels really bad,
because he hasn't hassled me today.

447
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:58,872
You can tell him that I need...

448
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,551
...this money.

449
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,234
- I really do.
- I'll let him know.

450
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,755
- Good.
- Yeah.

451
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:11,309
- Bye.
- Bye.

452
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,510
Here it is.

453
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,558
- The money.
- You better count it, Mom.

454
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,833
- Then there's you and me, Rie.
- What about us?

455
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,992
I don't know quite
how to say it...

456
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,310
You're in love.

457
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:59,632
- You've already made her sad enough.
- Get inside, Michael.

458
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,873
- You should be ashamed, cocksucker.
- Get inside!

459
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,474
So, that's the way it is?

460
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,239
Yes.

461
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,995
- Then there's no more to talk about.
- No.

462
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,390
Keld, dammit, my friend.
Eat here, take out?

463
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,154
- Is she here?
- Who?

464
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,469
Is she here?

465
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,518
Love problems, Chinaman?

466
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:45,712
Love can be heavenly
or like being in Hell.

467
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:49,714
But one thing is for sure.

468
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,112
Love must be professed.

469
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,598
If it isn't...

470
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:03,834
...it's neither here nor there.

471
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,470
There's nothing
worse than that.

472
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:15,797
You must profess your love...
Chinaman.

473
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,029
"I love you. "

474
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,070
It's over-worked.

475
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:38,559
The heart isn't strong enough, so
the organs don't get enough oxygen.

476
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:43,475
The lungs must compensate
for the faster breathing.

477
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:48,953
In the end
the blood circulation stops.

478
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,115
So...

479
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:01,876
...I'm very sorry.

480
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:19,639
Keld, I knew...
I knew her heart was too large.

481
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,755
That's why she came
to Denmark. To get well.

482
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:37,751
Dammit, Keld. I didn't know
you'd fall in love with each other.

483
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:42,152
It was only pro forma.
Pro forma!

484
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:37,036
Keld Decker? This is a cohabitation
check. May we come in?

485
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,790
It doesn't look too good,
I'm sorry to say.

486
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,473
No.

487
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,950
There was only
one toothbrush in the bathroom.

488
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,111
There's only a single bed.

489
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,397
And there's no trace
of women's clothes.

490
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,109
We can only conclude
that you live here alone.

491
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,872
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

492
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,428
I can't... I can't...

493
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,955
- You'll hear from us.
- Yeah.

494
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,668
Mom was real sorry to hear...

495
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:52,750
I was the one who called the cops
and said your marriage was pro forma.

496
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,235
How could I know
she was ill?

497
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,389
I'm sorry, Dad.

498
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,112
Michael...

499
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:27,308
- It was...
- Should we play a game of chess?

500
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,710
If you still feel like it.

501
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,396
Yes.

502
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,435
Will you fetch it?

503
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:29,352
My grandmother wants Ling's ashes
sent back to our village.

504
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,796
Not just left
sitting on a shelf in Denmark.

505
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:38,637
All of our family members' ashes
have been cast into the local river.

506
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,349
So she wants us
sent home when we die.

507
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:55,435
I'd like to send Zhang
to China with the urn.

508
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:01,311
But, you know what? A plane ticket
like that is very expensive.

509
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:06,118
We sent my uncle
by surface mail.

510
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:10,437
- He disappeared en route.
- He did?

511
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,717
Dammit, Keld,
we never got him back!

512
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:16,553
- That wasn't so good.
- No.

513
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:21,316
But we might
have to send Ling by mail, too.

514
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,748
- What would you like?
- Nothing. Thanks, anyway.

515
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:33,391
- Hi, Rie.
- Hi. I thought I could find you here.

516
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:38,554
Yeah. This is where I eat.
Every evening.

517
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,673
- They call me "Chinaman".
- "Chinaman"?

518
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,990
Yeah.

519
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,714
- What's that?
- The money.

520
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:59,430
- But, why?
- So you can buy new furniture.

521
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,068
Or whatever you like.

522
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:06,119
I've taken some,
and kept some for Michael.

523
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:19,953
- That's why I came.
- Yeah.

524
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,840
- See you, Chinaman.
- Bye.

525
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,477
Hey, Feng!

526
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,148
- Dammit, Keld.
- Dammit, Feng.

527
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:03,393
- Good-bye.
- Bye-bye.

528
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:30,238
THE END
