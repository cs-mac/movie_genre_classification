1
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:35,553
All right, Coop.
A hundred and five degrees.

2
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:40,183
- What do you say?
- 105? I can go more.

3
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:48,900
- 108
- I'm feeling it.

4
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:53,071
OK, the suspense is killing me.

5
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:54,572
- All right, 110.
- 110?

6
00:00:54,614 --> 00:00:57,700
- 110
- A hundred and ten toasty ones.

7
00:00:57,742 --> 00:00:59,827
Right. Ready to go out
and greet the heat?

8
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:01,454
The warm wind in my hair?

9
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:02,914
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

10
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:05,041
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

11
00:01:17,762 --> 00:01:19,555
Thirty-one. Thirty-one degrees.

12
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:22,725
- Thirty-one below.
- Thirty-one below! New record!

13
00:01:22,809 --> 00:01:24,894
- Thirty-one below!
- New record!

14
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:28,189
New record! Oh, it's cold!

15
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:51,296
"Eight Below"
adventure-drama-family, USA, 2006

16
00:02:44,182 --> 00:02:45,975
I hate to do this, but...

17
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:48,311
Rise and shine, kids.
No more sleeping in.

18
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:56,194
All right.
If "rise and shine" won't work...

19
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:57,987
Is anybody hungry this morning?

20
00:02:58,029 --> 00:03:01,616
Attaboy, Max.

21
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:05,787
Hey, what do you say?
Ready for exercise before breakfast?

22
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:09,332
How you doing?

23
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:10,792
How does right field look?

24
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:15,380
I think it looks pretty good.
What do you say, Max? Here we go.

25
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:17,507
Go get it!

26
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:23,763
Hey, Maya.

27
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:26,808
How's my best girl doing, huh?

28
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:28,851
How you doing?

29
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:30,645
You keeping everybody in line?

30
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:34,774
Left field. Go get it.

31
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:36,943
Left field, Maya. Here we go.

32
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,863
Go get it!

33
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:44,325
Attaboy, Max. Come here, buddy.

34
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:54,752
Settle down.
There's plenty to go around, guys.

35
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:56,296
Here you go, Shorty.

36
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:58,923
Good boy, Shadow.

37
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:02,427
Dewey. Truman.

38
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,761
There you go, Old Jack.

39
00:04:19,235 --> 00:04:22,322
That's my best girl.
Here, I'll trade you.

40
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:23,406
There you go, Maya.

41
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:40,757
- Hi.
- Hey.

42
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:43,885
- Didn't think I'd see you this year.
- Guess you got lucky.

43
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:45,428
- I guess so.
- Crazy Katie!

44
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:49,474
- Did you get your pilot's license yet?
- Oh, Coop, I missed you.

45
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:52,977
OK.

46
00:04:54,646 --> 00:04:57,148
- Got that?
- Yeah.

47
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:59,025
Hey, hey, careful with that.

48
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:02,779
That equipment's made it 10,000 miles.
I'd hate that to change in six feet.

49
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,614
Sorry about that.

50
00:05:04,656 --> 00:05:07,158
Hi. I'm Dr. Davis McClaren.

51
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,243
Earth and Space Sciences UCLA.

52
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:13,539
Jerry Shepard, expedition guide.
Welcome to the bottom of the world.

53
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:15,124
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

54
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,336
Go any further south,
you'll fall off the planet.

55
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,713
Well, that'd be unfortunate.

56
00:05:20,797 --> 00:05:24,634
Charlie Cooper, cartographer,
mechanical engineer, runway paver.

57
00:05:24,676 --> 00:05:27,637
- Nice to meet you.
- Dr. McClaren! Welcome to the ice.

58
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,140
Andy Harrison, NSF science director.
An honor to meet you.

59
00:05:31,182 --> 00:05:34,060
- Dr. Rosemary Paris, field coordinator.
- Nice to meet you.

60
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:35,520
You've met our team?

61
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:38,773
Yeah, Mr. Cooper was just taking
good care of all my things.

62
00:05:38,856 --> 00:05:41,609
Cooper, really?
First time for everything, I suppose.

63
00:05:41,693 --> 00:05:43,403
- Let's get you inside.
- Thanks.

64
00:05:43,486 --> 00:05:46,698
- Sure.
- Yeah.

65
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:52,620
OK. Lady luck, in my corner.

66
00:05:52,704 --> 00:05:55,373
- What are we playing?
- She is pretty.

67
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:58,001
- Quarter in.
- Quarter.

68
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:00,878
- You're going down.
- You're going down.

69
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:02,630
Crazy Katie, you're going down.

70
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:05,174
- Hey, doc, you want in?
- No, thanks.

71
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:07,051
I gave up gambling a long time ago.

72
00:06:07,135 --> 00:06:09,429
Hey, you flew in with Katie, didn't you?

73
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:13,099
Remind me how you're getting home.

74
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:16,894
Say, Old Jack, you in or out, buddy?

75
00:06:19,063 --> 00:06:21,774
- Translation?
- That'd be out.

76
00:06:23,276 --> 00:06:26,362
- So, Coop, how's the new girlfriend?
- Mmm.

77
00:06:27,572 --> 00:06:29,574
How's my new girl?

78
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:31,242
I don't know.

79
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:33,745
- How about hot?
- Wow.

80
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:36,205
- Huh?
- Wow.

81
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:39,250
She's a scientist too.
At the italian base.

82
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:40,752
- Pretty and smart.
- Smarts.

83
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:43,379
Yeah. Notice something
missing in that picture?

84
00:06:43,421 --> 00:06:47,050
OK, OK. I think...
I know you mean me.

85
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:50,845
You're talk... The picture's coming.
She's sending one of the two of us, OK?

86
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:52,055
Patience, Jer.

87
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:54,474
- Uh-huh. How many?
- Two.

88
00:06:54,557 --> 00:06:57,352
Doc, you looking forward
to your first trip to Dry Valleys?

89
00:06:57,435 --> 00:07:00,188
It's a pretty cool spot
this time of year.

90
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:02,732
Actually, Dr. McClaren
needs to get to Mt. Melbourne

91
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:04,943
to search for his meteorite.

92
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:09,447
Melbourne, huh?

93
00:07:09,489 --> 00:07:11,491
Nobody said anything about Melbourne.

94
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:14,243
Yeah. Meteorite hunting
is a pretty small world

95
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:17,830
and, uh, I didn't want anybody
to know where I was really going,

96
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:20,583
'cause I'm looking
for something special at Melbourne

97
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,336
and the NSF let us
keep it off the paperwork.

98
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:26,464
ls there a problem?

99
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:30,134
Look, doc, let me show you something.

100
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:35,932
I'll show you on the map.

101
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:38,893
- This is where we are, right? OK.
- Yeah.

102
00:07:38,977 --> 00:07:40,603
Here's Dry Valleys.

103
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:44,649
All the way over here, Mt. Melbourne.
Twice as far and the opposite direction.

104
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:47,402
I've been over our route twice
in the last week,

105
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:50,738
but I haven't been to Mt. Melbourne
since the beginning of the season.

106
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:53,992
Well, that may be so. But
Dr. McClaren has traveled a long way.

107
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:57,495
- If we can accommodate him, we should.
- Andy, it's the end of January.

108
00:07:57,578 --> 00:08:00,498
The ice is too thin and snowmobiles
would be too dangerous.

109
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,626
There's only one way
to make that trip, with the dogs.

110
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:05,753
The dogs?

111
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:10,300
OK. Will they be able
to carry all my gear?

112
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,385
The dogs'll be fine.

113
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:15,430
- It's really late in the season.
- Last year we had the dogs out

114
00:08:15,513 --> 00:08:17,974
right up until the day we left.

115
00:08:21,144 --> 00:08:24,522
All right, Andy.
You're the boss. I'll get things ready.

116
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:30,945
- Hey, you need some help?
- No, I'm fine.

117
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:32,572
Coop, say good night to Buck.

118
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:37,744
Uh, I'm gonna take a rain check, Jer.

119
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:41,414
Ah...

120
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:43,291
Kids, come on! Let's go!

121
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:46,502
Everyone outside. Let's get you
tucked into bed. Come on.

122
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:56,137
Good, Jack.

123
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,389
Good boy. I'll see you in the morning.

124
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:03,811
Hey, Maya.

125
00:09:05,396 --> 00:09:07,315
What do you say? One more trip, huh?

126
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:10,777
Then we'll get you to McMurdo
for the winter. That sound good?

127
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,197
Huh? That sound good? That's my girl.

128
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:20,286
Hey, Max. I need a good trip out of you.

129
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:26,751
Lucky star, huh? Let's hope so.

130
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:29,379
See you in the morning, Max.

131
00:09:36,469 --> 00:09:37,720
Knock, knock.

132
00:09:37,762 --> 00:09:39,555
- Hey.
- Hey.

133
00:09:39,597 --> 00:09:41,891
I warmed up some of
your favorite ice cream.

134
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:44,435
Strawberry.
That's your favorite ice cream.

135
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:48,064
Yeah, well, you got here early.
I didn't have time to go shopping.

136
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:52,735
Uh, yeah, well, they changed things up.

137
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:54,612
How you been?

138
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:56,698
Been a good season. Kids are doing well.

139
00:09:56,781 --> 00:10:00,326
Maya's been awesome.
Old Jack's getting a bit older, so...

140
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,912
Jerry, I was asking you how you've been.

141
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:10,712
I'm not interrupting or anything, am l?

142
00:10:10,795 --> 00:10:12,880
No, Rosie. We were just catching up.

143
00:10:13,464 --> 00:10:15,425
OK.

144
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:20,638
All right, well, uh...

145
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,974
I guess I'll see you guys
in the morning, then.

146
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:24,642
Thank you. That was sweet.

147
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:28,271
No problem. Good night.

148
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:30,315
Good night.

149
00:10:40,825 --> 00:10:43,077
- Pardon me.
- Oh, sorry.

150
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:45,455
Oh!

151
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:48,625
Oh! Head's up.

152
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:53,630
Sad fact of life in this place, doc.
Floor is more comfy than the bunks.

153
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:56,424
So, what is it exactly that you do here?

154
00:10:56,507 --> 00:11:00,970
Cartography. I spent the last two years
mapping every inch of this territory.

155
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,016
Hey, dude.
What happened? You strike out?

156
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:10,813
No. I didn't even swing.

157
00:11:10,855 --> 00:11:15,401
Ah, went down looking.
That's still a strike-out, Jer.

158
00:11:17,362 --> 00:11:19,906
- Ow! Ow!
- Sorry about that, buddy.

159
00:11:19,989 --> 00:11:21,741
I didn't see you there.

160
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:30,291
We turn the heat off at night, so if
there's anything you need to keep warm,

161
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,001
I suggest you sleep with it.

162
00:11:34,837 --> 00:11:35,964
lncoming.

163
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:38,758
Ow! Jerry!

164
00:11:38,841 --> 00:11:40,927
Man!

165
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:49,018
OK, this is the last of it.

166
00:11:54,357 --> 00:11:57,360
Wow, doc.
Won't be losing you, now, will we?

167
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,364
All right, rule number one.

168
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:05,243
If you want to approach the dogs,
approach them from the front. OK?

169
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:07,036
- See how the lines are taut?
- Yeah.

170
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:10,540
I want them like that at all times.
If the line's tangled, they'll fight.

171
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,375
- We don't want that.
- Got it.

172
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:15,586
- Anything else I should know?
- The rest is pretty much up to me.

173
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,714
I gotta watch them.
They're working dogs.

174
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:20,216
They'll run themselves to death.
They love work.

175
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:22,927
All right, official introductions.

176
00:12:23,011 --> 00:12:26,180
Up here in front, on lead,
we got my best girl, Maya.

177
00:12:26,264 --> 00:12:28,266
Next to her we got Old Jack.

178
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:32,145
Just turned ten, and, uh, he's
actually getting ready for retirement.

179
00:12:32,228 --> 00:12:35,023
Back here,
the white one, this is Shorty.

180
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:37,859
And next to him is the pup
of the bunch. That's Max.

181
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:39,485
He's still in training.

182
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:42,530
He's got the right stuff.
I expect big things out of him.

183
00:12:42,614 --> 00:12:45,033
Right here, we got the twins.
This is Truman.

184
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:47,744
Truman took a bite
out of Dewey a couple years ago.

185
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:50,455
- Notice the scar above Dewey's eye?
- Oh, yeah.

186
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:54,250
Yeah. Well, they've been
buddies ever since, so...

187
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:57,295
Back here, last but not least,
we got the two malamutes.

188
00:12:57,337 --> 00:13:00,632
The gray one's Shadow
and the red one's his buddy, Buck.

189
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:03,843
All brawn and absolutely no brain.
But we love 'em.

190
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:08,640
- Everyone good to go this morning?
- Yeah, I think so.

191
00:13:08,723 --> 00:13:11,225
I was just being introduced
to Maya, Old Jack,

192
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:13,895
Shorty, Max, Truman,
Dewey, Shadow and Buck.

193
00:13:13,978 --> 00:13:15,939
- Excellent.
- Jer?

194
00:13:17,148 --> 00:13:20,610
- Be careful out there, OK?
- Always.

195
00:13:20,652 --> 00:13:22,195
Take care of Cooper for me.

196
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:24,739
Don't worry. I'll give him
plenty of food and water.

197
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:26,324
OK, enough. Are we done?

198
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:30,578
I'd like a picture of our
intrepid explorers, please. Thank you.

199
00:13:30,662 --> 00:13:32,914
All right. Hang on!

200
00:13:32,997 --> 00:13:34,582
OK.

201
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,625
OK, you ready?

202
00:13:37,377 --> 00:13:40,004
Uno, dos, tres.

203
00:13:40,088 --> 00:13:43,132
Handsome. So handsome.

204
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:46,886
Hey, Coop. You'd better get up here
and say goodbye to Buck.

205
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:52,141
Oh, yeah?

206
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:54,894
All right, uh, see you, Buck!

207
00:13:54,978 --> 00:13:56,938
Safe... Safe trip, Buck.

208
00:13:57,021 --> 00:14:00,108
No. Come over and say goodbye.
You're gonna give him a complex.

209
00:14:03,653 --> 00:14:05,822
And what about my complex?

210
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:08,157
Come around... Come say goodbye to him.

211
00:14:10,326 --> 00:14:13,871
I'm... I'm pretty sure he heard me
say goodbye, Jer. I don't...

212
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,458
OK. I don't know why you do this.

213
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,170
OK.

214
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:24,090
See ya, Buck.

215
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:26,217
All right. You, uh...

216
00:14:26,301 --> 00:14:30,430
You take care of the doctor
and, uh, Jerry, OK?

217
00:14:30,513 --> 00:14:34,559
Oh! Oh! Nasty!

218
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:36,060
Oh! That was disgusting!

219
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:39,355
I got dog spit all in my mouth
and my nose!

220
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:42,692
It's not funny.

221
00:14:44,902 --> 00:14:47,697
I don't see what's so funny.

222
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:51,326
All right.
Take care, guys. We'll see you.

223
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:52,910
- Bye.
- See ya.

224
00:14:52,994 --> 00:14:55,830
All right, team!
Last hike of the season!

225
00:14:55,913 --> 00:14:57,415
Let's go! Hike! Hike!

226
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,031
Come on, Jack! Come on, Old Jack!

227
00:15:30,114 --> 00:15:32,492
Let's go, Maya! Come on, girl!

228
00:16:04,482 --> 00:16:07,068
Whoa! Whoa!

229
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:13,283
Whoa! Whoa!

230
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:20,832
What's the problem?

231
00:16:20,915 --> 00:16:24,877
We got ice fields up ahead.
I don't know how thick the ice is.

232
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:27,588
That's why we couldn't take
the snowmobiles. Look.

233
00:16:27,672 --> 00:16:29,507
So, what do we do?

234
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:32,635
I'm gonna change things up.

235
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:35,096
Put the dogs
in a fan formation for safety.

236
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:38,474
It's a little slower,
but it spreads the weight out.

237
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:40,893
That way if one of the dogs
falls through the ice,

238
00:16:40,977 --> 00:16:44,981
the lead's long enough
so the rest don't follow.

239
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:48,234
Hike!

240
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:19,849
Hey, doc.

241
00:17:19,891 --> 00:17:22,560
- You see that over there?
- What is that?

242
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,105
Here.

243
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,443
You see 'em?

244
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:33,196
- I see 'em. What are they?
- Leopard seals.

245
00:17:33,237 --> 00:17:35,490
More leopard than seal, if you ask me.

246
00:17:35,573 --> 00:17:38,201
- Give 'em a wide birth?
- Yeah, we'll give 'em some space.

247
00:17:58,054 --> 00:18:01,182
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

248
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:03,518
Whoa, kids! Whoa!

249
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:07,105
- What was that?
- We're on a glacier now.

250
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:09,565
We're gonna have to
take her slow, doc. Get off.

251
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:13,653
I want you to take the brake.
You're gonna run the sled. All right?

252
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:15,571
Heavy brake.

253
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:18,324
Follow my footprints.
Keep the sled on my footprints.

254
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:19,742
- I'll probe ahead.
- Got it.

255
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:23,204
This glacier's always moving,
so we have to be careful.

256
00:18:28,251 --> 00:18:31,587
All right, doc. Keep two feet
on the brake if you need to.

257
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:34,757
- Just keep a steady go, all right?
- All right.

258
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:37,510
All right, kids, come on! Easy, now!

259
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:39,971
Nice and easy. Let's go.

260
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:02,994
All right, stop! Stop!

261
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:05,455
All right, hard brake, right there!

262
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:09,751
We got a crevasse right here.

263
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:13,921
I'm not sure how big it is,
so we're gonna go around. OK.

264
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:17,342
We're gonna bring it over this way.
Slow and easy.

265
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:19,093
I'm gonna call Maya over,

266
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:22,430
and then I just want you
to let up ever so lightly, all right?

267
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:25,725
- All right, got it.
- All right, Maya, haw! Haw!

268
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,564
Haw! Haw!

269
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:33,107
Max, what are you doing?

270
00:19:34,192 --> 00:19:35,276
Max, no. Haw!

271
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:38,821
Max! Stop! Stop, Max! Doc, stop!

272
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:43,576
No!

273
00:19:48,873 --> 00:19:51,000
Hold on, doc!

274
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:55,672
Doc! Put both hands on the sled!
Both hands on the sled, doc!

275
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:02,011
Hike! Come on, Jack, take it home!

276
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:03,471
Come on, Maya, take her home!

277
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:07,475
Come on! Hike!

278
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:27,870
Oh, man!

279
00:20:27,912 --> 00:20:29,038
You OK?

280
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah.

281
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:44,220
Do me a favor.

282
00:20:44,304 --> 00:20:48,683
Next time you decide to go to Melbourne,
don't pack so much stuff.

283
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:51,144
And try coming a bit earlier.

284
00:20:51,227 --> 00:20:53,771
Andy said the trip was fine.
You agreed to go.

285
00:20:57,942 --> 00:21:00,737
Andy's my boss. I do what he says.

286
00:21:00,778 --> 00:21:04,324
If you didn't think it was safe,
you shouldn't have backed down.

287
00:21:19,922 --> 00:21:23,051
Easy.

288
00:21:29,307 --> 00:21:31,434
Jerry, thanks for today.

289
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,688
Yeah. No problem.

290
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:43,780
Who's the artist?

291
00:21:43,821 --> 00:21:46,783
My son, Eric.

292
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,286
He does one every trip.

293
00:21:53,665 --> 00:21:55,792
He looks like your wife.

294
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,294
Lucky kid.

295
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,966
Yeah.

296
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:05,510
What about you? You got somebody?

297
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:06,678
Are you kidding me?

298
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:10,014
I'm here six months a year
dragging scientists around.

299
00:22:10,098 --> 00:22:12,308
What kind of woman
would put up with that?

300
00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:15,395
How about Katie?
Looked like you might've had something.

301
00:22:15,478 --> 00:22:19,649
Yeah. A couple years ago we did.

302
00:22:19,732 --> 00:22:23,027
You know how it goes. Sometimes
it works, sometimes it doesn't.

303
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:25,780
I guess relationships
don't fit my lifestyle.

304
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:30,326
Anyhow, come on. Let's go outside, guys.

305
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,997
We're gonna get an early start tomorrow.
Come on. Come on, Max.

306
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:36,416
Come on, Max.

307
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:02,025
All right, whoa!

308
00:23:02,108 --> 00:23:04,861
Doc, hold it. Put on the brake,
I'm gonna take it from here.

309
00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:08,072
Yeah, got it. Whoa!

310
00:23:10,658 --> 00:23:12,660
What do you say?

311
00:23:12,744 --> 00:23:15,538
- That's something else.
- That's Melbourne.

312
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:20,585
- That's your home for the next week.
- Beautiful.

313
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:22,795
Ready, now! Hike!

314
00:23:35,934 --> 00:23:40,688
Victoria,
this is McMurdo Weather. Come in.

315
00:23:40,772 --> 00:23:43,816
Victoria? This is McMurdo Weather.

316
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,277
This is Victoria. We copy you, Mactown.

317
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:50,156
Hi, Andy. It's Steve.
Jnst checking statns on your team.

318
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:52,909
We've got four at the base
and two in the field. Over.

319
00:23:52,951 --> 00:23:54,869
Snggest you bring them in.

320
00:23:54,953 --> 00:23:57,747
We have two massive
low pressnre systems moving sonth.

321
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:01,417
Control wants you in early
jnst to be safe. Over.

322
00:24:01,501 --> 00:24:03,544
Copy that, Mactown. Over and out.

323
00:24:03,628 --> 00:24:05,797
Get Jerry on the radio.

324
00:24:17,475 --> 00:24:19,769
Wanna sling me a cup of that
when you get a chance?

325
00:24:19,852 --> 00:24:21,813
Yeah, sure thing.

326
00:24:28,152 --> 00:24:30,321
- You got her?
- Yeah, thanks.

327
00:24:33,658 --> 00:24:35,243
How's that looking there?

328
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:38,579
Well, everything points
to the spot that we're on.

329
00:24:38,663 --> 00:24:42,125
The next couple days
are gonna tell us a lot.

330
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:45,295
Field base to Melbourne. Come in.

331
00:24:45,336 --> 00:24:47,964
Base to Melbourne. Come in.

332
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:51,134
Jerry?

333
00:24:51,217 --> 00:24:53,261
Jerry, do you read me? Over.

334
00:24:53,344 --> 00:24:55,722
Yeah, go for Melbourne. That you, Katie?

335
00:24:55,805 --> 00:24:58,349
Jerry, we got a call from Mactown.

336
00:24:58,433 --> 00:25:01,644
...major storm coming in. Over.

337
00:25:01,728 --> 00:25:04,647
You'll have to go again.
We're in a bad spot here.

338
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:08,818
Jerry... back to field base.
Do you copy?

339
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:13,489
We got a major storm coming in.
Mactown wants you in right away. Over.

340
00:25:13,531 --> 00:25:15,908
All right. Copy that. We'll be back.

341
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:17,952
When do we expect this storm?

342
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:22,165
Katie?

343
00:25:25,877 --> 00:25:28,254
Sorry, doc. Looks like
we're gonna have to pack up.

344
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:32,967
- Well, when do we have to leave?
- We leave first thing, tomorrow.

345
00:25:58,201 --> 00:26:00,620
- Listen, Jerry...
- You heard what she said.

346
00:26:00,703 --> 00:26:05,667
Now, Jerry, look. I cannot
go back without at least trying.

347
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,211
Yeah, well, that's not your call.

348
00:26:08,294 --> 00:26:10,254
No. It's not.

349
00:26:10,296 --> 00:26:12,382
There's a major storm coming in,
all right?

350
00:26:12,465 --> 00:26:14,550
Not a minor one, but a major.

351
00:26:14,592 --> 00:26:17,262
Down here there's a big difference
between the two.

352
00:26:17,345 --> 00:26:20,223
My job as your guide
is to get you back home in one piece,

353
00:26:20,306 --> 00:26:22,100
and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

354
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:25,645
But Jerry, we're talking
about a rock from another world.

355
00:26:25,728 --> 00:26:30,233
This ice floe might give us the first
meteorite from the planet Mercury.

356
00:26:30,316 --> 00:26:32,986
That could lead us
to discoveries we can't imagine.

357
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:35,280
When you climb a mountain,
go up a river,

358
00:26:35,363 --> 00:26:39,784
the exciting part isn't what you know
is there. It's what you don't know.

359
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:43,579
It's what you might find,
and it's the same here.

360
00:26:43,663 --> 00:26:47,750
I came halfway around the world to look
for something that's important to me.

361
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:50,086
Jerry, please, you...

362
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:54,924
You gotta take chances
for the things you care about.

363
00:26:59,637 --> 00:27:01,639
Half the day on the east slope.

364
00:27:01,723 --> 00:27:04,559
But I want to be back
on that sled tomorrow by noon.

365
00:27:04,642 --> 00:27:07,478
I'll take that. I'll take that.

366
00:28:00,782 --> 00:28:02,784
No.

367
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:33,690
Hey, we're running
out of time here, doc.

368
00:28:33,773 --> 00:28:35,984
Believe me, I know.

369
00:29:04,596 --> 00:29:06,556
Hey, Jerry.

370
00:29:07,974 --> 00:29:10,893
- I think we got something here.
- Hey, wait, doc!

371
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:13,146
Doc, wait a minute. Doc, don't move.

372
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:14,939
You're outside the safety zone.

373
00:29:15,023 --> 00:29:18,276
This is a big one.
Eleven centimeters across, fully intact.

374
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:21,404
It looks like a basalt,
but it's like nothing I've ever seen.

375
00:29:21,446 --> 00:29:23,781
- Jerry!
- Doc! Doc, don't move.

376
00:29:23,865 --> 00:29:26,909
That area's unchecked.
I told you to stay inside the flags.

377
00:29:26,993 --> 00:29:29,120
Oh, my God. This is it!

378
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:30,705
Great, doc. Stay still.

379
00:29:30,788 --> 00:29:34,042
I'm glad you found your rock,
but let's get you out of there.

380
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:37,629
Just follow your footsteps out.
Step right in your footprints.

381
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:42,926
Man, I knew I could find it! Huh?
What'd I tell you? This is it.

382
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:45,595
Half a day! Thank you.

383
00:29:45,637 --> 00:29:48,389
Now that you scared the hell out of me,
can we go home now?

384
00:29:48,473 --> 00:29:51,476
- Yeah.
- All right. Let's go.

385
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:56,940
Victoria, this is Mactown. Come in.

386
00:29:56,981 --> 00:29:59,025
Victoria here. We copy you, Mactown.

387
00:29:59,108 --> 00:30:02,737
The approaching storm
has picked np speed and intensity.

388
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,115
We are sending you the coordinates.
Mactown ont.

389
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:09,035
Copy that, Mactown.
Over and out.

390
00:30:09,118 --> 00:30:11,287
Field base to Melbourne. Come in.

391
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:30,265
Whoa. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

392
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:33,268
Whoa! Easy there, team! Easy.

393
00:30:33,351 --> 00:30:34,811
What's up?

394
00:30:34,894 --> 00:30:37,480
I got to do a patch job
on one of the kids.

395
00:30:37,563 --> 00:30:39,941
Radio Katie.
See what's going on with that storm.

396
00:30:40,024 --> 00:30:40,984
All right.

397
00:30:43,486 --> 00:30:46,614
Ah, shoot. Looks like it's Old Jack.

398
00:30:46,698 --> 00:30:48,408
Come here, Jack.

399
00:30:49,284 --> 00:30:53,037
Field base, come in.

400
00:30:53,121 --> 00:30:54,872
- Field base, come in.
- All right.

401
00:30:54,956 --> 00:30:56,708
- We'll get you fixed up.
- Field base?

402
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:59,043
Got something in your paw?

403
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:01,546
This is Melbourne team calling.

404
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:03,506
Field base, can we get a...?

405
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,967
Doc!

406
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:17,520
Are you OK?

407
00:31:19,689 --> 00:31:21,899
I think I've broken my leg.

408
00:31:21,983 --> 00:31:24,986
All right. All right,
stay right there. I'll be right back!

409
00:31:27,905 --> 00:31:31,242
Whoa!

410
00:31:31,326 --> 00:31:34,287
Whoa! Wait, doc! Don't move!

411
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,623
Doc! Doc!

412
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:42,795
Doc! Hey! Don't tread water!

413
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:44,088
Don't tread water!

414
00:31:45,924 --> 00:31:48,092
Look at me! You see the ice? Davis.

415
00:31:48,176 --> 00:31:50,178
Grab the ice!
It'll freeze you to it!

416
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:53,181
It takes you a lot longer to freeze
than it does to drown!

417
00:31:58,144 --> 00:32:00,563
Good, good!
Davis, hang on! I'm coming down!

418
00:32:07,028 --> 00:32:09,197
All right, kids, come on!

419
00:32:14,452 --> 00:32:15,703
Hang on, doc!

420
00:32:24,003 --> 00:32:26,172
Maya, come here.

421
00:32:26,256 --> 00:32:28,591
I can't... I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

422
00:32:28,633 --> 00:32:30,635
Take deep breaths, doc.

423
00:32:34,138 --> 00:32:35,848
Maya, take the rope.

424
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:38,476
Go to doc.

425
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,273
She's coming to you, doc.
She's coming to you.

426
00:32:43,314 --> 00:32:46,276
OK, Maya, down.

427
00:32:46,317 --> 00:32:47,819
Good girl. Crawl to the doc.

428
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:00,665
Come on, Maya, I got you. It's OK.

429
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:05,128
Come on, doc, stay in there with me.

430
00:33:05,837 --> 00:33:07,255
Come on, Maya.

431
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:11,968
Easy, Maya. Easy.

432
00:33:14,345 --> 00:33:16,264
Good girl.

433
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:29,527
Good job, Maya. Put the line over him.

434
00:33:29,611 --> 00:33:32,071
Good girl. Doc.

435
00:33:32,155 --> 00:33:34,157
Keep your left arm
on the ice, like it is,

436
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,826
but I want you to reach up
with your right arm.

437
00:33:36,868 --> 00:33:39,746
You gotta get your elbow
and your arm up through the loop.

438
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:42,707
You can do it. There you go.

439
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:47,629
Good job, doc. Yeah, just like that.

440
00:33:47,712 --> 00:33:50,632
All right. Maya, come on.

441
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:56,346
Good girl, Maya. Good girl.

442
00:33:56,387 --> 00:34:00,224
I got you, doc. I got you.

443
00:34:00,308 --> 00:34:01,935
Keep it tight.

444
00:34:02,602 --> 00:34:03,853
Line 'em up, Maya!

445
00:34:06,356 --> 00:34:09,776
Right now! Right now!
Come on! Take it home!

446
00:34:13,947 --> 00:34:15,490
Line up! Hike!

447
00:34:15,573 --> 00:34:18,534
Come on, Maya! Come on, Old Jack!

448
00:34:19,535 --> 00:34:22,330
Come on, kids!

449
00:34:24,832 --> 00:34:27,418
Hike!

450
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:34,384
All right, doc, you hang in there, OK?

451
00:34:34,467 --> 00:34:36,511
We're gonna get you home. All right?

452
00:34:36,594 --> 00:34:38,721
Don't you worry.

453
00:34:38,763 --> 00:34:41,766
- I'm gonna get you back.
- I'm sorry.

454
00:34:41,808 --> 00:34:44,143
You're gonna get home
and see your family, doc.

455
00:34:44,227 --> 00:34:46,688
You're gonna see your son, all right?

456
00:35:04,956 --> 00:35:06,666
Come here, Maya.

457
00:35:06,749 --> 00:35:09,711
Maya, you got to get us home!
Get us home!

458
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:18,678
Go get up there, Max! Maya needs you!

459
00:35:21,431 --> 00:35:25,518
Right now! Right now! Hike! Hike!

460
00:35:45,913 --> 00:35:48,916
I can fly in this, Andy. You know I can.

461
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,462
Sorry, Katie. It's not a question
of whether you could fly in it,

462
00:35:52,545 --> 00:35:54,797
but whether you could see anything.

463
00:35:54,881 --> 00:35:57,675
Don't worry, hon.
He's been in worse before.

464
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:59,886
Worse than this?

465
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:07,268
What?

466
00:36:46,057 --> 00:36:48,685
Base to Melbourne team. Come in?

467
00:36:49,686 --> 00:36:51,854
Base to Melbourne. Come in.

468
00:36:51,938 --> 00:36:55,275
This is Katie. Please, come in.

469
00:36:56,234 --> 00:37:00,113
Jerry, do you copy? Over.

470
00:37:01,197 --> 00:37:04,033
Base out.

471
00:37:22,885 --> 00:37:25,179
Good, kids.

472
00:38:01,674 --> 00:38:05,136
About three here, right?

473
00:38:22,236 --> 00:38:24,697
Andy! Coop! Come on, they're here!

474
00:38:31,621 --> 00:38:34,791
Jerry! Jer, are you all right?

475
00:38:34,832 --> 00:38:37,835
He's got a broken leg!
And he's been in the water!

476
00:38:37,919 --> 00:38:39,879
- Get the stretcher now!
- Got it!

477
00:38:41,422 --> 00:38:43,633
- I don't like that cough.
- Get the dogs.

478
00:38:43,675 --> 00:38:46,052
Look at those hands! Get him in!

479
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:48,137
- Come on, Jerry.
- Let's go!

480
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:52,183
Good team. Good team.

481
00:38:53,518 --> 00:38:55,728
Good girl, Maya!

482
00:38:55,812 --> 00:38:58,940
You got us home.

483
00:39:01,693 --> 00:39:03,820
All right,
let's have a look at this leg.

484
00:39:03,861 --> 00:39:06,823
Rosemary. Hypothermia kit.

485
00:39:06,864 --> 00:39:10,034
Put your hands in there.
We'll bring 'em back nice and slow.

486
00:39:10,118 --> 00:39:12,620
Hey. Buddy, how you feeling?

487
00:39:12,704 --> 00:39:15,290
- How are the dogs?
- Uh, good. I just fed them.

488
00:39:15,373 --> 00:39:18,334
- Get the rock off the sled too.
- The rock?

489
00:39:18,418 --> 00:39:21,713
- He found what he was looking for?
- Of course. He had a good guide.

490
00:39:21,796 --> 00:39:23,881
Soon as you can, get that plane ready.

491
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:27,885
Dr. McClaren could lose this leg
without proper medical attention.

492
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:31,681
- What are we gonna do about the dogs?
- There's only so much we can carry.

493
00:39:31,723 --> 00:39:34,309
I did speak to Mactown.
The winter team is ready to go.

494
00:39:34,392 --> 00:39:36,603
Katie can fly right back,
bring the dogs out.

495
00:39:36,686 --> 00:39:39,439
I'll wait here and, uh,
I'll fly out with the dogs later.

496
00:39:39,522 --> 00:39:43,109
No, that's out of the question.
That could be stage three frostbite

497
00:39:43,192 --> 00:39:46,070
and heaven knows what nerve damage
has already been done.

498
00:39:46,154 --> 00:39:49,866
Jerry, he's right.
I'll come right back. I promise.

499
00:39:49,907 --> 00:39:52,285
Let's get ready to pull out of here.

500
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,706
Take them out.

501
00:39:56,789 --> 00:39:58,958
Watch his head.
Jer. I need some help.

502
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:01,836
Be careful with that leg.

503
00:40:05,757 --> 00:40:08,343
Knock down the stretcher,
Rosemary.

504
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:12,180
Coop. Coop, come help me
tighten the dogs' collars

505
00:40:12,263 --> 00:40:14,849
so they don't get loose.
Come on. Max! Come on!

506
00:40:14,933 --> 00:40:16,726
Good boy, Max.

507
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:24,317
Come on, buddy. Come here.

508
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:29,489
Come here, Max. Come here, Max.

509
00:40:29,572 --> 00:40:32,241
- Come here.
- Good boy. Good boy, Max.

510
00:40:32,283 --> 00:40:35,036
- All right. Here we go.
- Won't be long.

511
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,163
Easy, Max. Easy.

512
00:40:37,246 --> 00:40:39,999
- Let's get the other ones.
- All right.

513
00:40:41,751 --> 00:40:43,753
Hang in there, big guy.

514
00:40:50,677 --> 00:40:52,804
That's the last of 'em.

515
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,390
All right, Maya.

516
00:40:55,473 --> 00:40:58,768
You keep 'em in line, all right,
and I'll be back. I promise.

517
00:40:58,851 --> 00:41:01,312
Be good. That's my girl!

518
00:41:31,801 --> 00:41:34,596
All right, buckle tight.
This one's gonna be rough.

519
00:41:37,223 --> 00:41:41,144
- Coop, I know you got that fear...
- Major... major fear of flying? Yeah.

520
00:43:51,649 --> 00:43:53,234
Ugh.

521
00:44:14,756 --> 00:44:15,757
Hey.

522
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,675
Hey!

523
00:44:18,009 --> 00:44:19,969
Finally.

524
00:44:20,845 --> 00:44:22,180
Oh, man.

525
00:44:22,263 --> 00:44:25,016
Oh, you...
you are so lucky you passed out.

526
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:26,100
We...

527
00:44:26,184 --> 00:44:28,144
We were bouncing around up there, man,

528
00:44:28,186 --> 00:44:30,897
like one of those beach balls
at Dodger Stadium.

529
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:34,150
And Katie was yelling at me
the whole time to stop screaming,

530
00:44:34,192 --> 00:44:36,986
but, uh, I couldn't do it.
It was way too intense, man.

531
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,905
It was crazy.

532
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:41,449
Where is everybody?

533
00:44:41,532 --> 00:44:43,952
Right here.
Everyone's here at Mactown.

534
00:44:44,035 --> 00:44:46,454
Davis is good. Uh, you're good.

535
00:44:46,537 --> 00:44:49,290
Your hands... You still have
your hands, which is good.

536
00:44:49,374 --> 00:44:51,876
Everything's...
everything's all good, man.

537
00:44:52,335 --> 00:44:54,379
Did Katie get the dogs OK?

538
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,215
Yeah, well, um...

539
00:44:57,298 --> 00:44:59,968
Uh...

540
00:45:00,885 --> 00:45:03,930
Uh... No.

541
00:45:04,013 --> 00:45:06,933
They were telling her
that-that she should wait, maybe,

542
00:45:07,016 --> 00:45:09,269
you know, until things got better.

543
00:45:09,644 --> 00:45:13,356
Jer? It's been snowing
since we got here, man.

544
00:45:16,526 --> 00:45:18,069
Dude...

545
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:27,370
Hey. You're finally up.

546
00:45:28,913 --> 00:45:31,249
- How are your hands feeling?
- They're fine.

547
00:45:31,332 --> 00:45:34,544
- How soon can we go back?
- I think you should get some rest, OK?

548
00:45:34,586 --> 00:45:35,670
No, Katie. How soon?

549
00:45:35,753 --> 00:45:38,172
The weather's gotten worse.
No one's flying in.

550
00:45:38,256 --> 00:45:39,841
When is it gonna get better?

551
00:45:40,925 --> 00:45:45,388
They've canceled the winter teams.
No one's going in till spring.

552
00:45:55,106 --> 00:45:57,275
I need it now!

553
00:45:57,775 --> 00:45:58,943
Excuse me, commander?

554
00:45:59,027 --> 00:46:01,404
- Who are you?
- Jerry Shepard. I'm with NSF.

555
00:46:01,446 --> 00:46:03,364
- Andy Harrison's crew?
- Yeah.

556
00:46:03,448 --> 00:46:06,743
We need a plane to the field base.
We weren't entirely evacuated.

557
00:46:06,784 --> 00:46:09,454
What? I ordered everybody
out of there yesterday.

558
00:46:09,537 --> 00:46:12,248
No, not everybody.
We left eight dogs there, sir.

559
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:13,541
Dogs?

560
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:17,545
I've got over 200 people, ten winter
teams to evacuate to New Zealand.

561
00:46:17,629 --> 00:46:20,131
Right. These dogs
are a part of our team, NSF.

562
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:23,676
Captain, we've got a big problem
with some of the engines icing up.

563
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,556
- We have to start moving some planes.
- Son, look. This is today.

564
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,434
We've got a two-day window,
then another storm hits.

565
00:46:31,517 --> 00:46:33,603
If it lasts till here,
which they say it will,

566
00:46:33,686 --> 00:46:36,272
then we're into winter
and nobody flies.

567
00:46:36,314 --> 00:46:39,275
We don't have enough supplies
to keep everybody here.

568
00:46:39,317 --> 00:46:42,862
- So I'm a little busy right now.
- All we need is a plane, sir...

569
00:46:42,946 --> 00:46:45,281
- Do you want us to do that, sir?
- Do what?

570
00:46:45,323 --> 00:46:48,117
- Start moving some planes.
- Will you give me one minute?

571
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:53,456
Listen. If we could just get a plane
like the one that we flew in on,

572
00:46:53,498 --> 00:46:55,416
it would only take three hours.

573
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:58,962
Son, the only thing
we've got left are C-130s

574
00:46:59,003 --> 00:47:01,422
and they sure as hell
can't land at a field base.

575
00:47:02,966 --> 00:47:05,385
We can't just leave 'em out there.

576
00:47:06,678 --> 00:47:09,472
There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry.

577
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:15,103
- Let's start moving those planes.
- Yes, sir, right away, captain.

578
00:47:23,278 --> 00:47:26,531
Yeah, come in.

579
00:47:27,699 --> 00:47:29,158
Hey.

580
00:47:29,909 --> 00:47:32,161
How we doing?

581
00:47:32,203 --> 00:47:35,331
When's your flight leave?
You and Rosie?

582
00:47:35,373 --> 00:47:38,334
A couple hours ahead of you,
Coop and the doc.

583
00:47:40,587 --> 00:47:42,797
Jerry, I'm so sorry.

584
00:47:43,548 --> 00:47:45,675
I'm really sorry, Jerry.

585
00:47:45,717 --> 00:47:47,844
I don't want to talk about it.
You want a drink?

586
00:47:49,178 --> 00:47:50,346
Sure.

587
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:58,646
- Fresca.
- Yeah, sorry. That's all I got.

588
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:02,859
You know this wasn't your fault.
This wasn't anybody's fault.

589
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,778
- We just left 'em there.
- Come on. We didn't just leave them.

590
00:48:05,862 --> 00:48:08,906
Don't do this to yourself.
The dogs are strong.

591
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:10,366
Maybe there's a chance.

592
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,703
We tightened their collars
so they wouldn't get loose.

593
00:48:16,748 --> 00:48:18,708
Listen, I...

594
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:20,418
I know...

595
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:24,213
I know you want me to find
a way to get us back there somehow.

596
00:48:24,255 --> 00:48:26,174
I know you're disappointed in me.

597
00:48:28,468 --> 00:48:30,094
No.

598
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:37,560
You know, sometimes you just
have to lower your expectations.

599
00:48:48,112 --> 00:48:50,949
You know what, Jerry?
I'm sorry. I really am.

600
00:48:53,201 --> 00:48:54,953
I've got to go pack.

601
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:08,192
Fill this out. Take it down to admin.
Just follow the red line on the floor.

602
00:50:08,276 --> 00:50:10,820
With any luck, you could
have some funding by August.

603
00:50:10,903 --> 00:50:12,905
August?

604
00:50:12,989 --> 00:50:16,534
No, wait. I don't think you understand.
ln a few days those dogs...

605
00:50:16,618 --> 00:50:17,952
I have to go now.

606
00:50:18,036 --> 00:50:20,830
I'm sorry, Mr. Shepard.
Once winter sets in,

607
00:50:20,872 --> 00:50:24,125
as you know, there's no
coming or goings down there.

608
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:26,586
We had to cancel
the winter teams this year.

609
00:50:26,669 --> 00:50:31,132
- Couldn't get 'em in before the storm.
- There must be somebody going south.

610
00:50:31,215 --> 00:50:36,262
Mr. Shepard, be reasonable. This is
the biggest Antarctic storm in 25 years.

611
00:50:36,346 --> 00:50:39,682
If you don't believe me,
take a look at this weather report.

612
00:52:21,618 --> 00:52:24,996
Yeah, good, good.

613
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:27,790
- Where's the rocket going?
- What a surprise!

614
00:52:27,874 --> 00:52:29,667
- To Mars, Dad.
- Come on in.

615
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:31,210
Yeah?

616
00:52:31,294 --> 00:52:32,962
Well, look who I found.

617
00:52:33,671 --> 00:52:36,132
Hey. Hey, world traveler.

618
00:52:36,174 --> 00:52:38,009
- How you been?
- I'm good, I'm good.

619
00:52:38,092 --> 00:52:40,553
- How's your fingers?
- Oh, I get to keep 'em.

620
00:52:40,637 --> 00:52:41,804
- Great.
- How's the leg?

621
00:52:41,846 --> 00:52:44,849
Hard to tell. The cast is
coming along great, thanks to Eric.

622
00:52:44,933 --> 00:52:47,143
There's a pot of coffee
in the kitchen, so...

623
00:52:47,226 --> 00:52:49,395
Eric, let's go find
a real coloring book.

624
00:52:49,479 --> 00:52:51,564
- What a great surprise.
- Give you a hand?

625
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:53,149
- No, I'm all right.
- You got it?

626
00:52:53,232 --> 00:52:56,444
So, what brings you to LA?

627
00:52:57,654 --> 00:52:59,656
I brought you something.

628
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,666
Thanks.

629
00:53:09,749 --> 00:53:12,877
I gotta get back there. Right now.

630
00:53:13,544 --> 00:53:17,924
I can't sleep at night. I've been
to NSF, agencies, foundations.

631
00:53:18,007 --> 00:53:21,261
I've been to TV networks to convince
them to follow me with a camera.

632
00:53:21,344 --> 00:53:24,722
Anything to raise money.
It just... It all takes too long.

633
00:53:24,806 --> 00:53:28,393
Now I've only got one week to get
back down there before winter hits.

634
00:53:28,476 --> 00:53:32,981
Then no one gets in for six months.
You've got those guys in your pocket.

635
00:53:33,064 --> 00:53:35,608
The, uh, the science fund guys.

636
00:53:35,692 --> 00:53:39,487
- The university endowment?
- They'd do anything for you right now.

637
00:53:40,321 --> 00:53:43,491
- Jerry, listen to what you're saying.
- No, it would just be me,

638
00:53:43,574 --> 00:53:45,868
just a three-day trip in.
You could tell 'em.

639
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:49,831
- Tell 'em I'm scouting your next trip.
- They'd be throwing their money away.

640
00:53:49,914 --> 00:53:52,834
- No, they wouldn't.
- Even if you could get down there,

641
00:53:52,917 --> 00:53:54,377
- by now it's 50 below.
- No.

642
00:53:54,419 --> 00:53:57,547
Jerry, be realistic.
It's already been...

643
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,466
I know how long it's been.

644
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:03,636
But I need to know for sure.
I have to go.

645
00:54:04,262 --> 00:54:07,223
It's not possible, Jerry.

646
00:54:08,266 --> 00:54:10,893
It's just not possible.

647
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:15,898
And you gotta find a way
to forget about all this.

648
00:54:17,191 --> 00:54:18,651
Forget?

649
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,280
And you can do that?

650
01:00:51,336 --> 01:00:53,838
Hey, Jer. It's Kate.

651
01:00:53,922 --> 01:00:56,299
It's been a week.
Jnst checking if you're home yet.

652
01:00:56,382 --> 01:00:59,636
Bye.

653
01:01:01,638 --> 01:01:05,183
Jer, it's Kate again.
Call me back. Bye.

654
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:04,459
Over here.

655
01:07:06,127 --> 01:07:08,463
All right, the ocean
has a mind of its own.

656
01:07:09,172 --> 01:07:11,591
So respect the ocean. Stay alert.

657
01:07:13,092 --> 01:07:16,137
Now, go on ahead and take the paddle
like this, in both hands.

658
01:07:18,681 --> 01:07:21,601
There you go.
We're gonna do an even paddle,

659
01:07:21,643 --> 01:07:24,604
alternating blades.

660
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,607
Like that.

661
01:07:29,484 --> 01:07:31,611
Hey, Al, will you take over for me?

662
01:07:36,908 --> 01:07:38,993
Hey, what are you doing here?

663
01:07:39,077 --> 01:07:42,622
Somebody told me Jerry Shepard
was working at the kiddie pool.

664
01:07:42,705 --> 01:07:46,084
I said, "No way.
I have to see that for myself."

665
01:07:46,167 --> 01:07:48,419
ls that why you're here?
You're here to mock me?

666
01:07:48,461 --> 01:07:51,965
I'm the chauffeur.
Somebody else wanted to see you.

667
01:07:52,048 --> 01:07:55,927
Brandy! Come here. Go see Jerry!

668
01:07:57,971 --> 01:07:58,972
Wow.

669
01:07:59,055 --> 01:08:02,850
- Look who's all grown up and beautiful.
- She's smart too. Just like you said.

670
01:08:02,934 --> 01:08:06,437
ls she? Let's see
how well she's got you trained, then.

671
01:08:08,147 --> 01:08:10,650
Go get it!

672
01:08:14,821 --> 01:08:17,365
She's looking good.

673
01:08:17,448 --> 01:08:20,201
But I'm still not sure
what you're doing here.

674
01:08:20,285 --> 01:08:23,496
Come on. You didn't return my calls.
I got worried.

675
01:08:23,538 --> 01:08:27,834
- I've been busy.
- Oh, yeah, I can see that.

676
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:30,587
What about you?
What have you been up to?

677
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:33,840
Nothing much. I'm seeing somebody.

678
01:08:35,842 --> 01:08:37,552
- Really.
- Yeah, I mean,

679
01:08:37,635 --> 01:08:41,139
I'm not seeing him for long,
but I kind of like him.

680
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:45,476
He's such the opposite of us.
A complete head guy.

681
01:08:45,518 --> 01:08:47,937
He's an engineer.

682
01:08:48,563 --> 01:08:50,440
Like on a train?

683
01:08:50,898 --> 01:08:52,609
Shut up.

684
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:58,156
- Yeah.
- Good girl.

685
01:09:01,075 --> 01:09:04,120
Go, Brandy!

686
01:09:09,208 --> 01:09:13,046
So I heard you pulled yourself
off the McKinley expedition.

687
01:09:14,422 --> 01:09:17,342
Listen, I know leaving the dogs
was hard for you.

688
01:09:17,383 --> 01:09:20,720
Well, it is what it is.
There's really nothing to talk about.

689
01:09:20,803 --> 01:09:22,889
Nothing to talk about? Jerry, come on.

690
01:09:22,972 --> 01:09:24,724
I don't want to talk about it.

691
01:09:25,391 --> 01:09:27,477
You can't just keep
hiding out here, Jerry.

692
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,897
I mean, come on.
Renting kayaks to nine-year-olds?

693
01:09:32,398 --> 01:09:35,026
Well, what am I supposed
to do then, huh?

694
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:38,488
Maybe you can help me out or something
'cause I'm not sure anymore.

695
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:43,243
You know what you're supposed to do?
Let yourself off the hook.

696
01:09:43,284 --> 01:09:46,454
It doesn't mean that you have to forget.

697
01:10:39,966 --> 01:10:41,884
He knows a dog person
when he smells one.

698
01:10:41,968 --> 01:10:43,970
Hey, Mindo.

699
01:10:44,053 --> 01:10:46,639
- How you doing? Easy trip?
- Yeah, it wasn't bad.

700
01:10:46,723 --> 01:10:49,142
- Appreciate you seeing me.
- My pleasure.

701
01:10:49,225 --> 01:10:51,102
You're part of the family.

702
01:10:51,978 --> 01:10:54,689
Here. I thought you'd like to have this.

703
01:10:55,481 --> 01:10:57,984
Thanks. Come on in.

704
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:12,749
So, you came to apologize, hmm?

705
01:11:14,709 --> 01:11:16,377
I just knew...

706
01:11:17,128 --> 01:11:19,839
I just knew that you raised 'em.

707
01:11:19,881 --> 01:11:24,677
You don't have to apologize to me.
It's not about being sorry for anything.

708
01:11:27,013 --> 01:11:28,348
What is it then?

709
01:11:32,685 --> 01:11:35,605
Back when I was a young man,

710
01:11:35,688 --> 01:11:39,984
my father ran a team of sled dogs
up in the Yukon.

711
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:44,656
One summer he was out in the bush
walking with six of them.

712
01:11:45,406 --> 01:11:50,370
They came across a grizzly bear.
Young, but big.

713
01:11:50,411 --> 01:11:54,165
The first thing he did was maul
my father within an inch of his life.

714
01:11:54,207 --> 01:11:57,669
When he came to,
he saw that two of his dogs

715
01:11:57,710 --> 01:12:01,297
had been killed trying to save him.
The rest were gone.

716
01:12:02,423 --> 01:12:06,970
When he regained his strength,
he went out looking for his dogs.

717
01:12:07,053 --> 01:12:08,972
He said he had to.

718
01:12:11,849 --> 01:12:14,519
You know why I told you this story?

719
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:19,565
Because I won't find my dogs.

720
01:12:20,275 --> 01:12:23,695
The story's not about the dogs.
It's about my father

721
01:12:23,736 --> 01:12:26,030
honoring what the dogs
had done for him.

722
01:12:27,657 --> 01:12:29,909
Jerry, what's important

723
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:34,122
is finding that one thing
that will truly put your heart at rest.

724
01:15:23,207 --> 01:15:24,834
And now...

725
01:15:24,918 --> 01:15:27,462
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
please join with me

726
01:15:27,545 --> 01:15:31,925
in welcoming and honoring
the man who five months ago

727
01:15:31,966 --> 01:15:36,179
brought back from Antarctica
the first documented Mercury meteorite,

728
01:15:36,262 --> 01:15:37,889
Dr. Davis McClaren.

729
01:15:46,022 --> 01:15:48,608
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

730
01:15:49,943 --> 01:15:53,279
Thank you very much. There are
several people I wish to thank,

731
01:15:53,321 --> 01:15:55,782
but first and most important,
my family,

732
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:58,910
my son, Eric,
and my wife, Dr. Eve McClaren,

733
01:15:58,993 --> 01:16:03,248
for her patience as I travel
around the world on these expeditions,

734
01:16:03,289 --> 01:16:06,793
many of which could be better
described as wild-goose chases.

735
01:16:08,086 --> 01:16:11,297
Um, I'd like to thank the university
for its continued support.

736
01:16:11,381 --> 01:16:13,633
I'd also like to take a moment

737
01:16:13,716 --> 01:16:18,346
to thank the entire team
at the NSF base,

738
01:16:18,429 --> 01:16:22,225
without whom this discovery

739
01:16:22,308 --> 01:16:26,562
and this scientist
would not have made it home.

740
01:16:37,156 --> 01:16:41,411
Thanks. Thanks.
Excuse me one second.

741
01:16:41,494 --> 01:16:43,121
- Thanks.
- Yeah, thanks. Hey.

742
01:16:43,204 --> 01:16:46,332
- There he is.
- Yeah. Scotch, rocks, please.

743
01:16:46,416 --> 01:16:48,793
The man of the hour. Congratulations.

744
01:16:48,835 --> 01:16:52,589
Well, I'm glad you could make it.
I wasn't sure you were gonna come down.

745
01:16:52,672 --> 01:16:54,299
Yeah.

746
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:55,883
You know, about that...

747
01:16:55,967 --> 01:16:58,344
Last time I saw you,

748
01:16:58,428 --> 01:17:01,472
I tried to make my problems yours.
I shouldn't have done that.

749
01:17:01,556 --> 01:17:04,851
But it was hard to accept
that I couldn't get back to the dogs.

750
01:17:06,269 --> 01:17:08,187
So, where are you with all of that?

751
01:17:08,938 --> 01:17:10,690
Uh...

752
01:17:10,732 --> 01:17:13,401
Actually, I'm heading
to New Zealand later on tonight.

753
01:17:14,903 --> 01:17:17,363
So, you found a way back down?

754
01:17:17,405 --> 01:17:19,699
Part of the way.
I'll make it to Christchurch

755
01:17:19,782 --> 01:17:24,454
and if you hang out there long enough,
usually you can find a ride south.

756
01:17:24,537 --> 01:17:26,956
And if you don't?

757
01:17:29,042 --> 01:17:32,629
Well, it's, uh, like you said
to me the day that storm came in.

758
01:17:32,712 --> 01:17:35,089
You gotta take chances
for things you care about.

759
01:17:35,798 --> 01:17:37,550
Davis?

760
01:17:38,885 --> 01:17:42,013
Yeah, yeah. Just...
I'll be right with you.

761
01:17:42,055 --> 01:17:43,598
Go ahead, get back to the party.

762
01:17:43,681 --> 01:17:46,893
I wanna come in
and say congratulations once again.

763
01:17:46,976 --> 01:17:49,145
- Sure. Thanks for coming.
- You're welcome.

764
01:17:49,228 --> 01:17:52,398
- Give my best to your family.
- I will. And good luck, really.

765
01:17:52,482 --> 01:17:53,733
Thanks.

766
01:17:54,984 --> 01:17:57,111
Enjoy the evening.

767
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:13,544
- Sitter says he's been down since 8:00.
- Oh, great.

768
01:18:13,586 --> 01:18:16,923
Which means he'll be up at 5:00.

769
01:18:21,803 --> 01:18:23,638
Hey, little man.

770
01:25:03,037 --> 01:25:05,206
- Hello.
- Hi.

771
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:07,584
ls your boat for hire?

772
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:10,420
- For what?
- I gotta get to McMurdo.

773
01:25:10,503 --> 01:25:13,339
Not a chance, mate.
It's a fishing boat.

774
01:25:13,423 --> 01:25:15,550
Looking for someone, you know Bailies?

775
01:25:15,633 --> 01:25:18,177
- Yeah.
- It's just up there. It's a bar.

776
01:25:18,261 --> 01:25:22,515
- All right, thanks. No chance, huh?
- Not in hell.

777
01:25:23,891 --> 01:25:26,728
You want me to take you
to Antarctica in the dead of winter

778
01:25:26,811 --> 01:25:28,313
on a 70-foot fishing trawler?

779
01:25:28,354 --> 01:25:32,066
Mm-hm. And I can pay you.
Not a lot, but everything I have.

780
01:25:32,150 --> 01:25:35,987
I'm sorry, mate. Everybody is looking
for a cheap ride out to McMurdo.

781
01:25:36,029 --> 01:25:38,156
Basically,
my boat's a margarita blender.

782
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:40,617
First chunk of ice we hit,
we'll break in half.

783
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:42,493
I've seen your boat. We can make it.

784
01:25:42,535 --> 01:25:45,788
- I'm desperate. You're my last option.
- No one in their right mind

785
01:25:45,872 --> 01:25:48,124
will take you in anything
but an icebreaker.

786
01:25:48,207 --> 01:25:51,878
Excuse me, sir.
The lady at the bar bought you a drink.

787
01:26:01,554 --> 01:26:04,182
No way. Excuse me.

788
01:26:07,727 --> 01:26:09,062
What are you doing here?

789
01:26:09,145 --> 01:26:12,190
Ah, some guy needed a cheap pilot
for an expedition

790
01:26:12,273 --> 01:26:14,150
and I'm always cheap in the off season.

791
01:26:14,234 --> 01:26:15,860
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

792
01:26:16,611 --> 01:26:18,905
- Good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.

793
01:26:19,906 --> 01:26:23,409
- So, where are you going?
- Same place I'm going.

794
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,539
What the hell?

795
01:26:28,623 --> 01:26:31,292
- What's up, Jer?
- What's going on, buddy?

796
01:26:31,376 --> 01:26:33,253
- Hey, buddy. Aw!
- How you been?

797
01:26:33,336 --> 01:26:34,921
- Nice to see you.
- I missed you.

798
01:26:35,004 --> 01:26:37,090
Same here.

799
01:26:37,173 --> 01:26:40,009
What's really going on?
What kind of expedition is this?

800
01:26:40,093 --> 01:26:43,096
Uh, that'd be an NSF expedition.

801
01:26:43,179 --> 01:26:45,348
Yeah, I had a trip that was cut short.

802
01:26:45,431 --> 01:26:48,935
It turns out I got a couple of weeks
of grant money left and, uh...

803
01:26:49,018 --> 01:26:50,436
- Uh-huh.
- So here we are.

804
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:52,772
You're the man. You are the man.

805
01:26:52,814 --> 01:26:55,024
How long you think
it'll take you to pack?

806
01:26:55,108 --> 01:26:59,279
- You know me, I'm always packed.
- Well, this way.

807
01:26:59,362 --> 01:27:02,031
Yeah! Yeah.

808
01:27:02,115 --> 01:27:03,366
Let's go! Let's go!

809
01:27:09,539 --> 01:27:10,957
Come on in, boys.

810
01:27:13,459 --> 01:27:15,795
- Whoo!
- This is crazy. I never expected this.

811
01:27:15,878 --> 01:27:18,214
Sometimes you gotta
raise your expectations.

812
01:27:24,304 --> 01:27:26,556
- Cooper, how you doing?
- I'd rather not talk.

813
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:28,266
- OK.
- Thanks.

814
01:28:49,055 --> 01:28:53,309
Polarsyssel, this is helicopter
Lima-November-Oscar-Mike-Bravo

815
01:28:53,393 --> 01:28:55,019
requesting to land on your vessel.

816
01:28:55,103 --> 01:28:57,438
Roger,
Lima-November-Oscar-Mike-Bravo.

817
01:28:57,522 --> 01:28:59,941
- You're clear to land.
- Here we go, boys.

818
01:29:51,659 --> 01:29:54,203
- Hey.
- Hey.

819
01:29:57,206 --> 01:29:59,500
I thought you might like some company.

820
01:29:59,584 --> 01:30:01,544
Sure.

821
01:30:04,923 --> 01:30:07,717
It's a
good night for stargazing.

822
01:30:13,348 --> 01:30:16,059
Shooting stars
mean good luck, right?

823
01:30:18,019 --> 01:30:19,604
Jerry, you know,

824
01:30:19,646 --> 01:30:22,690
this may not be easy, what we find.

825
01:30:22,774 --> 01:30:24,984
I know that.

826
01:30:25,068 --> 01:30:28,196
But whatever we find,
the dogs deserve this trip.

827
01:30:31,658 --> 01:30:35,286
I'm glad you're here, Katie.
And I owe you one.

828
01:30:36,829 --> 01:30:40,917
You owe me for a lot of things.
This is not one of them.

829
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,002
No, I'm serious.

830
01:30:43,086 --> 01:30:45,129
You always understood
why I had to do this.

831
01:30:48,841 --> 01:30:50,593
Careful, Jerry.

832
01:30:50,677 --> 01:30:52,845
You're starting to sound like a grownup.

833
01:30:54,973 --> 01:30:57,141
What about that
conductor friend of yours?

834
01:30:57,183 --> 01:31:00,144
- He's an engineer.
- Oh, yeah.

835
01:31:00,186 --> 01:31:02,772
We're not seeing each other anymore.

836
01:31:06,609 --> 01:31:08,570
That's too bad.

837
01:33:20,994 --> 01:33:24,622
Shut her down, Mr. Hansen.
Let's go take a look.

838
01:33:30,503 --> 01:33:32,714
What do you make of that?

839
01:33:32,797 --> 01:33:34,966
It's not good.

840
01:33:44,976 --> 01:33:47,645
The ice
is six feet about here.

841
01:33:52,525 --> 01:33:54,819
The ice is deeper than we thought.

842
01:33:54,861 --> 01:33:58,489
I guess we shouldn't be surprised,
given the winter we just had.

843
01:33:58,573 --> 01:34:01,868
Come halfway around the world
and we can't make it the last 100 miles.

844
01:34:03,161 --> 01:34:04,621
Sorry, mates.

845
01:34:04,704 --> 01:34:08,458
I guess now is last call
for a great idea.

846
01:34:09,709 --> 01:34:12,378
Simonetta.

847
01:34:12,462 --> 01:34:14,380
Simonetta who?

848
01:34:14,464 --> 01:34:17,717
His imaginary ltalian girlfriend.
Come on, not now.

849
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:20,595
An iceberg, all right,
broke off from an ice shelf.

850
01:34:20,678 --> 01:34:24,349
It blocked the route that the Adelie
penguins take for their fishing waters.

851
01:34:24,432 --> 01:34:27,727
- I'm not seeing the relevance.
- Horses, doc. Rein 'em in.

852
01:34:27,810 --> 01:34:31,105
Now, I needed to map the new route
so researchers could find 'em.

853
01:34:31,189 --> 01:34:36,194
While I was following them, they
led me right past the ltalian base...

854
01:34:36,277 --> 01:34:38,738
...where one Simonetta Pirelli

855
01:34:38,821 --> 01:34:41,491
whipped me up
a mean cup of hot chocolate.

856
01:34:41,574 --> 01:34:45,620
- Come on, what are you talking about?
- Step into my office.

857
01:34:47,747 --> 01:34:51,209
Our base is too far for the helicopter
to make it there, right?

858
01:34:51,292 --> 01:34:54,212
But the ltalian base is,
like, half the distance.

859
01:34:54,254 --> 01:34:57,090
- The young man's right about that.
- Still leaves us short.

860
01:34:57,173 --> 01:34:58,508
Right, right. Hold on. See,

861
01:34:58,591 --> 01:35:00,969
all field bases
have the same basic stuff, right?

862
01:35:01,052 --> 01:35:04,764
But the ltalian base is equipped
with the Lamborghini of snowcats.

863
01:35:04,847 --> 01:35:07,100
I'm telling you,
this thing is like a rocket.

864
01:35:07,141 --> 01:35:10,478
So we take one of these snowcats
to our base, do what we came to do,

865
01:35:10,562 --> 01:35:11,771
blow out of Dodge.

866
01:35:11,854 --> 01:35:14,857
And this way, I get to spend
a little less time flying.

867
01:35:14,941 --> 01:35:16,568
No offense, Katie.

868
01:35:16,651 --> 01:35:19,153
Huh?

869
01:35:24,284 --> 01:35:25,493
All right, let's go.

870
01:38:20,627 --> 01:38:22,754
Ah! Ah!

871
01:38:22,795 --> 01:38:26,007
Ah, there it is!

872
01:38:40,396 --> 01:38:43,441
The keys are in number two.
The shovels are around the side.

873
01:38:43,524 --> 01:38:45,318
We gotta dig this place out.

874
01:38:56,496 --> 01:38:58,206
It's hard.

875
01:39:21,688 --> 01:39:23,648
Sweet.

876
01:39:56,973 --> 01:39:58,850
All aboard!

877
01:39:58,892 --> 01:40:01,227
Nice snowcat, Coop.

878
01:40:14,032 --> 01:40:15,783
What?

879
01:40:20,914 --> 01:40:22,874
Not bad, huh, Jer?

880
01:40:22,916 --> 01:40:25,418
Well, what do you want me to say?
You're the man?

881
01:40:25,919 --> 01:40:27,462
That'd be nice.

882
01:40:28,755 --> 01:40:30,173
OK, you're the man.

883
01:40:31,090 --> 01:40:34,093
You are indeed the man, Cooper!
You are the man!

884
01:40:34,427 --> 01:40:36,262
Grazie, Geraldo. Grazie.

885
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:40,225
And as for you, Crazy Katie,

886
01:40:40,266 --> 01:40:43,394
you know all those ridiculous flights
you put me through?

887
01:40:43,436 --> 01:40:45,063
Yeah.

888
01:40:45,104 --> 01:40:48,441
Payback is a dish best served cold.

889
01:40:48,483 --> 01:40:51,110
- Cooper, I think that's "revenge."

890
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:14,147
It's Old Jack.

891
01:44:18,318 --> 01:44:21,446
We came all this way and they
didn't even make it off the chain.

892
01:45:06,699 --> 01:45:08,910
They got off.

893
01:45:12,664 --> 01:45:13,915
They got loose!

894
01:46:10,513 --> 01:46:12,473
Come on, kids!

895
01:46:12,557 --> 01:46:14,058
Come on!

896
01:46:21,608 --> 01:46:23,443
Come on, Max!

897
01:46:34,370 --> 01:46:35,872
Hey!

898
01:46:35,955 --> 01:46:37,957
Hey, Buck!

899
01:46:39,375 --> 01:46:40,960
Hey, Buck.

900
01:46:41,044 --> 01:46:42,712
Max, what you been doing?

901
01:46:42,795 --> 01:46:46,132
- OK, not the face! Not the face!
- No! You look so beautiful.

902
01:46:46,174 --> 01:46:49,260
OK, chill, boy! Chill, boy, not the...

903
01:46:49,344 --> 01:46:51,888
Good boy, Max. Good boy, Max.

904
01:46:57,101 --> 01:46:59,896
- Yeah...
- Told you we'd come back.

905
01:46:59,979 --> 01:47:02,106
Look at you guys. Huh?

906
01:47:02,148 --> 01:47:04,776
Shorty, come here.

907
01:47:04,817 --> 01:47:07,904
Not the... Hey, Jer!
A little help over here.

908
01:47:07,987 --> 01:47:09,614
A little help.

909
01:47:11,282 --> 01:47:13,743
Hey, Buck!
Leave him alone! Get over here!

910
01:47:15,536 --> 01:47:19,332
Whew! Thank you, Jer!

911
01:47:21,334 --> 01:47:22,543
Good boy, Buck.

912
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:27,257
Shadow, Truman, Max and Shorty.

913
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:29,676
Man, I don't believe it.

914
01:47:29,759 --> 01:47:31,803
Good boys.

915
01:47:31,844 --> 01:47:34,847
My five lucky stars.

916
01:47:37,517 --> 01:47:39,519
Almost perfect.

917
01:47:52,865 --> 01:47:54,951
Let's go home, kids. Come on.

918
01:47:58,746 --> 01:48:00,873
This should be enough
to get us home.

919
01:48:00,957 --> 01:48:03,876
- Give me a hand with this.
- OK.

920
01:48:06,713 --> 01:48:09,465
All right, Shorty, up!

921
01:48:09,549 --> 01:48:12,010
Good boy! Come on, Shadow, let's go.

922
01:48:12,093 --> 01:48:14,721
Come on, buddy.
Come on, let's go. Get in the back.

923
01:48:14,804 --> 01:48:18,141
Come on! We're losing light here.
Party's over, come on.

924
01:48:18,224 --> 01:48:20,018
All right, Max, come on, buddy.

925
01:48:21,978 --> 01:48:24,188
- Wanna ride up front?
- Have it your way.

926
01:48:24,230 --> 01:48:26,649
Let's go. Up front. Ride with me.

927
01:48:26,733 --> 01:48:28,359
Come on, buddy. Jump up.

928
01:48:30,069 --> 01:48:31,905
Max! Max!

929
01:48:31,988 --> 01:48:33,907
Max!

930
01:48:48,963 --> 01:48:50,381
Maya.

931
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:19,410
Aw, Maya.

932
01:49:19,494 --> 01:49:21,454
Come on now.

933
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:25,041
Come on now.

934
01:49:27,627 --> 01:49:29,963
You did good.

935
01:49:30,046 --> 01:49:32,799
You did good, Max. Good boy.

936
01:49:32,882 --> 01:49:35,093
You brought her home.

937
01:49:37,303 --> 01:49:38,763
I'm sorry, girl.

938
01:49:59,075 --> 01:50:00,952
Maya?

939
01:50:02,579 --> 01:50:04,289
Hey.

940
01:50:06,082 --> 01:50:08,126
There's my girl.

941
01:50:09,669 --> 01:50:11,629
You're OK.

942
01:50:16,676 --> 01:50:19,304
How's my best girl doing, huh?

943
01:50:19,387 --> 01:50:23,516
Good girl, Maya.
All right, let's get you home, OK?

944
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,143
Let's get you home.

945
01:50:31,983 --> 01:50:34,193
Coop. Coop.

946
01:50:55,423 --> 01:50:58,217
- She gonna be OK?
- Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

947
01:51:00,303 --> 01:51:03,223
What do you say, Coop?
Let's fire her up and get out of here.

948
01:51:03,306 --> 01:51:06,017
Yes, sir. I'll just make room
for one more.

949
01:51:06,059 --> 01:51:07,310
All right.

950
01:51:07,393 --> 01:51:10,230
Give me a hand here, Katie.
Let's get her in.

951
01:51:14,859 --> 01:51:17,028
Come here, Maya.

952
01:51:17,111 --> 01:51:19,989
- Got her? There you go.
- I think so.

953
01:51:20,073 --> 01:51:21,699
All right, Max. Let's go, buddy.

954
01:51:22,492 --> 01:51:25,245
Come on. Good boy.

955
01:51:34,879 --> 01:51:35,922
How's your girl?

956
01:51:40,843 --> 01:51:42,262
She's good.

957
01:52:05,118 --> 01:52:08,454
All right. Here we go.
