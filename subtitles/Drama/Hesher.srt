2
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,300
Hey, little out of the car.

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Get out of the car!

4
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,700
Get out of the car, go!

5
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,200
Hey brat, you can go get him out?

6
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,500
Go man, go out of the car ...

7
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,700
Opens.

8
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,500
Go out of there!

9
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,600
Fucking come out!

10
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,400
Brothel down the window!

11
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,700
Why did you sell the car?

12
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,200
We could not leave
front of the house, TJ.

13
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,100
Why?

14
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,500
- It's not healthy
- It's not!

15
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,100
I do not want to hear about it.

16
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,700
Well, hello.

17
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,600
Good morning.

18
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,200
I have money to buy
to eat today?

19
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,900
Uh, yeah, sorry.

20
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,600
Thank you.

21
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,900
Have a nice day, TJ.

22
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,400
Between go.
Get up.

23
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,900
Please ...

24
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,700
You just fuck me.

25
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,300
Who's there?

26
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Oh damn!

27
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,100
Cemino.

28
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,600
Cooper.

29
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,600
Forwood.

30
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,700
Edreden.

31
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,700
Fletcher.

32
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,600
Forney.
TJ Forney returned?

33
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,900
Welcome back, TJ.

34
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,100
Morrodger.

35
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,000
Sumner.

36
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,700
Well then, you're more like
a drive is it?

37
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,100
- Do not fuck ...
- And if you sucked my dick?

38
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,500
Suck my dick!
Suck my cock whore!

39
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,200
- Hello dear.
- Hi.

40
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,000
Did you have a good day?

41
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,300
It was horrible.

42
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Why is my angel?

43
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,000
I do not know, it sucked.

44
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,500
You want me t'allume light?

45
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,800
Why?
I seem to be in the dark?

46
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,300
I do not know, a little.

47
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,400
I think I need new glasses.

48
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,000
In fact I do not even know
if they are mine.

49
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,900
They are at that time?

50
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,400
I do not know.

51
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,000
You see better with?

52
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,400
I do not know.

53
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,100
Your father is up?

54
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,200
Why?
He slept all day?

55
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,100
You know, sometimes people are upset
When bad things happen.

56
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,000
But they resumed after.

57
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,500
Want some milk?

58
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,500
Yeah.

59
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,100
Ok, how's the arm?

60
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,600
We will turn a bit
your wrist, like this ...

61
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,600
In the other direction ...

62
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,200
Well.

63
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,500
Considering that the dreams
take a metaphorical role

64
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,000
in fiction as
they do in life,

65
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,700
how metaphorical function
these dreams are involved?

66
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,500
For an actor, are they
premonitions, or desires?

67
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Or maybe even nightmares?

68
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,200
Given what we know
About Mauritius:

69
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,900
where it comes from, how was her childhood,

70
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,800
I think we can assume
with certainty that his dreams

71
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,600
are a reflection of his relationship
with his mother.

72
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,000
TJ! What are you doing?

73
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,200
Bring me that.

74
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,800
Well, poor idiot!
You find that funny?

75
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,500
Sucking dick
you find that funny?

76
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,200
I'll tear your fucking head!

77
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,500
I'll kill you!

78
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,800
You think you can draw
on my car whore?

79
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,900
- Hey, loose it!
- Get out bitch!

80
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,900
- I said stop!

81
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,800
Well what do you do ma'am?

82
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,700
And you what do you do?

83
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,000
I have not finished with you,
little shit.

84
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,100
Are you okay?

85
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,900
I bleed?

86
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I think so.
And me?

87
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,300
You want me back?
Come on.

88
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,400
Come!

89
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,300
I can not believe it
called me "madam".

90
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,700
I have a mind to be called
"Madame" in your opinion?

91
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,900
I guess ...

92
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,700
Thank you.

93
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,200
I have to look old.

94
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,600
So I'm a little
Now a hero, huh?

95
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,300
In fact, I just thought the fact
that on returning home,

96
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,500
I could blame all
the day if I had not helped,

97
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,400
and see the information, that'd have
was beaten to death in a parking lot.

98
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,800
I just did for me in fact,
I am selfish.

99
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,300
Sorry.

100
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,600
Sorry to be like that.

101
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,400
That's it.

102
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,300
Over.

103
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,100
Eh! You do not want your bike?

104
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,700
Shit!

105
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,100
Glad to have met you.

106
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,300
Dad?

107
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,200
Dad?

108
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,900
Dad?

109
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,500
Grandma, where is it Dad?

110
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,000
Hi TJ, he went to the doctor.
Is everything okay?

111
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah.

112
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,800
Where's the washing machine?

113
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,500
- My father will return soon ...
- Where's the washing machine?

114
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,600
Why?

115
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,300
Have you ever been fucked in the mouth?

116
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,600
- No ...
- Love you be?

117
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,800
It's there.

118
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,100
But why, you can not ...

119
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
What are you doing?

120
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
What are you doing? ..

121
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,900
Why are you here?

122
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,200
You better treat me
as if I lived here.

123
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,900
Or I'll kill you.

124
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,600
And I kill your family.

125
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,700
You can not smoke here ...

126
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,800
What are you doing?
You can not smoke here.

127
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,400
You could turn it off, please?

128
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,200
And if I put out in your mouth?

129
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,900
TJ, who is it?

130
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,100
My name Hesher.
I am a friend of your son.

131
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,100
What's he doing here?

132
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,500
It is a laundry.

133
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,000
Can I talk a second?

134
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,800
Why he smokes in the house?

135
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,700
I told him he could not.

136
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,700
- A friend of yours?
- I said that ...

137
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
You know you have only four strings?

138
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,900
Hello, young man!

139
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,200
Hello, old lady.

140
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,100
Can I help you?

141
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,600
No, it's good.

142
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,200
Oh damn!

143
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,900
Shit!

144
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,900
For crying out loud ...

145
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,700
Now you have more channels.

146
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,800
- Why did you get?
- What?

147
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,900
- This is your room?
- No, the garage.

148
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,500
Your friend does not want dinner?

149
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,000
- There is no hunger.
- Are you sure?

150
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,800
Yes, I'm sure.

151
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,600
What it does
in the garage?

152
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,100
I do not know, I told him he
the guitar could do it.

153
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,000
Oh, it's darling, it's nice to have
again a little music in this house.

154
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,400
This is a new friend?

155
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,200
Yeah, if you like ...

156
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,700
Your grandfather played the harmonica
for a long time.

157
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,800
Sorry dear,
there is more milk.

158
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,200
I can make you
eggs if you want.

159
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,800
No thank you.

160
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,900
Would you like to go for a walk?

161
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,600
I can not, I have things to do.

162
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,200
I mean, later this afternoon.

163
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,200
I do not know, ask me when I return.

164
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,400
Okay.

165
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,300
I want to retrieve the car.

166
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,800
It is not for sale.

167
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,800
But I want to buy it,
when you want how much?

168
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,900
Sit down.

169
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,100
1800 dollars, not counting
Taxes, fees ...

170
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,800
-I can pay.
-On top of that,

171
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,400
you need a driver's license,
and I'm sure you have not.

172
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,200
You must have a certificate of insurance,
and I'm sure you do not have that.

173
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,700
And even if you had all this

174
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,300
I could not sell it to you because it is not for sale. Point.

175
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,600
Now if you could
let me work.

176
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,500
- Hello.
- Hi.

177
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,200
How are you?

178
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,100
Uh, I bought an ice cream.

179
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,300
It's too nice, thank you.

180
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,800
I bought it there.

181
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,000
Thank you.

182
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,000
- Hi.
- Hi!

183
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,700
That day I had prepared
a cherry pie.

184
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:37,700
Only then I realized I had
used a new product, Fluffo.

185
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,800
And I never reused.
I served the cake and then ...

186
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:50,400
it started to swell in their mouths,
they could not swallow it.

187
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,800
The fucking Fluffo.

188
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,600
TJ Hello, hello darling.

189
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,700
Who will walk with me tomorrow morning?

190
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,700
TJ?

191
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,500
I can not grandmother
I have to go to school tomorrow.

192
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:30,100
Okay, you're always welcome.

193
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
What?

194
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,800
The school?
Will work with your grandmother.

195
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,900
He is right TJ,
I would appreciate some company.

196
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,900
Of course.

197
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,800
Your grandmother's going to work
alone in the morning?

198
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,000
You can not lift your ass
an hour earlier?

199
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,500
And if she was raped?

200
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,000
What?

201
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,800
Have you not heard
the killer of the same?

202
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,100
- The killer of the same?
- Yeah killer ...

203
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,400
The killer of the same
killed 13 or 14 old.

204
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,400
He chokes with
their pants dirty.

205
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,800
I do not think it violates the
but the fingers and everything!

206
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,000
Ok, that's enough.

207
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,400
I say it like that.

208
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,300
Your grandmother needs to go walking
you should go.

209
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,300
To do that she is raped.

210
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,000
Why would anyone
would rape me?

211
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,200
Damn, I know.

212
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,400
But people do that.
There's some fucking tared out.

213
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,700
You've fucked my body,
kind of asshole!

214
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,900
Put your head in there,
eats the pellet!

215
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,300
Eat this fucking patch!

216
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,100
Let me go!

217
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,400
Eats the pellet motherfucker!

218
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,700
Are you ready?

219
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,700
I want to go.

220
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
This is for our good.

221
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,800
TJ, we'll be late.

222
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,400
Welcome to all in this group
help against pain.

223
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,500
My name is Meryl.

224
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,800
We will start
by us with

225
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,300
and briefly explain why we are here.

226
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,600
Hello, you want to start?

227
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,100
We are family Boulder.

228
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,600
My name is Colleen.
And this is my husband, Jack.

229
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,500
Our daughter Cynthia ...

230
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,400
was murdered last year.

231
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,000
She was the victim

232
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,400
a violent attack, unfair and foolish.

233
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,000
We're here because we need help.

234
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,800
We lost our baby.

235
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,400
Hello, my name is Jack.

236
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:38,200
As my wife said, we are here
for answers

237
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:44,200
and seek help
against this pain.

238
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Thank you.

239
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,900
Colleen and Jack
welcome.

240
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
Sir?

241
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,900
Well, okay.

242
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,300
My name is Paul Forney,
and this is my son TJ.

243
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:22,500
We are here because I lost
my wife, the mother of TJ,

244
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,400
there are nearly two months.

245
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,300
We're just trying to overcome
these things ...

246
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,600
and we are looking ...

247
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,800
advice ...

248
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,500
about these things.
So ... that's it.

249
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,200
Well. Hello Paul.

250
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,900
Hi TJ.

251
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,400
I understand how it is
difficult to lose her mother.

252
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,900
Would you introduce yourself?
Say a few words to the group?

253
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,100
What's your fucking problem?

254
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,500
- What did you fuck?
- And you, what's wrong?

255
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,200
This asshole took my head
above a urinal

256
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,800
And you're sat there
and you have watched.

257
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,800
Get out.

258
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,600
Get out of with my grandmother!
Bar yourself.

259
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,000
Let me go!

260
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:26,000
I'll get dressed.
Wait for me in front of my van, right?

261
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,000
We're going where?

262
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,900
We're going where?

263
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,300
What are we doing here?

264
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,700
We're going. Go.

265
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,500
What are you f-

266
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,200
What are we doing here?

267
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,400
What are you doing?
We're going!

268
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,500
Shit!

269
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,100
Come on, we're going.

270
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,500
What are you doing?

271
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,000
What is that? Wait, stop!

272
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,400
Stop! You can not ...

273
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,600
Are you crazy?

274
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,400
We're going.

275
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,800
Stop!

276
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,400
You enter.

277
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,400
No.

278
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,500
Shit! No, no, no.

279
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:45,500
We're going! We're going now!
Start from here!

280
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,400
Please, stop!
No, no, no!

281
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,700
It's wrong?

282
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,900
Go quickly let's go!

283
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,200
Hurry!

284
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,700
Shit!
It's closed! Open!

285
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,300
Opens the door is closed!
Open the door!

286
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,900
Oh damn! Eh, eh!

287
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,200
- Come into the van!
- No.

288
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,500
Damn, just in the van, now!

289
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,900
I'll go for it.

290
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,600
Guy?

291
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,400
Man, whore, it was great.

292
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You got robbed on at least two meters.

293
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,000
Ok, here we go.

294
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,700
Go.

295
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,200
Bonjour, Madame.
I'm from the police.

296
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,300
I need to speak with Thomas Forney.

297
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,500
- How?
- Thomas Forney, he there?

298
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,000
You are Thomas Forney?

299
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,800
Uh, yes.

300
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,900
We have a few questions to ask.

301
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,800
It's just a few questions, man.

302
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,200
- What?
- You can dress please?

303
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,700
Considers this as a warning.

304
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,200
Evidence or not,

305
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,400
you have our attention.

306
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,800
Turn your head to the right.

307
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,900
It is not good
us on the back.

308
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,200
What happened is a crime

309
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,700
that can make you stay
long time in prison.

310
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,200
It was you who did it?

311
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,300
- Not really.
- "Not really"?

312
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I have not.

313
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,000
You just said not really.
What does that mean not really?

314
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,700
I said that I had
not, right?

315
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,800
Just before, I asked you if you had
done, and you said not really.

316
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,800
I do not remember
of what I said.

317
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,100
Why would you do such a thing?

318
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,600
- You want a peanut?
- No.

319
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,700
So what did they want the chickens?

320
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,100
In your whore?

321
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,400
I do not know. Delving into your cavities?

322
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,800
Get out, ok?

323
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,700
- What they have done?
- They took my fingerprints mess!

324
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,800
Yeah, so what?

325
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,300
Leave me alone.

326
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,300
Okay, I'll go.
But on one condition.

327
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,200
Do you think she shaves her pussy?

328
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,300
What are you doing here?

329
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
What you are you doing here?
You're not doing the shopping.

330
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,200
Spy on you this chick.

331
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,600
- No.
- Yes I followed you.

332
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,900
- You want to do it?
- No!

333
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,400
Ah, good.
You can not kiss here.

334
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,200
You must be much closer.

335
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,300
What?

336
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,700
- You want to type it.
- Shut up.

337
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,200
Dude, there's nothing wrong
you want to type it.

338
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,100
Stop saying that.

339
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,600
Dude! If you want to type it,
there is nothing wrong with that, do not be ashamed!

340
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,600
The man clap vaginas
for hundreds of years.

341
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,600
Probably more.

342
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,400
Dude, there's nothing wrong
to want the pussy!

343
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,300
Where are you going?

344
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,100
- My Home.
- I brought you.

345
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,700
No thank you.

346
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,400
Well, okay, but you there will be
in 5 minutes with me ...

347
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,500
In cycling, you there will be
what, fifteen minutes?

348
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,900
Okay, but not talk to me, ok?

349
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I will say nothing.

350
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
Listen dude.

351
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,000
Sorry for the fire the other night

352
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:29,600
it was completely out of
control, stupid and irresponsible.

353
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,700
So sorry.

354
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,000
Hey, I want to give you that.

355
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,100
I do not want.

356
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,600
Dude, you're gay?

357
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,300
I understand you.

358
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,700
Shit ...

359
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
What are you doing?

360
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,600
Stop the car, I want out.

361
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,600
If you go out of the van, I tear the cock
and I kiss for you.

362
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,300
It's crap.

363
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,900
I'm really sorry,
I do not know what happened.

364
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,600
You blew my bumper,
poor bitch!

365
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,700
It's not true! You are a dirty brutalized!

366
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,900
You are really stupid!
What is your problem?

367
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,800
I do not know what
happened, sir ...

368
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,200
Be careful when
you drive a car, bitch!

369
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,900
I think I can help you.
I saw everything.

370
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,800
She was there and you're it
back into it backwards.

371
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,700
I did what?

372
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,500
What's your problem? You're it
back in, poor sod.

373
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,800
I do not see what you mean!

374
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,100
You should probably start thinking
about how you will pay that.

375
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,000
I do not have him back in!

376
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,700
Damn, you calling me a liar?

377
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,800
Look, I ...
What is happening here?

378
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,900
I do not know, you seem to me
take a fucking liar.

379
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,100
I do not ...

380
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,000
- Okay, I want no problems.
- You want no problems?

381
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,600
No.

382
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,800
I think so, Miss Piggy.

383
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,200
This is ridiculous!

384
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,700
Come on, we're going.

385
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,200
Your girlfriend looks sexy
to have some problems.

386
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,100
We're going nowhere.

387
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,800
You know?

388
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,200
- Hi ...
- Hello.

389
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:26,600
Sometimes you spend a bad day
and you think it can not be worse.

390
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,600
and suddenly you realize the full
different ways it can be.

391
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,500
No thank you.

392
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,700
Depart from me this.

393
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
One day two years ago, I
four chicks in the back of the van.

394
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,000
They had great desire to kiss,
and had already begun.

395
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,700
I licked one, I put
one finger to another,

396
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,300
but there were two other chicks
who also wanted to participate.

397
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,700
So with my other hand
I finger the other girl,

398
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,800
and I had my toe
in the bottom of the fourth.

399
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,600
And I was going crazy,
What was too, you see.

400
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,000
I do not understand who was who, I
was getting sore tongue,

401
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,300
my fingers were tired ...

402
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,200
I stopped, and you
know what happened?

403
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,300
They started doing stuff
them, to lick, to be fingered.

404
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,700
I sat and watched.

405
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,400
I pulled out my dick and I
motion. Everyone was a winner.

406
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,200
Is it a
perverse metaphor for me?

407
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,100
A what?

408
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,500
Whatever.

409
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,200
Stop!

410
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,700
Please, stop!

411
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
What was that whore?

412
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,100
- I saw a mouse.
- What?

413
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,100
You?

414
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,700
I think I have the
land in the mouth.

415
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,200
So what do we do?

416
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,900
Good.

417
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,700
- We arrived.
- Where?

418
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,500
Go!

419
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,400
Where are we?

420
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,400
What?

421
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,000
Whose house is this?

422
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,600
Yeah, nah, I do not like too
The Chinese food ...

423
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:52,200
Excuse me, I speak!

424
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,800
- She who this house?
- This house?

425
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
- Yeah.
- To my uncle.

426
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,700
Where is your uncle?

427
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,600
- Right there.
- Where?

428
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,400
Damn!

429
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,800
- You were dirty.
- Yeah, now I'm wet.

430
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,100
You're dirty and wet?

431
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,000
I'm coming.

432
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,900
Now I am dirty
and wet too.

433
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,300
R2!

434
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,000
R2! Turn off the fucking
trash compactors!

435
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,200
Damn!

436
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,300
R2!

437
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:55,400
All fuckin compactors
waste that level!

438
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,900
Shit, they shoot stuff!

439
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,100
Son of a bitch!

440
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,300
How did you meet this guy?

441
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:39,000
I do not know, he moved in
my grandmother, I think.

442
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,000
How?
He rents a room?

443
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,500
No, not really.

444
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,400
It's a long story.

445
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,500
Fish, fish!

446
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,900
We'll make a fire.

447
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,000
Fuck you, bitch!

448
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,800
I jumped over the fire ...

449
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,100
I have an appointment with the doctor.

450
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,200
What?

451
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,200
It hurts when I urinate.

452
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,600
Does he just leave us here?

453
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,300
- I think so.
- We'd better go.

454
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,300
Let's go.

455
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,100
What's his name?

456
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,100
- Hesher.
- Hesher is a name that?

457
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,600
I do not know.

458
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,100
- He has a name?
- I do not know.

459
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,900
All my shoes are soaked.

460
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
- How old is he?
- I do not know.

461
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,600
You know something about him?

462
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,700
No, not really.

463
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:42,600
Fortunately, you were behind me
when I got in that car.

464
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:48,400
I was terrified, I have no insurance,
I can not pay me,

465
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,000
and I could not pay
to repair his car.

466
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,000
How do people do?

467
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:59,100
I mean, I have a job,
but it's almost a joke.

468
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,300
I have been here almost a year
and I do 15 hours a week ...

469
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,500
Why do not they give me
more hours in your opinion?

470
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,300
It is because I am no?

471
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,600
Do you found me no
when you came to my car?

472
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,300
No.

473
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:20,100
I even have enough money
to pay my rent there.

474
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,500
I will soon have to start
stuff for sale ...

475
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,000
Here ...

476
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:31,300
I have two dollars.

477
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
What is sad is that I
might need it.

478
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,500
- Well, I give them to you.
- No.

479
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,600
Oh no, let it be
not a fine, pity.

480
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,000
Oh no.

481
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,600
Shit!

482
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,800
Shit, shit, shit!

483
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:35,000
What have I done to deserve this
chain of shit all the time?

484
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:44,800
I'm sure if I died,
no one would notice.

485
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,900
I notice it.

486
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,600
If you died now, I would notice.

487
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:16,700
Especially because I would be sitting
in a car next to a dead woman.

488
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,100
Do not call me "lady"
please.

489
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,700
- Hi, TJ.
- Hello, Grandma.

490
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,800
So what?

491
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,100
- You've fucked?
- No.

492
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,600
Where you were today?

493
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:03,000
The térapie, 15.30.
I had to go alone.

494
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,400
Sorry I forgot.

495
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,000
Super.

496
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,800
You know, it's also hard
for you than for me.

497
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,400
I waited outside the school
for 45 minutes.

498
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,300
I told you I
not want to go.

499
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,300
Perhaps you should let me know the next
Once you decide to not go.

500
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,400
- I did it, I said I wanted to go.
- No, you did not!

501
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,900
I've told you a thousand times!

502
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,200
- No you did not tell me!
- If you listen but never!

503
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,800
You have not said that!

504
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,500
You said you wanted no
go, not that you would go.

505
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,300
- It's been what's the difference?
- A big difference for me!

506
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,200
Sitting alone in
a room filled with shabby.

507
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:43,500
Boys, please.
I do not feel very well.

508
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,800
You can pass me my pills?

509
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,700
- Did you tell him fingering her pussy?
- Shut up!

510
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,400
- TJ!
- What?

511
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,800
Watch your language!

512
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,700
- Did you hear what he just said?
- Whatever.

513
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,500
Talks like that again and
you go to your room.

514
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,600
My room?
You start to punish me now?

515
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,100
Yes, maybe.

516
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,300
It's more for your irresponsibility
for your language.

517
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,200
I mean, I had to take you
with the police.

518
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,400
I'm sorry for making
move your ass from the couch.

519
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,700
And I'm really sorry I have to put
pants for the first time in months.

520
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,200
- TJ!
- What?

521
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,100
Eh! Enough!

522
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,600
As soon as I am right that's enough?

523
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,600
I do not want to hear you!

524
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,400
Okay.

525
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,600
And then shit!

526
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,700
Are you happy? Huh?

527
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,700
I missed something?

528
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,200
Not really.

529
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,300
He said bullshit,
he threw his plate

530
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,600
too.

531
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,600
But I think he did it because
he had nothing more to say.

532
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,600
Little was right.

533
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:38,300
He felt bad, so he left.

534
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,700
I do not know.

535
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:49,000
I wish I could do
something more.

536
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,900
- It's delicious.
- Oh, thank you.

537
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,700
Hey, what is green and slimy,
and smelling the bacon?

538
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,100
I do not know.

539
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,000
Think, what is green, viscous
and smelling the bacon?

540
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,200
Well, I do not know.

541
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:44,200
I go to bed.
I do not feel well.

542
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,100
Ok

543
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,700
- You found?
- Found what?

544
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:15,200
What is green, viscous
and smelling the bacon?

545
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,800
I do not know.

546
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,700
- Could you do me a favor?
- Yes.

547
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,800
Could you pass me
the bottle in the cupboard?

548
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,700
- Who, him?
- Yes, thank you.

549
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,900
Nothing.

550
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,300
This is the finger of Kermit the Frog.

551
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,500
You know, with Miss Piggy.

552
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,100
What is that?

553
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,600
Medicinal cigarettes,
to help against nausea.

554
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,900
- You could light a match please?
- Of course.

555
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,400
I can watch them quickly?

556
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,800
I'll be right back.

557
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,200
May I?

558
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,400
Thank you.

559
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,300
What is that?

560
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,300
It's a pipe, there is water
to filter the smoke.

561
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,000
This is the most
healthy smoking weed.

562
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,700
I'll show you how.
You see that hole right there?

563
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,800
You must put your finger on it.

564
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,200
You heat the ball.

565
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:42,700
When it filled with smoke
like that, you let go here.

566
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,500
That's it.

567
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,000
I'll turn it on for you.

568
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,800
Put your finger on the hole here.

569
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:00,300
I turn it on and you suck.

570
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,300
Go ahead, suck.

571
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,600
This is like that.

572
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,600
Take a deep aspiration.

573
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,600
Well.

574
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,100
My God.

575
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,100
Do it again.

576
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:33,300
No, I think it's going.
Thank you.

577
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,800
I'll finish it.

578
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:51,400
How old are you?

579
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,800
Everybody cares.

580
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,800
You look a little older than TJ.

581
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,800
- Who?
- Oh, stop.

582
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,500
You're not a bit old
to be the same with TJ?

583
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:14,500
- And you?
- No, I'm his grandmother.

584
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,100
That's true.

585
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:26,400
I had a snake, a big thing.

586
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:32,000
Every week, I
gave a live mouse.

587
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:39,500
Snakes eat other snakes
because they have good shape.

588
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,700
Anyway this one was eating mice.

589
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:50,100
I once put a mouse in his cage.

590
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,500
He found the mouse and attacked her.

591
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,900
And this mouse, she got up
on its hind legs

592
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,000
and she has done for a stroke
punched in the mouth.

593
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,900
You're kidding.

594
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,700
It happened again.
The snake tried again to eat.

595
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,100
and she struck again.

596
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:14,600
The snake did not know what to do.
He started in a corner and cried.

597
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,800
And the fucking ruled the mouse cage.

598
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
For weeks, she looked in
the cage, as if possessed.

599
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:28,600
As if it were on a couch, with a
scratching their balls and chewing peanuts.

600
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,900
Quiet, you know.

601
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,100
I tried to give other mice

602
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,300
but when I put in a new mouse
the cage, it hid behind the old mouse.

603
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,800
The snake was scared.

604
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,400
He died of hunger.

605
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,500
In a cage full of mice.

606
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:55,000
So TJ is a mouse?

607
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,700
I do not know, maybe.

608
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:03,600
So who am I?

609
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:07,400
You, an old lady.

610
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:12,600
No, I'm a grandmother.

611
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:17,200
Yeah, you're a grandmother.

612
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:24,400
You know what? Grandma, I will
go for a walk with you tomorrow morning.

613
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:28,700
That's nice.

614
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,600
Where are you going?

615
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:36,900
I do not know, I'll go with you.
Regardless, in the district, I guess.

616
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:41,300
Good.

617
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,800
- Have fun.
- No, I'll go with you.

618
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,600
We'll see when you get back.

619
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,700
Why you do not send it?
Of course.

620
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,500
I can tell you?

621
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:09,100
Wait two seconds.
Can not you see I'm on the phone?

622
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,700
- I must speak.
- I am at tel-, wait outside.

623
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,500
Wait outside!

624
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:34,500
You came for me
you can break your neck?

625
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,100
- What?
- I have the money.

626
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,500
What money?

627
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,500
You said that with 1800 dollars
I could get the car.

628
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:47,900
Are you kidding? I said that even if you had
1800 dollars I could not you sell it.

629
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,400
- It is not here anyway.
- How are you?

630
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,500
I feel like I have had
this conversation too many times

631
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,900
- And I will not get it again because it is not here.
- What does it mean?

632
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
She's not here
It's over, she's gone!

633
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,400
- But it is where?
- Kid, it's over. Going on.

634
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:05,400
Goodbye, going into.

635
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:22,400
What is the matter?

636
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,700
I have to go before
I hurt someone.

637
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:44,200
Money for the fine of Nicole.
Kisses, TJ.

638
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:54,800
Hello, this is Nicole. I'm not there to
time. Leave a message and I'll call you back.

639
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,100
Hello, this is TJ.

640
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:07,300
Sorry to bother you, I think
I just want to talk to you.

641
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,500
I have a gift for you, so ...

642
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:15,000
I'll just come and
deposit it with you.

643
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,100
Ok, here ... hello.

644
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,200
Fuck you!

645
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,000
Eh! Dude!

646
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,800
What are you doing bitch?

647
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,800
- Move back!
- Damn!

648
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,800
Fuck you! Get out!

649
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,300
And you're a dirty whore!

650
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,700
I hope you die and
no one will notice

651
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,400
because you're nothing but a big prostitute.

652
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,200
- Dude, calm down.
- Casse-toi,

653
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,300
or I swear I'll
shatters the skull!

654
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:28,700
I will never see you again
you and your filthy heads!

655
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,300
Fuck you!

656
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,400
I hate you!

657
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,200
Hey, I want to talk to you.

658
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,900
- Hey, man, I want to talk to you.
- Let me whore!

659
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,600
Dude, calm down.

660
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,700
Calm down! Holy shit!

661
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,600
I just want to talk to you a second!

662
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,500
- Calm down bitch!
- Well it loose, what are you doing?

663
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:58,000
Kind of fag!

664
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,300
No!

665
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,100
Fuck you, assholes!

666
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,700
You?

667
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,800
TJ?

668
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:28,100
In 15 months of school ...

669
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:32,300
An extensive training in
Athletics, Physics, Chemistry ...

670
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:36,100
I train them to be the best, and
they expect me to be the best.

671
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:35,400
- Where's my car?
- Damn!

672
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,100
- Where's my car?
- Are you weighed?

673
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:39,100
Tell me where it is or I
I cut the toe.

674
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,000
They sent to
junkyard.

675
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:44,100
It is in this fucking
car cemetery, asshole!

676
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,100
- That's bullshit!
- Why would I lie?

677
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:48,300
Because you're an asshole!
Tell me where it is!

678
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:52,300
They took her car to the cemetery!
I swear to God! Damn!

679
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,500
Damn!

680
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:58,700
If you lie, I'll cut all
your toes, right?

681
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,400
Yeah.

682
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,200
You got something to say?

683
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:16,100
- You want to go home right?
- Let me go!

684
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,900
Damn!

685
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,100
Shit!

686
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:34,700
- What are you doing?
- What?

687
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,000
What's your problem?

688
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,600
I just save you.

689
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,600
I said I wanted to see you!

690
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:45,400
How many times I have to tell you?
Leave me!

691
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,500
Come on, honey.

692
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:23,400
- Go, my heart!
- What is there here?

693
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:27,400
Let's go boys, we
will be late.

694
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,300
And the pizza?

695
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,700
- You can eat in the car.
- Cool!

696
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,000
Honey, what's there is there?

697
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:38,100
Take my car, you drive.

698
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:49,100
- You can open the door?
- Of course.

699
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,900
What a great idea.
I will be careful to tell them

700
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:01,300
our old microwave
is a gift from you.

701
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:04,800
Well, they do not even know
who I am anyway.

702
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:08,700
- Honey, what are my friends.
- I know.

703
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:12,200
I just do not know why
they must be given as gifts.

704
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,500
A microwave and a bottle of
whiskey that is not so much.

705
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,600
And flowers.

706
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,800
- Flowers?
- Flowers!

707
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,200
- Mom, you can turn on the radio?
- Yes, my angel.

708
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:24,500
Help!

709
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,800
What are you doing?

710
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:40,000
Back, back!

711
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,300
But what are you doing?

712
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,800
I do not know.

713
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,600
Where you been?

714
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,300
- Sorry.
- Where you been?

715
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,400
Sorry.

716
01:25:56,500 --> 01:26:00,700
It is 10 o'clock in the morning.
How do I deserve this?

717
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,500
I do not know.

718
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,500
Go to your room.

719
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,100
There is someone for you at the door.

720
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,900
Hesher is not there.

721
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,600
I have come to see you.

722
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:05,100
I did not know if I should come or not.

723
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,100
but I could not
help but think about it.

724
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:13,100
I thought if I were you
would be angry and you hate me.

725
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:17,200
but after I told myself that if I did not come,
You would think that I do not care,

726
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:21,500
and also you would have hated anyway.
So I decided to come.

727
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:26,600
That's what I thought.
So here I am.

728
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:38,800
What do you want?

729
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:42,300
I want to apologize.

730
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,900
I feel bad about
of what happened.

731
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:49,000
- It is not important.
- If it's in a.

732
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:54,700
It is important to me.
TJ I love you very much.

733
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,900
And I understand if you do
not want to be friends.

734
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,400
but I never meant to hurt you.

735
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:08,500
It's just ...

736
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,900
Sometimes ...

737
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:15,100
I do not know ...

738
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:18,700
But I thought I
had to tell you that.

739
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:24,000
You still hate me anyway, but
I thought I'd come to tell you that.

740
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:29,800
And I said. Ok, goodbye.

741
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,700
Sorry I broke your lamp.

742
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,700
No problem.

743
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,700
And sorry I treated
heavy prostitute.

744
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,100
No problem.

745
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,800
You are not fat.

746
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,800
But I am a prostitute?

747
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:56,100
No. Maybe.

748
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:00,800
We are here
to mourn the loss

749
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:05,500
and celebrate life
Madeleine Francis Forney.

750
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:09,000
Madeleine was very much loved
as a wife,

751
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:12,400
mother, grandmother and friend.

752
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,800
Now, Ms. Rosowski,

753
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:20,600
a dear friend from the neighborhood, will
quickly say a few words.

754
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:39,600
I did not know Madeleine
long enough.

755
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:43,000
As soon as I moved
in the neighborhood,

756
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:46,800
She treated me as if
I was in the family.

757
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:50,900
She had a heart so
nice and wonderful.

758
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:55,000
We shared wonderful walks.

759
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,900
And we loved
be together.

760
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:03,500
I will miss our walks,
and above all our discussions.

761
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:07,100
I will always remember
what she said:

762
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,900
"Life is like walking
in the rain.

763
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,100
You can hide and shelters you,

764
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,100
or you can get wet. "

765
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,400
Well, thank you.

766
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:53,300
TJ, I think you should
say something.

767
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:59,100
Come on, TJ.

768
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,600
Sorry.

769
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,700
Well, we should conclude
the ceremony with ...

770
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:39,800
Yeah, I just completed
what the kid said,

771
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,100
because I think I know
what he meant.

772
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:44,200
What are you doing?

773
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:46,100
Sir, we ...

774
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,900
Touch me, whore.

775
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,900
Back, sitting up.

776
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,800
You will not want me here,
and I do not want to be here.

777
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,400
I've just not for me,
I come to it, whore.

778
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,600
She tried to tell you something,
but you were too stupid to listen.

779
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:16,500
So if you could close a few seconds
I'll say what I want to say.

780
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:20,000
and you will see me again.

781
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:40,400
I tore a gas tank
an old Chevy.

782
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:42,900
I wanted to explode,
So I did.

783
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:47,900
But I have not thought about the parts
metal that would fly everywhere.

784
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:50,200
I almost killed him.

785
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:54,500
I woke up in hospital
and a doctor told me: "Son ..."

786
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:56,800
I said "call me
son, asshole. "

787
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,400
He said, "you've
ripped a testicle. "

788
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,900
I lost a testicle, like that.

789
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I became insane, I hit
nurse, doctor, I remember.

790
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:15,300
They put me in a juvenile detention center
and I was just thinking about my fucking balls.

791
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:18,400
What is going to do?

792
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:22,300
I had to pick her up, so I
ran away and I looked for.

793
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:24,400
I could not find her.

794
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:33,400
Well, one night ...

795
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:37,300
I was there, I chiais I
looking at my balls.

796
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:42,200
I stared at that old soft bag
where was my testicle before,

797
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:48,400
and then I saw my right testicle,
for the first time.

798
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:52,500
I thought: "Damn, man! My balls!"

799
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:55,300
"Look! I still have a testicle!"

800
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,200
No?

801
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,400
It is well, it works.

802
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:04,300
God or the fucking devil, who he is,
left me with a good ball!

803
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:08,700
I still have a fucking testicle and
works, and works as my cock whore.

804
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:18,200
You lost your wife.

805
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:26,500
You lost your mother.

806
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:34,500
I lost my balls.

807
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,400
Damn!

808
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:55,500
Fucking touch it!
Remove your hands from it!

809
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:58,100
Go, get out!

810
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:01,600
I told Grandma that I
take a walk with her

811
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:04,900
And that's what I'll do.

812
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:10,500
You told your grandmother you were going
take a walk with her.

813
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:13,000
This is your last chance.

814
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:27,700
Hello, TJ.

816
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,800
I can feel again

01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:45,700
- Hesher left.
- How are you?

819
