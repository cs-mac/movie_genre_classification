1
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,880
CAESAR MUST DIE

2
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,400
Fly, Brutus, fly.

3
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,080
Trebonius,

4
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,400
help me to die.

5
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,200
And I should do something like that?
Never.

6
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,320
Take this sword.

7
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,840
No, Brutus, I'd rather kill myself.

8
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,680
Please, stay.

9
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,080
I know your courage.

10
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,320
Hold my sword.

11
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,720
And turn your face away.

12
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,880
Help me to die.

13
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,880
Will you?

14
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,040
Give me your hand first.

15
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,920
Farewell, my lord.

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
Farewell, good Strato.

17
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,520
Caesar,

18
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,600
you can find peace now.

19
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,520
I kill myself with mice the anger

20
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,080
with which I killed you.

21
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,800
We defeated you, Brutus,

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,080
but you were the noblest Roman
among the conspirators.

23
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,480
You believed
with courage and firmness

24
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,520
that your deed should be undertaken
to honor freedom.

25
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,760
Nature was generous with him,

26
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,920
he lived a great life,

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,280
in his heart and in his mind.

28
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:37,600
Thus we can proclaim to Rome
and to the whole world...

29
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,840
this is a man!

30
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,240
Let's go!

31
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,920
Quick!

32
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,480
REBIBBIA PRISON

SIX MONTHS EARLIER

34
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,080
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.

35
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,040
I'm pleased there's so many of you.

36
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,400
We are here to inaugurate
next season's theatrical laboratory.

37
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,480
As prison authorities,
we want to support this initiative.

38
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,200
Obviously, we need you to believe in it,

39
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,720
give your best efforts and show your
passion as in previous productions.

40
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,320
I'll hand over to Fabio Cavalli,
who will introduce the project.

41
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,040
This year we are going to be staging

42
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,320
Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.

43
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,000
It's about a great Roman general,

44
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:06,440
who, after making Rome
great and powerful,

45
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:09,960
gives in to the temptation of tyranny

46
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,320
and for this reason
will be eliminated

47
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,840
by his fellow politicians.

48
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,640
We'll deal with this with the help
of our lead actor, Cosimo Rega,

49
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,880
who has been following the company
on the inside for years.

50
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,600
We'll start with the auditions
next week.

51
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,480
Those of you
who want to be part of the company

52
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,640
simply have to make a request
to do so.

53
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,880
Good morning.

54
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,120
J
Juan Bonetti

55
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,800
I need you to tell me
your name and surname,

56
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,320
place and date of birth, father's name
and your place of residence

57
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,880
in mo different ways.

58
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,760
The first time
you're at a border crossing,

59
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,880
you're leaving your wife
who is back there, on a bench.

60
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,600
You'd like to say goodbye to her,
cy with her.

61
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,560
You have to provide us
with your details.

62
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,320
The second time, the same situation,

63
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,960
but at this point we will force you
to tell us your details.

64
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,160
So the first time you're crying,
the second, you're pissed off.

65
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,920
From now...

Is that all right, you like it?

129
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,800
You're all going to be
in Julius Caesar,

130
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,000
but for the main roles
what we thought was this...

131
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,360
For Julius Caesar, Giovanni Arcuri.

132
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,280
Cassius, Cosimo Rega.

133
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:33,200

For Decius, Juan Bonetti.

136
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,240
And for Lucius, the musician,

137
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,800
Enzo Gallo, who can play
the harmonica. Have you got it with you?

Can you close the curtain?

151
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,320
Perfect.

152
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,880
As you know,
the theatre is being rebuilt,

153
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,400
but I think this room is suitable
for rehearsals.

154
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,440
You've read the parts,
now you have to start speaking them.

155
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,960
Julius Caesar, Act 1, Scene 2.

156
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,000
And remember,
everyone in their own accent.

157
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,600
- Apulian.
- Calabrian.

158
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,040
- Roman.
- Neapolitan.

159
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,720
Perfect.

160
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,120
Julius Caesar is in the street
and the soothsayer comes up to him

161
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,120
because he has to speak to him,
ask him something.

162
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,520
Carusone, that's you, go!

163
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,440
Caesar...

164
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,200
Sorry, Fabio,

165
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:50,200
but in Neapolitan you say Caesar
the same as you do in Italian.

166
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,200
Here I am, who wants me?

167
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,520
Fine as regards the dialect,

168
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,040
but don't be vulgar.
It's not a vulgar dialect.

169
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,200
It's a dialect,
but in the mouth of noble characters.

170
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,400
Here I am, who wants me?

171
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,560
A bit less.

172
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,000
Here I am, who wants me?

173
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,440
Quiet, all of you, let him approach.

174
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,200
Sorry, Fabio, I don't have a dialect.

175
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,720
I'm a citizen of the world.
You want to see America?

176
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,160
Let's go to New Zealand, Maori,

177
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,040
All Blacks, haka dance.

178
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:33,720
Fine, that's enough, thank you.

179
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,200
Let him approach and speak,

180
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:39,200
Caesar is available to all, you know.

181
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,240
Caesar, amidst the glory and the pomp,
beware the Ides of March.

182
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,760
- What does he want from me?
- He's a wizard, a soothsayer.

183
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,520
Bring him here,
I want to look him in the eyes.

184
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,800
Come forward, come from the throng.

185
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,400
The thing you said before,
say it to my face, now!

186
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,200
Fabio, where I come from,

187
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,560
the wizards, the soothsayers,
they're all a bit loopy.

188
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,160
Can I play it that way?

189
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,760
Caesar, amidst the pomp and the glory,

190
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,400
the Ides of March
are telling you history.

191
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,240
Keep him away from me,
but gently, don't hit him.

192
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,320
At this point in the scene,
Caesar leaves with his entourage,

193
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,400
and only Cassius and Brutus remain,

194
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,440
and they say some fundamental things
at the start of the story.

195
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,840
What happened, Brutus?

196
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,880
live been watching you for a bit.

197
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,720
Dig, dig,

198
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,520
where is your old affection
for your friend?

199
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,520
You've forgotten about me,

200
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,680
or am I mistaken?

201
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,320
What was it, Brutus, what is it?

202
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,880
live been watching you for a bit.

203
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,640
Dig, dig,

204
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,920
where is your old affection
for your friend?

205
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,680
You've forgotten about me.

206
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,320
Am I perhaps mistaken?

207
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,360
What?

208
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,160
Cassius, what are you saying?

209
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,800
Poor Brutus is looking gloomy

210
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,000
because in his soul,
between his heart and his head,

211
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,000
a fierce war has erupted.

212
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,800
Look me in the eyes,

213
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,880
you see the field and the battle too
going on between me and myself.

214
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,040
Listen to your true friend, Brutus,

215
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,680
find the strength.

216
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:04,920
Look at yourself in the mirror,
you will see the soul of a noble man,

217
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,400
the man we all need in Rome.

218
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,760
What are you saying?
What are you tying to tell me?

219
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,720
Cassius,
do you want me to get into trouble?

220
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,480
Trust me, Brutus, gentle friend,

221
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,560
like I trust you.

222
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,120
Don't trust anyone, you great actor.
I did and look what happened to me!

223
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,600
Look!

224
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,080
Listen!

225
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:45,200
Right now
the people are offering Caesar

226
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,800
the king's crown.

227
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,280
You fear him.

228
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,320
What am I meant to think?
You don't want it either...

229
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,120
No, of course I don't!

230
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,920
Even if Caesar is dear to me.

231
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,160
Look!

232
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,960
Look what he's doing, that liar!

233
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,800
Antony is offering him the crown
in front of the whole people

234
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:14,640
and he is refusing it.

235
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,080
Look, he's moving it away
with the back of his hand.

236
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,120
Look, Antony is offering him
the crown again.

237
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,520
Three times, come and see.

238
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,360
No, Striano, you can't go to the window.

239
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,800
Brutus doesn't want to see.

240
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,760
You have to find another position,
you choose.

241
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,320
Good.

242
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,600
On you go, Cassius.

243
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,280
Caesar is uncertain,
he's taking it, he's not.

244
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,200
He's dying to place it on his head.

245
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,240
Rome, city without shame.

246
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:12,120
You as well, my Naples,

247
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,720
you've become a city without shame.

248
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,000
Excuse me,
but it feels like this Shakespeare

249
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,800
lived in the streets of my city.

250
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,760
Our fathers told us:

251
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,320
rather a devil in charge of Rome
than a king.

252
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,120
I know you're a true friend.

253
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,760
I have no doubt.

254
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,680
It seems clear that
what you're thinking and planning

255
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,440
involves me as well.

256
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,760
I have to think about it.

257
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,440
But don't forget this:

258
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,760
rather than bow down to a tyrant,

259
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,160
Brutus will go and work
as a swineherd.

260
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,560
Be careful,
Caesar is coming with Antony.

261
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,280
- Antony.
- Here I am, Caesar.

262
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,400
I don't like that Cassius.

263
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,680
I want fat men around me,
men who eat and drink.

264
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:13,880
Cassius has a lean and hungry look;

265
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,520
he studies and thinks too much.
I don't like him.

266
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,880
Don't worry, he's a good boy.

267
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,840
Speak in my right ear,
I can't hear very well here.

268
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:25,360
His family is noble,
there is nothing to fear.

269
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,160
Maybe, but I do not like Cassius' face.

270
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,320
I don't like lean faces.

271
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,880
I have to go now.

272
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,240
Come and see me tomorrow night.
We still have to talk.

273
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,440
I'll be waiting for you, understand?

274
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:44,120
Wait for us there.

275
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,000
Meanwhile, Brutus,

276
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,800
think of the world.

277
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,560
- We have visitors.
- It's Fabio.

278
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,280
The stalls in pieces,
the trestles, the cables...

279
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,360
Roberto, everything's all over
the place here!

280
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,120
When is the work going to be done?

281
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,920
We're rehearsing around Rebibbia,
wherever we can,

282
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,400
but if the stage isn't ready,
we'll never manage to put it on.

283
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,520
What do you want? First he says
one thing, then another.

284
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:23,800
We're just the slaves.
Speak to the emperor.

285
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,880
Maybe a woman will sit here.

286
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,240
Lucius, will we try it,
just the mo of us?

287
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,760
- Now?
- Yes.

288
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,880
- Just the mo of us?
- Yes.

289
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,040
No, you stay in bed.

290
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,360
- Lying down?
- Yes, like in the scene.

291
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,560
Stretched out, with your eyes closed.

292
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,760
- Close your eyes.
- Close them?

293
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,280
Lucius, wake up.

294
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,880
I would like that,

295
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,640
a little of the sweet illness of sleep.

296
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,920
Lucius, wake up!

297
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,200
- I have to wake up?
- Yes.

298
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:39,760
- Yes, master?
- Check what day it is.

299
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,600
He has to die.

300
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,080
If he lives, Caesar will defeat us all.

301
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:54,000
If it was just about me,

302
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,800
I wouldn't care,

303
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,040
but he will defeat all of Rome.

304
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,560
I loved him, it's true,

305
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,280
but if he manages
to place a crown on his head,

306
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:08,680
he is no longer Caesar,
but becomes...

307
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:11,080
becomes...

308
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,080
becomes a poisonous serpent.

309
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,520
No...

310
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:23,640
I can't be getting the line wrong.

311
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:27,640
I understand what Shakespeare meant,

312
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,960
but how to get it across
to the audience?

313
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:34,880
It's starting again.

314
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,240
We saw him yesterday at the Forum.

315
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,000
He is looking for a throne
on which to build his nest.

316
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,480
He went up step after step,
humble and respectful,

317
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:46,240
because humility and respect
are tools of ambition.

318
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,280
And now that the summit is near,
he will not turn back.

319
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,480
Look at him, it's gone to his head.

320
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,560
Instead of doing his time properly,
he's playing the fool!

321
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,880
He disparages the world
he has left behind

322
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,000
and is chasing the clouds in the sky.

323
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:03,520
Give him time, give him a crown

324
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,640
and if the serpent
is still in the egg,

325
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:11,040
up there the egg will hatch
and intoxicate all of Rome.

326
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:14,000
Caesar has to die now.

327
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,360
We are at the Ides of March.
They're here.

328
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,560
Go and meet them, go on!

329
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:25,760
THE PLOT

330
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,800
I'm sorry if we woke you up.

331
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,000
I didn't sleep last night.

332
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:44,080
Welcome, all of you.

333
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,240
Be patient, I have to talk to Brutus.

334
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,600
See, guys?

335
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,960
The storm has passed.

336
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,320
That's the east,

337
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,320
where the sun rises.

338
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:09,520
- I think. Isn't it?
- No, you're wrong.

339
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,600
He's right, those bluish streaks
on the clouds come before the dawn.

340
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,920
The sun, at this time of year,
rises there, towards the Capitol.

341
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,720
That's east.

342
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,320
Are you laughing at me?

343
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,600
No, I'm not,
you're saying your line well.

344
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,280
I'm thinking about those four fools
who are about to kill the boss

345
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:33,360
and they're dribbling on
about where the sun rises.

346
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,240
I like them.

347
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,280
In fact, we're all fools
to an extent. Them too, the plotters.

348
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:43,400
And just as well; that way
the character is more like me.

349
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,280
Right, hands here, one at a time.

350
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,360
Let's confirm our pact with an oath.

351
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,480
No, no oath.

352
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:59,160
If we're real men, it should be
enough to look each other in the eye.

353
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,560
Pain and anger in the heart,

354
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,000
shame for this infamous era,

355
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:07,080
are enough to risk our lives,

356
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,000
because, if they're not enough,

357
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:11,640
why are we mucking about at night?

358
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,160
If we're not ready,
let's go to sleep,

359
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,920
because tomorrow the tyrant
will worry about our lives.

360
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,720
So no oaths.

361
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,680
The priests can swear oaths,
the crappers,

362
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:25,000
the old bootlickers,
the vile scoundrels,

363
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,640
the windbags

364
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,400
and all the cuckolds,
beaten-up and happy.

365
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:33,080
Our undertaking is so great

366
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,280
that no villainy can stop us.

367
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:40,520
Yes, but who else
will meet the same fate as Caesar?

368
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:47,440
Metellus is right,

369
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,680
Caesar's right-hand man has to meet
the same fate as Caesar.

370
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:52,320
We know Antony's job is to plot.

371
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,480
He's astute.
He could ruin everything for us.

372
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:58,080
The same fate for Antony and Caesar!

373
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:06,120
No, Cassius,
justice is not a slaughterhouse

374
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,000
and we are men of justice,
not butchers.

375
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:11,680
And that's how it must appear
to the people.

376
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,800
We have rebelled
against Caesar's ideas,

377
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,760
against his spirit.

378
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,320
This is not an assassination,
it's a sacrifice.

379
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,560
If I could remove the spirit
of the tyrant from him

380
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,040
without tearing open his chest.

381
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,080
If I could...

382
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:41,920
What's wrong, Sasà,
don't you remember your lines?

383
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,280
He knows them.

384
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,800
He's got the character of Brutus
inside him.

385
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,000
live memorized them too,
but it's difficult.

386
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:52,760
Difficult? But why?

387
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:56,640
Have we never known bullying Caesars
in our own home?

388
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,000
And betrayal and murder...

389
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,720
Today he doesn't want to remember.

390
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,960
Sasà, what's wrong?

391
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,600
What do you want?

392
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,840
It's to do with me.

393
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,680
To do with me!

394
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,440
Fabio, I'm sorry.

395
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,080
Really, I'm sorry,

396
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,920
It's this line I have to say:

397
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,680
"If I could remove Caesar's spirit,
without tearing open his chest."

398
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,680
I saw the face of a friend of mine
appear before me.

399
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,800
We sold contraband cigarettes
together,

400
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,200
me on one pavement, him on the other.

401
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,320
That evening
he had to shut up some scumbag.

402
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,120
Suddenly he stopped in front of me

403
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,440
and said exactly the same as Brutus.

404
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,080
The words were different,
but the same.

405
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,040
The neighborhood
got to hear about it.

406
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,480
He's a windbag, they said.

407
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,800
Everyone.

408
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,280
And I did too, in chorus.

409
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:08,440
And now it hurts me.

410
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,960
What happened in the end?

411
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,000
Will we continue tomorrow?

412
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:19,040
We'll continue tomorrow.

413
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,160
I want to continue.

414
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,400
Without tearing open his chest...

415
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:36,040
But I'm scared of Antony.

416
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:39,080
We all know his love for Caesar.

417
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,840
I told you no, Cassius.

418
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,160
Caesar's right hand,

419
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,600
once Caesar's head has fallen,
won't be able to do anything.

420
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,440
So let him live,

421
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,560
let him go back to his revelries,
games and merrymaking.

422
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,880
Let him live his life and soon
he'll be laughing about it all.

423
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:03,960
Be quiet and count the hours.

424
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,560
Four o'clock.

425
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,880
Four, it's time to go.

426
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:22,600
We salute you, Brutus,
but be careful.

427
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,120
Caesar has been superstitious
for too long,

428
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,000
after all these bad omens
and signs in the sky,

429
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:38,160
he might not turn up tomorrow
at the Senate.

430
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,640
Let me deal with that,
I know how to butter him up.

431
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,120
Catch the fox with a trap
and the man with sweet words.

432
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:50,680
I'll get him to the Senate on time.

433
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,560
All right, men,
everyone takes his own road.

434
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,600
Hey!

435
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,080
Sleep.

436
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:09,000
Sleep, Lucius,

437
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,760
that's better.

438
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:44,320
And to think that at school
I found this so boring!

439
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,240
Our Julius Caesar is a great!

440
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:51,120
A genius,
according to Shakespeare as well.

441
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,080
Come on, Giovanni
let's not waste time and get to work.

442
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,080
What time, Fabio?

443
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,840
live been in here for 20 years

444
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,840
and you say:
"Let's not waste time"...

445
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,000
Greetings.

446
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:07,880
Are you ready for the walk
to the Senate?

447
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,280
Well done, Decius,
you arrived at just the right moment.

448
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,720
Take this message
to the most venerable senators:

449
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,680
Caesar will not attend today's sitting.

450
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,760
- Don't you feel well?
- Speak into this other ear.

451
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,480
What do you mean?

452
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:30,440
Caesar does not hide behind a lie.

453
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:32,640
It's not that I can't go,

454
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,440
let's say it doesn't suit me.

455
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,920
Tell them that:
Caesar doesn't want to come.

456
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,760
Most powerful Caesar,

457
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:46,160
you have to give me a reason,

458
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,440
otherwise the senators
will take the piss out of me.

459
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,000
A reason?

460
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:53,400
My word should be sufficient.

461
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,160
Decius...

462
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:01,760
Because I love you,
I want to tell you a secret.

463
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,720
Last night my wife had a dream.

464
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,760
A hundred wounds
appeared on a statue of me,

465
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,480
a hundred mouths
from which gushed blood.

466
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:17,440
On her knees, she made me swear
not to leave the house.

467
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,960
And I am going to stay home.

468
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,240
Caesar, this is a good dream

469
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,360
and it foretells the opposite.

470
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,560
Rome is a leech that gets nourishment
from your blood,

471
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,680
and the more it drinks,

472
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,840
the stronger and greater it becomes.

473
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,000
This is the right interpretation, wife.

474
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,680
And now there is more news,

475
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,640
good news for you, the latest.

476
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,200
The Senate is going to vote
on a decree

477
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,040
to give the great Caesar the crown.

478
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,640
If you do not appear,

479
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:10,000
the senators
might change their minds.

480
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,280
The sitting is postponed

481
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:19,240
until the great Caesar's wife
has a good dream.

482
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,280
You must excuse my frank speech,
but I'm speaking as a friend.

483
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,000
A friend?

484
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:31,400
A liar, an arselicker,

485
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,240
a brass neck.

486
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,880
He's really good
at playing the schemer.

487
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,040
What the fuck are you saying?
You're messing up your lines.

488
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:47,040
You're so good, it really suits you
with that little face.

489
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,080
This isn't in the script,
Caesar doesn't say that.

490
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:54,800
He would, if he knew you.

491
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,680
But I'm not acting any more, Juan.

492
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,320
- What's going on?
- It's something between them.

493
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,320
I'm telling you
what's been in my heart for years.

494
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,160
I know you, you've always spoken
behind my back, like they know you.

495
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:11,240
Yes, but they don't know who you are.

496
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,080
Because what do you know?
Spit it out!

497
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:16,040
Decius would tell you
in your good ear,

498
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:18,040
but I'll tell you to your face.

499
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,600
Get lost, keep away,
the snake's bite is poisonous.

500
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,400
I'm a snake? Say that again!

501
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,880
Come on, I'll tell you outside!

502
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,920
Gianni, Juan, what are you doing?

503
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,120
Fabio, make them stop,
or they'll spoil it for all of us.

504
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:39,640
They'll shut up shop and I don't want
to miss out on this thing.

505
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,120
Observers of the ceiling
they should call us,

506
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,920
not prisoners.

507
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,400
Almost the whole day
with our eyes looking up,

508
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,000
on the bed.

509
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,840
Then if they put you
in the bed on top,

510
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,760
you can see the ceiling,

511
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,400
look at it, touch it,

512
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,160
talk to it.

513
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,600
Francesco, my son,

514
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,560
I try to see your face in the ceiling.

515
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,120
I'm not managing today,
but I'm tying,

516
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,840
I'm tying.

517
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,400
I don't know what I'll do tomorrow
if they don't give me a single cell.

518
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,640
It's my right.

519
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:48,320
Everyone has diarrhea today.

520
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,800
five beds, five cases of diarrhea.

521
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:51,080
Hail, Caesar!

522
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,000
Caesar, watch out for Brutus,
don't let Cassius out your sight,

523
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,280
stay away from Decius,
don't trust Casca.

524
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,720
They will all betray you.

525
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,000
You're not immortal. Be careful.

526
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,000
Read this, read it!

527
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:11,600
Caesar, my petition
has to do with you yourself.

528
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:13,760
Read it, great Caesar.

529
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,320
The ones that have to do with
ourselves are those we read last.

530
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:22,200
Great Caesar, read it!

531
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,200
- Who's he? Is he mad?
- Yes, he's mad.

532
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:31,040
Hail, Caesar.

533
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,000
Most powerful Caesar,

534
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,680
I, Metellus Cimber, place
my humble heart at your feet.

535
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,720
Metellus Cimber, I warn you,

536
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,840
I don't like being buttered up.

537
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,440
Your brother was condemned
and exiled as a scoundrel.

538
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:50,040
If you continue scraping
and whining for him,

539
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:52,800
I'll kick you out of here like a dog.

540
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,840
Remember, Caesar
does not wrong anyone.

541
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,400
My respects, Caesar,
but not to flatter you.

542
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,160
The sentence on his brother
is a serious thing.

543
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,680
What are you saying, Brutus?

544
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,760
Forgive, Caesar.

545
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,120
Caesar, forgive.

546
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:20,040
Cassius kneels before your feet,

547
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:21,680
listen to him.

548
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,760
I could be well moved,

549
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
if I were like you.

550
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,120
The skies are full
of a thousand flashes,

551
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:35,880
but only one remains still
in one place.

552
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,040
Thus it is in the swarming world
of men,

553
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:41,960
yet in the number

554
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:45,760
I know but one who remains solid

555
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,800
and that is me.

556
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,080
And now I will show this to you.

557
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:53,880
Metellus, I refuse to overturn
your brother's sentence

558
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,240
and I confirm it.

559
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,120
Caesar, listen to us.

560
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,280
Great Caesar, be careful.

561
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,040
Be careful.

562
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:17,680
Is it not enough that Brutus
knelt down in vain?

563
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,520
Sword, speak for me!

564
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,920
You as well, Brutus, my son.

565
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,080
Don't run away!

566
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:59,880
Freedom, tyranny is dead!

567
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,440
Cy it about the streets!

568
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:04,400
Someone run to the public rostrums,
and cy out,

569
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,480
"Liberty, independence
and redemption!"

570
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:10,680
Don't run away,
ambition's debt is paid.

571
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,000
Let's bend down,

572
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:32,480
dip our hands in
and wash them in his blood.

573
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:41,920
How many centuries to come

574
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,720
will see actors play

575
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,400
this great scene of ours

576
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,840
in kingdoms that are not yet born

577
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,120
and in languages
still to be invented.

578
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:57,640
And how often will Caesar
have to bleed on theatre stages,

579
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:59,960
like here today, as well,

580
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:02,640
in this prison of ours,

581
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:05,080
lying on the stone,

582
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:07,080
no more than dust?

583
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,440
Here comes Antony.

584
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:26,840
Here comes Antony.

585
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,600
O mighty Caesar!

586
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:42,960
Lying on the ground like this.

587
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,160
Your conquests, glory and triumph

588
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:49,160
are reduced to this.

589
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:52,200
Peace be with you.

590
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,240
I know not, gentlemen,

591
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,560
what you intend.

592
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:02,120
Whether other blood
has to be spilled alongside his.

593
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,040
If you have to do it, do it now.

594
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,160
The day and the occasion
are the best for me.

595
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:13,080
To die beside him,

596
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,760
by the hand of real men,

597
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:19,440
men of honor.

598
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,400
Antony, no one seeks your death,

599
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:28,440
and these arms welcome you
like a brother.

600
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,680
I doubt not your wisdom, Brutus.

601
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:36,120
Give me your bloody hand.

602
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:40,440
Antony, in a new and fair government

603
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:44,640
your vote will count as much
as each of ours, agreed?

604
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:47,200
Yes.

605
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,000
All I ask is that I may take
Caesar's body to the Forum;

606
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,720
I would like to say a few words there
in memory of him.

607
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,640
- Coming?
- Let's hear what they say.

608
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:01,600
Recreation's over.
They have to go back in.

609
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:02,880
Let them finish the scene.

610
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,880
I'll speak first and
explain why Caesar died.

611
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,720
Then you can speak

612
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,640
and say that the funerary honors are
our concession.

613
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,040
I do not ask for more.

614
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:17,040
I like Antony. He's obliging.

615
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,160
What? He's a son of a bitch!

616
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:21,880
We'll go to the Forum before you.

617
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,760
What Forum?
Get into your cells, come on!

618
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,360
Hang on, listen,
he said he was obliging, listen...

619
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,560
Forgive me,

620
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:34,080
pile of bones and blood,

621
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,560
if I act meekly
in front of these ghastly butchers.

622
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,800
Forgive me.

623
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:48,360
You know, don't you,
what will happen to them?

624
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,200
Damn their hands that I shook!

625
00:46:56,199 --> 00:46:58,080
We, your men, like mastiffs,

626
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:03,120
we will take iron, blood, war
through these lands

627
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,720
vengeance as well.

628
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:25,200
Brutus is coming!

629
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,760
Let him speak!

630
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,080
Come!

631
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:31,040
Dim murderers!

632
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,040
- We want to know!
- Let Brutus speak!

633
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,160
- Listen, silence!
- Silence!

634
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,240
Listen to me,

635
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,680
to the end, then judge
me with your wisdom.

636
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,200
If there is one among you,

637
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,040
any dear friend of Caesar's,

638
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:58,080
to him I say, that Brutus' love
to Caesar was no less than his.

639
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,440
If then that friend demand

640
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,120
why Brutus rose against Caesar,

641
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:06,880
this is my answer:

642
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,880
Not because I didn't
love Caesar enough,

643
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,400
but because I loved Rome too much.

644
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,800
Had you rather Caesar were living

645
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:21,480
and die all slaves,

646
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,960
or Caesar dead,

647
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:26,680
and us alive in freedom?

648
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:33,320
Caesar loved me.

649
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,520
And for this I weep for him.

650
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:41,000
Fortune smiled on him

651
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:43,720
and I am happy about that.

652
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,320
He was brave,

653
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,040
and I honor him.

654
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,240
But, as he was ambitious,
I slew him.

655
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,320
Is there anyone among you

656
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,080
so vile

657
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:04,280
as not to love his county?

658
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,120
If any, speak;

659
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,840
for him

660
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:14,320
I have offended.

661
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,880
I'm waiting for an answer.

662
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,440
No one, Brutus!

663
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,960
So I didn't offend anyone.

664
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:32,840
Antony will speak now.

665
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:36,440
Antony has our permission
to eulogizes Caesar.

666
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,320
Listen to him, please,

667
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,760
out of respect for me as well.

668
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:52,400
Now before I leave you,

669
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,960
I want to tell you that
if I killed my best friend

670
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,720
for the good of Rome,

671
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,080
I have the same dagger for myself,

672
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,320
when it shall please my county
to need my death.

673
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,320
No, live, Brutus!

674
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,320
Live, Brutus!

675
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,480
Live, Brutus!

676
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:23,160
Here comes Antony!

677
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:26,680
Let's listen to Antony.

678
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,920
Friends, Romans,

679
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,400
I come to buy Caesar,

680
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,560
not to praise him.

681
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:37,960
The noble Brutus
has told you Caesar was ambitious.

682
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,520
If it were so,
it was a grievous fault,

683
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,880
and grievously
has Caesar paid for it.

684
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:49,560
Brutus said so

685
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:52,920
and Brutus and his friends
are honorable men.

686
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,640
Caesar was a just friend to me

687
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,640
and loyal.

688
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:03,840
When he saw a poor man cy,

689
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,960
Caesar wept.

690
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,600
Ambition should be made
of sterner stuff,

691
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:13,800
yet Brutus says he was ambitious

692
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,160
and Brutus is an honorable man.

693
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:20,720
You all did see

694
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:26,480
when I offered him the crown,
three times,

695
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,080
and he refused it three times.

696
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:32,040
Was this ambition?

697
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,920
And yet Brutus says
Caesar was ambitious,

698
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,280
and Brutus, we know,
is an honorable man.

699
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,160
I speak not to disprove
what Brutus spoke,

700
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,600
I am speaking to say what I know.

701
00:51:55,239 --> 00:52:00,640
But here's a parchment
with the seal of Caesar.

702
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:02,640
It is his will.

703
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,000
If you could read it...

704
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,040
But I am not authorized to read it.

705
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:14,120
Read the will!

706
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:16,000
- We want to hear it!
- Read it, Antony!

707
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:18,920
Who's stopping you reading it?

708
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:22,080
Be patient my friends,

709
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:24,320
it's best you don't know
how much Caesar loved you.

710
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:27,560
It's best you don't know that Caesar

711
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:31,080
named you as his heirs.

712
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:35,680
If you knew,

713
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:38,760
you would burn the world down!

714
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:44,160
I have overshot myself
to tell you of it.

715
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,400
And I don't want,

716
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,200
I don't want to wrong those men
of honor who stabbed Caesar.

717
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,440
What men of honor!
They're traitors!

718
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:56,120
- Murderers!
- Read the will!

719
00:52:57,199 --> 00:52:59,200
You really want
to make me read the will?

720
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,320
- Read the will!
- It's our right!

721
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,920
But first let me show you him
who wrote it.

722
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,200
If you have tears,

723
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,440
prepare to shed them all.

724
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,880
To every Roman citizen

725
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,360
Caesar leaves

726
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:32,080
75 drachmas.

727
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:34,520
His orchards on the other side
of the Tiber,

728
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:37,280
his private arbors,

729
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,360
he leaves to you and your heirs.

730
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,640
We'll burn Caesar's body
in the holy place!

731
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:46,600
And we will set fire
to the traitors' houses.

732
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:53,960
We'll rebel!

733
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,120
The revolt has begun.

734
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:06,040
Let what has to be, be.

735
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,720
I... Brutus, I mean, and Cassius,
they had to flee.

736
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,480
They organized an army,
they weren't short of money.

737
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,200
And the mob?

738
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,440
They burned all the plotters' houses.

739
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:24,000
It was a slaughter.

740
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,080
There was little to be happy about
in Rome back then.

741
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:31,000
Just like where I come from, Nigeria.

742
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,440
Cheer up!

743
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,800
Let some fresh air in here. It stinks.

744
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,400
Here. He's arrived.

745
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,400
Here's Octavius.

746
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:02,080
Guys, this is Octavius,
his name's Maurilio.

747
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:04,120
Come up on to the stage.

748
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:07,400
He's just come to Rebibbia.

749
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:12,000
He really looks
like the young emperor, maybe...

750
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,440
Pizzetto, the costume!
Maybe with a bit more hair.

751
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:22,680
Octavius is Julius Caesar's beloved son,
his adopted son.

752
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,280
He arrives in Rome
after his father's murder

753
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,520
and decides to avenge him.

754
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,760
He allies himself with Antony,

755
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,680
against the army
of Brutus and Cassius.

756
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:39,960
They organize a powerful army
and head for Greece,

757
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:44,600
where the final battle took place
on the Plain of Philippi.

758
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:47,120
Are you really going
to have a battle?

759
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,000
We'll have a battle,

760
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,320
but be careful, I'll do you.

761
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,320
Cosimo, don't frighten him.

762
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,320
It's Cassius who comes off worst,
isn't it?

763
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,480
Come and try your cloak.

764
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:01,920
Not today, I don't want to.

765
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,680
- What's up?
- Forget it, not today.

766
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:09,360
He's just had a visit.
Today's not a good day.

767
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:21,240
Which is Brutus' tent,
the one we're meant to raise?

768
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,680
I told you, the orange one.

769
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,000
THE PLAIN OF PHILIPPI

770
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:06,320
This candle is burning strangely!

771
00:57:25,639 --> 00:57:28,160
Who's that coming up behind me?

772
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:29,800
Who comes here?

773
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,760
Are you a god, an angel,

774
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,040
or a demon that chills,
the blood in my veins?

775
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,680
Speak to me.

776
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,280
- Who are you?
- Your evil spirit, Brutus.

777
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,760
Why have you come?

778
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,680
To tell you you'll see me again
tomorrow on the plain of Philippi.

779
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,760
That's better that way.
I'll see you tomorrow, Caesar.

780
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,560
Yes, in battle.

781
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:57,000
Who's that? My harmonica!

782
00:57:57,079 --> 00:57:59,240
live lost my harmonica!

783
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:03,680
Go back to sleep,
nothing has happened.

784
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,240
Sleep.

785
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,480
Go back to sleep. Nothing has happened.

786
00:58:26,199 --> 00:58:28,160
I was having a dream.

787
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,240
Awake!

788
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,680
Awake!

789
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:42,720
Blow now, wind,

790
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:46,040
rise up sea and unleash the storm!

791
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:49,280
- Everything to its fate.
- Yes, Cassius.

792
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,880
Today we complete the work
the Ides of March begun.

793
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,320
I don't know, my brother,
if we'll meet again.

794
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,840
Goodbye forever, Cassius.

795
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,960
And if we do meet again,

796
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,320
We can smile together
about this moment.

797
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,440
Goodbye for ever, Brutus.

798
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:11,600
And if we do meet again, we can smile
together about this farewell.

799
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:17,280
If only we could know
how this day will end.

800
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:21,960
Evening will come,

801
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:24,160
and the end will be known.

802
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:57,280
Run, Metellus, to the legions!

803
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,560
To the legions, comrades!

804
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:02,320
Let them set out compact
against Octavius' wing.

805
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,680
The enemy front is weaker there.

806
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,480
A sudden push will upset them.

807
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,120
To the victory of freedom!

808
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:15,480
Men, all together,
victory is within our grasp.

809
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,680
For freedom...

810
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,280
My companions,
Brutus is resisting and attacking,

811
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,240
Octavius' wing is wobbling,

812
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,680
but we are worn out,

813
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,000
our part is giving in against Antony.

814
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:38,280
Cassius orders a counterattack.

815
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,400
Resist, fight, resist!

816
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,800
The order
is to cover Cassius' retreat,

817
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,080
Brutus orders:
cover Cassius' retreat.

818
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,840
Defend the camps
until the bitter end!

819
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,160
Retreat in an orderly fashion,
comrades!

820
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:57,480
Comrades, no one alive to the enemy!

821
01:01:57,559 --> 01:02:00,920
Titinius is surrounded
by Antony's cavalry.

822
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,560
The shields, comrades!

823
01:02:03,639 --> 01:02:05,240
The shields!

824
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:09,600
Where are you fleeing to,
you cowardly beasts?

825
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:15,560
More than the enemy
you should fear the ire of Cassius.

826
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:17,560
Come back and fight,

827
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:20,680
you bastards, it's not over.

828
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,800
The camp is taken.

829
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:29,080
The Roman sun has sunk.

830
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:33,520
Our day is done, my comrades,

831
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:36,840
honor to the sacrifice
of the fallen.

832
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,600
Honor to the fallen.

833
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,040
Silence.

834
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:50,040
For our farewell, I ask for silence.

835
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,720
I risked all my freedom
in a single battle

836
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,440
and I lost.

837
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:02,080
One day like today

838
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:04,760
I breathed for the first time.

839
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,000
Now my time is over

840
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,440
I'll end it without regrets,

841
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,560
to go back there

842
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:19,360
where everything began.

843
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:27,960
Cassius is no more.

844
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:30,360
Honor to Cassius!

845
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,320
Are you still that powerful,
Julius Caesar?

846
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,480
Your shadow roams here

847
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:44,440
on the Plain of Philippi

848
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:48,040
and turns our weapons on ourselves.

849
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,120
Trebonius, help me to die.

850
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:16,440
And I should do something like that?

851
01:04:17,719 --> 01:04:19,480
Never, Brutus.

852
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,560
Metellus, you do it.

853
01:04:38,199 --> 01:04:39,720
What, Brutus?

854
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,360
You're asking this of me?

855
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,200
Never, never.

856
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:53,720
Take this sword.

857
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,000
No, Brutus, I'd rather kill myself.

858
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,200
Decius, my comrade,

859
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,760
I feel my time has come.

860
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:09,280
No, it hasn't, Brutus.

861
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,160
It has.

862
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:13,680
On the edge of the abyss,

863
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,040
it is more dignified
to throw ourselves down

864
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:19,000
than be pushed by them.

865
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:23,200
Remember
when we went to school together?

866
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,200
We sat next to each other.

867
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,280
Please.

868
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,840
No.

869
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:35,560
Let's flee.

870
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:38,800
Let's flee, Brutus,
let's save ourselves.

871
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:47,240
Strato, not you, please, stay.

872
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,680
Hold my sword

873
01:05:56,199 --> 01:05:57,920
and turn your face away.

874
01:05:58,599 --> 01:06:00,120
Help me to die.

875
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:02,640
Will you?

876
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:05,800
Give me your hand first.

877
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,640
Farewell, my lord.

878
01:06:09,639 --> 01:06:11,120
Farewell, good Strato.

879
01:08:43,159 --> 01:08:45,640
Since I got to know art,

880
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,600
this cell has become a prison.
