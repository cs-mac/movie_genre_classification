1
00:01:52,998 --> 00:01:54,533
Swannie.

2
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:57,291
Come over here.

3
00:01:58,181 --> 00:02:00,394
Come to me.

4
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:05,707
Nice, Swan.

5
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,166
Come on.

6
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:14,819
Come to me, Mr. Swan.

7
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,710
You'll frighten it!

8
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:23,408
Help!

9
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:27,597
Help!

10
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:30,418
Go get my parents.
Go!

11
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:53,288
I've killed him.

12
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:56,495
I've killed him.

13
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:58,697
I kill...

14
00:02:58,698 --> 00:03:01,162
ohh.

15
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:06,804
Ohh.

16
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:11,542
Nathan!

17
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,363
Oh Jesus.

18
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:17,642
- Where's Claire?
- Call 911!

19
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:19,786
- I don't know what happened!
- Where is she?

20
00:03:19,787 --> 00:03:23,146
- He came out of nowhere!
- Nathan...

21
00:03:23,147 --> 00:03:26,070
Do you think he can hear me?

22
00:03:26,348 --> 00:03:28,298
Where's Claire?

23
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:29,866
Where is she?

24
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:32,276
I'll look for her later!

25
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:15,118
I was dead.

26
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:17,839
I mean,

27
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,918
I was really dead.

28
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,426
Really.

29
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:25,807
Tell me about it.

30
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,375
What's it like to be dead?

31
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:32,982
I'd got loose.

32
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:38,298
It were as if I was
getting out of my body.

33
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:42,511
My body was staying here,
and I...

34
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:45,020
I was flying.

35
00:04:46,258 --> 00:04:48,464
You were floating?

36
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:51,218
Yes.

37
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:53,808
I heard that dog,
and a woman screaming.

38
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:56,560
They were around me,
panicking and...

39
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:59,632
then I heard that noise.

40
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,968
It was like a whistle.

41
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,624
A very, very loud whistle.

42
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:09,521
I saw... a light.

43
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:10,608
A light?

44
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:14,813
Yes.

45
00:05:15,603 --> 00:05:17,778
It was alive.

46
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:21,912
It was alive
as if it were waiting for me.

47
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:24,850
I was in the light.

48
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:26,707
I felt good.

49
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,746
- Didn't you want to come back?
- No.

50
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:32,019
But you did come back.

51
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,048
Yes.

52
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,979
Why did you come back?

53
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,915
I just did.

54
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,444
Something made you come back.

55
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:46,617
Is there something you're holding back?

56
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:51,258
Yes.

57
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,844
Hey, would you like
to hear about Jesus Christ?

58
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:56,636
Here you go.

59
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:02,996
Would you like to hear

60
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:05,556
Excuse me, would you like to hear
about Jesus Christ today?

61
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:06,806
Like to hear about Jesus Christ?

62
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:08,180
- Okay.
- Thank you very much, sir.

63
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:09,813
Would you like to hear
about Jesus Christ? Have a great day.

64
00:06:09,814 --> 00:06:13,632
Would you like to hear
about Jesus Christ today?

65
00:06:37,654 --> 00:06:40,279
But what made him come back?

66
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,683
Won't you answer?

67
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:46,468
Nathan?

68
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,345
Right turn.

69
00:06:54,618 --> 00:06:55,896
It doesn't recover.

70
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,734
We're dropping the...

71
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:04,515
Speed, 220 knots.

72
00:07:05,497 --> 00:07:08,421
Wings lowered.

73
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:11,544
Flap up.
Flap up! Flap up!

74
00:07:11,545 --> 00:07:13,594
Power! Power!

75
00:07:13,595 --> 00:07:15,579
Oh, shit!

76
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,777
No!

77
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,371
Of the 45 passengers on board,

78
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:35,930
nine belonged
to the same family.

79
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:37,795
All from Haiti.

80
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:39,723
So?

81
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:42,428
So they're afraid of getting
fucked over by the Warsaw Convention.

82
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,300
I explained to them
that doesn't exist here,

83
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:45,916
but they're scared,
even still.

84
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,453
They set up a committee.

85
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:49,051
I met their spokesman.

86
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,620
They gave me this.

87
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:52,252
What does the NTSB say about this?

88
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:53,469
The NTSB isn't getting involved.

89
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,940
Neither is the FAA.

90
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,732
They've all washed their
hands of it.

91
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,717
The airline is registered
in the Virgin Islands,

92
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:00,252
the tour operator in the Caymans.

93
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:02,172
The crew is from Russia.
They still don't know...

94
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:04,540
if the plane crashed in Haiti
or the Dominican Republic.

95
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,981
Every day it's a different story.

96
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:08,477
But the plane was due
to land here in the US?

97
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:09,725
Seems like everyone forgot that.

98
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:12,028
The FAA isn't going
to go poking its nose in.

99
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:15,684
Too much work, too much hassle,
too much everything.

100
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:21,118
Nathan?

101
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:24,159
I don't like the smell of it.

102
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,823
If the FAA won't get involved,

103
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:28,414
that means a lawsuit like this
could drag on for years.

104
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,591
That means hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

105
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:33,535
And it means we can forget
about the Hague Protocol.

106
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:35,614
I don't like it.

107
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,566
Excuse me,

108
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:40,574
since when are we afraid of cases
that drag on for years?

109
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:42,623
These people are going
to get fucked over

110
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:44,160
on the pretext that no convention...

111
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:46,976
It was the same shit in Unterlinguen.

112
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:48,416
In Kinshasa too.

113
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:51,520
A judge will show up
with his calculator and say what?

114
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:53,760
"All right, let's imagine
some two-year-old kid

115
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:55,328
"who has lost his mother.

116
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:56,608
"We'll say she'd have devoted

117
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:59,296
how much of her time
to him, per day?"

118
00:08:59,297 --> 00:09:01,377
- Michael?
- Three hours, tops.

119
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:04,200
That's a good mother.

120
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,753
Up until the age of 18,

121
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:11,233
which gives us three hours
a day, times 365 days,

122
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:13,505
times $8 an hour,

123
00:09:13,506 --> 00:09:15,330
plus the usual interest...

124
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:17,698
that totals a little less

125
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:19,619
than $100,000 at best.

126
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:21,826
- And the plane wasn't even full.
- See?

127
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,586
How far will that get you?

128
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:27,042
You can't even take your mistress
on a weekend trip.

129
00:09:27,043 --> 00:09:28,097
Nothing.

130
00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:31,491
All right, fine.
But tomorrow morning,

131
00:09:31,492 --> 00:09:33,635
these people are going
to be in my office.

132
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:36,291
- What do you want me to tell them?
- Send them to me.

133
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:39,628
I'll explain everything.
They'll understand, don't worry.

134
00:09:40,995 --> 00:09:43,504
Anything else?

135
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:07,973
Your appointment is here.

136
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,636
Who is this guy?
Remind me.

137
00:10:09,637 --> 00:10:10,692
Joseph Kay.

138
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,388
Heads up a department at St. Louis.

139
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:15,011
- I'm not sure what he wants.
- Heads up a department?

140
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:16,358
Something like that.

141
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:17,381
"Something like that".

142
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:18,534
"I'm not sure what he wants".

143
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,911
What's that supposed to mean?

144
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,671
Why send him to me?

145
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:24,594
- You were recommended.
- By who?

146
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:27,478
- Who upstairs?
- Ross.

147
00:10:27,815 --> 00:10:30,028
I see.

148
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:37,445
- Your daughter called.
- Oh, yeah?

149
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:39,046
- Your daughter called.
- Oh, yeah?

150
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:40,966
She left you messages at home and...

151
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:42,374
Yeah, I know.
I forgot.

152
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,519
She wanted to talk
about the vacation.

153
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,857
She wanted to know,
was it, "Like the usual?"

154
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:49,384
This was my daughter
who called or my wife?

155
00:10:49,385 --> 00:10:51,249
Your daughter.

156
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:54,261
Okay, I'll call her back.

157
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,536
Yes?

158
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,296
All that glucose...

159
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,865
Yes?

160
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,373
Worries me.

161
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,465
I can examine you if you want.

162
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:13,590
I'm a doctor.

163
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:15,561
All right...

164
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:17,513
what can I do for you, Dr. Kay?

165
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:18,858
You work at St. Louis, right?

166
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:20,394
I don't know if I'm the right...

167
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:22,794
Nathan, I believe you
have misunderstood me.

168
00:11:22,795 --> 00:11:23,915
I'm very serious.

169
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,250
You mustn't take
hypoglycemia lightly.

170
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:30,090
In fact, you shouldn't
take any symptom lightly... ever.

171
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:33,034
You can't imagine the number
of cells you burn up every day.

172
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:34,762
Of course, you'll tell me
you're also manufacturing...

173
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:36,843
- I don't want to interrupt...
- But it's not so.

174
00:11:36,844 --> 00:11:39,146
Neurons can't be replaced.
Some die every day.

175
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:40,587
Every day a few more.

176
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:44,298
All that glucose you're pumping in
is just cheap energy.

177
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:47,020
Very bad for you,
very bad for the neurons.

178
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:50,924
Thank you for your concern
about my health, but I'm fine.

179
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:54,775
Now why don't you tell me
what you want from me?

180
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:57,643
That slight shaking in your hands,

181
00:11:57,644 --> 00:11:59,468
have you had that a long time?

182
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,227
It's a morning thing, right?

183
00:12:01,228 --> 00:12:02,572
When you wake up?

184
00:12:02,573 --> 00:12:06,252
You work too much.

185
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:07,242
Sure.

186
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:10,134
Excuse me.

187
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,037
Oui, mon ange.

188
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:15,926
Yes, sweetheart, I know.

189
00:12:16,142 --> 00:12:17,870
Yeah, yeah.

190
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,917
Daddy will call you back,
but now I'm...

191
00:12:19,918 --> 00:12:22,426
wait, hang on.

192
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:26,550
Would you excuse me a second?

193
00:12:26,768 --> 00:12:28,142
Yeah?

194
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:30,934
Uh-huh.

195
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,743
Honey, I can't talk to you now.

196
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:36,879
Rachel, check out
that guy for me... now.

197
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,735
Of course you're coming for vacation.

198
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:40,590
Sure you are.

199
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:42,254
No, honey, I can't come get you.

200
00:12:42,255 --> 00:12:44,719
We'll do just like last time, I...

201
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,023
We'll see.

202
00:12:47,024 --> 00:12:49,616
Okay, I'll call you back.
Love you.

203
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:52,144
Don't ever do this to me again.
Ever.

204
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:53,904
I've got a screwball in my office.

205
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:55,984
He may be a screwball,
but he wasn't lying.

206
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:58,558
He's head of a department at St. Louis.

207
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:00,368
Ross didn't tell you anything else?

208
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:02,330
No, nothing.

209
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,553
They say the swan sings only once,

210
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:15,089
just before dying.

211
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,146
Yes, I know.

212
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:18,770
He senses he's going to die,
so he sings.

213
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:20,498
It's not because of the pain.

214
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,866
On the contrary,
he sings because he's glad.

215
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:24,530
He's glad to die.

216
00:13:24,531 --> 00:13:27,059
- The number of legends about swans...
- Dr. Kay.

217
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,010
They also say swans

218
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,410
guide and keep company
with the dead,

219
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,394
to help them cross the threshold.

220
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,986
That's my favorite...
a very old Celtic legend.

221
00:13:35,987 --> 00:13:37,554
- Yes, I know it.
- You do?

222
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:40,531
- Yes, my wife told me about it.
- Your wife told you about it?

223
00:13:40,532 --> 00:13:42,743
Right.

224
00:13:43,187 --> 00:13:45,663
You mean your ex-wife?

225
00:13:46,773 --> 00:13:49,215
We all live in glass houses.

226
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:52,468
So I see.

227
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:55,027
Why don't you finally tell me
what I can do for you?

228
00:13:55,028 --> 00:13:57,941
I believe I'm the one
who can do something for you.

229
00:13:57,942 --> 00:13:59,541
But you'll see for yourself.

230
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:02,229
Certain experiences
can be very unsettling.

231
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,076
I'll see what, for God's sake?
What experiences?

232
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:08,915
I'm merely pointing out
the need to be prepared.

233
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,997
Is that a threat?

234
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:12,789
No, it's not a threat.

235
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,484
It's a message.

236
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:18,171
But I'm not quite sure
you're ready to hear it.

237
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,044
How come you know
so much about me?

238
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:22,646
Did you have me checked out?
Did you...

239
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:24,822
was it Ross
told you all that stuff?

240
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:27,095
"The need to be prepared".
What's that supposed to mean?

241
00:14:27,096 --> 00:14:28,694
I don't know this Ross person.

242
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:30,645
I've never met the guy.

243
00:14:30,646 --> 00:14:33,526
And I think you know
what I want from you.

244
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:35,686
I think you know very well.

245
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,011
Hello?

246
00:15:58,012 --> 00:16:00,323
It's me.

247
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:03,228
Claire, hello.

248
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,508
Yeah, I'm here.

249
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,485
Is Tracey there?

250
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:09,020
Yeah, sure.
You want to talk to her?

251
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:12,125
She called me today.
She wanted me to call back.

252
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:14,599
I know, she told me.

253
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,188
Um, Tracey's asleep.
She's in bed.

254
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,524
Already? Is she okay?
What's wrong?

255
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:25,854
She waited for you to call all day.

256
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,382
She's drawing things
I don't understand

257
00:16:28,383 --> 00:16:30,573
and waking up at night.

258
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:32,062
No, she's not okay.

259
00:16:32,063 --> 00:16:34,909
Is there anything I can do?

260
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:43,327
Let's talk about this
another time, okay?

261
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:44,734
I'll tell her you called.

262
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:47,014
Okay.

263
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:29,385
Nathan.

264
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:32,131
Nathan!
Nathan.

265
00:17:32,132 --> 00:17:35,618
Listen, I came to apologize
for this morning.

266
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:39,107
I was a little heavy-handed
and I wanted to apologize.

267
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:42,017
I have something to show you
not far from here.

268
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:43,009
Nathan, wait.
Listen.

269
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,611
I have something to show you,

270
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:47,426
I just don't know if you'll be able
to handle it, that's all.

271
00:17:47,427 --> 00:17:49,986
I'm fed up with your mysteries.
I'm tired.

272
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:52,067
Nathan, it'll take
five minutes of your time,

273
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:53,957
no more.
And then I'm out of here.

274
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,516
You'll never see me again.
I give you my word.

275
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:59,055
- You give me your word?
- Yes.

276
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:01,093
I give you my word.
You know who I am,

277
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:03,110
you know where I work,
you're a lawyer.

278
00:18:03,111 --> 00:18:06,276
If I do anything wrong,
anything at all which...

279
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:10,052
It wouldn't take you five minutes
to blow my career out of the water.

280
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:12,996
Nathan, believe me,
it's important.

281
00:18:12,996 --> 00:18:14,212
You have to see it.

282
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:16,645
I swear.

283
00:18:16,646 --> 00:18:20,244
It's important.
Come with me.

284
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:25,094
Five minutes.
10 minutes... no more.

285
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:27,951
And then... I'm gone.

286
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:37,253
You brought me here
just to tell me this?

287
00:18:37,254 --> 00:18:38,406
What the hell does it mean?

288
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:40,390
Or is that all part of the message?

289
00:18:40,391 --> 00:18:42,406
You come out with these
little riddles of yours

290
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:44,647
and expect me to...

291
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:47,750
You see that guy,
the kid in the orange jacket?

292
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,806
Do you see him?

293
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:50,790
Yeah, I see him.
So what?

294
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,447
Name of Dennis.
10 years ago to this day,

295
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:54,856
his father died here.

296
00:18:54,857 --> 00:18:58,824
He was waiting for a train
as he did every evening.

297
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:01,577
He had a good job, happy family.

298
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:05,705
And one evening, he'd had enough.

299
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:08,264
And when the express came by,
he jumped.

300
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:10,408
Was he a friend of yours?

301
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:12,072
And these last few days,

302
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:14,666
Dennis has come here
every evening.

303
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,968
- Every evening.
- Do you ever answer a question?

304
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:18,857
Look at him.

305
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,777
- Why should I?
- Look at him.

306
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:24,329
Because in about two minutes,

307
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,233
Dennis there will be dead.

308
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,098
What the f...

309
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,769
You're crazy.

310
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:40,562
Completely crazy.

311
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,211
You gotta take the Chambers Street Exit,
right across the platform.

312
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:19,276
Look!

313
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:20,428
He's got a gun!

314
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:23,212
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!

315
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:25,229
Listen, don't do it!

316
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,278
Please,
put the gun down!

317
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:02,210
Is this your first time?

318
00:22:02,996 --> 00:22:06,683
You seem kind of young.

319
00:22:09,716 --> 00:22:11,252
He's here to see Dr. Kay.

320
00:22:11,253 --> 00:22:13,684
- Okay.
- He'll come get you in the day room.

321
00:22:13,685 --> 00:22:15,060
- This way?
- Mm-hmm.

322
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:18,496
I... I think what you're
doing is wonderful.

323
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,254
You came to see him?

324
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:57,224
He'll be here.
Just have to wait.

325
00:22:59,737 --> 00:23:02,145
Come here.

326
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:05,720
Come here.

327
00:23:05,721 --> 00:23:08,183
What's the matter?

328
00:23:08,184 --> 00:23:10,627
Something wrong?

329
00:23:13,464 --> 00:23:16,899
Myocardial metastases.

330
00:23:17,113 --> 00:23:18,552
Cancer of the heart muscle.

331
00:23:18,553 --> 00:23:21,093
Super rare, right?

332
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:23,800
They wrote an article
about me in a magazine.

333
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:26,391
It's in my room,
if you want to see it.

334
00:23:26,392 --> 00:23:32,410
Apparently, I could croak
from one day to the next...

335
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:36,773
from one minute to the next.

336
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:41,017
- Jeremy.
- Nathan.

337
00:23:41,018 --> 00:23:42,395
What do you do, Nathan?

338
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:45,306
I'm a lawyer. Do you know
if he's going to be long?

339
00:23:45,307 --> 00:23:49,953
The first doc I saw,
you know what he called it?

340
00:23:50,107 --> 00:23:52,794
"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy".

341
00:23:52,795 --> 00:23:54,619
Wow.

342
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,771
Can you believe that guy?

343
00:23:58,941 --> 00:24:01,307
You and me,

344
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:02,939
we're gonna slap that...
that son-of-a-bitch with a lawsuit.

345
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,996
What do you say?

346
00:24:03,997 --> 00:24:06,173
Legally, that's not exactly my bag.

347
00:24:06,174 --> 00:24:07,741
Jeremy, hello.

348
00:24:07,742 --> 00:24:10,364
- Up already?
- Yeah.

349
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,828
- Happy birthday.
- Yeah, thanks.

350
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:15,452
You've made a new friend.

351
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,211
- Are you the new volunteer?
- He's a lawyer.

352
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:20,157
He and I are gonna throw
a doctor's ass in the slammer.

353
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:24,716
Oh, well... see you later.

354
00:24:25,182 --> 00:24:27,176
Bye.

355
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:35,364
You smell that stink?

356
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:37,886
Like something's rotting?

357
00:24:37,887 --> 00:24:40,062
Behind the stink of detergent...

358
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,439
can't you smell that?

359
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:45,759
It reeks of death around here.

360
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,096
Why do you think
she puts up with it?

361
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,830
She had a kid who died.
That's why.

362
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:59,008
All of us in here
are going out in body bags,

363
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:01,166
and she knows that.

364
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:06,207
She thinks that when we see
her little darling up there...

365
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:07,744
we'll tell him
how mommy's doing.

366
00:25:07,745 --> 00:25:09,472
And we'll take care of him.

367
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:13,760
Make sure he eats his dinner
and goes to the potty up in Heaven.

368
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:16,320
Volunteer, my ass.

369
00:25:16,321 --> 00:25:17,920
What about you?

370
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:19,873
You got a message to send, too?

371
00:25:19,874 --> 00:25:22,151
Who you got up there, huh?

372
00:25:22,818 --> 00:25:26,569
I'm going soon,
so make the most of it.

373
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:29,569
Some "dearly beloved?"

374
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,426
- Or maybe...
- Excuse me.

375
00:25:31,427 --> 00:25:32,898
Hey!

376
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,082
Hey, come back.

377
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:37,420
I didn't mean it like that.

378
00:25:45,284 --> 00:25:48,515
I don't know how to die.

379
00:25:48,516 --> 00:25:51,207
None of us know how to die.

380
00:25:52,514 --> 00:25:56,130
But maybe...

381
00:25:56,131 --> 00:25:59,044
somewhere deep inside of us...

382
00:25:59,045 --> 00:26:00,772
a part of us does know how.

383
00:26:00,773 --> 00:26:05,764
Maybe it's not as terrible
as it seems.

384
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:08,812
Try and rest.

385
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:11,108
You know, Nathan,
the dying have taught me one thing...

386
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:14,501
You know, Nathan,
the dying have taught me one thing...

387
00:26:14,502 --> 00:26:17,572
that you can look death in the face
and go on living.

388
00:26:17,573 --> 00:26:20,004
Our mission here is
to keep them company.

389
00:26:20,005 --> 00:26:22,469
Keep company with those
about to die

390
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,484
so that they can depart in peace.

391
00:26:24,485 --> 00:26:27,076
Great, but what's it
got to do with me?

392
00:26:27,077 --> 00:26:28,196
Me, my.

393
00:26:28,197 --> 00:26:29,701
My little consciousness,

394
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:32,357
my little comforts,
my little life.

395
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:36,518
What about others, Nathan,
do you ever think about them?

396
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:39,687
And Dennis?
Have you thought about Dennis?

397
00:26:39,688 --> 00:26:41,733
If you knew he was going
to blow his brains out,

398
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:42,885
why didn't you do something?

399
00:26:42,886 --> 00:26:45,287
Why didn't you try to listen to him?

400
00:26:45,288 --> 00:26:47,559
Who kept Dennis company
so he'd "depart in peace?"

401
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,885
Anyway, how did you know
he was going to die?

402
00:26:50,886 --> 00:26:52,645
This time I want an answer,
none of your...

403
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:54,278
- I saw it.
- You saw it?

404
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,686
- Yes.
- How did you see it?

405
00:26:55,687 --> 00:26:57,574
Was it written on his face?

406
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,008
- Yes.
- Yes?

407
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:02,951
Listen, I'm beat.
I didn't sleep last night because of you,

408
00:27:02,952 --> 00:27:05,384
- and I've got to be at work...
- Nathan,

409
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:06,471
people who come here,

410
00:27:06,472 --> 00:27:09,609
they've already traveled
a long road

411
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,400
paved with suffering.

412
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:15,032
But they have had time
to prepare themselves.

413
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:17,544
But often death comes...

414
00:27:17,545 --> 00:27:19,624
unexpectedly.
It can't be predicted.

415
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:20,807
Yes, I know, yes.

416
00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:24,424
For instance, say you cross
the street at the wrong moment,

417
00:27:24,425 --> 00:27:27,465
or the body just gives out...
just like that.

418
00:27:27,466 --> 00:27:29,193
Snap your fingers,
you're dead.

419
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:30,633
We see that every day.

420
00:27:30,634 --> 00:27:33,930
And those people never have
time to untangle the knots.

421
00:27:33,931 --> 00:27:36,936
They never have time
to prepare themselves.

422
00:27:36,937 --> 00:27:38,026
And so?

423
00:27:38,027 --> 00:27:40,850
And so...

424
00:27:41,066 --> 00:27:44,616
the role of the Messengers
is to give those people too

425
00:27:44,617 --> 00:27:47,050
a chance to be reconciled.

426
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:50,038
- "The Messengers?"
- Yes.

427
00:27:53,962 --> 00:27:55,690
I don't understand.

428
00:27:55,691 --> 00:27:58,475
There are people out there
who know in advance

429
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,556
that someone is going to die.

430
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:03,276
Let's say they...
"got the message".

431
00:28:03,277 --> 00:28:05,164
And in those cases,

432
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:09,645
their job is to help that person
depart in peace... reconcile.

433
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:12,013
- And you're one of these "Messengers?"
- Yes, I am.

434
00:28:12,014 --> 00:28:13,740
- You know who's going to die?
- Yes.

435
00:28:13,741 --> 00:28:15,660
- You see it?
- Yes, I see it.

436
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:18,713
And you help them depart in peace.

437
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,996
Nathan, I realize it
may be hard to believe...

438
00:28:21,997 --> 00:28:25,170
But Dennis didn't depart in peace.

439
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,701
- No.
- Why?

440
00:28:26,702 --> 00:28:29,421
We don't always succeed.
Sometimes we get there too late.

441
00:28:29,422 --> 00:28:31,693
No one has power over
the hour of death.

442
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:33,405
No one.

443
00:28:33,743 --> 00:28:35,726
I don't believe you.

444
00:28:35,727 --> 00:28:37,806
Have it your way, Nathan.

445
00:28:37,807 --> 00:28:39,693
But these things can still exist

446
00:28:39,694 --> 00:28:42,419
whether you believe
in them or not.

447
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,966
I know when someone's
going to die... I see it.

448
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:50,613
And I make every effort
to prepare them for what's coming.

449
00:28:50,735 --> 00:28:53,406
Well, I think I've
heard enough for today.

450
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,774
What exactly are you
trying to tell me?

451
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:24,273
Are you trying to tell me
I'm going to die soon? Is that it?

452
00:29:24,274 --> 00:29:28,337
I told you everything.
You know everything.

453
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:30,714
Go fuck yourself.

454
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,059
Hurry up.

455
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,690
Sam.
Sam, hurry up.

456
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:57,170
Bring that over.
Hurry up.

457
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,417
Breathe, breathe,
breathe.

458
00:29:58,418 --> 00:30:02,432
We need a neck brace and a splint.
Get that here.

459
00:31:11,768 --> 00:31:15,000
Look straight into the light.

460
00:31:15,001 --> 00:31:16,865
Don't move.

461
00:32:01,915 --> 00:32:03,642
The smell of the ghosts.

462
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:06,555
Follow the smell of the ghosts
and you'll find the flower.

463
00:32:06,556 --> 00:32:08,828
Nathan on phone:
What did you say, sweetheart?

464
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:10,043
It's a cactus.

465
00:32:10,044 --> 00:32:12,507
It makes a flower once a year,
at midnight.

466
00:32:12,508 --> 00:32:14,013
Only once.

467
00:32:14,014 --> 00:32:16,923
At 12:00 noon, the flower dies,
and it smells like ghosts.

468
00:32:16,924 --> 00:32:18,844
The flower smells like ghosts?

469
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:19,997
Yeah,
but it's real nice.

470
00:32:19,998 --> 00:32:21,916
Mommy says ghosts smell good.

471
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:24,221
The Night Blooming Cereus.
Yes, I remember.

472
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:25,853
Mommy told me about it too.

473
00:32:25,854 --> 00:32:27,996
An Indian legend.

474
00:32:27,997 --> 00:32:29,788
Honey, can I talk to Mommy?

475
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:32,317
She says she'll call you back.

476
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:34,557
Tracey?

477
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:36,868
Hello?

478
00:32:40,671 --> 00:32:42,749
I had everything checked out,
everything...

479
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,406
brain, heart, lungs, blood.

480
00:32:45,407 --> 00:32:47,805
I got my urine tested,
my saliva, my sperm...

481
00:32:47,806 --> 00:32:49,438
they tested everything

482
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:50,654
and they found nothing.

483
00:32:50,655 --> 00:32:52,349
Nothing at all.
There's the file.

484
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,662
Take a look.

485
00:32:53,663 --> 00:32:55,870
A little hypoglycemia
and nothing else.

486
00:32:55,871 --> 00:32:57,800
Nothing else at all.

487
00:32:58,335 --> 00:32:59,933
I'm very glad to hear that, Nathan.

488
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:01,789
- I'm happy for you.
- So as of this minute,

489
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,069
you are out of my life.

490
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,183
No phone calls,
no visits, nothing.

491
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:08,032
If I ever see you again
here or any place at all,

492
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:09,696
it'll mean the police...
got it?

493
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:11,232
May I show you something?

494
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:13,925
- No.
- It's a photograph.

495
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:16,481
Anna Rachevsky.

496
00:33:16,482 --> 00:33:17,823
Very cute.
Now leave.

497
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,296
From a Russian family.

498
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:22,463
That photograph was taken
the day she arrived in New York.

499
00:33:22,464 --> 00:33:24,768
I don't give a shit.

500
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,817
Not much money,
father out of the picture.

501
00:33:26,818 --> 00:33:29,217
She wanted to go to college,
but the closest she ever got

502
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:32,390
was working in
the cafeteria at NYU.

503
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,783
Her boss treated her
like an animal.

504
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:37,358
The students didn't even notice.

505
00:33:37,633 --> 00:33:38,689
Except one.

506
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,027
He was a foreigner too...

507
00:33:42,114 --> 00:33:44,141
a Frenchman.

508
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:47,010
She welcomed the kindness
he showed her.

509
00:33:47,011 --> 00:33:48,801
But later, she was fired.

510
00:33:48,802 --> 00:33:51,299
He lost touch with her.

511
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,425
End of story.

512
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:58,050
Anna Rachevsky, right.

513
00:33:58,051 --> 00:33:59,779
- Coming back?
- Yes.

514
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,235
She works at the Greenwind diner
in Queens.

515
00:34:03,236 --> 00:34:04,291
Late night shift.

516
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,531
Not very well paying.

517
00:34:06,531 --> 00:34:10,098
She's had a child...
a son.

518
00:34:10,372 --> 00:34:12,483
You should stop by and see her.

519
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:15,267
I'm sure she would
enjoy that very much.

520
00:34:15,268 --> 00:34:17,125
I'll do that, maybe, yes.

521
00:34:17,126 --> 00:34:19,087
Good.

522
00:34:19,973 --> 00:34:22,000
What?

523
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:24,197
Have you understood me?

524
00:34:24,198 --> 00:34:26,442
No.

525
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:28,581
What?

526
00:34:28,582 --> 00:34:30,117
What was it this time?
What did you see?

527
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:32,324
Tell me.
A blinking light?

528
00:34:32,325 --> 00:34:34,179
Some kind of Christmas tree
that begins to...

529
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,653
No, actually, Nathan,

530
00:34:35,654 --> 00:34:38,278
it's a bright white light
that surrounds the person.

531
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:39,878
But that's not the most
important thing.

532
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:42,278
What's the most important thing?

533
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:46,412
The most important thing
is suddenly you'll just know.

534
00:34:46,758 --> 00:34:50,389
You'll know she's going to die.

535
00:35:23,912 --> 00:35:26,258
Nathan?

536
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:29,353
What are you doing here?

537
00:35:29,354 --> 00:35:30,441
Doing?
Well, I...

538
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:32,883
I'm just here.

539
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:36,310
You're as handsome as ever.

540
00:35:37,577 --> 00:35:38,826
Well?

541
00:35:38,827 --> 00:35:40,970
What? No, I just...

542
00:35:40,971 --> 00:35:43,179
actually I was passing through.

543
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,809
You doing okay?

544
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,921
You were passing through here?

545
00:35:46,922 --> 00:35:49,227
Yes, I was going back
to the city.

546
00:35:49,228 --> 00:35:51,593
I was in Queens
and I was going home.

547
00:35:51,594 --> 00:35:55,051
I was dying for a cup of coffee,
and here I am.

548
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:56,555
You go heavy
on the sugar, huh?

549
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:59,249
Yes. You're looking well.

550
00:36:00,138 --> 00:36:02,249
- What?
- I said you're looking well.

551
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,530
How's your health?
Okay?

552
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:05,930
You look like you're
in fine health.

553
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:07,926
Yes, fine.

554
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:11,339
It's strange for me,
seeing you again.

555
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,197
Excuse me.

556
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:34,988
- Are you married?
- Divorced.

557
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:36,333
Oh.

558
00:36:36,334 --> 00:36:38,254
I never had the time.

559
00:36:38,255 --> 00:36:40,076
He walked out before marrying me.

560
00:36:40,077 --> 00:36:43,629
He still found the time
to knock me up first though.

561
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,965
A good thing too,
you might say.

562
00:36:45,966 --> 00:36:47,961
A little boy.

563
00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:52,525
- What's this?
- It's for you.

564
00:36:52,526 --> 00:36:54,862
These are my numbers.
This one...

565
00:36:54,863 --> 00:36:57,005
is the direct line
to Rachel, my assistant,

566
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,477
and that's my cell phone.

567
00:36:58,478 --> 00:37:00,974
And don't hesitate to...

568
00:37:00,975 --> 00:37:02,351
if you need me for anything,

569
00:37:02,352 --> 00:37:04,557
if anything should come up,

570
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:06,254
call me. Okay?

571
00:37:06,255 --> 00:37:09,455
If anything comes up,
I call you.

572
00:37:09,456 --> 00:37:11,582
Okay.

573
00:37:12,112 --> 00:37:14,683
And what could possibly come up?

574
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:18,608
- How old is your daughter?
- Seven.

575
00:37:18,608 --> 00:37:20,336
Do you speak French with her?

576
00:37:20,337 --> 00:37:22,352
- No, not much.
- You should.

577
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:24,208
I know.

578
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:26,608
Look at me,
I hardly speak Russian anymore.

579
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:29,198
But when my father came back,
he talked and talked.

580
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,928
He wouldn't stop talking.

581
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:33,777
- Did I tell you my father came back?
- No.

582
00:37:33,778 --> 00:37:36,400
You know, we didn't hear
from him in years.

583
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:38,447
- From your father?
- Yes.

584
00:37:38,448 --> 00:37:41,175
He disappeared into air.

585
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:45,010
But then two weeks ago
we got a letter.

586
00:37:45,011 --> 00:37:47,281
And in this letter
there was a picture of him

587
00:37:47,282 --> 00:37:49,009
and his phone number
and address.

588
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,185
He was driving a cab
in Toronto.

589
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:55,378
And on the very same day,
he got a letter too.

590
00:37:55,379 --> 00:37:58,226
And in it was a picture of me
and my phone number,

591
00:37:58,226 --> 00:38:00,785
and a round trip ticket to New York.

592
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:05,082
See? So for the past two weeks
I believe in miracles.

593
00:38:05,843 --> 00:38:08,403
- And the letters were?
- We don't know who sent them.

594
00:38:08,404 --> 00:38:10,452
We tried,
but we never found out.

595
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:14,995
A Dr. Kay...
at St. Louis Hospital,

596
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:16,947
does it ring a bell?

597
00:38:16,948 --> 00:38:20,415
Fuck Ocean City,

598
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:23,508
Here's a long one.
"Dear, Jeremy,

599
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,555
I turn 17 today too".

600
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:26,996
Oh, his mother's
the one...

601
00:38:26,997 --> 00:38:29,203
Who asked you?

602
00:38:29,204 --> 00:38:31,232
Huh?

603
00:38:31,445 --> 00:38:34,132
"We don't know each other
and you may think this is weird,

604
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:36,212
but ever since I heard
your story on the radio,

605
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:38,228
I think about you often".

606
00:38:40,854 --> 00:38:43,190
"I wish you a very,
very happy birthday.

607
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:45,750
Write me if you want.
Love, Jennifer".

608
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:47,863
Right, yeah.
I love you too.

609
00:38:47,864 --> 00:38:50,293
Next time, send me a snapshot
of your cute ass, Jennifer.

610
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:53,205
Bye, bye.
Happy birthday.

611
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,830
Oh, a baby Jesus.
Great.

612
00:38:55,831 --> 00:38:57,463
Jeremy.

613
00:38:57,464 --> 00:38:59,766
- "Dear Jeremy, blah blah blah".
- Jeremy.

614
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:03,094
"with our hope you'll be able to leave
the hospital very soon".

615
00:39:03,095 --> 00:39:04,725
Jeremy, can you look at me?

616
00:39:04,726 --> 00:39:07,382
Asshole,
I'm going to die in this hospital!

617
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:10,372
That's why I'm here,
don't you fucking get it?

618
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:16,280
Jeremy, what's going on?

619
00:39:16,281 --> 00:39:18,422
What's going on is
that my dumbass mother

620
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:20,183
went on the radio
to tell the world

621
00:39:20,184 --> 00:39:23,831
that her poor little kid
was having a birthday soon

622
00:39:23,832 --> 00:39:27,351
and the poor angel was dying
of a very serious and rare disease.

623
00:39:27,352 --> 00:39:30,327
And then dozens of assholes
I don't even know,

624
00:39:30,328 --> 00:39:34,040
they're just writing me
to wish me a happy birthday,

625
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:36,312
and... fuck.

626
00:39:36,313 --> 00:39:37,400
Fuck.

627
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:39,479
Goddamn it,

628
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,754
why did this have
to happen to me?

629
00:39:43,802 --> 00:39:45,338
I'm 17.

630
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:47,738
I'm 17 fucking years old,
I don't understand.

631
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:49,529
Jeremy, you shouldn't
talk like that.

632
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,745
Oh, really?
So what,

633
00:39:50,746 --> 00:39:53,273
I should just sit here
with my mouth shut?

634
00:39:53,274 --> 00:39:57,921
You know what my mom said
when I told her I was gonna die?

635
00:39:58,075 --> 00:39:59,738
She just looked at me
and she was like,

636
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:03,369
"Oh, no, Jeremy, I forbid
you to say such a thing".

637
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:07,041
Well, I'm gonna die.
I know I'm gonna die.

638
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,978
And how does that
make you feel, Jeremy,

639
00:40:09,979 --> 00:40:12,259
knowing you're going to die?

640
00:40:15,196 --> 00:40:19,099
I think about all the good shit
I'm gonna miss out on.

641
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,148
And that makes you angry.

642
00:40:21,149 --> 00:40:23,819
Yeah.

643
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,091
And also I just...

644
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,787
I don't know.

645
00:40:29,788 --> 00:40:35,004
I want people to see me
like I normally am.

646
00:40:35,005 --> 00:40:37,065
You know?

647
00:40:38,173 --> 00:40:40,964
I want people to listen to me.

648
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,000
I just want someone to listen.

649
00:41:03,998 --> 00:41:06,604
I agreed to see you because...

650
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:11,853
I agreed to see you because...

651
00:41:12,321 --> 00:41:14,655
you've got a solid case.

652
00:41:21,633 --> 00:41:23,680
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

653
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:24,799
I don't speak Creole.

654
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,520
She says she lost both
of her sons in the accident.

655
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:30,432
She says she knows
you can help us.

656
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:35,264
- She says...
- Madame, please.

657
00:41:35,265 --> 00:41:36,704
...she's praying for you.

658
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:40,992
She also said
you have a big heart.

659
00:41:40,993 --> 00:41:42,880
- Tell her she's wrong.
- She can see it.

660
00:41:42,881 --> 00:41:45,185
- She's wrong!
- If you refuse to defend us,

661
00:41:45,186 --> 00:41:47,074
the other lawyers will find out,

662
00:41:47,075 --> 00:41:49,122
and they will refuse too.

663
00:41:49,122 --> 00:41:51,745
- All of them.
- Please, sir, do something for us.

664
00:41:51,746 --> 00:41:54,799
No.

665
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:59,467
No, that's not true.

666
00:42:03,427 --> 00:42:04,930
Okay.

667
00:42:04,931 --> 00:42:07,437
But you've got a solid case.

668
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:09,891
Okay.

669
00:42:31,877 --> 00:42:34,319
Pass it, pass it.

670
00:42:35,494 --> 00:42:38,285
- Alonzo!
- Take it home!

671
00:42:52,807 --> 00:42:55,973
Woman on TV:
"He asked whether the man

672
00:42:55,974 --> 00:42:58,662
"When he heard he was
under Herod's jurisdiction,

673
00:42:58,663 --> 00:43:00,934
"he sent him off to Herod,

674
00:43:00,935 --> 00:43:03,174
who was himself
in Jerusalem at that time".

675
00:43:03,175 --> 00:43:05,094
Man on TV:
"When Herod saw Jesus,

676
00:43:05,095 --> 00:43:06,566
"he was very glad,

677
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:09,478
"for he had been wanting
to see him for a long time.

678
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:11,079
"Because he had
heard about him

679
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:13,768
"and was hoping to see Jesus
perform some sign.

680
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:16,328
"Herod questioned him
at some length,

681
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:18,184
but Jesus gave him no answer".

682
00:43:33,896 --> 00:43:36,712
You know, she came

683
00:43:36,713 --> 00:43:41,736
She told me again what a wonderful
husband you were.

684
00:43:41,737 --> 00:43:43,815
Up there,

685
00:43:43,816 --> 00:43:47,154
she sees everything
you do for me.

686
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:53,642
The Blessed Virgin was
here too, you know.

687
00:43:53,643 --> 00:43:56,266
Oh? The Blessed Virgin
was here?

688
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:57,546
Yeah.

689
00:43:57,547 --> 00:44:00,371
She watched us
through the window.

690
00:44:03,371 --> 00:44:05,162
You see,

691
00:44:05,163 --> 00:44:06,954
there on the buffet...

692
00:44:06,955 --> 00:44:10,193
that's her hand.

693
00:44:10,827 --> 00:44:12,874
She left that there for us

694
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:16,245
to let us know
she's thinking about us.

695
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:24,860
That's your wife's hand.

696
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:29,194
You could kiss it, you know.

697
00:44:29,195 --> 00:44:31,532
No.

698
00:44:31,533 --> 00:44:34,487
Please.

699
00:44:38,126 --> 00:44:43,251
It's not a mother's job
to bury a daughter.

700
00:44:48,366 --> 00:44:51,320
No, it isn't.

701
00:44:51,695 --> 00:44:55,795
But you have to let the dead
lay with the dead.

702
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,454
You have to.

703
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,949
I saw Anna.

704
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,229
She said she'd never heard of you.

705
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:12,847
But the picture, the plane ticket...
I know it was you.

706
00:45:12,848 --> 00:45:14,190
What's your game?

707
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:16,272
Why are you toying
with these people?

708
00:45:16,273 --> 00:45:18,544
I simply did what I had to do.

709
00:45:18,544 --> 00:45:20,271
The father found his daughter again,

710
00:45:20,272 --> 00:45:22,682
and the daughter, her father.

711
00:45:23,377 --> 00:45:25,711
Anna's still going to die.

712
00:45:25,712 --> 00:45:28,079
But hopefully she'll die
more at peace with herself.

713
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,776
It's not a game.

714
00:45:29,777 --> 00:45:32,815
But if she's going to die,
protect her, do something!

715
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:35,739
There's nothing else
I can do.

716
00:45:35,857 --> 00:45:40,601
I told you, no one has power
over the hour of death.

717
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:06,352
Anna!

718
00:46:06,353 --> 00:46:07,282
Anna!

719
00:46:07,283 --> 00:46:09,745
- I think it's for you!
- Who is it?

720
00:46:09,746 --> 00:46:11,664
I think it's Mr. Handsome.

721
00:46:11,665 --> 00:46:14,239
Who is it?

722
00:46:14,836 --> 00:46:16,595
- Nathan?
- Hi.

723
00:46:16,596 --> 00:46:19,092
- What are you doing here?
- Am I disturbing you?

724
00:46:19,093 --> 00:46:22,290
No, of course not.
Come in, come in!

725
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:24,084
My cousin had
a baby this morning

726
00:46:24,085 --> 00:46:26,356
and we're celebrating his birth.

727
00:46:26,357 --> 00:46:28,275
You must have passed Micha.
He's the daddy.

728
00:46:28,276 --> 00:46:31,348
He just went out with Ivan,
my brother.

729
00:46:31,348 --> 00:46:34,803
And this is Marina, Stephanie.

730
00:46:34,804 --> 00:46:36,851
You've met Judy, my sister-in-law.

731
00:46:36,852 --> 00:46:39,284
Come on, I'll introduce you
to my mother.

732
00:46:39,285 --> 00:46:41,345
Mama.

733
00:46:42,613 --> 00:46:45,364
This is Nathan,
a good friend of mine.

734
00:46:45,365 --> 00:46:48,223
Nice to meet you.

735
00:46:50,326 --> 00:46:51,574
It's okay.
It's okay.

736
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:55,774
I'll handle it!

737
00:46:58,455 --> 00:46:59,958
We're wired to the building next door.

738
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:01,942
Maybe they cut something off.

739
00:47:03,544 --> 00:47:05,974
Hey, look who's here!

740
00:47:05,975 --> 00:47:07,861
This is my pride and joy.

741
00:47:07,862 --> 00:47:09,141
This is him!

742
00:47:09,142 --> 00:47:10,613
Papa, this is Nathan.

743
00:47:10,614 --> 00:47:12,213
- Hi.
- Glad to meet you.

744
00:47:12,214 --> 00:47:15,094
We met when I was
working at the university.

745
00:47:19,383 --> 00:47:21,398
Excuse me,
the light doesn't work.

746
00:47:22,457 --> 00:47:24,248
Anna, wait,
you shouldn't touch that.

747
00:47:24,249 --> 00:47:25,912
I've seen Ivan do it.
It couldn't be so complicated.

748
00:47:25,913 --> 00:47:27,800
Stop, please.
It's dangerous.

749
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:29,656
We cannot just stay
in the dark, can we?

750
00:47:29,657 --> 00:47:31,032
Listen to me, I'm serious.

751
00:47:31,033 --> 00:47:33,079
You have no idea
how many people...

752
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,064
No. Hold this for me!
Hold this!

753
00:47:35,065 --> 00:47:36,536
Just a second.
Okay.

754
00:47:36,537 --> 00:47:38,327
Here.

755
00:47:40,025 --> 00:47:41,753
Ahh.
You see?

756
00:47:41,754 --> 00:47:43,000
It works now.

757
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:46,073
Anna, I have to tell you...

758
00:47:49,753 --> 00:47:51,781
No, please.

759
00:47:52,602 --> 00:47:54,361
Fine. Okay.

760
00:47:54,362 --> 00:47:55,642
You're right.

761
00:47:55,643 --> 00:47:57,242
We'll take care of it later.

762
00:47:57,243 --> 00:47:58,681
Let's have a drink.

763
00:47:58,682 --> 00:48:00,569
I had a check-up recently...

764
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,010
- A what?
- A check-up.

765
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:03,002
Oh.

766
00:48:03,003 --> 00:48:05,434
And I said to myself...

767
00:48:05,435 --> 00:48:06,650
let's say,

768
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:08,986
maybe it would be
a good idea if you did too.

769
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:10,490
Had one.
A check-up.

770
00:48:10,491 --> 00:48:12,154
Me?
Why?

771
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:13,274
You never know.

772
00:48:13,275 --> 00:48:14,873
If you want,
I got the address...

773
00:48:14,874 --> 00:48:15,995
You want to marry me,

774
00:48:15,996 --> 00:48:17,115
but first you want
to make sure

775
00:48:17,116 --> 00:48:20,268
I'm the picture of health.
is that it?

776
00:48:21,117 --> 00:48:23,393
I was kidding.

777
00:48:23,676 --> 00:48:25,787
Have you ever tasted
Georgian vodka?

778
00:48:25,787 --> 00:48:27,324
No. Will you think about it?

779
00:48:27,325 --> 00:48:28,603
What, marrying you?

780
00:48:28,604 --> 00:48:31,356
If you take me to Paris,
no problem.

781
00:48:31,357 --> 00:48:32,698
Really, I'm fine.
I swear.

782
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:36,135
I can't see why
you're so worried.

783
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:37,787
Your health.

784
00:48:40,476 --> 00:48:42,299
Ivan?

785
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,994
Just a moment.
Ivan.

786
00:48:46,365 --> 00:48:48,060
Papa, don't touch that.

787
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,502
Papa!

788
00:48:55,263 --> 00:48:58,269
I have a right to it, my son has a right,
so does my father.

789
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,933
- No.
- Listen, he worked all his life

790
00:48:59,934 --> 00:49:02,812
and now he's up there
and he needs care,

791
00:49:02,813 --> 00:49:04,797
so don't tell me there's
nothing you can do.

792
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:05,791
You're going to treat him...

793
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:08,285
If you will kindly listen,
I will explain to you...

794
00:49:08,286 --> 00:49:11,613
I'm going to stay at his side
as long as he needs me.

795
00:49:11,614 --> 00:49:12,959
No, I will not kindly listen.

796
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,070
Excuse me, can I see
your supervisor?

797
00:49:15,071 --> 00:49:16,543
I'm the person in charge.

798
00:49:16,544 --> 00:49:18,174
Everything's fine.
It's okay.

799
00:49:18,175 --> 00:49:19,712
Your father is
a Canadian citizen

800
00:49:19,713 --> 00:49:21,919
and the program only applies
to American residents.

801
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,606
He is insured in Canada.
He has insurance.

802
00:49:24,607 --> 00:49:25,695
- Oh?
- Yes.

803
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:27,711
In that case,
he's sure to be covered.

804
00:49:27,712 --> 00:49:29,888
In the meantime, for us,
it makes no difference.

805
00:49:29,889 --> 00:49:32,864
- If it's a deposit you need...
- It's all right, don't worry.

806
00:49:32,865 --> 00:49:34,976
- For you it makes no difference?
- No. It makes no difference.

807
00:49:34,976 --> 00:49:36,448
Fine.
You go tell him.

808
00:49:36,449 --> 00:49:38,176
You go up
and tell him yourself.

809
00:49:38,177 --> 00:49:39,455
He's an adult,
you're an adult.

810
00:49:39,456 --> 00:49:41,216
- Mrs. Rachevsky?
- Just a second!

811
00:49:41,217 --> 00:49:43,647
So you go up and tell him
he left Russia for this.

812
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:46,049
That he came and find his children
in America all for this!

813
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,736
- Mrs. Rachevsky.
- What? What?

814
00:49:48,737 --> 00:49:52,257
I'm sorry.

815
00:49:52,258 --> 00:49:54,286
What?

816
00:49:55,073 --> 00:49:57,825
"No one has power over
the hour of death," you remember?

817
00:49:57,826 --> 00:49:59,842
Bullshit.
Pure bullshit.

818
00:49:59,843 --> 00:50:00,993
I saved Anna.

819
00:50:00,994 --> 00:50:02,912
I got there in time
and prevented her

820
00:50:02,913 --> 00:50:04,898
from touching
that goddamn circuit box

821
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:07,170
and she didn't die.
It was her father who died.

822
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:08,738
Not Anna...
her father, asshole.

823
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:09,954
Nathan, calm down.

824
00:50:09,955 --> 00:50:12,193
What kind of game
are you playing with us, huh?

825
00:50:12,194 --> 00:50:13,825
You bring the father
and daughter together

826
00:50:13,826 --> 00:50:15,010
and send me over there.

827
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,931
You knew I'd go there.
You knew full well.

828
00:50:16,932 --> 00:50:19,043
You send me over there
just so I'll watch her die?

829
00:50:19,044 --> 00:50:20,355
Is that it, motherfucker?

830
00:50:20,356 --> 00:50:21,795
- Listen to me...
- You think you're God,

831
00:50:21,796 --> 00:50:24,834
but you're nothing but a fucking pervert
and a shitty doctor.

832
00:50:24,835 --> 00:50:26,657
It's like that
at your hospital too, isn't it?

833
00:50:26,658 --> 00:50:28,996
You watch your patients die
one after another.

834
00:50:28,997 --> 00:50:31,779
That's how you get your kicks,
how you get your...

835
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,956
Nathan, tell me what happened.
Tell me.

836
00:50:33,957 --> 00:50:36,098
It was her father who died.

837
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,666
That's what happened.

838
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,812
Anna is fine.
Anna isn't going to die,

839
00:50:39,813 --> 00:50:41,700
and neither am I.
And there's no, like,

840
00:50:41,701 --> 00:50:45,964
light or halo or shit!

841
00:52:05,675 --> 00:52:08,368
Is he still asleep?

842
00:52:09,898 --> 00:52:12,570
Sounds like it.

843
00:52:30,285 --> 00:52:31,276
Nathan.

844
00:52:31,277 --> 00:52:33,036
Nathan!

845
00:52:33,037 --> 00:52:35,445
Claire?

846
00:52:36,204 --> 00:52:38,061
You okay?

847
00:52:38,062 --> 00:52:39,980
- Claire?
- Thank you for calling 911.

848
00:52:39,981 --> 00:52:43,220
All of our operators are busy.
