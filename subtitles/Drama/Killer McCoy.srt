{29405}{29454}Want to play cards?
{29457}{29515}Sure.
{29817}{29853}What was|your daddy like?
{29856}{29899}My daddy?
{29908}{30015}He used to drive a truck before|he got his legs cut off.
{30025}{30105}l remember one time...
{30114}{30176}he brought me and|my little brother home bicycles.
{30192}{30270}He had delivered some that day|and he had a couple left over.
{30282}{30353}But, mine was way too big for me
{30360}{30417}and my brother|he couldn't ride his anyway.
{30424}{30526}Daddy, he said l'd grow into it,|but, l never did.
{30541}{30560}Why not?
{30568}{30659}l never got the chance,|they sold it.
{30672}{30707}They sold them both.
{30710}{30805}So you have|a brother?
{30814}{30910}My brother, he had|a bone disorder.
{30918}{30969}He was|a little deformed.
{30984}{31031}What happened to him?
{31036}{31110}He died.
{31204}{31312}l can't ever remember|really liking my daddy.
{31320}{31374}l wanted to, l really did.
{31384}{31500}One time he bought me,|when l was about five,
{31514}{31617}he bought me an ice cream cone|and l dropped it.
{31632}{31713}And he slapped me and|made me pick it up and eat it.
{31722}{31809}l never liked my daddy.
{31813}{32000}One time, when my momma was|at work, and l was about 13,
{32008}{32119}he come into my room and he|told me to take my shirt off
{32125}{32199}'cause he wanted to see|how l was developed.
{32204}{32291}And when l wouldn't|he got real mad and he hit me.
{32294}{32352}And he told me he had a right
{32360}{32411}because he was my daddy|and l was his daughter
{32424}{32491}and he fed me|and let me live in his house
{32502}{32548}and he could|do whatever he wanted.
{32552}{32630}And he did.
{32640}{32753}Then he started coming|into my room a lot, after that.
{32762}{32861}l didn't fight him because|when l did he just hit me.
{32866}{32960}l was afraid|l was going to have a baby
{32969}{33017}and that my baby|would be deformed
{33021}{33104}but, l never got pregnant.
{33112}{33195}l tried to tell mama,
{33202}{33287}but she didn't|want to hear about it.
{33289}{33387}She pretended not to believe me|but l knew she did.
{33487}{33527}lt sure is good to talk...
{33537}{33575}to talk to you Henry
{33587}{33657}because l know|you're not judgmental
{33662}{33695}or anything like that.
{33784}{33825}l never would have married Leroy|in the first place
{33836}{33875}if l hadn't wanted to get away|from daddy so bad.
{33886}{33955}Didn't get along|with your daddy, huh?
{34151}{34179}Did you really kill your mama?
{34189}{34207}What?
{34215}{34295}Did you really|kill your mama?
{34300}{34362}l guess l did.
{34414}{34440}How did it happen?
{34475}{34535}l stabbed her.
{34549}{34622}Otis said you hit her|with a baseball bat.
{34625}{34674}Otis said that?
{34684}{34715}Yeah.
{34723}{34790}Well, he's mistaken.
{34799}{34923}Well, don't tell him l told you,|he made me promise.
{34936}{35026}She must have treated|you real bad.
{35152}{35200}She was a whore.
{35204}{35300}My mama was a whore.
{35308}{35392}But l don't fault her for that.
{35399}{35463}lt ain't what she done|it's how she done it.
{35477}{35636}As long as l can remember she'd|be bringing men up to the house.
{35645}{35709}My daddy was there too
{35723}{35768}but it didn't matter|nothing to her.
{35775}{35858}She make me watch it.
{35914}{35944}That's creepy.
{35950}{36015}She beat me too, a lot.
{36027}{36110}She beat me|when l wouldn't watch it.
{36119}{36163}And sometime she'd beat me
{36171}{36246}make me wear a dress
{36249}{36317}and watch her doing it.
{36325}{36396}and then they'd laugh at me.
{36402}{36443}She made you wear a dress?
{36453}{36498}You think l'm lying?
{36603}{36642}l feel like l know you
{36655}{36714}like l've known you|for a long time.
{36719}{36806}l feel like l've known you|for ever and ever.

{37517}{37656}l shot her...|l shot her dead.
{37669}{37728}l thought you said|you stabbed her?
{37871}{37899}Oh yeah.
{37961}{37988}That's right...
{38038}{38079}l stabbed her.

{71555}{71588}Guns are easy to get.
{71593}{71650}l can make a phone call|and get a gun.
{71663}{71700}Anybody can get a gun Otis.
{71711}{71731}What do you got in mind Henry?
{71744}{71773}What do you think?
{71849}{71906}l don't know.
{71917}{71938}Put up the hood.
{71953}{71982}Why?
{71991}{72034}Just put up the hood, Otis.
{73102}{73141}You guys need any help?
{73154}{73259}Otis, do you need some help|or can you do it yourself?
{73578}{73595}Feel better?
{73603}{73610}Yeah.
{73617}{73677}Alright.
{73991}{74047}lf you shoot somebody|in the head with a 45
{74056}{74080}everytime you kill somebody
{74095}{74152}it becomes like|your fingerprint see.
{74160}{74214}But if you strangle one|and stab another...
{74225}{74273}one you cut up|one you don't
{74277}{74322}then the police|don't know what to do.
{74329}{74374}They think you're|four different people.
{74381}{74430}What they really like...
{74446}{74501}what makes their job|so much easier...
{74511}{74522}a pattern.
{74536}{74594}What they call|a modus operandi.

{74666}{74713}bet you didn't know|any Latin, did ya?
{74718}{74736}Big fuckin' deal.
{74744}{74806}What?
{74887}{74934}lt's like a trail|of shit, Otis.
{74939}{75010}lt's like a blood droppings|from a deer you've shot
{75016}{75077}and all they gotta do|is follow those droppings
{75081}{75153}and pretty soon they're going|to find that deer.
{75393}{75438}Why do we use a gun?
{75497}{75535}You can use a gun.
{75549}{75594}l'm not saying you can't|use a gun...
{75601}{75658}just don't use|the same gun twice.
{75717}{75774}The most important thing|is to keep moving...
{75782}{75854}that way they might|never catch up to you.
{75858}{75942}l'm gonna have to pack up and|be on the move too, pretty soon.
{75949}{75972}Where are you going?

{88963}{89073}l'm thinking l don't want to|bring Lurleen up here after all.
{89080}{89112}You know that was my intention.
{89119}{89228}There's just too much|going on up here.
{89236}{89290}She'd get lost.
{89352}{89424}We're better off|living with mama.
{89431}{89522}l can work back home,
{89535}{89566}l won't make as much money,|l'm sure.
{89573}{89628}But we won't need|as much either.
{89636}{89692}l can live with mama.
{89695}{89787}You can stay there, too.
{89854}{89909}You figure it's safe|to go back?
{89915}{89936}l hope so.
{89950}{90067}Leroy's in jail for murder and|his bond's a million dollars.
{90081}{90136}So, unless he wins the lottery
{90145}{90208}Leroy won't be going anywhere|for quite a while.
{90223}{90280}Where's Otis?
{90286}{90370}He had a dinner date|l think he said.
{90377}{90425}Really?
{90514}{90551}Come with me?
{90565}{90608}When are you leaving?
{90617}{90659}Tomorrow.
{90673}{90717}Huh.
{90789}{90828}Better think fast Henry.
{90901}{90932}You got your ticket?
{90940}{91025}Not yet, but my mind's made up.
{91030}{91093}Might as well just do it.
{91172}{91215}Might as well.
{91220}{91289}l'd rather ride with you.
{91294}{91401}Let me think about it.

{93048}{93101}He's passed out.
{94436}{94484}l ain't interrupting|nothing, am l?
{94631}{94672}You guys want a beer?
{94683}{94767}You got any cigarettes?
