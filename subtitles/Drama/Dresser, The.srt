1
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,259
'German aircraft carried out
a number of attacks

2
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,859
'on Great Britain last night.

3
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,899
'The raids,
which lasted for several hours,

4
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,219
'were scattered over many
parts of the country.

5
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,459
'And the enemy aircraft has been...

6
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,379
'..reported over towns on
the south coast,

7
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,939
'the west of England, the North
Midlands and the north-west,

8
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,740
'as well as over the London area.'

9
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,459
He does nothing but cry.
Are they keeping him in?

10
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,699
They wouldn't let me stay.

11
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,219
The doctor said
I seemed to make matters worse.

12
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,299
I should never have taken him
to the hospital.

13
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,819
I don't know what came over me.

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,419
I should have brought him
back here where he belongs.

15
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,339
Why is his coat on the floor?
And his hat?

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,139
Drying out. They're wet through.

17
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,299
Well, how did he come to
be in such a state, Norman?

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,059
When you telephoned, I thought

19
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,219
at first that he'd been hurt
in the air raid. Oh, no.

20
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,899
Or had an accident.
Oh, no, not an accident.

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,659
No, I know because they said there
was no sign of physical injury.

22
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,059
Your Ladyship. He's in a state
of collapse. Yes, I know.

23
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,539
Well, how did he get like that?

24
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,619
Your Ladyship... What happened to
him? Sit down. Please, sit down.

25
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,979
We must remain calm.

26
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,219
The doctor said it must have been
coming on for weeks.

27
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,539
Oh, if not longer.
Well, I didn't see him this morning.

28
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,099
He left the digs before I woke.
Where was he all day?

29
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,979
Where did you find him? Well, what
happened was this, Your Ladyship.

30
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,819
After the last "all clear" sounded,
I went into Market Square

31
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,419
just as dusk was coming on.

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,899
Peculiar light, ever so yellowish.

33
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,099
I'd hoped to find a packet or two
of Brown & Polson's cornflour,

34
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,619
since our supplies are rather low.

35
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,019
So I was asking at this stall
and that's when I heard his voice.

36
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,459
Whose voice?

37
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,940
Sir's, of course.

38
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,019
He was taking off his overcoat -
in this weather!

39
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,899
"God help the man who stops me,"
he shouted, and then

40
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,260
he threw the coat to the ground just
like King Lear in the storm scene.

41
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,379
Look at it. I don't know
that I'll ever get it clean.

42
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,619
And he was so proud of it,
do you remember...?

43
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,019
Oh, no, perhaps it
was before your time.

44
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,980
The first Canadian tour, Toronto.

45
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,379
What happened after
he took off his coat?

46
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,380
Started on the hat!

47
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,179
Dunn's, Piccadilly, only a year ago,
down on the coat it went and

48
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,459
he jumped on it, he stamped on his
hat, viciously stamped on his hat.

49
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,699
Well, you can see.

50
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,979
Then he lifted his arms in the air
like he does to convey

51
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,060
sterility into Goneril's womb, "How
much further do you want me to go?"

52
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,059
His fingers were all of a fidget,
undoing his jacket,

53
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,939
loosening his collar and tie,
tearing at the buttons of his shirt.

54
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,459
Were there many people about?

55
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,299
A small crowd.
That's why I ran to him.

56
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,299
I didn't want him to stand there
looking ridiculous

57
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,659
with people all around, sniggering.

58
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,379
Did he see you?
Did he know who you were?

59
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,420
I didn't wait to find out.

60
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,899
I just took his hand and I said,

61
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,619
"Good evening, Sir, shouldn't
we be getting to the theatre?"

62
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,579
in my best nanny voice, the one
I use when he's being wayward.

63
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,619
He paid no attention.
He was shivering.

64
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,259
You shouldn't have let the public
see him like that.

65
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,899
It's easy to be wise after
the event, if you don't mind

66
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,739
my saying so, Your Ladyship,
but I tried to spirit him away,

67
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,739
not easy with a man
of his proportions.

68
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,580
Only, just then...

69
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,899
...a woman approached,

70
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,859
quite old, wearing bombazine
under a tweed coat

71
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,939
but perfectly respectable.

72
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,019
She'd picked up his clothes
and wanted to help him dress.

73
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,859
And Sir said to the lady,

74
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,739
"Thank you, my dear,
but Norman usually helps me.

75
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,739
"I'd be lost without Norman,"
and I thought,

76
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,379
"Well, this is your cue, ducky,"

77
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,059
so I said,
"I'm Norman, I'm his dresser."

78
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,899
And the woman, she had her hair in
curlers, she took his hand,

79
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,139
she kissed it, and she said,

80
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,260
"You was lovely in
The Corsican Brothers."

81
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,019
He looked at her for a long time,
then he smiled sweetly,

82
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,659
you know the way he does
when he's wanting to charm?

83
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,899
"Thank you, my dear,
but you must excuse me.

84
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,899
"I have to make an exit,"
and he ran off.

85
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,859
He said, "I have to make an exit"?

86
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,579
Well, of course, I followed him,
fearing the worst.

87
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,659
I didn't know he could run so fast.

88
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,259
I just followed this trail of
discarded clothing, the jacket,

89
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,819
the waistcoat, and I thought,

90
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,179
"We can't have Sir doing a
striptease round town."

91
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,979
But then I found him.
Leaning up against a lamppost.

92
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,580
Weeping. Where?

93
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,499
Outside the Kardomah.

94
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,299
Without a word,
hardly knowing what I was doing,

95
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,540
I led him to the hospital.

96
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,219
The sister didn't recognise him,

97
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,179
although later she said she'd
seen him last night as Othello.

98
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,899
A doctor was summoned,
short, bald, bespectacled,

99
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,339
and I was excluded
by the drawing of screens.

100
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,059
And then you telephoned me.
No, I waited.

101
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,939
I lurked, as Edgar says,
and I heard the doctor whisper,

102
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,179
"This man is exhausted.
This man is in a state of collapse."

103
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,460
And that's how it happened.

104
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,499
He did nothing but cry.

105
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,179
Yes, you said.

106
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,019
I left him lying on top of the bed,
still in his clothes, crying,

107
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,299
no, weeping, as though he'd lost
control, had no choice,

108
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,419
wept and wept, floodgates.

109
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,219
What are we to do?

110
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,179
In an hour there will be
an audience in this theatre

111
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,819
hoping to see him as King Lear.

112
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,819
What AM I to do?

113
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,019
Well, don't upset
yourself, for a start.

114
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,860
Well, I've never had to make this
sort of decision before.

115
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,339
Any sort of decision before.

116
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,779
As soon as I came out
of the hospital I telephoned Madge

117
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,819
and asked her to meet me
here as soon as possible.

118
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,259
She'll know what to do.
Oh, yes, Madge'll know what to do.

119
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,219
She won't upset herself,
that's for certain.

120
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,739
No, Madge will be ever so sensible.

121
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,780
I suppose stage managers have to be.

122
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,059
I had a friend once,

123
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,099
had been a vicar before falling from
the pulpit and landing on the stage.

124
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,780
Ever so good as an ugly sister.
To the manner born.

125
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,900
His wife didn't upset easily.

126
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,659
Just as well, I suppose,
all things considered.

127
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,899
Madge reminds me of her.
Cold, businesslike, boring.

128
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,179
The doctor took me into a little
room littered with enamel dishes

129
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,299
full of blood-stained bandages.

130
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,019
The smell made me faint.

131
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,339
He asked me
about his behaviour in recent days.

132
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,699
Had I noticed anything untoward?

133
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,540
And what did you say?
If you don't mind my asking.

134
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,980
I lied.

135
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,220
I said he'd been perfectly normal.

136
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,099
I don't want to appear neglectful.

137
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,779
I should have been more vigilant.

138
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,339
Only last night I woke...

139
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,980
Is that Madge? No, it's Irene.

140
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,059
You were saying?
Last night you woke.

141
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,939
He was looking at me. He was naked.

142
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,499
It was bitter cold,
he was shivering.

143
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,939
He said, "Thank you for watching
over me but don't worry.

144
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,699
"Just go on looking after me.

145
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,340
"I have the feeling
I may do something violent."

146
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,619
Talk about untoward.

147
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,899
I'm glad you didn't
tell the doctors that,

148
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,019
they'd have locked him up for good.

149
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,939
Last night, after Othello,
he asked me,

150
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,659
"What do we play tomorrow, Norman?"

151
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,259
I told him King Lear and he said,

152
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,539
"Then I shall wake with
the storm clouds over my head."

153
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,219
I should have made him rest.

154
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,459
The doctor said he'd come to the end
of his rope and found it frayed.

155
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,459
So would anyone that had to
put up with

156
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,699
what he's had to put up with.

157
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,859
You should've told
the doctor about the troubles.

158
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,419
No. Civilians never understand.

159
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,819
I could kick myself for taking him
to the hospital.

160
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,459
It was the right thing to do.

161
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,700
I hope so. Doctors.

162
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,499
Can you imagine trying to explain to
a doctor what Sir's been through?

163
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,819
"Well, you see, doctor,
he's been trying to recruit actors

164
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,499
"for his Shakespeare company and
all the able-bodied and best ones

165
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,539
"are in uniform, and the theatres
are bombed

166
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,339
"as soon as you book them."

167
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,579
Doctors.

168
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,059
He'd have had his hypodermic
rampant before you could say

169
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,100
As You Like It.

170
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,059
Madge is right.

171
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,139
There is no alternative.

172
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,859
We'll have to cancel.

173
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,819
Oh, no, oh, Your Ladyship, no,
cancellation's ever so drastic.

174
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,019
He's ill.

175
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,699
There's no crime in being ill,
it's not high treason,

176
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,539
it's not a capital offence, it's not
desertion in the face of the enemy.

177
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,539
He's not himself. He can't work.
Will the world stop turning?

178
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,019
Will the Nazis overrun England?

179
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,819
One Lear more or less in the world
won't make any difference.

180
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,979
Sir always believes it will.

181
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,500
Who really cares
whether he acts or not?

182
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,380
I never imagined it would
end like this.

183
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,500
I've always thought
he was indestructible.

184
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,339
All the years we've been together.

185
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,540
Feels like a lifetime.

186
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,020
Even longer, he and I.

187
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,739
It'll be the first time
we've ever cancelled.

188
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,099
Look, I want to go to the hospital.
No, Norman.

189
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,419
I want to sit with him,
be with him

190
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,019
and try to give him some comfort.

191
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,299
I can usually make him smile.
Maybe when he sees me...

192
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,860
They wouldn't even let me stay.

193
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,899
I wish I could remember the name of
the girl who got me into all this.

194
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,379
Motherly type, she was,
small parts, play as cast.

195
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,459
I can see her face clearly.

196
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,139
I can see her standing there,
on platform two at Crewe,

197
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,619
a Sunday, I was on platform four.
"Norman," she called.

198
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,539
We'd been together in Outward Bound,
the number three tour,

199
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:37,059
helped with the wardrobe I did, and
understudied Scrubby, the steward.

200
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,739
That's all aboard a ship, you know.
It's a lovely first act.

201
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,899
"We're all dead, aren't we?"

202
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,379
And I say, "Yes, sir,
we're all dead. Quite dead."

203
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,539
And he says, "How long have you
been... you been...? Oh, you know."

204
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,580
"Me? Oh, I was lost young."

205
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,899
And then he says,
"Where... where are we sailing for?"

206
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,580
And I say, "Heaven, sir.
And hell, too.

207
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,500
"It's the same place, you see."

208
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,859
Lovely. Well,

209
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,539
to cut a short story shorter,
Sir wanted help in the wardrobe

210
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,179
and someone to assist generally
but, mainly, with the storm in Lear.

211
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,580
I've told you this before,
haven't I?

212
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,299
Put me on the timpani, he did.

213
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,859
And on the first night, after
the storm, while he was waiting

214
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:33,099
to go on for, "No, they cannot touch
me for coining", he called me over.

215
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,619
My knees were jelly.

216
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,220
"Were you on the timpani tonight?"

217
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,700
I said, "Yes, sir," fearing
the worst. "Thank you," he said.

218
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,380
"You are an artist."

219
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,580
My father was exactly the same.

220
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,340
Always exaggerated his illnesses.

221
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,260
That's why I thought it was not
very serious, I thought...

222
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,579
Any further developments?

223
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,739
We had better see
the theatre manager.

224
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,659
Perhaps you ought to come with me.

225
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,779
Oh, no, Your Ladyship, please,
let's take our time,

226
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,899
let's not rush things.
There's no alternative.

227
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,899
Madge is right, we can't play
King Lear without the King.

228
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,979
We have to make a decision.

229
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,619
Forgive me, Your Ladyship, it's not
a decision you have to make,

230
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,659
it's the right decision.

231
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,939
I had a friend, in a very low state,
he was, ever so fragile,

232
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,579
a pain to be with.

233
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,539
You weren't safe from him
on top of a bus.

234
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,139
If he happened to sit beside you,

235
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,259
he'd tell you the ABC of unhappiness
between request stops.

236
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,299
Someone close to him, his mother,
I believe,

237
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,059
although it was never proved,

238
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,179
understandably upset,
made a decision.

239
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,859
"A little rest", she said,
"with others similarly off-centre,

240
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,619
"in Colwyn Bay", never a good date,
not in February,

241
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,339
wrapped in a grey rug,
gazing at a grey sea.

242
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,779
Talk about bleak.

243
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,899
Mother-dear made a decision
but it was the wrong decision.

244
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,459
And my friend never acted again.
We have to face the facts.

245
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,979
I've never done that in my life, Your Ladyship,
and I don't see why I should start now.

246
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,659
I just like things to be lovely.

247
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,539
Yes, but things aren't lovely,
Norman.

248
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,219
They aren't if you face facts.

249
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,219
Face the facts, it's facing
the company I worry about.

250
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,019
I'll be in Madge's office
if I'm wanted.

251
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,699
Don't decide yet, Your Ladyship,
let me go to the hospital,

252
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,939
let me see how he is,
you never know.

253
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,820
I do know. I realise now that I've
witnessed a slow running down.

254
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,379
I've heard the hiss of air escaping.

255
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,780
Norman! Norman!

256
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,500
Good evening, Sir.

257
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,419
Good evening, Norman.
Good evening, Pussy.

258
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,339
Bonzo, why are you here?

259
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,699
Well, my name is on the door.
Did the doctors say you could leave?

260
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,099
Doctors?

261
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,579
Executioners.

262
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,539
Do you know what he told me?

263
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,620
A short, bald butcher.
Il Duce in a white coat.

264
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,299
When a doctor tells you
you need rest, you can be certain

265
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,579
he has not the slightest
idea of what is wrong with you.

266
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,939
I discharged myself.

267
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,899
Telephone the hospital.
Do not telephone the hospital!

268
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,059
Norman, will you leave us, please?

269
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,940
I'll see Madge and tell her
there is an alternative.

270
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,820
Shh-shh!

271
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,420
You're fit for nothing.

272
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,300
Please, Pussy, don't.

273
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,579
Cancel the performance.
Can't, mustn't, won't.

274
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,379
Then take the consequences.

275
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,219
When have I not?

276
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,699
Where have you been all day?

277
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,820
Don't tell me
you found a brothel in this town.

278
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,219
I can't remember all I've done.

279
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,619
I know towards the evening
I was being pursued

280
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,499
but I couldn't see who
the villains were.

281
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,779
Then the air-raid warning went.
I refused to take shelter.

282
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,300
Wherever I went,
I seemed to hear a woman crying.

283
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,779
Then, suddenly,

284
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,899
I had a clear image of my father

285
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,220
on the beach near Lowestoft.

286
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,220
"An actor?" he said, "Never."

287
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,660
"You will be a boat builder like me."

288
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,300
But I defied him and lost his love.

289
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,459
Father preferred people to cower.

290
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,299
But I had to chart my own course.

291
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,739
I decide when I'm ready
for the scrapyard. Not you. I.

292
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,620
No-one else. I.

293
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,980
The woman you heard crying was me.

294
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,859
Norman! Sir.
I want you by me, Norman.

295
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,579
Yes, sir. Don't leave my side,
Norman.

296
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,899
No, sir. I shall need help, Norman.
Yes, sir. Madge.

297
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,099
You speak to him.
He doesn't listen to a word I say.

298
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,659
He's obviously incapable.

299
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,859
You look exhausted.
That's what I call tact.

300
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,739
Are you sure you're able to
go on tonight?

301
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,459
How long have you been with me?
Longer than anyone else.

302
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,099
Have I ever missed a performance?
No, but then you've never been ill.

303
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,659
I only want what's best for you.

304
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,539
What's best for Sir is that
he's allowed to get ready.

305
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,180
Ready, yes, I must get ready.

306
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,059
Ready for what?

307
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,299
If you'll excuse me, Your Ladyship,
shouldn't you be getting ready too?

308
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,019
I can't bear to see him like that.
Then best to leave us.

309
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,060
I've had experience of these things.

310
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,340
I know what has to be done.

311
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,740
Imagine waking to that
night after night.

312
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,940
Right, shall we begin
at the beginning? Good evening, Sir.

313
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:32,739
"Good evening, Norman."
And how are you this evening, Sir?

314
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,979
"A little tearful, I'm afraid.
And you, Norman?"

315
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,459
Oh, I'm very well, thank you.

316
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,859
I've had ever such a quiet day,
just ironing your costumes,

317
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,419
cleaning your wig and beard,
washing your undies.

318
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,459
And what have you been up to, Sir,
if I may ask?

319
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,779
"Oh, I've been jumping on my hat,
Norman."

320
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,779
Have you? Well, that's an odd thing
to do. May one ask why?

321
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,379
"Why what, Norman?"

322
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,580
Why have we been jumping
on our hat, Sir?

323
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,379
Shall we play I-Spy?

324
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,979
I spy with my little eye something
beginning with...

325
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,900
A.

326
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,699
I know you won't guess,
so I'll tell you.

327
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,500
A is for actor.

328
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,979
And actors have to work, and actors
have to put on their make-up

329
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,059
and change their frocks and then,
of course, actors have to act.

330
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,739
Good lord. Zounds, madam,
where dost thou get this knowledge?

331
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,820
From a baboon, sir,
that wandered wild in Eden.

332
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,979
Or words to that effect.

333
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,699
There's less than an hour to go
and you usually want more.

334
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,540
So, come on, shall we make a start?

335
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,340
Yes, it's me, Norman,
the one with the soulful eyes.

336
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,979
There.

337
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,540
Drink up. It's tea, not rat poison.

338
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,380
There you go, that's better,
isn't it? Isn't it?

339
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,540
Would you like a biccie?

340
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,899
I saved some from the mayor's
reception in Bridlington.

341
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,099
No?

342
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,339
Would you like one, Norman?
Ooh, I say.

343
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,940
Thank you, I will.

344
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,459
If you don't mind my saying so, Sir,
there seems little point

345
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,779
in discharging yourself
from hospital and then coming to

346
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,779
sit here like Niobe prior
to being turned into stone.

347
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,900
So, shall we make a start?

348
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,659
No, no, don't do that.
That's what I'm here for.

349
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,980
Ohh!

350
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,140
Oh, I know how it feels.

351
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,899
I had a friend,

352
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,619
worse than you, he was,

353
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,259
and all they ever wanted to do
with him was put him away.

354
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,379
And no-one should have to
go through that.

355
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,699
That's what my friend said.

356
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,579
You know they'll send you
to Colwyn Bay

357
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,420
and you never do any
business in Colwyn Bay.

358
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,059
And guess what got my friend well?
Sounds silly this.

359
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,579
An offer of work.

360
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,260
Can you understudy Scrubby?
Outward Bound, start Monday.

361
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,859
He discharged himself, just like
you, my friend did, took the train

362
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,579
up to London, found digs
in Brixton and never looked back.

363
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,619
What do you make of that?
An offer of work.

364
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,060
It meant that someone...

365
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,060
...was thinking of him.

366
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,300
It was ever such a comfort.

367
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,219
And here's something
to cheer you up.

368
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,179
A full house tonight.

369
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,019
People thinking of you,
wanting to see you act.

370
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,540
Really? A full house?
Now, shall we make a start?

371
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,819
What play is it tonight?
King Lear, Sir.

372
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,299
That's impossible.

373
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,139
Oh, thank you.
Oh, that's nice, isn't it?

374
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,979
People paying good money to see you
and you say "impossible".

375
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,619
Very nice indeed! I don't think.
I don't want to be seen.

376
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,859
Well, that's difficult

377
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,779
when you're playing King Lear
with the lighting you use.

378
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,339
I don't want to see her ladyship.

379
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,699
Oh, well, even more difficult
when she's playing your daughter.

380
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,099
You saw her a moment ago.
You were alone together.

381
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,220
Were we?

382
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,739
What play is it tonight?

383
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,780
King Lear, Sir.

384
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,219
Madge was wrong.

385
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,619
Yes, well, she often is.

386
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,499
I have been ill before this.

387
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,459
Did you ever see me in
The Corsican Brothers?

388
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,099
Ah, no. Alas, sir, before my time.

389
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,379
I went on with
double pneumonia then.

390
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,819
Apt when you're playing
the Corsican brothers.

391
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,579
I'd rather have
double pneumonia than this.

392
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,499
Than what?

393
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,139
What prevents me from packing up
and going home?

394
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,900
Why am I here
when I should be asleep?

395
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,660
Wasn't that a strange light
in Market Square this evening?

396
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,019
I don't remember
being in Market Square.

397
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,180
You've been missing whole days.
What do you remember?

398
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:44,739
Walking, walking, walking. If only
I could find a good, catchy title.

399
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,979
I think My Life a little plain,
don't you?

400
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,739
Still stuck, are we?
No, no. I wrote a little today.

401
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,379
Two or three sides
of an exercise book.

402
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,179
But I can't find a title.
Oh, well, we'll think of something.

403
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,539
See if it's still in my jacket.
And my reading glasses.

404
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,579
I thought I had written today.

405
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,739
No, well, you'll not see
much through those.

406
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,740
Well, look for me.

407
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,539
Is there anything?

408
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,939
Evidently not.
It cannot be Lear again.

409
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,940
Shall we start our make-up?

410
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,419
I'm getting out of here.

411
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,419
I'm not staying in this place
a moment longer.

412
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:26,779
I am surrounded by vipers,
betrayal on every side.

413
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,979
I am being crushed, the lifeblood
is draining out of me.

414
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,499
The load is too much.

415
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:37,419
Norman, Norman, if you have any
regard for me, don't listen to him.

416
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:41,019
Who? Who? More, more, more,
I cannot give any more.

417
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,259
I have nothing more to give.
I want a tranquil senility.

418
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,459
I'm an old man.

419
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,499
I don't want to go on painting
my face night after night

420
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,339
after night, dressing up in clothes
that are not my own,

421
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,780
I'm not a child dressing
up for charades.

422
00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:00,099
This is my work, this is
my life's work, I'm an actor.

423
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,139
Who cares if I go out there tonight

424
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,379
or any other night
and shorten my life?

425
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,740
Shorten my life...

426
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,459
I don't care if there's only
three people out front,

427
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,019
or if the audience laughs
when they shouldn't, or don't

428
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,939
when they should, one person, just
one person will know and understand.

429
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,580
And I act for him.

430
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,979
I cannot move that which
cannot be moved.

431
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,659
What are we on about now?

432
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,139
I'm filled inside with stone.

433
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,819
Stone upon stone.
I cannot lift myself.

434
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,819
The weight is too much.
Oh, I know futility when I see it.

435
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,499
I dream at night of unseen hands
driving wooden stakes into my feet.

436
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,979
And the dream is long and graceless.
I awake, sweat-drenched, poisoned.

437
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:49,019
And the whole day long there is
a burning heat inside of me,

438
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,620
driving all else from my mind.

439
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,700
What did I do today?

440
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,059
You walked. You thought you wrote.

441
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,899
You went into Market Square.

442
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,339
And a woman kissed your hand

443
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,019
and said you were lovely
in The Corsican Brothers.

444
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,780
How do you know all this?
Has someone been talking?

445
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,539
I don't wish to hurry you, Sir.

446
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,019
No, I lie, I do.

447
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,619
I hate the swines. Who?

448
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,859
He's a hard task-master,
he drives me too hard.

449
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,260
I have too much to carry.

450
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,219
Yes?

451
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,939
I'd like to see him.
I'd rather you didn't.

452
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,099
It's my responsibility to take
the curtain up tonight.

453
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,139
There isn't much time.

454
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,939
Things have reached
a delicate stage.

455
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,979
What's all the whispering?
Nothing, nothing.

456
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,979
Has he begun to make-up yet? Not
yet. Do you realise how late it is?

457
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,819
They'll be calling
the half in a moment.

458
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,419
I know how late it is.

459
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,740
Then on your head be it.

460
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,180
Oh, look! A dressing-gown!

461
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,820
Shall we put it on
and keep ourselves warm?

462
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,739
What does it matter where you were
or what you did today?

463
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,779
You're here in the theatre,
safe and sound, where you belong.

464
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,219
Another full house. Lovely.

465
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,419
Really? A full house?

466
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,300
They'll be standing in the gods.

467
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,539
Do you know they bombed
The Grand Theatre, Plymouth?

468
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,219
And much else of the city besides.

469
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,579
I made my debut
at The Grand Theatre, Plymouth.

470
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,619
They weren't to know.

471
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,139
I shouldn't have come out this
autumn but I had no choice.

472
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,899
He made me. Who?

473
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,619
I should have rested.

474
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,459
I had a friend that was
ordered to rest.

475
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,500
He obeyed
and that was the end of him.

476
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,940
He was ever so ill.

477
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,979
Nearly became a Catholic.

478
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,500
Right, now, would you like
a little rub-down?

479
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,860
I'm not surprised
you're feeling dispirited.

480
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,179
It's been ever such a hard time.

481
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,220
No young men to play juveniles and
the trouble with Mr Davenport-Scott.

482
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,540
What news of Mr Davenport-Scott?

483
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,459
The police have opposed bail. What?

484
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,899
Well, he'd had his second warning.
How then do we dispose our forces?

485
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,459
Mr Thornton is standing by
to play Fool.

486
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,779
And who as Oswald?
Mr Brown, I'm afraid.

487
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,299
That leaves me a knight short for
"reason not the need".

488
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,499
98 short, actually,
if you take the text as gospel.

489
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,139
One more or less won't seem
too upsetting.

490
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,179
Herr Hitler has made it
very difficult

491
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:48,419
for Shakespearean companies.
It'll be a chapter in the book, Sir.

492
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,299
I hate to mention it but we're going
to be short for the storm.

493
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,459
We've no-one to operate
the wind machine,

494
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,939
not if Mr Thornton is to play Fool.

495
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,979
Mr Thornton was ever
so good on the wind machine.

496
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,259
Madge knows the problem
but she's very unsympathetic.

497
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,859
You tell Madge from me I must
have the storm at full strength.

498
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,739
What about Oxenby?
Not the most amenable of gentlemen.

499
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,899
Send him to me at the half.
I'll have a word with him.

500
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,579
Better talk to Thornton, too.

501
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,740
There you are, you see?

502
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,259
That's more like it.

503
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,939
You're where you belong,
doing what you know best,

504
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,459
and you're yourself again.

505
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,379
Right, well, you start
doing your make-up and I'll go

506
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,780
and tell them to come and see you.

507
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,499
I've cleaned the wig and beard.

508
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,900
Shan't be a minute.

509
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,620
Oh, no, Sir! Not Othello!

510
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,299
The lines are fouled.
Up on your short, down on your long.

511
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,739
Is there a dead for it?

512
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,379
Instruct the puppeteer to
renew the strings.

513
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,139
The stuffing is
escaping at the seams,

514
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,859
straw from a scarecrow lies
scattered down, stage left.

515
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,499
I would have given anything to see
the play tonight.

516
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,419
There's you all blacked up
and Cordelia saying,

517
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,820
"You beget me, bred me, loved me."

518
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,099
Well, the time has come,
if you don't mind my saying so,

519
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,059
to stop waxing poetical
and to wax a bit more practical.

520
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,580
Who?

521
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,420
Irene.

522
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,020
I've come for the triple crown.
Enter.

523
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,179
Good evening, Sir.

524
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,179
All well? Yes, thank you, Sir.

525
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,060
You've come for the triple crown.

526
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,660
Yes, Sir.

527
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,139
Polish it well. I like it gleaming.

528
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,179
Yes, Sir.

529
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,139
And return it to me
well before curtain up.

530
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,299
I like to wear it by the quarter.
Yes, Sir.

531
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,139
And when I have used it on stage,

532
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,859
see that it is returned to my room
after the interval.

533
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,460
She has done it before, Sir.

534
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,660
I like to be certain.

535
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,140
There it is, my child.

536
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,500
Pretty young thing, aren't you?

537
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,700
Thank you, Sir.

538
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,140
Sir, it's time to age.

539
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,859
They're all the same colour.
Which stick do I use?

540
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,660
I can't see the colours.

541
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,020
What now? How is he?

542
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,219
He'll be all right
if he's left in peace.

543
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,899
I want to see with my own eyes.
No, no, he is not to be disturbed.

544
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,179
And what about the understudies?

545
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,179
He knows all about it,
everything's in hand.

546
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,619
You realise now there's going to be
an audience out there.

547
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,299
It'd be a bit silly going through
all this if there wasn't.

548
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,740
Will he be ready on time?
Will he be well enough? Yes.

549
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,059
Madge, can I just, erm...?

550
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,859
Who was that?
Just a minion minioning.

551
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,899
Too many interruptions,
my concentration.

552
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,899
Norman. Yes, Sir?

553
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,939
How does the play begin?

554
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,499
Which play, Sir?

555
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,939
Tonight's, tonight's,
I cannot remember the first line.

556
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,179
"Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy, Gloucester."

557
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,899
Yes, yes.

558
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,699
What performance is this?

559
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,819
Tonight will be your...

560
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,539
227th performance of the part, Sir.

561
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,659
227 Lears and I cannot remember
the first line.

562
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,539
Haven't we forgotten
something else, Sir?

563
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,500
If you don't mind my asking.
We have to sink our cheeks.

564
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,059
I shall look like this in my coffin.

565
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,020
And a broad straight line
of number 20 down the nose.

566
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,660
'Give you strength, you say.'

567
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,899
'Surgical spirit.'

568
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,899
'I know how to stick on a beard.

569
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,780
'I've been a depicter for 50 years.'

570
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,219
'I shall need a rest after
the storm scenes.'

571
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,500
'There's no need to tell me.
I know.'

572
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,020
'And shall we take extra care with
the wig join tonight?'

573
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,860
'I shall give them
a good one tonight.'

574
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,979
Norman! Yes, Sir?

575
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,259
What's the first line again? All this
clitter-clatter-chitter-chatter...

576
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,699
"Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy, Gloucester."

577
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,339
You've put it out of my mind.
Keep silent when I'm dressing.

578
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,939
I have work to do,
hard bloody labour.

579
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,979
Sir, Sir. I cannot remember
the first line. 100,000 performances

580
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,619
and I have to ask you
for the first line.

581
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,019
Yes, I'll take you through it.
Take me through it?

582
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,299
Nobody takes you through it,
you're put through it,

583
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,779
night after night after night.
I haven't the strength.

584
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,379
And you're a fine one.

585
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:26,019
I must say, you of all people,

586
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,619
you disappoint me,
if you don't mind my saying so.

587
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,699
You, who always say that self-pity
is the most unattractive

588
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,739
quality on stage or off.

589
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,219
Who have you been working for
all these years?

590
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,019
The Ministry of Information?

591
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,619
Struggle and survival, you say,
that's all that matters.

592
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,460
The whole world's struggling for
bloody survival, so why can't you?

593
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,619
My dear Norman, I seem to have
upset you. I'm sorry.

594
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,259
I understand.
We cannot always be strong.

595
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,699
There is danger in
covering the cracks.

596
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,299
Never mind about
covering the cracks,

597
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,179
what about covering the wig join?

598
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,620
Half an hour, please, Sir. Already?

599
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,099
You were in late this evening, Sir.

600
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,659
She hasn't returned with
the triple crown.

601
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,539
I like it on my head by now.

602
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,939
Look! What?

603
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,619
My hands, they're shaking.

604
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,539
Well, they'll be very
effective in the part.

605
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:25,299
Don't forget to make them up.
I can't stop them. You do it.

606
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,979
Oh, oh, look here.

607
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,900
Look here, it must be infectious.

608
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,939
I can face the division
of my kingdom.

609
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,219
I can cope with Fool.

610
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,499
I can bear the reduction
of my retinue.

611
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,140
I can stomach the curses
I have to utter.

612
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,540
I can even face being
whipped by the storm.

613
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,580
But I dread the final entrance.

614
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,219
To carry my Cordelia...

615
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,860
dead, dead.

616
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:09,220
To cry like the wind,
howl, howl, howl.

617
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,780
To lay her gently on the ground,
to die.

618
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,500
Have I the strength?

619
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,380
If you haven't the strength,
no-one has.

620
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,980
You're a good friend, Norman.

621
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,339
Thank you, Sir.

622
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,379
You shall be rewarded.
Pardon me while I get my violin.

623
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,540
Do not mock me. I may not have long.

624
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,099
My father used to say that.
He lived till he was 93.

625
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,380
He may still be alive,
for all I know.

626
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,579
Bonzo, how do you feel?

627
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,219
A little more myself, Pussy.

628
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,940
You see? Once he's assumed
the disguise, he's a different man.

629
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,820
"Egad, Madam,
thou hast a porcupine wit."

630
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,059
And are you sure you're
able to go on?

631
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,940
On and on and on.

632
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,139
Pussy, I thought
it was the black one tonight.

633
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,219
My dear.
Did I wake in the night, Pussy?

634
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,699
Did I thank you
for watching over me?

635
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,219
Was there talk of violence?

636
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,819
No, Bonzo, you dreamt it.

637
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,220
I still have the feeling.

638
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,619
Would you like me to fetch the
cloak and tie it on as usual?

639
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,539
Yes, as usual.

640
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,459
Oh, erm, Mr Thornton and Mr Oxenby

641
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,099
are waiting outside to see you.

642
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,739
Would you like me
to ask them to come in?

643
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,539
I don't want to see Oxenby.
He frightens me.

644
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,619
Mind you, he was the best
Iago I've ever had or seen

645
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,739
and I include that 4'6"
ponce Sir Arthur Palgrove.

646
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,659
That's more like the Sir
we know and love.

647
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,019
He went on playing Hamlet
till he was 68.

648
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,739
There were more lines on his face
than steps to the gallery.

649
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,819
I saw his Lear. I was pleasantly
disappointed. Sir Arthur Palgrove.

650
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,419
Who advises His Majesty,
answer me that?

651
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,059
You're a miracle-worker, Norman.
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

652
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,659
Here's a piece of chocolate
for you.

653
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,739
Oh, thank you, Your Ladyship.

654
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,299
It'll be all hands to the pump
tonight, Norman.

655
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,420
A small part of the service,
Your Ladyship. Thank you.

656
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,740
Don't suppose I didn't see that
because I did.

657
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,419
There are more children in this
beloved land of ours scavenging

658
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,059
the larders for something sweet,

659
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,939
if only they came to me
I could tell them of

660
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:43,459
the one person in England who has an
inexhaustible supply of chocolate.

661
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,219
Because it is I who have to carry
her dead as my Cordelia.

662
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,099
It is I who have to lift her
up in my arms.

663
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,539
Thank Christ, I thought,
for rationing

664
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,499
but, no, she would find sugar
in a sand dune.

665
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,219
Shall I show the actors in, Sir?

666
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,780
What? No, I don't want...
Sir, you have to see the actors.

667
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,460
Ah, Mr Thorton. Mr Thornton
to see you, Sir.

668
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,220
Geoffrey, does the costume fit?

669
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,299
Mr Davenport-Scott was
such a tall man.

670
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,100
Mr Davenport-Scott was a worm.
You look, er...

671
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,899
Do you know the lines? Yes.

672
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,499
Don't keep me waiting for them.

673
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,939
Oh, no.
Pace, pace, pace, pace, pace, pace.

674
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,379
Yes. And keep out of my focus. Yes.

675
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,819
The boom lights placed
in the downstage wings

676
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,259
are for me and me only.
Yes, old man, I know.

677
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,859
You must find what light you can.
Right.

678
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,339
Let me hear you sing. What?

679
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,820
"For he that has the little
tiny wit. Heigh-ho..."

680
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,060
He... he...

681
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,659
All right, speak it, don't sing it.

682
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,459
And in the storm scene, if you
are going to put your arms around

683
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:25,659
my legs, as Mr Davenport-Scott did,
then around my calves, not my thighs.

684
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,059
He almost ruptured me twice.

685
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,859
I'd rather I didn't, old man.

686
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,099
Feel it, my boy, feel it,
it is the only way.

687
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,299
Whatever takes you. Right.

688
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,379
But do not let it take you too much.
Remain within the bounds.

689
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,539
And, at all costs, remain still
when I speak. Of course.

690
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,419
Serve the playwright...

691
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,660
and keep your teeth in.

692
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,099
It's only when I'm nervous.

693
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,939
You will be nervous, I guarantee it.

694
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,059
There will be no extra
payment for this performance.

695
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,420
I believe your contract is
play as cast. Yes.

696
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,260
Good fortune attend your endeavours.
Thank you, Sir.

697
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,059
God bless, Geoffrey.

698
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,460
I'd rather face
the Nazi hordes any day.

699
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,299
I hope Mr Churchill has better
men in the cabinet.

700
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,939
Mr Oxenby is waiting, Sir. Oxenby?

701
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,619
What... what...? I don't know.
What does Oxenby want?

702
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,779
It's not what he wants,

703
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,259
it's what we want - someone to
operate the wind machine.

704
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,259
I don't want to see Oxenby,
I can't bear the man,

705
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,459
it's stifling in here.

706
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,380
We'll have no storm without him.

707
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,180
Mr Oxenby to see you, Sir.

708
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,299
You wanted to see me?

709
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,979
I...I don't know, erm, why?
Er, Norman?

710
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,740
Sir was wondering
if he could ask of you a favour.

711
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,700
He can ask.

712
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,099
You've not been with us very long

713
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,659
but I'm sure you've seen
enough to know that we're not

714
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:01,619
so much a company as one great
big happy family.

715
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,259
And...

716
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,260
we all muck in as required.

717
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,539
As I'm sure you've heard,

718
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,419
Mr Davenport-Scott will not be
rejoining the company.

719
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,259
Yes, I've heard.

720
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,499
You share a dressing-room
with one or two of them,

721
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,299
you hear nothing else.

722
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,419
It upsets the pansy fraternity

723
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,580
when one of their number is caught.

724
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,259
Because Mr Thornton is having
to play Fool,

725
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:36,539
and because our two elderly knights
are setting the hovel behind

726
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,019
the cloth during the storm scene,

727
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,380
we've no-one to operate
the wind machine.

728
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,940
We'd ask Mr Brown
but he's really rather too fragile.

729
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,340
We were wondering
if you'd turn the handle.

730
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,540
In short, no.

731
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,140
Anything else?

732
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,020
Has he read my play yet?

733
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,339
Perhaps the Russians have had
a setback on the Eastern Front.

734
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,979
Bolshevism will be
the ruin of the theatre.

735
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,019
What are we going to do?
Fancy not wanting to muck in.

736
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,019
He hates me. I can feel his hatred.

737
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,419
All I stand for he despises.

738
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,939
I wouldn't read his play, even if
he were Commissar of Culture.

739
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,379
I've read it.
Is there a part for me? Yes.

740
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,059
I know what Oxenby's up to.

741
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,099
He's writing plays for critics,
not people.

742
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,779
Oughtn't we to be quiet
for a bit, Sir?

743
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,699
Where's the girl with
the triple crown?

744
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,860
Don't fuss. I'll go and find her.

745
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,819
Oh, my dear.

746
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,939
Norman's just gone to find you.

747
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,339
Has he? I must have missed him.

748
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,739
Remind me of your name, child.

749
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,619
It's Irene, Sir.

750
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,220
Irene. Charming.

751
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,299
Were you at the Rada?

752
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,779
No, sir. I went straight into Rep.

753
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,339
Of course. I remember. Which Rep?

754
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,580
Maidenhead. Maidenhead, yes.

755
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,099
Next week in Eastbourne.

756
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,779
I can't find her.

757
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:39,020
Just admiring her bone structure.
Run along, Irene. Run along.

758
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,699
A born actress.
Can tell by the cheek bones.

759
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,979
Put the crown on.
It's almost the quarter.

760
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,899
Shall I fetch her ladyship
and ask her to tie on the cloak?

761
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,299
How does the play begin?
God help me, that child has

762
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,899
driven it from my mind.

763
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,339
Quarter of an hour, please,
a few minutes late, I'm sorry,

764
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,379
that girl Irene is going to be
the death of me.

765
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,419
The quarter, I can't, I'm not ready,
tell them to go home,

766
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,579
give them their money back.
I hate the swines, I can't, I can't.

767
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,059
What are you saying? Do you want
the performance cancelled?

768
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,379
No, he doesn't. How does it begin?

769
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,379
For your own good.
How does it begin?

770
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,899
You'll never get through it.
He will. How does it begin?!

771
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,659
Get out, he'll be good and ready
when the curtain goes up.

772
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,340
We've run out of time.

773
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:26,379
There's 20 minutes yet.
We'll go up late, if necessary.

774
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,419
Leave me in peace!
I cannot remember the lines.

775
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,099
Norman, Norman, how does it begin?

776
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,779
"He hath been out nine years
and away he shall again."

777
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,940
"The King is coming."

778
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:44,420
"Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy, Gloucester."

779
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,899
"Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy, Gloucester."

780
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,140
"I shall, my liege."

781
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:56,219
Yes? "Meantime we shall
express our darker..."

782
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,260
"Meantime we shall
express our darker purpose."

783
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,179
"Give me the map."

784
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,579
Don't tell me, don't tell me,
I know it!

785
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,339
I'll ask for it if I need it.

786
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,220
I have played this
part before, you know.

787
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,339
"What do I fear?"

788
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,259
Wrong.
"Know we have divided in three."

789
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,419
"Myself? There's none else by.

790
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,299
"True, I talk of dreams, which are
the children of a troubled brain."

791
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,939
Wrong play, wrong play.

792
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,139
"Can this cockpit hold the vasty
fields of France?"

793
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,259
No, that's another wrong play.

794
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,859
"Men should be what they seem.
Macbeth shall sleep no more!

795
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,339
Now look what you've gone and done.
What?

796
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,299
Go out, go out.

797
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,339
You've quoted the Scottish play.

798
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,979
Did I? Macb...? Did I?

799
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,740
Oh, Christ. Out!

800
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,859
Turn round three times.

801
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,579
Two, three...

802
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,420
Right, knock.

803
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,819
Swear.

804
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,340
Pisspots.

805
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:14,060
"And my poor fool is hang'd."

806
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,300
You'll be all right.

807
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,980
Do we have a full house?

808
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,540
Struggle, Bonzo.

809
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,019
Survival, Pussy.

810
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,859
Beginners, please, Act I.

811
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,940
Beginners, please, Sir. Thank you.

812
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:50,100
Let us descend
and survey the scene of battle.

813
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,539
The night I played my first
Lear there was a thunderstorm.

814
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,099
A real thunderstorm.
But now they send bombs.

815
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,179
How much more have I to endure?

816
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,019
We are to speak Shakespeare tonight

817
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:09,099
and they will go to any
lengths to prevent me.

818
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,700
I shouldn't take it
too personally, Sir.

819
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,979
Bomb, bomb, bomb us
into submission if you dare!

820
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,459
But each word I speak will be
a shield against your savagery,

821
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,139
each line I utter
a protection against your terror.

822
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,099
I don't think they can
hear you, Sir.

823
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,380
Swines! Barbarians!

824
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,140
Oh, no. Oh, Sir.

825
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,539
Just as we were winning.

826
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:43,139
Perhaps it's timely. He can't go on.
Look at him. Fetch Madge.

827
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,779
Norman! Sir.

828
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,059
Get me down to the stage. Yes.

829
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:51,860
By Christ, no squadron of
Fascist Bolsheviks will stop me now.

830
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,860
Do as I say!

831
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,659
How is he?
Who'll make the announcement?

832
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,259
Mr Davenport-Scott, of course.

833
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,139
No! Oh, dear! You, then, Norman.

834
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,579
Me, Sir? Do not argue,
I've given my orders,

835
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,979
I have enough to contend with.

836
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,780
Sir, I'm not equipped. Do it!

837
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,220
Come on.

838
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,940
Take the apron off,
for goodness' sake.

839
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,259
Ladies and gentlemen...

840
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:55,659
Ladies and gentlemen,
the warning has just gone.

841
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,779
An air-raid is in progress.

842
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:01,340
We shall proceed
with the performance.

843
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,260
Will those...
Will those who wish to live...

844
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:14,579
Will anyone who wishes to leave
do so as quietly as possible?

845
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,420
Thank you.

846
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,180
Stand by.

847
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,020
Stand by on tabs.

848
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,299
Stand by on stage.

849
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,940
Go IX. Go flies.
Curtain going up.

850
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:43,259
I thought the King had more affected
the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.

851
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,259
It did always seem so to us.

852
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,459
Geoffrey, was I all right?

853
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,940
Yes, yes, old man, damn good.

854
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:54,019
Your Ladyship, was I all right?

855
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,619
Better than Mr Davenport-Scott.

856
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,539
Really? Do you mean that?

857
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,539
I was ever so nervous.

858
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,139
Do you think anyone
noticed the slip?

859
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,139
"Will those who wish to live..."

860
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,220
Ooh, I could have kicked myself.

861
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,100
I was really all right?
You were fine.

862
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,820
Did he say anything? No.

863
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,460
Cueing grams.

864
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,220
My services to Your Lordship.

865
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,979
Stand by, please.
All right, Sir.

866
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,180
Cueing timpani, Sir.

867
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,140
The King is coming.

868
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,899
Sir? What?

869
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,539
Her Ladyship's entered.

870
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:58,339
Oh, quite a nice round,
so it's your turn now.

871
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,339
You see? What did I say?

872
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,660
Please, Sir, the entrance.
You're on.

873
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,299
Please, Sir, it's your entrance.

874
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,740
Methought I saw him.

875
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,819
His procession formed,

876
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:14,619
100 knights his escort...

877
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,099
Mr Oxenby's having to extemporize.

878
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,739
"Attend the lords of
France and Burgundy".

879
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:24,419
The King, my father, was,
methought, behind me.

880
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:28,659
From our camp we marched,
a goodly distance,

881
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:31,339
I ahead, as is our custom.

882
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:34,019
Sir, the natives are
getting restless.

883
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,780
Sound the fanfare again.

884
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:41,060
Ah! Methinks I see the King.

885
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,300
No, I was mistook.

886
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:55,099
My Lord, with thy consent,
I shall to his majestic side,

887
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,340
there to discover
his royal progress.

888
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,619
Is he coming or isn't he? Yes!

889
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,700
I'm cueing the King's fanfare again.

890
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,499
"Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy, Gloucester."

891
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,979
Cue the knights, cue the knights.

892
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,179
Oh! Go on, go on.

893
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,940
Enter, for God's sake.

894
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,019
Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy, Gloucester.

895
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:31,459
I shall, my liege.

896
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,899
Meantime we shall express our darker
purpose. Give me the map there.

897
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,539
Know that we have divided in three
our kingdom, and 'tis our fast

898
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,979
intent to shake all cares and
business from our age, conferring

899
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:47,019
them on younger selves, while we,
unburdened

900
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,660
crawl toward death.

901
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:54,099
Thou art a lady,
if only to go warm were gorgeous.

902
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:57,859
Why, nature needs not
what thou gorgeous wear'st,

903
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,660
which scarcely keeps thee warm.

904
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:04,259
But for true need,

905
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,579
you heavens, give
me that patience,

906
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,340
patience I need.

907
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:17,139
You see me here, you gods,
a poor old man,

908
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:19,940
as full of grief as age,
wretched in both.

909
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:24,259
If it be you that stirs
these daughters' hearts

910
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:30,739
against their father, fool me
not so much to bear it tamely.

911
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,540
Touch me with noble anger.

912
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:40,099
And let not women's weapons,
water-drops, stain my man's cheeks!

913
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:45,579
No, you unnatural hags, I will have
such revenges on you both.

914
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:49,059
That all the world shall -
I will do such things -

915
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:56,500
what they are yet I know not but they
shall be the terrors of the earth.

916
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,139
You think I'll weep.

917
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:06,139
No, I'll not weep.

918
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:09,979
I have full cause of weeping
but this heart shall

919
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:15,420
break into 100,000 flaws
or ere I'll weep.

920
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:20,500
O, fool! I shall go mad.

921
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,739
Let us withdraw, 'twill be a storm.

922
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,179
I know you. Where's the king?

923
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,979
Stay out of my focus, Geoffrey.

924
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,659
Contending with
the fretful elements.

925
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:32,539
Bids the wind blow the earth into
the sea or swell the curled waters

926
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,739
'bove the main,
That things might change or cease.

927
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:38,299
Geoffrey, wait. Don't get in
the light. Don't hold up, no pauses.

928
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,220
Just keep the pace going.
Pace, pace, pace, pace, pace.

929
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:46,259
Sir, I do know you, open this purse,
and take what it contains.

930
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,219
A fie on this storm! Stand by.

931
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,219
I shall go seek the King.

932
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:55,379
Stand by LX. Now!

933
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,699
Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks.

934
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:02,499
Rage, blow, you cataracts
and hurricanoes, strike.

935
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,739
Thou sulphurous
and thought executing fires...

936
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,739
Louder! He wants it louder!

937
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:11,779
Singe my white head
and thou, all shaking thunder,

938
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,739
strike flat the thick
rotundity o' th' world.

939
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:17,019
Crack nature's moulds, all germens...

940
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:20,219
Come on, louder!
He wants it louder, come on!

941
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,419
That's not loud enough, louder!

942
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,459
Come on, come on!

943
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:27,699
Nor rain, wind, thunder,
fire are my daughters.

944
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:32,260
So old and white as this.
O, ho, 'tis foul!

945
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,819
Where was the storm?
Where was the storm?

946
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:40,779
I ask for cataracts and hurricanoes
and I am given

947
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,739
nothing but trickles and whistles.

948
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:46,020
I demand oak-cleaving thunderbolts
and you answer with farting flies.

949
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:00,099
Norman, Norman, you have thwarted me.

950
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:05,139
I was there, within sight,
I had only to be spurred upwards

951
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:09,419
and the glory was mine for
the plucking and there was naught,

952
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:12,259
zero, silence, a breeze,
oh, a breeze!

953
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,699
A shower,
a collision of cotton-wool,

954
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:19,659
a flapping of butterfly wings.
I want a tempest not a drizzle.

955
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,779
Something will have to be done.

956
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,580
I demand to know what happened
tonight to the storm!

957
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:29,460
I'm pleased you're pleased.

958
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:34,379
I've never known you not complain
when you've really been at it

959
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:39,579
and, tonight, one could safely say,
without fear of contradiction,

960
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,100
you were at it.

961
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,940
Go on, rest now.

962
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:50,019
You've the interval and all
of Gloucester's blinding before,

963
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,220
"No, they cannot touch me
for coining."

964
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,339
Try to sleep.

965
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:03,779
You've been through it.

966
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,459
Or been put through it,

967
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,139
whichever you prefer.

968
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:13,780
And you need quiet, as the deaf-mute
said to the piano tuner.

969
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:24,539
Mighty, Her Ladyship thought you
were tonight, she did,

970
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,580
that was the word she used.

971
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:31,860
"Mighty."

972
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:42,499
Of course, I cannot comment
on the storm scene but I did hear,

973
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,059
"O Reason not the need".

974
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,699
Tremble-making.

975
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:50,419
Never seen you
so full of the real thing,

976
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:53,619
if you don't mind my saying so, Sir.

977
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:54,739
And here's a funny thing.

978
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:57,819
In the storm scene, while we were
beating ourselves delirious

979
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:00,259
and I was having to jump
between thunder sheet

980
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,579
and timpani,

981
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:07,059
like a juggler with
rubber balls and Indian clubs,

982
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:11,259
Mr Oxenby came to our aid,
uninvited.

983
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,979
Not a word said,
just gave assistance

984
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,019
when assistance was needed.

985
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,619
Afterwards, just before
the interval, I thanked him.

986
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,819
"Get stuffed,"
he said, which wasn't nice.

987
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:25,299
And then he added, scornfully,
"I don't know why I helped."

988
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,739
And I said, "Because we
are a band of brothers,

989
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:30,140
"and you're one of us
in spite of yourself."

990
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,419
I did, that's what I said.

991
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:38,659
He hobbled away, his head down

992
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,699
and if he was given to muttering,

993
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,579
he'd have muttered.

994
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:44,979
Darkly.

995
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,060
Are you asleep, Sir?

996
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,259
To be driven thus.

997
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,019
I hate the swines.

998
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:56,739
Who? Who is it that you hate?

999
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,099
The critics?

1000
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,459
The critics? Hate the critics?

1001
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,499
I have nothing
but compassion for them.

1002
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:06,299
How can one hate the crippled,
the mentally deficient and the dead?

1003
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:09,979
Bastards. Who then? Who then what?

1004
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,699
Who then is it that you hate?

1005
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:15,099
Let me rest, Norman, you must
stop questioning me, let me rest.

1006
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:18,499
But don't leave me till I'm asleep.
Don't leave me alone.

1007
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,140
I am a spent force.
My days are numbered.

1008
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,499
Is he asleep? I think so, yes.

1009
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,700
I'll sit with him.

1010
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:49,980
Well, don't wake him,
Your Ladyship. He's ever so tired.

1011
00:59:58,340 --> 00:59:59,939
Is it my cue?

1012
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,500
No, it's still the interval.

1013
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,420
I have things to say.

1014
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:09,939
Norman tells me you thought
I was mighty tonight.

1015
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,899
I never said anything of the kind.
He makes these things up.

1016
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,979
What have you to say?

1017
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,379
What I always have to say.

1018
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,940
You know my answer.

1019
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,859
You've worked hard.

1020
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,499
You've saved.

1021
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,539
Enough's enough.

1022
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,979
Tonight, in your curtain speech,

1023
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:30,419
make the announcement.

1024
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,739
I can't.

1025
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,979
You won't. I have no choice.

1026
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,419
You'll die.

1027
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,339
Or end up a vegetable!

1028
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:39,459
Well, that's your affair.

1029
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,979
But you're not going to
drag me with you.

1030
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:44,139
I am helpless, Pussy.
I do what I'm told.

1031
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,379
I cower, I'm frightened
of being whipped, I am driven.

1032
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:49,339
Driven? No. Cruel? Yes,

1033
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,819
Obstinate? Yes. Ruthless? Yes.

1034
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,979
Don't! For an actor, you have
a woeful lack of insight.

1035
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,819
Use your great imagination,

1036
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,019
use your inspired gifts,

1037
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,019
try to imagine what I feel,

1038
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,699
what I'm forced to go through.

1039
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,699
I do! But I need you beside me,

1040
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,259
familiar, real!

1041
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,219
I am beside you, darning tights.
Very familiar, quite real.

1042
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:13,259
All I ask, Bonzo, is that we stop.

1043
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,739
Now, tonight, the end of the week -
but no more.

1044
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,299
I can't take any more.

1045
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,939
It's not possible. It is possible.

1046
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,259
No. You deceive no-one but yourself.

1047
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,939
If that were true, why then am I here, with
bombs falling, risking life and limb? Why?

1048
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:29,059
Not by choice. I have a duty.
I have to keep the faith.

1049
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,539
Oh, balls!

1050
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:31,939
What?

1051
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,579
You do nothing
without self-interest.

1052
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,619
And you drag everyone with you.

1053
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,899
Me - chained, not even by law.

1054
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,699
Oh, would marriage have made
that much difference to you?

1055
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,939
You misunderstand, deliberately.

1056
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,899
I should have made her
divorce me, yeah!

1057
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,499
You didn't get a divorce
because you wanted a knighthood.

1058
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,699
That's not true. True?
You know where your priorities lie.

1059
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:55,259
Whatever you do is to your advantage
and to no-one else's.

1060
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:57,179
Talk about being driven.

1061
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,619
You make yourself sound like
a disinterested stagehand.

1062
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,059
You do nothing without
self-interest.

1063
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,739
You. Self. Alone.

1064
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:08,379
Pussy, please, I'm sinking.
Do not push me further into the mud.

1065
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:11,019
Sir. Her Ladyship. Fantasies.

1066
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:13,939
For God's sake,
you're a third-rate actor-manager

1067
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,539
on a tatty tour of the provinces,

1068
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,859
not some Colossus
bestriding the narrow world.

1069
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:20,659
Sir, Her Ladyship!
Look at me - darning tights.

1070
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:22,259
Look at you.

1071
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,579
Lear's hovel is luxury
compared to this.

1072
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:27,259
I'm not well, I have half
of Lear's life ahead of me,

1073
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,059
I have to carry you in my arms,

1074
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:32,499
I have "Howl, howl, howl!"
yet to speak!

1075
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,139
"Sir", "Her Ladyship" -
We're a laughing-stock!

1076
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:37,379
You'd never get a knighthood

1077
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,660
because the King doesn't possess
a double-edged sword.

1078
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:51,179
Do you remember, years ago,
an actress, one of our Gonerils?

1079
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:55,580
She was a tall, dark, handsome girl
with a Grecian nose.

1080
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:59,339
Flora Bacon.

1081
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,220
Was it? Yes, perhaps it was.

1082
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:03,740
Flora.

1083
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:08,859
Do you remember the night
I was rather hard on Norman

1084
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,459
because he'd got my tights inside out

1085
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,339
during the quick change
in The Wandering Jew?

1086
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,500
Or was it The Sign Of The Cross?

1087
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:17,780
Whichever.

1088
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:20,180
She turned on me.

1089
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,099
"He may be your servant," she said,
"but he is a human being."

1090
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,499
Then, to Norman, she said,
"Why don't you leave him?

1091
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:30,299
"Why do you put up with it?" And Norman said,
"Don't fuss. He only gives as good as he gets.

1092
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:32,259
"He has to take it out
on someone," he said.

1093
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:34,900
And he was right. Because
Flora Bacon didn't understand.

1094
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,620
Slave driver she called me.

1095
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,579
Why ever did I employ her?

1096
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:46,060
Her mother was Lady Bacon.
She invested £200 in the company.

1097
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:55,739
I thought tonight I caught sight
of him, or saw myself as he sees me.

1098
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,940
Speaking, "Reason not the need."

1099
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:01,659
"Go on, you bastard,"
I seemed to be saying or hearing.

1100
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:05,499
"Go on, you've more to give.
Don't hold back. More, more, more!"

1101
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,299
And I was watching Lear.

1102
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:08,979
Yes!

1103
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:11,220
Each word he spoke
was fresh invented.

1104
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:15,259
I had no knowledge of what came next,
what fate awaited him.

1105
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:18,180
The agony was in
the moment of acting created.

1106
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:21,260
Ha!

1107
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,380
And I saw an old man.

1108
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:30,700
And the old man...

1109
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:33,740
...was me.

1110
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,780
Don't leave me.

1111
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:41,860
I'll rest easy if you stay.

1112
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:45,900
But don't ask of me the impossible.

1113
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:50,420
Otherwise...

1114
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:59,659
...without you, in darkness,

1115
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:01,339
I will see a locked door,

1116
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,619
a sign, "Closed", in the window,

1117
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:05,220
"Closed - gone away".

1118
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:10,500
And a drawn blind.

1119
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,380
I'll stay till Norman returns.

1120
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:18,859
I meant longer.

1121
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:20,300
Please.

1122
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,340
Oh, please, Pussy.

1123
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:30,819
Reassure me.

1124
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:33,019
I'm sick.

1125
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,260
Sick.

1126
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:38,140
Yes, so am I.

1127
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,339
Sick.

1128
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:45,419
I'm sick of cold railway trains,

1129
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,499
cold waiting rooms,

1130
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,499
cold Sundays on Crewe,

1131
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,540
and eating cold food late at night.

1132
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,019
I'm sick of packing and unpacking

1133
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,619
and of darning tights.

1134
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:00,259
I'm sick of the smell of
rotting costumes and naphthalene.

1135
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:01,899
And most of all,

1136
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,179
I'm sick of reading week after week

1137
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:08,379
that I'm barely adequate, too old,

1138
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:10,220
the best of a bad supporting cast.

1139
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:14,980
Unequal to you,
unworthy of your gifts.

1140
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:20,060
And I'm sick of having to
put on a brave face.

1141
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:34,820
I should have left you in Baltimore
on the last American tour.

1142
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:38,459
I should have accepted
Mr Feldman's offer

1143
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,860
and taken the 20th Century west.

1144
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:45,139
Feldman thought
I wouldn't photograph well.

1145
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:46,779
Swine.

1146
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:48,299
I hate the cinema.

1147
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:49,900
I believe in living things.

1148
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:53,339
How quickly one's looks go.

1149
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:56,459
They haven't built a camera
large enough to record me.

1150
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:58,939
I wouldn't have minded
a modest success.

1151
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:01,659
Why they knighted that dwarf
Arthur Palgrove I shall never know.

1152
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:05,099
"Arise, Sir Arthur," said the King.
"But, Sir, I wasn't kneeling."

1153
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:08,580
Not once in his whole career
did he put a toe outside London.

1154
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:11,579
I liked America.

1155
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:13,019
I hated the swines.

1156
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,420
'Act Two beginners, please!'

1157
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,899
I must rest now, Pussy.
I want peace.

1158
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,779
All you want is
to have your cake and to eat it.

1159
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:26,219
I've never seen any point in having
cake unless one is going to eat it.

1160
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,179
Ha-ha! Ha-ha ha-ha!

1161
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:29,499
Everything jolly?

1162
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,419
Don't you know what knocking is?

1163
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,779
Oh, please, Sir -
not in front of Her Ladyship.

1164
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,939
Well, I've been mingling.

1165
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:38,219
You should hear
what they think out there -

1166
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,379
I have never known
an interval like it.

1167
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,659
Michelangelo, William Blake -

1168
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:45,139
God knows who else
you reminded them of.

1169
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:46,740
One poor boy...

1170
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,299
...an airman, head bandaged,

1171
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,819
was weeping in the stalls bar,

1172
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,579
comforted by an older man -

1173
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:58,419
once blonde, now grey,
parchment skin and dainty hands -

1174
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:02,779
who went on saying, "There, there,
Evelyn, it's only a play."

1175
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:04,779
Which didn't seem to me
any comfort at all

1176
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,739
because, if it hadn't been a play,

1177
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,860
then "There-there-Evelyn"
wouldn't be so upset.

1178
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:12,339
Michelangelo, did they?

1179
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:13,499
And Blake.

1180
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,939
I'm going to my room.

1181
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,419
Please stay.

1182
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:19,179
You must rest, Bonzo -
mustn't he Norman?

1183
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,539
Yes, he must.

1184
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:21,660
Pussy...

1185
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,379
Be gentle with Her Ladyship.

1186
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,819
I'm always gentle with Her Ladyship.

1187
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,060
Especially gentle.

1188
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,140
Why?

1189
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:41,540
Time of life.

1190
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:45,059
Ohh!

1191
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:48,259
You mean flushes
and dizzy spells?

1192
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:51,659
She's become very
preoccupied with herself.

1193
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,379
Sounds like a bad attack of change.

1194
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,900
Be gentle. I don't want her hurt.

1195
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,460
Ai-ai!

1196
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,140
Sleep now.

1197
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:09,739
Is there anything else you want?

1198
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:11,299
Oblivion.

1199
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,339
That'll come sooner or later.

1200
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:14,460
And I hope later.

1201
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:17,779
I shall wake you in plenty of time

1202
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:20,780
so you can enter fantastically
dressed in wild flowers.

1203
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,660
Sleep tight,
don't let the bugs bite.

1204
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:51,300
Fetch Madge!

1205
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,980
Yes?

1206
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:16,380
It's going well, I think.

1207
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:19,420
Except for your first entrance.

1208
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:35,460
Come here.

1209
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,780
Hold my hand.

1210
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:42,500
Please.

1211
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:49,499
It's like ice.

1212
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,579
Cold with fear.

1213
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,380
What are you frightened of?

1214
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:56,220
Of what is to come.

1215
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,539
You know who you're
talking to, do you?

1216
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,099
It's me, not someone to impress.

1217
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,339
I'm speaking from my heart.

1218
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:06,619
I have never before felt so lonely.

1219
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:09,220
Please, I have a show to run...
Listen to me.

1220
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,700
I am frightened of what is to come.

1221
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:18,339
And I meant it, because,
for the first time in my life,

1222
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,339
the future is hidden from me.

1223
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:22,019
I see no friends.

1224
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:24,060
I am not warmed by fellowship.

1225
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,579
I know only...

1226
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,180
awful solitude.

1227
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:32,539
An occupational hazard.

1228
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:35,060
You wanted to see me, about what?

1229
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:39,379
I look on you as my one true friend.

1230
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:41,539
I have to go back to the corner.

1231
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:42,820
Have you been happy?

1232
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:46,620
Has it been worth it?

1233
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,420
No, I've not been happy.

1234
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,739
Yes, it's been worth it.

1235
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:56,340
Madge, dear...

1236
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:02,060
In my will, I've left you
all my press-cutting books.

1237
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:06,339
I don't want to hear what
you've left me in your will.

1238
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:10,140
Cuttings and notices that span
a lifetime, an entire career.

1239
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,419
I've kept them religiously.

1240
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:15,380
Good and bad notices alike.

1241
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,980
Not all that many bad.

1242
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,380
Talk of me sometimes.
Speak well of me.

1243
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,859
Actors live on only
in the memory of others.

1244
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:29,900
Speak well of me.

1245
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,540
This is a ridiculous conversation.

1246
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:37,019
You're in the middle
of a performance of Lear,

1247
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,459
playing rather less mechanically
than you have of late,

1248
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:42,459
and you talk as if you're organising
your own memorial service.

1249
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:45,300
The most wonderful thing in life
is to be remembered.

1250
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:48,100
Speak well of me.

1251
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:51,259
You'll be believed.

1252
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:52,819
You'll be remembered.

1253
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:54,939
Madge, dear...

1254
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:56,940
I have something for you.

1255
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:00,180
I want you to have this ring.

1256
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:05,020
If possessions can be dear,
this ring is the dearest thing I own.

1257
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,499
Edmund Kean wore this ring

1258
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:15,339
in a play whose title is an apt
inscription for what I feel -

1259
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:18,819
A New Way To Pay Old Debts.

1260
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:21,539
When you talk of it,

1261
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:23,900
say Edmund Kean and I wore it.

1262
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:29,819
I once had it in mind
to give it to you...

1263
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:31,220
years ago.

1264
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:35,739
But you were younger then,

1265
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:37,900
and I thought
you would misunderstand.

1266
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:41,580
Yes.

1267
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:47,140
A ring from a man to a woman
is easily misunderstood.

1268
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:53,019
I know I'm thought insensitive,

1269
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:54,819
but I'm not blind.

1270
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:56,499
No. I've always known you were aware

1271
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,340
of what the spinster
in the corner felt.

1272
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:03,259
You were right not to give me
the ring years ago.

1273
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:04,620
I lived in hope then.

1274
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:10,420
At least I've seen you every day,
made myself useful to you.

1275
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,540
I settled for what I could get.

1276
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:23,020
You are the only one
who truly loves me.

1277
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:46,420
Beginners for act two.

1278
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:58,740
Who?

1279
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:04,339
Irene. I'm returning
the triple crown, Sir.

1280
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:05,700
Come.

1281
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:14,820
Put it down.

1282
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:33,699
Sir, will it disturb you
if I say something?

1283
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,660
Depends what it is.

1284
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:39,739
I just wanted to thank you.

1285
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:42,779
For what?
The performance this evening.

1286
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:46,419
It's not over yet. I felt honoured
to be on the stage.

1287
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:49,300
Open that drawer, you will find
a photograph of me.

1288
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:16,460
I love coming into this room.

1289
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:19,379
I can feel the power.

1290
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:21,140
And the mystery.

1291
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:25,499
In days gone by,
this would have been a place

1292
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,539
where the High Priests robed.

1293
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:28,940
A kindred spirit.

1294
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:33,020
Lock the door.

1295
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:53,700
Come nearer.

1296
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,540
It's Irene.

1297
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:59,740
Irene.

1298
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:07,539
You want to act?

1299
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,619
Yes. Passionately?

1300
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:12,219
Yes.
With every fibre of your being?

1301
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:13,619
Yes.

1302
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:15,499
To the exclusion of all else?

1303
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,339
Yes.

1304
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:23,219
You must be prepared to sacrifice
what most people call...

1305
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:25,419
life.

1306
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:27,299
I am.

1307
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:30,180
Your birth sign? Scorpio.

1308
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:35,419
Good.

1309
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:41,460
Ambition, secretiveness, loyalty,
capable of great jealously.

1310
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:45,300
Essential qualities in the theatre.

1311
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:48,260
Have you good legs?

1312
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:53,460
Come closer.

1313
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,540
Let me see.

1314
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,260
Higher.

1315
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:17,140
TOO good. All the best actresses
have legs like tree trunks.

1316
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:26,620
There's not much of you, is there?

1317
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:29,700
Such small bones.

1318
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:37,340
Are you getting enough to eat?

1319
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:45,459
So young...

1320
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:48,100
So young...

1321
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:53,100
That's more like it!

1322
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:59,260
Too late, too late.

1323
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:07,139
Well, now, my dainty duck,
my dearie-o. Let go of me!

1324
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:10,779
What was all that about?
He seems better.

1325
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:13,099
Better than what or whom,
as the case may be?

1326
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:16,259
I didn't think he'd get through
the performance tonight.

1327
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,379
He's NOT through it yet.
I'm waiting.

1328
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:21,419
For what? A graphic description
of events. Out with it,

1329
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:23,099
or I shall slap your face - hard.

1330
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,859
I thought we were friends!

1331
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,579
I thought we were too.

1332
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:27,580
Irene...

1333
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:31,859
I shall long remember welcoming
you into the company,

1334
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:34,859
in the prop room of
the Palace Theatre, Newark-on-Trent.

1335
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:37,459
You were locked in the arms
of the Prince of Morocco,

1336
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:40,139
a married man,
and ever such a comic sight

1337
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:42,939
with his tights round his ankles
and you smeared black.

1338
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:45,779
And I said,
"Don't worry, mum's the word,

1339
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:47,259
"but don't let it happen again."

1340
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:49,139
Sorry, what am I
supposed to have done?

1341
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:50,899
Well, you tell me. About what?

1342
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,739
About Sir.
You know who Sir is, Irene.

1343
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:56,339
I'm late. I have to help
Her Ladyship with her armour.

1344
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:58,419
Her Ladyship's armour will keep.

1345
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:01,019
Perhaps you didn't understand
the question.

1346
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:02,619
What did Sir do?

1347
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:04,179
I'm not telling you.

1348
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:06,139
Then I'll mark you for life, ducky.

1349
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:09,499
You! You strike me
and I'll tell Sir - I will, I will.

1350
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,219
I'll tell Sir, I'll tell Sir.

1351
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:14,059
Tell Sir? On me?
I quake in my boots.

1352
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,579
I shan't be able to eat my tea.
Oh, tell Sir!

1353
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:20,259
Never mind "tell Sir".
I'll tell YOU.

1354
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:23,299
He did something,
something unseen and furtive,

1355
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,460
something that gave him pleasure.

1356
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:29,659
He lifted me up in his arms.

1357
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:31,019
Lifted you up?

1358
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:33,179
And I understood,
I understood what he meant.

1359
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:37,219
"So young, so young," he said,
and lifted me up.

1360
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:41,059
"That's more like it," he cried,
and I knew, cradled in his arms,

1361
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:43,699
that it was youth and newness
he was after...

1362
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:49,579
It's not youth or talent
or star quality he's after, ducky,

1363
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:51,420
but a moderate eater.

1364
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:56,499
Oh, there you are.
You're late with my armour.

1365
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,940
Off you go, dear. You'll have
to find another canoe to paddle.

1366
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:10,100
Ours, I'm afraid... has holes.

1367
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:29,899
Be brief in it, to the castle;
For my writ is on the life of Lear

1368
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:33,220
and on Cordelia.
Nay, send in time.

1369
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,339
Haste thee for thy life.

1370
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:40,179
You're on. I wish you wouldn't do
that. You remind me of a labourer.

1371
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:44,419
...some good I mean to do,
despite of mine own nature.

1372
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:47,219
Ugh, God Almighty!

1373
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:48,660
Cue LX.

1374
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:01,099
Howl, howl, howl, howl!

1375
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:07,099
O, you are men of stones. Had I your
tongues and eyes, I'd use them

1376
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:09,980
so that heaven's vault
should crack.

1377
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:13,699
She's gone for ever!

1378
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:20,059
I know when one is dead, and
when one lives. She's dead as earth.

1379
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:22,419
Lend me a looking-glass;

1380
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:28,660
If that her breath will mist or stain
the stone, why, then she lives.

1381
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:34,819
This feather stirs; she lives!

1382
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:38,059
If it be so, it is a chance
which does redeem all sorrows

1383
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:40,139
that ever I have felt.

1384
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:42,499
Is this the promised end?

1385
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,219
Or image of that horror?

1386
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:51,260
And my poor fool is hang'd.
No, no, no life!

1387
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:56,419
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat,
have life,

1388
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:57,820
And thou no breath at all?

1389
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:02,379
Thou'lt come no more,

1390
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:11,140
Never, never, never, never, never!

1391
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:18,260
Pray you, undo this button.

1392
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:28,620
Thank you, sir. Do you see this?

1393
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:34,299
Look on her, her lips,

1394
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:39,420
Look there, look there.

1395
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:46,299
Look up, my lord.

1396
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:50,219
Stand by, curtain down.
O, let him pass. He hates him

1397
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:52,819
that would upon
the rack of this tough world

1398
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:55,220
stretch him out longer.
He's gone.

1399
01:23:56,500 --> 01:24:01,699
The weight of this sad time
we must obey. Speak what we feel,

1400
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:03,780
not what we ought to say.

1401
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:09,659
The oldest hath borne most,
we that are young

1402
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:15,340
shall never see so much,
nor live so long.

1403
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:19,260
Go flies.

1404
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:31,660
We've done it, Will, we've done it!

1405
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:35,820
Stand by for your curtain calls.

1406
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,500
Curtain going up.

1407
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:15,260
What play tomorrow? Richard III.

1408
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:21,979
Slavery, bloody slavery.
Norman, Norman.

1409
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:23,819
Sir.

1410
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:25,699
What will happen to you?

1411
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:27,580
Can you be a little more explicit?

1412
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:31,459
What will happen to you
if I cannot continue?

1413
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:34,979
Oh, stop it.
Nothing ever happens to me.

1414
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:37,820
I lead a life
entirely without incident.

1415
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:42,459
But if I should be
unable to continue...

1416
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:45,739
Well, there's no chance of that
so I'm not bothering to answer.

1417
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:48,179
I worry about you, my boy. Don't.

1418
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:50,659
Who?

1419
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:52,820
Geoffrey. Come. Oh god.

1420
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:59,779
Just popped in to say goodnight,
old man.

1421
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:03,739
Goodnight, Geoffrey.
Very fine in the storm scene.

1422
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:06,659
I felt your love,
and that's what matters.

1423
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:09,419
Oh, thank you.

1424
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:12,379
Fool is by far the most important
part I've ever played

1425
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:15,779
in Shakespeare. I hope you feel
I didn't let you down.

1426
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:19,659
Offer Geoffrey a small
glass of beer, Norman.

1427
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:21,060
Thank you.

1428
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:26,779
Well, such an odd feeling tonight,
old man.

1429
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:34,499
Rather exciting to reach my age
to prove to others that one can act.

1430
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:37,779
That's the wonderful thing
about this life of ours.

1431
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:40,980
It's never too late.
Surprising things happen.

1432
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:46,459
But there are disadvantages.

1433
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:48,300
One gets the taste for more.

1434
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:52,140
Cheers. May good health attend you.

1435
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:55,540
Bottoms up, Geoffrey.

1436
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:05,419
May I ask you a question, old man?
Ask.

1437
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:10,259
Fool is a curious role.
You give your all for almost

1438
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:14,419
an hour-and-a-half, then vanish into
thin air for the rest of the play.

1439
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:19,179
The next you hear of me
is you saying that I'm hanged.

1440
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:25,699
But why? By whom?
It seems awfully unfair.

1441
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:31,139
My theory is that, in William's day,
Fool and Cordelia were played

1442
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:36,659
by one and the same person. A very
good double, Fool and Cordelia.

1443
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:41,779
Saved an extra salary, of course.
Well, things haven't changed.

1444
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:45,579
As long as you feel
I didn't let you down.

1445
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:47,419
In no particular.

1446
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:51,579
Just one last thing, I won't keep
you, I know you're very tired.

1447
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:55,739
But when you interviewed me,
I said that I didn't want too much.

1448
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:57,740
Small parts, I said.

1449
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:05,259
It may not be thought admirable,
but I have never put a jot at risk.

1450
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:08,500
Never wanted to scale the heights.

1451
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:14,859
Played goodish parts,
tours, of course, never London.

1452
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:18,499
I don't complain.
Touring's a good life.

1453
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:23,019
Enjoyed my cricket in summer, hockey
in the winter...

1454
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:29,859
lovely women, long walks,
a weekly change of scene,

1455
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:33,339
the English countryside
in all weathers.

1456
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:34,940
What could be nicer?

1457
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:39,340
But never risked a jot.

1458
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:44,500
No, I've been lucky.
Mustn't complain.

1459
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:49,099
I expect I can get through
to the end of the chapter.

1460
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:51,019
I've a little put by.

1461
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:53,820
And my wife brings in a bit
from her singing lessons.

1462
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:59,300
I've no right to expect work,
not at my age.

1463
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:06,420
War's brought surprising employment.
All the youngsters at the front.

1464
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:10,900
My grandson, not a pro...

1465
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:15,020
...taken prisoner at Tripoli.

1466
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:26,339
Sorry to be so long-winded.

1467
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:31,059
But the point is,
if at any time circumstances arise,

1468
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:34,899
I should like to be considered
for better parts.

1469
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:37,300
And I shouldn't want
an increase in salary.

1470
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:44,219
I shall keep you
in the forefront of my mind.

1471
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:46,699
Thank you, old man.

1472
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:50,540
Well... Goodnight.

1473
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,460
Thank you for the drink.

1474
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,660
I can manage. Night, Norman.

1475
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:08,780
Fine fellow.

1476
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,460
Fine fellow.

1477
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:21,379
Shall we remove your make-up, Sir?

1478
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:25,019
I hope Will's pleased tonight.

1479
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,659
I had a friend...

1480
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:28,699
Not now, Norman.

1481
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:32,179
I had a friend who had
ever such a sweet singing voice,

1482
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:36,619
but he lost it in Colwyn Bay
after a bad attack of sea mist.

1483
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:41,699
But it came back to him again,
in the end, and do you know why?

1484
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:46,899
Because he said to himself they
also sing who only stand and serve.

1485
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:48,539
Or words to that effect.

1486
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,259
Are you pissed, Norman?

1487
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:52,019
Me, Sir? Pissed, Sir?

1488
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:55,100
Sir Percy, how you do tousle me.

1489
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:58,500
Let me smell your breath.

1490
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:04,419
There. Told you.
Sweet as Winston Churchill.

1491
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:06,140
I can't have you pissed.

1492
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:09,980
You not dressed yet?

1493
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:13,979
I'm a little slow tonight,
Pussy.

1494
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:15,819
I'm not waiting.

1495
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:19,179
I'll go back to the digs,
and see if I can get a fire lit.

1496
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:20,499
I won't be long.

1497
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:25,339
Goodnight, Norman. ..I'm not sure
whether I should thank you or not.

1498
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:28,139
Not. I can't bear to be thanked.

1499
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:29,820
Goodnight.

1500
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:39,780
She's a good woman.

1501
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:43,620
Good woman.

1502
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:52,740
Who? Mr Oxenby.

1503
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:05,979
What do you want? My manuscript.
He won't read it, I know that.

1504
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:08,979
Keep your voice down! He's not gone
yet. Just wait there.

1505
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:10,299
He's a little slow tonight.

1506
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:13,779
All that struggling and surviving
has tired him, no doubt.

1507
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:15,139
Please, Mr Oxenby.

1508
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:18,739
Outmoded hypocrite.
Tell him from me, I look forward

1509
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:21,499
to a new order.
I want a company without tyrants.

1510
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,339
Who'd be in charge?

1511
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:24,699
I would.

1512
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:28,619
You'll be lovely with a bit success,
Mr Oxenby.

1513
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:31,780
Your nose is browner than usual
tonight, Norman.

1514
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:36,899
Goodnight, Sir.

1515
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:39,300
If you hurry,
you'll catch Mr Oxenby.

1516
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,179
Sir? AGH!

1517
01:32:55,180 --> 01:33:00,899
Oh, good God! I am tired. Terribly
tired. The room is spinning.

1518
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:03,059
I must lie down.

1519
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:06,700
See if you can get me a taxi
in this godforsaken place.

1520
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:10,179
All in good time.

1521
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:14,979
Oh, don't cry. Now, don't cry.

1522
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:17,459
There's nothing left.

1523
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:19,540
Stop that at once.

1524
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:23,779
I had a friend...

1525
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:26,419
Oh, for Christ's sake,
I'm sick of your friends!

1526
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:30,499
The motley crew they are.
Pathetic, lonely, despairing...

1527
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:32,099
That's nice, isn't it?

1528
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:35,659
I beg your pardon. Uncalled for.

1529
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:38,179
Think of me as your friend.

1530
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:40,579
Never despairing.

1531
01:33:40,580 --> 01:33:42,419
Have apologised.

1532
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:44,780
Never, never despairing.

1533
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:52,300
Well, perhaps sometimes. At night.

1534
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:56,739
Or at Christmas,
when you can't get a job in a panto.

1535
01:33:56,740 --> 01:33:59,740
But never once inside the building.
Never.

1536
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:11,859
Pathetic maybe, but not ungrateful.

1537
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:15,419
Too mindful of one's luck,
as the saying goes.

1538
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:21,260
No duke is more privileged. Here's
beauty, here's spring and summer.

1539
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:28,380
Here pain is bearable.
And never lonely. Not here.

1540
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:37,100
For he that sheds his blood today
with me. Soft, no doubt.

1541
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:42,660
Sensitive - that's my nature.
Easily hurt, but that's a virtue.

1542
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:47,739
And I'm not here
for any reasons of my own either.

1543
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:50,179
No-one could accuse me
of base motives.

1544
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:53,980
I have got what I want
and I don't need anyone to know it.

1545
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:03,460
Inadequate, yes.
But never, never despairing.

1546
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:07,580
I've begun My Life.

1547
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:13,060
Fetch it. The book.

1548
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:15,940
I made a start...

1549
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:28,419
You didn't get very far...

1550
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:29,899
What did I write?

1551
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:31,540
"My Life. Dedication.

1552
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:38,699
"This book is dedicated
to my beloved Pussy,

1553
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:41,140
"who has been my splendid spur.

1554
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:46,019
"To the spirit of all actors
because of their faith

1555
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:49,259
"and endurance
which never fails them.

1556
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:51,659
"To those who do
the work of the theatre yet have

1557
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:54,139
"but small share in the glory.

1558
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:59,499
"The carpenters, electricians,
scene-shifters, property men.

1559
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:02,819
"To the audiences, who have laughed
with us, have wept with us

1560
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:05,259
"and whose hearts have united
with ours

1561
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:07,259
"in sympathy and understanding."

1562
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:09,739
"But finally..."

1563
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:12,419
ah, Sir,

1564
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:15,420
"to the memory
of William Shakespeare...

1565
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:19,860
"..in whose glorious service
we all labour."

1566
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:25,860
My Life will have to do.

1567
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:37,580
Wait a moment, wait a moment...

1568
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:42,740
"The carpenters, electricians,
scene-shifters..."

1569
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:45,260
Sir?

1570
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:47,940
Sir...

1571
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:53,700
Sir?

1572
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:01,940
Sir...

1573
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:07,220
We're not dead, are we?

1574
01:37:08,860 --> 01:37:10,700
That's your cue.
You know the line.

1575
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:14,939
"You lie! Jack Clinton..."

1576
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:16,820
"lives!"

1577
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:21,660
Talk about untoward.

1578
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:29,740
Ooh... You're right.
The room is spinning.

1579
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:33,180
Your Ladyship!

1580
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:45,820
Anybody!

1581
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:28,419
Wasn't much of a death scene.

1582
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:30,060
Unremarkable.

1583
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:35,979
And ever so short.
For him.

1584
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:37,820
Where's Her Ladyship?

1585
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:43,299
They all left before he did.
Couldn't wait.

1586
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:44,660
I'll telephone her.

1587
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:47,939
And I'll get a doctor.

1588
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:50,019
Too late for a doctor, ducky.

1589
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:51,700
What's going to happen to me?

1590
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:55,379
Close the door. Wait outside.

1591
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:57,739
I don't want to wait outside.

1592
01:38:57,740 --> 01:39:01,179
I NEVER wait outside.
I want to be with HIM.

1593
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:03,340
I know my place, ducky.

1594
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:07,860
Try and sober up.

1595
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:10,740
Ambulance, please.

1596
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:20,059
"Carpenters, electricians,
property men"? You cruel bastard.

1597
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:21,699
You might have remembered.

1598
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:25,299
Yes, Your Ladyship, it's Madge.

1599
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:28,780
I was wondering if you could come
to the theatre.

1600
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:55,099
Her Ladyship's coming at once.
She took it very calmly.

1601
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:58,299
She asked for him
to be covered in his Lear cloak.

1602
01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:00,739
Covered in his Lear cloak?

1603
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:02,699
Ooh! Fetch the photographers, ducky.

1604
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:04,379
Covered in his Lear cloak?

1605
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:07,619
This isn't the Death of Nelson,
you know.

1606
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:09,020
Where is it?

1607
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:50,500
There's no mention
of stage managers either.

1608
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:54,380
Come out of here.

1609
01:40:56,060 --> 01:40:58,179
Are we going to get paid?

1610
01:40:58,180 --> 01:41:02,659
I mean, is there money in the till
after deductions for income tax?

1611
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:05,299
We've got to be paid
for the full week, you know.

1612
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:08,299
Just because a man dies
on Thursday doesn't mean to say

1613
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:09,539
we get paid pro rata.

1614
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:11,339
Come away.

1615
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:13,299
Where will I go?

1616
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:18,500
Where?
I'm nowhere... out of my element.

1617
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:24,060
I don't want to end up running
a boarding house in Colwyn Bay.

1618
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:28,020
What am I going to do?

1619
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:30,859
You can speak well of him.

1620
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:32,339
Speak well of THAT old sod?

1621
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:36,779
I wouldn't give him a good
character, not in a court of law.

1622
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:38,619
The ungrateful bastard.

1623
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:40,379
Get out. Get out!

1624
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:41,659
I don't want you in here.

1625
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:44,299
Holy, holy, holy, is it?
This isn't a shrine!

1626
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:46,339
No pissing on the altar.

1627
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:47,940
Stop it.

1628
01:41:57,740 --> 01:42:00,139
Speak well of him?
I know what YOU'D say.

1629
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:01,740
I know all about YOU, ducky.

1630
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:05,619
I have eyes in my head.

1631
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,579
We all have our little sorrows.

1632
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:14,499
I know what you'd say - stiff upper,
faithful, loyal, loving.

1633
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:17,139
Well, I have only one thing to say
about him

1634
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:21,299
and I wouldn't say it in front
of you, or Her Ladyship, or anyone.

1635
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:26,099
Lips tight shut. I wouldn't give you
the pleasure. Or him.

1636
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:27,099
Especially not him.

1637
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:30,739
If I said what I have to say, he'd
find a way to take it out on me.

1638
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:32,700
No-one will ever know.

1639
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:37,379
We all have our little sorrows,
ducky...

1640
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:38,859
You're not the only one.

1641
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:44,180
The littler you are,
the larger your sorrows.

1642
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:48,260
You think you loved him?

1643
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:52,100
What about me?

1644
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:11,820
Oh, this is no place for death.

1645
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:15,060
I had a friend...
