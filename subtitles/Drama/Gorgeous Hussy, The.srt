00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:08,491
<i>We live on Fortune Shell Island
in Taiwan.<\i></i>

2
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:13,787
<i>A hundred years ago there was
no TV here, no bars, no karaoke.<\i></i>

3
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:19,249
<i>Just a small fishing village
in which a young couple lived.<\i></i>

4
00:01:19,422 --> 00:01:25,461
<i>They were in love. The kind of
love that feels like it's supposed to.<\i></i>

5
00:01:25,637 --> 00:01:30,879
<i>One day when the man was fishing
in the ocean, a storm sank his boat.<\i></i>

6
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:37,097
<i>The woman saw it and shouted: "Bu!",
which is Mandarin for "no".<\i></i>

7
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:44,236
<i>She dove into the ocean to rescue him,
and they were never heard from again.<\i></i>

8
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:49,197
<i>Some say they found each other
in the afterlife.<\i></i>

9
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:51,610
<i>Some say they turned into dolphins -<\i></i>

10
00:01:51,788 --> 00:01:56,533
<i>- because once they find a mate,
they never part.<\i></i>

11
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:04,337
<i>Of all the dolphins on Earth, -<\i></i>

12
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:09,799
<i>- only the ones on Fortune Shell Island
make the sound: "Bu!".<\i></i>

13
00:02:22,985 --> 00:02:25,108
How about that?

14
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,941
What do you guys know?

15
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:36,079
That story is so depressing.

16
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:42,120
- Mind your eavesdropping.
- Gee, sorry.

17
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:45,746
- Are you hungry, honey?
- No.

18
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:49,837
When I ask a question,
you might not always say "no".

19
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,466
You were the one who called me Bu, Ma.

20
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:55,425
I need a little help here.

21
00:02:55,808 --> 00:03:01,016
Don't talk to our daughter
in so many different languages!

22
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:05,897
Look at her. Half the time she speaks
Taiwanese, half the time Mandarin, -

23
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:08,476
- the other half, she speaks English.

24
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:11,940
If you think it's so easy,
you raise her.

25
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:18,450
- Or keep it to yourself, Tubby.
- What did you just call me?

26
00:03:19,623 --> 00:03:23,490
What did she just call me?
I want to know.

27
00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:27,251
What did you just say?...
Well, I'm on a diet.

28
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:52,567
Okay, you're done.
I learned it from a fashion magazine.

29
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,408
It's very stylish. Do you like it?

30
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:09,581
Have you got a second?
Wait until you see what I bought you.

31
00:04:09,756 --> 00:04:14,085
In my whole life,
I've never seen an oyster like this one.

32
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,676
- Any pearls?
- No.

33
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,312
- Looks like it's expensive.
- A hundred dollars.

34
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:32,191
- Thank you.
- I also have this.

35
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,280
My friend owns a wedding chapel.
He'll give us a discount. So l...

36
00:04:39,743 --> 00:04:45,947
- Are you asking?
- No, just wondering if... I'm asking.

37
00:04:46,124 --> 00:04:50,584
You got this gigantic oyster
because you want us to...

38
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:56,838
I bought this because the jewellery shop
was closed. Will you marry me?

39
00:04:58,178 --> 00:05:00,087
Yes...

40
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:04,178
I'll consider it.

41
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:25,073
Why did you come
all the way from Hong Kong to marry Pop?

42
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:30,240
Your old pop was quite a hunk.
And a good cook, too.

43
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:45,841
- Did you like Hong Kong?
- I loved it. Especially the pot rice.

44
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:49,644
You don't really love Louis, do you?

45
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,056
May I give you a little advice
before it's too late?

46
00:05:56,235 --> 00:05:59,069
You have to trust your heart.

47
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:23,673
Hi there, Buddy.
I've got some news for you.

48
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:27,597
Louis says he wants to marry me.

49
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:30,466
Cut it out!

50
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,143
I heard a story once.

51
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:40,941
Souls start out together,
but when they enter into the world, -

52
00:06:41,112 --> 00:06:43,685
- they somehow get separated.

53
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:48,325
They continue to search on,
until they can find -

54
00:06:49,703 --> 00:06:54,827
- who it is that they were
destined to go through life with.

55
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:59,083
What?...
Bu! Where are you going?

56
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:31,860
<i>"I'm waiting for you in Hong Kong.
Albert."<\i></i>

57
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,366
How romantic.

58
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:46,583
Excuse me,
I'm looking for a place to eat.

59
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:51,920
Can you write down the names of
some restaurants? Thank you.

60
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:05,853
- Taiwanese white trash.
- Don't be like that.

61
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,693
- You speak English?
- Yes. Surprised?

62
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:22,001
- Is this your first flight?
- You can tell?

63
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:27,958
Of course, I can tell.
Hong Kong is enormous, you can get lost.

64
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:33,252
I could show you around.
Manhattan Robert here. I know everyone.

65
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,557
Just ask around.
You could say I'm famous.

66
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,931
What do you say?

67
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,942
- What are you doing?
- Do you have a twin?

68
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:56,280
Excuse me a second.

69
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,081
<i>"Gangster’s girlfriend disappears."<\i></i>

70
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:09,916
<i>- Good morning, Mr Chan.<\i>
- Good day. Wall Street moving today?</i>

71
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,551
<i>Yes, the Lion Fund borrowed heavily
from the interbank market.<\i></i>

72
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:17,008
<i>They get a 20 per cent interest rate.<\i></i>

73
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:21,475
<i>That could climb even higher
by morning.<\i></i>

74
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:28,103
Poke around a little. See if Lion Fund
has sold any Nikkei futures.

75
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:31,192
Then see if the yen is rising.

76
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:36,486
Check if Japan's naval base contract
with the U.S. expires soon.

77
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:41,485
If all answers are positive,
I'll buy up every possible share.

78
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:45,874
<i>Are you aware that Lion Fund
is run by two Nobel Prize winners?<\i></i>

79
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:48,663
<i>It’s a great formula, why doubt them?<\i></i>

80
00:09:48,836 --> 00:09:50,580
I have my reasons.

81
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:54,420
They're greedy.
It's all on paper, their cash is poor.

82
00:09:54,592 --> 00:09:58,506
It's time to make our move.
Go ahead and do it.

83
00:10:06,603 --> 00:10:12,808
Order 1 00 roses and have them
delivered to Carmen. Attach this card.

84
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:18,406
- Didn't you two break up?
- We're still friends.

85
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:24,740
You're a big boy. You should settle down
with someone soon.

86
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:29,450
- Impossible.
- With all those women?

87
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:35,001
- They're so beautiful and elegant, too.
- Too elegant for me.

88
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:38,791
Make sure you know the right girl
when you see her.

89
00:10:38,969 --> 00:10:41,210
I'll know her.

90
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:45,574
Don't wait for me. Help yourself.

91
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,070
That bottle
floated all the way to Taiwan?

92
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:55,119
And you came here.

93
00:11:55,293 --> 00:12:00,964
Hopped a ride to Hong Kong.
Romantic and endearing.

94
00:12:04,135 --> 00:12:07,717
- There's news I need to break to you.
- Yes?

95
00:12:08,473 --> 00:12:13,812
- One little detail you should know.
- What?

96
00:12:16,564 --> 00:12:18,723
Listen.

97
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:30,317
- No way!
- Oh yes, it's true.

98
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:33,697
- Come on, honestly?
- Yes, I swear.

99
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,414
- The note was to your boyfriend?
- Ex-boyfriend.

100
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:42,913
- But why?
- Because he broke it off.

101
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,004
- I mean, why are you gay?
- As if it's a choice.

102
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:52,510
- Well, you're a handsome guy.
- True. None the less.

103
00:12:59,855 --> 00:13:02,561
All right!

104
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:07,443
"I'm waiting for you here."
That's how you got the idea.

105
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:10,817
I chose this apartment
because of the billboard.

106
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:19,457
I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.
You don't get seasick, do you?

107
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:38,390
Beautiful!

108
00:13:57,246 --> 00:13:59,618
It's a good job.

109
00:14:54,301 --> 00:14:58,381
You sounded nervous on the phone.
What's the emergency?

110
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:02,850
There's no emergency.
I just missed you. You don't miss me?

111
00:15:03,978 --> 00:15:06,647
Sit down, I'll get you a drink.

112
00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:12,311
Tell me what's going on.

113
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,736
Maybe you better go.

114
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:46,472
Such a shame.
You're boating and you didn't call me?

115
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:50,309
- Yet you're here.
- The papers say you're dating my girl.

116
00:15:50,564 --> 00:15:55,310
You believe everything you read?
That's childish.

117
00:15:55,486 --> 00:15:58,274
- Well, tell me: Are you?
- Yes.

118
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:06,491
You've been competing with me
for everything since we were kids.

119
00:16:08,748 --> 00:16:10,908
Chan, come here.

120
00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:16,119
I heard you're interested in my stocks.

121
00:16:16,298 --> 00:16:19,667
I'm interested in many stocks,
not just yours.

122
00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:24,968
My associates and l
hold all the controlling stock.

123
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,849
- No way you're taking over my company.
- Why not?

124
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:34,311
You're standing on my boat,
with my girlfriend.

125
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:36,974
You must have a death-wish!

126
00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:40,568
Maybe you can try to get to the point.

127
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:47,275
I think I deserve an apology.

128
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:53,741
You don't have to do it in front of them.
Call me five minutes after I've gone.

129
00:16:54,627 --> 00:16:58,328
Five minutes.
You've got the time?

130
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:04,378
The little hand is on the six.
If your watch doesn't work, why wear it?

131
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:07,881
I like the diamonds. Genuine.

132
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:11,760
Guys, keep an eye on him.

133
00:17:11,936 --> 00:17:16,893
If he doesn't call me in five minutes,
throw him right into the ocean.

134
00:17:17,065 --> 00:17:20,269
Give him a life preserver.
Don't let him drown.

135
00:17:32,831 --> 00:17:35,368
So long, Boss. See you.

136
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:40,871
Do yourself a favour.
Call him and tell him you're sorry.

137
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:47,548
- Hurry up. I've got a really hot date.
- You must want to go in the water.

138
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:51,761
Get the life preserver...
Let's go.

139
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:54,804
- I'm not interested.
- Don't fight it.

140
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:11,818
- Here's the life preserver.
- Hurry, he's drowning!

141
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:13,989
He's over there!

142
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,083
Don't move.

143
00:18:26,633 --> 00:18:29,207
Help him. Chan went that way.

144
00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:19,555
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

145
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:35,905
I'll call you.

146
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:47,077
Where is he?

147
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,256
I don't see him. Can you see him?

148
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:02,015
Are you okay? I'll go help the others.

149
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,474
Hey, I know you... He's over here!

150
00:20:08,524 --> 00:20:10,564
He's in the back!

151
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:12,942
Help me, I'm drowning.

152
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:17,276
- Here, have a life preserver.
- Thank you.

153
00:20:21,204 --> 00:20:24,158
- Does anybody see him?
- No.

154
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:40,004
Catch!

155
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:53,434
Wait, there he goes!

156
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:03,322
- He got away!
- The Boss gave us instructions.

157
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:07,908
Throw him into the ocean with
a life preserver and that's what we did.

158
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,324
Job done, let's go eat.

159
00:21:39,072 --> 00:21:40,899
Thank you.

160
00:21:41,074 --> 00:21:45,024
- Are you all right?
- You are...

161
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:48,654
I'm Bu.

162
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:55,461
- Are you escaping?
- Sure, why not?

163
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:00,090
- From Vietnam?
- Yes, that's right.

164
00:22:01,135 --> 00:22:05,084
- How many are you?
- Just one.

165
00:22:05,263 --> 00:22:07,589
Well, then who's driving?

166
00:22:20,237 --> 00:22:26,524
- You want to give me a hand?
- I'm starving. I'm hungry.

167
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:31,944
- How about you?
- I'm not starving yet, but I am hungry.

168
00:22:39,547 --> 00:22:45,383
Let's talk a little.
It'll help us forget that we're hungry.

169
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:48,554
What about?

170
00:22:48,723 --> 00:22:52,009
About all the things you really enjoy.

171
00:22:53,979 --> 00:22:59,185
Music, bowling, cars, women.
Nothing?

172
00:23:01,735 --> 00:23:04,986
What are you smiling about?
It's so boring.

173
00:23:05,156 --> 00:23:07,861
Let's talk about things you don't like.

174
00:23:09,076 --> 00:23:11,449
I don't like nosey people.

175
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:27,002
Tell me what you don't like.

176
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:33,713
I don't like growing up.
Because you can't act spoiled.

177
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:39,231
- Did you say "soiled"?
- I said, "spoiled".

178
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:43,609
The more you're grown up,
the less people like you.

179
00:23:43,777 --> 00:23:46,315
What do you like best?

180
00:23:47,155 --> 00:23:52,824
Taking a shower when I'm really hot.
When I wake up to a fresh cup of coffee.

181
00:23:56,998 --> 00:23:59,205
That sounds good.

182
00:24:01,502 --> 00:24:06,460
- The stars in Hong Kong are gorgeous.
- The stars in Hong Kong?

183
00:24:06,632 --> 00:24:12,636
Stars everywhere are just as beautiful.
You just have to look up and see them.

184
00:24:16,434 --> 00:24:18,225
What?

185
00:24:18,394 --> 00:24:24,515
A shooting star! My Mum says you
should put your hands in your pocket, -

186
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:30,481
- make a wish, and it will come true.
Too bad I don't have any pockets.

187
00:24:30,656 --> 00:24:32,779
There's another one.

188
00:24:43,543 --> 00:24:48,585
- What did you wish for?
- I'm not telling. It'll be bad luck.

189
00:24:53,428 --> 00:24:56,097
You're a nosey body, aren't you?

190
00:25:00,268 --> 00:25:02,759
I'm so sleepy.

191
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:56,863
- Look, out there!
- What is it?

192
00:25:57,032 --> 00:26:00,615
A boat! A boat!
Over here.

193
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:34,230
Busses don't go here and the authorities
check out ID. You want a lift?

194
00:26:34,402 --> 00:26:38,862
That's okay. Just tell me where I am,
and I'll walk back myself.

195
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:43,906
No one lives around here.
We're in the middle of nowhere, Miss...

196
00:26:44,077 --> 00:26:47,328
- My name is Bu.
- Boob?

197
00:26:47,498 --> 00:26:50,748
- All right, just get in.
- Okay.

198
00:26:50,918 --> 00:26:54,916
Wait, not you.
I was talking to her.

199
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,082
- I've noticed there's only two seats.
- Yes, here's 20 bucks.

200
00:27:02,261 --> 00:27:07,850
Walk straight ahead till you see a taxi,
or bum a ride on a boat, like I did.

201
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,120
Come in.

202
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,119
- You live here all alone?
- There's a butler.

203
00:27:36,295 --> 00:27:41,502
- You're kidding. Must get real crowded.
- Have a seat.

204
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:45,009
- Can I look around?
- Yes, sure.

205
00:27:59,235 --> 00:28:01,393
I'm hungry.

206
00:28:05,991 --> 00:28:08,564
Oh, I'm so hungry.

207
00:28:49,284 --> 00:28:52,699
- You need something?
- The fish food.

208
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:56,619
They don't need it,
they're virtual fish.

209
00:28:56,791 --> 00:29:00,740
- Come here. Over here.
- Why do you have electronic fish?

210
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,253
I never have to change the water.

211
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:07,632
- What if the power goes out?
- I don't know.

212
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:11,336
With this big house
you must have parties all the time.

213
00:29:11,513 --> 00:29:15,511
- I don't have any friends.
- You must be lonely.

214
00:29:26,737 --> 00:29:29,228
Now what?

215
00:29:29,406 --> 00:29:31,564
You like to fight, huh?

216
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:35,406
Some like to play golf,
some like horse-racing.

217
00:29:35,578 --> 00:29:38,449
I like boxing and fitness training.

218
00:29:38,623 --> 00:29:42,871
- What's this octopus thing?
- Come on, let's go.

219
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:55,257
This should fit you.
You can change in there.

220
00:30:02,438 --> 00:30:04,348
Behind there.

221
00:30:05,274 --> 00:30:09,936
Hi, Betty.
I need a taxi.

222
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:12,734
Half an hour? Great.

223
00:30:39,766 --> 00:30:44,179
I didn't mean in there.
There's a room behind the mirror.

224
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:49,524
I was afraid I'd get lost in there
and never find my way out.

225
00:30:51,195 --> 00:30:54,812
- Are you hungry?
- Absolutely starving.

226
00:30:54,947 --> 00:30:58,612
- Then let's eat.
- Do you have any Chinese pot rice?

227
00:30:58,784 --> 00:31:00,493
What?

228
00:31:13,424 --> 00:31:18,501
- This is the best take-out food.
- I use this restaurant a lot.

229
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:23,804
- Such a nice kitchen and you don't cook?
- I don't like all the grease.

230
00:31:26,354 --> 00:31:30,565
- Stop staring at me. Eat your lunch.
- Okay.

231
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:50,829
- Why are you smiling?
- I enjoy watching you eat.

232
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:59,713
- Are you rich?
- I guess so.

233
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:02,555
- How did you make it?
- Garbage.

234
00:32:02,722 --> 00:32:05,759
- No, really.
- Buying and selling it.

235
00:32:05,934 --> 00:32:08,176
Don't be that way.

236
00:32:18,446 --> 00:32:23,784
- Do you happen to have a soda pop?
- How about juice? It's healthier.

237
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:50,642
Looking for Bu?
She just went down the elevator.

238
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:56,723
Your boyfriend is in these every week.

239
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,732
Each time pictured with a new girlfriend.

240
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:03,531
I'd call him promiscuous
and not cute.

241
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:09,120
Look at this. Let's hear it
from one of his ex-girlfriends.

242
00:33:10,872 --> 00:33:15,000
"He doesn't know how to please me.
He doesn't say sweet things.

243
00:33:15,168 --> 00:33:18,537
And yet,
I'd say he's very romantic.

244
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:22,296
He gets right to the point.
Always doing business deals.

245
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,756
And yet, he's just a kid.

246
00:33:24,928 --> 00:33:28,877
He's very competitive.
He enjoys new things.

247
00:33:29,056 --> 00:33:32,721
He never changes,
once he's made up his mind.

248
00:33:32,893 --> 00:33:36,179
With him... I feel very insecure."

249
00:33:36,355 --> 00:33:40,768
- So. That means what?
- He likes new things, as in new girls.

250
00:33:40,944 --> 00:33:44,110
Soon we'll be reading about you.

251
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,360
All those girls are just mean.
They were insecure to start with.

252
00:33:48,534 --> 00:33:52,578
- l, on the other hand, am secure.
- Forget it.

253
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:58,040
Hong Kong is such a boring place anyway.

254
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:03,541
- Going home?
- No. C.N. is fun.

255
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:10,928
You don't even have him yet. You can't
just go up and take off your clothes.

256
00:34:11,097 --> 00:34:14,762
- Do you think I'm like that?
- Do you think he isn't like that?

257
00:34:14,934 --> 00:34:20,225
He likes girls, he's successful.
I have an idea, and it involves you.

258
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:22,522
Count me out.

259
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:26,441
- Please?
- Fat chance.

260
00:34:27,947 --> 00:34:31,398
<i>Tell me where your daughter went.<\i></i>

261
00:34:31,534 --> 00:34:35,449
<i>Bu found a bottle
and went to Hong Kong.<\i></i>

262
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,205
If Bu's here in Hong Kong,
I'll find her.

263
00:34:41,377 --> 00:34:45,291
We checked out
Lo's Chemicals Manufacturing.

264
00:34:45,464 --> 00:34:48,169
Last year they had a 1 3 per cent growth.

265
00:34:48,342 --> 00:34:52,720
The net profit was 1 30 million dollars.
The stock prices are 30 per cent higher.

266
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:54,632
Shall we keep going?

267
00:34:54,807 --> 00:34:57,049
We've bought 16 per cent of the company.

268
00:34:57,226 --> 00:35:01,639
Mr Lo and partners have a death-grip
on their 65 per cent and refuse to sell.

269
00:35:01,814 --> 00:35:06,440
If we continue to raise the price,
the stock will become too high.

270
00:35:07,236 --> 00:35:09,312
Sell all my shares.

271
00:35:10,823 --> 00:35:14,737
If you sell all your shares at once,
the price will plunge.

272
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:19,038
If we sell low,
our company will suffer a loss.

273
00:35:19,206 --> 00:35:22,575
Just do exactly as I told you.

274
00:35:24,503 --> 00:35:27,076
- I need to see K.K.
- Yes, sir.

275
00:35:27,256 --> 00:35:31,336
- Who's K.K.?
- The head of Environmental Protection.

276
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,008
<i>'"You're a dead man."<\i></i>

277
00:36:12,757 --> 00:36:16,376
Going down?
Sorry, I'm going up.

278
00:36:16,554 --> 00:36:21,381
- I'm meeting a friend on the top floor.
- This is the top.

279
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,719
- Really? Oh yeah, she lives downstairs.
- Her name is?

280
00:36:27,898 --> 00:36:30,733
Actually, it's a blind date...

281
00:36:33,695 --> 00:36:37,740
This floor is nice.
I bet the rent is high.

282
00:36:37,908 --> 00:36:42,948
- Who made you write on my door?
- What do you mean?

283
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:52,708
Hey, look over there!

284
00:36:57,135 --> 00:36:59,921
Don't move, or I'll break it.

285
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:02,302
Let go, let go!

286
00:37:02,473 --> 00:37:05,889
- Why did you do it?
- Let go first.

287
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:09,304
Some handwriting, huh?

288
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,031
Cut it out!
I'm bad at kung fu, I'm just delivering.

289
00:37:24,202 --> 00:37:27,619
- To me?
- Check the rear pocket.

290
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:41,292
You big bully, now it's broken.
You'll hear from my lawyer.

291
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:43,547
Now read it.

292
00:37:44,557 --> 00:37:46,762
"Gangster's Girl Missing."

293
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:54,682
- What happened?
- Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

294
00:37:54,857 --> 00:38:00,529
No, with C.N. Did he buy the story?
Does he believe I'm the gangster's girl?

295
00:38:00,698 --> 00:38:04,113
Who knows?
Do you think it'll work?

296
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:06,691
Of course it will.

297
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:10,618
- What do we do next?
- Get help from your buddies...

298
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,699
I mean, your boyfriends.

299
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:23,509
You're in big trouble, lady.
We'll chop you to pieces.

300
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:28,169
Make it good...
You're going the wrong way.

301
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:32,927
Your boyfriend is the mob boss of Taiwan.
Our boss hates your boyfriend.

302
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:36,271
So he told us to cut up your face...
Your turn.

303
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:40,568
If you don't believe us,
just read the newspapers.

304
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:43,273
Now everybody's looking for you.

305
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,400
It worked. He's riding over.

306
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,601
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. And you?

307
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,522
- It's you!
- Are you okay?

308
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,440
I'm not sure who those guys are...
Never mind.

309
00:39:58,895 --> 00:40:02,644
What's the matter with you?
Don't let him see your face.

310
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,734
These guys are really good for actors.

311
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,545
Stay away. I'll stab you.

312
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:21,016
Let her go, or I'll stab myself.

313
00:41:21,184 --> 00:41:23,592
You just cut yourself.

314
00:41:24,646 --> 00:41:29,189
- We'll let you live.
- Let's get out of here.

315
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,942
Don't chase them.
Let's go, before the cops get here.

316
00:41:33,363 --> 00:41:37,692
- Whose factory is this?
- We're okay here. I own it.

317
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:41,485
- Why is it loaded with garbage?
- I told you, I buy trash.

318
00:41:41,662 --> 00:41:46,455
- It's worth a lot of money.
- I should tell my boyfriend about this.

319
00:41:47,293 --> 00:41:50,377
First you told me you were a refugee.

320
00:41:50,546 --> 00:41:54,591
Now you're
a Taiwanese mob boss's girlfriend.

321
00:41:54,759 --> 00:41:59,005
- Are you really?
- Yes. A dangerous woman to be with.

322
00:41:59,179 --> 00:42:02,098
- Are you afraid?
- I'm never scared.

323
00:42:02,267 --> 00:42:06,098
You're not afraid
my boyfriend will kill you?

324
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:12,640
How did you become
a gangster's girlfriend?

325
00:42:12,818 --> 00:42:15,688
There's a police station near my home.

326
00:42:15,862 --> 00:42:19,363
One day I saw these "wanted" posters.

327
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:24,242
One of them had these beautiful eyebrows
to go with these beautiful eyes.

328
00:42:24,413 --> 00:42:30,450
I went in every day and saw those eyes.
It was love at first sight.

329
00:42:30,585 --> 00:42:35,628
- Then what happened?
- I got his address. Now we're together.

330
00:42:36,425 --> 00:42:39,211
What was it you liked about him?

331
00:42:39,385 --> 00:42:42,837
He had a lot of style
and was a great dancer.

332
00:42:44,683 --> 00:42:47,173
Very romantic.

333
00:42:47,726 --> 00:42:52,519
- Dancing means romance?
- Like you're romantic.

334
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:55,016
I can dance.

335
00:42:56,152 --> 00:43:00,897
- Like this?
- Yes.

336
00:43:01,824 --> 00:43:04,113
How about tango?

337
00:43:07,788 --> 00:43:08,902
Yes.

338
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,996
You're dull!
Don't you know any exciting dances?

339
00:43:13,169 --> 00:43:16,751
- I know one.
- You mean it? Let's see.

340
00:43:18,006 --> 00:43:20,758
- Don't be scared.
- No way.

341
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:26,128
Hands here... Jump up here.

342
00:43:27,433 --> 00:43:29,425
Here we go.

343
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:41,236
- Pretty good.
- More.

344
00:43:41,404 --> 00:43:45,237
- Not bored yet?
- No, you're lots of fun.

345
00:43:48,036 --> 00:43:51,701
Just make sure you hold on tight.
Don't let go.

346
00:43:51,873 --> 00:43:54,245
We'll be going pretty fast. Ready?

347
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:57,038
Put your hands here and jump.

348
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:13,257
Howie, the Exchange closed.

349
00:44:13,435 --> 00:44:18,513
It dropped a lot. Our stock took
a 20 per cent hit. Closed at 6.50.

350
00:44:21,277 --> 00:44:26,234
- What's the loss in assets?
- Ten million. Give or take a little.

351
00:44:26,406 --> 00:44:31,033
It's because Chan
is dumping off our shares.

352
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:33,824
What about our investigation?

353
00:44:33,997 --> 00:44:39,336
If Chan's goal is to control the company,
he can't get rid of us.

354
00:44:39,461 --> 00:44:43,873
Then why dump his shares
after buying so high?

355
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:48,509
It doesn't make sense anymore.
What's going on?

356
00:44:49,388 --> 00:44:52,970
It's a scheme. What's he up to?

357
00:44:59,106 --> 00:45:02,107
- What happened?
- We ambushed Chan.

358
00:45:02,275 --> 00:45:05,441
- Is he hurt?
- No. Not a scratch on him.

359
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:10,024
That makes me feel better.
If something happened, I'd blame myself.

360
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,704
And if any of you men got hurt,
I'd be devastated.

361
00:45:16,372 --> 00:45:20,370
- I'm feeling guilty already.
- It was your dad's idea.

362
00:45:20,543 --> 00:45:23,461
My dad's? What was he thinking?

363
00:45:23,629 --> 00:45:27,959
Ambushing my best friend.
Why don't we shoot him in the back?

364
00:45:28,134 --> 00:45:32,463
- Pull the trigger, it'd be much faster.
- Ah, a sniper.

365
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,847
I'm kidding. It's too cowardly.
You guys have to call him out.

366
00:45:40,103 --> 00:45:42,310
Smart, Boss.

367
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:46,434
I've got it.

368
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:53,734
What we're gonna do is hire a fighter.
Stronger than Chan.

369
00:45:53,909 --> 00:45:58,238
Also, he's smaller.
Someone from overseas.

370
00:45:58,413 --> 00:46:02,459
Someone he doesn't know.
He'll be disgraced.

371
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:16,636
Come on, don't you know this signal?
It means: Take a hike, go away!

372
00:46:16,764 --> 00:46:18,673
Confusing.

373
00:46:28,234 --> 00:46:31,353
- Have you seen this girl?
- Yes.

374
00:46:31,695 --> 00:46:33,771
- That's Mary.
- Mary?

375
00:46:33,948 --> 00:46:37,483
- That's not Mary, that's Bunny.
- That's not Bunny...

376
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,911
I'll show you where she is.

377
00:46:41,081 --> 00:46:44,283
- Put your glasses on.
- She's got short hair.

378
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:48,586
- What did you say to me?
- I told you to put your glasses on.

379
00:46:48,753 --> 00:46:51,161
I have to go now.

380
00:47:13,195 --> 00:47:15,733
Oh, my gosh! What is he doing?

381
00:47:21,578 --> 00:47:26,405
This hadn't happened
if I'd shown him where Bunny lived.

382
00:47:33,923 --> 00:47:35,797
Albert?

383
00:47:37,302 --> 00:47:39,459
I'm such an angel.

384
00:47:44,976 --> 00:47:47,467
Yes? What do you want?

385
00:47:47,645 --> 00:47:51,346
- What the... Stop it!
- Where is she?

386
00:47:51,524 --> 00:47:54,644
- Let go of me!
- You better tell me.

387
00:47:54,819 --> 00:47:57,605
Where's my Bu?
What did you do with her?

388
00:48:01,866 --> 00:48:05,817
Where did you take her?
Bu and I are engaged.

389
00:48:43,366 --> 00:48:46,118
- What's this?
- Excuse me.

390
00:48:46,286 --> 00:48:50,994
This lady is so beautiful
she deserved some wind effect.

391
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:55,204
- You're gorgeous.
- I know.

392
00:49:05,721 --> 00:49:08,259
Do we drink it?

393
00:49:08,432 --> 00:49:10,887
Yes. It's a 1982.

394
00:49:15,523 --> 00:49:19,817
That's not all.
I can tell something else by tasting it.

395
00:49:20,778 --> 00:49:24,147
The grape picker was born in 1 960.

396
00:49:26,116 --> 00:49:28,192
Let's order.

397
00:49:30,829 --> 00:49:32,787
I'll do it.

398
00:49:33,957 --> 00:49:36,412
Do you make Chinese pot rice?

399
00:49:39,087 --> 00:49:43,380
- Just kidding.
- You had me worried.

400
00:49:46,095 --> 00:49:50,721
Do you always eat
with so many people watching you?

401
00:49:51,725 --> 00:49:54,050
Tell those guys they can leave now.

402
00:49:59,232 --> 00:50:01,687
Excuse me.

403
00:50:02,694 --> 00:50:07,273
- How come there's no one else eating?
- I bought the restaurant.

404
00:50:07,449 --> 00:50:12,869
Then I can't see any stars!
Without celebrities it's a bore.

405
00:50:13,037 --> 00:50:18,375
Why do you hate crowds? They're just
people. You really don't have friends?

406
00:50:23,255 --> 00:50:25,628
But I have enemies.

407
00:50:31,304 --> 00:50:37,141
Why did you dump my company's stock
and drive the price so low?

408
00:50:37,895 --> 00:50:42,438
I'm in the middle of dinner.
I'll call you later.

409
00:50:42,608 --> 00:50:47,649
Tell me why? I'm losing money,
and you're not doing too well, either.

410
00:50:47,821 --> 00:50:51,071
Please leave. The restaurant is closed.

411
00:50:51,241 --> 00:50:55,654
- Sir, you appear to be a smart guy.
- You might say that.

412
00:50:55,913 --> 00:51:00,455
You must have a lot of time.
Why not use it to save your company?

413
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:05,002
- And leave now, okay?
- Tell me who you are.

414
00:51:05,171 --> 00:51:09,085
I'm a guest,
and I'm appalled at your behaviour.

415
00:51:09,258 --> 00:51:13,755
We're trying to enjoy a dinner for two,
and you're disturbing our meal.

416
00:51:17,225 --> 00:51:21,388
- Let's talk.
- We talked already.

417
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,556
Outside.

418
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:32,150
When will you get it?
That sign means, "follow me"!

419
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:34,362
Confusing.

420
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:40,493
I like your attitude.

421
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:44,708
It's nothing.
Being around gangsters and all...

422
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,537
You have to go?

423
00:51:50,758 --> 00:51:54,376
Yes. I'll be right back. Excuse me.

424
00:52:06,481 --> 00:52:08,604
Be careful.

425
00:52:17,533 --> 00:52:19,572
Watch your back.

426
00:52:22,747 --> 00:52:26,994
I cleared it with your boss.
You can close up the parking lot, too.

427
00:52:27,168 --> 00:52:29,789
Then you guys can just take off.

428
00:52:29,962 --> 00:52:33,912
We'll have a little fun.
Don't worry, I'm footing the bill.

429
00:52:34,091 --> 00:52:36,546
You heard Mr Lo. Move out.

430
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:40,170
Mr Chan, have fun.

431
00:52:41,641 --> 00:52:44,178
Howie, what's going on here?

432
00:52:44,351 --> 00:52:49,392
I want you to meet someone.
I invited him from overseas.

433
00:52:49,564 --> 00:52:53,063
Ladies and gentlemen: Alan!

434
00:52:58,156 --> 00:53:02,533
Alan here is undefeated
in a very tough weight class.

435
00:53:02,702 --> 00:53:07,280
Alan will fight you, one on one,
on behalf of me.

436
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:12,492
Why don't I fight you?
We're not the same weight class.

437
00:53:12,671 --> 00:53:16,621
- I'd have to much of an edge.
- That's the point.

438
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,094
If you lose to a short guy,
it would be humiliating.

439
00:53:22,096 --> 00:53:24,801
Act like an adult.

440
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,682
You have no choice.

441
00:54:19,068 --> 00:54:23,197
- You're going to use gloves?
- Do you think he's a street fighter?

442
00:54:23,365 --> 00:54:27,611
- I don't want him dead.
- If he hits with a glove, it won't hurt.

443
00:54:27,786 --> 00:54:32,992
No? Have him hit you with a glove.
Tell me if it hurts.

444
00:54:41,757 --> 00:54:46,467
Try to knock me down any way you can.
But no dirty tricks.

445
00:54:48,931 --> 00:54:52,596
They say you're a great fighter...
Come on.

446
00:54:54,561 --> 00:54:58,606
They will not let you leave
without a fight.

447
00:55:04,197 --> 00:55:06,651
You asked for it.

448
00:55:06,823 --> 00:55:09,112
- Ready?
- Of course.

449
00:55:11,911 --> 00:55:15,826
- Alan is losing to him.
- No, he's just testing him.

450
00:55:15,999 --> 00:55:18,751
He wants to see how hard he can punch.

451
00:55:44,402 --> 00:55:50,487
- Why is he changing gloves?
- He's giving C.N. a little advantage.

452
00:55:50,659 --> 00:55:53,328
He knows his punches are too soft.

453
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:03,205
I've come a long way.
I don't want a short game.

454
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:10,460
Every boxer fights to their own music.
Provides the rhythm for their footwork.

455
00:56:10,636 --> 00:56:14,883
C.N. has no rhythm.
His footwork is a mess.

456
00:56:19,686 --> 00:56:23,815
- Look at Alan's controlled rhythm.
- You sound like an expert.

457
00:56:23,983 --> 00:56:26,022
Why don't you box?

458
00:56:26,193 --> 00:56:29,776
C.N. and I used to box,
but I always lost.

459
00:56:29,947 --> 00:56:32,947
I thought, I'd go into announcing.

460
00:56:33,116 --> 00:56:38,111
- You like that better than boxing?
- Yes. Talking, I sound invincible.

461
00:56:38,288 --> 00:56:42,333
In the ring, I'm like you...
Mostly useless.

462
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:53,336
C.N. used to have brilliant moves.
What happened?

463
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:59,883
He's concerned with other things,
like buying stocks. He'll lose.

464
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:33,214
C.N. seems like he's distracted.
That's why he's going down.

465
00:58:36,778 --> 00:58:39,982
Good hit... But not enough power.

466
00:59:39,507 --> 00:59:41,997
Are you okay?

467
00:59:42,175 --> 00:59:44,168
You win.

468
00:59:46,096 --> 00:59:51,091
- You deserve it. We win!
- While he's down, let's kick him.

469
00:59:51,268 --> 00:59:53,427
What do you say, Boss?

470
00:59:56,232 --> 01:00:00,940
How many times have I told you?
Real men fight fair, not like cowards.

471
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:05,440
Do you think there's honour
in kicking a man when he's down?

472
01:00:08,578 --> 01:00:10,653
You're good.

473
01:00:12,915 --> 01:00:15,073
Let's go.

474
01:00:20,379 --> 01:00:23,132
My job is done. He's good.

475
01:00:28,638 --> 01:00:33,513
Are you okay?
He didn't hurt you too bad, did he?

476
01:00:33,684 --> 01:00:36,768
You must be delighted that I lost.

477
01:00:36,896 --> 01:00:39,980
It might look like that, but I'm not.

478
01:00:43,862 --> 01:00:46,186
Do you need to call anyone?

479
01:00:49,367 --> 01:00:51,490
Forget it.

480
01:00:55,538 --> 01:00:58,291
Call me. Take care.

481
01:01:31,532 --> 01:01:35,282
- You didn't leave?
- You said that I should wait.

482
01:01:35,454 --> 01:01:37,944
I came down to look for you.

483
01:01:39,541 --> 01:01:45,993
- They used tricks and outnumbered you.
- No, it was one on one. I really lost.

484
01:01:47,256 --> 01:01:52,049
All right, so you lost.
You'll get used to it.

485
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:58,009
Just kidding. Train hard, then, when
you're ready, go back and beat them.

486
01:01:58,809 --> 01:02:02,854
I do have to train.
But not to beat up people.

487
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:09,399
- Why else would you train?
- For a strong body and a sharp mind.

488
01:02:10,571 --> 01:02:16,241
- I haven't trained in a long time.
- But your gym is huge! What a waste.

489
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:20,537
- Is it just for show?
- I just hate to train alone.

490
01:02:22,874 --> 01:02:26,161
Okay, I'll train with you then.

491
01:02:27,671 --> 01:02:32,380
- Why are you being so nice?
- Because you're rich.

492
01:02:33,426 --> 01:02:39,050
See how nice you look when you laugh.
Out there you looked so grumpy and sad.

493
01:02:40,016 --> 01:02:44,311
That's probably the reason you lost.
See? Nice laugh.

494
01:02:45,313 --> 01:02:49,891
You know, you don't need
make-up and fancy clothes.

495
01:02:52,404 --> 01:02:56,318
Can you take tomorrow off?...
Just say yes.

496
01:02:56,407 --> 01:02:59,527
- First tell me what we'll do.
- Just say yes.

497
01:02:59,702 --> 01:03:02,952
- Okay. What'll we do?
- Have fun.

498
01:05:52,246 --> 01:05:55,780
- Are we in love?
- Huh?

499
01:05:55,957 --> 01:06:01,794
- I think you're really nice.
- I'm in love, it's your turn to say it.

500
01:06:01,964 --> 01:06:05,629
I'm waiting for an answer.
Here's how it works.

501
01:06:05,801 --> 01:06:08,208
You can just tell me -

502
01:06:08,387 --> 01:06:11,553
- in four words... or less:

503
01:06:11,723 --> 01:06:14,843
I love you... I don't love you.

504
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:38,114
When did you get back? What is it now?

505
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:42,751
I'm confused. I think I'm in love.

506
01:06:42,962 --> 01:06:48,336
Love is just a state of mind.
More fantasy than truth.

507
01:06:48,509 --> 01:06:54,132
Love is like a radiant dream
that quickly turns into a nightmare.

508
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:59,181
Albert, you're such an inspiration.

509
01:07:01,314 --> 01:07:04,231
- I have news for you.
- What?

510
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:08,141
- Your boyfriend Louis is here.
- What?

511
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:12,862
He tried to strangle me. Fortunately,
I'm strong enough to fight him off.

512
01:07:13,032 --> 01:07:15,239
He's been drunk ever since.

513
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:21,330
- I think I really let him down.
- We're talking about love, not pity.

514
01:07:21,499 --> 01:07:24,999
The worse you are to him,
the better off he is.

515
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:29,831
Until you figure out your feelings
for Chan, don't let him see you.

516
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:38,388
Good morning, how about a Bloody Mary?

517
01:07:38,558 --> 01:07:41,131
- Let go of me.
- Where are you going?

518
01:07:41,311 --> 01:07:43,848
- To the kitchen.
- No! Wait.

519
01:07:48,191 --> 01:07:52,653
- I need, I need...
- What are you looking for?

520
01:07:52,823 --> 01:07:56,689
- A bottle-opener.
- I'll get you a glass.

521
01:07:58,161 --> 01:08:02,869
- Here, take two.
- How am I going to open it?

522
01:08:16,678 --> 01:08:22,182
- Bu, this is crazy.
- Okay, I'll tell C.N. the truth.

523
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:27,476
If you tell him now, you'll ruin it.
He'll move on to the next girl.

524
01:08:27,606 --> 01:08:31,686
You're wrong.
C.N. is not that kind of guy.

525
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:35,858
He took a day off to be with me.
It was a perfect day.

526
01:08:36,031 --> 01:08:42,068
When he's not around I miss him
day and night. I'm the only girl for him.

527
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:45,579
I love C.N. and I know he's in love, too.

528
01:08:45,749 --> 01:08:48,156
Sure sounds like love to me.

529
01:08:51,003 --> 01:08:53,958
- What is it?
- I want sake.

530
01:08:54,132 --> 01:08:58,793
- You haven't even finished your wine.
- No! I want sake, I want sake!

531
01:09:00,805 --> 01:09:03,047
Don't go away.

532
01:09:04,892 --> 01:09:07,763
Oh, excuse me. Thank you.

533
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:11,143
Here it is.

534
01:09:13,984 --> 01:09:20,153
- Do you want to sing with me?
- What do you think this is? Karaoke?

535
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:22,861
Let's drink our sake. Here's to Bu.

536
01:09:23,035 --> 01:09:27,364
- It's too much.
- You want more? Allow me.

537
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:34,245
- Here's to my health.
- Be careful, you'll get drunk.

538
01:09:37,549 --> 01:09:40,040
Well, bottoms up.

539
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,796
You need some sleep.

540
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:10,659
I've got her with me here.
She's all right.

541
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:16,662
Sure, you can talk to her.

542
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:33,976
- Gloria, this is Bu. Gloria's a friend.
- Oh, you're my new look-alike.

543
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:36,602
I can see it.

544
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:43,854
You knew it all along, didn't you?

545
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:49,403
- You lied.
- You started it.

546
01:10:51,871 --> 01:10:55,739
You loved me, so I loved you back.

547
01:10:55,917 --> 01:10:59,368
Was that a lie, too? Or was that real?

548
01:10:59,545 --> 01:11:05,915
Our happiness was real.
If you like Hong Kong, why not stay?

549
01:11:07,512 --> 01:11:12,387
So, why am I here?
So I can just be one of your girls?

550
01:11:17,146 --> 01:11:21,476
The note in the bottle said
to go to Hong Kong right away.

551
01:11:21,651 --> 01:11:25,814
I thought this fairy tale was real.

552
01:11:25,946 --> 01:11:28,485
You changed the ending.

553
01:11:39,585 --> 01:11:43,001
<i>C.N., you've got
some important information.<\i></i>

554
01:11:43,172 --> 01:11:47,299
<i>The government passed a law
prohibiting the use of styrofoam.<\i></i>

555
01:11:47,467 --> 01:11:52,343
<i>Howie Lo's stock
dropped dramatically. It's worthless.<\i></i>

556
01:11:53,975 --> 01:11:58,435
<i>All stockholders sell off their shares.
You knew the law would be passed.<\i></i>

557
01:11:58,604 --> 01:12:01,224
<i>Why didn't you inform us?<\i></i>

558
01:12:01,397 --> 01:12:06,439
<i>- It was just a matter of time.
- The project waits for your decision.<\i></i>

559
01:12:06,611 --> 01:12:08,899
That'll be all.

560
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:35,589
- What's wrong?
- I'm okay.

561
01:12:51,322 --> 01:12:53,278
What?

562
01:12:56,618 --> 01:12:59,026
It's for you.

563
01:13:29,942 --> 01:13:33,892
"Nothing can change a man like love.

564
01:13:34,947 --> 01:13:39,159
For he's going nowhere.
And yet, so far."

565
01:13:41,246 --> 01:13:46,488
- Meaning what?
- Going nowhere, and yet, so far.

566
01:13:47,251 --> 01:13:51,912
- Yes, I heard you. It means?
- I don't know.

567
01:13:53,758 --> 01:13:58,254
I've been with you so long,
and I never saw you like this.

568
01:13:58,429 --> 01:14:03,007
Garbage tossed about.
Try moving forward.

569
01:14:03,142 --> 01:14:06,593
- Leave me alone.
- Move on.

570
01:14:06,729 --> 01:14:09,017
- Beat it.
- Be strong.

571
01:14:09,189 --> 01:14:11,432
I don't want to listen to you anymore.

572
01:14:13,402 --> 01:14:18,277
Fine, I can take a hint.
You don't have to tell me twice.

573
01:14:19,908 --> 01:14:23,656
- How did you get in here?
- We broke in.

574
01:14:23,829 --> 01:14:25,785
Call the police.

575
01:14:25,955 --> 01:14:30,250
- I don't think they'll let me call.
- I bet they will.

576
01:14:36,967 --> 01:14:40,169
- I told you so.
- You guys beat it.

577
01:14:40,344 --> 01:14:43,594
You ruined our boss's life.
We lost our jobs.

578
01:14:43,764 --> 01:14:45,888
You're the reason why!

579
01:14:47,602 --> 01:14:52,477
Mister Chan...
I heard you're back in training.

580
01:14:52,648 --> 01:14:56,515
- Yes, but not because of you.
- Rematch?

581
01:14:56,694 --> 01:15:01,652
- Mr Lo sent you here?
- Mr Lo's broke. It's not about money.

582
01:15:02,534 --> 01:15:06,068
- Not now.
- You've got no choice.

583
01:15:10,082 --> 01:15:15,206
- You really enjoy fighting, don't you?
- Only with the best.

584
01:15:22,011 --> 01:15:28,013
- Here we go again. I hate this part.
- You don't know much about boxing, huh?

585
01:15:28,183 --> 01:15:31,053
Do you know why they do this?

586
01:15:34,731 --> 01:15:36,640
Okay.

587
01:15:41,697 --> 01:15:44,234
- Rules?
- No rules.

588
01:15:45,617 --> 01:15:49,364
Anything goes. But no dirty tricks.

589
01:15:58,129 --> 01:16:00,205
You like white.

590
01:16:09,806 --> 01:16:13,390
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

591
01:17:35,307 --> 01:17:37,348
Good training.

592
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,444
Wait, wait...

593
01:18:54,092 --> 01:18:56,168
What is it?

594
01:18:56,345 --> 01:19:00,971
- Can I ask him if he's okay?
- If you insist.

595
01:19:01,141 --> 01:19:03,348
Are you okay?

596
01:19:04,311 --> 01:19:06,220
Okay. He's okay.

597
01:19:23,955 --> 01:19:25,948
Pretty good.

598
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:11,425
<i>'"Just smile."<\i></i>

599
01:21:19,025 --> 01:21:23,106
<i>See how nice you look when you laugh.
You looked so grumpy and sad.<\i></i>

600
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:28,274
<i>That's probably the reason you lost.
See? Nice laugh.<\i></i>

601
01:21:48,846 --> 01:21:50,923
Are you ready?

602
01:23:14,263 --> 01:23:16,385
Don't worry, be happy.

603
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:53,710
Let's dance.

604
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,483
Hey, come on! Get up!

605
01:25:38,654 --> 01:25:41,774
Sir, are you all right? Up, up, up!

606
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:49,028
Sir, are you hurt bad?

607
01:25:58,507 --> 01:26:02,457
- I'm okay.
- You did it. You won!

608
01:26:02,636 --> 01:26:05,127
- I lost.
- Why?

609
01:26:05,305 --> 01:26:09,718
If we were in the same weight class,
he would have won easily.

610
01:26:09,893 --> 01:26:12,099
See if he's all right.

611
01:26:13,521 --> 01:26:18,433
- Why do you smell like gas?
- Boss is setting fire to the factory.

612
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:20,187
That's excellent.

613
01:26:20,737 --> 01:26:23,940
We'll be arrested for arson,
if we're here.

614
01:26:24,824 --> 01:26:29,236
- This is dangerous. Be careful, Boss.
- It's okay.

615
01:26:29,411 --> 01:26:34,038
If I get caught,
I'm going to jail for sure.

616
01:26:37,253 --> 01:26:41,961
- You made sure everyone's out?
- They're all gone.

617
01:26:42,132 --> 01:26:47,756
Deliver this to my father.
Tell him I love him a whole lot.

618
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:53,269
Give this one to C.N.
Tell him I hate him a whole lot.

619
01:26:53,936 --> 01:26:59,143
Give this one to the authorities.
It blames the fire on me.

620
01:26:59,316 --> 01:27:02,732
Really? You're going to jail, not me?

621
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:10,951
I'm not going to jail, either.
Stand aside.

622
01:27:11,662 --> 01:27:16,370
- I'll burn your factory to the ground!
- Don't do it, Boss!

623
01:27:16,541 --> 01:27:21,333
I burned my eyes.
I'll die anyway.

624
01:27:21,922 --> 01:27:26,833
So what if I can't see?
I love you, Mary!!

625
01:27:30,722 --> 01:27:36,511
- Howie, what are you doing here?
- C.N. It's all your fault.

626
01:27:36,686 --> 01:27:39,972
You took it too far. My father
kicked me off the board of directors.

627
01:27:40,148 --> 01:27:45,059
I have nothing now. Nothing!

628
01:27:45,111 --> 01:27:49,524
- What about us?
- What'll we do without you?

629
01:27:50,991 --> 01:27:52,984
Shut up!

630
01:27:57,332 --> 01:28:00,036
- Warmer?
- Yes.

631
01:28:00,209 --> 01:28:03,329
- Okay?
- That's good.

632
01:28:03,504 --> 01:28:06,789
Are you still blind?

633
01:28:06,966 --> 01:28:11,177
You're a good man.
Better than I was.

634
01:28:11,345 --> 01:28:16,636
Styrofoam is bad for the environment.
That's why I wanted to shut you down.

635
01:28:16,809 --> 01:28:21,269
But we can still be partners.
We can team up together.

636
01:28:21,438 --> 01:28:25,435
We can open up a recycling centre.

637
01:28:25,608 --> 01:28:28,230
How come you're doing this?

638
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:31,773
When we were in school together,
you had to get higher grades.

639
01:28:31,949 --> 01:28:37,868
You were always more athletic.
You had to have every girl I liked.

640
01:28:38,037 --> 01:28:42,699
As soon as you saw them once,
you never saw them again. I hated you.

641
01:28:43,042 --> 01:28:46,209
- I hated you.
- What for?

642
01:28:46,379 --> 01:28:50,673
For laughing.
For being born so wealthy.

643
01:28:50,842 --> 01:28:55,799
It was all given to you.
I had to work for everything I ever had.

644
01:28:55,971 --> 01:29:00,218
What I really hated was that
you stole the love of my life, Carol.

645
01:29:00,392 --> 01:29:04,224
That was in second grade! Carol?!

646
01:29:07,775 --> 01:29:11,440
I heard she married a guy,
what was his name...

647
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:14,862
- Oh, Bob. No... Fred.
- Fred!

648
01:29:15,699 --> 01:29:19,199
A major moron. He was so dumb.

649
01:29:23,875 --> 01:29:28,370
After so many years,
neither one of us has found a girl -

650
01:29:28,545 --> 01:29:30,871
- we really truly loved.

651
01:29:31,048 --> 01:29:35,176
- You said before: "l love Mary."
- You're crazy.

652
01:29:35,344 --> 01:29:41,513
Hold on a minute. You were engaged.
What happened to her?

653
01:29:41,683 --> 01:29:44,601
Don't bring it up. I got cold feet.

654
01:29:46,771 --> 01:29:51,646
But Mary was a great girl.
We laughed a lot.

655
01:29:51,817 --> 01:29:55,862
All day long.
You should hear her laugh.

656
01:29:56,030 --> 01:29:58,782
It was great.

657
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:02,699
I wish I could turn back the clock.

658
01:30:02,871 --> 01:30:06,950
She moved away
when I broke off the engagement.

659
01:30:07,125 --> 01:30:11,252
I don't know where she went.
I never found her.

660
01:30:12,838 --> 01:30:15,460
What's wrong with you?

661
01:30:16,634 --> 01:30:22,637
- I'm gonna find her.
- Who? Mary? You never even met her!

662
01:30:53,629 --> 01:30:56,249
Hey, Bu, I missed you.

663
01:30:58,008 --> 01:31:00,213
How are you doing?

664
01:31:03,846 --> 01:31:07,382
What? Come back! Bu!

665
01:31:37,504 --> 01:31:39,711
<i>'"l miss you. C.N."<\i></i>

666
01:31:39,882 --> 01:31:42,005
<i>What do you want?<\i></i>

667
01:31:46,930 --> 01:31:49,635
Go, you're not wanted here.

668
01:31:49,808 --> 01:31:52,679
- You hurt Bu.
- No, I didn't.

669
01:31:52,853 --> 01:31:57,811
She used to laugh. Now she's always sad
because of you. You took her grin away.

670
01:31:57,983 --> 01:32:02,859
Now I'm sad, too.
That's not good. You've got trouble.

671
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:07,323
- What did you do to her?
- I didn't do anything to her.

672
01:32:07,492 --> 01:32:10,826
Then why is she like this now?
Leave her alone.

673
01:32:10,996 --> 01:32:15,575
- Go home or I'll beat your brains out!
- Take it easy, please.

674
01:32:15,751 --> 01:32:18,705
You heard him. Get out of here!

675
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:28,501
I warned you. Watch it!

676
01:32:44,195 --> 01:32:46,732
It'll be okay.

677
01:33:12,139 --> 01:33:15,673
I'll sit right here.
Just try to get past, jerk.

678
01:33:15,809 --> 01:33:18,893
Check out your dad. He's The King.

679
01:33:21,105 --> 01:33:23,893
Are you okay, sir? Let me help you up.

680
01:33:26,736 --> 01:33:31,196
- Is your back hurt badly?
- She doesn't want to talk to you.

681
01:33:31,366 --> 01:33:34,817
- Let me talk to her, please.
- What would you say?

682
01:33:35,119 --> 01:33:37,610
- Bu, listen, l...
- Stop it!

683
01:33:40,958 --> 01:33:43,331
- Bu.
- Shut up!

684
01:33:44,129 --> 01:33:46,798
- Bu.
- I said: "shut up!"

685
01:33:46,964 --> 01:33:48,708
Bu.

686
01:33:49,550 --> 01:33:55,386
- I guess you just don't listen.
- You can kill me or let me talk to her.

687
01:33:58,935 --> 01:34:03,015
All right. You want to talk?
Come with me.

688
01:34:08,235 --> 01:34:12,067
It's now or never.
Well... Talk!

689
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:17,316
- Let's go. Don't bother them.
- I want to hear what he says to her.

690
01:34:22,415 --> 01:34:24,871
Why come here?

691
01:34:27,754 --> 01:34:33,210
- You left your clothes at my house.
- I have a lot more.

692
01:34:38,473 --> 01:34:44,096
I know you like Chinese pot rice.
It got cold. You can just nuke it.

693
01:34:47,565 --> 01:34:52,227
You think old clothes and pot rice
will fix things?

694
01:34:54,697 --> 01:34:56,855
That's not all.

695
01:35:06,083 --> 01:35:10,911
- I've written a note in each bottle.
- Really? What did you write?

696
01:35:11,089 --> 01:35:15,418
I love you. I miss you.
All in four words or less.

697
01:35:15,593 --> 01:35:18,297
And I got writer's cramp.

698
01:35:19,221 --> 01:35:21,260
Why all the fuss?

699
01:35:21,431 --> 01:35:26,770
If you just stick a thousand dollars
in each one, you'd get my attention.

700
01:35:37,155 --> 01:35:40,358
Say out loud that you love me.

701
01:35:41,034 --> 01:35:45,495
- Okay. I love you.
- When did you start?

702
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:48,664
When you went through my wallet.

703
01:35:50,001 --> 01:35:54,663
That night on the boat when we saw
the star. What did you wish for?

704
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,082
It just came true.

705
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:03,963
What are you crying about?

706
01:36:04,849 --> 01:36:08,929
- Leave them be.
- Hey, Don Juan! Kiss her!

707
01:36:10,772 --> 01:36:15,232
Don't just stand there wearing white.
Kiss her!

708
01:36:17,820 --> 01:36:19,860
It's okay.

709
01:36:21,323 --> 01:36:23,862
Look over there.

710
01:36:34,962 --> 01:36:37,879
Are all the girls here so beautiful?

711
01:36:38,048 --> 01:36:42,295
Don't say it! I'll introduce you
to a friend. He lives over here.

712
01:36:42,469 --> 01:36:44,461
Where?
