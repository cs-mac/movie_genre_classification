00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,568
RECEPTIONIST: <i>Good morning.
Dynamic Progressive Systems.</i>

3
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,727
<i>Please hold.</i>

4
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,121
It's not a small thing.
5% is a lot.

5
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,442
If you've managed a household
with kids and stuff... 5% is a lot.

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,130
You know what, Dan?
Just walk with me.

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,964
No. I don't care
if everyone hears us.

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,724
You really wanna do this here?
You do?

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,961
I don't wanna be doing
it at all, Chuck.

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,964
It's just that we had terms, and now
you're changing those terms again.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,009
We are restructuring
the department salaries.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,810
That's just the bottom line.
That's the way it is.

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,803
I know it's not
what you want to hear.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,566
Dan, just walk with me.

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,688
A little annoying. What?

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,046
It's just a little annoying.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,009
"Walk with me." You
say that a lot.

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,810
It's stuff like that you
say, you know.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,240
That's why Brian Peters
wrote "You're an asshole"

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,481
on your parking curb thing.

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,481
What the fuck, Dan?

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,321
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,164
Do you really wanna challenge
me in public, Dan?

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,084
This was my best year.

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,129
I am an asshole, Dan,
because I have to make

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,043
decisions to keep
the company strong.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,967
You make a living
from this company.

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,326
You're replaceable, frankly.

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,081
If you were to leave,
Dynamic would continue.

30
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,010
So, don't minimize
my company's interests.

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,845
Now, if you would please,
as I said before, walk with me.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,286
We can discuss
this in my office.

33
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,090
Chuck, just because you
caught me...

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,521
which is, granted,
a pretty big feat...

35
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,284
in a trust fall
at the company retreat...

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,520
which you make us all go to...

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,080
and that I don't like, by the way,
that nobody here really likes.

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,280
Nobody does. Right, Russell?

39
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,361
I like them. Russell
is a team player.

40
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,204
DAN: Russell
is a beaten-down dog.

41
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,407
You're Mr. Negative.

42
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,286
Are you making less?

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,528
I'm a sales manager, Dan.

44
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,449
You want a bigger slice of the pie,
start your own company.

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,641
Oh, I've been thinking about it.

46
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,920
Everybody thinks about it...

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,371
but don't bitch when the people
who actually do it...

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,607
pay themselves
what they deserve.

49
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,128
I have been in airports for two days,
preparing a deal for you.

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,487
I came in here just
to get a bagel,

51
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,722
because I haven't had
a meal since Tuesday.

52
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,770
And then, you tell me I'm gonna
have to take 5% less this year?

53
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,410
I don't want new terms, Chuck.

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,244
I want to be able to see
my kids sometimes.

55
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,640
The old "kid" card.

56
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,801
(LAUGHS)
Strong.

57
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,243
I'm gonna do it.

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,565
Really?

59
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,087
You're gonna go
up against me and Dynamic?

60
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,086
Yeah. I will see you in the field.
You should look for me.

61
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,569
Because I'll be the guy
in first who's happy.

62
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,840
I think you're better off for me
than against me, Dan.

63
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,926
Well, I actually have my own ideas
on how to do this job.

64
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,402
It doesn't involve
any of that "trust fall" shit.

65
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,807
Okay. Game on.

66
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,844
Game on.

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,480
By the way, anyone
here wanna join me?

68
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,284
There's a lot
of great people here.

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,481
How about it?
Come on.

70
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,449
Any of you guys wanna build
a total starship with me?

71
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,284
"Starship"?

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, I'm just riffing, here.

73
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,765
I wasn't planning on founding
my own company here today...

74
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,331
but if anyone wants
to play a key role...

75
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,609
in a new mineral sales company
that does it the right way...

76
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,841
then walk through that door
with me,

77
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,291
because there
is a place for you.

78
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,205
Guys!

79
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,681
Men!

80
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,166
We're doing this.

81
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,287
Doing what?

82
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,360
Boarding the starship. Starting
this new adventure together.

83
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,881
Uh, I'm just walking to my car.

84
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,361
Because I just got let go...

85
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,965
because of some mandatory
age limit.

86
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,687
Oh.

87
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,051
Do you still wanna work?

88
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,362
Well, I'm just 67. Yeah!

89
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,806
I'm not the Crypt Keeper.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,321
All right, great!
Come work with me.

91
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,164
We'll drop these guys. Yeah!

92
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,887
Let's drop these pussies!

93
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,441
Right!

94
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,647
Look at us. We're standing here.

95
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,846
We're synergizing already.

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,002
I'm excited. Thank you.

97
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,165
How about you, young buck, huh?

98
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,322
Are you starshipping with us?
Yeah.

99
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,045
What did you do at Dynamic?

100
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,487
Uh... Um... No.
I don't work there.

101
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,801
You just walked out of there.

102
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,689
Well, I interviewed.

103
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,410
But you got a box
with office belongings.

104
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,485
Yeah. I brought it to the interview
to show confidence.

105
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,525
Do you have any sales
experience?

106
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,205
Yes, I do.

107
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,930
Great. Foot Locker.

108
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,651
And reasons for leaving?

109
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,165
I don't like feet.

110
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,685
But I do like people.

111
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,201
I'm good with people.
It's for real, it's true.

112
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,609
Do you work hard? Yeah.

113
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,721
Like, what's "hard"?

114
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,371
(STAMMERING)
The hardest.

115
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,204
Don't just say it because you
think I want to hear it.

116
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,727
No, it's true.
Whatever you need.

117
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,886
All right.

118
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,164
If you're willing to try,
I'll turn you into an animal.

119
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,561
Hop in. Come on, young
buck, we're doing it.

120
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,688
I'm willing!
Let's go.

121
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,001
All right.

122
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,561
Let's hit Dunkin' Donuts,
and we'll launch this thing.

123
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,921
Good.

124
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,964
<i>I know we've had
a little dry spell...</i>

125
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,964
but I'm proud to announce
that we got this deal.

126
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,640
Bill said, "Fly up,
let's shake hands."

127
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,000
Fuck, yes!

128
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,081
(LAUGHING)

129
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,647
Oh, excuse me.

130
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,485
I'm sorry about the "fuck."

131
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,926
I get to go on a trip?

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,047
Yeah.

133
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,964
Overnight?

134
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,281
Is this your first
business trip, Mike?

135
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,441
Yeah.

136
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,921
You didn't have any Foot
Locker business trips?

137
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,770
No. They would all just
come to me.

138
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,810
Yeah. All right, we're
going on a trip.

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,163
Will things happen?

140
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,163
Like, explers?

141
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,444
"Explers"? Yeah.

142
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,443
Can you use it in a sentence?

143
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,969
"We're gonna go on a business
trip and have explers."

144
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,327
"Exploits"?

145
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,925
Exploits.

146
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,650
No, there won't be any exploits.
Just up and back.

147
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,484
I got too much stuff at home.

148
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,483
You can have them,
after we close the deal.

149
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,124
Is it just us going up there,
or are they bringing up a fluffer?

150
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,130
Just us, free and clear.
What's a "fluffer"?

151
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,768
When a company wants
to do a sweetheart deal

152
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,604
with a friend or something...

153
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,525
they generally
pretend to negotiate

154
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,120
with another company,
right to the end.

155
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,486
Just to make it look legit.

156
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,971
Well, this one's all ours.

157
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,201
Come on.

158
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,125
Tomorrow, we are going
on a business trip.

159
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,320
Let's go close this thing.

160
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,521
Go get them, Dan.

161
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,206
I feel good about this one.
You got a strong number set.

162
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,646
I appreciate that, Don.

163
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,450
You've been here
since the beginning.

164
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,720
After we close this, we're
gonna get an actual office.

165
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,009
Hey, Paul we need to talk.

166
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,526
I'm headed off to Portland.

167
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,247
Oh, I'm sorry.

168
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,164
I didn't mean to surprise you.
Everything all right?

169
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,408
I'm doing stuff. That's cool.

170
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,369
Lookit, "doing
stuff" is natural.

171
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,409
Dad... I used to "do stuff."

172
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,484
I used to "do stuff" three times a day.
And I still "do stuff."

173
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,722
(SOFTLY)
Dad. I don't "do stuff" as much as I used to...

174
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,801
(LAUGHS)

175
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,083
because now I'm tired
from doing other stuff.

176
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,651
But there's no crime, here.

177
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,002
There's not gonna be a trial.
Nothing happened.

178
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,920
I don't even know
what we were talking about.

179
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,001
When I was your age...

180
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,208
we used to get these
magazines for my sisters...

181
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,885
that would be like a lingerie
or swimsuit...

182
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,007
No, that's not...

183
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,686
But now you go online, you
see a clown fuck an alpaca.

184
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,887
I don't watch that, Dad.

185
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,247
It's not a big deal.
It's just an easy thing.

186
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,327
I want you to get
back to doing it,

187
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,487
but you should do it
in the bathroom...

188
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,840
because you can't
lock this door.

189
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,450
And your sister could
walk in and it's no good.

190
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,090
So, just do it
somewhere else, okay?

191
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,044
Yeah. Just keep a lid on it.

192
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,562
Like a gentleman does. A
gentleman celebrates his body.

193
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,927
You know that Walt Whitman
poem, "Song of Myself"?

194
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,640
We don't need to talk
about it anymore.

195
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,887
It's a song. Walt Whitman,
he celebrates his body.

196
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,730
You're celebrating your body.

197
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,450
So, I don't think
it's a big deal.

198
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,241
Okay.

199
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,402
I'm gonna be back tomorrow. I'm
just going up for the handshake.

200
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,925
And when I come home...

201
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,923
you are gonna come out of this
room for a little bit...

202
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,560
and me and you, just me
and you, we're gonna hang out.

203
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,205
Okay, you're hugging me.

204
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,361
I don't know what's going
on with your hands.

205
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,726
Get back to the computer.

206
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,644
Bye, Dad. Bye.

207
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,601
(SIGHS)

208
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,642
Can we deal with the whole
private school thing today?

209
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,161
Do you mean,
like the pros and cons?

210
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,288
No, we did the pros and cons.
It was all pros.

211
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,283
I meant paying for it.

212
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,680
You know I'm leaving, right?
Portland, for the handshake.

213
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,290
I have 20 minutes to pack.

214
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,807
Yeah. Remember we were gonna
talk to Paul today, though...

215
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,088
about why he's been so
withdrawn.

216
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,366
Can we FaceTime that?

217
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,641
Can it be today?

218
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,290
Yeah. This is the big one.

219
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,925
When are you back?
Tomorrow, before dinner.

220
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,809
We just gotta go there and shake hands.
It's all done.

221
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,121
What do you got going today?

222
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,481
I was probably going
to go to work,

223
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,130
and then maybe raise
our children.

224
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,810
Sounds good. Wait, eat!

225
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,008
I have to put these reports
in my power spread.

226
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,931
Men over 40 can suffer from fainting
spells if they skip meals...

227
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,168
and have high stress levels,
and poor muscle tone.

228
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,121
I have to pack.

229
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,328
Hey, Dad. Hey.

230
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,130
Are you going on a trip?

231
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,486
I am, yeah.

232
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,801
You wanna help me out, here?

233
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,644
I'll show you what I always
bring with me.

234
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,650
Space for my running gear here.
Book goes here.

235
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,167
That's all you do
on your business trips?

236
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,890
Read and run? Yep.

237
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,007
And do business.

238
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,400
Grab some running gear
out of the closet and help me pack.

239
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,005
Okay. Love you.

240
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,808
Can I ask you a question
before you go?

241
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,121
Honey, my plane's gonna...

242
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,646
Is it a little question?

243
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,366
Kind of.

244
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,689
Okay, yeah. What
is your little question?

245
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,208
When I go to school, I don't
like to go to school at all.

246
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,650
It makes my stomach hurt.
The jokes hurt my feelings.

247
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,041
I cry in the bathroom,
and pretend to poop for...

248
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,850
I don't know, two hours.

249
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,490
That's not even...

250
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,880
Is that a question?

251
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,844
Okay. I know that school
can be hard, honey.

252
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,002
But you gotta go,
or you'll be a moron.

253
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,009
Did you do my daddy
homework thing?

254
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,764
Yes, I have not.

255
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,285
But I'm tweaking it in my mind,

256
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,124
and I will figure
it out on my trip.

257
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,001
DAN: <i>Okay, I have two seconds, here.
"Your daddy."</i>

258
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,400
<i>Why is this so hard?</i>

259
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,085
<i>"Your daddy is..."</i>

260
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,282
<i>I pretty much just work
these days, sorry.</i>

261
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,401
<i>Selling swarf.</i>

262
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,685
<i>That's metal residue left
over after the construction of large objects...</i>

263
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,205
<i>like the Golden Gate...</i>

264
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,724
<i>Never mind, it's fucking boring.</i>

265
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,685
<i>Anyway, Daddy's been working to get
the starship off the ground.</i>

266
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,880
<i>That's from a team-building thing.
Our version.</i>

267
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,246
<i>We went to the batting cages.</i>

268
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,401
<i>I thought it was a good place...</i>

269
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,080
<i>to teach the guys about being
aggressive and taking what's yours.</i>

270
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,528
<i>Crowding the plate,
in a business sense.</i>

271
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,722
<i>But we nailed a big deal,
and we're travelling today...</i>

272
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,600
<i>in the time-honored
ritual of the handshake.</i>

273
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,641
<i>Which is good,
because it's been a down year, swarf-wise.</i>

274
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,881
<i>I really need this deal.</i>

275
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,963
<i>I'm stalling like a freak
on this private school thing...</i>

276
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,646
<i>because I can't afford it
without this handshake.</i>

277
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,450
<i>And I don't want
your mom to know.</i>

278
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,410
<i>But she's gonna catch me soon
because she's smarter than I am.</i>

279
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,607
<i>Probably, that's not
what you're looking for.</i>

280
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,240
Why do males go
on a business trip?

281
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,483
To bring home the kill,
and dig the night.

282
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,802
Going to Portland,
Timothy, not Vegas.

283
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,604
And aren't you 72?

284
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,605
I'm 67.

285
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,121
What do you mean,
"bring home the kill"?

286
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,282
Traditionally, even way back...

287
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,967
guys would leave their caves
with a pointy stick or something.

288
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,283
Go out, get it done,
bring it home.

289
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,846
And the, "dig the night" part?

290
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,651
Well, then they'd stay on a little longer
than they needed to...

291
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,167
and fuck around a little bit.

292
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,281
Traditionally.

293
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,602
Holy shit. "Trunkman, Daniel."

294
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,683
I'm next on the upgrade
list, boys.

295
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,650
I've flown 31 times this last
year making this goddamn deal.

296
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,121
Never once have they ever
said, "Daniel Trunkman."

297
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,011
Say "Daniel Trunkman." Come on.

298
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,525
Say it.

299
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,161
Danielle Trunkman.

300
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,051
- Yes!
- WOMAN: Hi.

301
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,009
DAN: It's "Daniel,"
not "Danielle."

302
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,081
- (WOMAN LAUGHS)
- DAN: Thank you very much.

303
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,248
I'm gonna go obviously
to the front.

304
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,440
You guys go around the back.

305
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,720
Please. Thank you, sir.

306
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,325
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: <i>Ladies
and gentlemen, welcome on board.</i>

307
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,528
<i>US Midland Airlines
Flight 3257...</i>

308
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,330
<i>with service to Portland, Maine.</i>

309
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,806
<i>In preparation for takeoff...</i>

310
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,241
<i>all carry-on items should be
placed in the overhead bins...</i>

311
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,731
<i>or under the seat
in front of you.</i>

312
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,211
I've never been upgraded.

313
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,164
That's all right.

314
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,121

my seat, like this guy did.

317
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,080
But I, uh...

318
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,210
I can't honor you on this
flight, because I have to...

319
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,045
finish some important
presentation prep...

320
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,682
on some cap-down brokerage recaps
that just need some tweaking.

321
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,686
But I appreciate you.

322
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,403
Thank you. It is an honor
to sit in front of you.

323
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,925
So much.

324
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,245

Mike, can I say
something to you?

327
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,241
Can you not say your whole
name today, sorry, um...

328
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,562
when we meet
the Benjaminson Group?

329
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,960
Why?

330
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,291
Because, um...

331
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,930
I'm just going to be
honest with you.

332
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,366
I think that when you
say your whole name,

333
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,761
it causes people
to lose focus on...

334
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,410
pertinent business stuff.

335
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,927
Why would my name
cause people to

336
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,446
lose focus on pertinent
business stuff?

337
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,650
Say it.

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,805
who I think you know, don't you?

475
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,325
I do. Yeah. We are competitors.

476
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,845
We are? Direct.

477
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,162
I guess. I hadn't really
noticed, but, okay.

478
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,163
Hmm. And this is Jim Spinch.

479
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,606
Jim. Hey, Dan.

480
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,000
How are you?
Good, you?

481
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,650
Sorry. Sure.

482
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,006
Jim's my boss.

483
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,684
Who makes your gear?
What kind of...?

484
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,922
What's the get-up?

485
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,605
Uh, Danish top. Okay.

486
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,368
And the sweats are a riff on,
I think, South American field slacks.

487
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,011
Um...

488
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,442
"Machos," they're called.
Or "Machetes."

489
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,444
My wife has "Machos." Or
"Machetes," I don't know.

490
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,886
I just call them
"Nancy's pants."

491
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,681
Chuck just showed us...

492
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,848
your redbook rates only make
sense if we're doing buybacks.

493
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,731
I'm not doing buyback deals
until it's out the door and we refactor market.

494
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,689
I just wanna be clear
that those are the terms now.

495
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,046
So, Jim, you're opening
the deal back up?

496
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,884
Well, it wasn't
closed quite, Dan.

497
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,691
So, I just wanted to hear you
both under these new terms today.

498
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,040
Just you and Chuck, that's all.

499
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,161
Those pants are so tight,

500
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,571
you'd think I could see
your balls or your dick.

501
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,721
But I don't.

502
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,565
Maybe I shouldn't have
said that, but it's weird.

503
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,961
So, are we going back
to our original brokerage sets?

504
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,201
In fact, is that a crease?

505
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,805
No. I don't have
a crease, thank you.

506
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,246
A slit? No.

507
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,243
- CHUCK: There's space.
- DAN: There is no space.

508
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,561
There's actually space.
It's alarming.

509
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,920
DAN: There's clearly no space.

510
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,088
I'm trying to determine the...

511
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,881
Jim. Are we going to start
at our first rate presentation?

512
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,566
I'm giving you both a clean start.
That's it, yeah.

513
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,082
And you guys know each other?
You and Chuck?

514
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,006
Yeah, we've done
a couple of deals.

515
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,844
And you came together today?

516
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,921
Almost.

517
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,650
I came, then Jim
came on my face.

518
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,051
But thanks for asking, Dan.

519
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,081
Wow.

520
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,931
How wonderfully brassy. Are
you guys coming inside?

521
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,880
I already came inside of Jim,
but thank you for asking.

522
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,451
Jeez, guy.

523
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,760
We're going to eat in here.

524
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,281
Wow.

525
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,529
Chuck, what are you doing?

526
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,127
Here?
Now? Chuck?

527
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,691
Well, did you guys
shake hands already...

528
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,803
or was I misled
about the deal being done?

529
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,930
I am here to shake hands.

530
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,001
Oh.

531
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,646
So am I.

532
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,327
(WHISTLING)

533
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,803
I hope it's clear that while there
are higher upfront costs...

534
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,644
than possibly you
are used to or prefer...

535
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,600
these are one-offs
and, over time...

536
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,766
DAN: Fuck!

537
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,921
Whoa. You all right?

538
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,606
No. I'm good, I'm good.
I just...

539
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,570
I just had a stressful
afternoon...

540
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,449
and no granola.

541
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,090
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

542
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,960
What was the last thing I said?

543
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,041
Uh, "Fuck."

544
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,681
DAN: No. Right before.

545
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,960
Oh, you were talking about having
extremely high upfront costs built in.

546
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,964
I said "extremely"?
You said "extremely."

547
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,326
I'm going to have to call
you out on that, Jim.

548
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,842
I didn't say "extremely"
because I wouldn't characterize our...

549
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,527
My legs feel a little bit
like, uh, Slinkys.

550
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,641
Fuck.

551
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,767
I said that again.

552
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,365
I'm going to sit down. Sit down.

553
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,204
Yeah. Okay.

554
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,282
Mike, finish.

555
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,201
Sorry.

556
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,441
Hello.

557
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,048
Um, I'm Mineral Deposits Sales
Director at Apex Select, Mike Pancake.

558
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,161
What was your last name?

559
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,487
Pancake.

560
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,801
Like, breakfast?

561
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,721
It's Greek, so...

562
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,961
It's delicious.

563
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,360
Yum.

564
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,481
(LAUGHING)

565
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,531
Are you Steve Toast?

566
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,520
(LAUGHING)

567
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,488
I know this deal is getting close
to the finish line for you...

568
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,324
but when the mineral market
bottomed out in Greece,

569
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,440
it took us all by surprise.

570
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,244
We gotta go back and look
at our whole fourth quarter.

571
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,402
And Chuck and Dynamic, they brought
up some interesting points...

572
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,200
about how they could
help us fourth quarter.

573
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,803
We weren't, you and us, quite
at the handshake stage.

574
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,049
Well, we'll just have
to disagree on that.

575
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,846
Maybe we didn't totally shake.

576
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,241
We definitely grasped
one another's hands.

577
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,289
Now, maybe we didn't
do that small

578
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,249
pump-up-and-down thing
to finish it off.

579
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,447
No, we didn't.

580
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,927
I'm here. Let's pump, Jim.

581
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,001
All right. Hold on, Dan.

582
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,000
What are you talking...?
It's been a year, Jim.

583
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,566
(SIGHS)

584
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
All right, Dan, look.
Here's what we're going to do.

585
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,522
DAN: Chuck's presenting
to Dirk Austerlitz in Berlin.

586
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,446
So are we.

587
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,840
Jim said it wasn't necessary,

588
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,046
but I insisted.

589
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,730
So, gear up.

590
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,609
We have to go right
there tomorrow.

591
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,444
I thought we were done.

592
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,080
Yeah.

593
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,088
I've never made love to a woman.

594
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,366
I made love to my wife,
but I don't love her.

595
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,765
She's cruel.

596
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,564
Didn't you just
order a sex maid?

597
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,042
Oh, yes, but I don't cheat.
I just observe.

598
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,243
But, no, my wife's the only one.

599
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,442
So, I want to get a divorce.

600
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,321
But I wanna leave her with some money.
A sufficient...

601
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,801
Uh...

602
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,201
And I was hoping
that my commission on this deal

603
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,328
would allow me to do that.

604
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,643
So I could make love just once.

605
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,606
Wheelbarrow position.

606
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,847
It
is the one that I would like to explore.

607
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,322
That position wouldn't...
My wife...

608
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,843
She looks
like a vending machine.

609
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,001
Over there.

610
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,844
She looks just like that.

611
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,806
Your wife's square?

612
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,610
Rectangular, yes.

613
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,286
But vending machines are square.

614
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,681
That's square?

615
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,964
Kind of square.

616
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,205
That shape there?

617
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,966
Mike, did you go to college?

618
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,602
I did not.

619
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,207
On your resume, it said that you
went to Ithaca College.

620
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,726
No.

621
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,962
(STAMMERING)
I didn't.

622
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,884
I went to a special school.

623
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,523
And I live in one of those homes

624
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,170
with a lot of other guys...

625
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,970
where they teach you how to iron

626
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,280
your clothes and stuff.

627
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,051
I'm kind
of like a counselor there.

628
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,724
I'm gonna go get a Pepsi, okay?

629
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,527
I'm losing confidence
in the team.

630
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,570
DAN: <i>Your daddy is a man
who is still away to shake hands...</i>

631
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,206
<i>but he has to fly
his hand to Germany now.</i>

632
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,008
<i>I checked Paul's Facebook page.</i>

633
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,003
<i>I walked into his room

Hi, Susan. <i>Hi.</i>

Is that Tim?

799

Yeah. We're all...
Um, Mike's here.

800
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,921
Hello, Susan.

801
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,447
We're all here, hon.
So you can just, uh...

802
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,967
go ahead and hold the phone
with your right hand.

Well, good luck, guys.

804
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,201
All right. Thank you, honey.

805
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,049
I'll call you in a bit.
I love you.

806
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,290
I like to make circles, too.

807
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,169
On my bike.

808
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,041
What the fuck?

809
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,121
The fuck is that?

810
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,167
Is that a fucking reindeer?

811
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,241
MIKE: Go right at it.
It's gonna dart.

812
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,200
I can't stop. I'm going
a hundred miles an hour.

813
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,560
It's gonna dart
and then you're...

814
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,920
- Right at it?
- MIKE: Right at it.

815
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,127
It's gonna dart. Dart.

816
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,281

Have you seen, Mike...

820
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,768
lots of reindeer
darting to and fro...

821
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,566
in St. Louis?

822
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,763
No, I'm sorry.

823
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,527
I just imagined
that I was a reindeer...

824
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,770
and I thought about what I would do
in that situation...

825
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,764
as a reindeer-man.

826

18 minutes to make our meeting.</i>

827
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,443
Seriously, good work, guys.

828
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,841
Did you narrow this to 17...?
Is that 17%?

829
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,727
Did you get us $1000
of bulk order down?

830
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,770
Yeah, I started working vendors yesterday.
How many did you get down?

831
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,604
39. Yeah.

832
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,569
What'd you do here?
This is much better.

833
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,762
I figured out a way
to fudge our asset charts.

834
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,611
Not fucked up. Just fudged.

835
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,450
I really Keeblered it.

836
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,451
We're gonna have
to haul ass, here.

837
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,846
So when that door
opens, it's like

838
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,046
the chute opening
at the Kentucky Derby...

839
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,486
and we're Seabiscuit.

840
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,647
Wait.

841
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,803
But we can't all be Seabiscuit.

842
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,361
All right. I'm Seabiscuit.

843
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,443
I'll be Northern Dancer.

Okay, and I'll be Fastee.

All right. That
is not a horse...

but okay, be whoever. Just run.

848
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,331
How is it a wheelbarrow again?

849
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,647
It's because one person's legs
is being held up.

850
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,926
Like wheelbarrow sticks.

So, I'm being no

who is concerned about you now...</i>

<i>in addition to your brother.</i>

1118
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,686
<i>Because you beat the shit
out of a small Indian kid.</i>

1119
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,120
<i>Maybe you're acting out because.</i>

1120
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,168
<i>Daddy hasn't been home
a lot this year.</i>

1121

<i>I don't want him to turn
into some unhappy behemoth.</i>

1125

him the coping skills...</i>

just get in the room.</i>

Were you here earlier when
I was explaining that?

1138
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,200
No.

1139
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,361
It used to be a down day,

1140
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,441
but now it's a "find
Bill Whilmsley" day.

1141
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,807
I left two messages
at his office, but he's not in.

1142
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,564
Yeah, I saw that part.

1143
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,125
It was boring.

00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,089
I'm sorry, man,
but I have to find him.

1145
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,720
I have to have him see
our hard numbers today...

1146
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,370
and tell us that we're
not better.

1147
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,562
Chuck is closing,
it feels like that.

1148
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,601
This motherfucker Whilmsley
will not respond.

1149
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,922
I built this deal
with him for a year.

1150
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,560
Look, I put Whilmsley's name
in Instagram...

1151
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,087
and we can find him,
maybe, through the pics.

1152
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,443
And then, we could fake bump
into him and be like...

1153
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:07,241
"Hey, Bill, what a coincidence.
It's Mike Pancake."

1154
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,691
Like that. Good idea.

1155
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,445
Don't say the last part. Tell
me if he posts something.

1156
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,171
Mr. McWinters? Hey.

1157
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,004
It's me, Kelf. From the hostel.

1158

Oh, Hi!

Oh, thank you.

1162
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,480
Enjoy it. Have a nice trip.

1163
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,121
They said, "Take one of these,
and go dancing."

1164
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,601
And, "it doesn't change
you, it reveals you."

1335
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,966
that it's not my scene,

it's the only scenario where
I can get any anymore.

I am a pear-shaped,

I've really let
myself go to pot.

You just pack it on.

1342
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,047
I started training
to run a marathon

1343
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,963
to stay on top of it.

1344
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,690

1345
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,251
Do you wanna hear this? Yes.

Do you wanna hear it? Yes.

1347
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,808

1348
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,089
"I'm running the St. Louis
Marathon this year!"

1349
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,643
And I got up to 15 miles
straight in July.

1350
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,804
But, man,
with all the travelling

1351
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,729

01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,290
You told him to meet us here?
Yeah.

1432
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,647
Last night, right? Yeah.

1433
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:34,927
Where the fuck is he?

1434
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,483
Maybe he's already there.
I mean, he's a go-getter.

1435
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,563
I'm serious. I'm concerned for him.
You should be, too.

1436
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,006
I am.

1437
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:47,931

Let's do this thing.

1440
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,128
Mike, the next time you
wanna run around Berlin...

1441
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:03,602
playing grab-ass with a Japanese
businessman in a hamster ball...

1442
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,240
you gotta let either me
or your older companion know.

1443
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,840
DAN: How are you? I'm good.
How are you?

1444
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,287
Good, Jim. We are excited
to be here at Gelger...

1445
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,967
to present a long-term purchase
and a lend-share cost-buy.

1446
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,282
We are ready to meet
your high expectations.

1447
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,886
Terrific. Why don't
you all have a seat?

1448
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,280
And we'll get started.

1449
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:36,647
Aren't we gonna pitch Gelger
today, your parent department?

1450
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,609
Austerlitz was gonna
sit in, possibly,

1451
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,205
but he's not gonna be
able to make it today.

1452
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,681
I thought Dirk Austerlitz
was our principal.

1453
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,487
I thought that we flew here
to see Dirk Austerlitz, Jim.

1454
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,200
Dirk and I are working
on this together.

1455
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,129
Dirk had to fly to St.
Louis today, so...

1456
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,483
Do you, Jim, know...

1457
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,722
that we all live in St. Louis?

1458
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,491
Oh, wow. Yeah.

1459
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,166
We left there to fly
here to see the guy

1460
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,481
that is in St. Louis, Jim.

1461
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,687
No shit?

1462
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,651
That's no good.

1463
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,730
Well, let's get started.

1464
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,487
Where's Bill?

1465
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,690
We covered a lot of this
ground last night with Bill.

1466
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,685
We pretty much shook on it.

1467
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,365
You can shake hands
with Bill all day long...

1468
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,244
but he doesn't make
our decisions.

1469
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,366
Where is Bill?

1470
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,205
Bill's getting my lunch.

1471
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,841
You wanna get started?

1472
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,401
Okay.

1473
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:42,521
Let me gear up my media, and I'll walk
you through our aftermarket.

1474
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,964
Great.

1475
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,887
So, what was your meeting about?

1476
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,361
Wholesale swarf residue
bargain cost-buys.

1477
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,443
"Swarf," is that a real thing?
Yeah, it's a real thing.

1478
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,926
What do you think,
we're like Dr. Seuss?

1479
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,367
We're just making up something,
like shit out of thin air?

1480
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,721
No. It's real.

1481
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,609
But it's just not interesting.

1482
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,091
Well, why do you do it?

1483
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,091
Well...

1484
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,404
I'm gonna send my son
to private school.

1485
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,324
Maybe it's worth
it, I'm thinking.

1486
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,130
If there's one less
kid in the class...

1487
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,721
then maybe there's one less kid

1488
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,962
to make fun of him
24 hours a day.

1489
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,722
Teasing sucks. Yeah.

1490
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,723
Have any of you
guys been teased?

1491
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,451
Yeah. I've been teased.

1492
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,568
I lived in America for a year.

1493
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,564
In Connecticut, and they made
fun of my name.

1494
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,000
What's your name?

1495
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,241
Karen.

1496
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,851
(LAUGHING)

1497
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,200
Yeah, well, in Sweden
it's like "John,"

1498
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,083
but in Connecticut, it's like...

1499
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,810
"Stacy." Yeah, I can see that.

1500
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,167
You know the worst
part with teasing?

1501
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,527
My dad would say,

1502
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,251
"Just forget about it
and ignore it, son."

1503
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,125
But he doesn't understand
because in his day...

1504
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,562
kids would get teased
at school all day,

1505
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,290
but then they could go home.

1506
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,408
And nowadays, you come home,

1507
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,801
and there's Facebook
and Instagram...

1508
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,328
and the bullies can get at you
through all of that stuff.

1509
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,642
And it never really stops.

1510
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,286
It never stops.

1511
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,807
When I was a kid, people
could only ridicule me...

1512
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,725
every day until 3:10
in the afternoon.

Okay, Snoop Lion,

1515
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:28,291
I think it's probably
time to pass that now.

1516
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,482
Oh, me? Yes.

1517
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,126
Go ahead, Karen.

1518
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,884
Pardon me.

Yes. I do know that.

1533
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,083

<i>and she was worried that her
boobs were gonna come out.</i>

why did you beat the shit
out of another kid?

01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,528
They were making fun of Paul.

<i>See, teal is very outlaw.</i>

1568

It's like, the goth
kids, really...

1569
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,244
they're joiners, when
you think about it.

1570
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,243
The teal kids,
they really stand alone.

1571
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,011
And whenever I have
to pick a color,

1572
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,481
obviously, I pick
teal every time.

1573
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,766
For sure.

1574
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,968
Because, you know...

no one else does it.

1576
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,970
And because you have to be bold.

1577
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,844
Because you have
to be teal tough.

1578

I'm just kidding. (LAUGHS)

1741
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:41,361
Jeez.

1742
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,925
We think we would be
a complement to you...

1743
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:49,687
not only on this job,
but in the future.

1744
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,922
And being able to look
ahead to the things...

1745
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,686
that are gonna be
in front of you.

1746
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,161
So, how many people
do you employ?

1747
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,370
Two. Three of us, altogether.

1748
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,721
How many do you?

1749
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,401
Oh...

1750
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,489
200,000-something.

1751
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,324
Fuck.

1752
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:09,846
Yeah.

1753
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,402
But three is tough, too.

1754
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,890
In a different way.

1755
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,162
I started with four.

1756
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,729
Like a family, when you
know everyone's name.

1757
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,841
But that can wear on you, too.

1758
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,407
Uh...

1759
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,401
So, this is slightly better.

1760
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,686
Bottom line.

1761
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,368
So, okay. Yeah.

1762
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,201
Are you going to shake my hand?

1763
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,520
I have some other shit to do.

1764
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,045
Yeah.

1765
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,090
Yes. Okay.

1766
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,444
Who's your daddy, baby?

1767
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,967
Who's your fucking daddy?

1768
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,161
(LAUGHING)

1769
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,041
We got it.

1770
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:12,446
(TAPPING)

1771
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,885
Oh, my goodness.

1772
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,088
Did something just happen? Did
we just come from a meeting?

1773
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,288
Did things just get
exciting around here?

1774
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:22,721
Oh, yeah, here it comes.

1775
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:23,881
Boom.

1776
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,804
There it is. Very nice.

1777
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,041
I got you!

1778
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,402
DAN: I know it's been a long
trip, but rest up.

1779
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,811
Monday, we're back at it.

1780
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:37,891
Hey!
I'm divorced.

1781
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,286
Just like that?

1782
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,601
There's an app.

1783
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:43,807
DAN: Hey, Jim!

1784
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,080
Did you have to fly to St.
Louis to talk to your boss?

1785
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,730
Yeah, that's right.

1786
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,251
Hey, Dan, can I get
your address?

1787
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,321
Sure.

1788
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,323
Because usually when someone fucks
me, I like to send them flowers.

1789
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,164
I like carnations.

1790
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,288
And if you make out a card,
include all three of us...

1791
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:57,646
because it was a three-way.

1792
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,484
You were my third fuck!

1793
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,125
ALL: Mike!

1794
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:04,801
Guys!

1795
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,010
Oh, man!
Oh, you guys!

1796
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:11,130
I missed you!
I missed you!

1797
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:14,005
Oh, wait. Guys, these
are my roommates.

1798
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,363
Tobey and Sebastian and Tobey.

1799
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:21,649
Sebastian, Tobeys, I don't
have to tell you...

1800
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,450
you've got one hell
of a friend here.

1801
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,364
And it is emperlaten

1802
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,363
that you ask Mike
about his trip.

1803
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,364
Because this cat had
some pretty major explers.

1804
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,124
Yeah. I lost my virginity!
Twice!

1805
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,726
(LAUGHING)

1806
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,050
Good stuff, Pancake.

1807
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,043
See you Monday, pal. Yeah.

1808
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,281
See you Monday, Mike.

1809
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,646
Bye, guys.

1810
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,122
DAN: How are you getting home?

1811
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:50,409
I'm leaving with a friend.

1812
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,043
Is that the, uh,
actual maid from...?

1813
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,248
We kept in touch.

1814
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,846
Why is she wearing
her maid outfit?

1815
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,162
I asked her nicely, Dan.

1816
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,560
Silver fox.

1817
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,403
Boom!
I like that.

1818
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,521
You remember Dan?

1819
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:09,641
Hello. Hi. Pleasure.

1820
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:10,926
Nice to meet you.

1821
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,082
We should go. Okay.

1822
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:14,241
Great.

1823
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,407
Thanks.

1824
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,731
Thank you, Tim.

1825
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,120
Why are you standing here?

1826
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,720
Don't you have a wheelbarrow you're
supposed to be jumping into?

1827
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,447
Daddy! Hey!

1828
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:36,931
Oh! (GIGGLES)

1829
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,201
Come on!

1830
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,249
How are you, sweetheart?
I'm good.

1831
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,368
Let's go. What do you say?

1832
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,760
You doing good? Yeah!

1833
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,285
All right.

1834
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,805
Hey, what's going
on with this guy, here?

1835
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,370
You don't get
out of the car anymore?

1836
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,568
What are you, too old?
Hey, Dad.

1837
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:51,926
How are you?
All right.

1838
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,605
Come on, let's get going here.

1839
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,603
Good to see you guys. Jump
on in, I'll be in in a minute.

1840
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,564
Hi, beautiful. How are you? Hi!

1841
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,410
SUSAN: Good to see you!

1842
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,408
So glad you're back.

1843
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,807
It's been a tough week.

1844
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,928
How about I drive?
Yes, please.

1845
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,486
<i>Flügelschlagen.</i>

1846
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,042
What? Something
I learned on my trip.

1847
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,124
It means, "You have
to fight like hell..."

1848
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:18,051
"but don't forget to catch
your breath now and then..."

1849
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,200
"and realize that everything's gonna
be all right."

1850
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,810
Or it means "turn left," probably.
(LAUGHS)

1851
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,485
Hey, you have your assignment, yes?
Yes.

1852
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,961
Because it's due today.

1853
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,491
The "Dad" one? Yeah.

1854
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,842
Shit. I was still working...

1855
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,526
I wrote it. I did it.

1856
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:51,681
You finished it?

1857
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:52,761
Mmm-hmm.

1858
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,605
SUSAN: It's good.

1859
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,170
She wrote it in,
like, two seconds.

1860
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:14,170
(SINGING)
<i>Can you feel?</i>

1861
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,686
<i>Can you feel it?</i>

1862
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,724
<i>Now it's coming back.</i>

1863
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,211
<i>We can steal it.</i>

1864
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,284
<i>If we bridge this gap.</i>

1865
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,771
<i>I can see you.</i>

1866
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:29,810
<i>Through the curtains
of the waterfall.</i>

1867
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,604
<i>When I lost it.</i>

1868
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:35,250
<i>Yeah, you held my hand.</i>

1869
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,925
<i>But I tossed it.</i>

1870
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,729
<i>Didn't understand.</i>

1871
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,211
<i>You were waiting.</i>

1872
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:43,364
<i>As I dove into the waterfall.</i>

1873
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:47,642
<i>So say Geronimo!</i>

1874
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:50,883
<i>Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!</i>

1875
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:57,691
<i>Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!</i>

1876
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,889
<i>Can you feel...</i>

1877
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,286
<i>my love?</i>

1878
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:09,728
<i>Bombs away Bombs away.</i>

1879
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,325
<i>Bombs away.</i>

1880
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,686
<i>Say Geronimo!</i>

1881
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,285
<i>Well, we rushed it.</i>

1882
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,925
<i>Moving way too fast.</i>

1883
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,240
<i>That we crushed it.</i>

1884
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,244
<i>But it's in the past.</i>

1885
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,089
<i>We can make this leap.</i>

1886
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,606
<i>Through the curtains
of the waterfall.</i>

1887
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,287
<i>So say Geronimo!</i>

1888
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:33,360
<i>Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!</i>

1889
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,603
<i>Can you feel...</i>

1890
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,486
<i>my love?</i>

1891
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,251
<i>Bombs away Bombs away.</i>

1892
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:51,810
<i>Bombs away.</i>

1893
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,922
<i>Well, I'm just a boy.</i>

1894
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,445
<i>With a broken toy.</i>

1895
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,170
<i>All lost and coy.</i>

1896
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,765
<i>At the curtains
of the waterfall.</i>

1897
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,524
<i>So it's here I stand.</i>

1898
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,204
<i>As a broken man.</i>

1899
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,964
<i>But I've found my friend.</i>

1900
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,883
<i>At the curtains
of the waterfall.</i>

1901
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,200
<i>Now I'm falling down.</i>

1902
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,930
<i>Through the crashing sound.</i>

1903
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:11,724
<i>And you've come around.</i>

1904
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,404
<i>At the curtains
of the waterfall.</i>

1905
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:14,891
<i>And you rushed to me.</i>

1906
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,729
<i>And it sets us free.</i>

1907
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,404
<i>So I fall to my knees.</i>

1908
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:21,321
<i>At the curtains
of the waterfall.</i>

1909
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:33,842
<i>When the world is turning
in the wrong direction.</i>

1910
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:37,483
<i>And every wave seems to be
crashing at your feet.</i>

1911
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:41,846
<i>Running circles doesn't
lead to inspiration.</i>

1912
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:43,965
<i>When you're at the end.</i>

1913
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,088
<i>You're at the start again.</i>

1914
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:50,208
<i>Time's moving too slow.</i>

1915
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:54,686
<i>One foot out the door.</i>

1916
01:27:54,800 --> 01:28:00,648
<i>Binds you flat but know
that you're not alone.</i>

1917
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:06,083
<i>Take a hand from me.</i>

1918
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:10,846
<i>You know what we'll be,
you'll see.</i>

1919
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,410
<i>If we fall and if we break.</i>

1920
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,687
<i>There will be
another chance today.</i>

1921
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:19,329
<i>Take a hand from me.</i>

1922
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,802
<i>I believe that we can
find our destination.</i>

1923
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,845
<i>The journey's just begun.</i>

1924
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:34,567
<i>Two is more than one.</i>

1925
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,567
<i>Time's moving too slow.</i>

1926
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,680
<i>One foot out the door.</i>

1927
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:48,882
<i>Binds you flat but know
that you're not alone.</i>

1928
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:54,083
<i>Take a hand from me.</i>

1929
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,601
<i>You know what we'll be,
you'll see.</i>

1930
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,649
<i>If we fall and if we break.</i>

1931
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:02,842
<i>There will be
another chance today.</i>

1932
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:07,050
<i>Take a hand from me.</i>

1933
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:10,642
<i>Whoa-oh-oh-oh.</i>

1934
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:15,364
<i>Take a hand from me</i>

1935
01:29:15,464 --> 01:29:20,464
