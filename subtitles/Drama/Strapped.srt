2
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:18,217
The light is somewhere here.

3
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:22,077
Shit! God...it's so dark.

4
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:36,936
So dead in here.

5
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:40,496
How about some music?

6
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,180
I could..

7
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,973
What kinda music you like?

8
00:01:46,835 --> 00:01:47,968
Something mellow?

9
00:02:05,103 --> 00:02:07,970
You can take your coat off...if you..want.

10
00:02:27,524 --> 00:02:28,524
You're so wet.

11
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:31,626
So am I...I guess.

12
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:35,044
I'll just take it to the other room.

13
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:17,102
Ahem..is wine ok?

14
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:20,773
Wine's great.

15
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:48,064
Wait.

16
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:49,703

17
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:53,866
Cheers.

18
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:56,544
Cheers.

19
00:04:07,475 --> 00:04:10,530
Is this music OK? If you don't like it I could...

20
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:43,667
I've never danced with another man before.

21
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:48,125
Have you ever been with a guy before?

22
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:50,666
Yeah.

23
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:52,189
Once.

24
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:54,736
When I was a teenager.

25
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:57,241
Gosh..it was...

26
00:05:00,144 --> 00:05:01,006
What?

27
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:05,783
We had sex in his basement.

28
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:09,051
A friend of mine. Alexander.

29
00:05:10,188 --> 00:05:11,993
My best friend really.

30
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,215
We were.....fifteen?

31
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:19,958
Sixteen.

32
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,170
He said that I was in love with him.

33
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:28,593
So I said so. Straight into his face.

34
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:31,803
"I love you"

35
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:34,339
What happened?

36
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:39,312
He beat the crap out of me.

37
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:42,376
I remember..he was swinging away calling me

38
00:05:43,482 --> 00:05:44,782
"petaras..petaras"

39
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:49,567
Fucking gay...fucking gay. Fucking gay.

40
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,672
Never saw him after that.

41
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:55,484
He moved away.

42
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:02,636
My first guy was my uncle.

43
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:04,651
Uncle Charlie.

44
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:07,155
Uncle Charlie?

45
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,832
He was my dad's drinkin' buddy. We called him uncle Charlie.

46
00:06:13,852 --> 00:06:14,852
What happened?

47
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:20,206
Well, one night he came into my room and fucked me.

48
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,572
How old were you?

49
00:06:24,065 --> 00:06:25,065
12.

50
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:29,114
Did your..did your dad find out?

51
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,592
Oh yeah.

52
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:32,334
What did he do?

53
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:36,321
He pulled a knife and then he charged him.

54
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:40,006
You mean like..stabbed him?

55
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,973
No..no...he charged him...20 bucks.

56
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:46,079
- No!
- Yeah.

57
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,802
He said if anyone was gonna fuck his
boy he may as well make money off of it.

58
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,678
Figured I was ruined anyay.

59
00:06:53,406 --> 00:06:54,606
- Jesus!

60

And uncle Charlie he had a lot of friends too so...

61
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,938
You mean your dad pimped you out?

62
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:05,885

63
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:08,637

Eddie, have a toot.

170
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,924
Eddie here gives the best blowjobs
fucking anywhere. In the fuckin' universe.

171
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:21,864
He's got no uvula

172
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:24,389
Had it removed from some Romanian
pimp or some shit.

173
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:25,975
Deep Throat Eddie.

174
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:27,643
That's your new name from now on.

175
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:28,604
Deep

176
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:29,505
Throat

177
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:30,506
Eddie!

178
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,313
Have a toot.

179
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:37,153
But that's not the best part.

180
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:40,414
Can I tell 'em?

181
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:41,549
Sure.

182
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:43,576
Ok, I'm gonna tell 'em.

183
00:18:43,677 --> 00:18:48,431
You're looking at the only son of... wait for it...

184
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:52,529
Samuel Franklin Dobson, ex-mayor.

185
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,430
Samuel fuckin' Franklin Dobson
Isn't that right, Eddie?

186
00:18:56,933 --> 00:19:00,811
And you tell them what you
said when you finally found out.

187
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:03,855
You tell them, you like the
story more than me.

188
00:19:04,107 --> 00:19:05,107
Whatever, queen.

189
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:09,361
So, they come and take him
to the big scary mansion, you know?

190
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:13,350
And little Deep Throat
is still in her Go-Go outfit.

191
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:17,961
And his father's all like... blah, blah, blah!
No son of mine!

192
00:19:18,355 --> 00:19:19,939
Mayor talk, mayor talk, mayor talk.

193
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,911
And he offers Deep Throat
here like a truck load of money and shit.

194
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,190
A college education, a job.

195
00:19:27,214 --> 00:19:29,083
And all Deep Throat has to do is, you know...

196
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:33,644
end to this depraved life...
of godless butt-fucking. Right?

197
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:36,783
Well, Eddie here says...

198
00:19:37,484 --> 00:19:40,718
Father, I am as God made me

199
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:43,070
and to follow you would be a great sin of all.

200
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:44,875
I know this story!

201
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,676
<i>"My Own Private Idaho"</i>

202
00:19:46,795 --> 00:19:48,786
Keanu Reeves, River Phoenix.

203
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:50,028
Shut the fuck up!

204
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:53,720
I saw it, you saw it!
Every gay man in the universe has seen it.

205
00:19:53,744 --> 00:19:54,644
I never saw it.

206
00:19:54,668 --> 00:19:56,919
Yes, he's like the mayors son or the governor's son...

207
00:19:57,442 --> 00:20:00,470
No, no. This is why no one talks to you.

208
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,460
That's why no one listens to you.

209
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:03,486
- If Eddie says that his daddy is the mayor...
- He was the mayor.

210
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:06,543
Was the mayor. Thank you Eddie.
Then Eddie's daddy was the mayor.

211
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:10,785
Yeah, right, okay. Yeah! He's the litmus test
of reality right now.

212
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,287
- You want to leave?
-No.

213
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,313
Then shut the fuck up.

214
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,047
- Your win... I'm listening. I'm quiet.
- OK..Shhh!

215
00:20:17,191 --> 00:20:21,600
Bitch! Always have to say
something..Fuckin' .. fucking up my fucking high.

216
00:20:21,624 --> 00:20:25,165
So..Anyway, little Eddie's
had this big ultimatum, right.

217
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,631
She has to clean up and go to college

218
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:29,319
or live the life of a hussy.

219
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,948
And she says: I am as God made me?

220
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,624
A dirty, butt-fucking, cum eating whore.

221
00:20:37,513 --> 00:20:40,306
And she's cut-off without a cent.

222
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:43,286
That takes balls. Here have a toot.

223
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,602
Oh, that's ok.

224
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,687
Who are you?

225
00:20:46,956 --> 00:20:50,375
Free drugs! I used to
push her out of the house.

226
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:53,661
No Eddie, there's no more drugs,
go home. God you're a machine.

227
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,765
Here take.

228
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:59,261
What's in the bottle?

229
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:00,352
Fine.

230
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,349
Sassy-pant, a
drink for our guest.

231
00:21:03,715 --> 00:21:05,382
Get this man a drink.

232
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,579
Cuz you're a man now, aren't you Eddie?

233
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:10,145
Yeah.

234
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,231
Little Miss Deep Throat.

235
00:21:11,698 --> 00:21:14,219
He's all Mister Clean and sober now.

236
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:15,687
Is that part of being a man?

237
00:21:15,711 --> 00:21:16,753
I guess you'll never know.

238
00:21:17,704 --> 00:21:20,539
Check you with the attitude,
Mr. Big Cock.

239
00:21:20,707 --> 00:21:22,833
Not big enough
for that wide ol' hole of yours.

240
00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:29,468
Ohhh...Oh, the lip, I love it!

241
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:32,160
Show off your cock. Come on..
just the head, just the one eye...come on.

242
00:21:32,578 --> 00:21:33,411
How much?

243
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:34,440
Excuse me?

244
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:36,456
I'm strictly cash now.
You gotta pay to play.

245
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,167
Oh, no!

246
00:21:39,877 --> 00:21:44,748
My little Eddie's all grown up.
I think I'm gonna cry.

247
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:46,950
It's hard to see them go.

248
00:21:48,286 --> 00:21:51,515
No sir!
Not a dancing slut no more. Not a..

249
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:55,676
Not a drugged out devil but real
bonafide whore.

250
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:57,728
Cash only! Please!

251
00:21:57,729 --> 00:21:59,949
I am an agent of desire.

252
00:21:59,973 --> 00:22:01,891
A what? I like that.

253
00:22:02,826 --> 00:22:06,412
"Do not ask me who I am, and
do not ask me to remain the same."

254
00:22:07,063 --> 00:22:09,149
Hey, "Dingle-dick"! What movie is that from?

255
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,744
That's not a movie. It is Foucault.

256
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:14,348
Who?

257
00:22:14,372 --> 00:22:15,580
Never mind.

258
00:22:16,874 --> 00:22:22,671
I met him.. he's dancing at the Cirlcle-Jerk
and I just had to have her.

259
00:22:22,922 --> 00:22:24,909
Wrap her up I'll take her.

260
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:26,684
Owww, such a whore. You're a born whore.

261
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:31,321
Yeah..I bring wonder boy home and
the rest is history.

262
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:34,468
That was good times, huh?

263
00:22:34,492 --> 00:22:35,186
The best.

264
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,002
- I used to cook you dinner...
-Yeah.

265
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:39,046
We took care of each other, didn't we?

266
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:41,123
Yeah. We did.

267
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:43,053
I was so in love with this kid
I could never tell him tho.

268
00:22:43,077 --> 00:22:44,244
He'd run for the hills, wouldn't ya?

269
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:45,779
Oh yeah.

270

Oow..We'd party!

00:22:49,216 --> 00:22:51,745
We had fun. We had our
day in the sun as they say.

272
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,853
Those were good, good, good times, weren't they?

273
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:56,431
Yeah.

274
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,636

Wait. What are you doing?

00:24:21,946 --> 00:24:24,014
Wait for the music.

299
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:26,984
God, so impatient.
Ah ha!

You're a whore, aren't you Eddie?

324
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:12,246
Edidie..Eeeeddie... Whore boy.

00:28:38,754 --> 00:28:40,200
So, you really him?

Am I really who?

327
00:28:43,243 --> 00:28:45,119
Eddie. The mayor's son.

328
00:28:49,883 --> 00:28:51,694
Yeah, I thought so.

329
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:53,611
I wouldn't tell Leon.

330
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,863
He likes these things, you know.

331
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:58,833
The way they were.

332
00:29:02,587 --> 00:29:03,980
Yeah, I'm not ask your name.

333
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:07,094
Doesn't matter... names.

334
00:29:07,118 --> 00:29:08,619
Probably make one up anyway.

335
00:29:11,506 --> 00:29:13,424
But, you're beautiful.

336
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,296
Thanks.

337
00:29:18,513 --> 00:29:19,764
What gave me away?

338
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:23,977
Umm..You're too smart to
be one of Leon's boys.

339
00:29:24,878 --> 00:29:26,629
You don't do drugs.

340
00:29:27,816 --> 00:29:30,233
Nah. You're no River Phoenix.

341
00:29:31,477 --> 00:29:32,900
You know who you are?

342
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:39,033
Brad Davis
"Dying in your own arms."

343
00:29:40,786 --> 00:29:42,537
Have you ever seen "Querelle"?

344
00:29:43,205 --> 00:29:44,800
Shame on you.

345
00:29:47,143 --> 00:29:49,102
Leon... ya know...

346
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:55,242
He sees things his own way.
As if the past is perfection.

347
00:29:56,452 --> 00:29:58,195
What do you see?

348
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,631
I see you.

349
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:05,811
Whoever you are,
reflecting back on me.

350
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:13,252
So... You really a hustler?

351
00:30:14,838 --> 00:30:15,772
Yeah.

352
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,299
Oh yeah? You gotta website? Shit like that?

353
00:30:18,467 --> 00:30:21,127
No, no I don't like it like that.

354
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,021
Oh yeah? How do you like it?

355
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:28,326
Random, anonymous. I like adventures.

356
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,623
Ahhh.. Agent of desire.

357
00:30:30,647 --> 00:30:32,606
That's right.

358
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:35,258
Right. So...

359
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,259
So...?

360
00:30:38,613 --> 00:30:40,474
How much?

361
00:30:40,498 --> 00:30:41,749
What did you have in mind?

362
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,175
Suck my cock.

363
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:45,344
- 50.
- Cool.

364
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:50,349
Can you break a 20?

365
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,726
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

366
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:55,229
I guess I'll make it an even 60.

367
00:30:58,116 --> 00:30:59,450
Come over here.

368
00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:04,833
Ohh.. Do not worry about them.
Just come over here.

369
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,670
Oh yeah..

00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,818
Oh fuck.

00:32:23,285 --> 00:32:25,588

372
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:21,482
Wow. You really suck a mean dick.

373
00:33:22,406 --> 00:33:23,490

374
00:33:25,155 --> 00:33:25,913
Wow.

375
00:33:26,906 --> 00:33:27,923
You really shoot.

376
00:33:27,947 --> 00:33:28,890
Sorry.

377
00:33:29,247 --> 00:33:30,787
No, it's hot. I like it.

378
00:33:31,452 --> 00:33:34,245
I think I got some in my eye tho.
It might have blinded me a little bit.

379
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,414
Think I'm gonna have to check my insurance plan
on that.

380
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,669
Alright then, Dirk.

381
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,045
I can smell my cock in your mouth.

382
00:33:57,637 --> 00:33:59,799
Ask me how a gay men say goodbye.

383
00:33:59,823 --> 00:34:01,949
How do gay men say goodbye?

384
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,951
I'll call you.

385
00:34:13,795 --> 00:34:15,713

to set your stupid ass on fire!

389
00:34:28,836 --> 00:34:30,816
Stupid cow!

390
00:34:33,057 --> 00:34:35,475
And where have you been young man?

391
00:34:35,493 --> 00:34:37,411
Rifling through your stuff.

392
00:34:37,745 --> 00:34:39,162
Find anything good?

393
00:34:39,414 --> 00:34:40,825
Nothing worth stealing.

394
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:42,876
Uhh huh.

395
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,029
You were playing with Dingle-Dick weren't ya?

396
00:34:46,696 --> 00:34:48,030
I know you were.

397
00:34:48,406 --> 00:34:51,102
Do not lie to me, I can see it in your eyes.

398
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,220
Did you suck his cock? How big was it?

399
00:34:54,346 --> 00:34:55,096
Bigger than yours.

400
00:34:55,347 --> 00:34:56,900
"Bigger than yours"

401
00:34:56,901 --> 00:34:59,901
What would you do without cock?

402
00:35:00,885 --> 00:35:04,465
In a world without cock, you'd starve.

403
00:35:05,082 --> 00:35:09,020
You'd be like the last man on the planet
trying to suck his own cock.

404
00:35:09,044 --> 00:35:12,839
Cuz it was all gone and she'd starve.

405
00:35:16,385 --> 00:35:18,264
What are you doing?

406
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:19,872
Getting dressed.

407
00:35:20,081 --> 00:35:20,831
Why?

408
00:35:20,966 --> 00:35:22,841
Because that's the only way to put my clothes on.

409
00:35:22,993 --> 00:35:26,161
No. You're more beautiful when you're naked.

410
00:35:26,413 --> 00:35:27,330
Oh..I gotta get going.

You can practice that here!

414
00:35:34,204 --> 00:35:35,496
Oh, right.

415
00:35:36,182 --> 00:35:37,659
Little Eddie can't be late for school.

416
00:35:37,683 --> 00:35:42,080

421
00:35:51,906 --> 00:35:53,025
But don't.

422
00:35:56,702 --> 00:35:59,894
Fine! Go! Bye!

423
00:36:01,665 --> 00:36:02,582

00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,650

00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:37,052

431
00:36:42,725 --> 00:36:44,685
<i>I'll call you!</i>

00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,812
All righty.

433
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,166
Go to bed, young man.

434
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,960
Do not tell me what to do.

435
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,505
I don't even think that was her.

436
00:38:58,726 --> 00:38:59,970
Honey, I'll be right back.

437
00:39:01,311 --> 00:39:02,105

00:39:06,258 --> 00:39:08,073
Okay, hurry back.

00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:13,099
- Something I can I do for you?
- Oh. hey... hi.

441
00:39:13,766 --> 00:39:16,177
Ah..I'm sorry... I know you?

442
00:39:16,735 --> 00:39:18,323
Really?

443
00:39:18,988 --> 00:39:20,905
Don't I you know?

444
00:39:21,407 --> 00:39:23,366
I dunno, man, do you?

445
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:26,052
I thought...

446
00:39:26,955 --> 00:39:28,539
I..I could swear I...

447
00:39:30,225 --> 00:39:31,308
What is your name?

448
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,633

449
00:39:34,696 --> 00:39:37,531
Max. Right.

Wow. I..I thought you were...

451
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:46,405
Are you new to the building? I mean..

452
00:39:47,061 --> 00:39:47,835
Did you just move in?

453
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,388
No. I was just visiting some friends.

454
00:39:50,676 --> 00:39:51,854
Can't find my way out of this place.

455
00:39:51,878 --> 00:39:53,464
It's like a fuckin' maze.

456
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:56,802
Yeah. Ya know, when I first
moved in here I thought it

457
00:39:56,814 --> 00:39:59,800
was like that hotel in the
<i>Shining</i>; total labyrinth.

458
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,176
Oh..I'm..I'm David.

459
00:40:13,853 --> 00:40:15,074
You want something?

460
00:40:15,422 --> 00:40:16,977
No..no, I just...

461
00:40:17,824 --> 00:40:19,619
Hey um, I'm sorry if I scared you before.

462
00:40:19,643 --> 00:40:22,224
- You didn't scare me.
- It's just..

463
00:40:22,248 --> 00:40:24,690
You really..I mean..I..I thought..

464
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:27,299
Yeah, yeah. I look like your friend.
I got that.

465
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:31,984
Not a friend. Just... just this guy.

466
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,713
It's crazy, huh?
The way that people can..

467
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:40,645
Hey. Do you need help getting out?

468
00:40:40,669 --> 00:40:42,212
I mean I can show you the way. It's..it's easy.

00:40:42,236 --> 00:40:46,136
It's no problem. I've ah..It's..it's this way.

470
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,204
What is this?

00:41:33,602 --> 00:41:34,720
Laundry.

472
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,122
Dude, this is the basement.

473
00:41:39,067 --> 00:41:40,947
Where's the way out?

474
00:41:43,864 --> 00:41:44,441
Look man...

475
00:41:44,465 --> 00:41:46,424
It's right there. It's..it's right there.

478
00:41:52,064 --> 00:41:53,356
Just want to ask you something, okay?

479
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,510
Ok.

480
00:42:02,216 --> 00:42:03,736
Dude ask!

481
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,385
Look, I'm not fag, alright?

482
00:42:05,636 --> 00:42:06,344
Alright.

483
00:42:06,512 --> 00:42:10,098
I mean.... I have a wife and a baby girl.

484
00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:11,850
That's great.

485
00:42:13,152 --> 00:42:17,489
But you... see, you...

486

You're not... I mean...
You're not like... like...

Like those guys!

489
00:42:23,489 --> 00:42:26,084
These fucking faggots down the
hall. I fucking hate those guys!

490
00:42:26,108 --> 00:42:27,233
They make me sick.

491
00:42:29,003 --> 00:42:31,588
But, you and me.

492
00:42:34,475 --> 00:42:36,142
We're both men.

493
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:42,315
What?

494
00:42:42,883 --> 00:42:44,842
I want to suck you off.

495
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:47,879
Oh man...
I knew this was some fag shit.

496
00:42:48,047 --> 00:42:50,048
I told you, I'm not a fag!

497
00:42:51,175 --> 00:42:53,719
Alright, you're not a fag.

498
00:42:58,733 --> 00:43:00,609
So where'd do you want a...

499
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:03,212
Here?

500
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:07,550
I dunno, man.

501
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:12,263
We can hear if someone comes.
We can totally hear.

502
00:43:13,407 --> 00:43:18,661
And I can pay you!
40 bucks. Oow..45. 45 bucks.

503
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:20,730
And you just want to suck it?

504
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,844
Cuz I don't get fucked or
kissed or none of that fag shit.

505
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:27,704
I know, I know, and it's cool.
It's cool.

506
00:43:44,806 --> 00:43:45,998
Come here.

507
00:44:27,426 --> 00:44:29,002
Slow down.

508
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:50,839
Turn around.

509
00:44:50,863 --> 00:44:52,973
Dude, I told you: I don't get fucked.

510
00:44:52,997 --> 00:44:54,573
I want to eat your ass.

511
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,406
Turn around.

512
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:12,477
You like that?

513
00:45:14,182 --> 00:45:15,834
I love it.

514
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:45,290
You really do go for that ass.

515
00:45:46,442 --> 00:45:48,651
Never really went for that but...

516
00:45:54,408 --> 00:45:55,908
Dude...

517
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:06,361
Hey!

518
00:46:10,366 --> 00:46:12,367
Hey watch it punk!

519
00:46:21,686 --> 00:46:23,103
Here we are.

520
00:46:23,121 --> 00:46:24,705
Welcome to attic central.

521
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,208
Sit over here. Huh.

522
00:46:33,073 --> 00:46:36,394
Alright, let see what we have here.
Tip your head back.

523
00:46:39,771 --> 00:46:41,189
Hold this up.

524
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:44,617
Just a little pressure. There ya go.
Be right back.

525
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,836
I guess you're a night owl, huh?

526
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,028
I never sleep. Sleep is for the young.

527
00:46:55,863 --> 00:46:56,899
Don't you want to sleep?

528
00:46:56,923 --> 00:47:00,676
Oh, I'd love it. "To sleep, perchance to dream."

529
00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:03,362
Nope. Instead, it's laundry.

530
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,656
Laundry and books.

531
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,742
They make pills for that.

532
00:47:07,993 --> 00:47:09,327
What? For laundry?

533
00:47:09,578 --> 00:47:11,370
Sleep.

534
00:47:13,707 --> 00:47:15,958
They have pills for everything.

535
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:17,894
Let's see.

536
00:47:18,979 --> 00:47:20,513
Well, the bleeding stopped.

537
00:47:20,514 --> 00:47:21,348
Yeah, I think so.

538
00:47:21,499 --> 00:47:22,332
Did he break it?

539
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:24,000
No, no it's still there.

540
00:47:24,252 --> 00:47:24,751
Good.

541
00:47:24,919 --> 00:47:28,822
I'd hate to see this magnificent mug
of yours malled and maimed.

542
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:32,061
Time will do enough of that. Believe me.

543
00:47:32,085 --> 00:47:34,778
Here, let me take this.

544
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:39,541
You know they say we all get the face we deserve
by the time we reach 40.

545
00:47:39,793 --> 00:47:42,021
Oh is that right. It's what they say?

546
00:47:42,045 --> 00:47:45,339
Well, I've stopped worrying about
that a long ago.

547
00:47:45,741 --> 00:47:47,200
OK, let's see.

548
00:47:48,285 --> 00:47:49,660
Ahhh, I think you'll live.

549
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:52,622
That guy really clobbered you.

550
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:55,458
No. I had him right where I wanted him.

551
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:57,354
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

552
00:47:57,378 --> 00:47:59,189
If you hadn't shown up
he'd a been toast.

553
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:01,464
Well, I'm sorry I interrupted you.

554
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:03,660
Well, that's alright.

555
00:48:03,684 --> 00:48:06,686
And what do we call you,
my foundling from the basement?

556
00:48:07,021 --> 00:48:10,023
- Jeff.
- Jeff. Nice to meet you, Jeff.

557
00:48:10,191 --> 00:48:12,442
- I am Sam.
- Nice to meet you.

558
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:14,527
There we go.

559
00:48:14,729 --> 00:48:15,729
Good as new.

560
00:48:17,315 --> 00:48:19,233
Ok, hold that there.

561
00:48:20,652 --> 00:48:23,112
They fill up so fast.

562
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:29,537
I thought up here in the attic
I might escape the noise.

563
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:31,437
Top floor apartment.

564
00:48:31,461 --> 00:48:35,900
Rent control. No noises.
But I didn't count on rain.

565
00:48:35,901 --> 00:48:39,195
Water, water everywhere...not a drop to drink.

566
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,533
Wish I had a jungle up here.

567
00:48:41,557 --> 00:48:47,062
A jungle full of plants.
Plants to soak up all this water.

568
00:48:48,189 --> 00:48:50,523
You know where that goes.

569
00:49:02,181 --> 00:49:04,471
Medicine time.

570
00:49:13,081 --> 00:49:14,999
Here you go.

571
00:49:16,093 --> 00:49:17,045
Thanks.

572
00:49:17,069 --> 00:49:17,902
Don't mention it.

573
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,280
No, really, thank you.

574
00:49:21,782 --> 00:49:23,700
Drink your medicine.

575
00:49:31,651 --> 00:49:32,984
So...

576
00:49:35,279 --> 00:49:38,031
What were you boys doing down there?

577
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,392
It didn't look like laundry.

578
00:49:41,523 --> 00:49:44,924
Ohh man... it's a..it's a long history.

579
00:49:50,096 --> 00:49:50,595
Alright.

580
00:49:51,748 --> 00:49:53,332
Ah..Well, let's see.

581
00:49:54,545 --> 00:49:57,986
Oh. First of all, I've been trying to get
out of this building for like an hour.

582
00:49:58,967 --> 00:49:59,921
Trying to get out of the building.

583
00:50:00,272 --> 00:50:02,423
Yeah, I can't get free of this place.

584
00:50:02,775 --> 00:50:05,193
It's an apartment building. It isn't purgatory.

585
00:50:05,444 --> 00:50:07,278
I know, but...

586
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,215
I keep getting lost or .. or side tracked.

587
00:50:10,383 --> 00:50:11,884
I mean this place is like a maze.

588
00:50:11,902 --> 00:50:12,717
It's like a labyrinth?

589
00:50:12,941 --> 00:50:14,941
Well, which is it? A labyrinth or a maze?

590
00:50:16,322 --> 00:50:17,573
What's the difference?

591
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:23,193
Well, a maze is a trap.
A labyrinth goes somewhere.

592
00:50:24,891 --> 00:50:25,740
Let me ask you something.

593
00:50:26,641 --> 00:50:29,143
Is every man in this apartment building gay?

594
00:50:29,511 --> 00:50:32,096
I mean, is it something in the water or what?

595
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:34,223
I do not know.

596
00:50:35,709 --> 00:50:39,712
Well, I'm sure there are a few
straight guys walking around here somewhere.

597
00:50:40,214 --> 00:50:44,926
But... this is the gayest building on the gayest
street in town.

598
00:50:45,594 --> 00:50:46,678
Is that a problem?

599
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:48,863
No.

600
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:52,158
Are you gay?

601
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:54,160
As pink ink.

602
00:50:55,663 --> 00:50:56,663
So...

603
00:50:57,732 --> 00:50:58,816
So, I'm in the hallway and

604
00:50:59,818 --> 00:51:01,610
this guy says he can
show me the way out.

605
00:51:01,611 --> 00:51:02,900
Oh...

606
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,470
Then what happened?

607
00:51:05,348 --> 00:51:08,300
Ah..he leads me down to the basement, and..

608
00:51:08,802 --> 00:51:09,885
Yes ..

609
00:51:12,222 --> 00:51:14,902
Well, first of all he goes out
of his way to tell me he's not gay.

610
00:51:14,926 --> 00:51:15,992
Hmm..I see.

611
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,958
And then tell me he wants
suck my cock.

612
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:20,331
The guy who beat you?

613
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:24,009
He didn't beat me. He hit me.

614
00:51:24,033 --> 00:51:25,193
Ahhh.

615
00:51:25,194 --> 00:51:27,047
He cold-cocked me out of
the blue. The dick.

616
00:51:27,071 --> 00:51:28,572
Oh really?

617
00:51:28,906 --> 00:51:29,948
I tell you...

618
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:35,109
He..he had that look in his eyes like..

619
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,842
he really wanted to kill me.

620
00:51:40,885 --> 00:51:44,221
And he probably did. Poor guy.

621
00:51:44,722 --> 00:51:46,175
I'll be alright.

622
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:47,700
Not you..him.

623
00:51:50,203 --> 00:51:52,830
He is the poor guy? Look at my face!

624
00:51:53,331 --> 00:51:56,394
You were just lost.
He's the one who's trapped.

625
00:51:56,418 --> 00:51:58,335
How is he trapped?

626
00:52:02,274 --> 00:52:05,443
What? You mean?
Because he thinks he's not a man?

627
00:52:06,111 --> 00:52:11,741
Cuz he craves the cock
but he's living this lie? Is that it?

628
00:52:14,077 --> 00:52:17,246
Because then, who is he? Right?

629
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:21,585
I mean, no one. Who..who can know who he is?

630
00:52:36,935 --> 00:52:38,644
And you, sir?

631
00:52:40,413 --> 00:52:41,324
What?

632
00:52:41,348 --> 00:52:43,266
Who are you one wonders.

633
00:52:46,729 --> 00:52:48,056
I'm just a guy.

634
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,789
Just a guy.

635
00:52:54,003 --> 00:52:55,962
And how do you see yourself?

636
00:52:57,849 --> 00:52:59,975
You mean, as a man?

637
00:53:01,202 --> 00:53:03,454
You mean, am I a gay man?

638
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,640
I don't know.

639
00:53:08,042 --> 00:53:10,354
I guess so, I mean... I suck cock.

640
00:53:10,378 --> 00:53:12,021
Well, that's a start.

641
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:15,024
Yeah, and I ain't ashamed of it either.

642
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,525
Well, good for you.

643
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,944
I like to having sex with guys.

644
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,834
I like turning them on.. getting fucked.

645
00:53:24,593 --> 00:53:26,177
What kind of guys?

646
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:28,429
Ah, pretty much anybody.

647
00:53:30,533 --> 00:53:33,345
I'm not..I'm not gay.

648
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:36,796
You know, I mean, I am but..

649
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,416
I don't go to parades.

650
00:53:39,743 --> 00:53:41,577
And I'm not wrapped up in rainbows.

651
00:53:42,578 --> 00:53:44,156
I don't want to get married.

652
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,681
So you are not politicized.

653
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:48,519
Yeah.

654
00:53:48,543 --> 00:53:51,097
But the very act of
loving a man is in and of

655
00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:53,620
itself a political
statement don't ya think?

656
00:53:54,332 --> 00:53:55,929
Nah, I've never fell loved a guy.

657
00:53:56,226 --> 00:53:58,352
You haven't loved a guy, yet.

658
00:53:59,855 --> 00:54:02,690
Ok. I haven't loved a guy, yet.

659
00:54:03,275 --> 00:54:04,731
And since I've had sex with girls.

660
00:54:04,755 --> 00:54:07,562
Well, whoop-dee-do! Me too!

661
00:54:08,797 --> 00:54:10,757
But you said you were gay.

662
00:54:16,405 --> 00:54:18,198
You know what? Fuck gay.

663
00:54:18,449 --> 00:54:19,660
Yeah, fuck gay.

664
00:54:19,684 --> 00:54:21,518
Fuck it. I don't believe in it.

665
00:54:21,853 --> 00:54:23,437
Well it believes in you.

666
00:54:24,898 --> 00:54:28,169
You know, guys like me fought in the frontlines..

667
00:54:28,193 --> 00:54:33,030
so that guys like you could enjoy
the luxury of felling so ambivalent.

668
00:54:34,532 --> 00:54:36,107
Ya still get punched.

669
00:54:36,402 --> 00:54:39,404
Yeah, still get punched.

670
00:54:41,907 --> 00:54:44,450
So you're not gay.

671
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:49,831
Maybe you're just... queer.

672
00:54:50,482 --> 00:54:52,060
Maybe.

673
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:56,045
Or maybe it's just a traveler..
a sightseer.

674
00:54:56,213 --> 00:54:57,297
Maybe.

675
00:54:57,548 --> 00:54:59,009
A nomad explorer.

676
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:00,951
Maybe I'm just a dude.

677
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,454
Maybe you're just a tourist.

678
00:55:05,498 --> 00:55:07,499
Or maybe I'm just a whore.

679
00:55:08,501 --> 00:55:10,502
Maybe?

680
00:55:14,632 --> 00:55:18,051
Now..when you say... whore...

681
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,079
Oh God!

682
00:55:45,256 --> 00:55:47,657
Old man, you really like to fuck.

683
00:55:47,942 --> 00:55:52,028
You have no idea how...much..

684
00:55:52,149 --> 00:55:55,547
How much..how much I needed that.

685
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:57,919
Oh mama!

686
00:55:59,421 --> 00:56:01,673
Hey, no... no stop.

687
00:56:02,174 --> 00:56:03,716
Ok, stop..

688
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:02,627
Here ya go.

689
00:57:13,031 --> 00:57:17,451
Oh mama! That is one sweet ass son.

690
00:57:19,605 --> 00:57:22,982
You have made this old man very happy, son.

691
00:57:24,401 --> 00:57:26,213
Old guys fuck the best.

692
00:57:26,237 --> 00:57:27,404
Is that right?

693
00:57:27,655 --> 00:57:28,322
Yeah.

694
00:57:29,173 --> 00:57:30,590
Why is that?

695
00:57:30,841 --> 00:57:32,258
I don't know.

696
00:57:32,593 --> 00:57:35,428
They care ya know, how it feels.

697
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:37,331
Younger guys they just...

698
00:57:40,776 --> 00:57:43,320
Well, it's very nice of you to say.

699
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:47,695
But, I'm afraid I'd be just like them
if I had a few years off me.

700
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,300
I still like old guys best.

701
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:57,743
You ever make regular clients of the
guys you've played around with?

702
00:57:57,878 --> 00:57:58,961
Nope.

703
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:01,923
Pity.

704
00:58:04,009 --> 00:58:05,810
Why is that I wonder.

705
00:58:05,811 --> 00:58:08,062
I like everything new.

706
00:58:08,397 --> 00:58:11,969
Oh, well...new.

707
00:58:13,586 --> 00:58:17,899
Nothing in the world is new kid.
I'd hate to be the one to tell you.

708
00:58:19,058 --> 00:58:20,559
New to me then.

709
00:58:21,344 --> 00:58:26,306
What will you do when you have
had all your dalliances..with all there is to have?

710
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:29,000
You mean when I've fucked every fag in the city?

711
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:29,904
Yes.

712
00:58:29,928 --> 00:58:31,178
I'll move.

713
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:34,631
The wandering hero.

714
00:58:34,883 --> 00:58:38,346
That's right. I go where my body takes me.

715
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:39,454
I like that.

716
00:58:40,414 --> 00:58:44,625
I like the thought of you out there
wandering around, somewhere.

717
00:58:44,793 --> 00:58:46,461
Bringing pleasure to the world.

718
00:58:47,421 --> 00:58:48,838
For a price.

719
00:58:49,089 --> 00:58:53,395
Oh Right. Right. We can't just give
ourselves away now can we?

720
00:58:53,411 --> 00:58:55,662
Nobody's that altruistic.

721
00:58:56,038 --> 00:58:57,783
More like a man's gotta eat.

722
00:58:57,807 --> 00:58:58,807
Damn right.

723
00:58:59,142 --> 00:58:59,933
Pay rent.

724
00:59:00,143 --> 00:59:02,019
Oh yes, the rent.

725
00:59:02,645 --> 00:59:06,106
And going to school, perhaps?

726
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,230
Umm hmm.

727
00:59:14,949 --> 00:59:16,950
Perhaps.

728
00:59:20,663 --> 00:59:22,164
What?

729
00:59:38,553 --> 00:59:40,712
This is nice.

730
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,838
Beautiful boy.

731
00:59:54,641 --> 00:59:56,600
- Sam?
- Yeah?

732
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:00,562
How old are you?

733
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:06,026
Old as the sun. And you?

734
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:12,075
You see those?

735
01:00:14,036 --> 01:00:15,653
The flowers?

736
01:00:16,705 --> 01:00:18,634
Yeah, I see them.

737
01:00:18,658 --> 01:00:20,617
That's how old I am.

738
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:25,889
No. No, no son.

739
01:00:26,391 --> 01:00:29,370
You're much older than those.

740
01:00:29,394 --> 01:00:31,896
Your body may be young, but...

741
01:00:33,899 --> 01:00:37,610
There. You see that picture?

742
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,534
Umm hmm.

743
01:00:42,824 --> 01:00:44,875
That's how old you are.

744
01:03:44,196 --> 01:03:46,041
Oh, shit!

745
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,410
Hi.

746
01:03:50,928 --> 01:03:52,522
You're still here?

747
01:03:54,014 --> 01:03:54,973
Yeah.

748
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:59,370
I think this place doesn't want me to leave.

749
01:04:01,439 --> 01:04:05,077
I forget. Are you Butt-Munch
or Sassy-Pants?

750
01:04:05,101 --> 01:04:07,269
Just Gary, ok?

751
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,438
Cool.

752
01:04:19,532 --> 01:04:21,408
Anything I can do?

753
01:04:27,815 --> 01:04:29,586
Wait, wait.

754
01:04:32,755 --> 01:04:33,505
Sup?

755
01:04:33,798 --> 01:04:35,273
Did you mean that?

756
01:04:35,725 --> 01:04:38,643
Sure. Absolutely.

757
01:04:56,163 --> 01:04:57,649
Have a seat.

758
01:04:59,057 --> 01:05:00,758
Is wine ok?

759
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:02,693
Wine's good.

760
01:05:09,235 --> 01:05:11,402
- Cheers
- Cheers

761
01:05:17,109 --> 01:05:18,578
So...

762
01:05:18,879 --> 01:05:20,489
How about some music?

763
01:05:20,513 --> 01:05:21,800
- Sure.
- Yeah?

764
01:05:22,221 --> 01:05:25,040
I got...I got a really good playlist.

765
01:05:33,747 --> 01:05:37,837
Wow...you're really here.

766
01:05:41,347 --> 01:05:45,053
When you walked into Leon's
I was like freakin' wow.

767
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:49,406
You know that..that feeling in your stomach,

768
01:05:51,214 --> 01:05:56,465
You never met some but you just
feel like you've known them for a long time.

769
01:05:59,025 --> 01:06:00,704
This is gonna sound really crazy.

770
01:06:03,317 --> 01:06:06,402
But I swear... I dreamed about you.

771
01:06:06,653 --> 01:06:08,487
- We just met like two hours ago.
- I know.

772
01:06:08,614 --> 01:06:09,780
That's the crazy part...

773
01:06:12,284 --> 01:06:14,512
Or creepy.
I don't mean to be creepy.

774
01:06:14,536 --> 01:06:18,372
No..it's cool.
What time is it?

775
01:06:18,624 --> 01:06:20,458
I do not know. I think it's too late.

776
01:06:22,961 --> 01:06:25,296
I'm never gonna get any sleep.

777
01:06:25,547 --> 01:06:27,406
Do you want to go?

778
01:06:40,521 --> 01:06:42,470
- Are you nervous?
- My God, yes!

779
01:06:42,882 --> 01:06:44,132
It's okay.

780
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:48,254
- Do I make you nervous?
- Yes.

781
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:49,680
Why?

782
01:06:49,973 --> 01:06:52,975
Because your'e so.. you're so beautiful.

783
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,344
To me.

784
01:06:58,181 --> 01:07:00,099
Thanks.

785
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:05,613
Can I ask you a question?

786
01:07:06,081 --> 01:07:08,040
Sure.

787
01:07:09,293 --> 01:07:11,252
Are you really hustler?

788
01:07:11,804 --> 01:07:13,346
Yep.

789
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:18,459
Did you ah.. did you really sleep with Jacob?

790
01:07:18,711 --> 01:07:20,295
I do not know. Who is Jacob?

791
01:07:20,546 --> 01:07:22,964
Dirk. Leon..Leon calls him Dirk.

792
01:07:24,401 --> 01:07:25,776
Oh, yeah.

793
01:07:28,489 --> 01:07:30,072
Yeah I did.

794
01:07:34,286 --> 01:07:35,369
You mind if I take this off?

795
01:07:35,621 --> 01:07:38,080
Yeah, I'm sorrry. Please. I'm sorry.

796
01:07:46,498 --> 01:07:47,665
Thanks.

797
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:51,461
So.. I have some money.

798
01:07:52,963 --> 01:07:54,005
Great.

799
01:07:54,223 --> 01:07:56,099
Do you think maybe you'd want tah...

800
01:07:57,068 --> 01:07:58,568
Sure.

801
01:07:58,995 --> 01:08:00,412
Ok.

802
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:00,270
So...

803
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,643
How much?

804
01:09:03,979 --> 01:09:05,896
Depends.

805
01:09:06,198 --> 01:09:07,809
What did you have in mind?

806
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:09,751
I..uh..

807
01:09:14,053 --> 01:09:16,883
I really want to kiss you.

808
01:09:17,384 --> 01:09:19,371
Come again.

809
01:09:19,395 --> 01:09:21,312
I said I wanted to kiss you.

810
01:09:23,716 --> 01:09:24,842
You're kidding, right?

811
01:09:26,193 --> 01:09:27,538
No.

812
01:09:27,562 --> 01:09:31,607
I'm sorry... I just..I don't kiss.

813
01:09:32,442 --> 01:09:34,610
How come?

814
01:09:34,861 --> 01:09:39,676
I do not know. It's too... It's so...
yuck ya know. It's too..

815
01:09:40,408 --> 01:09:41,528
Intimate?

816
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:43,469
Yeah.

817
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,638
It's too real.

818
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:47,148
Yeah.

819
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:55,823
- 100 bucks to make out with me.
- Dude!

820
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:59,761
I am a great kisser.
I am, I swear I am.

821
01:10:00,012 --> 01:10:02,013
I'm sure you are!

822
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:05,709
But...I mean you're a goodlooking guy.

823
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:07,503
You should find someone who'd...

824
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:10,339
But I want to kiss you.

825
01:10:11,184 --> 01:10:15,804
Umm..150? 160?

826
01:10:16,051 --> 01:10:17,377
Oh man are you..

827
01:10:17,691 --> 01:10:19,789
What...that's gotta  be more than
you made all night.

828
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:21,592
You have no idea how much
I made tonight.

829
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:25,722
- Why?
- Why what?

830
01:10:27,516 --> 01:10:29,851
Why me? Why now?

831
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,395
And don't say because you dreampt about me.

832
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,197
Because you're right, that is fucking creepy.

833
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,008
I mean..can't we just fuck?

834
01:10:37,009 --> 01:10:39,177
No, I don't want.... I don't want to fuck.

835
01:10:39,178 --> 01:10:40,178
I want to...

836
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:43,181
I want to kiss you.

837
01:10:44,651 --> 01:10:47,494
I want to kiss you. I want to kiss you deep.

838
01:10:47,512 --> 01:10:49,597
For like days.

839
01:10:53,168 --> 01:10:54,752
Why?

840
01:10:55,003 --> 01:10:59,048
Because if you kiss me, then I won't be alone.

841
01:11:00,033 --> 01:11:04,328
You know? Like..Alone, alone.

842
01:11:06,497 --> 01:11:09,472
Five fucking minutes.

843
01:11:10,895 --> 01:11:15,999
And then you'll leave, and you'll go..and..

844
01:11:16,334 --> 01:11:17,459
I can have that.

845
01:11:19,712 --> 01:11:22,881
Can I have that kiss,
I can remember that kiss.

846
01:11:23,817 --> 01:11:25,693
Because the kiss will be mine.

847
01:11:30,824 --> 01:11:32,992
Cuz I know that you're gonna touch my soul.

848
01:11:35,929 --> 01:11:39,473
That's..that's really where I
need to be touched right now. OK?

849
01:11:39,641 --> 01:11:41,601
Not on my cock, not my hole...

850
01:11:43,629 --> 01:11:47,257
Right here, right here. This is..this is my hole.

851
01:11:48,609 --> 01:11:50,359
And I'll pay for it.

852
01:11:50,744 --> 01:11:54,383
I'll gladly, happily fucking paying for it.

853
01:11:54,407 --> 01:11:56,408
You got your life savings in there?

854
01:11:57,101 --> 01:12:00,020
Here. 200, 200 bucks.

855
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:03,424
All you gotta do is make out with me.

856
01:12:06,327 --> 01:12:09,062
And what if I don't <i>touch your soul</i>?

857
01:12:10,598 --> 01:12:12,742
Make fun of me all you want.

858
01:12:12,751 --> 01:12:14,502
I'm not making fun of you.

859
01:12:16,088 --> 01:12:20,591
Dude, what if I can't?

860
01:12:21,745 --> 01:12:24,948
Well..that's a chance that I'm willing to take.

861
01:12:31,672 --> 01:12:32,200
Fine!

862
01:12:33,501 --> 01:12:35,501
So kissing it is.

863
01:12:36,142 --> 01:12:37,017
Really?

864
01:12:37,268 --> 01:12:40,771
Yep, really. Give me the fucking money.

865
01:12:46,778 --> 01:12:50,175
Alright. How do you want to do this?

866
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,366
Right here.

867
01:12:53,322 --> 01:12:53,935
Right here?

868
01:12:54,886 --> 01:12:56,804
Yeah.

869
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:13,071
Like that?

870
01:13:14,073 --> 01:13:16,032
No.

871
01:13:51,069 --> 01:13:52,428
What?

872
01:13:52,638 --> 01:13:54,472
You really are a good kisser.

873
01:13:56,392 --> 01:13:57,964
Come here.

874
01:14:35,729 --> 01:14:38,327
What? What?

875
01:14:39,386 --> 01:14:41,533
No one's ever kissed me like that before.

876
01:14:44,649 --> 01:14:45,518
Is it okay?

877
01:14:46,285 --> 01:14:48,537
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just that ah...

878
01:14:48,788 --> 01:14:50,622
What?

879
01:14:50,857 --> 01:14:52,816
Nothing.

880
01:15:25,159 --> 01:15:26,159
Feel that?

881
01:15:30,131 --> 01:15:32,049
I feel that, I feel that.

882
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,167
Kiss me.

883
01:16:55,503 --> 01:16:56,420
Holy shit!

884
01:17:06,848 --> 01:17:10,288
- Holy shit!
- Right?!

885
01:17:10,536 --> 01:17:12,203
I can't believe I came like that.

886
01:17:12,454 --> 01:17:15,748
Me too, me too.

887
01:17:35,169 --> 01:17:36,712
Are you going to sleep?

888
01:17:36,863 --> 01:17:39,532
No. I'm awake.

889
01:17:44,503 --> 01:17:46,838
I can hear your heart.

890
01:17:47,174 --> 01:17:51,052
Umm..I'm loving this too ok, but my
leg's asleep.

891
01:17:52,804 --> 01:17:54,866
Sorry.

892
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:03,356
Head rush.

893
01:18:37,318 --> 01:18:40,111
Hey, wash up.

894
01:18:40,905 --> 01:18:42,906
Thanks.

895
01:18:46,577 --> 01:18:48,578
Hey, right here, right here.

896
01:18:52,408 --> 01:18:53,951
Score.

897
01:18:54,285 --> 01:18:55,945
Save that for later.

898
01:19:01,167 --> 01:19:03,001
Got what you wanted?

899
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:09,091
Yeah. I did.

900
01:19:12,337 --> 01:19:14,172
I feel whole again, you know?

901
01:19:26,018 --> 01:19:28,478
What?

902
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:32,782
<i>I raise up in the current of my  love.</i>

903
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:41,456
<i>Borne high by this shower of light.</i>

904
01:19:45,005 --> 01:19:47,006
<i>Full of you.</i>

905
01:19:49,376 --> 01:19:50,293
<i>And lost.</i>

906
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:59,552
<i>And then the light reaches my eyes.</i>

907
01:20:02,473 --> 01:20:06,601
<i>Glances off the mirror of my soul.</i>

908
01:20:10,256 --> 01:20:13,592
<i>And I am united once again.</i>

909
01:20:15,595 --> 01:20:17,596
Did you write that?

910
01:20:17,948 --> 01:20:20,950
No, but... but I'm going to.

911
01:21:15,549 --> 01:21:17,317
Who is this?

912
01:21:17,976 --> 01:21:19,294
Oh..It's me!

913
01:21:21,431 --> 01:21:23,181
Yeah I got that from my mom's house.

914
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:27,811
It reminds me of..me. I don't know.

915
01:21:40,517 --> 01:21:44,228
You got me all...inspired here.

916
01:21:53,463 --> 01:21:55,540
Hey, you know, you can crash here if you want.

917
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:59,919
No, no. Umm..I gotta get going.

918
01:22:00,521 --> 01:22:02,772
I gotta keep moving.

919
01:22:23,486 --> 01:22:25,028
Here.

920
01:22:27,957 --> 01:22:29,958
What's this?

921
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:33,378
It is a..a griffin.

922
01:22:34,448 --> 01:22:37,408
It's magic...from the sun.

923
01:22:38,811 --> 01:22:40,747
It guards the treasure.

924
01:22:40,771 --> 01:22:41,821
It's good luck!

925
01:22:42,064 --> 01:22:46,146
OK. Thank you.

926
01:22:58,998 --> 01:23:00,248
Sayonara.

927
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:04,065
Oh..How the fuck do I get out of this place?

928
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:10,986
Just turn to your right, and then stairs
to the lobby, and out the door.

929
01:23:12,412 --> 01:23:14,288
Simple as that?

930
01:23:14,748 --> 01:23:16,665
Simple as that.

931
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:21,529
Cool.

932
01:23:25,142 --> 01:23:28,353
