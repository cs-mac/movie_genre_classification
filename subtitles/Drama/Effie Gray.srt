00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once a beautiful young girl lived in a
very cold house in Scotland.</font>

2
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The house was cold because someone's
grandfather killed himself there.</font>

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One day the grandson came to visit the house ...</font>

4
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he thought the beautiful young girl was an angel,
come down to earth.</font>

5
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The grandson worked very hard.</font>

6
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He read, and thought, and drew, and wrote.</font>

7
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wrote a fairy story, just for her.</font>

8
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was twelve years old.</font>

9
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her mother and father were kind,
but his were wicked.</font>

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When she grew up, he married her.</font>

11
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come now.
- You can't marry him.</font>

12
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?
When I love him so much.</font>

13
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's rich and famous,
and I'll never see you again.</font>

14
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, away with you!
You'll come and stay in London.</font>

15
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In London, Sophie, I'm leaving dreary
old Scotland at last.</font>

16
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you'll follow...</font>

17
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we'll go to parties in beautiful yellow dresses...</font>

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we will dance with musicians,
poets and great artists,</font>

19
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who'll want to paint your picture.</font>

20
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really?
- Yes, really.</font>

21
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's going to be so exciting. Come on ...</font>

22
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need more leaves for our pillows.</font>

23
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can my dress be pink?</font>

24
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nature must rule every stroke of your brush,</font>

25
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">only representing her as she truly is,</font>

26
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">selecting nothing, stalling nothing.</font>

27
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you reveal the truth of life.</font>

28
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To put it simply, gentlemen, paint what you see,</font>

29
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">draw what you see.</font>

30
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give thanks to the Lord for the gift of marriage.</font>

31
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we ask the Lord's grace that the marriage be enriched.</font>

32
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And in the presence of God and before these witnesses,</font>

33
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I now pronounce you ...</font>

34
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">man...</font>

35
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and wife.</font>

36
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Blessings to you both, sir.
- Thank you so much.</font>

37
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friends ...</font>

38
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">consider me a man who is not an artist.</font>

39
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But has none the less been granted a muse.</font>

40
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Consider this man,</font>

41
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the luckiest of mortals.</font>

42
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bound to you in spirit,</font>

43
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from this moment forth.</font>

44
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sophie!</font>

45
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shall see you in London.</font>

46
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye!</font>

47
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what has just occurred to me?</font>

48
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the first time we've
ever been entirely alone.</font>

49
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close your eyes.</font>

50
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect.</font>

51
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Here we are, sir.
- Thank Alfred.</font>

52
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to Denmark Hill.</font>

53
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No ...</font>

54
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">welcome home.</font>

55
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, George, there you are.</font>

56
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here is your new mistress.</font>

57
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be shy, take her by the hand.</font>

58
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is an excellent chap.  Full of wise saws.</font>

59
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell them we're here.
There's a good fellow.</font>

60
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dearest George...</font>

61
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations, welcome to the family.</font>

62
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How happy we are to see you wed at last.
- Thank You.</font>

63
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The journey, I trust, was tolerable.</font>

64
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The train journey was dreadfully long and draughty.</font>

65
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But every discomfort forgotten
as soon as we got into your carriage.</font>

66
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is a most comfortable carriage is it not?
The best on the market.</font>

67
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Like a feather bed.
- Come, through...</font>

68
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John...</font>

69
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Ruskin is just putting him into a bath.</font>

70
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's been aching to get her hands on him.
Now come through.</font>

71
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should change.</font>

72
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, of course...
but plenty of time for that.</font>

73
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, come through and see this.</font>

74
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this was purchased in celebration
of your nuptials.</font>

75
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John's writing has made
Mr. Turner so celebrated...</font>

76
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know this painting is already worth
a great deal more.</font>

77
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bless, Oh Lord this poison before us
That it make us ever mindful of the wants and needs of others.</font>

78
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bless us all and keep us from harm.</font>

79
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guide and direct us through all our days,
and thank The Lord,</font>

80
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for delivering my heart's treasure
safely back home.</font>

81
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Amen.
- Amen.</font>

82
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Amen.
- Amen.</font>

83
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are well recovered I hope, Mrs. Ruskin,</font>

84
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we missed you at the wedding.</font>

85
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a shame that you couldn't be there.</font>

86
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never mind, never mind, it's all over now.</font>

87
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look a little thinner than last year, my dear.</font>

88
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been ill, my father's difficulties
have put a strain on us all.</font>

89
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well that strain is gone ...</font>

90
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll never want for money again.</font>

91
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You however, my boy, are somewhat
stouter than when you left.</font>

92
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Scots air must have done you good.</font>

93
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nonsense! You can't be well in Scotland.</font>

94
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your cough will last you through winter. Will it not?</font>

95
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am much improved...</font>

96
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and stronger.</font>

97
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've even started painting again.</font>

98
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John drew me constantly,
he must have destroyed a fortune in paper and paint.</font>

99
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who would not, with such a subject?</font>

100
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For you, my dear.
In welcome to our family.</font>

101
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of my favourite pieces.</font>

102
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which you may as well have now, since it would
in any case be left to you when I die.</font>

103
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no.</font>

104
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let her ...</font>

105
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what mothers are like.</font>

106
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning, madam. I trust you slept?</font>

107
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would you like?</font>

108
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Has everyone else already breakfasted?</font>

109
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes madam, at 7:00. Every morning.</font>

110
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was not told.</font>

111
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was so tired I did not hear John.</font>

112
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not to worry, madam.</font>

113
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eggs?</font>

114
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you ... Oh, Anna.</font>

115
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, madam.</font>

116
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know where John ...</font>

117
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where Mr. Ruskin is?</font>

118
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll be working, madam.</font>

119
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Effie.</font>

120
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John.</font>

121
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew this must be where you work, sorry...</font>

122
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ... I'm sorry, I broke it.</font>

123
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see, no matter.</font>

124
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you sleep?</font>

125
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you did...</font>

126
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I watched you.</font>

127
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you not sleep? You were so tired.</font>

128
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did. I did, after a while.</font>

129
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What shall we do?</font>

130
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do married people do?</font>

131
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have as little idea as you.</font>

132
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I think I must work, my dearest.</font>

133
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shall sit with you and read, then.</font>

134
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dearest, you will be quite bored here.</font>

135
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you go find mama?
I think she needs help in the garden.</font>

136
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good Morning.
- Good morning, my child.</font>

137
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I trust you slept.
- Well, thank you.</font>

138
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Have you breakfasted?
- I have, thank you.</font>

139
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John said you needed help.</font>

140
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me? Oh, no, no, no.
I never let anyone touch my roses ...</font>

141
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John knows that.</font>

142
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

143
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I should go help John.</font>

144
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help him?</font>

145
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With his work.</font>

146
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cannot help him with his work.</font>

147
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can take notes, I can sharpen his pencils
I can...</font>

148
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:20,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My Dear ...
you have married no ordinary man.</font>

149
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the best way, the only way
in which you can help him,</font>

150
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is by leaving him alone.</font>

151
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leaving him alone?
But, we're only just married.</font>

152
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John being able to work
undisturbed and unfettered,</font>

153
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">affords him the best chance of
establishing his name.</font>

154
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you, of course, want  the best
position in society that you can reach.</font>

155
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, what am I to do?</font>

156
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I've always found great comfort
in my roses...</font>

157
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and my Bible.</font>

158
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I believe that these young artists to
be at the most critical period of their career.</font>

159
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At a turning point from which they may either sink,</font>

160
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">into nothingness, or to rise to very real greatness.</font>

161
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their path will depend upon the
character of the criticism which their works,</font>

162
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have to sustain.</font>

163
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We shall be late.</font>

164
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marriage, dear boy, is all about learning how to wait.</font>

165
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's ready.</font>

166
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time for a little word, I think.</font>

167
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying to find ...</font>

168
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">truth,</font>

169
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and simplicity from an earlier time,</font>

170
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an integrity I think is lost now.</font>

171
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The general public would laugh at the sight
of it and lead the academy into disrepute...</font>

172
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which must and will not be allowed.</font>

173
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:02,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no place, sir, for these
offensive and deformed productions,</font>

174
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">upon the hallowed walls of this great institution.</font>

175
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen, please.</font>

176
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This most interesting discussion
can continue at the table.</font>

177
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lady Eastlake.</font>

178
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:32,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say that it's incumbent on you, Sir Charles,
as president of this Academy,</font>

179
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to protect us from this ugliness. Confusion.</font>

180
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take down the paintings before the opening,
I implore you.</font>

181
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not indulge in them, they are nothing
more than childish mountebanks and amateurs.</font>

182
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Remove them, sir. Remove them
- They disgrace these walls.</font>

183
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen, please, please ...</font>

184
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. Now...</font>

185
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is the purpose of art ...?</font>

186
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is the purpose of art?</font>

187
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To idealize? To sentimentalize?</font>

188
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, of course not!</font>

189
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The purpose of art is to reveal the truth.</font>

190
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The purpose of art is to reveal God.</font>

191
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But not through caricature.</font>

192
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not through ugliness.</font>

193
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let him speak.
- Let's hear what he has to say.</font>

194
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If God is the creator of nature,</font>

195
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then God is also the creator of decay,</font>

196
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of disease, of ugliness.</font>

197
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot deny that Mr. Hansilvya,</font>

198
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:39,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is not a person with whom Protheus, or anyone
else for that matter, is likely to fall in love, but</font>

199
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">truthfulness, honesty,</font>

200
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">these are more important than
mere conventional beauty.</font>

201
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you understand?
He was painting what he saw.</font>

202
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what you see, Mr. Ruskin?
Tell us what you see.</font>

203
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see nothing less than eternal truth ...</font>

204
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see God.</font>

205
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These men, these visionary men,</font>

206
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see a school of art nobler,
than the world has produced in 300 years.</font>

207
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's ridiculous.</font>

208
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They're imitators.
- Medieval copiers.</font>

209
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Ruskin,</font>

210
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think that painting pleases God?</font>

211
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All great art ...</font>

212
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">praises God.</font>

213
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:44,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If His own nature pleases Him,
then it follows, so must we.</font>

214
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must confess to finding this addiction
to an antique-style backward looking.</font>

215
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done dear, that was an interesting question,</font>

216
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and bravely spoken.</font>

217
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never mind God, what do
you think of their daubs?</font>

218
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do not know what I think, I just like them,</font>

219
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they make me feel happy.</font>

220
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I cannot remember the last time
I felt happy in this place.</font>

221
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ghastly collection of self-congratulatory males,</font>

222
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it was such a relief to hear
an intelligent female voice.</font>

223
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you do? ... I'm Eff ...</font>

224
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean Mrs. John Ruskin.</font>

225
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know who you are, but who are you
when you are not Mrs. John Ruskin?</font>

226
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Elizabeth.</font>

227
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Eff ... Euphemia.</font>

228
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sad business isn't it, having to lose your own name,</font>

229
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then taking your husband's
Christian name into the bargain?</font>

230
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Fortunately I do not have that cross to bear.
- Why is that?</font>

231
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lady Eastlake.
- Thank You.</font>

232
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Your husband is ...
- President of the Academy. Yes.</font>

233
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank You.
He absolutely hates the pictures, by the way.</font>

234
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he respects your husband's opinion,
as I respect yours.</font>

235
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must have us to dine.</font>

236
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good,  well then I shall hold you to it.</font>

237
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It sounds as if it went well.
- As well as can be expected.</font>

238
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have agreed to leave the paintings in place.</font>

239
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lady Eastlake was so kind, and I didn't
even know who she was at first.</font>

240
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lady Eastlake?</font>

241
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John congratulations, you've won the fight.</font>

242
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must be proud, surely.</font>

243
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We discussed detail.
All I know for certain is it'll take me 3 days to recover.</font>

244
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are so many demands on you from all sides,</font>

245
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure everyone always wanting something.</font>

246
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Intolerable for you, my darling.</font>

247
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My heart's treasure - come.</font>

248
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I forgot to say ...</font>

249
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lady Eastlake has asked me to
invite them to dine here.</font>

250
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dine here? The Eastlakes?</font>

251
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John.</font>

252
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

253
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not poor, are we?</font>

254
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Poor? Not remotely.</font>

255
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What on earth made you ask?</font>

256
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just making sure of something.</font>

257
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What something?</font>

258
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That we are not too poor to have children.</font>

259
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are but a child yourself, dear.</font>

260
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not.</font>

261
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not a child, I am a married woman.</font>

262
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when we live together as husband and wife...</font>

263
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are husband and wife.</font>

264
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, but alone.</font>

265
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I should love to keep house for you.</font>

266
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our own house, with a good size nursery.</font>

267
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In town, to attain some hold of good society.</font>

268
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be in charge of all our domestic matters.</font>

269
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will become the wife that you desire.</font>

270
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I help you, madam?</font>

271
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes Anna, thank you.</font>

272
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was looking for a needle and
thread for John's shirt.</font>

273
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It needs mending.</font>

274
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm sorry madam,</font>

275
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know how I could have missed that!</font>

276
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave it here, I'll do it right away.</font>

277
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will do it.</font>

278
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madam it has always been my job to do
young Mr. Ruskin's mending.</font>

279
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not any more ...</font>

280
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am his wife,</font>

281
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shall look after his things.</font>

282
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Anna.</font>

283
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At you wish, madam.</font>

284
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, my dear ...</font>

285
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm quite an expert mender,
John's shirt will be as good as new.</font>

286
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If mama needed anything mending,
socks, babies napkins,</font>

287
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was always the one she asked.</font>

288
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John does not wear babies napkins.</font>

289
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I know that. Of course not. I just ...</font>

290
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dear, I'm sure you mean well.</font>

291
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But do not insult by suggesting that
we would make our son...</font>

292
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wear darned socks.</font>

293
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You forget where you are.</font>

294
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course not, forgive me.</font>

295
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You forget who you are.</font>

296
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anna!</font>

297
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aaah! G...</font>

298
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John?</font>

299
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Ruskin says you should take this.</font>

300
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

301
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Emetic. She swears by it.</font>

302
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's in it?
- I do not know, madam.</font>

303
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She means to poison me, I will not take it.</font>

304
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Ruskin was most determined.</font>

305
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lady Eastlake, Sir Charles.</font>

306
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You honour us.</font>

307
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have been trying unsuccessfully to
congratulate your son,</font>

308
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on his wonderful new writings.</font>

309
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which are no more than a retched rant.</font>

310
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course John, we're here to congratulate
you on your fascinating new wife.</font>

311
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, new to me, at any rate.
Where is she?</font>

312
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I shock her so profoundly
when we first met?</font>

313
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you excuse me?</font>

314
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

315
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is she not dressed?!</font>

316
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will get up and dress, now!</font>

317
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm ill, my head...</font>

318
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are not ill. You are just peevish,</font>

319
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you've had your medicine. Now get up!</font>

320
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She will be dressed and downstairs in 5 minutes,</font>

321
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or I will want to know the reason why.</font>

322
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, Euphemia, there you are.</font>

323
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dear girl, what on earth is the matter?
You're white as the teeth.</font>

324
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

325
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indeed I'm very well.</font>

326
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come, sit down.</font>

327
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles was just telling us about
the excellent response,</font>

328
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to John's new book, Euphemia.</font>

329
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do continue, Sir Charles.</font>

330
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As I say, the reaction has been overwhelming,</font>

331
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he's been called the greatest teacher of our day.</font>

332
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive me, Charles, but this girl does not need,</font>

333
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to hear about her husband's triumph.</font>

334
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just now what she needs is a
cup of beef tea and bed.</font>

335
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think so? Euphemia, dear.
Are you so very ill?</font>

336
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There. Will you excuse me?</font>

337
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come, come ... Come...</font>

338
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a headache, your ladyship. I'm so very sorry.</font>

339
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is just the married life, more like.</font>

340
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me, Effie. Do you have anyone to talk to?</font>

341
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I keep thinking I've made a terrible mistake.</font>

342
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought so too, at the beginning of my marriage.</font>

343
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beginnings are always difficult, my dear.</font>

344
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we have not yet begun.</font>

345
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They won't let us.</font>

346
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will not always live here.</font>

347
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is a temporary arrangement, surely?</font>

348
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They want me here, I'm sure of that.</font>

349
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have always had it to themselves.</font>

350
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know that they would not even
let him play with other children when he was little?</font>

351
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She took rooms near him at University,</font>

352
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they saw each other every day.</font>

353
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll never let him away from her.</font>

354
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dear child, it is unreasonable for
the pair of you not to have a home of your own.</font>

355
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, for being so kind.</font>

356
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh there, there, now. You are a strong,
wise girl and you will bare heart.</font>

357
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I must ask you to banish all thoughts
of having made a mistake, from your mind.</font>

358
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what if I have?</font>

359
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I'm sorry to say, my dear, that it's a mistake
you'll have to live with.</font>

360
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no going back.</font>

361
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No ... no, of course not.</font>

362
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:23,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, you know what will set everything
to rights quite naturally?</font>

363
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Children. They are the glue that binds all marriages.</font>

364
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you ever forgive me?</font>

365
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

366
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But If you ever take me there again,
I'll have you thrown in the Thames.</font>

367
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your poor mother is in floods.</font>

368
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was nothing I could do.</font>

369
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God knows. We've protected you with
every sinew in our bodies,</font>

370
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from childhood, from all the obstructions,</font>

371
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that might have prevented your
unique talent from emerging to the full.</font>

372
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you succeeded.</font>

373
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But every talent, however unique, needs its patrons.</font>

374
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And tonight, for the first time,</font>

375
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The President of the Academy, himself,</font>

376
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the greatest patron any man of the arts could wish for,</font>

377
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">graces our house,</font>

378
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and your wife is unable, or unwilling,</font>

379
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to make the effort required to make it a success.</font>

380
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careers have foundered on less, John.</font>

381
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry to be a disappointment to you both.</font>

382
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were warned about that girl,
yet you chose to follow your own path.</font>

383
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's up to you, to ensure that this does</font>

384
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not lead to the destruction of
everything we have wished for you.</font>

385
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look sad. You didn't actually
want coffee, did you?</font>

386
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, it was just ...</font>

387
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That poor child I was interested in seeing.</font>

388
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And she's not happy.
- No more were you in the beginning.</font>

389
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's exactly what I told her.</font>

390
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Very grim, you were.
- Well you were pompous.</font>

391
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- True.
- And distant.</font>

392
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is something more complicated,</font>

393
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">somehow she has to get him
away from their clutches.</font>

394
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh heavens, you make them sound
like dragons in a fairy tale.</font>

395
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I? I don't mean to, but...</font>

396
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">perhaps that's not so far from the truth.</font>

397
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was it he was saying to you about Venice?</font>

398
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he's not taking his parents, I hope!</font>

399
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John...</font>

400
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for bringing us here.</font>

401
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lady Eastlake told me we'll answer to her for</font>

402
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We are to look after you.
- Essato.</font>

403
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Grazie, thank you sir.
- You are most kind, countess.</font>

404
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, not kind...It's not often that you
have new blood here.</font>

405
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to send letters,</font>

406
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'd be invited to every party.</font>

407
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see you don't like parties.</font>

408
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... am in Venice to work-- to write a new book.</font>

409
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I detest parties. In fact, it is impossible for
me to go into company without injury.</font>

410
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My wife will be the hostess for them.</font>

411
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfecto.</font>

412
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? What's everyone saying?</font>

413
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are saying that your husband
disapproves of pleasure, but that you do not.</font>

414
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would like... I would like to buy some cheese".</font>

415
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would like to buy some cheese.</font>

416
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would like to buy some cheese.</font>

417
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bravo!
- Wonderful!</font>

418
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your accent is divine - say it again.</font>

419
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would like to buy some cheese.</font>

420
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Again, again ...</font>

421
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would like to buy some cheese.</font>

422
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank You.</font>

423
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now.</font>

424
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's better.</font>

425
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up you go...</font>

426
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not one eye lifted to this splendour.</font>

427
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this.</font>

428
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is like the wind itself could have chiselled it.</font>

429
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look how tenderly ...</font>

430
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that one is utterly different to this one.</font>

431
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The variety itself is joyful, is it not?
- Yes.</font>

432
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now look down there, what do you see?</font>

433
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks very beautiful,</font>

434
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but in a regular way,</font>

435
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a uniform way.</font>

436
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a world where all the
trees are the same shape,</font>

437
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all the clouds the same size,
and all the people say the same thing,</font>

438
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over and over again.</font>

439
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's perfectly executed, but ...</font>

440
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">entirely devoid of this ...</font>

441
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">beautiful imperfection.</font>

442
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then imperfection's your ideal,</font>

443
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then you must think me very beautiful.</font>

444
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look what I found.</font>

445
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over half a life ago.</font>

446
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you remember?</font>

447
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is she turning into a tree?</font>

448
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She is the nymph Daphne.</font>

449
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is the god Apollo.</font>

450
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wants her with an overwhelming desire,
he wants to possess her purity,</font>

451
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she does not want him.</font>

452
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And turns herself into a laurel tree in order to escape.</font>

453
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a clever trick.</font>

454
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is, nymphs are very clever.</font>

455
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

456
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is much more difficult than it looks.</font>

457
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me ...</font>

458
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, don't. I am getting better.</font>

459
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're already working?</font>

460
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

461
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you enjoy the ball?</font>

462
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did.</font>

463
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I danced and danced.</font>

464
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bloom, I would perish.</font>

465
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What will your book say?</font>

466
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will say that Venice was once,</font>

467
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the most glorious, the truest,</font>

468
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the most chased pearl.</font>

469
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Adam's Eve, but now that she has fallen</font>

470
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from that grace.</font>

471
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her dissipation and corruption
are almost complete.</font>

472
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

473
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, that once she was a virgin...</font>

474
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now she is a harlot,</font>

475
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">addicted nothing but pleasure and voluptuousness.</font>

476
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A beautiful harlot,</font>

477
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but a harlot none-the-less.</font>

478
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see that? They are talking about us.</font>

479
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I call them the "whisperers".</font>

480
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our dancing will be on the news.</font>

481
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope your husband is prepared.</font>

482
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My husband cannot hear whispers,
he's so far above them.</font>

483
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I never forget my duty to him,
not for an instant.</font>

484
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:50,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, I have no talent whatever for intrigue.</font>

485
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, the hand like this.</font>

486
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! ... No! ...</font>

487
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, stop.
- Kiss Me.</font>

488
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's play.</font>

489
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Effie.</font>

490
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you back already?</font>

491
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes ...</font>

492
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was tired.</font>

493
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you lie down?</font>

494
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will.</font>

495
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:55,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Ruskin, do you by any chance, happen to
know what was in that treatment of your mother's?</font>

496
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do not, she swears by them always has done.</font>

497
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well ... I think that laudanum in
them is a perfectly sensible treatment ...</font>

498
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and in this case.</font>

499
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long has she been unwell for?</font>

500
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Almost constantly,</font>

501
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a never ending succession of minor ailments.</font>

502
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This particular one.
It came to a head a few months ago.</font>

503
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Came to a head.
How was it manifested?</font>

504
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hysteria, seeing things,</font>

505
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">growing upon her person.</font>

506
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Such as?</font>

507
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mere phantasms of a disordered brain, doctor...</font>

508
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None-the-less, such as?</font>

509
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Organic matter ... bark ...</font>

510
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tree bark?
- Just, so.</font>

511
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Interesting.</font>

512
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's undoubtedly a nervous complaint,</font>

513
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that would account for the hair loss.</font>

514
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hair loss?
- Have not you noticed?</font>

515
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here ...</font>

516
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and here.</font>

517
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I recommend the following,</font>

518
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:23,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">fresh air, exercise, a wholesome environment,</font>

519
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:28,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">perhaps away from the influence of
the elder Mrs. Ruskin.</font>

520
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's Scottish by birth, I hear?</font>

521
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps some time in her native land
might be beneficial.</font>

522
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I prescribe, an iron tonic for her.</font>

523
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And for you.
- There's nothing wrong with me!</font>

524
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For you, I prescribe a
sharper eye and keener ear.</font>

525
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In my opinion, there is
nothing wrong with your wife,</font>

526
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:01,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that simple love and
attention will not cure.</font>

527
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you looking at?</font>

528
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>

529
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you thinking of, then?</font>

530
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A great many things.</font>

531
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was thinking of dancing,</font>

532
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">excitement.</font>

533
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And a great many things.</font>

534
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Millais ... hello.</font>

535
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've not seen you grace these halls for some time.
Are you well?</font>

536
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ought to be and I feel great success, for which ...</font>

537
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">may I congratulate you, heartily?</font>

538
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, your ladyship.</font>

539
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I am thriving
- Thriving, and painting?</font>

540
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes, in fact I am recently commissioned.</font>

541
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh good, that is good.
- It is.</font>

542
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm proud to say that I'm to paint
our champion, himself.</font>

543
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm to paint Mr. Ruskin.</font>

544
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Ruskin? Really?</font>

545
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can hardly believe my luck.
We are to depart for Scotland shortly.</font>

546
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scotland?</font>

547
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, his wife is from there you know?
- I did know, I did know, yes.</font>

548
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How is she?
- Well ...</font>

549
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:09,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least I do not know, I believe we're to go there
for the sake of her health.</font>

550
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scotland?</font>

551
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready?</font>

552
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah! Damn!</font>

553
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fear not brave companions,</font>

554
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">breakfast is at hand!</font>

555
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't move.
- What?</font>

556
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. I mean it! Don't Move!</font>

557
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That light ... that's the light I want.</font>

558
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not floating through the middle
of a Scottish loch, Everett.</font>

559
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:06,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That angle, exactly that angle, and water, and ...</font>

560
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">exactly that light.</font>

561
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excellent. Can put my shoes on then?</font>

562
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may.</font>

563
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It really is, very good of you to come, Everett...</font>

564
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you've no idea.</font>

565
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:29,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps you have ... you can see.</font>

566
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, good of me?</font>

567
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But for your belief in me,</font>

568
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd still be starving in my garret.</font>

569
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:43,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Added to which your father is paying me handsomely for this.</font>

570
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Euclid, Everett.</font>

571
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Essential.</font>

572
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:58,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will start by reading him,
and then we will further your studies.</font>

573
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ah, Mr. McPhail. Where do you want this?
- Thank you.</font>

574
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everett.</font>

575
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let joy be unconfined!</font>

576
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There's the post. Now lunch.
- Thank You.</font>

577
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:30,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not as white as I hoped, but ... it will do.</font>

578
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:38,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shall we?
- Lunch first. Aren't you hungry?</font>

579
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is wrong?</font>

580
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've heard some bad news?</font>

581
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My poor mother,</font>

582
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She has lost her child,</font>

583
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the seventh.</font>

584
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do not know how she bares it.</font>

585
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry.</font>

586
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to lay out the lunch.</font>

587
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is Effie?</font>

588
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think she is improving,</font>

589
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the air and the exercise are doing her good.</font>

590
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, has she recovered from the news?</font>

591
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What news?</font>

592
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The loss of the child.
- The child? What child?</font>

593
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:10,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Gray, her mother.
The loss of her child.</font>

594
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:14,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's lost another, then.
What is that now, 5?</font>

595
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 7.
- 7! Dear me.</font>

596
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did Effie not say?</font>

597
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:30,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her mother loses children with such ghastly regularity
I think she realises it would hardly register with me.</font>

598
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a little harsh, surely?</font>

599
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:33,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not at all.</font>

600
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The woman is positively barnyard
in her breeding habits,</font>

601
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she can hardly expect them all to survive.</font>

602
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that exquisite leafage.</font>

603
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:52,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll need to be on your highest metal,
Everett, to capture that.</font>

604
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

605
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You realize I can open
the window, close the curtains,</font>

606
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and wash without getting out of bed.</font>

607
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like living in a snuff-box.</font>

608
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you hear John?</font>

609
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should we start out early, Everett?</font>

610
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everett?</font>

611
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes,...Yes, first thing.</font>

612
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't go on my fingers refusing to bend.</font>

613
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come ... let me help.</font>

614
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've not done two inches of work.</font>

615
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Everett?</font>

616
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's just behind me, he fell.</font>

617
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened?</font>

618
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I slipped off the boat.</font>

619
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go and have a look.</font>

620
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't break my nose.</font>

621
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Am I hurting you?
- No....</font>

622
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not at all...</font>

623
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why can't you have a broken nose?</font>

624
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

625
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:28,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said, "I cannot have a broken nose", outside.</font>

626
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:32,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I? How odd of me.</font>

627
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:39,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, it's only because I use my
own face as a model all the time.</font>

628
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's cheaper than hiring someone.</font>

629
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:47,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, my nose is quite useful.</font>

630
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:54,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you need it to smell things with.</font>

631
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That too, of course.</font>

632
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There ... no more.</font>

633
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:52,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The secret is to know when to stop.</font>

634
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is exquisite.</font>

635
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't tease.</font>

636
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:05,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would resent such talent,
if you were not so ... angelic.</font>

637
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your nose is perfect again.</font>

638
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:23,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please do not remind me of
my inexcusable self-regard.</font>

639
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finished.</font>

640
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My Edinburgh lectures.</font>

641
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She won't want to come, truly.</font>

642
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:11,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would bore her ... anyway I'll only be gone
for a few days, and it is but a stone's throw.</font>

643
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:15,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But are you not anxious about
leaving her alone?</font>

644
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why? Where are you going?</font>

645
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm not going anywhere.
- Then she won't be alone.</font>

646
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John, you can't leave her
on her own with me.</font>

647
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:25,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I realize it's a bore, Everett.</font>

648
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not at all.
I'm talking about the impropriety.</font>

649
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, for Heaven's sake.</font>

650
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, have Mrs. McPhail to stay then,
if you're worried the locals will take offence.</font>

651
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not worried about the locals.</font>

652
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John, you seem to pay no mind to
the safety of your wife's reputation.</font>

653
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:45,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To leave her entirely alone with another man,</font>

654
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a single man.</font>

655
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd have loved this when I was little.</font>

656
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was all so flat where I grew up.</font>

657
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you love it very much?
- I did.</font>

658
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you see that little thorn tree?</font>

659
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fairies live under those trees,
my mother told me.</font>

660
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:25,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believed her absolutely.
I'd take my breakfast out and leave it for them.</font>

661
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:29,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And of course, in the morning it
was always eaten by a fox,</font>

662
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:33,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">... or some such, which only went
to prove their existence further.</font>

663
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One Christmas, my mother cooked a ham.</font>

664
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought the fairies should have some, so...</font>

665
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I went to the pantry to cut a slice
and couldn't manage it,</font>

666
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I just took the entire hock.</font>

667
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was found out, of course,</font>

668
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that was the end of the fairies.</font>

669
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But happiness for the foxes.</font>

670
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:58,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over a thousand at every lecture,
it was a huge success.</font>

671
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:03,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the price was crippling headaches.</font>

672
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:18,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I hope Effie was not too trying for you?
- Of course not.</font>

673
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:23,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Women should depend on themselves
for engrossing employment.</font>

674
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:28,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rather than constantly craving
companionship and attention.</font>

675
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

676
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where have you been?</font>

677
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ran.</font>

678
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:26,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ran where?
- Anywhere.</font>

679
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wherever my feet took me.</font>

680
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:36,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For heavens' sake, you must change your clothes
or you'll make yourself sick.</font>

681
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:41,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am sick, I'm sickened by him.</font>

682
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know how you bare it.</font>

683
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot bare to witness
any more of your torture,</font>

684
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I cannot stop it,
when I cannot do anything.</font>

685
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me, Effie,
what am I supposed to do?</font>

686
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I can do?</font>

687
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is nothing to be done.</font>

688
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will return to London,</font>

689
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Venice engravings for my book are ready.</font>

690
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I cannot go back.
- We will leave on Monday.</font>

691
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot go back!</font>

692
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:55,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The pains of eternal torment would be no worse
than returning to Denmark Hill with you.</font>

693
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:01,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did not ask your opinion, but I merely
informed you of our leaving.</font>

694
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot go back.</font>

695
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not think for a moment that your behaviour here
has escaped my attention. It has not.</font>

696
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have seen what you try to hide.</font>

697
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:17,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really want to lose
your reputation in the world?</font>

698
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:22,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would make a great piece of work
for your bankrupt father.</font>

699
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:27,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not push me any further, Euphemia.</font>

700
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For your own sake.</font>

701
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate you.</font>

702
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:56,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's been listening, he's been watching,</font>

703
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he knows.</font>

704
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:02,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does he mean to ruin me?
To compromise me?</font>

705
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can never visit you in Denmark Hill.</font>

706
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:13,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to have someone with you.
Can you think of anyone?</font>

707
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know ...</font>

708
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- perhaps my sister Sophie.
- Yes.</font>

709
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her visit will not arouse suspicion.</font>

710
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you must arrange it.</font>

711
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mr. McPhail, we are ready.
- Aye ready, sir.</font>

712
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everett, would you help my wife?</font>

713
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:34,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't do that, dear.</font>

714
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:38,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes you sound like an imbecile.</font>

715
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:49,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A New Year is upon us and we have
yet to receive Mr. Millais' portrait.</font>

716
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think in January I may find some time to sit with him.</font>

717
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No matter I am truly eager to see it.</font>

718
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:03,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or perhaps, my dear, you can mention it
next time you write to him.</font>

719
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do not write to him.</font>

720
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:27,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a new addition to our cellar, my dear.</font>

721
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:33,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought we'd better start to educate
our palates to the nuances,</font>

722
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:37,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the German wines before our trip.</font>

723
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">White wine?</font>

724
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:41,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going on a trip?</font>

725
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are all going.</font>

726
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm to go?</font>

727
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But no one said ...</font>

728
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let us not start discussing something
that was settled months ago.</font>

729
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:27,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know why you feel Sophie needs
to see the sites in town.</font>

730
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What on Earth is wrong with Peckham?</font>

731
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said he wanted to see St. Pauls.</font>

732
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No I didn't.
- Shh! She might hear you.</font>

733
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to see a friend of mine.</font>

734
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everett?</font>

735
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have they said of him?</font>

736
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing, John just said you've
made Everett unhappy.</font>

737
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:04,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just as you've made him unhappy.</font>

738
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is Everett?</font>

739
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:09,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A friend.</font>

740
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But not the friend we're going to see?</font>

741
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sophie, ... please.</font>

742
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:45,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But John must have talked to you, surely?</font>

743
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He must have ...</font>

744
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:55,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me understand, you are telling me that...</font>

745
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:02,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you still, to this day, ... do not ... understand,</font>

746
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the details of the most intimate
relation within marriage?</font>

747
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have not experienced them?</font>

748
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has never so much as touched me.</font>

749
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never made me his wife.</font>

750
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:20,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because he was disgusted with
my body that first evening.</font>

751
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After that he said we should wait,</font>

752
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until I was twenty-five.</font>

753
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:32,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By then he said that I'd professed such a
dislike for him that it would be a sin.</font>

754
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And an even further sin to have children.</font>

755
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:40,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I was wicked, and probably insane.</font>

756
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

757
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he ...</font>

758
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:55,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">had never after that moment, sought relations?</font>

759
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:57,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never.</font>

760
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:05,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never heard of such cruelty,
the man must be ...</font>

761
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he has not made you his wife physically,</font>

762
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:18,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I should think ... that you are not his wife.</font>

763
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I have no knowledge of such matters.</font>

764
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will make enquiries, legal and social,</font>

765
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">discreetly, of course.</font>

766
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:30,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would implore you not to have
a scene with him just yet.</font>

767
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must say I've read all his books,</font>

768
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:38,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I've always thought him quite the eccentric,
but now, ...</font>

769
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's most peculiar.</font>

770
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm perfectly thunder-struck!</font>

771
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may sit up, Mrs. Ruskin.</font>

772
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He must be mad.</font>

773
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:59,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

774
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:01,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's that from?</font>

775
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Effie.</font>

776
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:18,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dear, there's nothing more you can do.</font>

777
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must let events take their course now.</font>

778
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come in ...</font>

779
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please sit down.</font>

780
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive me.</font>

781
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:45,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have Dr. Lee's report ... here.</font>

782
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You say, he told you he thinks your husband's mad.</font>

783
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is interesting, but madness, unfortunately,</font>

784
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is not sufficient grounds for divorce.</font>

785
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:05,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it were, half the marriages in London
would be in jeopardy.</font>

786
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the crux is this.</font>

787
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:19,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We found the usual signs of virginity are perfect.</font>

788
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:25,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that she is naturally and properly formed.</font>

789
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So ... There we have it.</font>

790
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must say, in all my years ...</font>

791
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:40,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is an unprecedented case, Mrs. Ruskin.</font>

792
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:44,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I am certain we can receive
an annulment of your marriage.</font>

793
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:48,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the grounds of non-consummation.</font>

794
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, we must be circumspect,</font>

795
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:56,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">best to keep away from your husband as ...</font>

796
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">much as you can, to prevent...</font>

797
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prevent what?</font>

798
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:06,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let us just say you do not make more than a usual effort,</font>

799
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:11,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to encourage ... relations.</font>

800
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:19,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you spend a great deal of time writing?</font>

801
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:22,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do, my angel, I do.</font>

802
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:30,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have written two books about modern painting.</font>

803
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:33,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One about architecture.</font>

804
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this one ...</font>

805
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about Venice.</font>

806
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a very big book.</font>

807
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:55,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then I shall write a book so big,</font>

808
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:02,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it will be all about your sister's conduct.</font>

809
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About her wickedness.</font>

810
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But don't tell her,</font>

811
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because then she would hate you.</font>

812
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:13,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let it be our little secret.</font>

813
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:41,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not worry now, Lambkin. It doesn't hurt.</font>

814
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, George.</font>

815
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uhm...</font>

816
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:57,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">George.</font>

817
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:16,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What in God's name have you done?</font>

818
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have done nothing.</font>

819
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:24,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tidy yourself up this instance,
before my mother sees you.</font>

820
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will not.</font>

821
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:32,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You disgust me.</font>

822
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have had a letter,</font>

823
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from mother.</font>

824
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:45,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She misses Sophie too much and asks
me to return her to Scotland.</font>

825
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:48,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I suggest you start packing.</font>

826
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:57,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does Mama say?</font>

827
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is not from Mama.</font>

828
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:36,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go have one last look in your room,
make sure nothing is forgotten.</font>

829
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, George.</font>

830
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:55,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish you happiness, ma'am.</font>

831
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:01,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A great collection of bags for a short visit.</font>

832
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">George, you will not tell...</font>

833
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's John, actually ...</font>

834
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:10,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where is Sophie?
- She's upstairs.</font>

835
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we can't have two Johns in the house,</font>

836
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:17,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so the Master chose George for me.</font>

837
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I didn't mind.
- You should have.</font>

838
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He took away your name.</font>

839
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:27,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sophie, you will miss the train.</font>

840
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good blimey with those bags, George.</font>

841
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:51,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no point in you accompanying us.</font>

842
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alfred can find me a porter, and
I know you have work to do.</font>

843
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:14,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you be so kind as to hand me in, John.</font>

844
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:41,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

845
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put it here.</font>

846
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:56,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you going to do with that?</font>

847
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:01,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leaving it there, they'll find it when
Alfred takes the carriage back.</font>

848
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Won't they be cross?</font>

849
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:25,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's quite simply one of the most
remarkable pictures in the world.</font>

850
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should be very proud.</font>

851
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:38,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Ruskin, sir.
There is a gentleman at the door for you.</font>

852
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:00,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are we?</font>

853
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:03,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll have to help me, Lambkin.</font>

854
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. John Ruskin?</font>

855
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:07,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>

856
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:10,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a citation to court.</font>

857
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- To court?
- From whom?</font>

858
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Euphemia Ruskin.</font>

859
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:21,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The defendant must receive
the papers himself, sir.</font>

860
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is a matter of law.</font>

861
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this is concerning?</font>

862
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is a private matter, sir.</font>

863
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may illuminate.</font>

864
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:42,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very well ... it's petitioning for the
annulment of your marriage, sir.</font>

865
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:48,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On what grounds?</font>

866
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:52,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is a very delicate matter, sir.
I don't ...</font>

867
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:56,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My parents are privy to of all my affairs.</font>

868
01:36:56,480 --> 01:37:01,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- None-the-less ...
- I demand to know on what grounds.</font>

869
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:08,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the grounds of impotency, sir.</font>

870
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

871
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:41,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who are you?
- I'm Sophie.</font>

872
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:43,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's happened?</font>

873
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not to go to her.</font>

874
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She says you're forbidden.</font>

875
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said it would ruin her, and you.</font>

876
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:13,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said I was to tell you this.</font>

877
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She says she loves you very much,</font>

878
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but she says she's not fit to marry for a time,</font>

879
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:24,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without much deliberation,</font>

880
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:28,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because, wait, because it would
never do to be raptured twice.</font>

881
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:42,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did he say?</font>

882
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:48,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said, "Tell her that I look forward to her... No,</font>

883
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:52,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to making her very happy. "</font>

884
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:59,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like a game of cards?</font>
