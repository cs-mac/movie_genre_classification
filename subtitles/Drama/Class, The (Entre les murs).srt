00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,430
- Hi! 
 - Ok, Francois?

3
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,430
And you?

4
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,010
Stephane... Francois...

5
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,680
- Still on the team? 
 - As ready as ever.

6
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,230
Hello.

7
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,750
- This one? 
 - At the back, please.

8
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,060
Hi, I'm Herve.

9
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,770
A sports teacher here for 3 years.

10
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,690
Welcome to all our new colleagues.

11
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,480
The students can be tough...

12
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,950
but they're good kids.

13
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,780
Hi, I'm Olivier.

14
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,170
I teach physical science...

15
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,420
and I've been here for 4 years.

16
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,090
I'm Patrick,

17
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,790
and I teach multiplication tables,

18
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,140
and sometimes mathematics!

19
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,310
I've been at this school

20
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,520
for a number of years.

21
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,950
Hello, I'm Anne. 
 I used to work in the Lyon suburbs.

22
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,830
I teach English.

23
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,530
I'm looking for my new colleagues.

24
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,280
Hi, I'm Isabelle

25
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,650
Nice to meet you.

26
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,160
I'm Christiane.

27
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,380
I'm Frederic, 
 I teach history and geography.

28
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,450
and I used to work 
 out in suburbs of Paris.

29
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,840
I'm happy to be in the city now.

30
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,930
I'm Julie, the year supervisor. 
 I'd like to welcome you all

31
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,810
and wish you a good year.

32
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,600
I'm Aline and I'm the cook

33
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,400
I'd like to welcome you all.

34
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,200
Thank you, Aline!

35
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,110
Hello. I'm Gilles, 
 I've been teaching mathematics

36
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,290
for many years

37
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,120
I'm retiring at the end of this year

38
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,710
I'd like to wish the new arrivals 
 plenty of courage.

39
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,180
I'm Francois 
 I teach French.

40
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,770
And I'm starting 
 my fourth year here

41
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,940
Welcome everybody.

42
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,950
We'll meet up at midday...

43
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,010
in the canteen for a drink 
 to mark the new year.

44
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,110
You get Wednesday like you wanted!

45
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,690
We could swap our classes

46
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,110
Nice, nice...

47
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,320
Not nice, not nice at all.

48
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,240
He's nice.

49
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,540
Not nice, watch him. 
 Not nice at all.

50
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,410
Nice, not nice.

51
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,380
She's not nice at all.

52
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,890
Arthur, your cap.

53
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,570
Good morning.

54
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,240
That's my place.

55
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:17,400
Get lost!

56
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,110
Calm down now!

57
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,040
Stop stirring things up

58
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,880
Remove your hood, please

59
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,830
You two back there, 
 there's place here.

60
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,250
- One up front. 
 - There's room here too!

61
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's get one thing clear...

62
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,610
We waste 5 minutes 
 lining outside,

63
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,520
5 coming up, 5 setting down:

64
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,320
15 minutes out of hour

65
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,360
Do you realize 
 what 15 lost minutes means?

66
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,810
With 25 hours a week

67
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,830
and 30 weeks in the year,

68
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,330
we lose thousands of minutes.

69
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,990
In other schools, 
 they do a full work.

70
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,050
Imagine how far ahead they get 
 in a year

71
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,500
Figure it out!

72
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,260
We never do an hour.

73
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,230
Hand up to speak.

74
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,980
We never do an hour 
 You always say that!

75
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,990
Teachers say we do an hours class 
 but we never do.

76
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,740
8.30 to 9.25 doesn't make an hour.

77
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,270
All right it's 55 minutes.

78
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,620
That's an important point

79
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,960
Stop saying other schools do an hour 
 They don't!

80
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,010
All I'm saying is that 
 we waste time. Like now.

81
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,420
To start with,

82
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,060
take out a sheet of paper,

83
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,770
fold it in two so that it can stand

84
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,070
on the edge of your desk clearly

85
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,200
and using block capitals,

86
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,200
write your full name.

87
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,160
Why write our names?

88
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,790
To know who you are

89
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,870
- But you know us! 
 - We had you last year.

90
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,960
Esmeralda, 
 half of the kids here are new.

91
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,510
Be happy. That way 
 people will know your name

92
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,130
I'm not doing it

93
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,150
I won't if you don't

94
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,340
You're right

95
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,470
For those of you who don't know me, 
 I'm Mr. Marin

96
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,990
- A marine? 
 - Very funny

97
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,990
Corny!

98
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,070
He wiped you out, sir

99
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,660
Come on, it shouldn't take so long

100
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,670
Five minutes to write a name

101
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,880
It's ridiculous

102
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,150
A biscuit for the firs day?

103
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,370
I'm OK, thanks

104
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,840
Rachel, a biscuit will buck you up

105
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,470
All right. "Witty"

106
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,850
That's word 
 we'll try to explain later.

107
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,570
Are there any other words

108
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,730
that you don't understand?

109
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,730
The word "condescension"

110
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,500
Yes, that's a complicated word.

111
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,570
Do you have any idea

112
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,000
what that might mean?

113
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,160
A vague idea but I'm not sure

114
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,630
You're not sure?

115
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,720
We'll talk about that later then

116
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,180
- Yes, Damien 
 - "Argentine".

117
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,930
Argentine. What does that mean?

118
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,890
It's people who live in Argentina.

119
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,770
Right, the inhabitants of Argentina

120
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,330
Of course not

121
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,990
Damien, who lives in Argentina?

122
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,820
The Argentines

123
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,670
In a soccer match 
 Argentina's players

124
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,240
are called...

125
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,300
Footballers

126
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,760
Let's move on

127
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,760
Any other difficult words 
 in the text?

128
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,210
Henriette

129
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,630
Is there anything 
 that you didn't understand?

130
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,570
"Henceforth".

131
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:41,900
"Henceforth".

132
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,040
"Henceforth"

133
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,950
Thanks for the prompt, Samantha.

134
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,620
I think that will do, 
 Let's take a look at these words.

135
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,470
All right. Austrian

136
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,300
Wey was the one 
 who picked the word Austrian

137
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,670
Yes, Esmeralda.

138
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,100
We all know what "Austrian" is.

139
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,110
- People from Austria. 
 - Wey doesn't know and...

140
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Maybe, but everyone else knows!

141
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:15,780
We get the message. You didn't 
 know "misleading"

142
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,370
...so you're not really 
 in any position to talk.

143
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,450
But everyone knows 
 what "Austrian" means.

144
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,630
Nobody's perfect.

145
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,880
- "Austrian" is not a very, 
 important word, Wey.

146
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,390
It refers to someone 
 from the land of Austria,

147
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,020
which is pretty tiny country.

148
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,020
We can live without the word.

149
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,310
Can anyone name a famous Austrian?

150
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,410
Mozart.

151
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,030
- Who? 
 - Wol Fang Amadeus Mozart.

152
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,120
- "Wol Fung" maybe if he 
 were English, not Austrian.

153
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,090
Any other famous Austrians?

154
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,090
Austria could vanish 
 no one would notice.

155
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,760
Seriously, it's south of Germany. 
 So check a map, Wey,

156
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,890
You'll see where it is.

157
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:06,810
Souleymane,

158
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,060
...can you note the words too?

159
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,590
I forgot my things.

160
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,610
No one can land you some paper...

161
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,360
I'll do it at home.

162
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,400
You'll do it at home. Sure you will. 
 That's your approach

163
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,170
Only work at home.

164
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,620
I'm serious!

165
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,450
If I could be sure of that...

166
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,120
Don't worry. It'll be ok

167
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,340
Let's move on to "succulent".

168
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,560
"Succulent" is a word that we'll try 
 to guess the meaning of.

169
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,230
What's is "succulent"?

170
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,510
Suck

171
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,900
Suck off.

172
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,480
Very funny, Boubacar.

173
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,110
Very witty indeed,

174
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,450
Here's a sentence...

175
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,450
...with "succulent".

176
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,660
"Bill enjoys a succulent...

177
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,830
...cheeseburger. "

178
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,710
Cheeseburgers stink!

179
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,930
- Who said that? 
 - Me.

180
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,630
Why "cheeseburger"?

181
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:15,010
Well, since you say that, you 
 think cheeseburgers aren't succulent.

182
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,570
Maybe, but they're crap.

183
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,730
OK, but what I just said 
 should have made the penny drop.

184
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,990
- What does that mean? 
 - Mean what?

185
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,780
The penny thing...

186
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,750
To make the penny drop,

187
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,930
No one knows the expression?

188
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,330
If the penny drops, 
 it means you understand.

189
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,290
When I say,

190
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,880
if cheeseburger stink 
 they're not succulent,

191
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,400
that should help you see 
 what "succulent" means.

192
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,720
- What's with the Bills? 
 - What bills?

193
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,180
The name Bill.

194
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,060
You always use weird names.

195
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,490
Weird? A recent US President 
 was called Bill.

196
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:00,160
Why don't you use Aissata 
 or Rachid or Ahmed...

197
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,160
You always use whitey names.

198
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,410
What names?

199
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,580
- Honky names. 
 - What's honky?

200
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,710
Honkies, Frenchies, frogs.

201
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,010
You're not French?

202
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,640
No, I'm not French.

203
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,300
I didn't know.

204
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,890
I am, but not proud of it.

205
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,350
Fine, I'm not either

206
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,350
Why use these names?

207
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,780
Khoumba, if I start choosing names

208
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,740
to suit all your origins, it'll 
 never end.

209
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,700
Just change a little!

210
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,710
What do you suggest?

211
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,210
Aissata! Fatou, no!

212
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,710
- No, Aissata. 
 - Aissata, Aissata!

213
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,760
Excuse me. You have class 4/3 
 in French?

214
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,680
I'm class supervisor too.

215
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,430
Know what book you'll be reading?

216
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,390
No, I haven't decided.

217
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,270
In history I'll start with 
 Ancien Regime

218
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,280
If you want to link into that, 
 what kind of books are there?

219
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,330
The Enlightenment will 
 be tough for them.

220
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,880
How about Voltaire? Is he tough?

221
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,090
He's not easy.

222
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,760
Candide, is simple...

223
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,690
Not in their year

224
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,550
Zadig...

225
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,810
Yes, but it'd be tough

226
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,980
You have 20 seconds.

227
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,780
No, we've not finished yet!

228
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,740
We've not finished yet!

229
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,110
We can't spend 2 hours on the 
 imperfect.

230
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,130
Dalla, I can give you the time.

231
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,550
Sir, my pen keeps leaking!

232
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,260
- It's crap 
 - Who has a handkerchief?

233
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,850
Me!

234
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,310
Rabah!

235
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,100
Ask before you stand.

236
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,850
- May I? 
 - Yes.

237
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,690
- Gently, Ok... 
 - The perv!

238
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,320
He touched her tits!

239
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,710
Just give him the handkerchief.

240
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,820
Spare us your comments.

241
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,990
God dam pedophile!

242
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,840
- Quiet! 
 - Sir?

243
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,300
Why the imperfect indicative?

244
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,970
Cut it out!

245
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,140
- Why not just imperfect? 
 - Quiet, Souleymane.

246
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,310
All right, Esmeralda, 
 why the indicative?

247
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,780
If I knew, I wouldn't ask.

248
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:43,880
I can imagine. Anyone know why we 
 specify the imperfect indicative?

249
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Why not just the imperfect?

250
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,990
Nassim? 
 May I wash my hands?

251
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,800
Go on, wash them and get it over with.

252
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,260
Make it quick.

253
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,140
He'll take a week!

254
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,970
- I'll go with him. 
 - Enough

255
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,800
The imperfect indicative is

256
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,740
different than another imperfect

257
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,480
Which imperfect is that?

258
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,820
Agam? 
 - The imperfect subjunctive.

259
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,110
Exactly.

260
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:17,790
The Imperfect subjunctive. 
 Can anyone give me an example?

261
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,590
I don't believe it, Khoumba, 
 but go on.

262
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,890
I may be wrong...

263
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,510
I think so too.

264
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,520
- I were 
 - I were.

265
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,770
From the verb "to werr"

266
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,890
- I don't know... 
 - I wuz.

267
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,560
I were, we were, you were

268
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,650
All right. Not bad but you use it 
 wrongly.

269
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,780
You vaguely recall 
 the imperfect subjunctive.

270
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,990
Imagine I say:

271
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,870
"He insist...

272
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,290
"that I be... "

273
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,720
Let's say "in shape". 
 "He insists that I be in shape"

274
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,720
What is "be" in that example?

275
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,090
The present subjunctive.

276
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,560
Very good. For the imperfect 
 subjunctive,

277
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,780
we follow the sequence of tenses 
 and use a past:

278
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,150
"He insisted... "

279
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,030
- "He insisted that I... " 
 Khoumba?

280
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,320
- Were. 
 - Were. Yes.

281
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,950
You really think I'll tell my mom:

282
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,620
"He insisted that I were'd been in shape?

283
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,340
Not I were'd been. 
 Learn to use it first

284
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,100
"That I were in shape"

285
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,140
- The sequence of tenses. 
 - No one says that.

286
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,730
I was right!

287
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,270
"I were".

288
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,780
Will you let me answer the question?

289
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,200
If you care. 
 - You may.

290
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:50,870
- Before mastering something, 
 the imperfect subjunctive,

291
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,880
you're telling me it's no use.

292
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,830
Start by mastering it,

293
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,460
then you can call its use into question.

294
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,050
Sir, why are you criticizing us?

295
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,440
They're right, that's the way 
 people talked in the old days.

296
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,300
Even my gran didn't say that.

297
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,400
Or your great granddad 
 It's from the Middle Ages!

298
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,190
No it isn't.

299
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,110
It is!

300
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,560
It's bourgeois...

301
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,450
Tell me, when was the last time

302
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,090
you heard someone talk like that?

303
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,710
Yesterday, with friends, 
 we used the imperfect subjunctive.

304
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,250
No, someone normal!

305
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,470
All right, all right.

306
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,130
The people on the streets...

307
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,550
Can I reply?

308
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,760
Yep.

309
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,770
I'll talk this over, but calmly.

310
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,560
All right, not everyone talks that way.

311
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,660
In fact, people who do are pretty rare.

312
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,480
I'd even say only snobs...

313
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,910
...use the imperfect subjunctive.

314
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,210
What's a snob?

315
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,560
Snobs are slightly affected, 
 slightly precious people

316
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,090
who tend to put on airs.

317
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,460
Homosexuals?

318
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,300
No, not homosexuals...

319
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,800
You can be affected and refined

320
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,270
without being homosexual.

321
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,440
In any case,

322
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,870
this register may seem 
 formal and a bit affected,

323
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,160
and even bourgeois.

324
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,160
But these different registers exist

325
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,420
...as I keep telling you,

326
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,710
...you need to be able to use them

327
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,220
...Familiar, current, formal, 
 oral and written.

328
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,310
Move between them 
 and use them all. Yes, Lucie?

329
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:47,360
How do we know what's written 
 and what's for oral?

330
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,610
Why is a word more one for one register?

331
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,410
Normally, that's something

332
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,830
that you pick up as you go along

333
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,750
You need to use intuition.

334
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,080
What's this?

335
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,840
Intuition is when you can't use thinking

336
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,840
When you can't really...

337
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,550
It's not knowing 
 but more like sensing something.

338
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,690
When you sense things

339
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,400
What if you don't sense?

340
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,180
If you don't sense them, well…

341
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,560
You gain intuition 
 by using the language.

342
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,110
That's when you learn to distinguish...

343
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,120
almost automatically 
 between oral and written styles.

344
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,130
- Souleymane wants to say something. 
 - Shut it.

345
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,000
What does he want to say?

346
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,450
Go on!

347
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,590
Calm down

348
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,930
Cut it out. No fighting

349
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,600
- I'll whop you 
 - Don't act tough!

350
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,390
What's wrong? Boubacar, turn around.

351
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,490
- What is it? 
 - Nothing

352
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,450
- Apparently not. 
 - Don't send him to the principal.

353
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,250
If I tell you, 
 I'm good for Guantanamo.

354
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,000
Guantanamo! Guantanamo!

355
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,410
I'll be tased!

356
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,710
You won't be tased.

357
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:11,920
- You have a question? 
 - Yep

358
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,090
So ask it

359
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,430
- It's too wicked 
 - It's not

360
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,640
It's the pits for you 
 - Just ask it

361
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,730
- I have your word? 
 - Hurry up

362
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,520
This is what I heard, ok? 
 I didn't say it but I heard...

363
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,520
People say you like men.

364
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,400
I didn't say it!

365
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,370
- Who says that? 
 - Just people

366
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,700
They say Mr. Marin likes men"

367
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,710
Others say that, not you?

368
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,510
- You not interested? 
 - No way

369
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,090
- So why do you ask? 
 - For the others.

370
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,720
I'm spokesman

371
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,970
- But you don't care? 
 - If you like men, fine

372
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,390
- So is it true? 
 - You are asking me.

373
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:59,400
Homosexual isn't an insult, sir.

374
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,150
You say it isn't but it seems 
 to be a problem for you.

375
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,820
You find it odd, men liking men.

376
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,030
Maybe it is, I don't know 
 It is true or not?

377
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,410
No, it's not. Feel better now?

378
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,840
Yeah? Sure.

379
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,790
Sorry to disappoint you.

380
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,930
All right, if Souleymane doesn't mind

381
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,480
now he's settle his hang-ups,

382
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,060
let's get back 
 to the imperfect indicative.

383
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,250
Yeah, like that! Not bad

384
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,300
- What are you doing? 
 - Stop.

385
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,920
- What's up? 
 - Get lost

386
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,140
Who asked you? Look at your mug 
 - Get lost

387
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,470
- It's fucking ok! 
 Take these jerks,

388
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,020
then we'll see

389
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,310
Go on, show me your backs

390
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,150
- These guys suck. 
 - Another one.

391
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,320
- Classy display 
 - You bet

392
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,950
- Got one for me? 
 - Can't afford it

393
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,670
- How much? 
 - Too much!

394
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,370
Stop thinking I'm broke like you!

395
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,750
She screwed up there 
 She thinks it's regular verb

396
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,170
No the verb's swim. Swimmed.

397
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,320
Justine! "Swimmed"!

398
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,320
Justine, work it out yourself

399
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,540
Swummed. That's better, 
 it mixes the two.

400
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,580
Swammed!

401
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,290
She put swemmed

402
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,140
- Ok, thank you 
 - Try swommed

403
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,400
You can sit down

404
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,060
Let's see.

405
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,860
Let's see

406
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,780
She can't write

407
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,820
She can't write? Can you, Rabah?

408
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,700
- You bet 
 - Go on then

409
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,630
Conjugate it properly

410
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,380
- Swummed 
 - No

411
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,080
Continue.

412
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,290
Swammed

413
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,470
Wrong again

414
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,100
Just kidding

415
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,400
- It's not like that 
 - So what is it?

416
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,820
Without an I

417
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,990
Right, no I

418
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,450
Why make fun of Justine,

419
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,620
when you can't do better?

420
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,960
Justine wasn't so wrong

421
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,870
That's enough

422
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,880
You cant focus for more 
 than 20 seconds

423
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,480
like 3 year olds

424
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,350
People aged 14 or 15 
 like you're supposed to be

425
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:12,070
If I ask a question 
 they should know

426
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,850
Your kidding around goes too far!

427
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,230
Not at all

428
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,580
- Everyone thinks so 
 - Dead right

429
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,830
Everyone thinks so 
 or only you think so?

430
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,370
No, everyone!

431
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,380
I think you push it.

432
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:32,090
If I cut you some slack, 
 you'll never get anywhere

433
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,260
You go too far!

434
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,720
And you know why

435
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,930
I'm sick of these clowns! 
 Sick of them!

436
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,900
I can't take any more

437
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,660
They're nothing, 
 they know nothing...

438
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,410
they look right through you 
 when you try to teach them

439
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,370
They cat stay in their shit

440
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,210
I'm not going to help them

441
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,590
They're so basic, so insincere

442
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,770
...always looking for trouble

443
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,420
Go ahead, guys

444
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,770
...Stay in your crap neighborhood

445
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:12,980
You'll be here all yours lives 
 and it serves you right

446
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:18,110
Ill see the principal and tell him 
 I'm not working with 3/2 again.

447
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:22,740
No more technology 
 for the rest of the year. Too bad

448
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:26,910
It's been three months now and 
 they haven't done a single thing

449
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,340
Have you seen them in the yard? 
 It's like they're in heat

450
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,260
They're all over each other, 
 like animals

451
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,470
It's crazy. It's the same in class

452
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,050
Kevin spent a whole hour doing

453
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:45,520
I've never seen the like 
 of it in 5 years!

454
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,410
Enough, no more!

455
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,480
We're not animals!

456
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,880
Sorry I'm…

457
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,510
It's dumb.

458
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,600
Come on. Let's get some air

459
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,580
One extract isn't a lot to read

460
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,740
No one did it?

461
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,590
We're wasting time here

462
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,210
Let's read it again then

463
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,000
Who wants to read?

464
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,690
Great! Excellent work 
 atmosphere today.

465
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,740
Khoumba, go on.

466
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,440
No way.

467
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,780
You won't read?

468
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,900
I don't want to

469
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,830
The class revolves 
 around your desires?

470
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,990
- I don't want to read 
 - Don't care

471
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,130
What did Khoumba just do?

472
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,630
- Wey? 
 - Sneer

473
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,630
I meant her attitude, 
 What did she show?

474
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,090
Insolence.

475
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,760
That's right, you're an expert

476
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,700
You're all angrulo with me

477
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,810
What is this? 
 - That's not true

478
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,990
Try saying it in French. What am I?

479
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,780
Angrulo

480
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,740
Say it in everyday French

481
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,110
- You've got it in for me 
 - That's normal French

482
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,340
I just want you to read

483
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,630
I have the right to ask you 
 to read, don't I?

484
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,430
Don't you think so? 
 - No.

485
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,300
No one has read it

486
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,180
and you're picking on me.

487
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,060
I'm not. I want to work

488
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,150
and I've chosen you 
 as I have the rights to.

489
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,480
Drop it.

490
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,910
Shut up and start reading

491
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,570
I won't read

492
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,580
You tell me to shut up, 
 then to read. What is this?

493
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,040
What's what?

494
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,530
Make your mind up,

495
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,080
Think it through

496
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,790
Well talk it over after class

497
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,760
It won't be fun 
 - Sure

498
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,470
You won't say that later

499
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,600
Esmeralda, are you on strike too 
 or can you read for us?

500
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,390
It's her life

501
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,260
In that case, will you read for us?

502
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,690
I'd be delighted to

503
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,610
All right, were listening

504
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,860
"Dear Kitty

505
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,370
I'm known as a bundle 
 of contradictions.

506
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,120
"As I've told you several times...

507
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,780
..."my soul is split in two

508
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,830
"my mocking approach to 
 everything, my joy in life,

509
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,800
..."On one side

510
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,550
my exuberant cheerfulness

511
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,060
..."and my ability 
 to take things lightly

512
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,180
"By that I mean not seeing 
 any wrong in flirting...

513
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,060
..."giving a kiss, embracing someone,

514
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,570
..."or telling a tasteless joke

515
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:05,250
"That side lies in wait 
 pushing back the other side...

516
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:09,740
..." which is more beautiful, 
 purer and deeper.

517
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,960
"The truth is that no one knows,

518
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,790
..."Anne's better side...

519
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,870
..."and that's why most people...

520
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,340
..."can't stand me.

521
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,680
"I can be an amusing clown 
 for an afternoon

522
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,980
..."but then everyone

523
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,310
"has had enough of me,

524
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,070
..."So the nice Anne has never once,

525
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,440
..."been seen in company

526
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,740
"But, in her loneliness, 
 she always triumphs.

527
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,860
"My best to you. Anne Franck. 
 Anne's diary ends here

528
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,620
It ends here. Why?

529
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:45,510
Because the police turned up 
 at the rooms

530
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,290
...where they were hiding 
 and deported them.

531
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,720
She died shortly after

532
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,880
...That's what I asked earlier 
 We talked about it.

533
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,630
I learn about Anne Frank

534
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:00,520
because she talks about herself 
 and so I get to know her.

535
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,320
When I ask you to write 
 your own self-portraits,

536
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,190
...I'll expect the same.

537
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:11,160
...In other words, to learn things 
 through your feelings,

538
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,780
...You can talk about facts...

539
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,620
...that will allow 
 me to know you better.

540
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,540
Yes, Lucie?

541
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,630
What we write

542
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:30,560
won't be as gripping as... 
 as what Anne Franck wrote

543
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,270
Our lives aren't as gripping. 
 - All right

544
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,150
Juliette?

545
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,610
Someone aged 70 
 could talk about their life,

546
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:45,740
...but we have nothing to tell at 13,

547
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,330
At 14, 15 or even 13 
 you've had experiences

548
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,930
- Less then someone aged 70 
 They've live a lot more.

549
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,670
- OK 
 - They've seen life.

550
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,760
It's funny. You don't think 
 your lives are interesting.

551
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:04,150
We just come to school, go home, 
 eat and sleep.

552
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,320
You come to school, eat, sleep, fine

553
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,280
The bare facts of your life are dull

554
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:15,450
But what you feel is interesting 
 - That's my business

555
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,080
Maybe, but I'm interested

556
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,950
That's different

557
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,540
Why is it different?

558
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,880
Because you're a teacher.

559
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,420
It's not the teacher talking.

560
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,520
- It's the human being 
 - It's your job

561
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,720
I think you're only saying that 
 to get us to talk and stuff

562
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,720
...but its not true.

563
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,400
It isn't? What isn't true?

564
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:45,370
The fact that you're interested 
 in knowing all that

565
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,490
So I'm not interested at all

566
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,040
...and I'm pushing at this

567
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,370
...to convince you its interesting?

568
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,170
Not as much as you say

569
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,380
Maybe I am exaggerating a little.

570
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,800
It's only natural since 
 you don't agree with me

571
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,520
But, deep down, I'm totally sincere

572
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,530
Why it is such a problem for you

573
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,230
...to talk about your lives? 
 Boubacar.

574
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,360
Well there stuff...

575
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,370
There's private stuff.

576
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,040
Of course

577
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:24,250
What could be hard to say 
 about your private lives?

578
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,000
Burak.

579
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,290
- We may be ashamed 
 to say certain things

580
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,670
Yes, it has to do with shame.

581
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,350
Things you find it hard to say 
 and even harder to write.

582
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,890
On your life, when were you ashamed?

583
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:44,140
You can be ashamed of pal's mom...

584
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,360
Why? Because you find her ugly?

585
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,490
No. For instance, Rabah's mom,

586
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,910
She offered me lunch but I refused

587
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,580
because I was ashamed

588
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,680
Ashamed to eat with her?

589
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,590
Because it's beneath you? 
 - No.

590
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,760
I don't understand, Tell me why.

591
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:08,930
I'm ashamed to eat with her 
 because I respect her.

592
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,400
You never eat with people who 
 you respect?

593
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,480
I mean, she's not my girlfriend!

594
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,660
You can only eat with 
 a girlfriend...

595
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,150
Tell me why. I'm interested

596
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,080
I can't explain it. 
 In any case, I'm ashamed

597
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,250
I always hang out with Rabah

598
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,840
so I respect his mom

599
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,600
I don't eat in front of her

600
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:39,270
So if Boubacar eats in front of us 
 he doesn't respects us

601
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,150
No, it's not that!

602
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,810
- You can't understand. 
 - I'm not smart enough?

603
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,560
You just can't understand.

604
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,610
Rabah?

605
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,490
I was at a party with Camemberters

606
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,320
Camemberters?

607
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,620
Yeah, like you

608
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,910
What's a Camemberter?

609
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,540
Someone who stinks of cheese

610
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:04,880
So the people at the party 
 stank of cheese?

611
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,420
They were all in suits and ties.

612
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,640
I was in my baggies and 
 got these weird looks

613
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,510
You were ashamed?

614
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,140
Because of the looks

615
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,930
They were embarrassed because of you

616
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,890
...and you felt the same

617
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,530
They weren't embarrassed

618
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:23,940
They looked at me 
 like I was an E.T.

619
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,150
You are an E.T.!

620
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,240
"Why's that Arab here?"

621
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,280
Ok, so it was a race thing

622
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,250
I don't know

623
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,710
But the snacks were bacon-flavored

624
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,260
So I... abstained

625
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:44,100
Right. Bacon, ham... Ok, I get it

626
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:45,930
Wey...

627
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,940
Young people now have no shame.

628
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,200
Young people now? Like you?

629
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:52,570
Yeah

630
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,570
- Drop your briefs! 
 - They have no shame

631
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,650
It's normal. Always normal

632
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,710
Are you like them?

633
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,660
- No. 
 - Are you ashamed?

634
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,910
Yes, ashamed of them.

635
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,760
I'll waste your ugly mug!

636
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:15,460
Anyone can speak, but 
 you stay polite, OK.

637
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,400
So why are you ashamed for them?

638
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,850
They have no shame

639
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,400
They yell, they hit each other. 
 They make jokes,

640
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,620
bother others. No shame

641
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,900
Wey, aren't you confusing

642
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,610
shame and discipline?

643
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,160
You find the others...

644
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,030
rowdy and impolite.

645
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:38,500
It can be shameful too

646
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,380
Louise?

647
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,870
You can be ashamed of your appearance

648
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,430
Absolutely

649
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,460
Tell me Louise

650
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,170
what are you ashamed of?

651
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,740
My ears

652
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,230
Your ears?

653
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,400
Can we see? You're ashamed of your ears?

654
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,040
What's wrong with them?

655
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,280
They stick out

656
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,920
- You think they stick out 
 - Mine too

657
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,000
I think that covers it all.

658
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,620
You have all you need 
 to figure it out

659
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,590
Take out your exercise books.

660
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,600
Note the following exercise 
 for next Thursday

661
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,200
It's very simple: 
 Write your self portrait.

662
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,370
A self-portrait 
 isn't an autobiography.

663
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:41,080
I don't want your life story

664
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,510
Describe yourself and your personality.

665
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,870
We'll read them in class

666
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,670
...and see how we can use them

667
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,650
Khoumba.

668
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,700
You know I want to see you

669
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,290
Give me your report book

670
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,330
Why?

671
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,420
You know why.

672
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,230
No, give it to me. Politely.

673
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,270
That's enough now

674
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,440
Put your photo on it

675
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,320
Is it normal to refuse to read

676
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,660
when teacher asks you to? 
 Is that normal?

677
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,080
There's others in the class.

678
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,620
I can't turn a blind eye to this.

679
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,160
Can I?

680
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,710
OK.

681
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,220
What happened this summer?

682
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,800
What happened during the vacation?

683
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,720
- I didn't see you 
 - I know.

684
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,360
I'm intrigued.

685
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,020
At the end of the year in June

686
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,740
...we'd gotten on pretty well together

687
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,570
You participated in class.

688
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,270
Since September, 
 since the start of this year,

689
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,620
You're not cooperative,

690
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:17,870
...You keep sulking, 
 You refuse to read... What happened?

691
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,250
I don't like reading now. 
 Can you hurry, please?

692
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,430
No, I won't hurry!

693
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,400
Explain.

694
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,850
Why have things changed 
 all of a sudden?

695
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,100
I can't stay a kid forever

696
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,490
So it's a kid thing to cooperate?

697
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,450
That's it 
 - There's others in the class.

698
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,370
Of course, when you work, it's

699
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,510
I haven't finished.

700
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,330
My moms waiting for me

701
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,840
I want an apology first

702
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:56,420
An apology for what you did

703
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,600
"I apologize for 
 being insolent, sir"

704
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,470
Sorry. Ok?

705
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,060
No, not sorry.

706
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,470
"I apologize for being insolent"

707
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,020
Go ahead

708
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,400
"I apologize, sir"

709
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:13,490
- "No, I apologize 
 for being insolent"

710
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,160
Be sincere. I want a real apology

711
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,370
Can you hurry up, please?

712
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,830
- My moms waiting 
 - For your apology

713
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,330
Let's deal with this

714
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,420
I want a sincere apology

715
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,710
...that'll stand for the rest of the year

716
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,770
We won't go on like this

717
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,470
I apologize for being insolent.

718
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:35,970
More conviction!

719
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,520
I'm not saying it 50 times

720
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,940
- You two, 
 What are you up to?

721
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,270
We're waiting

722
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,530
Hurry, I'm listening

723
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,190
I apologize for being insolent.

724
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,650
May I go now, please?

725
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,590
I didn't mean it

726
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:16,360
Two weeks ago, at the last meeting

727
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,370
the teachers suggested

728
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,160
introducing a penalty point system 
 for the students

729
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,670
...based on the driving license system

730
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:29,710
If student broke a rule

731
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,170
...they would lose points

732
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,550
As its teachers idea, 
 I'll let them to speak

733
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,110
Since last September...

734
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,980
...we've noticed an increase 
 in problems within the school.

735
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,450
Punishment has no effect 
 on the students

736
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,030
So we had the idea

737
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,610
...of a penalty system

738
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:54,410
The students would have 
 for example six points each

739
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:58,920
and depending on the misdeed 
 they'd lose one or two points.

740
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,420
And when they run out of points?

741
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,670
They go before the disciplinary committee.

742
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,390
As a parents representative...

743
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,900
...this is typical 
 of the schools bad habits…

744
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,980
You always condemn the students...

745
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,660
...but never praise them

746
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,030
They earn praise on their own

747
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,120
They do it with their grades, 
 by moving up a class

748
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,780
and we do it in staff meetings...

749
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:29,500
...by encouraging them to work.

750
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,840
There's the honor roll, 
 the congratulations.

751
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,550
that all counts.

752
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,430
In your system

753
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,210
...you take away points for misdeeds

754
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:41,940
but why not further

755
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,310
...and give points to those 
 who do good things?

756
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,490
Like gold stars.

757
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,270
I'm all for praising the students.

758
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:54,690
but if student collect points 
 and end up with 34 points, say,

759
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:58,700
...That leaves room 
 for all kinds of trouble,

760
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,170
...we can't control

761
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:02,830
Without going as far...

762
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,370
as these imaginary 34 points

763
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,760
...six points to start with,

764
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,220
means they can cause trouble 
 without punishment.

765
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:15,810
Losing a point or two 
 isn't a real punishment.

766
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:19,310
It can create 
 a dangerous sense of impunity.

767
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:23,020
For me, the ideas 
 totally wrong-headed.

768
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,440
In that case,

769
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,450
...we could find a punishment

770
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,290
...where the students 
 lose all their points in one go...

771
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:35,870
But why bother with the points 
 in that case?

772
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,660
It's tricky

773
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,010
- What you call a sense of impunity 
 gives us a room to maneuver,

774
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,350
...When you're dealing 
 with punishments.

775
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:49,350
that are cut and dried,

776
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,310
you can't adapt them to each case

777
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:54,400
I don't agree

778
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,030
The rules apply in the same way

779
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,400
...to all the students

780
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:00,540
They break them, they're punished

781
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,490
If not, why bother with rules?

782
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,330
Dealing with extremely strict rules

783
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,170
...creates the greatest tension...

784
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:09,800
Take cell phones

785
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,010
We agreed on a rule...

786
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,420
...that cell phones 
 were not allowed in class

787
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:17,920
Sorry, but I break that rule

788
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:20,560
...because it wasn't problem for me

789
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,900
There's room to be tolerant.

790
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,020
The reign of the arbitrary.

791
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:29,150
No, the law 
 and the spirit of the law.

792
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:32,370
We could talk all night 
 but its not possible

793
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,590
We have other topics to tackle.

794
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:40,410
In particular, one vital issue,

795
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:45,290
a very sensitive one, 
 concerning the staff coffee machine.

796
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:48,310
It's a sensitive issue, all right

797
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,940
There's a real problem this year...

798
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:58,780
...The price of a coffee has gone up 
 from 40 centimes

799
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:00,740
to 50 centimes

800
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,990
That may seem petty...

801
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,670
...but with several coffees a day,

802
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:08,170
...at 8, 10 or 4 
 in the afternoon...

803
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:12,370
it works out a lot

804
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,580
...So we've clubbed together 
 to buy a coffee maker.

805
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:21,060
- That way we can drink 
 as much coffee as we want...

806
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:24,720
...without having to count.

807
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:28,770
- Mr. Pierre will be delighted 
 to reply.

808
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:36,030
- First of all, this machine 
 was installed in 2001...

809
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:36,370
to replace a machine

810
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,620
...that needed the intervention of...

811
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:41,500
...an outside company for restocking

812
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:45,250
...repairs etc. 
 It was very expensive

813
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,970
And not at all profitable

814
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:51,470
We switched to the new machine, 
 which isn't profitable yet

815
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,690
I'm sorry to hear that!

816
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:55,680
And so we increased

817
00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:00,110
...the price of coffee by ten centimes.

818
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,360
The thing has to be 
 economically viable

819
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:08,150
- Nobody's shocked? 
 - It's clear and logical for me.

820
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,030
- Good evening. Don't move 
 - We have to go

821
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,700
We haven't finished

822
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,260
" Respect

823
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:01,860
" Adolescents 
 learn to respect their teachers...

824
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,430
..." because of threats...

825
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,730
..." or the fear of having problems

826
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,230
" For starters, I respect you...

827
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,030
..." and respect must be mutual

828
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:15,580
For instance, 
 I didn't say you're hysterical

829
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:18,120
..." so why do you say I am?

830
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,920
" I've always respected you

831
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,380
..." so I don't understand 
 why I have to write this.

832
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:32,220
" I know you have it in for me 
 but don't know why.

833
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,560
" I shall sit at the back...

834
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:38,890
..." to avoid any other conflicts.

835
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,690
" unless you come looking for them.

836
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,490
" I admit I can be insolent...

837
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:47,540
..." but only if provoked.

838
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,080
" I wont look at you again,.

839
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:53,420
" so you cant say 
 my look is insolent.

840
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,800
" In theory, in French class,

841
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:59,170
..." you talk about French, 
 not your grandma or sister

842
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,470
..." or girls periods.

843
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:03,600
" And so, from now on,

844
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:06,060
..." I wont spell to you again.. "

845
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,280
Signed Khoumba.

846
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,480
- What is it? 
 - Secret.

847
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:12,660
- A secret? 
 - A secret.

848
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,230
It won't stay a secret for long.

849
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,170
Esmeralda, 
 Why have you changed places?

850
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,040
No reason.

851
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,590
I felt like it.

852
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,100
- A problem? 
 - No, not at all.

853
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,560
No problem.

854
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:35,050
I wanted a change of scene.

855
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,780
Ok, that's enough. 
 Let's get to work.

856
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:47,120
No, sir, please!

857
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,110
Please, sir!

858
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,620
You're just copying 
 what you did at home

859
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:55,590
You've had plenty of time

860
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,210
Esmeralda.

861
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,440
I have to?

862
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:04,010
Yes, absolutely.

863
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,690
My name is Esmeralda Ouertani.

864
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:10,230
I'm 14...

865
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,020
...I live on Allee du Pere Dhuit...

866
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,190
...Paris 20,

867
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,520
...with my two parents and 
 my three brothers and sisters.

868
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,570
Later,

869
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,530
...I'd like to be a policewoman...

870
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:25,410
...because people say 
 all policeman are bad,

871
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,580
...and so we need good ones.

872
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:30,510
If not, I'd like to be a rapper...

873
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,800
...and I'm fan of Bakar, Medine,

874
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,100
...Younes, Marvin and Mafiak1 Fry.

875
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:38,180
Otherwise,

876
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:42,020
I like eating, sleeping 
 and hanging out in the hood.

877
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:43,850
Or rather?

878
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:45,650
- The neighborhood. 
 - You can say it right.

879
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,110
When you write,

880
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:50,620
you use the standard style...

881
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,910
Don't make me correct you.

882
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:55,860
Wey, go on.

883
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,880
My names Wey, I'm Chinese.

884
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,710
I'm 15, I have two sisters, 
 I'm the youngest.

885
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,640
My hobby is playing video games

886
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,010
at least 4 hours a day.

887
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:12,850
I find it hard 
 using French correctly.

888
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,730
It's so hard expressing myself...

889
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,400
...that others don't understand me.

890
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,480
That's why I don't communicate much.

891
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:27,070
I hardly ever go out. 
 Nothing much interests me outside...

892
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:32,230
The environment doesn't suit me here 
 since I'm allergic

893
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,260
...but i don't know what.

894
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:37,680
Allergic to yourself, that's what.

895
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,180
That's good, Wey.

896
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:42,050
I feel I know you better...

897
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:44,890
...after hearing your self portrait.

898
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,310
That's the goal. To tell us things.

899
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,280
He's just happens to be good, 
 not ours

900
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:54,320
No, not at all.

901
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:56,410
I can congratulate Wey

902
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,040
and I'd gladly congratulate you,

903
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,750
if you manage to do it well.

904
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,330
Rabah, read us...

905
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,830
…your self portrait 
 - No.

906
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,500
How can I congratulate you 
 if you don't?

907
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:08,510
I don't need that.

908
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:11,430
Make your mind up

909
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:13,000
We're listening.

910
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,640
My name's Rabah. I'm 14.

911
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,230
I listen to rap.

912
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:21,520
I love my village in Kabylia 
 and go there every year.

913
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:25,150
I like music, rap and slam.

914
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,170
I have two brothers 
 but I don't like school.

915
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:30,130
I don't like tramps.

916
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:31,870
I like Zidane.

917
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,960
I like to talk and I like 
 Psy 4 de la Rime's videos,

918
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:36,410
...Go Marseille!

919
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,930
We can manage without Marseille.

920
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:40,040
Go Paris!

921
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,930
We don't need it in a self-portrait

922
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:44,720
- That's all. 
 - He skipped two lines.

923
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:45,930
Cut it out.

924
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,600
Go, dude.

925
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,020
Boubacar! 
 - I like to make love

926
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:56,690
I like to look good for the women

927
00:52:58,110 --> 00:52:59,400
and I like summer,

928
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,250
...to see girls cleavage.

929
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,660
Why not, Rabah?

930
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:07,510
I never wrote that.

931
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:09,540
It looks like your writing.

932
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:10,620
No way!

933
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,560
There's no shame in liking cleavage.

934
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:19,300
It's not a sin.

935
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,730
Souleymane stop rocking 
 and read your self-portrait.

936
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,150
- I'm very curious 
 - Huh?

937
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,900
No, not huh.

938
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,650
I wrote nothing.

939
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:32,360
- I saw your writing earlier 
 - No, I wrote nothing

940
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:33,820
You did

941
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,030
- Nothing 
 - We're listening.

942
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:41,000
I'm Souleymane. 
 I have nothing to say about me

943
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,300
because no one knows me but me

944
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,090
- Bravo! 
 - All right

945
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,350
That's good. A bit long maybe

946
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:57,650
You can't make the effort 
 that the others did?

947
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:00,610
I don't talk about myself.

948
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:03,160
How come the others do?

949
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,410
That's their problem 
 I don't talk about my life

950
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:10,750
He just can't write, that's all!

951
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,320
What's up, you cop?

952
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:13,880
You talking to me, cop?

953
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:16,380
I can live with it

954
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,720
- Enough! 
 - Arrest guys...

955
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:21,260
...instead of talking to me. 
 Got your cuffs?

956
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,300
Your breath stinks!

957
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,690
- Chill. 
 - Heard of Aquafresh?

958
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:28,150
Souleymane…

959
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:30,240
there's no need 
 to be offensive.

960
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,200
Need a toothbrush?

961
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,360
Souleymane,

962
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:38,240
...You're a lot better 
 at oral insults than writing

963
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,290
He can't even write his name.

964
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,920
Zip it! What does this say?

965
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,630
Spare us your Koran.

966
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,750
Shut it. What's wrong 
 with the Koran.

967
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,010
I'll spare you when you calm dawn

968
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:51,850
It's the Koran.

969
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:52,890
Bullshit!

970
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:56,640
What's that tattoo, Souleymane?

971
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,270
Why are you showing it?

972
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,720
He claims it's Koran

973
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:04,690
What is it? Why are you showing us?

974
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:08,080
It means shut your mouth.

975
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,950
It doesn't mean that

976
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:13,000
So give us the real translation 
 Go on, tell us

977
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,900
I don't want to

978
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:18,500
You show it in my class so tell us.

979
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,920
It says here, right here:

980
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:27,310
"If your words are less important 
 than silence, keep quiet. "

981
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,760
What I said

982
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,950
It's not what you said.

983
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,950
Why isn't it the same?

984
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:39,270
It's different. 
 I think it sounds better

985
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,660
Yes it's better put.

986
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,460
If only you could write such 
 interesting things on paper,

987
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,080
that would be great

988
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,590
I think so too.

989
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,640
That proves you can do it.

990
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:56,510
After these fires few 
 self-portraits, Id like you,

991
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,340
to rewrite them and polish them...

992
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,560
...making sure you answer 
 the questions that we listed:

993
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:05,860
what I like and don't like...

994
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,950
my qualities and flaws 
 who I'd like to be?

995
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,610
Come in.

996
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:17,120
Stand up please. Good morning.

997
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,670
That goes for those at the back too

998
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,130
Come on, stand up.

999
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,230
Cherif, you heard me? 
 Everyone has to stand.

1000
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:31,100
It's a way of greeting an adult

1001
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:34,020
It doesn't mean 
 submission or humiliation.

1002
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:35,820
Good. Sit back down

1003
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:41,280
I've come to introduce 
 a new student.

1004
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:42,490
Carl.

1005
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:45,750
Try to make him welcome...

1006
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:48,540
...until the end of the year.

1007
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:51,790
Thank you

1008
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,880
Carl, go sit in the third row, 
 in that free place

1009
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:59,430
Khoumba, move your things

1010
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,640
Take a sheet of paper and a pen

1011
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:08,520
and try to catch up with the others

1012
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:09,980
...We'll talk after

1013
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:17,150
Don't forget the homework 
 for Monday without fail.

1014
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:20,030
Let's finish with this

1015
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:24,590
Carl, stay here a minute or two

1016
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:34,970
Welcome

1017
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:37,720
I don't know if you know

1018
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:41,360
but I'm Mr. Marin, 
 your class supervisor.

1019
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:44,650
If there's a problem, tell me.

1020
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,450
I know who you are... 
 why you're here

1021
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:50,910
The principal told me

1022
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,490
but that doesn't matter for me

1023
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:56,460
We'll start from scratch here

1024
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,120
It will all go well.

1025
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:02,630
You've seen that we...

1026
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,350
Were on self-portraits to be 
 handed in next Monday.

1027
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,640
- Maybe you could do one too 
 - OK.

1028
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,520
Know when the next class is?

1029
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,910
Monday, 9.30

1030
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,660
Good.

1031
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:20,650
You like French?

1032
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,820
Like everyone, I guess.

1033
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,630
That doesn't mean much.

1034
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:31,510
Ok, off you go.

1035
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,510
Good bye

1036
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,350
You know what a self-portrait is?

1037
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,020
- Yes. 
 - You're sure?

1038
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:40,600
Yes.

1039
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,730
Have a good day.

1040
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:57,830
Pleased to meet you

1041
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,620
Sit down, please.

1042
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,580
Thank you for coming

1043
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:05,390
I know it isn't easy

1044
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,340
We're very pleased with Wey

1045
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:13,980
Very pleased. All the teachers 
 at the staff meeting said so.

1046
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:16,650
He's kind, he's pleasant...

1047
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:19,230
It's good to have him in class.

1048
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,450
And it's showing in his grades.

1049
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,150
we have...

1050
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:27,790
the usual good grades in mathematics. 
 He's doing well there

1051
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,800
13/20.

1052
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:32,410
In French, 
 we have a 9 here

1053
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,720
Not a lot

1054
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:40,140
He doesn't speak French very well 
 yet but that's only normal

1055
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,890
He speaks a lot. 
 He tells me about a lot of things.

1056
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,480
He talks about his computer

1057
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,520
He's into that

1058
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:49,400
Always too late

1059
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:51,150
He works too late?

1060
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,150
Yes, too late, not sleep good.

1061
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,490
After, school not good.

1062
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:59,200
...Eyes get sick after

1063
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:04,130
He may spend a lot of time 
 on the computer

1064
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:06,170
but things are fine at school 
 for now

1065
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:10,350
He works well 
 and he doesn't seem tired

1066
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:16,930
Nassim... I'd like him to do...

1067
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,730
He can go far. He has all he needs

1068
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,860
At his age, I wasn't that lucky

1069
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:26,900
I'm behind him

1070
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:30,030
Anything he needs, I get him

1071
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:32,250
But he has to do right

1072
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,660
Things are good at home with him

1073
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,640
but I'd like him 
 to keep on studying

1074
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,080
Me and his mother,

1075
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,960
we'd like to be proud of him

1076
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:44,710
That's what we ask of him

1077
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:48,630
I think we all agree 
 on what we need to do.

1078
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,980
It's crazy how alike you are

1079
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,110
We're lookers in family

1080
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:57,070
You're right.

1081
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:01,780
An adolescent who talks 
 with his family,

1082
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:05,160
...who has good grades,

1083
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:07,160
...who has friends,

1084
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:10,290
even if he's a bit of a loner,

1085
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:12,800
...he's an outcast?

1086
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:16,680
He's a boy who talks with adults, 
 who exchanges with them

1087
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,180
Maybe he doesn't with you

1088
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:21,050
but that means

1089
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:25,600
...he's just a teenager 
 trying to define himself.

1090
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:29,530
I was useless at school for years,

1091
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:33,660
...I rejected the idea 
 of marking us fit in with the system.

1092
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:35,660
Do his black clothes bother you?

1093
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,330
The way he looks?

1094
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,870
I don't get it.

1095
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,630
I'd like him to go to the best,

1096
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:48,670
to Henri IV.

1097
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,760
Why?

1098
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:53,430
Standards again...

1099
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,320
Because they have 
 very high standards.

1100
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:00,200
A mother wants the best for her son

1101
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,490
She's scared I'll feel lost 
 in high school because of others

1102
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:07,690
...went to fancy private schools.

1103
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:10,330
and Dolto Hogh isn't like that

1104
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:15,000
It's a pity that the teachers...

1105
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,710
I don't want to accuse anyone

1106
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:20,840
Go on, accuse us. It's a pleasure

1107
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,550
Why don't you try

1108
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,900
...to push the better students

1109
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,640
...a little harder, say?

1110
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:34,440
They get bogged down 
 by other students...

1111
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:36,940
...who aren't as good

1112
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:40,000
My mom makes stuff up. 
 Dolto High isn't useless.

1113
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,330
- I didn't say useless, 
 I said average

1114
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:47,130
I didn't call it useless

1115
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,590
- We talked about Souleymane 
 a great deal...

1116
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,860
...at the staff meeting

1117
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,980
Many teachers have complained 
 about his attitude

1118
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:02,900
...that is very negative.

1119
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:04,520
What?

1120
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:06,610
Many complain...

1121
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:10,610
...that he comes without his things,

1122
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:13,040
...When he comes, as he's often absent

1123
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,500
- I think you know that 
 - No we didn't know

1124
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:19,750
Souleymane tells us he works hard

1125
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,660
She doesn't think so.

1126
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,990
- There have been notes 
 in his report book...

1127
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,710
...since September, 3 month now

1128
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:50,710
Notes about the problems 
 he was having.

1129
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:54,300
- She signs them without knowing 
 because she cant read.

1130
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:58,020
You read the notes too?

1131
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:01,230
Yes, but I'm just his brother. You see?

1132
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:04,780
But you knew there was a problem?

1133
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:08,270
- No, I didn't know. 
 He says things are fine when I ask

1134
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,620
Does he work at home?

1135
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:12,530
He stays in his room

1136
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:29,340
She doesn't understand the notes

1137
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,760
I realize that

1138
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:33,390
You know the situation now

1139
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,770
I'm telling you officially: 
 there's a problem

1140
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:40,360
- Talk to him. 
 - I'll talk to him about it

1141
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:47,240
Just having an idea.

1142
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:49,670
Maybe conversation with his father

1143
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:52,280
could help.

1144
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:56,720
I'll talk to my father 
 and see what we can do

1145
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:59,550
We're not settling scores.

1146
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,650
We want to improve things

1147
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,410
- Your mom? 
 - You bet.

1148
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:26,760
- Ugly old crow! 
 - She hates photos

1149
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:31,680
Me and my bro pissed her off

1150
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,510
Sir! Souleymane has a photos

1151
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:35,890
...for his self-portrait

1152
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:37,980
Cut it out, my photos are crap.

1153
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:39,990
- That's a good idea. 
 - Get your down

1154
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,650
Painters do self-portraits

1155
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,480
- I'm no painter 
 - Yes, I know that.

1156
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,070
Let's go

1157
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,490
Caps, please

1158
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:03,110
I spend all my free time 
 playing the guitar.

1159
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,610
If you're typing, hurry and finish 
 to let the others...

1160
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:10,610
...type up their self-portraits

1161
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:14,740
Souleymane, 
 Dont blow the place up!

1162
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:19,080
- You know what you're doing? 
 - Yeah

1163
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:22,430
As a computer genius 
 you'll put it all back after.

1164
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:24,330
Don't worry.

1165
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:26,340
I'm counting on you.

1166
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:34,440
- Ok, Carl? 
 - Yes, sir

1167
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:37,180
- I can't see it? 
 - No, not yet.

1168
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:38,770
Sir?

1169
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:42,390
How do you spell Lafayette?

1170
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:45,820
- How do you mean? 
 - Like Galeries Lafayette.

1171
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:47,660
Why mention that?

1172
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,500
I go there often 
 so I want to add it

1173
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:55,630
Wow! That's four metro stops 
 A huge leap from your neighborhood

1174
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,490
We're not Hicks

1175
01:06:58,750 --> 01:06:59,670
We're city kids

1176
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:03,590
Really? You go into 
 the center of Paris?

1177
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,550
I go everywhere. The 1st, the 5th,

1178
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:08,460
the 20th, the 12th, the 19th

1179
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:10,560
Why do you go to the 5th?

1180
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,270
In the 5th, I go to see pals

1181
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:15,100
...in high school

1182
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:16,610
Near Luxembourg.

1183
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:18,610
The Luxembourg gardens?

1184
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:20,970
Not the gardens, Luxembourg.

1185
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,940
The country?

1186
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:27,530
No, the Luxembourg metro station!

1187
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:29,940
So you do get out and about

1188
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:34,210
I see you two have made up

1189
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:37,630
- It's our business 
 - And not yours

1190
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,630
So, how do you spell Lafayette?

1191
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:44,760
Lafayette is L-A-F-A-Y-E-T-T-E.

1192
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,260
With a capital

1193
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:51,100
Much better now!

1194
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:53,520
Much better

1195
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:56,100
Yes, that is a good photo

1196
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,610
- You could add a legend. 
 - A legend?

1197
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:00,740
Like a story or tale.

1198
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:04,910
A caption under the photo 
 like in papers.

1199
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,570
You mean, like in Le Parisien?

1200
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,710
Yes, like in Le Parisien

1201
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:12,160
What could you put? Who is she?

1202
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:14,160
- My old woman. 
 - Meaning?

1203
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:17,430
- My mother 
 - You could say she's your mother.

1204
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:20,350
Then you could explain

1205
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:23,050
...why she's making this gesture 
 to the photographer

1206
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,840
They'd pissed her off

1207
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:27,220
I'm not gonna write that!

1208
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,600
- So why is she doing that? 
 - She hates photos

1209
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:33,470
So write that 
 "My mother hate having

1210
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:34,850
..."her photo taken".

1211
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,190
That's a legend.

1212
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,110
- Understand? 
 - Yeah

1213
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:45,290
Do that with all the photos 
 and you're set

1214
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,350
- Printed everything? 
 - Yeah, I'm good

1215
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:16,610
Excellent

1216
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:20,820
What are you doing now, sir?

1217
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:25,080
As you can see, 
 I'm putting the photos up

1218
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,660
...to get a global view

1219
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:32,210
The others read out, 
 their self-portraits

1220
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:35,300
...so you're going to put yours...

1221
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,010
...on show.

1222
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:39,010
You know my photos suck

1223
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,830
Not at all, they're very good

1224
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:43,140
Sure

1225
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:45,810
When a student does good work,

1226
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,230
...I let the whole class see it

1227
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,350
You're just winding me up

1228
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,940
No, I wind you up if I feel

1229
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:55,190
...you can do better. This is good.

1230
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:58,710
That's bullshit

1231
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:02,620
If you've finished, 
 come and take a look

1232
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:05,160
...at Souleymane's masterpiece

1233
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:06,910
Slowly

1234
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,290
I'll straighten them

1235
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:15,880
Look at the tattoo! 
 You're hideous!

1236
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:51,930
I like playing soccer

1237
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:54,390
I like playing computer games

1238
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:56,930
I like playing with pretty girls

1239
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,670
I like vacations in the Carribean

1240
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,270
I like fries, zouk and dancehall music

1241
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,980
I like watching MTV Base

1242
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:09,530
and I like my parents and my brother.

1243
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:12,990
I like my pals and staying up all night

1244
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:16,030
I like the series on the slave trade

1245
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:20,950
I like my hood 
 I like the series Homeland Security

1246
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:25,420
I like eating in restaurants 
 and going wild.

1247
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:29,000
I hate people crying for no reason

1248
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:31,710
I hate techno and tectonic

1249
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:34,680
I hate guys and girls who show off

1250
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:37,770
I hate visiting my brother in jail

1251
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:41,030
I hate talent contest shows on TV

1252
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:45,740
I hate politicians, 
 the war in Iraq,

1253
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:48,110
Goths and skaters

1254
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,230
I hate teachers who are too strict

1255
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:54,070
I hate mathematics, racists

1256
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,160
and I hate Materazzi

1257
01:11:56,410 --> 01:12:00,910
I hates the Paul Eluard school 
 and I like being here

1258
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:09,600
I have something to say

1259
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:12,800
Could you listen to me, please?

1260
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:16,810
I have something to say 
 The mother of Wey

1261
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:19,820
...a student in 4/3 
 has been arrested

1262
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,280
She was in France illegally.

1263
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,150
She has been picked up

1264
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,160
and may be tried next week

1265
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:30,530
She may be deported to China. 
 I thought you should know

1266
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:31,910
as its important

1267
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:34,650
She's been here 3 years now!

1268
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:40,380
I know but that's how it goes,

1269
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,130
wrong place, wrong time

1270
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:43,960
Not the father?

1271
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:45,410
He doesn't have papers either

1272
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:48,180
but they don't bother him

1273
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:52,060
To start with

1274
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,880
as lawyers cost a lot

1275
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:58,060
we could do a collection

1276
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:01,150
and maybe even go to court

1277
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:04,890
to try have some influence 
 on the verdict

1278
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,860
Will Wey have to leave?

1279
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:11,030
Not for now but you never know.

1280
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:16,870
Well,

1281
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:19,250
I feel kind of pathetic after that

1282
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:23,210
I had something to tell you,

1283
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:25,340
...but this isn't a good time

1284
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:27,760
You've said too much now

1285
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,220
I'm pregnant

1286
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,730
That calls for a celebration!

1287
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:44,410
How far gone?

1288
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:48,570
Two months. I'll only have a drop

1289
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:55,080
Just a drop

1290
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:57,500
Bravo, Vincent! 
 I didn't do it on purpose!

1291
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:01,010
Who shook it?

1292
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:02,670
Any names yet? If it's a boy, say?

1293
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:05,060
...You already know?

1294
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,800
If it's a boy, I like Enguerran.

1295
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:10,470
Seriously?

1296
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,940
What a handicap! 
 That won't be easy

1297
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:17,390
I hope not. Thanks a lot!

1298
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:22,490
You all have a glass?

1299
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:25,030
Hold on a second

1300
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,700
I have two wishes

1301
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:32,610
I have two wishes

1302
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:35,170
My first wish

1303
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:38,790
is that Wey's mom stays in France

1304
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:43,510
And my second wish

1305
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:46,560
...is that my child will be 
 as intelligent as Wey

1306
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:01,570
"Jackie Chan"!

1307
01:15:02,850 --> 01:15:03,950
C'mon, play

1308
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,330
I didn't do nothing

1309
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:17,590
He just fell!

1310
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:37,770
Play, Souleymane

1311
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:45,530
- What do you say, Mali man? 
 - What's up, you Caribbean shit?

1312
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:48,830
Malian bastard!

1313
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,040
Motherfucker

1314
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:51,910
C'mon lets play!

1315
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:54,880
- Caribbean fag! 
 - I'll waste the fucker

1316
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:55,800
Shut up

1317
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,050
Blow Thierry Henri, faggot

1318
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:07,390
Stand there. Talk loud enough

1319
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:10,440
for them to hear 
 and try to convince them.

1320
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,100
Go ahead

1321
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:16,060
The African Cup of Nations 
 will be starting soon

1322
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,730
I'm glad Morocco's playing

1323
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:22,290
It's the best team in the world 
 in my opinion.

1324
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:23,490
The sick thing is

1325
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:26,580
that my pals, 
 the Malians aren't playing.

1326
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:28,250
It's tough for them.

1327
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:32,050
They weren't good enough to qualify.

1328
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:37,010
Morocco would have let them play 
 on a friendly basis...

1329
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:40,350
but 4-0 is really hurts

1330
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:44,430
- 4-0 how? 
 - Last time

1331
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,980
...Mali played Morocco, 
 they wasted 4-0

1332
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:51,020
But the weird thing is

1333
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:54,940
...when Mali doesn't play

1334
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:57,950
...it's like all the Africans here,

1335
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,820
...aren't African

1336
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,480
With each cup, they all go crazy

1337
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,250
but when Mali doesn't play, 
 they keep a low profile.

1338
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,050
Weird.

1339
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:12,390
So, whether Mali plays in the 
 African Cup of Nations or not,

1340
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:15,670
...the Africans in this class 
 feel more or less African. Ok.

1341
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:20,730
Thank you, Nassim.

1342
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:24,720
I get the feeling 
 your words are directed

1343
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,570
...at your neighbor, Souleymane

1344
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:28,020
Morocco jerk's

1345
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:29,520
...not even on my radar,

1346
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,410
Arthur is next

1347
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,450
I see you have your notes 
 just like a politician

1348
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,370
- Exactly 
 - That's good

1349
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:45,760
Speak up Arthur. 
 Esmeralda, let him speak first

1350
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,500
I want to defend my look

1351
01:17:47,790 --> 01:17:51,790
...A lot of people say it sucks

1352
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:57,520
I don't dish your clothes, 
 so you don't dish mine.

1353
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:01,400
Clothes are freedom of speech

1354
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:06,110
I dress how I want 
 you dress how you want, ok

1355
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,850
I dress like this to be different

1356
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,990
...and not follow the others 
 like sheep.

1357
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:14,770
You're the sheep here!

1358
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:18,700
I feel better being myself

1359
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:20,460
and not being like others

1360
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,550
I also think 
 if there were 22 goths here,

1361
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:29,300
...and one guy like you 
 you'd keep quiet then

1362
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:34,260
There's a contradiction 
 in what you say

1363
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:37,130
You want to be you. 
 Are those clothes you?

1364
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:41,340
Those clothes are worn 
 by a huge number of people

1365
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:44,730
Most people who wear them 
 are gloomy inside

1366
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:47,440
...so we're all kind of alike

1367
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:52,030
- You're all alike, you're all gloomy, 
 so that's not you.

1368
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,450
By being different

1369
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:56,870
You're different and the same.

1370
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:59,620
Thank you for taking a stand

1371
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:02,590
...and being brave enough to do so

1372
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:04,750
Boubacar, go on

1373
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,170
Boubacar, my pal

1374
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,470
Listen to him

1375
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:13,720
I've come up to reply to Nassim

1376
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:17,430
He says that since Mali

1377
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:22,390
isn't in the Africa Cup of Nations 
 black Africans have no team to support

1378
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:25,100
But he's forgetting Ivory Coast!

1379
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,730
With an ace player Didier Drogba

1380
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:32,150
He beats any Moroccan

1381
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:35,820
He plays for Chelsea 
 What Moroccan plays in England?

1382
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,120
They're not up to it

1383
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:40,290
I'm through.

1384
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:41,380
Thanks, Boubacar

1385
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:44,670
I think that rectification 
 was indeed...

1386
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:47,430
...indispensable

1387
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:51,390
Who wants to speak now?

1388
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:53,340
Carl, go on

1389
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:01,980
Actually, I'd like to say

1390
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:04,320
they're starting to piss us off...

1391
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,900
...with the Africa Cup

1392
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:10,280
At recess you're there 
 pissing us off with your cup

1393
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:12,690
It hasn't even started yet...

1394
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:15,450
Carl, I'll be polite with you

1395
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:19,500
Sorry to interrupt, but tell me, 
 what's your national team?

1396
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:20,630
France

1397
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:24,680
Why do you say you're Caribbean...

1398
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,340
...rather than French?

1399
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:29,470
We're French. It's a French region

1400
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,930
Why don't you ever say 
 you're French?

1401
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:35,100
- It's the same 
 - I don't think so

1402
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:38,230
Look at the players. 
 Thierry Henri, Wiltord…

1403
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,230
...Abidal, Thuram...

1404
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:42,570
Where does Diarra play?

1405
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:46,030
He won't play in Mali, bro, 
 he's not crazy enough.

1406
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,620
Shut your mouth, pal, 
 I'm not your bro!

1407
01:20:49,910 --> 01:20:51,910
An ape like this jerk

1408
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:55,580
No need to loose your cool.

1409
01:20:58,290 --> 01:21:00,290
We can talk calmly!

1410
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:05,550
That isn't a slanging match. 
 It's a debate.

1411
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,480
Souleymane, 
 watch your language

1412
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:09,800
He's fuming!

1413
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,430
Clam up. Go get fucked!

1414
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,560
No vulgarity

1415
01:21:14,930 --> 01:21:17,270
- I ain't talking to you, man 
 - I'm talking to you

1416
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:19,900
Is that any way 
 to talk to a teacher?

1417
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:26,620
That's enough now 
 You're coming with me

1418
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:29,960
- I'm talking to you 
 - Don't start yelling at me, ok

1419
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,420
I'll get you, faggot

1420
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,580
You just can't talk normally?

1421
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,710
Shut up, ape

1422
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,250
Nobody else moves

1423
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,030
Hurry it up

1424
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:04,780
- Move it 
 - Hands off!

1425
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:21,880
Aren't you sick 
 of assing around?

1426
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:33,230
Sorry to bother you

1427
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:37,900
I have a troublemaker who's 
 been disrespectful in class.

1428
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:44,870
I didn't ask you to sit down, 
 Souleymane.

1429
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:52,830
My class is waiting

1430
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,270
Sit down now.

1431
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:12,660
I'm listening

1432
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:19,530
Will you tell me what happened?

1433
01:23:20,490 --> 01:23:24,740
A teacher should have to leave 
 his class to bring you here?

1434
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,840
"Results

1435
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:37,140
..."too uneven

1436
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:39,970
"Too much talking in class

1437
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,980
Now let's move on to Louise,

1438
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:49,860
present here today

1439
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,400
A total disaster. 
 What can we do with you?

1440
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:55,190
No, good work

1441
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,110
Always good, I'd say

1442
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:01,530
It's a joy having a student 
 like her. We need to say it.

1443
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:06,540
Shall we offer this young lady 
 a commendation?

1444
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,130
I'm sorry, but I don't

1445
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:10,300
...totally agree with you.

1446
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:13,680
She's relatively well-placed 
 in the class

1447
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,920
from a numerical angle

1448
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,260
But a commendation? 
 There's room for progress,

1449
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:22,240
huge room for progress

1450
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:25,190
and I don't think 
 her general attitude

1451
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,690
...really merits a commendation

1452
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:28,860
That's the problem

1453
01:24:29,150 --> 01:24:30,980
with commendations

1454
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:34,900
...Are they purely numerical 
 and mathematical

1455
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,450
or are they also to do

1456
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:39,950
...with her attitude and behavior 
 as top of the class?

1457
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:43,420
That means, to get commendation,

1458
01:24:43,710 --> 01:24:46,620
...you have to be an excellent student

1459
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,760
...and, at the same time, 
 be a class leader?

1460
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:56,760
So a commendation this term

1461
01:24:57,050 --> 01:25:00,560
Louise is intelligent

1462
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:02,570
...and will realize she can do better 
 to satisfy you

1463
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:11,320
Now, Cherif

1464
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:13,400
...Our friend Cherif

1465
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:16,330
I have a problem with Cherif

1466
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:18,580
...He's a kid with abilities 
 he could do well

1467
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:21,290
could easily give him 17/20

1468
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:23,700
...but he spends so much time talking

1469
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:26,970
...and disturbing the class,

1470
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:29,470
...his average grade is poor 
 And that's a pity

1471
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:31,960
His behavior's irregular. 
 He can be a disaster

1472
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:36,130
and you cant do a thing with him

1473
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:38,650
or he can be really good

1474
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:42,430
- What does Cherif get? 
 A warning about his work

1475
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:43,980
or his behavior?

1476
01:25:44,270 --> 01:25:45,440
For me, behavior,

1477
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:46,350
...not work

1478
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,240
- In my class, it's more his work 
 - That's a problem.

1479
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:52,780
It's more like a work problem 
 looking at his grades.

1480
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:54,790
Mathematics: 6

1481
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:57,490
French: 8

1482
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:02,040
History and geography: 9

1483
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:05,190
English: 9,5

1484
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:06,920
Excuse me!

1485
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:13,010
Science 12. Music 11

1486
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,940
His grades are pretty low but…

1487
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:19,440
...it seems to be a behavior problem

1488
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:22,610
Why don't we put that for now 
 and say he can work harder?

1489
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:24,690
So I'll put Cherif

1490
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:28,530
..." can succeed as long as

1491
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:31,450
..." his attitude changes

1492
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:33,210
..." in relation to his work. "

1493
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:39,870
Let's move on to Souleymane

1494
01:26:40,290 --> 01:26:43,550
Someone else can start.

1495
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:45,840
What do we say?

1496
01:26:46,090 --> 01:26:47,420
Nothing good.

1497
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:51,430
- What else? 
 - We already discussed him

1498
01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:55,850
in the first term. We said it all 
 He has huge weakness,

1499
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:57,860
notably in written French

1500
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:02,600
I don't think there's anything 
 particularly new

1501
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:04,860
this term

1502
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:05,870
Feeling better, Esmeralda?

1503
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:10,660
I didn't know being class rep 
 was such fun

1504
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:13,670
We were talking about Souleymane

1505
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:14,750
In relation

1506
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:17,340
to what Francois just said,

1507
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:21,880
he forgot his things 
 most of the time this term

1508
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:24,250
...and didn't do much

1509
01:27:25,090 --> 01:27:26,750
It's not just that, 
 It's way beyond that

1510
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:28,710
Sir!

1511
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:33,900
He's more and more unruly 
 He prevents the others from working.

1512
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:35,470
Can I say something?

1513
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,270
If you put the biscuit away.

1514
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:41,890
Remember, you aren't allowed 
 to eat in classroom

1515
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:47,580
Well, his overall grade 
 has gone from 6,75 to 7,25.

1516
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:53,870
We're not discussing his grades

1517
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:55,960
...but his behavior for now

1518
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,380
I have the impression

1519
01:27:58,330 --> 01:28:01,010
...we need to consider 
 disciplinary action

1520
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:03,220
His attitude's wrong

1521
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:06,800
It's simple. Every other class 
 I throw him out

1522
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:10,600
I don't even throw 
 him out anymore,

1523
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:14,020
...He's only too happy when I do.

1524
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:17,520
I don't think disciplinary action 
 will help...

1525
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:18,940
...because things will get

1526
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:20,820
...really bad then

1527
01:28:21,070 --> 01:28:24,780
They're already really bad 
 It's gone too far.

1528
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:28,700
It's like he's mad at the others 
 for being normal

1529
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:30,960
I'll remind you Mr. Marin

1530
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:34,410
...you brought him to me yesterday.

1531
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:38,090
Yes, but it was this year's 
 first incident.

1532
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:41,760
He was disrespectful, I set a limit

1533
01:28:42,010 --> 01:28:44,130
I did what I did but I don't think

1534
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:47,310
it will go any further than that

1535
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:51,140
I don't have any real complaints,

1536
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:52,980
...apart from yesterday

1537
01:28:53,230 --> 01:28:55,060
Our job isn't to make sure

1538
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:59,230
students sit quietly at the back 
 and don't cause any trouble.

1539
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:01,320
We have to bring them out!

1540
01:29:02,110 --> 01:29:05,320
I won't do that 
 with threats or punishment,

1541
01:29:05,570 --> 01:29:09,450
...I'd rather stress his good work. 
 Some things interest him.

1542
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:12,420
He can come out 
 with some pretty good stuff

1543
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:13,670
Simply because he does

1544
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:16,210
...something positive now and then,

1545
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:20,550
...we let him sink 
 and wallow in his hole...

1546
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,970
...and we do nothing. You 
 just want to buy social harmony.

1547
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:29,550
That said,

1548
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:33,220
what do we say? What do we do? 
 A warning?

1549
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:37,280
I don't think a warnings 
 what he needs.

1550
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:41,620
Maybe we should say 
 he has reached his limit,

1551
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:44,580
...because he's 
 limited scholastically.

1552
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:54,760
That's all well and good 
 but I'm dim and have a line to fill.

1553
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,550
What do we put?

1554
01:29:57,970 --> 01:29:59,080
It's not right

1555
01:29:59,390 --> 01:30:00,720
...saying that

1556
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:12,980
Three rhymes per verse. 
 What do you call that?

1557
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:14,730
- Verses of three lines... Wey? 
 - A tercet

1558
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:16,690
Very good

1559
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,490
And four rhymes would be?

1560
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:21,660
A quatrain

1561
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:24,030
From quatre, four

1562
01:30:24,290 --> 01:30:26,540
Tercet, three rhymes. 
 Quatrain, four

1563
01:30:26,870 --> 01:30:29,460
How many syllabes per line?

1564
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:31,040
Can you tell me that? 
 Khoumba.

1565
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:32,420
I know here are 10

1566
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,000
You know that?

1567
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:35,770
- Want me to show you? 
 - Yes.

1568
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:37,810
"Noir-dans-la-nei-ge...

1569
01:30:38,050 --> 01:30:39,970
..."et-dans-la-bru-me. "

1570
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:41,690
Thats 10

1571
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:44,220
You say that and...

1572
01:30:44,470 --> 01:30:46,470
...You have two

1573
01:30:46,770 --> 01:30:50,110
...extra syllables 
 by counting the mute Es.

1574
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:53,610
Don't count them, they're mute

1575
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,660
That makes 8

1576
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:00,280
...We can underline each syllable

1577
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,070
I'll come back to that one

1578
01:31:03,330 --> 01:31:04,960
Two octosyllables 
 and one four-syllable line

1579
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,130
- What is it? 
 - A problem,

1580
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:09,580
11.47 that makes

1581
01:31:09,830 --> 01:31:11,040
11,5.

1582
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:12,960
Is 11.47 the number of syllables here?

1583
01:31:13,290 --> 01:31:16,060
No, my grade. It's down! 
 They lowered my grade!

1584
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:18,380
What's that to do with poetry?

1585
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:20,980
11.47 is 11.5

1586
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:23,090
Who gave you your grade?

1587
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:25,270
You shouldn't have it yet

1588
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,860
Esmeralda told me

1589
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:29,990
So the class reps

1590
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:31,700
...did do something after all

1591
01:31:32,150 --> 01:31:34,150
I took a load of notes!

1592
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:36,870
I got the impression you weren't

1593
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:39,450
...really following the meeting 
 - I noted all!

1594
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:41,410
Louise, I'm delighted 
 you've done

1595
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:43,330
a good job passing on information...

1596
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:46,090
Let's get back to this poem

1597
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:50,630
The rule is to count 
 in front of a consonant...

1598
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:51,710
A question

1599
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:53,640
What?

1600
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:56,340
I heard you really wiped me out

1601
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,430
...at the meeting yesterday

1602
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:00,600
Another remark about poetry, I see.

1603
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:03,060
No, it isn't

1604
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:06,520
Yes, I know it isn't about poetry

1605
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:08,400
What do you mean?

1606
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:11,690
I dunno. You wiped me out

1607
01:32:13,490 --> 01:32:17,280
Some teachers, not me,

1608
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:18,620
...said if you carry on like this

1609
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:22,410
you'll be in trouble,

1610
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:25,000
...not wiped out.

1611
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:29,460
That's revenge. I don't get it 
 Why do for revenge?

1612
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,670
How come it's revenge?

1613
01:32:31,970 --> 01:32:36,600
If you say stuff about me 
 getting in trouble, that's revenge

1614
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:39,980
It's not revenge at all

1615
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:43,190
We're not on the streets

1616
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:46,520
It's a warning 
 Our goal here isn't revenge,

1617
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:50,020
...it's discipline

1618
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:52,280
- Get the difference? 
 - I don't get it.

1619
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:56,360
When a judge sends someone to jail,

1620
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:59,160
...he doesn't do it to get revenge

1621
01:32:59,410 --> 01:33:01,710
...It helps society run smoothly

1622
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:05,620
You just want revenge. 
 You're riffed with me.

1623
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,750
All I care about is revenge?

1624
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:11,340
I wake up and say 
 I'll get Souleymane today?

1625
01:33:11,630 --> 01:33:13,770
You insulted him yesterday anyhow.

1626
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:16,440
He really laid into you!

1627
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:17,470
I did not.

1628
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,360
What did he say, Louise?

1629
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:21,980
That you we're limited.

1630
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:23,740
...I underlined it, I was so shocked

1631
01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:26,780
Me? Limited?

1632
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:31,660
Brilliant...

1633
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:45,050
Esmeralda, Louise,

1634
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:49,340
...What's your role as class reps? 
 You represent the students

1635
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,970
to help this class work 
 or you stir up trouble for me?

1636
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:53,640
We just do our job.

1637
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:54,970
Wicked!

1638
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:56,780
We report on the meeting.

1639
01:33:57,190 --> 01:33:57,810
Of course.

1640
01:33:58,100 --> 01:33:59,690
I didn't realize

1641
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:02,070
When I saw you snigger

1642
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:05,190
...at the meeting, I felt bad for you

1643
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:07,780
It wasn't the place or time

1644
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:08,950
It didn't look very serious

1645
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:12,370
Nobody minded in any case

1646
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:13,740
- They did! 
 - Only you

1647
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,330
No, it bothered me and I think

1648
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:19,260
it bothered the others too

1649
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:21,670
No. It only bothered you

1650
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:27,100
Sorry, but laughing like that 
 made you look like two skanks.

1651
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:30,800
What? 
 Have you just lost it?

1652
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:32,180
That's a bad thing!

1653
01:34:35,230 --> 01:34:36,350
You can't dump on us

1654
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:38,270
The word is insult.

1655
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,480
You're crazy insulting on us.

1656
01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:43,310
You say "dump on" or "insult"

1657
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:45,870
It's either one or the other, ok.

1658
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:48,210
Yeah keep on talking!

1659
01:34:48,490 --> 01:34:50,910
In fact I never said 
 you we're skanks,

1660
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:52,280
...I said that at one point

1661
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:54,630
...in the meeting

1662
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:57,210
...you acted like skanks. 
 Understand?

1663
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:00,340
Don't try to con us, 
 you said skanks

1664
01:35:00,630 --> 01:35:03,040
I'm just explaining the difference.

1665
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:05,340
Sir, you don't talk to girls like that!

1666
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:08,140
Look who's talking!

1667
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:09,720
...You always insult everybody!

1668
01:35:10,010 --> 01:35:11,680
He wants revenge on the girls

1669
01:35:11,970 --> 01:35:15,820
No way. The noble knight 
 riding to rescue act,

1670
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:17,030
...won't wash!

1671
01:35:17,270 --> 01:35:19,150
You don't talk to me, man!

1672
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,520
Show some respect!

1673
01:35:21,810 --> 01:35:23,280
I will if I want!

1674
01:35:23,570 --> 01:35:25,330
You're heading for trouble!

1675
01:35:25,610 --> 01:35:26,730
Think you're tough?

1676
01:35:26,990 --> 01:35:29,660
It's a question of discipline!

1677
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:31,500
I'll take you anytime!

1678
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:33,130
Stop playing the big short

1679
01:35:33,410 --> 01:35:36,210
- Calm down 
 - Stay outta this

1680
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,300
Cut it out!

1681
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:38,960
Don't touch me!

1682
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:41,750
Don't touch me.

1683
01:35:42,010 --> 01:35:43,930
You're crazy!

1684
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:46,100
Cut it out

1685
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:49,980
What are you doing?

1686
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:51,020
I'm outta here

1687
01:35:51,310 --> 01:35:53,520
You can't just walk out of my class.

1688
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:55,150
Are you nuts?

1689
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,270
- Calm down 
 - Let go of me

1690
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:58,480
Stop it

1691
01:35:58,990 --> 01:36:00,620
- Let me go 
 - Ah!

1692
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:04,200
- Where are you going? 
 - Let go, fucker

1693
01:36:04,490 --> 01:36:05,170
Pathetic

1694
01:36:17,550 --> 01:36:18,340
Fuck

1695
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,890
What do we do?

1696
01:36:35,610 --> 01:36:39,940
I think we need to convene 
 the disciplinary committee

1697
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:42,190
This is starting to add up 
 it begins

1698
01:36:42,450 --> 01:36:45,170
with disrespect, then the fight,

1699
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:49,030
...with a student injured,

1700
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:53,460
...and finally he leaves the class 
 without permission.

1701
01:36:53,710 --> 01:36:57,580
There was only one incident 
 and it all spread out from there.

1702
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,640
One thing led to another,

1703
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,520
...a chain reaction.

1704
01:37:01,970 --> 01:37:02,980
Well

1705
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:06,550
...what I can do is take 
 a protective measure

1706
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,770
...since this is so serious

1707
01:37:09,010 --> 01:37:12,360
...by suspending Souleymane 
 for 48 hours.

1708
01:37:12,930 --> 01:37:14,990
That'll give us a little time

1709
01:37:15,230 --> 01:37:17,480
...to reach a decision

1710
01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:18,940
OK.

1711
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:21,290
Shall we do that?

1712
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:24,750
However, I need to see you tomorrow.

1713
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,370
Could you come to my office?

1714
01:37:27,630 --> 01:37:30,000
- Good bye. 
 - Good bye

1715
01:37:31,710 --> 01:37:32,960
Francois!

1716
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:36,840
I need a word with you

1717
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:40,350
There's a rumor going around...

1718
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,470
A rumor?

1719
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:46,480
Some students came to see me 
 and told me...

1720
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:51,150
...you insulted them

1721
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:55,820
Who? Louise and Esmeralda?

1722
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:57,400
They told me

1723
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:59,420
...you called them skanks

1724
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:01,240
...and that led to the incident

1725
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:03,040
...with Souleymane

1726
01:38:03,290 --> 01:38:05,500
And you believe them?

1727
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:07,880
That's why I needed to see you.

1728
01:38:08,130 --> 01:38:11,500
You didn't mention it 
 in your incident report...

1729
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:15,210
I didn't mention it. 
 What can I say?

1730
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:17,560
- Did you do it or not? 
 - What?

1731
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,300
- Did you... 
 - Hi!

1732
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:20,810
Hi.

1733
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:23,020
Did you call them skanks?

1734
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:25,470
But Souleymane's another matter!

1735
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:28,450
I know it had nothing to do with him

1736
01:38:28,690 --> 01:38:31,070
But word's getting around.

1737
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,440
People are talking. 
 I wanted

1738
01:38:33,730 --> 01:38:36,500
...to let you know 
 - Thanks for letting me know.

1739
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:51,010
Hey, you two 
 You complained about me.

1740
01:38:51,290 --> 01:38:53,380
- Thanks a lot! 
 - You're welcome

1741
01:38:54,050 --> 01:38:55,930
You could have talked to me

1742
01:38:56,220 --> 01:38:59,590
Teachers can complain about us 
 and vice versa, right?

1743
01:38:59,890 --> 01:39:01,400
No, it doesn't work both ways.

1744
01:39:04,010 --> 01:39:05,530
What are you after?

1745
01:39:05,810 --> 01:39:06,930
To see you punished

1746
01:39:07,230 --> 01:39:08,570
- Punished? 
 - Yes!

1747
01:39:08,850 --> 01:39:12,280
- You, punish me? 
 - You insulted us, you get punished.

1748
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:14,120
Where will that get you?

1749
01:39:14,450 --> 01:39:15,830
I'll have spoken out.

1750
01:39:16,110 --> 01:39:18,660
Great, that's a lot of use.

1751
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,870
Do you know what 'skank' means?

1752
01:39:21,130 --> 01:39:23,330
I never called you skanks!

1753
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:26,130
Yes, you did. For me 
 skank means prostitute.

1754
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:29,880
It's not that at all

1755
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:31,550
For me, it doesn't mean that.

1756
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:34,300
It's nothing important at all,

1757
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:38,060
just a girl laughing stupidly

1758
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:40,980
Hey, skank means prostitute, right?

1759
01:39:41,650 --> 01:39:43,400
You bet!

1760
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:45,490
- Will Souleymane get expelled? 
 - No.

1761
01:39:45,770 --> 01:39:48,110
- A disciplinary hearing? 
 - We don't know yet.

1762
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,400
It's a possibility

1763
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:53,570
Stop yelling 
 before anything is decided

1764
01:39:53,870 --> 01:39:56,410
It's all settled anyway

1765
01:39:56,700 --> 01:40:00,160
- Why say that? 
 - Because it's always the same!

1766
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:01,920
You're in no position to talk.

1767
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:05,720
You're the one who got hurt

1768
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:08,050
He didn't mean it

1769
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:09,930
There was a metal thing in his bag

1770
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:13,390
In any case he blew a fuse 
 and that's bad

1771
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:14,430
Sir,

1772
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,050
...anyone can blow a fuse

1773
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:18,070
And then calm down after

1774
01:40:18,350 --> 01:40:19,310
That's not sure

1775
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,180
- You did 
 - No!

1776
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:22,490
You're calmer now

1777
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:24,690
I'm not. You don't know me!

1778
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:27,280
All the teachers say 
 your attitude is perfect now...

1779
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:30,780
You think you've tamed me?

1780
01:40:31,570 --> 01:40:32,700
No, being sent here helped

1781
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:36,070
...you understand things, see?

1782
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:42,760
Teachers helped you

1783
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:45,290
and we'll do the same 
 for Souleymane.

1784
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:49,430
I say teachers who 
 expel students are fuckers

1785
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:54,340
Right on. 
 You want to repeat that?

1786
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:57,310
- Yeah, fuckers 
 - Everyone goes wild

1787
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,760
...over some word I said. You 
 say fucker and I shouldn't react?

1788
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:01,030
They're fuckers!

1789
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:03,320
Cut it out!

1790
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:08,240
You say skanks, we say fucker. 
 It's the same thing

1791
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,120
They're nothing alike

1792
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:13,710
A teacher can say certain things 
 that students can't say.

1793
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:16,250
Try to understand that!

1794
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:17,830
We have no right to speak?

1795
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:21,500
You keep talking all the time! 
 You never stop speaking

1796
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,880
Whenever we talk, you yell. 
 What is this?

1797
01:41:24,130 --> 01:41:25,850
Enough...

1798
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:35,600
Sir!

1799
01:41:37,810 --> 01:41:39,980
- Sir? 
 - What?

1800
01:41:42,490 --> 01:41:45,160
Will Souleymane get a hearing?

1801
01:41:45,910 --> 01:41:47,620
Give it a rest

1802
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:51,160
You sound like you want 
 him to. It fires you up.

1803
01:41:51,410 --> 01:41:54,510
You know what'll happen 
 if he's expelled?

1804
01:41:55,290 --> 01:41:56,930
He'll change schools.

1805
01:41:57,170 --> 01:41:58,830
No, he won't change schools.

1806
01:41:59,090 --> 01:42:01,880
It's automatic. It's obligatory.

1807
01:42:02,130 --> 01:42:03,850
That goes for Souleymane too.

1808
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:07,270
Do you know his father?

1809
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:09,260
I've seen him once or twice.

1810
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:10,940
No, you don't know him!

1811
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:13,890
If he's expelled, his dad'll 
 send him back to their village

1812
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:16,680
Don't get overdramatic

1813
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,320
He'll go back to Mali

1814
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,830
I think we all need 
 to keep our heads.

1815
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:24,910
Don't worry

1816
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:40,500
You can't smoke here sir

1817
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:44,600
I know, but since I was alone

1818
01:43:08,370 --> 01:43:11,420
Ok, you went too far 
 with those girls.

1819
01:43:11,670 --> 01:43:13,050
We all screw up.

1820
01:43:13,290 --> 01:43:15,130
Souleymane overreacted.

1821
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:16,460
He's right.

1822
01:43:16,710 --> 01:43:19,590
I saw Khoumba. 
 Her face was all bloody

1823
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:21,970
What he did is unacceptable.

1824
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:23,390
That's for sure.

1825
01:43:23,890 --> 01:43:25,560
I know that.

1826
01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:28,740
His bag hit her by accident.

1827
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:32,150
A split eybrow bleeds a lot. 
 That's all.

1828
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:35,270
You can't ignore it.

1829
01:43:35,570 --> 01:43:39,790
Don't take it to heart. 
 Seen how they talk to us?

1830
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:44,080
How's that relevant? 
 Souleymane is going to get expelled

1831
01:43:44,330 --> 01:43:46,380
...That's it!

1832
01:43:47,620 --> 01:43:49,960
- No. 
 - That's kind of logical.

1833
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,880
How many hearings last year?

1834
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,480
12 at least.

1835
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:03,600
Not that many.

1836
01:44:03,850 --> 01:44:04,690
He could be right.

1837
01:44:04,930 --> 01:44:08,640
I know, I'm on the committee 
 so I saw them all

1838
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:12,910
An average of two per month, 
 12 in all with an expulsion each time

1839
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:17,330
The hearing is where 
 we talk things over

1840
01:44:17,610 --> 01:44:20,450
Ok, 12 students were expelled

1841
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:23,120
but maybe there was no other solution.

1842
01:44:23,740 --> 01:44:26,920
12 out of 12

1843
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:29,760
...talk about debate!

1844
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:32,840
But 12 out of 12 just means

1845
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:36,930
...when a student has a hearing, 
 it's too late.

1846
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:38,760
Or it was justified.

1847
01:44:39,010 --> 01:44:42,060
Ok, things happen 
 that lead to a hearing

1848
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:44,140
But then what happens?

1849
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:46,930
What do we expect from a hearing?

1850
01:44:47,190 --> 01:44:48,690
There are prior stages:

1851
01:44:48,970 --> 01:44:51,860
Pre-disciplinary committees,

1852
01:44:52,110 --> 01:44:55,200
...we inform the parents, 
 the students are warned...

1853
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:59,330
- Not in this case. 
 - We've no time.

1854
01:44:59,580 --> 01:45:01,500
It's pretty rare.

1855
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:05,890
It's rare because we have 
 this final punishment

1856
01:45:06,130 --> 01:45:08,970
...that allows us to ignore 
 the prior steps.

1857
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:11,920
And even if we did use them,

1858
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:15,470
...the simple fact 
 of expelling a student...

1859
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:20,400
...is a disavowal 
 of everything we have tried.

1860
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:24,390
Ok, but it's Souleymane's chance 
 to justify himself

1861
01:45:24,650 --> 01:45:27,270
At a hearing, you don't speak.

1862
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,070
You're scared. You're paralyzed.

1863
01:45:30,570 --> 01:45:31,730
Exactly.

1864
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:34,030
Let me sum up.

1865
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:37,990
He'll get a disciplinary hearing, 
 he'll be expelled

1866
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:40,780
and maybe even sent back to Mali

1867
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:43,080
You're being overdramatic.

1868
01:45:43,330 --> 01:45:44,970
No, I'm not

1869
01:45:45,250 --> 01:45:48,630
Students who know him better 
 than any of us here,

1870
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:53,180
...who know his father, 
 say that he is likely Mali...

1871
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:55,230
to send him back to Mali after this

1872
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:59,020
Some are threatened

1873
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:02,440
...with boarding school 
 but in never happens

1874
01:46:02,930 --> 01:46:04,740
It can happen.

1875
01:46:05,190 --> 01:46:08,950
A lot of parents spend their time

1876
01:46:09,230 --> 01:46:13,030
...threatening their kids with that. 
 You can't take it into account

1877
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:18,920
- Even if there was just a slight risk 
 that a hearing could lead

1878
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:22,830
to him being sent back, 
 I don't think I can take that risk.

1879
01:46:25,410 --> 01:46:27,330
It's like when you hesitate

1880
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:30,350
...over punishing a kid 
 because when he goes home,

1881
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:32,840
once that door closes,

1882
01:46:33,090 --> 01:46:35,230
...he'll get a beating 
 from his parents

1883
01:46:35,470 --> 01:46:38,020
We've all seen that

1884
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:39,350
...But we still have to punish

1885
01:46:39,610 --> 01:46:41,860
them when they go too far

1886
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:44,190
Whatever the consequences

1887
01:46:44,490 --> 01:46:46,190
which don't

1888
01:46:46,450 --> 01:46:48,200
...concern you!

1889
01:46:48,450 --> 01:46:50,030
So I ignore that?

1890
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:53,030
I know punishment 
 can have such a consequence,

1891
01:46:53,290 --> 01:46:55,620
...but I turn a blind eye, is that it?

1892
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:59,750
You can't take it into account 
 in every case

1893
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,710
The violence…

1894
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:06,170
him being sent back...

1895
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:09,050
- No more Christmas presents... 
 - True, you have to consider it

1896
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:10,130
but after a while...

1897
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:12,890
It's a question of principle

1898
01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:15,430
...We each have a role to play

1899
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:18,440
We can't substitute 
 ourselves for the parents

1900
01:47:20,270 --> 01:47:22,440
Sorry, but if I rewind the movie,

1901
01:47:22,690 --> 01:47:26,040
...it's a weird chain of events. 
 It starts with reprimands,

1902
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:29,660
...when Souleymane forget 
 his things, talks back.

1903
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:33,370
We punish him. Again and again,

1904
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:35,790
until a disciplinary hearing

1905
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:39,550
leading to who knows what 
 Everything gets out of hand

1906
01:47:39,790 --> 01:47:42,040
Sure, looking at it that way

1907
01:47:42,330 --> 01:47:44,590
it's really shocking

1908
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:49,390
But the school won't 
 expelling Souleymane

1909
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:52,400
He's been gone for a while

1910
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:33,840
Francois, I didn't 
 expect you so soon.

1911
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:37,190
Have you reached a decision?

1912
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:40,940
I don't think I have much choice.

1913
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:48,450
By the way, Julie told me…

1914
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:51,700
you had a heated exchange

1915
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,040
...with two girls in your class.

1916
01:48:54,290 --> 01:48:57,880
Yes, the two class reps 
 but it happened first so

1917
01:48:58,130 --> 01:49:01,140
You apparently 
 called them "skanks"

1918
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:03,130
Let's say that, yes

1919
01:49:03,380 --> 01:49:07,470
That complicates things, 
 but the problem remains.

1920
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:10,640
I'd like you to mention it 
 in your report

1921
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:15,110
I don't want it used against us 
 at the disciplinary hearing.

1922
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:18,610
Don't bother hiding it, 
 just write it down.

1923
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:20,330
I understand.

1924
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:24,570
I'll let you reread this

1925
01:49:24,820 --> 01:49:27,620
before we launch the procedure.

1926
01:49:27,870 --> 01:49:30,410
So I… I just need to add...

1927
01:49:30,950 --> 01:49:33,580
Yes, without going into detail.

1928
01:49:34,870 --> 01:49:36,290
Does that suit you?

1929
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:37,790
OK.

1930
01:50:06,780 --> 01:50:10,000
Can you take the minute.

1931
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:25,270
- Hello 
 - Hello.

1932
01:50:26,230 --> 01:50:27,510
Hello, sir.

1933
01:50:27,770 --> 01:50:29,730
- Please sit down. 
 - Thanks.

1934
01:51:05,140 --> 01:51:08,940
"Carl tried to reason with him, 
 but Souleyman broke free,

1935
01:51:09,190 --> 01:51:12,120
"winging his bag that hit Khoumba 
 in the face.

1936
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:15,620
"He left, insulting everyone 
 and slamming the door.

1937
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:18,900
"I didn't go after him 
 because I needed...

1938
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:22,450
"to help Khoumba 
 whose eybrow was bleeding. "

1939
01:51:22,870 --> 01:51:26,540
Those are the facts 
 that led to today's hearing

1940
01:51:26,830 --> 01:51:30,750
Madame, it doesn't mean 
 Souleyman is a bad boy.

1941
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:33,180
That's not we're saying

1942
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:36,000
But, sometimes, 
 a student in a class

1943
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:39,930
through voluntary or 
 involuntary behavior,

1944
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:42,340
can create an atmosphere that...

1945
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:45,180
...prevents the class from working.

1946
01:52:00,110 --> 01:52:02,960
Do you understand 
 what we're saying?

1947
01:52:04,620 --> 01:52:05,910
If I may say something, it's true

1948
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,510
there had been number of signs

1949
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:11,550
that should have warned us.

1950
01:52:11,790 --> 01:52:14,210
We could have reacted sooner

1951
01:52:15,340 --> 01:52:18,880
But how we have to deal 
 with an incident

1952
01:52:19,140 --> 01:52:21,270
that is fairy violent

1953
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:23,600
and that's simply unacceptable.

1954
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:27,770
I'd like to know 
 if you realize that, Souleymane?

1955
01:52:31,610 --> 01:52:35,320
We're not saying you're 
 deliberately violent.

1956
01:52:35,580 --> 01:52:38,830
The problem is you can't control 
 what you say,

1957
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:40,840
...and what you do

1958
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:44,920
You're here to express 
 your point of view.

1959
01:52:45,170 --> 01:52:48,550
Go ahead

1960
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:52,100
I don't give a damn. 
 I've got nothing to say

1961
01:52:52,590 --> 01:52:54,430
Do whatever you want to do

1962
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:06,570
Excuse me...

1963
01:53:16,620 --> 01:53:18,120
Can you translate?

1964
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:21,380
She says I'm a good boy

1965
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:25,370
I do my homework.

1966
01:53:32,090 --> 01:53:36,480
I help my brothers and sisters 
 with their work when I can

1967
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:46,450
I always wash the dishes 
 and help her when I can

1968
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:53,160
We don't doubt he's a good son. 
 That's not the problem.

1969
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:54,830
Let's consider

1970
01:53:55,070 --> 01:53:56,750
...his school record

1971
01:53:56,990 --> 01:53:59,920
Excuse me, but could we focus 
 on the facts here?

1972
01:54:00,370 --> 01:54:03,010
Firstly, I'd like to say

1973
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:07,680
...that we're surprised to see 
 the teacher involved in the incident

1974
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:09,510
...on this committee

1975
01:54:09,810 --> 01:54:11,970
We find it highly irregular

1976
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:16,740
It's true. It's odd 
 to be both judge and litigant.

1977
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:18,810
First of all,

1978
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:22,400
...Mr. Marin was elected 
 to the administrative board.

1979
01:54:22,690 --> 01:54:24,900
as the teachers' representative

1980
01:54:25,150 --> 01:54:29,160
Moreover, I think 
 that the incident...

1981
01:54:29,410 --> 01:54:31,580
...that occurred in 
 Mr. Marin's class

1982
01:54:31,830 --> 01:54:34,450
...doesn't involve the teacher 
 directly.

1983
01:54:34,710 --> 01:54:36,660
I'm sorry, you mention

1984
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:39,790
...some harsh words

1985
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:41,340
...spoken by the teacher...

1986
01:54:41,590 --> 01:54:44,270
Apparently, you used 
 the word "skanks"

1987
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:47,180
...to describe the class reps. 
 And that's a problem

1988
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:48,760
I did say that

1989
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:52,100
...but it wasn't something 
 that concerned Souleymane.

1990
01:54:52,350 --> 01:54:56,180
I think he used the excuse 
 of a rather heated exchange

1991
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:58,240
...to express the bad mood

1992
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:01,910
that he was in that day.

1993
01:55:02,150 --> 01:55:03,700
He tried to defend them

1994
01:55:03,940 --> 01:55:06,110
So I feel that it's relevant

1995
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:09,210
Sorry, but absolutely 
 nothing justifies

1996
01:55:09,450 --> 01:55:12,330
...being disrespectful to a teacher,

1997
01:55:12,580 --> 01:55:16,660
...insulting everyone and leaving 
 a class without permission.

1998
01:55:19,170 --> 01:55:21,750
Souleymane, do you 
 have anything to say?

1999
01:55:23,380 --> 01:55:25,600
I don't know. What can I say?

2000
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:37,440
Souleymane?

2001
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:43,200
- What did she say? 
 - The same thing again

2002
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:55,960
Souleymane?

2003
01:55:56,830 --> 01:55:59,130
She apologizes on my behalf.

2004
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:06,880
You can come back in now.

2005
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:32,770
Madame, the committee 
 has conferred

2006
01:57:33,020 --> 01:57:36,870
and has decided to expel Souleymane 
 from the school for good.

2007
01:57:37,110 --> 01:57:40,570
You will receive the ruling 
 by registered mail

2008
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:43,290
...and have eight days to appeal,

2009
01:57:51,380 --> 01:57:55,550
We shall do our best to find 
 Souleymane another school

2010
01:57:59,350 --> 01:58:01,310
Goodbye, Messieurs, Mesdames

2011
01:58:04,850 --> 01:58:09,480
Souleymane, come to see me 
 before the end of the week, please.

2012
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:44,150
Mathematical proportionality.

2013
01:58:45,730 --> 01:58:50,400
This year, you learned 
 mathematical proportionality?

2014
01:58:50,900 --> 01:58:54,860
- I liked science 
 - What you learned, not liked.

2015
01:58:55,110 --> 01:58:57,700
If you liked it, you learned.

2016
01:58:57,990 --> 01:58:59,710
So what did you learn?

2017
01:59:00,450 --> 01:59:04,130
All about volcanoes, earthquakes,

2018
01:59:04,410 --> 01:59:05,960
...plates...

2019
01:59:06,210 --> 01:59:08,590
Convergence and divergence,

2020
01:59:08,830 --> 01:59:11,680
...movement of the Earth's plates,

2021
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:15,010
- It was fascinating. 
 - It interested you?

2022
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:16,430
- Yeah. 
 - Good.

2023
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:20,760
Well, in mathematics,

2024
01:59:21,430 --> 01:59:23,600
.. trigonometry Pythagoras 
 theorem, Thales theorem.

2025
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:25,480
I'll stop you there.

2026
01:59:25,730 --> 01:59:28,900
You can't sit there and brag...

2027
01:59:29,150 --> 01:59:31,370
...you learned Pythagoras theorem. 
 Recite it for us

2028
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:37,040
If, in a triangle

2029
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:41,160
...two sides are equal to

2030
01:59:41,530 --> 01:59:43,670
...If the square rot

2031
01:59:43,910 --> 01:59:45,340
If the square of two sides

2032
01:59:45,580 --> 01:59:48,760
is equal to the square

2033
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:52,130
...the square of the hypotenuse

2034
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:54,180
then the triangle's a rectangle.

2035
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:56,930
More or less, yes

2036
01:59:57,180 --> 01:59:58,470
It's spot on

2037
01:59:58,730 --> 02:00:01,520
All right. I believe you.

2038
02:00:01,980 --> 02:00:04,830
In history, I learned 
 about triangular trade.

2039
02:00:05,070 --> 02:00:09,460
The fact that ships left Europe...

2040
02:00:10,910 --> 02:00:14,870
...with manufactured goods that 
 they took to Africa to trade for men,

2041
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:17,740
...who'd became slaves 
 that they took to America to work.

2042
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,370
Then they took the money 
 they made back to Europe.

2043
02:00:21,630 --> 02:00:23,670
That's triangular trade

2044
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:26,130
Chemistry

2045
02:00:26,420 --> 02:00:28,170
What in chemistry?

2046
02:00:28,630 --> 02:00:30,130
Combustion

2047
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:31,840
What's that?

2048
02:00:32,090 --> 02:00:36,260
Blending Fehling's solution 
 and glucose.

2049
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:37,560
What do you get?

2050
02:00:38,350 --> 02:00:40,850
Heat up test-tube,

2051
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:42,910
...and it changes color.

2052
02:00:44,690 --> 02:00:47,540
- What's the interest? 
 - The interest?

2053
02:00:47,780 --> 02:00:52,250
I dunno. Why teach it to us 
 if there's no interest?

2054
02:00:53,490 --> 02:00:54,910
Reproduction

2055
02:00:56,830 --> 02:01:00,170
What did you learn 
 about human reproduction?

2056
02:01:00,540 --> 02:01:02,120
Human reproduction...

2057
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:04,580
Well, the sperm

2058
02:01:05,250 --> 02:01:06,720
...gets into the ovum

2059
02:01:07,090 --> 02:01:08,720
then you wait 9 months,

2060
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:12,420
then you do a sonogram 
 and then it comes out

2061
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:14,430
The sperm does?

2062
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:15,760
No, the baby

2063
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:18,900
The human being that's inside.

2064
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:21,320
- Khoumba? 
 - Me?

2065
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:23,740
Yes. That is your name?

2066
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:25,190
Yes.

2067
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:31,400
In music, I learned to play 
 the alto recorder...

2068
02:01:32,450 --> 02:01:34,040
and in Spanish

2069
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:36,250
The recorder in Spanish?

2070
02:01:36,530 --> 02:01:38,920
No, in music, I learned

2071
02:01:39,170 --> 02:01:41,850
to play the alto recorder. 
 - Right

2072
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:44,050
- And other stuff in Spanish 
 - Good.

2073
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:46,930
Can you say something 
 to us in Spanish?

2074
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:59,020
- And that means? 
 - "It's the vacation soon".

2075
02:02:03,030 --> 02:02:04,780
I didn't learn anything

2076
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:10,420
You cant spend 9 months at 
 school and not learn anything.

2077
02:02:10,870 --> 02:02:13,550
I'm the living proof

2078
02:02:13,830 --> 02:02:16,330
You got something 
 from the books we read.

2079
02:02:16,580 --> 02:02:18,550
- Your books are shite. 
 - They're what?

2080
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:20,390
They're useless.

2081
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:24,390
What about a book 
 you read by yourself?

2082
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:28,180
The books I read?

2083
02:02:28,430 --> 02:02:31,010
Well, there's The Republic

2084
02:02:35,100 --> 02:02:36,230
Platon's "Republic"?

2085
02:02:36,810 --> 02:02:39,570
You read that?

2086
02:02:40,730 --> 02:02:42,030
How come?

2087
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:45,700
My big sister had it

2088
02:02:46,110 --> 02:02:48,580
- She does philosophy? 
 - No, law

2089
02:02:49,780 --> 02:02:51,130
So what's it about?

2090
02:02:51,790 --> 02:02:54,260
Well, there's this guy...

2091
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:56,130
His name's Socrates

2092
02:02:56,420 --> 02:02:57,800
Yeah, Socrates.

2093
02:02:59,460 --> 02:03:02,970
He stops people in the street 
 and asks them:

2094
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:06,890
"Are you sure of thinking 
 what you think?"

2095
02:03:07,130 --> 02:03:09,940
"Are you sure of doing 
 what you do? and so on?"

2096
02:03:10,180 --> 02:03:13,190
After that, people 
 start getting confused.

2097
02:03:13,430 --> 02:03:15,150
They ask questions.

2098
02:03:15,390 --> 02:03:17,030
The guy's too much

2099
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:19,690
What does he ask people about?

2100
02:03:19,980 --> 02:03:21,240
Everything.

2101
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:26,330
Love, religion, God 
 people, everything

2102
02:03:27,860 --> 02:03:29,540
- It's good you read it 
 - I know

2103
02:03:30,210 --> 02:03:32,250
It's not a skank's book!

2104
02:03:38,340 --> 02:03:42,480
Wait a second. Before you leave, 
 here are your self-portraits

2105
02:03:42,760 --> 02:03:46,180
One by one. When you have 
 yours, you can go.

2106
02:03:46,810 --> 02:03:48,360
What is it?

2107
02:03:52,940 --> 02:03:54,150
What is it?

2108
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:57,440
These are the self-portraits 
 that you wrote

2109
02:03:57,700 --> 02:04:00,280
...and that we made up 
 with the class photo and so on

2110
02:04:00,530 --> 02:04:01,780
You too, Eva.

2111
02:04:04,450 --> 02:04:05,870
You don't have one?

2112
02:04:08,580 --> 02:04:11,510
- You look good in it 
 - Cut it out

2113
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:14,510
You're like a leader

2114
02:04:14,750 --> 02:04:16,310
Very good.

2115
02:04:17,510 --> 02:04:19,260
- Good bye, Sir. 
 - Good bye.

2116
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:23,140
- Have a good vacation. 
 - You too

2117
02:04:30,020 --> 02:04:31,820
- Sir? 
 - Yes…

2118
02:04:33,650 --> 02:04:35,370
What is it?

2119
02:04:36,690 --> 02:04:38,410
I didn't learn anything

2120
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:42,070
What? That doesn't mean anything

2121
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:47,040
Earlier, all the others...

2122
02:04:47,290 --> 02:04:49,760
...said they'd learned something

2123
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:53,120
Compared to them, I learned nothing

2124
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:56,420
You learned as much as them

2125
02:04:56,670 --> 02:04:58,890
They had to think hard too.

2126
02:04:59,130 --> 02:05:00,930
It's not easy

2127
02:05:01,180 --> 02:05:05,680
to remember what you learned...

2128
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:08,280
But I don't understand

2129
02:05:09,350 --> 02:05:10,480
What do you mean?

2130
02:05:11,310 --> 02:05:13,480
I don't understand what we do.

2131
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:15,370
In French?

2132
02:05:16,150 --> 02:05:17,530
In school

2133
02:05:19,240 --> 02:05:23,460
You can't say you don't 
 understand everything.

2134
02:05:24,330 --> 02:05:26,130
That's not true...

2135
02:05:29,210 --> 02:05:31,790
I don't want to go 
 to vocational school.

2136
02:05:32,970 --> 02:05:35,460
There's no question of that yet

2137
02:05:36,260 --> 02:05:38,220
You're moving on to the next year.

2138
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:43,320
You'll have plenty of time 
 to think about your future

2139
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:46,700
Vocational school isn't 
 an absolute certainty

2140
02:05:46,980 --> 02:05:49,440
It all depends on how you do next year

2141
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:52,700
But I don't want to.

2142
02:05:52,700 --> 02:16:19,370
