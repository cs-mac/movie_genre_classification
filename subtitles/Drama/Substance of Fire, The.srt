This program is made possible in part
by the Ministry of Culture...

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,590
and the Korea Creative Content Agency.

4
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,360
Look at me. Your name?

5
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,360
Jung, Sire.

6
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,260
Jung.

7
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,350
Well, well.

8
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,400
And you made this?

9
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,060
Yes, Sire.

10
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,390
I get regular kiln reports, of course.

11
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,620
But this...

12
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,260
Father.

13
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,660
Father!

14
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,200
Artisans Yi Kangchon and Yu Euldam,
hear and obey.

15
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,660
His Majesty will select
the master artisan of Punwon Kiln.

16
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,200
We hear and obey.

17
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,390
A contest? And Artisan Yi?

18
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,290
What about him?

19
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,400
It's all right.

20
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:10,060
Royal ceramics are beyond a man
like Yu Euldam.

21
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,690
That's just perfect.

22
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,190
What is our nation's
most precious commodity?

23
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,990
Royal white porcelain.

24
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,990
And Punwon
is the finest of the royal kilns.

25
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,090
We must control those funds.

26
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,220
The master artisan must be our man.

27
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,390
Understood?

28
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,390
Yes, Your Majesty.

29
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,390
Go see Artisan Yi.

30
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,090
Artisan Yi.

31
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,290
Hurts the pride, doesn't it?

32
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,760
Who is Euldam?

33
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,390
A potter, a plodder, a nothing.

34
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,460
I will run the Punwon Kiln.

35
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,320
I'll sponge away today's humiliation.

36
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,390
I will do the Royal House honor.

37
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,790
No doubt.

38
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,390
But...

39
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,390
...suppose you don't...

40
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,920
You don't believe in me?

41
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,390
I do. But I'm not His Majesty.

42
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,090
Hello.

43
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,460
It's just you?

44
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,890
Did our artisans get the news?

45
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,560
Actually, sir...

46
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,390
I expect your finest work.

47
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,790
For me.

48
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,260
They're with Artisan Yi.

49
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,920
Then we should hurry.

50
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,420
Why haven't they started
stomping the clay?

51
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,690
Well...

52
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,390
Go on.

53
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:11,390
They took the Mt. Bong clay
you set aside.

54
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,390
Did they?

55
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,460
But it isn't resistant to heat.
He doesn't like it.

56
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:26,390
It's clear he intends to hurt you
with this contest.

57
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,020
All we have left is clay from Sonchon?

58
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,390
Yes, sir.

59
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,260
Good enough.

60
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,390
It's time I experimented
with Sonchon clay anyway.

61
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,390
But sir!

62
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,660
Maybe any other time.

63
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,890
But when the master artisan chair
is at stake?

64
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,790
I have you, Yonok.

65
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,520
You worked with Yi.
You know how he uses Sonchon clay.

66
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,360
This is your chance to shine.

67
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,390
My lord.

68
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,990
Let's get started.

69
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,390
Yes, sir.

70
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,390
A blessing on you. And on you.

71
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,390
Oh, and you. A huge blessing on you.

72
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,390
And you!

73
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,490
Your work always has such rustic charm.

74
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,790
Oh?

75
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:31,390
No one can match
the delicate purity of yours.

76
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,890
Feeling confident?

77
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,390
You seem quite sure of yourself.

78
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,390
I had a dream.

79
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,260
She seemed like she was my daughter.

80
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,400
And for her to present
her porcelain to the King?

81
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,390
We all have dreams.

82
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:59,390
With age, you get farther from that
especially since you are unmarried.

83
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,460
This way.

84
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,390
So white, the cherry blossoms
are so delicate.

85
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,390
I've been seated
on the royal throne numerous times.

86
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:26,390
Such form, such color...

87
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,390
But it's been years since
I've seen anything like it.

88
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,390
This is your work?

89
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,390
I had that honor.

90
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,390
Well?

91
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,720
Yes, Sire.

92
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:47,320
A work worthy of your noble forefathers.

93
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,020
Have Artisan Yi craft the royal porcelain.

94
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,390
Yes, Sire.

95
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,390
What have we here?

96
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,390
A colorful finger bowl?

97
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,690
Your Majesty, if I may?

98
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,390
Please.

99
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,620
It may not look like much at first.

100
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,590
But over time it has a peaceful effect.

101
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,190
Not much is right.

102
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,390
But oddly enough...

103
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:40,390
...its lack of artifice does my heart good.

104
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,890
Artisan Yu.

105
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,460
Sire.

106
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:49,390
You will craft the royal tea services.

107
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,390
You honor me, Sire.

108
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:59,160
Sire, if Artisan Yi crafts the porcelain
and Yu the tea services...

109
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,160
...who has won today?

110
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,390
There can be only one master artisan.

111
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,490
I'll have to choose.

112
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:14,390
Sire, with a tea service,
utility far outweighs cosmetics.

113
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,420
Perhaps a sip or two?

114
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,720
Perhaps you will do the honors?

115
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,160
Yes, Sire.

116
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,860
Your Majesty!

117
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,120
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

118
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,390
Treason! Poison!

119
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,390
Guards! Where are my guards!

120
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,390
Guards!

121
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,390
Protect His Majesty!

122
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,760
Sire.

123
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,390
Is this your glaze?

124
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,390
Definitely.

125
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,390
The poison didn't come
from the kitchens or the eunuchs.

126
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:52,390
The problem lies in your glaze
on your cup.

127
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,060
Confess.

128
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:01,190
It's unforgivable.
There can be no pardon.

129
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,790
What did you use?

130
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,390
Arsenic?

131
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:13,390
Sire, there is no poison in my glaze,
none at all.

132
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,520
Believe me.

133
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,990
Traitor! Her Majesty is dead.

134
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,090
No poison? Believe you?

135
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:24,390
Men! Kill him!

136
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,390
Sire.

137
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,790
No, no.

138
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,390
Not so fast.

139
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:35,690
He wouldn't have dared
to do this on his own.

140
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,390
Who is it? Confess.

141
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,390
Who put you up to it?

142
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,120
I am innocent!

143
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,390
I'll drink every drop of glaze...

144
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,520
...if it will prove it to you.

145
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,790
Sire, Sire!

146
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,390
It wasn't poison.

147
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:09,390
She suffered from an allergy.

148
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,560
An allergy?

149
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,390
She was allergic to peach blossoms.

150
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,790
A light case can cause itching.

151
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,490
A severe case
can cause unconsciousness.

152
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,860
Fortunately, she's awake
and feeling better.

153
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,920
You! Does your glaze
contain peach blossoms?

154
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,260
This was due to my carelessness.

155
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,390
It was Her Royal Majesty.

156
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,860
This is high treason.

157
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,860
High treason.

158
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,390
Why did you use peach blossoms?

159
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,390
Did you know of
Her Majesty's condition?

160
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,720
Never, Sire.

161
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,390
The peach blossoms...

162
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,390
Sire.

163
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,820
He didn't know.

164
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,390
We've worked together for years.

165
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,020
He has committed no crime.

166
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,990
Please, Sire.

167
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,390
No crime?

168
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:49,390
Her Majesty's life was threatened
and there is no crime?

169
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,390
Is that it?

170
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,390
Your pardon, Sire.

171
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,390
I merely...

172
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,020
And you...

173
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,620
...have been misled.

174
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,960
Your thoughts?

175
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,390
I assumed his only thoughts
were of pottery.

176
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:32,790
Thought he only knew of pottery,
but he knews when to stand up.

177
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,090
He may be the man
to run the Punwon Kiln.

178
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:42,090
His Majesty said that?

179
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,390
Yes.

180
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:50,390
From the looks of things,
the heavens must be smiling on us.

181
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:57,390
How did you learn of her allergy?

182
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,390
At a picnic.

183
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,520
She's in good health so it's fine.

184
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,390
But if she were in premature labor
and ill...

185
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:20,160
Yi Kangchon has been named
Master Artisan of the Punwon Kiln.

186
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,390
Congratulations, sir.

187
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,390
Congratulations.

188
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,390
My lord.

189
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:33,400
Please, my lord,
is this because of the glaze?

190
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,400
What about Artisan Yu?

191
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,530
My lord, my lord.

192
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
I said no.

193
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,060
Please, just a peek.

194
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,920
I beg you.

195
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,790
...Absolutely not...

196
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,390
Sir.

197
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,400
Sir.

198
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,790
How did you get in?

199
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:08,790
You're here because of me.

200
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,960
It wasn't you.

201
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,390
I made the glaze.

202
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:19,420
He put me over the tea services.

203
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:29,990
He said the designs did his heart good.

204
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,390
Sir.

205
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:37,390
I was worried I might not get to tell you.

206
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,360
Now it's all right.

207
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:49,390
I wouldn't have tried to be
master artisan without you.

208
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,390
As a woman you can never be an artisan.

209
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:57,720
Yet despite that you never gave up.

210
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,320
I admire that about you.

211
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:12,390
I let ambition rule my service
to the King.

212
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,390
A type of treason in a way.

213
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,390
Serve Lord Yi well.

214
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:25,720
Become a Bunwon artisan.

215
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,990
The first artisan in our country.

216
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,960
Wherever I am...

217
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,890
...in this life or the next...

218
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,760
...I'll be watching over you.

219
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,890
My lord.

220
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,290
[Euldam]

221
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,390
Such a flimsy bit of nothing...

222
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,690
...does his heart good?

223
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,390
His discerning eye surprised me.

224
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:26,390
If the Queen hadn't been there,
things would have been different.

225
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:34,390
But in the end
you were made master artisan.

226
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:44,390
My troubles with Euldam are finally over.

227
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:49,720
More importantly, look after the Kiln.

228
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,520
It will do no good to speak of this again.

229
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,390
Remember that.

230
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,520
My lord.

231
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:20,020
Why did you
give me the peach blossoms?

232
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:25,390
Their sugar content improves
the delicacy of the glaze.

233
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,690
It's the right glaze for Sonchon clay.

234
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,360
But you already knew that.

235
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,390
Is that why you took the rest of the clay?

236
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:40,490
So Lord Yu would be forced
to use my glaze?

237
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,390
Watch it.

238
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:47,390
I'm going to the Inquisitor's Office.

239
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:54,490
I'll tell them you said to use
the peach blossoms.

240
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:09,390
You would lie to them?

241
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,620
The real liar here... is you.

242
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:23,890
And your dream to become an artisan?

243
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:28,420
Don't let emotion get in your way.

244
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,120
I could help...

245
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,590
I have given everything...

246
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,990
...to be an artisan.

247
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:46,390
Including not killing myself
after that night with you.

248
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:51,390
But now I know...

249
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:58,160
There is no dream more precious to me...

250
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,860
...than Lord Yu.

251
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,520
You're not...

252
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:12,260
You're not in love with Euldam?

253
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:17,260
You think I would dare?

254
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:21,530
You know me better than that.

255
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,220
You open your mouth about the glaze...

256
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:32,390
...and you will die.

257
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,560
Be that as it may.

258
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,420
I must save Lord Yu.

259
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,120
I'm going to the inquisitors at dawn.

260
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,060
Worthless, pathetic...

261
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:59,390
Euldam, Euldam, Euldam!

262
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,720
Mapung.

263
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,390
No...

264
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,660
I'm...

265
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,420
I'm pregnant...

266
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,390
I'm in labor.

267
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:36,390
You know as well as I who the father is.

268
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:42,960
Will you kill your lord's own blood?

269
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,390
Go tell him.

270
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:51,390
I had a vision that the child
would be a divine artisan.

271
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,390
What? A baby?

272
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,390
'A divine artisan?'

273
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,890
You can't have another.

274
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,360
It's no laughing matter.

275
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:28,390
Another child will cost you
wealth, power, position, everything.

276
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,460
The signs are clear.

277
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,390
Father.

278
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:42,990
Yukdo, shouldn't you be in bed?

279
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:47,320
I nearly dozed off
waiting to tell you congratulations.

280
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,490
But then I didn't, tho.

281
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:53,390
It's late. Get some sleep.

282
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,390
I would wait all night.

283
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:04,190
I'm that proud of you being named
Master Artisan of the Punwon Kiln.

284
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:11,390
I want to be the bestest artisan ever
just like you.

285
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:16,390
And you will. You will.

286
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,390
Now off to bed, Yukdo.

287
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,660
Yes, Father.

288
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:31,390
Yukdo is all I need.

289
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,400
Thank you, my lady.

290
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,760
This is a great day.

291
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,390
I hereby declare a general amnesty.

292
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:50,390
Yu Euldam, you are stripped of rank and
expelled from the Punwon Kiln.

293
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,720
Yonok.

294
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,690
Is it you?

295
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,390
My lord.

296
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,390
Yonok, what is this?

297
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,390
Why are you...?

298
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:34,390
This baby... it's not...

299
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:38,420
You're not a dream?

300
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,390
You're really here?

301
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:50,460
Yes, it's me. It's no dream.
What is all this?

302
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:58,390
My lord, please don't ask... my baby...

303
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,390
...my baby...

304
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,390
I'll get a doctor.

305
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,690
My lord.

306
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,320
He'll be here any minute.

307
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:15,390
The baby... please... my baby...

308
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,390
He'll be here? Who?

309
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,960
My lord, please...

310
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,290
First we have to get out of here.

311
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,090
Give me the baby.

312
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,490
My girl.

313
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:43,760
Someday she will make porcelain
for the King.

314
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,390
Of course.

315
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:50,460
Now give her here and let's go.

316
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,890
First swear.

317
00:30:52,890 --> 00:31:02,390
Swear you'll look after her
if anything happens to me.

318
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:06,320
I swear, now come on.

319
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,390
Yonok!

320
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,390
Yonok!

321
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:58,390
Yonok! Yonok...

322
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,190
No, Yonok...!

323
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,390
Yes.

324
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,490
Everything I have is yours, Yukdo.

325
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,920
You will grow up to be
the finest artisan in the land.

326
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:58,390
Yonok, can you see us?

327
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:01,160
Your little girl...

328
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,390
No, my little girl.

329
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:11,290
I dreamed of having a girl
that would make porcelain for the King.

330
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:20,590
I will rear her to be the first artisan
in our nation. Wait and see.

331
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:24,390
I swear it.

332
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:30,060
Goodness, look at that.

333
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,390
Here, one second.

334
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:40,160
Such a shame. Here.

335
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:49,390
There, there, hungry, sweetie?

336
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,660
That's it, that's right, there you go.

337
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:02,760
Artisan-schmartisan. Forget that.

338
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,420
Why do I have to do this every day?

339
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,660
Mine always fall apart.

340
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,260
Maybe if you didn't smack it so hard.

341
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,390
Huh? Who smacks what?

342
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:43,390
The old mister says yours leak.

343
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:46,390
Leak? Really?

344
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:49,220
I wonder why?

345
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,520
Hwalyong, Dad doesn't know, right?

346
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,560
The master said you'd make
three times the number that leaked.

347
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,160
Jung.

348
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,390
It's Taedo.

349
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,920
Taedo!

350
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,120
Taedo!

351
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,860
What were you doing?

352
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,760
Just makin' stuff.

353
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Turn around... turn around... turn around

354
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:40,100
An arrow... pshew-pshew...!

355
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Nice and easy.

356
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,990
Like this?

357
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,460
Eyes on the bear.

358
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,390
Chin in, neck here.

359
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,520
Shoulders straight.

360
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,560
When do I fire?

361
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,390
Hold your breath.

362
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,360
Now.

363
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,120
Now?

364
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,820
I can't.

365
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,320
I'm better with a sword.

366
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,390
Gimme that, it's dangerous.

367
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:16,390
Yu Jung, Swordmaster Extraordinaire.

368
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,990
Stop, Jung.

369
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:21,520
Jung... Jung, stop.

370
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,020
Jung, it's dangerous.

371
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,390
Jung...

372
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,660
Jung, you all right?

373
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,390
- Jung.
- Jung.

374
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,820
Hello, Dad.

375
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:56,620
Hwalyong, you go inside with your father.

376
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,620
Yes, Master.

377
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,390
Here we go.

378
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:07,360
Did you hear me when I said
we have an important visitor today?

379
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,190
Clean this up and go to your room.

380
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,390
Yessir.

381
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,990
The finest artisan as a teacher.

382
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,390
And a friend.

383
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,990
I'm a happy man.

384
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:30,290
Yes, Father. I'm lucky
to be learning from him.

385
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,560
Still...

386
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,060
Still what?

387
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,620
Go on.

388
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,390
I wish I had a friend to compete with.

389
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:50,390
Isn't Jung your friend?

390
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:54,160
Jung is the best friend in the world.

391
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,390
But she's not what I would call...

392
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,390
...competition.

393
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,420
Hwalyong.

394
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,720
It's true.

395
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,520
Competition hones one's skill.

396
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:18,390
I had someone like that
in my early days as an artisan.

397
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,190
Who?

398
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,690
Yi Kangchon. Punwon's Master Artisan.

399
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,090
Hwalyong, get us a drink.

400
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,420
Sir.

401
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,390
'Yi Kangchon was a good friend.'

402
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,390
Is that what you think?

403
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:51,390
He defended me when no one else would.

404
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:55,090
I heard some strange things after you left.

405
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,920
Enough.

406
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,390
Is Prince Kwanghae doing well?

407
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:02,390
Look at you.

408
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:07,060
You don't care about anything else.

409
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,320
Just His Royal Highness.

410
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,090
I was freed in the amnesty
following his birth.

411
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:18,890
We've never met, but I owe him my life.

412
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:43,220
Your Highness! Your Highness!
Prince Kwanghae!

413
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,390
You wanted me?

414
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,390
I wanted a word before we start.

415
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,420
I'm listening.

416
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:01,160
I'm firstborn. No riding ahead of me.

417
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,390
Right. Of course.

418
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:09,390
And you can't
catch anything this time, understood?

419
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,390
Well?

420
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:15,620
Hunters usually hunt.

421
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:19,390
What? You dare disobey?

422
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,520
I'm here to hunt.

423
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,390
Not to show you up, don't worry.

424
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:27,790
See you remember that.

425
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,390
Wait.

426
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,390
For what?

427
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:56,390
That Father's deer.

428
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:00,390
You'll need different game
to show your stuff.

429
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,390
Which way then?

430
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:07,390
There. Lots of animals in the woods.

431
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,390
Animals?

432
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,660
You first.

433
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,390
No, you first.

434
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,520
Right.

435
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,790
Where you going?

436
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:33,020
Huh? Um... looking for clay.

437
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,620
That's strange.

438
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,290
And here Taedo is out hunting.

439
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:43,190
Oh? I had no idea.

440
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,390
I'll need to get back before dark.

441
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,760
Bye.

442
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:35,390
I said no hunting.
You should have waited.

443
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,290
Hurry up then.

444
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:40,120
It can't get far with an arrow in it.

445
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:45,390
You were thrown. No hunting for you.

446
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,090
Imhae!

447
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,220
Move out.

448
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,490
What the..?

449
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:24,020
Who put this here?

450
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,490
What did we catch?

451
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,490
Boar?

452
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:08,790
Elk? Deer?

453
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:13,390
The pit was my idea, so it's my catch.

454
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,890
You know that, right?

455
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:17,860
Your idea. But I did all the work.

456
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,390
Big talker.

457
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,460
What, and I just stood around?

458
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,390
I was...

459
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,190
You go on. I'll follow the deer.

460
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:51,290
Great. But I get what's in the pit.

461
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:52,920
No arguments.

462
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,960
Just in case. Take this.

463
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,320
Yes.

464
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,600
Wait, did we catch a huge animal?

465
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,390
Not a tiger perhaps?

466
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,390
Owie...! I swear!

467
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:38,390
You just going to stand there?

468
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,390
Give me a hand.

469
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:43,320
I didn't catch nothin'.

470
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,400
What? Nothing?

471
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,290
You dug this pit?

472
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:53,290
Yep. It's mine.

473
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:56,390
You didn't even ask permission.

474
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:59,390
You'll be sorry when I get out.

475
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:02,390
Pssh. Good luck with that.

476
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,390
Wait.

477
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,920
Hang on, give me a hand.

478
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,390
Get back here!

479
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:28,120
Why would I help you
if you'll make me sorry?

480
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,390
You know who I am?

481
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:34,390
I could have your whole family
put to death.

482
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:37,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:39,960
Better save your energy. Good luck.

484
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,390
Owie, a snake bit me.

485
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:49,060
Get me out before the poison spreads.

486
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,390
Really?

487
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,390
Uh-huh. Look.

488
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,390
It's so painful...

489
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,390
...hurts so much...

490
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,520
- Ow.
- Ow.

491
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:21,760
I swear, what will we do now?

492
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,160
How will we get out?

493
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,390
Kneel down.

494
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:26,390
Huh?

495
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:27,890
Kneel.

496
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,390
YOU kneel.

497
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:32,390
I'll climb out and toss you a rope.

498
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:34,390
Like I would trust you?

499
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:37,460
I'll get the soldiers to help. Kneel.

500
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:44,920
Soldiers, huh?
The poison must be kicking in.

501
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,490
Which hand was it? We have to treat it.

502
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,390
You lied?

503
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:59,390
You lied about being bit?

504
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:00,390
No.

505
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:03,390
Here.

506
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:12,360
Ow... Ouch!

507
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,120
Wait, what's this?

508
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,390
It's spreading to your shoulder.

509
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:18,460
Huh?

510
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:24,690
We'll have to amputate.

511
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:27,990
That some kind of joke?

512
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:29,390
A joke?

513
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:32,390
Poison spreading when I
wasn't even bit...

514
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:39,690
Lying liar. Too dense
to stay out of an animal pit.

515
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:42,720
You know who I am?

516
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,390
You dare compare me to an animal?

517
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:47,390
I'm...

518
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,660
I am a prince.

519
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:00,390
A prince?

520
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:04,160
I am. Now hurry and bow.

521
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:10,390
Your Worship, forgive me,
Your High-n-Mightiness.

522
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:13,860
I didn't recognize Your Pomposity.

523
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,390
It's all right. You didn't know...

524
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:20,260
Like I was gonna do that.

525
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:23,390
It's even a waste
to speak formally to you.

526
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:24,290
What?

527
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:27,020
A prince? Ri-i-ight.

528
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,920
Does that ever work?

529
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,860
Aren't you scared you'll get caught?

530
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,390
- Silence.
- Shut it!

531
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:39,390
Now listen up.
My brother will be here soon.

532
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:44,390
Keep lying
and I'll tell him to leave you here.

533
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:45,890
So watch it.

534
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:49,390
Oh, you're asking for it now.

535
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,390
Just you wait.

536
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:56,390
Scary. Good thing I don't scare easy.

537
00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:02,090
Taedo, hurry! There's a creep in here.

538
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:05,390
Taedo! Hurry!

539
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,220
Halt.

540
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,420
That's my boar. Stand aside.

541
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,660
That's my arrow, for sure.

542
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,960
Peasant. There's one in its flank.

543
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,390
It wounded it.

544
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:27,390
But mine was the killing shot.

545
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:29,390
It's my boar.

546
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:31,390
How dare you!

547
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:37,420
Another thing. It's not your arrow.

548
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:42,090
See? It's not the same color.

549
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:45,390
You there. Seize him!

550
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:47,390
Sir.

551
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:54,320
Let go. What did I do wrong?

552
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:09,820
So where is this brother of yours?

553
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:16,490
Is he coming?
Do you even have a bother?

554
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:18,820
He'll be here.

555
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:23,390
He was hunting big game, that's all.

556
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,390
No doubt.

557
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:29,390
I'll go find him. Kneel down.

558
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:33,390
How will you recognize him?

559
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:38,620
I should go. YOU should kneel.

560
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:42,390
I told you, I'm a prince...

561
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:48,190
I can't kneel.

562
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:51,320
Anyone can kneel.

563
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,390
You just hunker down
on your hands and knees.

564
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:55,660
See?

565
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,960
Creep-boy!

566
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,390
Creep...? Right. You caught me.

567
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:18,390
So you better help me out
before I try something.

568
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:21,390
I'll find this brother of yours.

569
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:24,360
You'll try to run away.

570
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,660
I'm reporting you
when we get out of here.

571
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,390
To the police?

572
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:32,390
Fine, dig your own grave.

573
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:35,390
You have yourself to blame.

574
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:39,390
Blame? Worry about yourself.

575
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:46,520
What's keeping Taedo?

576
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,390
Did something happen?

577
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,490
Cheater! You call that hunting?

578
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:14,720
Stealing like a stealing stealer?

579
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,820
What?

580
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,390
Say that again.

581
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:29,660
You didn't loose a single arrow,
you stole other's game.

582
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:32,760
What kind of hunting is that?

583
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,490
Not a single arrow?

584
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:38,260
You want to see me shoot?

585
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,390
Fine. I'll show you.

586
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,390
What's this?

587
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,660
Who is he?

588
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,260
Where's your brother?

589
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:35,260
He's... er, um...

590
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,390
- Bring him.
- Sire.

591
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:49,390
On your knees before His Majesty.

592
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,220
You little...!

593
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:58,390
I was looking for Kwanghae.

594
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:02,390
This guy was trying to take game
with Kwanghae's arrow in it.

595
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:03,590
Kwanghae's arrow?

596
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:05,390
Yes, Sire.

597
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:10,860
I suspect he may have hurt Kwanghae.

598
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,390
I was questioning him.

599
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:14,490
Is that so?

600
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:20,220
No. I don't know him, never met him.

601
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,560
- I shot a boar...
- Sire.

602
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:26,720
Let me question him, I'll find Kwanghae.

603
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,060
With your permission.

604
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:37,290
We're off.

605
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,390
Which of you is Taedo's father?

606
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:43,690
I am. Why?

607
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:45,390
Arrest him.

608
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:49,390
- Why?
- What is this?

609
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:51,520
Darling!

610
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:04,890
- Taedo!
- Father!

611
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:06,860
Taedo.

612
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,620
Taedo...

613
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,460
Why did you have to take my dad?

614
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,160
I'm innocent, I tell you.

615
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:17,390
Shut up and wait for His Majesty.

616
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:19,390
His... Majesty?

617
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:23,760
What's happened to us?

618
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,390
Did Jung get away?

619
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:30,320
Hey, call His Highness.

620
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,390
We checked the inn.

621
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:39,120
No sign of Prince Kwanghae.

622
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,760
You call that a report?

623
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,020
Find him or your life is forfeit.

624
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:47,260
S-Sire.

625
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:49,320
Your Majesty.

626
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,390
This peasant can lead us to him.

627
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,390
You said you didn't know him.

628
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:01,390
I don't. But I know this mountain.

629
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:05,390
If I can find him before dark,
release us both.

630
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:11,890
Fine. And if you don't,
you'll be punished accordingly.

631
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:29,390
Taedo can do it.

632
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:31,820
Why can't I?

633
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:34,290
I'm freezing.

634
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:36,460
That's why I'm building a fire.

635
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,390
Summer or not, it gets cold here.

636
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,020
Well hurry it up.

637
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:45,390
You do it then.

638
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:10,490
What the...?

639
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:12,560
You want to freeze to death?

640
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:17,560
Taedo saved my life this way once
when we got lost.

641
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:22,390
But you're a girl and I'm a boy and...

642
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:26,390
You're worried about saving face?

643
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:30,090
Better alive and stinky than dead.

644
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:33,260
Hold still if you don't want to freeze.

645
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:51,390
What are you doing?

646
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,860
What you told me.

647
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,390
Oh.

648
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:32,390
Got to stay warm after all.

649
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:35,820
Easy now.

650
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:40,390
What? I don't want to freeze.

651
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:52,390
Creep! What are you doing to me?

652
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:59,390
My heart's beating a mile a minute
and I'm standing still.

653
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,390
What are you grinning at?

654
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:11,390
Well? Answer me.

655
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:21,490
You're attracted to me.

656
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:25,560
Attracted?

657
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:29,960
To... you?

658
01:01:49,820 --> 01:02:02,390
- Your Highness!
- Where are you?

659
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:04,390
Your Highness!

660
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:07,760
'Your Highness?'

661
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,290
They're here.

662
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:13,020
That sounds like my men.

663
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,820
Listen. They're coming.

664
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:21,760
Your Highness? You're...

665
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,390
You're really...

666
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:30,390
...a prince?

Suppose...

669
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:58,060
Suppose someone slapped the prince,
what would happen?

670
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:59,960
I'll have your head!

671
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,390
Did you find who you were looking for?

672
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:03,890
Wooden swords don't count.

673
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:04,990
We won't meet again.

674
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,220
Defend yourself.

675
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:08,390
I'm scared of what I'll lose
if we meet again.

676
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:10,460
Kwanghae, I'm placing you
over the Punwon Kiln.

677
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,590
Yes, Sire.

678
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:14,460
