1
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,197
I bet you ten bucks the steps of
that train don't stop no more than...

2
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,028
_ ...one foot from that line.
_ Show a little respect.

3
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,279
_ Five bucks!
_ Cut it out. We're here for a funeral.

4
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,120
_ Which way is town?
_ Just follow the road. You can't miss it.

5
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,193
You... you know him?

6
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:11,636
No, but I know that type.
And I don't like it.

7
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:15,276
What do you suppose
he's doing here?

8
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,993
We'll find out soon enough.

9
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,433
Excuse me.

10
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,631
_ lsn't there anybody else getting off?
_ No, sir.

11
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:35,951
I guess he ain't coming.
May as well go on with the funeral.

12
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,719
Oh, that's a good way of putting it.

13
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,637
You could've won yourselves
five bucks apiece.

14
00:04:43,838 --> 00:04:49,390
Did anybody else get off that train
besides yourself?

15
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:51,076
Nope.

16
00:04:51,277 --> 00:04:56,306
_ You know a man name of John Elder?
_ I know of him.

17
00:04:56,518 --> 00:04:59,077
Would you be afraid of him?

18
00:04:59,277 --> 00:05:02,314
No. But you must be.

19
00:05:03,557 --> 00:05:08,473
That's why people hire me. They're
worried about somebody, or scared.

20
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,108
Don't go jumping to any conclusions.

21
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:16,833
I didn't know that John Elder
was even in these parts.

22
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:18,994
He probably isn't.

23
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:22,872
Maybe all you'll have to do to earn
your money is hang around for a while

24
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:25,466
and then go back on another train.

25
00:05:25,677 --> 00:05:31,674
Look, I don't care what I have to do,
as long as I get paid.

26
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:33,629
You'll get paid.

27
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:36,867
Stow your gear in the house.

28
00:05:50,157 --> 00:05:52,625
What are you hiring a gunman for, Pa?

29
00:05:52,837 --> 00:05:55,909
You're too young
to remember John Elder.

30
00:05:56,117 --> 00:05:59,870
_ What've the Elders got to do with us?
_ Not the Elders, just John.

31
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:02,909
What does he have to do with us?

32
00:06:03,116 --> 00:06:07,348
When he left here,
this ranch belonged to his family.

33
00:06:07,556 --> 00:06:11,231
_ This is our land. We own it, don't we?
_ Of course it is, son.

34
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:16,227
Sure it is. It's just that he might
want to figure it differently.

35
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,591
And we need this land.

36
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,752
We're gonna keep it.

37
00:07:16,594 --> 00:07:20,304
That's a peculiar way
to dress for a funeral.

38
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:22,905
Could turn out more than a funeral.

39
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:26,473
I don't get your point,
as John Elder didn't get off the train.

40
00:07:26,677 --> 00:07:28,951
That doesn't mean he won't show up.

41
00:07:29,155 --> 00:07:33,946
Even so, a man isn't likely to shoot up
his own mother's funeral.

42
00:07:34,156 --> 00:07:38,114
_ Not without good reason.
_ He might think he's got a good reason.

43
00:07:38,315 --> 00:07:40,988
Besides, there's that other one
that got off the train.

44
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:58,791
Ben, John Elder isn't wanted for
anything around here. Remember that.

45
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:03,192
He's a gunfighter. That puts him
on one side and me on the other.

46
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:07,183
And it was you
who told me that in the first place.

47
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:17,982
Almighty God, we commend the soul

48
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:23,188
of our dear and pretty sister departed,
Katie Elder, into your care,

49
00:08:23,394 --> 00:08:27,831
as we commit her body to the ground
beside her loved husband.

50
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:31,994
Katie Elder, a woman beloved of all.

51
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:36,347
A hard_working, honest woman.

52
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:40,514
She helped in your work,
O Lord, in a thousand ways.

53
00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:44,866
She was a friend to all,
a comforter to the sick.

54
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:48,828
She has left this world a little better
for having lived in it.

55
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:51,707
Those who knew her and loved her

56
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:56,511
are better for having lived
in the warmth of her understanding.

57
00:08:56,715 --> 00:09:00,389
Katie Elder lived here in Clearwater
for many years.

58
00:09:00,594 --> 00:09:03,313
All of us gathered here today
knew her well.

59
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:09,952
She raised four sons, John, Tom,
Matt and Bud, the youngest.

60
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:13,031
She was a woman
who wanted nothing for herself,

61
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:16,704
wanted only to give
rather than to receive.

62
00:09:16,914 --> 00:09:21,669
She devoted her life
to helping her family, her friends.

63
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:28,027
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

64
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:33,750
In the sure and certain belief
in resurrection unto the eternal life.

65
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:37,833
O God, whose mercies
cannot be numbered,

66
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:41,505
answer our prayers
on behalf of thy servant's soul...

67
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:46,548
...and grant her an entrance
into the land of light and joy...

68
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:52,304
...in the fellowship of thy saints. Amen.

69
00:09:52,514 --> 00:09:54,185
Amen.

70
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:16,312
You know,
she sold me a blind horse once.

71
00:10:16,513 --> 00:10:19,822
A woman doing that to me.

72
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:22,945
She really suckered me good.

73
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:30,268
This is Katie.
She was named after your mother.

74
00:10:31,872 --> 00:10:34,466
She's a handsome baby.

75
00:10:34,672 --> 00:10:37,585
I just thought you would like to know it.

76
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:48,106
_ One of you missing, ain't there?
_ Yes, sir. John, the oldest.

77
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:50,953
He moves around a lot.

78
00:10:51,154 --> 00:10:55,270
_ lf there's anything I can do...
_ Thank you, Parson, you done plenty.

79
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:58,192
Done what? Wrote a few letters?

80
00:10:58,393 --> 00:11:01,304
No, sir, that was
a real nice sermon you gave.

81
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:07,030
She belonged to have pretty words
spoke over her, and I didn't do it.

82
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:10,430
I thought you spoke good,
Parson, real good.

83
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:13,591
Not good enough, not for her.

84
00:11:14,672 --> 00:11:17,345
I don't suppose you'd know that.

85
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:25,465
_ Billy.
_ Hello, John.

86
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:31,023
You ought to have better sense
than that, coming up behind a man.

87
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:35,985
You're as fast as you used to be,
maybe faster.

88
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,026
_ Been getting lots of practice?
_ Still haven't got a newspaper here?

89
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:45,668
No, but we do have a gossip
about every twenty feet.

90
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:50,819
Why did you come into town the back
way, John? You figuring on trouble?

91
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:56,706
There's always somebody looking
for some. Clearwater's no different.

92
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,346
But that's one thing
I don't want, Billy... trouble.

93
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:07,902
_ How long you planning to stay?
_ I don't know. I just got here.

94
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:12,228
People usually let you take your hat off
'fore they ask you to leave.

95
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:17,550
I'm not asking you to leave. I'm just
asking how long you figure to stay.

96
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,787
Is there any reason
why I shouldn't stay?

97
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,346
Yes, as a matter of fact,
there's a couple of reasons.

98
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:30,547
For one, this ain't your home any more.
You gave that up some years ago.

99
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,182
Go on.

100
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:37,178
And two,
another man came to town today.

101
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,188
I understand he's real good with a gun.

102
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,348
_ Who is he?
_ I don't know. He's a stranger.

103
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:47,018
But I understand he hires out.

104
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,579
And three,
I've got myself a young deputy

105
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,021
who's real conscientious about his job.

106
00:13:57,309 --> 00:14:00,541
_ Am I wanted for anything, Billy?
_ No.

107
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,502
_ Then I got a good idea.
_ Yeah?

108
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:08,419
You send that young deputy over
to run that other fellow out of town.

109
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:12,509
I guess that'd be one way of doing it.

110
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,464
The only thing is,
he's not wanted for anything, either.

111
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:23,148
I come to town to see Ma buried,
and to maybe say hello to my brothers.

112
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,625
_ Any objections?
_ No.

113
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:31,141
_ Fine.
_ You want to see the boys, go that way.

114
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:35,184
_ You won't have to go through town.
_ The ranch is over there.

115
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:39,177
Not any more.
Morgan Hastings owns it now.

116
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:45,259
Kate was living in the Lupin place
when she died.

117
00:14:56,949 --> 00:15:01,784
_ When did that happen, Billy?
_ Your pa was killed six months ago.

118
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:06,345
_ Who did it?
_ I haven't been able to find out.

119
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:14,063
John...

120
00:15:15,188 --> 00:15:17,224
Don't do anything foolish.

121
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:23,148
You've been trying hard
not to tell me something. What is it?

122
00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:57,627
You know that man
that didn't get off the train?

123
00:15:57,828 --> 00:16:01,217
_ The one we're not scared of?
_ What about him?

124
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,784
_ He's back.
_ How do you know it's him?

125
00:16:04,988 --> 00:16:10,142
Big fellow, about six_four,
200 pounds, tough_looking.

126
00:16:10,348 --> 00:16:13,145
If there's any trouble,
make it look like self_defence.

127
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:18,217
Nobody told me about John Elder
until I got here.

128
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:20,941
And I ain't about to let him draw first.

129
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,344
You do nothing unless I tell you to.

130
00:16:24,547 --> 00:16:27,540
All right, you tell me.

131
00:16:27,748 --> 00:16:30,980
But I'll handle it my own way.

132
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:40,819
I knew it! The Elders are going to be
coming, asking how we got the place.

133
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:43,985
You stick to your bookkeeping.
I'll handle the Elders.

134
00:16:44,187 --> 00:16:47,384
_ It's not going to be easy.
_ Nothing comes easy.

135
00:16:47,587 --> 00:16:51,661
If you want to own a town,
you've got to put out something.

136
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:18,425
I was so little
when you and John left that...

137
00:17:18,627 --> 00:17:21,618
Is he really as fast with a gun
as everyone says?

138
00:17:21,826 --> 00:17:26,855
When he was a kid, he was the fastest.
I was afraid to be in the same room.

139
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:30,421
Let me point one thing out.
That work doesn't pay well.

140
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:35,098
_ I can recommend my line of work.
_ Yeah, larceny.

141
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:37,867
The hours are better,
and you get shot less.

142
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:42,696
_ Just the same, I wish he'd showed up.
_ Stop wishing. He's here.

143
00:18:00,307 --> 00:18:03,742
_ John.
_ Matt. Been a long time.

144
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:06,335
Time ain't made you any prettier.

145
00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:10,095
Tom. It hasn't helped you any, either.

146
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:13,537
_ Don't tell me this is the kid?
_ I'm almost eighteen!

147
00:18:13,746 --> 00:18:16,657
_ Bud started college this year.
_ How about that?

148
00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:21,098
When I went to school, anybody
got past four plus four is eight, I cried.

149
00:18:21,306 --> 00:18:23,262
Well, Ma want...

150
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:26,538
Ma said she wanted me to go.

151
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:28,497
Yeah.

152
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:36,024
You got here a little late.
We just got back from the funeral.

153
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:41,424
I was watching from a hill.
Katie wouldn't have wanted any trouble.

154
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,902
Never stopped you before.

155
00:18:45,106 --> 00:18:49,975
_ How did she die?
_ Doc lsdell said she wore herself out.

156
00:18:50,186 --> 00:18:54,702
She had a stroke and couldn't talk.
Then the preacher wrote to you.

157
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:57,545
I came to see her
about three years ago.

158
00:18:57,746 --> 00:19:00,623
A bit of money
to put into that hardware business.

159
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:02,781
At least I come back.

160
00:19:02,985 --> 00:19:06,694
It didn't matter too much to Katie.
I never was her favourite.

161
00:19:06,906 --> 00:19:13,060
It seems you two were the only ones
that saw Ma in the last few years.

162
00:19:13,264 --> 00:19:17,099
Like Matt says, I've been away, too.

163
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:20,183
Yeah, well.

164
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:29,496
_ ls it true what they say about you?
_ Only the bad things, Bud.

165
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:32,094
How many men have you killed?

166
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:36,377
You'd better ask Tom. He seems
to know more about me than I do.

167
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:40,338
Pretty smart, considering
we haven't met for ten years.

168
00:19:40,544 --> 00:19:43,378
I'm asking you. How many?

169
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:48,374
_ What did Katie tell you?
_ Not Mom, other people.

170
00:20:07,944 --> 00:20:10,856
_ Howdy, Miss Gordon.
_ Hello, Bud.

171
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:15,422
Miss Mary runs the boarding house.
These are my brothers...

172
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,901
Hello, Matt. Tom. Hello, John.

173
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:21,617
It's been a long time.

174
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:28,302
You're not that skinny little kid that used
to live next door to the Fergusons?

175
00:20:28,504 --> 00:20:33,338
No, I'm the skinny little kid
who lived next door to the Mastersons.

176
00:20:33,543 --> 00:20:37,583
I hate to break in on your grief,
but you'll need some food.

177
00:20:37,784 --> 00:20:42,574
Katie asked me to look in on you,
ifyou came to the funeral.

178
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:45,695
That's mighty nice of you, ma'am.

179
00:20:45,903 --> 00:20:51,773
I wasn't doing it for you, or any of you.
I'm doing it because Katie asked me to.

180
00:21:01,144 --> 00:21:02,976
She liked that rocker.

181
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:08,659
She seemed to have confided
a great deal in you, Miss Gordon.

182
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:11,059
If she'd had her sons around her

183
00:21:11,264 --> 00:21:14,097
she wouldn't
have had to confide in strangers.

184
00:21:14,304 --> 00:21:17,898
She told me what fine men you were,
never forgetting her,

185
00:21:18,103 --> 00:21:21,891
sending her money, helping her
send Bud through school.

186
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:24,174
She was so proud.

187
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:29,775
Her tall sons for whom she kept making
up lies so she could hide her shame.

188
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:32,656
Blamed Texas for taking her sons.

189
00:21:34,063 --> 00:21:37,022
Texas is a woman, she used to say,

190
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:40,100
a big, wild, beautiful woman.

191
00:21:40,622 --> 00:21:43,615
You raise a kid
to where he's got some size,

192
00:21:43,823 --> 00:21:47,133
and there's Texas
whispering in his ear and smiling,

193
00:21:47,343 --> 00:21:50,062
saying, "Come and have some fun."

194
00:21:50,263 --> 00:21:53,095
"It's hard enough to raise children,"
she'd say.

195
00:21:53,302 --> 00:21:57,535
"But when you've got to fight Texas,
a mother hasn't a chance."

196
00:21:57,743 --> 00:22:02,098
That's why she pushed Bud. She let
Texas beat her with the rest of you.

197
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:06,693
She was going
to see Bud through college or die.

198
00:22:06,902 --> 00:22:09,258
Well, she died.

199
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:14,332
Miss Gordon, tell me, why did
she set so much store by this rocker?

200
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:19,742
Your pa gave it to her. She wouldn't
have swapped it for a diamond ring.

201
00:22:20,663 --> 00:22:23,972
Thanks for being so nice to her.

202
00:22:24,182 --> 00:22:29,654
Nice to her? More like
she was nice to me, or anybody.

203
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:32,377
She deserved better from her own.

204
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:48,130
_ Miss Gordon...
_ I see you're still wearing your gun.

205
00:23:20,063 --> 00:23:22,053
Anybody hungry?

206
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:27,979
I'll bet you ten to one
she's a good cook, too.

207
00:23:30,662 --> 00:23:33,653
I'm glad I didn't bet. I'd have lost.

208
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:37,934
How did anybody in this family
ever get to college?

209
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:41,657
I didn't want to go to college.
It was either that or jail.

210
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:44,614
_ For what?
_ They said I stole a horse.

211
00:23:44,821 --> 00:23:48,575
People are trying to stick me
with things like that all the time.

212
00:23:48,781 --> 00:23:51,898
_ Did you steal it?
_ I rode him, but I didn't steal him.

213
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:57,493
Ma wouldn't back me up. There
wasn't anything else to do, so I went.

214
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,250
_ You went where?
_ To the School of Mines.

215
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:05,898
It was September 3rd.
It was a week before school started,

216
00:24:06,101 --> 00:24:08,534
and I clumb Pike's Peak.

217
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,776
_ Why?
_ It was there.

218
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,496
_ You done what to Pike's Peak?
_ I clumb it.

219
00:24:14,701 --> 00:24:18,851
_ You didn't, you climbed it.
_ What's the difference? I got to the top.

220
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:24,181
_ There ain't no such word as clumb.
_ What about the horse?

221
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:28,660
She went to a lot of bother to get you
an education. Why don't you use it?

222
00:24:28,862 --> 00:24:31,897
_ Why did you steal the horse?
_ I didn't.

223
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,617
I was in bed, and I heard someone
talking, so I looked out of the window.

224
00:24:36,821 --> 00:24:40,495
And old man Hyselman
was claiming I stole his horse.

225
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,214
A grey horse? What did Katie say?

226
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,413
She was as mad as he was,
told him to go look if he wanted to.

227
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:53,729
Then he came out of the barn with his
horse, Ma behind him hanging her head.

228
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,453
Then she come in all scared.

229
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,652
_ Ma scared?
_ I never saw her like that before.

230
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,376
She said he was coming back with
the sheriff, and I'd better leave the state.

231
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:08,290
So I took off my pants, put on a suit
and left on the morning train.

232
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,413
_ That ain't much of a story.
_ I liked it where he changed his pants.

233
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,773
_ It was just starting to get interesting.
_ Very funny, ha_ha!

234
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:21,374
Funny.

235
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:25,049
Bud, how long did Ma live here?

236
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,857
We moved over just after Pa died.

237
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:34,736
Twelve hundred acres of the best land
anywhere. I wonder why she sold.

238
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,967
_ A woman couldn't run it by herself.
_ She must have got some money.

239
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:42,899
Why don't we go to the bank,
split it four ways?

240
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,331
_ Three and a half is more like it.
_ Bud's got to have money for college.

241
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:50,258
I ain't going to college.
I'm going with him.

242
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:54,168
There's one thing you're forgetting.
You ain't been invited.

243
00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:57,258
I'd take you,
but I don't know where I'm going.

244
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,010
_ But I ain't going any place I've been.
_ I can take care of myself.

245
00:26:02,218 --> 00:26:07,339
What do you say we settle everything
else first and talk about him later?

246
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:11,932
We'd better see if she left any debts.

247
00:27:12,138 --> 00:27:14,413
Debts? What debts?

248
00:27:14,618 --> 00:27:17,611
Her funeral for one thing.
Who paid for that?

249
00:27:17,818 --> 00:27:21,207
_ She probably owes at the store, too.
_ That can't be much.

250
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:25,047
I'm going to Hyselman's.
You and Bud go to Peevey's store.

251
00:27:25,258 --> 00:27:29,137
Matt, you talk to Dr lsdell.
We'll meet at the bank.

252
00:27:48,658 --> 00:27:52,971
Howdy, Bud. You don't look any
different than when you went to college.

253
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:57,216
I expected him to come back
with a flat hat with a tassel,

254
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:59,852
wearing glasses and looking smart.

255
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:02,447
Mr Peevey, you remember
my brother Tom.

256
00:28:02,658 --> 00:28:05,774
Howdy, Tom.
I was sorry to hear about your ma.

257
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:11,974
I'll miss her as much as I'd miss my own
ma if she went. God spare me the day.

258
00:28:12,178 --> 00:28:15,329
_ We came about Ma's bill.
_ We'd like to settle up.

259
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:18,927
I think I have it inside. Come right in.

260
00:28:19,137 --> 00:28:22,288
Let me see now. Here it is.

261
00:28:22,497 --> 00:28:25,729
_ How much is that?
_ Six dollars and twenty cents.

262
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:29,053
I'll cut you for it.
High card, double or nothing.

263
00:28:35,057 --> 00:28:39,335
Hey, Ma? How much for the dresses
Katie Elder made?

264
00:28:39,537 --> 00:28:43,370
_ I thought you paid her.
_ No, I haven't paid for them yet.

265
00:28:43,576 --> 00:28:46,216
The Elder boys are here to settle up.

266
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:51,170
Four dresses at two fifty,
and two guitar lessons at fifty cents.

267
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:56,656
Four dresses at two fifty,
and two guitar lessons at fifty cents.

268
00:28:56,857 --> 00:29:03,126
That means that I owe you
four dollars and eighty cents.

269
00:29:03,337 --> 00:29:04,974
Your ma took guitar lessons?

270
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:10,171
Yeah, I figured she could earn a living
playing the guitar in the saloon.

271
00:29:10,377 --> 00:29:13,925
_ Want to hear her?
_ No, thank you. Some other time.

272
00:29:14,136 --> 00:29:17,208
Don't forget your money.

273
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:20,534
_ Thank you.
_ Drop in any time.

274
00:29:24,816 --> 00:29:29,606
I wish I could tell you that you owed
me a hundred dollars, but you don't.

275
00:29:29,816 --> 00:29:34,095
She came in here one day
with a big grey horse to sell.

276
00:29:34,296 --> 00:29:37,093
She said,
"Henry, go get your grey horse."

277
00:29:37,295 --> 00:29:40,732
They made as pretty a team
as you'd ever see.

278
00:29:40,936 --> 00:29:45,726
So I said, "What's your price, Katie?"
She said, "One funeral."

279
00:29:45,936 --> 00:29:48,894
And I said, "Whose?"

280
00:29:49,096 --> 00:29:51,928
She said, "Mine."
That's the way it was.

281
00:29:52,135 --> 00:29:54,855
Is that the same grey horse
that Bud stole?

282
00:29:56,216 --> 00:30:01,494
You heard about that? We rigged that
up to scare Bud into going to college.

283
00:30:01,695 --> 00:30:06,133
I put that horse in her barn,
and I come back later, yelling,

284
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,932
her screaming back at me
like she meant it.

285
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:12,933
She was a wise one, your ma.

286
00:30:13,135 --> 00:30:15,491
And my dad,

287
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:19,405
you buried him, too, didn't you, Henry?

288
00:30:20,615 --> 00:30:26,531
Yeah, high_spirited he was. And he
wasn't a man to back down to anyone.

289
00:30:26,735 --> 00:30:30,126
I remember when he was challenged
by old Thad to a duel.

290
00:30:30,336 --> 00:30:32,849
Your daddy
had the choice of weapons,

291
00:30:33,055 --> 00:30:38,209
and it being the Fourth of July, says
Bass, "I choose Roman candles."

292
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:43,924
Well, sir,
they stepped off the ten paces,

293
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:46,967
Iit the Roman candles,
then they started popping.

294
00:30:47,174 --> 00:30:53,045
Thad dark as thunder, Bass laughing,
those balls of fire bouncing off him,

295
00:30:53,255 --> 00:30:56,611
him laughing so hard
he was missing Thad by six feet.

296
00:30:56,815 --> 00:31:01,092
Finally, one of those balls of fire
landed in your daddy's pants.

297
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:06,163
He grabbed his bottom, ran for
the watering trough, sat down in it.

298
00:31:09,894 --> 00:31:12,568
It was the funniest duel I ever saw!

299
00:31:12,775 --> 00:31:15,289
I declare it was.

300
00:31:15,495 --> 00:31:18,248
How did he die, Henry?

301
00:31:22,494 --> 00:31:25,931
From what I could see,
he was shot in the back.

302
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:28,568
Did anybody try to find out who did it?

303
00:31:30,334 --> 00:31:35,362
I don't know about those things.
You'd better ask Billy, or Ben Latta.

304
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:40,133
All right, Henry.

305
00:31:53,173 --> 00:31:57,053
I figured he'd go to the bank
and the store.

306
00:31:57,254 --> 00:32:00,132
But what was he doing
at Hyselman's so long?

307
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:06,647
_ Do you want me to ask him?
_ It wouldn't hurt to ask. But just talk.

308
00:32:47,814 --> 00:32:51,806
_ Mr Venner.
_ Come in.

309
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:54,846
Looks like you were expecting us.

310
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:57,567
I thought you might stop by.

311
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:07,406
Yes, sir, we came over
to settle the estate.

312
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:10,002
Nothing left to settle.

313
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:14,685
_ Nothing?
_ She didn't leave a dollar.

314
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:17,884
But she had money last year.
She paid for my schooling.

315
00:33:19,173 --> 00:33:22,562
She must have gotten something
out of the old place.

316
00:33:22,772 --> 00:33:26,731
_ ls that what she told you?
_ I just took it for granted.

317
00:33:26,932 --> 00:33:31,688
_ Where did she get her money?
_ It's a fine time to start worrying.

318
00:33:31,893 --> 00:33:35,886
I watched her struggle for years,
giving guitar lessons for coffee,

319
00:33:36,093 --> 00:33:38,890
sewing that paid for your clothes, Bud.

320
00:33:39,093 --> 00:33:42,563
Never a word out of her,
except to praise you.

321
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:47,926
Have you looked into her closet,
at her clothes?

322
00:33:48,132 --> 00:33:53,810
You'd find one blue dress for winter
and one grey dress for summer.

323
00:33:54,013 --> 00:33:58,085
_ What about the Lupin place?
_ She didn't own the Lupin place.

324
00:33:58,292 --> 00:34:02,922
The bank let her have it
for a roof over her head.

325
00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:05,327
She paid rent.

326
00:34:05,532 --> 00:34:10,605
Katie wouldn't take anything off anybody,
not with her sons sending her money.

327
00:34:11,891 --> 00:34:16,682
If you plan to stay on here,
you'll find that Clearwater's changed.

328
00:34:16,892 --> 00:34:19,690
Big business coming in.

329
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:22,689
We don't want any bad reputations
around here.

330
00:34:23,691 --> 00:34:25,443
Good day, gentlemen.

331
00:34:25,651 --> 00:34:29,690
Mr Venner, what did she do
with the money from the ranch?

332
00:34:29,891 --> 00:34:33,930
_ I know she wouldn't just give it away.
_ I wouldn't know about that.

333
00:34:34,131 --> 00:34:36,691
_ Do you keep records?
_ We had a fire.

334
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:42,490
I can't remember every transaction.
Good day.

335
00:34:55,891 --> 00:34:58,769
Every transaction, or just this one?

336
00:35:14,051 --> 00:35:16,007
Well...

337
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:26,843
I'd be obliged
if you'd use the front entrance.

338
00:35:27,051 --> 00:35:29,963
Your time will come
to be carried out the other way.

339
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:38,799
_ What was John Elder doing in here?
_ Talking.

340
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:44,444
_ I don't see it's any of your affair.
_ I'm making it my affair.

341
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,324
_ Who are you?
_ Mr Hastings wants to know.

342
00:35:47,531 --> 00:35:52,923
_ He sent me to find out.
_ I don't care who wants to know.

343
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,919
Oh, yes, I can see where
Mr Hastings might be worried

344
00:35:57,131 --> 00:36:00,327
about what I might
be talking about with Johnny Elder.

345
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:04,239
_ So you tell me, huh?
_ No, I won't. You get out of here.

346
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,284
Hey!

347
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:36,044
_ You all right?
_ Yeah.

348
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,525
_ Who is he?
_ I've never seen him before.

349
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:45,768
I think he works for Morgan Hastings.
He asked what we were talking about.

350
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:48,038
Morgan Hastings?

351
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,798
He moved in and seems bent on
taking over the county.

352
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,001
He owns your ma's old place now.

353
00:36:54,210 --> 00:37:00,399
I came back to ask if you'd see after
Mom's grave, when you have a chance.

354
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,920
I'd be obliged
if you'd keep your money, John.

355
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:10,568
_ Looking after Katie'd be a privilege.
_ Thanks, Henry. Thank you.

356
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:26,998
Take you that long
to give him a couple of bucks?

357
00:37:27,209 --> 00:37:30,440
_ Let's go take a look at the old place.
_ What for?

358
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:33,116
Let's say I'm homesick.

359
00:38:11,729 --> 00:38:14,118
Everything sure has changed.

360
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:17,081
Remember how we'd
fool around in that barn?

361
00:38:17,288 --> 00:38:20,360
I was a kid when you fell
and broke your leg.

362
00:38:20,568 --> 00:38:23,799
You weren't even born.
Besides, I was pushed.

363
00:38:24,008 --> 00:38:28,605
_ Somebody kept pushing me off.
_ That's 'cause you bounced so good.

364
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:34,678
All the family bragged about how good
you bounced. Let's bounce on down.

365
00:39:22,168 --> 00:39:24,965
_ Howdy.
_ This here is private property.

366
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:29,080
_ We're looking for Morgan Hastings.
_ That's my father.

367
00:39:29,287 --> 00:39:31,881
But he won't be back all day.

368
00:39:32,087 --> 00:39:34,761
Then maybe you could help us.

369
00:39:34,968 --> 00:39:39,757
You see, this place used to be ours,
and now it's yours.

370
00:39:39,966 --> 00:39:43,596
_ We'd like to ask you some questions.
_ I'm not going to answer.

371
00:39:43,807 --> 00:39:49,006
_ You'd better get off this property.
_ Wait a minute. Don't get all riled.

372
00:39:49,207 --> 00:39:51,515
I'm ordering you. Get off this property!

373
00:39:51,726 --> 00:39:54,321
_ Having trouble, Dave?
_ Yeah.

374
00:39:54,527 --> 00:39:58,156
No trouble. I'm John Elder,
and these are my brothers...

375
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:03,235
_ I told them to leave, and they won't go.
_ That's not strictly true.

376
00:40:03,446 --> 00:40:06,563
I'm not putting up
with more trouble from you.

377
00:40:06,766 --> 00:40:12,044
He worked a fellow over in town, and
now he won't leave this man's property.

378
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:15,238
Either you're leaving peaceful,
or I'll arrest you.

379
00:40:16,366 --> 00:40:19,837
We wouldn't take too kindly
to being arrested.

380
00:40:20,047 --> 00:40:23,517
That ain't going to
make much difference.

381
00:40:31,647 --> 00:40:36,436
_ See? Now we ain't arrested.
_ You're going to be in serious trouble.

382
00:40:36,646 --> 00:40:39,922
We're going in with you,
straighten this out,

383
00:40:40,126 --> 00:40:43,039
but we ain't going in looking guilty.

384
00:40:43,247 --> 00:40:45,522
Get on your horse.

385
00:40:45,727 --> 00:40:48,000
We'll be back.

386
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:04,964
Billy. Billy! You got to see this.

387
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:07,475
Come on, come on!

388
00:41:48,045 --> 00:41:50,435
_ What happened, Ben?
_ He got careless.

389
00:41:50,646 --> 00:41:53,080
They jumped me
at the Hastings' place.

390
00:41:53,286 --> 00:41:58,075
That's why we came in, to straighten
this out. He had no right arresting us.

391
00:41:58,285 --> 00:42:02,517
_ He's wearing a badge.
_ We were just looking for answers.

392
00:42:02,725 --> 00:42:08,674
Next time, it might be an idea to wait
till I tell you to light out after somebody.

393
00:42:08,884 --> 00:42:11,843
All right, you Elders, take off.

394
00:42:12,045 --> 00:42:15,924
_ Go on. I'm going to talk to Billy.
_ I'm going with you.

395
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,442
Billy.

396
00:42:25,845 --> 00:42:31,362
Since I got home someone's asking me
to leave or pulling a gun on me.

397
00:42:31,564 --> 00:42:34,033
A gunfighter can't be treated like a hero.

398
00:42:34,245 --> 00:42:36,520
_ I'm no gunfighter!
_ You're his brother.

399
00:42:36,725 --> 00:42:40,081
I know how to handle unfriendly towns.

400
00:42:40,285 --> 00:42:44,801
At Katie's grave you said
the last thing you wanted was trouble.

401
00:42:45,005 --> 00:42:49,714
_ You drive me out, I'll be back.
_ That goes for me, too.

402
00:42:49,924 --> 00:42:54,202
Why didn't you tell us
that Bass was shot in the back?

403
00:42:54,404 --> 00:42:58,398
Does it make any difference
which direction the bullet came from?

404
00:42:58,605 --> 00:43:01,995
Yes, if you're trying to find out
if he was murdered.

405
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:07,403
_ What do you want to know?
_ What happened to our old place?

406
00:43:07,604 --> 00:43:11,518
_ lf Pa sold it, there'd be money.
_ Not if he gambled it away.

407
00:43:11,725 --> 00:43:14,715
_ ls that what happened?
_ Hastings says so.

408
00:43:14,923 --> 00:43:19,440
I see no reason to doubt him.
He had six witnesses.

409
00:43:21,204 --> 00:43:23,798
Your pa must have been pretty drunk.

410
00:43:24,004 --> 00:43:28,793
He was going to be a better provider
for Katie, win a fortune for her.

411
00:43:29,003 --> 00:43:32,553
_ I don't know how she put up with him.
_ She loved him.

412
00:43:32,764 --> 00:43:37,313
_ That was good enough for her.
_ We all loved him, Billy.

413
00:43:37,522 --> 00:43:41,596
It was just that when he got
to gambling and hitting that bottle...

414
00:43:41,803 --> 00:43:46,276
_ How long after the game was he shot?
_ Same night.

415
00:43:46,485 --> 00:43:49,839
Wouldn't you say
that was a little coincidental?

416
00:43:50,043 --> 00:43:53,593
Even if I did, I couldn't prove it.

417
00:43:53,804 --> 00:43:56,193
_ We can help.
_ I don't need any help.

418
00:43:56,404 --> 00:43:59,759
Isn't it a little late
to be wondering what happened?

419
00:43:59,963 --> 00:44:04,991
_ Who shot him, Billy?
_ John, stop digging around.

420
00:44:05,203 --> 00:44:07,957
All it'll get you is trouble.

421
00:44:10,204 --> 00:44:11,955
Trouble.

422
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:15,041
Hastings.

423
00:44:29,563 --> 00:44:34,956
Miss Gordon, I want to talk to you
about Katie's things.

424
00:44:35,162 --> 00:44:38,074
She didn't have much,
but we'd be pleased,

425
00:44:38,282 --> 00:44:42,719
and I'm sure she'd want you
to have anything of hers that you liked,

426
00:44:42,922 --> 00:44:46,834
Iike maybe the rocking chair,
and things like that.

427
00:44:47,042 --> 00:44:51,753
Why, thank you, John.
I'd like that very much.

428
00:44:52,563 --> 00:44:56,272
Fine. I'll bring them by.

429
00:45:01,603 --> 00:45:04,720
I can't stand a man
that forces himself on a girl

430
00:45:04,923 --> 00:45:07,641
who wouldn't be caught dead with him.

431
00:45:13,162 --> 00:45:16,360
They're sure a fine pair, Mr Hastings.

432
00:45:16,563 --> 00:45:18,633
The finest.

433
00:45:21,562 --> 00:45:24,315
_ Southern hospitality, huh?
_ Sorry, gentlemen.

434
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:30,869
No offence, I was feeling the balance.
Finest duelling pistols ever made.

435
00:45:31,081 --> 00:45:34,118
_ You're two of the Elder boys?
_ That's right.

436
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:39,112
I'm sorry about your mother.
She was a wonderful woman.

437
00:45:39,322 --> 00:45:42,792
After your father lost the ranch
and passed on,

438
00:45:43,002 --> 00:45:46,835
I offered to pay her for the ranch,
but she wouldn't hear of it.

439
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:51,751
_ Well, now, why would you do that?
_ Guilt, Mr Elder.

440
00:45:51,961 --> 00:45:56,273
Yes, guilt. I wanted the ranch.
Yes, I needed it.

441
00:45:56,481 --> 00:45:59,280
This town can grow
and become important.

442
00:45:59,482 --> 00:46:03,715
It needs water power for a mill.
The ranch had the water power.

443
00:46:04,682 --> 00:46:08,435
I intended to buy it,
not win it in a card game.

444
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:14,591
No offence meant, could we see
the paper that transferred the ranch?

445
00:46:14,801 --> 00:46:19,238
Certainly, of course.
You have every right to.

446
00:46:19,441 --> 00:46:21,033
It's right here.

447
00:46:30,441 --> 00:46:32,636
Yes, here it is.

448
00:46:32,841 --> 00:46:36,073
That's where
your father made his mark.

449
00:46:36,281 --> 00:46:39,477
And the signatures
of the other witnesses.

450
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,870
_ You one of these witnesses?
_ Of course.

451
00:46:45,081 --> 00:46:48,790
_ The rest of these work for you?
_ Occasionally.

452
00:46:49,001 --> 00:46:52,436
What was the game
you were playing that night?

453
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,600
_ The game? Blackjack.
_ Blackjack?

454
00:46:56,801 --> 00:46:59,917
_ Are you sure it was blackjack?
_ Of course.

455
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:04,272
Pa always told us he wouldn't
be caught dead playing blackjack.

456
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,555
Shoot his kids if he saw them playing it.
Thought it was a woman's game.

457
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:13,197
Mr Hastings,
you know all the people in this town.

458
00:47:13,401 --> 00:47:17,553
Who do you think was the dirty,
stinking rat that killed our pa?

459
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:19,752
Why ask me?

460
00:47:19,961 --> 00:47:22,394
We aim to find out.

461
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,831
We started playing blackjack with Pa
when we were three or four.

462
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:36,271
We know that, but Hastings doesn't.

463
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,790
Hey, Bud.

464
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:47,318
"Katie Duane, born Ohio." No date.

465
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:52,469
"Married Bass Elder,
September 8th, 1850,"

466
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,112
"Clearwater, Texas."

467
00:48:56,078 --> 00:49:00,118
_ We'd better keep this.
_ Why? Let's raffle it off.

468
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:03,072
We'll give half the money
to the parson.

469
00:49:03,279 --> 00:49:07,397
I think we ought
to get her a nice stone for her grave.

470
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,237
A big stone with nice writing on it.

471
00:49:10,438 --> 00:49:13,431
_ What do you call it?
_ A monument. Do you think so, John?

472
00:49:13,639 --> 00:49:16,755
_ She'd like that.
_ Why buy a hunk of stone?

473
00:49:16,958 --> 00:49:20,917
Because there ought to be
something to remember her by.

474
00:49:21,118 --> 00:49:24,395
The Ridders got their mother
an angel with her finger pointing up.

475
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:27,114
_ At who?
_ Nobody!

476
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:31,277
_ All right, then, an angel.
_ Does it have to be an angel?

477
00:49:31,478 --> 00:49:34,277
Besides, some kid
shot the angel's finger off,

478
00:49:34,479 --> 00:49:37,198
and it looked like
she was shaking her fist.

479
00:49:37,399 --> 00:49:41,277
_ We'll get a marble lamb!
_ How about a horse?

480
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,868
_ A horse? For a grave?
_ Ma loved horses.

481
00:49:45,078 --> 00:49:50,028
How'd you like to have a marble horse
on top of you for the rest of eternity?

482
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:54,356
_ What's happened to all of us?
_ You said she'd like a monument.

483
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:59,916
Yeah, but not that kind. She wanted
one of us to amount to something.

484
00:50:00,118 --> 00:50:02,552
She sure drew a flat blank zero!

485
00:50:02,757 --> 00:50:08,151
Not if Bud goes back to school.
That's the kind of monument she wants.

486
00:50:08,358 --> 00:50:11,316
Why me? One of you
go amount to something!

487
00:50:11,518 --> 00:50:14,669
_ It's too late for us.
_ I won't be no monument.

488
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:18,790
I'm going with you. We'll be famous,
like the Dalton brothers.

489
00:50:18,997 --> 00:50:24,117
Yeah, they're famous, but they're just
a little bit dead. They were hung!

490
00:50:27,556 --> 00:50:30,674
We keep the book.

491
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:37,115
Horses!

492
00:51:28,596 --> 00:51:32,635
_ John.
_ Good evening. I brought the things.

493
00:51:32,836 --> 00:51:34,985
Come on in.

494
00:51:37,956 --> 00:51:40,425
_ This is a nice room.
_ Thank you.

495
00:51:40,637 --> 00:51:43,948
How about... right here?

496
00:51:44,158 --> 00:51:45,795
That's fine.

497
00:51:46,956 --> 00:51:49,676
This is very thoughtful of you, John.

498
00:51:49,877 --> 00:51:52,835
Whenever I look at it or sit in it,
I'll think of Katie.

499
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:56,636
I brought your things back, and...

500
00:51:56,836 --> 00:52:00,590
...also we thought
you should have this.

501
00:52:03,877 --> 00:52:06,710
But it's your family bible. You keep it.

502
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:10,625
No, a lot of the places that I go
it wouldn't fit in.

503
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:15,307
All right, I'll keep it. But it's yours
whenever you want it back.

504
00:52:23,035 --> 00:52:25,470
These are yours, too.

505
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:31,194
They weren't meant for an outsider,
but Katie wanted me to know about you.

506
00:52:31,396 --> 00:52:34,990
_ I don't mind.
_ You stopped writing so long ago.

507
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:38,825
She would read your old letters
as if they'd just come.

508
00:52:39,036 --> 00:52:41,310
Then she gave them to me to read.

509
00:52:41,515 --> 00:52:44,507
I don't know how
either of you could read them.

510
00:52:44,715 --> 00:52:51,236
_ My handwriting isn't a thing of beauty.
_ But what you wrote was, at first.

511
00:52:51,437 --> 00:52:56,225
Then I began to notice a change.
Your ma never did, but I did.

512
00:52:56,435 --> 00:53:00,224
_ Everybody changes.
_ Not the way you did.

513
00:53:00,436 --> 00:53:02,949
I began hearing things about you.

514
00:53:03,155 --> 00:53:06,784
It wasn't even the same man
who wrote those letters.

515
00:53:06,995 --> 00:53:09,145
You're going to look
for your father's killer?

516
00:53:09,355 --> 00:53:14,032
I sure am. Whoever killed him
probably stole the ranch from Katie.

517
00:53:14,236 --> 00:53:18,194
_ It's the least I can do for her.
_ Why? So you can even a score?

518
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:22,911
Kill again? Maybe do it in front of Bud
so he can be proud of you?

519
00:53:23,115 --> 00:53:25,993
Don't let Bud worship you
because you're a killer.

520
00:53:26,195 --> 00:53:30,984
Katie wanted Bud to go to college,
to make your name stand for something.

521
00:53:34,915 --> 00:53:37,304
I'll be leaving now.

522
00:53:38,795 --> 00:53:41,308
Thank you again for this.

523
00:53:44,834 --> 00:53:49,385
Why wouldn't Katie
want me to find Bass' killer?

524
00:53:49,594 --> 00:53:53,792
Because all that means is more killing.
And Katie hated killing.

525
00:54:12,594 --> 00:54:18,032
_ How much money you got on you?
_ Me? Where would I get any money?

526
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:22,945
_ You got five bucks from Peevey.
_ Spend my own money for a drink?

527
00:54:23,155 --> 00:54:27,306
Pa'd come out of his grave
like a scorched cat. Never do that, kid!

528
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:33,422
_ You just watch. Two whiskeys.
_ Yes, sir.

529
00:54:47,834 --> 00:54:50,267
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

530
00:54:51,313 --> 00:54:54,306
Well, down!

531
00:55:00,473 --> 00:55:03,351
_ Bartender!
_ Yes, sir.

532
00:55:04,714 --> 00:55:08,674
Hey, can a fellow
get a drink on credit around here?

533
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:10,307
Sorry.

534
00:55:12,273 --> 00:55:14,549
I'll get us another drink!

535
00:55:34,753 --> 00:55:38,462
Beauty! We'll get us a drink
'cause we're going to have a raffle.

536
00:55:38,673 --> 00:55:41,506
_ Raffle what?
_ My eye! My glass eye.

537
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,863
Who'll take a chance
on getting a made_to_order eye?

538
00:55:45,072 --> 00:55:48,304
If you want a drink that bad,
I'll buy you one.

539
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:53,792
But you wouldn't let a man buy you
a drink if you couldn't buy him one back.

540
00:55:53,993 --> 00:55:58,941
All right, sports! Fifty cents a chance,
just four bits to win a $22 eye.

541
00:55:59,152 --> 00:56:01,667
I always did want a third eye.

542
00:56:01,873 --> 00:56:06,422
_ Are you playing poker or kid games?
_ Kid games! I'm losing money.

543
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:11,667
_ I'm in.
_ You can look at it, but don't touch it...

544
00:56:11,873 --> 00:56:15,344
_ I'm in!
_ Oh, yeah! Lay that money down.

545
00:56:17,913 --> 00:56:20,107
_ That's nine.
_ I got seven.

546
00:56:20,312 --> 00:56:23,510
Well, that's nine dollars
and fifty cents.

547
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,227
I need one more
to make it ten bucks.

548
00:56:26,433 --> 00:56:30,220
_ There it is. I want that eye.
_ Well, all right!

549
00:56:31,192 --> 00:56:34,980
Let's see. We need nineteen
white chips and one blue one,

550
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:39,232
because whoever draws the blue chip
is going to be the winner of the eye.

551
00:56:39,433 --> 00:56:42,902
_ Shake them up. Who was the first in?
_ I was.

552
00:56:43,112 --> 00:56:48,140
You're entitled to the first draw. Dip in.
Who's going to be the winner of that...?

553
00:56:49,632 --> 00:56:52,668
_ Let's see who's going to win.
_ Get in there.

554
00:56:53,991 --> 00:56:58,270
This tall, good_looking gentleman,
see what you come out with.

555
00:57:01,432 --> 00:57:03,263
Seem to be all white chips.

556
00:57:03,472 --> 00:57:07,828
This gentleman took two chances.
You're entitled to two draws.

557
00:57:08,031 --> 00:57:11,263
Dip in and may
Lady Luck smile on you.

558
00:57:11,472 --> 00:57:13,382
He got it!

559
00:57:13,591 --> 00:57:17,709
_ I got it! Give me my eye.
_ It's over there.

560
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:27,347
I might just have it
made into a stickpin for Sunday.

561
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:31,306
_ How much would you take for her?
_ I'm going to keep her.

562
00:57:31,512 --> 00:57:34,868
_ I'll give you three dollars.
_ No, I'll keep her for good luck.

563
00:57:35,071 --> 00:57:38,780
There goes my wedding!
My girl saw me with my patch once.

564
00:57:38,991 --> 00:57:42,108
_ She turned away.
_ You look all right to me.

565
00:57:42,311 --> 00:57:47,386
Pretend you're a girl, and you can see
it spoils my manly beauty. Right, boys?

566
00:57:47,592 --> 00:57:51,470
_ Sell it back to him.
_ All right, all right, I'll sell her.

567
00:57:51,671 --> 00:57:55,380
_ Five dollars.
_ Split the difference, and I'll buy a drink.

568
00:57:55,591 --> 00:57:56,865
Done.

569
00:57:57,071 --> 00:58:02,463
Whiskey for the gentleman,
give me one, and one for the kid.

570
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:05,504
Aren't you going
to put it back in again?

571
00:58:05,711 --> 00:58:08,942
Put it back in?
It'd be a little crowded in there.

572
00:58:09,151 --> 00:58:11,745
Be a little crowded in there.

573
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:25,980
Maybe that's funny to you,
but not to me.

574
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:31,185
I say you're a liar and a cheat,
just like your old man.

575
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:40,267
_ You knew my old man?
_ Well enough. He was a drunk, too.

576
00:58:40,471 --> 00:58:42,302
_ Liar!
_ He's only a kid.

577
00:58:42,511 --> 00:58:47,140
Stay out of this! He thinks he can
ride along on his brother's reputation.

578
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:50,786
I don't think so much
of his brother, either.

579
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:53,505
_ He ain't armed!
_ But I am.

580
00:58:53,711 --> 00:58:55,941
_ Stay out of this, Bud.
_ No!

581
00:58:56,151 --> 00:58:59,540
I don't think he's got the nerve.

582
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:02,025
_ Give him a gun.
_ The boy didn't mean nothing.

583
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:05,621
He called me a liar.
All I did was tell the truth.

584
00:59:05,831 --> 00:59:08,946
You can take mine, kid.

585
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:20,229
Go on, pick it up.

586
00:59:21,949 --> 00:59:26,626
I say he comes from a no_good family
that don't have the nerve...

587
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:28,104
John.

588
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:31,664
This guy just called Pa
a liar and a drunk!

589
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:35,828
That invitation to pick up a gun
still hold for Johnny Elder?

590
00:59:36,029 --> 00:59:40,309
You got a chance to prove
you don't think so much of him.

591
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:44,428
Tom, get him out of here.

592
00:59:44,629 --> 00:59:47,019
_ Not till he eats his words!
_ Tom.

593
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:51,064
Didn't you hear me?
He called Pa a liar and a drunk.

594
00:59:54,909 --> 00:59:57,548
I reckon that's what he was, kid.

595
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,339
Now, keep him out.

596
01:00:24,949 --> 01:00:26,348
John...

597
01:00:27,509 --> 01:00:29,147
...get out.

598
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:37,618
Night, boys.

599
01:00:40,427 --> 01:00:42,100
Where you going, mister?

600
01:00:43,828 --> 01:00:45,228
Finish your game.

601
01:00:59,988 --> 01:01:03,025
_ Hey, Bud, ain't you going to eat?
_ No!

602
01:01:03,228 --> 01:01:07,107
How can I when I think of the things
that skunk said about us?

603
01:01:07,308 --> 01:01:11,746
And him, the big gun
everybody's always bragging about,

604
01:01:11,949 --> 01:01:15,497
he slunk lower
than anyone in the place.

605
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:17,699
_ Shut up.
_ I won't!

606
01:01:17,908 --> 01:01:20,661
Why didn't you let me
do something about it?

607
01:01:20,868 --> 01:01:23,587
He'd have chewed you up
and spit you out.

608
01:01:23,788 --> 01:01:26,699
Your hand wouldn't
have got halfway to that gun.

609
01:01:26,907 --> 01:01:31,299
Katie's going to have something
to show for her life.

610
01:01:31,508 --> 01:01:33,897
_ You're going back to school.
_ No, I ain't!

611
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:38,146
Oh, yes, you are,
if I have to carry you there.

612
01:01:38,347 --> 01:01:41,817
_ I won't learn anything!
_ I can't make you do that.

613
01:01:42,027 --> 01:01:46,861
You don't want to tag along with me
after I've muddied the Elders' name.

614
01:01:47,066 --> 01:01:49,627
No, and that's for sure!

615
01:01:51,907 --> 01:01:56,619
This was Ma's, now it's mine. I'm going
to get that guy. Who's coming?

616
01:01:56,829 --> 01:01:59,501
_ You're not going any place.
_ You going to stop me?

617
01:01:59,708 --> 01:02:01,937
You bet I am!

618
01:02:02,147 --> 01:02:04,537
And that's for sure!

619
01:02:16,788 --> 01:02:21,338
_ What the hell did you hit me for?
_ You stood there and let him hit me.

620
01:02:35,026 --> 01:02:36,858
I got him, I got him.

621
01:02:37,067 --> 01:02:38,898
I got him!

622
01:02:40,107 --> 01:02:42,223
_ You got him?
_ Yeah!

623
01:02:43,387 --> 01:02:45,616
Stay out of here.

624
01:03:02,347 --> 01:03:06,023
_ Howdy.
_ Howdy.

625
01:03:06,228 --> 01:03:08,979
I'm right sorry
I missed the start of that.

626
01:03:09,186 --> 01:03:14,022
_ Doing your spring house-cleaning?
_ We're just getting acquainted.

627
01:03:14,227 --> 01:03:16,899
We haven't seen each other
for some years.

628
01:03:17,106 --> 01:03:19,620
I'm looking for a Mrs Kate Elder.

629
01:03:19,826 --> 01:03:23,182
This is where she lived.
We're her sons.

630
01:03:23,386 --> 01:03:27,983
_ She died a few days ago.
_ I am sorry.

631
01:03:28,187 --> 01:03:31,063
_ I extend my sympathy to y'all.
_ Thank you.

632
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:36,021
I never had the pleasure of meeting
Mrs Elder, but I got a letter from her.

633
01:03:36,226 --> 01:03:40,741
Since I had business in Clearwater,
I decided to pay her a visit.

634
01:03:40,945 --> 01:03:44,654
I'm sorry I got here so late.
This is some letter!

635
01:03:44,865 --> 01:03:47,221
Care to read it?

636
01:03:48,066 --> 01:03:51,945
"Mr Charlie Bob Striker,
Pecos, Texas."

637
01:03:52,146 --> 01:03:54,056
_ That's you?
_ It is.

638
01:03:54,825 --> 01:03:59,058
This is Matt and Bud and Tom.
And I'm John Elder.

639
01:03:59,266 --> 01:04:00,904
Howdy.

640
01:04:02,265 --> 01:04:07,783
"Dear Mr Striker, it has been told to me
that you have a lot too many horses."

641
01:04:07,985 --> 01:04:10,659
"If this is true,
you have my sympathy,"

642
01:04:10,866 --> 01:04:14,654
"as I have been horse poor
myself in the past."

643
01:04:14,866 --> 01:04:18,175
"If you are still
in this predicament in June,"

644
01:04:18,385 --> 01:04:23,506
"I may be able to help you out and
take a hundred head off your hands,"

645
01:04:23,706 --> 01:04:27,903
"provided you are
prepared to deal on credit"

646
01:04:28,105 --> 01:04:30,699
"until I can resell them."

647
01:04:30,905 --> 01:04:35,422
"I am interested in good sound stock,
but nothing fancy."

648
01:04:35,626 --> 01:04:39,538
"And I would like to hear
your rock_bottom price."

649
01:04:39,745 --> 01:04:43,181
"Yours truly, Kate Elder."

650
01:04:43,385 --> 01:04:44,898
Horse poor?

651
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:49,934
Sounds like she had more brass
than the Kansas City fire engine.

652
01:04:50,144 --> 01:04:53,342
It struck me funny, and the more
I read it, the funnier it got.

653
01:04:53,545 --> 01:04:57,504
Finally I said to myself,
"Striker, you've done a lot of fool things."

654
01:04:57,705 --> 01:05:02,539
"You haven't done any lately, and you're
overdue." I'm sorry I got here too late.

655
01:05:02,744 --> 01:05:06,578
_ You two would've made a lively team.
_ Well, thanks!

656
01:05:06,785 --> 01:05:10,015
_ Why don't you come on in?
_ Thank you.

657
01:05:10,224 --> 01:05:13,056
But it'll be a favour to my bad knee
to stay here.

658
01:05:13,263 --> 01:05:17,736
_ It's been nice meeting you.
_ I've got a proposition for you.

659
01:05:17,945 --> 01:05:20,665
I wouldn't blame you
if you turned me down.

660
01:05:20,866 --> 01:05:24,175
_ It wouldn't hurt to hear it.
_ I'd like to take those horses.

661
01:05:24,385 --> 01:05:27,457
I'd run them to Colorado,
sell them to the miners.

662
01:05:27,665 --> 01:05:31,135
But I've got the same trouble
Mom had. No cash.

663
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:35,860
_ I'll give you half the profits.
_ What about the rest of you?

664
01:05:36,064 --> 01:05:39,136
_ You in this, too?
_ We ain't been asked.

665
01:05:39,344 --> 01:05:42,018
_ Are you telling or asking?
_ Asking.

666
01:05:42,225 --> 01:05:44,181
It sounds crazy enough to work.

667
01:05:44,385 --> 01:05:46,852
_ Matt?
_ I want to know one thing.

668
01:05:47,064 --> 01:05:51,103
_ Will the money keep him at school?
_ Seems to be the idea.

669
01:05:51,304 --> 01:05:54,661
In that case,
I'll chip in a couple of weeks.

670
01:05:56,224 --> 01:05:59,021
_ Well?
_ You know you almost broke my jaw.

671
01:05:59,223 --> 01:06:04,378
I was trying awful hard to. That's what
it seems to take with some people.

672
01:06:07,504 --> 01:06:11,132
_ Well, I guess you made up my mind.
_ How about it?

673
01:06:11,343 --> 01:06:15,940
If I was going to do a fool thing for your
mother, I might as well do it for you.

674
01:06:16,144 --> 01:06:19,215
Come to my ranch,
and you can have the horses.

675
01:06:19,422 --> 01:06:23,257
_ When do you want to start?
_ A couple of hours.

676
01:06:23,463 --> 01:06:26,058
Good, I'll be waiting.

677
01:06:31,464 --> 01:06:33,772
Well, come on!

678
01:06:53,463 --> 01:06:55,897
It's your move, Billy.

679
01:06:57,103 --> 01:07:02,018
Harry, one of these days
I'm going to beat you.

680
01:07:02,223 --> 01:07:04,373
I wish you would.

681
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:09,373
After losing eight games in a row,
I can hardly consider you a challenge.

682
01:07:12,943 --> 01:07:16,982
_ Where have you been all day?
_ The US Marshal's office.

683
01:07:18,422 --> 01:07:21,380
Take a look at this.

684
01:07:21,582 --> 01:07:25,258
Maybe that'll prove
I wasn't jumping to conclusions.

685
01:07:25,463 --> 01:07:28,294
Tom Elder's wanted for murder!

686
01:07:28,501 --> 01:07:30,891
_ What gave you the idea?
_ I did.

687
01:07:31,102 --> 01:07:34,493
He knew enough about Tom Elder
to send me looking.

688
01:07:34,703 --> 01:07:38,333
I figured Tom for a lot of things,
but never murder.

689
01:07:38,544 --> 01:07:40,659
Why not? He's an Elder.

690
01:07:40,862 --> 01:07:43,582
It takes more than a man's name
to make him guilty.

691
01:07:43,783 --> 01:07:48,458
_ There's your proof.
_ That doesn't prove he's guilty.

692
01:07:48,662 --> 01:07:52,541
You're working out of hate. That's
why they took your gun the first time.

693
01:07:52,742 --> 01:07:56,974
It seems like
I can't do anything right for you, Billy.

694
01:08:06,862 --> 01:08:12,061
Ben, the trouble with you
is you're like an owl.

695
01:08:12,262 --> 01:08:16,777
The more light you shine on him,
the less he sees.

696
01:08:16,981 --> 01:08:19,894
_ Where are you going?
_ To get Tom Elder.

697
01:08:20,102 --> 01:08:22,332
Not armed like that, you're not.

698
01:08:22,542 --> 01:08:26,659
And go reluctant, not like
you enjoy the idea of using that.

699
01:08:28,861 --> 01:08:33,219
_ I'll go myself.
_ They're four of them!

700
01:08:34,141 --> 01:08:36,608
I can count, too, Ben.

701
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:43,575
Ben's right, Billy. You'll need help.

702
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:49,214
You figuring on coming with me?

703
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:53,574
Or are you suggesting
I take along that new man you hired?

704
01:08:53,782 --> 01:08:56,534
He's a good hand.

705
01:08:56,741 --> 01:09:01,496
What are you trying to keep the Elders
from finding out, Mr Hastings?

706
01:09:01,701 --> 01:09:03,851
I'm just trying to help.

707
01:09:04,061 --> 01:09:09,261
Sure, just trying to put us on the map,
make us all rich.

708
01:09:09,462 --> 01:09:12,578
A man can grow with a town, Billy.

709
01:09:14,581 --> 01:09:18,369
Or die, like Bass Elder.

710
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:27,931
Ben, you'd better come here.

711
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:32,212
_ What's the matter?
_ Billy's horse just came in, without him.

712
01:10:43,419 --> 01:10:46,252
Let's get a posse together, Harry.

713
01:11:02,901 --> 01:11:04,174
Here.

714
01:11:13,459 --> 01:11:15,051
He's still breathing.

715
01:11:15,259 --> 01:11:19,855
You and Roy take him to Doc lsdell.
Meet us at the river.

716
01:12:12,819 --> 01:12:14,490
Go get 'em!

717
01:13:28,138 --> 01:13:31,095
You were pretty good today, kid,
pretty handy.

718
01:13:31,297 --> 01:13:34,846
_ Where did you learn that stuff?
_ Not in college.

719
01:13:35,057 --> 01:13:40,132
We're just trying to make you rich and
respectable. You fight us every step.

720
01:13:40,338 --> 01:13:44,295
I don't want to be rich and respectable.
I want to be like the rest of you.

721
01:13:44,496 --> 01:13:47,534
_ ls he sassing you again?
_ I don't know what to do with him.

722
01:13:47,737 --> 01:13:52,891
_ Ain't you no respect for your Elders?
_ That ain't funny. I heard it before.

723
01:13:53,097 --> 01:13:58,410
Katie would have bloodied our
backsides with a birch for talking back.

724
01:13:58,617 --> 01:14:02,530
Which one of you is man enough
to fill in for Ma?

725
01:14:04,417 --> 01:14:07,567
Oh, no. Oh, no, you wouldn't!
No, hey, no!

726
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,607
Come on!

727
01:14:30,016 --> 01:14:36,126
Fellows! I thought I taught you better
than to take a bath with your clothes on.

728
01:15:14,336 --> 01:15:17,771
There's a posse up there.
What do you suppose they're after?

729
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:23,525
It can't be us. Unless they think
we stole these horses.

730
01:15:23,735 --> 01:15:27,648
_ It's Ben Latta. They must be after us.
_ What are we going to do?

731
01:15:27,855 --> 01:15:30,734
We've done nothing wrong.
We won't act like it.

732
01:15:30,936 --> 01:15:36,135
We'll just pick up these horses and start
out like we were just passing through.

733
01:15:38,415 --> 01:15:41,692
There's four of them.
It's the Elders all right.

734
01:15:52,855 --> 01:15:55,165
I told you not to fire! I want 'em alive.

735
01:15:55,376 --> 01:15:57,765
_ Bud?
_ I'm all right.

736
01:16:22,095 --> 01:16:24,289
What's this for?

737
01:16:24,494 --> 01:16:28,283
_ Stealing horses is against the law.
_ So is shooting 'em.

738
01:16:28,495 --> 01:16:32,123
We got these legal,
and we can prove it.

739
01:16:32,334 --> 01:16:35,929
I don't expect you all
to believe us, but Billy will.

740
01:16:36,134 --> 01:16:40,014
_ Then why did you shoot him?
_ Billy's shot?

741
01:16:40,215 --> 01:16:41,808
Shot but not dead.

742
01:16:42,616 --> 01:16:44,651
He'll tell us who did it...

743
01:16:44,855 --> 01:16:47,766
...when he tried to bring Tom in.

744
01:16:56,574 --> 01:16:58,610
This doesn't make sense.

745
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:03,570
If we were running away and had shot
Billy, why pick up a herd of horses?

746
01:17:03,775 --> 01:17:08,893
_ And bring them through Clearwater?
_ Throw your guns on the ground.

747
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:13,971
Do as he says.

748
01:17:14,974 --> 01:17:17,886
More killings won't prove anything.

749
01:17:20,893 --> 01:17:23,362
A couple of you tie them up.

750
01:17:29,134 --> 01:17:32,011
_ We've got all them horses.
_ Their owner will find them.

751
01:17:32,213 --> 01:17:35,250
I've got a letter from the owner.

752
01:17:35,453 --> 01:17:38,446
_ That don't do much for Billy.
_ We didn't do it.

753
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:41,928
Billy was at the Lupin place
when he was shot.

754
01:17:42,132 --> 01:17:47,492
_ The Lupin place?
_ Yeah. If they try anything, shoot 'em.

755
01:18:11,654 --> 01:18:16,329
I'm making you a present.
You can have all the good deeds.

756
01:18:16,533 --> 01:18:18,364
What good deeds?

757
01:18:18,573 --> 01:18:22,168
A good deed for Ma.
Ain't that why we're here?

758
01:18:22,373 --> 01:18:27,526
We're here because
you got yourself on a wanted poster.

759
01:18:27,732 --> 01:18:30,724
You make it personal for a man
that's been in a few scrapes himself.

760
01:18:30,933 --> 01:18:32,730
Tell us what happened.

761
01:18:32,933 --> 01:18:36,403
Some bartender got sore
because I was raffling off my eye.

762
01:18:36,613 --> 01:18:38,763
Started banging away at me with a .45.

763
01:18:38,973 --> 01:18:41,805
_ I did the only thing I could do.
_ It was self_defence.

764
01:18:42,012 --> 01:18:44,401
Why didn't you stand trial
and clear yourself?

765
01:18:44,613 --> 01:18:48,605
Because it was his town
and I was an outsider.

766
01:18:49,451 --> 01:18:50,725
Look.

767
01:19:23,452 --> 01:19:26,091
_ How's Billy?
_ I don't know.

768
01:19:29,252 --> 01:19:33,325
_ You think we did it, too.
_ I don't know what to think.

769
01:19:33,532 --> 01:19:36,443
If only you'd gone away
after the funeral.

770
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:50,170
Whiskey. Hate.

771
01:19:52,491 --> 01:19:56,120
Seems like everybody in this town's
made up their mind.

772
01:19:56,331 --> 01:20:00,802
Go on home, Mary. Stay home.
I don't want you around here.

773
01:20:02,291 --> 01:20:04,203
Billy's dead.

774
01:20:05,412 --> 01:20:07,290
Go on.

775
01:20:08,093 --> 01:20:09,810
Did he say who shot him?

776
01:20:11,051 --> 01:20:14,249
He never opened his mouth
to say you didn't.

777
01:20:17,252 --> 01:20:19,526
_ Get a rope!
_ Let's hang them!

778
01:20:22,771 --> 01:20:24,443
I told you to go home.

779
01:20:24,651 --> 01:20:27,530
_ What about that mob?
_ They had a feeling for Billy.

780
01:20:27,732 --> 01:20:31,246
_ Tell them Billy wouldn't lynch a man.
_ Four men.

781
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:36,206
Three men and a boy. How can you
be so sure they're guilty, Ben?

782
01:20:36,411 --> 01:20:39,562
They're convinced.
The same that would make up a jury.

783
01:20:39,771 --> 01:20:44,844
You arrest them. You don't judge them.
Get the marshal to come here.

784
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:47,565
Quit telling me how to do my job.

785
01:21:02,531 --> 01:21:06,647
Did you see the way
them people are looking at us?

786
01:21:06,849 --> 01:21:09,125
Yeah, I saw.

787
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:13,165
And we're getting out of here.

788
01:21:17,051 --> 01:21:19,564
You figure on doing it different?

789
01:21:21,651 --> 01:21:26,042
They come to feed us in the morning,
we'll get the key.

790
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:50,202
_ How's it look?
_ Not good, Judge.

791
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:54,368
_ Better set their trial for in the morning.
_ Pick a jury out of that mob?

792
01:21:54,569 --> 01:21:57,846
It wouldn't be justice. It'd be murder.

793
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:01,485
We got enough of those, Charlie?

794
01:22:01,690 --> 01:22:06,319
No, we ain't. Them guns ain't
going to stop no mob, and you know it.

795
01:22:06,529 --> 01:22:10,967
_ Do you want to let them in?
_ Don't you talk to me like that!

796
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:14,638
Me and Billy Wilson never
lost a prisoner, mobs or no mobs.

797
01:22:14,848 --> 01:22:18,762
He broke 'em up, and without no guns,
neither. I seen him do it.

798
01:22:18,969 --> 01:22:21,962
But then you ain't no Billy Wilson!

799
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:25,719
_ He didn't mean anything.
_ Why don't he use his head?

800
01:22:25,930 --> 01:22:29,126
If he was a patch on Billy's shirt,

801
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:33,118
he'd get those boys out of town
before it's too late.

802
01:22:33,330 --> 01:22:36,799
Look out there.
Them's friends of yours until now.

803
01:22:37,009 --> 01:22:42,208
But pretty soon you'll be shooting
bullets at 'em. You will.

804
01:22:58,329 --> 01:23:01,320
We'll move 'em.

805
01:23:01,528 --> 01:23:04,999
We'll move them to Laredo
early in the morning.

806
01:23:29,049 --> 01:23:31,041
Tom, somebody's coming!

807
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:41,403
I guess they changed their mind.

808
01:23:41,609 --> 01:23:45,237
Yell out to one of them deputies.
Tell them you're sick.

809
01:23:48,848 --> 01:23:52,728
Are you out of your mind?
You want to get your neck stretched?

810
01:23:52,929 --> 01:23:55,363
_ We're facing it.
_ Not a lynch mob.

811
01:23:55,569 --> 01:23:59,402
We're here because you ran in
New Orleans. We're not running again.

812
01:23:59,608 --> 01:24:03,203
_ Katie's not losing this one.
_ We're the ones who're in trouble!

813
01:24:03,408 --> 01:24:06,480
_ I suppose she wasn't.
_ She's the same as other mothers.

814
01:24:06,688 --> 01:24:10,202
Her kids didn't turn out the right way.
So what of it?

815
01:24:10,407 --> 01:24:14,037
Nobody's making any decisions for me.
I'll make my own.

816
01:24:14,248 --> 01:24:19,766
You can buy her an angel or a lamb,
pay her off with a slab of marble.

817
01:24:19,968 --> 01:24:23,562
You can make that decision.
But I'll decide this one.

818
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:29,524
If we all get killed out of this, nobody's
going to run. Katie wins this one.

819
01:24:38,648 --> 01:24:40,844
You're going to Laredo.

820
01:24:41,048 --> 01:24:44,926
Make one wrong move, you'll get
the same thing you gave Billy.

821
01:24:45,127 --> 01:24:46,447
Come on!

822
01:25:14,407 --> 01:25:17,318
_ Got the shackles ready?
_ All ready.

823
01:25:17,526 --> 01:25:22,078
_ All right, you two over here.
_ I don't want to be shackled to him!

824
01:25:22,287 --> 01:25:25,165
Kind of late to be choosy
about your friends.

825
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:27,959
Get a leg up.

826
01:25:35,287 --> 01:25:37,516
Make sure they're tight.

827
01:25:52,166 --> 01:25:54,317
Raise your right hands.

828
01:25:54,527 --> 01:25:59,042
Do you swear to act as deputy sheriffs
and uphold the laws of Texas?

829
01:25:59,246 --> 01:26:01,521
_ Say, "I do."
_ I do.

830
01:26:13,486 --> 01:26:15,442
Get in that wagon.

831
01:28:14,365 --> 01:28:17,276
Once on the bridge, they're all yours.

832
01:28:17,484 --> 01:28:20,715
_ I don't trust them guards.
_ The drivers are on our side.

833
01:28:20,924 --> 01:28:25,237
They've got their stories straight.
"We were ambushed by the Elder gang."

834
01:28:41,443 --> 01:28:43,195
Whoa!

835
01:28:46,004 --> 01:28:49,394
_ What are you stopping here for?
_ To rest the horses.

836
01:28:49,604 --> 01:28:54,279
_ Ned, what's the matter?
_ Resting the horses.

837
01:28:56,403 --> 01:28:58,554
_ All right...
_ Jump!

838
01:29:23,883 --> 01:29:26,033
Put your hands up, Ben.

839
01:29:28,123 --> 01:29:32,879
_ You're wearing a badge.
_ So was Billy. Drop that rifle.

840
01:29:49,082 --> 01:29:53,759
_ One gun won't hold them off very long.
_ Ben's got some guns in that rig.

841
01:29:53,963 --> 01:29:57,592
_ Think you can cover us?
_ Three shots worth.

842
01:29:57,803 --> 01:30:02,512
_ Can you keep underwater with me?
_ lf I can't, you just hold me under.

843
01:30:02,722 --> 01:30:04,553
Let's go. Come on.

844
01:30:44,922 --> 01:30:47,914
I knew you were
going to mob those boys.

845
01:30:48,122 --> 01:30:51,159
Sure you did, Ben.
But they had it coming.

846
01:31:08,682 --> 01:31:10,114
Hold it.

847
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:23,634
Tom! Tom!
Use the horses to get back.

848
01:31:29,483 --> 01:31:33,076
All right. Keep in step
or we'll get tangled and go down.

849
01:31:59,361 --> 01:32:02,159
All right, Curley,
this is what you were hired for.

850
01:32:02,361 --> 01:32:06,592
I don't want one of them Elders
to get out of here alive. Move!

851
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,392
All set?

852
01:32:35,241 --> 01:32:40,394
They've got a hold of Ben's guns.
We'll never get them out of there.

853
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:44,879
_ I'd like to blast them out of there.
_ There's dynamite in the gun box.

854
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,755
I don't like it.

855
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:09,993
Too quiet.

856
01:33:10,201 --> 01:33:12,349
Let's get back.

857
01:33:12,559 --> 01:33:14,914
Cover me.

858
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:21,953
Go!

859
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:05,673
Look out!

860
01:34:37,478 --> 01:34:39,470
Matt!

861
01:34:39,919 --> 01:34:41,954
_ John.
_ Let me help you.

862
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:44,876
No, please, l...

863
01:34:45,077 --> 01:34:48,309
John... I wish...

864
01:34:50,439 --> 01:34:52,829
Maybe Bud...

865
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:57,391
I... I wish...

866
01:35:10,638 --> 01:35:12,390
Here they come!

867
01:36:07,438 --> 01:36:09,156
I'm hit!

868
01:36:09,358 --> 01:36:11,508
I'm hit. John!

869
01:36:31,237 --> 01:36:34,866
John Elder, throw me a gun.
I'll help you.

870
01:36:35,077 --> 01:36:38,034
_ Ben's going to help them.
_ Stupid fool!

871
01:36:38,236 --> 01:36:40,796
No, Dad. That's Ben!

872
01:36:51,316 --> 01:36:52,954
Come on.

873
01:36:57,436 --> 01:37:00,472
_ Hastings is leaving. Let's go.
_ What'll we tell them in town?

874
01:37:00,675 --> 01:37:05,956
What Hastings said. We were
ambushed by the Elder gang. Let's go!

875
01:37:29,957 --> 01:37:33,074
Let's get out of here
before they come back.

876
01:37:33,277 --> 01:37:38,066
_ We're going back to town.
_ They'll kill us the minute we get there!

877
01:37:38,276 --> 01:37:40,506
_ We ain't going to run.
_ I am!

878
01:37:40,716 --> 01:37:46,267
How? There's one wagon, and Bud
needs a doctor. I'm taking him back.

879
01:37:46,475 --> 01:37:48,830
I'll get the buckboard.

880
01:38:27,156 --> 01:38:29,271
Get Bud in the barn.

881
01:38:38,756 --> 01:38:41,395
Hold it, Burr.

882
01:38:46,515 --> 01:38:49,154
Go on home. Get out of here.

883
01:38:50,315 --> 01:38:55,991
Wait a minute, kid. We're going
to need a doctor. Go get Doc lsdell.

884
01:38:57,114 --> 01:38:59,231
Go on, Jeb.

885
01:39:02,315 --> 01:39:03,987
Be quick about it.

886
01:39:06,434 --> 01:39:09,983
_ Take off these leg irons. Theirs first.
_ Yes, sir.

887
01:39:10,194 --> 01:39:13,709
_ Where are you going?
_ Doc lsdell's. One of them's hurt.

888
01:39:13,914 --> 01:39:15,983
_ What's your hurry?
_ Pa's in there.

889
01:39:16,193 --> 01:39:18,185
Let him go.

890
01:39:49,555 --> 01:39:52,705
That's it, Harry. That's far enough.

891
01:39:53,634 --> 01:39:55,829
What do you want?

892
01:39:56,034 --> 01:39:59,390
I want you to surrender.
Then I'll let the doctor through.

893
01:39:59,594 --> 01:40:02,585
Get the doctor,
or you'll be short of a blacksmith.

894
01:40:02,793 --> 01:40:05,945
_ Do what he says, Harry!
_ Not till we see you out here.

895
01:40:06,154 --> 01:40:09,226
_ Harry!
_ We can't trust him, Will.

896
01:40:09,434 --> 01:40:12,551
We can trust your deputies
to shoot us up.

897
01:40:12,754 --> 01:40:16,189
Your gang killed
a lot of good men doing their job.

898
01:40:16,393 --> 01:40:22,548
My gang? Then who killed Matt,
shot Bud and blew up the bridge?

899
01:40:22,753 --> 01:40:25,107
What about Billy?

900
01:40:25,312 --> 01:40:28,783
How long does it take a man
to ride to Pecos, Harry?

901
01:40:28,993 --> 01:40:31,508
Eight, nine hours.

902
01:40:31,714 --> 01:40:36,265
_ When did you last see Billy?
_ We were playing chess at nine.

903
01:40:36,474 --> 01:40:39,545
We can prove we were in Pecos
at nine o'clock.

904
01:40:41,834 --> 01:40:44,143
Send for the marshal, Harry.

905
01:40:44,354 --> 01:40:48,187
We'll give ourselves up.
But not to you, or anyone in this town.

906
01:40:48,393 --> 01:40:52,022
You get that US Marshal from Laredo
and we'll come out.

907
01:40:52,233 --> 01:40:56,273
_ How will I get a US Marshal here?
_ I don't know.

908
01:40:56,474 --> 01:41:00,227
Telegraph him, or go get him yourself.
But get him.

909
01:41:08,633 --> 01:41:10,463
Go on in, Doc.

910
01:41:21,153 --> 01:41:23,029
Over here.

911
01:41:25,672 --> 01:41:26,946
Out.

912
01:41:53,432 --> 01:41:55,627
One of them's wounded.

913
01:41:55,832 --> 01:41:58,300
I want you men to go home.

914
01:41:58,512 --> 01:42:02,392
Those men are my prisoners
the same as if they were in that jail.

915
01:42:02,593 --> 01:42:07,461
The US Marshal will be here. Any man
who starts trouble will answer to him.

916
01:42:07,672 --> 01:42:10,106
Now, break it up and go home!

917
01:42:11,512 --> 01:42:13,423
Go on!

918
01:42:30,551 --> 01:42:33,224
I've done about all I can for him now.

919
01:42:33,431 --> 01:42:38,744
You'd best get him over to
the boarding house as soon as you can.

920
01:43:07,071 --> 01:43:09,711
_ John.
_ Yeah?

921
01:43:09,912 --> 01:43:12,904
Don't worry about him.
He'll pull through.

922
01:43:13,112 --> 01:43:17,263
We'll see he gets raised right,
you and me.

923
01:43:38,431 --> 01:43:40,864
What if the marshal gets here first?

924
01:43:41,070 --> 01:43:44,984
It's their word against ours. Who'll take
the word of a gunfighter against mine?

925
01:43:45,191 --> 01:43:48,306
What if one of those guards
breaks, Pa?

926
01:43:50,189 --> 01:43:53,866
Only a weakling breaks.
They won't talk.

927
01:44:01,710 --> 01:44:05,465
Not in here, you idiot.
Do you want to blow us all up?

928
01:44:05,671 --> 01:44:08,344
Curley smoked in here.

929
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:13,386
You ain't Curley!

930
01:44:49,989 --> 01:44:51,422
John.

931
01:44:54,629 --> 01:44:58,018
Dave. He never did
answer any questions for us.

932
01:44:58,228 --> 01:45:02,109
_ We've got all the answers we'll get.
_ It's worth a try.

933
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:08,180
You're not going! You step one foot
outside that door and you're dead.

934
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:11,028
You're not going.

935
01:45:52,869 --> 01:45:57,305
Did Doc lsdell say anything
about changing the...?

936
01:47:17,267 --> 01:47:21,820
You make one move and you're dead!
Do as I say.

937
01:47:22,029 --> 01:47:23,826
Back.

938
01:48:09,587 --> 01:48:12,020
Move! Move!

939
01:48:41,586 --> 01:48:45,579
Right! There's one left for you.
Now, move!

940
01:49:24,305 --> 01:49:28,378
Here's a present for you.
Now, get your answers.

941
01:49:28,585 --> 01:49:32,863
I'm going to give you
some real good advice, mister.

942
01:49:33,065 --> 01:49:35,102
This is no time for lying.

943
01:49:35,306 --> 01:49:38,538
_ Who ambushed us?
_ I don't know.

944
01:49:40,866 --> 01:49:44,096
_ Answer me. Who killed my brother?
_ I don't know!

945
01:49:44,305 --> 01:49:47,025
Talk! You were there when Ben got it.

946
01:49:47,226 --> 01:49:50,900
_ Who ambushed us?
_ I don't know. I didn't do anything.

947
01:49:54,625 --> 01:49:58,938
When I let you breathe again, you'd
better come up with the right answers!

948
01:50:03,945 --> 01:50:07,620
Pa! I didn't tell them.

949
01:50:07,825 --> 01:50:11,864
I wasn't going to talk.
I wasn't going to talk.

950
01:50:12,066 --> 01:50:14,897
Drop that gun, Hastings.

951
01:50:15,984 --> 01:50:20,422
They shot at me. They got
my son Dave in there. Get him out!

952
01:50:25,545 --> 01:50:28,934
_ I didn't tell them!
_ Didn't tell them what, Dave?

953
01:50:29,144 --> 01:50:33,423
My father, he killed Ben. He killed him.

954
01:50:33,625 --> 01:50:35,262
And my dad?

955
01:50:36,184 --> 01:50:40,939
Your father found out
he was being cheated.

956
01:50:41,144 --> 01:50:44,455
And Billy kept
getting closer to the truth.

957
01:50:44,665 --> 01:50:47,180
Billy, too?

958
01:50:56,425 --> 01:50:57,937
John...

959
01:50:59,504 --> 01:51:01,699
...give me that gun.

960
01:51:01,904 --> 01:51:05,340
I represent the law around here now.
We'll take care of Hastings.

961
01:51:05,544 --> 01:51:08,537
I don't want
any trouble with you, Harry.

962
01:51:08,745 --> 01:51:12,100
I wouldn't argue with him.

963
01:51:54,585 --> 01:51:56,814
John.

964
01:51:57,024 --> 01:52:00,379
This is something
I have to do myself, Harry.

965
01:52:01,424 --> 01:52:04,461
Get Doc lsdell for Tom.

966
01:55:20,622 --> 01:55:22,259
John.

967
01:55:29,581 --> 01:55:31,810
Bud's in here.

968
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:35,296
_ ls he all right?
_ Doc says he'll need lots of care.

969
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:39,779
_ He'll get it. And Tom?
_ Doc's with him now.

970
01:55:39,981 --> 01:55:44,098
Tom said it'd take
more than one bullet to kill him.

971
01:55:49,340 --> 01:55:51,012
He's in here.
