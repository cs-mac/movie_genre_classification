1
00:01:29,668 --> 00:01:32,482
Hey, you! Switch the engine off!

2
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:34,651
No, don't accelerate!

3
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:36,801
Stop the engine!

4
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:21,824
As a boy, I had a list of favorite jobs.

5
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:23,865
My top 10.

6
00:03:24,324 --> 00:03:28,121
On top, it said in red letters, "Pilot."

7
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:33,531
And in second position?

8
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,089
Coffin-maker?

9
00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:41,246
I can't remember.

10
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:43,901
The other nine were of no importance.

11
00:03:45,284 --> 00:03:46,232
Watch out!

12
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:51,805
When it comes back, you have to duck!

13
00:03:52,227 --> 00:03:53,274
Okay.

14
00:03:57,795 --> 00:03:59,868
Beautiful flight.

15
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,932
Wow, Grandpa!

16
00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:09,727
Straight into the kitchen window!

17
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:30,170
<i>It's like a real piano!</i>

18
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,660
<i>Did you say, "Thank you"?</i>

19
00:04:33,763 --> 00:04:34,711
<i>Thanks.</i>

20
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:46,208
<i>The boy needs a real piano.</i>

21
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:49,755
Mom, when do I get a real piano?

22
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:55,003
Vitus, get dressed. We have to go.

23
00:04:56,675 --> 00:04:59,064
You'll have to ask your dad.

24
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:03,159
Okay.

25
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,234
Dad, when do I get a piano?

26
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:13,305
You'll have to ask your godmother.

27
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:15,321
Okay.

28
00:05:15,684 --> 00:05:18,334
Watch out! Don't touch anything.

29
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:23,458
This thing can hear
five times better than a human ear.

30
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,780
Bats can hear 10 times better.

31
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:28,061
Yeah? Really?

32
00:05:28,547 --> 00:05:30,751
Put these on.

33
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:37,308
I hear even less now.

34
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:38,811
Wait a minute.

35
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:41,560
You're right. There are no batteries.

36
00:05:41,923 --> 00:05:43,745
But when this thing is finished,

37
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,745
everything will be put into a microchip,

38
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:48,607
which will be built into this here.

39
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:50,617
Then you'll hear as well as a cat.

40
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:53,114
I'm going to call it Cat-Ear.

41
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,937
Actually, Bat-Ear would be better.

42
00:05:56,772 --> 00:05:58,365
I would like that, too.

43
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:01,784
Speaking of Bat-Ear,
I've got something for you.

44
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:04,317
And in fact, it works.

45
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,161
Press here, and it lights up.

46
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:09,725
Look at the red light.

47
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:14,043
There are two little microphones.

48
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:19,193
<i>And then this.</i>

49
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:22,335
<i>Now you can hear like a bat.</i>

50
00:06:23,171 --> 00:06:25,659
<i>Come to the window.</i>

51
00:06:37,284 --> 00:06:38,810
It's great, isn't it?

52
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:41,532
<i>I wouldn't do that, Olga.</i>

53
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:43,840
<i>Soon he'll be telling you what to do.</i>

54
00:06:44,131 --> 00:06:45,854
Vitus, hurry up and get dressed!

55
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:47,898
Actually, I'll need that back.

56
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:53,854
When's your appointment?

57
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,516
Not till the afternoon.

58
00:06:56,771 --> 00:07:00,349
Damn, I can't find my transparencies.

59
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:03,578
Does this have to happen now?
It's paradoxical!

60
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:06,530
No, it's typical.

61
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:10,139
Dad, what does "paradoxical" mean?

62
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,074
- "Paradoxical" means...
- Leo.

63
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:17,310
I'll tell you later.

64
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:19,070
But I want to know it now.

65
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:20,636
Two minutes.

66
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,104
Okay, two minutes.

67
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:47,775
Just a quick question.

68
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:52,985
Could I work 70% instead of 30?

69
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:57,087
Okay, but what about Vitus?

70
00:07:57,187 --> 00:07:59,489
We have a very expensive child.

71
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:03,003
We have a babysitter now,
the daughter of our gem.

72
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,089
Monti's daughter?

73
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:05,400
Great.

74
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:14,879
No wonder a lot of people
would rather do without a hearing aid

75
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:17,761
and give up some quality of life

76
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:20,095
than carry a snail shell behind their ears.

77
00:08:21,155 --> 00:08:23,937
You know that we generate 90%

78
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:26,174
of our turnover with these snails.

79
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:29,625
I know that, but if Phonaxis
wants to become a global player...

80
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:33,506
Young people should wear
our hearing aids as fashion items, then?

81
00:08:33,604 --> 00:08:36,506
Maybe in fluorescent colors?

82
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,585
Yes, that's exactly what I think.

83
00:08:39,972 --> 00:08:43,932
We have to beat the competition,
which isn't sleeping, either,

84
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:50,394
with highly intelligent
and pretty hearing computers.

85
00:08:52,035 --> 00:08:54,556
That means, don't hide your hearing aid,

86
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:59,554
but show it off and present it like jewelry.

87
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:03,455
On the table, you can see my prototypes,

88
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:05,792
the Cat-Ear and the Bat-Ear.

89
00:09:06,115 --> 00:09:09,148
The design might need a few changes,

90
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:10,974
but this is all about the idea, isn't it?

91
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:17,087
Sounds like you want to lead
the project yourself.

92
00:09:17,347 --> 00:09:19,900
That's exactly what I think.

93
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:22,459
Why should I believe in you?

94
00:09:22,691 --> 00:09:24,862
You even dropped out of university!

95
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:29,595
Because, otherwise,
I'll go to the competition.

96
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:34,907
Thanks for the presentation.

97
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:39,809
You'll be hearing from us.

98
00:09:42,627 --> 00:09:47,231
The other day, he read
about global warming to the children.

99
00:09:47,523 --> 00:09:49,084
He told them they would all have to die.

100
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:51,195
The children started to cry.

101
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,404
And then I get
the phone calls from the parents.

102
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:56,638
Why don't you tell Vitus to read

103
00:09:57,475 --> 00:10:00,258
<i>The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids</i> to them.

104
00:10:00,355 --> 00:10:02,657
Actually, that's my job.

105
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:07,135
Vitus should be at school, not kindergarten.

106
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,207
And besides, he's very cheeky.

107
00:10:10,755 --> 00:10:14,017
Instead of calling me Mrs. Pfenninger.
He calls me Obelix.

108
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:17,568
But that's a compliment.

109
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,423
He loves Obelix.

110
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:32,985
I'll take him with me.

111
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,066
Come on, let's go.

112
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,857
- Bye, Obelix.
- Bye.

113
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:39,994
I've had enough.

114
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:42,716
They're getting soggy.

115
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:55,741
- I love you.
- I know.

116
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:59,585
Don't wipe off the lipstick
so people can see that you're taken.

117
00:11:00,099 --> 00:11:02,554
- Bye, Vitus.
- Bye.

118
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:04,547
See you in the foyer at 7:30.

119
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:12,473
Listen, Vitus, you don't have
to go to kindergarten anymore.

120
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:14,430
Cool.

121
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:17,725
While I'm at work,
a babysitter will look after you.

122
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:19,836
But I'm not a baby.

123
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:24,027
Then just call her a girlfriend.
Isabel is coming tonight.

124
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:26,368
We're going to a concert, okay?

125
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:28,828
I'll have to practice tonight.

126
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,828
You can practice all day.

127
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:36,504
- Can I?
- Of course.

128
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:52,921
Nobody's ever got to the top as fast as you.

129
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,336
Ah, Isabel.

130
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:07,772
Hello, Mrs. von Holzen.

131
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:10,624
Call me Helen. Please come in.

132
00:12:13,763 --> 00:12:15,257
Okay.

133
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:20,988
Vitus has a shower every evening.

134
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:24,385
So now you know where to find everything.

135
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:27,165
And, once again, never disturb Vitus

136
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:29,274
- while he's practicing, okay?
- Okay.

137
00:12:29,571 --> 00:12:31,840
Take care. Bye, Vitus!

138
00:13:10,307 --> 00:13:11,255
Vitus?

139
00:13:11,363 --> 00:13:12,410
I'm reading.

140
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:18,044
Can I come in?

141
00:13:18,147 --> 00:13:20,481
Be quiet. I want to read.

142
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:43,072
Did you know
that it was me who made the bat?

143
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:46,107
I gave it to you for your first birthday.

144
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:48,092
It's called Abraham.

145
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:50,491
- Abraham?
- Abraham.

146
00:13:50,883 --> 00:13:52,410
That's a beautiful name.

147
00:14:03,394 --> 00:14:05,249
Oh, my God, it's so big.

148
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,101
Do you mind if we pick some flowers?

149
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:23,167
It's all right, my little darling.

150
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:27,617
I just need to pick some flowers.

151
00:14:33,187 --> 00:14:36,733
See? You just have to ask politely.

152
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:40,002
Why are you picking flowers for my mother?

153
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,506
Because she reminds me
of your grandmother.

154
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,576
Can you show me a photo of her?

155
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:54,304
She was too beautiful for a photo.

156
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:57,756
Oh, no, we've just missed the train.

157
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:00,768
We'll take the next one.

158
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:07,962
The walls are freshly painted. New furniture.

159
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:10,498
Have you suddenly become rich?

160
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:13,343
What do you mean by rich?

161
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,536
Would you like to wear one of my suits?

162
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:23,007
If I'm not good enough
for your dinner party,

163
00:15:23,938 --> 00:15:25,978
feel free to cancel the invitation.

164
00:15:28,226 --> 00:15:30,844
You've brought some lovely flowers.

165
00:15:30,947 --> 00:15:33,794
Yes, they're from a very special shop.

166
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:37,335
You're even more charming than your son.

167
00:15:37,443 --> 00:15:39,647
Well, that's not really hard.

168
00:15:40,835 --> 00:15:43,039
- Where's Vitus?
- In his room.

169
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:47,361
Are you getting dressed up?

170
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:56,319
I'm not into costume parties.

171
00:15:56,578 --> 00:15:58,553
Let's get away, Grandpa.

172
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:02,587
That's impossible. You're the host.

173
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,281
Have a pleasant evening.

174
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:31,514
Cheers!

175
00:16:32,194 --> 00:16:33,983
You have a nice place here.

176
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,424
A typical 1930s house.

177
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:37,181
It's going to be pulled down soon.

178
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:39,170
That's why the rent is low.

179
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:44,831
To go public at the right moment
could be a stroke of genius.

180
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,938
You want to go public with Phonaxis?

181
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:48,603
I have a feeling

182
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:53,279
that our Cat-Ear
will attract lots of speculators.

183
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:57,241
It's either boom or bust.

184
00:16:57,635 --> 00:16:59,969
I do feel optimistic.

185
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:02,816
But I'm still against going public.

186
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:05,657
The stakes are too high.

187
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:11,392
Mr. von Holzen,
you are our savior or our ruin.

188
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:13,149
I hope I'm not either of them.

189
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:15,706
Nick, take a look at that buffet!

190
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,680
Yes, just help yourself.

191
00:17:18,946 --> 00:17:22,329
Thanks. We know how it works.

192
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:32,185
Why does he hate me?

193
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:35,424
Because your wife is more beautiful.

194
00:17:36,226 --> 00:17:37,175
True.

195
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:38,657
You'll talk him round.

196
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,545
I'm not musical at all.

197
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:46,848
My godson, however,
is all the more musical.

198
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,469
- Really?
- Yes, it's incredible.

199
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,580
That's interesting.

200
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,840
My husband wanted to become a pianist.

201
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,057
Really?

202
00:17:57,507 --> 00:17:58,652
It was a long time ago.

203
00:18:04,674 --> 00:18:05,951
Oh, excuse me.

204
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,327
Do you play the piano?

205
00:18:07,427 --> 00:18:09,314
No, our son does.

206
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:12,059
Oh, a talented family.

207
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,110
But surely not these difficult notes.

208
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:18,337
Yes, he has a good teacher.

209
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:20,923
He's been taking lessons for six months.

210
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:22,683
For six months?

211
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:24,412
You don't believe that yourself!

212
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:26,846
He doesn't play like a maestro.

213
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:29,751
Leo?

214
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:40,858
Would you play something for us? No?

215
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,039
Come on, only one piece.

216
00:18:43,395 --> 00:18:45,467
We'd all be delighted.

217
00:18:55,523 --> 00:18:56,984
What does he play?

218
00:18:57,826 --> 00:18:59,899
Robert Schumann's <i>Wild Rider.</i>

219
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:10,844
Vitus.

220
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:13,150
What a sweet little chap!

221
00:19:16,803 --> 00:19:19,552
You can sense that he's musical.

222
00:19:20,194 --> 00:19:21,176
Beautiful.

223
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:45,851
Extraordinary.

224
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:48,737
A real wunderkind.

225
00:19:49,762 --> 00:19:51,486
I've never seen anything like it.

226
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:10,689
He's only six, but we do hope...

227
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,279
Well, he didn't get it from me.

228
00:20:13,443 --> 00:20:16,705
They've told us that his IQ
is so high it's incalculable,

229
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:19,039
but I don't know much about it.

230
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:20,513
<i>I'm too stupid.</i>

231
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:24,767
<i>I've been telling Leo</i>
<i>that we're raising a real talent here.</i>

232
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:29,794
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>the horoscope that I did for Vitus?</i>

233
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:38,776
<i>You carry a huge responsibility,</i>

234
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,025
<i>especially as his mother,</i>

235
00:20:41,923 --> 00:20:44,224
<i>- if you know what I mean.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

236
00:20:44,738 --> 00:20:48,862
<i>All of the world's great pianists</i>
<i>were so-called wunderkinds</i>

237
00:20:49,507 --> 00:20:51,295
<i>in their childhood.</i>

238
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:54,017
<i>No exception.</i>

239
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,992
<i>You really have to foster his talents.</i>

240
00:20:57,282 --> 00:20:58,526
<i>The earlier, the better.</i>

241
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:01,048
<i>He should go straight to the conservatory.</i>

242
00:21:01,154 --> 00:21:06,140
<i>You don't just owe this to your son</i>
<i>but also to music.</i>

243
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:13,598
Now the world knows
we have a real wunderkind

244
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:19,616
<i>and a cheeky little monkey.</i>

245
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:23,484
<i>Maybe Knaak was right.</i>

246
00:21:23,842 --> 00:21:25,664
<i>We have to foster his talents.</i>

247
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:28,924
<i>What he doesn't learn now, he'll never learn.</i>

248
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,832
We shouldn't put pressure on him.

249
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,839
Otherwise, he might do the opposite.

250
00:21:35,235 --> 00:21:38,682
It won't work without a little pressure.

251
00:21:38,786 --> 00:21:40,695
Vitus needs that.

252
00:21:40,803 --> 00:21:41,817
Same as you.

253
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,096
You're right in principle,

254
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:52,032
but an academy is for adults.

255
00:21:52,675 --> 00:21:55,260
The boy doesn't even go to school yet.

256
00:21:55,362 --> 00:21:56,572
But didn't you...

257
00:21:56,674 --> 00:22:00,187
However, I have recognized his talent.

258
00:22:02,242 --> 00:22:04,762
We will accept him.

259
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:06,939
Did you hear that, Vitus?

260
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:09,595
I'll teach you myself.

261
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:12,571
That's unbelievable!

262
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:15,778
Thank you very much.

263
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:22,785
Are you a concert pianist yourself?

264
00:22:24,034 --> 00:22:26,173
He's in good hands with me.

265
00:22:26,723 --> 00:22:28,511
Are you happy, Vitus?

266
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,697
Of course, he'll keep on taking lessons,

267
00:22:34,242 --> 00:22:35,737
but not with you, I'm afraid.

268
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:41,247
Don't you understand...

269
00:22:43,555 --> 00:22:44,962
Now, listen!

270
00:22:46,242 --> 00:22:49,722
He's our son,
and you're just not good enough for him!

271
00:22:50,754 --> 00:22:54,649
And I'm sorry, too, Mrs. Piantoni.

272
00:22:54,754 --> 00:22:56,347
Just send me the bill!

273
00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:58,433
Goodbye, Mrs. Piantoni.

274
00:23:05,762 --> 00:23:06,875
Where is he, by the way?

275
00:23:06,978 --> 00:23:09,564
In his room. He doesn't want to eat.

276
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,800
He wants to stay with Mrs. Piantoni.

277
00:23:13,474 --> 00:23:15,808
"I love her," he said.

278
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:22,555
Vitus?

279
00:23:25,091 --> 00:23:26,781
I've got something for you.

280
00:23:29,123 --> 00:23:30,529
Come out here.

281
00:23:36,994 --> 00:23:39,896
Vitus, hold the spandrel.

282
00:23:41,826 --> 00:23:44,925
Why shouldn't it fly?

283
00:23:45,794 --> 00:23:48,250
You know
all about aerodynamics, don't you?

284
00:23:49,154 --> 00:23:53,758
The bulge creates an air cushion,

285
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:56,029
and it flies.

286
00:23:56,674 --> 00:24:00,536
All we need is
some silky skin like the bats have.

287
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,952
Very good. Silky skin!

288
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,982
Yes, silky skin.

289
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:15,710
Do you want to learn how to saw?

290
00:24:16,675 --> 00:24:18,813
- Okay.
- Come here. I'll show you.

291
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,290
Hold here

292
00:24:23,874 --> 00:24:27,420
and follow this line here.

293
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:31,990
And now you.

294
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:35,640
But I'm not allowed to play with this.

295
00:24:35,746 --> 00:24:37,688
We're not playing. We're working!

296
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,297
Come on!

297
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:43,545
Hold the work piece,

298
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,211
and go!

299
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,513
Yes.

300
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,064
Are you completely mad?

301
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:10,298
What if he hurt his hands?
Just imagine the disaster!

302
00:25:16,706 --> 00:25:18,462
Listen, Helen,

303
00:25:18,754 --> 00:25:20,761
we are building wings.

304
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:22,651
Wings? What for?

305
00:25:22,978 --> 00:25:24,472
To fly, of course.

306
00:25:24,578 --> 00:25:27,393
That's what they'll look like.

307
00:25:27,971 --> 00:25:32,248
Vitus, promise that you'll never play
with such dangerous things again.

308
00:25:32,354 --> 00:25:34,394
We're not playing. We're working.

309
00:25:37,794 --> 00:25:39,550
I'm the boss here.

310
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:41,849
But I wear the trousers.

311
00:25:44,098 --> 00:25:48,538
I wish you a very happy birthday.

312
00:25:50,146 --> 00:25:52,056
Many thanks.

313
00:25:54,434 --> 00:25:56,027
When you come here next time,

314
00:25:57,186 --> 00:26:00,634
we will fly.

315
00:26:15,906 --> 00:26:18,273
Oh, no, you can't do this to me.

316
00:26:20,258 --> 00:26:21,273
Okay.

317
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:24,728
No, I'm very proud of you.

318
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,788
Yes, me, too.

319
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:35,229
We'll eat without Daddy.

320
00:26:45,474 --> 00:26:47,514
- Bye, Isabel.
- Bye.

321
00:26:47,618 --> 00:26:48,665
See you.

322
00:26:50,594 --> 00:26:51,771
Vitus?

323
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:53,211
Bye-bye.

324
00:26:55,874 --> 00:26:57,598
We're going to Sonja and Walter's.

325
00:26:58,274 --> 00:27:00,412
Your dinner is on the table.

326
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:05,881
We'll be back around 11:00, okay?

327
00:27:05,986 --> 00:27:06,968
Yes, I know.

328
00:27:19,394 --> 00:27:21,565
How long are you gonna stay in your room?

329
00:27:25,826 --> 00:27:28,095
Until I'm an adult.

330
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,319
Can you help me?

331
00:27:36,546 --> 00:27:39,296
It's much too heavy for us.

332
00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:58,270
If you want, you can come with me.

333
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,028
Until we're adults?

334
00:28:01,122 --> 00:28:02,169
Okay.

335
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:13,273
Really? That's extreme.

336
00:28:13,762 --> 00:28:17,177
Do you want to know how bats reproduce?

337
00:28:17,794 --> 00:28:19,223
No, thank you.

338
00:28:20,898 --> 00:28:23,265
What do you want to be when you grow up?

339
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:25,691
I don't know yet.

340
00:28:26,786 --> 00:28:29,371
You know so much, but not that?

341
00:28:30,402 --> 00:28:33,184
I want to become a rock singer.

342
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:42,167
Sounds good.

343
00:29:47,298 --> 00:29:49,207
They left the light on.

344
00:30:05,858 --> 00:30:07,419
What?

345
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:11,646
Isabel?

346
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:15,902
Isabel, get up!

347
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:20,119
Come on, I'll take you home.

348
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:23,674
Isabel, what did you two do?

349
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:25,087
No idea.

350
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,869
Come with me.

351
00:30:34,338 --> 00:30:36,225
Baby.

352
00:30:39,586 --> 00:30:41,342
I'm back.

353
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,344
What's got into the girl?

354
00:30:46,338 --> 00:30:48,510
- Did you ask her?
- No.

355
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,410
How could she give alcohol to Vitus?

356
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,344
Come here.

357
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:07,738
You've filmed them?

358
00:31:07,842 --> 00:31:10,046
Yes, I used a sensor.

359
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:18,396
My dress, my jewelry!

360
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:30,400
We need a new babysitter.

361
00:31:30,594 --> 00:31:34,424
Okay, but she's a good dancer.

362
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,006
Think it over.

363
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:49,473
Sorry, but I've already decided.

364
00:31:49,698 --> 00:31:51,640
And what about your career?

365
00:31:52,033 --> 00:31:54,816
Maybe this is my career.

366
00:31:56,065 --> 00:31:59,294
Even the experts say now or never.

367
00:32:02,242 --> 00:32:03,867
You're so quiet.

368
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,795
Are you ill? Is something bothering you?

369
00:32:14,178 --> 00:32:16,414
I've been waiting all day.

370
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:24,960
Okay, then, let me guess.

371
00:32:27,874 --> 00:32:29,434
You're in love?

372
00:32:30,402 --> 00:32:31,995
Not me,

373
00:32:33,057 --> 00:32:36,767
but I know
who I'm gonna marry when I'm grown-up.

374
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,953
Really? And who will that be?

375
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,965
Come on, tell me!

376
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:46,967
But it's still a secret.

377
00:32:50,785 --> 00:32:52,094
Isabel?

378
00:32:54,498 --> 00:32:55,643
Isabel?

379
00:32:58,625 --> 00:32:59,770
Isabel?

380
00:33:02,498 --> 00:33:03,676
Isabel?

381
00:33:08,898 --> 00:33:10,752
Mommy, when is Isabel coming?

382
00:33:11,042 --> 00:33:13,409
Vitus, I have a surprise for you.

383
00:33:13,506 --> 00:33:15,099
You have a new babysitter.

384
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,800
Me!

385
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,129
I don't need a babysitter!

386
00:33:20,226 --> 00:33:23,422
And Isabel is my girlfriend.

387
00:33:23,554 --> 00:33:26,488
Listen, Isabel won't be coming anymore.

388
00:33:27,042 --> 00:33:31,035
She's too young to have
such a huge responsibility.

389
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,679
Come on, let's practice the piano.

390
00:33:35,842 --> 00:33:38,330
No, I want Isabel back!

391
00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:43,895
Are you crazy?

392
00:33:57,633 --> 00:33:59,488
Hello, who is it?

393
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:03,704
- Post, express delivery.
- I'm coming!

394
00:34:21,922 --> 00:34:23,383
Vitus!

395
00:34:29,282 --> 00:34:31,321
Vitus, you can't do that!

396
00:34:33,665 --> 00:34:34,778
Vitus!

397
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,075
Vitus!

398
00:34:50,433 --> 00:34:51,895
Vitus!

399
00:35:17,729 --> 00:35:18,973
Vitus!

400
00:35:19,426 --> 00:35:21,597
Open that stupid door at once!

401
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,245
Vitus, open the door!

402
00:35:30,242 --> 00:35:31,420
Damn it all!

403
00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:35,927
I'll give you one more chance!

404
00:35:37,058 --> 00:35:39,425
Or else I'll get
the caretaker with his crowbar.

405
00:35:39,522 --> 00:35:42,521
I'll count to 10! One, two, three,

406
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:45,560
four, five, six, seven,

407
00:35:45,698 --> 00:35:48,087
eight, nine, ten!

408
00:37:08,545 --> 00:37:12,637
Look, the professor
coming to school by taxi.

409
00:37:13,953 --> 00:37:15,131
Poor guy!

410
00:37:15,553 --> 00:37:18,750
That smart-ass
could at least wear normal clothes.

411
00:37:18,881 --> 00:37:23,158
Shitus will do that when he reaches puberty.

412
00:37:40,481 --> 00:37:44,954
The interest is 1.258%

413
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:47,446
and is being continuously credited.

414
00:37:49,217 --> 00:37:54,585
How much money will be on
his account after 322 days?

415
00:37:56,289 --> 00:37:58,199
Without the calculator, please.

416
00:38:02,178 --> 00:38:04,512
Ah, someone knows the result already.

417
00:38:06,306 --> 00:38:07,549
Vitus?

418
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:11,639
No, sir, but I could calculate it for you.

419
00:38:12,033 --> 00:38:13,462
Then go on.

420
00:38:13,857 --> 00:38:17,305
If the account neither has credit nor debit,

421
00:38:18,017 --> 00:38:20,406
the interest would be

422
00:38:21,474 --> 00:38:23,612
216.6.

423
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:28,952
So, after 322 days,

424
00:38:29,377 --> 00:38:35,935
there'd be 19,466.6 on the account.

425
00:38:38,754 --> 00:38:39,801
Correct.

426
00:38:40,258 --> 00:38:43,421
But your arrogant behavior
is an insult to my intelligence.

427
00:38:44,385 --> 00:38:48,313
Excuse me, sir,
but if I'm insulting your intelligence,

428
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:53,436
there are, after all, two people in here
who have some intelligence.

429
00:38:54,753 --> 00:38:56,576
Okay, that's enough.

430
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,780
Pack your bag and get out!

431
00:38:58,977 --> 00:39:00,319
Okay. Okay.

432
00:39:13,505 --> 00:39:15,328
The school has phoned again.

433
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:18,621
What has he done this time?

434
00:39:20,321 --> 00:39:21,728
They want to talk to us.

435
00:39:22,465 --> 00:39:23,610
Talk to us?

436
00:39:23,714 --> 00:39:25,055
Is Wednesday at 3:00 okay?

437
00:39:25,377 --> 00:39:27,200
Next week? No chance.

438
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:29,501
Leo, it's important.

439
00:39:30,017 --> 00:39:31,359
Yes, I know.

440
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:36,736
It's a shame your husband's not here.

441
00:39:36,865 --> 00:39:38,075
I think so, too.

442
00:39:40,353 --> 00:39:42,360
You can speak Swiss-German.

443
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:48,794
We really have to find a solution.

444
00:39:48,897 --> 00:39:51,231
Your son sabotages every lesson.

445
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:54,493
He doesn't miss a single opportunity
to make the teacher look stupid

446
00:39:54,594 --> 00:39:56,187
in front of the whole class.

447
00:39:56,545 --> 00:39:59,295
My teachers refuse to carry on teaching him.

448
00:39:59,617 --> 00:40:02,235
But you cannot throw out a child

449
00:40:02,337 --> 00:40:05,184
just because he isn't challenged enough.

450
00:40:05,281 --> 00:40:06,230
Yes, you are right.

451
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:11,072
That's why there are
special schools for the highly gifted.

452
00:40:11,937 --> 00:40:16,443
Vitus is wasting his time here,

453
00:40:17,057 --> 00:40:18,519
and we are wasting our time.

454
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:22,367
My husband and I
are against such zoological gardens.

455
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:25,405
A special-needs school
is out of the question.

456
00:40:25,922 --> 00:40:26,936
Well,

457
00:40:29,537 --> 00:40:33,596
in that case, I'll enroll Vitus
for the high school graduating exams.

458
00:40:34,401 --> 00:40:35,579
At the age of 12?

459
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:36,728
Yes, why not?

460
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:06,071
Good.

461
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:07,447
Very good.

462
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:10,874
Hold your horses.

463
00:41:11,585 --> 00:41:14,749
The left hand has to hold the pace.

464
00:41:15,201 --> 00:41:18,048
- Hold back a bit, know what I mean?
- No.

465
00:41:21,153 --> 00:41:23,193
Syncopation: tenuto!

466
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:27,318
That's boring.

467
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,799
Let's try the second last bar,

468
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:33,912
and try to play it a little bit boring.

469
00:42:01,345 --> 00:42:02,872
Would you like another slice?

470
00:42:02,977 --> 00:42:03,992
Yes, please.

471
00:42:05,985 --> 00:42:07,512
Here.

472
00:42:07,617 --> 00:42:08,599
Thanks.

473
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:11,354
Do you want to do your final exams now?

474
00:42:11,841 --> 00:42:13,248
I don't know. Why should I?

475
00:42:13,345 --> 00:42:16,574
You could go to university.

476
00:42:17,057 --> 00:42:18,879
You earn a lot as an engineer.

477
00:42:18,977 --> 00:42:20,887
You could still play piano as a hobby.

478
00:42:21,857 --> 00:42:24,061
The Institute of Technology at 13?

479
00:42:24,161 --> 00:42:25,884
Well, okay, it is a bit early.

480
00:42:26,689 --> 00:42:30,747
You could do
a traineeship with us for two or three years.

481
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:33,496
You could invent something, like your dad.

482
00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:35,903
Have you seen this before?

483
00:42:37,025 --> 00:42:40,059
It's the "mother of hearing aids."

484
00:42:40,385 --> 00:42:41,814
Worldwide.

485
00:42:43,745 --> 00:42:46,363
In fact, it's the further development
of the Cat-Ear and Bat-Ear.

486
00:42:46,465 --> 00:42:48,091
It's a kind of Rolls-Royce.

487
00:42:48,193 --> 00:42:53,015
With this, Phonaxis
has increased its turnover tenfold.

488
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:57,504
If I had bought some shares then,
we'd be rich now.

489
00:42:58,113 --> 00:42:59,454
But we are rich!

490
00:42:59,937 --> 00:43:02,042
I mean really rich.

491
00:43:03,553 --> 00:43:05,244
Shall I tell you a secret?

492
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,297
The boss will be retiring soon.

493
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:13,532
There's a rumor that I'll be his successor.

494
00:43:13,665 --> 00:43:14,614
Cool!

495
00:43:15,169 --> 00:43:18,431
You'll be the CEO of Phonaxis!

496
00:43:19,169 --> 00:43:20,696
Knock on wood.

497
00:43:24,065 --> 00:43:26,553
Ah, where were we?

498
00:43:27,937 --> 00:43:30,784
Yes, you have to plan your career.

499
00:43:30,881 --> 00:43:33,150
Let's have a look at it together.

500
00:43:37,121 --> 00:43:38,135
Von Holzen.

501
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:40,411
Hi, Klaus.

502
00:43:41,058 --> 00:43:42,432
What about the chips?

503
00:43:44,513 --> 00:43:47,862
I'm kind of busy, but go ahead.

504
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:55,487
Is that... Is that right?

505
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:59,928
Yes? Okay. Okay.

506
00:44:15,425 --> 00:44:18,272
Bat scientist, architect, chemist...

507
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:19,896
Don't you fancy any of these?

508
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:25,465
Maybe cabinetmaker,
and you could take over my workshop.

509
00:44:25,569 --> 00:44:27,511
- No.
- No.

510
00:44:30,305 --> 00:44:33,502
What about banker? Taxi driver?

511
00:44:34,753 --> 00:44:35,702
I got it.

512
00:44:37,249 --> 00:44:38,231
Pilot.

513
00:44:40,161 --> 00:44:41,176
Pilot.

514
00:44:42,209 --> 00:44:44,510
You don't even want to become a pilot.

515
00:44:47,681 --> 00:44:49,307
It's getting difficult now.

516
00:44:50,273 --> 00:44:55,838
Maybe butcher? Vet? Surgeon?

517
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,876
You are a hopeless case.

518
00:45:06,561 --> 00:45:09,114
I'd like to be someone else.

519
00:45:09,889 --> 00:45:11,547
Like who, for example?

520
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:15,067
I don't know. Whoever. Just normal.

521
00:45:15,873 --> 00:45:17,596
As normal as me?

522
00:45:17,953 --> 00:45:19,709
No, more normal.

523
00:45:20,097 --> 00:45:21,690
Well, then just become normal.

524
00:45:22,689 --> 00:45:24,096
But how?

525
00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:25,849
Hold this!

526
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:37,856
If you can't decide,

527
00:45:37,953 --> 00:45:41,149
you'll have to part with things you like.

528
00:45:42,113 --> 00:45:43,357
Get it?

529
00:45:49,697 --> 00:45:51,639
You've only practiced for two hours!

530
00:45:52,097 --> 00:45:55,326
If I have to play "holding back,"
I can also practice "holding back."

531
00:45:55,425 --> 00:45:57,050
Don't talk nonsense.

532
00:45:58,817 --> 00:46:00,027
Okay.

533
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:39,776
She lives in a castle?

534
00:46:40,321 --> 00:46:41,270
Look!

535
00:46:41,377 --> 00:46:43,287
She's coming towards us.

536
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:45,372
Is that her?

537
00:46:45,473 --> 00:46:47,229
Yes, that's her.

538
00:46:48,641 --> 00:46:51,903
Gina Fois, the living piano legend.

539
00:46:52,257 --> 00:46:54,079
She looks like an old bat.

540
00:46:55,009 --> 00:46:56,121
Vitus!

541
00:46:57,537 --> 00:46:59,293
So you're Vitus.

542
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,720
Nice to meet you.

543
00:47:02,081 --> 00:47:03,990
Have a seat.

544
00:47:05,377 --> 00:47:07,711
What are you going to play for me?

545
00:47:09,377 --> 00:47:11,832
I'd like you to play something for me.

546
00:47:13,377 --> 00:47:14,489
Me?

547
00:47:15,489 --> 00:47:17,661
That's very flattering,

548
00:47:18,305 --> 00:47:21,120
but I'd rather listen to you

549
00:47:21,217 --> 00:47:24,151
playing Scarlatti's sonata in E minor.

550
00:47:25,665 --> 00:47:26,712
No.

551
00:47:27,137 --> 00:47:29,657
Okay, I'll play something for you,

552
00:47:29,761 --> 00:47:32,314
but it's your turn first.

553
00:47:40,129 --> 00:47:41,558
I don't feel like it.

554
00:47:42,945 --> 00:47:44,570
Do it for me.

555
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:46,775
Why is it always for you?

556
00:47:50,081 --> 00:47:52,448
Don't worry, madam.

557
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:55,260
It's more important for a pianist

558
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,524
to have good parents than good teachers.

559
00:47:59,393 --> 00:48:03,801
Vitus, you should play neither
for your mother nor me.

560
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:07,035
Just take your time
until you feel like playing,

561
00:48:07,136 --> 00:48:10,170
playing the piano for the sake of the music.

562
00:48:13,153 --> 00:48:16,698
Cold rationality and a warm heart,

563
00:48:17,601 --> 00:48:21,310
that's what makes a great pianist.

564
00:48:23,425 --> 00:48:25,726
That's why I want to become a vet.

565
00:48:44,513 --> 00:48:46,902
Can I visit Grandpa for the weekend?

566
00:48:47,073 --> 00:48:48,414
No way!

567
00:48:54,624 --> 00:48:58,650
Do you have any idea how many youngsters
would like an opportunity like this?

568
00:48:59,713 --> 00:49:01,753
They come here from all over the world

569
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:04,158
just for one single piano lesson, and you?

570
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,503
Vitus?

571
00:51:26,816 --> 00:51:27,864
Has it come?

572
00:51:30,177 --> 00:51:31,354
Come on, sweetheart.

573
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,869
We're here!

574
00:51:43,457 --> 00:51:45,693
He was lucky.

575
00:51:46,913 --> 00:51:50,710
We couldn't find any injuries,

576
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,987
not one bruise.

577
00:51:54,304 --> 00:51:57,600
Extraordinary, considering the heavy fall.

578
00:52:00,224 --> 00:52:02,428
There are miracles, though,

579
00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:04,765
especially with children.

580
00:52:05,505 --> 00:52:08,538
- The wings carried him for a bit.
- Yes.

581
00:52:09,281 --> 00:52:11,670
But he isn't an Icarus, luckily.

582
00:52:12,448 --> 00:52:13,790
He's still unconscious.

583
00:52:14,433 --> 00:52:18,556
At the moment, the initial diagnosis
is concussion of the brain.

584
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:20,278
What do you mean, "At the moment"?

585
00:52:21,121 --> 00:52:25,693
There are injuries
which only show up after a few days.

586
00:52:25,792 --> 00:52:29,949
With brain injuries, you can never rule out

587
00:52:30,049 --> 00:52:32,089
long-term implications.

588
00:52:32,385 --> 00:52:34,010
I'll show you some pictures.

589
00:52:54,496 --> 00:52:55,991
You're taking a long time.

590
00:52:57,089 --> 00:52:58,398
Sorry.

591
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:01,206
Well, I have plenty of time.

592
00:53:10,433 --> 00:53:11,448
Check!

593
00:53:24,448 --> 00:53:25,561
And what is this?

594
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,992
Dad brought it.

595
00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:30,910
It's for my exams.

596
00:53:43,873 --> 00:53:45,247
Vitus, what are you doing?

597
00:53:45,664 --> 00:53:46,908
This isn't our car.

598
00:53:48,481 --> 00:53:50,390
Come on.

599
00:54:20,513 --> 00:54:21,854
<i>The following, Mrs. von Holzen.</i>

600
00:54:22,048 --> 00:54:25,463
We have tested
his speaking and reading skills,

601
00:54:26,017 --> 00:54:28,831
his memory and his sense of perception.

602
00:54:29,024 --> 00:54:32,253
We got normal levels.

603
00:54:32,929 --> 00:54:34,816
What does "normal levels" mean?

604
00:54:35,328 --> 00:54:36,408
Please, take a seat.

605
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,684
Normal according to his age group.

606
00:54:39,105 --> 00:54:42,138
He's even slightly above average,

607
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:44,150
especially in his logical thinking.

608
00:54:45,313 --> 00:54:46,971
- And the IQ test?
- Yes?

609
00:54:47,072 --> 00:54:49,974
- Did you do...
- Yes, but, at the moment,

610
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,414
the test is irrelevant,

611
00:54:52,512 --> 00:54:55,643
but if you really want to know,
it's around 120.

612
00:54:57,568 --> 00:54:58,975
120?

613
00:54:59,873 --> 00:55:02,590
It used to be 180. How is that possible?

614
00:55:04,192 --> 00:55:05,240
I know.

615
00:55:07,008 --> 00:55:08,055
It's difficult to say.

616
00:55:09,984 --> 00:55:13,759
Even for specialists like us,
the brain remains a mystery.

617
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,060
There's no real explanation
for extraordinary abilities.

618
00:55:24,768 --> 00:55:27,070
If I can give you some advice,

619
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:31,838
give yourself and Vitus some time.
Time, time, time.

620
00:55:31,936 --> 00:55:34,391
He'll make some progress.

621
00:55:36,736 --> 00:55:38,427
You just want to cheer me up.

622
00:55:39,585 --> 00:55:40,599
Many thanks.

623
00:55:41,345 --> 00:55:43,548
I cannot understand your disappointment.

624
00:55:43,648 --> 00:55:46,463
After all, you have a healthy
and normal child.

625
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:49,594
I have to give
worse news to a lot of parents.

626
00:55:55,616 --> 00:55:57,274
Listen, everybody!

627
00:55:57,825 --> 00:55:59,134
Silence, please!

628
00:55:59,552 --> 00:56:01,407
Daniel, please!

629
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,822
This is your new schoolmate, Vitus.

630
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,662
He has changed schools,
and he's with us from now on.

631
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,175
Vitus, you can sit next to Jens.

632
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,043
Hi, Vitus, what's up?

633
00:56:22,144 --> 00:56:23,224
Hi, Jens.

634
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:28,248
Like this. Loosen up.

635
00:56:28,352 --> 00:56:29,977
Now make a fist.

636
00:56:30,752 --> 00:56:32,476
Yes, that's right. And again.

637
00:56:51,872 --> 00:56:55,614
Play the run, and take your time.

638
00:57:10,816 --> 00:57:13,500
"Es!" Doesn't it hurt your ears?

639
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,502
At least your fingers
should be able to remember.

640
00:57:17,409 --> 00:57:18,456
Sorry.

641
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,943
Music comes from the heart,
from your fingers, from your soul!

642
00:57:23,265 --> 00:57:25,403
All you hurt was your head.

643
00:57:29,025 --> 00:57:30,912
Sorry, Mom.

644
00:58:06,113 --> 00:58:07,967
Don't you feel lonely sometimes?

645
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:09,914
Yes, I do.

646
00:58:11,104 --> 00:58:13,406
Loneliness is the worst,

647
00:58:15,009 --> 00:58:19,165
but I'm doing something about it.

648
00:58:20,192 --> 00:58:22,843
- I write love letters.
- To whom?

649
00:58:25,856 --> 00:58:29,369
Up to now, I've only written to Annemarie,
but now I'm getting more generous.

650
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:31,447
I'm also writing to the beautiful woman

651
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,936
who sat opposite me in the train

652
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,829
and to the glistening lake,

653
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:40,799
to the lovely figure skater on TV

654
00:58:41,856 --> 00:58:45,020
and to the cool shade under the pear tree.

655
00:58:45,216 --> 00:58:47,191
- And then?
- And then?

656
00:59:08,161 --> 00:59:10,015
They fly beautifully.

657
00:59:11,136 --> 00:59:12,663
Fabulous.
