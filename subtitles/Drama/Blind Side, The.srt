01:26:36,001 --> 01:26:40,529
His ACT is low and I don't see it getting
any better if he retakes it. Right there.

1229
01:26:40,705 --> 01:26:41,967
Well, what's his GPA now?

1230
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:44,665
1.76.

1231
01:26:44,843 --> 01:26:47,107
That's not bad when you
consider where he started.

1232
01:26:47,279 --> 01:26:49,645
Well, he's gonna have to
make all A's this year.

1233
01:26:50,148 --> 01:26:53,743
I'm serious.
And that might not even be enough.

1234
01:26:53,919 --> 01:26:55,511
So he goes to a junior college.

1235
01:26:56,221 --> 01:26:59,122
Unh-uhn. Most inner-city kids that
go to JC drop out in the first year.

1236
01:26:59,291 --> 01:27:01,555
And his shot at the pros
would go out the window.

1237
01:27:01,726 --> 01:27:04,786
Pros? Are we even sure
he's gonna get college offers?

- No.

They're not gonna start recruiting

- He needs to do better in school.
- Obviously.

1254

But why the big push?

1255
01:28:01,665 --> 01:28:05,726
Well, he's in line for a football
scholarship if he gets his grades up.

1256
01:28:05,903 --> 01:28:09,066
- Is he considering Ole Miss?
- Better be.

Okay.

- I don't understand it.
- Yet.

You don't understand it yet.

It's full of knowledge.

1272

and shortcuts for figuring things out.

MICHAEL:
Courage is a hard thing to figure.

1462
01:40:17,934 --> 01:40:21,802
You can have courage based
on a dumb idea or a mistake...

1463
01:40:21,972 --> 01:40:24,270
...but you're not supposed to
question adults...

1464
01:40:24,441 --> 01:40:28,673
...or your coach or your teacher
because they make the rules.

1465
01:40:29,646 --> 01:40:33,343
Maybe they know best,
but maybe they don't.

1466
01:40:34,417 --> 01:40:38,444
It all depends on who you are,
where you come from.

I mean, valley of Death,
that's pretty salty stuff.

1470

That's why courage is tricky.

1471
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:56,537
Should you always do
what others tell you to do?

1472
01:40:57,174 --> 01:41:00,337
Sometimes you might not even know
why you're doing something.

1473
01:41:00,510 --> 01:41:03,206
I mean, any fool can have courage.

1474
01:41:04,014 --> 01:41:08,007
But honor, that's the real reason
you either do something or you don't.

1475
01:41:08,585 --> 01:41:11,520
It's who you are
and maybe who you want to be.

1476
01:41:12,923 --> 01:41:15,084
If you die trying for
something important...

1477
01:41:15,258 --> 01:41:19,718
...then you have both honor and
courage, and that's pretty good.

1478
01:41:20,297 --> 01:41:22,595
I think that's what the writer was saying.

1479
01:41:22,766 --> 01:41:26,600
That you should hope for courage
and try for honor.

telling you what to do have some too.

Hey.

1529
01:44:19,843 --> 01:44:21,743
The client wants what?

1530
01:44:22,679 --> 01:44:25,739
Were you aware that Coach Cotton
was accepting a job at Ole Miss?

1531
01:44:25,915 --> 01:44:26,939
No.

1532
01:44:27,117 --> 01:44:29,779
And that this job offer came
after you signed with them?

1533
01:44:31,021 --> 01:44:33,683
Sean Tuohy, your legal guardian,
went to Ole Miss.

1534
01:44:33,857 --> 01:44:34,881
He played basketball.

1535
01:44:35,492 --> 01:44:37,960
And Mrs. Tuohy went to Ole Miss
as well.

She was a cheerleader.

1537

Is it safe to say that Ole Miss
is their favorite school?

1538
01:44:42,365 --> 01:44:46,734

What about, say, Tennessee?

No, they can't stand Tennessee.

01:44:51,408 --> 01:44:53,638
- Miss Sue?
- Miss Sue.

1542
01:44:53,810 --> 01:44:56,745
Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad too.

1543
01:44:57,213 --> 01:45:00,046
Miss Sue ever try to persuade you
to attend Ole Miss?

1544
01:45:05,722 --> 01:45:09,055
Did you know that the Tuohys
make generous donations to Ole Miss?

1545
01:45:09,225 --> 01:45:11,887
That even Miss Sue makes donations?

1546
01:45:12,062 --> 01:45:14,189
That the Tuohys,
they have a condo in Oxford...

1547
01:45:14,364 --> 01:45:17,299
...so they can attend
as many athletic events as possible.

Tuohy are by our definition boosters.

- Think about what?!

The NCAA fears that
with your recruitment...

1563

...a door might be opened...

1564
01:46:21,798 --> 01:46:23,891
...that boosters from schools
in the South...

1565

...will become legal guardians
of young athletes without means...

case who would argue that the Tuohys...

1569
01:46:37,147 --> 01:46:39,479
...they took you in, they clothed you...
- No.

1570
01:46:39,649 --> 01:46:42,584
...they fed you, they paid for
your private education.

1571
01:46:42,752 --> 01:46:45,653
- They bought you a car, paid for a tutor...
- No. No.

1572
01:46:45,822 --> 01:46:50,816
...all as part of a plan to ensure that you
play football for the University of Mississippi.
