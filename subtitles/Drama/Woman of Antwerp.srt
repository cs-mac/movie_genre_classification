1
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,170
Dedée of Antwerp

2
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:20,795
Rita Hayworth! Hi, red.

3
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,471
- Hello honey, cigarette américaine?
- No, thank you.

4
00:02:23,593 --> 00:02:27,113
- A walk, miss?
- No walk, boys, no time.

5
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,941
- She's nice.
- Oh, let her go, she's in a hurry.

6
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:31,623
- So long, red.
- So long.

7
00:02:31,738 --> 00:02:32,768
You know her?

8
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:34,945
She's one of the broads
from Big Moon.

9
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:36,116
Expensive?

10
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,179
Expensive?
She'll cost you a week's salary!

11
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:40,405
Oh what a life!

12
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,700
Hey, Dedée! How's life?

13
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:05,358
I don't get your language.

14
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:08,611
- Can I come and see you tonight?
- If it makes you happy.

15
00:04:10,393 --> 00:04:12,213
Bon appetit, guys.

16
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:38,865
- Hello!
- Hello!

17
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,097
- Where are you coming from?
- A walk.

18
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,626
At this hour!

19
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,299
You'd better sleep.

20
00:04:44,392 --> 00:04:46,212
Else you'll ruin your complexion!

21
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:48,083
Here's your food.
I kept it warm.

22
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:50,283
No thanks,
I'll just have a bit of that.

23
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:52,542
If you don't eat, Dedée,
you'll lose weight.

24
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:54,893
- Where have you been?
- Walking, I told you.

25
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:56,499
- Where?
- Over there!

26
00:04:56,624 --> 00:04:58,554
Dedée, I'm asking where you were!

27
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,710
At the basin.

28
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,820
- What were you doing there?
- Walking, are you deaf?

29
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:04,989
A walk at the basin?
You kidding me?

30
00:05:05,077 --> 00:05:07,177
- Germaine, pass me...
- There's a lawn?

31
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:09,517
Germaine, when I talk to Dedée,
don't butt in.

32
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,603
Oh my, cheap pimps really scare me!

33
00:05:11,717 --> 00:05:13,987
- What did you say?
- I said cheap pimps!

34
00:05:14,112 --> 00:05:16,222
- Will you shut up?
- Enough!

35
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:21,283
Will you shut up?
I'd like to eat calmly.

36
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,679
You can sort out your stories
in your room.

37
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:26,685
Now that one's getting angry...

38
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:30,137
I bet he didn't get his seeds!

39
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:35,337
At least tell Dedée to be on time
for meals. We're not her slaves.

40
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:37,399
If she's late, it's my business.

41
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,560
And I don't care. See?

42
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,470
Take your authority somewhere else.

43
00:05:43,752 --> 00:05:44,762
Here.

44
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:48,674
Were there some boats?

45
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:51,759
Always the same ones. Those from the
Radoux and the old ones.

46
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,060
No arrivals?

47
00:05:53,244 --> 00:05:56,114
Yes, at the Rojerslass
a small cargo coming in.

48
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:58,933
A cargo? Did you see its name?

49
00:05:59,054 --> 00:06:01,594
I didn't pay attention.
You waiting for someone?

50
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:05,392
Maybe. Was there a big white X
on the chimney?

51
00:06:05,513 --> 00:06:07,433
I think so. Maybe.

52
00:06:08,547 --> 00:06:10,207
- Some more, anybody?
- No.

53
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:11,747
A little more.

54
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:13,657
Germaine, you'll get fat.

55
00:06:13,778 --> 00:06:15,358
Men love that.

56
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:18,486
You hear? Men love fat women in Antwerp.
Eat.

57
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:21,236
Maybe they love planks in your country,
but not here.

58
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:22,537
I don't understand.

59
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:25,039
Leave her alone, Marco,
and get some beer.

60
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:34,187
- Hello...
- Hello...

61
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:37,297
[Flem] Aren't you gonna eat? Are you sick?
I don't know.

62
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:39,344
[Flem] Aren't you going to eat?

63
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:41,369
[Flem] No, I don't want to.

64
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:45,011
- [Flem] What's wrong?
- Hangover.

65
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:46,907
Ah, now she's speaking French.

66
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:53,008
Who has a cigarette for me?

67
00:06:53,131 --> 00:06:54,791
- Here.
- Thanks.

68
00:06:55,752 --> 00:06:57,382
[Flem] [Antwerp dialect]

69
00:06:57,498 --> 00:06:59,848
Bring some up this afternoon,
there's none left.

70
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:01,826
[Flem] Give me a glass too.

71
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:04,119
You're right, it will
put you back together.

72
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:05,806
[Flem] Give me a glass.

73
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:08,924
[Flem] Germaine, who's making
that noise in your room?

74
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,429
- Oh, the negro!
- What negro?

75
00:07:11,549 --> 00:07:15,999
My negro, I forgot about him. He must
have fallen asleep when I came down.

76
00:07:16,116 --> 00:07:18,336
Germaine, I told you,
no one sleeps here.

77
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,378
A litte while, OK,
but not the night.

78
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:21,988
The poor fellow was tired.

79
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:23,594
He's very sweet, eh?

80
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:25,764
- Shall I go?
- Get him downstairs.

81
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:28,947
- Nice.
- We'll see about that.

82
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:31,011
Marco...

83
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:33,351
Be nice, OK?

84
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,799
Hurry up! Where do you think you are?

85
00:07:37,887 --> 00:07:40,437
- You're in a decent home.
- Where is the lady?

86
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:42,954
- Lady, lady she's eating!
- Her name is Germaine!

87
00:07:43,073 --> 00:07:47,013
Yes, the beautiful lady is
Germaine. You'll see her tonight.

88
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,140
No more lady, come for lady tonight.

89
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:52,375
- Tonight? I want to see her just now!
- Not now, tonight.

90
00:07:52,498 --> 00:07:55,188
- Tonight! - I want!
- The beautiful lady tonight!

91
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:59,999
I said nice, should I repeat it?

92
00:08:00,117 --> 00:08:02,727
- But that guy doesn't want it.
- Guy? My Freddy...

93
00:08:02,852 --> 00:08:04,012
Off you go.

94
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,625
Leave him alone, brute!

95
00:08:05,754 --> 00:08:09,144
He'll go away like a good little boy,
won't you?

96
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:10,331
Come on, Marco.

97
00:08:10,452 --> 00:08:12,372
They should be kicked out.

98
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:14,999
- Germaine.
- Yes, it's me.

99
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:16,537
Go away...

100
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:20,296
- Come see me tonight.
- We are going today to Hamburg.

101
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,860
Hamburg! What a pity!
We got along so well!

102
00:08:23,975 --> 00:08:27,255
I'm sad that you're going.

103
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:32,107
They all go to Hamburg. If this
goes on, no more ships will come here.

104
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:33,621
How will we eat?

105
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:35,277
Beautiful port, Hamburg...

106
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:38,577
[German] A pretty port and a big port...

107
00:08:38,673 --> 00:08:40,473
[German] with many pretty ladies.

108
00:08:40,763 --> 00:08:43,013
I cannot accept!

109
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:46,022
[Flem] I'm going back to bed.

110
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:48,554
- What did she say?
- Upstairs and sleep.

111
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:50,853
Good night.
You're right, that's the place.

112
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,670
Dedée, get my cigarettes
in my jacket.

113
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:04,344
Thank you darling,
you are a wonderful boy.

114
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:07,324
Have a nice trip, see you soon.

115
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:10,492
- Germaine...
- So long my darkie.

116
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:17,107
He's a very nice boy.

117
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:19,761
But I don't want him
to spend the night here, got it?

118
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:22,566
- I promise.
- He gave you his watch, let's see.

119
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,640
Don't sit down, we're going upstairs.

120
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,100
- We won't smoke a cigarette?
- We'll smoke it upstairs.

121
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,730
- Alright.
- Hurry up!

122
00:09:32,435 --> 00:09:34,295
He can't wait.

123
00:09:34,593 --> 00:09:37,183
Time to cuddle!

124
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,158
He needs it to digest.

125
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:42,385
Dedée... I'm waiting!

126
00:09:43,814 --> 00:09:44,884
Yes.

127
00:09:49,804 --> 00:09:51,154
Marco...

128
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,860
Go to Julien's and tell him to come.
I need to talk to him.

129
00:09:57,977 --> 00:10:01,327
- He won't be there now.
- Then look for him! It's urgent.

130
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:04,485
Alright.

131
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:07,441
Tell him to get a move on.

132
00:10:10,624 --> 00:10:12,774
- Thank you.
- It was a pleasure.

133
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:16,157
Come on girls!
Help Paul clear the table.

134
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,339
No need, I can do it alone.

135
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:21,711
They need to learn
how to be a housewife.

136
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:24,436
For when we get married!

137
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:28,146
It stinks.

138
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:30,277
It stinks? You think so,
at that price?

139
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:31,731
As if you paid for it!

140
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:34,329
- That's not a reason.
- [German] Smells like a rose.

141
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:35,655
You going into town?

142
00:10:35,754 --> 00:10:38,034
I'm having dinner
with the diamond merchant.

143
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:40,117
- You're lucky.
- That's easy to say.

144
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:42,822
Your marabou is still pretty nice!

145
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,325
It's not marabou, it's swan.

146
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:48,078
If you think of it,
bring back some lipstick.

147
00:10:48,202 --> 00:10:50,642
- "Young Girl No. 2"
- Tube or refill?

148
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,730
Refill, I got the tube.

149
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:54,665
- See you later.
- See you later.

150
00:10:55,248 --> 00:10:56,348
Bon appétit!

151
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:57,777
You're telling me!

152
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:02,471
Leaving?

153
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:04,886
- Yes, it's Monday.
- Oh... right.

154
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:07,522
- See you.
- See you, don't come back too late.

155
00:11:10,057 --> 00:11:12,427
- Is she yours?
- Yes, I brought her from France.

156
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,288
- French?
- Yes, from Toulon.

157
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,742
- Good. Are you happy with her?
- She's alright.

158
00:11:16,825 --> 00:11:19,425
- But she's hard-headed.
- The only way is to dent her.

159
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,740
That's what I do.

160
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:23,869
- Dough?
- Hang on til tomorrow.

161
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:26,033
I'll fix it. I'll see someone.

162
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:27,916
Alright, but hurry up.

163
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,411
If you don't take it,
it's easy to get rid of.

164
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:31,869
Tomorrow I'll have it.

165
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:33,322
OK, see you tomorrow.

166
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:34,836
2.30 pm at Karel's.

167
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,580
- Bye.
- Bye.

168
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:54,957
Come in.

169
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:01,313
Sit down. You took your time.
Did you see Julien?

170
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:03,455
He wasn't there, I left the message.

171
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,700
Alright.

172
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:07,367
What do you want?

173
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:09,405
I'd like to talk to you about a deal.

174
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:10,934
I'm listening.

175
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:17,505
At Julien's, I met a friend from France.

176
00:12:17,627 --> 00:12:20,117
Actually Germany...
but the French area.

177
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:22,126
Complicated story. So?

178
00:12:22,253 --> 00:12:24,443
- He brought back some goods.
- I'm full.

179
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:26,135
- It's not a woman.
- Ah?

180
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:28,286
- It's...
- It's?

181
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:30,679
- It's...
- Look at that.

182
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:33,501
He has a lot of it and cheap...

183
00:12:33,593 --> 00:12:35,893
- Did you get the gin?
- Huh?

184
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:38,541
I said, did you take care of the gin?

185
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:41,175
- No, not yet.
- I told you yesterday.

186
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,940
You have to do your job, man.

187
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,958
- You hear me?
- Careful with that.

188
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,350
You're right, it fires easily.
Very easily... the catch is sanded.

189
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:49,864
And it's silent.

190
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,553
Come on! I'm just kidding.

191
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:56,173
You've done nothing wrong, eh?
Anyway it's not loaded.

192
00:12:56,457 --> 00:12:58,637
Looks like I'm scaring you. I am!

193
00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:01,693
Looks like I'm always scaring you.

194
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,486
Funny, you don't like kidding.

195
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:07,607
Look, it's light.

196
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:09,156
Take it.

197
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:13,051
- It's a great weapon.
- Yes, a great weapon.

198
00:13:13,486 --> 00:13:16,046
- One feels strong holding it, eh?
- Yes.

199
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,760
With it you feel like a man.
Better than fists, right?

200
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:22,366
And it looks good.
Look in the mirror.

201
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:26,365
- You almost look like a tough guy.
- Why are you saying this?

202
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:29,288
Joking... you like to play
the bad guy in front of mirrors.

203
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:32,471
But you should close the door.
It's ridiculous to see you.

204
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:36,482
I saw you the other day
with your little gun, striking a pose.

205
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:39,433
You were so funny, you have no idea.

206
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:43,184
I forgive you.
It doesn't matter, I know you.

207
00:13:43,298 --> 00:13:44,908
But suppose Dedée saw you.

208
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,650
Dedée... Picture the downfall
of your prestige!

209
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:50,757
- Don't make fun of me.
- I'm not, I'm speaking as a friend.

210
00:13:50,884 --> 00:13:54,974
But be careful, always
close your door. Always.

211
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,885
Give it back, you've played enough.

212
00:14:00,363 --> 00:14:01,653
Listen to me.

213
00:14:01,736 --> 00:14:03,826
Your little traffic
is not my business.

214
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:06,141
Outside the club,
do whatever you want.

215
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:10,049
But if one gram
of your shit gets in here,

216
00:14:10,174 --> 00:14:12,604
I'll kick you out like scum.
And I won't miss you.

217
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:14,737
I can find plenty of porters like you.

218
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:17,111
I keep you here
in order to keep Dedée,

219
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:19,886
but I wouldn't think twice.
If she follows you, too bad.

220
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,854
- Got it?
- Yes, got it.

221
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,852
Well, you're very smart...

222
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:37,091
I have a beautiful little Dedée
in my car.

223
00:14:38,148 --> 00:14:39,828
What is it?

224
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,445
Nothing, it's a fight.

225
00:14:45,621 --> 00:14:46,881
Are you afraid?

226
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:49,476
There might be people
who know me.

227
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:51,546
You don't want to be seen with me?

228
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,710
Me? People talk.

229
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,920
That happens when you're not serious.

230
00:14:56,044 --> 00:14:58,514
He has a guilty conscience,
the little one.

231
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:02,335
Wait... they're getting closer.

232
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:03,625
What's that?

233
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:05,786
- Go away, quick!
- OK, sweetheart!

234
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,865
- Hurry up, go!
- One second!

235
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,129
I don't even have time to get out.

236
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:11,659
That's clever... Hey!

237
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:14,941
- I think you forgot something.
- What?

238
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:17,544
Yes, wait.

239
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:22,319
It was good, huh?

240
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:25,045
Great...
Nobody ever did that to me before.

241
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,036
Monday, same time.

242
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:34,002
Go back to your wife, bastard!

243
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,730
You OK?

244
00:16:39,218 --> 00:16:40,258
You scared?

245
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:43,336
I like to see men fight.
They never hurt themselves enough.

246
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,386
You don't like them?

247
00:16:45,507 --> 00:16:48,817
No... or I love them too much,
it's the same thing.

248
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:56,834
Was it you I saw arriving this morning?

249
00:16:56,947 --> 00:17:00,387
- Yes... Why?
- Oh... nothing.

250
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,940
They're beating them up...

251
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,477
Even worse than last time.

252
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,000
I wouldn't have missed it
for a million.

253
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,380
Cops.

254
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:23,017
You really want to see them?

255
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:25,716
- Not especially.
- Me neither... let's go.

256
00:17:25,908 --> 00:17:26,968
This way!

257
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:29,494
- You don't seem to like them.
- Not much.

258
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,820
Where are we going?

259
00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:32,796
- Walk, don't fuss.
- I am!

260
00:17:32,924 --> 00:17:34,584
I don't have time to lose.

261
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,680
- What are you doing?
- What I'm doing.

262
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:58,997
During the day and evening?
This is no place to walk alone.

263
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:02,538
I sell candles in the cathedral,
can't you tell?

264
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:06,335
I was on my way there when we met...
Night service.

265
00:18:06,782 --> 00:18:08,622
And what are you doing
around here?

266
00:18:08,744 --> 00:18:10,054
I was visiting.

267
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:12,821
- Tourist, huh?
- That's it, tourist...

268
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:15,045
That's what I thought.

269
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:55,667
- Say...
- Yes?

270
00:18:55,763 --> 00:18:58,053
Don't you think
that's enough walking?

271
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,373
- Tired?
- No, someone's waiting.

272
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:03,419
- Who?
- My fiancé.

273
00:19:03,537 --> 00:19:06,037
- What's his name?
- I don't know yet.

274
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:09,884
- I know.
- Really? So tell me.

275
00:19:10,003 --> 00:19:12,023
It will save me searching.

276
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:14,058
His name is Francesco.

277
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,475
- Italian?
- Yes, can't you hear it?

278
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:21,047
Ah, that's it.

279
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:23,581
I was wondering about your accent.

280
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:26,661
No kidding, I must go back.

281
00:19:26,775 --> 00:19:29,165
- Why?
- "Perché" someone's waiting, I told you.

282
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,913
- Another fiancé?
- No, the boss, and I'm late,

283
00:19:33,395 --> 00:19:34,875
What club do you work in?

284
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:37,361
The Big Moon.
Do you know the Big Moon?

285
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,517
A little.

286
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,646
- I'm off. The cops are gone.
- Wait.

287
00:19:40,736 --> 00:19:43,136
- I don't have time.
- I said wait.

288
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:45,661
Let go, you're hurting me.

289
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:47,779
And if I pay for the walk?

290
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,966
If I pay for the walk, can you wait?

291
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,890
If it's work, that's different.

292
00:19:58,021 --> 00:19:59,861
Is it enough?

293
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:03,379
- It's not enough?
- Yes, it's alright.

294
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:09,807
For that price, can I sit down?

295
00:20:18,873 --> 00:20:21,603
- You hurt me.
- You should have obeyed.

296
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:26,654
- This is a man's watch?
- You can see that.

297
00:20:30,197 --> 00:20:31,927
What's your name?

298
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:33,193
Dedée.

299
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,700
- You're Belgian?
- No, I'm not from here.

300
00:20:35,927 --> 00:20:37,577
And do you like it here?

301
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:40,134
If I didn't, I'd leave.

302
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,460
Sure... in life
we always do what we want.

303
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:46,209
Don't ask questions.

304
00:20:47,177 --> 00:20:48,647
You got a cigarette?

305
00:21:28,437 --> 00:21:32,177
Look at the clouds, they move fast!

306
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:37,172
Lie down, you'll see them better.

307
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:42,558
Lie down near me, there's room.

308
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,893
You don't want to?

309
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:50,955
OK... as you like.

310
00:22:11,274 --> 00:22:13,504
The sky must be beautiful in Italy.

311
00:22:17,612 --> 00:22:19,992
- Where do you come from?
- From Napoli.

312
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:23,119
- That's where Vesuvius is?
- Yes, it's there.

313
00:22:23,786 --> 00:22:25,076
Is Vesuvius big?

314
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,380
Is it big?

315
00:22:34,382 --> 00:22:36,702
OK, don't answer if you don't want to.

316
00:22:39,563 --> 00:22:43,093
- Another cigarette?
- No, not right now.

317
00:22:54,351 --> 00:22:57,391
Hey, have you decided?

318
00:22:57,513 --> 00:22:58,903
Decided?

319
00:22:59,471 --> 00:23:03,441
Yeah, are you waiting for the rain?

320
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:05,566
No, I'm waiting for 2 AM.

321
00:23:05,691 --> 00:23:07,151
You're waiting for what?

322
00:23:07,273 --> 00:23:09,623
I'm waiting for 2 AM.
I have to see someone.

323
00:23:09,714 --> 00:23:12,274
You brought me here to wait for 2 AM?

324
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:14,448
Yeah, what did you think?

325
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:22,779
OK, we'll wait.

326
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,145
Give me the cigarette.

327
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,962
By the way, it's time.

328
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:02,454
You sure you're not early?
We could wait a little longer.

329
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:14,668
In Naples, do you watch the moon
as brother and sister?

330
00:24:14,793 --> 00:24:15,973
Sometimes.

331
00:24:16,094 --> 00:24:19,524
Here we don't. Too many clouds,
you can't see the moon.

332
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:23,483
You don't need my company
if it's out of your way.

333
00:24:23,604 --> 00:24:24,974
I know the way.

334
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,519
As you like.

335
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:32,662
Goodbye, Dedée.

336
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:36,271
You played a joke on me, huh?

337
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,530
You think so?

338
00:24:38,692 --> 00:24:39,862
I don't know.

339
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:46,352
Tonight I just wanted
to hear a woman.

340
00:24:46,472 --> 00:24:48,332
It happens, doesn't it?

341
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:49,537
I don't know.

342
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:53,569
You didn't lose anything,
for you it's the same.

343
00:24:54,486 --> 00:24:57,126
Yes, it's the same.

344
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:00,459
Funny, eh?

345
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:04,151
Usually I have to fight not to...

346
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,180
For once, it's just my luck...

347
00:25:19,361 --> 00:25:22,521
Why did you smile at me when you
entered the basin this morning?

348
00:25:22,638 --> 00:25:25,448
I don't know...
because you were beautiful.

349
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:27,962
Come on, go now.

350
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,700
- Good night.
- Buona notte.

351
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:37,362
Dedée?

352
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,945
Can you say something to René for me?

353
00:25:43,065 --> 00:25:44,465
Do you know Mr. René?

354
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:47,966
Yes, tell him that Francesco,
it's me...

355
00:25:48,092 --> 00:25:49,602
will you remember my name?

356
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,465
Francesco. Yes.

357
00:25:52,358 --> 00:25:54,438
Tell him Francesco can't come tonight,

358
00:25:54,557 --> 00:25:56,787
or tomorrow,
because he goes to Ostend,

359
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,280
but tomorrow night
he'll come to the Big Moon.

360
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:03,745
Tomorrow night at the Big Moon... OK.

361
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:05,455
You won't forget?

362
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:07,486
I don't think I will.

363
00:26:07,898 --> 00:26:10,708
- Goodbye, Dedée...
- Goodbye.

364
00:26:59,838 --> 00:27:02,478
You're just coming back?
We've been waiting for hours.

365
00:27:02,602 --> 00:27:04,872
Don't tell me the old guy
kept you so long!

366
00:27:04,963 --> 00:27:07,433
- No, I won't say that.
- Where are you coming from?

367
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,630
- Always the same song.
- Is this a song?

368
00:27:09,718 --> 00:27:11,308
Tame her, Marco. That's it.

369
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,139
Go now, you've hung out enough.

370
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,010
Wait a minute.

371
00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:21,049
You've got nothing for me?

372
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,143
But there's more than usual...

373
00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:28,744
That's for the delay.

374
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:31,937
Sentimental walk.

375
00:27:32,055 --> 00:27:35,195
- You deserve a kiss.
- No hurry.

376
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,677
Come here Dedée, come.

377
00:27:49,298 --> 00:27:51,798
You're late.
Did you have trouble with the fight?

378
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,319
No, I was kept back.

379
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:56,439
- What's that?
- Nothing, I bumped into something.

380
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,100
Into Marco's hand?

381
00:27:58,223 --> 00:27:59,443
Dedée, come here?

382
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:01,528
- Someone's calling you.
- Right away!

383
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:04,519
I have a message for you,
from a guy named Francesco.

384
00:28:04,644 --> 00:28:06,734
Did you see Francesco? Where?

385
00:28:06,953 --> 00:28:08,703
We met during the fight.

386
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:11,061
- What do you want?
- To dance with this girl.

387
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,350
- Come on baby.
- She is coming in a minute.

388
00:28:13,436 --> 00:28:15,536
Go and get yourself a drink.

389
00:28:15,834 --> 00:28:18,004
Don't forget, baby, don't forget.

390
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,013
So?

391
00:28:20,424 --> 00:28:23,374
He can't come tonight or tomorrow
because he'll be in Ostend,

392
00:28:23,486 --> 00:28:25,186
but he'll come tomorrow night.

393
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,100
It's funny, I saw his boat
arriving this morning.

394
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,014
Remember I told you?

395
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:32,536
I don't remember.

396
00:28:32,655 --> 00:28:35,585
Hey girl! I'm alone.

397
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,653
Yes, yes, wait a minute.

398
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:40,093
I'm coming.

399
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,428
René, who is Francesco?

400
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:50,068
A sailor. An old friend of mine.
He's Italian.

401
00:28:50,158 --> 00:28:51,298
Yes, I know...

402
00:28:51,424 --> 00:28:54,544
Well, you know enough.
Come on, make the sailor dance.

403
00:28:58,941 --> 00:29:00,741
Did you met him in the Congo?

404
00:29:00,856 --> 00:29:03,426
Yes, the Congo and other places.

405
00:29:03,551 --> 00:29:05,651
Go, or he'll fall asleep.

406
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:16,759
Hello... sleepy?

407
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:21,741
No, I'm not sleepy.
Come on, let's dance!

408
00:29:26,555 --> 00:29:29,815
Julien, that was Francesco's boat
she saw entering.

409
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:31,766
- Some news?
- She just saw him.

410
00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:34,659
He'll be here tomorrow. We
have to gather things quick.

411
00:29:34,746 --> 00:29:35,806
For where?

412
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:39,669
Spain, Palestine, South America... You
never know with him... He'll tell us.

413
00:29:45,069 --> 00:29:47,719
You're here! I was afraid
the cops picked you up.

414
00:29:47,844 --> 00:29:49,664
- Hello!
- Hello!

415
00:29:49,777 --> 00:29:51,697
You look happy!

416
00:29:51,817 --> 00:29:54,047
Yes, that happens!

417
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,410
- Mr. René?
- Yes.

418
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:01,991
Give me a glass of water, please.

419
00:30:04,795 --> 00:30:06,185
Here, girl.

420
00:30:06,697 --> 00:30:09,287
Will they go away soon,
so we can turn in?

421
00:30:09,414 --> 00:30:11,514
Here, they're paying.

422
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,930
- Good night. Good night, chief.
- Goodbye, gentlemen.

423
00:30:24,981 --> 00:30:26,941
One more behind us.

424
00:30:27,736 --> 00:30:29,356
I'll have some fresh air.

425
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:30,669
Me too.

426
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:32,551
Good night, gentlemen.

427
00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:36,863
- Can we close?
- Go ahead, turn off the sign.

428
00:30:39,896 --> 00:30:41,986
It's good!

429
00:30:42,678 --> 00:30:44,118
Some air.

430
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:46,863
The weather will be fine.
The wind is from the river.

431
00:30:46,976 --> 00:30:49,186
What's up with you, you're strange?

432
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,765
No, nothing.

433
00:30:50,887 --> 00:30:52,397
Hey, the dockers.

434
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:01,958
- It must be about 7 AM.
- Come on girls, we're closing.

435
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:29,479
- Aren't you coming to bed?
- Yes, soon.

436
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:32,527
- Haven't you got enough air?
- I have a headache.

437
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,170
You always hurt somewhere.

438
00:31:34,287 --> 00:31:37,427
Shut the window and come to bed,
I'm tired.

439
00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:39,651
I'm not stopping you from sleeping.

440
00:31:40,813 --> 00:31:44,283
Close the window and come here!
I need to talk to you.

441
00:32:13,896 --> 00:32:16,286
So, we're no longer in love?

442
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:20,339
We're home now.
Come on, kiss me.

443
00:32:23,214 --> 00:32:24,854
Better than that.

444
00:32:26,092 --> 00:32:27,852
Tell me if I disgust you.

445
00:32:28,298 --> 00:32:30,778
Don't be stupid,
I've told you I have a headache.

446
00:32:31,739 --> 00:32:33,579
Enough for now.

447
00:32:46,576 --> 00:32:49,316
Talk to Mr. René. I need money.

448
00:32:51,944 --> 00:32:53,674
He refused, the bastard.

449
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:55,459
It won't be different with me.

450
00:32:55,578 --> 00:32:57,758
You tell him
it's for you, an advance.

451
00:32:57,879 --> 00:33:00,039
It's true, an advance,
you'll give it back.

452
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:02,122
I still owe him for the other time.

453
00:33:02,243 --> 00:33:04,263
He'll be happy
to give it to you.

454
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:06,691
For his little Dedée,
what wouldn't he do?

455
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,490
He likes his little Dedée.
Ask him nicely.

456
00:33:09,917 --> 00:33:12,177
That won't be too difficult,
you like him too.

457
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:14,618
- It's not true.
- Do you think I'm a sucker?

458
00:33:14,737 --> 00:33:17,447
Not my business, he's
the boss, don't upset him.

459
00:33:17,535 --> 00:33:18,905
Don't say that!

460
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,801
Don't shout, you'll wake everyone.

461
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,335
What's wrong with you,
are you getting crazy?

462
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:25,641
Don't say that, it disgusts me.

463
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:28,809
I won't say it again.
So you'll ask him.

464
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,919
- No, I can't.
- You will!

465
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:37,141
He won't accept.

466
00:33:39,013 --> 00:33:40,893
No, Marco, don't do that!

467
00:33:41,014 --> 00:33:43,784
- Will you ask him?
- You'll leave marks again.

468
00:33:44,212 --> 00:33:47,702
- Yes... I'll ask him.
- Will you obey?

469
00:33:48,748 --> 00:33:49,828
Yes.

470
00:33:50,797 --> 00:33:51,997
At last!

471
00:33:53,693 --> 00:33:56,113
You'll ask him for 100,000.

472
00:34:02,596 --> 00:34:04,986
And I'll give you half
when my deal is done.

473
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,690
For the rest of it, you'll manage.

474
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:10,851
It's too much, Marco. I can't.

475
00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:13,699
You just have to work.

476
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:16,611
It's nice to make customers drink,
but it's not enough.

477
00:34:16,726 --> 00:34:20,476
You have to do like the others.
Look at Germaine, she never stops.

478
00:34:20,597 --> 00:34:22,627
Enough. Enough about business.

479
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:25,661
You're a good girl.

480
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,240
You're a bit hard-headed,
but you're a good girl.

481
00:34:29,604 --> 00:34:31,644
OK, you'll sort things out.

482
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:35,891
It's for your own good
that I'm tough.

483
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:37,816
What would you do without me?

484
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,469
Dedée, what would you do
without your Marco?

485
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,573
Come on, kiss me!

486
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:45,435
Come on, kiss me!

487
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,120
Dédée, did you talk to Mr. René?

488
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,161
- Yes and he doesn't want it.
- Why?

489
00:35:20,282 --> 00:35:21,872
He knew it wasn't for me,

490
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:23,725
and said he couldn't lend so much.

491
00:35:23,815 --> 00:35:26,225
- When did you see him?
- Right now, after dinner.

492
00:35:26,347 --> 00:35:28,447
- In his office?
- Yes, in his office.

493
00:35:28,535 --> 00:35:31,245
You bitch, he wasn't there
after dinner. He just returned.

494
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:32,931
- Don't let him!
- Shut up!

495
00:35:33,024 --> 00:35:35,344
You didn't ask him anything?
Answer me!

496
00:35:35,464 --> 00:35:37,584
No, I didn't, and I won't.

497
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,362
Here you go again.

498
00:35:40,745 --> 00:35:42,935
- You know the price.
- Leave her alone.

499
00:35:43,028 --> 00:35:45,008
If someone came in,
how would it look!

500
00:35:45,095 --> 00:35:47,485
- You'll do it tonight, you hear?
- Sir!

501
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,644
If you don't,
you'll see what I can do.

502
00:35:49,726 --> 00:35:51,926
- Sir!
- What's going on?

503
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,080
Shall I ask him now?

504
00:35:54,204 --> 00:35:58,024
You again? I already told you
I don't want any fuss in here.

505
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,980
Leave her alone, understand?

506
00:36:00,817 --> 00:36:02,297
- What is it?
- Nothing.

507
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:04,178
We had words, eh, Dedée?

508
00:36:04,302 --> 00:36:06,662
You're supposed
to be at the door now.

509
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,200
- Did you forget it?
- I was on my way.

510
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:12,739
What did he want?

511
00:36:13,313 --> 00:36:15,093
Always the same stories.

512
00:36:15,212 --> 00:36:18,372
When he gets nervous, tell me.
I know how to calm him.

513
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:24,325
I'm sick of it.

514
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:26,113
My dear, when you have a man,

515
00:36:26,202 --> 00:36:28,622
beautiful or ugly,
you always catch hell.

516
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,850
Do like me, work for yourself.

517
00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:33,586
It's too late now.

518
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:35,255
Felice also had a man.

519
00:36:35,545 --> 00:36:39,745
She sorted it out, he's caged
for 20 years, now she's at peace.

520
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,310
Here you are at last.

521
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:45,318
In the house, you're the only one
not to have customers.

522
00:36:45,444 --> 00:36:47,324
It's not like you have to be here.

523
00:36:47,979 --> 00:36:50,099
A single woman can live.

524
00:36:52,317 --> 00:36:54,077
What are you looking at?

525
00:36:54,865 --> 00:36:56,655
Ah, but I know that one.

526
00:36:56,909 --> 00:36:58,909
Before the war he used to come here.

527
00:36:59,532 --> 00:37:02,572
If I were you, I'd kick
Marco out straight away.

528
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:06,751
I'm more experienced,
I'm talking to you like a mother.

529
00:37:06,939 --> 00:37:09,449
Fred, take care of the bar.

530
00:37:09,765 --> 00:37:10,915
Yes, sir.

531
00:37:13,557 --> 00:37:15,937
- I think you've already met?
- Yes.

532
00:37:16,169 --> 00:37:17,749
I'll see you later.

533
00:37:19,121 --> 00:37:20,581
You keep secrets from me.

534
00:37:20,698 --> 00:37:22,478
Good evening, gentlemen.

535
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:25,397
Off to work!

536
00:37:29,424 --> 00:37:32,674
Get down here, people are coming.

537
00:37:34,259 --> 00:37:37,249
Authorization, registration,
all in order, all true.

538
00:37:38,262 --> 00:37:40,082
You start sailing under protection?

539
00:37:40,196 --> 00:37:42,556
In the Mediterranean,
they are all patrolling.

540
00:37:42,997 --> 00:37:46,387
We are no longer in '36, it's over.

541
00:37:46,507 --> 00:37:48,027
Now it's cruising.

542
00:37:48,311 --> 00:37:50,461
How much did you pay
for your small images?

543
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,930
A pittance.

544
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:55,246
Since the war, we don't buy people.
It's charity now.

545
00:37:55,365 --> 00:37:57,875
They're all for sale,
you just buy the cheapest.

546
00:37:58,004 --> 00:37:59,474
Nothing unnecessary.

547
00:37:59,586 --> 00:38:01,676
- You're almost official.
- Almost.

548
00:38:01,797 --> 00:38:03,987
Coal. We sell coal.

549
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:07,713
The only risk is a raid
at loading or delivery.

550
00:38:08,392 --> 00:38:12,092
It felt strange to get your letter.
I thought you were dead.

551
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:15,053
Several times, it was close.

552
00:38:17,883 --> 00:38:19,703
What about the club?

553
00:38:22,146 --> 00:38:26,756
Alright, thanks to Dedée.
But if a man came along, a real one,

554
00:38:27,893 --> 00:38:30,143
who'd take her away,

555
00:38:30,411 --> 00:38:33,331
though I like her
and she makes a lot of money,

556
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:35,439
if she came and told me:

557
00:38:35,555 --> 00:38:41,165
"Mr. René, I met someone," but a good
man, not a little louse like Marco,

558
00:38:42,248 --> 00:38:44,278
I'd be the first
to tell her to leave.

559
00:38:45,998 --> 00:38:49,678
And if she hesitated, I'd kick
her out to make her go faster.

560
00:38:52,154 --> 00:38:54,274
Why are you telling me all this?

561
00:38:57,093 --> 00:38:58,363
Nothing...

562
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:03,218
René, you're doing funny jobs
in your old age.

563
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:08,211
Don't waste your time. Dedée won't
tie me up, even if you interfere.

564
00:39:09,176 --> 00:39:10,936
I'm turning senile with that girl.

565
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:13,009
Won't you see her?

566
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,590
I said I'd go. I can't do otherwise.

567
00:39:15,707 --> 00:39:18,397
Sure. Always be polite to ladies.

568
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,430
You spent a long time with Mr. René.

569
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,819
We hadn't seen each other
in six years. We had a lot to say.

570
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,800
I gave him your message last night.

571
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:54,275
I know, he told me.
Nice of you to think of it.

572
00:39:54,372 --> 00:39:56,892
There are some things we remember.

573
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:01,039
You hold me the wrong way.

574
00:40:03,242 --> 00:40:04,782
Yes, like that.

575
00:40:06,356 --> 00:40:08,766
- Not better?
- Yes, much better.

576
00:40:08,888 --> 00:40:10,678
You dance well.

577
00:40:11,354 --> 00:40:12,594
No sweet-talk.

578
00:40:15,506 --> 00:40:16,796
You smell good.

579
00:40:17,507 --> 00:40:19,457
You smell of tobacco.

580
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:22,669
Already?

581
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,430
Wait, it'll start again.

582
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:37,419
- You don't talk more than this?
- Sometimes.

583
00:40:57,707 --> 00:41:00,027
It's a bit crowded here,
don't you think?

584
00:41:02,575 --> 00:41:04,805
Are you suggesting another walk?

585
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:05,974
No.

586
00:41:09,857 --> 00:41:12,047
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

587
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:16,526
- No, somewhere else.
- I prefer that.

588
00:41:16,647 --> 00:41:17,897
Let's go.

589
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,548
He won't say anything.

590
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,720
Where are you going? Oh, sorry!
Good evening, sir!

591
00:41:46,591 --> 00:41:49,441
- Is it far?
- It's on the dock.

592
00:41:57,978 --> 00:41:59,408
Let's walk faster.

593
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:02,272
- What's wrong?
- I don't like to come here.

594
00:42:06,087 --> 00:42:09,237
- Is it because of them?
- Yes, it scares me for the future.

595
00:42:09,897 --> 00:42:10,957
Come.

596
00:42:17,437 --> 00:42:18,967
It's here.

597
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,840
Are you sleeping?

598
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:09,141
I didn't think
that I could feel so good.

599
00:43:11,482 --> 00:43:12,912
Is it daytime?

600
00:43:13,034 --> 00:43:14,164
I think so.

601
00:43:15,435 --> 00:43:16,595
Don't move.

602
00:43:20,046 --> 00:43:21,886
[Ital] I'm falling, Dedée.

603
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,675
[Ital] I'm falling like a little boy.

604
00:43:25,075 --> 00:43:26,675
[Ital] I am like you.

605
00:43:27,046 --> 00:43:29,466
[Ital] I didn't think it could happen.

606
00:43:31,089 --> 00:43:32,209
It's nice.

607
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:34,588
What did you just say?

608
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:38,056
It's not your concern. It's for me.

609
00:43:41,364 --> 00:43:43,064
Speak again.

610
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:44,859
What do you want me to say?

611
00:43:45,203 --> 00:43:46,753
I don't know...

612
00:43:46,865 --> 00:43:48,135
Things.

613
00:43:49,785 --> 00:43:50,825
Things.

614
00:43:51,972 --> 00:43:54,182
[Ital] It's dangerous to say things.

615
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:56,625
[Ital] Especially what I want to say.

616
00:43:57,174 --> 00:44:00,214
[Ital] And what I want to say
is what you want to hear.

617
00:44:01,427 --> 00:44:04,167
[Ital] I won't tell it to you,
but I'll think it.

618
00:44:04,635 --> 00:44:06,745
[Ital] That's what scares me,

619
00:44:06,866 --> 00:44:09,006
[Ital] that you know
what I'm thinking.

620
00:44:13,163 --> 00:44:16,233
[Ital] Do you understand?
[French] Understood?

621
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,160
No. It should be true.

622
00:44:39,634 --> 00:44:41,604
The other night, in the harbour,

623
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,591
I really wanted it to be like that.

624
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:47,528
I would have liked that also,
but not there, not in that way.

625
00:44:49,256 --> 00:44:50,646
Do you have regrets?

626
00:44:51,753 --> 00:44:52,793
No.

627
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:03,185
You're sweet.

628
00:45:05,462 --> 00:45:07,662
[Ital] You are too sweet.

629
00:45:09,014 --> 00:45:10,114
Francesco.

630
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,930
Huh?

631
00:45:12,054 --> 00:45:14,204
Nothing, I'm saying your name.

632
00:45:15,678 --> 00:45:19,598
Francesco. I love your name.

633
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,810
I'd like everything to stop,

634
00:45:30,076 --> 00:45:32,146
so we could stay like this forever.

635
00:45:32,989 --> 00:45:36,409
There would be no more outside.
Nothing but us.

636
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:45,220
I didn't imagine it could be possible.

637
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:53,036
What are you thinking of?

638
00:45:54,776 --> 00:45:56,116
Do you want to know?

639
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:00,309
Yes.

640
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:03,739
Then you'll be happy.

641
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:07,180
I don't know what will happen
tomorrow, or a moment from now,

642
00:46:07,304 --> 00:46:09,424
but this night I think that l...

643
00:46:11,507 --> 00:46:13,047
I can't say those words.

644
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:15,771
It doesn't matter.

645
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:18,753
I understood.

646
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:42,117
Cold?

647
00:46:42,395 --> 00:46:44,965
- A little, yes.
- The wind is shifting.

648
00:46:56,557 --> 00:46:58,107
It smells of you.

649
00:47:05,715 --> 00:47:07,145
I saw you arriving there.

650
00:47:07,272 --> 00:47:09,292
What were you doing here at that hour?

651
00:47:09,405 --> 00:47:11,265
I was watching the old harbour.

652
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,516
That's what they asked me
when I came back.

653
00:47:22,498 --> 00:47:25,568
Because I always have to go back.
I almost forgot.

654
00:47:43,797 --> 00:47:46,147
What if you stayed with me today?

655
00:47:47,515 --> 00:47:49,545
It's not possible.

656
00:47:56,566 --> 00:47:58,756
Stay. I'll fix it with René.

657
00:47:59,316 --> 00:48:00,946
It's not Mr. René.

658
00:48:01,424 --> 00:48:03,384
- It's someone else.
- Ah, yes.

659
00:48:04,322 --> 00:48:05,372
You know?

660
00:48:05,485 --> 00:48:09,025
René told me about him.
I'll fix it with him another way.

661
00:48:09,305 --> 00:48:10,315
No.

662
00:48:17,717 --> 00:48:19,097
Do you love him?

663
00:48:19,925 --> 00:48:22,045
Don't use that word to describe it.

664
00:48:22,988 --> 00:48:25,408
No, you don't know what it is,
he scares me.

665
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:30,170
He scares me, do you understand?
That's why I have to go back.

666
00:48:31,003 --> 00:48:34,333
Stay, I told you I'll sort it out.
He doesn't scare me.

667
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:36,619
Yes, but in a few days
you'll be gone.

668
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,390
I'll still be there
and it will go on.

669
00:48:40,142 --> 00:48:42,192
That's not for me.

670
00:48:45,081 --> 00:48:46,851
Come tonight, if you want.

671
00:48:47,942 --> 00:48:49,352
Look at me.

672
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,320
Was it true earlier in the room?

673
00:48:52,576 --> 00:48:55,016
- Are you asking me?
- It was also true for me.

674
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,750
So you think I can leave you
with that bastard?

675
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:59,809
And now I'm here, you hear?

676
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:02,855
I must go back this morning.

677
00:49:03,843 --> 00:49:05,403
If you think that's better.

678
00:49:05,523 --> 00:49:07,593
Tonight I'll come and we'll see.

679
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,920
Will he ask where you were?

680
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,920
He saw us leaving.

681
00:49:14,648 --> 00:49:16,638
At night he is the gatekeeper.

682
00:49:17,086 --> 00:49:19,016
What a life to have a job here.

683
00:49:19,507 --> 00:49:21,217
Here, that will keep him silent.

684
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,452
Thank you.

685
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:26,279
Was that the reason
on the first night?

686
00:49:29,355 --> 00:49:31,465
Don't cry... It will stop.

687
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,970
Take your jacket.

688
00:49:46,711 --> 00:49:47,911
I'll keep it.

689
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,614
- See you tonight?
- Tonight.

690
00:49:56,684 --> 00:49:58,324
Francesco!

691
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,970
Kiss me.

692
00:51:22,903 --> 00:51:24,963
- Ha, what is it?
- Dedée.

693
00:51:25,611 --> 00:51:27,851
I was afraid you wouldn't be alone.

694
00:51:28,106 --> 00:51:30,086
- Can I sleep here?
- No.

695
00:51:30,495 --> 00:51:32,675
Some trouble with Marco?

696
00:51:32,802 --> 00:51:35,022
I'll tell you. Sleep.

697
00:52:35,211 --> 00:52:36,531
Has anyone seen Dedée?

698
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:38,551
Look at the sweetheart, he's all lost.

699
00:52:38,638 --> 00:52:40,478
Dedée is in my room, she's sleeping.

700
00:52:40,572 --> 00:52:41,882
What's on her mind?

701
00:52:42,004 --> 00:52:44,464
She didn't want to bother you,
she's thoughtful.

702
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:47,977
We'll see, I don't like those ways.
It's 2 PM, she should be up.

703
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:50,308
When you sleep,
you stay away from trouble.

704
00:52:50,432 --> 00:52:53,242
Leave her alone, she came back late,
she has to rest.

705
00:52:53,364 --> 00:52:54,994
Did you hear me?

706
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,329
Going out? Lunch's almost ready.

707
00:52:57,417 --> 00:52:58,787
I have an appointment.

708
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,840
Good news, then I feel hungry.

709
00:53:08,444 --> 00:53:10,374
Hi! Is Mr. Charles here?

710
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:13,358
Yes, Mr. Marco. He is over there
with these gentlemen.

711
00:53:13,448 --> 00:53:16,238
- Hello.
- Wait, let me finish up here.

712
00:53:18,172 --> 00:53:20,882
- Is Mrs. Dedée alright?
- When she isn't, she cries.

713
00:53:20,974 --> 00:53:22,024
What else?

714
00:53:22,113 --> 00:53:24,203
- What can I get you?
- Give me a Spa.

715
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,870
- You drinking anything?
- No need.

716
00:53:27,479 --> 00:53:28,779
So, are you set?

717
00:53:28,896 --> 00:53:30,996
Not completely,
but I have some of it.

718
00:53:31,117 --> 00:53:34,197
You think I'll wait for weeks?
No way, I won't lose money.

719
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:35,698
Until tomorrow, you...

720
00:53:35,793 --> 00:53:38,773
Tomorrow then another tomorrow.
Then I go back to Paris.

721
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:42,070
You have no money, fine, others do...
Robert!

722
00:53:42,155 --> 00:53:45,455
Wait, someone promised
I'll have the rest tomorrow.

723
00:53:45,553 --> 00:53:47,613
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

724
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:49,471
I'll see you later.

725
00:53:49,585 --> 00:53:51,805
- Where will you find it?
- My luck.

726
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:55,639
- Here, I'll give you a deposit.
- What for, to buy sweets?

727
00:53:55,758 --> 00:53:57,968
Leave it here, thank you. Thank you!

728
00:53:58,091 --> 00:54:01,121
I know it's not much, but...
Tomorrow I'll have the rest.

729
00:54:01,209 --> 00:54:03,619
The guy I wanted to ask is away.

730
00:54:03,735 --> 00:54:05,355
My girl will find a way.

731
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:08,780
You can't do that to me.
I always took everything from you.

732
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:11,711
Wait until tomorrow and then
it's set, you have my word.

733
00:54:11,826 --> 00:54:13,096
I pay cash.

734
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:16,401
Don't talk about it to others.

735
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:18,067
My girl will get the money.

736
00:54:18,164 --> 00:54:20,874
Yesterday she got a client who's loaded.

737
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,981
Say you'll wait, I'm a pal.

738
00:54:23,073 --> 00:54:25,143
And the goods get stolen, tough?

739
00:54:25,226 --> 00:54:27,786
- You risk nothing because tomorrow...
- Tomorrow...!

740
00:54:27,876 --> 00:54:29,936
You're a carpet dealer,
you make me puke.

741
00:54:30,029 --> 00:54:32,569
- Don't start sobbing.
- So you'll wait till tomorrow?

742
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,010
Deadline. I'm staying til tomorrow.
I have some business to do.

743
00:54:36,129 --> 00:54:39,039
- Just call.
- Count on me, I'll get it.

744
00:54:39,162 --> 00:54:42,352
You should change trades, buddy,
you don't have enough blow.

745
00:54:57,546 --> 00:55:00,656
Hey you, hurry up,
you're not here for fun.

746
00:55:00,777 --> 00:55:02,687
What, you got something to say?

747
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:04,160
OK, just do your job.

748
00:55:04,246 --> 00:55:06,766
[Germ] How about a punch on the nose!

749
00:55:07,777 --> 00:55:11,197
Hey shorty, is this the first time
you visit the princesses?

750
00:55:12,808 --> 00:55:15,208
Whoa, stop, hold up!

751
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:18,293
Nice of you to come and see me now.

752
00:55:18,406 --> 00:55:19,856
I was nearby.

753
00:55:20,223 --> 00:55:22,903
- Can I talk to you frankly?
- Yes, what is it?

754
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:26,540
Don't perfume yourself like that for
me. It's not worth it and a bit weird.

755
00:55:26,629 --> 00:55:30,049
- What's the word?
- It's good you came, Julien called.

756
00:55:30,136 --> 00:55:32,446
- The delivery will be tomorrow.
- What time?

757
00:55:32,543 --> 00:55:35,983
We'll talk. First go in,
then you do what you want.

758
00:55:39,871 --> 00:55:42,271
- Is he her pimp?
- Yes, he's far from brilliant.

759
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:45,430
Hey girls, isn't it over?

760
00:55:45,565 --> 00:55:47,665
- What has fallen down?
- Her mirror.

761
00:55:47,787 --> 00:55:49,857
Funny way to welcome the visitors.

762
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:52,363
Your residents are dangerous.

763
00:55:52,446 --> 00:55:54,776
- Let me go. - My feet!
- Let me go!

764
00:55:54,873 --> 00:55:57,233
It's seven years of bad luck,
we don't need that.

765
00:55:57,323 --> 00:55:58,553
Dedée.

766
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:00,850
Dedée.

767
00:56:04,222 --> 00:56:06,102
Dedée. Wake up.

768
00:56:07,779 --> 00:56:09,889
Quick, wake up.

769
00:56:15,037 --> 00:56:17,637
Christ, that's serious business.

770
00:56:18,658 --> 00:56:22,208
Wake up, he's downstairs,
he just came in with Mr. René.

771
00:56:28,823 --> 00:56:30,383
Help yourself to my powder.

772
00:56:30,503 --> 00:56:32,823
No, the other one,
that one is too bright.

773
00:56:33,602 --> 00:56:36,912
Put your hair up like the last time
you went to the hairdresser's.

774
00:56:37,338 --> 00:56:39,448
You know, with the curls in front.

775
00:56:40,348 --> 00:56:42,218
And put on your marabou.

776
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:47,321
You're not saying anything.
Are you angry because I woke you up?

777
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:48,818
I had to do it.

778
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:51,272
Don't blame me, dear,
I don't feel like talking.

779
00:56:51,386 --> 00:56:52,796
I'm in the fog.

780
00:56:55,476 --> 00:56:57,066
I'm so happy.

781
00:56:58,185 --> 00:57:00,595
I feel like it was always this way.

782
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,240
You don't know how good it is.

783
00:57:04,172 --> 00:57:05,532
Ah, you finally got up!

784
00:57:05,647 --> 00:57:08,757
- Couldn't you knock, it's my room.
- Forget it, leave us alone.

785
00:57:13,311 --> 00:57:16,181
The customer from last night
is downstairs to see you.

786
00:57:16,411 --> 00:57:20,361
Good job. You can do it
when you want to. It's not so hard.

787
00:57:20,587 --> 00:57:22,617
Yesterday was good,
but it's not enough.

788
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:25,516
I told you how much I need,
otherwise my deal is gone.

789
00:57:26,996 --> 00:57:30,566
If he comes in the afternoon, he's
yours, he'll give what you want.

790
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:34,430
But even that won't be enough. Listen.

791
00:57:35,409 --> 00:57:36,989
You remember in Toulon?

792
00:57:37,108 --> 00:57:39,468
You had no trouble then,
do it again now.

793
00:57:39,586 --> 00:57:41,926
For me, you'll do it again,
for your Marco.

794
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:45,850
You'll be safe, I heard
he's leaving tomorrow.

795
00:57:46,219 --> 00:57:48,119
So do it on the quiet.

796
00:57:49,045 --> 00:57:50,695
You'll probably stay with him,

797
00:57:50,788 --> 00:57:53,338
so tomorrow morning,
just before leaving...

798
00:57:54,193 --> 00:57:57,603
Got it? Come on, you'll do it?

799
00:57:59,269 --> 00:58:01,669
Dedée! Dedée!

800
00:58:13,228 --> 00:58:15,788
I was so angry with myself
for letting you come back here.

801
00:58:15,907 --> 00:58:17,577
I imagined you here.

802
00:58:18,044 --> 00:58:19,774
That's why you came to get me?

803
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,090
A little.

804
00:58:21,318 --> 00:58:23,208
And also to have you near me.

805
00:58:23,327 --> 00:58:26,717
You had to come here.
You had to be here.

806
00:58:26,838 --> 00:58:30,618
For me to have your hand like that.
Oh, stupid words.

807
00:58:31,995 --> 00:58:34,255
I hadn't noticed
that your eyes were so blue.

808
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:37,073
I haven't had a good look at you yet...
let me look.

809
00:58:37,191 --> 00:58:39,281
Don't look too much,
I'm not handsome.

810
00:58:39,955 --> 00:58:42,455
It's funny, your hair is almost fair.

811
00:58:43,025 --> 00:58:45,315
- Were you fair when you were a kid?
- Yes.

812
00:58:45,954 --> 00:58:48,014
- Did you live in Naples?
- In Genoa.

813
00:58:48,383 --> 00:58:49,933
I went to Naples later.

814
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:53,026
I would have liked to see you as a kid.

815
00:58:58,374 --> 00:59:00,804
You're all white compared to me.

816
00:59:05,237 --> 00:59:07,097
Stay with me.

817
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:10,030
I knew you were leaving tomorrow,
I wasn't afraid.

818
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,255
It couldn't end so quickly.

819
00:59:17,565 --> 00:59:20,515
We set sail tomorrow at 3 am,
but you shouldn't be there tonight.

820
00:59:21,548 --> 00:59:25,198
It can be dangerous. You'll
come only at departure time.

821
00:59:25,317 --> 00:59:28,127
I'll call you at the Big Moon
as soon as it's finished.

822
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:31,121
Once we're gone,
there's no more risk.

823
00:59:31,476 --> 00:59:33,906
- Where are we going?
- To many countries.

824
00:59:35,666 --> 00:59:38,696
I'm offering you
a strange life, Dedée...

825
00:59:39,308 --> 00:59:41,938
But after this trip,
you mustn't stay on the ship.

826
00:59:42,687 --> 00:59:45,847
Women shouldn't be on a boat,
especially in this business.

827
00:59:50,561 --> 00:59:54,601
You'll stay where you feel good,
and I'll know you're there.

828
00:59:55,546 --> 01:00:00,376
Don't think that far ahead.
We leave tomorrow, then we'll see.

829
01:00:20,902 --> 01:00:22,302
Come in.

830
01:00:29,111 --> 01:00:30,351
Ah, it's you!

831
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:34,262
Come close, don't stay there.
Nothing broken, right?

832
01:00:35,056 --> 01:00:36,256
No, it's fine.

833
01:00:36,378 --> 01:00:38,088
Then don't make that face.

834
01:00:38,646 --> 01:00:40,996
You have something to ask me,
don't you?

835
01:00:42,067 --> 01:00:44,037
- Something serious?
- Yes.

836
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:46,079
And you can't let it out?

837
01:00:47,054 --> 01:00:48,404
Is it so hard to say?

838
01:00:50,197 --> 01:00:51,397
A little.

839
01:00:51,517 --> 01:00:55,187
Then, I'll help you, Dedée.
It's about...

840
01:00:58,703 --> 01:01:01,113
I feel there's a trip brewing...

841
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,780
He's finally made up his mind,
the gentleman.

842
01:01:05,313 --> 01:01:08,983
He was stronger than everyone,
no one could have him.

843
01:01:09,095 --> 01:01:13,585
So much for René... in the end,
he's like everyone, your pirate.

844
01:01:13,867 --> 01:01:17,007
So, what are you doing here?
Why didn't you stay with him?

845
01:01:17,308 --> 01:01:19,918
I hope you didn't come
to get my blessing?

846
01:01:20,371 --> 01:01:22,571
He doesn't want me on board
before departure.

847
01:01:22,694 --> 01:01:23,944
Because?

848
01:01:24,278 --> 01:01:27,008
Ah yes, of course. He's right.

849
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,810
He'll call here after loading.

850
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:34,190
- You don't mind if I go?
- You're of age.

851
01:01:35,015 --> 01:01:37,465
It has nothing to do with my will...

852
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:40,455
I knew you wouldn't spend
your whole life here.

853
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,180
That wouldn't be fair.

854
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,450
- Will you find someone else?
- I'll have to.

855
01:01:47,539 --> 01:01:49,369
- We'll miss you.
- Me too, you...

856
01:01:49,462 --> 01:01:52,562
Goodbye, eh? You want me
to teach you how to lie?

857
01:01:53,098 --> 01:01:55,168
Now get out of here,
I have things to do.

858
01:01:55,257 --> 01:01:57,227
Tonight I'll drive you there.

859
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:04,268
Mr. René, is it really dangerous?

860
01:02:05,363 --> 01:02:07,203
What are you talking about?

861
01:02:07,727 --> 01:02:09,797
No, it's just not for women.

862
01:02:09,917 --> 01:02:12,907
Don't worry about that,
go to your room and rest.

863
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:16,323
I'll pick you up at 2 AM.
Home delivery.

864
01:02:18,707 --> 01:02:20,877
Tonight I'd like to be downstairs.

865
01:02:20,997 --> 01:02:22,407
For the last time.

866
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,380
As you wish.

867
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:28,323
And Marco, is he upstairs?

868
01:02:28,804 --> 01:02:30,604
Right, I forgot about that one.

869
01:02:30,721 --> 01:02:33,661
Yes, he should be upstairs.
Wait, I'll go there.

870
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:36,720
- I'd rather tell him myself.
- No, stay here.

871
01:02:37,871 --> 01:02:39,951
I've been waiting for it
for a long time.

872
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:50,990
Get up.

873
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:53,013
- Is Dedée back?
- Yes, Dedée's back.

874
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:55,979
- Where are you going?
- I have to see her, is she in her room?

875
01:02:56,065 --> 01:02:59,045
No, she's in my office. No hurry,
you have something to do first.

876
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,630
- Is this your suitcase?
- Yes.

877
01:03:04,385 --> 01:03:06,485
- Then pack up.
- Pack up?

878
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:09,243
- And fast... you have 5 minutes.
- Tell me what's wrong?

879
01:03:09,334 --> 01:03:11,354
We've seen enough of you
in this house.

880
01:03:12,439 --> 01:03:14,239
If Dedée failed you, I'll beat her.

881
01:03:14,699 --> 01:03:17,319
You can't fire us like that!
She makes people come.

882
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,670
Better not to talk, Marco.
Pack up... that's my advice.

883
01:03:20,808 --> 01:03:21,928
The cops?

884
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:26,007
If she swiped his purse,
it's not my fault, I swear.

885
01:03:26,446 --> 01:03:29,586
Yesterday she said she'd sting him.
I forbade her, it's not my fault.

886
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:32,029
I'll tell them I'm not guilty.

887
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:36,130
If Dedée is jailed...
What will I do?

888
01:03:36,711 --> 01:03:39,001
You can't do that to me...
What will I live on?

889
01:03:39,087 --> 01:03:41,677
- Two minutes left.
- You were always defending her.

890
01:03:41,766 --> 01:03:43,976
It's your fault, you see what she is.

891
01:03:44,263 --> 01:03:48,263
She isn't worth it.
Not very clean.

892
01:03:48,382 --> 01:03:51,002
It had to end like that.
I'll get you another one.

893
01:03:51,251 --> 01:03:52,731
Don't fire me like that!

894
01:03:52,822 --> 01:03:54,282
One minute left, Marco.

895
01:03:55,042 --> 01:03:57,002
You won't give me to the cops, right?

896
01:03:58,478 --> 01:04:00,518
What will I do? What will I do?

897
01:04:01,373 --> 01:04:04,353
A porter... keep me as a porter
until I get a woman.

898
01:04:07,209 --> 01:04:10,219
Don't touch me! No, don't touch me...

899
01:04:10,336 --> 01:04:12,456
My stuff! Let me get my stuff!

900
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,540
We'll send your stuff, get out!

901
01:04:14,856 --> 01:04:17,776
- Get the hell out of here.
- You can't keep them. Dedée!

902
01:04:17,874 --> 01:04:20,094
Don't bother to call her.
No cops, no wallet.

903
01:04:20,205 --> 01:04:22,855
- She's fed up and leaving.
- She hasn't been arrested?

904
01:04:22,949 --> 01:04:25,409
No, she's found a real man.
Know what that means?

905
01:04:25,532 --> 01:04:27,912
- That Italian?
- Yes. My advice: Stay away.

906
01:04:27,996 --> 01:04:31,246
- She's my wife. She's mine.
- I've had enough of you. Go!

907
01:04:31,342 --> 01:04:33,572
Dedée! Dedée!

908
01:04:36,253 --> 01:04:38,453
You can't stop me from saying goodbye!

909
01:04:38,538 --> 01:04:40,008
- Here.
- I like Dedée!

910
01:04:40,242 --> 01:04:43,112
- Here's the door!
- I must see her!

911
01:04:45,074 --> 01:04:46,934
You're lucky I'm patient!

912
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,560
I've seen enough of you!

913
01:04:57,642 --> 01:04:59,862
A page has been turned, Dedée.

914
01:05:05,116 --> 01:05:07,516
I wish it was already tonight.

915
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:23,627
- Aren't you taking your perfume?
- No.

916
01:06:24,096 --> 01:06:25,696
It's yours, if you want it.

917
01:06:25,817 --> 01:06:28,867
It's not for my type,
but I'll still take it.

918
01:06:29,117 --> 01:06:30,447
What time is it?

919
01:06:30,956 --> 01:06:32,816
9:30 PM, I have to go downstairs.

920
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:34,160
It's taking so long!

921
01:06:34,246 --> 01:06:36,816
Patience. You have
your whole life ahead of you.

922
01:06:36,942 --> 01:06:38,012
Germaine!

923
01:06:38,252 --> 01:06:40,192
No way to be alone for a minute!

924
01:06:40,276 --> 01:06:41,286
Yes!

925
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:42,430
Germaine!

926
01:06:42,522 --> 01:06:43,782
Coming!

927
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,660
I'll say goodbye to you now,
my Germaine,

928
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,770
because later on I'll leave quietly.

929
01:06:53,891 --> 01:06:55,781
Say goodbye to them all for me.

930
01:06:56,031 --> 01:06:58,841
I don't want to see them,
I'm too sorry to leave you here.

931
01:06:58,928 --> 01:07:00,218
I've been so lucky.

932
01:07:00,337 --> 01:07:02,867
Don't cry, my Germaine.

933
01:07:03,842 --> 01:07:06,372
You'll see, your day will come.

934
01:07:06,493 --> 01:07:09,503
Why? They are all so nice.

935
01:07:09,622 --> 01:07:12,502
No, when I've saved enough, I'll retire.

936
01:07:12,771 --> 01:07:16,161
- You'll write me?
- I promise, I'll write to you.

937
01:07:16,455 --> 01:07:19,795
And if it's a nice place,
I'll join you there.

938
01:07:20,101 --> 01:07:22,161
We'll be close one another.

939
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:51,975
A gin.

940
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,860
[indistinct]

941
01:07:58,404 --> 01:07:59,724
Leave me the bottle...

942
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:16,055
[Ital] Hurry up, guys!
There's still one to unload!

943
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:38,400
Don't let yourself become downhearted.

944
01:08:38,545 --> 01:08:40,755
You should have left,
I told you last time.

945
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:42,383
You shouldn't stay here.

946
01:08:42,832 --> 01:08:45,602
They are hunting you,
you'll end up being caught.

947
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:49,172
Where are your two friends?
Your two pals?

948
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:50,882
Military Police.

949
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:53,260
If you stay here, it'll be the same.

950
01:08:56,771 --> 01:08:57,941
Bought...

951
01:08:58,724 --> 01:09:02,184
Identity papers...
Good papers, bought...

952
01:09:02,297 --> 01:09:05,097
Put it away. So you're ready.

953
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:09,502
- What did you say?
- You're in order, you're OK.

954
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:14,206
I want to go home.
I want to go home.

955
01:09:14,334 --> 01:09:17,664
- I know.
- I want to go home.

956
01:09:18,914 --> 01:09:21,334
You'll go back to your country.
Believe me.

957
01:09:22,654 --> 01:09:25,484
You think everything is blocked,
nothing left to do, then...

958
01:09:25,573 --> 01:09:27,613
one day it happens.

959
01:09:27,702 --> 01:09:29,962
Come on, no more. Don't drink!

960
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,430
You'll go home, I'm telling you.

961
01:09:33,551 --> 01:09:35,371
You'll see again America.

962
01:09:35,491 --> 01:09:37,801
It happens, I can assure you,
it happens.

963
01:09:38,653 --> 01:09:40,163
For me too, it was over.

964
01:09:40,403 --> 01:09:41,743
Washed up.

965
01:09:41,994 --> 01:09:43,374
Now I'm leaving.

966
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,721
It's never lost. Never.

967
01:09:49,158 --> 01:09:51,098
I want to go home.

968
01:09:54,003 --> 01:09:56,053
If only I could speak English well.

969
01:09:57,416 --> 01:10:00,126
You don't even understand
what I'm telling you.

970
01:10:14,995 --> 01:10:16,295
Wait a minute.

971
01:10:18,374 --> 01:10:21,194
- Is it him?
- Not yet, soon, don't be afraid.

972
01:10:22,084 --> 01:10:23,284
Who's he?

973
01:10:23,799 --> 01:10:24,919
A deserter.

974
01:10:25,042 --> 01:10:27,722
He comes here sometimes.
He's drunk and blue.

975
01:10:28,081 --> 01:10:31,531
- Are you cheering him up?
- I've often wanted to.

976
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:34,749
Tonight it's not work
any more so I do it.

977
01:10:37,085 --> 01:10:39,665
- Do you think it's OK there?
- Why not?

978
01:10:39,787 --> 01:10:44,177
A little late, that's normal.
Just wait. Go comfort your guy.

979
01:10:59,273 --> 01:11:01,723
- Any more?
- The last two.

980
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,351
[Ital] Close up and be ready
to leave at 4.

981
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,360
[Ital] Go have a drink at the square.

982
01:11:06,451 --> 01:11:09,881
- [Ital] You coming, captain?
- I have things to do, maybe later.

983
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:33,688
Have a safe journey, guys!

984
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:55,239
You can't leave, can you?

985
01:12:56,342 --> 01:12:58,572
- I had one last look.
- Come on.

986
01:13:01,821 --> 01:13:03,611
- Mr. René...
- Yes?

987
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:06,909
- Do you think I'll forget?
- What? The Big Moon? I hope not.

988
01:13:07,029 --> 01:13:11,099
No, Marco and the others.
It's as if I came to him with a disease.

989
01:13:11,218 --> 01:13:14,478
Don't think about that.
It's no time for literature. Come on.

990
01:13:29,326 --> 01:13:30,716
- Mr. René!
- What now?

991
01:13:30,814 --> 01:13:32,814
Here's the little one
I told you about.

992
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:34,710
- You want to work?
- I'd like to.

993
01:13:34,804 --> 01:13:36,234
- How old are you?
- 21.

994
01:13:36,323 --> 01:13:38,253
I'm not asking you.
How old are you?

995
01:13:38,369 --> 01:13:40,519
- 21.
- That's what they always say.

996
01:13:40,641 --> 01:13:42,111
Old enough, I guarantee.

997
01:13:42,231 --> 01:13:44,691
I don't have time tonight.
Come tomorrow afternoon.

998
01:13:44,812 --> 01:13:45,992
Alright, Mr. René.

999
01:13:46,114 --> 01:13:47,934
She's your replacement.

1000
01:13:50,953 --> 01:13:52,993
He brought me in the morning.

1001
01:15:22,088 --> 01:15:23,868
I'm not a man, eh?

1002
01:15:24,369 --> 01:15:25,859
I'm not a man?

1003
01:15:26,126 --> 01:15:28,346
[Ital] Captain! Captain!

1004
01:15:29,604 --> 01:15:32,544
[Ital] Captain! Captain!

1005
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,000
Police!

1006
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,800
[Ital] What happened?

1007
01:16:25,766 --> 01:16:27,396
[Ital] Is that our captain?

1008
01:16:27,489 --> 01:16:29,099
Yes. Police?

1009
01:16:29,219 --> 01:16:32,479
No, everything was fine.
He left the ship...

1010
01:16:32,601 --> 01:16:33,991
We heard shooting.

1011
01:16:34,764 --> 01:16:36,124
[Ital] Is he dead?

1012
01:16:36,482 --> 01:16:37,702
Yes.

1013
01:16:45,096 --> 01:16:47,796
- I'm closing, Mr. Marco.
- Where's Mr. Charles?

1014
01:16:47,887 --> 01:16:50,467
He left this evening.
I think he was waiting for you.

1015
01:16:50,586 --> 01:16:51,656
Left?

1016
01:16:52,743 --> 01:16:54,743
He shouldn't have left until tomorrow.

1017
01:17:13,435 --> 01:17:15,115
Take him to the boat.

1018
01:17:15,536 --> 01:17:16,936
[Ital] Take his feet.

1019
01:17:33,863 --> 01:17:36,063
- Marco's?
- Yes.

1020
01:17:50,314 --> 01:17:52,684
- Where are you going?
- Looking for him.

1021
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:52,480
He was here early evening,
half drunk, you know other places?

1022
01:18:52,604 --> 01:18:54,304
- Karel's.
- Let's go.

1023
01:19:35,342 --> 01:19:38,772
He was here 15 min ago, asking for
Rotterdam train times.

1024
01:19:39,038 --> 01:19:40,678
You won't make it, Mr. René.

1025
01:19:40,774 --> 01:19:43,364
We have one hour
before the first train.

1026
01:20:35,644 --> 01:20:36,894
What?

1027
01:20:42,111 --> 01:20:43,161
Come.

1028
01:20:44,524 --> 01:20:45,904
- No.
- Come.

1029
01:20:49,162 --> 01:20:51,522
If you move too fast,
I'll drop you.

1030
01:21:52,215 --> 01:21:54,225
Get out... get out.

1031
01:21:56,513 --> 01:21:59,113
- Come on.
- No... no.

1032
01:22:10,814 --> 01:22:12,574
No, you have no right.

1033
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:17,120
It's not possible. Dedée!
I didn't want to kill him. I swear.

1034
01:22:17,213 --> 01:22:19,123
- Get up.
- No!

1035
01:22:19,802 --> 01:22:22,122
No, I beg you.

1036
01:22:32,793 --> 01:22:35,813
No, I don't want to...!
I don't want to...

1037
01:22:35,928 --> 01:22:37,268
- Wait.
- Yes!

1038
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:40,180
- Yes, Dedée, stop him.
- Not like that.

1039
01:22:40,584 --> 01:22:43,474
- It's too sweet.
- You'll be arrested.

1040
01:22:43,731 --> 01:22:46,741
You can't kill me...
You can't kill me...

1041
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:58,540
The car...
It'll look like an accident.

1042
01:23:01,823 --> 01:23:05,093
Dedée, I don't want to die...
I don't want to...

1043
01:23:06,467 --> 01:23:08,947
I didn't want to leave,
it was for that.

1044
01:23:09,035 --> 01:23:10,565
Make him shut up.

1045
01:23:11,013 --> 01:23:14,443
No, I don't want to...! Dedée!

1046
01:23:22,499 --> 01:23:24,399
You knocked him too hard.

1047
01:23:24,738 --> 01:23:26,828
Too bad, he won't know.

1048
01:23:28,948 --> 01:23:30,418
On the road.

1049
01:24:15,364 --> 01:24:17,324
The gun's gone.

1050
01:24:45,466 --> 01:24:46,686
Go.

1051
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:54,479
Slowly...
