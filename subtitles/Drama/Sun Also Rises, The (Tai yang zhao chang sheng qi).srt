<i> Episode 53</i>

19
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,690
Zi Long, are you mad?

20
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:44,150
Yan Cheng. We lived in South Xu, the danger is everywhere.

21
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,710
All these have to do it.

22
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,170
I'm saying that they have civil unrest is also good.

23
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,090
Never mind the foreign aggression, they can deal with it themselves. Do we need to worry or trouble about it?

24
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,590
We don't need to bury these rotten matter. They still able to do something to us.

25
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,890
Now we are visitors in Jiangdong.

26
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,310
If they think of scheming us, they have plenty of way.

27
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,990
Although Your Highness have extremely protecting Wu state,

28
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,010
but still at all times be confronted with danger.

29
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,350
For the safety of Our Majesty, some of the things we have to prevent it.

30
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,830
Ever since the last time Jia Hua tried to assassinate His Majesty.

31
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,290
I am worried about His Highness' safety day and night.

32
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,170
This is his territory.

33
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,870
I cannot not guard him.

34
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,670
go deep into the mountains, knowing well that there are tigers <br><i>(means: go on undeterred by the dangers)</i>

35
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,370
That's my duties as a subordinate,

36
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,010
ought to be my responsibilites.

37
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,430
Yan Cheng, I will leave these five hundred soldiers' lives in your hands.

38
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,160
Zi Long!

39
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,800
The route on the mountain is a valley. Two sides of the mountains are steep and high.

40
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,660
You can send Pai Zhang to lead a thousand troops, lie in ambush on-top of the mountain slopes.

41
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,960
Prepare things to set on fire.

42
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,650
Order Gan Ling and Ling Tong, to each lead 1,000 troops, lie in ambush on both sides of the valley,

43
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,350
As long as after Jingzhou's army enter into the valley,

44
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,330
Gan Ling and Ling Tong, each block off the valley's entrance/exit.

45
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,220
Pai Zhang can use fire sphere and falling rocks to attack the Jingzhou's army.

46
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,900
At the same time have Gan Ling and Ling Tong slaughter them at both ends.

47
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,400
Commander's brilliant plan.

48
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,870
Keep in mind, Cao army have to act lifelike and appropriately leave a few survivors,

49
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,030
Let them spread the new that it's the Cao army who's the culprits.

50
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,630
Yes.

51
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,250
Go!

52
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,440
Go!

53
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,220
Crap! What a load of crap!

54
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,830
How can Gong Jin play into Zhao Zi Long's taunts?

55
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,990
He is a Senior Commander of troops and horses (military forces),

56
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,170
How could he go across to Jiang County to gather intelligence about the military situation?

57
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,130
What commander mean is, since we're pretending, we'll need to be more believable.

58
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,380
in case Zhao Zi Long die outside the Cao's camp, wouldn't that be great?

59
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,400
Along with Gong Jin, there's only 19 of us.

60
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,990
Suppose we all get discovered by Cao Army, perhaps we fall into Zhao Zi Long's cunning scheme.

61
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,230
Gong Jin's life will be in danger.

62
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,170
Your Majesty, there's no need to worry, the Commander has already thought about this.

63
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,370
He has a plan to counter it.

64
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,130
Even so, with just 19 of us

65
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,200
do you think, there's an opportunity to kill Zhao Zi Long?

66
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,800
Could it be that you don't know, during that year he once, single-handedly fought a very fierce battle at Zhang Ban Po?

67
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,110
Your Majesty, just relax

68
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,290
Back then at Zhang Ban Po, Zhao Zi Long did infact single-handedly fought a bloody battle,

69
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,210
but this time, there's a great difference.

70
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,160
This time Zhao Zi Long didn't carry his spear and he's not riding his horse.

71
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,080
He's alone and merely carrying a long sword.

72
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,750
He...

73
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,760
What exactly does he want to do?

74
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,960
Tonight the moon is bright and clear,

75
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,520
haven't light candle light and it's well illuminated.

76
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,620
being like this on the tranquil great river,

77
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,120
able to drink with commander, really is an aesthetic mood.

78
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,180
Able to drink with General Zhao under such circumstance,

79
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,360
also is my good fortune.

80
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,380
There is a saying that goes "even the slightest mistake in music cannot escape Zhou Yu's ears"

81
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,640
Commander, your musical talents are unparalleled

82
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,440
It's an honour to listen to it.

83
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,980
The moonlight shines like a luminous pearl, the waves are calm and soothing. It is such a wonderful moment

84
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,740
to play the instruments and make beautiful music.

85
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,940
What a pity that we're now on a reconnaissance mission.

86
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,690
If you wish,

87
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,960
I will definitely play for you in the future.

88
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,600
That would be wonderful. Thank you, Commander.

89
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,610
Come, let's drink!

90
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,420
Go!

91
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,380
<i>As expected, it's here.</i>

92
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,430
There's Cao Army!

93
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,670
Originally we wanted to take a walk today.

94
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,860
But unfortunately, it looks like we've been discovered by Cao Cao's watchmen.

95
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,920
Seems like we cannot finish this walk.

96
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,890
Since you cannot finish this walk,

97
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,350
Why not continue our conversation beneath the moon while drinking wine?

98
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,010
Good idea.

99
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,370
Here.

100
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,490
Zhao Yun.

101
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,600
Zhou Yu.

102
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,110
Looks like your old acquaintances came.

103
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,380
Oh, it's Brother Xia Hou!

104
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,680
Xia Hou Dun, since we parted ways at Bowang Slope,

105
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,130
it must have been a few years since we've seen each other.

106
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,750
Zhao Yun! You are really brave!

107
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,800
Coming this close to our base camp,

108
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,050
you are really something! Interesting!

109
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,260
What's interesting about that?

110
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,230
In those years, from Xinye to Jiangxia,

111
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,760
I've dealt with you guys countless times.

112
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,510
Here.

113
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,340
Brother, why would you waste time talking to him?

114
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,540
Let's order our soldiers to release all their arrows

115
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,000
and make them all porcupines!

116
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,700
Miao Cai, nonsense!

117
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,840
Do you remember that at Changban Slope,

118
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,410
Prime Minister wasn't willing to kill Zhao Yun.

119
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,240
Now, who knows if he's willing to or not.

120
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,870
It is even more unwise to kill Zhou Yu.

121
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,070
He's the Commander in Chief of the Wu Army. If we can capture him alive,

122
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,740
it would be considered a miraculous feat.

123
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:07,310
So that means, we musn't kill any of those two?

124
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,920
We can't.

125
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:19,430
If that's so, we'll surround them with our troops

126
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,260
and capture them for good.

127
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,510
Brother, do you still remember the battle at Bowang Slope?

128
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,920
It was Zhao Yun who pretended

129
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,920
to be on the retreat and lured my forces to pursue him,

130
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,960
making me lose a significant number of subordinates.

131
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,810
Nobody knows what he's plotting this time.

132
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,230
Since General Xia Hou seems to be so pleased looking at us drinking,

133
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,300
you guys should put down your weapons, take a seat

134
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,220
and drink with the Commander and I.

135
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,710
Since General Zhao already said it. You should just sit down and drink with us.

136
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,890
- Here, here, here. Everyone, drink! <br>- Here. Raise your glasses!

137
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:29,840
Big Brother, who cares about what they're planning to do?

138
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,390
We should just send a few hundred men

139
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:39,540
and round them up. I'd like to see which is faster,

140
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,420
their plots or the swing of our swords.

141
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,060
Ready.

142
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,650
Commander-in-chief, they will take action now. What are we supposed to do?

143
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,900
Usually, it's General Zhao who trains you.

144
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,240
Naturally, you should ask General Zhao about how to battle with Cao Army.

145
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,120
When I was training the soldiers,

146
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,200
I have mentioned that no matter the size of the battlefield or the number of soldiers,

147
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,550
it is aways possible to create a powerful formation.

148
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,500
As long as all of you keep calm

149
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,560
and refrain from retreating in fear, we can fight a force of hundreds with just ten men.

150
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,720
Kill!

151
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,470
Eighteen soldiers actually defeated Cao Army with more than hundred soldiers.

152
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,280
Furthermore, there wasn't even one casualty.

153
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,850
General Zhao's recent training really has some magical effects.

154
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,720
You flatter me. I'm only doing my best

155
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,120
to fulfil the responsibility that you have entrusted me with.

156
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,970
Big Brother, we cannot remain in this impasse any longer.

157
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,920
Let's release the arrows!

158
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,810
Brother.

159
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,480
Brother!

160
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,910
Do what you wish!

161
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,140
Big Brother, don't worry about it.

162
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,060
If Prime Minister blames anyone, I will take full responsibilty!

163
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,560
Archers ready!

164
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,530
Seems like it's now time for plan B.

165
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,950
Servant! Send the signal.

166
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:20,590
Xia Hou Dun, while you're busying trying to seize the twenty odd men that you see in front of you,

167
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,000
you've forgotten to look behind your back.

168
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,870
The Wu Army misses their Commander very much.

169
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:30,740
They've sent dozens of ships to the north bank!

170
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,960
You rascal! To hell with your plots!

171
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,850
That's not my idea.

172
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,260
If you want to curse, curse Commander-in-Chief Zhou!

173
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,150
Commander-in-Chief, how do you think we should end today's issue?

174
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,120
We're only here at the north bank today to take a stroll

175
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,210
and have a few drinks. Now that we've emptied our cups,

176
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,140
we shall take our leave.

177
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,970
You want to leave? It's not that easy!

178
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,810
Nobody gets out of here alive!

179
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,320
Xia Hou Yuan, if you order the arrows to be released the same time as we do,

180
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,310
are you sure that you will be unharmed?

181
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,530
If our reinforcements continue to disembark,

182
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,480
Are you sure you will be able to defeat us?

183
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,310
Are you sure that your base camp

184
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,900
will not be conquered my us?

185
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,370
It's now late into the night. Shall we meet again during the day

186
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,040
so that we can engage in a proper battle

187
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,850
that can quench our thirst for blood?

188
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:57,080
Are you saying that you will act as what Commander Zhou has proposed and retreat?

189
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,080
I'm saying that we both gather our troops

190
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,250
and return to our camps.

191
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,900
Retreat!

192
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,330
The Polaris star has finally appeared.

193
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,050
It will be daybreak soon.

194
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,910
This really is an unforgettable night.

195
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,160
Perhaps, you were disappointed tonight.

196
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:50,210
Since I wasn't killed and Jingzhou's five hundred soldiers were not harmed.

197
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,180
I already had the premonition that it would end like this long ago.

198
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,370
Why would it be like this?

199
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,630
When Councillor Zhu Ge performed the ritual to summon the easterlie wind,

200
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,690
he was in possession of your military seal for a few days.

201
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,620
Even though he returned it to you in the end,

202
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,080
but he kept a mould of the seal

203
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,340
and I made a fake one using that.

204
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,370
It's Zhu Ge Liang again...

205
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,880
Are you telling me that your invitation to monitor enemy movements on the north bank

206
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,160
is also his idea?

207
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,790
The Councillor is far away at Jingzhou. He won't be able to anticipate every single development.

208
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,600
This was my idea.

209
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,290
What are you seeking by putting yourself in such danger?

210
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:12,240
There are a lot of things I seek.

211
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:18,180
But they need your help to be fulfilled.

212
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,000
Tell me about it.

213
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,960
The first thing is that I wish to take this opportunity of being in eminent danger of Cao Cao's army

214
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,610
to demonstrate clearly to you

215
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,660
that Cao Cao is our common enemy.

216
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,230
To remind you to hold back on your selfish desires

217
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:37,540
and not be driven by the need for revenge.

218
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,070
I don't need you to remind me of this!

219
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,240
- Go on.<br>- The second thing

220
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,820
is that the reason why I've decided to resist Cao Cao's army using only the military formations performed

221
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,570
by the Wu soldiers that I have trained

222
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:54,250
without wielding my spear or mounting my steed.

223
00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:00,350
I'm doing this to tell you that the soldiers in Lord Liu's army are all of this calibre.

224
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,780
Don't make misjudgments of this sort.

225
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,200
If a violent conflict breaks out between the Sun and the Liu families,

226
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,320
there will be no victories waiting for you.

227
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,270
Do you wish to intimidate me?

228
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,700
This is just my personal thoughts.

229
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,930
I already have plans regarding with whom

230
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,360
and how the Wu Army will fight. Go on with your speech.

231
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,240
Given your high musical talents,

232
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,110
I admire you greatly indeed.

233
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,870
But it's a pity that we've never gotten to know each other well.

234
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,790
During the battle of the Red Cliff,

235
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,590
I was at Jiangxia, and you were at Jiangdong.

236
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,840
We've never fought alongside each other.

237
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,710
I have always wanted an opportunity to be your comrade in battle.

238
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:54,070
This opportunity that you're talking about is a risky one indeed.

239
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,540
I know very well that you are careful in whatever you do.

240
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,570
You will not act in risky ways.

241
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,100
I had to do it this way if I wanted to fulfil my wish.

242
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:11,880
You keep repeating that you want to fight by my side and form a friendship with me.

243
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,100
I take it with a grain of salt.

244
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,430
All that you have done is for the sake of Liu Bei.

245
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:24,060
That's right. Ever since my Lord has arrived in Jiangdong,

246
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,990
you have plotted to kill him many times.

247
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,210
To stop you from doing so,

248
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,700
I really hope that we can be on friendly terms.

249
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,830
To be friends with me?

250
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,230
I'll pass.

251
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,480
We serve different Lords. We can never be friends.

252
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,080
As for sparing Liu Bei's life,

253
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,250
that would be even more impossible.

254
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:58,800
There's something I have to say. You have no choice must to obey it.

255
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,500
Liu Shen has already seized Pan Zhang in the valleys.

256
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,830
Pan Zhang has confessed about your plot to fake an infiltration by Cao Cao's spies

257
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,000
and to kill the soldiers from Jingzhou.

258
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,160
If you don't want Pan Zhang and all these evidence to be presented to the Queen Mother,

259
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,160
you must obey me on this.

260
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,280
The Queen Mother was already outraged by what you did earlier.

261
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:25,210
Do you want to enrage her again?

262
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,840
You're threatening me.

263
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,560
You know better than anyone that the Lord of Dongwu is a filial son.

264
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,250
If the Queen Mother becomes ill from the anger,

265
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:45,030
Do you, Zhou Gong Jin, think you will have it easy in Jiangdong?

266
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,260
I will not mention your plot to kill the Jingzhou soldiers

267
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,060
to my Lord and the Queen Mother.

268
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,790
I only hope that you can promise me

269
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,850
that for the remaining time that my Lord will spend in Jiangdong,

270
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,440
you will not try to assassinate him again.

271
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,080
What does it matter if I

272
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,430
promise or not?

273
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,040
After what happened yesterday night,

274
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,440
I know very well. As long as you are in Jiangdong,

275
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,190
as long as Liu Bei doesn't make a huge mistake ,

276
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,560
I'm not able to murder him anymore.

277
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:30,330
Commander, I believe that you are a virtuous gentleman.

278
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:36,180
But I still need to hear you say it.

279
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,370
Zhou Yu promised me himself that as long as the Lord lie low in Jiangdong

280
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,760
he will not try to plot against him anymore.

281
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,670
- Hopefully, he can do as he says<br>- No matter who, a person must have limits

282
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:12,540
I believe that as the Commander the Chief,

283
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,430
Zhou Yu will definitely keep his words.

284
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,240
But remember, Jiangdong is not our homeland.

285
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,280
Zi Long, you still need to think of a way to persuade His Highness to return to Jingzhou quickly.

286
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,870
Your Highness.

287
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:34,070
Your Highness, you have to take care of your health.

288
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,900
Don't worry, I'm glad, I'm happy.

289
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,790
If you're happy, you have to drink wine.

290
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,780
It's alright.

291
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,080
My Lord, to be honest,

292
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,340
You've already been married to your wife for one year.

293
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:59,450
Do you intend to live here forever and not return to Jingzhou?

294
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:07,470
Zi Long, what do you mean?

295
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:12,780
Forgive my rudeness. We have yet to accomplish what we set out to do

296
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,080
I hope that you will not forget about it.

297
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,330
Zi Long, I understand how you feel.

298
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,550
However, the Queen Mother and the Lord of Dongwu have treated me so well

299
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:34,140
are you saying that I should give them a cold shoulder?

300
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,040
The Councillor is still at Jingzhou. If anything happens,

301
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,490
I will certainly prioritize that over everything else.

302
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,870
So Zi Long, you don't need to worry too much.

303
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:49,360
My friendship with the Lord of Dongwu is laying the groundwork for our fight against Cao Cao in the future.

304
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,770
It's a great thing!

305
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:57,170
As the saying goes, whatever situation you find yourself in, make yourself comfortable.

306
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:06,650
Zi Long, you have followed me for all these years, riding into battle,

307
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,500
risking your life. You have sacrificed a lot.

308
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,890
You should try to relax.

309
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:19,200
We've come to this paradise after all those years of turmoil,

310
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,780
you should enjoy yourself and not think about anything else.

311
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,130
Don't die without having experienced such bliss!

312
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:32,360
Thank you, My Lord. I'm afraid that this paradise that you speak of

313
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,050
is not for me.

314
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,920
Zi Long!

315
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,310
Look what I've brought.

316
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:02,340
How is it? I've arranged everything myself. Does it look pretty?

317
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,910
Yeah.

318
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,500
I'm really not praising myself. I just saw Sister Shang Xiang arrange flowers a few times.

319
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,720
So, I learned to do it myself. I've never expected I would do so well.

320
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,000
Tell me, I'm naturally gifted, who do I take after?

321
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,570
Talking about arranging flowers. Not only do you have to be clever, but you also need to have good taste.

322
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:25,710
Talking about good taste, I have to praise myself again.

323
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,940
If I have poor taste, how could I have fallen in love with you?

324
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,760
Did you hear what I said?

325
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,280
Yes.

326
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,520
Then, tell me. What did I say?

327
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,040
Alright, alright. I won't annoy you anymore.

328
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,270
No.

329
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,740
What are you looking at?

330
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,870
I'm looking... to see what you are thinking.

331
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,490
You couldn't be thinking of Ma Yu Rou, could you?

332
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:12,110
No. I'm only worried about His Highness' matters.

333
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,950
Royal Uncle Liu and Sister are doing well together. What's there to worry about?

334
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,860
That's exactly what I am worried about.

335
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:22,550
I've already talked to Royal Uncle Liu about returning to Jingzhou a few times.

336
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,070
But he has never agreed to it.

337
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,060
Soon, it will be one year since we came to Nanxu.

338
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,360
Why are you worried about this?

339
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,870
Think about it, the Councillor is at Jingzhou.

340
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,130
If anything was to happen, they would definitely inform us.

341
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,460
No news is good news.

342
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,310
You've reminded me that Councillor said

343
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:52,430
to look at the second tactic at the end of the year.

344
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,550
[If the Lord indulges in pleasure, it's unclear how long will it take before you can return. Fabricate an urgent piece of military intelligence, and the general shall bring the Lord home.]

345
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,290
Let me finish reading it!

346
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:15,080
Even his back view looks so good.

347
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:23,290
What? Cao Cao is commanding an army of three hundred thousand to Jingzhou?

348
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,920
My Lord, this is important news. How dare I make it up?

349
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,490
I have rushed here at once.

350
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,060
Apologies for disturbing you and Madam.

351
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:37,330
Of course, military affairs have priority. You don't need to blame yourself.

352
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,800
We will have to return to Jingzhou.

353
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,850
It's only...

354
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,250
My dear, don't worry.

355
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,970
Since I married you,

356
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,040
naturally, I will always follow you for my whole life.

357
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,280
If you go to Jingzhou, you'll be living in constant danger

358
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,110
I would feel guilty about it.

359
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,920
I am a Lord's daughter.

360
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,000
I know very well what kinds of difficulties I would face when I decided to marry you.

361
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,980
But I am not afraid.

362
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:18,030
It's just that my mother is getting older everyday.

363
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,950
I'm worried that I won't be able to see her ever again.

364
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,420
General Zhao, I have a request to make of you.

365
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,140
Madame Sun, please say it.

366
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,290
I know that the matter that troubles my mother the most

367
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:40,230
is the marriage of Sister Bao Yue.

368
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:43,440
If I could fulfill my mother's wish before leaving,

369
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,240
I could leave knowing that I have been a good daughter.

370
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,860
General Zhao, are you willing to help me?

371
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:53,690
This- Talking about marriage...

372
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,770
I'm afraid it's not something that can be settled in a short period of time.

373
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,570
Right now, the military affairs are more urgent. I'm afraid-

374
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,840
You don't need to trouble yourself.

375
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,880
I didn't mean that you and Sister Bao Yue should marry immediately.

376
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,240
I just want you to make a promise

377
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,110
to let Sister Bao Yue follow you.

378
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,830
And that you will take care of her.

379
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:21,530
Alright. I will promise you that I will take care of Bao Yue.

380
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,630
Zi Long, prepare everything tonight.

381
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,500
We shall leave tomorrow morning.

382
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,460
My Lord, in my view, we won't be able to keep this a secret for long.

383
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,650
It would be the best if the Empress and the Lord of Dongwu didn't know about this.

384
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:38,950
Why?

385
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,860
Madam Sun and the Queen Mother share a very deep bond.

386
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:46,920
The Lord of Dongwu only has this one sister. If Your Highness and Madame Sun suddenly ask to resign,

387
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,460
the Empress and the Lord of Dongwu probably won't be willing to let you go.

388
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,630
Furthermore, the Queen Mother is very particular about etiquette.

389
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,350
She's bound to call for a feast as a farewell for you two.

390
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,370
Zi Long, you're right.

391
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,260
But if we ride for the dock tomorrow

392
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,500
aren't we going to attract tons of attention?

393
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:11,950
Husband, General Zhao, I have a plan.

394
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,350
Tomorrow, I will inform my mother that we are going to the river bank

395
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,120
to perform ceremonial rituals for our ancestors.

396
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,200
This should not arouse any suspicions.

397
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,160
Moreover, Zi Long will have time to prepare

398
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,430
and let the soldiers reach there first.

399
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:31,440
Madam Sun, your wisdom really saved us. With this plan, we can kill two birds with one stone.

400
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,350
I am really unfilial.

401
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:58,340
Not only did I deceive my mother,

402
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,750
but I also left without saying goodbye.

403
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,000
Wife, it's my fault.

404
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,590
Many things cannot be controlled when one is in the army.

405
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,610
Seeing you sad like this,

406
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,140
I feel endlessly sorry.

407
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,570
Husband, you really don't need to blame yourself.

408
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,970
I just find it difficult to leave mother behind.

409
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,070
But, I am not regretting it.

410
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:34,070
You have a responsibility to all of the people in this world.

411
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,380
I should not be an obstacle in your path.

412
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,430
You don't need to worry about me.

413
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:48,030
Madam, it is such a blessing to have you as my wife.

414
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,110
I can die without any regrets.

415
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,200
- What is it? <br>- We cannot cross the river.

416
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,160
The boatmen dare not sail without orders from the Lord of Dondwu

417
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,750
What should we do not? If we inform him now,

418
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,980
he's sure to prevent us from crossing the river.

419
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,130
My dear, perhaps we should walk for the time being.

420
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:18,750
We can think of other ideas once we cross Dongwu's border.

421
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:24,500
- Your Highness, Liu Bei and his people are starting to take action. <br>- What happened?

422
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,910
Liu Bei and Madam Sun went to see the Queen Mother today

423
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:30,100
informing her that they are going to the Yangtze River to perform rituals for ancestor worship.

424
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,390
All of Liu Bei's men have left the Palace of Eternal Bliss.

425
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,980
To perform ancestral worship at the river bank? What's he plotting?

426
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:42,210
My Lord, Liu Bei might be making a run for it.

427
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:45,770
He might be trying to get back to Jingzhou. The ancestral worship is just a disguise.

428
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:53,100
Quick! Call Gong Jin. Tell him I have something important to discuss with him.

429
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,560
Yes.

430
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:15,350
Giddy up!

431
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,470
Your Highness, there are Wu soldiers behind you!

432
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,710
Giddy up!

433
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,300
What should we do? Both the path forward

434
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,130
and backward are blocked by Wu forces, we have nowhere to go!

435
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,440
Councillor once said to do as this tactic says in case of emergency.

436
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,360
The love between husband and wife is deep and moving, it is a crulty to separate them.

437
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:49,430
When the phoenix shows her rage, the enemies can be subdued.

438
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,470
Husband, what happened?

439
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,990
My dear, I'm so sorry that you have to go through his.

440
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:10,220
Husband, what do you mean?

441
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,580
In the past, your brother connived with Zhou Yu

442
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,070
and planned your marriage to me.

443
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,880
He tried to trap me here at Nanxu and take back Jingzhou

444
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,850
by numbing my senses with luxury and pleasure.

445
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:24,300
Now that we have left without informing anybody,

446
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,450
The Lord of Dongwu must have sent people to follow and kill me.

447
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,470
I am at an dead end and you are implicated in this as well.

448
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:35,980
Since my brother sees me as a mere bait, I will no longer allow him to manipulate me like this.

449
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,850
Let me help you get out of this predicament.

450
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,850
My dear!

451
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,020
Zi Long, accompany my wife!

452
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,370
Yes.

453
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,400
Go!

454
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:51,700
Go!

455
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,550
Go!

456
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,900
- Giddy up!<br>- Stop!

457
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,450
Commander-in-Chief Zhou! You've got some nerve, sending people to kill us several times!

458
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:16,020
I'm just acting by the command of the Lord. Madam, please don't blame it on me.

459
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,820
Commander Zhou, yes, you are here by the command by my brother.

460
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,210
But don't you realize that my husband and I are here by the order of the Queen Mother?

461
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,370
I serve the Lord only.

462
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:29,750
Madam, if you want to avoid a violent confrontation,

463
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:34,130
I suggest that you come back to Nanxu with Lord Liu.

464
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,570
Madame, go back first.

465
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,990
Leave the rest to me.

466
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,340
Giddy up!

467
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,360
If that's what you plan to do, then I shall do my job.

468
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,880
Capture Liu Bei, don't harm the Madame! Kill!

469
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,020
Kill!

470
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,000
Go!

471
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,300
Wife, are you injured?

472
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:45,130
My dear, I'm fine. Zhou Yu has brought a considerable amount of forces to pursue us.

473
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:49,520
I'm afraid we won't be able to withstand his attacks. Let's leave this place fast.

474
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:03,570
Go!

475
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,750
Go!

476
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,900
Go!

477
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:34,050
Archers! Ready!

478
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,700
Guan Yun Chang is here! Commander Zhou! Please draw back at once!

479
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:55,340
Commander Zhou, you have really troubled yourself to escort my Lord and Madam here.

480
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:59,670
My forces are now taking over. Commander, you can return to Jiangdong.

481
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,940
Zhou Yu's brilliant strategy is one of its kind,

482
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,270
he gave away the Princess and a his soldiers' lives.

483

484
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,860

486
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,380

487
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,470
Zhou Yu's brilliant strategy is one of its kind,

488
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,770
he gave away the Princess and a his soldiers' lives.

489
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,970

490
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,300

491
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,380
Zhou Yu's brilliant strategy is one of its kind,

492
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:36,250
Commander-in-Chief!

493
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,800
- What should we do? <br>- That's right! What should we do?

494
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,370
Retreat.

495
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:45,000
Retreat! Let's go!

496
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,230
Brother.

497
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,880
Respectful madam,

498
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,390
please accept my salutation.

499
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:04,380
Please accept my salutation.

500
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,160
Second Brother, Third Brother, you don't need to be this courteous.

501
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,480
I have long heard that you two are generals of unparalelled prowess.

502
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,870
Looks like the rumours are true.

503
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:21,530
I am just a soldier.

504
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:25,960
If not for Big Brother, people would still know me as a butcher.

505
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,890
Madam, Third Brother is a straightforward man. Please don't mind him.

506
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:35,690
Being straightforward is a good thing.

507
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,930
The story of how you three became brothers in the Peach Garden

508
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,020
has become a well known folk tale.

509
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,540
I'm thankful that my husband has you two by his side

510
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,500
If not, he wouldn't has accomplished so much.

511
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,010
I should properly thank you.

512
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:54,360
Since sister-in-law is already married to Brother,

513
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,740
we are one family. There's no need to thank us.
