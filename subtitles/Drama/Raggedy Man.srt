1
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:41,880
Come on, Harry. Come on, honey.

2
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:26,216
For over three years now,

3
00:03:26,217 --> 00:03:29,119
I have run...

4
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,690
this office.

5
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:36,727
I make...

6
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:39,096
fifty-five...

7
00:03:39,097 --> 00:03:41,331
dollars...

8
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:44,201
a month...

9
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:46,236
Which is not enough to keep a boy alive.

10
00:03:46,237 --> 00:03:49,975
Good morning, Miss Waller. Just a moment.

11
00:03:56,147 --> 00:03:59,216
I am hoping...

12
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:04,188
you had a chance...

13
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:08,659
to look into...

14
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,762
a transfer...

15
00:04:13,198 --> 00:04:15,399
for...

16
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,370
As we've discussed all these
months since I took this job.

17
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:02,780
I swear, Henry. Why is it
you're always up in that tree?

18
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:05,482
I'm looking for Tojo. Have you seen him?

19
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:08,920
No, I certainly ain't seen Tojo.

20
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:11,923
Hey, wait a minute.

21
00:05:14,926 --> 00:05:18,363
Damn, boy. Watch that
fool thing, will ya?

22
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,967
Here's what they look like.

23
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:25,470
Why don't you plant a
garden or somethin'?

24
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:38,015
No, sir. I'm not getting
an answer on that line.

25
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:40,250
Would you like me
to place the call again later?

26
00:05:40,251 --> 00:05:43,453
You oughta keep them two boys
of yours in the backyard.

27
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:46,156
We can't have them bothering
everybody that walks up here.

28
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:49,093
Good morning, Mr. Rigby.
Bad for business.

29
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:51,762
Henry settin' up in that tree all day!

30
00:05:51,763 --> 00:05:53,530
He looks like a damn idiot!

31
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:57,434
Well, if looks were gold, you wouldn't
exactly be a rich man yourself,

32
00:05:57,435 --> 00:05:59,404
would you, Mr. Rigby?

33
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:03,874
These the receipts? Yes, sir.

34
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,542
Mama. Would you like a cup of coffee?

35
00:06:05,543 --> 00:06:07,978
Mama. No, thank you.

36
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,281
Mama. Honey, I'm at work now.

37
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:19,556
Mr. Rigby, you know my situation.

38
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:21,926
I'm a divorced woman... A
war is going on, Nita.

39
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:25,229
Nobody's on easy street.
Yes, sir. I know that.

40
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,264
But I've got two fine young
boys to think about.

41
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:29,868
Harold Allen and... William Henry!

42
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:34,071
Henry's gonna be
in the first grade this year.

43
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:36,041
Harry's gonna be... Yes, sir. I know that!

44
00:06:39,344 --> 00:06:41,345
Well, what I was wondering is...

45
00:06:41,346 --> 00:06:43,547
have you had any luck
on that transfer for me?

46
00:06:43,548 --> 00:06:46,116
I'm workin' on it.

47
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:48,219
Yes, sir.

48
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:52,222
Well, how you doin' on it?

49
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:54,893
Something'll turn up.

50
00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:00,165
I don't see where Clarence
Miller paid this month.

51
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,801
He paid. It's there.

52
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:08,338
Yeah. Here it is.

53
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:10,474
If it was a snake, it woulda
jumped up and bit ya.

54
00:07:10,475 --> 00:07:13,377
The transfer, Mr. Rigby, remember?

55
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:16,147
We talked about something
secretarial with regular hours?

56
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:28,893
This is me typin', Mr. Rigby.

57
00:07:28,894 --> 00:07:31,996
Look, Herman Calloway's late again.

58
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:33,998
You tell him if he can't pay on time,

59
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:36,901
we'll just have to disconnect him.

60
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:40,570
Mr. Rigby, I'm sure I could get another
job somewhere else if you'd ju...

61
00:07:40,571 --> 00:07:43,941
I'm sorry, Nita, but you're frozen here.

62
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:46,344
Yes, sir.

63
00:07:48,413 --> 00:07:51,315
But they might just change my
status if you'd recommend it.

64
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:53,650
Mr. Rigby.

65
00:07:53,651 --> 00:07:56,987
I'd really like to situate
myself in a better situation.

66
00:07:56,988 --> 00:08:00,525
The way things are now, I hardly get a
chance to kiss my boys good night without...

67
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,628
Number, please.

68
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:06,997
One moment. I'll connect you.

69
00:08:06,998 --> 00:08:08,967
Mr. Rigby?

70
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:03,921
Pool shooters and domino players.
And beer drinkers!

71
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:10,160
Hey, Arnold, look. There's
her two little boys again.

72
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:13,231
Hey! You boys, what are you lookin' at?

73
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:18,135
Hey, hang on there. Where're
y'all goin' so fast?

74
00:09:18,136 --> 00:09:21,471
Home. Home? Home to Mama?

75
00:09:21,472 --> 00:09:23,640
That ain't no bad deal.

76
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:25,976
Why ain't y'all off fighting the war?

77
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:28,446
You're a real little smart
aleck, you know that?

78
00:09:29,614 --> 00:09:31,615
I don't like him, Calvin.

79
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:34,184
Come on, Henry. We've gotta go.

80
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:36,253
Hey. Y'all don't want an
Orange Crush or somethin'?

81
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:39,323
I'll take me an Orange Crush.
You're gonna have to win it.

82
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:41,325
We ain't gonna just give it to you.

83
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:44,128
Come on, Henry. They're just teasing you.

84
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:46,296
What do I have to do?

85
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:49,033
Set down there with your
legs around this puddle.

86
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:51,135
We'll show you.

87
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:53,170
It's an old Indian game, ain't it, Cal?

88
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:55,706
Yep. I learned it from an Indian chief.

89
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:59,443
Now, here's the bet.

90
00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:04,282
I bet Arnold there can wipe up that
puddle before you can stab his hand.

91
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:08,518
Henry, let's go. You
just hold your horses.

92
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,089
Okay, you ready? We got a
Orange Crush on the line here.

93
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,658
- I don't wanna hurt him.
- You're not gonna hurt him.

94
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:17,327
No, he likes it.

95
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:20,165
Yeah, I like it. Makes my hand feel good.

96
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:31,776
Looky here! This boy wet his britches!

97
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:43,587
I hope old Tojo gets you!

98
00:10:43,588 --> 00:10:46,123
You better git, you little monkey,

99
00:10:46,124 --> 00:10:48,525
before I take a mind
to paddle your behind.

100
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:50,628
You and your brother both!

101
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:59,270
Loony old raggedy man son of a bitch.

102
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:54,292
Where you been? Out back, takin' a leak.

103
00:11:57,162 --> 00:12:00,765
I'm about ready to ask her out.
Ain't you?

104
00:12:06,704 --> 00:12:09,706
Tonight? Yeah, tonight. What the hell?

105
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:11,808
We can't put it off forever.

106
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:13,711
I don't know.

107
00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:20,284
Well, what are you afraid of?
Every time, you back off.

108
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:23,920
She won't go. Ain't no need to ask her.

109
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:26,590
How you know that? Hell,
you don't even know her!

110
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:30,627
I don't care.

111
00:12:30,628 --> 00:12:34,564
She ain't goin' out with us.
Nobody else, neither.

112
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:37,301
She keepin' herself special.

113
00:12:37,302 --> 00:12:39,769
Arnold.

114
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,905
You remember how we
used to get to itchin'...

115
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:45,742
when they had us in them tight
little cells in Huntsville?

116
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:49,914
Same thing happens to a woman. Especially
one that's already been married.

117
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:53,517
Know what I'm sayin'?

118
00:12:53,518 --> 00:12:55,620
She ain't that way.

119
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,459
Arnold, she's just like us.

120
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,229
She ain't got nobody.

121
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,298
You'd like to do her
a favor, wouldn't you?

122
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:36,293
Arnold, how's it gonna look, both of
us goin' up there to ask her out?

123
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:39,229
Well, it's both of us gonna
be takin' her out, ain't it?

124
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,931
Yeah, but you better
let me do the askin'!

125
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:45,669
Hell, I can do the askin' as
good as anybody can, by God!

126
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,240
Fine, then, Arnold. Go on
up there and do the askin'.

127
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:29,313
Yes? Mrs. Longley?

128
00:14:29,314 --> 00:14:31,615
Yes. Could I help you? My
name's Calvin Triplett.

129
00:14:31,616 --> 00:14:35,285
General haulin'. Maybe you seen
my truck goin' by sometime.

130
00:14:35,286 --> 00:14:37,321
Do you need to use the phone, Mr.
Triplett?

131
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:40,724
No. I was just hopin'
to talk to you for a minute.

132
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:42,659
Yes?

133
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,761
I mean, how ya doin'?

134
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:46,963
Everything goin' okay?

135
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:49,599
Just fine.

136
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,936
I was wonderin' if maybe you wouldn't
like to go out with me sometime?

137
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:55,972
Well, I...

138
00:14:55,973 --> 00:14:58,742
I work most of the time.
I don't get to go out much.

139
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:01,811
That must get old, all that workin'.

140
00:15:01,812 --> 00:15:04,914
It's all right. There's a war.

141
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:09,319
Yeah, I know. Everybody gotta
take a break once in a while.

142
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,622
You oughta let me take you out and show
you a good time one of these nights.

143
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:15,892
I know how it gets, bein'
all cooped up like you are.

144
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:18,828
I'm sorry. It's nice of
you to offer, though.

145
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:20,997
Good night. How 'bout if I
brought you a Coke sometime?

146
00:15:20,998 --> 00:15:22,999
We could sit in there and visit.

147
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,034
What would you think about that?

148
00:15:25,035 --> 00:15:27,837
That'd be fine, but this
is a company here.

149
00:15:27,838 --> 00:15:30,440
They don't permit people
comin' in to visit,

150
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:32,543
you know, unless it's
strictly... strictly business.

151
00:15:33,978 --> 00:15:37,547
- All business in there?
- Yeah.

152
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:41,518
I mean, we live here,
but it is a business.

153
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,821
I guess I'll just have to think up
some business with you, won't I?

154
00:15:44,822 --> 00:15:47,324
I have to go now,
Mr. Triplett. Good night.

155
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,021
I told you she wasn't that way.

156
00:16:18,022 --> 00:16:20,858
She's gotta work. Ain't
got time to go out.

157
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:26,396
I'm gonna go up there
and talk to her sometime.

158
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:28,999
Nothin' else. Just talk a little.

159
00:17:57,655 --> 00:18:00,056
Yes?

160
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:05,596
I'm sorry to wake you. The man at the gas
station said you had a pay phone here.

161
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:12,903
Okay.

162
00:18:14,271 --> 00:18:16,873
Phone's over there.

163
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:18,743
I appreciate it.

164
00:18:19,877 --> 00:18:22,078
I'm sorry. That's okay.

165
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,047
Just give me a minute.

166
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:25,950
Thank you, ma'am.

167
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:42,800
Number, please.

168
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:47,071
Is that you, ma'am?

169
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:52,709
Sorry, habit.

170
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:57,547
That's n... That's number 1-8-2.
It's in Ardmore, Oklahoma.

171
00:18:57,548 --> 00:19:00,316
Operator, this is number zero in Gregory.

172
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:02,819
The number is 1-8-2.

173
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,188
Ardmore, Oklahoma. My party's holding.

174
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:07,323
It'll be just a minute.

175
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:10,827
That's gonna be 65 cents for the first
three minutes after they answer.

176
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:12,863
Yes, ma'am.

177
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:17,534
It's ringing.

178
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:22,005
Maybe nobody's home.

179
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:24,742
They're probably asleep.

180
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:29,112
Hello, Mr. Quinn?

181
00:19:29,113 --> 00:19:31,648
This is Teddy.

182
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:34,083
I'm callin' from Texas.

183
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:36,853
Yes, sir, I sure am fine. How are you?

184
00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:40,590
That's good. I'm glad.

185
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:42,759
That's real good.

186
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,728
Mr. Quinn, may I speak to Jalene?

187
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:46,896
I'm hitchhikin' in from Texas.

188
00:19:46,897 --> 00:19:50,567
I got a four-day liberty, and I want
to let her know I'm on the way.

189
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,371
Sir?

190
00:19:55,372 --> 00:19:58,042
Well, why not, Mr. Quinn?

191
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,712
Sir?

192
00:20:03,313 --> 00:20:06,617
When was that, Mr. Quinn?

193
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:10,855
Mr. Quinn, you're teasin' me.

194
00:20:17,327 --> 00:20:19,295
No, sir...

195
00:20:19,296 --> 00:20:22,266
No, sir, I guess you wouldn't.

196
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,138
Who to, Mr. Quinn?

197
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,844
Him? Really?

198
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:39,183
Yeah.

199
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:47,023
No, no...

200
00:20:47,024 --> 00:20:51,729
No, I'm all right. Just kinda
caught me off guard, I guess.

201
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:58,836
W-Well, I know Mrs. Quinn
always liked him a lot.

202
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:03,340
Yes, sir. I know that.

203
00:21:04,942 --> 00:21:07,110
Well, you must be proud.

204
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:09,313
That guy's got a big
reputation around town.

205
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:14,383
Yeah.

206
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:18,022
People say he's the sorriest son
of a bitch in Ardmore, Oklahoma.

207
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:29,934
All through?

208
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:34,739
Yeah.

209
00:21:40,244 --> 00:21:43,112
You better hang up.
You're still on long distance.

210
00:21:43,113 --> 00:21:45,282
Thanks.

211
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:49,253
Sixty-five cents?

212
00:21:53,123 --> 00:21:55,292
Let's see here.

213
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:01,165
There's twenty-five,

214
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:06,402
fifty... and sixty-five.

215
00:22:06,403 --> 00:22:09,439
Thank you. Thank you.

216
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:14,779
I appreciate it.

217
00:22:17,214 --> 00:22:19,182
Would you like a cup of coffee?

218
00:22:19,183 --> 00:22:21,150
Maybe the rain'll
slow down out there in a bit.

219
00:22:21,151 --> 00:22:23,820
Well...

220
00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:26,923
What's a little water
to a sailor, anyway?

221
00:22:26,924 --> 00:22:29,026
Thanks, though.

222
00:22:39,336 --> 00:22:42,305
Sugar? No, I wouldn't want
to take any of your sugar.

223
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:45,108
That's okay. I don't get the
chance to bake much anyway.

224
00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:49,012
Besides, I have to hide it or
Henry'll eat it by the handfuls.

225
00:22:49,013 --> 00:22:52,048
Henry's your husband. No, one of my boys.

226
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:56,085
I have two of them. Henry and Harry.

227
00:22:56,086 --> 00:22:58,789
Henry's the little one.

228
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:04,127
Your, husband's off in the war?

229
00:23:04,128 --> 00:23:05,963
No, I'm divorced.

230
00:23:13,237 --> 00:23:15,538
- Look at me.
- Let me get you another cup.

231
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:18,175
No, this is just the way I like it.

232
00:23:25,015 --> 00:23:27,017
You just out of boot camp?

233
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,592
I'm gonna be a gunner's mate.

234
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,898
For heaven's sakes.

235
00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:44,534
It'll come back on in a minute.

236
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:53,276
You there?

237
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:55,245
Yeah, yeah, I'm right here.

238
00:23:57,014 --> 00:23:59,282
What's a gunner's mate?

239
00:23:59,283 --> 00:24:02,118
That's the guy that passes him the ammo.

240
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:04,488
Yeah.

241
00:24:05,956 --> 00:24:08,524
Passes who the ammo?

242
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:12,129
The gunner. Yeah.

243
00:24:14,164 --> 00:24:17,200
When are you shipping out?
I got three more days.

244
00:24:17,201 --> 00:24:19,102
You know where you're going?

245
00:24:19,103 --> 00:24:21,637
No.

246
00:24:21,638 --> 00:24:24,308
I guess I'll find out
when I get there, though.

247
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,879
They don't tell us much.

248
00:24:37,454 --> 00:24:40,324
- Do you want a Lucky?
- No, thank you.

249
00:24:41,992 --> 00:24:43,960
I'm Teddy Roebuck, Ardmore, Oklahoma.

250
00:24:43,961 --> 00:24:46,863
Nita Longley, Gregory, Texas.

251
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,605
The lights. Yeah.

252
00:24:58,475 --> 00:25:00,945
Well, I'll put your sugar up. Okay.

253
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:18,228
I appreciate the coffee.
That's all right.

254
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:25,135
Good luck. Thanks.

255
00:26:16,486 --> 00:26:19,656
Look. What's that? I don't know.

256
00:26:22,459 --> 00:26:26,662
Who are you? Put those hands up!

257
00:26:26,663 --> 00:26:30,633
Yeah, look. I don't want any trouble.
I'm just passin' through town.

258
00:26:30,634 --> 00:26:32,701
Hey, you're a sailor. You bet.

259
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:35,238
You better keep those hands up!

260
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:38,707
Henry, you can put the gun down now.
He's one of ours.

261
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:41,477
Thank you. Boys, run get Mrs.
Lester right quick.

262
00:26:41,478 --> 00:26:45,148
It's Washington. Look,
I hope you don't mind.

263
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:47,517
I laid down... No, that's okay.

264
00:27:07,604 --> 00:27:09,673
Hurry, Jean.

265
00:27:17,414 --> 00:27:19,615
Is it Jim? Jim?

266
00:27:19,616 --> 00:27:21,750
Jean, hurry, they're holding.

267
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:25,055
Here. Wha...

268
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:33,630
Operator, your call is ready.
I'll connect you.

269
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:41,505
I don't know.

270
00:27:47,744 --> 00:27:50,180
Hello?

271
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:53,450
Yes, it is.

272
00:27:58,422 --> 00:28:00,324
What did you do to her?

273
00:28:07,164 --> 00:28:09,666
Thank you. Thank you!

274
00:28:11,268 --> 00:28:13,836
Her husband's been wounded,
but he's comin' home.

275
00:28:13,837 --> 00:28:16,406
Well, that's just fine.

276
00:28:22,246 --> 00:28:24,381
Why don't you boys walk Jean home, okay?

277
00:28:26,216 --> 00:28:28,217
You ain't leavin', are ya?

278
00:28:28,218 --> 00:28:30,819
Well... You wait right here.
We'll be right back.

279
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,523
All right.

280
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:47,203
Boy.

281
00:28:47,204 --> 00:28:49,505
You get a little bit of everything
through here, don't you?

282
00:28:49,506 --> 00:28:51,875
Yeah. Seems like it sometimes.

283
00:28:55,645 --> 00:28:57,647
You get a lot of phone calls like that?

284
00:28:59,683 --> 00:29:01,685
Yeah.

285
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:36,653
He's kinda messed up.

286
00:29:39,656 --> 00:29:42,191
Faster, Mommy, faster.

287
00:29:42,192 --> 00:29:45,861
Shoot. I'm hurryin' as
fast as I can, honey.

288
00:29:45,862 --> 00:29:48,265
Okay.

289
00:29:54,404 --> 00:29:56,506
Okay!

290
00:30:16,726 --> 00:30:19,396
Faster, Teddy, faster!

291
00:30:21,665 --> 00:30:23,533
Faster, Teddy, faster!

292
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:19,855
Hey, Mama. Come on!

293
00:31:19,856 --> 00:31:23,293
Yeah, come on, Mama. No, honey, I can't.

294
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:28,297
Please? Yeah, please?

295
00:31:28,298 --> 00:31:30,633
Come on.

296
00:31:30,634 --> 00:31:32,468
Please?

297
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:34,571
Okay.

298
00:31:41,345 --> 00:31:43,412
Here, Nita. Take it. No.

299
00:31:43,413 --> 00:31:45,882
No, take it, take it.

300
00:31:47,984 --> 00:31:49,986
All right, run with it!

301
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:57,661
Run with it! Come on!

302
00:32:03,032 --> 00:32:04,968
I'm gonna answer that.

303
00:32:06,803 --> 00:32:08,804
Mama!

304
00:32:08,805 --> 00:32:12,408
Mama.

305
00:32:12,409 --> 00:32:14,378
I'm sorry.

306
00:32:23,353 --> 00:32:25,120
What are we gonna do tomorrow, Teddy?

307
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:27,390
I'm afraid I go back tonight, Harry.

308
00:32:27,391 --> 00:32:29,925
Teddy, don't go. You don't have to go.

309
00:32:29,926 --> 00:32:32,861
Does he, Mama? No, really, now.

310
00:32:32,862 --> 00:32:35,063
I don't wanna wear out my welcome.

311
00:32:35,064 --> 00:32:37,700
You're not gonna wear out your welcome.
Is he, Mama?

312
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:39,502
Honey, Teddy's got
more important things...

313
00:32:39,503 --> 00:32:42,739
See? She said you could stay.
Didn't you, Mama?

314
00:32:48,378 --> 00:32:50,479
Really, you're welcome
to stay if you want to.

315
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,481
See? Will ya?

316
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:55,684
Yeah, will ya? Shoot. Come on!

317
00:32:55,685 --> 00:32:58,153
Well, I got a couple
of days of liberty left.

318
00:32:58,154 --> 00:33:01,390
You sure it's all right, Nita? Really?

319
00:33:01,391 --> 00:33:04,460
No, really, it's fine. We'll just make
a pallet for him in the front room.

320
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:06,462
Hot dog!

321
00:33:06,463 --> 00:33:08,532
Hot dog!

322
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:13,969
Mrs. Longley? Mr. Calloway. How are ya?

323
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,706
I'd be doing better if the end of the
month didn't come around so fast.

324
00:33:17,707 --> 00:33:19,676
Sorry I'm late with this.

325
00:33:21,445 --> 00:33:23,979
Fifteen-twenty, isn't it? Yes, sir.

326
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,549
He owes money.

327
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,785
Fourteen,

328
00:33:30,454 --> 00:33:32,688
50, 75, 15, 10 and 20.

329
00:33:32,689 --> 00:33:34,923
Fifteen-twenty. I'll get your receipt.

330
00:33:34,924 --> 00:33:36,793
Thank you.

331
00:33:44,668 --> 00:33:46,669
Hi.

332
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,171
How ya doin'?

333
00:33:49,172 --> 00:33:52,641
- Just fine. How are you?
- Okay.

334
00:33:52,642 --> 00:33:55,444
This is Teddy. He's stayin' with us.

335
00:33:55,445 --> 00:33:57,747
Well, isn't that nice?

336
00:33:58,715 --> 00:34:01,684
Well... How's the war goin'?

337
00:34:01,685 --> 00:34:03,819
Pretty good.

338
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,522
Sure wished I could be
over there with you boys.

339
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:09,758
Yes, sir. I wish you could too.
I got a store to run.

340
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:13,996
Shirts, shoes, whatnot. You
know how confinin' that is.

341
00:34:13,997 --> 00:34:17,232
But someone's gotta keep
that home front goin'.

342
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:20,235
Yes, sir. We don't necessarily
like it, but we gotta do it.

343
00:34:20,236 --> 00:34:23,071
Yes, sir. We understand that.

344
00:34:23,072 --> 00:34:25,841
Yep. Truth is, don't like it at all.

345
00:34:25,842 --> 00:34:27,676
I'd rather be over there with you boys.

346
00:34:27,677 --> 00:34:29,812
Yes, sir. Well, we know that.

347
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:32,180
Mr. Calloway, got your receipt. Fine.

348
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:34,550
Well, you give 'em a good
lickin' for me, okay?

349
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:36,552
You bet. Nice boy.

350
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:38,721
Brother? Cousin? No.

351
00:34:38,722 --> 00:34:40,923
Mama, is Teddy gonna be our daddy? Henry.

352
00:34:40,924 --> 00:34:44,527
- Just asking.
- Kids.

353
00:34:44,528 --> 00:34:46,530
Yeah, kids.

354
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,568
That don't look good, that...

355
00:34:52,569 --> 00:34:55,538
That young man in there.

356
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:59,775
Mr. Calloway, if it's givin' you any
ideas, why don't you call Mrs. Thompson?

357
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:02,778
She's always glad to hear from
you about this time every day.

358
00:35:02,779 --> 00:35:04,848
Ma'am.

359
00:35:29,906 --> 00:35:33,109
I don't see any spiderwebs.
Better make sure.

360
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,791
It's okay. You go first.

361
00:35:57,867 --> 00:36:00,235
Mama. What, honey?

362
00:36:00,236 --> 00:36:04,240
Is Teddy gonna stay with us?
For a few days he is.

363
00:36:06,242 --> 00:36:08,210
We like him.

364
00:36:08,211 --> 00:36:10,178
I know, honey. I like him too.

365
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:13,616
Do you, Mama?

366
00:36:13,617 --> 00:36:16,218
Old Tojo ain't gonna
get him, is he, Mama?

367
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:18,186
No, I don't think so, honey.

368
00:36:18,187 --> 00:36:21,790
Okay, you kids go to sleep.

369
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:23,693
Hello?

370
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:33,837
Number, please. That thing
was about to eat me up!

371
00:36:36,005 --> 00:36:38,341
Number, please.

372
00:36:41,077 --> 00:36:43,346
I'm sorry.

373
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:49,952
Well? What'd I tell ya?

374
00:36:49,953 --> 00:36:52,988
I thought she weren't supposed
to have no visitors over there.

375
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:54,958
That's the line she give me.

376
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,128
She lied to us. Didn't she, Calvin?

377
00:37:00,129 --> 00:37:02,197
She's a divorced woman, Arnold.

378
00:37:02,198 --> 00:37:04,633
You know about 'em, don't you?

379
00:37:04,634 --> 00:37:06,703
Where the hell you been not to know?

380
00:37:09,305 --> 00:37:11,174
Where you goin'?

381
00:37:24,153 --> 00:37:26,922
Coffee's ready. Can I get you a cup?
I'd love one.

382
00:37:26,923 --> 00:37:28,891
You bet.

383
00:37:28,892 --> 00:37:31,861
You know, today sure has been fun for me.

384
00:37:33,196 --> 00:37:36,733
For the boys too. They're in hog heaven.

385
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,668
Yeah, I know it.

386
00:37:39,669 --> 00:37:44,239
They don't get a chance to play
with much of anybody around here.

387
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,843
Yeah.

388
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:01,725
I don't mean to pry,

389
00:38:03,793 --> 00:38:06,194
but does their daddy ever come visit?

390
00:38:06,195 --> 00:38:08,898
No, he never has.

391
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:12,000
That's a shame.

392
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:16,705
Well, our marriage ended kinda messy.
I guess that's why.

393
00:38:16,706 --> 00:38:19,742
I heard he joined the army
when the war broke out,

394
00:38:19,743 --> 00:38:23,045
but we never heard from him.

395
00:38:23,046 --> 00:38:26,049
I have trouble understandin' that.

396
00:38:48,471 --> 00:38:51,073
Number, please.

397
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:52,942
Hello, Mr. Calloway.

398
00:38:56,345 --> 00:38:58,882
You don't have to worry about that, Mr.
Calloway.

399
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:04,253
Well, I don't listen in
to conversations, anyway.

400
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,525
You could have been talkin' about
shoes and socks, for all I know.

401
00:39:10,526 --> 00:39:12,360
And other dirty laundry.

402
00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:14,529
Yes, sir.

403
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:17,033
Yes, sir, I do know
it's just your business.

404
00:39:19,435 --> 00:39:21,436
Yes, sir, well...

405
00:39:21,437 --> 00:39:24,473
Well, I'll remember that.

406
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:27,844
Yes, sir, I will.

407
00:39:29,512 --> 00:39:31,915
And thank you too.

408
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,799
Thank you. You bet.

409
00:39:53,136 --> 00:39:56,371
Listen. What would you think
about me takin' the boys...

410
00:39:56,372 --> 00:39:59,207
over to Corpus Christi
to see a picture show?

411
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:02,177
Teddy. It's so far.
It's just a few miles.

412
00:40:02,178 --> 00:40:04,980
We can go on the bus.

413
00:40:04,981 --> 00:40:07,582
Well, they'd love it.

414
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:10,152
Neither one of them's ever
seen a picture show before.

415
00:40:10,153 --> 00:40:12,221
All right.

416
00:40:16,025 --> 00:40:17,960
Any chance of you comin' along with us?

417
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:20,028
Goodness, no! Come on and go!

418
00:40:20,029 --> 00:40:22,197
Teddy, I just... I couldn't!

419
00:40:22,198 --> 00:40:25,467
Who'd run this? You can get
somebody to run that thing.

420
00:40:25,468 --> 00:40:28,004
Mr. Rigby'd have a fit.

421
00:40:33,076 --> 00:40:35,143
Hey.

422
00:40:35,144 --> 00:40:38,381
John Wayne.

423
00:40:48,892 --> 00:40:51,928
Teddy. I wish I could, though.

424
00:42:38,434 --> 00:42:41,669
*lf you ever go down Trinidad

425
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:44,706
*They make you feel so very glad *

426
00:42:44,707 --> 00:42:47,442
*Calypso sing and make up rhyme *

427
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:50,478
*Guarantee you one real good fine time *

428
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:53,715
*Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola *

429
00:42:53,716 --> 00:42:56,584
*Go down Point Cumana

00:42:56,585 --> 00:42:59,988
*Both mother and daughter *

431
00:42:59,989 --> 00:43:05,260
*Workin' for the Yankee dollar *

432
00:43:05,261 --> 00:43:08,363
*Beat it, mon, beat it *

433
00:43:08,364 --> 00:43:11,699
*Since the Yankee come to Trinidad *

434
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,769
*They got the young girls all goin' mad *

435
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:17,572
*Young girls say they treat 'em nice *

436
00:43:17,573 --> 00:43:20,475
*Make Trinidad like paradise

437
00:43:20,476 --> 00:43:23,578

00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:26,614

00:43:26,615 --> 00:43:29,617
*Both mother and daughter

00:43:29,618 --> 00:43:34,422
*Workin' for the Yankee dollar *

441
00:43:34,423 --> 00:43:38,393
*You vex me, you vex me *

442
00:43:38,394 --> 00:43:42,331
Comin' in low. Hey, hey! Get up! Get up!

443
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,597
Is that what happens?

444
00:45:20,896 --> 00:45:23,632
What the hell...

445
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:45,287
Start working Selby and Maclntosh as a team.
They're about ready.

446
00:45:45,288 --> 00:45:47,289
Okay, Jim. Don't worry about a thing.

447
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,391
I'll try and take care
of things while you're away.

448
00:45:49,392 --> 00:45:52,694
Okay. And no gin rummy with Brooke!

449
00:45:52,695 --> 00:45:55,397
She's my pigeon.

450
00:45:55,398 --> 00:45:57,333
'Bye, pigeon.

451
00:46:23,892 --> 00:46:26,694
There's no one out there, Mrs. Longley.

452
00:46:26,695 --> 00:46:29,264
Well, there was somebody.

453
00:46:29,265 --> 00:46:32,334
And there was that man kinda
watching the house this afternoon.

454
00:46:32,335 --> 00:46:34,336
What man is that?

455
00:46:34,337 --> 00:46:36,938
He pushes a lawn mower around town.

456
00:46:36,939 --> 00:46:39,207
You mean Bailey? Face all buggered up?

457
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:41,476
Well, I never saw that.

458
00:46:41,477 --> 00:46:43,745
I think he's all right.

459
00:46:43,746 --> 00:46:47,382
Been around here a couple of
years, mowin' lawns and stuff.

460
00:46:47,383 --> 00:46:50,585
You just had a window peeker.
I wouldn't worry about it.

461
00:46:50,586 --> 00:46:53,321
Wait a minute, Sheriff!

462
00:46:53,322 --> 00:46:55,290
I do worry about it.

463
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:58,761
I'm in here by myself
with just two little boys.

464
00:46:59,995 --> 00:47:03,365
Well.

465
00:47:03,366 --> 00:47:06,434
It was my understanding that,

466
00:47:06,435 --> 00:47:08,803
you had a young friend over
here... a sailor, I believe.

467
00:47:08,804 --> 00:47:12,207
People do talk, Mrs. Longley.

468
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,446
And what do they say?

469
00:47:18,981 --> 00:47:22,517
Well, they say...

470
00:47:22,518 --> 00:47:25,720
- An experienced woman like yourself is...
- You mean a divorced woman.

471
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:30,325
A divorced woman like yourself has got no
business with some young boy over here.

472
00:47:30,326 --> 00:47:33,027
It's nobody's business what I do.

473
00:47:33,028 --> 00:47:35,363
This town doesn't own me.

474
00:47:35,364 --> 00:47:38,866
Well, people wondering what kind
of deal you run over here, anyway.

475
00:47:38,867 --> 00:47:44,539
This is a telephone office. They want
to feel like they can depend on you.

476
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,574
There's a war going on, you know.

477
00:47:46,575 --> 00:47:49,644
Well, thank you for coming by,
Sheriff Watson.

478
00:47:49,645 --> 00:47:51,780
Good night. Good night.

479
00:48:55,678 --> 00:48:59,448
Up. Give me your gum.

480
00:49:26,742 --> 00:49:29,577
Those are the cutest little sailor suits.

481
00:49:29,578 --> 00:49:32,780
You shouldn't have done that.

482
00:49:32,781 --> 00:49:35,684
Listen, I was glad to do it.

483
00:49:58,641 --> 00:50:01,543
I brought you something too.

484
00:50:01,544 --> 00:50:03,712
It's for me? Yeah.

485
00:50:05,781 --> 00:50:10,586
What is it? I'm not gonna tell ya.
You gotta open it and see.

486
00:50:22,465 --> 00:50:24,632
Nylons.

487
00:50:24,633 --> 00:50:27,535
Well, they're rayons.

488
00:50:27,536 --> 00:50:32,173
But the lady at the store said they
was just as sheer as nylons, though.

489
00:50:32,174 --> 00:50:36,945
They are! Look how sheer they are.

490
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:45,246
*lf there's a gleam in her eye *

491
00:51:45,247 --> 00:51:49,083
*Each time she straightens your tie *

492
00:51:49,084 --> 00:51:52,720
*You'll know the lady's in love *

493
00:51:52,721 --> 00:51:55,958
*With you

494
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:08,302
*...the lady's in love with you *

495
00:52:08,303 --> 00:52:12,206
*And when your friends ask you over *

496
00:52:12,207 --> 00:52:16,177
*To join their table

497
00:52:16,178 --> 00:52:21,916
*But she picks a faraway booth for two *

498
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:25,920
*Well, sir, here's just how it stands *

499
00:52:25,921 --> 00:52:29,223
*You've got romance on your hands *

500
00:52:29,224 --> 00:52:32,727
*Because the lady's in love *

501
00:52:32,728 --> 00:52:35,798
*With you.

502
00:53:41,329 --> 00:53:45,700
One, two, three, heil Hitler!

503
00:53:45,701 --> 00:53:50,071
One, two, three, heil Hitler!

504
00:53:50,072 --> 00:53:53,675
One, two, three, heil Hitler!

505
00:53:53,676 --> 00:53:57,745
Morning, Miss Pud, Miss Beulah!
One, two, three, heil Hitler!

506
00:53:57,746 --> 00:54:01,182
Boys, stop that. One,
two, three, heil, Hitle!

507
00:54:01,183 --> 00:54:04,218
Did you hear me? Henry! One, two, three,

508
00:54:04,219 --> 00:54:06,353
heil Hitler!

509
00:54:06,354 --> 00:54:09,390
I want y'all to march in the
house right this instant...

510
00:54:09,391 --> 00:54:12,193
and wash those silly
moustaches off your faces.

511
00:54:12,194 --> 00:54:15,798
Heil Hitler! We're just playin', Mama.

512
00:54:17,866 --> 00:54:20,902
They saw it in a newsreel, Nita.

513
00:54:20,903 --> 00:54:24,405
Lord, Teddy. Couldn't
you've just stayed inside?

514
00:54:24,406 --> 00:54:26,675
Why?

515
00:54:29,211 --> 00:54:31,378
Hi. How y'all doin'?

516
00:54:31,379 --> 00:54:34,116
Well, I never!

517
00:54:40,088 --> 00:54:43,725
I'm sorry.

518
00:54:43,726 --> 00:54:48,295
Cripes! Use some sense, walkin'
out in front of them half naked.

519
00:54:48,296 --> 00:54:51,432
I just put my shirt on.

520
00:54:51,433 --> 00:54:54,269
I've gotta live here, Teddy.

521
00:54:57,105 --> 00:54:59,274
And there's already enough talk.

522
00:55:04,813 --> 00:55:07,348
Excuse me. Good morning.

523
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:09,451
Was a good morning.

524
00:55:14,389 --> 00:55:16,759
Are ya in?

525
00:55:21,163 --> 00:55:23,364
I'll tell you what.

526
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:26,233
You guys get on home with the
groceries, and I'll go get the mail.

527
00:55:26,234 --> 00:55:28,235
Pick a hand.

528
00:55:28,236 --> 00:55:30,838
Open your mouth.

529
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:33,375
Okay, see you at home. Okay.

530
00:55:53,461 --> 00:55:56,430
*You're in the navy now
You're not behind the plow *

531
00:55:56,431 --> 00:55:59,234
*Digging a ditch You'll never get
rich You're in the navy now *

532
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:07,942
Well, now, would you look here, Arnold?

533
00:56:07,943 --> 00:56:10,244
Them damn boys went and joined the navy.

534
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:13,380
Got 'em tiny little
sailor suits, don't they?

535
00:56:13,381 --> 00:56:15,549
Y'all better get out of the way.

536
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:18,786
Now, we just tryin' to be friendly.

537
00:56:18,787 --> 00:56:21,355
We figure maybe we owe you
them Orange Crushes...

538
00:56:21,356 --> 00:56:24,025
for that joke we played
on you the other day.

539
00:56:24,026 --> 00:56:26,227
It wasn't funny!

540
00:56:26,228 --> 00:56:28,963
Wasn't funny at all, was it?

541
00:56:28,964 --> 00:56:32,566
Well, come on in here and
let us make it up to you, then.

542
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:36,804
No, Henry. Let's go. Come on.
Let's have an Orange Crush.

543
00:56:36,805 --> 00:56:40,208
Y'all come on. Ain't often we treat.

544
00:56:41,877 --> 00:56:44,045
Henry, I said no!

545
00:56:44,046 --> 00:56:46,849
You're not the boss of me!

546
00:56:52,988 --> 00:56:57,192
Give us an Orange Crush
for this sailor boy.

547
00:57:01,396 --> 00:57:03,798
He's about to ship out.

548
00:57:06,534 --> 00:57:09,971
How's that drink? All right? Just fine.

549
00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:13,941
How's that mama of yours been doin'?

550
00:57:13,942 --> 00:57:18,345
Just fine. She got her boyfriend
stayin' over there with her?

551
00:57:18,346 --> 00:57:21,615
You mean Teddy?

552
00:57:21,616 --> 00:57:23,852
Come on, Henry.

553
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:29,123
They been takin' their clothes
off together over there?

554
00:57:29,124 --> 00:57:32,860
Don't fool with these boys. Come on, Henry.
We gotta go.

555
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:35,429
You ain't goin' nowhere.

556
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:39,333
You let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

557
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:41,969
- You want your butt whipped?
- No, he don't.

558
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:44,371
Teddy!

559
00:57:44,372 --> 00:57:47,541
Goddamn, if it ain't the rest
of the U.S. Navy, Arnold!

560
00:57:47,542 --> 00:57:50,245
Harry, go stand by the door.

561
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,649
Henry, you get down off the bar.

562
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:59,120
We're talkin' here. Ain't we?

563
00:57:59,121 --> 00:58:02,423
- I'm gonna kick you if you don't move.
- Henry?

564
00:58:02,424 --> 00:58:05,260
You ain't gonna do no
such damn thing. Yeah?

565
00:58:14,102 --> 00:58:17,472
Back off, you boys!

566
00:58:50,472 --> 00:58:54,009
Teddy!

567
00:58:59,381 --> 00:59:03,417
Let go of me! Goddamn it!

568
00:59:03,418 --> 00:59:07,489
Let me go! Teddy! Teddy!

569
00:59:10,592 --> 00:59:15,130
Siguiente van a ser tu sesos.
Agarre tu hermano y vete pronto.

570
00:59:27,442 --> 00:59:30,244
Thank you.

571
00:59:30,245 --> 00:59:32,314
Come on.

572
00:59:39,521 --> 00:59:42,290
Don't, Nita!

573
00:59:46,762 --> 00:59:51,766
Good night nurse, Harry! What were you kids
thinkin' of goin' into a place like that?

574
00:59:51,767 --> 00:59:56,471
I just can't get over it. What
were you thinkin' of, Harry?

575
00:59:56,472 --> 00:59:58,806
Nothin'. Nothin'?

576
00:59:58,807 --> 01:00:01,843
You weren't thinkin' of nothin',
were you? Henry?

577
01:00:01,844 --> 01:00:06,080
I wasn't thinkin'
of nothin', either, Mama.

578
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:09,050
Well, from now on, I want you kids here!

579
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:12,787
I do not want you gallivantin'
all over this town!

580
01:00:12,788 --> 01:00:17,825
That's over and done with. I want you
here, or in the yard and nowhere else!

581
01:00:17,826 --> 01:00:20,762
- But, Mama...
- No, sir.

582
01:00:20,763 --> 01:00:23,998
Not one word, Harry. I won't have it!

583
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:26,801
As old as you are, not showin'
any more sense than a rock.

584
01:00:26,802 --> 01:00:29,104
Nit... Good G... Sorry.

585
01:00:34,076 --> 01:00:36,511
Number, please.

586
01:00:36,512 --> 01:00:39,514
Just scared her. She'll get over it.
Hello, Miss Ola.

587
01:00:39,515 --> 01:00:42,517
No, I'm fine. Can I help you?

588
01:00:42,518 --> 01:00:46,187
Look at these shoes.

589
01:00:46,188 --> 01:00:50,992
How 'bout if you boys were to take these
out on the porch and clean 'em up for me?

590
01:00:50,993 --> 01:00:53,928
Yeah? It's 2:18, Miss Ola.

591
01:00:53,929 --> 01:00:57,999
No, ma'am, I don't believe everything
that comes over the radio, either,

592
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,668
but they're usually
pretty close on the time.

593
01:01:00,669 --> 01:01:03,471
Yes, ma'am. You're welcome.

594
01:01:03,472 --> 01:01:06,174
You kids, do not leave this yard!

595
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,082
Don't be too hard on 'em, Nita.

596
01:01:15,083 --> 01:01:18,486
I can't keep an eye on this
switchboard and them too...

597
01:01:18,487 --> 01:01:21,589
if they're runnin' here,
there and yon all over town.

598
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:24,959
Yeah, well, you can't lock 'em up, either.
They're just kids.

599
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,996
I know they're kids, Teddy.
They happen to be my kids!

600
01:01:28,997 --> 01:01:31,265
I meant what I said.

601
01:01:31,266 --> 01:01:34,870
And don't you go tellin'
'em anything different.

602
01:01:44,212 --> 01:01:49,150
God, I feel so... so... caught!

603
01:01:49,151 --> 01:01:53,589
Nita.

604
01:02:01,096 --> 01:02:04,732
Hey, you oughta quit this job.
You can get somethin' better.

605
01:02:04,733 --> 01:02:09,804
I can't quit this job. I'm frozen here.

606
01:02:09,805 --> 01:02:14,308
They can't do that. Can they?

607
01:02:14,309 --> 01:02:17,912
They can do whatever
they want in wartime.

608
01:02:17,913 --> 01:02:22,784
Look what they're doin' to you. They're stickin'
you on a ship, you don't even know where to.

609
01:02:22,785 --> 01:02:25,721
Yeah, but I wanna go.

610
01:02:26,989 --> 01:02:30,024
I mean, I'm not afraid
to go. Not anymore.

611
01:02:30,025 --> 01:02:33,194
There's a whole world out there
you don't know anything about.

612
01:02:33,195 --> 01:02:37,164
That's okay with me. I'm not
gonna run and hide from it.

613
01:02:37,165 --> 01:02:40,102
No, I know you're not.

614
01:02:46,308 --> 01:02:50,011
I want you to leave, Teddy.

615
01:02:50,012 --> 01:02:52,880
I still got one more day.

616
01:02:52,881 --> 01:02:56,150
No, I want you to go on and go.

617
01:02:56,151 --> 01:02:58,887
This doesn't work for us.

618
01:03:03,025 --> 01:03:07,061
I can't make it work.

619
01:03:07,062 --> 01:03:09,031
I'm sorry.

620
01:03:19,107 --> 01:03:21,308
Here you go, Teddy.

621
01:03:21,309 --> 01:03:23,646
Here you go, Teddy.

622
01:03:26,314 --> 01:03:30,017
Whooee! Don't these look snappy!

623
01:03:30,018 --> 01:03:32,755
Thanks.

624
01:03:58,146 --> 01:04:01,048
You know, maybe some rainy night...

625
01:04:01,049 --> 01:04:04,018
and you'll hear a knock at the door,

626
01:04:04,019 --> 01:04:06,253
it'll be me again.

627
01:04:06,254 --> 01:04:09,190
Maybe. Yeah.

628
01:04:09,191 --> 01:04:12,895
I love you, Nita.

629
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:19,300
Number, please.

630
01:04:19,301 --> 01:04:22,036
Hi, Doc Wood.

631
01:04:22,037 --> 01:04:26,007
Just a minute. Let me
get a piece of paper.

632
01:04:26,008 --> 01:04:29,310
At the Phelps 'til 9:00.

633
01:04:29,311 --> 01:04:33,148
Then to the Higgins.

634
01:04:40,689 --> 01:04:44,792
Where ya goin'? I got a call from a ship.
They want me to come on in.

635
01:04:44,793 --> 01:04:48,195
Do ya have to go? Yeah, I have to.

636
01:04:48,196 --> 01:04:51,132
You don't have to go.

637
01:04:51,133 --> 01:04:53,435
Harry.

638
01:05:03,979 --> 01:05:06,081
Yeah.

639
01:05:09,251 --> 01:05:12,453
You know what I'm gonna do?

640
01:05:12,454 --> 01:05:16,457
I'm gonna name this shoe Henry,

641
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:19,126
and I'm gonna name this shoe Harry.

642
01:05:19,127 --> 01:05:23,330
Henry and Harry? You bet.

643
01:05:23,331 --> 01:05:27,935
And that way, wherever I go, it'll be
Henry and Harry right there with me.

644
01:05:27,936 --> 01:05:30,305
Okay?

645
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:44,119
You take care of your mama.

646
01:05:46,154 --> 01:05:48,791
We will.

647
01:05:59,201 --> 01:06:02,070
Good-bye, pigeon.

648
01:06:08,944 --> 01:06:12,179
Henry and Harry. Henry and Harry.

649
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,481
Henry and Harry. Henry and Harry.

650
01:06:14,482 --> 01:06:17,051
Henry and Harry. Henry and Harry.

651
01:06:17,052 --> 01:06:20,055
Henry and Harry.

652
01:07:06,201 --> 01:07:08,936
Did you make Teddy leave?

653
01:07:08,937 --> 01:07:12,473
Eat your supper, Harry. And, Henry, eat!

654
01:07:12,474 --> 01:07:15,309
You made him leave, didn't you?

655
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:18,145
Honey, he was gonna have
to leave tomorrow anyway.

656
01:07:18,146 --> 01:07:20,481
Now let's just eat our supper, okay?

657
01:07:20,482 --> 01:07:24,485
We're not gonna stay around
the house like you said.

658
01:07:24,486 --> 01:07:28,222
You're gonna do what I tell you to
do, young man. I'm your mother!

659
01:07:28,223 --> 01:07:31,326
You're not a mother,
you're a telephone operator.

660
01:07:33,028 --> 01:07:35,129
I know you're upset, Harry, but things...

661
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:38,099
You made Daddy leave too!

662
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:41,169
Don't talk to me in that tone of voice!

663
01:07:45,107 --> 01:07:49,177
Now eat your supper! Both of you!

664
01:07:55,283 --> 01:07:58,485
We don't wanna live here anymore.

665
01:07:58,486 --> 01:08:02,323
I don't wanna live here, either, Mama.

666
01:08:02,324 --> 01:08:05,526
We wanna go live with our daddy.

667
01:08:05,527 --> 01:08:08,395
Well, whatever gave you
the idea he wants y'all?

668
01:08:08,396 --> 01:08:10,664
Did he write you a letter or somethin'?

669
01:08:10,665 --> 01:08:13,434
I don't hear him knockin' at the door.

670
01:08:13,435 --> 01:08:16,538
He wants me and Henry.
He just don't want you.

671
01:08:23,111 --> 01:08:26,014
We'll just give it to the chickens.

672
01:08:34,022 --> 01:08:37,926
Now go to bed, both of you!
Right this instant!

673
01:08:39,094 --> 01:08:41,263
Come on, Henry.

674
01:10:17,392 --> 01:10:20,194
Mr. Rigby?

675
01:10:20,195 --> 01:10:22,397
Yes, sir, I do know it's late.

676
01:10:41,716 --> 01:10:45,119
Hey, watch out there, kids!

677
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:49,257
What do you think you're doin'?

678
01:10:53,361 --> 01:10:55,663
Come in, Mr. Rigby.

679
01:11:01,236 --> 01:11:04,738
Now, what is it that's so important...

680
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:07,342
I had to come all the way over here?

681
01:11:19,654 --> 01:11:22,323
We've been through all this.

682
01:11:22,324 --> 01:11:26,593
Yes, sir, but you haven't
been listenin' to me.

683
01:11:26,594 --> 01:11:29,396
You know there's a war.

684
01:11:29,397 --> 01:11:34,101
Yes, I know there's a war, and I know
things are bad all over because of the war.

685
01:11:34,102 --> 01:11:38,805
And everybody's gotta work. And you know,
I'm not afraid to work, Mr. Rigby.

686
01:11:38,806 --> 01:11:41,576
Well, this is not a bad place.

687
01:11:44,379 --> 01:11:46,613
I've seen worse.

688
01:11:46,614 --> 01:11:51,652
The boys in the Philippines
don't have it this good, I bet.

689
01:11:51,653 --> 01:11:55,622
No, sir, I'm sure they don't, but
I... Everybody's makin' sacrifices.

690
01:11:55,623 --> 01:11:58,292
I make 'em too. I make 'em all the time.

691
01:11:58,293 --> 01:12:00,394
Yes, sir, but when I took this job,

692
01:12:00,395 --> 01:12:03,564
you said it was gonna lead to
somethin' with regular hours.

693
01:12:03,565 --> 01:12:06,867
This was supposed to be
a stepping-stone, remember?

694
01:12:06,868 --> 01:12:10,204
Don't you get uppity with me now, Nita.

695
01:12:10,205 --> 01:12:13,607
I'm askin' for help, Mr. Rigby.

696
01:12:13,608 --> 01:12:16,743
Now, if the company
can't give me a transfer,

697
01:12:16,744 --> 01:12:19,813
I'd at least like to be free
to look for a job on my own.

698
01:12:19,814 --> 01:12:22,916
Well, you're frozen here, Nita.
It's not my doin'.

699
01:12:22,917 --> 01:12:26,620
They've got laws in wartime.
Now, let's stop this nonsense!

700
01:12:26,621 --> 01:12:28,890
No, sir.

701
01:12:31,593 --> 01:12:36,197
What are you doing? MX, this
is number zero in Gregory.

702
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:38,699
Yes, thank you. I'll hold.

703
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:41,935
My God, Nita, there is a war going on!

704
01:12:41,936 --> 01:12:46,373
Will you please stop tellin' me
there's a war! I know there's a war!

705
01:12:46,374 --> 01:12:48,775
It all comes through here!

706
01:12:48,776 --> 01:12:51,345
Tommy Patterson got his arm blown off!

707
01:12:51,346 --> 01:12:54,181
And Billy Patrick's comin' home in a box!

708
01:12:54,182 --> 01:12:57,951
And Charlie Jones isn't comin' home at all,
because they couldn't find enough pieces!

709
01:12:57,952 --> 01:13:00,887
So don't tell me nothin', Mr. Rigby!

710
01:13:00,888 --> 01:13:05,726
I hear the wives and the mamas and the
daddies cryin' and sayin', "No, no, no!"

711
01:13:05,727 --> 01:13:09,963
I hear it! Day in and day out I hear it!

712
01:13:09,964 --> 01:13:12,933
So don't you stand there
and tell me there's a war!

713
01:13:12,934 --> 01:13:16,470
I can tell you plenty
about there bein' a war!

714
01:13:16,471 --> 01:13:19,540
San Antonio. The number's 2872.

715
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:21,942
Are you callin' the company?

716
01:13:21,943 --> 01:13:25,646
I've got my own boys
to think about, Mr. Rigby.

717
01:13:25,647 --> 01:13:28,715
Yes, personnel office, please.

718
01:13:28,716 --> 01:13:32,753
Nita Longley, you won't get a job anywhere
else. I'll put the word out on you.

719
01:13:32,754 --> 01:13:35,222
Do what you have to do.

720
01:13:35,223 --> 01:13:37,924
Disconnect.

721
01:13:37,925 --> 01:13:40,362
Personnel office?

722
01:13:44,466 --> 01:13:46,633
I'll tell you what, Mr. Rigby.

723
01:13:46,634 --> 01:13:50,404
No law is gonna keep me
from doin' right by my boys.

724
01:13:50,405 --> 01:13:53,507
War or no war, frozen or unfrozen!

725
01:13:53,508 --> 01:13:56,977
You cannot stop me from making this call.

726
01:13:56,978 --> 01:14:00,881
You're not frozen. MX, this
is number zero in Gregory.

727
01:14:00,882 --> 01:14:05,786
You don't make enough money to be frozen.
Yes, thank you. I'll hold.

728
01:14:05,787 --> 01:14:08,656
You're not frozen!

729
01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:21,902
You'd do that to us?

730
01:14:21,903 --> 01:14:26,907
This is a company, Nita!
I've got responsibilities!

731
01:14:26,908 --> 01:14:28,843
A company?

732
01:14:30,678 --> 01:14:33,281
A company!

733
01:14:43,358 --> 01:14:45,427
Excuse me!

734
01:14:46,828 --> 01:14:50,431
You oughta thank your lucky
stars I even gave you a job.

735
01:14:50,432 --> 01:14:53,567
A woman in your situation,
divorced with two kids!

736
01:14:53,568 --> 01:14:57,405
The fact is, Mr. Rigby, that's a
fine situation for me to be in!

737
01:14:59,807 --> 01:15:02,610
Nita, you come back here!

738
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:08,715
Mama, where we goin'?

739
01:15:08,716 --> 01:15:11,819
Yeah, Mama, where we goin'?

740
01:15:41,115 --> 01:15:43,784
Good morning, Mr. Bueford.
Good morning, Mrs. Longley.

741
01:15:43,785 --> 01:15:47,454
I'd like three tickets. One adult and
two child. Where to, Mrs. Longley?

742
01:15:47,455 --> 01:15:49,890
San Antonio. One way.

743
01:15:49,891 --> 01:15:54,027
Will this be today? No,
sir, that'll be tomorrow.

744
01:15:54,028 --> 01:15:56,697
All right. And your bus will leave 7:10,

745
01:15:56,698 --> 01:15:58,999
and that will be six dollars, please.

746
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,369
Okay.

747
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:04,371
Five, six.

748
01:16:04,372 --> 01:16:06,541
Thank you.

749
01:16:08,142 --> 01:16:11,078
Thank you. See you in the morning.

750
01:16:25,092 --> 01:16:27,428
Mornin', Miss Pud, Miss Beulah.

751
01:16:27,429 --> 01:16:30,031
We're moving!

752
01:16:33,801 --> 01:16:36,803
You kids play outside
for a little bit, okay?

753
01:16:36,804 --> 01:16:41,107
Okay.

754
01:16:41,108 --> 01:16:46,012
Nita Longley, don't you ever, ever
leave me settin' there again!

755
01:16:46,013 --> 01:16:49,784
Just who the hell do you think you are?

756
01:16:51,653 --> 01:16:54,722
I'm the lady who just quit this job!
That's who I am!

757
01:17:04,932 --> 01:17:08,102
Y'all come on. We got our packin' to do.

758
01:17:17,445 --> 01:17:21,648
Mama, did our daddy love us?

759
01:17:21,649 --> 01:17:24,651
Maybe we'll find ourselves
a new daddy someday.

760
01:17:24,652 --> 01:17:26,820
You really think so? We just might.

761
01:17:26,821 --> 01:17:30,090
We'll be there watchin'
in case a good one walks by.

762
01:17:30,091 --> 01:17:33,460
Mama, are we gonna live
in a telephone office?

763
01:17:33,461 --> 01:17:36,997
No, sirree! I'm gonna get a job
at one of the military bases.

764
01:17:36,998 --> 01:17:40,033
There's a lot of paperwork during a war.

765
01:17:40,034 --> 01:17:43,571
They need people who can type.
And I can sure type.

766
01:17:45,573 --> 01:17:50,043
William Henry Longley, I'm gonna
paddle your little back porch!

767
01:17:50,044 --> 01:17:53,014
Give me that sugar bowl!

768
01:18:01,756 --> 01:18:06,628
Hey, don't tickle me! No, please, don't!

769
01:19:34,215 --> 01:19:36,717
Could I help you?

770
01:19:36,718 --> 01:19:39,119
Excuse me, ma'am.

771
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:43,857
I'm sorry to be botherin' you this
time of night. I need a telephone.

772
01:19:43,858 --> 01:19:48,695
Well, it's awfully late. We're closed.

773
01:19:48,696 --> 01:19:53,266
I know, ma'am. I'm broke
down out on the highway.

774
01:19:53,267 --> 01:19:56,137
I need to call somebody
to come and git me.

775
01:19:58,339 --> 01:20:00,874
Well, all right.

776
01:20:00,875 --> 01:20:03,844
Just give me a minute, though,

777
01:20:03,845 --> 01:20:06,079
and the phone is, in here on the wall.

778
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,915
Thank you, ma'am.

779
01:20:08,916 --> 01:20:11,052
Thank you.

780
01:20:39,346 --> 01:20:41,816
Number, please.

781
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:48,889
Number, please!

782
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:51,792
Hello?

783
01:20:51,793 --> 01:20:54,661
I don't have a number.

784
01:20:54,662 --> 01:20:57,163
Well, then... what's the name, please?

785
01:20:57,164 --> 01:20:59,834
I'll have to look it up.

786
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:05,740
Nita Longley.

787
01:21:27,461 --> 01:21:30,931
I told you I'd think up some
business with you one of these days.

788
01:21:30,932 --> 01:21:32,900
Didn't I?

789
01:22:01,863 --> 01:22:04,030
I'm gonna have to call the sheriff.

790
01:22:04,031 --> 01:22:06,267
No!

791
01:22:29,456 --> 01:22:33,426
Please. I've got two little boys.

792
01:22:33,427 --> 01:22:36,497
I'll tell you what, ma'am.

793
01:22:38,532 --> 01:22:41,367
You don't give us no trouble,

794
01:22:41,368 --> 01:22:44,271
and we won't give them boys none.

795
01:23:17,471 --> 01:23:20,473
Please don't do this.

796
01:23:20,474 --> 01:23:22,476
Please!

797
01:23:37,024 --> 01:23:39,093
Make 'em bounce.

798
01:23:45,432 --> 01:23:49,336
- Make 'em bounce!
- No!

799
01:23:57,611 --> 01:24:01,482
Mama? Mama!

804
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:59,973

807
01:25:19,393 --> 01:25:21,561

808
01:25:21,562 --> 01:25:24,665
Hey! Who is that?

Where's Harry?

813
01:25:58,299 --> 01:26:00,666
I don't know.

814
01:26:00,667 --> 01:26:04,104
God! He must be outside.

815
01:26:04,105 --> 01:26:06,339
Honey, listen to me.

816
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:10,210
I want you to crawl under the bed and
don't move for nothin', ya hear me?

817
01:26:10,211 --> 01:26:12,445
Not nothin'!

818
01:26:12,446 --> 01:26:15,116
Okay, honey, hurry!

819
01:26:17,484 --> 01:26:22,189
Mama? Mama!

820
01:26:24,725 --> 01:26:27,661
Mama?

821
01:26:31,232 --> 01:26:34,701
Mama, is that you?

822
01:26:44,245 --> 01:26:47,614

823
01:26:49,383 --> 01:26:52,485
Mama! Mama!

824
01:26:52,486 --> 01:26:54,721
Mama!

825
01:27:00,727 --> 01:27:04,630
Harry! Harry! Harry! Run!

826
01:27:04,631 --> 01:27:07,668
Harry, run!

827
01:27:11,705 --> 01:27:14,674
Come on!

828
01:27:14,675 --> 01:27:18,279
Come on, Harry.

829
01:27:25,286 --> 01:27:27,554
Mama.

830
01:27:55,849 --> 01:27:58,619
Come here.

831
01:28:02,289 --> 01:28:04,491
Don't move.

832
01:30:18,692 --> 01:30:21,295
Harry!

833
01:30:50,524 --> 01:30:53,526
Mrs. Longley and the boys all right?

834
01:30:53,527 --> 01:30:57,697
Yeah. Yeah, they're okay.
Still a little scared.

835
01:30:57,698 --> 01:31:02,403
And I don't see any reason to keep
'em around here for this sorry mess.

836
01:31:59,025 --> 01:32:01,994
Our daddy saved us, didn't he, Mama?

837
01:32:01,995 --> 01:32:04,398
Yes, he did, honey.

838
01:32:08,469 --> 01:32:12,473
Must've loved us a I... a lot.

839
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:16,777
More than anybody else in the world.

840
01:32:17,944 --> 01:32:20,313
More than anybody.

841
01:32:28,054 --> 01:32:33,025
Mama, I hope we see Teddy
again someday, don't you?

842
01:32:33,026 --> 01:32:35,861
I hope so too, honey.

843
01:32:35,862 --> 01:32:39,098
Mommy, when are we gonna get there?

844
01:32:39,099 --> 01:32:41,768
Henry!
