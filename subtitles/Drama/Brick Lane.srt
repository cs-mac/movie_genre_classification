1
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,419
<i>I have a song in my head.</i>

2
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:31,212
<i>I remember the songs we used to sing,
my sister and I.</i>

3
00:01:03,543 --> 00:01:08,901
<i>I always said, "I will not marry
and be sent far away."</i>

4
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:12,698
<i>"I will go no further
than these paddy fields."</i>

5
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:21,738
<i>But our mother told us
we must not run from our fate.</i>

6
00:01:23,503 --> 00:01:26,301
<i>What cannot be changed must be borne.</i>

7
00:01:28,503 --> 00:01:31,222
<i>The test of life is to endure.</i>

8
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:58,860
<i>But our mother could not endure.</i>

9
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:40,422
<i>Amma.</i>

10
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:57,059
<i>No one spoke of our mother's death,
and I remembered her saying:</i>

11
00:02:57,188 --> 00:03:02,820
<i>"If Allah wanted us to ask questions
he would have made us men."</i>

12
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:06,020
<i>Our fate was decided then.</i>

13
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:23,185
<i>I was to be grateful when Father chose
me an educated man living abroad.</i>

14
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:31,944
<i>My sister would stay.
I would go.</i>

15
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:34,864
<i>You can spread your soul
over a paddy field.</i>

16
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:37,824
<i>You can feel the earth
beneath your toes</i>

17
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:40,420
<i>and know that this is the place,</i>

18
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:44,147
<i>the place that it begins and ends.</i>

19
00:04:45,873 --> 00:04:49,070
<i>But what can you tell
to a pile of bricks?</i>

20
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:53,707
<i>I think of my sister.
I think of home.</i>

21
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:59,426
<i>My husband promises me
we will be coming home soon.</i>

22
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:49,670
Good.

23
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,796
Good.

24
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,830
I will test you both on
your Tagore tonight.

25
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,107
OK. Abba.

26
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:59,912
Do you hear me. Shahana?

27
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,647
- Abba, will you get
the promotion today?

28
00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:04,317
Verv likely. Verv likely.

29
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,431
- Get your lunchbox.
- OK.

30
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,869
My colleague Wilkie
thinks he will get the iob.

31
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:11,911
Feet up on his desk in
Mr Dalloway's office.

32
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,076
Using the telephone at the lunchtime.

33
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,673
I said to him,
"They need an educated man like me."

34
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,352
They will not pass me over this time.

35
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,948
Shahana. Sit up.

36
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,039
If I just get the promotion confirmed

37
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,391
then many things are possible.

38
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:37,838
Don't cut the meat verv small.

39
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:41,840
I need big pieces tonight
for dinner with Dr Azad.

40
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:48,036
- Good luck with your promotion.
- It's from Auntie Hasina.

41
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:51,718
So, who has your sister
fallen in love with today?

42
00:07:55,882 --> 00:08:00,433
Come on, Bibi, Shahana. Hurry
up. You can't be late for the school.

43
00:08:21,363 --> 00:08:23,957
<i>Do you tell your daughters
the story of the princess</i>

44
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:27,473
<i>who lived seven seas and 13 rivers away?</i>

45
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:31,198
<i>That is how I think of
you in your tall tower.</i>

46
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:33,438
<i>Now I cook for the lute men.</i>

47
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:37,272
<i>I tell them of my sister
living in London.</i>

48
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:43,117
<i>There is one I like.
His skin is like lassi.</i>

49
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:45,280
<i>I can see your worried face.</i>

50
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:47,439
<i>But there is no need.</i>

51
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:52,037
<i>When will you ever come home?</i>

52
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:02,444
Tariq! Stop messing around
with the sewing machine.

53
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:04,283
<i>Acha go Amma!</i>

54
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,202
- Oh, hello, Razia.
- Hello.

55
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:09,078
How do you like living
the other side of the block?

56
00:09:09,205 --> 00:09:12,038
I'll tell you when I've moved in.
How's your hip?

57
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:15,043
Oh. Verv painful.

58
00:09:15,165 --> 00:09:17,474
Oh. Hello. Mrs Ahmed.

59
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:20,324
You two are going to be neighbours.

60
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:23,839
<i>- Salaam-alaikum.
- Salaam.</i>

61
00:09:27,926 --> 00:09:31,236
She keeps herself to herself.
She has two daughters.

62
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:33,039
But she lost her first.

63
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:37,398
Such a boy.
The devil always takes beautiful babies.

64
00:09:37,526 --> 00:09:39,915
Have you heard about Zorina?

65
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:43,960
<i>Allah, place light in my heart,
light in my tongue.</i>

66
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:48,444
<i>Light in my hearing,
light on my right hand. On my left.</i>

67
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:53,594
<i>Light before me, light behind me,
light above me and light below me.</i>

68
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,400
<i>Allah, who knows
the secrets of our hearts.</i>

69
00:09:56,527 --> 00:10:00,156
<i>Lead me out of the darkness
and give me light.</i>

70
00:10:23,969 --> 00:10:25,925
Your coat?

71
00:10:34,888 --> 00:10:36,844
Is everything OK?

72
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,567
I resigned this afternoon.

73
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,443
They do not appreciate my talents.

74
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,813
But I'm not worried.

75
00:10:49,913 --> 00:10:52,643
I have some verv good
leads I will chase...

76
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,566
in the morning.

77
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:03,287
You know. When I left the council office

78
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:06,801
Mr Dalloway shook my hand.

79
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,444
He was sorrv he was losing a good man.

80
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,401
We must be on our best
behaviour tonight.

81
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:19,644
"Ah. What thrill in
autumn. O mother mine.

82
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:24,367
In full-blossomed paddy fields I have
seen spread all over sweet smiles."

83
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:27,369
"Ah, what beauty, what shades,
what affection and what..."

84
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:29,607
Shahana.

85
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:32,530
You will take over from your sister now.

86
00:11:35,372 --> 00:11:37,966
"What a guilt..."

87
00:11:41,572 --> 00:11:45,042
"What a quilt you have spread
at the feet of banyan trees

88
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:47,049
and along the banks of rivers."

89
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:51,450
"O mother mine, words from your lips
are like nectar to my ears."

90
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:54,292
"Ah. What thrill is sadness."

91
00:11:55,052 --> 00:11:57,407
"O mother mine.

92
00:11:57,532 --> 00:12:00,251
Cast a gloom on your face.

93
00:12:00,373 --> 00:12:02,682
My eyes fill up with tears."

94
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:07,326
A little more inflection next time.

95
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,123
But better.

96
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:53,814
<i>- Salaam, Razia.
- Wa-alaikum-salaam.</i>

97
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:55,656
- Got a lot for you this time.
- Good.

98
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:59,373
I need to make enough
to keep the kids happy.

99
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,937
Some of the women
are sewing at home. Even I...

100
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,130
Will you smarten me up a little?

101
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,889
Which do you think
is the happiest nation on earth.

102
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:26,978
Ranked number one
in the world's happiest survey?

103
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:32,415
- Bangladesh.
- I'm worried about my sister.

104
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,417
All along I've been telling her
we are coming home.

105
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,929
She has... she has met someone.

106
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,539
No. No. No. No.

107
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,254
My cousin is not going to go
and rescue her again.

108
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,656
If he could just visit her once...

109
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,693
Maybe I could go. I could go
and walk around the streets and say:

110
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,574
"Have you seen my wife's sister?"

111
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:53,931
"She cooks for the jute men."

112
00:14:56,022 --> 00:14:59,492
I only have a job to find
and children to feed.

113
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:03,618
But what of our plans to go home?

114
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:05,811
I will work my contacts.

115
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,497
But you were so sure of the promotion.

116
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:11,817
They gave it to Wilkie.

117
00:15:13,022 --> 00:15:17,891
- Wilkie got the promotion?
- Wilkie got the promotion.

118
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:21,378
People here are by and large ignorant

119
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:25,336
and know nothing of the Brontës

120
00:15:25,463 --> 00:15:27,419
and Thackeray.

121
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:31,336
Can Wilkie guote from Chaucer?

122
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:35,376
No. He cannot.

123
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:41,254
Don't worry. I will have new employment
by the end of the week.

124
00:15:41,383 --> 00:15:43,897
I will clear my office today.

125
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:31,623
Oh! I've got them.

126
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,103
Thank you.

127
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:37,861
- I'm Razia.
- Hello.

128
00:16:39,146 --> 00:16:41,614
You want to have some tea?

129
00:16:41,746 --> 00:16:44,419
I haven't unpacked yet. But... come.

130
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,502
Hm?

131
00:16:50,546 --> 00:16:53,583
I just got it. 12 speeds.

132
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:57,261
£5.99 over 49 weeks.

133
00:17:02,507 --> 00:17:06,819
My daughter did it. I was fed up
with all that brushing and brushing.

134
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:08,971
She wants to do hair
and beauty at college,

135
00:17:09,073 --> 00:17:11,146
but I'm hoping universitv
if she works hard.

136
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:13,303
- Bye, Amma.
- Bye.

137
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:16,066
Love you.

138
00:17:16,188 --> 00:17:19,897
Tariq. Always needing money
for his books.

139
00:17:20,028 --> 00:17:23,703
However much you give,
they always need more.

140
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:28,984
What can you do?

141
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:32,867
You'll need a machine.

142
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:56,557
I'll send the boy over
once you've practised.

143
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,347
You can earn a pound a piece.

144
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,348
- Bibi.
- I can see you. Amma.

145
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,428
- I can see your feet.
- Let me measure your head.

146
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,620
Shahana!

147
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,627
Trv mine. Trv mine. Trv mine.

148
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,969
- How big is my head?

149
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,749
For a small brain. You have a big head.

150
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,140
Hello. Abba.

151
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:44,427
What is this?

152
00:18:51,753 --> 00:18:54,392
I will take the television. Then.

153
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:05,627
It is a pound a piece.

154
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,383
I will take food in my room.

155
00:19:12,313 --> 00:19:14,383
<i>Chiswick Auction House,
West London.</i>

156
00:19:14,513 --> 00:19:18,825
<i>Just down the road from where
the great painter Hogarth lived.</i>

157
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:38,147
<i>Sister, my husband says
a loss of pride is a terrible thing.</i>

158
00:19:39,154 --> 00:19:42,385
<i>But pride won't buy us tickets home.</i>

159
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:48,628
<i>I have work now. Lust like you.</i>

160
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:52,349
<i>I sew, and every hem
brings me closer to you.</i>

161
00:20:37,517 --> 00:20:39,587
<i>Huno Abba.</i>

162
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:42,948
<i>Ami aimune aicha... Aicha.</i>

163
00:20:44,797 --> 00:20:47,948
<i>- Salaam-alaikum.
- Salaam.</i>

164
00:20:49,438 --> 00:20:51,394
Your husband in?

165
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:57,753
It's OK. I visit a lot of the women.
If it's OK with him...

166
00:21:15,678 --> 00:21:19,557
This is a test batch.
Jeans. 42 pairs.

167
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,510
Yeah, Abba.
See you later.

168
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,438
My dad, always calling me
when I'm at work.

169
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,154
Parents are always worrving.

170
00:21:57,921 --> 00:21:59,957
I'll pay you Thursday. OK?

171
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:06,836
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me. It's a chore. Man.

172
00:22:12,402 --> 00:22:15,872
<i>- Salaam-alaikum.
- My mum had a sari like that.</i>

173
00:22:19,761 --> 00:22:21,717
<i>Wa-alaikum-salaam.</i>

174
00:22:35,962 --> 00:22:37,247
- What is it, Abba?

175
00:22:37,347 --> 00:22:40,319
This is a birthday
present for your mother.

176
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:44,516
- Her birthday's ages away.
- I'm also thinking about the home fund.

177
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:46,235
Wait. Bibi!

178
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:50,596
There are some uneducated types
who believe if the wife is working.

179
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:54,352
It is because the man
cannot put the food on the table.

180
00:22:54,483 --> 00:22:58,112
Lucky your mother
married an educated man.

181
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,996
So you have found new employment?

182
00:23:01,124 --> 00:23:03,160
I've been told by a reliable source

183
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:07,357
that they are in much need of lecturers
at Dhaka Universitv.

184
00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:11,682
To teach sociology, for example,
or philosophy.

185
00:23:12,644 --> 00:23:17,399
From today, we are joining
the world wide web.

186
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:19,959
I will email them straightaway.

187
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:22,555
But...

188
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:25,040
where did the money come from?

189
00:23:28,805 --> 00:23:32,400
Can I open this one for you. Abba?

190
00:23:32,525 --> 00:23:35,437
One has to speculate to accumulate.

191
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:37,874
What shall we start with?

192
00:23:38,005 --> 00:23:41,236
I can access the entire world.

193
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:52,236
Too boring for the memsahib?

194
00:23:58,566 --> 00:24:00,124
What is the wrong with you?

195
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:03,478
<i>You mean."What is wrong with you?"</i>

196
00:24:06,768 --> 00:24:09,236
OK.

197
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:12,120
From now on. No one speaks English.

198
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:15,769
- You said that last time.

199
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:17,996
Your behaviour is getting bad to worse!

200
00:24:19,287 --> 00:24:21,278
This is what they teach you
at the school?

201
00:24:21,408 --> 00:24:25,924
This is what they teach you? !
I will not allow this to happen!

202
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:29,198
To learn manners
and to respect her father!

203
00:24:29,328 --> 00:24:32,320
I didn't ask to be born here!

204
00:25:39,011 --> 00:25:41,764
Go home. You fucking Pakis!

205
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:51,810
<i>Salaam-alaikum.</i>

206
00:25:51,932 --> 00:25:53,809
Sorrv about this.

207
00:25:54,852 --> 00:25:57,924
- What happened?
- I know who they are.

208
00:25:58,052 --> 00:26:01,328
The Lion Hearts. They've gone.

209
00:26:01,452 --> 00:26:04,012
I took it right from
under their nose. Man.

210
00:26:05,493 --> 00:26:09,964
"Multicultural murder. Do you know
Britain is being slowly suffocated?"

211
00:26:10,092 --> 00:26:14,768
"Muslim extremists taking
over our streets."

212
00:26:14,892 --> 00:26:17,122
- Who does all this?
- Idiots.

213
00:26:18,372 --> 00:26:20,442
You're thirstv.

214
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:44,325
This is nice work.

215
00:26:47,894 --> 00:26:50,089
There's a pair missing.

216
00:26:51,614 --> 00:26:54,447
42. There should be 42.

217
00:26:56,495 --> 00:26:58,087
No.

218
00:26:58,215 --> 00:26:59,967
It's probably my mistake.

219
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:07,170
- Father?
- My dad.

220
00:27:09,415 --> 00:27:12,327
25 years as a bus conductor,
now he doesn't leave the flat.

221
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:16,085
Just ringing me all the time.
Every day the same.

222
00:27:17,896 --> 00:27:20,364
And your mother?

223
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:22,452
Died five years ago.

224
00:27:25,657 --> 00:27:29,445
"Don't make trouble for yourself."
That's all my dad ever says to me.

225
00:27:29,576 --> 00:27:32,409
It's too many years
getting called all the names.

226
00:27:32,536 --> 00:27:35,653
Kids giving him cheek,
men giving him aggro.

227
00:27:36,296 --> 00:27:39,015
He never made trouble
for anyone his whole life.

228
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,251
Tsk!

229
00:27:40,377 --> 00:27:44,211
He thinks he's Mahatma Gandhi.
He thinks he's Jesus Christ.

230
00:27:44,337 --> 00:27:48,091
Always saying to me,
"Turn the other cheek."

231
00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:51,933
That's what you get. Man.

232
00:27:52,977 --> 00:27:55,047
Yes. It's what you get.

233
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:01,097
- A lot of books.
- My husband.

234
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:19,566
I'm reading a very interesting book
at the moment.

235
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:24,852
According to Hume, all objects of human
inguirv may be divided into two kinds.

236
00:28:24,979 --> 00:28:28,654
That is relation of ideas
and matters of fact.

237
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:32,848
To explain the meaning
of relation of idea,

238
00:28:32,948 --> 00:28:34,658
Hume gives an example.

239
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:39,409
That the three times of five
is egual to half of 30.

240
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,496
Are you resting?

241
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,453
This one is nice.

242
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,713
I can say that it is
nice or not nice, and...

243
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:51,449
how can I be wrong. According to Hume?

244
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:56,494
The search for knowledge -
is there anything more satisfying?

245
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:03,371
The foundation of modern philosophy -
it is a verv interesting module.

246
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,931
Hume also says that the sun...

247
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:15,171
<i>Praise be to Allah.
So much to thank him for.</i>

248
00:29:15,302 --> 00:29:17,338
<i>I have news.</i>

249
00:29:17,462 --> 00:29:20,486
<i>I have accepted a
proposal from Mr Lassi,</i>

250
00:29:20,586 --> 00:29:22,411
<i>with his skin so white...</i>

251
00:29:23,942 --> 00:29:26,092
- Shahana.
- "Sister. We are married."

252
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:30,374
"People stop and stare because
he is Mr Lassi and I am now his wife."

253
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,697
Give it back. Shahana!

254
00:29:32,822 --> 00:29:34,414
Shahana. Give... Shahana!

255
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:37,215
"I enjoy their stares,
walking arm in arm together."

256
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:40,414
"I am in love, sister.
I am in love!"

257
00:29:42,742 --> 00:29:44,698
What is this?

258
00:29:46,023 --> 00:29:50,016
- I was just trying them on.
- Shahana. Off! Off. I said.

259
00:29:50,143 --> 00:29:53,294
- Shahana! Give it back.
- That's romantic. Man.

260
00:29:53,423 --> 00:29:56,540
What's Auntie like?
Is she like me?

261
00:29:56,663 --> 00:29:59,655
As pretty as you and as naughtv as you.

262
00:30:02,024 --> 00:30:05,380
At least her life is exciting.
At least it's not boring.

263
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:07,562
- The test of life is to endure.

264
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:10,179
I know. Amma. You tell me all the time.

265
00:30:10,303 --> 00:30:12,294
And so did my Amma.

266
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:15,142
- Please! Ple...
- Shh! Bibi's sleeping.

267
00:30:15,264 --> 00:30:17,300
- Please. Please.
- No. No.

268
00:30:21,585 --> 00:30:23,541
Give it to me.

269
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,900
"Walking arm in arm."

270
00:30:27,024 --> 00:30:28,935
"I am in love. Sister."

271
00:30:29,065 --> 00:30:31,374
"I am so in love."

272
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:36,499
<i>I thought I knew love before,
but it was not like this.</i>

273
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:41,256
<i>He's always watching me,
never letting me out of his sight.</i>

274
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:43,580
<i>Like I might vanish.</i>

275
00:30:43,706 --> 00:30:47,176
<i>This time. I am sure it is right.</i>

276
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:18,223
Thank you.

277
00:31:21,188 --> 00:31:23,463
Talk to me.

278
00:31:24,307 --> 00:31:26,775
This won't sew itself.

279
00:31:26,906 --> 00:31:28,862
You talk. I will listen.

280
00:31:37,268 --> 00:31:41,227
So many kids, man,
smoking shit. Doing nothing.

281
00:31:44,748 --> 00:31:46,659
Do you only go out with your husband?

282
00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:48,858
I go out when I need to shop.

283
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,628
How long have you been living here?

284
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:56,858
16 years.

285
00:31:56,988 --> 00:31:59,422
My mum came over when she was 17.

286
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:03,585
- Me too.
- For real?

287
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:07,825
You look younger.

288
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,340
You know. When I was young.

289
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:18,188
If you wanted to be cool,
you had to be something else.

290
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:20,982
A bit white. A bit
black. A bit something.

291
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,101
Anything but Bangladeshi.

292
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,939
What?

293
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,584
You always stammer
when you talk Bengali.

294
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:37,420
Only when I'm nervous.

295
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,102
There's gonna be meetings every week.

296
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:51,101
You should come.

297
00:32:52,351 --> 00:32:54,307
Bring your husband.

298
00:33:03,712 --> 00:33:07,261
<i>- Salaam-alaikum.
- Wa-alaikum-salaam.</i>

299
00:33:07,392 --> 00:33:09,747
<i>Salaam-alaikum.</i>

300
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:11,828
Thursday.

301
00:33:17,752 --> 00:33:19,982
Your girls haven't been seen
at the madrasah.

302
00:33:20,113 --> 00:33:22,468
I will speak with my husband.

303
00:33:22,592 --> 00:33:24,548
Never mind.

304
00:33:26,033 --> 00:33:30,106
Place the money in the side pocket.
I won't count it.

305
00:33:39,113 --> 00:33:41,786
£50 as arranged.
Your husband owes me.

306
00:33:47,674 --> 00:33:50,632
I see how it is.
He hasn't talked to you.

307
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,191
I will collect every week £50.

308
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:57,386
It is simply an arrangement
between friends.

309
00:33:57,515 --> 00:33:59,904
Pay when you can.

310
00:34:00,035 --> 00:34:03,311
You will find a way.
Allah always gives a way.

311
00:34:05,674 --> 00:34:07,949
Ah. What a boy.

312
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:11,150
Too beautiful.

313
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:18,146
Hello?

314
00:34:19,835 --> 00:34:22,190
Anyone home?

315
00:34:31,396 --> 00:34:35,309
I hear her sons wanted
to buy her a hip replacement.

316
00:34:35,436 --> 00:34:37,074
"No. No. No. No. No."

317
00:34:37,196 --> 00:34:39,426
"Don't waste a good hip on me."

318
00:34:39,557 --> 00:34:42,435
"I don't want to be buried
with a new hip."

319
00:34:42,556 --> 00:34:44,945
"God does not love a wasteful woman."

320
00:34:50,196 --> 00:34:53,871
My husband's borrowed money from her.

321
00:34:54,997 --> 00:34:57,386
How much she charge you?

322
00:34:57,517 --> 00:34:59,348
I don't know.

323
00:34:59,477 --> 00:35:01,707
How much does a computer cost?

324
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:04,511
Certificates from everywhere.

325
00:35:04,637 --> 00:35:07,629
But your husband's a bloody fool.

326
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:11,750
I know one family,
they've been paying six. Seven years.

327
00:35:11,878 --> 00:35:14,392
Whatever you pay,
she'll say you owe more.

328
00:35:14,518 --> 00:35:16,907
You'll never get rid of the debt.

329
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:19,792
She's got a system
inherited from her husband.

330
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:21,988
That's how usurers work.

331
00:35:22,117 --> 00:35:24,187
- She's a usurer?
- Mm.

332
00:35:25,398 --> 00:35:28,071
You take care.

333
00:35:28,198 --> 00:35:30,473
Zips and seams to finish.

334
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:37,114
All right.

335
00:36:56,442 --> 00:37:01,197
I suggest we call ourselves
United Muslim Action.

336
00:37:01,323 --> 00:37:03,467
Let's get our own
neighbourhood straight.

337
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:05,282
Show that Banglatown is defended.

338
00:37:05,403 --> 00:37:09,112
You ask what about Chechnya?
What about Palestine?

339
00:37:09,244 --> 00:37:11,712
Well. I say what about here?

340
00:37:12,963 --> 00:37:17,434
This community has been taking shit
from people like the Lion Hearts.

341
00:37:17,564 --> 00:37:20,761
What about your children?
Who's gonna fight for them?

342
00:37:20,884 --> 00:37:24,035
If we can't change things. Who can?

343
00:37:24,164 --> 00:37:27,395
I suggest we call
ourselves Bengal Tigers.

344
00:37:27,523 --> 00:37:31,436
I say let's vote
and get Banglatown represented.

345
00:37:35,845 --> 00:37:38,200
Secretarv. Let's take a vote.

346
00:37:42,324 --> 00:37:45,919
- OK. Muslim Action?
- United Muslim Action.

347
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:48,605
Bengal Tigers?

348
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,439
Bengal Tigers is duly elected.

349
00:38:16,686 --> 00:38:18,642
I should go.

350
00:38:42,288 --> 00:38:44,244
Thursday?

351
00:38:44,367 --> 00:38:46,323
Mm.

352
00:40:23,932 --> 00:40:27,129
As you are all aware,
your mother and I have decided

353
00:40:27,253 --> 00:40:29,608
that we as a family will return home.

354
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:34,411
Your mother is doing everything
she can do to facilitate this trip.

355
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:37,445
But today I have also become

356
00:40:37,572 --> 00:40:40,962
the employee of Kempton Cars.

357
00:40:41,093 --> 00:40:44,005
Driver 1619.

358
00:40:45,013 --> 00:40:47,129
So the home fund will prosper.

359
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:50,849
Memsahib! Prepare!

360
00:40:52,373 --> 00:40:58,448
<i># Jodi tor dak shuney
kew na ashey tobey</i>

361
00:40:59,934 --> 00:41:02,129
What's that. Abba?

362
00:41:02,255 --> 00:41:05,008
Massage car seat cover.

363
00:41:05,134 --> 00:41:07,090
Verv good for back.

364
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:11,207
For relief of tension
and unknotting of muscles.

365
00:41:16,455 --> 00:41:19,572
All I have ever seen in this countrv

366
00:41:19,695 --> 00:41:22,414
is the Houses of Parliament.

367
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:26,732
That was in 1979.

368
00:41:28,335 --> 00:41:30,644
So many years of struggling.

369
00:41:30,775 --> 00:41:33,767
I barely had time to lift my head

370
00:41:33,896 --> 00:41:35,852
and look around.

371
00:41:39,016 --> 00:41:41,211
<i>Oh, no, Alec, not here.
Someone will see.</i>

372
00:41:41,336 --> 00:41:43,406
<i>I love you so.</i>

373
00:41:47,817 --> 00:41:49,569
We must do some visiting.

374
00:41:50,737 --> 00:41:52,693
Sightseeing.

375
00:41:57,856 --> 00:42:00,609
Look how much these English
pay for their kameez.

376
00:42:00,737 --> 00:42:03,410
It is giving you ideas.
This is too bright.

377
00:42:03,537 --> 00:42:05,255
And a rip-off.

378
00:42:05,377 --> 00:42:07,766
OK, I will leave you.
See you later.

379
00:42:07,897 --> 00:42:09,853
Bye.

380
00:42:19,298 --> 00:42:22,051
There's something I wanna show you.

381
00:42:42,258 --> 00:42:44,328
Where are you taking me?

382
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:52,774
This is my uncle's factorv.

383
00:42:55,819 --> 00:42:57,889
Just closing up right now.

384
00:44:25,464 --> 00:44:30,936
<i>Sister, there is
something I must tell you.</i>

385
00:44:31,063 --> 00:44:35,614
<i>If you were here I would spend
so much time talking to you.</i>

386
00:44:35,744 --> 00:44:37,939
<i>Something is happening.</i>

387
00:44:38,064 --> 00:44:41,374
<i>I know it is foolish
but I cannot help it.</i>

388
00:44:41,504 --> 00:44:44,940
<i>I tell myself."Be careful. Be careful."</i>

389
00:47:25,792 --> 00:47:28,829
Children. Are you enioying yourself?

390
00:47:30,792 --> 00:47:35,912
You see? When you have all the time
in the world to see something.

391
00:47:36,032 --> 00:47:37,784
You don't bother to see it.

392
00:47:38,392 --> 00:47:42,431
Now that we are going home,
I have become a tourist.

393
00:47:42,553 --> 00:47:44,623
It is so ironic.

394
00:47:45,954 --> 00:47:49,230
"Buckingham Palace has been
the official residency

395
00:47:49,353 --> 00:47:51,503
of British sovereigns since 1837."

396
00:47:51,632 --> 00:47:54,014
- Do you have the
cream? I'm going black.

397
00:47:54,115 --> 00:47:55,785
Shh. Your father is speaking.

398
00:47:55,913 --> 00:47:58,632
- If he ever stops, let me know.
- Shahana!

399
00:47:58,753 --> 00:48:02,587
Look, Shahana.
Look at this beautiful building.

400
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:05,945
If you have historv. You have pride.

401
00:48:06,074 --> 00:48:10,033
People here know nothing
of our national heroes like... er...

402
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:14,466
Like Colonel Osmani and also
Shah Jalal. Both from Sylhet.

403
00:48:15,034 --> 00:48:17,309
I know. I know who they are.

404
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:21,274
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

405
00:48:21,395 --> 00:48:23,272
- Can you take a picture for me?
- Sure.

406
00:48:23,395 --> 00:48:25,226
Turn. Turn. Turn.

407
00:48:25,355 --> 00:48:27,186
- Where are you from?
- Bangladesh.

408
00:48:27,314 --> 00:48:30,511
- What's he got to fiddle around for?
- I will buy you the earrings.

409
00:48:30,635 --> 00:48:32,626
The really long ones?

410
00:48:32,755 --> 00:48:35,144
Down to your knees.

411
00:48:35,275 --> 00:48:38,153
Now. Smile. Smile.

412
00:48:38,275 --> 00:48:40,231
OK. Ready.

413
00:48:56,956 --> 00:48:59,516
Amma. Stop.

414
00:48:59,957 --> 00:49:04,633
Are you feeling well?
Too much excitement. Perhaps.

415
00:49:04,757 --> 00:49:08,716
See how happy your mother is
now we are going home.

416
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:30,390
<i>Sister, there is
something I have to tell you.</i>

417
00:49:31,598 --> 00:49:33,987
<i>I am...</i>

418
00:49:34,118 --> 00:49:36,074
<i>I am in...</i>

419
00:49:50,438 --> 00:49:53,077
<i>Hasina. My husband thanks you.</i>

420
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:55,952
<i>The pudina for his
ulcer is working well.</i>

421
00:49:56,078 --> 00:50:00,071
<i>I am praying for you
and your new husband every day.</i>

422
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,430
My sister.

423
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:09,108
She ran off with one of the men
who worked for my father.

424
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,470
He never forgave her.

425
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,355
They stole his bicycle.

426
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,675
My boy.

427
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,796
He was my first.

428
00:50:37,721 --> 00:50:40,474
I found him in his cot.

429
00:50:40,601 --> 00:50:42,557
He stopped breathing.

430
00:50:46,921 --> 00:50:49,389
We don't talk about it any more.

431
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,117
He is beautiful.

432
00:51:00,722 --> 00:51:02,678
Yes.

433
00:51:05,802 --> 00:51:08,874
The devil only takes beautiful babies.

434
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,799
What?

435
00:51:23,923 --> 00:51:26,312
Why do you like me?

436
00:51:30,443 --> 00:51:32,399
Who says I like you?

437
00:51:37,444 --> 00:51:39,435
There's two tvpes. Right?

438
00:51:40,164 --> 00:51:44,043
Your westernised girl,
into going out. Having a laugh.

439
00:51:44,164 --> 00:51:48,715
Short skirts as soon
as she's out of her father's sight.

440
00:51:48,844 --> 00:51:52,359
Then your religious girl.
You think they'd be good wife material

441
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:56,079
but they ain't,
cos all they wanna do is argue.

442
00:51:57,005 --> 00:51:59,314
So what about me?

443
00:51:59,445 --> 00:52:01,276
You...

444
00:52:02,324 --> 00:52:04,280
you're the real thing.

445
00:52:05,765 --> 00:52:07,721
A girl from the village.

446
00:52:11,046 --> 00:52:13,685
Don't you ever want to go home?

447
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,841
This is my home.

448
00:53:09,608 --> 00:53:11,564
What's going on?

449
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:32,679
The world has gone mad.

450
00:53:37,889 --> 00:53:41,040
<i>The search is under way
for those behind these evil acts.</i>

451
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:42,758
It will be just like when

452
00:53:42,857 --> 00:53:45,560
I first arrived. There
will be a backlash.

453
00:53:46,249 --> 00:53:49,559
There has been enough planning.
Start packing.

454
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:52,158
- We will be in Dhaka within the month.
- What?

455
00:53:52,289 --> 00:53:56,043
No more pop CDs.
All money goes to the home fund.

456
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:58,321
- Ow!
- And cover your legs.

457
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:01,362
Take more sewing.
We need more money.

458
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:04,369
- I will speak to him.
- No!

459
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,725
Who?

460
00:54:09,851 --> 00:54:12,240
Who you do not wish me to speak to?

461
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:16,599
No-no... no one.

462
00:54:18,492 --> 00:54:20,323
I'll do it.

463
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:25,445
- Do what?
- Speak... speak to him.

464
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:28,889
Verv well.

465
00:54:29,011 --> 00:54:31,286
You tell him...

466
00:54:32,132 --> 00:54:35,090
you want paying extra 50°%

467
00:54:35,212 --> 00:54:37,442
if we are ever to get home.

468
00:54:39,612 --> 00:54:42,285
<i>...carried out these attacks.</i>

469
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:46,200
<i>There are no adequate
words of condemnation.</i>

470
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:51,851
<i>Their barbarism will stand
as their shame for all eternity.</i>

471
00:54:55,133 --> 00:54:58,443
Community meeting.
Come along. Brother.

472
00:55:07,173 --> 00:55:09,243
Shahana. Bibi.

473
00:55:10,893 --> 00:55:13,453
Come on. Girls.

474
00:55:13,573 --> 00:55:17,248
Go! Go! You fucking terrorists!
Get out!

475
00:55:17,374 --> 00:55:22,004
Go back to your own country,
you bin Ladens! Go on. Fuck off!

476
00:55:24,814 --> 00:55:26,943
<i>This has been a year
of racial tension...</i>

477
00:55:27,044 --> 00:55:29,172
<i>in Britain. With race
riots in the north.</i>

478
00:55:29,295 --> 00:55:32,173
<i>The fear is now
that this tension will increase.</i>

479
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:37,323
<i>Many claim that in the last seven days,
"Muslim" has become a dirty word.</i>

480
00:55:37,456 --> 00:55:39,924
<i>Broken windows at a mosque -</i>

481
00:55:40,055 --> 00:55:43,331
<i>a consequence of these misconceptions.
</i>

482
00:55:43,454 --> 00:55:47,003
<i>People say to us, "You
shouldn't be here. Why are you here?"</i>

483
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,285
<i>"Go away."</i>

484
00:55:50,655 --> 00:55:55,490
It's getting crazy out there.
My dad's really scared now.

485
00:55:55,616 --> 00:55:59,894
Some white boy goes and pulls my
cousin's hiiab down in the street today.

486
00:56:00,016 --> 00:56:02,961
He was only about ten.
I'm telling you, man,

487
00:56:03,061 --> 00:56:04,373
things are changing.

488
00:56:04,496 --> 00:56:07,647
The way people look at you now
on the streets - so much mistrust.

489
00:56:07,777 --> 00:56:09,811
I wanna say, "If I was
a bomber, do you...

490
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:11,894
think I'd be carrving
50 pairs of ieans?"

491
00:56:12,016 --> 00:56:14,484
- Stop.
- What?

492
00:56:25,377 --> 00:56:27,333
<i>Salaam-alaikum.</i>

493
00:56:37,218 --> 00:56:38,856
<i>Wa-alaikum-salaam.</i>

494
00:56:56,299 --> 00:56:59,496
- Is it interesting?
- I was just browsing.

495
00:56:59,618 --> 00:57:01,574
You don't mind?

496
00:57:03,698 --> 00:57:06,212
Why should I mind?

497
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,728
When I was a young man like you.

498
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:11,214
Do you know what I wanted to be?

499
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:15,688
A British civil servant, right-hand
bloody man of the prime minister.

500
00:57:15,819 --> 00:57:18,492
And I saw no reason why not.

501
00:57:18,619 --> 00:57:21,850
Anything is possible when you are young.

502
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:29,412
Then you get older.

503
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:32,578
And the thing about getting older is...

504
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:40,089
that you don't need everything
to be possible any more.

505
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:43,257
You just need some things to be certain.

506
00:58:13,943 --> 00:58:16,537
- Abba.
- Mm.

507
00:58:16,662 --> 00:58:21,258
If you left me and Bibi behind,
you wouldn't have to save as much.

508
00:58:21,382 --> 00:58:23,737
And we could be adopted.

509
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:31,461
Do you want me to beat you?

510
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:33,221
Yes.

511
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,653
Well. I won't beat you

512
00:58:36,783 --> 00:58:39,422
and I won't leave you behind.

513
00:58:40,223 --> 00:58:43,693
One day, Abba, I'll run
and you won't ever catch me.

514
00:58:44,144 --> 00:58:45,623
Shahana!

515
00:58:52,984 --> 00:58:55,862
Why did Allah curse me with daughters? !

516
00:58:55,985 --> 00:58:57,384
Shahana!

517
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:02,133
Shahana!

518
00:59:02,264 --> 00:59:07,133
Do you think your cheek
will serve you well in the world?

519
00:59:07,264 --> 00:59:11,382
Can you imagine the things
I have had to fight?

520
00:59:13,585 --> 00:59:19,023
Do you know what you're going to have
to face out there every day?

521
00:59:19,146 --> 00:59:21,102
Every day.

522
00:59:23,425 --> 00:59:25,017
Shahana.

523
00:59:26,706 --> 00:59:32,144
Do you think I'm like this
for the good of my health?

524
00:59:33,387 --> 00:59:35,343
No. Abba.

525
00:59:39,145 --> 00:59:41,101
Good.

526
00:59:42,146 --> 00:59:44,785
I am glad

527
00:59:44,906 --> 00:59:48,535
we have talked
father and daughter like this.

528
01:00:09,388 --> 01:00:11,219
<i>Sister...</i>

529
01:00:12,268 --> 01:00:14,498
<i>I have an unquiet mind.</i>

530
01:00:17,428 --> 01:00:20,864
<i>And it is so long
since I have heard from you.</i>

531
01:00:37,109 --> 01:00:38,906
It was still on the mat.

532
01:00:41,149 --> 01:00:43,299
You must have been busy.

533
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:49,188
You think she's enioying married life?

534
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:53,900
My cousin says she has left her husband.

535
01:00:55,189 --> 01:00:58,306
He has seen her working the hotels.

536
01:00:58,429 --> 01:01:02,786
It is where all the...
floating girls go.

537
01:01:08,591 --> 01:01:12,789
You think she lived off cooking
all these years?

538
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:17,267
All these years, all these letters,
hearing what your sister had to say.

539
01:01:17,391 --> 01:01:18,710
Give me my letter!

540
01:01:18,831 --> 01:01:22,460
Maybe I should have been asking
what you are writing to her.

541
01:01:22,592 --> 01:01:25,529
Give it to me. Give it
to me! I said give!

542
01:01:25,628 --> 01:01:27,711
Give me my letter! Give! Give!

543
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:30,664
You are no different to your sister!

544
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:43,302
<i>Sister. Mr Lassi has gone.</i>

545
01:01:43,431 --> 01:01:46,309
<i>Hussain from the factory
has been very kind to me.</i>

546
01:01:46,432 --> 01:01:48,582
<i>He brings me a little food.</i>

547
01:01:48,712 --> 01:01:51,943
<i>Haven't I always known
how to take care of myself?</i>

548
01:01:52,073 --> 01:01:54,507
<i>We all survive in different ways.</i>

549
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:04,949
<i>Last night was so funny.
I sang for Rehan.</i>

550
01:02:05,073 --> 01:02:08,270
<i>He makes me sit on the bed
like when he first saw me.</i>

551
01:02:08,394 --> 01:02:12,751
<i>Mr Chowdhury is like a father to me.
He treats me very well.</i>

552
01:02:12,873 --> 01:02:15,945
<i>They tease me,
but I know they're only loking.</i>

553
01:02:16,073 --> 01:02:19,429
<i>- Ahmed likes to bring me to his house.
- Are you all right?</i>

554
01:02:19,553 --> 01:02:23,751
<i>I do not tell him I'm a married woman.
I have never been good at staying still.</i>

555
01:02:23,874 --> 01:02:26,672
<i>Abba went with other women.</i>

556
01:02:27,273 --> 01:02:31,710
<i>Mr Chowdhury says
these boys are like moths to a flame.</i>

557
01:02:39,235 --> 01:02:41,624
<i>I won't be like Amma.</i>

558
01:02:41,755 --> 01:02:43,871
<i>She took the forbidden path.</i>

559
01:02:43,995 --> 01:02:46,748
<i>She did not endure. So why should we?</i>

560
01:03:03,755 --> 01:03:06,792
Amma. Amma. She's sleeping.

561
01:03:17,396 --> 01:03:19,830
She wakes.

562
01:03:25,797 --> 01:03:28,265
Will you have some food now?

563
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:31,672
Just a little rice.

564
01:03:31,797 --> 01:03:33,594
Rice it is.

565
01:03:34,636 --> 01:03:38,311
Dr Azad said the illness
will leave you hungrv.

566
01:03:45,038 --> 01:03:49,429
<i>... of the US-led bombardment.
The rally was told another malor...</i>

567
01:03:57,639 --> 01:03:59,914
I started to pack.

568
01:04:02,558 --> 01:04:04,628
Oh. Wait.

569
01:04:23,479 --> 01:04:24,878
How?

570
01:04:24,999 --> 01:04:28,355
Where there is a will.
There is always a way.

571
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:34,199
What should I take -
Thackeray or the Proust?

572
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,356
I will take both.

573
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,516
You rest now.

574
01:04:41,641 --> 01:04:45,600
Now, where are my certificates?
Do you know what Gandhi said

575
01:04:45,721 --> 01:04:48,554
when asked what he thought
about Western civilisation?

576
01:04:48,681 --> 01:04:53,038
He said he thought
it would be a good idea.

577
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,310
When do you go?

578
01:04:59,081 --> 01:05:01,879
The tickets are booked in three weeks.

579
01:05:02,521 --> 01:05:04,273
So. Have you seen him?

580
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:07,636
- Karim?
- No.

581
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:11,077
Did he visit while I was ill?

582
01:05:11,202 --> 01:05:14,194
Haven't seen him for days.
Someone said he's away.

583
01:05:16,322 --> 01:05:18,882
Don't make trouble for yourself.

584
01:05:20,882 --> 01:05:22,838
I already have.

585
01:05:27,203 --> 01:05:30,195
- It looks like you are doing well.
- Mm.

586
01:05:32,603 --> 01:05:35,163
I'll need people to sew.

587
01:05:47,364 --> 01:05:49,320
<i>Salaam-alaikum.</i>

588
01:06:35,726 --> 01:06:38,081
You are angrv with me.

589
01:06:38,205 --> 01:06:40,639
No.

590
01:06:40,766 --> 01:06:42,722
I've been away.

591
01:06:43,926 --> 01:06:46,884
Visiting family in Bradford.

592
01:06:47,007 --> 01:06:51,717
If I'd known you was ill...
I can see you're angrv with me.

593
01:06:51,846 --> 01:06:57,045
Why do you not believe me when
I tell you that I'm not angrv with you?

594
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:05,519
I turned down a girl last week for you.

595
01:07:08,528 --> 01:07:10,564
My dad keeps asking me why.

596
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:15,159
What can I do?

597
01:07:15,287 --> 01:07:18,643
You could stay. He could go.
Let him divorce you.

598
01:07:19,088 --> 01:07:20,806
We'll get married.

599
01:07:20,928 --> 01:07:22,884
I'll sort it.

600
01:07:26,848 --> 01:07:29,726
And then what?

601
01:07:29,847 --> 01:07:32,361
Amma.

602
01:07:50,929 --> 01:07:53,079
Good night.

603
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:55,770
Are you in love with him?

604
01:07:56,689 --> 01:08:00,045
I mean, have you ever been
in love with him?

605
01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:02,240
Maybe before he got fat?

606
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:09,762
We don't have to go, Amma.
You don't have to go.

607
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:11,767
We shall wait and see.

608
01:08:11,889 --> 01:08:14,403
That's no answer.

609
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:16,964
It is my answer. Good night.

610
01:08:23,811 --> 01:08:27,201
<i>Sister,
may Allah take care of you.</i>

611
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:32,404
<i>I'm sending you a little more money
to help keep you safe.</i>

612
01:08:32,531 --> 01:08:34,886
<i>How long have we been talking?</i>

613
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:39,481
<i>How long have I not been hearing
what you say?</i>

614
01:08:41,772 --> 01:08:43,808
<i>I too have secrets.</i>

615
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:46,842
<i>Now is the time for truth.</i>

616
01:08:48,451 --> 01:08:51,284
<i>I feel as if I'm waking from a dream.</i>

617
01:08:53,012 --> 01:08:55,003
<i>The world is changing.</i>

618
01:08:55,132 --> 01:08:56,884
<i>And me with it.</i>

619
01:08:58,612 --> 01:09:00,648
<i>We are coming home.</i>

620
01:09:00,772 --> 01:09:02,842
<i>How can we stay?</i>

621
01:09:04,732 --> 01:09:07,007
Amma.

622
01:09:16,293 --> 01:09:19,763
Bibi, look at that!

623
01:09:21,454 --> 01:09:23,410
Mrs Ahmed!

624
01:09:25,654 --> 01:09:29,966
I know you have been ill.
Just give me what you owe.

625
01:09:30,093 --> 01:09:31,924
How would it look if I let you off?

626
01:09:32,053 --> 01:09:34,965
Let one slip. They all slip through.

627
01:09:36,254 --> 01:09:40,406
Your husband is trying to run away,
but I won't let him.

628
01:09:40,534 --> 01:09:45,608
He comes asking for more and I tell him,
"Pay what you owe."

629
01:09:45,734 --> 01:09:48,328
- Shahana.
- What?

630
01:09:49,895 --> 01:09:51,772
Who are they?

631
01:09:51,895 --> 01:09:54,250
Her friends from school.

632
01:10:04,936 --> 01:10:06,892
Ugh.

633
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:10,410
Ugh!

634
01:10:10,535 --> 01:10:12,685
Bibi!

635
01:10:12,816 --> 01:10:16,286
In Bangladesh you have to brush
your teeth with a twig.

636
01:10:16,415 --> 01:10:18,485
And go toilet in a bucket.

637
01:10:20,016 --> 01:10:22,928
Auntie Hasina goes to the toilet
in a bucket next to a goat.

638
01:10:23,056 --> 01:10:25,047
- Shahana!
- It's true.

639
01:10:25,176 --> 01:10:27,053
Less talking. More brushing.

640
01:10:27,177 --> 01:10:29,133
It's true.

641
01:10:32,376 --> 01:10:35,015
Well. Do you even want to go?

642
01:10:38,977 --> 01:10:40,933
You don't.

643
01:10:47,976 --> 01:10:51,127
What Mrs Islam says...

644
01:10:51,937 --> 01:10:54,053
Is this true?

645
01:10:54,177 --> 01:10:55,974
This is a good guestion.

646
01:10:56,738 --> 01:10:58,933
When you feel something so strongly.

647
01:10:59,058 --> 01:11:03,176
You have to ask yourself."Is this true?"

648
01:11:08,138 --> 01:11:10,049
I still have my coat on.

649
01:11:11,139 --> 01:11:14,131
Isn't it fair to say that you hate it
when I come inside

650
01:11:14,259 --> 01:11:16,932
and forget to take it off?

651
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:32,489
I'm not totally blind.

652
01:11:37,379 --> 01:11:39,654
Don't worrv.

653
01:11:39,779 --> 01:11:43,692
A little business
venture I have in mind.

654
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:47,530
I'm gathering together samples.

655
01:11:50,221 --> 01:11:52,371
Soap is the future.

656
01:11:55,421 --> 01:11:58,458
I think we should go to this meeting.

657
01:11:58,581 --> 01:12:01,698
In fact. I have prepared a short speech.

658
01:12:04,261 --> 01:12:06,217
Will you come?

659
01:12:26,022 --> 01:12:29,856
Our fathers are being spat at,
our young brothers stopped and searched

660
01:12:29,982 --> 01:12:32,450
again and again by
our so-called police force.

661
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:35,381
Our sisters. They've been abused

662
01:12:35,503 --> 01:12:38,939
when they walk their little children
in the streets.

663
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,941
Banglatown needs defending.

664
01:12:42,862 --> 01:12:45,562
Karim has a list of estates. We need...

665
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:48,573
volunteers to wipe out
this kind of filth.

666
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,858
- Brother.
- Thanks. Bruv.

667
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:57,851
Out there are people
twisted with hatred for us and Islam.

668
01:12:58,983 --> 01:13:01,258
We're gonna show them
how wrong they are.

669
01:13:01,384 --> 01:13:03,898
Yeah!

670
01:13:04,024 --> 01:13:06,777
We've become victims,
but not for long!

671
01:13:06,904 --> 01:13:08,337
Yeah!

672
01:13:08,463 --> 01:13:12,376
We stand arm in arm with
our Muslim brothers ready to defend.

673
01:13:12,504 --> 01:13:13,857
Yeah!

674
01:13:13,984 --> 01:13:17,056
What is it you plan to defend?

675
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:20,938
What is it you are planning to defend?

676
01:13:21,065 --> 01:13:23,499
Islam, brother!

677
01:13:23,625 --> 01:13:28,141
No, no, no, no, no, no. Let the brother
speak. Let the brother speak.

678
01:13:28,544 --> 01:13:32,059
- You think Islam unites us all?
- Yes.

679
01:13:32,185 --> 01:13:35,222
You think Islam
is the place you come from?

680
01:13:35,345 --> 01:13:39,099
Islam is not a country.
You think you are my brother

681
01:13:39,226 --> 01:13:44,141
more than the next man on the street
because we are both Muslims?

682
01:13:46,306 --> 01:13:49,378
All this fighting talk
that we are all brothers.

683
01:13:49,506 --> 01:13:54,978
Three million! Three million died
in East Pakistan in this lifetime.

684
01:13:55,107 --> 01:13:57,257
Not in my lifetime. Uncle.

685
01:13:57,386 --> 01:13:59,980
In your parents' lifetime.

686
01:14:00,107 --> 01:14:02,223
What was that?

687
01:14:02,346 --> 01:14:04,621
Brotherly love?

688
01:14:04,746 --> 01:14:07,260
It was Muslim killing a Muslim.

689
01:14:11,946 --> 01:14:13,823
Have you forgotten?

690
01:14:13,946 --> 01:14:15,902
Are you so lost?

691
01:14:19,627 --> 01:14:22,664
My Islam is in here.

692
01:14:24,068 --> 01:14:26,821
And that is the only
thing worth defending.

693
01:14:26,947 --> 01:14:29,302
- Right.
- Hear. Hear.

694
01:14:29,428 --> 01:14:31,703
We plan to defend against hatred.

695
01:14:31,828 --> 01:14:33,944
We all stand together. Brothers.

696
01:14:34,988 --> 01:14:37,456
All right. All right. Moving on.

697
01:14:37,589 --> 01:14:41,662
Our brother Karim has got the list
of all the local estates.

698
01:14:41,788 --> 01:14:44,905
Everyone in here
has been allocated an area...

699
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:19,500
It is the time to go home.

700
01:15:41,351 --> 01:15:43,467
<i>- Salaam-alaikum.
- Wa-alaikum-salaam.</i>

701
01:15:43,592 --> 01:15:46,026
I've only got ten minutes.

702
01:15:46,671 --> 01:15:49,033
I've talked to some of
the other brothers.

703
01:15:49,133 --> 01:15:50,346
It's not looking good.

704
01:15:50,472 --> 01:15:52,508
I cannot marrv you.

705
01:15:54,432 --> 01:15:58,869
- Well, yeah, not straightaway, but...
- No. Um...

706
01:15:58,993 --> 01:16:01,063
<i>I do not want to marrv you.</i>

707
01:16:03,271 --> 01:16:05,546
Come on. Come.

708
01:16:11,712 --> 01:16:13,987
Look at me.

709
01:16:14,113 --> 01:16:16,627
Say it again.

710
01:16:16,752 --> 01:16:18,822
Look at me and say it.

711
01:16:20,553 --> 01:16:22,509
I do not want to marrv you. Karim.

712
01:16:22,633 --> 01:16:24,669
Right.

713
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:27,023
Right. Right.

714
01:16:28,954 --> 01:16:31,309
You don't wanna marrv me?

715
01:16:40,873 --> 01:16:43,751
- Is it the sin of it? Is that it?
- No. No.

716
01:16:45,754 --> 01:16:48,393
Karim. That we have already done.

717
01:16:50,514 --> 01:16:52,072
I...

718
01:16:52,194 --> 01:16:54,913
I am not the real thing.

719
01:16:55,034 --> 01:16:57,502
I'm no longer a girl from the village.

720
01:16:57,635 --> 01:16:59,512
- Yes, you are.
- No.

721
01:17:00,195 --> 01:17:02,231
You just wanted me to be.

722
01:17:02,914 --> 01:17:04,791
We just made each other up.

723
01:17:04,915 --> 01:17:07,509
Well. What did you want?

724
01:17:10,155 --> 01:17:13,830
I just wanted to feel

725
01:17:13,956 --> 01:17:15,992
like I was at home.

726
01:17:18,956 --> 01:17:21,311
Karim.

727
01:17:26,476 --> 01:17:28,353
You better pray like hell.

728
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:31,991
That's what I'm gonna do.
Allah forgives.

729
01:17:34,077 --> 01:17:36,113
<i>Salaam-alaikum.</i>

730
01:17:37,596 --> 01:17:39,552
<i>Wa-alaikum-salaam.</i>

731
01:18:11,918 --> 01:18:13,874
Hello?

732
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:16,354
Hello?

733
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:28,633
Mrs Ahmed?

734
01:18:28,759 --> 01:18:30,715
Hello?

735
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,516
Hello?

736
01:18:46,559 --> 01:18:48,629
Just give me what you owe.

737
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,756
I need my money.

738
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:58,280
From the goodness of my heart. I give.

739
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,517
And when those who receive
don't want to pay back what they owe.

740
01:19:01,641 --> 01:19:05,031
They run off to foreign countries
and say."Why should we pay her?"

741
01:19:05,161 --> 01:19:08,153
- "She's just an old, sick woman."
- How much do you want?

742
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,999
- £200 to settle the debt.
- No.

743
01:19:11,521 --> 01:19:14,797
We paid it all and some more as well.

744
01:19:14,921 --> 01:19:18,596
The money's for the madrasah.
But what is that to you?

745
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:21,713
- £200 and settle it.
- But we paid what we owed!

746
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:25,834
We paid at least £300 on top of that!
I'm not going to pay any more interest!

747
01:19:28,601 --> 01:19:32,037
Do you think before God
I will charge interest?

748
01:19:32,162 --> 01:19:33,959
- Am I a money lender?
- No?

749
01:19:42,602 --> 01:19:45,231
Just swear on Koran that you're not...

750
01:19:45,332 --> 01:19:48,314
and I'll pay you the
200. Just swear on it!

751
01:19:49,403 --> 01:19:54,523
There are certain things a wife
does not want her husband to know.

752
01:19:56,802 --> 01:19:59,635
My husband knows everything.

753
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:02,640
Just swear on the Koran.
That is all you have to do.

754
01:20:02,763 --> 01:20:05,231
Swear on it.

755
01:20:07,603 --> 01:20:09,992
Allah sees all your wrongs.

756
01:20:10,124 --> 01:20:13,116
Anyway. You have paid too much.

757
01:20:13,243 --> 01:20:15,711
- And he sees yours too.
- Huh!

758
01:20:29,084 --> 01:20:31,803
- We will store these boxes.
- OK. Mr Ahmed.

759
01:20:31,925 --> 01:20:34,644
The rest is for the auction. Thank you.

760
01:20:44,885 --> 01:20:48,275
A colleague from Kempton Cars
will collect us.

761
01:20:48,405 --> 01:20:52,876
He is more or less an ignorant type
but a good-hearted man -

762
01:20:53,006 --> 01:20:55,440
as they say. Salt of the earth.

763
01:21:02,526 --> 01:21:07,202
I will marry the memsahib
to the first fakir I can find.

764
01:21:07,327 --> 01:21:10,922
The first thing I do
when we step off the plane.

765
01:21:19,206 --> 01:21:21,640
What is so funny. Memsahib?

766
01:21:21,767 --> 01:21:24,520
- You are.
- Shahana!

767
01:21:24,647 --> 01:21:27,445
You are. With your stupid phrases.

768
01:21:27,567 --> 01:21:32,083
You're always encouraging us to fit in.
It worked. We do fit in.

769
01:21:32,207 --> 01:21:35,358
You're the one
who's stuck somewhere. Abba.

770
01:21:35,487 --> 01:21:37,796
Tell him.

771
01:21:44,569 --> 01:21:47,037
Tell him you don't want to go.

772
01:21:47,928 --> 01:21:52,843
What? He takes away my son
and curses me with daughters?

773
01:21:52,969 --> 01:21:55,644
- Be careful what you say, memsahib.

774
01:21:55,743 --> 01:21:58,645
We're not the ones lost. Abba. You are!

775
01:21:58,769 --> 01:22:02,682
She's been married to you
for nearly 20 years.

776
01:22:02,808 --> 01:22:07,836
And in all my life, Amma, I have
never heard you say what you want.

777
01:22:07,969 --> 01:22:10,119
Please. Amma. Tell him.

778
01:22:11,089 --> 01:22:14,843
Tell him, Amma.
Please. For once. Please. Tell him.

779
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:17,564
Please. Amma.

780
01:22:17,689 --> 01:22:20,328
Tell him you don't want to go!

781
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:23,089
Just tell him you don't want to go!

782
01:22:23,930 --> 01:22:25,841
Tell him!

783
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:27,926
Please!

784
01:22:29,691 --> 01:22:31,886
Please. Amma.

785
01:22:33,649 --> 01:22:35,480
You're pathetic!

786
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:39,159
Bangladesh is gone.
It's another time.

787
01:22:43,171 --> 01:22:45,969
Amma.

788
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:50,280
She will be back.

789
01:22:58,452 --> 01:23:00,010
Shahana!

790
01:23:00,252 --> 01:23:02,004
Shahana!

791
01:23:17,212 --> 01:23:19,885
Shahana! Shahana!

792
01:23:31,213 --> 01:23:32,441
Shahana!

793
01:24:40,256 --> 01:24:42,212
Shahana!

794
01:24:52,616 --> 01:24:54,572
Shahana!

795
01:25:00,177 --> 01:25:02,930
Shahana. Stop.

796
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:23,528
I don't wanna go.

797
01:25:24,618 --> 01:25:26,574
Amma is here.

798
01:25:30,298 --> 01:25:32,254
Don't worrv.

799
01:25:45,259 --> 01:25:48,092
Shahana is asleep now.

800
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,415
She is bound to be nervous.

801
01:25:52,139 --> 01:25:54,289
She will settle later.

802
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:57,890
- I know it is almost time...
- I know. I know how exciting it is.

803
01:25:58,019 --> 01:26:01,250
I have checked our passports
and tickets for the last time.

804
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:03,848
- But I wanted...
- Let us look forward now.

805
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,416
Just imagine a house in Dhaka,
holiday in Cox's Bazar.

806
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:09,815
A little trip for the
girls to Shundar Bon.

807
01:26:09,941 --> 01:26:12,660
They could see a real Bengal tiger.

808
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:15,489
I should have said this before. I...

809
01:26:15,621 --> 01:26:18,454
You see. All these years...

810
01:26:19,821 --> 01:26:23,780
I dreamed of going home a big man.

811
01:26:23,902 --> 01:26:26,700
Only now.

812
01:26:26,821 --> 01:26:29,096
When it is finished for me...

813
01:26:31,341 --> 01:26:33,696
I realised what is important.

814
01:26:37,021 --> 01:26:40,457
As long as I have my family with me

815
01:26:40,582 --> 01:26:43,858
I'm strong as any man alive.

816
01:26:53,463 --> 01:26:56,739
What is all this "strong man" about?

817
01:26:56,863 --> 01:26:59,741
Do you think that is why I love you?

818
01:26:59,863 --> 01:27:01,535
You're coming home.

819
01:27:03,143 --> 01:27:04,974
This is my home.

820
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:11,253
I cannot leave.

821
01:27:12,623 --> 01:27:14,693
I cannot stay.

822
01:27:20,143 --> 01:27:22,179
I cannot stay.

823
01:27:31,704 --> 01:27:33,934
Then you must take the plane.

824
01:27:43,145 --> 01:27:45,295
Allah has taken our son

825
01:27:45,425 --> 01:27:47,985
but he blessed us with daughters.

826
01:27:57,225 --> 01:28:00,023
We will always be here.

827
01:28:14,067 --> 01:28:17,821
<i>No one told me
there are different kinds of love.</i>

828
01:28:19,586 --> 01:28:22,339
<i>The kind that starts big</i>

829
01:28:22,467 --> 01:28:25,265
<i>and slowly wears away.</i>

830
01:28:25,387 --> 01:28:28,379
<i>That seems you'll never use it up</i>

831
01:28:28,507 --> 01:28:30,862
<i>and then one day it is finished.</i>

832
01:28:32,706 --> 01:28:38,383
<i>Then there is the kind
that you do not notice at first.</i>

833
01:28:38,507 --> 01:28:43,342
<i>But which adds a little bit
to itself every day.</i>

834
01:28:43,468 --> 01:28:45,902
<i>Like an oyster makes a pearl</i>

835
01:28:46,028 --> 01:28:48,337
<i>grain by grain.</i>

836
01:28:48,467 --> 01:28:50,503
<i>A lewel from the sand.</i>

837
01:28:51,468 --> 01:28:54,301
<i>That is the kind I have come to know.</i>

838
01:28:56,468 --> 01:29:00,427
<i>Sister. Thank you for your letter.</i>

839
01:29:00,549 --> 01:29:02,619
<i>For all your letters.</i>

840
01:29:20,709 --> 01:29:23,940
There has been a change of plan.

841
01:29:25,349 --> 01:29:27,704
I have suggested.

842
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:30,822
And your mother has agreed.

843
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:33,783
That the three of you come later.

844
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:40,468
But who will cook for you. Abba?

845
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:42,979
Who will cut your corns?

846
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:47,070
Don't you know?
I'm a better cook than your mother.

847
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:52,141
Be good girls.

848
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:54,545
Do as your mother tells you.

849
01:29:54,670 --> 01:29:59,266
And do not think there is anything
you are not good enough for.

850
01:29:59,391 --> 01:30:01,780
Remember.

851
01:30:01,911 --> 01:30:03,867
Abba.

852
01:30:05,512 --> 01:30:10,222
- How will we manage without you?
- Your mother is in charge.

853
01:30:10,351 --> 01:30:12,421
I think you should be fine.

854
01:30:14,552 --> 01:30:18,067
Everyone thought I married
a simple girl from the village.

855
01:30:19,793 --> 01:30:21,749
But...

856
01:30:24,392 --> 01:30:26,462
That should do for now.

857
01:30:28,392 --> 01:30:31,190
- I'm sorry.
- Never be sorrv.

858
01:31:04,234 --> 01:31:07,465
<i>When I was born,
the midwife said:</i>

859
01:31:07,594 --> 01:31:12,384
<i>"Dress her for her burial.
This scrap is too weak to feed."</i>

860
01:31:12,514 --> 01:31:15,347
<i>"Take her to the hospital if you must."</i>

861
01:31:15,474 --> 01:31:17,908
<i>"No." said my Amma.</i>

862
01:31:18,035 --> 01:31:21,550
<i>"My child must not
fight against her fate."</i>

863
01:31:21,675 --> 01:31:24,826
<i>"That way. She will be stronger."</i>

864
01:31:26,035 --> 01:31:28,390
Shahana. Amma. Iook.

865
01:31:28,515 --> 01:31:30,267
<i>And so I lived.</i>

866
01:31:34,556 --> 01:31:36,592
<i>Sister.</i>

867
01:31:36,716 --> 01:31:38,991
<i>I have this dream</i>

868
01:31:39,115 --> 01:31:41,549
<i>that you are always running...</i>

869
01:31:43,395 --> 01:31:47,832
<i>and I am torn between two worlds,
leaving you behind.</i>

870
01:31:51,116 --> 01:31:53,471
<i>But then I wake</i>

871
01:31:53,596 --> 01:31:58,147
<i>and see that it is not you
but me who has been running.</i>

872
01:32:00,636 --> 01:32:02,866
<i>Searching for a place</i>

873
01:32:02,997 --> 01:32:05,636
<i>that has already been found.</i>
