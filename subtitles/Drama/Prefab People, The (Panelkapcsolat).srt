JYP's...

00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,649
- Party People!<br>- Party People!

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,120
These artists will sing a duet<br>for the first time on TV.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,489
You know that, right?

("You Are My Everything"<br>by Gummy and Baek Z Young)

7
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,490
(The collaborative performance was<br>a treat to the ears.)

8
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,659
Thank you.

10

(JYP's Party People is<br>for the viewers who drink alone.)

11
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,279
Our initials are JYP.

12
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:22,140
- JYP.<br>- I was so surprised.

13
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,279
- What a rare coincidence!<br>- I know.

14
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:27,020
Shall we have a toast<br>for our initials?

15
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,990
When we clink our glasses,<br>we should say, "JYP". Let's go.

16
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,189
JYP.

17
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,119
- You should have whispered it.<br>- I am sorry.

18
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,460
The two of you sang<br>a lot of OSTs for dramas.

19
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,659
That's right.

20
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,899
("The Woman")

21
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:48,599
("Don't Forget")

22
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,869

("Love You Forever")

26
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,649
There are hit songs...

27
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:09,730
that bring back memories<br>of the dramas when I hear them.

28
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,230
Which ones are the most<br>memorable to you?

29
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:15,800
There is an OST I sang...

30
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,369
that almost went to Z Young.

31
00:04:17,369 --> 00:04:19,300
It's "Because It's You".

32
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:21,099
Z Young was supposed...

33
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:24,839
to sing the song...

34
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,039
for a drama, "Iris".

35
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:29,539
Originally,<br>"Because It's You"...

36
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:31,510
- It was an OST for "Iris".<br>- It was an OST for "Iris"...

37
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,120
- with Z Young as the singer.<br>- That's right.

38
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
That's right.

39
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,849
Then "Don't Forget" wouldn't<br>have been released.

40
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,489
These behind stories are<br>interesting.

41
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:41,060
- They really are.<br>- That's right.

42
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,430
Shall we listen<br>to "Because It's You"?

43
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:45,930
I want to listen to it.

44
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:52,130
("Because It's You" by Gummy)

45
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,969
It brings back memories.

46
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,669
You told me about this song...

47
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:58,310
- in the past.<br>- I think I did.

48
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,180
(The song brought good fortune<br>to both of them.)

49
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,570
(OST for the SBS drama,<br>"Will It Snow for Christmas?")

50
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:18,719
("Because It's You" by Gummy)

51
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,760
My goodness.

52
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,330
(Her enchanting voice captivates<br>the audience in no time.)

53
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,960
Listening to her up close was<br>a bewitching experience.

54
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,399
It was lovely.

55
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,870
Had the song been sung...

56
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,570
by Z Young,

57
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,299
it would have had<br>a completely different feel to it.

58
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:36,310
(What would Z young's<br>"Because It's you" like?)

59
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,250
("Because It's You"<br>by Baek Z Young)

60
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,630
It was great.

61
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,229
- I seriously can't decide...<br>- You could have sung it.

62
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:02,359
which version is better.

63
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,500
The two of you have<br>different styles.

64
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,140
Even though you sang for a moment,<br>it sounded sorrowful.

65
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,640
- We should release a song together.<br>- We really should.

66
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,539
Please write us a song.

67
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,839
- You will sing it together?<br>- Yes, we will.

68
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,979
- We really will.<br>- I am still in a daze.

69
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,710
Now that we got started,

70
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:20,450
we should listen to "Don't Forget".

71
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,820
Please sing it.

72
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,719
(She got "Don't Forget"<br>instead of "Because It's You".)

73
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,190
All right, everyone.

74
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,320
Do you have your drink with you?

75
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,789
This is a song<br>that calls for a drink.

76
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:31,589
Do you have your drink ready?

77
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,839
("Don't Forget"<br>by Baek Z Young)

78
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,589
(He is speechless.)

79
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:09,859
(Had Z Young sung<br>"Because It's You",)

80
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:10,960
("Don't Forget" wouldn't<br>have come to be.)

81
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,259
- It's really nice.<br>- I have so many goosebumps...

82
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:15,729
that I could turn into a goose<br>by the end of the program.

83
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:19,430
Her voice calls for soju.

84
00:09:20,099 --> 00:09:22,940
Do you have soju?

85
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,670
(JYP's Party People is<br>for the viewers who drink alone.)

86
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,410
At JYP's Party People,

87
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,410
there is The Theme Song of My Life.

88
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,979
Gummy, is there a song...

89
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:33,320
- There is a song.<br>- that is special to you?

90
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,719
It's a song of mine.

91
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:38,619
I was a trainee for seven years.

92
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:42,089
Back in my days,<br>there wasn't a set system...

93
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,229
for the trainees.

94
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:46,530
- We had to train by ourselves.<br>- That's right.

95
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,800
I endured the difficult times<br>and debuted.

96
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,400
I was determined to show<br>my talent upon my debut.

97
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,769
However, I had vocal cord nodules<br>as soon as I debuted.

98
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,280
I couldn't perform<br>at music programs.

99
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,339
I felt bad for my agency.

100
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:06,950
I was scared that<br>I might not be able to sing again.

101
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,550
It was a difficult time.

102
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:12,690
I even thought about taking...

103
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,219
a different path.

104
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:16,859
And I struggled a lot<br>because it came...

105
00:10:16,859 --> 00:10:19,129
with a financial problem.

106
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,930
It's scary. It really is.

107
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,499
Thinking about taking<br>a different job...

108
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,969
brings tears to our eyes.

109
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:30,070
I can't imagine taking<br>a different job.

110
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,639
Sometimes, artists say,

111
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,349
"I will sing<br>as long as there is one person..."

112
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:38,810
"who listens to my songs."

113
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,479
An employee at the agency said,

114
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:45,989
"It will be sad<br>if I can't hear your songs."

115
00:10:45,989 --> 00:10:47,859
My fans also cheered me on.

116
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,330
Listening to them made me think,

117
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,290
"I shouldn't be like this."

118
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,430
That's when I began to train again.

119
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,859
I started from the beginning.

120
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:59,900
I changed my vocalization a lot.

121
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,239
I wasn't completely healed...

122
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:05,410
when I recorded the second album.

123
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,979
The title song was "Memory Loss".

124
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:09,180
- Really?<br>- Yes.

125
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,050
The agency was against it.

126
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,050
Thankfully, the song...

127
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,249
- made me okay.<br>- It did?

128
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:20,589
You might not understand, but...

129
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,859
Please give us some tissues.

130
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,989
It's okay. I held back my tears.

131
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:28,129
(Gummy's The Theme Song of My Life)

132
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:30,269
("Memory Loss" kept her dream<br>of becoming a singer.)

133
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:31,499
That happened.

134
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:33,869
It was a desperate dream...

135
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:35,900
- that you pursued for seven years.<br>- Yes.

136
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:38,410
When you felt like<br>everything had ended,

137
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,580
this song led you back...

138
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,379
- to your dream.<br>- Yes.

139
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,950
(It made her practice singing<br>once again.)

140
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,820
(That's why "Memory Loss" is<br>so precious to her.)

141
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,019
Thank you.

142
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:51,889
I love this song. My goodness.

143
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:55,660
("Memory Loss" by Gummy)

144
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,430
That was the song. Thank you.

145
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,060
(Gummy sang the song<br>with despair and hope.)

146
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,259
It's incredible to hear you<br>sing the song up close.

147
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,170
- It's so nice.<br>- Thank you.

148
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:16,839
After that experience,

149
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:21,680
I realized how arrogant I was<br>to think about quitting.

150
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,410
There are artists<br>who struggle more than me.

151
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,790
I can relate to Gummy's words.

152
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,519
As you know, many things happened<br>after I debuted.

153
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:36,690
What was good at first isn't...

154
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,060
always good in the end.

155
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,629
What was bad at first isn't...

156
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:44,830
always bad in the end.

157
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,800
- That's right.<br>- It's important to get used to it.

158
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,369
You need to get used to it.

159
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,080
This is your chance...

160
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,780
to get drunk and sleep<br>on a Saturday night.

161
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,450
Gummy and Z Young will sing a duet.

162
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,389

- Party People!<br>- Party People!

169
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,739
Everyone, this group is<br>the symbol of an idol group...

not only in Korea,<br>but also all around the world.

171

(EXO is the symbol of K-Pop<br>all over the world.)

177
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:42,370
All right.

178
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,170
EXO is a group<br>that doesn't need explanations.

179
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,680
Your newest song is "Power".

180
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,309
- Yes.<br>- Your newest album...

181

sold million copies once again.

182
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:55,180
I don't know how to explain<br>this incredible feat.

183

It has happened<br>with all four of your albums.

184
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,519
Yes, it did.

185
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,259
That's right.<br>It happened four years in a row.

186

191
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,239
Did the fact hit you?

192
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:20,539
To be honest,

193
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:23,979
it doesn't hit us<br>when we hear about it.

194
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:27,880
It doesn't show on<br>our account balances right away.

195
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,620
(He can relate to it.)

196
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:35,420
First, EXO seems a bit<br>out of place here.

197
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,729
It's strange to see EXO in the club.

198
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:40,700
Have you watched this program?

199

- Really? Who is it?<br>- Xiumin.

- Really?<br>- Yes.

204
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:52,769
When I am alone at home,<br>I turn on the TV...

205
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,309
and drink lightly.

206
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,680
It feels great.

207
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,180
This program was made<br>for people like that.

208
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,019
- I guess it suited your taste.<br>- Yes. I enjoy watching it.

209
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,289
All right.

210
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,319
It will be a special night...

211
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:12,090
in which you can enjoy<br>drinking with EXO.

212

on the stage as well as<br>in music videos and concerts.

Please introduce yourself.

224

Don't talk about your position<br>in the group.

225
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,700
- Talk about who you really are.<br>- Okay.

226
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,700
I feel like I am in a group date.

227

Who do you think will be the best<br>at introducing himself?

228

(He looks bright.)

235
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:19,999
I am well-known<br>for having a face...

236
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:22,130
that would receive approval<br>from a woman's parents.

237
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:25,930
My future fiance's parents will<br>approve of me right away.

(The piano?)

253

Please wait.<br>I have to check the chords.

I play drums, guitar, bass,<br>and piano.

Do you know why<br>I started learning the drums?

277
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,829
I saw an older boy<br>playing the drum game at an arcade.

278

I thought it was so cool...

So who's next?

Hello, I'm D.O.

(D.O was born in 1993.)

292

I'm a normal guy who's<br>enjoying life in his 20s.

There's nothing special<br>I'm talented at.

294
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,340
He's a good actor,<br>so he's being modest.

295
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,680
Also, D.O is a talented singer<br>and a great dancer.

296

He's also good at acting...

which makes him<br>an irreplaceable member.

298
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,819
Is he normally this shy?

299
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:40,190
- Yes.<br>- Always.

300
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:45,160
Contrary to what people think,<br>D.O is very humorous.

301
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,360
He doesn't joke very often,

302
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,269
but he's hysterical when he does.

303
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:52,630
I'd love to see that once<br>before the end of today's show.

304
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:57,809
We should at least know<br>what you mean by his funny bone.

305
00:24:57,809 --> 00:24:59,509
- It'll be a challenge.<br>- He's right.

306
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:02,410
- If he does though...<br>- Consider yourselves lucky.

309

It's D.O and Baek Hyun.

310

- These two.<br>- Yes, them.

311
00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:14,519
They say opposites attract,<br>so do you get along well?

312
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:16,930
- How are you two?<br>- We're very close.

313
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,630
He tells me when<br>I should stop fooling around.

314
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,999
If I go too far,<br>D.O hits me in the back of my neck.

315
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:25,829
So that's when I stop.

316
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:28,739

00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:37,880
As you can tell,<br>I'm quite tall and...

320
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,749
(Embarrassed)

321
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:41,620
- I bet you're embarrassed.<br>- I am.

322
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,090
To be honest, he surprised me<br>when he just introduced himself.

323
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:50,829
When he's on stage dancing,<br>he can't be ruder or more arrogant.

324
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:53,729
- You know what I mean.<br>- He's very charismatic.

325
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,729
He dances as if he's<br>looking down on everyone.

326
00:25:57,729 --> 00:26:00,600
- He thinks he's the best.<br>- Right.

327
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,370
You really are a phenomenal dancer.<br>I was surprised at first.

328
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,640
- Really?<br>- When he introduced himself though,

329
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,509
he seemed very shy.

330
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:09,440
Is he always like that?

331
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:13,049
He's like a sweet girl backstage.

332
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,979
- That's right.<br>- He's quiet and shy.

333
00:26:15,979 --> 00:26:19,090
(He becomes quiet and shy<br>the soon as he walks off the stage.)

334
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,130
Lastly, it's our youngest Se Hun.

335
00:26:25,989 --> 00:26:29,729
Hello, I'm Oh Se Hun,<br>the youngest member of EXO.

336
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,130
There's a maturity to him though.

337
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,440
(Still, he's the youngest.)

338
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,370
As the youngest member,

339
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,509
which of the other seven<br>do you find most scary?

340
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,309
I'm actually afraid of all of them.

341
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,549
Liar!

342
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:45,910
- No way.<br>- He's making us look bad.

343
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,979
- He's trying to play the victim.<br>- What's the matter?

344
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,289
He's lying.

345
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,920
Yes, it's a lie.

346
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:55,890
He's very mischievous.

347
00:26:56,259 --> 00:26:59,360
He's also super adorable as well.

348
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,370
He loves to drink nearly<br>as much as Xiumin does.

349
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,100
(Really?)

350
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,840
He's friendly and very loyal.

351
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:15,579
Se Hun, when do you want<br>to have a drink?

352
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,009
When I'm happy or sad...

353
00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:22,420
- Always and every day.<br>- I love sharing.

354
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,350
You want to drink when...

355
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,019
you feel joy, anger,<br>sorrow, and pleasure.

356
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,259
(Se Hun loves to<br>drink at all times.)

357
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,789
Where do you<br>normally have drinks then?

358
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,400
We drink a lot together<br>back at our house.

359
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,529
After a concert abroad<br>or an award ceremony,

360
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:39,969
we'd regather after dinner...

361
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:42,200
back in my room.

362
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:45,640
My room ends up a mess.

363
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,910
We feel most comfortable<br>messing up his room.

364
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,410
(Su Ho's the best for everything.)

365
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:52,450
- You've been singers for six years.<br>- Right.

366
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,950
I'm sure there have been moments...

367
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,450
where one or all of you<br>lost your focus.

368
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,950
How do you regroup<br>when that happens?

369
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,519
We've never gotten<br>into a fist fight...

370
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:04,660
nor have ever<br>raised our voices and argued.

371
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,759
That's possible because...

372
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:09,400
none of us show our anger<br>right on the spot.

373
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,100
We'd all keep to ourselves first,

374
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,499
and then address each other<br>over a few drinks later on.

375
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,269
When we do,

376
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,880
we're brutally honest.

377
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:23,850
We'd lay out everything<br>that we had bottled up inside.

378
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,319
- I learned how petty we can be.<br>- We say things like this.

379
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:28,350
We seem to remember<br>every little incident.

380
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:32,049
This is what I think of our dynamic.

381
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:33,890
There are some people...

382
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,960
who can't take being<br>criticized of their actions.

383
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,660
Normally, we get angry.

384
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,759
What's great about<br>our members is...

385
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:44,630
that everybody is willing to listen<br>and take constructive criticism.

386
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:47,769
Out of you all,<br>who is worst at taking it?

387
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,539
- When notified of flaws...<br>- It's Su Ho.

388
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,269
It's Su Ho.

389
00:28:52,469 --> 00:28:53,880
(He gives up.)

390
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:56,880
- Isn't he the leader?<br>- I'm not being funny.

391
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:01,319
Su Ho is a man of great pride,

392
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:03,489
so he sometimes doesn't admit...

393
00:29:03,489 --> 00:29:05,120
that he's wrong.

394
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:08,819
Before you said that,<br>I thought Su Ho was perfect.

395
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,590
All right.

396
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:14,259
So as I was putting<br>together today's show,

397
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:16,999
there was one thing<br>I really wanted you to do.

398
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,499
I wanted to hear<br>you sing in real life.

399
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,340
Not as singers on stage,

400
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,370
but as young men who are<br>just singing next to us.

401
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:28,039
Do you know what I'm talking about?

402
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,380
- Yes.<br>- Yes!

403
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:35,120
("Call Me Baby" by EXO)

404
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,559
(Just with the guitar<br>and their voices,)

405
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,460
(the song brings them closer to us.)

406
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,170
I loved that. I've never<br>heard you like this before.

407
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:36,140
Don't you feel like<br>you're closer to them now?

408
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,340
- Yes.<br>- Yes.

409
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:40,410
That was really great.<br>Is there another song you can sing?

410
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,509
(One more please)

411
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:43,509
Is there any other song?

412
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:48,279
(They suddenly sing the song,<br>"Creep", which is a song...)

413
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:50,019
(Korean boyfriends love to sing.)

414
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,059
(The real live EXO sings<br>an acoustic cover of the song.)

415
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:36,160
(This very special moment)

416
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,289
(The late night date<br>with EXO will continue)

417
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:14,769
(Party People, Fall Night with EXO)

418
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:18,009
Today, we're meeting EXO as<br>young men that they are.

419
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,509
When we meet you<br>in real life though,

420
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,049
you'll sing songs<br>since you're still singers.

421
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,019
When we're on dates though,

422
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:29,549
- we usually don't sing our songs.<br>- Of course not.

423
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,219
- It's too weird.<br>- We can't sing "Growl".

424
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:32,450
So if you're...

425
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,489
"Growl"?

426
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,960
No matter how romantically<br>you make it sound,

427
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,029
you can't change its lyrics.

428
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:41,259
- Of course not.<br>- Right.

429
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:43,799
It'd be funny if you sang it though.

430
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:50,009
(What if they sang "Growl"<br>to their real-life girlfriend?)

431
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:52,769
(It'd be weird.)

432
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:57,650
Let's imagine that you're<br>on a date with your girlfriend.

433
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,019
When you someday meet someone,

434
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:01,380
which song would you sing?

435
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,779
Is there one you enjoy singing?

436
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:07,259
(Please, no.<br>They should never date.)

437
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,590
They don't like the idea<br>of us dating.

438
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:13,499
They can't be alone all their lives.

439
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:15,199
(They're still against it.)

440
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:18,300
What about when they're 40?

441
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,599
(No!)

442
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:22,269
- No?<br>- What about at 50?

443
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,639
What do you say to 50?

444
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,139
Should they live alone forever?

445
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,210
We'll date right before we die then.

446
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,979
My gosh.

447
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,249
- When they're at retirement homes.<br>- At retirement homes?

448
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,760
Okay, we'll agree on that then.

449
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,159
(They can only date when they're<br>at retirement homes.)

450
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,990
At a retirement home...

451
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,460
(What would you sing as a serenade<br>at a retirement home?)

452
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,729
Let's say that you ran into<br>your first love.

453
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,070
At a retirement home?

454
00:34:50,229 --> 00:34:52,329
What will you sing<br>to this old friend?

455
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,440
- She's old too so...<br>- That they approve of.

456
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,340
- What about my age<br>- What about my age

457
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:02,979
- It's the perfect age to love<br>- It's the perfect age to love

458
00:35:02,979 --> 00:35:04,449
Everybody, cha cha cha

459
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,320
What would you like to sing?

460
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:11,320
("Gashina"!)

461
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,460
- "Gashina".<br>- "Gashina" by Sun Mi.

462
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,690
"Gashina"?

463
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,599
(How could you leave me<br>at a retirement home?)

464
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,940
Who is best at<br>girl group choreography?

465
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,269
- It's Su Ho?<br>- Why would you say that?

466
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,440
I'm not good at all.

467
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,880
(He keeps pointing<br>at Su Ho for everything.)

468
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,809
Should we see him dance<br>to a girl group's song?

469
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,749
Shy shy shy? That I can do.

470
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,889
As I met a friend, shy shy shy

471
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:47,920
My goodness.

472
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,090
Dance to "Red Flavor".

473
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,190
I can't.

474
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:53,199
You're dressed in red,<br>so you should.

475
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,429
(Baek Hyun's logic)

476
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,199
(The vivacious<br>"Red Flavor" by Red Velvet)

477
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:00,800
(How will Su Ho dance to the song?)

478
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,199
I really can't do this.

479
00:36:12,749 --> 00:36:17,150
(He does his best.)

480
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,289
(They're satisfied.)

481
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:25,590
- That was adorable.<br>- You're quite good.

482
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,960
- That was amazing.<br>- No, it was not!

483
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,699
You did great.

484
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:34,599
Who else has a favorite song?

485
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,240
- Chen.<br>- To be honest,

486
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,280
there's a song that I've had<br>on my playlist for years.

487
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,409
The song that I never replace is...

488
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,849
"Sunday Morning" by Maroon 5.

489
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:46,380
(Chen's favorite song is<br>"Sunday Morning" by Maroon 5.)

490
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,420
Here we are with EXO today,<br>and Chen will sing next.

491
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,690
Please give him a round of applause.

492
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:56,059
(The sweet Chen brings<br>you this song on Saturday.)

493
00:36:56,059 --> 00:37:00,630
(Chen sings "Sunday Morning"<br>accompanied by the band.)

494
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,570
("Sunday Morning" by Maroon 5)

495
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,110
(A sweet song on this fall night)

496
00:38:22,949 --> 00:38:24,079
Nice.

497
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:26,720
That was amazing.

498
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:27,949
You were great.

499
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:30,849
You proved just how<br>good of a singer you are.

500
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:32,590
(It proved just how good he is.)

501
00:38:32,749 --> 00:38:34,619
How can we not<br>fall in love with you after that?

502
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:41,059
If there's one thing that Korea<br>successfully exported,

503
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:43,929
- it's K-pop.<br>- That's right.

504
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:47,900
Idol singers are<br>at the center of it,

505
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,710
and EXO is the leading group.

506
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,909
Something strange has been<br>going on recently.

507
00:38:54,909 --> 00:38:56,780
Among global fans,

508
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,820
the Ko Ko Bop Challenge has<br>become a thing.

509
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,889
In the Philippines,<br>even the vice president joined in.

510
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,320
- Really?<br>- Yes, it happened.

511
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:11,429
(The Ko Ko Bop Challenge is<br>a globally spreading act...)

512
00:39:11,429 --> 00:39:16,570
(of people filming videos<br>of them dancing to "Ko Ko Bop".)

513
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,130
(A former vice president<br>also joined in the fun.)

514
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,340
Before we knew it,<br>it became a widespread challenge.

515
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:26,679
It was even featured on the news<br>in America and Argentina.

516
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:29,280
We took a look at it...

517
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,510
and we were quite flustered<br>by the whole thing at first.

518
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,349
We've always wanted<br>to express our gratitude.

519
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,050
If I'm being honest...

520
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,119
I don't know if<br>this an appropriate term,

521
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,519
but in this industry,

522
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:41,559
we say that you got lucky.

523
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:43,429
Yes, it's exactly that.

524
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:44,490
It happened to me too.

525
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,860
I had no idea that<br>"shy shy shy" would be a hit.

526
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,599
It was just a line in the song<br>but suddenly,

527
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,670
people became infatuated with it.

528
00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:57,010
This challenge is also<br>very similar in that way.

529
00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:01,679
Shouldn't we see<br>the original artist of the song...

530
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:03,249
participate in the challenge too?

531
00:40:03,249 --> 00:40:05,510
(How will it look when<br>it's done by the original artist?)

532
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,479
Let me lay out the situation.

533
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:09,690
The viewers are probably<br>in bed ready to sleep.

534
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,920
They're sipping beer when...

535
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,289
(He has intrigued<br>those already in bed.)

536
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:19,630
That's how it should be.

537
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:22,829
- It needs to be easy to follow.<br>- Sure.

538
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:25,269
First, you start with a jump.

539
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:26,740
(The choreography that<br>mesmerized the world)

540
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,170
(1. Move your body back and forth.)

541
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,240
(2. Spread your arms like so.)

542
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,780
That's how the original goes.

543
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,949
(I see.)

544
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,309
That's the choreography,

545
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:41,119
but it's like this...

546
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:42,780
in the challenge.

547
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,249
(They shake their bodies more.)

548
00:40:45,249 --> 00:40:46,320
Like this.

549
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,559
Like this.

550
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:50,889
You have to be<br>doing something else...

551
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:52,860
and dance when the hook starts.

552
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,530
- Suddenly.<br>- Yes, that's how it should be.

553
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,699
So keep that in mind as you dance.

554
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:01,099
The same goes to<br>everyone in the audience too.

555
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:03,639
You should be preoccupied...

556
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,740
and then suddenly dance<br>when the hook starts.

557
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,449
We'll film that and<br>post in on social media.

558
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:13,380
Let's all participate in this.

559
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:22,289
(Ko Ko Bop Challenge,<br>the worldwide phenomenon)

560
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,889
(Ko Ko Bop Challenge<br>at Party People)

561
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:27,559
(They all seem preoccupied.)

562
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,800
(This isn't even his cell.)

563
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:31,599
(The host of Party People)

564
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:32,999
(Even Jin Young participates.)

565
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:35,740
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.<br>- Winner can flick one on the loser.

566
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:37,740
Rock-paper-scissors.

567
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,940
(They play rock-paper-scissors.)

568
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,210
(The best actor of the bunch.)

569
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:43,349
Chen, what's on your mind?

570
00:41:57,889 --> 00:41:59,760
(Only he dances at double speed.)

571
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,119
Finally, we can post a video...

572
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,990
of EXO participating<br>in the Ko Ko Bop Challenge.

573
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,329
It's been six years<br>since your debut.

574
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:37,729
Is there a moment<br>that you still remember?

575
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,970
Yes, our first showcase.

576
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:43,309
That day,

577
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,970
the first song<br>we sang was "History".

578
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,110
(They debuted by singing "History".)

579
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:50,610
- It was the first time on stage.<br>- We were facing back...

580
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,949
and waiting for the song to start.

581
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:56,019
(They still can't forget<br>the thrill of that day.)

582
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,519
I still can't forget<br>the thrill of that day.

583
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,289
Later on, in life when I grow old...

584
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,030
and have kids...

585
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,800
(He tries to be sentimental.)

586
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,900
Well...

587
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,999
(Kids?)

588
00:43:08,999 --> 00:43:12,570
I'm talking about my imaginary kids.

589
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:14,400
So my kids...

590
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,940
You agreed that he could date<br>at a retirement home.

591
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,809
If my kid asks when was<br>the best time...

592
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:21,139
in my life...

593
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:23,809
Let's say...

594
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:27,280
that my dog finally<br>learned how to talk.

595
00:43:28,249 --> 00:43:30,289
His barking can now be translated.

596
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,059
When my dog asks<br>about the best time in my life,

597
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:35,119
I'll tell him...

598
00:43:35,889 --> 00:43:39,429
that it was when<br>I first debuted as a singer.

599
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:40,999
That's what I'll say.

600
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,400
You've been in the industry<br>for six years.

601
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,340
Who trained the longest?

602
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,340
- Su Ho.<br>- Su Ho.

603
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,940
For how long?

604
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,539
Six and a half years.

605
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,079
You trained for 6.5 years and<br>you've been a singer for 6 years.

606
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:54,979
- That's right.<br>- That's 13 years.

607
00:43:54,979 --> 00:43:57,749
- So for nearly 13 years...<br>- That's right.

608
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,679
You've been doing this<br>for nearly 13 years.

609
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,780
There are so many restrictions.

610
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,119
You can't relax that easily,

611
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:06,220
and you can't<br>simply go out for drinks...

612
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,760
with your friends.

613
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,530
You have to be careful<br>in every aspect...

614
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:11,860
and many restrictions follow.

615
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,659
I do imagine that<br>it'll be stressful...

616
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:16,099
though I've never lived<br>that life before.

617
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:19,530
So what or who comforts you<br>when you're feeling down?

618
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,710
In my case, I travel a lot.

619
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:27,210
I guess I want to be free.<br>Since many recognize me though,

620
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,510
I tend to go on travel...

621
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:31,809
somewhere far away from Korea.

622
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:36,220
That's how I relieve my stress.<br>I also talk to my teammates,

623
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,889
listen to a lot of music,<br>and watch many movies.

624
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,920
Is there a song that<br>you find comfort in?

625
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,490
"I Want to Fall in Love".

626
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,729
("I Want to Fall in Love"<br>by Kim Jo Han)

627
00:44:46,729 --> 00:44:50,829
- I can relate a lot to the lyrics.<br>- I see.

628
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,139
It's definitely how I'd feel.

629
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:54,869
You see...

630
00:44:54,869 --> 00:44:57,309
(Su Ho can relate to<br>"I Want to Fall in Love".)

631
00:44:57,309 --> 00:44:59,840
I work out, I do my work,

632
00:45:00,409 --> 00:45:01,409
and see movies on weekends.

633
00:45:01,409 --> 00:45:03,280
- That's how the lyrics go.<br>- Right.

634
00:45:03,949 --> 00:45:06,679
I go to book stores...

635
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:09,789
and see if there are<br>any good books to read.

636
00:45:10,389 --> 00:45:13,590
I buy them only to<br>leave them on my bookshelf.

637
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,119
(They're for decoration.)

638
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,559
- Are you decorating?<br>- Exactly.

639
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,760
You're like the protagonist<br>in the song.

640
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:24,369
Could we perhaps hear<br>you sing this song?

641
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:26,499
Come on.

642
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,639
My goodness.

643
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,510
(The Theme Song of My Life)

644
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:37,150
("I Want to Fall in Love" by Su Ho)

645
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,380
("I Want to Fall in Love"<br>by Su Ho)

646
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,490
(Su Ho sang the song<br>from the bottom of his heart.)

647
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:54,619
Thank you.

648
00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:56,729
(Su Ho sang the song<br>from the bottom of his heart.)

649
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:58,789
You sounded so sincere just now.

650
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:01,860
It must've been because<br>you feel this way too.

651
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:04,470
This song...

652
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,340
After our concerts,

653
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,769
I'm sometimes in a state<br>of despondency.

654
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:13,840
That's how I'd feel,

655
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,949
but having my teammates...

656
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,650
and our fans really help.

657
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,550
(He has his teammates and his fans.)

658
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:24,220
That's why I enjoy this life.

659
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,360
(Su Ho enjoys his life.)

660
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,789
(He's happy at this moment,<br>thanks to his fans.)

661
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,400
While filming today's show,<br>I suddenly got curious.

662
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:42,039
Whenever I look at D.O,<br>it seems like he has...

663
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:43,409
a lot he wants to say.

664
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:46,639
Are you restraining<br>yourself from talking...

665
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:48,409
or do you really don't want to talk?

666
00:47:48,409 --> 00:47:49,909
Which is it?

667
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,610
- The former.<br>- Is it?

668
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:53,949
You do have something to say.

669
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:56,889
So during your six years<br>in the industry,

670
00:47:56,889 --> 00:47:58,590
what do you remember the most?

671
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,789
(What made the<br>biggest impact on him?)

672
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:05,130
There isn't anything<br>that I specially remember.

673
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,929
(He's unpredictable.)

674
00:48:07,929 --> 00:48:08,929
Are you sure?

675
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:10,970
- Everything is memorable.<br>- That must be.

676
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:12,800
You probably aren't able<br>to name just one.

677
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,240
Tell me at least you have one.

678
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:16,539
Well, you see...

679
00:48:16,539 --> 00:48:21,079
I don't like to add meanings<br>to specific events.

680
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:22,380
(He's being honest for 100 percent.)

681
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,050
That's why I...

682
00:48:24,909 --> 00:48:27,820
Do you hate me for what I said?

683
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:31,789
This is all because<br>I'm not good with words.

684
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,960
Let me ask you...

685
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:38,760
about your life as<br>an insanely popular idol singer.

686
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:40,499
Does it suit you...

687
00:48:40,499 --> 00:48:43,570
or does it sometimes go against<br>who you truly are?

688
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,170
I do find myself<br>not fitting in a lot.

689
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:49,570
(The life of fame doesn't<br>always suit him.)

690
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,139
I'm in my 20s,

691
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:57,110
and it's difficult<br>not being able to...

692
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,920
walk down the street<br>without being recognized.

693
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,990
That's how I feel.

694
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:08,659
I thought about quitting<br>many times too.

695
00:49:09,659 --> 00:49:12,090
I'm trying to be honest here.

696
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,559
Everyone will probably<br>say the same thing.

697
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,329
Life isn't easy no matter<br>who you are and what you do.

698
00:49:19,329 --> 00:49:20,599
(Everyone in their 20s will feel<br>the same way.)

699
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:24,269
Being with my teammates is<br>what keeps me going I guess.

700
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,979
I feel the same way.<br>In fact, we're all the same.

701
00:49:27,979 --> 00:49:31,110
We just have a slightly<br>different job than others.

702
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,749
One that's different, not special.

703
00:49:33,749 --> 00:49:36,249
We receive huge amounts<br>of love and support,

704
00:49:36,249 --> 00:49:37,789
and it's our job...

705
00:49:37,789 --> 00:49:39,990
to know how to give back that love.

706
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:43,659
Being loved this much by someone...

707
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:48,860
and to have so many people<br>think of me are...

708
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,229
something to truly be grateful for.

709
00:49:51,229 --> 00:49:54,300
So thinking about that...

710
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:59,639
gives me the strength<br>to keep going on as an artist.

711
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:03,409
Whenever I feel down<br>or doubt myself recently,

712
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:08,380
I think about how I'm blessed<br>to have this kind of job.

713
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:12,389
(The 6th-year boy band...)

714

(expresses their gratitude<br>to their fans.)

715
00:50:14,289 --> 00:50:16,360

716
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,360
("Hug Me" by Chan Yeol)

717
00:51:42,979 --> 00:51:45,010
I'll leave it at that.<br>Thank you.

718
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:49,820
(He sings of how deeply<br>grateful he is to his fans.)

719
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,789
Now, it's time to talk about<br>your new single "Power".

720
00:51:54,789 --> 00:51:56,190
(Their single went platinum<br>for the 4th time.)

721
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,289
With "Power",

722
00:51:58,289 --> 00:52:01,599
we wish to give our fans<br>a surge of energy.

723
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,670
(They wish to bring them energy.)

724
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:08,869
We make this shape with our arm<br>a lot during the song.

725
00:52:08,869 --> 00:52:11,809
(They incorporated this move<br>a lot in their choreography.)

726
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,280
We drew inspiration from the gym...

727
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,409
in terms of arm workouts,

728
00:52:16,409 --> 00:52:18,679
back workouts, and push-ups.

729
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:21,550
We all workout at the gym,<br>so we do the bodybuilder pose too.

730
00:52:21,979 --> 00:52:24,720
- D.O, you should show them.<br>- What a great idea.

731
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,059
(We got that power)

732
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:39,099
(We're now stronger)

733
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,740
You should incorporate<br>those moves in the song today.

734
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,139
We'll change up the choreography.

735
00:52:48,139 --> 00:52:49,749
Since this is<br>an exclusive performance,

736
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:53,619
we'll see them perform "Power"...

737
00:52:55,019 --> 00:52:56,449
with the bodybuilder pose in it.

738
00:52:56,449 --> 00:53:01,190
("Power" by EXO)

739
00:56:42,949 --> 00:56:44,909
(A song about how<br>they can be stronger...)

740
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:46,849
(by joining forces with<br>their fans through music.)

741
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:55,720
(Only on Party People)

742
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:00,130
(It's the bodybuilder<br>cover of "Power".)

743
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,070
What I'm about to say can be<br>a bit scary.

744
00:57:09,909 --> 00:57:12,769
New Kids on the Block,<br>The Backstreet Boys,

745
00:57:13,409 --> 00:57:14,909
H.O.T, and g.o.d.

746
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:17,909
There were many boy bands<br>in this world,

747
00:57:18,349 --> 00:57:23,050
but none of them were able<br>to stay at the top forever.

748
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:24,949
It's practically impossible.

749
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:29,260
Many people are still biased<br>when it comes to boy bands.

750
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:31,690
It's the same with the fans.

751
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:35,059
Many draw a line<br>between being a fan...

752
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:38,269
of an artist or a boy band.

753
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:41,099
Fans of boy bands<br>or girl groups are called...

754
00:57:41,769 --> 00:57:44,269
groupies, which is<br>a derogatory term.

755
00:57:44,269 --> 00:57:45,570
(Idols and their fans are<br>looked down upon.)

756
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:48,179
To be honest though,

757
00:57:48,179 --> 00:57:50,579
I don't want our fans<br>to be called that way.

758
00:57:50,949 --> 00:57:54,780
I want us to be the ones<br>who shatter those opinions.

759
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:57,690
You need to move from just being<br>popular to earning recognition.

760
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:01,190
It's easier said than done though.

761
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:04,789
It's tough.<br>It's really tough.

762
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,599
You not only have to be talented,

763
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:09,400
but you must convince<br>those who are biased too.

764
00:58:09,869 --> 00:58:13,840
Your popularity might go up or down,

765
00:58:14,369 --> 00:58:17,670
but earned recognition is<br>somewhat permanent.

766
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:19,780
Once you're recognized as an artist,

767
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,909
you can stay relevant forever.

768
00:58:22,909 --> 00:58:25,210
I believe in myself<br>and my teammates.

769
00:58:25,749 --> 00:58:29,249
Our fans will always have our backs,

770
00:58:29,849 --> 00:58:31,389
so we'll get there too.

771
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:34,889
You're really sweet.

772
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:38,490
I'm trying to think<br>of another adjective,

773
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:39,929
but that suits you the most.

774
00:58:39,929 --> 00:58:42,360
You'll be able to reach your goal...

775
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:45,030
with this level<br>of teamwork and trust.

776
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:48,039
EXO's rival is EXO from last year.

777
00:58:48,139 --> 00:58:51,970
(EXO's rival is<br>always EXO from last year.)

778
00:58:52,369 --> 00:58:53,909
So today,

779
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:55,679
you met with EXO.

780
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,179
Now, they'll bring you<br>an exclusive performance...

781
00:58:59,179 --> 00:59:01,519
of "Boomerang".<br>Please give it up for EXO.

782
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:09,119
("Boomerang" by EXO)

783
01:02:05,269 --> 01:02:06,340
Thank you.
