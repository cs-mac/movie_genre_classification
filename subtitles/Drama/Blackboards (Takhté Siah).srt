BLACKBOARDS
a film by Samira MAKHMALBAF

2
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,652
- Said!
- Yes?

3
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,725
Thanks for your water.

4
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,761
- You've drunk it all!
- I was thirsty. I'm sorry.

5
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,429
Forget it.

6
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,592
Where did you go yesterday?

7
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,559
To Dezle.

8
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,031
Why?

9
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,003
Looking for pupils.

10
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,608
But no luck,

11
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,937
I couldn't find any.

12
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,913
I was there for three days.

13
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,116
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

14
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,108
I don't smoke.

15
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,143
You couldn't find any pupils?

16
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,587
Not one.

17
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,124
My father warned me

18
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,726
but I didn't listen to him

19
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,263
and now,

20
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,065
I truly regret it.

21
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,597
- You studied for long?
- Two years.

22
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,436
You became a teacher in two years?

23
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,871
I worked hard.

24
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,942
- You like it?
- Not really.

25
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,034
Why?

26
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,781
I looked for three days and I found nothing.

27
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,151
I didn't listen to my father.

28
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:29,255
- What did he tell you to do?
- To be a shepherd.

29
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,123
I failed.

30
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:22,932
He's gone.

31
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,368
Get up.

32
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,210
Hurry UP!

33
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,152
And your wife?

34
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,130
When we got back from Tehran,

35
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:51,794
we had a fight about the doctor.

36
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:57,099
Her family insulted my family.
Mine responded in kind.

37
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,269
So her father took her.

38
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,011
Hurry up. We have to hide him.

39
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,641
It's been three months

40
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,478
since she went back with her father.

41
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,043
She left me with three kids,
one of them just a baby.

42
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,817
I tried to find him a wet nurse.

43
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,621
I went through a hundred families

44
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,892
to find one.

45
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,861
As a result

46
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,723
he's drunk the milk of many women,
even cows.

47
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,397
He looks like a hundred different women.

48
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,498
He's got the eyes of one,
the ears of another.

49
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,769
And he's sick.

50
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,740
Now I run from village to village

51
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,240
looking for a pupil I can make into a doctor.

52
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,941
That way, we'd never have to go into town.

53
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:45,722
If there was a doctor in the next village,

54
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:49,454
things would be easier.

55
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,987
- You're going to make a doctor?
- Yes.

56
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,834
- Which path are you taking?
- The one on the right.

57
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,328
It's dangerous.

58
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,766
- Which way are you going?
- This way.

59
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,532
But it's very dangerous.

60
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,206
Wait.

61
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,708
I'll tell you again, it's a death trap.

62
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,151
Yours is even worse.

63
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,154
No. Yours is more dangerous. Goodbye.

64
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,254
- Where are you going now?
- To the village.

65
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,061
- Can I come with you?
- If you like.

66
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,893
If we go together,
do you think we'll find any pupils?

67
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,070
- I'm not coming.
- Why?

68
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,070
I want to go to the top.

69
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,667
- How many pupils will you find?
- Two or three.

70
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,504
Fine. Keep them.

71
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,749
I'm going to climb to the very top.

72
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,781
The villages bring me bad luck.

73
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,492
My fortune lies up there.

74
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,994
Go on, you take the villages.
I'm going up there.

75
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,596
Take care.

76
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,931
Goodbye.

77
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,938
Hello!

78
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,072
Hello!

79
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,017
Is there a school here?

80
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,588
I don't know.

81
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,214
And a teacher?

82
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,326
I don't know.

83
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,094
No idea.

84
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,555
Goodbye.

85
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,532
- And I'm sorry.
- The Lord go with you.

86
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,200
Excuse me!

87
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,228
Wait a minute.

88
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:49,832
What?

89
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,277
Please, read me this letter.

90
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,192
What is it?

91
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,389
What does he say?

92
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,797
Hold on.

93
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,166
Where does it come from?

94
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,139
This letter isn't in Persian.

95
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,370
For the love of God, read it to me.

96
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:32,315
It's from your son? It's not in Persian.
Maybe Arabic?

97
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,610
Where's it from?

98
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,782
From Iraq.

99
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:45,962
I don't know if it's in Arabic,
Turkish or Kurdish.

100
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,691
It's from my son.

101
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:52,060
But from where? I can't read it.

102
00:09:57,296 --> 00:10:00,106
He writes that he's in good health.

103
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,472
He sends his regards to you.

104
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,273
I return them.

105
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,048
Next, he greets his mother,

106
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,950
his sister, his father and his brother

107
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,053
and no doubt his uncles and his aunts...

108
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,052
Wait.

109
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,427
He finishes by saying goodbye.

110
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,903
But how is he getting by?
Has he got money?

111
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,569
I'm getting to that.

112
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,803
I think he's saying that he's got a little.

113
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:36,869
Iraqi dinars.

114
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,916
How's he getting on in jail?

115
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,020
I'm sure he's fine...

116
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:52,322
He must have written that he misses you.

117
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,322
At the end, he says goodbye.

118
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,927
He doesn't say when he'll be released?

119
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,838
Goodbye.

120
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,204
I don't know.

121
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,443
But when will he be freed?

122
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,853
That's all?

123
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,322
If it's God's will, he will be released.
Don't worry.

124
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,692
Goodbye.

125
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,357
My God!

126
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,310
Young man!

127
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,539
- Are you okay?
- Yes, thank you.

128
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:58,213
Do you know where I can find
the shepherd boys?

129
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,487
Up there. This way or that way.

130
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,589
The goats go up this way?

131
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,293
Listen, I am a teacher.

132
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,636
- What?
- I am a teacher.

133
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,303
So what are you doing here?

134
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,035
- Looking for children.
- Good luck.

135
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,069
- Where are they?
- Up there.

136
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,746
Listen, young man, I'm talking to you.

137
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,341
I've already told you, they're up there.

138
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,579
- Which way should I go?
- The way I told you.

139
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,379
Straight ahead.

140
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,259
Do you know how to write?

141
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,255
Do you know how to write?

142
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:42,822
What?

143
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,090
To read and write?

144
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,226
No.

145
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,095
Would you like to learn?

146
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,833
It's useless.

147
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:50,965
I'm talking to you!

148
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,308
Show me the way.

149
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,808
The way, young man!

150
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,714
Where are you going?

151
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,409
- Young man!
- What?

152
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,508
The way?

153
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,249
Here. There. Also here.

154
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,081
Not this way?

155
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,050
I'm talking to you!

156
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,685
- Young man!
- What?

157
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,389
Show me the way.

158
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,390
I want you to show me the way. Look at me!

159
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,593
Leave me alone.

160
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,540
Anybody here?

161
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,176
Anybody here?

162
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,441
Is there anyone here?

163
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,974
Open the windows. Answer me!

164
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,326
Multiplication tables!

165
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,097
Come and learn how to multiply.

166
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,965
One times two is two.

167
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,566
Two times two is four.

168
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,708
Madam!

169
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,546
Do you need a teacher?

170
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,350
- What?
- I am a teacher.

171
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,619
Where are your children?

172
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,450
Leave me alone.

173
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,653
I have come to teach your children.

174
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,023
- Who are you?
- I am a teacher.

175
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,223
- Good for you.
- I'm looking for pupils.

176
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:29,262
- Where are the children?
- Go away.

177
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,830
Anybody here?

178
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,399
Anybody here?

179
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,065
Is there anyone here?

180
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,971
I can hear voices.

181
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,500
I've come a long way

182
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,703
to teach your children

183
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,008
to read and write.

184
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,778
You won't need to pay me much.

185
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,451
I'll teach you to read and write letters.

186
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,647
Children, at last! Wonderful! Come here.

187
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,946
Stop. Tell me where you've come from.

188
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,847
Where are you going?

189
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,958
Where have you come from?

190
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,190
Where have you come from?

191
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,527
I've come from deep in the valley
to find you.

192
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,935
Let us through, mister.

193
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,096
Just a moment.

194
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,139
I'm not going to eat you.

195
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,605
I only want to talk to you.

196
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,139
- Do you have a school here?
- No.

197
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,082
- And a teacher?
- No.

198
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,883
- Would you like one?
- No.

199
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,822
Where are you going with those burdens?

200
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,285
- We're mules.
- What?

201
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,193
- Then I'll come with you, okay?
- No.

202
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,565
Let us get past, mister.

203
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,692
Let us get past!

204
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,161
Wait a minute, kid!

205
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,740
Allow me to finish and I'll let you go.

206
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:48,006
Just one question:
where are you going with those?

207
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,238
Let us get past!

208
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,380
It's heavy! You can't stay there like that.

209
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,313
Let us get past.

210
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,943
We're wiped out.

211
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,148
- You don't have a teacher?
- No.

212
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,257
There's no teachers here.

213
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,859
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

214
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,359
You don't know?

215
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,258
Let us pass, we're wiped out.

216
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:09,991
Look.

217
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,025
You're holding us all up.

218
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,761
Let us pass.

219
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,707
I'm a teacher

220
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,609
and I've come
to teach you to read and write.

221
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,403
I've come a long way.

222
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,179
I've been looking for you for a long time!

223
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,453
I want to teach you to read and write,

224
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,950
to add up and multiply.

225
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,862
I don't want a lot of money.

226
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,998
If you don't have any,

227
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,034
you could just give me something to eat.

228
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,735
We carry contraband, stolen goods.

229
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,136
We take it

230
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,974
over the border

231
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,742
between Iran and Iraq.

232
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,574
We're always on the run.

233
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,717
Listen, my child.

234
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,416
With education,

235
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,828
you will be able to read a book

236
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,026
or, even better, a newspaper

237
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,000
when you're traveling.

238
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,069
Learn to read and write!

239
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,106
You'll know what's going on in the world.

240
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,433
You can learn to add up,

241
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,704
to subtract, to do your accounts
without being swindled.

242
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,107
What good is it, all that?

243
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:11,587
You can study or find work.

244
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,653
Doing the accounts,

245
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,793
that's great for the Boss.

246
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,455
Us, we're mules.

247
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,056
Always on the move.

248
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,031
How do you expect us to read?

249
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,201
To read a book,

250
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,136
you have to sit down.

251
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,644
Us, we never stop moving.

252
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,518
Listen, I want to talk to you.

253
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,203
Stop! Wait!

254
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,863
Wait!

255
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,209
Hello!

256
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,450
Do you know how to read and write?

257
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,846
- Do you?
- No.

258
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,516
- Do you want to learn?
- No.

259
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,483
- You don't?
- No.

260
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,421
Hello.

261
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,530
Do you know how to read and write?

262
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,059
- Do you?
- No.

263
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,639
Hello, sir!

264
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,544
- I'm talking to you.
- What?

265
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,739
You wouldn't have a scrap of bread?

266
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,748
It's freezing!

267
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,282
Where are you going?

268
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,947
I don't have a job, can I come with you?

269
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,683
We don't need you.

270
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,027
Hello. How's it going?

271
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,961
It's freezing!

272
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,173
Hello, sir.

273
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,104
Sir!

274
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,142
I'm talking to you.

275
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,780
Why won't you answer me?

276
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,419
Haven't you got any work for me?

277
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,884
No.

278
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,885
I'll do anything.

279
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,826
We don't have any work ourselves.

280
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:39,702
I could herd goats, sweep up.
Just give me something to eat.

281
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:44,730
We haven't got anything to eat either.

282
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,369
How do you survive?

283
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:48,672
We're nomads.

284
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,071
I'm hungry-

285
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,912
Give me a piece of bread.

286
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:01,519
Where are you going? Can I come with you?

287
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:05,428
We have strayed. We're old.

288
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,191
We are lost,
we don't know how to get back to Iraq.

289
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,564
Can you show us the way,
just as far as the border?

290
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,502
Fine, let's go.

291
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:23,211
I can show you, but it won't be easy.

292
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:27,276
Halaleh!
Bring your father something to drink.

293
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,683
Bring some water!

294
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,821
What do I get if I take you?

295
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,019
We have nothing to give you!

296
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:41,453
I have to guide you for nothing?

297
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,024
We have nothing to give you.

298
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,964
You must have something!

299
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,764
There is nothing.

300
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,268
Not even a piece of bread?

301
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,035
Not even bread.

302
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,140
It's a hard road.
You must give me something.

303
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,441
We don't have anything.

304
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,242
How can I lead you with no reward?

305
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,114
We have nothing.

306
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,342
Not even a scrap?

307
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,715
I can give you forty walnuts.

308
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,620
Only forty?

309
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,817
Forty isn't enough!

310
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,758
Give me fifty.

311
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,369
- The route is hard.
- You won't get more than forty.

312
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,162
It's a long hard road.

313
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,007
I accept.

314
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:31,275
- What's wrong with him?
- He's sick.

315
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,712
Give him some water!

316
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,253
Drink, drink.

317
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:40,252
Drink, drink. You won't drink?

318
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,854
Drink!

319
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,035
Dear lady,

320
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,631
give me a little water, too.
Madam, I'm thirsty.

321
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,144
I'm parched!

322
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,874
Give me something to drink.

323
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,011
I'm thirsty.

324
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,449
- Where are you going?
- I'm going on.

325
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,627
For five nuts, will you carry
the sick boy on your blackboard?

326
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,185
Five nuts?

327
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,942
God help us!

328
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:04,034
What's wrong with the old man?

329
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,736
He can't piss.

330
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,172
He's sick.

331
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:12,640
Sick?

332
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,615
Where are you taking him?

333
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:16,982
To the border.

334
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,610
To the border?

335
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,020
Who is that woman?

336
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,355
That's the old man's daughter.

337
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,989
He wants to marry her off.

338
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,096
Once it's done,

339
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:36,696
he'll go to his grave in peace.

340
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:40,302
- How much does he want for her dowry?
- Nothing.

341
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,739
What do you mean, nothing? She's poor?

342
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,014
If you want her hand,

343
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,017
give him a walnut tree.

344
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:55,023
I don't have one. I'm a teacher.
I only have this blackboard.

345
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,757
- Only this blackboard?
- Yes.

346
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,198
I must ask her father if he will allow it...

347
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:10,096
Sure you won't regret it?

348
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:13,072
No, I won't regret it. Get him down there.

349
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,348
What about me?

350
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:32,154
Let's go and ask for her hand right away.

351
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,596
Force yourself, my brother. Piss.

352
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:47,042
Hurry up. Don't be afraid.

353
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,422
Don't look at her!
You haven't been introduced.

354
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:06,723
Said!

355
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:11,328
You wish to marry Halaleh?

356
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:12,459
Yes.

357
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,330
- You agree?
- Yes.

358
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,640
Close your eyes and promise.

359
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,004
- I promise.
- You promise?

360
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,542
- Yes.
- You will shield her from hunger?

361
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:24,841
Yes.

362
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,376
Come on.

363
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,149
Come on... piss.

364
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,556
Halaleh!

365
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,825
- What?
- You wish to marry Said?

366
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,797
Are you sure?

367
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,267
Yes.

368
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,070
- You will shield her from hunger?
- Yes.

369
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:59,047
- And from thirst?
- I will shield her from hunger.

370
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:02,313
- You swear not to abandon her?
- I promise.

371
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,648
Halaleh?

372
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,314
Yes?

373
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:11,788
Do you accept Said as your husband
with this blackboard for a dowry?

374
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,854
Are you agreed?

375
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,192
You wish to marry him?

376
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,393
With the blackboard?

377
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:19,867
The blackboard? Yes.

378
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,331
Yes.

379
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:25,905
You are truly agreed?

380
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:38,110
Said, do you take her as your wife?

381
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,086
Halaleh!

382
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,520
And you, do you take him?

383
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,160
Yes.

384
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:58,303
You are now husband and wife.

385
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,852
Let's rest here.

386
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,923
You want to stop here?

387
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,333
You want to be stuck here forever?

388
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,631
Won't you get sick of it?

389
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,876
What's your name?

390
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,109
Have you got toothache?

391
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,945
Open your mouth.

392
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,977
Open your mouth.

393
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,722
Which tooth is it?

394
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:00,528
Do you know how to read and write?

395
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:04,059
Do you want to learn?

396
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,560
As you wish.

397
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,468
What's your name?

398
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,113
- Your name?
- Hayyaz.

399
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,243
Hayyaz?

400
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,451
You do this journey all the time?

401
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,419
Aren't you tired?

402
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,119
- You know how to read and write?
- No.

403
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:33,217
- You don't want to?
- No.

404
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,922
Do you know what it would allow you to do?

405
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,464
To read a book

406
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:43,939
or a newspaper,
to work, to listen, to speak...

407
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:47,599
When you can read a book,

408
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,243
you discover stories...

409
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,013
Stories? I've got a hundred.

410
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,208
It was spring.

411
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,981
I climbed to the peak with four friends,

412
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,783
to the top of the mountain.

413
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,085
The goats were grazing peacefully.

414
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,057
We chased a rabbit.

415
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:09,921
It ran out of breath. We caught it.

416
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,758
My friend tortured it.

417
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:17,703
He wanted to cut its head off.

418
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,867
I told him it was a sin.

419
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,546
But he continued to torment it,

420
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,742
he still wanted to cut its head off.

421
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,578
He tortured it

422
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,984
and tried to cut its head off.

423
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:36,486
I said that it was a sin.

424
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,354
I told him to stop

425
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:41,393
and I grabbed his hand, to try to stop him.

426
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,263
He insulted me

427
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,993
and cut the rabbit's head off.

428
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,596
They washed it and split it up

429
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:57,212
without giving me my share.

430
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,376
That upset me.

431
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,352
I went off and cried.

432
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:11,290
I led my goats away

433
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,451
and then we fought.

434
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,695
Then, as it was late,

435
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:19,564
we went our separate ways

436
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,861
to our homes.

437
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,904
Drop it! I don't need your stories.

438
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,966
I want to teach you.

439
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,913
Sir, Your Honor, please come here a minute.

440
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,790
<i>- What's your name'?
- Reebok.</i>

441
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,189
<i>Reebok'? Me, mo.</i>

442
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,631
No kidding?

443
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,361
Do you know what that says, Reeboir?

444
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,666
No idea.

445
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,941
That says "he who walks." The traveler.

446
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,443
- Do you know how to read and write?
- No.

447
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:08,040
- Do you want me to teach you?
- Yes!

448
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,450
- You really do?
- Yes.

449
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,547
- Shall we begin?
- Okay.

450
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,484
Take it, eat.

451
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:21,195
- No, thank you.
- Please, eat.

452
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,662
Thank you.

453
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,763
- What do you do?
- I'm a teacher.

454
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,241
You're joking? You're a teacher?

455
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:38,341
Can you teach me to write my name?

456
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:43,075
- Do you want to learn?
- Yes. Really.

457
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,271
Hello.

458
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,286
Where are you going with the kid?

459
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,246
Go and play.

460
00:36:58,683 --> 00:36:59,923
Are you okay?

461
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,071
Go and play!

462
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,942
Don't cry, your mother's coming.

463
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:29,290
Come and play with the nuts.

464
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,921
Stay here, little one. Mommy's coming.

465
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,954
Sit down and play.

466
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:05,393
Don't move. Come on. Sit down.

467
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,725
Put the walnut on your hand.

468
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,032
That's right... like that.

469
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,685
That's it... just like that.

470
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,952
Lift your hand.

471
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,095
Flick it!

472
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,722
"I love you." Now, let's spell it.

473
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,388
Lift your hand, like that. Watch me.

474
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,222
"Love... you."

475
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:19,858
Look at me...

476
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,473
"I love you."

477
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,734
You won't answer?

478
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,934
Fine, I'll give you a zero

479
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,510
because you wouldn't answer me.

480
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,884
You cheated. You stretched out your arm.

481
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,348
You cheated!

482
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,591
We'll have a return game!

483
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,623
As you refuse to answer me,

484
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,793
I'll give you zero.

485
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:11,810
But because you're a good girl,
I'll give you eighteen.

486
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,847
"Eighteen."

487
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:19,446
Come.

488
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,894
Why do you refuse to learn?

489
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,122
I'm the best teacher around.

490
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:31,163
All my pupils get... twenty

491
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,261
out of twenty!

492
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:42,035
You deserve zero, but you're a good girl.
I'll give you eighteen.

493
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:54,723
I want to pee.

494
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:57,757
Help me, God...

495
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,124
Help me, God...

496
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,759
Spare me, God...

497
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,656
Help me, God...

498
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,908
Spare me, God...

499
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,691
Come here and try and relieve yourself.

500
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:43,628
If you don't squeeze it out, you'll die.

501
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:10,655
You've been suffering for three days now.

502
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,002
Hurry UP-

503
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,135
Piss... Piss... Piss.

504
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,242
Hurry up...

505
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:08,550
Relieve yourself. Quick.

506
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,157
If you don't, you're as good as dead.

507
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:15,992
Hurry UP-

508
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,758
Let's help him!

509
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,996
Couldn't manage it?

510
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:25,967
I love you

511
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:35,546
You, Blackboard! Move...

512
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:15,090
- You still couldn't piss?
- No.

513
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:21,686
God help me!

514
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,329
- You didn't piss?
- No.

515
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:35,076
I swear to you,
Satan himself could piss in that water.

516
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:37,772
I have pissed in that water,

517
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,312
but not him.

518
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:44,884
He must have committed
some terrible sin and now he can't piss!

519
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:46,747
You didn't piss?

520
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:56,854
No.

521
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,736
My God, have mercy on me!

522
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,076
Have mercy on me.

523
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,611
You didn't piss?

524
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,805
No.

525
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,082
That's it. Yes, R.

526
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:24,984
Well done.

527
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,435
B like Bread.

528
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:46,537
B like Bread...

529
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:49,008
O like Oil...

530
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,453
See how easy it is: Reeboir...

531
00:46:58,348 --> 00:46:59,759
Run, quick.

532
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,988
Run!

533
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,329
Quick!

534
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,453
Repeat: R like Reeboir.

535
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,351
Reeboir.

536
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,261
He's fallen down!

537
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:42,558
Shakak!

538
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:47,501
- Who's fallen?
- Hayyaz.

539
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:33,011
Don't cry, Hayyaz.
Tell the story of the rabbit.

540
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:39,684
It was spring. Me and four friends

541
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:43,081
we climbed up high,
to the top of the mountain.

542
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:46,558
The sheep were feeding happily.

543
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:50,293
We saw a rabbit and we caught it.

544
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:55,326
- You can read and write, boy?
- Yes.

545
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,763
- You can?
- Yes.

546
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:00,442
But you told me you couldn't!

547
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,477
I don't trust strangers.

548
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,235
Why?

549
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,406
My mother warned me not to.

550
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:09,412
Your friends can read?

551
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,384
Most of them, yes.

552
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:15,813
But their mothers told them
never to trust strangers.

553
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:24,429
Children. Listen to me a minute.

554
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:25,862
Sit down.

555
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:28,127
Don't waste what time you have.

556
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,228
Let me teach you.

557
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:35,343
Look at my blackboard!

558
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:41,545
I want to teach you to read and write.

559
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:45,513
Watch me! Listen to me!

560
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,717
Don't listen to him.

561
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:52,452
Let's get out of here!

562
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,930
Children! Where are you going?

563
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:02,492
Let's go! Carry him.

564
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:05,333
Stop!

565
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:08,367
Listen to me!

566
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,167
Don't go!

567
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,610
It's your fault, all this!

568
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:13,276
Children!

569
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:41,976
- Repeat.
- Did I say it right?

570
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:43,473
Well done.

571
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:49,406
Very good.

572
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:52,648
Stretch out the R...

573
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,586
R like Reeboir.

574
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,524
Listen, friend.

575
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,732
The other story wasn't true.

576
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:07,667
What happened: we chased the rabbit,

577
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:09,235
we caught it

578
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:11,404
and we ate it.

579
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:14,440
It was tasty!

580
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:17,242
Delicious!

581
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:34,745
A like Apple...

582
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:38,592
Be quiet. They're behind us.

583
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:42,661
Reeboir and his group, this way.

584
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,965
Group Two, take the other path.

585
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:51,667
The rest of you, follow me.

586
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:53,975
Be careful. It's dangerous.

587
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:12,326
Not this way!
There are land mines everywhere!

588
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,629
Take the other path.

589
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:18,021
Look out!

590
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:22,531
Don't get yourselves killed.

591
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:29,709
Go round the other side!

592
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,109
Two times two?

593
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:09,609
Four.

594
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,712
Reply!

595
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:15,049
Reply swiftly, learn swiftly.

596
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,216
Two times three?

597
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,385
Six.

598
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,521
Four times two?

599
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,132
Come on, answer!

600
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,530
Two times five?

601
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,968
Come on: ten!

602
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:39,775
To learn quickly, you must answer quickly.

603
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:44,708
One times two?

604
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:46,712
Two.

605
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:50,153
Two times two? Four.

606
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,923
One times two? Two.

607
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,132
Mother, a rabbit!

608
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,552
Chuan!

609
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:28,190
What are you doing? The Devil take you!

610
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,860
Halaleh!

611
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:36,835
Where is she gone?

612
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,751
The Devil take you!

613
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:02,858
Halaleh!

614
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:04,955
Where are you?

615
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,703
Please, sir, have you seen my wife?

616
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:41,631
Where are you going?

617
00:57:42,325 --> 00:57:43,702
Stop...

618
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:58,180
You want some walnuts?

619
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,089
One times two is two!

620
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:14,566
Why are you running away?

621
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:14,728
Why are you running away?

622
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,765
Have I done something wrong?

623
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:22,606
If math is too difficult,

624
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,576
I'll teach you to read.

625
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:26,680
Repeat after me...

626
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:32,182
"I love you."

627
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:35,513
See, it's easy.

628
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,457
Say it!

629
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:41,258
Come on, say it!

630
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:44,295
Say, "I love you."

631
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:47,699
Look at me.

632
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:56,475
What sort of student are you?

633
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,341
I'll give you eight.

634
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:02,878
No, not eight.

635
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:05,177
That would fail you.

636
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,882
I'll give you ten,

637
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:09,889
so you pass.

638
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:15,923
Say it!

639
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,958
Say, "I love you."

640
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,295
You don't want to?

641
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:24,365
What sort of student are you?

642
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:27,566
I'm giving you zero.

643
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,438
At least say that you don't love me.

644
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:39,353
What's wrong?

645
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,447
You won't say that either?

646
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:47,786
Here comes another zero.

647
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:49,494
Happy now?

648
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,363
Now a zero for your son.

649
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:57,163
Here's a zero for your son.

650
00:59:58,861 --> 00:59:59,965
What?

651
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:05,336
You still won't answer?
I'll give you a zero for your father.

652
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:08,674
Here.

653
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,617
Still got nothing to say?

654
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,087
I'll give myself a zero.

655
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,529
For having been stupid enough
to follow you.

656
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,764
What kind of a life is this?

657
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:28,894
Goodbye.

658
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,442
How could I have loved you?

659
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,945
You're not listening to me!

660
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:46,551
Blackboard!

661
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:49,551
Stop!

662
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,590
Blackboard!

663
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:56,388
Stop.

664
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,338
Listen!

665
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:27,951
My heart is like a train.

666
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:31,294
At every station, someone gets on or off.

667
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:35,530
But there is someone who never gets off.

668
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,802
My son.

669
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,411
Halaleh...

670
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:48,749
What's happening?

671
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:10,296
Escape! Hurry up!

672
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:13,232
What's going on?

673
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:26,347
The soldiers at the border have opened fire!

674
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:59,706
A like Apple.

675
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:03,374
Break the syllables up.

676
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:28,075
Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry.

677
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:32,376
We're in danger. I'll come back later.

678
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:23,585
Halt!

679
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:26,820
Who goes there?

680
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:00,953
What's your name?

681
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:05,224
- You don't want to tell me?
- Ghazal.

682
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:09,265
Do you know how to read and write?

683
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:12,629
- Do you?
- No.

684
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,238
- Where is your village?
- Down there.

685
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:19,139
- That's Dezle?
- Yes.

686
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:22,582
- Is there a school?
- No.

687
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,149
- Do you want a teacher?
- No.

688
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:59,920
- Will we have to wait long?
- Who knows.

689
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:01,579
Where are your friends?

690
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:03,885
We're meeting up by the river.

691
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,856
No, it was near the goats.

692
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:09,619
- They're not coming.
- They've been caught.

693
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:22,271
Thanks for the milk. Excellent.

694
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,634
Sir, I've written something.

695
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:58,476
- I wrote something.
- What?

696
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:01,037
- I wrote my name.
- Well done.

697
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:03,183
I wrote "Reeboir."

698
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:07,313
Run for your life!

699
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:36,515
Take him.

700
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:37,845
Come.

701
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:39,416
Quick.

702
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,487
It's just like at Halebtcheh...

703
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:53,399
I built a wall to protect us

704
01:09:54,056 --> 01:09:56,730
from chemical weapons.

705
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:03,503
Father!

706
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,549
Chemical weapons...

707
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:18,719
Father!

708
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:35,665
Look after him.

709
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:52,387
Chemical weapons...

710
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,552
What's happened?

711
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,791
I pissed.

712
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:03,060
Hide under the blackboard.

713
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:09,838
My daughter!

714
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:23,113
Your brother is dead. Let's go.

715
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:27,287
He isn't dead.
He wanted to die in his homeland.

716
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:29,995
Come on. He is dead.

717
01:11:58,614 --> 01:12:01,322
Just like at Halebtcheh.

718
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:12,371
It's not chemical weapons. It's rifle fire.

719
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:15,033
Don't worry.

720
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:19,574
It's the soldiers from over the border

721
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:21,879
who were firing.

722
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:27,951
It's not chemical weapons.

723
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,553
Don't be afraid, my darling.

724
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:31,090
The women...

725
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,750
The children...

726
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:42,868
We're not going to die.

727
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,264
It's not chemical weapons.

728
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:49,141
It's the soldiers, over the border.

729
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:52,371
If they hear us, they'll fire.

730
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:55,972
I swear, it's not chemical weapons.

731
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:00,352
The women...

732
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:02,252
The men...

733
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:31,748
Hide under the blackboard.

734
01:13:32,007 --> 01:13:34,044
I'll protect you.

735
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:25,863
Stop!

736
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,644
There. The border.

737
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:35,847
The land of your fathers,

738
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:37,577
of your ancestors.

739
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,883
Your homeland!

740
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:42,046
You're lying!

741
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:44,249
I swear I'm not.

742
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:46,715
It's the truth. Take a good look.

743
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:51,094
Don't you recognize Halebtcheh?

744
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:53,629
No. It's not the border.

745
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:56,328
He's tricked us, I know it.

746
01:14:56,492 --> 01:15:00,372
He's lying. It's not the border.

747
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:05,169
We are lost.

748
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:08,281
I know our border very well. This isn't it.

749
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:10,177
I'm not lying.

750
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:13,147
I swear to you this is it.

751
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:15,552
This is your homeland.

752
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:19,886
This isn't the border! We are lost!

753
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,492
Can't you understand?

754
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:32,637
- Don't you believe me?
- You're lying.

755
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:35,002
You've tricked us, Blackboard!

756
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:36,733
I swear to you, I'm not lying.

757
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:39,472
It's been like this since the bombing.

758
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:42,142
It's not true!

759
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:48,048
I swear to you, this is the border.

760
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:54,093
You're looking at Halebtcheh.

761
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:58,790
It's because of the bombing...

762
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:24,512
God be praised!

763
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,120
We are grateful to you. Here are the nuts.

764
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:29,051
What will you do now?

765
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:31,888
Will you cross the border with us?

766
01:17:31,947 --> 01:17:33,449
No, I can't.

767
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:37,794
But your wife wants to cross over.
She won't stay with you.

768
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:39,662
What's your decision?

769
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:42,736
If she doesn't want me, what can I do?

770
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,900
I don't know. You must decide.

771
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,334
A divorce?

772
01:17:47,396 --> 01:17:49,706
Yes, if that's what she wants.

773
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:51,705
Let's find out.

774
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:56,478
Are you coming with us, Blackboard?

775
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:59,216
I can't. I belong here, in this land.

776
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:03,645
Your wife wants to return to her
own country. She doesn't want you.

777
01:18:03,745 --> 01:18:05,622
Did she tell you that?

778
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,729
There's nothing I can do. I'll divorce her.

779
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,359
- You will divorce her?
- Yes.

780
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:16,964
Go and find her.

781
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,909
Put it down here.

782
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:31,651
Do you agree to a divorce?

783
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:33,709
And that you will take the blackboard?

784
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:39,990
The blackboard? Yes.

785
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:43,325
You may look at each other

786
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:44,887
one last time.

787
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:46,689
Lift your hand.

788
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:49,935
Take that stick.

789
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:52,337
Halaleh,

790
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:57,675
you are now divorced,

791
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,906
and the blackboard is yours.

792
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,713
May God keep you from hunger!

793
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:06,309
May God keep you from thirst!

794
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:08,785
May God keep you from solitude!

795
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:14,423
Take your blackboard.

796
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:18,463
And give me my stick.

797
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:20,330
Goodbye.

798
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:30,674
I love you

799
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:39,719
Chuan! What are you doing?

800
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:41,681
Hurry up. Come on.

801
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:44,413
Come, quickly.
