2
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:32,490
Granny, I will prevail with money.

3
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,690
I will.

4
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,630
She's traumatized by Granny's death.

5
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,130
How else can you explain this strange

6
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,760
behavior? She's been eating non-stop!

7
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,430
I can't even count how
many bowls she has had.

8
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,430
There're five travelers inns in the
market district that sell soup and rice,

9
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,560
but some places do well
and some don't.

10
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,860
Why do you think that is?

11
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,930
Why, because the food is different.

12
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,460
And the place across the street
had good food but bad service...

13
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,790
Have you been dragging us around trying

14
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,130
different restaurants to go into food business?

15
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,630
With you two doing the cooking,
people will be fighting for a table.

16
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,890
Doesn't the thought of starting a business

17
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,590
scare you after what happened?

18
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,130
I am scared.

19
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,930
I'm scare of money and of people.

20
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,990
But what scares me even
more is giving up here like this.

21
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,330
Why this place? This is the
worst place we've tried.

22
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
You can't get to the government office

23
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,130
from the harbor without passing this place.

24
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,460
There is no better location.

25
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,790
I guess your heart isn't in this business.

26
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,060
If you don't want the food,
you can just leave.

27
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:03,260
This is my analysis of this place I gathered
eating here for the past month.

28
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,660
And?

29
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,130
I heard Mu Meng Dal is after this place.

30
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:16,360
What? Who are you? Why are you
poking around about my business?

31
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,330
If this is how you're going to run
your business,

32
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,760
you might as well hand it over
to Mu now.

33
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,060
You're going to go out of business
before he takes it from you.

34
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,560
What?

35
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,030
Calm down. Calm down!

36
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,190
I know you took a loan
out on this place, too.

37
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,360
What the...!

38
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,590
No, no!

39
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:39,790
Let me run this place for you.
I'll give you 70% of the profit.

40
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,160
70%?

41
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,130
All you have to do is sit back and watch.

42
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,590
I get a place to sell my product, and you get a
superior product that will bring more business.

43
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,490
It'll be beneficial for both of us.

44
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,130
You think it's easy to run a business?
Don't insult me because I sell soup for a living!

45
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,360
This is the soup we would sell.

46
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,830
Give us a try for a month then decide.

47
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,460
What do we do now that we

48
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,090
have a place to do business?

49
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,890
Our first priority is shedding
the old image.

50
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,530
Yeah.

51
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,890
I think we should separate ourselves from
the other inns by food and other things, too.

52
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,690
Merchants usually travel in groups,

53
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:47,060
so why don't we make ourselves known
as the place that offer group benefits?

54
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:53,630
If we only charge for lodging for large groups
and offer food for free, rumor will spread fast.

55
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:00,260
Ladies, what special menu can we
offer using ingredients unique to Jeju?

56
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,560
How about pork and seaweed soup?

57
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,160
You put seaweed in flavorful pork broth

58
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,930
and thicken it with buckwheat powder.

59
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,960
Why, it'll be like a party every day!

60
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,990
We can serve it with tea

61
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,930
made from tangerine rind.

62
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:28,230
Tangerines help relieve motion
sickness, so it'll be perfect for travelers.

63
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,930
Let's start experimenting with
pork and seaweed soup recipes.

64
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,590
We have to distinguish ourselves from
the competitors in our food and service.

65
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,260
Jeju Marketplace

66
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,660
The seaweed is not very good today.

67
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,390
I'll give you a discount.

68
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,560
I can fool the customers but

69
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,790
I can't fool my conscience.

70
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,460
We don't mind paying a little more,

71
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,460
so let us be the first to know when

72
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,430
you get in good quality goods.

73
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,030
Sure.

74
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,690
Get in line please.

75
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,860
Here's your pork and seaweed
soup with tangerine tea!

76
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,490
May I ask where you're traveling from?

77
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,360
I'm from Mokpo, Cheolla.

78
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,630
What are you selling?

79
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,860
I came to sell cotton, but Honam is
enjoying a bumper cotton crop due to

80
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,490
the good rain they had.
It drove the price way down, too.

81
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,560
I take it you didn't do too well there.

82
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,530
If I don't make some money here,

83
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:06,360
I don't know how I'm going to give
my father his 60th birthday party.

84
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,660
Leave a few bolts here with us. We will pay
you enough for the birthday celebration.

85
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,590
Pardon?

86
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:20,130
We don't charge you for accommodation
here if you give us valuable information.

87
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:25,130
It's for the interesting story you just
told me, so consider it an even trade.

88
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:36,090
An outbreak of bandits in Gangwondo
is causing the crop prices to soar.

89
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:42,130
Lack of snow is affecting
apples crops in Gyeongsangdo.

90
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:09,330
This month's payment plus interest.
Exactly thirty nyangs.

91
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,330
You're more capable than
most men including me.

92
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,290
I'm sorry, but we're full.
Let me take you to the next inn.

93
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,490
Guys!

94
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,630
Hi!

95
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,090
Good to see you.

96
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:27,030
I was just taking these men to
the next inn because we're full.

97
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,930
This way.

98
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,590
- You're here!
- Yes, I'm so proud of you!

99
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:40,260
But are you sending all those
customers to another inn?

100
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,360
If you think about it, it's good for
us, too, to have thriving neighbors.

101
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,690
Chok Sae!

102
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,430
Bravo. You are the best, Man Deok!
Learn from her, will you?

103
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,930
How... did you make all this money?

104
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,130
You are amazing!

105
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,290
You made me more in
the last few months than

106
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,760
I saved the entire time I've been
in business.

107
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,660
I'm glad I can keep my promise.

108
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,890
From now on, I'll stay out of
the management completely.

109
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,860
I'm leaving it in your hands to build it up.

110
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,460
You and I are both businesswomen.

111
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,660
I thought about this for days
before I made the decision.

112
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,390
Thank you for trusting me.

113
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,890
You can be certain I will return the favor.

114
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,790
Six Years Later

115
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,090
Stop that man!

116
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,360
Deok Pal, stop him!

117
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,090
Hey!
You think you can eat and run?

118
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,090
Husband, don't waste your time.
Just strip him!

119
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:21,090
Strip him? You like stripping too much.
Come here, you little weasel!

120
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,890
Despicable bastard!

121
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,760
What's going on here?

122
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,460
Doctor!

123
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,030
Man Deok, I have to talk to you.

124
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,490
What did you want to discuss?

125
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,690
I wondered if you could help me

126
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,330
find some Joritdae wild bamboo.

127
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:50,130
Aren't those found at the foot of Mt. Halla?

128
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:59,190
It's for the King and I need them quick,
but I can't find any high grade goods.

129
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,490
For the King?

130
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,960
Yeah.
I'm told his chest pain has gotten worse.

131
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,960
So if you hear anything,
let me know right away.

132
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,490
Well then.
See you later.

133
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:35,530
Joritdae... is used to treat cancer.

134
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,190
He couldn't be...

135
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,260
What was the doctor doing here?

136
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,490
If....

137
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,830
Suppose the King was dying.

138
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,290
What would be
the first sign one might see?

139
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,560
You can't say things like that!

140
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,260
You could be arrested for high treason.

141
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:07,990
If the King died, Jeju would send specialty
products to the palace for the royal funeral.

142
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,490
What would that be?

143
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,430
Stop it, Man Deok.

144
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,330
No, we have to find out.

145
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,560
Dong Ah, go to Slim at the gisaeng house and
borrow the books in the government library.

146
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,230
Here you go.

147
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,690
Enjoy!

148
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,060
Delicious, delicious.

149
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,930
We're just raking in the money!

150
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,830
If only I had made a better
choice six years ago...

151
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,090
You could not have made
better choice, Husband.

152
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,990
Absolutely, Wife.

153
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,430
White hat: Worn during mourning.

154
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:27,290
"White hats are required
to be worn for six months."

155
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,730
Dong Ah!

156
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,060
Excuse me, sir. Has anyone placed a large
order of white hats in the last few days?

157
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,230
Someone from Hanyang or out of state.

158
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,360
Why would anyone order white
hats when no one has died?

159
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,630
How much money do we have to spare?

160
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:14,730
We charge less than our competitors,
and after paying rent, food cost and labor,

161
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,130
we don't end up with much.

162
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,660
Mangan and Yoo Bong, please go to the
government office first thing in the morning

163
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,960
and find out if any horses have
been sent up to Hanyang lately.

164
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,560
Yes, ma'am.

165
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,030
Dong Ah, go to Hanyang and
look into what I asked you earlier.

166
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,990
And don't forget to bring back
a white hat on your way back.

167
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:53,460
Hanyang Marketplace

168
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,890
That despicable fool!

169
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,330
That's all right.

170
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,860
We will just get a new
tenant if he cannot pay rent.

171
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,730
Don't make a fuss.

172
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,830
Have you heard anything?

173
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,390
About what?

174
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,030
About Man Deok.

175
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,390
Do you still think about that wench?

176
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,660
She's probably somewhere living
a worthless life.

177
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,230
I never want to see her face again.

178
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,260
Call Merchant Baek from the fish market.

179
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,190
You look worried.

180
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:39,290
I fear His Highness is nearing death.

181
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:46,290
Is that why you requisitioned horses from
Jeju? To prepare for a possible unrest?

182
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,790
Royal Grandson's ascension is definite.

183
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:58,460
Being of Noron Faction, I fear our family
might become a target of political revenge.

184
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,990
I heard that Royal Grandson is not one
to allow a political war over the past.

185
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,060
I've got nothing else to lose now that I'm
handing over my store, so I'll speak my mind.

186
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,590
You know that it's the Songpa bastards that
ruined my business by dumping their product.

187
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,730
My man, what's the use
of bringing that up now?

188
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,530
I heard a disturbing rumor.

189
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,460
Disturbing rumor?

190
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,560
That it's none other than you,
Madam Oh, that

191
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,630
allowed the Songpa merchants
to run rampant.

192
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,790
Do you have any proof of this?

193
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,830
Leave at once!

194
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,830
You should be grateful that we're paying
you for a business that's practically worthless!

195
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,590
Done. Now we can close up
the fish market in Songpa.

196
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:27,060
I've heard that fish markets
are cropping up in Newon.

197
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,630
There is a marketplace in Newon?

198
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,090
Merchants are setting up shop
everywhere goods can be delivered.

199
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:40,090
So it's not easy to knock down
a business like it used to be.

200
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,690
Then something has to be done
about this.

201
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,290
Jeong Dong's Estate, Hanyang

202
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,130
I've heard that a new marketplace

203
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,290
is forming in Newon. What happened?

204
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:03,830
I'm fighting against it, but it's
Choi Jebum that's the problem.

205
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:14,130
He insists protecting the licensed shops is not
the answer to all and refutes everything I say.

206
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,330
I need you to stop it.

207
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:20,030
You know the great loss we are suffering
because of these private merchants.

208
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,560
That does not sound like a request.

209
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,030
Forgive me, Minister.

210
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,490
I will take care of it myself.

211
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,160
Please just hold back the Commerce
Control Bureau while I'm doing it.

212
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,930
Is there any trouble in the royal court?

213
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,890
No, what trouble can there be?

214
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,930
Are you all right?

215
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,430
Yes.

216
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,090
This child does not take after you.

217
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,130
What do you mean?

218
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,090
He is sickly and fragile.

219
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:14,030
The doctor said he would grow
out of this and not to worry.

220
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,530
I, too, gave him everything
he could ever need...

221
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,360
Neither of us seem to have
raised our sons to our wish.

222
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:43,230
Kim Eung Ryeol's home, Hanyang

223
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,430
It's already been six years.

224
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,090
How are things in Jeju?

225
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:10,030
Business is thriving, so we've paid off
much of the debt and all is well, sir.

226
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,860
Man Deok is also healthy and well.

227
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:24,890
Time heals all wounds.
I'm sure she will be just fine.

228
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:31,230
You must be tired. Go get some rest.

229
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,660
Thank you, sir.

230
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,890
Sir,

231
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,630
by chance is the King unwell?

232
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,530
How do you know about
the King's health conditions?

233
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,860
Horses were hurriedly requisitioned from
Jeju, and things are rather unsettled.

234
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,660
We figured something is
happening in the palace.

235
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,130
Is this why you came to Hanyang?

236
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:20,090
Yes. Man Deok wanted me to
confirm our suspicion with you.

237
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,160
Confirm? For what reason?

238
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,360
I'm not certain, but I think she
wants to go into a new business.

239
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,590
I'm sure I don't need to say this,

240
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,760
but you must not mention the
King's condition to anyone.

241
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,190
The situation is very precarious
in the royal court right now.

242
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,290
I understand, sir.

243
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,090
I'd like to buy a white hat.

244
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,090
Huh? A white hat?

245
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,260
You must've lost a loved one.

246
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,260
That'll be twenty nyangs.

247
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,290
Here you go.

248
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,830
The market seems rather empty today.

249
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,660
It's like this every day.

250
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,160
Business is so bad
I can barely make the rent.

251
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,860
Do you need anything else?

252
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,190
No.

253
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,830
Did you find out?

254
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,530
Yes. One bundle of bamboo

255
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,890
is plenty to make one hat.

256
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,590
But weaving the brim is very difficult,

257
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,530
so labor cost is quite high.

258
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,860
They sell the hat part for 5 nyangs each,

259
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,690
and the brim part varies depending
on the material.

260
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,290
So I figure with material and labor, it'll cost

261
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,590
about 20 nyangs to produce a white hat.

262
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,690
Twenty nyangs...

263
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,430
Twenty nyangs each,
so one thousand hats would...

264
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,260
Twenty thousand nyangs.

265
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,930
Yes.
It's a considerable amount...

266
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,460
Why are we researching
white hats anyway?

267
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,790
I heard that business was dead at
other inns because of this place.

268
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,260
It must be true.

269
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,560
I'll take a bowl of soup and rice here!

270
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,830
Yes, sir!

271
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:08,890
Who do you think you are
coming in here demanding food?

272
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,330
Get out of here this instant!

273
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,230
Is this how you treat
all of your customers?

274
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,360
Customer? What customer?

275
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,290
That table is reserved.

276
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:27,230
Reserved? In this hole in the wall?

277
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,760
That table is reserved as well.

278
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,890
If you want to taste our food,
you have to wait for a table.

279
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,590
What would you like to do?
Would you like to wait?

280
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,630
You're that busy, huh?

281
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:56,790
Well, past is past, so call
me if you ever need a loan.

282
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:02,460
I'll take this business as collateral
any time.

283
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,660
Good. We don't need that man's business.

284
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,290
Dong Ah.

285
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,190
You were right.

286
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,190
Did you confirm it?
And how about the white hat?

287
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,930
Ask me one question at a time.

288
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:27,990
Here.

289
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,390
How about the hat shops in Hanyang?
Did they seem busy?

290
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:39,290
No, not at all. The whole city
seemed to be in the dark about it.

291
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,060
Good.

292
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,630
No one knows about it.
We're ahead of everyone!

293
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:48,130
So what's your plan?

294
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,430
A business?

295
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,460
When you say business...

296
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,860
What other kind of business
do you want to go into?

297
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,490
White hat business.

298
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:19,390
But it's not as if the King is dying. Why...?

299
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,590
I'm just going to pretend
I didn't hear this.

300
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:27,830
The King... is dying.

301
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,590
We've confirmed it with Lord
Jung Hong Soo in Hanyang.

302
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,230
The King is dying?
Is this true?

303
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:44,160
Yes.
And I don't want to lose this opportunity.

304
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:49,090
But we don't have the capital
to start a new business.

305
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:55,160
I know. But we've been
preparing for the past six years.

306
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,230
It's a once in a lifetime opportunity.

307
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:03,830
I support anything Man Deok does.
Here, here! Go for it!

308
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,930
Man Deok can never do wrong with you.

309
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,490
- Chok Sae,
- Yeah?

310
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,760
Are you drunk?

311
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,030
Have you ever seen me not drunk?

312
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:23,760
Well, we'll support you if you think this
is a good idea, but with what money?

313
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,990
Like Eun said, we don't
have a money growing tree.

314
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,830
How can we start a new business?

315
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,860
I'll take care of that, so don't worry.

316
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:40,230
But I do have one important request.

317
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:44,530
Do not tell anyone that we
are starting this business.

318
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:51,130
If word gets out that we're anticipating
the King's death and producing white hats,

319
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,730
we will face serious consequences.

320
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,530
Don't worry.

321
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:59,930
My lips are sealed!

322
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,260
Seek out talented hat makers in neighboring

323
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,260
villages and bring them to meet me.

324
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,990
Sure, I'll do that.
Don't worry.

325
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:19,190
Thank you all for trusting me on this.

326
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,230
You want to borrow my money?

327
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,690
Yes.

328
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:56,360
You do know that I'm Mu Meng Dal who
had lent money to East Gate. Don't you?

329
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,430
How could I forget?

330
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:05,930
But past is past. If you dwell
on the past, you can't go forward.

331
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,930
So how much do you need?

332
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:15,760
Twenty thousand nyangs.
Would it be possible?

333
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:26,830
Why not?
Money is all I've got.

334
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,660
But...

335
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,430
Collateral?

336
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:40,560
Ownership of our traveler's inn.
How about it?

337
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,890
I don't know.
You think this is enough?

338
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:51,930
It's just a tiny inn.

339
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,490
Then I guess I will go elsewhere.

340
00:31:55,490 --> 00:32:01,230
I didn't say no. Did I?
Twenty thousand?

341
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,490
Draw up a contract.
I'll pay you back in three months.

342
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,360
Did you hit something big?

343
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,660
Let's just say it's a new business.

344
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:22,190
Sure. I'm all for it if you
want to borrow my money.

345
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,060
Well then.

346
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:25,990
I don't have to remind you, do I?

347
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:33,130
That if you fail this time,
you're finished for good.

348
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,790
Of course.

349
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:55,590
I've asked you all to come here because
you are the best hat makers in Jeju.

350
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,360
Do you know how much
your talent is worth?

351
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:08,960
Well, I get one and a half nyangs
for a brim at the five day market.

352
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,630
Tongyoung Hat Shop pays you two.

353
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,230
I will pay you three times that.

354
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,860
No, you won't make any profit.

355
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,830
West Gate is always trying
to reduce our wage.

356
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:29,290
I will make a profit. Jeju is the
best in the country at hat making.

357
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:36,230
The hats you make sell for double in
Tongyoung and four times its cost in Hanyang.

358
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:42,260
I'm just paying what
your talent is really worth.

359
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,860
What our talent is really worth?

360
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,890
But there is one condition.

361
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:51,960
You must use your talent only for me.

362
00:33:53,160 --> 00:34:00,060
For the next six months, put all of
your effort into making hats for me.

363
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:04,590
And until we are done, you must
tell no one about our project.

364
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:10,160
If you don't think you can do this,
please leave the room now.

365
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,630
You're paying us a fair price.

366
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,790
How difficult could it be
to keep it a secret?

367
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:23,230
Until now, the brim and the hat
have been sold separately in Jeju.

368
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,860
Now we are going to change that.

369
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:35,730
If we succeed, every nobleman in
Joseon will wear a hat made in Jeju.

370
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,730
Doesn't that excite you?

371
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:59,790
Use the best material and make
the best hats you can possibly make.

372
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:04,160
I will double the pay for the
person who produces the finest hat.

373
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:15,960
Divide them into high, mid, and low grade
by color and refinement of workmanship.

374
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,630
Enjoy.

375
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,130
Goodness gracious!

376
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,390
What are you doing here?

377
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,630
Yong Cheon! Girls, get out here!

378
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:09,990
Why you...!

379
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,330
Wait, I can't waste salt on this crook.

380
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,990
What are you doing back here?

381
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,890
I came to see how my collateral is doing.

382
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,330
Didn't you know? I'm holding
this inn as collateral for a loan.

383
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,430
No way. Man Deok borrowed
money from this guy?

384
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,990
I can see that it wasn't for remodeling...

385
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:40,390
What kind of business are you folks doing
with my money? Can you give me a hint?

386
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:44,430
It's a hat business.
That's all we know.

387
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:51,760
Oh dear... West Gate has all of the
horsehair in Jeju. That's a bad idea.

388
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:58,690
I wonder how much this
place brings in daily.

389
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,590
That's it! Bad luck, go away!

390
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,760
Move! Move!

391
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:12,760
She borrowed money to start a new
business and she's making hats.

392
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:18,530
How can she make hats when
we own all the horsehair?

393
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,490
Who cares?

394
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,360
Even so, how could you lend her money?
Whose side are you on?

395
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:31,330
I don't care who it is as long as they make
good on the loan. The only side I'm on is mine.

396
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:36,490
You are a greedy old man.

397
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:41,160
Be that as it may, I cannot have
you helping that wench Man Deok.

398
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:48,760
Don't worry, Assistant Magistrate.
How successful can she be?

399
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,360
Has Man Deok lost her mind?

400
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,230
She still hasn't learned her lesson after
seeing what happened to Foreman Go.

401
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,960
You took something
as collateral I presume.

402
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,860
That traveler's inn is a hot little business.

403
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:09,790
Foolish girl will end up losing
the inn indulging her greed.

404
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,090
You are incredible, my lord!

405
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:17,090
Money just sticks to you wherever you go!

406
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,530
It sounds like you are ready
to stick to him for his money.

407
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:28,590
Tell me about it.
She is my sister, but...

408
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,160
Have you heard anything back from

409
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,660
Yoha from the Royal Music Institute?

410
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,560
Why do you bring up

411
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,130
that wench all of a sudden?

412
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,360
You're really giving us all this?

413
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,490
Your skills exceeded my expectations,
so I added a little more.

414
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:59,190
Please keep this confidential as promised.

415
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:06,690
If all goes well, I will also compensate
you for keeping your word.

416
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:09,660
Okay.
Let's go.

417
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,530
Man Deok!

418
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:21,260
I'm glad you're here.
Let's get these boxes on the ship.

419
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,860
Where are you sending them?

420
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,660
To Hanyang.

421
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,460
We're selling all this in Hanyang?

422
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:33,460
Once you get there, rent the closest warehouse
to the marketplace regardless of the price.

423
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,290
And?

424
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,790
And when you hear news of King's death,

425
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:40,860
go to the hat shop and supply them the
highest grade white hats wrapped in silk.

426
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,130
I guess if we're the first to offer the goods
when they don't have any white hats in stock,

427
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,530
we'll be able to get great price.

428
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,990
The best time is right after the
owner has met with a courtier.

429
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:58,790
They will care more about the quality
than the price,

430
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,030
so emphasize that they are Jeju's finest.

431
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:05,130
Our products in the royal palace?

432
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:10,230
We're going to seize the opportunity
let our name be known not just in

433
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:13,730
Hanyang but in the royal palace as well.

434
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:30,690
Make way!

435
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,930
Look at them. All of these people
are bowing their heads to you.

436
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,630
This is the power of money.

437
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,890
Remember that.

438
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,230
Father,

439
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:15,490
just as you dreamed, your company in
Hanyang has become the biggest in Joseon.

440
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,190
Are you content?

441
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:44,830
The woman who did this to us
cannot be allowed to live free.

442
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:53,590
I will get our revenge,
so you just watch, Father.

443
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:03,390
Boss!

444
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:07,530
Boss! What are you still doing here?

445
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,330
Let's go.
We must get back within two months.

446
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:34,330
Two months later

447
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:36,560
Thanks. I'll see you again tomorrow.

448
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,660
This is the second month.

449
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,230
We're here to make money, but we're
just making the warehouse owner rich!

450
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,890
Two months! Think about how many orders of
soup and rice you can buy with that money.

451
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:52,290
Do you think Man Deok
could be wrong about this?

452
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,230
Let's give it a few more days.

453
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,860
My man, what is this commotion about?

454
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:21,460
His Highness... His Highness is...

455
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:29,130
Your Highness!

456
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:56,330
Close your shops!
Close your shops!

457
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:01,490
Why are they closing the shops?

458
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:12,290
Do you see those people?
They're from the palace.

459
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,830
What? Really?

460
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,890
The King must have passed away.
I'm sure of it.

461
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,560
It's time. Let's move.

462
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,790
Okay.

463
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:32,860
Man Deok's Inn, Jeju

464
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:53,760
This is the best quality hat I've ever seen.
I'll pay you double the normal price!

465
00:45:54,790 --> 00:46:01,190
The palace will normally pay double the
wholesale price, but when there is a national

466
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,930
mourning, the seller names the price.

467
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,730
I will sell them for twelve
times the wholesale price.

468
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:14,060
Now you're being unreasonable.

469
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,590
You won't find white hats
of this quality anywhere else.

470
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,960
Ten times the wholesale price and you
have a deal. How do you want to be paid?

471
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,560
A promissory note will do.
We will cash it in Haenam.

472
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,730
Done.

473
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,830
East Gate Market Brokers of Jeju, right?

474
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:54,060
Let's do business again.

475
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,290
It would be our pleasure.

476
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:06,230
I can't even reckon how many sacks of rice
we can buy with this one piece of paper!

477
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,860
Good work, guys. Now let's sell
the rest of the goods and go home.

478
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:29,330
White hats from Tongyoung as promised.
We've got the best quality goods.

479
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:32,960
I've already acquired all the
white hats I need for the palace.

480
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,260
What? But we agreed to supply the white
hats in the event of a national mourning!

481
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,290
Words come cheap, fellows.

482
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,360
I need the hats by tomorrow.

483
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,230
How could I wait when I'm the one who'll get

484
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,930
flogged if the hats are not delivered on time?

485
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:45,960
Do you know how long

486
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,030
we've traveled for this?

487
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:50,660
Stop.

488
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,930
Which merchant did you buy from?

489
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:00,390
They were from Jeju.

490
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:03,190
Have a look yourself.

491
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:07,390
It's the finest quality and they had the goods
right in front of me. How could I pass up?

492
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:18,590
What did you pay them with?

493
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,430
We have a problem.

494
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:28,630
The licensed shops are closed for the
mourning, so the peddlers got together

495
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,030
and set up a market.

496
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,630
Round up the men.

497
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:37,030
But we are in national mourning.

498
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:38,930
Jung Hong Soo was assigned to the
Royal Coffin Hall Supervisory Council.

499
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:43,460
This is our chance while he is
preoccupied preparing for the funeral.

500
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,860
All right. I'll get to work.

501
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:58,660
Get your high quality white hats from East Gate
Market Brokers of Jeju with a huge discount!

502
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,290
Step right up, folks!

503
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:02,730
Discount?

504
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:05,890
Yes, sir! Why, you might even
convince me to give you one for free!

505
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,760
We are East Gate Market Brokers of Jeju!

506
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,930
Get in line, folks! Get in line!

507
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:33,330
I can buy new clothes, new shoes...

508
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:35,560
I'm going to have my wife
make me some japche.

509
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,490
I'm going to have myself some chicken!

510
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:38,760
This is great!

511
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:46,560
Who are you?

512
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:52,490
Even animals respect each other's territory.
How dare you do business on ours?

513
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,730
Men!

514
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:54,930
Get them!

515
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:02,860
Don't do this!

516
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,230
Don't hit me, you bastard!

517
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:15,230
Give it back.

518
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,260
Let's go!

519
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:46,930
Your time is up so pay up.

520
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:53,390
We still have 15 days left.
Please be patient.

521
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,730
Dong Ah! Dong Ah!

522
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:08,990
Dong Ah!

523
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:13,790
Dong Ah!

524
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,690
They... they took the note.

525
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:40,230
Subtitled by
KBS America

526
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:49,560
This bastard threatened the vice
boss when the market was raided.

527
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,290
Threatened him? How?

528
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:54,260
Give me back the note!

529
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,130
Search his house at once!

530
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:57,330
What do you mean you lost it?

531
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:59,390
When are you going to return my money?

532
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:02,660
It doesn't look like Man Deok is
going to make good on the loan.

533
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,730
What happened to the
peddlers market in Songpa?

534
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:08,530
We cannot allow the unlicensed peddlers
to cause us any more damage.

535
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:09,990
Arrest them all!

536
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,960
Yes, sir!

537
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,530
Lord Jeong is protecting the peddlers.

538
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:17,290
How can I do business like this?

539
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:20,360
Peddlers markets in Songpa and Newon
are threatening the licensed merchants.

540
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,530
We must put a stop to this.

541
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:23,230
Round up the peddlers.

542
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:25,190
Let's take them on once and for all.

543
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:27,090
Destroy everything!

544
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:29,690
I am reporting these men for physical
assault and property damage.

545
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:33,390
But the licensed merchants have
assaulted the peddlers as well.

546
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:35,360
Do you call it assault when the state guards

547
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,060
hurt the wrongdoers while restraining them?

548
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:39,530
Are you trying to play word games with me?
