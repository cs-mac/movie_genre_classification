I can't. I got  a music lesson.

Hello.

166
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,123
I believe it's me  you've come to see.

167
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,876
I watched you rolling about on those skates. You mustn't do that.

168
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,697
What if you fall  and something happens  to your hands?

169
00:11:09,697 --> 00:11:12,066
I never want to see you  with those skates again.

170

Leave them there.

171
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:24,129
No, not on the chair.   On the floor.

172
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,031
Perfect height.

173
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:35,136
Mmm-hmm.  You see?

174

I know exactly.   I know you exactly.

At the very beginning.

177

I want you to forget    everything you've    ever learned.

178
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:44,542
You begin with   the C Major scale.

179
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:45,085
Which hand?

180
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:47,358
Which hand, he asks? My poor child!

181
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:49,469
Do you think  you have two hands?

182
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:52,382
Both hands, for me    and the piano, are one.

183
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:55,197
Acting in total accord and perfect harmony. Begin.

184
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:05,852
You don't have to impress me  with how clever you think  you are.

185
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:08,634
You move around   far too much,   Mr. Virtuoso.

186
00:12:10,234 --> 00:12:12,315
Perfect scales have    no beginning and no end.

187
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,515
Each note is as smooth and as even as these beads.

You see?    Mmm-hmm.

189

Forget the fingers.

190
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:21,753
Don't think for one moment that you play with your fingers.

191
00:12:21,753 --> 00:12:23,032
If he'd thought    about his fingers,

192
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:26,743
he'd be at the bottom of the ocean, never to be heard from again.

What are these  10 poor little  worms? No!

194
00:12:30,487 --> 00:12:32,503
This is where   the music comes from.

195
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:33,688
From the abdomen,

196
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:36,599
and it rises   higher and higher

197
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:39,383
from the depths  of your very soul.

198
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,678
Higher and higher   from the deepest   instincts

199
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:46,197
to the height of reason until it reaches here.

200
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:49,014
Do you see? Now begin.

201
00:12:49,014 --> 00:12:50,484
Begin.

Ebb and flow.    Each note    smooth and even.

205
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:02,996
That's it.

206

My poor child. Come.

322
00:19:46,464 --> 00:19:49,950
Listen, what have   I told you so many times?

323
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:52,477
It is all one.

324
00:19:52,477 --> 00:19:56,093
The way we dress,   the way we speak,   the way we play,

325
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,917
it's all connected.

326
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:02,974
Well, I'll see you on Friday,  Madame Sousootzka. Okay?

327
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:05,821
Sousatzka.

328
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:08,540
Sousatzka. Sousatzka.

329
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,387
Yes, Sousatzka.  It was  Maman's name.

330
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,564
Sousatzka.

331
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:16,315
Sousatzka.

332
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:21,755
You won't tell her,    will you?

333
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:24,506
(MOUTHING) No, no, no.

334
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:26,809
This is jasmine.

335
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,370
Grows in your beautiful  country, doesn't it?

336
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,257
I wouldn't know.  I've never been.

337
00:20:34,585 --> 00:20:37,336
This is a new cloth   that's just come in, sir.   Do you like that?

338
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,344
No. No, no, no.  Something more classic.

339
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:43,097
Maman's family  lost everything  in the revolution, Manek.

340
00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:44,023
The French Revolution?

341
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:45,848
Oh, my goodness,  dear boy, you're ignorant.

342
00:20:45,848 --> 00:20:47,128
The Russian Revolution.

343
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:49,751
Then they fled to Paris  for 10 years and after that  to New York,

344
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:52,503
where  maman met  papa
  and I grew up.

345
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:54,295
A blazer.    That's very classic.

346
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:57,239
(EXCLAIMS)  I don't like that.  This, I don't like.

347
00:20:57,239 --> 00:21:01,014
Now, you see,  you need to develop style  to go with those looks.

348
00:21:01,014 --> 00:21:02,293
Those beautiful looks.

349
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:03,509
I think we'll try this.

350
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:05,269
I can't wear that stuff.    I'd look silly.

351
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:08,693
Nonsense!  It'll help you be a man.  Fetch some ties.

352
00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:11,156
You see,  maman
  wore only white  till after  papa left,

353
00:21:11,156 --> 00:21:13,779
and then she wore  only black because  she felt like a widow,

354
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:16,468
even though he was  living in the next block  with another woman.

(GROANS) Silly boy!

357
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:24,050
So, after  papa left,    mama couldn't bear   to stay in New York.

358
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,995
But then she was  offered a position at  the Royal College of Music,

359
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:29,074
so we moved on to London.

360
00:21:29,074 --> 00:21:32,208
How are you  doing in there?  Let me have a look, Manek.

361
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,801
I'll come out  when I'm ready.

362
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:37,809
MADAME SOUSATZKA:    Oh, everyone adored     mam at the Royal College.

363
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:39,631
It was, "What does    Elena think of this?

364
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,776
"How does Elena   feel about that?"

365
00:21:41,776 --> 00:21:45,199
Her English was terrible,   but they adored her   Russian accent.

366
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:48,143
Ta!    Ah!

367
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:51,375
No, I want something more vibrant.

368
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,879
Vibrant?

369
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:54,893
I see.

370
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:57,647
No, no, no, no, no.    This is no concern of yours.

371
00:21:57,647 --> 00:21:58,702
I'll take care of that.

372
00:21:58,702 --> 00:22:01,709
Now, I'll teach you how to offer a lady your arm.

373
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:03,789
Yes.

374
00:22:06,253 --> 00:22:08,301
Vibrant? You'll get vibrant.

What's so damn funny?

377
00:22:23,914 --> 00:22:26,635
Is this her idea of how    a young boy should dress?

378
00:22:26,635 --> 00:22:28,650
You can see   she's never had   any children.

And relax.

382

Now, don't think that  pain is a permanent  condition.

383
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:42,375
Most definitely not.

384
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,640
But, then,   nothing ever is,   is it?

385
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,951
Permanent?  (THUDDING)

Not pain nor pleasure.  (MADAME SOUSATZKA SHOUTING)

That's the human condition.  (PIANO PLAYING)

Or, shall we say,  the condition  of being human.

Just lift your head,   that's it.

You see, Madame and Beethoven make your muscles go like this.

This is hardly  a sweatshop.

00:49:59,315 --> 00:50:00,722
Her Tchaikovsky simply  wasn't wild enough.

804
00:50:00,722 --> 00:50:02,387
It might as well  have been Debussy.

805
00:50:02,387 --> 00:50:03,762
BLUM: Well,  she's mostly in Japan.

806
00:50:03,762 --> 00:50:06,450
It doesn't matter there,  I suppose. Excuse me.   What?

807
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,785
I'm sorry. Excuse me   just a moment.   Do you mind?

808
00:50:08,785 --> 00:50:11,410
Many congratulations.  It was a wonderful  performance.

809
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,297
Would you mind just  signing my friend's...

810
00:50:13,297 --> 00:50:15,121
My pleasure.

811
00:50:15,121 --> 00:50:16,689
Wonderful surprise!    How are you?

812
00:50:16,689 --> 00:50:17,744
I wanted to   surprise you.    Oh!

813
00:50:17,744 --> 00:50:19,535
Thanks very much indeed.   We'll catch you later on.

814
00:50:19,535 --> 00:50:21,455
Thank you. Excuse me.

815
00:50:21,455 --> 00:50:24,848
If you want to get    to the front, you've got    to push. Always.

816
00:50:24,848 --> 00:50:26,768
Ronnie Blum.   Manek Sen.

817
00:50:27,311 --> 00:50:28,527
Ronnie!

818
00:50:28,527 --> 00:50:31,087
Hello, Leo. What a marvelous evening.

819
00:50:31,087 --> 00:50:32,557
Manek,   this is Leo Milev,

820
00:50:32,557 --> 00:50:35,375
one of the truly great    piano teachers    of the world.

821
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:38,126
This is Manek, a young man with a big future.

822
00:50:38,126 --> 00:50:40,813
Madame's latest.  Ah.

823
00:50:40,813 --> 00:50:43,917
You should get Leo  to let you sit in on  one of his master classes.

824
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:44,974
WOMAN: Oh, I wanted   to surprise you.

825
00:50:44,974 --> 00:50:46,381
How is the family?

826
00:50:46,381 --> 00:50:48,556
Oh, they're well,   they're well.

827
00:50:48,556 --> 00:50:51,371
I believe this is hers. She might not like to take it from me.

828
00:50:51,371 --> 00:50:54,187
She still hasn't   forgiven me.

829
00:50:54,187 --> 00:50:55,980
Oh, you mean Edward?    Uh-huh.

830
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,388
Where is Edward    these days?

831
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,179
He's in Ottawa,    and in precisely    half an hour

832
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:01,803
he'll be playing    the Bartok    Second Concerto.

833
00:51:01,803 --> 00:51:03,723
How long is it since  you last saw each other?

834
00:51:03,723 --> 00:51:06,377
Up in New York.  WOMAN: Up in New York.

835
00:51:06,377 --> 00:51:08,010
Are you still  in the same place?

836
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:10,345
Could you excuse me?   Sure.

837
00:51:11,786 --> 00:51:14,248
How are you?  You look gorgeous.

838
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,489
Oh. Oh.

839
00:51:16,489 --> 00:51:18,505
It's really time to go, Manek.

840
00:51:18,505 --> 00:51:20,072
Excuse me, Mr. Blum.

841
00:51:21,415 --> 00:51:24,167
What did he say to you, Mr. Ronnie Blum?

842
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:25,800
He wants   to hear me play.

843
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,720
And what did  you say to him?

844
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,967
That he'd have to talk to you.

845
00:51:28,967 --> 00:51:30,630
Quite right.

846
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,574
Is Ronnie  Jenny's boyfriend?

847
00:51:36,774 --> 00:51:39,365
He won't last  five minutes,

848
00:51:39,365 --> 00:51:42,118
because a greedy agent got hold of him and started him much too early.

849
00:51:42,118 --> 00:51:44,196
I've seen it happen    over and over.

850
00:51:44,196 --> 00:51:46,373
Fail once and  they'll drop you  like a hot potato.

851
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,980
This is one    of Leo Milev's students.

852
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,060
I saw you talking   to Leo.

853
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:56,612
What did he have to say?   What did Leo have to say?

854
00:51:56,612 --> 00:51:58,339
He gave me this.

855
00:51:58,627 --> 00:51:59,683
Oh.

856
00:52:00,739 --> 00:52:02,531
Poor Leo. Frankly,  I don't like him,

857
00:52:02,531 --> 00:52:03,970
but I feel sorry    for him.

858
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,443
In the middle   of a good career,

859
00:52:05,443 --> 00:52:07,458
he lost the use of his arm.

860
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:10,306
What else did he have to say?

861
00:52:10,306 --> 00:52:12,258
Did he talk about Edward?   What did he say, huh?

862
00:52:12,258 --> 00:52:13,504
He said to   give you the bead.

863
00:52:13,504 --> 00:52:17,568
No, not that.  Why do they all think  I still care about Edward?

864
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:19,969
Where is Edward now?

865
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:22,625
In Ottawa,    playing the Bartok    Second Concerto.

866
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:24,319
Oh.  Right now.

867
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,720
Bartok!  As though he could  ever play Bartok.

868
00:52:57,436 --> 00:52:59,099
Bartok!

869
00:53:15,545 --> 00:53:17,529
Ah, Madame Sousatzka!    (GASPS)

870
00:53:19,001 --> 00:53:20,473
I did knock.

871
00:53:20,473 --> 00:53:22,393
I'm glad to catch you  alone for a moment.

872
00:53:22,393 --> 00:53:25,976
Look, would you care  to join me for  a spot of lunch?

873
00:53:25,976 --> 00:53:28,600
I'm extremely busy, Mr. Blum.

874
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,584
Then I'll come straight  to the point.

875
00:53:30,584 --> 00:53:32,630
I'd like to hear  Manek play.

876
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:34,519
Oh, that's impossible.

877
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:36,727
That's quite impossible.    Manek is no concern    of yours.

878
00:53:36,727 --> 00:53:37,751
But why?

879
00:53:37,751 --> 00:53:39,159
You teach him  how to play,

880
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:40,309
I, how to make a living.

881
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:42,103
Making a living as you put it, Mr. Blum,

882
00:53:42,103 --> 00:53:44,054
is not what music   is all about.

883
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,902
And I have a rule    that none of my students    will appear in public

884
00:53:46,902 --> 00:53:48,181
before he or she    is ready.

885
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:49,685
I see.

886
00:53:50,964 --> 00:53:53,076
And who decides    when that is?

887
00:53:53,076 --> 00:53:55,444
I decide, of course.

888
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:58,356
In every case   and in this case   especially.

889
00:53:59,155 --> 00:54:02,260
Rubinstein, Lipatti,

890
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,634
Nadia Boulanger,

891
00:54:05,107 --> 00:54:06,514
Schnabel.

892
00:54:06,514 --> 00:54:10,322
I remember hearing him play when I was four years old, at the Albert Hall.

893
00:54:10,322 --> 00:54:14,258
You see, we all have music  in our blood in a sense,  Mr. Blum.

894
00:54:14,258 --> 00:54:16,049
Even you.

895
00:54:16,049 --> 00:54:18,001
All of  our great-grandmothers  played Chopin.

896
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:21,585
Well, actually mine    ironed shirts    down the Mile End Road.

897
00:54:21,585 --> 00:54:25,680
Manek's great-grandmother   played the sitar   or some such instrument,

898
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:30,192
and so now he has to  catch up on 600 years  of European music.

899
00:54:30,192 --> 00:54:32,174
Well, I'm afraid    I can't wait that long.

900
00:54:32,174 --> 00:54:34,896
(LAUGHING) Perhaps  you shouldn't wait at all.

Mr. Blum was   just leaving.

904
00:54:40,174 --> 00:54:42,030
Hi. How are you?

905
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,982
Nice to see you again. Hello.

906
00:54:43,982 --> 00:54:45,550
Yes, I was just telling Madame

907
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:47,789
how very much I'd like  to hear you play.

908
00:54:47,789 --> 00:54:49,580
(MOUTHING) No.

909
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:50,701
What do you   want to hear?

910
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:52,557
Madame says I can't.

911
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:54,061
Why?

912
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:56,268
She forbids it.

913
00:54:56,268 --> 00:54:58,188
Why can't I play    for Mr. Blum?

914
00:55:10,699 --> 00:55:12,682
All right, then. Play.

915
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:16,106
Play! Play for anyone.

916
00:55:16,106 --> 00:55:17,514
Play in the street  for all I care.

917
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:19,208
Don't let me stop you.

918
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:22,345
There's no need at all to respect my wishes or my feelings.

919
00:55:23,849 --> 00:55:26,025
And go on,  sit in  Maman's chair!

I don't know why    you can't tell her.

I'm afraid this has to be our last warning.

    the overture o The Marriage   of Figaro  by Mozart.

1597
01:36:47,172 --> 01:36:50,052
The London Symphony
  Orchestra was conducted
  by Christopher Adey.

continues with
   the performance of
  The Piano Concerto in A minor

1601
01:36:57,731 --> 01:36:59,364
by Robert Schumann,

1602
01:36:59,364 --> 01:37:02,787
which he dedicated to
   his wife, the concert
   pianist Clara Wieck.

1603
01:37:02,787 --> 01:37:05,219
Tonight's soloist,
      Manek Sen,

1604
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:07,458
is actually making
     his debut at this
     festival concert.

1605
01:37:07,458 --> 01:37:09,474
He's only 15 years old.

1606
01:37:09,474 --> 01:37:11,969
He was born in England
    of Indian-born parents...
    One deep breath.

1607
01:37:11,969 --> 01:37:15,138
...and he's a pupil at
  the Ebury Bridge comprehensive
  school in London.

1608
01:37:15,138 --> 01:37:17,857
He's studying the piano

Manek, what do you think    you're doing? You must    come back.

1615
01:44:34,505 --> 01:44:36,775
I can't go back... You must come back.

1616

Hardly anybody would have   even heard the mistake.

(CHEERING)

1618
01:45:11,428 --> 01:45:14,146
I thought his playing was a little too temperamental,

1619
01:45:14,146 --> 01:45:15,843
but that's youth.

1620
01:45:15,843 --> 01:45:17,187
Absolutely wild.

1621
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:19,169
It was a triumph.

1622
01:45:19,169 --> 01:45:20,962
Oh, thank you.    Thank you so much.

1623

I do hope your cooking  is as good as your  son's piano playing.

1624
01:45:23,649 --> 01:45:25,729
No, really?   He was marvelous.

1625
01:45:25,729 --> 01:45:26,849
Very successful day.

1626
01:45:26,849 --> 01:45:28,354
Boy, do I need a lager.

1627
01:45:28,354 --> 01:45:29,344

It simply doesn't   matter at all.

    please don't be angry,

1659
01:50:16,316 --> 01:50:19,483
but I've decided to
    study with Leo Milev.

I shall never forget
    what you've taught me,

and I will always
   be grateful.

    and will forgive me.

When I first came here, that was over 10 years ago,

I was more nervous  than you are now,  I'm sure.
