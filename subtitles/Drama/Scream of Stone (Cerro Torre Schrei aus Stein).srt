2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,800
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,960
Moving onto the Hollywood Freeway,
we have a multiple vehicle...

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,520
multiple injury accident.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,360
An absolute mess
from VineStreet to the valley.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,600
If you're in it,
expect a long commute.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,920
If you're not,
seek alternate routes.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,120
If Dan doesn 't want to do a daily rate,
we can talk about a weekly rate.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,200
But I'm tellin' you right now,
I'm not goin' below a million.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,240
I mean, think about it.
I'm risking my reputation...

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,280
as the host
of this country's number-one...

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,120
nationally syndicated talk show to do
a cameo in some cheap slasher flick.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,320
I mean, why can't these guys write me
a fuckin' decent part?

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,800
You know?
I lived through the fuckin' thing.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,840
By the way, did you talk to Cathy
about that Navy SEAL script?

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,440
Hang on a sec.

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,160
- Hello?
- Hello?

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,480
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,640
- Who are you calling?
- Oh. You know what?

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,920
- I'm sorry. I have the wrong number.
- That's okay.

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,640
Wait a minute. I know your voice.

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,400
You sound a lot like that guy on TV.
Um, Cotton Weary.

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,280
- I do, huh?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,560
I think he's got
a really sexy voice.

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,640
- Well, thank you.
- Wait a minute.

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,320
You are Cotton, aren't you?
Oh, my God.

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,880
I am talking to Cotton Weary.
I can't believe this.

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,200
You got me. Look, I've--
I've got someone on the other line.

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,360
Can you hold on one second?
I'll be right back, I promise.

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,480
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,480
Andrea, uh, I gotta call you back.
Someone's on the other line.

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,800
So, uh, you a big 100% Cotton fan?

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,320
- Yeah! One hundred and ten percent.
- That's very good.

34
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,080
So, um, why don't you tell me
who you are?

35
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,040
Ooh! You're a naughty boy, Cotton.
Now, what would your girlfriend say?

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,400
What makes you think
I have a girlfriend?

37
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,200
I know you do.

38
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,120
- I'm right outside her bathroom door.
- Who is this?

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,040
She's in the shower.
She's got a nice little voice.

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,040
Let's come in for a closer look.

41
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,400
She's very pretty, Cotton.

42
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,400
A step up from
Maureen Prescott.

43
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,680
Speaking of which,
let's play a little game.

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,040
Answer right,
your girlfriend lives.

45
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,120
Answer wrong, she dies.

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,040
- Where's Maureen's daughter, Sidney?
- Who the fuck is this?

47
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,680
Somebody who'd kill to know
where Sidney Prescott is!

48
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,320
One chance, Cotton!
You've got connections. Where is she?

49
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,520
You listen to me, you fuckin' psycho.
You lay a finger on Christine...

50
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,040
- and I swear to God I'll kill you.
- Wrong answer!

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,440
No! Wait!
Hello? Shit!

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,480
- Hey!
- Get outta the way!

53
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,400
- You just hit me!
- Move!

54
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,760
Christine, if you're there,
pick up the phone!

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,840
Christine, pick up the phone!
Oh, shit!

56
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,360
You have reached 911.
Due to the volume of calls--

57
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,640
Someone pick up the goddam phone!
Move outta the way!

58
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,400
Shit! Shit!

59
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,920
Cotton, is that you?

60
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,960
Cotton?

61
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,440
Honey?

62
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,120
Okay, Cotton.

63
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,680
You know I don't like
your Stab games.

64
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,360
- Who is it? Who's there?
- Christine?

65
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,040
Hon, you all right?

66
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,280
- I'm home.
-Jesus! You scared the shit outta me.

67
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,360
- You're not gonna believe
what just happened to me.
- What are you talking about?

68
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,240
- Get the hell out of here!
- Okay. Okay, I'm sorry, babe.

69
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,000
I didn't mean to scare you that bad.
It's me. Come on, open the door.

70
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,640
- What are you doing?
- What?
- What the fuck are you doing?

71
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,120
I was-- I was just, you know, trying
to take the game to the next level.

72
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,440
- I'm sorry. Come on,
open the door, Chris.
- The game?

73
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,000
- Yeah, the game!
- What are you talking about?

74
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm talking about how much fun it's
gonna be to rip your insides out!

75
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,960
Now, open the fuckin' door, Christine!

76
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,040
- Oh, my God!
- Now you're fuckin' history, baby!

77
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,120
Christine?

78
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,880
Hon?

79
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,720
The recent epidemic of roadrage
in Los Angeles.

80
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,920
- Innocent commuters mercilessly
terrorized, even killed...
- Chris?

81
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,960
- by these madmen of the freeway.
- Don't mess around, okay?

82
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,920
We're gonna make them confront their
victims face-to-face, mano a mano...

83
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,600
right here on 100% Cotton.

84
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,720
There is carnage on our streets.
And remember, it could happen to you.

85
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,080
Tomorrow on 100% Cotton!
Roadrage.

86
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,080
L.A. drivers fight back.

87
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,120
The news is next on channel six with our
exclusive entertainment report live...

88
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
from tonight's celebrity
premiere in Hollywood...

89
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,960
followed by--

90
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,440
Oh, shit.

91
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,640
Chris?

92
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,560
Is that you, babe?

93
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,720
Chris, if you're in there,
open the door. Okay, honey?

94
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,400
Chris? Come on, baby.
Open the door.

95
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,400
Chris! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jesus!

96
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,720
- It's me, Chris. What are you doin'?
- Stay back.

97
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,400
Stay back.

98
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,600
- Chris, what's goin' on, babe?
- You've gone crazy. That's what!

99
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,800
- Chris, was somebody in the house?
- No! Get back!

100
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,720
Okay, okay, okay.
Just calm down, okay?

101
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,320
- Why do you want to kill me?
- What are you talking about?

102
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,600
- Why do you wanna kill me?
- Gimme the club. All right, honey?
Gimme the club.

103
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,840
Gimme the club, please.

104
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,400
Christine, get outta the way!

105
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,480
Behind you!

106
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,960
Shit!

107
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,200
It was a simple game, Cotton.
You should've told me where Sidney was.

108
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,120
Now, you lose.

109
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,920
Come on.

110
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,880
Come on, Cherokee.
Come on.

111
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,520
Come on.

112

Come on, Cherokee.

California Women's Crisis Counseling.

114
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,680
Hey, it's Laura from Monterrey reporting
to work. Can you patch me in?

115
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,680
- Sure. Thanks, Laura.
- Thank you.

116
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,920
California Women's Crisis Counseling.
How can I help you?

117
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,760
Hi. Um, do I have to say my name?

118
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,200
No, you don't have to say anything
you don't want to say.

119
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,360
- How can I help?
- Um--

120
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,400
I'm 18 years old,
and I have a boyfriend.

121
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,760
- Sometimes he hits me.
- It's okay.

122
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,880
- You can talk to me, all right?
- Thanks.

123
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,720
So, in closing, as
the future journalists of America...

124
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,720
there is one thing
that you need to remember.

125
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,160
Being the best means being willing
to do what the others would not.

126
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,960
Break the rules.
Stop at nothing.

127
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,840
Be willing to have the world hate you,
because that is the only way...

128
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,480
that you'll get the story,
the facts and the fame.

129
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,400
Thank you.

130
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,720
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yes?

131
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,920
So you're saying that we should
be ready to go out...

132
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,000
and cut each other's throats
because that's what you did.

133
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,840
- Metaphorically, yes.
- Well, tell me, Miss Weathers.

134
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,120
- Was it worth it?
- I'm so sorry. We're out of time.

135
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,320
Gale Weathers, anchor woman for
Total Entertainment.

136
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,920
Thank you very much!

137
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,160
There is a young man outside
who wants to see you.

138
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,640
- He says he's with the police.
- The police?

139
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,360
- Detective Mark Kincaid, L.A.P.D.
- Hello.

140
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,360
- That's quite an impressive resume.
- Thank you.

141
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,360
I assume you're not here
for an autograph.

142
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,960
I'm here because
Cotton Weary's been murdered.

143
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,760
- Someone killed Cotton?
- And his girlfriend.

144
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,200
Someone who left something
he wanted us to see.

145
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,880
I'll show you this because
you're the Woodsboro authority
and because you knew him.

146
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,320
But I promise you,
if you share this with the world,
it's you I'll be arresting.

147
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,160
I swear on my Pulitzer Prize, which
I plan to win one day, Detective.

148
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,560
This was left on Cotton Weary's body.
You have any idea who the girl might be?

149
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,320
Oh, my God.

150
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,920
This is Maureen Prescott.
This is Sidney Prescott's mother.

151
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,880
Hollywood is reeling today
from news...

152
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,240
of the murder of controversial
talkshow host Cotton Weary.

153
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,840
Weary had only recently finished
shooting a cameo as himself...

154
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,040
in the film
Stab 3, Return to Woodsboro...

155
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,040
the third and final part
of the famous horror series...

156
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,160
based on the Woodsboro
and Windsor College murders.

157
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,000
Before his rise to television fame,
Cotton had been imprisoned...

158
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,240
and was later exonerated for the murder
of Maureen Prescott, his former lover--

159
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,840
Just yesterday, Cotton Weary was
shooting here at Sunrise Studios...

160
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,240
his first cameo
in a feature film, Stab 3.

161
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,000
Security here is tight, but we'll see
if we can get a statement. Excuse me.

162
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,000
Always a controversial man--

163
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,800
Channel Eight news.
We gotta get in. We gotta get in.

164
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,440
No press beyond this point.

165
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,280
Alone at night
he crosses flames

166
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:19,200
Ashe makes a fist
with his red right hand

167
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,400
Look, you're worried about the movie,
then protect the movie, okay?

168
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,360
Hire more security. Hire the National
Guard.Just don't kill the movie.

169
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,400
Violence in cinema
is a big deal right now, Roman.

170
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,640
This is not the kind of news
this studio is after.

171
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,680
So if we stop making
scary movies, what?

172
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,680
All the psychos in the world
will retire? Come on.

173
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,200
I've been makin' horror movies for
30 years, never had a psycho problem.

174
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,200
He was your goddamn idea, guys.
All right?

175
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,200
An ex-con with a trashy talk show?
He must've pissed people off every day.

176
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,760
Detectives, there's no reason
to presume that Cotton's death...

177
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,840
had anything to do
with this movie, is there?

178
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:56,000
He was making a movie called Stab.
He was stabbed.

179
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,280
Probably some psycho fan pissed off
they killed Randy in Stab 2.

180
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,280
Well, Tyson, that'd make you next,
wouldn't it?

181
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,200
I am not a Randy substitute.
I'm my own character.

182
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,920
Named Ricky,
who works at the video store.

183
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,800
It's an homage.

184
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,000
Hey! What if the killer's
Sidney Prescott?

185
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,200
I mean, what the hell ever happened to
her? She's probably off in the woods...

186
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,680
livin' like
the fuckin' Unabomber, man.

187
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,760
I'm starting to see why
Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer
didn't want to come back.

188
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,320
Guys, this was about Cotton.
We are not in any danger.

189
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,600
"We are not in any danger,"
says Candy, page 15.

190
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,600
I don't see you leavin'.

191
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,760
You think serious black actors
my age can just throw away jobs?

192
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,680
It's all a business now. They got
Usher doing Pinter off-Broadway.

193
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,880
L.L. Cool J's
Shakespearin' in the park.

194
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,400
- Yeah!
- Maybe it's not meant to be.

195
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,920
Not meant to be? You win that
talent search for the new Sidney.

196
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,320
50,000 girls and they pick you. You
gotta be praying this movie keeps going.

197
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,080
Of course I am, but not
at the expense of people's lives.

198
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,080
Oh. Cue the violins, right?

199
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,920
Jesus.

200
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,720
Deja voodoo.

201
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,640
We need this area cleared, please.
Clear it.

202
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,320
- Gale Weathers! Oh, my God!
- Shit.

203
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,320
I-- Listen,
I-I-- I know we've never met...

204
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,800
and I don't mind you never returning
my calls, but I have to tell you...

205
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,400
after two films,
I feel like I am in your mind.

206
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,560
Well, that would explain
my constant headaches.

207
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,520
You know, I'm sorry things didn't
work out on 60 Minutes II.

208
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,240
- But Total Entertainment,
that's a pretty good fallback.
- Thank you.

209
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,600
I'm sorry that things didn't
work out with Brad Pitt...

210
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,720
but being single,
that's a pretty good fallback.

211
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,720
Gives me more time
for my work.

212
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,400
After all, Gale Weathers,
you're such a complex character.

213
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,720
Oh, and to be played by an actress
with such depth and range.

214
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,560
Uh,Jennifer,
Nick said you wanted to--

215
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,120
Gale.

216
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,240
Dewey.

217
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,560
Well, surprise, surprise.
Someone dies and Gale comes running.

218
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,840
Gale, I think you'll really appreciate
my character work in this one.

219
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,560
- Someone's helped me
understand the real you.
- Someone?

220
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Your ruthless ambition,
your private self-loathing...

221
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,680
and that lost and lonely
little girl inside.

222
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,680
Lost and lonely what?

223
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,920
You heard me.
Thanks, Dewey, I'll return it.

224
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,400
Lost and lonely what?

225
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,000
- Little girl inside.
- I thought you were
supposed to be in Woodsboro.

226
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,400
Well, I'm surprised
you thought about me at all.

227
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,480
Listen, I gotta get back to work.
I really don't have time for this.

228
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,800
- Wait a minute. You work here?
- Yeah.

229
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,640
The movie needed
a technical advisor.

230
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,320
Someone who went through the real
experience, knew the real people.

231
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,640
- Hey, Dewey.
- Hey, Tom.

232
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,680
Hey! It's the real Gale Weathers.

233
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Real from top to bottom.

234
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
Tom Prinze.
Watch your show all the time.

235
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,560
You're so right. Pop culture
is the politics ofthe 21 st century.

236
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,480
- Thank you.
- And that story that you did...

237
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,800
last month on me crashing my car?

238
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,040
-Wow, was that ever powerful journalism.
-Right, uh--

239
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,360
I especially liked the way
you implied that it was caused
by drinking and drugs.

240
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,360
And that the tyre blowout was faked.
That was great.

241
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,480
Tom, sometimes in journalism
you have to--

242
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,040
Are you parked in the lot?
'Cause I should check to make sure...

243
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,800
that nobody's messed
with your brake line.

244
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,400
Who's he supposed to be?

245
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,240
He's playing you? Him?

246
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,440
What?

247
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,760
I did not come here
to fight with you, Dewey.

248
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,840
- Cotton's killer left a picture.
- Of Sid's mom.

249
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,680
- The detectives told me.
- Well, does Sidney know about it?

250
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,440
Listen, Sidney doesn't need
you and your camera in her life.

251
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,960
Do you see a camera?

252
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
Right. You bought me
this purse, didn't you?

253
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,320
- Yeah.
- Look, it's-it's a habit.

254
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,280
-I-I walk outta the house, I turn it on.
-What the hell is this?

255
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,040
- It's like perfume.
- Gale Weathers?

256
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,520
- Could I be more popular?
- No press.

257
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,120
Mo press on set.
Get that woman outta here.

258
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,400
- Yes, Mr Milton. Let's go.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where is Detective Kincaid?

259
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,400
- I am working with Kincaid, Dewey.
- Come on. Move along, miss. Let's go.

260
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:22,440
Rules are rules, Gale.
But, really, it was great seeing you.

261
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,160
Stab 3 is a closed set. But just up
ahead is the old Seinfeld stage.

262
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Now, does anybody
need a potty break?

263
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,800
- Oh, I do.
- Yeah, me too.

264
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,520
Okay, let go!
Thanks for your help, boys.

265
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,480
Holy shit, Silent Bob. It's that
TV news chick, Connie-fuckin'-Chung!

266
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,800
Hey, Connie, how's Maury?

267
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,440
Dude, I think she likes me.
See how she's lookin' at me?

268
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,720
It's happening again.

269
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,280
Cotton had a lot
of enemies, Sid.

270
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,120
The police aren't saying
it's related to us.

271
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,200
Do you ever think about her?

272
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,560
Your mom?

273
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,760
None of this would've
ever happened if she hadn't--

274
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,360
if she hadn't--

275
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,800
Why'd she have
so many secrets, Dad?

276
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,960
Listen, maybe it's time
you came home.

277
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,600
I'm worried about you, kid. Out here
by yourself. You never see anyone.

278
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,400
The only people you talk to
don't even know your real name.

279
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,160
It's as if you don't exist.

280
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,480
That's the idea. Psychos
can't kill what they can't find.

281
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,400
Sid, come here.

282
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,160
Mother needs to talk to you.

283
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,800
Everything you touch, Sid, dies!

284
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,600
You're poison.
You're just like me.

285
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,560
You're just like me.

286
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:14,400
Oh, my God!
What have they done to me?

287
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,160
They'll do it to you.

288
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,080
- They'll do it to you, baby.
- Mom?

289
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,600
Roman?

290
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,520
Stab 3.
Jesus, I gotta get a new agent.

291
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,680
Roman?

292
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,040
Someone here?

293
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,640
Stan, my man.
He does good work, huh?

294
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,640
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Fuck you very much.

295
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,600
- Tyson, go to hell.
- Well, excuse us, Sarah. Makeup tests.

296
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,560
Yeah, makeup. You can use it.
Damn it, have you seen Roman?

297
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,080
Look, everyone in the office
has gone home already.

298
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,000
- He said it was important.
- Everything's important to Roman.

299
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,480
Oh, shit!

300
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,640
- Director's office.
- Sarah, it's Roman.

301
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,680
I'm sorry I'm running late. I'm still
on the 405. I'm about ten minutes away.

302
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,200
Oh, it's no problem. I'm just
lookin' at your music video awards.

303
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,680
Since I got you on thephone, let's--
let's talk about your character, okay?

304
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,800
What character? I'm Candy,
the chick who gets killed second.

305
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,080
- I'm only in two scenes.
- You're not happy with your part.

306
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,000
I'm not happy that I am
35 playing a 21-year-old.

307
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,120
I'm not happy
that I have to die naked.

308
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,080
And I'm not happy that my character is
too stupid to have a gun in the house...

309
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,040
after her boyfriend's
been cut into fish sticks.

310
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,400
Great, okay.
So let's--let's run the lines.

311
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,200
Fine.

312
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,760
Page28.
Candy's big moment.

313
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,920
Page 28.

314
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,400
Ring-ring.
Hello?

315
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,000
- Hello?
- Who's this?

316
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,200
- Who's this?
- This is Candy.

317
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,240
Hang on.
Let me get some clothes.

318
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,240
See? I don't understand why I have
to start the scene in the shower.

319
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,800
The whole shower thing's been done.
Vertigo. Hello?

320
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,160
And I mean, my boyfriend just died.
Why am I showering?

321
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,360
Why don't we just read the scene?

322
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,360
Candy. Nice name. Is that like
Candy Cane or Candy Apple?

323
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,800
Whatever.

324
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,080
Come on.
Who is this?

325
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,400
I think you have
the wrong number.

326
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,000
- But you know my favourite name?
- I'm hanging up right now.

327
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,000
It's Sarah.

328
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,360
Roman, that's not the line.

329
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,920
It is in my script.

330
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,840
Has there been another goddam rewrite?
How the fuck...

331
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,840
are we supposed to learn our lines when
there's a new script every 15 minutes?

332
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,760
It's not just a new script.
It's a new movie.

333
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,160
- What? What movie?
- My movie.

334
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,280
And it's called Sarah Gets
Skewered Like a Fuckin' Pig!

335
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,440
Still in character, Sarah?

336
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,200
Shit.

337
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,480
Thank you for calling

commissary menu, press one.

345

Shit!

346
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,840
Oh! Fuck!

347
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,840
Look, I wanna get something straight.

348
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,520
I only got into this because
the police asked for my help.

349
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,640
- Why would the police come to you?
- Well, I did write..

350
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,800
the definitive book
on the Woodsboro murders.

351
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,720
I'm sure you just can't wait
to write another one.

352
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,400
- What about you?
- What about me?

353
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,000
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro.
"It's the only place that's real."

354
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,160
But now you're here.
Not with me.

355
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,640
Dewey, I took care ofyou.

356
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,360
I waited until you were well,
but I couldn't stay there.

357
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,560
It was like dog years. One year in
Woodsboro is like seven anywhere else.

358
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,400
So it's off to Paris for a week?
New York for a month? L.A. forever?

359
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,160
It was fucking 60 Minutes II.

360
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,160
- I couldn't say no. I could've
been the next Diane Sawyer.
- Wait a minute.

361
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,400
What's wrong with just being
Gale Weathers? I liked her.

362
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,920
It didn't work, Dewey.
We tried. We're different.

363
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,680
You used to say
that was our strength.

364
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,960
- Well--
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

365
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,960
Dewey, you're not just here because
of that second-rate K-Mart...

366
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,960
straight-to-video
version of me, are you?

367
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,360
Brace yourself, Gale.
All of this is actually not about you.

368
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,440
All of what, Dewey?
You do know something, don't you?

369
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,440
- Off the record?
- Always.

370
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,280
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police
got a call from a woman...

371
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,280
who said she was with Stab 3.

372
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,000
She wanted to see the file
on Sid, "for research."

373
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,000
- And?
- The boys said no.

374
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,000
And she wouldn't give her name.

375
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,640
A month later,
the station gets broken into.

376
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,640
- The file room gets ransacked.
- And someone stole Sid's file?

377
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,240
I already removed it.

378
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,560
I think someone on the film
is tryin' to find Sid.

379
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,400
- I'm sorry, this is incredible.
- I said, "off the record."

380
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,880
Right.

381
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,480
It's Jennifer.
She needs me.

382
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,000
-Jennifer?
- Gotta run.

383
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,920
- Wait! Dewey, where are you going?
- I'm on duty.

384
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,640
Stop following me.

385
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,840
I happen to be working
for the police, damn it!

386
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,400
- You're not a detective, Gale.
- Neither are you, Mr Incognito.

387
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,320
- Uh, you left your motor running.
- Damn it.

388
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,720
Fans, I can handle. Fans, they want
a picture, they want a conversation.

389
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,120
I can handle fans!
You see this, Dewey?

390
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,880
I haven't had one ofthese in a year and
a half. Someone's gonna pay for this.

391
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,640
-Jennifer, settle down. What happened?
- I'm with him.
- You.

392
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,160
Like I'm ever going
to win an award playing you.

393
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,280
- There's been a second murder.
- Who?

394
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,280
- Sarah Darling.
- Where?

395
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,760
-At the studio.
-Where? Nancy Drew
wants to know where.

396
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,920
Cotton Weary. Sarah Darling.
Don't you get it?

397
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,600
Someone's killing them in the order
they die in the movie.

398
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,120
- Dewey, who gets killed third?
- Who gets killed third?

399
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,480
You do.

400
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,520
I get killed in Stab 3?
I get killed?

401
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,240
- Yeah.
- Dewey, where are you going?

402
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,760
I have to get something
from my trailer.

403
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,840
Your--
You live here with her?

404
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,680
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

405
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,240
I needed a place to stay,
and she said she liked having me around.

406
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,240
- Why?
- She says I make her feel safe.

407
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,240
- She says I'm her rock.
- Her rock?

408
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,040
Yeah. If you weren't so concerned
with pretensions and appearances...

409
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,960
you'd be able to appreciate the
positivity and emotional centeredness...

410
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,880
I provide a woman.

411
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,920
Stone, I'm headed
to the crime scene.

412
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,480
You stay by Jennifer's side.
I suggest a search of the grounds.

413
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,840
Hey, Dewdrop.
Can I have a word?

414
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,880
Just so it can be straight. I'm
the professional celebrity guard here.

415
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,600
My resume lists Julia Roberts,
Salmon Rushdie, Posh Spice.

416
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,520
You are the Hollywood hanger-oner.

417
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,800
'Cause you're just no good
as a cop any more.

418
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,720
Your resume reads
like the obituaries.

419
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,520
So how about you take suggestions
from me? All right?

420
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,120
Whatever you say.

421
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,840
Hmm. Same deal?
Found with the body?

422
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,160
- Yeah, Maureen Prescott again.
- This is great.

423
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,800
Ten more murders
and we can publish a calendar.

424
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,800
The old "killer playing
with the cops" routine.

425
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,560
Very Hannibal Lecter.
Very Seven.

426
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,160
Doesn't the killer come after
the cops in those movies?

427
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,160
Usually one cop makes it.

428
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,360
- And?
- One cop doesn't.

429
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,360
- Usually.
- Detective Kincaid.

430
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,880
- What do we know? Same killer?
- Hey, hey.

431
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,120
Terminal Entertainment,
this is a crime scene, okay?

432
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,320
Wallace, Miss Weathers
is working with me now.

433
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,200
- Thank you, Detective.
- You're welcome.

434
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,880
Well, in that case, I'm gonna go dust
for fingerprints with Jane Pauley.

435
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,800
Uh, photos, Wallace, please?
Thank you.

436
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,760
New pictures, same person.
Anything turn up on your research yet?

437
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,240
- Nothing that will help with these.
- What about an increased
police presence around Jennifer?

438
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,840
- She's the next one
to get killed in the script.
- She has a bodyguard.

439
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,800
And besides, the producers told us
that there were three different
versions of the script.

440
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,440
Something about trying to keep
the ending off the Internet.
You should know that.

441
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,360
You're the technical advisor, right?

442
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,240
Three versions.
Three different characters die next.

443
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,600
And we don't know which one
the killer read.

444
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,120
Hey, hold up.

445
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,960
All I ever wanted to do
was make a real classic lovestory.

446
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,800
And the studio said they'd let me.
I just had to do
a scary movie for them first.

447
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,080
And now we're shut down,
and I am fucked!

448
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
God, it's not the end
of the world, Roman.

449
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,360
That is so easy foryou to say. You can
always go back to, to MustSee TV.

450
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,840
You know, I have no movie,
I'm about to turn 30, and it
looks like I'm now the next target.

451
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,440
- What?
- You? Why you?

452
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,600
Do you think this wasn't a message?

453
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,200
- Roman Bridger?
- What?

454
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,240
Mr Bridger,
you didn't tell us...

455
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,600
you spoke with Sarah Darling
before she was murdered.

456
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,400
Uh, spoke with her, uh, when?

457
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,600
The guard said she was here
for a meeting with you.

458
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,080
- What meeting? I don't--
- We talked with her roommate too.

459
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,040
Says you called Sarah,
told her to come down to the studio.

460
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,040
- Roommate answered the phone.
Says it was you.
- Wait a minute. No, no.

461
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,040
I-I never called her.
I never told her to go anywhere.

462
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,080
Roommate says she knows
your voice, Mr Bridger.

463
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,400
Well, she wasn't speaking with me! God!
Look, I did not call Sarah Darling.

464
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,600
- Sarah Darling said you did.
- Someone's trying to ruin my movie.

465
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,440
Someone wants to kill
my movie!

466
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,960
All right, we'll talk about
your movie down at the station.

467
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,000
- All right.
- This is the scene
where you come with us.

468
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,240
Dewey,Jennifer--
Wait a minute.

469
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,200
She wasn't talking with me
on the phone. I'm coming!

470
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,040
I'll call him in. Battery. Mr Riley,
do you have a cell phone I can borrow?

471
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,480
Yeah.

472
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,320
- Thank you.
- God. Roman.

473
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,040
Remind me not
to sleep with him again.

474
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,640
Come here, Cherokee.

475
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,160
California Women's Crisis Counseling.
My name is Laura. How can I help you?

476
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,160
Oh, Laura.
I do have a crisis.

477
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,880
Okay, well, whatever it is,
you can tell me.

478
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,480
Oh, my God.
I've killed someone, Laura.

479
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,480
- Are you sure ?
- Uh-huh, I'm sure.

480
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,640
I killed someone, I know it!
Oh, my God.

481
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,160
- Well, then, um--
- I did.

482
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,120
Then the people you need to call
are the police.

483
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,480
No, I need to call you!
Just you.

484
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,480
I'm sorry, your-your voice--

485
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,880
Don't you wanna know
how you can help, Laura?

486
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,280
Are you listening to me?
Huh?

487
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,600
- Who is this?
- It's Mother, Laura.

488
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,280
Now, be a good girl
and turn on the news.

489
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,960
Do as Mother tells you!

490
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,840
You're not my mother. How did you
get this number? Who is this?

491
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,720
You know your mother's voice
when you hear it!

492
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,080
Now, turn on the news!

493
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,640
And with a second cast member
murdered, Stab 3...

494
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,360
has been officially shut down,
prompting those involved...

495
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,640
to hope and pray that
these killings maybe over.

496
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,520
Just one question.

497
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,680
Do you think it's over, Sidney?
Do you?

498
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,080
The sky was dark this morning

499
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,600
Not a bird in a tree

500
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,160
Is this a wrap party
or is this a wrap party?

501
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,040
Scene 34.
"Maureen's Murder Flashback."

502
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,920
- I never liked that scene.
- That's 'cause you weren't in it.

503
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,960
Scenes 40 through 47.

504
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,720
- "The Prescott House Flashbacks."
- Tom, stop it.

505
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,680
You're scaring me.
Two people are dead.

506
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,960
Scaring you?

507
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,400
Give the sweet,
young ingenue act a rest.

508
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,000
- You're drunk.
- I'm coping.

509
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,360
I bet she fought and clawed
for that Sidney part.

510
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,080
I bet she stepped on any poor girl
that got in her way.

511
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,360
- So you asked her out and she said no?
- That has nothing to do with it.

512
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,800
Right.
Come on, Dewey.

513
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,160
Scene 50.

514
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,320
"Dewey Saves the Day."

515
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,720
She's so focused on success
that she never thinks...

516
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,720
about who she's hurting
to get it.

517
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,840
And you saved her life, like,
how many times?

518
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,840
Gale wants the whole world
to love her.

519
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,640
One person's never enough.
She's a dreamer.

520
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,960
-No, she's a narcissistic, psycho bitch.
-No, she's not.

521
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,160
She's got a good heart.
She does.

522
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,480
She just hides it away because
she thinks people see that as weak.

523
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,040
This is a good picture of you.
You look just like her.

524
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,360
God, Dewey.

525
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,520
You make it sound like
you're still in love with her.

526
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,520
And I left out the part
that she's cruel...

527
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:16,520
and selfish,
obsessive and annoying.

528
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,640
We have one Gale Weathers here.
We don't need two.

529
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,640
Hey, Dewdrop,
got your girlfriend out here.

530
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,720
Look who I found slinkin'
around the yard. The nightly news.

531
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,800
I wasn't slinking.
I was walking.

532
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,320
You were eaves dropping
at the bedroom window.

533
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,040
Yeah, a bedroom that
you seemed awfully at home in.

534
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,800
All right, let's talk.

535
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,920
Come on.

536
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,800
- What's this about, Gale?
- Did you know they released Roman?

537
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,720
Sarah's call didn't come
from his cell phone.

538
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,480
- Where did it come from then?
- A cloned cell phone. It's untraceable.

539
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,120
Well, thanks for the update, Gale.
Why don't you just go back home?

540
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,400
Dewey, wait a minute.
Just wait one second.

541
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,120
How old do you think
Maureen Prescott is in this picture?

542
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,760
- Nineteen, twenty.
- That's what I thought,
so I checked it out.

543
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,320
I cannot find any information about
her at this age. I mean, nothing.

544
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,000
She lived in Woodsboro her whole life.
Someone there must know something.

545
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,480
Almost her whole life.
Two years before...

546
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,080
she met Sidney's father,
she left Woodsboro.

547
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,640
No one has any idea
where she went or what she did.

548
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,920
I mean, it's-it's like she fell into
a black hole, Dewey! She vanished!

549
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,920
- So?
- So?

550
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,640
Why is the killer
leaving pictures of-of Maureen?

551
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,400
And why these pictures at-at--
at that point in her life?

552
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,560
I don't know! If I thought
like a homicidal maniac...

553
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,400
then I'd know how
a homicidal maniac thinks.

554
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,160
What?

555
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,640
-Jennifer.
-Jennifer?

556
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,880
Look at the buildings.
The second story. There and there.

557
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,920
It's the same!
It's the same street 28 years ago.

558
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,400
Oh, my God. Maureen Prescott was
at the back lot at Sunrise Studios!

559
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,160
- Oh, my God.
- I gotta make some calls.

560
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,240
Steven Stone
Protection Services.

561
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,240
Stone, where are you?

562
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,920
I'm just checking
your tin can, Dewdrop.

563
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,840
Well, come back inside
and stay with Jennifer.

564
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,080
Something's happened.
I have to go to the police.

565
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,320
Is that an order, Dewdrop? 'Cause
Steven Stone doesn't work for you.

566
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,000
Get back in the house, Stone.
Would I call you if it wasn 't important?

567
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,120
- What are you doing in there anyway?
- Me?

568
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,520
I'm just checking to make sure
there's no killer in here...

569
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,320
waitin' to off you
like he did your little sister.

570
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,360
What did you say?
I can't believe you said that.

571
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,720
That makes me...

572
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,480
angry!

573
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,600
Fucker!

574
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,160
Gotta call Kincaid.

575
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,040
Dewey, where is everybody?

576
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,280
- Oh, God.
-Jennifer?

577
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,840
Angelina?
Tom?

578
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,360
Oh, my God!
What happened?

579
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,880
Don't do that.
I'm overreacting.

580
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,760
Dewdrop?

581
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,120
- Stone?
- Oh, my God!

582
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,600
Oh, God, Stone!

583
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,960
Oh, God!

584
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,160
- Dewey, is he dead?
- Yeah.

585
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,320
Everyone back inside!

586
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,920
It's all right.
Don't panic.

587
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,160
Okay, outside. Everyone,
stay together and try to remain calm.

588
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,160
A phone!

589
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,680
- It's not mine.
- It's not mine.

590
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,440
Shit!
It's the fax.

591
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,640
"Interior, Jennifer's house. Living
room, night." It's a script page.

592
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,600
- W-W-What's it say?
- "With the bodyguard stabbed to death,
the five stand trapped.

593
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,960
- He's rewriting the movie.
- As the killer waits outside...

594
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,080
suddenly the fax machine
sends news of their fates."

595
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,120
It's a trick!
Everybody, outside!

596
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,360
- Outside where he can
pick us off one by one?
- Shut up!

597
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,520
"The killer prepares to grant
mercy to only one of them."

598
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,800
Don't you get it? The killer says he's
outside because he wants us here inside.

599
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,080
- Which one is it?
- Come on!

600
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,240
"Who will survive? Is it Jennifer?
Tom? Angelina? Dewey? Gale?

601
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,880
- The killer will give mercy to--"
- Everyone outside!

602
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,160
He grants mercy to who?
I wanna know what happens!

603
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,840
- I wanna know what happens!
- Wait for the fucking movie!

604
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,840
- I've gotta know! I'm goin' back in!
- No.

605
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,440
All right, everyone, back.
Stay together.

606
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,640
- What's it say?
- "And the...

607
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,800
killer will give mercy to...

608
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,440
- whoever--"
- Whoever?

609
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,960
Whoever?

610
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,760
Piece of shit.

611
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,240
"Whoever--
Whoever smells the--"

612
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,840
I can't stop
rolling down the hill!

613
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,600
Gale!Jennifer!

614
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,560
- Dewey!
- Dewey!

615
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,600
Dewey, where are you?

616
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,440
Over here, Dewey!

617
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,680
- Dewey!
- Gale!

618
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,480
Gale, behind you!

619
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,440
Dewey!
Are you all right?

620
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,600
Yeah, never been better.

621
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,160
Yeah, I'm all right.
Where'd he go?

622
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,600
- He must've rolled under the car.
- All right, stay close.

623
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,640
Is he back there?

624
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,400
- No.
- No?

625
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:02,000
He's fast.
Could've sworn I hit him.

626
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,360
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

627
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,560
Thanks for saving me.

628
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,160
Ah, it's habit.

629
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,160
Oh, God.

630
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,680
What the fuck happened to you?

631
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,160
-Jennifer, wait a minute.
- Who gave you a place to stay?

632
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,520
-Who are you supposed to be protecting?
-Jennifer!

633
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,600
Hey!

634
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,920
My lawyer liked that.

635
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,840
Not as much as I did.

636
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,320
- Angelina?
- Tom was in the house.

637
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,040
- How'd you end up way over there?
- Oh, my God! Tom was in the house!

638
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,400
- Are we safe?
- Safe from who?

639
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,120
Wait a second!

640
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,600
Another picture.

641
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,840
Whoever it is is now taking credit
for Maureen Prescott's murder.

642
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,880
But we know who killed Maureen
Prescott. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.

643
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,240
-I mean, they even told Sidney
how they did it.
- Yeah, but if I'm not mistaken...

644
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,480
you said in your book that
Sidney got it wrong once before.

645
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,200
She accused Cotton Weary
of murdering her mother.

646
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,160
And he was sent away for it.
Maybe there is a third killer.

647
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,240
Sidney might know something.

648
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,760
I told you.
I don't know where Sidney is.

649
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,320
And even if there was a third killer,
Sidney doesn't know about it.

650
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,560
That is for me to decide.
I need to talk to her, Mr. Riley.
She is a key element in this case.

651
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,800
I have a press conference in an hour.
I need to explain...

652
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,240
why there are three dead celebrities
and a bodyguard.

653
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,960
And a very angry mayor.

654
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,960
Okay, look, we all know this has
something to do with Stab 3.

655
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,920
But what we do not know is why
the killer keeps leaving pictures...

656
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,280
of Maureen Prescott
taken over 25 years ago.

657
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,000
And the photographs taken at the same
studio Stab 3 is shooting out of.

658
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,640
What does this
have to do with Sid?

659
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,320
Who knows more about Maureen
Prescott than her own daughter?

660
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,960
Well, Sid's dad couldn't help you,
and he was married to Maureen.

661
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,880
What's your problem?

662
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,320
Last night you were almost charcoal.
You gonna help us or what?

663
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,440
Do you wanna have this
conversation with a polygraph?

664
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,840
- Is that a threat, Detective?
- When it's a threat, you'll know it.

665
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,120
- Was that a threat?
- Boys, boys.

666
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,560
Why don't we compare
our gun calibres later?

667
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,840
- The issue is Maureen Prescott.
- Wrong. The issue is Sidney Prescott.

668
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,640
And either Mr Riley is going
to obstructjustice or he's going
to put me in touch with her.

669
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,880
So, where is she?

670
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,360
Hi, you've reached the machine.
You can leave a message.
Talk as long as you want.

671
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,120
Sid, it's me.
This is the fifth time I've called.

672
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,120
Please pick up.
I wanna make sure you're...

673
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,640
okay.

674
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,640
- Sid!
- Dewey!

675
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,280
What are you doing down here?

676
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,440
Actually, what was I doing up there?

677
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,640
-Jesus, Dewey. Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, I'm all right.

678
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,560
- Is she all right?
- Hey, you know Gale.

679
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,280
It'd take a direct hit.

680
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,640
So the news said this was the precinct.
Who's this guy Kincaid?

681
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,600
Come here.
I told you to stay hidden.

682
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,120
- It's not safe for you to be here.
- The killer called me.

683
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,400
- What?
- Yeah, he found me.

684
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:36,800
I'm no more safe there than I am here,
and at least here I'm not alone.

685
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,760
Okay, come on.

686
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,200
- Detective Kincaid?
- Yeah.

687
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,760
There's someone here
who wants to help.

688
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,400
Oh, my God.
Sidney.

689
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,480
Is the man fast or what?

690
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,880
- Hi.
- Hi, Gale.

691
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,040
- I'm glad you're all right.
- Thank you.

692
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:02,640
- Sid, this is Detective Kincaid.
- Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.

693
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,920
- The killer called her.
- What? When?

694
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,320
- What did he say?
- Oh, you know, the usual small talk.

695
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,720
What's new? How you been?
How do you wanna die?

696
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,720
Sidney, do you have any idea
how he could've gotten your number?

697
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,800
He could have monitored her calls on a
scanner. Did you call her from the set?

698
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,880
- No.
- Do you have her number
stored in your memory?

699
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,960
- Phone memory!
- Oh. Yeah, guess I do.

700
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,920
- Has anyone else ever used your phone?
-Just Jennifer.

701
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,960
And you.

702
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,720
Hey, I'm the cop here.
You're in my office, Riley.

703
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,760
The killer leaves a photograph
after each murder, Sidney.

704
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,840
They were taken in Hollywood at the same
studio that they're shooting Stab 3.

705
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,800
Why didn't you tell me?
This is my mother, Dewey.

706
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,480
- Why didn't you say something?
- I was afraid they were bait.

707
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,600
Something to, you know,
trick you out of hiding.

708
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,240
Sidney, was she an actress or a model?
Because they look a lot
like publicity stills.

709
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,400
I, uh, don't know.

710
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,400
Detective, I wanna see
this place in the pictures.

711
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,880
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

712
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,200
- Slow it down.
- Sorry.

713
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,800
Watch the fuckin' aliens.

714
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,440
I'm gonna go talk to
the studio brass about those photos.

715
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,440
Yeah, right.
I know where you're goin'.

716
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,720
- Yeah, keep an eye on Sidney.
- I know where you're goin'.

717
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,400
You're gonna get her some flowers
and candy, huh? Huh?

718
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,400
- Gimme a break.
- Yeah, gimme a call.

719
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,000
Just keep your eye on her.

720
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,720
That stairwell over there, that's
where one of the pictures was taken.

721
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,440
God. I can't believe
she never mentioned any of this.

722
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,920
- She probably just--
- Dewey!

723
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,640
- Sorry.
- Martha!

724
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,680
- Oh, my God, Sid.
- Hey, hold it right there! Hey!
- Don't shoot!

725
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,960
- I'm only 17.
- It's okay. We know her.

726
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,920
We do?

727
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,080
Tell me that's his ex-girlfriend,
I'll shoot myself.

728
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,720
- It's Martha Meeks, Randy's sister.
- Randy's sister?

729
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,320
- Yeah, can't you tell?
- We miss you in Woodsboro, guys.

730
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:07,000
- Martha, what are you doing here?
- There's something you guys should see.

731
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,000
Told ya I'd make
a movie someday. Huh?

732
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,320
- Oh, my God.
- Well, if you're watching this tape...

733
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,320
it means, as I feared, I did not
survive these killings...

734
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,040
here at Windsor College,
and that giving up my virginity...

735
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,800
to Karen Kolchakat the video store
was probably not a good idea.

736
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,160
- Karen Kolchak?
- Yes, Karen Kolchak.

737
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,800
- "Creepy Karen"?
- Shut up! She's a sweet person, okay?

738
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,440
We were workin'late. We were puttin'
away some videos in the porno section...

739
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,120
and, you know, shit happens.

740
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,440
- Open the door, Randy!
- Fifteen minutes.

741
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,120
- It's my room too!
- Paul,15 minutes.

742
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,000
I'm leaving my legacy.

743
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,880
Fifteen minutes, Paul!
Damn! Anyway...

744
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:51,200
the reason I'm here is to help you so
that my death will not be in vain.

745
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,320
That my life's work will help save some
other poor soul from getting mutilated.

746
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,840
If this killer does come back
and he's for real...

747
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,920
there are a few things
that you gotta remember.

748
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,040
Is this simply another sequel?
Well, if it is, same rules apply.

749
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,520
But here's the critical thing.
If you find yourself dealing...

750
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,960
with an unexpected back-story
and ap reponderance...

751
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,680
of exposition,
then the sequel rules do not apply.

752
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,280
Because you're not dealing with
the sequel. You are dealing with...

753
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,440
the concluding chapter
of a trilogy.

754
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,080
- Trilogy.
- That's right. It's
a rarity in the horror field...

755
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,840
but it does exist, and it is
a force to be reckoned with.

756
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,400
Because true trilogies are all about
going back to the beginning...

757
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,680
and discovering something
that wasn 't true from the get-go.

758
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,320
Godfather, Jedi,
all revealed something...

759
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,680
that we thought was true
that wasn 't true.

760
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,040
So if it is a trilogy
you are dealing with...

761
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,320
here are some super
trilogy rules.

762
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,120
One: You've got a killer
who's gonna be superhuman.

763
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,120
Stabbing him won't work.
Shooting him won't work.

764
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,560
Basically, in the third one, you've
gotta cryogenically freeze his head...

765
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,400
decapitate him or blowhim up.

766
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,440
Number two: Anyone, including
the main character, can die.

767
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,720
This means you, Sid.
I'm sorry. It's the final chapter.

768
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,320
It could be fuckin' Reservoir Dogs
by the time this thing is through.

769
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,200
Number three: The past will
come back to bite you in the ass.

770
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,200
Whatever you think you know
about the past, forget it.

771
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,520
The past is not at rest!
Any sins you think...

772
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,840
were committed in the past are about
to break out and destroy you.

773
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,880
So in closing,
let me say...

774
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,520
goodluck, Godspeed...

775
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,600
and for some of you,
I'll see you soon.

776
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,000
'Cause the rules say some of you
ain't gonna make it. I didn't.

777
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,600
Not if you're watching this tape.

778
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:37,560
Thank you. And you be careful.
Say hi to your folks for me.

779
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,960
You be careful too, Sid.

780
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,640
- Bye, Dewey. Come visit us soon.
- I will, Martha.

781
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,720
- Thank you.
- Bye.

782
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,120
I've got an idea.
I'll hook up with you guys later.

783
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,560
- Do you want us to come with you?
- I work better alone.

784
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,440
Why don't you try to figure out where
those other pictures were taken.

785
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,800
- I can see nothing's changed.
- No.

786
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,880
Oh, shit.

787
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,400
Hello!

788
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,880
-Jeez.
- What the hell are you doing?

789
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,000
Being Gale Weathers.
What the hell are you doing?

790
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,120
- I am Gale Weathers.
- Here's how I see it.

791
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,040
I've got no house, no bodyguard,
no movie, and I'm being stalked.

792
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,360
Because someone wants to kill me?
No, because someone wants to kill you.

793
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,640
So now, starting now,
I go where you go.

794
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,200
That way, if someone wants
to kill me, I'll be with you.

795
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,480
And since they really want to kill you,
they won't kill me, they'll kill you.

796
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,320
- Make sense?
- None.

797
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,360
You know, in the movies,
I play you as being much smarter.

798
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,800
And as a sane person.
Foryou, that must be quite a stretch.

799
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,960
- That's funny.
- Ha!

800
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,960
- Need to get in that building?
- Yeah.

801
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,960
- Is there a story in that building?
- Maybe.

802
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,800
Gale Weathers would find a way.

803
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,920
Bitch. All right, wait.Just--

804
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,280
Don't tell me what to do.

805
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,840
Basements, wow.

806
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,920
Basements creep me out.

807
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:18,520
You'd make
a fascinating interview.

808
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,680
Hello?

809
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,400
Hi. Excuse me.
I am Gale Weathers...

810
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,640
and I'm here researching
with the police this photo.

811
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,160
It was taken at the studio.
Her name is Maureen Prescott.

812
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,120
Back then it was probably Roberts.

813
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,600
- Hey, are you--
- No.

814
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,880
- But you look just--
- Like her?

815
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,360
- I've been hearing it all my life.
- It's uncanny.

816
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,560
I was up for Princess Leia.
I was this close.

817
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,360
So, who gets it?
The one who sleeps with George Lucas.

818
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,120
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up
a-a sore subject for you.

819
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,360
Sure, you didn't.
None of them did.

820
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,800
So, how can I help you? Or do you want
me to tell you who you look like?

821
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,400
How about some information
on Maureen Roberts?

822
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,120
I don't work for the cops, sweetie.
I work for the studio.

823
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:17,120
Really? Well,
would you work for...

824
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,000
the president?

825
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,840
The president of the studio.

826
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:29,240
Fifty dollars? Who are you?
A reporter for Woodsboro High?

827
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,200
It's worth two grand.

828
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,120
Are you gonna help
Gale Weathers or not?

829
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,120
I know every face in here.

830
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,560
I got a respect
for the unknown actor.

831
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:51,960
If they're looking for Maureen Roberts,
they're never gonna find her.

832
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,280
Rina Reynolds they will.

833
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,120
Rina Reynolds.
Stage name.

834
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,880
You should talk,Judy Jurgenstern.

835
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,360
What are these movies?
Amazombies, Space Psycho...

836
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,360
Creatures from the San Andreas Fault.

837
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,600
Horror pictures
back in Milton's heyday.

838
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,840
- Back in what?
- Back in what?
-John Milton.

839
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:20,200
The horror producer?
Those were his movies.

840
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,080
Come on, Sid.

841
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,720
Oh, my God!
Sidney Prescott!

842
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,360
Oh, my God! I'm Angelina Tyler.
I'm you! I mean, I'm not.

843
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,520
I mean, I was.

844
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,680
I-I thought-- Well,
if there's no movie...

845
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,800
then no one would care
if I took some souvenirs.

846
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,920
Souvenirs?

847
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,520
I may never win another role,
so these may be...

848
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,440
my only memories,
you know, of Hollywood.

849
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,960
I-I know it's weird 'cause
it's your life and all, but...

850
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,160
I wanted to make you proud, Sidney.

851
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,320
Oh. Well,
I'm sure I would've been.

852
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,840
The real Sidney.
The real person.

853
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,760
I wish--

854
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,840
I wish it would've worked out.

855
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,360
Hey--

856
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,040
Angelina?

857
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,640
Hello?

858
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,360
Close call.

859
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,400
What are you doing here?

860
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,080
It occurred to me that I've never
snuck through your bedroom window.

861
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,240
See what you do to me?

862
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:08,120
What have I done to you?

863
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,440
About the, uh, sex stuff?

864
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,080
You know, I'm not trying
to rush you at all.

865
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:18,160
Would you settle for
a PG-13 relationship?

866
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,280
Dewey!

867
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,840
Dewey!

868
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,800
Sidney, I'm in here.

869
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,320
Over here.

870
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:46,960
Yes. Mother will protect you
from the bogeyman.

871
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,080
Come into the bedroom.

872
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,840
Hide in Mommy's bed.

873
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,640
I lied, Sidney.

874
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,360
I can't protect you at all.

875
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,360
You don't deserve to be protected!
You didn't protect me!

876
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,960
We did your mom a favour, Sid.
That woman was a slutbag whore...

877
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,320
who flashed her shit all over town
like she was Sharon Stone.

878
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,800
'Cause let's face it, Sidney,
your mother was no Sharon Stone.

879
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,680
- Sidney's mother was fucking my father.
- Sid, where are you?

880
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,000
Dewey!
Dewey, help me!

881
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:22,920
Sidney? Give Mommy a kiss
and we'll make up.

882
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,040
- No!
- Sidney!

883
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,680
Sid!

884
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,840
Sid, are you okay?
What happened?

885
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:40,600
The killer's in the house, Dewey.
He's upstairs.

886
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:45,160
- And my mother--
- Let's go, let's go.

887
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,960
I heard her voice.
I saw her, Dewey.

888
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,000
- Upstairs. Come on, let's go.
- It's okay, Sid.

889
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,280
You weren't supposed
to go in that house.

890
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,360
It's all set up for the murder scene.

891
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,360
- I'm sorry you had to see that.
- He was in there, Dewey.

892
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:01,960
- He was in there, I swear, I swear.
- You know I believe you.

893
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,080
- What happened?
- Kincaid, hey.

894
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:09,440
There's nobody up here.

895
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,880
Come on.

896
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,200
- Come on.
- Okay, so I stole the mask.

897
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,520
Whatever. I didn't know you got
the gas chamber for that.

898
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,240
- You stole the mask?
- I took it.

899
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,480
- You took the mask
or you stole the mask?
- I-I took it as like a souvenir.

900
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,040
- Don't look at me. I didn't take shit.
- I know he was there.

901
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,120
I am not dreaming,
I am not crazy.

902
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,440
- He was there in Woodsboro.
- That's not Woodsboro, Sidney.

903
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:42,080
You know what I mean. But he was there.
He or she, or whoever this is.

904
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,760
We're gonna take you back
to the station, keep you under watch.

905
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,240
Put you in a safe house.
Whatever it takes.

906
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,840
Come on.

907
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,440
It's all right, Sid.
We all believe you.

908
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,200
- He's watching.
- And he wants you.

909
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,720
- Hey, Dew.
- Dew.
- Come on.

910
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,480
- We have to go catch up with Sid.
- Take a look at this first.

911
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,560
- Someone we know?
- Where'd you get this?

912
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,040
- We got it. Archives.
- Sidney's mother was an actress.
Three movies.

913
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:14,640
-Horror movies.
-Wanna know who produced all three?
-Who?

914
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,680
- There'll be other movies, Roman.
- Not only did they--

915
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,760
did they kill the film,
but they killed my cast.

916
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,960
Now, nobody's gonna wanna work
with me. Variety called me a pariah.

917
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,560
I don't even know what a pariah is.
Why-Why couldn't someone
have killed the cast from Stab 1?

918
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,080
Huh? Or Stab 2? Why me?
What--John, what did we do wrong?

919
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,520
Hollywood is full of criminals
whose careers are flourishing.

920
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,880
I'm not a criminal!
I was questioned.

921
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,880
Yeah, but that's all.
I was questioned. That's it.

922
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,840
- That's good foryour mystique.
- You think it will help me get work?

923
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,960
Roman. John.

924
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,000
Jennifer, and guests.
To what do I owe the honour?

925
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,880
- Rina Reynolds.
- Rina Reynolds? Who's Rina Reynolds?

926
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,440
Why don't you head to the house?
Tell everybody not to cut
the cake without me.

927
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,880
- Oh, God, I forgot. Your birthday.
- Yeah.

928
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,760
- Happy birthday, Roman.
- Yeah, as if life isn't tragic enough.

929
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,520
Shut the doors behind you, please.

930
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,600
So, you knew
Sidney Prescott's mother.

931
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:07,920
- Who?
- Rina Reynolds?

932
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:11,200
Do you know how many actors have
worked for me? Hundreds. Thousands.

933
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,600
- He didn't say she was an actor.
- Good catch.

934
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,000
- So what's the point?
- Uh, no point.

935
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,920
I'm just gonna give, uh,
Detective Kincaid a call.

936
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,760
I remember. She was a bit player
in a couple of my movies.

937
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,320
- A nobody. So what does it matter?
- Oh, come on.

938
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,960
You have made millions
off the story of her murder.

939
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,920
You're obsessed with her,
and you're obsessed with her daughter!

940
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,160
All right, easy, Geraldo.
Why don't you tell us the truth?

941
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,240
What the hell are you guys getting at?
I make horror films, that's what I do.

942
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,400
The studio came to me with Stab.

943
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,240
They came to me.
Check it out.

944
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,000
- But you knew who she was.
- When we did the first Stab...

945
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,360
I realized I had known
Maureen Prescott before.

946
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,800
I mean, as Rina.

947
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:56,640
I couldn't tell anyone.
Can you imagine the press?

948
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,120
And now?
I mean, murders on your set.

949
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,600
- And-And still you say nothing?
- Get real.

950
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,120
- That would make me a suspect.
-Just because you knew her?

951
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,560
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.

952
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,400
Just what did happen to Maureen
when she was in Hollywood?

953
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,600
Now, you listen to me, Lois Lane.
Let it go. It's dead and buried.

954
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,920
How would you like to see it
dug up on national TV?

955
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,520
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

956
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,760
It was in the '70s.
Everything was different.

957
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,560
I was well-known for my parties.
Rina knew what they were.

958
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,960
It was for girls like her to meet men.
Men who could get them parts...

959
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,960
if they made
the right impression.

960
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,280
Nothing happened to her
that she didn't invite...

961
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,600
in one way or another
no matter what she said afterwards.

962
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,880
- Are you saying she--
- I'm saying things got out of hand.

963
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,840
Maybe they did take advantage of her.
You know, Maybe the sad truth is...

964
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,480
this is not the city
for innocents.

965
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,520
No charges were brought.
And the bottom line is...

966
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,200
Rina Reynolds
wouldn't play by the rules.

967
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,520
You wanna get ahead in Hollywood?

968
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:04,440
You gotta play the game, or go home.

969
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,280
What do you know
about trilogies?

970
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,760
- You mean, like movie trilogies?
- You seem to like movies, Detective.

971
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,160
Call me Mark, would you? 'Cause
I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.

972
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:23,080
I'll call you Mark when
you catch the killer, Detective.

973
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:27,680
All I know about movie trilogies
is that in the third one...

974
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,600
all bets are off.

975
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,560
- Did you request this case?
- No. They tend to put me...

976
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,560
on the ones that deal
with the business.

977
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,760
I grew up here,
and I know my way around the studios.

978
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,120
Huh.

979
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:44,600
Must be exciting.
Beautiful place, beautiful people.

980
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,440
To me, Hollywood is about death.

981
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,360
Excuse me?

982
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,800
I'm a homicide detective, remember?

983
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,640
And when you see what I see
day in and day out...

984
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,200
the violence
that people do to each other...

985
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,200
you get haunted.

986
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:05,800
I think you know about that.

987
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,640
What do you mean?

988
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,760
I know what it's like
to see ghosts that don't go away.

989
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,080
To be watching a scary movie in
your head, whether you want to or not.

990
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:21,960
Watching it alone.

991
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,200
Ghosts are tough.
You can't shoot ghosts.

992
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:28,120
Can't arrest ghosts.

993
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,640
But the best way to stop being
haunted is to be with people.

994
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,720
You're here, you're not hiding.

995
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:38,720
You've done the right thing,
Miss Prescott.

996
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,280
What did you know about your mother?

997
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,720
I always thought
I had the perfect mom.

998
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,320
Perfect family.

999
01:10:55,240 --> 01:11:00,080
Till I found out I was wrong.
She, um--

1000
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:06,080
She had a secret life, and I tried
to understand that, and, um...

1001
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:11,760
soon as I thought that I had,
more secrets.

1002
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,640
I don't know who my mom was.

1003
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,560
You know who she was to you.

1004
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,360
Here's the deal.
I'm off to search the set.

1005
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,560
I think what you saw is real.
That's the good news.

1006
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,800
- How is that good news?
- Because that means...

1007
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,880
that we're dealing with
an ordinary flesh-and-blood killer.

1008
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:38,400
- And I know how
to handle guys like that.
- Oh, yeah? How?

1009
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,920
Catch him or kill him.

1010
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,640
Hey, Detective.

1011
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,720
What's your favourite
scary movie?

1012
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,280
My life.

1013
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:02,160
Mine too.

1014
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,680
We have to think.
Strategize.

1015
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,560
- Milton's the key to everything.
- He's a pervert, he's not a killer.

1016
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,400
He's gotta be involved somehow.
We should follow him.

1017
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,400
We're gonna go back to the precinct and
we're gonna tell Kincaid and Sidney...

1018
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,600
what we found out.

1019
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:18,040
My Gale would be much more aggressive.
My Gale would suspect everybody.

1020
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:21,880
- My Gale would--
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

1021
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,880
- Riley here.
- Dewey, it's Sidney.
- Hey, Sid.

1022
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,960
- I'm with Gale.
We're on our way to see you.
- No.

1023
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,400
Listen, I'm not at the station.
John Milton called me and said
he had something to tell me.

1024
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,840
Something about my mom.
I'm going to meet him at his house.

1025
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,160
Wait, Sid, I'm not so sure
that's a good idea.

1026
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,120
It's okay. Kincaid's with me.
I've got official big-time...

1027
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,480
L.A.P.D. protection, but
I'd feel better if you were there.

1028
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:46,640
- We're on our way, but still, Sid--
- Thanks.

1029
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,960
- What?
- Looks like we're going
to that party after all.

1030
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,600
Hey, guys. Come on in.
Join the party.

1031
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,640
Yeah, well, actually,
we're here to see Sidney.

1032
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,840
- Really? Sidney's here.
- Where?

1033
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,120
- Where's Sidney?
- She's right there!

1034
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,520
Jesus!
Not "Sidney," Sidney.

1035
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:18,000
- Like I'm "Gale" and she's Gale.
- Sidney Prescott?

1036
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,840
- Yeah.
- No, I'd never invite her here.

1037
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:24,520
- She's on her way.
- Well, the more the merrier.

1038
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:28,320
God, this house is incredible.

1039
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,320
-It's old Hollywood.
-Yeah. Could the dude have more money?

1040
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:34,320
Supposedly, Milton has
a secret screening room...

1041
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,320
that was like the scene
back in the '70s, you know.

1042
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,520
It was, like, drinks and drugs
and girls and movies and shit.

1043
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:43,320
Wow! Wish I could've seen it.

1044
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,360
Big old screening room
shouldn't be too hard to find.

1045
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,360
I'm gonna go--
I'm gonna go check this place out.

1046
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Just one damn minute.
There's a psycho killer on the loose.

1047
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,440
And you want to go traipsing around
this gigantic mansion?

1048
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,920
Have you ever actually seen
the Stab movies? Every time...

1049
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,600
this dude enters a room,
he ends up a goddam shish kebab.

1050
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,720
- I'll go with you, Roman.
- There you go. You guys wanna come?

1051
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:05,720
It'll be okay.
We're gonna stick together.

1052
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:09,320
-You're not stickin'. Wait up.
-We're gonna stay here and wait for Sid.

1053
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:12,560
We'll be right back!

1054
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,720
If-If you were a screening room...

1055
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:19,320
where would you be?

1056
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,920
I bet in the basement.

1057
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:28,920
I don't like basements.

1058
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:34,600
Ooh, it's spooky.

1059
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,160
- Ooh, Weredad.
- Damn, it's dark in here.

1060
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,840
- I loved that movie.
- Forget the movie!
What if Milton's crazy...

1061
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,480
and he's gonna jump outta his screening
room with a sling blade or something?

1062
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:56,080
- He won't.
- You sure about that?

1063
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:03,560
- What's down there?
- Zombies and aliens.

1064
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,120
You know, what you look like
without make-up, Jennifer.

1065
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,360
Jesus. Stop pretending
I wasn't the best you've ever had.

1066
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,960
- Oh, stop pretending I even remember.
- Stop pretending!

1067
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,760
Roman?

1068
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,160
Roman?

1069
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,600
- Any sign of her?
- No.

1070
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:44,000
This is so strange.

1071
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,000
It sure is.

1072
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,160
Dewey, do you have caller I.D.
on your cell phone?

1073
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,920
-Yeah.
-All right, use it and-and press "send."

1074
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,760
What the hell?

1075
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:17,240
What is this thing?

1076
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,840
Is this what he--
What the hell?

1077
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,560
Dewey, he's got our voices.

1078
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,560
He's got Sid.

1079
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,560
He's got us all.

1080
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:33,360
- Oh, my God. We gotta find her.
- Come on.

1081
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,880
All right, take the gun.

1082
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:38,240
Go find Roman and Jennifer.
I'm gonna get the others.

1083
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,840
- Be careful.
- You too.

1084
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:48,480
Tyson! Angelina!
You up there?

1085
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:52,000
- Roman!
- Tyson!

1086
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,360
Angelina!

1087
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,360
Damn it!

1088
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,440
Okay, come on.
We gotta get out of here.

1089
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,680
- Where's Angelina?
- I don't know. She went in here.

1090
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,880
- I came in after her. Now she's gone.
- Great.

1091
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:08,720
- What's wrong?
- Looks like Stab 3
is back in production.

1092
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,440
Roman!

1093
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:17,600
Jennifer!

1094
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,120
Jennifer!

1095
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,600
Roman!

1096
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,200
Jennifer!

1097
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:52,200
Roman?

1098
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,240
- Is he dead?
- Yeah, very.

1099
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:12,400
Dewey! Dewey!

1100
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,520
Dewey?

1101
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,120
Dewey!

1102
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,480
God, I'm sorry.
Jennifer, Gale, look.

1103
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,080
- I found a secret passage.
- Roman's dead.

1104
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,680
- What?
- The killer's here.
- What?
- Come on.

1105
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:32,240
- Let go of me! I'm getting out of here!
- You're not safe alone!

1106
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,240
Listen to me!

1107
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:38,400
I did not fuck that pig Milton
to get a leading role...

1108
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:43,880
just to die here with second-rate
celebrities like you two!

1109
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,800
- Gale! I'm up here.
- Come on.

1110
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,320
- Dewey!
- You guys should get out too.

1111
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:56,400
It's crazy to still be here.

1112
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:05,760
- Wait!
- Come on!

1113
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,480
- Dewey!
- Gale, Jennifer, up here!

1114
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:25,320
Dewey, here.
He got Roman and Angelina too.

1115
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:29,240
- We'll be safer if we
stick together, won't we?
- Of course. Why--

1116
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,000
What's goin' on?
Oh, shit!

1117
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:36,440
- Hey!
- Dewey!

1118
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,280
Dewey!

1119
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,800
No!

1120
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:54,240
Help! Police!
Help! Help!

1121
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:58,520
Police! Help!

1122
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:08,280
Oh, you motherfucker!

1123
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,120
Damn!

1124
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:54,520
Dewey! Dewey!

1125
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:00,680
Behind the mirror, Dewey!

1126
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,640
Gale! Get away! Dewey!

1127
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,960
- Do you hear something?
- Get away from me, you asshole.

1128
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:10,680
- Get away from me! You don't scare me!
- Look, Gale. The mirror's moving.

1129
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:14,120
- Gale! Gale!
- Stand back, Gale.

1130
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:17,360
You can't kill me. I'm the killer
in Stab 3. I'm the killer!

1131
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,680
Gale, cover!

1132
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:25,680
Dewey!

1133
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,800
- Tyson!
- Tyson!

1134
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,800
I'm gonna check down here.
You call for help.

1135
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,160
Okay.

1136
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,320
Tyson!

1137
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,920
- Tyson?
- Any sign of him?

1138
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:51,600
- No.
- All right. I'm gonna check out front.

1139
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:00,440
Dew--

1140
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:26,600
Gale!

1141
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:31,200
Gale!

1142
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,080
Gale!

1143
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:38,160
- Dewey?
- Gale!

1144
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,840
Gale!

1145
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:48,680
- Who is this?
- Dewey, it's me.

1146
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:51,680
Gale, where are you?

1147
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,200
I'm in the basement.
I'm trapped.

1148
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:58,040
- Where?
- There's a door in the kitchen.

1149
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,480
Hurry.

1150
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:08,320
Wait. How do I know this is
you, Gale, and not the killer?

1151
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,800
Dewey, open the fucking door.
It's me.

1152
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,600
Well, don't you think that's
what the killer would say?

1153
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:21,000
Come on. He's out cold
at the bottom of the stairs.

1154
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:25,200
Hey!

1155
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:40,080
Dewey. Dewey.

1156
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,640
All right, all right.
It's pizza, not a party.

1157
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:55,120
Everybody get back to work.
Anybody seen my fuckin' partner?

1158
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:58,720
Hey, Morgan,
what did you pay?

1159
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:47,680
- Hello?
- Hello?

1160
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,240
- Who is this?
- Who is this?

1161
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:55,360
- Um, w-who's calling?
- Um, w-who's calling?

1162
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:00,640
Gale, Dewey, whoever, um, call me back.
I can only hear myself.

1163
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:05,240
I only hear you too, Sidney.

1164
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,560
- Who is this?
- The question isn't who I am.

1165
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:12,360
The question is:
Who's with me?

1166
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,360
- Sidney, stay away!
- Sidney!

1167
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,800
Don't do it. If you do one thing
to attract attention to yourself...

1168
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,600
one thing,
I'll kill them both.

1169
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:26,080
Now, do you have somewhere
we can be alone?

1170
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:30,440
- Yes.
- Yeah. Go there.

1171
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,080
Oh, it's hard being friends
with you, Sidney.

1172
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:41,160
When you're friends with Sidney,
you die.

1173
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:45,520
Well, these friends don't have to,
Sidney. It's up to you.

1174
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,600
- How do I know their voices are--
- Are real?

1175
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,680
How do you know
you're not hearing things?

1176
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:54,840
How do you know I'm not someone
in your head? Somewhere you know.

1177
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,360
- Don't come here, Sidney!
- Dewey!

1178
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,560
- Or do you?
- You're dead.

1179
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,960
I don't want them.
I want you.

1180
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,680
It's simple.
You show yourself, they survive.

1181
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,200
- You run, they die.
- Oh, God!

1182
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:12,160
Don't you wanna know, Sidney,
who killed her?

1183
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,600
Don't you wanna know
who killed your mother?

1184
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,600
- Have you seen Kincaid?
- Yeah, I saw him go out.

1185
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,440
- Wallace is still lookin' for him.
- Where?

1186
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:23,480
She'd have been so happy, Sidney,
to know we'd be together.

1187
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:28,800
- Where?
- I'll call you when you're on your way.

1188
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:35,200
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1189
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:43,560
Holy shit.

1190
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,640
- What?
- You follow directions well, Sidney.

1191
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,840
Now, welcome to the final act.

1192
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,560
See that metal detector?

1193
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,560
Use it.

1194
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:09,640
All over, Sidney.
Everywhere.

1195
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:17,760
Everywhere.
The other leg too.

1196
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,920
Show it to me.

1197
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:31,200
Throw it in the pool.

1198
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,600
Now, come inside, Sidney.

1199
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:37,520
No fucking way. How do I know
they're not dead already?

1200
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:40,840
They're right inside,
waiting for you.

1201
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:44,440
Look for yourself.

1202
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:58,920
Now that we're all here,
the party can begin.

1203
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:02,280
- Dewey.
- Sid.

1204
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:05,280
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1205
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:09,280
He's right there!

1206
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,200
Oh, shit.

1207
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,040
Think again.

1208
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:22,040
It's your turn to scream, asshole.

1209
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:28,040
Yeah!

1210
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,200
- It's okay.Just give me a second.
- Okay.

1211
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:39,280
- Hurry, Sid.
- Sidney? Sidney?

1212
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:44,280
Where is he?

1213
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:49,400
Be careful!

1214
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:58,160
I heard shots. Tyson's dead.
What's goin' on?

1215
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,840
- What're you doin' here, Kincaid?
- Lookin' for you.

1216
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:03,960
Tyson said there was a party here
tonight, and I thought, uh-oh.

1217
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,040
Third act celebration.
Thought I better check it out.

1218
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:10,040
Alone?
Where's your partner?

1219
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:15,000
Hey, Miss Prescott.

1220
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:19,760
I'm here to help.
Put the gun down.

1221
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:23,920
Put the gun down.

1222
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:30,520
No!

1223
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:38,120
Sid! Wake up, Sid!
Sid, come on!

1224
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:42,080
- Wake up!
- Sidney!

1225
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,520
Sid, shoot him! Sid!

1226
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:48,320
Shoot the fucker!

1227
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,760
Shoot him!

1228
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,640
You want me, motherfucker?
Come and get me.

1229
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:02,960
Run!

1230
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,440
Sid.

1231
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:53,920
Sid.

1232
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:59,520
Come in here, please.

1233
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:04,160
It's just me, Sid.

1234
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:07,960
Oh, I was so pretty.

1235
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:11,320
Everybody loved me.

1236
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:15,840
Have you missed me, Sidney?

1237
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:21,840
Would you like to hold me
one last time?

1238
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,800
What's the matter?
What are you staring at?

1239
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:30,800
Don't you remember your mother?

1240
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:42,200
You're not going anywhere, Sidney.

1241
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:48,040
It's time you came to terms
with me and with Mother.

1242
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:51,600
Maybe you never
knew her at all, Sidney.

1243
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:56,600
Maybe you just can't get past
the surface of things.

1244
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:00,360
- Who the hell are you?
- The other half of you.

1245
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:04,360
I searched for a mother too,
an actress named Rina Reynolds.

1246
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,400
Tried to find her my whole life.

1247
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:09,320
And four years ago,
I actually tracked her down.

1248
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:12,560
Knocked at her door, thinking
she'd welcome me with open arms.

1249
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:17,000
But she had a new life
and a new name: Maureen Prescott.

1250
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,040
You were the only child
she claimed, Sidney.

1251
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:22,000
She shut me out
in the cold forever.

1252
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:26,160
Her own son.

1253
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:34,920
Roman Bridger, director.
And brother.

1254
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:37,600
She slammed the door in my face, Sid.
She said I was Rina's child...

1255
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,840
and Rina was dead.

1256
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:41,920
And it struck me.

1257
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:45,200
What a good idea!
So I watched her.

1258
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:49,160
I made a little home movie.
A little-little family film.

1259
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:52,200
It seems Maureen--
Mom--

1260
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:56,240
She really got around.
I mean, Cotton was one thing.

1261
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,440
Everybody knew about that.

1262
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:03,040
But Billy's father?
That was the key.

1263
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,160
Your boyfriend didn't like seeing
his daddy in my film too much.

1264
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:07,440
He didn't like it at all.

1265
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:11,640
But once I supplied the motivation,
all the kid needed was a few pointers.

1266
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:14,960
Have a partner to sell out in case
you get caught, find someone to frame.

1267
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,400
It was like
he was making a movie.

1268
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:21,960
You. This is all because ofyou.

1269
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:25,480
I'm a director, Sid.

1270
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:27,880
- I direct.
- Oh.

1271
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:32,800
I had no idea that they were
gonna make a film of their own.

1272
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:37,160
- Oh, shit.
- What a film it turned out to be, huh?

1273
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:40,080
I mean, introducing Sidney,
the victim.

1274
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:45,080
Sidney, the survivor.
Sidney, the star!

1275
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,800
All right. You're gonna be all right.
Just apply pressure.

1276
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,200
Here, take this.
Get the son ofa bitch.

1277
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,880
Let's go.

1278
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:07,840
Fine, you got what you wanted,
hero and villain face-to-face.

1279
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,640
- Well, you know what happens now?
The villain dies!
- Exactly!

1280
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:14,960
But I'm not the villain, Sid.
You are.

1281
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:19,440
Here he is, the man who gave away
your mother's innocence.

1282
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,920
Huh? What he did
to her made her a slut.

1283
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:26,200
Didn't it? Huh? She never recovered from
that night, right here in this room.

1284
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:29,760
They fucked her three ways from Sunday.
Ruined her life.

1285
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,600
Ruined yours too,
didn't it, Sid?

1286
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,120
You hate him, Sid?

1287
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:39,720
Come on, I know you do.
I'm sure you do.

1288
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:42,160
I know who you are.
I know what happened to my mother.

1289
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:45,080
And I want you to understand,
I'm gonna make you pay!

1290
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,080
That's what the police are gonna
find on Milton's answering machine...

1291
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:50,720
right next to his lifeless,
mutilated corpse.

1292
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:53,000
- What? Can't hear ya.
- You don't have to do this, Roman.

1293
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,040
Just tell me what you want.
I can make it happen.

1294
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,120
Any picture.
Name your budget. Script approval.

1295
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,360
- Final cut!
- I already have it.

1296
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:02,800
No!

1297
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:05,240
God! You spineless bastard!

1298
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:08,200
No, Sid, that would be you.
You did it all.

1299
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:12,200
You did it, you called them all.
Even your closest friends.

1300
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,720
Living in total isolation, the pressure
ofanother movie about you...

1301
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,840
the discovery that Milton
destroyed Mommy dearest...

1302
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:21,040
you finally just snapped!

1303
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:25,480
One, two, three!

1304
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:30,000
And who's our hero, huh?
The sole survivor. Who's the one...

1305
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:33,880
who bravely faced down the psychopath
and killed her with her own knife?

1306
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,240
You're gonna pay for the life
you stole from me, Sid.

1307
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:40,040
For the mother, and for the family,
and for the stardom and--

1308
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:42,320
Goddam it! Everything you have
that should've been mine!

1309
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,440
God! Why don't you stop your whining
and get on with it?
I've heard this shit before!

1310
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:47,800
- Stop!
- You know why you kill people,
Roman? Do you?

1311
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,880
- I don't wanna hear it!
- Because you choose to!
There is no one else to blame!

1312
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:54,200
- Stop it! Fucking damn it!
- Why don't you take
some fucking responsibility?

1313
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:58,120
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1314
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:12,720
Sid? Sidney?

1315
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:23,280
Sidney?

1316
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:33,000
Sidney!

1317
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:47,960
Sidney!

1318
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:53,000
Leave her alone!

1319
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:05,480
Dewey, do something!

1320
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:12,720
- Stand back!
- Dewey!

1321
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:19,440
Sid! Sid.

1322
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:45,560
Sid?

1323
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:51,440
Where is he?

1324
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:06,800
Hey. Lose something?

1325
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:10,240
Found something.

1326
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:35,240
There's gotta be another way in there!
Come on!

1327
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:44,400
You hurt her,
I swear I'll kill you!

1328
01:39:56,480 --> 01:40:00,560
-Dewey!
-Down this way. There's another hallway.

1329
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,240
There's another door down here.

1330
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,960
- This thing's not budging.
- Look around for something heavy.

1331
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:26,200
- Go that way.
- Okay!

1332
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:53,280
I shot you.

1333
01:40:56,840 --> 01:41:01,280
I guess we think alike.

1334
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:03,920
Mother's dead.

1335
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:07,520
And there is nothing
you can do about that.

1336
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:10,760
I still got
to make my movie.

1337
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,840
Stab 3, right?

1338
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:34,120
Kincaid, hang in there.

1339
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:39,200
Roman? It was Roman?

1340
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:06,680
Be careful, Sid. Randy said
the killer's always superhuman.

1341
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:11,600
Yeah, well,
he wasn't superhuman, Dewey.

1342
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:15,440
He wasn't superhuman at all.

1343
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,320
- You can't fuckin' kill me!
- Head!

1344
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:23,720
- Head! Head, Dewey!
- What?

1345
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:27,480
Head!
Shoot him in the head.

1346
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:40,440
Thanks.

1347
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:44,040
No problem.

1348
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,360
Look.

1349
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:12,640
Come on, Cherokee.
Come on.

1350
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:17,400
- Yeah, she's doin' great.
- Yeah.

1351
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:24,280
Look.

1352
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,440
What are you doing with that?

1353
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:30,240
Um, will you sign it
for me, Gale?

1354
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,640
You hate that book.

1355
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,880
Besides, I'm-l'm done
with that kind of reporting.

1356
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:41,280
For me.
Will you sign it for me?

1357
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:45,200
You're a nut.

1358
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:48,400
Okay.

1359
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:00,880
- Will you?
- Dewey.

1360
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:04,480
I know it'll never work,
and you know it'll never work.

1361
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:11,720
But what I'm asking is
just to see ifwe're wrong.

1362
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:15,800
We don't know everything, Gale.

1363
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:21,320
I mean, you thinkyou do, but--

1364
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,400
You're a brave man,
Dewey Riley.

1365
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:34,800
I'm really scared right now.

1366
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:19,320
Inside.

1367
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:26,600
Sid, we've been waiting for you.
We're gonna start a movie.

1368
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:32,920
- What kind of movie?
- You have to come and see.

1369
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,560
Take a little walk
to the edge of town

1370
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:07,400
Now, spread your wings and fly

1371
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:11,440
Don't the lights of the city
look so damn pretty

1372
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:15,720
When you're flyin' so high

1373
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:19,320
It's hard to know
about there down below

1374
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:24,280
The streets fade
They're swimmin'deep in blood

1375
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:31,120
It seems to make me
groan and cry

1376
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:34,920
You really wanna know
what's wrong with this land

1377
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:40,600
Just scratch your head
with your red right hand

1378
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:46,400
I'm talkin'about blood, babe

1379
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:50,440
It's in your veins

1380
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:54,120
Your mommy and daddy

1381
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:57,880
They've got the same

1382
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:04,040
You're under the mirror
day after day

1383
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:07,840
You see a pretty face
crumblin' away

1384
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:14,840
As you become
your mom and daddy

1385
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:19,280
Scream once, scream twice
Now scream again

1386
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:25,280
Cover that face
with your red right hand

1387
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:41,120
So, is this the end

1388
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:45,960
Forus, my friend

1389
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:53,360
So, is this the end

1390
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:58,840
Forus, my friend

1391
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:05,640
So, is this the end

1392
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:11,120
Forus, my friend

1393
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:33,800
Well as though we rise

1394
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:39,360
As the day breaks the dawn

1395
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:46,120
And as the moon hides the sun

1396
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:50,120
Oh, the sun

1397
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:57,680
No more sorrow

1398
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:04,040
All those crying days are gone

1399
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:07,520
No more sorrow

1400
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:10,440
Now it'sgone

1401
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:13,560
Now it'sgone

1402
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:17,800
Now it'sgone

1403
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:25,640
So, is this the end

1404
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:32,200
Forus, my friend

1405
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:39,240
Spoke to my god today
Asked him why he'd gone away

1406
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:43,360
Hitched on a rocket ride
into the sun

1407
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:47,680
Said, son I got one for ya
Down there in California

1408
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:51,880
Just take a look around
at all you've done

1409
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:55,120
You're automatic
like a burnin' gun

1410
01:49:55,360 --> 01:50:00,280
You're a star like everyone

1411
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:04,520
Talked to my soul today
Couldn't keep my brain away

1412
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:08,680
So I found a holiday
behind the sun

1413
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:12,960
Took all the friends I could
Spun out in Hollywood

1414
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:17,200
Hit up on a climate everyone

1415
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:20,440
You're automatic
like a burnin' gun

1416
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:25,840
You're a star like everyone

1417
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:30,440
You could save the world

1418
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:34,920
Could be shining on my pearl

1419
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:39,040
You could save the world

1420
