 [Episode 8]

3
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:11,399
 Don't you think about the person that
 makes food and waits for you at home?

4
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:14,399
 I'm sorry.

5
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:16,399
 Let's go.

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:17,399
 Okay.

7
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:42,399
 You don't even think about the
 people waiting at home for you.

8
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,399
 You're just busy minding
 your own business.

9
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,399
 Where did my cellphone go?

10
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,399
 Look at that forgetfulness.

11
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:10,399
 Hello?

12
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:11,775
 - Yes.
 - Oh my. President.

13
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:15,399
 Looks like I left my
 cellphone in your car.

14
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:16,399
 Yes, you did.

15
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:18,399
 Choon Hee, the mister said to eat.

16
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:20,399
 Hey! What are you doing?

17
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:23,399
 You came back late, and now
 you're making calls again?

18
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:27,399
 President, are you far away?

19
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:29,399
 If you haven't gone
 too far, I'll come get it.

20
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:33,399
 I'm sorry, but I'm already
 pretty far from your house.

21
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:35,399
 I'll give you your phone tomorrow.

22
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,399
 Okay. Please take care
 on your way home.

23
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,399
 Hurry up and eat.

24
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,399
 I ate already.

25
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:50,399
 What?

26
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,399
 You made people wait, and
 then you eat on your own?

27
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:57,399
 I'm sorry.

28
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,399
 What did you make?

29
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,399
 Can I taste some of it?

30
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:08,399
 Do whatever you want.

31
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:15,399
 Jang Joon Hyun.

32
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:19,399
 I can't bear it.
 I must eat some.

33
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:20,399
 Give me some rice.

34
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:21,399
 Is that so?

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,399
 <i>How can you hit so hard?

36
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,399
 <i>- You smiled right?
 - No, but...

37
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:59,399
 This time...

38
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,399
 it hurts a bit.

39
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:18,399
 It grew so much!

40
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,399
 Our teacher said she would
 give rewards to students

41
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:22,399
 who wrote a good plant
 observation diary.

42
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:24,399
 I can taste it, right?

43
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:30,399
 It really tastes like lettuce.

44
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:31,399
 Wow! It's amazing.

45
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:36,399
 You're really coming down.

46
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,399
 Does it hurt a lot?

47
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:39,399
 Stop. Stop!

48
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:45,399
 Hello, President.

49
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:47,399
 This.

50
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:49,399
 Thank you.

51
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,399
 I can't just give it back to you.

52
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:58,399
 I want to eat dinner
 at your place today.

53
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:00,399
 It's been a long time since
 I've had homemade food.

54
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:04,399
 Then I'll assume you invited me and go.

55
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,399
 See you later.

56
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:10,399
 That... That...

57
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:12,399
 What's up with that bastard?

58
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:14,399
 He thinks everything is about him.

59
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:17,399
 Why does that bastard have
 your cellphone though?

60
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,399
 Well, it just happened like that.

61
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,399
 Were you with that bastard yesterday?

62
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,399
 You're not really going to
 let him into the house, right?

63
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:36,399
 Hey, you could have just
 told him to not come.

64
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,399
 Why are you in a hurry now?

65
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,399
 How could I say no to him?

66
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,399
 Oh my. When am I going
 to clean all of this?

67
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,399
 You don't have to clean carefully.

68
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,399
 Nobody important is coming.

69
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:50,399
 Hey, I'll give you this so please
 go buy some groceries.

70
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,399
 What?

71
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,399
 By the way, there's lettuce
 in front of the house, right?

72
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,399
 Pick the lettuce and bring it as well.

73
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,399
 Are you crazy?

74
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:58,399
 I don't know about other things,
 but you can't touch that lettuce.

75
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,399
 Go and hurry back.

76
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,399
 - Oh my.
 - It's hot.

77
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,399
 - You're back?
 - I'm so tired.

78
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,399
 Good job.

79
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,399
 - What are you doing?
 - What?

80
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,399
 - Stay outside.
 - Where should I go?

81
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:16,567
 The President is coming. He'll get
 the wrong idea if he sees you.

82
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,525
 What wrong ideas?

83
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,399
 Come back two hours later.

84
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:19,942
 Two hours?

85
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,399
 There. Come back later.

86
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,399
 Where is the mister going?

87
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,399
 There's going to be a guest today.

88
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,399
 Oh, right. Byul, help me clean up.

89
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,399
 I'm going crazy because
 of that President.

90
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,399
 Where should I spend
 two hours for though?

91
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,399
 <i>I told you the cabinet above
 the sink is dangerous.

92
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,399
 <i>Be careful.

93
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,399
 No!

94
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,399
 What's dangerous is not the
 cabinet but you, you bastard!

95
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:50,399
 Looks like you're really
 good at cooking as well.

96
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,399
 - Normally the mister...
 - Byul, enjoy your food.

97
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,399
 It's a relief that you
 think it tastes good.

98
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,399
 There's not a lot of
 dishes, but please enjoy.

99
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:05,399
 I always eat alone. It tastes
 good when eating with others.

100
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,399
 Of course! Come every day.

101
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,399
 - I would love that of course.
 - Hey. Hey.

102
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,399
 But your sister says I can't.

103
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,399
 Actually I asked your
 sister to date me yesterday

104
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,399
 and I got rejected.

105
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,399
 Could you help me perhaps?

106
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,399
 Okay! How should I help you?

107
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,399
 Byul, don't say useless things.
 Let's eat the beans. Beans...

108
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,399
 Sister, do you not like the President?

109
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,399
 I like him.

110
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,399
 Byul.

111
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,399
 Byul.

112
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,399
 Who is it?

113
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,399
 <i>What? What?

114
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,399
 Something smells yummy.

115
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,399
 Hey, what brought you here?

116
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,399
 How can I not come when
 there's yummy food?

117
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,399
 How did you know about that?

118
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,399
 - Joon Hyun!
 - Hello.

119
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,399
 - The President is here as well.
 - Yes, Mr. Jang Joon Hyun.

120
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,650
 Wow! It's meat!

121
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,399
 I love meat.

122
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,399
 Excuse me, President.
 Drink with this cup please.

123
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,399
 Yes.

124
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,399
 Why do I like lettuce so much recently?

125
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,399
 Have some stew please.

126
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,399
 Just eating plain rice is delicious.

127
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,399
 Yes. Thank you.

128
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,399
 Yummy.

129
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,399
 I ate meat and then fruit.
 I'm so full today.

130
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,399
 Are you not leaving immediately?

131
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,399
 Why should I?

132
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,399
 Are you really going to act like this?

133
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,399
 It's really been a long time since
 I had a meal as tasty as today's.

134
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,399
 Yes.

135
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,399
 Isn't it too much for
 just returning a cellphone?

136
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,399
 At least he knows.

137
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,399
 No. We're really grateful that
 you enjoyed your meal.

138
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,399
 I should have treated you earlier.

139
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,399
 Then I'll be leaving.

140
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,399
 Yes.

141
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,399
 Oh my.

142
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,399
 Are you not leaving,
 Mr. Jang Joon Hyun?

143
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,399
 Me?

144
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,399
 Please take care on your way home.

145
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,399
 - I enjoyed dinner.
 - Yes.

146
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,399
 - Little miss, goodbye.
 - Goodbye.

147
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,399
 Excuse me.

148
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,399
 I'm saying this because I'm worried.

149
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,399
 Don't come here often.

150
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,399
 It doesn't look good
 for the company's

151
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,399
 President to be visiting
 a singer's home.

152
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,399
 What should I do?

153
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,399
 I plan on coming here
 often in the future.

154
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,399
 What?

155
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,399
 I like eating food that
 Miss Choi Choon Hee made.

156
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,399
 Sorry?

157
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,399
 Also, I didn't come as President
 of the entertainment company today.

158
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,525
 What does that mean?

159
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:16,399
 You know.

160
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:21,399
 - Then...
 - Yes.

161
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,399
 I like Miss Choi Choon Hee.

162
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,399
 Exactly what's happening between them?

163
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,399
 Then it's a love triangle?

164
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,399
 Hey. How can you show up
 suddenly like that?

165
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,399
 I was completely surprised.

166
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,399

 Hey.

172
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,399
 He likes Choi Choon Hee?

173
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,399
 You.

174

 That's right. You.

 You've been weird since yesterday.

 What?

187

 You...

 I'm sorry. Gosh.

 You've become popular with
 your trot remake album recently.

200
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,399
 How is it? Don't you need experience
 dating to sing love songs?

201
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,359
 I've always been busy training,
 so I haven't ever dated.

202

 Training?

203
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,399
 Yes. I used to be a marathon runner.

 Wow! Your experience is really unique.

205

 Then what are your strong points?

 Strong points...

207
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,399
 Since I did a lot of sports,
 my body is pretty strong.

 It's over. It's over.

 Why would you mention
 your body is strong?

210

 This is the car Miss Choi Choon Hee
 is going to use from now on.

211
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,399
 I don't need such a nice car.

212

 What do you mean you
 don't need it?

213
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,399
 Of course the company
 should give you a car.

214
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,399

 and earn more money.

 Why aren't you wearing the scarf?

222
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:16,399
 I told you to protect your
 throat so many times.

 the AC on a hot day like this.

226
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,399
 Then wear the scarf like
 this immediately. Okay?

227
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,399
 Okay.

228
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,399
 Don't drink coffee.
 It's not good for your throat.

229
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:34,399
 - Drink water.
 - I'll get sleepy while I'm driving.

332
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:05,399
 Her song ranked third on
 The Music Trend a while ago.

333
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:07,399
 You haven't forgotten, right?

334
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:11,399
 If Choi Choon Hee ranks first, you're
 releasing a comeback album for me.

335
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,109
 It's around here.

336
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:19,399
 <i>Let's meet at the Korean
 sausage restaurant at four.

337
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:20,399
 <i>From God of Trot.

338
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:29,399
 Welcome, dear customer.

339
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:36,399
 Excuse me.

340
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,399
 Yes, dear customer.

341
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:41,399
 Do you not recognize me?

342
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:44,399
 I-I'm not sure, dear customer.

343
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:47,399
 Are you here to eat Korean sausage?

344
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:50,399
 Yes, yes.

345
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:53,399
 - Wait one moment.
 - Yes.

346
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:55,399
 Awesome. Awesome!

347
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:00,399
 Why did that woman come here?

348
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:05,399
 Hello?

349
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:06,399
 Hello.

350
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:07,399
 Mr. God of Trot?

351
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:10,399
 Miss Ballad, Miss Ballad.
 How far are you?

352
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:12,399
 It's not about that.

353
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:16,399
 I just met my destined companion.

354
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:19,399
 I think we'll need to push back our
 meeting to another time. Is that okay?

355
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:22,399
 Well, that can't be helped.

356
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:24,399
 You met your destined companion.

357
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:25,399
 I have to give way to him.

358
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:27,399
 In return, you must do well today.

359
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:28,399
 Fighting!

360
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:31,399
 Fighting.

361
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:38,775
 No way...

362
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:43,399
 Mr. God of Trot?

363
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:48,399
 Then... Miss Goddess of Ballad?

364
00:23:57,399 --> 00:23:59,399
 What an unbelievable situation.

365
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:03,399
 It's okay to rest when
 you're feeling down.

366
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:05,399
 What is this?

367
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:07,399
 Go with the new President.

368
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:08,399
 Those tickets are hard to get.

369
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,399
 What is it?

370
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:30,399
 I'm hot.

371
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:32,399
 What about the fan?

372
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:34,399
 We're doing well recently.

373
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:36,399
 Let's buy another fan.

374
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:37,399
 We don't have money for that.

375
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:39,399
 - Hand it over.
 - I can't sleep. It's too hot.

376
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:40,399
 Why can't you sleep?

377
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:42,399
 - Why?
 - Then what about my Byul?

378
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,399
 Why are you cheating and
 talking about Byul?

379
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,399
 Give it to me.

380
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,399
 - Give it to me.
 - Give it to me.

381
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:20,399
 Did you come to see me?

382
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:22,399
 Yes.

383
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:27,692
 Do you want to go watch
 an opera with me tonight?

384
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,399
 I got two tickets.

385
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:31,399
 I heard these tickets are hard to get.

386
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:33,399
 I'm sorry

387
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,399
 but can we go next time?

388
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:37,399
 I need to go somewhere right now.

389
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:38,399
 Yes.

390
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:40,399
 - I'm sorry.
 - It's okay.

391
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:52,399
 Did you ask for me, President?

392
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:53,399
 Get in.

393
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:56,399
 - Why? Did something happen?
 - You'll know after you get there.

394
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:57,399
 Why?

395
00:25:58,399 --> 00:25:59,399
 Get in.

396
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:00,399
 Get in?

397
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:13,399
 Where are we going right now?

398
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:15,734
 My friend asked me to bring you
 so he can treat you.

399
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:16,399
 Huh?

400
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:21,399
 I told him about you, and
 he's super curious about you.

401
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:22,399
 Is it okay?

402
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:24,859
 I-I... That...

403
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:33,399
 <i>[Jang Joon Hyun]

404
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:36,399
 Are you not going to pick up?

405
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,399
 Hello?

406
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:45,399
 Where are you right now?

407
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:46,399
 You're still in the
 practice room, right?

408
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:47,399
 Yes.

409
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:50,399
 Well... Of course.

410
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:52,692
 - Why?
 - I'm going to pick you up.

411
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:55,399
 You?

412
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:57,399
 I practiced driving.

413
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:58,399
 Therefore I can go pick you up.

414
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:01,399
 N-No. You don't need to come.

415
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:03,399
 Why?

416
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:05,399
 I'm on the road in
 front of the company.

417
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:06,399
 - I'll arrive soon.
 - Don't come!

418
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:09,399
 I have an appointment.

419
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:11,399
 Appointment?

420
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:12,399
 You didn't say anything about that.

421
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:15,399
 It suddenly came up.
 I'll call you later.

422
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,609
 H-Hello?

423
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,399
 What appointment suddenly came up?

424
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:29,399
 Today is the first time
 I've driven alone.

425
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,399
 Don't come if you don't want to.

426
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:37,399
 Your friend lives here?

427
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:38,399
 Probably.

428
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,399
 Dal Bong, have you been well?

429
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:44,399
 I told you about my friend Dal Bong.
 He's my best friend.

430
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,399
 Then the friend you
 were talking about...

431
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,399
 That was you.

432
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,399
 Hello. Nice to meet you.

433
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:56,399
 He's so pretty.

434
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,399
 How old is he?

435
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,399
 He's 20 this year so that's like
 50 years old for humans.

436
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,399
 50?

437
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:05,399
 Now, don't stare at the horse's ears.

438
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:07,399
 Look far ahead.

439
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:08,399
 Do you want to try riding him?

440
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,399
 - Me? He's moving! He's moving!
 - That's right.

441
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,399
 You're good at riding horses.

442
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,399
 Now try riding him on your own.

443
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:17,399
 On my own?

444
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:18,399
 I'm scared.

445
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,399
 Well, isn't life something you
 have to live on your own?

446
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,399
 Well, I'll be next...

447
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:26,399
 I'll be next to you.

448
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,399
 Dal Bong seems to be really gentle.

449
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:38,399
 It was so hard to train
 him to be this gentle.

450
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,399
 We went between heaven and
 hell at least 10 times.

451
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:42,399
 Really?

452
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,399
 He doesn't look like that.

453
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:47,399
 Do you know what's the most effective
 way to make a hurt heart open up?

454
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,399
 It's to wait.

455
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:59,399
 At first it felt novel.

456
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:02,399
 After spending some time
 together, it was fun

457
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,399
 and I wanted to get closer with him.

458
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,399
 At first I stayed by
 his side because it was interesting.

459
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:11,399
 Later on, I just wanted
 to be there for him.

460
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,399
 Then this guy...

461
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:21,399
 That's when I realized that

462
00:29:22,525 --> 00:29:25,399
 if I keep waiting

463
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,399
 then one day I'll win that heart.

464
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:42,399
 This is why I like you.

465
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,399
 You're always so lively.

466
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:47,399
 - Let's go.
 - Oh my.

467
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:50,399
 Did Dal Bong hear my belly
 make noise as well?

468
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:53,399
 Thank you.

469
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,399
 Does it taste good?

470
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:09,399
 Yes, it tastes good.

471
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:11,399
 Horse meat always tastes good.

472
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:17,399
 Dal Bong.

473
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,399
 Thank you.

474
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,399
 You're so innocent Miss Choi Choon Hee.

475
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,399
 Would I do that to Dal Bong?

476
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:39,399
 I almost couldn't eat.

477
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:40,399
 Enjoy.

478
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,399
 Yes.

479
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:47,399
 I asked them to pack up
 some for the little miss as well

480
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:49,399
 so take it when you leave.

481
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:51,399
 Thank you.

482
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,399
 Can you pack me one more order please?

483
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,399
 I want to go home and
 eat together with her.

484
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,399
 Yes.

485
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:03,399
 Thank you.

486
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,399
 Twenty. There.

487
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,399
 There.

488
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,399
 Play better.

489
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,399
 Yours aren't easy to hit either.

490
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,399
 - Byul.
 - It's Choon Hee!

491
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,399
 - Oh my. Have you been well?
 - Yes.

492
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:25,399
 Why is it steak though?

493
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:28,399
 My friend gave it to me.

494
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,399
 You have friends that can
 give you something like this?

495
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,399
 Let's eat first.

496
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:40,399
 Eat.

497
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,399
 I was wondering when I
 saw your car outside.

498
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:46,399
 You didn't go the opera?

499
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:48,399
 No.

500
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,775
 I'm a bit tired.

501
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:52,399
 Why? Did the new
 President say he's busy?

502
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,399
 It's not like that.

503
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:56,399
 Okay.

504
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,399
 Rest then.

505
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,399
 Soo In is pretty and she sings well.

506
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:11,399
 It won't be hard for
 her to get married.

507
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,399
 Please recommend her if there
 are good guys out there.

508
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,399
 Last time at your party I saw
 this guy from Shine Star I think.

509
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:20,399
 They looked good together.

510
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,399
 But I think President Jo's
 son has a girl already.

511
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:26,399
 Is that so?

512
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,399
 My son went to school
 with him in New York.

513
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,399
 Soo In, you know that too, right?

514
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:32,399
 Yes.

515
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,399
 I think yesterday he took
 some girl to go riding.

516
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:54,399
 Director Wang.

517
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,399
 Find out if the new President
 has a girlfriend please.

518
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:00,399
 - Here is your order.
 - Thank you.

519
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:03,399
 Miss Choi Choon Hee.

520
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,399
 Talk to me for a moment please.

521
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:08,399
 Yes.

522
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,399
 Where did you go yesterday?

523
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,399
 Sorry?

524
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:16,399
 Did you perhaps go horse riding?

525
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,399
 Yes.

526
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:21,399
 What's the reason you
 entered Shine Star?

527
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,399
 - I came to sing...
 - Then sing. Why are you dating?

528
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,399
 What?

529
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:28,399
 You've got the President in one hand
 and Joon Hyun in the other.

530
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,399
 You're keeping both guys in your hands.

531
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:33,399
 I didn't think of you like that.

532
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:36,399
 Miss Choi Choon Hee, you're
 really above average.

533
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,399
 Senior, I think you've
 misunderstood something.

534
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,399
 Misunderstood?

535
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:41,399
 Then why did you go ride horses
 with the President yesterday?

536
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,399
 Here's some advice.

537
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:48,399
 If you're going to succeed
 through seducing guys

538
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,399
 try it somewhere else.

539
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:53,399
 Shine Star is not a place where
 someone like you should be.

540
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,399
 - Senior.
 - Stop calling me Senior.

541
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:59,399
 I've never had a junior like you.

542
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,399
 What are you doing right now?

543
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:14,399
 It's none of your business.

544
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,399
 How is it not my business?
 Choi Choon Hee is my singer.

545
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:17,399
 Choi Choon Hee, Choi Choon
 Hee, Choi Choon Hee!

546
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:20,399
 Why do you all only care
 about Choi Choon Hee?

547
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:22,399
 Soo In.

548
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,399
 You wake up too. You
 said she's your singer.

549
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,399
 Then manage her well.

550
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,399
 It's not good for there to be
 rumors about her and the President.

551
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,399
 What do you mean?

552
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,399
 Don't you know that word has spread
 how she's seducing the President?

553
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,399
 What do you know about Choi Choon Hee?

554
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,399
 She's not that kind of person.

555
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:44,399
 I think you're the one that
 doesn't know anything about her.

556
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,399
 Do you know the two of them
 went horse riding yesterday?

557
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,399
 What?

558
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,399
 Have you found out about the
 President's girlfriend?

559
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,399
 Instead of that, there's something
 else that's interesting.

560
00:34:58,399 --> 00:34:59,399
 Something interesting?

561
00:35:12,399 --> 00:35:13,399
 President Jo Geun Woo.

562
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:19,399
 I have something to discuss with you.

563
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:20,399
 Who are you?

564
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:24,399
 Let's talk after you look at these.

565
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:49,399
 Go that way. I'll drive.

566
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:50,399
 You?

567
00:35:57,399 --> 00:35:59,399
 Turn at that pharmacy there.

568
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:03,399
 I know.

569
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:08,399
 Hey, hey! People are
 crossing over there!

570
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:13,399
 Stop it!

571
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:15,399
 I almost got into an
 accident because of you!

572
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:18,399
 I was worried that you didn't see it.

573
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:33,399
 Mr. Jang Joon Hyun.

574
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:35,399
 Let's talk for a moment.

575
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:39,399
 Hurry up and talk.

576
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,399
 Get out of Miss Choi Choon
 Hee's house immediately.

577
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:46,399
 What?

578
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:50,399
 I know that you live in that house.

579
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:53,399
 It doesn't matter.

580
00:36:53,399 --> 00:36:58,399
 I understand that a manager
 needs to live with his singer.

581
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:01,399
 But I'm not the problem.

582
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:22,399
 A reporter came to me.

583
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:28,399
 He said he'll give me the pictures if
 I pay twice as much as Director Yang.

584
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:32,399
 Although I blocked it this time

585
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:34,399
 this won't be the last time.

586
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:43,399
 Thanks for telling me

587
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:46,399
 but I can't leave this house.
 Why?

588
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:49,399
 Because like you said, I'm
 Choi Choon Hee's manager.

589
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:52,399
 Let people talk.

590
00:37:52,399 --> 00:37:53,399
 They'll stop if you ignore them.

591
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,525
 A scandal is the end of a singer.

592
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:03,399
 Don't you know that better than me?

593
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:14,399
 You're going to leave
 that house, right?

594
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:16,399
 Mr. Jang Joon Hyun.

595
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:19,399
 You like Miss Choi Choon Hee.

596
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:26,399
 I'll take care of my own business.

597
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:34,399
 Is it you, Joon Hyun?

598
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:36,399
 Yes.

599
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,399
 Did you just come after parking?

600
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,399
 Anyway, this is pretty
 fast for you already.

601
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:48,399
 Here.

602
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:52,399
 - Wow!
 - You should have said something.

603
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:54,399
 You adorable guy.

604
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:00,399
 Are you not eating though?

605
00:39:01,399 --> 00:39:02,399
 Eat.

606
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:05,399
 Then we're going to eat all of it.

607
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:07,399
 Here. Eat.

608
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:24,399
 I'm not sure if you should do this
 to people in the same company.

609
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:33,399
 What about you, President?
 Should you this?

610
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:34,525
 You let her take away the
 advertisements and even

611
00:39:35,067 --> 00:39:36,399
 the opening pitch of a singer
 from the same company.

612
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:41,399
 Why do you only help
 Miss Choi Choon Hee?

613
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:43,399
 Did I do that?

614
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:46,399
 Well, that's true. I might
 have helped her a lot.

615
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:49,399
 Actually, I like Miss Choi Choon Hee.

616
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:51,399
 Sorry?

617
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:56,399
 Therefore you shouldn't bother
 Miss Choi Choon Hee anymore.

618
00:39:57,399 --> 00:40:00,399
 Stop minding her business.

619
00:40:13,984 --> 00:40:16,399
 What? Does your throat hurt?

620
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:19,399
 I'll go get warm water.

621
00:40:23,399 --> 00:40:25,399
 Excuse me.

622
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:31,399
 I'm Miss Choi Choon Hee's fan.

623
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:36,399
 Could you please give this
 to Miss Choi Choon Hee?

624
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:37,399
 Yes.

 Do you want to try one too?

00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:14,399
 There.

00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:53,399
 What do you mean you're
 going to quit now?

660
00:43:53,399 --> 00:43:56,399
 Her song is already at third place.

661
00:43:56,399 --> 00:43:58,399
 I'll make you an album
 if she gets first place.

662
00:43:58,399 --> 00:44:02,399
 I said I don't want it.

663
00:44:02,399 --> 00:44:03,399
 Did you eat something wrong?

664
00:44:03,399 --> 00:44:08,399
 Your comeback is right in front of you.
 What are you talking about?

665
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:10,399
 There's a saying that
 you can quit being

666
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:12,399
 governor of the capital
 if you want to.

667
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,399
 I don't want to do it.

668
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:16,399
 Therefore the contract between
 us is automatically terminated.

669
00:44:18,399 --> 00:44:20,399
 I'm sorry.

670
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:23,399
 Hey, you. You! Hey!

671
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:31,399
 She needs to take care of her throat

672
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:34,399
 so make sure she doesn't
 drink cold things.

673
00:44:34,399 --> 00:44:36,399
 Make sure to make ball
 flower tea for her.

674
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:41,399
 She needs to wear a
 scarf around her neck.

675
00:44:42,399 --> 00:44:45,399
 And the most important thing is

676
00:44:46,399 --> 00:44:51,399
 she's crazy so she can't stop
 practicing once she starts.

677
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:55,399
 You need to stop her from time to time.

678
00:44:57,399 --> 00:45:00,399
 Did you get some incurable disease?

679
00:45:00,399 --> 00:45:01,399
 Are you going somewhere?

680
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:05,399
 I know, right? Why are you
 letting us be her manager?

681
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:08,399
 That's because

682
00:45:08,399 --> 00:45:11,399
 she has sold quite a few albums.

683
00:45:11,399 --> 00:45:13,399
 Choi Choon Hee has grown enough.

684
00:45:13,399 --> 00:45:15,399
 I need to focus on my own music.

685
00:45:15,399 --> 00:45:18,399
 She took up so much of my time.

686
00:45:18,399 --> 00:45:20,399
 Can we do it?

687
00:45:27,399 --> 00:45:29,399
 Where are we going right now?

688
00:45:31,399 --> 00:45:33,399
 We're going to study music.

689
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:35,399
 Is it a nice place?

690
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,399
 Yes.

691
00:45:37,399 --> 00:45:40,234
 It would be nice if Byul came too.

692
00:45:44,399 --> 00:45:46,399
 What is this place?

693
00:45:46,399 --> 00:45:48,399
 Let's go in.

694
00:45:59,399 --> 00:46:02,399
 This "pang" noise is really loud.

695
00:46:02,399 --> 00:46:04,399
 The sound of the ocean.

696
00:46:23,399 --> 00:46:25,399
 Choi Choon Hee.

697
00:46:25,399 --> 00:46:26,399
 Yes?

698
00:46:26,399 --> 00:46:28,399
 How long has it been since
 you played outside?

699
00:46:28,399 --> 00:46:32,399
 This is the first time since
 senior year of high school.

700
00:46:32,399 --> 00:46:33,399
 Are you happy?

701
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:35,399
 Yes. It's fun.

702
00:46:35,399 --> 00:46:37,399
 I'm happy too.

703
00:46:40,399 --> 00:46:42,399
 - Choi Choon Hee.
 - Yes?

704
00:46:43,399 --> 00:46:45,399
 Thank you.

705
00:46:45,399 --> 00:46:47,399
 For what?

706
00:46:48,399 --> 00:46:51,399
 Just... thank you.

707
00:46:52,399 --> 00:46:56,399
 Then thank you too for
 driving me yesterday.

708
00:46:57,399 --> 00:46:59,399
 I'm sorry.

709
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,399
 For what?

710
00:47:03,399 --> 00:47:06,399
 Just know that I'm sorry.

711
00:47:06,399 --> 00:47:09,399
 That's true. There's more than
 one thing you should be sorry about.

712
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:16,399
 This girl...

713
00:47:24,399 --> 00:47:26,276
 Excuse me.

714
00:47:26,399 --> 00:47:28,399
 - Huh?
 - What are you doing?

715
00:47:28,399 --> 00:47:30,399
 Studying sound.

716
00:47:38,399 --> 00:47:41,399
 Hey, you get this. Thank
 you for your hard work.

717
00:47:41,399 --> 00:47:43,399
 Welcome.

718
00:47:43,399 --> 00:47:46,399
 It's pretty.

719
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:50,399
 You like it?

720
00:47:52,399 --> 00:47:53,399
 Your taste...

721
00:47:54,399 --> 00:47:57,399
 What? It's pretty.

722
00:47:59,399 --> 00:48:01,399
 - Thank for your hard work.
 - Yes. Goodbye.

723
00:48:01,399 --> 00:48:03,399
 - Yes.
 - Hurry up!

724
00:48:07,399 --> 00:48:09,399
 It's so nice.

725
00:48:12,399 --> 00:48:15,399
 This is a special place
 that only I know about.

726
00:48:16,399 --> 00:48:18,399
 You're the first person
 I've brought here.

727
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:20,399
 Really?

728
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:23,399
 I feel honored.

729
00:48:28,399 --> 00:48:30,399
 You know, there are times in life

730
00:48:31,399 --> 00:48:35,399
 when you're hurt, annoyed
 or depressed for no reason.

731
00:48:35,399 --> 00:48:37,399
 That's true.

732
00:48:37,399 --> 00:48:39,399
 There are times you want to
 be comforted by someone.

733
00:48:42,399 --> 00:48:44,399
 Close your eyes

734
00:48:45,399 --> 00:48:47,399
 and try feeling it.

735
00:48:59,399 --> 00:49:04,399
 If you stay here alone, you calm down.

736
00:49:07,399 --> 00:49:10,399
 It's really nice.

737
00:49:16,399 --> 00:49:17,399
 Choi.

738
00:49:24,399 --> 00:49:28,399
 You're going to be a shining
 singer no matter where you are.

739
00:49:30,399 --> 00:49:33,399
 Why are you giving me goose bumps?

740
00:49:33,399 --> 00:49:35,399
 Stop it.

741
00:49:36,399 --> 00:49:39,399
 My sixth sense is crazy accurate.

742
00:49:47,399 --> 00:49:49,399
 I know this song.

743
00:49:49,399 --> 00:49:51,399
 - You?
 - Yes.

744
00:49:51,399 --> 00:49:53,399
 You know something besides trot?

745
00:49:53,399 --> 00:49:56,399
 Don't underestimate me. I
 listen to a lot of songs.

746
00:49:57,399 --> 00:50:02,399
 <i>I like you so much.

747
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:06,399
 <i>I want to tell you that

748
00:50:06,399 --> 00:50:09,399
 <i>but I can't find the courage.

749
00:50:09,399 --> 00:50:15,399
 <i>I like you so much too.

750
00:50:15,399 --> 00:50:22,399
 <i>I want to tell you that
 but I can't find the courage.

751
00:50:22,399 --> 00:50:28,399
 <i>I want to say I love you.

752
00:50:28,399 --> 00:50:34,399
 <i>While I'm burning like
 this on the inside

753
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:40,399
 <i>I'm worried that you'll leave.

754
00:50:40,399 --> 00:50:48,399
 <i>We keep worrying like fools.

755
00:50:48,399 --> 00:50:56,399
 <i>One, two, three. When I see your eyes,
 I'm surprised, so I turn my eyes.

756
00:50:56,399 --> 00:51:01,399
 <i>My face becomes red in
 front of you like a fool.

757
00:51:01,399 --> 00:51:08,399
 <i>I practiced saying "I love
 you" more than I can count.

758
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:13,399
 <i>But I can't say it.

759
00:51:24,399 --> 00:51:26,399
 Is there nothing you want to eat?

760
00:51:28,399 --> 00:51:30,399
 Triangle kimbap!

761
00:51:30,399 --> 00:51:32,399
 One that hasn't expired yet.

762
00:51:35,399 --> 00:51:37,399
 Why did you ask?

763
00:51:38,399 --> 00:51:39,399
 I'm going to make it for you.

764
00:51:40,399 --> 00:51:41,399
 Why?

765
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:43,399
 Because I want to.

766
00:51:59,399 --> 00:52:02,399
 Are you not done yet?
 I'm going to starve to death first.

767
00:52:02,399 --> 00:52:04,399
 Joon Hyun, hurry up. I'm hungry.

768
00:52:06,399 --> 00:52:07,399
 It's all done.

769
00:52:09,399 --> 00:52:13,399
 I'm hungry.

770
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:19,399
 It's done.

771
00:52:19,399 --> 00:52:23,399
 Hurry up and bring it.

772
00:52:23,399 --> 00:52:25,399
 - Here.
 - It looks like it tastes good.

773
00:52:25,399 --> 00:52:27,399
 There's a lot of meat.

774
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:35,399
 Chew slowly and eat it.

775
00:52:36,399 --> 00:52:37,399
 This is good.

776
00:52:37,399 --> 00:52:38,399
 You eat too.

777
00:52:38,399 --> 00:52:40,399
 It's okay.

778
00:52:40,399 --> 00:52:41,399
 What do you mean it's okay? Here.

779
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:46,399
 It's yummy, right?

780
00:52:50,399 --> 00:52:54,399
 Just say it inside. Why do we
 have to come all the way outside?

781
00:52:59,399 --> 00:53:04,399
 I'm going to move out of your house.

782
00:53:05,399 --> 00:53:06,399
 What?

783
00:53:08,399 --> 00:53:10,399
 I'm going to quit being
 your manager as well.

784
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:12,399
 What are you talking about suddenly?

785
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,399
 What do you mean "suddenly"?

786
00:53:16,399 --> 00:53:19,399
 Did you think I would follow
 you your whole life?

787
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:23,399
 Your life is good enough now.

788
00:53:23,399 --> 00:53:26,399
 More people recognize you too.

789
00:53:28,399 --> 00:53:31,399
 You might have forgotten
 since I'm here like this

790
00:53:31,399 --> 00:53:32,399
 but I'm a singer.

791
00:53:32,399 --> 00:53:34,399
 I need to prepare for my album too.

792
00:53:34,399 --> 00:53:36,399
 Isn't that right?

793
00:53:36,399 --> 00:53:39,399
 That's true but...

794
00:53:39,399 --> 00:53:42,399
 you didn't say anything until now.
 It feels sudden.

795
00:53:44,399 --> 00:53:46,399
 You asked me before

796
00:53:46,399 --> 00:53:48,399
 why I wanted to make you a singer.

797
00:53:49,399 --> 00:53:51,399
 Actually, I made a deal.

798
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:56,399
 President Jo Hee Moon
 said he would make a

799
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,399
 comeback album for me
 if I made you a singer.

800
00:53:59,399 --> 00:54:01,399
 What?

801
00:54:01,399 --> 00:54:06,399
 That's why the artist Jang
 Joon Hyun made a trot singer.

802
00:54:07,399 --> 00:54:09,399
 I wasn't next to you
 because I liked you.

803
00:54:09,399 --> 00:54:11,399
 Do you understand now?

804
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,399
 Then what should I do now?

805
00:54:20,399 --> 00:54:22,399
 We need to go our separate ways now.

806
00:54:24,399 --> 00:54:26,399
 I'm going in first.

807
00:55:16,399 --> 00:55:17,399
 Here.

808
00:55:17,399 --> 00:55:19,399
 - I'll go to school now.
 - Byul.

809
00:55:20,399 --> 00:55:21,399
 Do you have your observation diary?

810
00:55:21,399 --> 00:55:24,399
 - Oh, right.
 - Oh my.

811
00:55:24,399 --> 00:55:25,399
 Come here.

812
00:55:26,399 --> 00:55:28,399
 You can't forget next time. Okay?

813
00:55:28,399 --> 00:55:31,399
 You can just remember it for me.

814
00:55:31,399 --> 00:55:33,399
 Come here.

815
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:36,399
 Done.

816
00:55:38,399 --> 00:55:40,399
 I'll be back.

817
00:55:40,399 --> 00:55:41,399
 Byul.

818
00:55:41,399 --> 00:55:43,276
 If you get full credit
 on your observation

819
00:55:43,399 --> 00:55:44,399
 diary, it's all thanks to me.
 Okay?

820
00:55:44,399 --> 00:55:45,399
 Buy me food.

821
00:55:50,399 --> 00:55:51,399
 Goodbye, Choon Hee.

822
00:55:51,399 --> 00:55:52,399
