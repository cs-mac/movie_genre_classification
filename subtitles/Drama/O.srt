* Ave Maria,
piena di grazia, eletta *

* Fra le spose

Man: All my life,
I always wanted to fly.

7
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:18,617
I always wanted
to live like a hawk.

8
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:23,587
I know you're not supposed
to be jealous of anything, but...

9
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:25,654
to take flight,

10
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:29,065
to soar above
everything and everyone,

11
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:32,530
now that's living.

12
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,003

00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:46,744
Man #2: Now listen, lads.
Listen up!

15
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,583
They are not
going to foul.

16
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:51,055
I know that son of a bitch,
and he plays conservative.

17
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:53,422
So, we'll burn
1 5 seconds off the clock,

18
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:55,620
and we'll end this thing
our way in his house.

19
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:58,789
We stack it up. I want Odin, Michael
and Billy to handle the ball.

20
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:00,924
Hugo, you and Todd
set up the screens.

21
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:03,993
At 1 3 seconds, we run
the Tulsa play for Odin. Give me that.

22
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,233
Todd, you're in the stack
with Michael. Hugo-- Hugo!

23
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:10,674
You're at the right elbow. Billy, you're
at the low block on the weak side.

24
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:14,145
And remember, lads.
Hugo and Todd are decoys.

25
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:17,615
Decoys! I don't want to see either
one of those guys with the ball.

26
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:21,085
At 1 3 seconds, we free up Odin
for the one on one, then clear!

27
00:02:21,154 --> 00:02:23,486
If it's not Odin, Michael.

28
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:25,923
Put them in.
What time is it, team?

29
00:02:25,992 --> 00:02:27,016
Game time! Rah!

30
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:28,321
All right, let's focus!

31
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:40,006
( whistling )

32
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:44,169
Move, move!

33
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:48,446
Coach: Good passes.
I want good passes!

34
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:51,280
Coach: Keep it tight.

35
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:55,384
Tight!

36
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:01,419
Players: Go, go, go!

37
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:02,985
Take the ball!

38
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:08,762
- Coach: Tulsa!
- Odin: Tulsa!

39
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:14,198
Don't stop! Don't stop!

40
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:15,707
Don't stop!

five, four, three, two, one--

45
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:38,283
- Man #3: Coach Duke Goulding!
- ( clapping and cheering )

46
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:42,717
Duke:
Thank you. Thank you.

47
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:44,730
Thank you very much.

48
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:46,459
All right.

49
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:48,433
Odin, would you
come down here, please?

50
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:51,061
Duke: As you all know,
I am a man of few words.

51
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:53,935
Except for when one of us
is late for practice, right, Pop?

52
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:56,237
I'll pretend I don't know
who said that, Hugo.

53
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:57,799
I'll get right to the point.

54
00:04:57,877 --> 00:05:00,744
By virtue of having won
our divisional championship,

55
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:03,180
as well as having the best
record in the league,

56
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:06,548
we will have home court advantage
in the State Championship,

57
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,748
all the way up to, and
including, the semi-finals.

58
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:14,556
And one reason for that is
this young man standing next to me.

59
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:16,493
And I'll tell you
something else too--

60
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:20,466
and I'm very proud
to say this publicly.

61
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:24,229
I love him
like my own son.

62
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:28,907
( crowd cheering )

63
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:31,205
Duke:
Not only is he a shoe-in

64
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:33,905
for this year's USA Today
high school All American,

65
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,710
but he is going
to lead this team

66
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:44,246
to the 20th State Championship in the
1 1 5 year history of this institution!

67
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:49,154
You can stay on your feet,

68
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:52,460
'cause at this time,
I am very proud to present

69
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:54,762
this year's
unanimous choice

70
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:58,964
for most valuable player
to Mr. Odin James.

71
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,597
- Congratulations.
- ( crowd cheering )

72
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,070
You know, at the beginning
of the season,

73
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:10,309
we decided
to go all the way.

74
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:12,749
And I did give it
all I had,

75
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:17,085
but that wouldn't have meant nothing
if I didn't have a go-to guy.

76
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:19,785
Odin: Big Mike,
come up here, man.

77
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:24,057
Odin: Come on, now's not
the time to be shy. Come on.

78
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:29,328
Odin: I told the coach
I wasn't accepting the MVP award

79
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:32,929
unless the ''man with the
hands'' could share it with me.

80
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:34,667
That's for you, baby.

81
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:37,701
Odin: It's all you, baby.

Are you going to get
Desi and I together?

103
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:42,165
- She's with him.
- Hugo: They're breaking up.

104
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:45,700
When people are breaking up,
they don't grind.

105
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,440
Those two
are definitely grinding.

106
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:48,913
Hugo:
We're going to break them up.

107
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,447
I thought
you were his friend.

108
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,487
You hang out
with him all the time.

109
00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:56,419
Hugo: And that's perfect,
'cause if we're going to do this,

110
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:58,719
I've got to act like
I'm cool with him anyway.

111
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:02,250
Look, you know
what a utility man is?

112
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:03,556
A what?

113
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:06,791
I'm considered
a utility man.

114
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:10,495
I rebound, I can shoot.
I play guard, forward, power forward.

115
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,834
You name the position,
I fucking play it.

116
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:16,604
- What's your point?
- The point is,

117
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:19,042
I'm the MVP
on this piece of shit team.

118
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:22,513
I've been banging in the paint and
setting screens for the past four years,

119
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:25,949
and he chooses Michael.
Fucking sophomore! No way!

- He'll boot me out of school.

We are two blocks away from
the Roger Calhoon Senior Library.

00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:02,113
- Man: Yes?
- Uh, hi. Dean Brable?

128
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:03,780
Man:
Yes. Who is this?

129
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:05,984
I don't know
how to tell you this, sir,

130
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:08,687
but someone sort of stole
something from you.

131
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:10,956
Brable:
What are you talking about?

132
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,327
Your daughter.

133
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:15,367
What about my daughter?

134
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:18,268
We're going to run them until
they drop dead or we drop dead!

135
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:20,568
Duke: And that means
pressing on defense too.

136
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,540
And by the way,
my friend, Hugo,

137
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:24,440
your ass was dragging
in the fourth quarter.

138
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,501
Either you get back
to your position on the traps,

139
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:29,742
- or you give me some reason why.
- I'll be all right.

140
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:32,512
You got to be better
than all right, son!

141
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:34,712
Everybody
look at me, not him!

142
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:37,551
This goes for you!
On your feet, gentlemen.

143
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:39,922
Good afternoon, Dean.
You're welcome here.

144
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:42,427
Good afternoon.

145
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:45,328
And I have a witness who says
he forced himself on her.

146
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:47,559
What? Who?

147
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:52,401
Look, if Desi says that I did anything
even close to wrong to her,

148
00:09:52,472 --> 00:09:55,202
- I'll leave the goddamn school.
- Take it easy, son.

149
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:57,334
Bob, that's a very
serious allegation.

150
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,573
- You say you have a witness?
- Come on, there's no witness.

151
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:02,979
I would never do anything
like that. Ever.

152
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:05,711
Brable: You're telling me you never
had any run-ins with the police?

153
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:08,151
No, it means I didn't
force myself on Desi.

154
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:10,781
That's not
what I just asked you.

155
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:13,018
What are you trying to say?

156
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:16,255
- You know what I'm saying.
- You're saying I'm not clean?

157
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:17,921
Cause I'm not
on that shit no more.

158
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:19,396
Come on, coach,
you know this.

159
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:21,990
I mean, test my ass.
Test me.

160
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:24,127
This is fucked up.
This is fucked up.

161
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:27,969
And a lot of the things I hear you say
about Desi are fucked up.

162
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,100
- Bob.
- Don't underestimate me, son.

163
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:32,804
Don't underestimate me
when it comes to my daughter.

164
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,645
Hey, Bob! Please, please!
Back off! Now, come on. Please.

165
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:38,047
If you were
so worried about me,

166
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:40,813
how come this school
busted its ass to get me here?

167
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:42,787
- Because you were worth it!
- ( knocking on door )

168
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:43,822
Yes?

169
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,881
Duke:
Come in, sweetheart.

170
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,018
Please,
sit down over here.

171
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:49,721
D, you've got to tell
these guys what's going on.

172
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:53,323
- Brable: We know what's going on.
- Duke: We've got to be reasonable.

173
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,297
Now, come on.

174
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:57,065
Honey...

175
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:02,403
we've never had
any secrets before, right?

176
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:05,205
I just want you
to tell me the truth.

177
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:07,576
Did Odin ever harm you,

178
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:12,175
force you to do anything
that you didn't want to do?

179
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:13,775
Anything at all?

180
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:19,352
Odin and I have been
together for four months.

181
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:23,293
Brable: ''Together''?
What does that mean, ''together''?

182
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:24,990
Dad, that's none
of your business.

183
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:27,294
Brable:
I asked you a question.

184
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:30,596
And I said
it's none of your business.

185
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:50,587
Listen, Bob,
this is a family matter.

186
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:53,318
Maybe we shouldn't be
discussing it here.

187
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:56,226
I mean, he's a good kid.
Don't do this.

188
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:01,831
Talk to him.

189
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:03,869
Let's give him
a chance to talk.

190
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:05,528
Outside.

191
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:17,512
Sir, I just want to tell you that
you've got a great daughter there.

192
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:21,854
And I really,
really care about her.

193
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:27,052
You've got to understand
that what we have is beautiful.

194
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:32,663
No. She deceived me.

195
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:36,592
What makes you think
she won't do the same to you?

196
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:40,667
( coughing )

197
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:45,199
If you ever lie on me again, I'll fuck
your punk ass up a lot worse than this.

198
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:47,838
You understand me, Rog? Huh?

199
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:54,142
Odin:
See you at dinner.

200
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:01,149
( hip hop music playing )

201
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,678
Man: You're going to keep doing
this shit all year, yo?

202
00:13:27,753 --> 00:13:30,085
You tell me, man.
You're the pharmacist.

203
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:36,552
You know, some of these drugs I sell
will guarantee to have you twisted up.

204
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:40,463
This steroid,
50-50 chance.

205
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,398
I put three inches
on my vertical this month.

206
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:44,993
I took half a second
off my 40, bro'.

207
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:47,332
It's doing the job.

208
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:50,933
When you start playing for North
Carolina, don't forget about me.

209
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,875
Shoot the nigger
some tickets.

210
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:54,936
I'm talking about court side.

211
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:07,984
Man: we're going to cycle you
to something else next week.

212
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,823
You've been drinking
enough water?

213
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:12,160
By the gallon, man.

214
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:16,258
I'm surprised it doesn't come out
these holes you keep sticking in me.

215
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:19,395
Man: I know you're all into
this basketball stuff,

216
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:21,997
but if it don't work,
don't trip.

217
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:25,475
I'm saying cause there's some things
in life we weren't meant to have.

218
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:28,571
I mean, don't go out there making
yourself all crazy and shit.

219
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:32,482
How can I go crazy when I've got
you selling me dream in a bottle, man?

220
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:37,445
So, have you talked
to him about it?

221
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:39,388
Woman:
There's nothing to talk about.

222
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,483
I do everything for him,

223
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:44,325
but he's been acting
completely weird lately.

224
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:46,422
Desi:
Lately? Try always.

225
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:48,467
Desi: Sorry.

226
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:50,229
What's the deal?

227
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:52,965
Everyone at school
likes Hugo, except you.

228
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,529
Nobody doesn't like him.

229
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:57,132
I don't trust anyone who doesn't
have at least one enemy.

230
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,007
Woman:
Well, I guess he does.

231
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:00,477
Desi: I didn't think
you were going to make it.

232
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:02,070
Oh, come on now.

233
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:05,273
You know I can't beat
Magnolia tomorrow

234
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:07,512
without seeing
my good luck charm first.

235
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:09,987
- What's up, Em?
- Hey.

236
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:12,024
Hey, I've got
something for you.

237
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:23,592
It's over 1 00 years old.

238
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:26,229
It's over your price
range is what it is.

239
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:30,469
It was my great-grandmother's and
it's always been in my family.

240
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:33,444
It's supposed
to stay that way, but...

241
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:35,912
I feel like
we're already family.

242
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:39,008
Yo, Em, don't think
I forgot you.

243
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:40,950
I got the new Harlem's
Finest for you, baby.

244
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,851
Odin:
Enjoy that, all right?

245
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:04,933
Come on, Emily's here.

246
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:07,946
Odin: I know.
We're not going to do anything.

247
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:11,211
I just like feeling
your skin next to mine, okay?

248
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:12,911
Come on.

249
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:28,800
My father's a smart man. But he's
never actually been through anything.

250
00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:35,967
He acts like he's in control all
the time, but really he's just scared.

251
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:38,101
Desi:
You never seem scared to me.

252
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:40,975
Are you asking me how
I got that scar on my back?

253
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:44,073
You do have
the best stories.

254
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:49,210
I was a C-section baby
and they cut too far.

255
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:52,849
My mom couldn't afford
a good doctor.

256
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:55,860
Are you serious?

257
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:58,055
I fell off my skateboard.

258
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:01,366
Are you crazy?
I get scared all the time.

259
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:02,958
- You do not.
- Yes, I do.

260
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:03,967
When?

261
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:06,968
When?

262
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,666
Okay.

263
00:17:08,741 --> 00:17:11,437
The first time
I tried to talk to you,

264
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,104
I thought I was going
to faint, or something.

265
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,374
That's not true.

266
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:18,178
The second sentence out of your
mouth was, ''Do you have a boyfriend?''

267
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,945
I said I was scared.

268
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:22,317
I never said I couldn't
handle the pressure.

269
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:25,084
You know I've got
them player skills.

270
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:27,591
Oh, he's getting
a little cocky.

271
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,720
Don't say ''little'' and ''cocky'' in
the same sentence when it comes to me.

272
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:33,230
Especially
when you know the deal.

273
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:34,766
Shut up!

274
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:39,802
No, but you really
think I'm too cocky?

275
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:41,965
No, it's okay.
You should be.

276
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:45,135
- You pulled me, didn't you?
- Yes, I did.

277
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:47,406
Yes, indeed, I did.

278
00:17:48,748 --> 00:17:50,340
I don't know how,
but you did it.

279
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,077
What do you mean,
you don't know how?

280
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:54,449
I pulled you 'cause
I'm that kind of nigger.

281
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:59,257
Uh-oh. Don't be
acting like that.

282
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:01,691
See, I can say ''nigger''
cause I am a nigger.

283
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:04,559
You can't 'cause you ain't.
Don't be jealous.

284
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,793
And why can't I say it?
My people invented the word.

285
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:09,334
You can't even think it.

286
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:10,994
You're the one
who started it.

287
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,265
You said I was so fine
you'd let me dress you up

288
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:15,864
and play Black Buck
Got Loose in the Big House.

289
00:18:15,941 --> 00:18:17,408
Don't go repeating
that, all right?

290
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:19,706
If another Black person
knew I said that,

291
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:21,713
I could get my
suffering-Negro-league card revoked.

292
00:18:26,652 --> 00:18:30,918
Then you'd better watch out, because
I've got some dirt on you, player.

293
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,083
Got some dirt on me, huh?

294
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:34,751
You better not
let that leak.

295
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:36,294
( both laughing )

296
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:40,628
Announcer:
And now, your year 2000...

297
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:45,932
low country preparatory
league champion,

298
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:52,001
Palmetto Grove Hawks!

299
00:18:57,349 --> 00:18:59,840
( hip hop music playing )

300
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:09,253
( whistling )

301
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,794
* What is the Black star? *

302
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:18,393
* Is it the cat
with the black shades, the black car? *

303
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:20,996
* Is it shining from very far
to where you are *

304
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:22,836
* It is commonplace
or different *

305
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:25,103
* Intimate and distant,
fresher than an infant *

306
00:19:25,177 --> 00:19:27,737
* Black, my family thick
like they're striped molasses *

307
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:30,338
* Star on the rise
in the eyes of the masses *

308
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,044
* Black is the color
of my true love's hair *

309
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:35,279
* Stars are bright shining,
hot balls of air *

310
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:37,219
* Black like my baby girl's stare *

311
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:39,814
* Black like the velvet
that the muslim wear *

312
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:42,690
* Black like the planet
that they fear, why they scared? *

313
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:44,956
* Black like a slave ship
that later brought us here *

314
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,294
* Black like the cheeks
that are roadways for tears *

315
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:50,062
* That leaved Black faces
well traveled with years *

316
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:51,659
* Black like assassins' crosshairs *

317
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:54,205
* Blacker than
my granddaddy armchair *

318
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:56,605
* He never really got
no time to chill there *

319
00:19:56,675 --> 00:19:58,336
* 'Cause this life
is warfare, warfare *

320
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,878
* Deep on the front lines,
and Blacks is all there *

321
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:03,210
* Black like the perception
of who on welfare *

322
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:05,273
* Black like faces
at the bottom of the well, *

323
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:07,046
* I've been there
before to bring the light *

324
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,677
* And heat it up
like ''la cocina'' *

325
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:11,348
* There's so much to life
when you just stay Black... *

326
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:12,583
Push! Push!

327
00:20:13,592 --> 00:20:16,186
* Blacker than the seed
in a blackberry pie *

328
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:18,127
* Blacker than
the middle of my eye *

329
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:19,858
* Black like feh-lah man cry *

330
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:22,400
* I'm dark like the side
of the moon you don't see *

331
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:24,095
* When the moon is shining newly *

332
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:26,660
* You know who else
is a Black star? *

333
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:28,263
* You know who else
is a Black star? *

334
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,272
* Who? *
* Me. *

335
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:32,333
( whistling )

336
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:36,111
Shit.

337
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,277
Announcer:
Injured on the floor.

338
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:43,287
Palmetto Grove's
number four, Odin James.

339
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:54,496
- Is he okay?
- They're doing a CAT scan right now,

340
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:57,263
so we'll see.
Don't worry.

341
00:20:57,336 --> 00:20:59,031
Duke: Edmund, did you bring
the insurance card?

342
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:00,628
- Ed: I've got the card.
- Duke: So we're covered?

343
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:06,469
Mickey gets more kisses
from my girl than I do.

344
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:09,070
Could you stop being
a sarcastic asshole just once?

345
00:21:09,148 --> 00:21:12,879
Hugo: I was joking,
all right? Relax.

346
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:15,716
Odin: What's the deal?
I'm gone for a couple of hours

347
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:17,346
and you're already
taking my girl, Big Mike?

348
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:22,488
- Odin: What's up, dude?
- You get right home and get some rest.

349
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:24,859
Odin: I will, man.
What's up, baby?

350
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:29,525
I was worried about you.

351
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:31,433
You were the one
who got hurt, stupid.

352
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:33,471
No, you don't understand.

353
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,632
I was worried that
if I hurt myself,

354
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,142
who was going to take care
of you over there at Duke?

355
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,734
Desi:
Oh, right, right.

356
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:41,780
You're still going to play
''Big House'' with me, though, right?

357
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:44,315
Hey, stop it with that.

358
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:46,874
Then you better
stop getting hurt.

359
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:49,853
- I love you.
- I love you too.

360
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:52,891
Duke: You kids need to get back
to the dorms. Let's go, Hugo.

361
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,017
I'm going to give
a shout at the boys, all right?

362
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:56,789
- Mike.
- Hey, man.

363
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:59,854
- We did our thing today, bro'.
- Yeah, we did good.

364
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,168
What's up, Em?
How are you doing?

365
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:04,793
Hugo.

366
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,395
Hugo: Thought we lost you
there for a second.

367
00:22:07,473 --> 00:22:10,135
I ain't going nowhere.
But did we take it to them or what?

368
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:12,973
You took it to them by yourself.
You know that, player.

369
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:14,910
You're coming to
that party off campus?

370
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,380
Yeah, I need to get a ride
with my dad, though.

371
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:19,440
All right, man.
Don't take too long.

372
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:20,849
Later, Hugo.

373
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:25,686
Come on, don't worry.
He'll get there.

374
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:29,252
Yeah, Roger.

375
00:22:29,328 --> 00:22:31,421
We've got
plans tonight, man.

376
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:39,834
( hip hop music playing )

377
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:45,033
When I passed out,
I think I had a vision.

378
00:22:46,945 --> 00:22:51,439
Have you ever ridden on the handlebars
on one of your friends' bikes?

379
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:52,984
Yeah.

380
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:56,488
Well, I used to ride on the bars
and try to close my eyes.

381
00:22:56,555 --> 00:22:58,716
I could never do it.

382
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,156
It's some scary shit,
cause you've got

383
00:23:00,225 --> 00:23:04,525
to try to trust
the other person not to crash.

384
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:06,791
You're tripping me out
right now.

385
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:09,425
I feel like I can
close my eyes with you.

386
00:23:11,503 --> 00:23:12,697
Look...

387
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:15,535
we're 1 8,
and personally,

388
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:20,237
I'm not trying to get married by some
Elvis impersonator in Vegas, but...

389
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,677
I figured maybe we could pretend
for a while, you know?

390
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:35,724
That is the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

391
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:46,202
Oh, yeah!

392
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:48,398
Now we're feeling good,
huh?

393
00:23:48,474 --> 00:23:50,271
Go get them, tiger.

394
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:53,004
Now go out there and
you find that girl.

395
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:57,081
- Time to pull some weeds.
- For the record

396
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:58,878
why am I
doing this again?

397
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:02,250
Hugo: Because this is
how you get Desi's attention.

398
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:04,380
Now get your honky
ass in gear.

399
00:24:06,992 --> 00:24:07,959
Mike:
It's about team work.

400
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:09,789
Hey.

401
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:12,524
- Excuse us, Roger.
- Excuse you?

402
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:13,997
We're talking.

403
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:17,502
What, are you diagramming
some basketball plays?

404
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:19,196
What did you say?

405
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:27,273
I don't care if your father
owns the whole fucking school.

406
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:36,244
Shit. Excuse me.

407
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:41,851
Roger!
Take it easy, big guy.

408
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:44,191
- Not so tough, now, are you?
- Hey, Rog!

409
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:46,254
What are you talking about?
Stop it!

410
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:48,492
Your shooting ability
isn't helping you now, is it?

411
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:49,864
Hugo: Take it easy.

412
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:53,128
Hugo: Back it off.

413
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:54,832
Odin:
Stop it, man. Come on.

414
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:55,931
That's enough.

415
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:58,442
Desi: Oh my God, Roger.
You're bleeding.

416
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:00,876
Shit.

417
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:07,850
So, this lad loses
a pint of blood,

418
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,548
and you guys have got nothing
to say for yourselves.

419
00:25:10,622 --> 00:25:12,988
It was an accident, Pop.

420
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:15,253
Roger's been
starting crap all year.

421
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:17,454
Duke: Who threw
the first punch, Michael?

422
00:25:19,631 --> 00:25:22,031
Duke: Hugo, did Michael
throw the first punch?

423
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,193
Answer me, yes or no?!

424
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:28,205
Yeah, Dad. Michael threw the first
punch but it wasn't his fault.

425
00:25:28,273 --> 00:25:31,572
All right? He just had
a few too many beers.

426
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:32,871
I didn't hear that.

427
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:36,406
I did not hear that.
You understand?

428
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,488
You have disgraced our team.

429
00:25:44,556 --> 00:25:46,649
You know the rules.

430
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:49,057
You can attend practice.

431
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:51,595
That's a privilege
that I give you.

432
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:54,962
Duke: But you will not play
in at least two games.

433
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:57,501
Then, we will see.

434
00:25:57,569 --> 00:26:00,094
You know what this is going
to cost us?

435
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:02,538
This young man sitting here...

436
00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:09,844
called you up to share
the Most Valuable Player Award,

437
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:14,579
and you just shit
all over it.

438
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:18,521
And you know, you're lucky
that this didn't happen on campus,

439
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,388
because
your over-privileged ass--

440
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,654
I know, sir.

441
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,120
Get out of here.

442
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,728
Duke: Get out of here,
all of you.

443
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:45,342
Is there some reason you're
still in this office, son?

444
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:46,679
Hugo: No, Pop.

445
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,996
Odin:
You fucked us up, Dogs.

446
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:03,227
Odin: Fucked up.

447
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:34,932
If Odin had got into a fight,
would you have sat him too?

448
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:41,469
I'm eating now.

449
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:58,218
I'm going back
to the dorm, Mom.

450
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:04,088
Hugo: So what did Roger
say to you anyway?

451
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:06,630
I'd feel guilty
kicking his ass.

452
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:08,666
Mike: Save it, Hugo.

453
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:11,168
Hugo: You'll be back on the team
next year. So, who cares?

454
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:14,467
Mike: Dude, it's different
for you, cause your dad is cool.

455
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:16,700
But my parents
are going to find out.

456
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:21,436
Why are you in school, man?

457
00:28:23,882 --> 00:28:25,042
What?

458
00:28:26,718 --> 00:28:29,243
Are you here for
your parents or for you?

459
00:28:30,956 --> 00:28:33,424
So they'll be a little pissed off.
What are they going to do?

460
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:35,460
- Are they going to spank you?
- Hugo,

461
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:38,928
my parents always talk
about reputation.

462
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:42,364
Reputation?
Who gives a fuck about reputation?

463
00:28:42,434 --> 00:28:45,870
I love you, man, but you're
a little bit of a mamma's boy.

464
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:48,929
The only person you have to
answer to is yourself.

465
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:51,202
You make your own rules.

466
00:28:52,277 --> 00:28:54,745
The minute you figure
that out, you're free.

467
00:28:54,813 --> 00:28:56,747
( bell ringing )

468
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:00,709
Look, Mike,

469
00:29:01,753 --> 00:29:04,221
you really want
back on the team?

470
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:06,814
Why can't you just talk
to your dad?

471
00:29:06,892 --> 00:29:11,022
Because I'm telling you,
my dad trusts Odin, all right?

472
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:14,088
If Odin says we need you back in there,
you're back in there.

473
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:16,999
Yeah, but Odin won't
even talk to me, man.

474
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:18,297
Mike,

475
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:20,962
am I your boy?

476
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:24,236
Am I your boy?

477
00:29:24,776 --> 00:29:26,300
Hugo:
All right, then.

478
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:28,175
This is what
we've got to do.

479
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:30,373
You're friends
with Desi, right?

480
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:31,609
Yes, of course.

481
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:33,548
Well, now you're
her best friend.

482
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:36,143
And you're going to get her
to talk to Odin for you.

483
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:38,086
Pour your heart out to her.

484
00:29:38,156 --> 00:29:40,784
Girls are suckers for guys
who pour their hearts out.

485
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:42,793
And then she talks to Odin.

486
00:29:42,861 --> 00:29:44,351
But listen to me.

487
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:47,887
You've got to hang with her.
That's the only way this thing works.

488
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:49,729
It's worth a shot, bro'.

489
00:29:52,771 --> 00:29:55,638
Yo. Hugo, thanks, man.

490
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:58,437
Roger: What are you doing
with this stupid bird?

491
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,944
- People are looking for it.
- Hugo: I borrowed it.

492
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:02,673
Roger:
We've got things to do,

493
00:30:02,747 --> 00:30:04,806
and you're playing pranks
with the fricking mascot?

494
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:06,976
Roger: I can't stop
thinking about her.

495
00:30:07,052 --> 00:30:09,816
Why don't you rich shitheads
ever have any patience?

496
00:30:09,888 --> 00:30:14,257
Anything worth anything
takes time and sacrifice.

497
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:16,317
You spoiled fuck.

498
00:30:17,562 --> 00:30:19,052
What do you call this?

499
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:20,996
You did get your ass kicked
pretty good, though.

500
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:23,796
Roger: No, I got my ass
kicked pretty good twice,

501
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:25,803
in less than a week!

502
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:28,271
I need to know
where this is going!

503
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:32,333
Announcer: Friends, this tournament
has seen some excellent play,

504
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,868
but nothing better than
Odin James of Palmetto Grove.

505
00:30:35,947 --> 00:30:38,415
Announcer:
Tonight, James and his Hawks

506
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:41,281
face the mighty Bulldogs
of North Charleston,

507
00:30:41,353 --> 00:30:47,121
in the first face-off between these
two hoops powerhouses in nine years.

508
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:50,593
The Hawks, now an amazing ninth
in the nation in prep ball

509
00:30:50,662 --> 00:30:54,621
are just two games away
from the State Championship,

510
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:57,793
but they'll have to do it
without their team mascot.

511
00:30:57,869 --> 00:31:00,861
Evidently,
the bird was stolen.

512
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:04,306
So it looks like James will have
to do all the flying himself.

513
00:31:06,645 --> 00:31:09,273
Duke: Watch the hands!
Watch the hands, ref!

514
00:31:09,347 --> 00:31:10,939
He's open!

515
00:31:11,016 --> 00:31:13,985
He's open, Hugo!
Give him the ball!

516
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:15,917
Push, push, push!

517
00:31:26,097 --> 00:31:28,657
Pressure the ball!
Pressure the ball!

518
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,496
Todd, get back!

519
00:31:35,473 --> 00:31:36,997
Todd,
stay with the ball!

520
00:31:41,046 --> 00:31:43,674
Duke: Put a body on him,
for Christ's sake!

521
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,743
Duke: Play the man,
not the ball!

522
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:49,616
Come on,
put a body on him!

523
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:51,679
Come on,
he's slipping!

524
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:54,823
Time!

525
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:57,862
Come on, let's go.
We've only got 20!

526
00:32:00,865 --> 00:32:03,197
Duke: Lads, you're getting
into the wrong guy's face.

527
00:32:03,268 --> 00:32:05,361
Number 45 is taking us
to the cleaners.

528
00:32:05,437 --> 00:32:06,836
Every time he gets
the ball, he's freed up.

529
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:11,308
It's an automatic deuce because nobody
is putting a body on him in the paint.

530
00:32:11,376 --> 00:32:14,243
So put a man to man
with a floater.

531
00:32:14,312 --> 00:32:16,780
Odin, you're the floater.
Billy, look at me!

532
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:19,681
You deny that son of a bitch
the ball, understand?

533
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:21,412
And Odin,
if he gets away from Billy,

534
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:23,147
I don't give a shit if
you have to pull his pisser,

535
00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:25,587
his feet do not
leave the ground!

536
00:32:25,657 --> 00:32:27,284
Duke: Enough said?
All right, put them in.

537
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:29,418
What time is it now?

538
00:32:29,494 --> 00:32:32,156
- All: Game time! Rah!
- All right, let's play!

539
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,222
Duke: Odin, Hugo,
come on! Wake up!

540
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,665
Let's finish this thing.

541
00:32:37,736 --> 00:32:40,899
Give me another board.
Come on, let's go! Get it up!

542
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:44,169
- Watch it!
- Duke: Watch him, Odin!

543
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:49,245
Duke: Push him!
Come on, help him out!

544
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:52,715
Watch the perimeter.
There you go. Take the shot.

545
00:32:56,821 --> 00:32:58,083
Yes!

546
00:32:58,156 --> 00:33:00,590
Duke: Hugo, stay on the elbow.
Stay on the elbow.

547
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:02,524
Pop through, Billy.

548
00:33:04,696 --> 00:33:06,129
Pick it up!

549
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:27,783
( timer sounding )

550
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,446
Odin: Oh, Jesus.
Hey, man.

551
00:34:05,657 --> 00:34:07,716
You know,
I've been thinking, man.

552
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:10,886
I think I'm going to talk
to coach about Mikey.

553
00:34:10,962 --> 00:34:13,829
He should be a part
of all this, man.

554
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:15,092
Listen,

555
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:18,829
did Mike know that you and Desi
were getting together?

556
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:21,337
Odin: Yeah, he knew.

557
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:24,267
Why?

558
00:34:26,277 --> 00:34:28,108
I didn't think he knew.

559
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:31,546
Odin: You know, Mikey's the one
that hooked us up, man.

560
00:34:34,552 --> 00:34:35,985
Do you trust Mike?

561
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:42,121
I trust him out there
on that court.

562
00:34:42,193 --> 00:34:44,184
The man
can play some ball.

563
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:45,729
Yeah,
but do you trust him?

564
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:48,866
Odin: Yeah, he's cool.

565
00:34:53,805 --> 00:34:56,603
What's up, man?
Why are you tripping?

566
00:34:56,674 --> 00:34:58,608
It's nothing, man.

567
00:34:58,676 --> 00:35:02,009
Odin: Come on, Hugo.
Say what you've got to say.

568
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,742
You're not
a jealous person, man.

569
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:07,114
I am.
It's a weakness.

570
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:10,450
You know, sometimes I see things
that are not really there.

571
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:12,649
Odin: Yeah?

572
00:35:17,629 --> 00:35:20,097
You don't want to hear
what I have to say.

573
00:35:20,165 --> 00:35:22,326
Let me be
the judge of that.

574
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:29,900
I can't help
but think that...

575
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,303
you should
watch your girl, bro'.

576
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:38,076
I mean, she and Mike spend
an awful lot of time together.

577
00:35:38,149 --> 00:35:40,208
And so what?

578
00:35:40,285 --> 00:35:43,812
Hugo: All I'm saying is that
her and Mike are always together.

579
00:35:43,888 --> 00:35:46,789
And I know the Dean would rather
see Mike up in that piece.

580
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:48,951
How can you say some shit
like that to me, man?

581
00:35:49,027 --> 00:35:50,494
See, you're right.

582
00:35:50,562 --> 00:35:52,689
I shouldn't
have said nothing.

583
00:35:54,032 --> 00:35:55,659
Forget about it, man.

584
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:57,496
Mike's a good guy.

585
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:02,830
Wait, wait.

586
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:07,909
No, man, you can't say some shit
like that and just break out.

587
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:09,947
Odin:
What's going on, Dogs?

588
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:15,175
All right.

589
00:36:16,554 --> 00:36:22,459
You and Desi were going out for four
months before her father had a clue.

590
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:25,894
So obviously, the girl knows
how to keep a secret.

591
00:36:25,964 --> 00:36:28,626
You grew up in the hood, and
you've seen plenty of hustlers,

592
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,863
but the one thing I do know
better than you is white girls.

593
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:33,460
And white girls are snaky.

594
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:36,564
All right,
they're horny snakes.

595
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:38,666
They act like
we're the ones who want sex,

596
00:36:38,743 --> 00:36:40,802
but they want it
worse than us, man.

597
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:43,439
They're just subtle about
the way they go after it.

598
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:45,983
Hey, man,
my girl's not like that.

599
00:36:47,218 --> 00:36:49,778
Butjust think about the way
she played her father

600
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:51,845
when he found out
about you and her.

601
00:36:53,391 --> 00:36:55,382
What? Emily
said something to you?

602
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,453
Hugo: No, but she wouldn't,
because they stick together.

603
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:02,762
Hugo: There is one way
to find out, though.

604
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:05,701
- Yeah, like ask Mike.
- No,

605
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,102
because if there is
something going on--

606
00:37:09,173 --> 00:37:11,607
and I'm not saying that there
is something going on--

607
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:14,770
but if there is
something going on,

608
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:16,939
they're notjust
going to come clean.

609
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:19,108
Watch her.

610
00:37:19,183 --> 00:37:22,846
If she keeps hanging out with Mike,
if she keeps talking about Mike,

611
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:25,446
then we've got something
to think about.

612
00:37:26,658 --> 00:37:28,489
We don't let on, bro'.

613
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:31,722
We just watch.

614
00:38:32,357 --> 00:38:33,915
Mike: What's up, man?

615
00:38:37,195 --> 00:38:39,095
Hey, O,
what's that all about?

616
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:46,232
- Desi: Hey.
- Hey.

617
00:38:46,304 --> 00:38:47,601
I'm almost ready.

618
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:49,932
Cool.

619
00:38:51,509 --> 00:38:53,170
Just cool?

620
00:38:53,244 --> 00:38:55,178
I've been planning
this night for a month.

621
00:38:55,246 --> 00:38:56,907
Do you know what I had
to do to get that car?

622
00:38:56,981 --> 00:38:58,175
Odin: Yeah, I know.

623
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:02,719
- Do you have your pass?
- Uh-hmm.

624
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:06,312
What's wrong with you?

625
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:11,521
Desi: Hello?

626
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:12,995
Hey, D...

627
00:39:14,065 --> 00:39:16,829
you never used to go out
with Mike, like--

628
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:19,495
like before I got here or
anything like that, right?

629
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,266
Michael? He's like my best
friend, except for Emily.

630
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:25,766
But I thought
I was your best friend.

631
00:39:25,843 --> 00:39:29,904
Oh, does my baby feel like
he's got a little competition?

632
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:33,508
Come on, stop playing around.
Come on, stop!

633
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:35,074
Damn.

634
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:38,751
Let's just go, okay?

635
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:44,959
Did somebody
say something to you?

636
00:39:45,029 --> 00:39:46,963
No, let's just go.

637
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:05,082
Look, just give me the money.
It's only 1 00 bucks.

638
00:40:07,018 --> 00:40:08,042
This is it, dude.

639
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:09,381
I'm tapped out.

640
00:40:09,454 --> 00:40:11,217
Dad said
he won't send any more.

641
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,349
Then you'll have
to use his credit card.

642
00:40:14,425 --> 00:40:17,223
- We need a cell phone.
- What?

643
00:40:17,295 --> 00:40:20,492
If this is going to work,
we have to keep in constant contact.

644
00:40:20,565 --> 00:40:22,499
( knocking on door )

645
00:40:26,704 --> 00:40:28,001
Hey, guys.

646
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:32,871
Hey, Roger,
could you do me a favor?

647
00:40:32,944 --> 00:40:35,310
- Sure.
- Get lost.

648
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:48,516
I have something for you.

649
00:40:48,593 --> 00:40:50,823
You have things
for lots of guys.

650
00:40:58,436 --> 00:41:00,301
You're amazing.

651
00:41:01,706 --> 00:41:03,435
What are you going
to do with it?

652
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:06,033
Nothing.

653
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:10,342
I'm not going to keep it.
It's just a little prank.

654
00:41:10,414 --> 00:41:14,316
When it turns up missing,
she's going to go nuts.

655
00:41:16,587 --> 00:41:18,680
Hugo:
What would I do without you?

656
00:41:30,168 --> 00:41:33,103
All this time I've been
looking for romance,

657
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:35,901
and all I had to do
was steal something.

658
00:41:37,742 --> 00:41:40,006
You didn't steal anything.

659
00:41:41,712 --> 00:41:44,579
You just borrowed it
for a little while.

660
00:41:46,517 --> 00:41:49,782
And if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to borrow you.

661
00:42:23,688 --> 00:42:26,919
I want you to be able
to do anything.

662
00:42:26,991 --> 00:42:30,188
I want you to do
what you want with me.

663
00:42:31,262 --> 00:42:32,820
Yeah?

664
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:37,159
I want you to have me
however you want.

665
00:42:37,235 --> 00:42:41,171
Desi: I want to give myself
to you the way you want me.

666
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,207
Don't hold back.

667
00:42:58,556 --> 00:43:01,457
( heavy breathing )

668
00:44:19,704 --> 00:44:21,103
Ow!

669
00:44:21,172 --> 00:44:23,572
Odin, stop!

670
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:25,370
Stop!

671
00:44:26,644 --> 00:44:28,111
Stop!

672
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:29,771
( Desi crying )

673
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:31,178
No!

674
00:44:35,953 --> 00:44:37,648
( Desi screaming )

675
00:46:26,664 --> 00:46:29,394
Woman: ...purposely uses
this maternal imagery

676
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:31,697
to get him into
doing this dirty work.

677
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:36,103
''I have given suck and know how tender
it is to love the babe that milks me.''

678
00:46:36,173 --> 00:46:41,770
Odin, did you give Desi
a scarf a while back?

679
00:46:41,846 --> 00:46:44,076
Odin: Yeah.

680
00:46:44,148 --> 00:46:46,013
Hugo: It was
silk or something, right?

681
00:46:48,452 --> 00:46:50,215
Odin: Yeah,
I showed it to you.

682
00:46:50,287 --> 00:46:52,255
Teacher: Gentlemen.

683
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:58,158
Wait, you gave
that scarf to Desi?

684
00:46:58,229 --> 00:46:59,958
You know I did.

685
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:02,191
You want me
to give that to her?

686
00:47:02,266 --> 00:47:04,200
Hugo:
Don't tell her it's from me.

687
00:47:04,268 --> 00:47:08,102
I think I saw Michael with
that same scarf about an hour ago.

688
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:10,732
I'm not sure, but I'd swear
it was the same one.

689
00:47:10,808 --> 00:47:11,638
Thanks.

690
00:47:11,709 --> 00:47:14,644
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Teacher: Mr. Goulding, Mr. James,

691
00:47:14,712 --> 00:47:18,705
would either of you care to name
one of Shakespeare's poems?

692
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:21,545
Hugo:
I thought he wrote movies.

693
00:47:21,619 --> 00:47:25,077
- ( students chuckling )
- Perhaps you two should pay attention.

694
00:47:25,156 --> 00:47:28,523
That way, after you've won this
nationally televised championship,

695
00:47:28,592 --> 00:47:30,253
you'll have something
more profound to say.

696
00:47:30,327 --> 00:47:33,421
Emily: What do you mean, rough?
He forced you?

697
00:47:33,497 --> 00:47:35,021
Desi:
No, it wasn't like that.

698
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:37,158
We were already doing it.

699
00:47:37,234 --> 00:47:39,395
Emily:
Did you say ''stop''?

700
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:41,438
He didn't rape me.

701
00:47:41,505 --> 00:47:45,339
Desi, you know
I like O too, okay?

702
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:48,708
But you act like the guy's
a saint or something.

703
00:47:48,779 --> 00:47:50,508
Desi: Well,
maybe he's not a saint,

704
00:47:50,581 --> 00:47:53,709
but he's never done anything
even close to that before.

705
00:47:53,784 --> 00:47:55,718
Half the time, he doesn't
even want to do anything.

706
00:47:55,786 --> 00:47:57,686
He just lays naked with me.

707
00:47:57,755 --> 00:48:01,088
Emily:
Desi, you said stop.

708
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:12,866
Would you be so concerned
if he were white?

709
00:48:13,938 --> 00:48:15,872
That is so easy.

710
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,932
- ( knocking on door )
- Odin: D, it's me.

711
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:23,280
Desi: What are you doing?
It's after hours.

712
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:24,780
I know.

713
00:48:24,848 --> 00:48:27,078
I'm sorry.
I just had to see you.

714
00:48:29,553 --> 00:48:32,044
- How are you doing, Emily?
- Good.

715
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:35,455
Sorry, baby, no presents
for you this time.

716
00:48:35,526 --> 00:48:37,790
Desi: Where were you?
Michael was looking for you.

717
00:48:39,463 --> 00:48:41,090
Mike?

718
00:48:41,165 --> 00:48:42,826
Yeah, Michael.

719
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:46,660
Can I have a kiss?

720
00:48:52,676 --> 00:48:56,203
Hey, D, how come you never wear
that scarf I gave you?

721
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,339
Desi: I hadn't really
thought about it.

722
00:48:58,415 --> 00:49:00,975
- Odin: Can I see it real quick?
- Yeah.

723
00:49:05,489 --> 00:49:07,320
I keep it right here.

724
00:49:08,525 --> 00:49:11,050
- Odin: What, you lost it?
- No, it's here somewhere.

725
00:49:11,128 --> 00:49:14,894
My mamma gave me that scarf
when she got real sick.

726
00:49:14,965 --> 00:49:18,059
She said to make sure to give it
to someone very special,

727
00:49:18,135 --> 00:49:20,069
and it'd keep
our love right.

728
00:49:20,137 --> 00:49:22,628
I'm sure it'll turn up
around here somewhere.

729
00:49:22,706 --> 00:49:25,766
- Could you look some more?
- Emily: She'll find it later.

730
00:49:25,843 --> 00:49:29,574
- Odin: Come on, I'll help you.
- No, I'll find it later.

731
00:49:29,647 --> 00:49:31,911
Right now, I really want
to talk about Michael.

732
00:49:31,982 --> 00:49:35,110
He deserves to play,
and he's your best friend.

733
00:49:35,185 --> 00:49:38,814
- That's all he talks about.
- I need you to find that scarf.

734
00:49:38,889 --> 00:49:40,880
And I said
I'll find it later.

735
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:42,721
Hey, D...

736
00:49:43,894 --> 00:49:47,330
you'd never give out no love
behind my back, now would you?

737
00:49:47,398 --> 00:49:49,889
I mean, maybe
I'm not enough for you.

738
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:54,131
You know, especially with you
being all hot and shit.

739
00:49:54,204 --> 00:49:55,501
What?

740
00:49:55,572 --> 00:49:57,540
You know
what I'm talking about.

741
00:49:57,608 --> 00:50:01,044
Hey, Em, you've got
to see this girl in action--

742
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:03,477
Are you kidding me?!
That's really shitty!

743
00:50:03,547 --> 00:50:05,572
Okay.
But check this.

744
00:50:05,649 --> 00:50:07,742
If you were a virgin
like you said you were,

745
00:50:07,818 --> 00:50:10,218
how come when we're doing it
you're acting all freaky,

746
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:12,812
telling me I could do
whatever I want with you?

747
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:15,358
- I don't need to be here right now.
- Odin: No, Em.

748
00:50:15,426 --> 00:50:18,793
- Emily: I don't think you do either.
- That is not what I meant!

749
00:50:18,862 --> 00:50:22,093
- What's wrong with you?
- Look, let's just find the scarf.

750
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:25,158
- Emily's going to help us.
- What if Emily doesn't want to?

751
00:50:25,235 --> 00:50:26,827
I think you should go.

752
00:50:26,904 --> 00:50:29,429
- Where is my scarf?
- I don't know.

753
00:50:29,506 --> 00:50:31,531
- You lost it.
- No, I'll find it later.

754
00:50:31,608 --> 00:50:34,634
Does Mike know where my scarf is?
Is that why you want me to talk to him?

755
00:50:34,712 --> 00:50:36,339
What?

756
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:40,645
If you want to ask me if I'm cheating
on you, get some balls and ask.

757
00:50:40,718 --> 00:50:42,845
No, I'm not! Michael?!

758
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,856
You're the only person I've ever
been with and want to be with.

759
00:50:46,924 --> 00:50:50,883
And if you want to be with me,
don't ever talk to me like that again.

760
00:50:53,797 --> 00:50:56,527
I'm always
straight with you, O.

761
00:51:09,313 --> 00:51:12,407
Duke: Two on one half break.
Let's go! Let's go!

762
00:51:12,483 --> 00:51:14,212
Push it!
Push it! Push it!

763
00:51:16,887 --> 00:51:19,082
- ( whistling )
- Duke: Hugo!

764
00:51:19,156 --> 00:51:21,920
For Christ's sake,
look where you are!

765
00:51:21,992 --> 00:51:24,927
Look where the basket is!
Protect the basket!

766
00:51:24,995 --> 00:51:27,555
It's two on one fast break!
What, are you deaf?

767
00:51:27,631 --> 00:51:31,089
Odin, where are you? At some picnic?
We've got 1 0 full minutes.

768
00:51:31,168 --> 00:51:33,830
Let's make it count!
Come on, stack it up!

769
00:51:33,904 --> 00:51:36,896
- Come on, man, stack it up!
- Duke: Let's go!

770
00:51:40,978 --> 00:51:43,139
Come on! Push it!

771
00:51:44,782 --> 00:51:46,613
( whistling )

772
00:51:46,683 --> 00:51:48,344
Give me the ball.
Give me the ball!

773
00:51:48,419 --> 00:51:49,386
Damn it!

774
00:51:49,453 --> 00:51:52,616
You guys are lolly-gagging
the ball up and down the court

775
00:51:52,689 --> 00:51:54,418
like a bunch of snails.

776
00:51:54,491 --> 00:51:56,220
You play this way
come game night,

777
00:51:56,293 --> 00:51:59,592
you won't beat the Sisters of Mercy!
All right, Michael,

778
00:51:59,663 --> 00:52:01,358
come in here
and run the point.

779
00:52:01,432 --> 00:52:04,299
Odin, why don't you
take your nap on the bench?

780
00:52:04,368 --> 00:52:06,063
It's more comfortable.
Let's go, Michael.

781
00:52:06,136 --> 00:52:08,536
I said let's go!
You've got eight minutes.

782
00:52:19,116 --> 00:52:21,107
What's your fucking
problem, man?

783
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:24,484
Duke: Get back here
and apologize! Odin!

784
00:52:25,656 --> 00:52:29,251
Odin! Get your ass back
here and apologize.

785
00:52:35,365 --> 00:52:37,162
Jeff, run the team.

786
00:52:37,234 --> 00:52:39,600
- ( whistling )
- Come on, guys.

787
00:52:47,177 --> 00:52:48,769
Hey, Pop.

788
00:52:48,846 --> 00:52:50,438
Duke: Have a seat.

789
00:53:00,858 --> 00:53:05,056
It's been a while since
you invited me in for dinner.

790
00:53:05,128 --> 00:53:07,255
Duke:
What is going on with Odin?

791
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,136
I don't know.

792
00:53:19,376 --> 00:53:22,368
I saw him in class today.
He seemed all right.

793
00:53:24,915 --> 00:53:27,509
By the way, I'm getting
an A in English again.

794
00:53:27,584 --> 00:53:30,348
Duke: That's great, son.
Congratulations.

795
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:34,083
You know I don't ever have
to worry about you, thank God.

796
00:53:34,157 --> 00:53:38,389
You've always done well and
you always will, but Odin's different.

797
00:53:38,462 --> 00:53:40,692
He's all alone here.

798
00:53:40,764 --> 00:53:44,200
There's not even another Black student
in this whole damn place.

799
00:53:44,268 --> 00:53:46,395
We're his family.

800
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:50,736
I want you to keep an eye on him,
find out what's going on.

801
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:53,942
- Sure, Pop.
- All right...

802
00:53:54,011 --> 00:53:56,309
cause if he's
got a problem,

803
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,314
we've got a problem.

804
00:54:02,486 --> 00:54:04,215
All right, Dad.

805
00:54:08,992 --> 00:54:12,257
You know, your motherjust
doesn't understand us.

806
00:54:24,341 --> 00:54:26,536
You stay here
and finish your supper.

807
00:54:55,939 --> 00:54:57,702
Announcer: The state finals
are a few days away,

808
00:54:57,774 --> 00:54:59,901
and Palmetto Grove comes in
as a heavy favorite.

809
00:54:59,977 --> 00:55:03,003
Coach Duke Goulding,
or The Duke, as he is called,

810
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,241
has got to be even more
jittery than the players.

811
00:55:05,315 --> 00:55:08,876
A win right here could pave the way
for a position at the college level.

812
00:55:08,952 --> 00:55:10,613
But first, you're about
to see something

813
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:13,087
that might make the NBA's
finest a little bit nervous.

814
00:55:13,156 --> 00:55:15,021
And that's why
all the scouts are here.

815
00:55:15,092 --> 00:55:18,152
It's the Southeast regional
high school slam dunk contest.

816
00:55:18,228 --> 00:55:20,423
And young legs
mean lots of air.

817
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:34,674
- What's up, man?
- What's up with you?

818
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,445
You got that for me?

819
00:55:38,515 --> 00:55:41,780
- This ain't your style, player.
- It ain't gonna be.

820
00:55:41,852 --> 00:55:44,082
I just ain't slept
in a couple of days.

821
00:55:44,154 --> 00:55:48,181
Why the fuck are you worried?
Give me the shit and get your ass on.

822
00:55:48,258 --> 00:55:49,850
Money's for customers.

823
00:55:49,926 --> 00:55:52,019
This is a one-time
thing, right?

824
00:56:09,546 --> 00:56:12,674
You're going to have
to get in line, I'm afraid.

825
00:56:12,749 --> 00:56:15,775
Every conference in the country's
been after this kid,

826
00:56:15,852 --> 00:56:19,288
including the ACC,
the Big Twelve, Pac Ten, Big Ten.

827
00:56:19,356 --> 00:56:20,914
I hope you don't think
you're sitting there.

828
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,926
- Bye. Good seeing you.
- I had this seat with Hugo.

829
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:28,829
Well, Hugo's not here,
and I'm telling you to get lost.

830
00:56:28,899 --> 00:56:32,960
- Later, Roger, as in peace.
- Jason, stop. Leave him alone.

831
00:56:33,036 --> 00:56:34,469
Michael, come on.

832
00:56:34,538 --> 00:56:35,971
Go ahead and
keep sitting there.

833
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:39,372
- Maybe I won't kick your ass again.
- Desi: It's okay.

834
00:56:39,443 --> 00:56:40,808
You can sit there.
It's fine.

835
00:56:40,877 --> 00:56:43,471
- Faggot. Tag along, faggot.
- Jason!

836
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:45,538
Jason: Go sit
with some other friends.

837
00:56:45,615 --> 00:56:47,913
Oh, you don't have any.
Everybody hates you.

838
00:56:47,984 --> 00:56:51,283
Stupid tag-along.
Get lost.

839
00:56:51,354 --> 00:56:53,049
Flea.

840
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:56,024
- Fucking faggot.
- Mike: Fuck off.

841
00:56:57,094 --> 00:57:01,224
- Loser. Fucking loser.
- Get out of here, Roger.

842
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:05,966
It hurts, doesn't it?
Then get lost.

843
00:57:25,088 --> 00:57:28,285
You've got five minutes.
What's going on?

844
00:57:28,358 --> 00:57:30,656
You really
fucked me up, man.

845
00:57:30,727 --> 00:57:33,127
- Me?
- Yeah, you, bitch!

846
00:57:33,196 --> 00:57:38,998
If I knew Desi was going behind
my back, I could deal with that.

847
00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:42,527
But all this wondering you got me
going through is bullshit!

848
00:57:42,606 --> 00:57:44,437
You can't be thinking
about that now.

849
00:57:47,544 --> 00:57:50,104
I'm going to tell you
like this, Hugo.

850
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:55,982
You better hope and pray you can
prove that Mike is fucking Desi.

851
00:57:56,052 --> 00:57:58,111
You understand me?!

852
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,851
( Hugo coughing )

853
00:58:02,926 --> 00:58:05,861
Hugo: I try to help my friend
and this is what I get?

854
00:58:05,929 --> 00:58:08,454
Why don't you just
fucking forget about it?

855
00:58:08,532 --> 00:58:11,000
I mean,
you fucking got everything.

856
00:58:11,067 --> 00:58:14,298
I would give my left nut
to be in your shoes.

857
00:58:17,841 --> 00:58:19,502
Fuck Desi!

858
00:58:19,576 --> 00:58:23,376
She's not some gold medal you need
to win! You're the medal!

859
00:58:23,446 --> 00:58:26,176
From the first time I saw her--

860
00:58:28,285 --> 00:58:31,982
the only reason I ever wanted
to do something big

861
00:58:33,056 --> 00:58:36,992
was so she'd be proud
to stand next to me.

862
00:58:38,295 --> 00:58:39,922
Shit.

863
00:58:41,031 --> 00:58:43,829
Look, is she cheating on me
or not?! What the fuck?

864
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,868
Hugo: Let's talk about this
after you win this thing.

865
00:58:45,936 --> 00:58:49,895
Don't you hold back
on me, Hugo. Not now.

866
00:58:49,973 --> 00:58:52,203
- Hugo: Come on.
- No, you come on, bitch!

867
00:58:54,411 --> 00:58:58,040
- What, are you going to hit me?
- I will if you don't speak to me.

868
00:58:58,114 --> 00:59:02,210
I don't know if it's true, but he told
me they were together last night

869
00:59:02,285 --> 00:59:05,686
- and I don't know what else.
- God damn it.

870
00:59:05,755 --> 00:59:07,780
Hugo: That's all
I'm saying for now.

871
00:59:07,858 --> 00:59:10,326
We can get together tonight
and talk about this.

872
00:59:15,031 --> 00:59:16,999
They don't know
who they're fucking with.

873
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:18,364
What's that?

874
00:59:19,803 --> 00:59:22,135
I said they don't know
who they're fucking with.

875
00:59:24,274 --> 00:59:26,538
Odin: They don't know
who they're fucking with!!

876
00:59:38,054 --> 00:59:39,988
( applause )

877
00:59:42,459 --> 00:59:43,892
Better hurry up, son.
You're late.

878
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,484
Knock them dead.

879
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:09,916
- Odin James.
- Okay,

880
01:00:09,986 --> 01:00:12,978
highest score is 50.
You get one minute to do three dunks.

881
01:00:13,056 --> 01:00:14,648
I'm only doing one.

882
01:00:14,724 --> 01:00:17,318
- What?
- I'm only doing one.

883
01:00:17,394 --> 01:00:19,157
Woman: But you get
to throw out the two lowest.

884
01:00:19,229 --> 01:00:22,289
Announcer: And now,
our very own Odin James.

885
01:00:22,365 --> 01:00:24,060
( cheering )

886
01:00:27,437 --> 01:00:31,066
Grab yourjockstraps, gentlemen.
He's about to blow you away.

887
01:01:08,378 --> 01:01:10,403
Crowd: Go! Go! Go!

888
01:01:25,295 --> 01:01:26,557
Wow, he dunked it!

889
01:01:27,764 --> 01:01:30,232
I didn't think
he could do that anymore.

890
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,927
( cheering )

891
01:01:40,677 --> 01:01:42,838
Crowd: Go! Go! Go!

892
01:01:59,262 --> 01:02:00,820
Ball boy: Yo, man,
that dunk was all that,

893
01:02:00,897 --> 01:02:02,728
- but I need the ball back, kid.
- What?

894
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:06,257
- The ball, homey. Give it up.
- This ball right here, shorty?

895
01:02:06,336 --> 01:02:08,600
No, nigger, the balls
hanging under your dick.

896
01:02:08,671 --> 01:02:10,298
Watch your fucking mouth.
Who are you talking to?

897
01:02:15,445 --> 01:02:17,413
( crowd booing )

898
01:02:24,888 --> 01:02:26,788
( crowd roaring )

899
01:02:32,829 --> 01:02:34,854
( crowd booing )

900
01:03:11,768 --> 01:03:15,169
Duke: I'm just asking
for one last game, Bob.

901
01:03:15,238 --> 01:03:17,638
Brable: One game for whom?
For you...

902
01:03:17,707 --> 01:03:19,470
or for him?

903
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:23,171
Because he's lucky
he's not suspended.

904
01:03:23,246 --> 01:03:26,977
Hugo: Yeah, Dad,
who's your favorite now?

905
01:03:39,129 --> 01:03:41,324
Hugo: I'm going
to take care of you, man.

906
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:48,699
This shit right here...
will help you make it through.

907
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:55,602
Odin: I don't want
to be doing this.

908
01:03:55,678 --> 01:03:59,774
Just making it through, player.
Just making it through.

909
01:04:29,746 --> 01:04:32,340
Hugo: So, while the shit
was going down tonight,

910
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:34,940
I was doing
some detective work.

911
01:04:36,486 --> 01:04:39,649
Mike says half the time,
she doesn't want to have sex.

912
01:04:40,924 --> 01:04:43,484
She just wants
to lay naked in the bed.

913
01:04:45,728 --> 01:04:47,719
But they're fucking, O.

914
01:04:47,797 --> 01:04:50,664
And they have been
for over a month now.

915
01:04:50,733 --> 01:04:52,826
They do it in her room.

916
01:04:52,902 --> 01:04:54,802
And there's
one more thing...

917
01:04:54,871 --> 01:04:57,772
Don't get mad at me
for saying this, but...

918
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:03,675
they call you
''the nigger,'' man.

919
01:05:06,616 --> 01:05:09,414
Desi wouldn't say
nothing like that, man.

920
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,285
( knocking on door )

921
01:05:12,355 --> 01:05:14,482
Shit.

922
01:05:19,762 --> 01:05:22,959
- Hugo: Hey.
- What's the matter?

923
01:05:23,032 --> 01:05:25,728
Nothing.
What do you want?

924
01:05:25,802 --> 01:05:28,236
Man, I just need
to talk to you.

925
01:05:28,304 --> 01:05:31,034
I'm a little busy.
Just give me two minutes.

926
01:05:32,108 --> 01:05:34,303
- All right, but--
- Give me two minutes, all right?

927
01:05:34,377 --> 01:05:35,844
Wait here.

928
01:05:40,984 --> 01:05:43,009
Hugo:
Hey, O. That's Mike.

929
01:05:43,086 --> 01:05:45,987
He wants to talk
to me about Desi.

930
01:05:46,055 --> 01:05:49,650
Listen, I'm going
to ask him what's up.

931
01:05:49,726 --> 01:05:52,058
All right?
You can hear for yourself.

932
01:05:55,331 --> 01:05:56,958
Come on,
let's take it out here.

933
01:05:57,033 --> 01:06:01,902
Hugo, you're my man
for life. Forever.

934
01:06:01,971 --> 01:06:04,337
Hugo: Just stay on the porch
no matter what he says.

935
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:08,104
Just stay on the bench.
Be quiet, all right?

936
01:06:12,982 --> 01:06:15,280
Hey, man, what have you got
going on here?

937
01:06:16,352 --> 01:06:17,842
What's up, big baller?

938
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,184
Mike:
Don't remind me of basketball.

939
01:06:20,256 --> 01:06:24,158
Hugo: So, you and Desi have been
spending a lot of time together.

940
01:06:24,227 --> 01:06:26,855
If you could just handle her
the way you handle Brandy,

941
01:06:26,929 --> 01:06:28,556
then you'd be in business.

942
01:06:28,631 --> 01:06:31,225
Mike:
That girl does whatever I say.

943
01:06:31,301 --> 01:06:32,996
She might be
in love with me, though.

944
01:06:33,069 --> 01:06:35,936
Hugo: I heard she thinks the two
of you are going to get married.

945
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:39,600
Mike: Yeah, right. Give me
some credit. She's a slut.

946
01:06:39,676 --> 01:06:42,611
Man, I was
at the library yesterday.

947
01:06:42,679 --> 01:06:44,078
She took me in the back.

948
01:06:44,147 --> 01:06:46,809
Hugo: In the freaking library?
No fucking way.

949
01:06:46,883 --> 01:06:49,613
Mike: And check this out.
She said, down the road,

950
01:06:49,686 --> 01:06:52,519
even if she's with somebody,
even if she's married,

951
01:06:52,588 --> 01:06:55,022
she said she'd do me
until the day she dies.

952
01:06:55,091 --> 01:06:56,786
Hugo: No fucking way.

953
01:06:56,859 --> 01:06:58,884
Mike:
She does follow me everywhere.

954
01:06:58,961 --> 01:07:00,428
Brandy:
Have you seen Michael?

955
01:07:00,496 --> 01:07:02,191
What about Odin?

956
01:07:02,265 --> 01:07:05,359
Mike: What about him?
He's a freaking loser.

957
01:07:05,435 --> 01:07:09,337
- The ghettojust popped out of him.
- Hugo: You don't have to go there.

958
01:07:09,405 --> 01:07:12,101
Listen, the nigger's
out of control.

959
01:07:12,175 --> 01:07:14,200
And I'm glad
he's off the team.

960
01:07:14,277 --> 01:07:17,178
And if he comes at me again,
I swear I'll kill his ass.

961
01:07:17,246 --> 01:07:20,909
- ( knocking )
- Brandy: Hugo, where's Michael?

962
01:07:20,983 --> 01:07:22,644
Hugo, I know Mike's in here.

963
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:25,847
- Open the door!
- Mike: Oh, boy.

964
01:07:25,922 --> 01:07:27,617
- Hugo: What's up?
- Hey.

965
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:28,748
What the hell do you
think you're doing,

966
01:07:28,825 --> 01:07:31,225
giving me something
you got from some other bitch?

967
01:07:31,294 --> 01:07:32,886
Mike: What?

968
01:07:32,962 --> 01:07:35,829
- Brandy: Asshole!
- What are you tripping about?

969
01:07:35,898 --> 01:07:37,559
- It's a present.
- Yeah?

970
01:07:37,633 --> 01:07:40,500
Well, I like presents
where I was the only owner!

971
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:44,165
Mike: Brandy.
You see what I have to deal with?

972
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,867
You want this?

973
01:07:56,352 --> 01:07:58,980
How are we going
to kill this motherfucker?

974
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,124
How are we going
to kill this motherfucker?

975
01:08:08,197 --> 01:08:10,097
That's a big step.

976
01:08:11,701 --> 01:08:13,931
What about Desi?

977
01:08:25,014 --> 01:08:27,642
Pawnbroker: I don't get people
in here with that kind of money.

978
01:08:27,717 --> 01:08:30,777
But it is
one hell of a watch.

979
01:08:30,853 --> 01:08:32,946
What are you looking
to get for it?

980
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:41,997
Hugo: You have any papers
on this .38?

981
01:08:42,064 --> 01:08:45,659
Pawnbroker: On what?
Don't even look in that case.

982
01:08:45,735 --> 01:08:49,535
Don't even think about it, unless
you're ready to pull out some ID.

983
01:08:51,841 --> 01:08:54,241
Listen,
you want that watch.

984
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:56,972
I want that pistol.

985
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,874
Hugo: You've been
everything to me, O.

986
01:09:26,943 --> 01:09:30,504
To me, you're not my friend,
you're my brother.

987
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:33,743
And when a brother
is wronged, so am I.

988
01:09:35,651 --> 01:09:37,551
I'm you, O.

989
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,417
I'm a part of you.

990
01:09:41,757 --> 01:09:45,090
The plan I've come up
with is flawless,

991
01:09:46,162 --> 01:09:48,255
planned out to the minute.

992
01:09:50,066 --> 01:09:54,696
I've spent the last few days
going over every detail and angle.

993
01:09:56,506 --> 01:09:59,202
All we have to do
is set this thing in motion

994
01:09:59,275 --> 01:10:01,470
and never look back.

995
01:10:02,545 --> 01:10:05,207
Tomorrow I'm going
to talk to my dad.

996
01:10:05,281 --> 01:10:09,274
I'm going to tell him me and Mike
will find our own way to the game.

997
01:10:09,352 --> 01:10:11,582
Hugo: I'll say we
want to get there early.

998
01:10:11,654 --> 01:10:14,452
We'll take Roger's car.

999
01:10:14,524 --> 01:10:16,424
You're going
to talk to Desi.

1000
01:10:18,027 --> 01:10:20,860
You'll tell her
you want to make up,

1001
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:24,093
a little love session
before the game.

1002
01:10:25,301 --> 01:10:28,361
She should be
alone in her room.

1003
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:30,769
Emily will
go on without her.

1004
01:10:31,941 --> 01:10:36,105
For it to work, we have to make
sure it looked like Michael did it.

1005
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:42,083
We'll leave behind
a little present.

1006
01:10:43,152 --> 01:10:45,712
At exactly 7:00PM,

1007
01:10:46,822 --> 01:10:48,881
you take out Desi...

1008
01:10:50,893 --> 01:10:53,521
and you plant Michael's glass.

1009
01:10:55,464 --> 01:10:58,592
When that's all done,
you call me on Roger's cellular.

1010
01:11:01,571 --> 01:11:04,631
We'll have a rental car
waiting on the side of the road.

1011
01:11:08,978 --> 01:11:10,707
When Mike gets out to help,

1012
01:11:12,782 --> 01:11:15,512
we'll make it
look like a suicide.

1013
01:11:40,676 --> 01:11:43,110
Then we all make our way
to the game on time.

1014
01:11:44,814 --> 01:11:46,304
I know my dad.

1015
01:11:46,382 --> 01:11:48,543
Without Mike,
he's got to play you.

1016
01:11:48,618 --> 01:11:50,711
So we win the game,

1017
01:11:51,787 --> 01:11:55,052
and we all swear
we never saw Mike or Desi at all.

1018
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:01,618
If we stick to the timetable,
this will work.

1019
01:12:01,697 --> 01:12:03,562
What about Roger?

1020
01:12:03,633 --> 01:12:06,966
Roger thinks you and
Desi are just breaking up.

1021
01:12:07,036 --> 01:12:10,233
But after it's all over,
I'll tell him.

1022
01:12:10,306 --> 01:12:13,798
He'll be so scared,
he'll go along with whatever I say.

1023
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:17,411
And if he doesn't?

1024
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:21,314
You said you're going all
the way with this thing, right?

1025
01:12:36,365 --> 01:12:38,458
About what time
was the car checked out?

1026
01:12:41,337 --> 01:12:42,361
Yeah.

1027
01:12:42,438 --> 01:12:43,996
All right.
Yeah, thank you.

1028
01:12:44,073 --> 01:12:46,303
Okay.
I appreciate it. Bye.

1029
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:51,509
- Herb's on time, so far.
- ( knocking )

1030
01:12:56,018 --> 01:12:57,315
All right.

1031
01:13:03,392 --> 01:13:07,294
Hey, man. Man, it's
game time, baby. Let's do it.

1032
01:13:07,963 --> 01:13:10,124
Hugo: A little
pep-up for the road?

1033
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:12,724
No, I can't.
Not tonight.

1034
01:13:12,802 --> 01:13:14,360
Oh Mike, come on.

1035
01:13:14,437 --> 01:13:17,065
This is my last game
as a Hawk, bro'.

1036
01:13:17,139 --> 01:13:18,936
I'm too nervous, man.

1037
01:13:22,278 --> 01:13:25,611
We shall go no more
roving so late into the night.

1038
01:13:25,681 --> 01:13:28,616
- Mike: Look, man, I can't.
- Mike.

1039
01:13:28,684 --> 01:13:31,414
All right.

1040
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:39,953
Oh, fuck! I'm supposed
to meet with Brandy.

1041
01:13:40,029 --> 01:13:42,554
- She was going to ride with us.
- Not anymore, comrade.

1042
01:13:42,631 --> 01:13:45,600
Hugo: She's got wheels.
Don't worry about it.

1043
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,613
Emily: You sure
you don't want me to wait?

1044
01:14:06,689 --> 01:14:09,954
- Save me a seat.
- Okay.

1045
01:14:10,025 --> 01:14:11,993
Later.

1046
01:14:46,962 --> 01:14:49,453
Man, you're driving
like my grandmother.

1047
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:54,302
Come on, man.
The Duke is going to kill us.

1048
01:15:18,561 --> 01:15:20,392
Hugo: Did you see
that car back there?

1049
01:15:20,462 --> 01:15:21,793
What?

1050
01:15:24,266 --> 01:15:25,824
Hugo: The one with
the flashing lights.

1051
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:29,997
- The guy might be in trouble.
- No, no way, man.

1052
01:15:30,072 --> 01:15:32,040
We're going
to miss warm-ups.

1053
01:15:32,107 --> 01:15:35,508
It'll take a second to check out.
It's going to be freezing tonight.

1054
01:15:35,578 --> 01:15:37,443
We've got to check it out.

1055
01:15:39,048 --> 01:15:40,709
( cheering )

1056
01:15:48,157 --> 01:15:51,684
Send someone over to check
on their rooms. Hurry!

1057
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,523
Let's go,
lads, let's go!

1058
01:15:53,596 --> 01:15:57,123
Duke, this is Mr. Bradley, head of
the Game Council Athletic Department.

1059
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:59,258
Duke: Yes, sir. It's
a pleasure to meet you.

1060
01:15:59,335 --> 01:16:02,133
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've been following you all year,

1061
01:16:02,204 --> 01:16:03,762
and you've done
a greatjob.

1062
01:16:03,839 --> 01:16:06,103
Thanks very much.
I appreciate that.

1063
01:16:06,175 --> 01:16:08,166
I wouldn't mind helping
you guys out next season.

1064
01:16:08,244 --> 01:16:12,647
I hear that. I'd like to talk
to the Odin kid, if any way possible.

1065
01:16:12,715 --> 01:16:15,707
Duke: Sir, the whole world
would like to talk to Odin.

1066
01:16:15,784 --> 01:16:17,615
Bradley: Saw him
in the North Charleston semis,

1067
01:16:17,686 --> 01:16:21,452
he lacerated their defense.
Nobody's done that all year.

1068
01:16:21,523 --> 01:16:24,856
- Duke: He had some good coaching.
- Bradley: I'd have to agree.

1069
01:16:24,927 --> 01:16:26,827
- Let's talk after the game.
- Duke: All right, sir.

1070
01:16:26,896 --> 01:16:29,023
Bradley: He'd sure look good
in that garnet and black.

1071
01:16:30,099 --> 01:16:33,227
- Did you comp his ticket?
- Yes, I did.

1072
01:16:33,302 --> 01:16:34,667
Duke: Come on, lads, let's go.

1073
01:16:34,737 --> 01:16:36,671
Come on, sweat it up.

1074
01:16:54,723 --> 01:16:56,554
Hey, mister,
you're all right?

1075
01:16:58,327 --> 01:16:59,624
Mike: What the fuck?!

1076
01:16:59,695 --> 01:17:01,925
Do it, Rog.
Do it.

1077
01:17:03,699 --> 01:17:04,893
Roger: Fuck!

1078
01:17:08,203 --> 01:17:10,364
Let it go!
Let it go!

1079
01:17:13,342 --> 01:17:15,207
Mike:
What the fuck, man?!

1080
01:17:15,277 --> 01:17:16,972
What's wrong
with you, man?

1081
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,708
Hugo: All right.

1082
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:23,883
Hugo: No!
Shit! Fuck, Rog.

1083
01:17:23,953 --> 01:17:28,720
It's got to look like
a fucking suicide! Fuck!

1084
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:32,557
I got him!
Just like you said.

1085
01:17:32,628 --> 01:17:35,096
I shot the fucker!
Now, we do it close.

1086
01:17:35,164 --> 01:17:38,099
Hugo: No, the cops can tell
someone else shot the first bullet.

1087
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:41,000
You herbed us!
You fucking herbed us!

1088
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:42,867
Hugo:
You fucking herbed us!

1089
01:17:42,938 --> 01:17:45,463
- Roger: Hugo, we have to go.
- Where's the scarf?

1090
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:47,065
- I gave it to you.
- Where's the scarf?

1091
01:17:47,142 --> 01:17:49,269
- We have to go.
- Where's the scarf?

1092
01:17:49,345 --> 01:17:52,746
- Let me get him off the road.
- Rog! Rog! Rog!

1093
01:17:52,815 --> 01:17:56,410
When that car gets here, I'll tell
them you shot him in self-defense.

1094
01:17:56,485 --> 01:17:58,578
He attacked you and
you shot him in self-defense.

1095
01:17:58,654 --> 01:18:00,713
If he wakes up,
he's going to tell on me.

1096
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:07,123
It won't matter, Rog.
Desi's dead. I'm sorry, bro'.

1097
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:19,830
What time is it?

1098
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:36,453
Hold on! Hold on!

1099
01:18:36,525 --> 01:18:40,359
Brandy,
call 91 1 , okay?

1100
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:42,761
Roger hit Michael with a crow bar
and then Michael shot him.

1101
01:18:58,714 --> 01:19:00,545
- Hugo: Brandy, help me!
- Oh, my God!

1102
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:03,710
I need your help!
We need to get him to a hospital!

1103
01:19:03,786 --> 01:19:06,914
Come on, Brandy,
you need to help me.

1104
01:19:06,989 --> 01:19:08,980
Come on, Brandy!

1105
01:19:09,058 --> 01:19:10,525
Brandy!

1106
01:19:10,592 --> 01:19:11,752
Fuck!

1107
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:06,439
I'm sorry.

1108
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:19,926
I'm sorry.

1109
01:20:22,464 --> 01:20:23,954
Odin.

1110
01:20:53,629 --> 01:20:56,189
- ( Desi gasping )
- I saw Mike with the scarf.

1111
01:20:56,265 --> 01:20:57,994
He's dead.

1112
01:20:58,066 --> 01:21:00,057
He told me
you were with him.

1113
01:21:00,135 --> 01:21:02,160
( sobbing )
Now he's dead.

1114
01:21:02,237 --> 01:21:04,000
He's dead.

1115
01:21:06,275 --> 01:21:08,106
Odin: Stop. Stop.

1116
01:21:09,444 --> 01:21:12,242
I want to be able
to let you go, but I can't.

1117
01:21:12,314 --> 01:21:15,681
I wish I could,
but I can't. I can't.

1118
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:19,187
I can't. I can't.

1119
01:21:25,093 --> 01:21:26,219
Shh.

1120
01:21:26,295 --> 01:21:29,628
Shh. Shh.
Go to sleep.

1121
01:21:29,698 --> 01:21:32,166
Shh. Stop. Please.

1122
01:21:32,234 --> 01:21:34,225
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.

1123
01:21:34,303 --> 01:21:36,931
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

1124
01:21:39,641 --> 01:21:42,269
- Jason, have you seen Desi?
- Nope.

1125
01:21:42,344 --> 01:21:44,073
- What about Hugo?
- Uh-uh.

1126
01:21:44,146 --> 01:21:45,670
No?

1127
01:22:00,295 --> 01:22:02,661
- Emily: Desi?
- ( knocking )

1128
01:22:02,731 --> 01:22:03,663
Desi?

1129
01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:10,595
- Odin: Shh.
- Emily: Desi?

1130
01:22:22,217 --> 01:22:23,514
Hey.

1131
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:30,121
Brandy:
They killed him!

1132
01:22:30,192 --> 01:22:32,717
- They killed Michael!
- Jason: What are you talking about?

1133
01:22:32,794 --> 01:22:33,726
Hugo!

1134
01:22:33,795 --> 01:22:35,456
- Emily: You killed her?
- You shut up!

1135
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:37,998
- Odin: Shut up!
- Emily: You fucking killed her!

1136
01:22:38,066 --> 01:22:39,795
- Hugo: Hey.
- Emily: No!

1137
01:22:39,868 --> 01:22:41,096
Tell me Odin is lying.

1138
01:22:41,169 --> 01:22:44,696
Tell me you didn't say
Desi was cheating on him!

1139
01:22:44,773 --> 01:22:48,038
- I told him what I heard.
- That's a lie! Desi and Michael!?

1140
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:50,203
- You said she slept with him!?
- Emily, shut up!

1141
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:53,806
- Somebody get an ambulance!
- Fuck off! Get off her!

1142
01:22:53,882 --> 01:22:56,146
- Hugo: Emily!
- Odin: She was a ho'!

1143
01:22:56,218 --> 01:22:59,244
Desi was fucking Mike!
He admitted it!

1144
01:22:59,321 --> 01:23:03,223
And she gave him my scarf.
They were laughing at me!

1145
01:23:03,292 --> 01:23:04,919
Hugo, tell her!

1146
01:23:04,993 --> 01:23:07,223
- Odin: Tell her!
- Emily: That silk scarf?

1147
01:23:07,296 --> 01:23:08,923
Hugo:
Emily, be quiet.

1148
01:23:08,997 --> 01:23:10,897
No. No, Hugo.

1149
01:23:10,966 --> 01:23:13,958
- Shut the fuck up, Emily.
- Hugo had that scarf.

1150
01:23:14,036 --> 01:23:16,061
- Hugo: Emily.
- You begged me to steal it!

1151
01:23:16,138 --> 01:23:18,698
She's fucking lying, bro'.
She's lying.

1152
01:23:18,774 --> 01:23:20,833
Don't fucking pay
attention to her.

1153
01:23:20,909 --> 01:23:23,241
- You gave that scarf to Michael.
- Tell the truth!

1154
01:23:23,312 --> 01:23:26,179
- You gave that scarf to Michael!
- Tell the truth!

1155
01:23:26,248 --> 01:23:27,738
You gave
that scarf to Michael!

1156
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:43,498
( students screaming )

1157
01:23:47,502 --> 01:23:49,094
Jason: Stay down!

1158
01:24:05,954 --> 01:24:10,391
Odin: Jason,
ask him why he did this.

1159
01:24:10,459 --> 01:24:12,324
Ask him!

1160
01:24:12,394 --> 01:24:14,658
You won't ask me nothing.

1161
01:24:14,730 --> 01:24:17,597
Hugo: I did what I did.
That's all you need to know.

1162
01:24:22,003 --> 01:24:24,494
From here on,
I'll say nothing.

1163
01:24:24,573 --> 01:24:27,406
- ( police sirens blaring )
- Hugo...

1164
01:24:30,946 --> 01:24:32,470
- Jason: Hugo!
- ( students screaming )

1165
01:24:32,547 --> 01:24:34,071
Sit the fuck down!

1166
01:24:34,149 --> 01:24:37,983
Everybody sit down
and shut the fuck up!

1167
01:24:38,053 --> 01:24:40,385
Now, somebody
here knows the truth.

1168
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:43,822
Somebody needs
to tell the goddamn truth.

1169
01:24:43,892 --> 01:24:45,154
( woman weeping )

1170
01:24:45,227 --> 01:24:48,253
My life is over.
That's it.

1171
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:51,356
But while you're
all out here living yours,

1172
01:24:51,433 --> 01:24:55,392
sitting around, talking about the nigger
who lost it, back in high school,

1173
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:59,031
you make sure
you tell them the truth.

1174
01:24:59,107 --> 01:25:01,871
You tell them
I loved that girl.

1175
01:25:01,943 --> 01:25:03,968
I did.

1176
01:25:04,045 --> 01:25:05,410
But I got played.

1177
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:08,449
He twisted my head up.
He fucked it up.

1178
01:25:09,518 --> 01:25:11,884
I ain't no different
than none of you all.

1179
01:25:11,953 --> 01:25:13,921
My mom ain't no crack head.

1180
01:25:13,989 --> 01:25:15,854
I wasn't no gangbanger.

1181
01:25:15,924 --> 01:25:18,950
It wasn't some hood rat
drug dealer that tripped me up.

1182
01:25:19,027 --> 01:25:22,895
It was this white, prep school
motherfucker standing right there.

1183
01:25:22,964 --> 01:25:24,056
Police officer:
Put the gun down!

1184
01:25:24,132 --> 01:25:26,123
Come on, son!
Drop it! Put it down!

1185
01:25:26,201 --> 01:25:28,601
You tell them
where I'm from...

1186
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:30,535
didn't make me do this.

1187
01:25:51,026 --> 01:25:59,730
* Di tue materne viscere, Gesu *

1188
01:25:59,801 --> 01:26:12,509
* Prega per chi adorando
a te si prostra, *

1189
01:26:12,581 --> 01:26:26,825
* Prega nel peccator,
per l'innocente, *

1190
01:26:26,895 --> 01:26:37,601
* E pel debole oppresso
e pel possente, *

1191
01:26:37,672 --> 01:26:50,642
* Misero anch'esso,
tua pieta dimostra *

1192
01:26:53,188 --> 01:27:00,219
* Prega per chi
sotto l'oltraggio piega. *

1193
01:27:07,168 --> 01:27:10,535
Hugo: All my life,
I always wanted to fly.

1194
01:27:11,907 --> 01:27:14,899
I always wanted
to live like a hawk.

1195
01:27:26,755 --> 01:27:30,088
I know you're not supposed
to be jealous of anything, but...

1196
01:27:31,726 --> 01:27:33,387
to take flight,

1197
01:27:34,596 --> 01:27:37,360
to soar above
everything and everyone...

1198
01:27:39,901 --> 01:27:41,698
now, that's living.

1199
01:27:45,707 --> 01:27:48,801
But a hawk is no good
around normal birds.

1200
01:27:50,612 --> 01:27:52,512
It can't fit in.

1201
01:27:54,316 --> 01:27:57,843
Even though all the other birds
probably want to be hawks,

1202
01:27:59,588 --> 01:28:01,818
they hate him
for what they can't be--

1203
01:28:04,292 --> 01:28:05,554
proud,

1204
01:28:06,628 --> 01:28:08,653
powerful,

1205
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:10,254
determined,

1206
01:28:13,401 --> 01:28:14,925
dark.

1207
01:28:18,473 --> 01:28:20,407
Odin is a hawk.

1208
01:28:22,410 --> 01:28:24,275
He soars above us.

1209
01:28:27,382 --> 01:28:28,849
He can fly.

1210
01:28:37,559 --> 01:28:39,584
And one of these days,

1211
01:28:40,662 --> 01:28:43,324
everyone is going
to pay attention to me...

1212
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:54,404
because I'm going
to fly too.

1213
01:29:07,789 --> 01:29:15,161
* Nell'ora della morte *

1214
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:19,564
* Ave! *
