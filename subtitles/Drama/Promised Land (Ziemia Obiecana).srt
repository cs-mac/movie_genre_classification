1
00:01:55,558 --> 00:01:57,970
Fuck me, if he knows where we are.

2
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:00,038
You said it.

3
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,636
At least he hasn't led us to the enemy.

4
00:02:09,238 --> 00:02:12,651
Guys, we'll wait until the fog lifts.

5
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,948
It's too risky to carry on.

6
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:21,055
With you, even drinking coffee is risky.

7
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:24,254
What a guide!

8
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:27,366
You try to do better in this fog!

9
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,594
Listen to him! He's always happy.

10
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:33,136
The eternal optimist.

11
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:37,202
Know the difference between
a pessimist and an optimist?

12
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:41,074
- No, what?
- A pessimist thinks things can't be worse.

13
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:43,776
An optimist knows they can.

14
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,116
You and your crap jokes.
No one else finds them funny.

15
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:55,625
If you had any brains at all, you'd give up.

16
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,362
Oh, yeah? If I had any, I wouldn't be here.

17
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:03,132
I'd be a general or a UN official.

18
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:06,468
Or I'd open a restaurant.
What's that look for?

19
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,046
It would help my budget
if you smoked your own.

20
00:03:15,304 --> 00:03:19,275
- Since you're offering...
- Who the fuck am I? Mother Teresa?

21
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:25,258
Are you crazy?

22
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,728
You want them to see us?

23
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:31,060
Who's going to see us?
I can't even see my feet.

24
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,896
Put those cigarettes out! Put them out!

25
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:54,481
Hair in place?

26
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,233
He's something else!

27
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:15,873
First time at the front
and he dozes off before we get there.

28
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:18,545
Kids these days...

29
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,079
What?

30
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,491
- Any idea where we are?
- I reckon we should be there by now.

31
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:47,597
Dawn will soon be here and it'll be easier.

32
00:04:48,263 --> 00:04:53,269
I never took a relief squad
to the front at night before.

33
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:57,107
We got lucky...

34
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,214
Look!

35
00:06:04,473 --> 00:06:05,577
Look!

36
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,443
Shit...

37
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:40,084
Run!

38
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,186
SERBIAN LINES

39
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,261
You think they were trying
to take back the trench?

40
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,752
No, I don't think so.

41
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:27,924
- I think a relief squad got lost.
- Check it!

42
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:31,332
Yes, sir!

43
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:38,108
BOSNIAN LINES

44
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,669
What happened?

45
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,009
Our relief squad got lost in the fog.

46
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,483
- Are there any survivors?
- Shit!

47
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:57,091
I'll alert HQ. Call me if there's any change.

48
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:05,136
- If there's any change?
- Yes, if the dead start walking.

49
00:08:09,798 --> 00:08:13,075
I need two volunteers
to inspect the middle trench.

50
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:37,403
You, the new guy. Go with him.

51
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:40,167
Him? He doesn't even know
how to load a gun.

52
00:08:41,597 --> 00:08:43,804
Perfect. You can teach him.

53
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,808
Shit.

54
00:09:58,106 --> 00:09:59,278
Cera!

55
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:02,947
You don't need this.
Nor this, nor this, nor this.

56
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:08,478
My name's Nino.

57
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,020
Here.

58
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,963
If you notice anything, come straight back.

59
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:25,805
What's wrong?

60
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:28,099
- You scared?
- No.

61
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:33,303
They've got the sun in their eyes,
they can't see you.

62
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:37,783
If there's trouble,
wait until dark to come back.

63
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,226
Fucking hell.

64
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:28,760
Follow me, do what I do
and don't try to be clever.

65
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:30,894
Good luck.

66
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:10,722
Don't touch anything.
It might be booby-trapped.

67
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:13,641
Make a fucking effort...

68
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,622
Stop here.

69
00:17:31,326 --> 00:17:33,135
What are you doing?

70
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:36,869
Seeing as we have time,
let's have a little fun.

71
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:42,176
Look at it: "Made in EU."

72
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,141
My little baby.

73
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,520
What do you think it is?

74
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:51,023
- A mine.
- A bouncing mine!

75
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:53,624
When the enemy steps on it...

76
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:58,327
...what happens, according to you?

77
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:02,300
- It explodes.
- No, nothing happens.

78
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:06,501
But when the enemy steps off it,
it bounces up...

79
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:10,373
...and explodes
about three feet off the ground...

80
00:18:10,732 --> 00:18:15,647
...spraying out 2,000 lead bearings...

81
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:20,015
...that destroy everything
in a radius of 50 yards.

82
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:21,781
I'll show you.

83
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,646
Move this son of a bitch.

84
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:49,108
Gently.

85
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:55,245
Careful with the pin.

86
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:59,019
Lay the body down slowly,
otherwise you get blown up.

87
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:02,788
Go on, tug the wire now.

88
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,263
Me? Why me?

89
00:19:05,587 --> 00:19:08,932
Go on, don't worry,
as long as there's a weight...

90
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:11,593
Do it gently, that's all.

91
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:24,982
I can't.

92
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:27,147
Chicken!

93
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:37,658
See that?

94
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,763
I invented this.

95
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:46,638
When they pick up the body
the mine will blow them all to hell.

96
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,137
- What's your name again?
- Nino.

97
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,879
You'll set the next one.

98
00:19:57,939 --> 00:19:59,418
He looks asleep.

99
00:19:59,474 --> 00:20:03,217
That's because he's still fresh.
It won't last in this heat.

100
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:08,058
Try to sleep. We'll leave once it's dark.

101
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,256
Afterwards, we'll set more of these babies.

102
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:17,561
Where's that gun?

103
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:21,735
What gun?

104
00:21:53,821 --> 00:21:55,960
Where does this trench lead?

105
00:21:57,725 --> 00:21:59,534
Where does the trench lead?

106
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:12,244
Where does the trench lead?

107
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:14,709
Outside.

108
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:18,617
- Really? Where, outside?
- lnto the field.

109
00:22:23,084 --> 00:22:24,495
Is it mined?

110
00:22:27,689 --> 00:22:29,794
Where does the other one lead?

111
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,463
- I don't know.
- You don't know anything?

112
00:22:51,145 --> 00:22:52,385
Fuck...

113
00:23:01,322 --> 00:23:03,427
Don't touch that! Get back!

114
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:13,469
- How did you get here?
- We crawled.

115
00:23:13,835 --> 00:23:15,712
Across the field? You're lying!

116
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,315
I'm not. Your side was blinded by the sun.

117
00:23:19,474 --> 00:23:22,182
- And the mines?
- I don't know. He knew.

118
00:23:53,441 --> 00:23:55,045
Where's the map?

119
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:58,147
- What map?
- Of Bolivia, stupid. Of the mines!

120
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,750
- Empty your pockets.
- Why?

121
00:24:01,015 --> 00:24:03,928
Because I have a gun and you don't.
Come on.

122
00:24:12,426 --> 00:24:13,837
Is that all?

123
00:24:28,943 --> 00:24:30,115
Strip.

124
00:24:31,646 --> 00:24:33,683
- What?
- Strip.

125
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:35,653
Why?

126
00:24:35,716 --> 00:24:39,254
Are you stupid, or what?
Because I have a gun and you don't.

127
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,426
You may not have noticed,
but I'm in charge here.

128
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:49,107
I'm starving.

129
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:52,542
You're always starving.

130
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,913
- What's up?
- You have to see this.

131
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,353
What now?

132
00:25:13,621 --> 00:25:16,033
- What the hell's that?
- Is he ours?

133
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:20,861
It's not written on his boxers.
Call the officer.

134
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:25,003
- What do I tell him?
- That the dead are walking.

135
00:25:41,282 --> 00:25:43,057
Okay. Get down here.

136
00:25:47,822 --> 00:25:49,802
You hear me? Come down.

137
00:26:31,565 --> 00:26:32,737
He wasn't ours?

138
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:36,838
I've no idea. I only saw him for a second.

139
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:40,012
What a hawk-eye.

140
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,477
Let's not take any risks.

141
00:26:43,844 --> 00:26:46,552
Hello. Put me through to the artillery.

142
00:26:50,618 --> 00:26:53,827
- I can't see anything.
- He saw him, too.

143
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:58,193
- One of ours?
- God knows. He only had boxer shorts on.

144
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:19,281
Any other brilliant ideas?

145
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:22,857
If you piss me off, you go back out there.

146
00:27:32,093 --> 00:27:33,697
They've stopped.

147
00:27:36,998 --> 00:27:39,444
Sure. Yours never stop.

148
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,303
How about yours? Do they ever stop?

149
00:27:43,104 --> 00:27:45,607
You can't compare.
We didn't start the war.

150
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:47,377
And maybe we did?

151
00:27:47,441 --> 00:27:51,321
No! The Khmer Rouge!
All you can do is make war.

152
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:54,116
- Us'.7
- No, you're pacifists.

153
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:56,627
The Great Serbia,
all the way to the Pacific!

154
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:59,525
Please. The whole world thinks like me.

155
00:28:00,021 --> 00:28:01,932
What world? Your world!

156
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:06,731
You show our burned villages
and say they're yours.

157
00:28:06,794 --> 00:28:08,967
And that's my side shooting now?

158
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:13,303
You're all saints. Give it a rest.

159
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:15,404
You don't even leave the dead in peace.

160
00:28:16,003 --> 00:28:17,573
It's not the same.

161
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:22,452
Really? Laying mines under the dead,
pillaging, killing, raping, what's all that?

162
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,387
- Who are you talking about?
- You guys!

163
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:27,824
I haven't seen anything like what you say.

164
00:28:27,882 --> 00:28:31,386
I've seen it! I saw my village burn.

165
00:28:32,653 --> 00:28:35,259
- I don't know. I wasn't there.
- I was!

166
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:42,000
Haven't our villages burned, too?
Who killed our people?

167
00:28:43,364 --> 00:28:46,470
Your side, probably.
They just shot at you, too.

168
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:50,675
They only shot at me
because they didn't recognize me.

169
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:55,448
It's useless talking to you.

170
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,917
What the hell made you ruin
this beautiful country?

171
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,220
Us?
'Yes!

172
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:04,820
You're crazy.
You wanted to separate, not us.

173
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,456
Because you started the war!

174
00:29:08,522 --> 00:29:11,230
- You started it!
- What? Who started it?

175
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:14,569
You started the war! You started it!

176
00:29:14,995 --> 00:29:16,770
Who started the war?

177
00:29:20,067 --> 00:29:22,274
- We did.
- You started the war.

178
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:25,982
And stop pissing me off.
You're getting on my nerves.

179
00:29:27,575 --> 00:29:31,079
Get out! Come on, get out of here!

180
00:29:32,446 --> 00:29:33,618
Fuck.

181
00:29:35,216 --> 00:29:37,321
Daring to say it was us.

182
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,499
What was all that?

183
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:53,509
I'll alert HQ. Call me if there's any change.

184
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:11,221
- What now?
- Nothing. We wait till dark.

185
00:30:12,987 --> 00:30:14,261
And then?

186
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:18,632
Then, if you survive,
we'll crawl over to the lines.

187
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,297
And stop bothering me.

188
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:24,706
- So you're not going to free me.
- Dream on.

189
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:32,212
Cera, you're alive!

190
00:30:33,741 --> 00:30:35,118
Don't move!

191
00:30:36,076 --> 00:30:37,419
Don't move!

192
00:30:37,845 --> 00:30:40,689
There's a mine under you.
It could explode.

193
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:45,995
- What mine?
- A bounding one. Don't move.

194
00:30:48,522 --> 00:30:51,799
- Are you kidding me?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

195
00:30:55,462 --> 00:30:57,066
Come here. Defuse it.

196
00:31:01,268 --> 00:31:04,078
- You hear me? Defuse it!
- I don't know how.

197
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,586
Don't fool around. Defuse it!
I'm going to kill you! Defuse it!

198
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:13,257
If I try, I'll kill us all.

199
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:17,423
Fuck. What is this shit?

200
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,091
Ciki, what's happening?

201
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:25,503
They laid a mine under you
to ambush our guys.

202
00:31:25,826 --> 00:31:28,136
Only they could think of that!

203
00:31:28,629 --> 00:31:29,903
Kill him.

204
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:35,847
Kill the son of a bitch.

205
00:31:38,138 --> 00:31:40,277
Kill him or give me the gun!

206
00:31:44,245 --> 00:31:45,280
No.

207
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,889
We're not like them.

208
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:54,857
Besides, he could be useful.
Bring the water over.

209
00:32:05,699 --> 00:32:09,511
I can't give you too much.
I don't know where you're wounded.

210
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:15,618
Where does it hurt?

211
00:32:15,676 --> 00:32:18,418
My head and my arm.
My head's going to burst.

212
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:22,117
That's because of the detonation.
I'm the same. Hold on.

213
00:32:24,285 --> 00:32:26,162
What about the others?

214
00:32:31,058 --> 00:32:32,935
Don't let me die here.

215
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,401
Don't worry. Does it hurt anywhere else?

216
00:32:35,462 --> 00:32:36,566
No.

217
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:42,403
You lucky bastard.
You're unharmed. Just your arm.

218
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:44,039
And I thought you were dead.

219
00:32:44,438 --> 00:32:45,712
Can l...

220
00:32:46,106 --> 00:32:49,713
Throw the gun down.
Don't make me shoot. Throw it down!

221
00:32:52,212 --> 00:32:53,418
Get up.

222
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:56,856
Back off.

223
00:32:57,885 --> 00:32:59,159
Back off!

224
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:01,928
See what you've done! Get back!

225
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:15,208
What now?

226
00:33:15,903 --> 00:33:17,780
Now, we wait for dark.

227
00:33:22,843 --> 00:33:24,288
I have to dress his wound.

228
00:33:29,316 --> 00:33:31,296
Okay, but nice and easy.

229
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,696
If you fuck about...

230
00:33:36,423 --> 00:33:39,302
...I'll shoot without warning, you hear me?

231
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,342
Let me see your hands!

232
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:57,387
I told you to kill him.

233
00:33:58,479 --> 00:33:59,514
Shut up.

234
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,620
What are you saying?
Throw the knife away.

235
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,197
Throw the knife away!

236
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:12,899
Back off.

237
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,439
Give me those.

238
00:34:40,721 --> 00:34:42,257
Can I have one?

239
00:34:46,093 --> 00:34:47,094
Why?

240
00:34:48,495 --> 00:34:50,998
Because I have a gun and you don't.

241
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:54,903
- Sit down.
- We have to help him.

242
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,205
Sit down!

243
00:35:03,744 --> 00:35:05,485
By the way, who started the war?

244
00:35:12,753 --> 00:35:14,323
Who started the war?

245
00:35:20,027 --> 00:35:21,233
We did.

246
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:27,103
- You started the war.
- Who cares who started it?

247
00:35:27,868 --> 00:35:30,178
We're all in the same shit now.

248
00:35:30,904 --> 00:35:32,815
Can I have a cigarette?

249
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,725
What are you doing?

250
00:35:41,782 --> 00:35:43,455
- Don't move.
- Hold on!

251
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,121
- Put the gun down.
- Calm down!

252
00:35:45,252 --> 00:35:47,926
- Put it down!
- If I do, he'll kill me!

253
00:35:47,988 --> 00:35:51,765
- If you don't, we're fucked.
- No!

254
00:35:51,825 --> 00:35:53,532
I won't kill you, I promise.

255
00:35:53,594 --> 00:35:55,631
- No.
- Put the gun down.

256
00:35:56,396 --> 00:35:59,400
Calm down. Gently. Wait!

257
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,172
Okay...

258
00:36:01,668 --> 00:36:03,909
Okay, he takes the gun, but I keep mine.

259
00:36:04,304 --> 00:36:06,875
Ciki, take the gun.

260
00:36:08,342 --> 00:36:09,616
Slowly.

261
00:36:10,677 --> 00:36:11,917
Okay-

262
00:36:14,147 --> 00:36:15,649
Put it on your shoulder.

263
00:36:17,351 --> 00:36:19,331
Put it on your shoulder!

264
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,494
Okay-

265
00:36:26,026 --> 00:36:27,403
Don't move.

266
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,985
Put yours on your shoulder, too!

267
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,501
There, we're equal now.

268
00:37:30,357 --> 00:37:32,132
Here, for your head.

269
00:37:48,842 --> 00:37:50,719
Cut it out. Calm down.

270
00:37:52,913 --> 00:37:54,790
I'm fucking sick of this.

271
00:38:03,724 --> 00:38:04,998
What now?

272
00:38:06,526 --> 00:38:08,062
I have an idea.

273
00:38:08,729 --> 00:38:11,232
So do I. First, give me the cigarettes.

274
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,073
What is it?

275
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:17,780
- What's wrong?
- Fuck!

276
00:38:18,872 --> 00:38:20,749
What a mess in Rwanda.

277
00:38:22,242 --> 00:38:23,983
You're really nuts.

278
00:38:30,651 --> 00:38:32,289
I don't believe it.

279
00:38:32,953 --> 00:38:35,593
- What is it?
- There's two of them now.

280
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:39,168
- What are they yelling about?
- Call the officer.

281
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:53,818
Unbelievable.

282
00:38:54,574 --> 00:38:56,815
It's this morning's greenhorn.

283
00:38:58,145 --> 00:39:00,250
Call the UNPROFOR for me.

284
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,423
I've never seen anything like it.

285
00:39:05,686 --> 00:39:07,927
We ought to call the UNPROFOR.

286
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:10,991
I'll alert HQ.

287
00:39:19,633 --> 00:39:22,079
I hope those aren't my cigarettes.

288
00:39:23,036 --> 00:39:26,210
When I took them,
I didn't think you'd need them.

289
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:29,279
But now I hope...

290
00:39:34,047 --> 00:39:36,254
...that you'll die of cancer.

291
00:39:52,499 --> 00:39:53,603
Okay?

292
00:39:54,868 --> 00:39:56,370
You know what?

293
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,614
Maybe you shouldn't smoke today.

294
00:40:01,641 --> 00:40:03,245
Everything okay?

295
00:40:04,845 --> 00:40:07,883
You haven't told me your name.
My name's Nino.

296
00:40:11,251 --> 00:40:15,165
What's your problem?
You want what? An introduction?

297
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:18,998
To exchange phone numbers
and visiting cards?

298
00:40:19,726 --> 00:40:22,002
We don't need an introduction.

299
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:26,038
Next time we see each other,
it'll be through a gun's sight.

300
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:35,786
What's wrong with him?

301
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,052
Keep an eye on him.

302
00:41:01,802 --> 00:41:03,281
It's for you.

303
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,646
Call Arizona 2.

304
00:41:12,445 --> 00:41:15,824
Charlie Tango to Arizona 2, over.
Do you copy? Over.

305
00:41:19,786 --> 00:41:21,993
Arizona 2. loopy. Over.

306
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:26,766
I have your report.
Are they civilians or military?

307
00:41:28,428 --> 00:41:32,240
We do not have that information.
Request permission to check.

308
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:38,912
Negative! We must be sure
of the Sire-Bravo cease-fire, okay?

309
00:41:40,473 --> 00:41:42,146
Affirmative. Over.

310
00:41:43,143 --> 00:41:45,817
Do you know how many
need to be evacuated?

311
00:41:46,813 --> 00:41:48,349
Negative. Over.

312
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,857
Arizona 2, stay where you are.
I'll talk to my superiors.

313
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,362
Message received. Over and out.

314
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,239
- Why the fuck are we here?
- Good question.

315
00:42:03,296 --> 00:42:07,369
I reckon it's simple:
to stop the locals killing each other.

316
00:42:07,601 --> 00:42:11,344
Except we can't use force
or get into dangerous situations.

317
00:42:12,172 --> 00:42:14,209
I'm sick of just watching.

318
00:42:15,508 --> 00:42:17,112
Right, let's go.

319
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:20,587
- Georges, stay here.
- We can't leave like this.

320
00:42:20,647 --> 00:42:23,753
Stay if you want
and figure out why you're here.

321
00:42:55,015 --> 00:42:57,461
Don't fall asleep, you might move.

322
00:42:58,485 --> 00:43:00,590
How can I fall asleep...

323
00:43:02,722 --> 00:43:04,895
...with this shit under me?

324
00:43:05,759 --> 00:43:08,205
Fuck, why is this happening to me?

325
00:43:10,697 --> 00:43:14,406
We'll find a solution.
Try to think of something else.

326
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:16,847
Ciki...

327
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:20,349
Don't let me die here.

328
00:43:23,343 --> 00:43:25,789
Listen, I'm staying here with you.

329
00:43:27,213 --> 00:43:29,284
If you die, I die too.

330
00:43:30,116 --> 00:43:31,652
What a comfort!

331
00:43:32,252 --> 00:43:33,595
Come on.

332
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,794
I'll check what's happening.

333
00:44:17,931 --> 00:44:20,605
SERBIAN BARRICADE

334
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,380
Hello.

335
00:44:30,176 --> 00:44:33,248
- Do you speak French?
- French? No.

336
00:44:33,446 --> 00:44:34,891
- English?
- Yes.

337
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:40,126
- We came for people.
- Yes.

338
00:44:40,653 --> 00:44:42,360
- People, you know?
- Yes.

339
00:44:42,822 --> 00:44:44,324
People between lines.

340
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,803
- Where are they?
- Yes.

341
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:53,306
Okay, you understand nothing
of what I've said.

342
00:44:53,366 --> 00:44:54,367
Yes.

343
00:44:59,005 --> 00:45:00,848
You speak English?

344
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:03,176
No.

345
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:04,449
French?

346
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:10,160
We are here for people between lines.

347
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:16,362
- What's he saying?
- God knows, just say yes, yes.

348
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:21,636
Does anyone here know languages?

349
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,439
We are here, this place.

350
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:38,116
Where are the men?

351
00:45:41,481 --> 00:45:43,256
Here? Here people?

352
00:45:43,983 --> 00:45:45,291
Soldiers?

353
00:45:46,886 --> 00:45:49,628
- Any mine?
- No mine.

354
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:51,866
- You sure?
- No mine.

355
00:45:54,494 --> 00:45:56,132
We go now.

356
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,905
Okay? We go, you don't shoot.

357
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:01,938
Shoot, no. Nobody shoots.

358
00:46:02,569 --> 00:46:04,480
- Yeah.
- Okay, thank you.

359
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:11,246
Tell HQ the UNPROFOR is here.

360
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:14,258
I don't want anybody shooting.
Is that clear?

361
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:22,127
- Sorry about earlier.
- You were right.

362
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:27,103
Why get acquainted
to watch each other through sights?

363
00:46:28,561 --> 00:46:32,236
- In any case, thanks for the idea.
- Let's hope it works.

364
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:37,441
What's going on? Think they understood?

365
00:46:41,074 --> 00:46:44,351
- How is he?
- How do you expect him to be?

366
00:46:45,245 --> 00:46:48,089
- Have you known him long?
- Since the war.

367
00:46:49,782 --> 00:46:52,524
Since the beginning of this fucking war.

368
00:46:52,652 --> 00:46:54,962
What about you and the old man?

369
00:46:56,256 --> 00:46:58,361
I don't even know his name.

370
00:47:00,226 --> 00:47:01,796
You're from Banja Luka.

371
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:04,671
How do you know? Yeah, right.

372
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:10,679
I had a chick in Banja Luka. Sanja.

373
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:13,684
I knew a Sanja, too.

374
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,381
- She had...
- This one, too.

375
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:19,917
- Blonde.
- Yes.

376
00:47:19,979 --> 00:47:21,014
- Tall.
- Yes.

377
00:47:21,347 --> 00:47:22,826
With a beauty spot.

378
00:47:23,283 --> 00:47:25,285
- Sanja Cengic!
- I was at school with her.

379
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:27,092
- No kidding?
- I swear.

380
00:47:29,122 --> 00:47:30,533
- Cera!
- Yeah.

381
00:47:30,623 --> 00:47:33,126
He knows the Sanja I mentioned!

382
00:47:33,793 --> 00:47:35,295
Brilliant.

383
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,706
What's become of her?

384
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:43,140
She's gone abroad.

385
00:47:46,272 --> 00:47:47,945
I don't blame her.

386
00:47:52,779 --> 00:47:55,350
BOSNIAN BARRICADE

387
00:48:01,821 --> 00:48:04,859
- Hello. Do you speak French?
- No, English.

388
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:10,298
- Okay, we are here for people...
- Yes, we called. You can go.

389
00:48:10,363 --> 00:48:12,365
- It's okay? We go?
- Go.

390
00:48:13,032 --> 00:48:16,104
- Any mines there?
- We didn't put any.

391
00:48:18,304 --> 00:48:19,942
Okay. Go ahead.

392
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,824
- Sarajevo on line.
- Hello, Col. Soft speaking.

393
00:48:37,023 --> 00:48:40,664
- Hello, sir. This is Capt. Dubois.
- How can I help you?

394
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:44,872
It's the first time that the two camps
are asking me for the same thing...

395
00:48:44,931 --> 00:48:47,036
...and I don't know what to do.

396
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,445
Why are you asking me
and not your superiors?

397
00:48:50,503 --> 00:48:53,973
They are all in Geneva
for a seminar on media relations.

398
00:48:54,907 --> 00:48:58,286
It seems from your report that these men...

399
00:48:58,344 --> 00:49:01,382
...are stranded between the two front lines.

400
00:49:01,447 --> 00:49:04,894
But we don't even know
if they are soldiers or not. Is that right?

401
00:49:05,618 --> 00:49:07,222
What do you expect me to do?

402
00:49:07,287 --> 00:49:10,962
I can't risk the lives of our soldiers
in order to save theirs.

403
00:49:11,024 --> 00:49:15,234
Do I have to remind you of the precise
purpose of our mission here in Bosnia?

404
00:49:15,295 --> 00:49:18,003
Since it is the first time
that the two camps are--

405
00:49:18,064 --> 00:49:21,273
You know perfectly well
that there is nothing that I can do...

406
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:24,804
...without the approval of the General
Assembly of the United Nations.

407
00:49:24,871 --> 00:49:27,750
I don't think the General Assembly
will convene itself...

408
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:32,222
...specifically to deal with the problems
of two unknown individuals...

409
00:49:33,413 --> 00:49:35,120
...trapped in no man's land.

410
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:38,128
There is nothing I can do.
I don't have the authority.

411
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:39,959
What should I tell them, sir?

412
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:42,829
Tell them that, as usual,
neither side can agree.

413
00:49:42,889 --> 00:49:45,130
Tell them anything you like. Good-bye.

414
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:16,825
Is someone coming?

415
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,827
Probably. See, they've stopped shooting.

416
00:50:20,193 --> 00:50:21,297
Fuck.

417
00:50:23,162 --> 00:50:26,143
I don't even know
what this shithole's called.

418
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:30,137
- I'd hate to die here.
- Stop being a pain in the ass.

419
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:34,008
They'll get a mine expert
and it'll soon be over.

420
00:50:38,311 --> 00:50:40,723
I told you, we'll leave together.

421
00:50:53,893 --> 00:50:56,601
Here come the Smurfs! Cera!
The Smurfs!

422
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,980
If they radio us, call me immediately.

423
00:51:10,209 --> 00:51:12,621
What if something happens to you?

424
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:18,762
- Hello.
- Hello.

425
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:21,454
- Do you speak French?
- No.

426
00:51:22,555 --> 00:51:24,125
- English?
- A little.

427
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:26,893
One's a Serb and one's Bosnian.

428
00:51:27,593 --> 00:51:29,095
How did they get here?

429
00:51:29,162 --> 00:51:33,304
- Do we take the dead guys' guns?
- No, it's okay.

430
00:51:33,366 --> 00:51:35,937
- You're okay?
- Yes, okay.

431
00:51:37,703 --> 00:51:40,877
We come to help you. My name is Neil.

432
00:51:42,275 --> 00:51:43,481
He needs help.

433
00:51:43,776 --> 00:51:45,915
- Is he wounded?
- Yes.

434
00:51:49,282 --> 00:51:52,491
We must not move him. Mines.

435
00:51:53,953 --> 00:51:56,832
We move him, mine explode.

436
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:02,538
- He's on a mine that could blow.
- Thanks for the translation.

437
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:06,302
What the fuck happened here?

438
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:12,544
- Okay, don't worry.
- Yes, but...

439
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,451
Slop!

440
00:52:23,316 --> 00:52:24,522
Oh, shit.

441
00:52:25,952 --> 00:52:28,956
A bouncing mine. These guys are crazy.

442
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:31,661
What a fuck-up. We need the mine squad.

443
00:52:32,325 --> 00:52:34,305
Sarge! Charlie Tango calling.

444
00:52:34,393 --> 00:52:36,669
Okay, I'll come back in two minutes.

445
00:52:36,729 --> 00:52:39,141
Michel, give them water and food.

446
00:52:42,101 --> 00:52:43,705
What did he say?

447
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:53,585
Arizona 2 to Charlie Tango, come in.

448
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:59,253
Arizona 2, we have orders not to move.
Things are too risky.

449
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:03,766
We're already on the spot.
Everything's under control.

450
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:06,698
Both sides are respecting the cease-fire.

451
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:10,163
We have three evacuees
and need a mine expert.

452
00:53:11,097 --> 00:53:12,633
Who's speaking?

453
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:16,006
Sgt. Marchand.

454
00:53:16,369 --> 00:53:18,940
You have 5 minutes to pull out...

455
00:53:19,205 --> 00:53:21,708
...and 15 to call me from the checkpoint.

456
00:53:21,774 --> 00:53:24,778
And report to the duty officer
on your return!

457
00:53:25,912 --> 00:53:30,019
Sir, could you send a mine squad?
We have an emergency here.

458
00:53:30,283 --> 00:53:32,490
The only emergency is to pull out.

459
00:53:32,818 --> 00:53:37,062
I repeat, for the fast time,
I want you out in 5 minutes...

460
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:39,827
...and call me in 15 to confirm...

461
00:53:39,892 --> 00:53:42,839
...that you're back
and that your men are safe.

462
00:53:43,296 --> 00:53:46,800
Or I'll have you arrested.
I'll be expecting your call.

463
00:53:48,401 --> 00:53:49,573
Idiot!

464
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:54,183
Get back in.

465
00:53:55,074 --> 00:53:56,348
What for?

466
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:58,380
We must leave.

467
00:53:58,444 --> 00:53:59,980
- What?
- They're leaving.

468
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:03,490
- You'll come back?
- I don't know, my boss said we must leave.

469
00:54:04,417 --> 00:54:06,556
I'm sorry. I'll try to come back.

470
00:54:08,554 --> 00:54:11,125
Thank God we can count on you.

471
00:54:11,924 --> 00:54:13,733
If you want, I take you with me.

472
00:54:13,793 --> 00:54:16,069
- What?
- We can go with him.

473
00:54:16,696 --> 00:54:20,041
Really? Thank him nicely
and tell him he can fuck off!

474
00:54:20,266 --> 00:54:22,303
- Ciki, go.
- Shut up.

475
00:54:22,902 --> 00:54:24,404
Go and bring back help.

476
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:29,948
Wait!

477
00:54:30,109 --> 00:54:31,588
I'll come with you.

478
00:54:32,445 --> 00:54:34,083
- Where are you going?
- With them.

479
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,524
- You're going nowhere!
- Why'.7

480
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:41,031
This is all your fault.
If you stay, your side won't shoot.

481
00:54:41,354 --> 00:54:44,358
- They won't shoot, I swear.
- You're staying here.

482
00:54:44,957 --> 00:54:47,437
You're going to shoot me? Go ahead!

483
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,268
Stop fooling around!

484
00:54:50,129 --> 00:54:51,301
No!

485
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:54,136
Stop, guys!

486
00:54:55,201 --> 00:54:57,181
Okay! Cool! Stop!

487
00:54:57,637 --> 00:54:59,116
Lower your weapons!

488
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:01,208
Michel, get in!

489
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:11,620
What happened?

490
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:13,929
- What a fuck-up.
- They're maniacs!

491
00:55:13,986 --> 00:55:14,760
Shut it!

492
00:55:15,554 --> 00:55:18,433
- I knew this would be shitty.
- Shut it!

493
00:55:24,497 --> 00:55:27,501
- You're crazy, you maniac!
- I warned you.

494
00:55:29,135 --> 00:55:33,106
I'll kill you for this! I swear!

495
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,046
I've fucking had it with you.

496
00:55:44,784 --> 00:55:47,765
Keep cool just a while longer. Screw them.

497
00:55:47,987 --> 00:55:50,797
It'll be dark soon
and I'll think of something.

498
00:55:58,064 --> 00:55:59,668
How does this shit work?

499
00:56:01,967 --> 00:56:04,174
I'm sick of asking you!

500
00:56:04,704 --> 00:56:06,081
Fuck knows!

501
00:56:07,173 --> 00:56:09,983
It explodes
when you take the weight away.

502
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:17,218
Here we are at a Bosnian barricade
near the town of Tuzla...

503
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:19,430
...talking to the Bosnian Commander.

504
00:56:19,485 --> 00:56:22,295
How do you feel about the talks in Geneva?

505
00:56:22,655 --> 00:56:25,499
I'd like to go there.
Would you go with me?

506
00:56:25,858 --> 00:56:29,271
Are you resentful that people are talking
while you are suffering?

507
00:56:30,529 --> 00:56:32,008
What happened?

508
00:56:34,734 --> 00:56:38,011
It's very confused.
We go now and bring some help.

509
00:56:38,838 --> 00:56:41,842
- Why don't you tell them the truth?
- Who are you?

510
00:56:42,808 --> 00:56:45,254
I am Jane Livingston,
Global News Channel...

511
00:56:45,411 --> 00:56:50,360
...and this is Sgt. Marchand,
otherwise known as Arizona 2.

512
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,054
Stop the engine.

513
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:57,665
- How do you know that?
- We were listening to your radio frequency.

514
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:00,996
Since we were in the area,
we thought we'd come and verify.

515
00:57:01,193 --> 00:57:03,537
- You listened to our radio?
- Absolutely.

516
00:57:03,863 --> 00:57:06,036
It's the best way to get fresh information.

517
00:57:06,232 --> 00:57:10,271
Are you going back?
Why do you need a bomb disposal unit?

518
00:57:10,803 --> 00:57:12,009
Stop the camera.

519
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:15,145
- Can you take us there?
- No, I have to go.

520
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,947
That's right.

521
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:22,516
You're just here to distribute
humanitarian aid.

522
00:57:23,115 --> 00:57:26,062
Okay, we'll go without you.
Come on, let's go.

523
00:57:26,552 --> 00:57:29,032
You can't. It's too dangerous.

524
00:57:30,756 --> 00:57:31,962
Is that an order?

525
00:57:35,261 --> 00:57:37,764
Okay, stop filming, please.

526
00:57:44,103 --> 00:57:45,309
Please?

527
00:57:46,205 --> 00:57:47,741
Yes, all right.

528
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:58,389
Maybe I can help you if you'll help me.

529
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:01,495
We have an English TV crew here.

530
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:03,724
They know everything.

531
00:58:04,223 --> 00:58:07,898
Other crews are on the way.
They picked up our frequency.

532
00:58:08,394 --> 00:58:10,738
I didn't answer their questions.

533
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:15,069
Hello, Captain.
This is Jane Livingston of Global News.

534
00:58:15,134 --> 00:58:17,136
I can hear everything you're saying.

535
00:58:17,203 --> 00:58:20,776
Are we to assume that the UNPROFOR
are doing absolutely nothing...

536
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:24,185
...for those who are wounded
and trapped between the two fronts?

537
00:58:24,243 --> 00:58:28,248
Who made this decision?
Are headquarters aware of the situation?

538
00:58:29,448 --> 00:58:34,227
You know very well that you have no right
to listen or to use this frequency.

539
00:58:34,453 --> 00:58:37,866
Get off it immediately
or we'll confiscate your press card. Over.

540
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,029
Is that a threat?

541
00:58:41,627 --> 00:58:45,473
Listen, Miss Livingston,
I was not in any way threatening you.

542
00:58:45,698 --> 00:58:48,872
Please, try to understand.
We are doing what we can.

543
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:53,945
At this moment we are in negotiations
with both camps to arrange a ceasefire.

544
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,983
As you know, the situation
is extremely complicated and takes time.

545
00:58:58,577 --> 00:58:59,578
That's a lie.

546
00:58:59,945 --> 00:59:03,222
Can you tell me where these negotiations
are and who's in charge?

547
00:59:03,282 --> 00:59:06,695
I have my second unit on hand here
who could cover it immediately.

548
00:59:07,052 --> 00:59:09,362
I have no more information
for the moment.

549
00:59:10,055 --> 00:59:12,729
You're telling me
that negotiations are taking place...

550
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:15,601
...but you don't know where they are
or who's in charge.

551
00:59:15,828 --> 00:59:17,432
At the same time...

552
00:59:17,496 --> 00:59:21,876
...you've requested that your soldiers
who were on the scene return to base.

553
00:59:22,468 --> 00:59:24,448
{just carry out orders.

554
00:59:25,471 --> 00:59:28,008
Who issues these orders?
Can I have a name?

555
00:59:28,374 --> 00:59:30,877
I cannot disclose military affairs.

556
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:34,587
First of all, I must request authorization
from my superiors.

557
00:59:36,415 --> 00:59:39,123
Fine, go ahead.
I'll wait right here for your answer.

558
00:59:39,184 --> 00:59:42,256
I'm preparing a news report
which goes off in half an hour...

559
00:59:42,321 --> 00:59:45,063
...and it will be fascinating
to monitor the response...

560
00:59:45,124 --> 00:59:47,900
...of millions of our viewers
who will watch the show.

561
00:59:48,127 --> 00:59:49,538
Thank you, Captain.

562
00:59:49,695 --> 00:59:51,834
Arizona 2, are you still there?

563
00:59:52,498 --> 00:59:54,569
Affirmative, Charlie Tango.

564
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:57,336
Stay there until further orders.
Over and out.

565
00:59:58,938 --> 01:00:00,815
Message received, sir.

566
01:00:01,907 --> 01:00:04,148
- Could I--
- No, please, not now.

567
01:00:10,683 --> 01:00:12,594
Why are you doing this?

568
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:15,860
I'm sick of being a bystander.

569
01:00:16,288 --> 01:00:18,734
- What would you do?
- What I'd do?

570
01:00:19,725 --> 01:00:23,696
I'd stop the madmen ruining this country.
We have what it takes.

571
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:26,237
Aren't you neutral?

572
01:00:27,967 --> 01:00:30,470
You can't be neutral facing murder.

573
01:00:31,003 --> 01:00:33,210
Doing nothing to stop it is taking sides.

574
01:00:33,272 --> 01:00:36,014
Magnificent. Will you say that on camera?

575
01:00:36,809 --> 01:00:38,652
I may be mad, but I'm not stupid.

576
01:00:38,711 --> 01:00:40,713
- Jane.
- Yeah, I'm coming.

577
01:00:41,246 --> 01:00:42,987
I'll be right back.

578
01:01:00,899 --> 01:01:02,970
- What's wrong?
- My leg's itching.

579
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:04,241
Wait.

580
01:01:05,437 --> 01:01:08,281
You want to blow us away?
I'll scratch you.

581
01:01:09,008 --> 01:01:10,544
Lower.

582
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:13,684
Again. To the left.

583
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,489
There. That's good.

584
01:01:23,422 --> 01:01:25,095
I need the toilet.

585
01:01:30,829 --> 01:01:32,570
Piss in your pants.

586
01:01:33,532 --> 01:01:35,068
It's the other.

587
01:01:40,205 --> 01:01:41,548
It's okay.

588
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:46,485
Easy for you to say.

589
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,722
Here at the Bosnian barricade...

590
01:01:48,947 --> 01:01:51,928
...we do not know if this is yet another
mission impossible...

591
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:55,528
...or if, indeed, they will actually decide
to do something.

592
01:01:56,055 --> 01:01:57,329
Thank you, Jane.

593
01:01:57,389 --> 01:02:01,098
Let's take a look at the history
of UN involvement in the Bosnian conflict.

594
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:08,771
Martha, get me Capt. Dubois, please.

595
01:02:08,834 --> 01:02:11,815
He just called,
but I told him that you were out.

596
01:02:12,071 --> 01:02:14,176
Call him back and tell him I'm here.

597
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:18,310
You 're pushing Bosnia-Herzegovina...

598
01:02:18,877 --> 01:02:22,791
...to follow the same path
of horror and suffering...

599
01:02:22,848 --> 01:02:24,953
...as Slovenia and Croatia.

600
01:02:25,451 --> 01:02:29,661
You'll lead Bosnia into hell
and this may end up...

601
01:02:29,721 --> 01:02:31,598
...exterminating the Muslim people!

602
01:02:32,658 --> 01:02:35,935
Radovan Karadzic didn't wait long
to carry out his threat.

603
01:02:36,095 --> 01:02:40,566
Bosnian Serb paramilitary forces,
largely helped by the Yugoslav army...

604
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:42,703
...furiously attacked Bosnian cities...

605
01:02:42,768 --> 01:02:45,806
...that were defended only
by armed Bosnian civilians...

606
01:02:45,871 --> 01:02:49,318
...and the rest of the police forces
loyal to the Bosnian government.

607
01:02:49,374 --> 01:02:52,480
Serbs started massive attacks
against civilian targets...

608
01:02:52,711 --> 01:02:57,217
...spreading fear and terror and introducing
a new term: ethnical cleansing.

609
01:02:57,816 --> 01:03:00,456
The world community
finally decided to do something...

610
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:04,592
...after Serb artillery massacred people
waiting in lines for bread.

611
01:03:04,756 --> 01:03:07,703
UN Security Council
decided to send to Bosnia...

612
01:03:07,759 --> 01:03:11,070
...9,000 troops supported by
the American 6th Fleet.

613
01:03:12,064 --> 01:03:15,443
At the moment when the whole world
expected military intervention...

614
01:03:15,501 --> 01:03:19,005
...French President Francois Mitterrand
lands in Sarajevo...

615
01:03:19,304 --> 01:03:21,545
...a city that was already under siege.

616
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:25,485
Bosnians received him as a savior,
but he had different plans.

617
01:03:25,944 --> 01:03:29,915
After meeting with Radovan Karadzic,
he opened Sarajevo airport...

618
01:03:30,115 --> 01:03:33,392
...and started wide-scale
humanitarian aid action.

619
01:03:34,653 --> 01:03:39,659
UN troops were assigned to protect
and follow the UNHCR food convoys...

620
01:03:40,092 --> 01:03:42,732
...without any right to interfere
in the conflict.

621
01:03:42,794 --> 01:03:46,003
Today, Bosnians are still denied
the right to defend themselves...

622
01:03:46,064 --> 01:03:48,305
...by an imposed UN weapon embargo...

623
01:03:48,534 --> 01:03:53,244
...although, at this very moment, war
continues without any signs of pacification.

624
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:56,451
The tragedy
of the Bosnian nation continues...

625
01:03:56,742 --> 01:04:01,748
...and the only help they've got now
is 120 grams of humanitarian aid per day.

626
01:04:03,615 --> 01:04:06,095
For those joining us now,
we have news from Bosnia...

627
01:04:06,151 --> 01:04:08,188
...where some men
are caught in no man's land.

628
01:04:08,253 --> 01:04:10,199
Our correspondent
Jane Livingston is there.

629
01:04:10,255 --> 01:04:13,293
We're waiting to see which measure
will be taken by UNPROFOR.

630
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:15,599
Is there anything you'd like to add, Jane?

631
01:04:15,761 --> 01:04:20,073
Olivia, I would like to repeat the words
that I heard here only moments ago.

632
01:04:20,999 --> 01:04:24,173
“Neutrality does not exist
in the face of murder.

633
01:04:24,369 --> 01:04:27,578
“Doing nothing to stop it is,
in fact, choosing.

634
01:04:27,873 --> 01:04:30,046
“It is not being neutral.“

635
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,950
Thank you, Jane.
We'll come back to you later.

636
01:04:34,012 --> 01:04:37,721
That was Jane Livingston, live from Bosnia.
We'll be back after this.

637
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:48,299
Martha, gonna need a helicopter
and a map of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

638
01:04:48,694 --> 01:04:52,801
How was it? We haven't had an
opportunity like that in a very long time.

639
01:04:53,899 --> 01:04:55,003
Yeah.

640
01:04:55,734 --> 01:04:58,908
I know. I just hope it will make them
move their asses, you know?

641
01:04:59,871 --> 01:05:01,851
Yeah. That's right.

642
01:05:02,241 --> 01:05:04,744
Okay. I'll call you as soon as we get there.

643
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:08,815
Shit! We weren't the only ones listening
to the UNPROFOR, obviously.

644
01:05:10,182 --> 01:05:11,684
Hi, John.

645
01:05:13,885 --> 01:05:16,297
Okay, guys. We have the go-ahead.

646
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:20,700
Stay here while we check things.

647
01:05:20,759 --> 01:05:22,670
Come on. That's not what we agreed.

648
01:05:22,995 --> 01:05:26,807
It's too dangerous now.
You can move in with the mine expert.

649
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:30,280
No! You said that you would take us up...

650
01:05:32,237 --> 01:05:33,648
Fucking French.

651
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,617
Really, I'm sick of it.

652
01:06:51,516 --> 01:06:53,826
Give me the photo in my pocket.

653
01:06:55,087 --> 01:06:57,294
- Which pocket?
- The top one.

654
01:06:58,523 --> 01:06:59,524
This one.

655
01:07:05,097 --> 01:07:06,474
Let me see.

656
01:07:06,998 --> 01:07:11,743
- Why do soldiers always carry photos?
- l've no idea. Let me see.

657
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:15,949
I can't see like that.

658
01:07:26,118 --> 01:07:30,157
- Think I'll see her again?
- Cut it out, of course you will.

659
01:07:33,058 --> 01:07:34,196
Ciki!

660
01:07:38,997 --> 01:07:41,068
Stop it, for God's sake!

661
01:07:41,166 --> 01:07:42,270
Shit!

662
01:07:47,305 --> 01:07:48,648
You stop!

663
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,444
Watch the knife!

664
01:07:51,209 --> 01:07:52,517
Stop now!

665
01:07:53,478 --> 01:07:56,482
It's over! You stop! Help is coming.

666
01:07:57,783 --> 01:08:01,230
The mining squad is coming.
You understand? You tell him.

667
01:08:02,421 --> 01:08:04,401
The mine squad's coming!

668
01:08:04,689 --> 01:08:06,168
I'll kill you for this!

669
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:14,037
It's good for you.

670
01:08:15,434 --> 01:08:16,811
Help coming.

671
01:08:19,738 --> 01:08:22,514
I'll get reinforcements.
Keep an eye on them...

672
01:08:22,808 --> 01:08:24,754
...and clean his wound.

673
01:08:31,616 --> 01:08:34,688
Take this. Call me if there's a problem.

674
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:56,918
- What's happening?
- Okay, you'll be able to film.

675
01:08:56,975 --> 01:08:58,010
Are you sure?

676
01:08:58,076 --> 01:09:00,579
Everything okay? Are you all right?

677
01:09:11,223 --> 01:09:12,964
- Sgt. Marchand.
- Capt. Dubois.

678
01:09:13,124 --> 01:09:16,367
- Captain, can you tell us what's going on?
- Just one moment, please.

679
01:09:16,661 --> 01:09:20,165
- Can we have an interview later?
- I told you, one minute.

680
01:09:20,732 --> 01:09:23,440
- What's going on?
- A hell of a mess, sir.

681
01:09:23,902 --> 01:09:26,348
It's really tense. We just had to intervene.

682
01:09:26,438 --> 01:09:29,885
We're taking no risks.
Any trouble, we pull out, okay?

683
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:34,747
- What about the reporters?
- We let them film everything.

684
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:37,691
Isn't that what you wanted?

685
01:09:38,683 --> 01:09:41,129
I'm not stupid, Sgt. Marchand.

686
01:09:43,021 --> 01:09:47,060
Ladies and gentleman, I am Capt. Dubois.

687
01:09:47,659 --> 01:09:50,640
In a few minutes,
I will take you on the site.

688
01:09:50,862 --> 01:09:54,332
I suppose you all have your press cards,
helmets and flak jackets.

689
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,537
Sgt. Marchand here
is going to brief you now.

690
01:09:57,969 --> 01:10:02,941
We have there a soldier that is laying
on a mine. We have to de-mine it.

691
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:06,483
Nobody can go in the hole.
It's too dangerous.

692
01:10:06,711 --> 01:10:09,692
Don't go around because
we don't know if there are any mines.

693
01:10:11,016 --> 01:10:16,193
The situation is extremely complicated
and I want your total cooperation.

694
01:10:16,855 --> 01:10:19,131
Whoever will not respect the rules...

695
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:22,296
...will be thrown out
and their press card will be confiscated.

696
01:10:23,328 --> 01:10:26,138
Go now into your cars.
We'll leave in a few minutes.

697
01:10:26,197 --> 01:10:27,540
Please go.

698
01:10:35,173 --> 01:10:38,518
- You never mentioned a man on a mine.
- I didn't?

699
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:40,889
I forgot. Shall we go?

700
01:10:41,179 --> 01:10:44,126
- We wait for the mine expert.
- He isn't with you?

701
01:10:44,249 --> 01:10:46,889
Ours were busy.
They're sending a German.

702
01:10:47,152 --> 01:10:50,361
He should be here at 3:30. It's 3:30 now.

703
01:10:57,095 --> 01:10:58,665
Bang on the dot.

704
01:10:58,897 --> 01:11:00,001
What?

705
01:11:04,736 --> 01:11:06,477
Capt. Dubois. Do you speak French?

706
01:11:06,571 --> 01:11:07,413
No.

707
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:09,315
- English, of course.
- Of course.

708
01:11:09,374 --> 01:11:12,412
- You know the situation?
- No, we had no time for a briefing.

709
01:11:12,611 --> 01:11:15,615
We don't have much time,
so you follow us, I will explain you.

710
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,657
Over there. Follow us.

711
01:11:36,401 --> 01:11:40,713
At this very moment the UNPROFOR
are trying to help the third soldier...

712
01:11:40,772 --> 01:11:42,308
...who is lying on a mine.

713
01:11:42,574 --> 01:11:45,783
The absurdity of war continues,
taking on a different guise.

714
01:11:46,244 --> 01:11:49,418
How will all this end?
Stay tuned to Global News.

715
01:11:49,547 --> 01:11:52,084
Jane Livingston, live from Bosnia.

716
01:12:02,794 --> 01:12:03,966
Here.

717
01:12:07,098 --> 01:12:08,668
Excuse me...

718
01:12:09,601 --> 01:12:11,774
...can I make interview with you?

719
01:12:11,903 --> 01:12:15,043
Go fuck yourself!
You're the last thing I need.

720
01:12:17,976 --> 01:12:21,116
Fucking Balkanian.
What the fuck are you doing?

721
01:12:22,247 --> 01:12:23,885
- I just thought--
- Don't think.

722
01:12:23,948 --> 01:12:25,825
I'm the one who thinks around here.

723
01:12:31,122 --> 01:12:34,194
Excuse me, would you like a cigarette?

724
01:12:38,663 --> 01:12:41,303
Do you speak a little English?

725
01:12:43,635 --> 01:12:46,514
- Little.
- I can do interview with you?

726
01:12:48,339 --> 01:12:49,613
Roll.

727
01:12:51,276 --> 01:12:54,257
- How do you feel?
- Okay.

728
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,590
- Do you feel tired?
- Yes.

729
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:02,496
Was it you who put the mine
underneath the other soldier?

730
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:17,803
Fucking bastard. Cut!

731
01:13:29,781 --> 01:13:32,762
I'll kill him, even if it's the last thing I do.

732
01:13:33,485 --> 01:13:36,591
- What's wrong with you?
- I should have killed him.

733
01:13:37,655 --> 01:13:40,431
See that? I spared him and now...

734
01:13:40,592 --> 01:13:43,596
...he's tried to kill me with my own knife!

735
01:13:48,666 --> 01:13:50,270
How do you feel?

736
01:13:51,569 --> 01:13:54,516
Great. Couldn't be better.

737
01:13:55,707 --> 01:13:59,678
First, they shoot at me,
then I wake up on a mine...

738
01:14:00,278 --> 01:14:03,487
...the whole world's watching me,
I need to shit...

739
01:14:04,082 --> 01:14:07,188
...and you piss me off
with your stupid stories.

740
01:14:10,021 --> 01:14:11,398
It'll soon be over.

741
01:14:23,067 --> 01:14:25,377
- You are okay?
- Yes, I'm ready.

742
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:28,908
Now, I need everybody out of the place.

743
01:14:29,073 --> 01:14:32,247
We need the safety parameters
at least 30 meters.

744
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:34,155
Okay. I'll do it.

745
01:14:34,279 --> 01:14:35,724
Move everybody out.

746
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:56,273
Okay, please, now, you must go back.
We will start de-mining.

747
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,483
Michel, let's get going!

748
01:15:06,611 --> 01:15:09,820
You must leave now.
De-miner wants everybody out.

749
01:15:10,081 --> 01:15:11,253
You, out.

750
01:15:13,785 --> 01:15:17,961
Yes, he out, too.
Later, when we finish. Understand?

751
01:15:18,423 --> 01:15:20,562
They'll bring him out later.

752
01:15:22,293 --> 01:15:24,773
If I need a translator, I'll find one.

753
01:15:24,829 --> 01:15:26,103
Let's go.

754
01:15:30,635 --> 01:15:31,636
Calm down!

755
01:15:31,703 --> 01:15:33,205
You cannot stay here, okay?

756
01:15:35,273 --> 01:15:38,254
Tell him if he stays here
we will not start working.

757
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:41,086
It's a question of security.
Say it to your friend.

758
01:15:41,145 --> 01:15:42,453
He's not my friend.

759
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:46,421
I know, but please,
I have no other translator. Tell him.

760
01:15:47,485 --> 01:15:52,093
- They'll do nothing until we go.
- I don't need a translator!

761
01:15:53,558 --> 01:15:55,299
Go fuck yourself, asshole!

762
01:16:00,498 --> 01:16:03,445
Keep your cool. Just go.

763
01:16:07,071 --> 01:16:09,176
I'll wait for you up there.

764
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:13,278
Keep an eye on him.

765
01:16:14,746 --> 01:16:15,918
Okay?

766
01:16:20,518 --> 01:16:24,364
You can probably just make out
behind me, as I'm speaking to you...

767
01:16:24,555 --> 01:16:29,436
...the Serbian soldier, limping,
closely followed by the Bosnian soldier.

768
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:33,367
These two men, at least,
will be walking to their safety.

769
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:36,104
But they will be leaving behind
the third soldier...

770
01:16:36,367 --> 01:16:38,973
...who is still patiently waiting
on the mine...

771
01:16:39,137 --> 01:16:41,981
...for the bomb-disposal expert
to save his life.

772
01:16:42,106 --> 01:16:44,677
For him, the ordeal is not yet over.

773
01:16:45,109 --> 01:16:48,181
This is Jane Livingston, live from Bosnia...

774
01:16:48,279 --> 01:16:50,657
...for Global News. Stay tuned.

775
01:17:09,233 --> 01:17:10,507
Get lost!

776
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:13,444
Fuck you!

777
01:17:18,042 --> 01:17:21,546
Asshole! I give him bandages
and he refuses them.

778
01:17:22,246 --> 01:17:24,021
They're all maniacs!

779
01:17:27,952 --> 01:17:31,195
- It's John here. Are you still there?
- Yes. Hello?

780
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:36,439
Okay. Listen, this is really great,
but it would be fantastic if you could...

781
01:17:36,894 --> 01:17:38,999
...get the story of the guy on the mine.

782
01:17:39,063 --> 01:17:40,770
I'M try. I mean...

783
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:45,781
Maybe you could get a close-up of him
when they're clearing the mine?

784
01:17:47,071 --> 01:17:48,482
Yeah, I'll try.

785
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:51,516
Have you interviewed
the other two guys yet?

786
01:17:51,576 --> 01:17:55,023
No, unfortunately they won't let me
get anywhere near them.

787
01:17:55,813 --> 01:17:57,486
Go get it, Jane. Come on!

788
01:17:57,715 --> 01:18:01,128
As soon as you get it, we'll go live again.
Okay? Good luck.

789
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:02,763
Thank you.

790
01:18:33,284 --> 01:18:34,661
Don't move.

791
01:18:55,239 --> 01:18:56,877
Fuck, what a job.

792
01:19:00,144 --> 01:19:03,421
They say a mine expert
only ever makes one mistake.

793
01:19:04,282 --> 01:19:06,353
- Two mistakes.
- How come?

794
01:19:07,919 --> 01:19:10,525
The first is when he chooses the job.

795
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:30,603
What is happening?

796
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:35,146
There's too much stones.
I can't approach the mine.

797
01:20:35,773 --> 01:20:38,549
I don't even see what kind of mine it is.

798
01:20:38,743 --> 01:20:40,188
I know. Wait.

799
01:20:52,023 --> 01:20:55,129
- Is this the mine that is under the body?
- Yeah.

800
01:21:06,637 --> 01:21:08,275
I can do nothing.

801
01:21:08,806 --> 01:21:11,377
- What?
- It's impossible to de-activate...

802
01:21:11,442 --> 01:21:14,446
...this kind of stuff
once the mechanism is on.

803
01:21:17,014 --> 01:21:19,893
This man is already dead.

804
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:24,127
Are you sure? Can't you put something
between him and the mine?

805
01:21:24,488 --> 01:21:26,468
Maybe another de-miner knows better.

806
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:28,498
You can call whoever you want.

807
01:21:28,559 --> 01:21:33,474
Nobody, nothing in the world can de-mine
this stuff, not in these conditions.

808
01:21:34,065 --> 01:21:35,942
At least I don't know about it.

809
01:21:51,315 --> 01:21:53,955
Deus ex machina. He's all we needed.

810
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:35,769
Why are you here? Do you consider it
such an important mission?

811
01:22:36,727 --> 01:22:39,606
We consider all our missions
to be of the utmost importance.

812
01:22:39,664 --> 01:22:43,339
Our job here is to expedite
the peace process in this country.

813
01:22:44,435 --> 01:22:47,473
You didn't want to intervene.
It was your soldiers...

814
01:22:47,772 --> 01:22:50,981
...who were sick and tired of waiting,
who initiated the action.

815
01:22:51,709 --> 01:22:54,588
I'm afraid you got
the wrong end of the story here.

816
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:57,751
This is a simple new system of command.

817
01:22:58,215 --> 01:23:02,163
If it's effective, then the unit in the field
will have much greater mobility.

818
01:23:02,753 --> 01:23:05,233
What do you have to say about
the Americans' accusations...

819
01:23:05,323 --> 01:23:09,362
...that Europe's incapacity to do anything
is due to UNPROFOR's internal problems?

820
01:23:09,794 --> 01:23:13,003
I've heard no such accusations.
You must judge for yourself.

821
01:23:13,264 --> 01:23:17,007
The UNPROFOR is perfectly fulfilling
its mission. Thank you very much.

822
01:23:17,501 --> 01:23:20,675
What are the relationships between
the British and the French?

823
01:23:20,805 --> 01:23:24,184
I think we'll have to deal with that later.
It's far too complicated.

824
01:23:27,244 --> 01:23:28,882
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

825
01:23:29,246 --> 01:23:31,192
- How's it going?
- We have a problem, sir.

826
01:23:31,248 --> 01:23:33,489
- What problem?
- One of the soldiers is on a mine.

827
01:23:33,551 --> 01:23:34,791
It's impossible to defuse it.

828
01:23:34,852 --> 01:23:35,830
What?

829
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:39,125
The mine disposal expert says
it is impossible to defuse it.

830
01:23:41,826 --> 01:23:46,241
This whole fucking business stinks
to high heaven, as I said from the start.

831
01:23:48,032 --> 01:23:51,912
If the journalists get one whiff of this,
they'll crucify us.

832
01:23:52,636 --> 01:23:53,410
Shit.

833
01:23:53,704 --> 01:23:56,548
What did you decide?
What are we going to do?

834
01:23:56,807 --> 01:23:59,481
Get back into the trench.
Pretend to be busy.

835
01:23:59,810 --> 01:24:02,689
- We've got to buy ourselves some time.
- Excuse me to repeat--

836
01:24:02,747 --> 01:24:05,250
Get back into the trench!

837
01:24:06,751 --> 01:24:08,230
That's an order.

838
01:24:31,208 --> 01:24:32,915
Captain, what's happening?

839
01:24:32,977 --> 01:24:36,186
The mine disposal expert
has begun his job.

840
01:24:36,547 --> 01:24:40,461
You will be informed
as soon as he will be finished.

841
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:44,125
- I think it's going to take a little while.
- Can we approach?

842
01:24:44,188 --> 01:24:47,965
Unfortunately, for security reasons,
I cannot allow that.

843
01:24:48,025 --> 01:24:50,562
You wanted to kill me with my own knife?

844
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:51,962
Oh, shit.

845
01:24:52,229 --> 01:24:53,674
Quick! Tom!

846
01:24:53,864 --> 01:24:56,071
Is that how you thank me?

847
01:24:57,067 --> 01:24:58,603
Don't come any closer!

848
01:24:59,804 --> 01:25:01,147
You're all the same!

849
01:25:01,205 --> 01:25:03,310
And you vultures film it?

850
01:25:03,674 --> 01:25:06,848
You get good money?
Does our misery pay well?

851
01:25:08,179 --> 01:25:09,180
No!

852
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:30,509
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

853
01:25:38,642 --> 01:25:41,623
Captain? Over here, please.

854
01:25:56,527 --> 01:25:57,733
What do you think--

855
01:25:57,795 --> 01:25:59,331
Take it easy.

856
01:26:01,332 --> 01:26:02,606
Listen...

857
01:26:04,001 --> 01:26:06,140
There was no other solution.

858
01:26:06,971 --> 01:26:10,145
Marchand! Put the bodies in the car.
We're going.

859
01:26:10,674 --> 01:26:13,746
- What's happening?
- The mine expert's defused it.

860
01:26:14,245 --> 01:26:15,781
- He has?
- Yes.

861
01:26:52,483 --> 01:26:54,326
Colonel, sir,
can we just have a few questions?

862
01:26:55,152 --> 01:26:58,895
Ladies and gentleman, what can I say?
You see the conditions we work under.

863
01:26:58,956 --> 01:27:01,562
Our focus now must be
on the remaining soldier.

864
01:27:01,625 --> 01:27:03,901
We hope to be able to save
at least one life.

865
01:27:04,261 --> 01:27:06,673
- Can we come closer? Can we film it?
- Eventually.

866
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:10,268
He's in critical condition and has to be
taken to a hospital immediately.

867
01:27:10,534 --> 01:27:14,676
When he's in a fit state to answer
your questions, you'll be informed.

868
01:27:15,406 --> 01:27:19,912
The press conference tonight
at 22:00 at the Holiday Inn...

869
01:27:20,277 --> 01:27:23,554
...at which time I shall be happy to answer
any of your questions.

870
01:27:23,614 --> 01:27:27,289
For the time being, I must ask you please
to prepare to leave the field...

871
01:27:27,351 --> 01:27:31,231
...since I can no longer guarantee
your safety. Night is beginning to fall.

872
01:27:31,522 --> 01:27:34,128
Please, ladies and gentlemen,
prepare to go.

873
01:27:36,026 --> 01:27:37,369
Thank you.

874
01:28:10,728 --> 01:28:13,436
- What's going on?
- We took out the mine expert's gear.

875
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:17,035
- What about him?
- If you have an idea, let me know.

876
01:28:17,101 --> 01:28:20,446
- We can't leave him there!
- You have a solution?

877
01:28:22,172 --> 01:28:24,209
You heard the mine expert.

878
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:29,214
I hope you understand now.

879
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:32,493
It's not our business, so we stay out of it.

880
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:36,623
Everything all right, Captain?
Good work, gentlemen.

881
01:28:37,655 --> 01:28:39,328
I'm very pleased.

882
01:28:39,423 --> 01:28:43,269
I have no doubt that in the fullness of time
you'll be duly compensated.

883
01:28:54,338 --> 01:28:56,716
You've got the contact numbers
from Dubois?

884
01:28:57,307 --> 01:29:00,151
Call them, will you,
and notify them that they're dead.

885
01:29:01,078 --> 01:29:04,082
Then I'd like you to notify each side...

886
01:29:04,148 --> 01:29:06,890
...that we have information
that the other side...

887
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:10,022
...is planning to commandeer
the central trench this evening.

888
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:16,800
Could you call me the liaison
of the Bosnians, please? Thank you.

889
01:29:20,497 --> 01:29:23,671
- Well, see you round.
- See you.

890
01:29:25,669 --> 01:29:27,706
I wanted to thank you.

891
01:29:30,841 --> 01:29:33,481
- You got your report.
- Yes.

892
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:38,583
Are you okay?

893
01:29:39,883 --> 01:29:41,829
"Ready to go?
- Sorry?

894
01:29:41,985 --> 01:29:43,828
- Are you ready to go?
- Yes.

895
01:29:43,887 --> 01:29:46,265
Let's not hang around, let's go.

896
01:29:48,025 --> 01:29:50,801
- I hope we meet again.
- I hope so.

897
01:29:51,328 --> 01:29:54,309
Remember the press conference tonight,
22:00, all right?

898
01:29:54,431 --> 01:29:55,535
Yes.

899
01:30:00,137 --> 01:30:02,413
I know what you're thinking, Sergeant.

900
01:30:03,006 --> 01:30:07,045
It wouldn't make any difference, you know.
It wouldn't change anything.

901
01:30:08,846 --> 01:30:10,257
Off you go.

902
01:30:15,986 --> 01:30:18,865
Are you sure you don't want me
to film the trench?

903
01:30:20,591 --> 01:30:24,437
No. A trench is a trench.
They're all the same.
