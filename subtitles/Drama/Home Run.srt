1
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,580
There is hurt

2
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:06,626
And there is pain

3
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,337
We are bound

4
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,255
And broken

5
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,261
There are none

6
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:21,641
Without to stay

7
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,101
Secret things

8
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,687
Unspoken

9
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,568
I have known

10
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,572
The heavy hand

11
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,367
I am scarred

12
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:43,746
And scattered

13
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,958
I have heard

14
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:51,254
The very ones

15
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:55,842
Oh really matter

16
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,730
Come on, put the cards in.

17
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,946
Boys.

18
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,825
Come on, batter up.

19
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,368
Let's go hide it.

20
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,339
Boys.

21
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,590
Get on out here.

22
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,101
Let's go.

23
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,771
Batter up.

24
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,859
Uh-huh. Where do you
think you're going?

25
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,573
Who going to be first?

26
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,869
I'll do it.

27
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,746
Yeah, you'd better.

28
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,123
Ah!
Strike one.

29
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:59,382
Strike three. You're out.
You're done, son.

30
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,261
Be a man.

31
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,222
Strike.
You're flinching.

32
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,890
Stay in there. Come on, let's go.
Ready?

33
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,976
Strike five.
That was way outside.

34
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,104
What are you swinging
at that for?

35
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,272
Come on, stay in there.
Strike seven.

36
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,151
Strike eight.

37
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,153
Strike nine.

38
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,239
Strike ten.
Stay in the box.

39
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,952
Strike eleven.

40
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,829
Strike twelve.

41
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,331
Stay there.

42
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,334
Strike thirteen.

43
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,919
I'll stay here all day, son.

44
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,130
Strike fourteen.

45
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,799
Strike fifteen.

46
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,175
You're watching it.

47
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,645
You stay there.

48
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,817
Strike sixteen.

49
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,987
Strike seventeen.

50
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,989
Ah.

51
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,616
Strike eighteen,
you little sissy.

52
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,118
You're going to cry now?

53
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,202
Is that what I'm seeing?

54
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,458
Strike nineteen.

55
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,655
Let's do this, Cory.

56
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,126
Good
afternoon, Grizzlies' fans.

57
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,295
Welcome to Grizzly Stadium.

58
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,923
And today's ballgame between
your Denford Grizzlies

59
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,050
and the Peninsula Pilots.

60
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,053
Today is Young Life day
at the ball park.

61
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,598
If a Grizzly hits a home
run during today's game,

62
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:18,646
Young Life will be presented
with a check for $10,000.

63
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,942
Let's go, guys.
Here we go, guys.

64
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,611
Good luck.
It's time, guys.

65
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,822
Go Grizzlies.

66
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,157
Hey, Cory.
Hey, Helene.

67
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,993
Heard you were chatting up with
Capano at the fundraiser last night.

68
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,538
Oh, come on, Helene, you're
the only girl for me.

69
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,123
I'd better be.

70
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,919
He had to be really drunk to think
that was a good deal. Please.

71
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,547
He'd eat his first born if it
meant signing a new player.

72
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,091
I don't think
I signed anything.

73
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,301
All right.

74
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:53,055
Don't forget. Home run today.
10K for Young Life.

75
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,640
Okay?

76
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,822
You think Cory will remember
that Carlos is down there?

77
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,491
No clue.

78
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,161
Or even who Carlos is?

79
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,537
I don't know.

80
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:42,479
Tough conditions for the hitters today.
Sun shining down brightly.

81
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:46,317
And when you've got guys like Chris
Ashman and Brett Stevens on the mound

82
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,694
it's not at all a surprise

83
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,448
that we have a scoreless game
with only five hits so far.

84
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,368
Cory Brand batting 3-79
leading the league.

85
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:00,539
And he appears to be a shoo-in for
another all-star game next month.

86
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,804
Hee-yah.

87
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,140
Open your eyes, Blue.

88
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,892
Cory's not
going to like that call.

89
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,727
It appeared to be high
and outside.

90
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,271
De Cruz gave Ashman
the call of strike one.

91
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,988
Strike two. Strike two.

92
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,491
That was way outside. What are
you swinging at that for?

93
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,369
You're going to your momma?

94
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,496
You need to go talk
to your momma now?

95
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,831
Get in the box.

96
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,592
Go, Cory.
Three.

97
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,180
And it gets away
from the left fielder.

98
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,723
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

99
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,183
He's going to try to score.

100
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,061
Slides and safe.

101
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,399
That's what I'm talking about.

102
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,404
The Pilots are going
to appeal it.

103
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,572
And Cory Brand
has been called out.

104
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,074
What are you
talking about, Blue?

105
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,079
He storms out of the dugout,

106
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,748
and gets right in the face
of umpire Vic Cruz.

107
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,919
He's going to be thrown out
for slamming down the helmet.

108
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:33,090
And the replay shows he
clearly missed third base.

109
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,719
So, Cory Brand about to
give his team the lead.

110
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,979
Answer you, Blue.
Why don't you cool off?

111
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,273
You're like your brother
Blue over there?

112
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,109
How did you not see that
standing right there?

113
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,403
What are you talking about
I ain't touch base, huh?

114
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,823
Touched it now! There it is.
There it is.

115
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,700
Get out of my face.

116
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,413
Play ball.

117
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,502
And evidently the young bat
boy, he's the honorary bat.

118
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,338
Oh, my gosh.

119
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,467
Hey, what's going on, huh?

120
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,260
Doc, is he all right?

121
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,307
Not sure what exactly happened.

122
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,559
Is he okay? Can you see him?
I can't.

123
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,395
I'm on, I'm on. As Corey
Brand went into the dugout.

124
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,526
Oh, my gosh.

125
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,617
I think that's enough ice.
Your face is going to freeze.

126
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,452
Dad, I'm fine.

127
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,788
Oh, hey, babe. How are you doing?
He's all right.

128
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,706
I'm fine, I'm fine.
All right, all right.

129
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,583
Hey, guys.

130
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,002
I'm thinking about
sticking around.

131
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,962
What? Why?

132
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,798
I can't leave him like this.

133
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,967
What can you possibly do for him?
I don't know.

134
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,221
Just talk.
Find out what's up.

135
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,306
Hey, dude, can I
hold your icepack?

136
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,476
Just for a second, Tyler.
It's an official icepack.

137
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,230
Only players and people
on the team can use it.

138
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,358
And I need it.
Here, take it.

139
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,319
Dude, the whole stadium
was cheering for you.

140
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,030
I know.
I was like pshhh.

141
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:23,700
Oh, and then I went
like, oh, yeah.

142
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,870
He's the only brother I've got.

143
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,083
All right.

144
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,421
I love you.

145
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,923
I don't make it easy.

146
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,592
Whatever.

147
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,560
Hey, bro.

148
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,187
What's this, a reunion?

149
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,064
Why, did she tell you to come?

150
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,691
We should talk, Cory.

151
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,945
Talk about what?

152
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,613
What happened to you
out there today?

153
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,408
Showbiz, bro.
It's part of the game.

154
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,910
I talked to your trainer.

155
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,246
Said your blood alcohol was.
15.

156
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,082
Couldn't find my keys
in that condition,

157
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,750
let alone hit one
out of the park.

158
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,461
It's a gift.

159
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,963
What are you doing
talking to my trainer?

160
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,798
You need help, Cory.

161
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,968
Are we done here?

162
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,762
That kid you elbowed today?

163
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:29,391
That's my son.

164
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,603
Karen and I adopted him out of
foster care two months ago.

165
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,980
You'd know that if you
read an email or...

166
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,274
returned one of my calls.

167
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,904
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,993
Want to go grab
something to eat?

169
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,261
You got fat.

170
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,431
Kick your butt.

171
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,724
That's without
a personal trainer,

172
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,060
and I work for a living.

173
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,646
Yeah, what are you, mayor now?

174
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,898
District attorney.

175
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,068
Got my own parking spot.

176
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,445
And a bathroom key. Look
at you, fancy pants.

177
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,322
Congratulations.

178
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,786
How's Emma?

179
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,623
She's all right.

180
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,747
Been hard on her and Tyler
since James died overseas,

181
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,336
but she says she's glad
to be back in Okmulgee.

182
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,842
What do we say we
go get you a salad?

183
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,929
A salad?
Yeah.

184
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,556
No cheese.

185
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,746
Good morning,
Mr. Popular.

186
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,583
He's cute.

187
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,879
You've been suspended
for eight weeks.

188
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:26,508
Well, good morning to
you, too, Miss Sunshine.

189
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,845
Come here. I want to
show you something.

190
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,807
"Corey Brand
injures bat boy."

191
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,892
A million hits.
Already.

192
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,186
It was an accident.

193
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,480
Can we talk about
this later, please?

194
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:47,446
"Boozes it up in Vegas." 364,908 hits.
That was a good night.

195
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,992
"Drunk at a Strip Club."
217,402 hits.

196
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:56,622
You're a disaster. Yeah, well,
I'm a 3-27 career hitter.

197
00:15:56,706 --> 00:16:00,292
"Cory Brand DUI Caught on Tape".
Over a million hits.

198
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,137
Yeah, it looks a little bad when you
put them all together, all right?

199
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,173
But there were a lot of sober
moments in between them.

200
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,552
You still got
that condo in Miami?

201
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,889
Floor is a little warped.
Popped the water bed.

202
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,766
Here's what you're going to do.

203
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,559
You're going to fly to Tulsa

204
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,353
and drive down to Okmulgee.

205
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,563
I'm not going to Okmulgee.
Oh, yes, you are.

206
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,274
You're going to Okmulgee
and make nice with the kid.

207
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:27,069
And then I'll arrange
a very public photo op.

208
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:31,031
The kid has a name. It's Carlos.

209
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,076
Carlos is going to get a bag
full of crap from the Grizzlies,

210
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,286
and a photo op
with a celebrity.

211
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:40,248
Then go chill on the beach in Miami
for eight weeks. Yeah, lucky me.

212
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,293
Plus, the Grizzlies want proof that
you're attending a 12-step program.

213
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,253
12-step? They want
you out of sight

214
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,297
until you've completed
eight weeks.

215
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,716
And last but not least,
you're writing a check

216
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,302
for $10,000 for Young Life,

217
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:55,222
for that homer you screwed up.

218
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,515
I'll see you in Tulsa.

219
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:10,278
Ladies and gentleman, welcome
to Tulsa international Airport.

220
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:14,366
Local time is 3:34 and the
temperature is 98 degrees.

221
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,294
Hey, you didn't have to waste so
much money renting such a fancy car.

222
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,004
Don't worry about it.

223
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,676
How do you even get in this thing?
It's got no handles.

224
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,053
We're here to help farm boy.

225
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:49,901
Oh, man, Mr. Arby's
forgot my curly fries.

226
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,738
Hey, don't make me
go back in there, okay?

227
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,073
That guys nearly cried
when I signed his hat.

228
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,243
He did not. A grown man.
There were tears.

229
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,495
Right.

230
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,209
Hey, don't forget the Arby's sauce.
I got it.

231
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,842
Oh, these are so good.

232
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,327
Come on, let's go.

233
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,585
Thank you, sir.

234
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,634
You satisfied?

235
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,818
Careful.

236
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,945
Were you
drinking on the plane?

237
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,864
Let's see what
this baby can do, huh?

238
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,116
No, let's not.
Let's.

239
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:23,161
Would you please slow down?

240
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,955
Woo-hoo.

241
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,628
Cory, look out.

242
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,794
So, my Little League team is
playing the Chiefs this week.

243
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:16,506
I'm going to start reading
for the Bulldogs.

244
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:18,300
We're going to run
them into the ground.

245
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,719
They're not going to
know what hit them.

246
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,179
Yeah, I love running
them into the ground.

247
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,515
Hey, go to the car. I need
to talk to this hot rod.

248
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,395
I don't care what your District
Attorney brother says.

249
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,814
I will put you in jail.

250
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:48,038
Hey.
There you are.

251
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,749
You better pray your brother can
keep this DU I under wraps.

252
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,084
You are now facing
a ton of fines

253
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,587
on top of what the Grizzlies
are going to give you.

254
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,007
What do you want me to do? You better
hope for a suspended sentence.

255
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:03,345
And could you just try to stay out of
trouble while I cover your butt, huh?

256
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,722
Oh, jeez, the kids are here.
What kids?

257
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,349
Stop when
you get inside.

258
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,434
My brother has a baseball team.

259
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,771
Your brother is the
kids' baseball coach?

260
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:16,024
Why don't you just shoot
Bambi next time, Cory? Jeez.

261
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,275
Cory Brand.

262
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,736
Game face, Cory.
Yeah.

263
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,571
Good evening, folks.
I'm Helene Landy.

264
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,907
Did you sustain any injuries.
What happened?

265
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,242
As I was saying, Mr. Brand
is happy to report

266
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,912
other than a few bumps and
bruises that he's doing okay.

267
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,206
Cory, how's your brother?
He's okay.

268
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,042
Clay Brand is resting comfortably
while sustaining some injuries.

269
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:37,712
What are we talking about? Cory, have
you been suspended by the Grizzlies?

270
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,631
Was there alcohol
involved in the accident?

271
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,759
There was a tractor
involved in the accident.

272
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:47,305
And... out of love
for his brother,

273
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,183
Mr. Brand has kindly offered
to stay here in Okmulgee

274
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:54,854
and take his brother's place as head
coach of the kids' baseball team.

275
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,565
Cory Brand's coaching kids' baseball?
That's right.

276
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,403
Lucky team. Do the parents know their
kids are going to have Cory as a coach?

277
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,571
Does this mean you're
moving to Okmulgee?

278
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,366
That's enough. As you can imagine,
Mr. Brand's had a long day.

279
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,662
We'll release a statement tomorrow following
the team's first practice. Thank you.

280
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,226
Cory, is the field going to be big enough for
all the crowds that are going to be there?

281
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,794
You are way out of
line this time.

282
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,047
No, you are, and I'm fixing it.
Dang, I'm good.

283
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,591
I'm not doing it.
Oh, that should be shelved.

284
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:27,095
It's on mine by now.
Next conversation?

285
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,514
Now, go see
about your poor brother

286
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,474
while I find you
a place to live.

287
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,670
Hey.

288
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,014
How's our guy doing?

289
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,682
He wants two minutes with you

290
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,017
and then I want you to leave.

291
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,575
Hey, buddy.

292
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:36,122
A bit early in the
day for a DU I.

293
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:42,587
I don't know what you're saying.
Don't-don't even try.

294
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,843
I did what I could
for you legally.

295
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:52,180
I never thought my baby bro
would be bailing me out.

296
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,016
I didn't bail you out.

297
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:58,269
I'll vouch for you.

298
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:01,147
Just don't go skipping town.

299
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,244
I'm back.

300
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:18,123
Just the look of those polyester
bedspreads make me itch.

301
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,960
Okay, kid, listen up.

302
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:25,130
I found you
a 12-step program.

303
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,798
There you go.

304
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,766
You couldn't find me
a normal program?

305
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:39,352
Well, it is normal.

306
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,187
It's just, um,

307
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,316
with Jesus.

308
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,527
I'm not doing church.

309
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,405
You're doing whatever it takes to
get your butt back on the roster.

310
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,658
Besides, it's the only
game in town.

311
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,119
Celebrate Recovery?

312
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,497
If your career recovers,
trust, I will celebrate.

313
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,169
Cheers.

314
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,171
Yeah, cheers.

315
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,092
Right.
All right.

316
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,553
Hey, hey, where are you going?

317
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,306
I'm staying at Tulsa.
I'll drive back tomorrow.

318
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,266
What for?

319
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,518
Apology to the kid,
press event.

320
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:23,354
The only reason we rode
into this one horse town.

321
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,400
Well, how am I supposed to get around?
You're a big boy. Figure it out yourself.

322
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,235
I'll see you
on the field tomorrow.

323
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,615
And if you're smart,
you'll come ready to coach.

324
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:37,118
Just remember, you're happy to
be doing this for your brother

325
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,954
and for the children.

326
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,706
Night.

327
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,225
Hey, is that your truck?

328
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,145
You want to rent it?

329
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:08,066
My truck? Five hundred
bucks for the month?

330
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,359
Okay.

331
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:12,487
What's your name?
Chad.

332
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,656
Hey, Chad, I'm going
to need those keys.

333
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,492
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

334
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,494
Thanks, man.
Cory Brand.

335
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,330
Yeah, I know.

336
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,708
Hey, Chad, you know, my
fridge in there is empty.

337
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,210
You know what I'm saying?

338
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,587
Um, I could fill it for you.

339
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:33,716
With dull beverages.

340
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:38,805
And to remember to keep filling
it with the dull beverages.

341
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,100
Thanks a lot, Chad.

342
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:06,082
Good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank
you guys so much for coming out today.

343
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,584
What's up, slugger?
Cory Brand.

344
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,753
Looks like you got
your nose on straight.

345
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,630
I am so sorry about that.

346
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,508
Oh, that's okay. Oh, we've
got some Grizzlies gear

347
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,593
that's got your name
written all over it.

348
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,221
Awesome.
Thanks.

349
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,932
Let's get that on straight for the pictures.
Okay, there we go.

350
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,561
Stan, that's Cory Brand.

351
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,064
No duh, Kendricks. It's all over
the Internet that he starts today.

352
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,577
Carlos, how about that
famous thumbs up sign?

353
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,164
Go Grizzlies.
Go Grizzlies.

354
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,379
Come here.

355
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:55,305
Get that camera right here.
Go Grizzlies.

356
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,425
Big smiles, big smiles.

357
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,263
Hey.

358
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:03,639
Are you ready?

359
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,266
He doesn't know yet?

360
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,018
I don't think so.
Oh.

361
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,647
Oh, please, Suzanne is here?

362
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,483
In heels.

363
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,443
She hasn't been here
all season.

364
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,320
I can't believe
you're our coach.

365
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,530
We need major help.
You'll see.

366
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,991
We're not even close to as
good as the Roughnecks.

367
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:26,079
They can hit the ball so far, like
as far as that building over there,

368
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,164
which is where you can
get the best ice cream.

369
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,501
Ah, it's ridiculous.

370
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,253
Come on, guys,
warm up, tickle up.

371
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,590
Oh, mom. Come on.

372
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,176
Do I get to call you coach?
Sure.

373
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:46,015
Okay, everyone. We are done here.
Thank you.

374
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,934
Cory, your suspension
hit the wires today.

375
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,269
Thank you, everyone.

376
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,729
Let's go.

377
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:53,356
Good luck, kid.

378
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,525
We'll see you around, Carlos.

379
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,735
Hey, Carlos, what's your
favorite ice cream flavor?

380
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,362
Vanilla.

381
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,406
Why are we always running?
This bites.

382
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,368
My dad says the Grizzlies
suspended Cory Brand.

383
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,203
Pejerski says he drinks
like a fish.

384
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,206
Fish don't actually drink.
They use their gills.

385
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,084
Wikipedia, give it a rest.

386
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,171
Who is that woman?

387
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,758
His agent.

388
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,888
Yeah, I got to go do this.

389
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,640
Okay.

390
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,102
Stomachache.

391
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,271
Breathe.

392
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:38,359
Hey, hey, hey. Hey,
where are you going?

393
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:39,944
Home.
We're so good.

394
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,821
I'll call you in a few days.

395
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,866
What am I supposed to be doing?
Start coaching.

396
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,576
Cory Brand.

397
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,166
Emma Johnson.
It's Hargrove.

398
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,502
I mean, it's-it's been Hargrove
for the last ten years.

399
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,754
Right, sorry.
I, uh...

400
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,798
Wow, it's good to see you.

401
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,676
Yeah.

402
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:11,100
Well, thanks for, thanks for coming
out here today. I appreciate it.

403
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:14,312
Um, I'm actually one of the
Bulldogs' other coaches.

404
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,859
Yeah.

405
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,237
Look, um, I know you're caught
up in some big PR mess,

406
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,448
but let's be real.

407
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,367
These parents are never going to
go for you coaching their kids.

408
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,411
The are salt-
of-the-earth people.

409
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:33,581
And you're pretty much just
a wild child felon to them.

410
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,417
Wild child felon or not, you
guys are short a coach.

411
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,879
Yeah, but we don't need you.

412
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,215
Here comes the truth. I mean,
they'll probably tell you

413
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,634
that they've got a volunteer
and you can be on your way.

414
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:48,387
Dan Stanton. I own the hardware
store and gas station.

415
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,306
Welcome home, Cory.
Cory Brand.

416
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,183
Greg Kendricks. It's
an honor to meet you.

417
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,602
We're thrilled
to have you here.

418
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,063
It's a real treat for these kids.
Not to mention us dads.

419
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,815
If you need anything, please
feel free to call the store.

420
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,818
Awesome. Thanks, guys.
That's great.

421
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,029
Right.

422
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,533
See you.

423
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:12,620
So... ready
to get started, Coach?

424
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,874
Look, these kids will like
you and you will leave them,

425
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,960
so keep your distance.

426
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,963
Third base is yours. It's
your only responsibility.

427
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:25,007
Mom, can we do something else?
It's so hot.

428
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,760
Tyler, you can't just walk over here.
It's just so hot.

429
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,472
Oh, hi, I'm Tyler. Hey, man.
Cory Brand.

430
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,599
Tyler, get back out there
with the rest of the team.

431
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:34,934
Okay.

432
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:41,148
Em, is that... Look, I'm begging
you, keep your distance.

433
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,070
Third base.

434
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,371
Everything looked fine
on the outside, but, uh,

435
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,207
inside it was a definite mess.

436
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,918
What started
as a private curiosity

437
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,839
became, uh, something
I couldn't stop.

438
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:13,843
Eventually, I was looking
at porn at work.

439
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:17,888
Until the day
two security officers

440
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:23,477
confiscated my computer and
escorted me out of the building.

441
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:29,275
They had every website and every
minute I spent looking at them,

442
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,778
logged right there
in black and white.

443
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:39,326
I've... never felt such
shame and embarrassment.

444
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:44,874
My porn addiction and my
unwillingness to face it,

445
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,376
led to the loss of my family,

446
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:50,588
my job,
and my self-worth.

447
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,091
Depression followed.

448
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,928
How is it going?
Good.

449
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,306
John Townsend.
Folks call me J .T.

450
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,516
Yes, my agent
told me to find you.

451
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,102
You're the one who's going to be
signing off all my paperwork.

452
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:07,855
Hey, listen, I think I landed
in the wrong room over there.

453
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,233
I'm just looking for, you
know, basic 12-step program.

454
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,403
I think I ended up
with the sex addicts.

455
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:16,947
Not that I'm judging. It's just...

456
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:20,075
You're in the right room. Just takes
a while to know it sometimes.

457
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,703
Here's how it works.

458
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,831
After the main meeting,
we break into small groups.

459
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:29,668
We call open share, where we talk about
anything from chemically dependent,

460
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:32,087
sexual addictions,
childhood abuse,

461
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,298
eating disorders and so on.

462
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,218
Huh. What if
you have them all?

463
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:41,764
If you have them all,
then one day at a time.

464
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:45,309
I'm the ministry leader, so if you
have any questions, concerns,

465
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,603
jokes you feel like
you need to tell,

466
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,022
I'm the one to talk to.

467
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:53,025
Uh, well, I think I'm going
to head back in there.

468
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,277
All right.
Good to meet you.

469
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:59,156
Yeah, I still can't believe people
are talking like that in church.

470
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,283
Good to have you, Cory.

471
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,035
Thanks.

472
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,416
But God changed everything.

473
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,002
He changed me.
Long story short.

474
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:15,297
My wife and I were reunited
in marriage last August.

475
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:22,137
Because of my time
in Celebrate Recovery,

476
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,807
I know how to run to God

477
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:28,060
and his people
when I need help.

478
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:32,648
And he does help me every time.

479
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,067
Thank you for letting me share.

480
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,499
Welcome to everyone
to open share.

481
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:52,960
I'm J .T. I'm a grateful
believer of Jesus.

482
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,337
I'm currently struggling
with alcoholism.

483
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:56,839
Hey, J .T.

484
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,844
My name is Rick,
and, uh, I'm a Christian.

485
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,388
And I'm struggling
with cocaine addiction.

486
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,142
Hi, Rick.

487
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,148
Oh, I'm Cory. Currently
struggling with my agent.

488
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,734
We're glad
you're here, Cory.

489
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,697
Hey, Coach.

490
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,240
What's up, slugger?

491
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:25,451
Hey, Coach.
Hey, Tyler.

492
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,912
You guys ready to work hard today?
Yes, sir.

493
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,997
How weird is this for you.

494
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,918
Weird? Actually more like scary.

495
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,962
So, what are we
going to practice today?

496
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,507
Sliding? No, we need to
practice our batting.

497
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,552
We suck.
I mean stink.

498
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,348
Could always work on winning.
That'd be nice.

499
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,642
You're having any
feelings for him?

500
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:53,437
You can't be serious. Yeah, actually
I'm feeling that he's in my space

501
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,190
and he needs to go off to
his big far away life.

502
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,276
Hey, hey, Tyler. Tyler,
come check this out.

503
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:01,779
Your mum and Cory Brand were the
best couple in high school.

504
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,531
No way.

505
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,117
First comes love, then comes
marriage, then comes...

506
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,703
Mom, why didn't you tell me?

507
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,580
Tell you what?
Where did you get that?

508
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:14,124
My dad. Oh, really?
Remind me to thank him.

509
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,569
You know, I'm going to keep this
until after practice, okay?

510
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,421
Keep what? It's nothing.
Let's go.

511
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,839
What is it?
Nothing.

512
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,133
Let me see.
No.

513
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,303
It's our year book.
Yeah.

514
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,097
What do we go here, boys?

515
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:31,600
Look at how adorable you are.

516
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:34,019
Okay.

517
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:38,565
Hey, Coach, does this mean that
you and Coach Emma K-l-S-S-E-D?

518
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,359
Carlos.

519
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,778
Oh, you think you're
F-U-N-N-Y, don't you?

520
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:47,241
How about you get out on the field
for a K-I-C-K your B-U-T-T-Ses?

521
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,951
Let's go, boys.

522
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,496
You can keep that.
Okay.

523
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,373
All right,
let's go practice, guys.

524
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,084
Oh, my gosh.

525
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,003
Yeah.

526
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,797
Atta boy.

527
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:09,430
All right, Kendricks. Let's
go, let's bring our boy in.

528
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,183
Show us how it's done, girl.

529
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,691
Right. Time out, time out.

530
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,234
Kendricks, come here.

531
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:26,363
You're a leftie just like me.

532
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,745
You're two
steps closer to first base.

533
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,497
So lay down the right bunt.
But there's two outs.

534
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:37,833
Yeah, I know.
Trust me.

535
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,127
Think like a gazelle, huh?

536
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,837
Never look back.

537
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,256
All right, let's go, Kendricks.

538
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,056
Nice!

539
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,603
Nice bunt, Kendricks.

540
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,813
Nice job, Kendricks.

541
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,733
It's good.

542
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,947
Okay, when I touch my ear,
that's the indicator, all right?

543
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,533
We're going to slide,
we're going to steal,

544
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,869
we're going to work
on our double cuts.

545
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:17,081
Our pitch outs
and our infield shifts.

546
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,333
We're going to double
steal, hit and run,

547
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,251
and suicide squeeze.

548
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,925
We're going to fart in
some runs if we have to.

549
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:32,054
Give me two laps, and I'll see
you at the game on Saturday.

550
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,640
Let's go, Stanton.
That means you, too, buddy.

551
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,973
Play ball.

552
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,231
Come on, Caleb,
just like practice.

553
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,941
Let's go.

554
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:22,696
Hitting strikes, buddy.

555
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:31,079
Caleb, you need to step up in
the big boy jeans right now.

556
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:34,374
Start throwing strikes at this team.
They can't hit them.

557
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,960
It's the Bulldogs
for crying out loud.

558
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:41,506
Let's play ball.
Let's go, batter.

559
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:43,967
Look at me son. What did I tell you?
I said strike...

560
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,802
Nice work.
I will step into it.

561
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:48,680
I will pull you first thing.
Don't make me.

562
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,348
I won't tell you again.

563
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:53,810
Say yes, sir.

564
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:56,104
What do you say we
lighten up, huh, Coach?

565
00:46:56,189 --> 00:47:00,317
And what do you say you play your
game, all right? That's my boy.

566
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:03,028
All right, Tyler, my man.
Let's go, buddy.

567
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,280
Come on now, we got two more.

568
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,449
I say now shore up that stance.

569
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,784
A little bit closer now.

570
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,078
That's okay, Tyler, you
stand wherever you want.

571
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,643
I know where that ball
is going to go.

572
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:16,416
Yeah, just don't step into it.

573
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:24,132
A little bit closer now, Tyler.

574
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:27,928
You stand wherever
feels right, baby.

575
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,768
Ball.
Look at me, son.

576
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,021
I'll call your sister.
I will call your sister.

577
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,482
I'll embarrass you in front of
everybody out here right now.

578
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,275
You understand me?

579
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,322
Son.

580
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,824
That's not what we
trained for, is it?

581
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:53,119
Now start throwing strikes at this team.
They can't hit them.

582
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:55,872
What? You questioning
my coaching?

583
00:47:58,501 --> 00:47:59,668
Come on.

584
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,797
Strike one. See how
easy that was?

585
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:07,008
Hey, Coach, all day long.
All day long.

586
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,931
Come on, Caleb.

587
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,519
Strike two.

588
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:21,523
Caleb, two strikes.
You know that, right?

589
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,900
Can't hit a ball looking at it.
Swing at it.

590
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:27,487
Swing at the ball next time.

591
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:30,532
Step into play and swing at it.
Get your head in the game.

592
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,910
Strike three.
You're out.

593
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,414
Let's go.
Hey, son.

594
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:41,042
When I said get your head in the
game, I didn't mean miss the ball...

595
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:44,087
Get over and pick that bat up.
Pick that bat up.

596
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:48,341
Let me tell you something.

597
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:51,052
Sit down. You're benched.
You understand me?

598
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:54,014
What you say
we lighten it up, Coach.

599
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:56,099
I'll deal with you in a minute.
Sit down.

600
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,143
What did you just say to me?
Let's go, Bulldogs.

601
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,395
I said let's take it easy, coach.
Did you now?

602
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,981
Where do you think he learned
that kind of attitude from, Cory?

603
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:06,610
Hey, Dad! Shut up, son.
You sit down.

604
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:09,571
Watching idiots like you, Cory.

605
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,573
Cory Brand back in
town, aren't you?

606
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,617
You know what?
Let me smell.

607
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:16,036
Apple doesn't fall too far
from the tree now, does it?

608
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,121
You know what you are, Cory?

609
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,790
You're a showboat and you're a
drunk, just like your old man.

610
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,670
You are both out of here.

611
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,174
Thanks, Tony.

612
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,611
Nice going, Cory.
I wasn't drinking.

613
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:52,238
You weren't arrested
for drinking.

614
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:56,451
Hey, I stood up for that kid the way
no one stood up for me with Dad.

615
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,120
You're looking more
like him every day, Cory.

616
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,748
That's because I was
taking all your hits.

617
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,209
All my hits?

618
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:06,670
What do you think happened
after you left, huh?

619
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:09,464
You're not the only one that
grew up in that house, Cory.

620
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,843
Yeah, walk away.

621
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:16,137
That's what you do best, Cory.

622
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:28,024
What?
You're killing me.

623
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:30,985
Assaulted an officer?
It wasn't assault.

624
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,071
This is your lying low?

625
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:35,156
And uploaded photo
went from Facebook to...

626
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,283
Just fix it.

627
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,369
It might take a little effort,

628
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,163
but I'm sure you can handle it.

629
00:50:57,638 --> 00:51:00,640
My name is Rick.
I'm a Christian.

630
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:03,560
I was struggling
with cocaine addiction.

631
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,521
Hi, Rick.

632
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,482
I came to CR not for
recovery from crack,

633
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,610
but to fake it so that
my wife and family

634
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,779
would get off my back.

635
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:17,699
I came every week,
I did all the lessons.

636
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,910
And to my surprise, I began
dealing with my past.

637
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,747
I started to
understand why I used.

638
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,291
No.

639
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,626
When I got to step nine,

640
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:32,213
make direct amends to the
people you have harmed,

641
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:35,008
I thought make amends
face to face?

642
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,138
I don't think so.

643
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,265
So, I skipped over that step.

644
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,059
After ushering for two years,

645
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:47,645
the temptation proved to be a
bit more than I could handle

646
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,564
and I started taking money

647
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:52,942
from the offering each week.

648
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:56,863
During this time, I was
in the second-step study,

649
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,949
and I-I wanted
to finally make the...

650
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:05,872
I needed to finally
make the amends

651
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,542
to the people in my life.

652
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,878
Which meant I had to confess
what I had been doing

653
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,381
to the ministry leaders.

654
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:18,259
And when I met with them, I...

655
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:22,305
I expected to be
relieved of my guilt.

656
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:25,809
I received so much more.

657
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:30,605
I experienced God's love
and forgiveness.

658
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,900
Now, to complete the step,

659
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:39,697
I need to make
amends with you also.

660
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:42,158
Because it's your
ministry, too.

661
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,455
And I stole from you,

662
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,542
and so I stand here
and I ask you

663
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:53,628
if you'll please forgive me.

664
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,972
The truth is, God forgave me

665
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:06,474
long before I came to CR but...

666
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,101
But I still felt broken

667
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,854
and I didn't know
how to fix it.

668
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:14,107
And then I got here and learned
verses like James 5:16

669
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,985
that told me if I confessed
my sins to someone,

670
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:19,028
I could be healed.

671
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:23,241
I still mess up.

672
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:26,119
I'm not who I was.

673
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,537
I'm changing.

674
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,790
I'm getting healed.

675
00:53:33,586 --> 00:53:35,628
Thank you for letting me share.

676
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,422
I didn't even know
they made basketball cards.

677
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:22,884
Tommy.
Next limp.

678
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,303
More puzzle pieces.
Oh, I found Nick.

679
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,931
Steve.
I found Nick, too.

680
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:32,226
Hal Osberg.
Got it.

681
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:35,438
Cory Brand.
2001?

682
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,775
Oh, my gosh.
Are there any more?

683
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,235
Uh, just the one.

684
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,738
Dang it.

685
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:47,116
You can have it. He busted
me on the nose, so.

686
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,785
I think it's bad
luck or something.

687
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,415
Are you bringing it to the game?
Oh, I don't know.

688
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,126
Come on, you got to
bring it to the game.

689
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:02,548
Yeah, I just don't
want to bother him.

690
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,717
He signed it. This could be...
Fifty cents.

691
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,302
You didn't bring enough money?

692
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,847
This should do it.

693
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:11,766
If he signs it, this
could be worth a ton.

694
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:15,228
We are going to be rich.

695
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,175
Bulldogs, huddle up!
Now, come on.

696
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:53,266
How about some new uniforms?

697
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,019
Grab some hats.

698
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,939
Tyler.
Yes?

699
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:01,983
That's my number right there.
That's you, buddy.

700
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:08,031
Way cooler
than the Roughnecks now.

701
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,158
Who needs some shoes?
Kendricks.

702
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:11,993
New Nike's for you.

703
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,828
Here you go, slugger.
Size eight.

704
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,997
Hey, guys, what do you say?

705
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,374
Thanks, Coach Cory.

706
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:20,001
Thanks, Coach Cory.

707
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,502
All right, we got to win now

708
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:23,129
'cause we're
looking good, right?

709
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,797
Okay.

710
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:31,721
Let's go, Bulldogs.

711
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:37,393
Go, go home.

712
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:55,078
Come on.

713
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,707
All right, Kendricks,
let's go, let's go.

714
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:01,751
Good job, Bulldogs.

715
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,711
Nice, nice.

716
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:05,671
Good work, good work.

717
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,965
Atta boy.
Atta boy, Carlos.

718
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:09,592
Huh?

719
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:17,934
Syd.

720
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:20,103
Syd.

721
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,949
Come on, let's get them.

722
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,212
All right, Tyler, come on now.

723
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,256
The winning run is on second.

724
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,424
That's it, buddy.
Step up in there.

725
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,051
Come on.

726
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:56,597
Time.

727
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,432
Tyler, come here.

728
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,606
Tyler, look at me.

729
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,483
How many years
you been playing ball?

730
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:09,443
Five.
All right.

731
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:12,321
How many hits you got before
you took one in the face?

732
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,367
I don't know.
Fifteen, twenty?

733
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,828
Yeah.
Fifty, sixty?

734
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:21,205
Probably.
All right.

735
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:24,750
So, what do you think the chances
are of getting hit today?

736
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,210
Probably not
going to happen, huh?

737
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,212
Probably not.
Okay.

738
00:58:28,297 --> 00:58:31,340
Get back in there, step up
to the plate, hit the ball.

739
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,176
Okay.
All right.

740
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,761
Tyler.

741
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,014
Nothing great happens
when you hold back.

742
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,683
Let's go.
Come on.

743
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,193
There it is! Yes!

744
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:52,528
Carlos, go.
Go!

745
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,364
Yes!

746
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,662
Nice job. Nice play, son.

747
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:04,457
Bring it in, bring it in.

748
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,334
Where's Tyler?
Tyler!

749
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:13,382
Hey. That's what I'm talking about.
Stepping up to the plate.

750
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,844
Nice hit.

751
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:19,388
How about that, huh?

752
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,517
Great win today, guys.

753
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:25,144
Thanks, Coach.

754
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:27,396
Come on, Carlos.

755
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,857
Awesome game, Coach.
See you later.

756
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:31,442
Awesome base running, Carlos.

757
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,697
Thanks, Coach. Couldn't
have done it without you.

758
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:39,158
Come one now. We couldn't have
done it without you, Tyler.

759
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,910
Great job.
Thanks.

760
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:44,247
Thanks.
Nice game.

761
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:47,750
Yeah, we made quite the
team out there, didn't we?

762
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,045
How about we
grab some pizza?

763
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,214
Yeah.
No.

764
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,633
Come on, Mom. No, I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry.

765
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,677
I've got, uh, you know,
we've got a thing.

766
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,680
Yeah.

767
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,725
Have fun at your thing.

768
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:08,437
Cory.
J .T.

769
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:12,608
You, uh, have plans tonight?

770
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:17,405
Yeah, you know,
some ESPN, little ESPN.

771
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:19,532
Probably some ESPN after that.

772
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,913
Nah, I don't have
any plans tonight.

773
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:28,541
You want plans?

774
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,167
Sure.

775
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,378
Pick you at your
motel around 6:00?

776
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,298
Six o'clock.

777
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:37,049
See you then, right?

778
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,093
Don't be late.
It's going to be fun.

779
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,886
It sounds like it.

780
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:54,817
In a effort to
earn the money you pay me,

781
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,737
I scored you a national television
interview this Saturday.

782
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:00,406
Well, well, well, so nice
of you to finally call me.

783
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,284
With the all-star vote coming up, we
need to get you back in the public eye

784
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,994
looking clean and sober.

785
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,871
Get people to fall
in love with you again.

786
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:09,457
Oh, please, they've
always loved me.

787
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:12,918
Ha. That's because I remind
them how much they do love you.

788
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,005
Okay, fine.
Book it.

789
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,757
Let's get me seen.

790
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,925
Done.

791
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:37,026
Hey, J .T.,
I'll be right back.

792
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:49,663
So, this is your thing.

793
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:52,124
Not very hospitable of
you, Emma Hargrove,

794
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:54,668
to not tell
a poor stranded fool

795
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:56,837
about the Wild West Chili Fest.

796
01:01:56,922 --> 01:02:00,383
Fool, yes.
Stranded, never.

797
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:04,178
You get your
Ferris wheel on, yet?

798
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,389
You're missing life in the
fast lane, aren't you?

799
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:10,393
Yes and no.

800
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:14,563
Beating the Jets today, that was,
that was a new all-time high for me.

801
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,153
You're right about Tyler.

802
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,531
He just needed to be pushed.

803
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:26,659
I get, uh, I get
too caught up...

804
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,035
You're a great mom.

805
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:32,039
He's a great kid.
He is.

806
01:02:32,124 --> 01:02:34,834
Hey, dude, it's Coach. Come on.

807
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,712
Coach. What's up, guys?

808
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:41,382
Hey, Coach, we found a rookie
card today at the store.

809
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,926
We were wondering if you
could sign it. Sure.

810
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,095
I didn't know you guys
collected baseball cards.

811
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:48,180
Oh, yeah.
All the time.

812
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:51,350
I got some really cool
ones back in the barn.

813
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:53,769
Seventy-three Passy,
Ninety-three Begonus.

814
01:02:53,854 --> 01:02:55,980
I have Passy and Begonus, too.

815
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:59,066
Yeah? Well, we should get together
and compare cards some time.

816
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:02,486
Maybe after this we can go back
to the barn and check them out.

817
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:04,572
Oh, come on, come on, please.

818
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:06,240
Okay, sure.
Yes.

819
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:09,243
Tug O' War.

820
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,460
To one of the best
nights of my life.

821
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:23,716
I'm glad you found
a thing tonight.

822
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:28,637
Good old Oklahoma.

823
01:03:31,183 --> 01:03:33,934
Wait till you see
this, guys, huh?

824
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:36,145
How cool is this.
Whoa.

825
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:42,193
How cool, right?
Oh, sweet.

826
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:43,903
All right.

827
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,034
Who's this?

828
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,329
Dad. Your dad played ball?

829
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:55,122
That's your dad?

830
01:03:55,207 --> 01:03:56,999
Yeah, he was a great player.

831
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,210
He never made it
past AA, though.

832
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,548
Come on,
where are they, Cory?

833
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:11,263
Where's the box?
Where's the box, huh?

834
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:15,100
It's not in here. It's a small wooden
box, guys, with a metal latch.

835
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:17,937
All the important
ones are in it, huh?

836
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:19,939
it's got to be here.

837
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:24,652
They're gone.

838
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:27,655
I can't believe it!
He must have sold them.

839
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:38,374
That drunk!

840
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:43,837
Oh.

841
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,139
What's going on? Look, I just
wanted to show the kids, all right?

842
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:57,947
Okay, boys, come on. Get on back to the house, okay?
No, no, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

843
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,979
Yeah, right.

844
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:08,404
What is the matter with you?
In front of the kids?

845
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:10,531
Stay out of it, Karen.

846
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:13,075
No one's touched your precious
stuff in years, Cory.

847
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,579
Look, he did, okay? He always messed things up.
He always screwed everything up.

848
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,872
You can't keep playing the victim.
It doesn't work.

849
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:20,874
What do you know
about my life, huh?

850
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:22,918
What do you know about
anything for that matter?

851
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:25,379
You're just some sheltered
Sunday school teacher,

852
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,881
so spare me the lecture
until you've lived

853
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:29,758
through something
a little more stressful

854
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:32,553
than your kitchen sink
backing up.

855
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:34,430
I don't want to hear it.

856
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,600
Let's go.

857
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:54,283
Okay, kiddo.
Lights out.

858
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,035
Good night.
Night.

859
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,537
Love you.
Love you, too.

860
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:46,460
Hey.
What's this?

861
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:48,962
I know, sort of
impulsive, but, uh,

862
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:50,422
I wanted to give her to Tyler.

863
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:52,633
What?
Ls that a dog?

864
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,343
All yours, sport.
She's mine?

865
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,178
No. Look, it's all there.

866
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:58,722
Training crate, food, leash.
What are you doing?

867
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:01,600
You can't just come over
here and give my son a dog.

868
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:03,602
I wanted to apologize
for last night.

869
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:06,980
By heaping a ridiculous
responsibility on him and me?

870
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:10,776
Come on, Mom. Can't we keep him?
Tyler, we're not keeping the dog.

871
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:17,282
That figures, you always say no.
Every kid should have a dog.

872
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:20,160
You don't get to have a say in
what he should or shouldn't have.

873
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:23,997
Look, this whole thing
is so not okay.

874
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:26,375
You have to go, and take your dog.
Tyler.

875
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:32,172
Come on.

876
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:01,744
Hi. My name is Karen.

877
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:03,704
Hi, Karen.

878
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:07,082
And I'm a grateful
believer in Jesus.

879
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:10,544
I Celebrate Recovery from
sexual abuse by my father

880
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:13,213
from the time I turned
eight until I was sixteen.

881
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:17,342
While going through these
experiences I felt alone,

882
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:19,887
with no one to reach out to,

883
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:22,264
not one person to tell.

884
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:27,686
My whole life I had carried the
pain, burden and shame for my past.

885
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:31,523
Even though I've been
a Christian for years,

886
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,818
I hid my pain and shame
from everyone I knew.

887
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:43,327
When I-when
I learned as an adult

888
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:46,121
that I would not be able to
bear children of my own,

889
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:50,709
this was the final blow.

890
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:55,088
I felt completely
abandoned by God.

891
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:07,601
When I attended
Celebrate Recovery,

892
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:09,645
I wasn't prepared to experience

893
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:11,730
the freedom and relief

894
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:14,775
I would gain by sharing my
deep hurt with God and others.

895
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:20,531
I love that I don't have
to hide who I am here.

896
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:23,158
I can go to my step
study and share openly

897
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:25,452
without the fear
of being judged.

898
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:28,121
I'm just me.

899
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:29,998
Banged up and imperfect.

900
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:37,089
Because of the work of Jesus, I'm
no longer living my life in shame.

901
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,675
Thank you for letting me share.

902
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:24,177
Go.

903
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:34,897
Run, run.
Run!

904
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,827
You're running on.

905
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,323
All right, Bulldogs.

906
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:32,663
Hey. Why aren't you in the limo?

907
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:36,458
Why aren't you on your way to Tulsa?
Any of this ringing a bell?

908
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,835
Yeah, hey, about that,
we need to reschedule.

909
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,589
I am about to blow an artery if you
just said what I think you just said.

910
01:11:42,674 --> 01:11:44,591
No, I'm serious,
we need to reschedule.

911
01:11:44,676 --> 01:11:47,260
You are not missing
this interview.

912
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:49,554
The Grizzlies just brought
up a kid from the Springs,

913
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,765
and this kid is good, Cory.
And guess what?

914
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:53,767
He's not a pain in the butt.

915
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:55,769
You will not say no.

916
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:59,022
No, all right? I'm not
missing my son's game.

917
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:03,068
Your son? Is this some kind
of line from Green Acres?

918
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,195
No, it's not, Helene,
all right?

919
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:07,656
My son's on the Little League
team and I'm his coach.

920
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:11,451
Got to go.
I'm going to kill him.

921
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:16,623
Everything okay? Yeah, I just forgot
I had this TV interview scheduled.

922
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:18,583
Oh, you should go.

923
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,335
No, I already told my agent.

924
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,295
Forget it, it's done,
it's over, too late.

925
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,132
Seriously, Cory, it's your career.
Go.

926
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:26,883
Believe it or not,
we can handle it.

927
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:28,677
No, no, I'm staying.

928
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:31,263
Come on, we got a game to win, coach.
Let's go.

929
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,140
What's up, Bulldogs?

930
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:35,434
Huh?
High fives.

931
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:42,899
Hey, Kendricks.

932
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:45,277
What's up, Coach?

933
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:47,988
Nice day, huh?
Yeah.

934
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:49,781
Great breeze.

935
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:52,492
How's your parents?
Fine.

936
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:54,786
The pitcher is nervous.

937
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,955
Second baseman
has got a weak arm.

938
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,041
Let's shake things up, huh?

939
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,126
You know what I'm saying?

940
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:07,007
Stanton, was that you?
Trying to fart in the run.

941
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:13,889
You still see that play? Yeah.

942
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,393
Run, Kendricks.

943
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,189
Don't throw it.
On the go!

944
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:25,567
Don't throw it!

945
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:27,194
Go.
Go, Will, go. Go.

946
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:29,863
Go home!
Go home!

947
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:32,407
Go home!

948
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:35,160
Yes!

949
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,913
There it is. Let's
go, let's go, let's go.

950
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:40,582
Nice job, Bulldogs.

951
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:43,251
What's up? We won. Nice.

952
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:45,087
What were we training for
all week?

953
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:47,339
Are you kidding me, guys?

954
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,841
Woo!
Bulldogs!

955
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:55,430
Get on the bus. Take
your stuff and let's go.

956
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:56,765
All right, buddy.
Yeah.

957
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,183
Huh, that's quite a win.

958
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,393
It's so good.

959
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:02,229
Watch your hands.

960
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:04,356
Coach.

961
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,609
You got rubbed. It's not an
all-star team unless you're on it.

962
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:09,820
What are you
talking about, buddy?

963
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:12,280
How's the National League going
to win if you're not on the team?

964
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:13,532
Come on, let's go, son.

965
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:14,699
See you, Coach.

966
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,785
All right, buddy.

967
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:20,705
Are you all right?

968
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:24,918
Yeah, I'm fine. I just... forgot
that news came out today.

969
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:27,337
All right,
I'm going to head out.

970
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:28,755
See you, Coach.

971
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,966
Good game, Tyler.
Thanks.

972
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:11,923
It's going.
It's going.

973
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,427
It's gone.

974
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:27,606
See you.

975
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:12,400
It's going.
It's back.

976
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:14,402
Foul ball.

977
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,906
Cory.

978
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:21,576
What are you doing?

979
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,707
Hey. Well, I was just wondering

980
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:30,669
how you were doing after
the all-star news but I...

981
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:34,060
Well, I see that you're
the same as always.

982
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:38,385
I didn't get the vote.
No, yeah, I know.

983
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:40,553
I was upset.

984
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:42,889
My career is in the gutter.

985
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:44,933
I'm out here wasting my time.

986
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:48,061
Well, I'm sure it's very
disappointing for you.

987
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:51,398
But then, adults cope with
disappointment all the time.

988
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:55,694
Ask me how I know. I know,
I know I disappointed you.

989
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:58,780
All right? I didn't just leave
to go play baseball, you know?

990
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:01,908
Being a father scared
the crap out of me.

991
01:17:01,993 --> 01:17:04,369
But I've changed, Emma.

992
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,622
Clearly.

993
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,585
Wait, Emma.

994
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,921
Emma, stop.

995
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:16,756
I want to be his father.

996
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:18,717
Really?

997
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:21,428
Really you want to be his father, Cory?
Yes, I do.

998
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:23,763
It takes courage
to be a parent.

999
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:27,100
It is sheer bravery
to love a child.

1000
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:29,144
To be there for them,
to care for them,

1001
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:30,937
to love them
when they push you away.

1002
01:17:31,022 --> 01:17:34,441
It takes courage to put
your dreams on hold.

1003
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:37,444
To juggle your own heartache
and disappointments.

1004
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:41,072
And just when you think that you
might be getting the hang of things,

1005
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:43,450
you lose your husband.

1006
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:48,288
So, now you have no choice
but to just pull it together

1007
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:51,583
and care for the most precious,

1008
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,753
the most amazing person
you have ever known.

1009
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,925
Parenting is not
for cowards, Cory.

1010
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:03,178
You ran before.
You'll run again.

1011
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,430
It was a mistake, all right?
A huge mistake.

1012
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:08,308
The old man said I'd end up
resenting you and the kid

1013
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:10,435
the way he resented having me.

1014
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,979
He told me I'd screw
up the baby's life.

1015
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:16,524
And I believed him, okay?
I believed him.

1016
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,860
So, your only choice
was to just write us off?

1017
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,821
I didn't write you off, okay?
You went off and got married.

1018
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:26,409
Whatever's broken in you, Cory,

1019
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:29,496
whatever your dad did or
didn't do, I can't fix it.

1020
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,373
Neither can Tyler.

1021
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,666
That hurt inside you
is going to hurt Tyler.

1022
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,795
It already has.
He needs a father.

1023
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:40,799
Well, he had a father.
But he died.

1024
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:44,427
And James is the only person that
was there for us when you left.

1025
01:18:44,512 --> 01:18:47,138
And that amazing, unselfish man

1026
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:49,516
is the only father
Tyler has ever known.

1027
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,310
And for now
that is how it stays.

1028
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:02,755
Strike six.

1029
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,591
You're standing there
watching it.

1030
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:06,593
Let me see something
out of you for once.

1031
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,637
Strike nine.

1032
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:13,600
Come on. Come on, stay in there.

1033
01:20:13,684 --> 01:20:16,519
Get your elbow up.
You can't hit it like that.

1034
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:20,273
Strike ten.

1035
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:24,986
Come on, you little sissy.
Stand up.

1036
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,079
Go on, go get it.

1037
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:43,880
You going to cry now?
Ls that what I'm seeing?

1038
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:45,965
You're going to stand
there and cry?

1039
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,803
You know, I-I-I first
thought that, you know,

1040
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:52,680
Meth could be
like a-like a fun thing,

1041
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:55,975
and I could-I could
stop any time,

1042
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:59,938
but, you know, I wouldn't
tweak or nothing,

1043
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:05,443
but... coming, coming
down was hard.

1044
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:08,655
And, uh, I just...

1045
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:10,615
I had to have it.

1046
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,825
I stole from my grandma's
purse to get it.

1047
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:15,662
I couldn't stop.

1048
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:18,164
So, I started, you know,

1049
01:21:18,249 --> 01:21:20,166
going through these questions.

1050
01:21:20,251 --> 01:21:24,921
I-I-I forced myself to answer
these questions, you know.

1051
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:29,509
L-I-l found out
why I used.

1052
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:33,054
And I still, I still struggle.

1053
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:36,808
But I don't feel, I don't
feel hopeless any more.

1054
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,643
I...

1055
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,812
It's getting better.

1056
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:44,941
I can... I can feel
myself changing.

1057
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:50,154
That, that's...

1058
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,906
Thanks for sharing.

1059
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,252
Hey, Cory.

1060
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:06,838
This is your eighth week.

1061
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:12,218
Huh.

1062
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:14,262
Seems so official.

1063
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:18,016
Thanks.
Yeah.

1064
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,226
See you man. Hey,
you know, it's, uh,

1065
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:23,396
it's your last mandatory meeting
but we hope you keep coming back.

1066
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:27,233
Yeah, all right.
It's been good.

1067
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:34,407
Congratulations.
Thanks, thanks.

1068
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:48,921
Looky there.

1069
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,910
Hey there, boys.

1070
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:22,580
Oh. Hi, Officer Pajersky. Hi, Coach.
Officer Pajersky.

1071
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:24,332
Mm-hm. What are you chewing on?

1072
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:25,750
Gum.

1073
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,835
Paid for it?
Yes, sir.

1074
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,756
Some game you guys
played the other night.

1075
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,424
Thanks.

1076
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:35,259
You know we're coming
after you next year.

1077
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:38,012
I'll see you, Coach.

1078
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:42,100
Dude, should we go to my house?

1079
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:43,685
Hold up there, Tyler.

1080
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:52,276
Looks like you got a new daddy.

1081
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:55,238
What?
You boys be good.

1082
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:57,699
"Cory Brand
puts family first."

1083
01:23:57,783 --> 01:23:59,951
Hey, is that you?

1084
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,665
Coach Cory is your dad?

1085
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:21,973
Hey, where have you been?

1086
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,850
I left you like six messages.

1087
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:26,185
I got my walking papers.
I'm good to go.

1088
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:31,357
Yeah, hey, I only got a minute.
I've got some bad news.

1089
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:35,862
You're free-agent now. You've been released.
What are you talking about?

1090
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:39,282
Well, it turns out they didn't miss
you that much these past two months.

1091
01:24:39,366 --> 01:24:41,117
Cory, you're too much trouble.

1092
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:43,911
Look, it's cool.
I've made some calls...

1093
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:26,204
Hello?

1094
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:28,456
Hey, girl.

1095
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:31,542
Yeah, let me ask. Hold on,
I'm just getting inside.

1096
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:36,047
Hey, babe.
Have you seen Tyler?

1097
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:38,257
Um...

1098
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:39,592
Let me call you back.

1099
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:41,135
Come here.

1100
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:53,708
Tyler.

1101
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,209
What are you doing here, Tyler?

1102
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,507
Hey, what are you
doing here, sport?

1103
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,552
Get in the car, Tyler.

1104
01:27:06,722 --> 01:27:08,472
Tyler, get in the car.

1105
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:10,349
Em.

1106
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:14,186
You had no right.

1107
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:17,189
I can't believe you used us like this.
Tyler, get in the car.

1108
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:18,858
Mom, no.

1109
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:21,068
Tyler.
No.

1110
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:30,411
Are you my dad?

1111
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:43,341
I have your cards.

1112
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:45,051
Your dad gave them to me.

1113
01:27:45,135 --> 01:27:48,804
He used to mow our lawn.

1114
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:50,473
I didn't know they were yours.

1115
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:51,891
Tyler.
I'm sorry.

1116
01:27:57,648 --> 01:27:59,357
Get in the car.

1117
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:05,363
You lied to me.

1118
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:41,959
Got your message.

1119
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:54,638
I can't stop.

1120
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:05,983
I can't make myself stop.

1121
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:11,155
I know.

1122
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:31,383
The first step
is the most important.

1123
01:30:31,468 --> 01:30:35,596
Reminding us to surrender
to Christ only.

1124
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,933
If you've identified a new area that
you'd like to surrender to Christ

1125
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:42,770
or if you've relapsed
and you're coming back,

1126
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:44,814
I hope you'll come
forward today

1127
01:30:44,898 --> 01:30:47,108
and remember
this surrender day.

1128
01:31:19,683 --> 01:31:22,393
Now please stand
for the serenity prayer.

1129
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:29,358
God, bring me the serenity

1130
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:32,778
to accept the things
I cannot change,

1131
01:31:32,863 --> 01:31:35,072
the courage to change
the things I can,

1132
01:31:35,157 --> 01:31:38,492
and the wisdom
to know the difference,

1133
01:31:38,577 --> 01:31:40,786
living one day at a time,

1134
01:31:40,871 --> 01:31:43,330
enjoying one moment at a time.

1135
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:46,959
Accepting hardship
as a pathway to peace.

1136
01:31:47,043 --> 01:31:51,630
Taking as Jesus did the
sinful world as it is,

1137
01:31:51,715 --> 01:31:53,757
not as I would have it.

1138
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:56,927
Trusting that you
will make all things right

1139
01:31:57,012 --> 01:31:59,013
if I surrender to your will.

1140
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:02,433
So that I may be reasonably
happy in this life

1141
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:06,270
and supremely happy with
you forever in the next.

1142
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:07,521
Amen.

1143
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:22,953
My father's work took him away
from us most of the time.

1144
01:32:23,038 --> 01:32:27,833
And my stay-at-home mother was
verbally and psychologically abusive.

1145
01:32:27,918 --> 01:32:30,002
As a child,

1146
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:33,005
I lived in a constant
state of fear.

1147
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:35,257
I believed in God,

1148
01:32:35,342 --> 01:32:39,637
but I had this warped
sense of who he was.

1149
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:41,513
And I couldn't trust him.

1150
01:32:43,308 --> 01:32:47,019
Life, for me,

1151
01:32:47,103 --> 01:32:49,813
was performance based.

1152
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:52,983
But,

1153
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:56,654
after going
through my step study,

1154
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:59,031
I now believe

1155
01:32:59,115 --> 01:33:01,408
that God is a loving father.

1156
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:05,037
He's not waiting to send me to
hell for every mistake I make.

1157
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:08,540
No matter what my childhood
experiences has taught me,

1158
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:14,046
I am valuable because
I'm a child of God.

1159
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:21,804
I'm Cory.

1160
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:30,437
And I'm a new believer
in Jesus Christ.

1161
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:36,026
And I struggle with alcoholism.

1162
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:39,280
Hi, Cory.
Glad you're here.

1163
01:34:39,007 --> 01:34:41,550
Oh, come on, you guys,
this is pathetic.

1164
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:42,968
You got to at least try.

1165
01:34:45,847 --> 01:34:47,931
Hey.

1166
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:51,185
This is like that movie where
the lady leaves the children

1167
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:53,645
and then it's not fun
for them anymore.

1168
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:59,026
Hey! What's that movie called, the one
with the nun and the singing children?

1169
01:35:01,738 --> 01:35:04,031
The Sound of Music?
Yeah.

1170
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:06,283
This is just like
The Sound of Music.

1171
01:35:06,368 --> 01:35:09,703
Except it's not fun anymore
without Coach Cory.

1172
01:35:10,997 --> 01:35:13,332
You're killing me, Carlos.

1173
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,845
Hi.
Hey, girl.

1174
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:28,639
Sorry I'm kind of
popping in unannounced.

1175
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:30,140
That's okay.
You want to come in?

1176
01:35:30,225 --> 01:35:32,184
Uh, is Tyler here?

1177
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:33,811
He's around here somewhere.

1178
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:35,562
Let's go out here.

1179
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:44,029
Uh, Tyler called Clay

1180
01:35:44,114 --> 01:35:47,825
asking if we would convince you to
let him go to the ballgame tomorrow.

1181
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:50,077
Oh, he called you?

1182
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:52,413
I'm so sorry.

1183
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:58,043
Absolutely not.

1184
01:35:58,128 --> 01:36:01,046
Look, no, I really appreciate
that Clay and Cory

1185
01:36:01,131 --> 01:36:02,798
worked out
some stuff this year,

1186
01:36:02,882 --> 01:36:05,467
and that your family
is doing better.

1187
01:36:05,552 --> 01:36:07,761
No, I'm just not there, yet.

1188
01:36:07,887 --> 01:36:11,849
Emma... Karen,
people don't change.

1189
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:14,143
Look, honey, I love you,

1190
01:36:14,227 --> 01:36:17,604
but the only person who's not
changing around here is you.

1191
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:20,441
Mom.

1192
01:36:30,076 --> 01:36:32,453
All I could say is just
taking it one day at a time.

1193
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:36,623
I'm in Tulsa now, and just folks
are now doing a good job.

1194
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:39,376
Would you excuse me? I've got
some really important guests.

1195
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:41,086
Thank you.

1196
01:36:41,171 --> 01:36:42,713
Hey, what's up, guys?

1197
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:46,091
Huh? Bring it in.
How's practice, huh?

1198
01:36:46,176 --> 01:36:48,343
Hi, Cory.
You look great.

1199
01:36:48,428 --> 01:36:50,387
Good to see you. Yeah?
Good to see you, guys.

1200
01:36:50,513 --> 01:36:52,139
How are you? I'm good. I'm good.

1201
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:54,475
They make it?
No.

1202
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:56,560
Yeah, it's all right.

1203
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:59,062
Did you say anything about the
Bulldogs to those reporters?

1204
01:36:59,147 --> 01:37:00,689
Don't be stupid, Carlos.

1205
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:03,525
Okay, look, we do get that station.
Yeah.

1206
01:37:03,610 --> 01:37:05,611
You get a player's
discount at the gift shop?

1207
01:37:05,695 --> 01:37:08,071
I think so. Yeah, we can
work something out.

1208
01:37:08,156 --> 01:37:09,573
What do you say
we hit some balls?

1209
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:11,533
I can introduce you
to the team.

1210
01:37:11,618 --> 01:37:13,118
All right, let's go.

1211
01:37:13,203 --> 01:37:14,786
Good idea.
Get out of here.

1212
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:43,482
Batter up, you little sissy.

1213
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:48,904
Get your hands
together on the bat.

1214
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:54,576
Stand in the box.

1215
01:38:24,357 --> 01:38:26,024
Five minutes.

1216
01:38:26,109 --> 01:38:28,569
Cory Brand.

1217
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:30,737
This boy belong to you?

1218
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:32,322
Let me call you right back.

1219
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:35,325
He sure does. What's up, buddy?
Huh?

1220
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:37,452
I'm sorry we missed your game.

1221
01:38:37,537 --> 01:38:39,746
How have you been?
Good.

1222
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:44,001
Hi.
Hey.

1223
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:46,837
How you been?

1224
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:48,839
Good.

1225
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:52,092
You look good.

1226
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:53,802
Thanks.

1227
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:56,680
So great to see you, guys.

1228
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:58,932
You look great.

1229
01:38:59,017 --> 01:39:00,559
Thank you.

1230
01:39:00,643 --> 01:39:02,352
You guys have some time?

1231
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:04,313
Yes, please.
Please, please, please.

1232
01:39:04,397 --> 01:39:06,023
Yes, we do.

1233
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:08,692
You want to see the field? Yeah.

1234
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:10,319
Huh?

1235
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:16,742
So, what do you think?

1236
01:39:16,826 --> 01:39:18,744
Can you pop one
over that fence?

1237
01:39:18,828 --> 01:39:20,787
No. Oh, I bet you could.

1238
01:39:20,872 --> 01:39:21,955
No, I couldn't.

1239
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:25,042
One day.

1240
01:39:25,126 --> 01:39:26,627
How is Coach Clay
treating you guys?

1241
01:39:26,711 --> 01:39:29,504
Good.
Yeah?

1242
01:39:29,631 --> 01:39:31,340
You guys beat the Roughnecks?
Yeah.

1243
01:39:31,424 --> 01:39:33,508
That's what I'm talking about.

1244
01:39:33,635 --> 01:39:36,928
Coach Pajersky wasn't really happy.
I bet he wasn't.

1245
01:39:41,434 --> 01:39:45,062
Time to go.
Oh, come on, Mom.

1246
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:46,980
Come on, let's
bring it in, sport.

1247
01:39:53,571 --> 01:39:55,822
Hey, Tyler, come here.
What is it?

1248
01:39:55,907 --> 01:39:57,157
I got something for you.

1249
01:40:02,372 --> 01:40:03,664
You sure you want me to have it?

1250
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:06,333
Belongs to you now.

1251
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:17,928
Emma.

1252
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:19,596
Thanks for coming.

1253
01:40:19,681 --> 01:40:22,015
Sure.

1254
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:26,645
Hey, listen, there's, uh...

1255
01:40:29,565 --> 01:40:34,194
There's nothing I can do to
make up for what I've done.

1256
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:36,113
For what I put you through.

1257
01:40:37,657 --> 01:40:39,199
And Tyler.

1258
01:40:40,868 --> 01:40:43,286
I'm sorry.

1259
01:40:43,371 --> 01:40:46,748
I'm so, so sorry, Emma.

1260
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:48,625
And I hope you can forgive me.

1261
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:51,712
Listen, I'm...

1262
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:55,424
I'm not asking
for anything, okay?

1263
01:40:55,508 --> 01:40:57,634
But,

1264
01:40:57,719 --> 01:40:59,720
I want you to know
I love this family.

1265
01:41:01,973 --> 01:41:05,350
I believe in this family and I
want to be a part of it as much

1266
01:41:07,437 --> 01:41:09,938
or as little
as you'll let me be.

1267
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:19,531
Yeah.

1268
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:35,589
Mom?
Hm?

1269
01:41:35,673 --> 01:41:39,050
Nothing great happens
when you hold back.

1270
01:41:50,897 --> 01:41:52,272
Cory.

1271
01:42:19,759 --> 01:42:21,092
You hungry?

1272
01:42:21,177 --> 01:42:23,303
Yeah.

1273
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:26,807
Let's go.

1274
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:49,496
I have left The battle lines

1275
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:54,292
There's a hope

1276
01:42:54,377 --> 01:42:58,171
That lies In front of me

1277
01:43:02,343 --> 01:43:06,930
I've discovered Who I am

1278
01:43:09,392 --> 01:43:11,768
And I found

1279
01:43:11,853 --> 01:43:13,812
I was

1280
01:43:13,896 --> 01:43:16,189
The enemy

1281
01:43:17,733 --> 01:43:20,902
I have struggled

1282
01:43:20,987 --> 01:43:24,030
For so long

1283
01:43:25,616 --> 01:43:27,909
I lay it down

1284
01:43:30,037 --> 01:43:32,163
I give it up

1285
01:43:34,375 --> 01:43:36,710
I'm letting go

1286
01:43:39,046 --> 01:43:42,883
Of this war I've always known

1287
01:43:42,967 --> 01:43:45,051
I wave the flag

1288
01:43:47,179 --> 01:43:51,308
I humbly fall

1289
01:43:51,392 --> 01:43:53,894
On my knees

1290
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,816
I have tried To do it all

1291
01:43:59,901 --> 01:44:03,153
On my own

1292
01:44:08,951 --> 01:44:11,745
I surrender

1293
01:44:32,892 --> 01:44:35,602
I've used
alcohol my entire life

1294
01:44:37,605 --> 01:44:39,773
to replace the love
and attention

1295
01:44:39,857 --> 01:44:42,692
I never received
from my father.

1296
01:44:45,863 --> 01:44:47,906
But every drop of alcohol,

1297
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:49,783
every drop,

1298
01:44:51,077 --> 01:44:53,453
every one night stand,

1299
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:59,542
would never replace
the ache inside of me.

1300
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:01,753
An ache that only
God could fill.

1301
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:05,131
I tried to change.

1302
01:45:08,636 --> 01:45:11,680
But I failed every time.

1303
01:45:11,764 --> 01:45:15,100
And I know now that I'm
powerless without God.

1304
01:45:15,184 --> 01:45:18,103
But with his help,

1305
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:21,189
I found a freedom
from my pain and my habits

1306
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:26,152
that I never thought
was possible.

1307
01:45:28,322 --> 01:45:31,700
My family has suffered
for generations.

1308
01:45:31,784 --> 01:45:35,495
And I suffered because
of my father's pain.

1309
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:39,040
And my father suffered because
of his father's pain.

1310
01:45:44,005 --> 01:45:46,339
But this is how it changes.

1311
01:45:46,424 --> 01:45:50,010
This is where it changes.

1312
01:45:50,094 --> 01:45:53,346
And today I begin a new story.

1313
01:45:55,099 --> 01:45:57,809
I'm a child of God.

1314
01:45:57,893 --> 01:46:00,186
And I have a father
who loves me.

1315
01:46:02,857 --> 01:46:06,109
On and off the baseball field.

1316
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:13,158
Thank you for letting me share.

1317
01:46:35,514 --> 01:46:39,142
Another dream Passes through

1318
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:41,478
The night

1319
01:46:41,562 --> 01:46:45,106
Through the night

1320
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:53,948
Another night Cried
yourself To sleep

1321
01:46:54,033 --> 01:46:56,910
Mmmm

1322
01:46:59,538 --> 01:47:05,335
I'm thinking It's
over now This time

1323
01:47:05,419 --> 01:47:09,005
This time

1324
01:47:11,467 --> 01:47:18,098
I'm wishing It's
over now This time

1325
01:47:23,521 --> 01:47:26,856
I'm thinking It's over

1326
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:32,904
Yeah I'm thinking It's over

1327
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:41,287
I'm thinking It's over
but now it's your time

1328
01:47:41,372 --> 01:47:45,291
To change your life

1329
01:47:45,376 --> 01:47:47,210
Yeah

1330
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:50,839
And this is Your moment

1331
01:47:53,384 --> 01:48:01,384
This is Your moment

1332
01:48:01,934 --> 01:48:09,274
To change Your life

1333

And this is Your moment

1334
