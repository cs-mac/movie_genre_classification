1794
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:41,039
But we're
still floating.

1795
01:34:44,145 --> 01:34:45,877
See that school over there?

1796
01:34:45,879 --> 01:34:46,878
Yeah.

1797
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:47,879
It's where I met mommy.

1798
01:34:47,881 --> 01:34:50,048
Really?
- Yeah.

1799
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:51,850
She loved to sail.

1800
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:53,219
And we were taking lessons,

1801
01:34:53,221 --> 01:34:54,286
And it was at that point

1802
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:56,555
Where the instructor
paired us off in two

1803
01:34:56,557 --> 01:34:59,191
And sent us on out
on our own.

1804
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:04,363
Boy, I thought I'd dazzle her
with my nautical skills.

1805
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:10,869
And that's when
I almost capsized the boat.

1806
01:35:10,871 --> 01:35:14,906
She was so beautiful.

1807
01:35:14,908 --> 01:35:16,775
She still is.

1808
01:35:16,777 --> 01:35:23,048
I know.

1809
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:25,817
I'm sorry
she couldn't come.

1810
01:35:25,819 --> 01:35:29,921
Someday.

1811
01:35:29,923 --> 01:35:31,190
You think?

1812
01:35:31,192 --> 01:35:36,795
Yeah.

1813
01:35:36,797 --> 01:35:40,199
So about Alaska...

1814
01:35:40,201 --> 01:35:43,135
I hear it gets
pretty cold there.
