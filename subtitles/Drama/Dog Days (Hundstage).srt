1
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:39,577
Are you finished taking a piss?

2
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,019
Yes.

3
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:47,304
Do you have a problem? Sick of life?

4
00:00:47,586 --> 00:00:48,939
No problems.

5
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:54,384
She's mine, and I'm the only one
who looks at her, just me!

6
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:59,224
You don't look at her,
you don't touch her. Got that?

7
00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:01,060
Yeah?

8
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,896
What do you want from me?

9
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:57,656
Fuck off, asshole!
- What's this about?

10
00:01:57,866 --> 00:01:59,822
You want to fuck my girl?

11
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:01,903
Break it up!

12
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:05,462
Get lost!

13
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:08,984
What's your problem? Get lost!

14
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:12,098
You want me to mess up your face too?

15
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:13,654
Get lost!

16
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:16,936
You're telling me to get lost?
- Just go!

17
00:02:17,146 --> 00:02:19,421
Keep cool! He's leaving!

18
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:22,739
I don't care what you say.

19
00:02:22,946 --> 00:02:24,140
Fuck off!

20
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,145
What do you want?

21
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:31,259
Listen, why don't you just go home?

22
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,897
Mario, please let's go!

23
00:02:34,106 --> 00:02:38,338
I want this guy, okay?

24
00:02:38,546 --> 00:02:42,425
Go to hell, you piece of shit.
You're dead. Your ass is mine.

25
00:02:43,226 --> 00:02:44,898
Stay out it!

26
00:02:45,106 --> 00:02:47,939
Tell him to get his ass over here!

27
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:52,265
I'll get you, I swear. You're dead.

28
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:58,822
Have you gone crazy, Mario?

29
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:19,141
Mario!

30
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:10,659
Enough!

31
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,383
Stop! Get off of me.

32
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,735
Go away.

33
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:16,701
Get lost.

34
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:23,540
What's wrong?
- You think I'm stupid?

35
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,615
What?
- What do you think you're doing?

36
00:04:27,746 --> 00:04:30,783
What's wrong with you?
- Think I'm stupid or what?

37
00:04:30,986 --> 00:04:34,865
What's the matter Mario?
- Huh? Answer my question!

38
00:04:36,546 --> 00:04:38,264
Answer my question.

39
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,977
I said answer me!

40
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:43,339
What do you mean, no?

41
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:48,142
You really think I'm stupid, huh?

42
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:53,497
Is that what you think?

43
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:56,857
Tell me!

44
00:04:59,826 --> 00:05:02,056
Are you going to answer me?

45
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:05,303
Are you going to answer me?

46
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:08,464
Hands off. Are you going to answer?

47
00:05:09,746 --> 00:05:10,895
Are you?

48
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:14,137
You know what you are?

49
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:18,663
A filthy, stinking, rotten whore.

50
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,735
Do you think I'd fuck a whore?

51
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,339
You think so?

52
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:27,175
Claudia!

53
00:05:29,106 --> 00:05:32,223
Is that what you think?

54
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:33,575
Let go, Mario.

55
00:05:33,786 --> 00:05:36,220
Is that what you think?

56
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:38,261
Get lost!

57
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:11,900
DOG DAYS

58
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,703
Hey, stop it!

59
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:51,660
You drive me crazy with your arguing.

60
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:56,900
If you don't stop, I'll report you
for disturbing the peace.

61
00:09:46,106 --> 00:09:49,462
Remember, I was your secretary,
and you were married then, too.

62
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,622
I'm not as stupid as you think.

63
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:45,541
What did you buy, huh?
What did you get?

64
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:47,976
Ask my wife, I don't know.

65
00:10:48,186 --> 00:10:52,577
That a frankfurter you got there,
you know what they put in it?

66
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:57,382
Sodium nitrite, ascorbic acid,
anti-oxidation agents,

67
00:10:57,586 --> 00:11:00,976
di-, tri-, and poly-sulfates...
that's what they put in them.

68
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:03,815
That's what's in them.

69
00:11:04,026 --> 00:11:06,017
You know the 10 best grocery stores?

70
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:07,739
Merkur, Spar, Billa, Hofer,
Schlecker, Meindl,

71
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:10,540
Adeg, Mondo, Lîwa, Pam Pam.
Did you know that?

72
00:11:10,746 --> 00:11:13,897
Can you name them, too?
Can you give me a lift?

73
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:16,702
Can I have a ride?
Where are you going?

74
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:18,862
Can I have a ride?

75
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:25,501
Why not? Can't I come along?

76
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:38,504
Do you know the 10 most popular pets?

77
00:11:39,226 --> 00:11:42,343
Cat, dog, mouse...
- 1. Cats, 2. Dogs, 3. Birds,

78
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:46,061
4. Aquarium fish, 5. Hamsters,
6. Guinea pigs,

79
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:49,815
7. Mice, 8. Rabbits, 9. Rats,
10. Turtles.

80
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:52,062
You eat lots of marshmallows?

81
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:56,339
You like the white or black ones best?

82
00:11:56,546 --> 00:11:58,616
If I get a craving, I'll eat both.

83
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:02,854
So what do you eat?

84
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:05,017
I can eat frankfurters by the kilo.

85
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:07,945
On a good day,
like when I used to...

86
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:11,736
How many pairs do you eat?

87
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:15,703
What? Sausage pairs?

88
00:12:15,946 --> 00:12:20,497
Now I eat two,
but I used to eat ten on a good day.

89
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,261
Ten frankfurters?

90
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:26,936
You're so fat, it's unhealthy.
It could kill you.

91
00:12:28,586 --> 00:12:31,180
She's a chatterbox, worse than me.

92
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:38,184
You're also pretty fat, you know.
- 'Cause I'm not too lazy to eat.

93
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:42,938
It's unhealthy to eat so much,
you'll get a heart attack.

94
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:44,784
Oh, be quiet.

95
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:50,661
As long as I feel no pain,
I can eat what I want.

96
00:12:50,866 --> 00:12:54,984
And once there's pain,
you have to stop anyway.

97
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:58,343
Spareribs with honey,
pork chops, steaks.

98
00:12:59,226 --> 00:13:03,060
Try the new Kottnyi seasoning mix.

99
00:13:04,386 --> 00:13:06,854
Where would I be without Kottnyi?

100
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,261
Do you wake up with a hard-on?
Do you?

101
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:17,218
Don't talk like that.

102
00:13:17,426 --> 00:13:18,825
Do you still have sex?

103
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:21,216
That's a company secret.

104
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,576
Are you too old?
Can you still do it?

105
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,902
I can, I still can.

106
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,859
Earlobes, you have such big earlobes.

107
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:32,942
And you have such a big tongue!

108
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:26,541
These sweltering dog days
just won't let up.

109
00:15:26,746 --> 00:15:29,783
We've got more subtropical air
headed for Austria.

110
00:15:29,986 --> 00:15:35,344
If you're sensitive to the weather,
look forward to headaches...

111
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:17,215
Good afternoon.

112
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,223
Oh, God,
his hair is everywhere.

113
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:43,584
Do the sink, please.

114
00:18:10,746 --> 00:18:15,774
The Austrians have obviously
practiced and are playing well today.

115
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:36,662
The traffic update for Lower Austria:

116
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:41,303
The present heat wave
has caused asphalt damage...

117
00:19:41,506 --> 00:19:46,626
leading to numerous problems
on highways and other major roads.

118
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:52,657
The police requests all drivers
to drive carefully. More delays...

119
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:18,416
Are you Mr. Walter?

120
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:22,096
My name's Hruby, I'm a technician
for alarm systems engineering.

121
00:21:26,826 --> 00:21:32,583
We are offering consulting on new
security systems in your neighborhood.

122
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:35,704
I'd like to tell you about
the different options.

123
00:21:35,906 --> 00:21:39,694
I see you've gotten a start
with a video surveillance camera,

124
00:21:39,906 --> 00:21:42,898
for observation and all, great.

125
00:21:43,106 --> 00:21:45,984
But I don't see
an alarm system anywhere.

126
00:21:46,186 --> 00:21:50,498
Nowadays we have technology
that's affordable and effective.

127
00:21:50,706 --> 00:21:54,301
Radio controlled devices
or a direct link to the police...

128
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:57,066
will let you rest at ease at night.

129
00:21:57,386 --> 00:21:59,377
I assume you have no alarm system?

130
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:02,384
No, but a good, mean watchdog.

131
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:04,976
He's the best, all I need.
- May I say this:

132
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:07,177
A dog may be man's best friend,

133
00:22:07,386 --> 00:22:09,581
but man is not dog's best friend.

134
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,619
A dog needs protection too,
believe me.

135
00:22:12,946 --> 00:22:14,345
My dog is enough.

136
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:17,740
He's mean, doesn't trust anyone.

137
00:22:17,946 --> 00:22:21,780
What if something happens to the dog?

138
00:22:22,146 --> 00:22:24,501
Things can happen to people, too.

139
00:22:25,906 --> 00:22:27,624
Come Girlie, get in here.

140
00:22:34,226 --> 00:22:34,976
Come.

141
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:45,057
You bought everything on the list?

142
00:22:45,786 --> 00:22:48,539
I see the laundry is already done.

143
00:22:48,746 --> 00:22:51,704
The sheets, too?
- They're in there now.

144
00:22:51,946 --> 00:22:56,178
But use the old soap please,
the new one is bad for my skin.

145
00:22:56,386 --> 00:23:00,095
I still had some of the old soap left.

146
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:42,019
Again! They cheated me again!

147
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,025
The crooks!

148
00:24:03,706 --> 00:24:06,903
Go ahead and weigh it, you'll see.
Check it yourself,

149
00:24:07,106 --> 00:24:09,097
I used a good scale.

150
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:12,104
A calibrated gram scale.

151
00:24:12,306 --> 00:24:13,455
I don't understand it.

152
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:18,581
They save a little on each one.
Multiply that by 100 packages...

153
00:24:18,786 --> 00:24:20,583
Here you have thousands of them.

154
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:23,300
I'm sure this is an exception.

155
00:24:23,906 --> 00:24:27,694
That's what you say,
but I have to come back like now.

156
00:24:27,906 --> 00:24:30,704
I'm sweating
and I get upset each time.

157
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:34,979
This is all unnecessary
and should be avoided...

158
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:38,424
if you want to keep your
regular customers happy.

159
00:24:38,786 --> 00:24:41,744
You're absolutely right.
- How about giving me the money...

160
00:24:41,946 --> 00:24:44,904
for all the gas I burn to get here.

161
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,381
How about 2 cans of dog food?

162
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:51,817
That won't even cover a liter of gas.

163
00:24:59,506 --> 00:25:02,100
A beauty of a car. A real beauty.

164
00:25:02,346 --> 00:25:06,624
BMW convertible, right?
A beauty. What's your name?

165
00:25:06,826 --> 00:25:10,216
Norbert.
- Where're you going? Can I come along?

166
00:25:10,466 --> 00:25:12,218
I'm only going to the supermarket.

167
00:25:12,426 --> 00:25:15,657
Can I have ride in your convertible?

168
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:24,981
That's the melody. You got it already?

169
00:25:30,586 --> 00:25:33,339
The words aren't hard either.

170
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:36,260
Oh Haka furnishes your kitchen,

171
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:39,617
in just 9 days,
measured to perfection.

172
00:25:39,826 --> 00:25:40,576
Hurrah.

173
00:25:40,786 --> 00:25:42,856
Ha ha ha ha Haka!

174
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:46,536
So, now you know the words?
- You'll have to sing it again.

175
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:50,022
Oh Haka furnishes your kitchen,

176
00:25:50,226 --> 00:25:54,060
in just 9 days,
measured to perfection.

177
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:55,301
Hurrah.

178
00:25:55,506 --> 00:25:56,621
Now you sing it.

179
00:25:56,826 --> 00:25:59,784
Oh Haka furnishes your kitchen,

180
00:25:59,986 --> 00:26:04,104
in just 9 days,
measured to perfection.

181
00:26:04,746 --> 00:26:05,861
Hurrah.

182
00:26:06,506 --> 00:26:09,259
And then you go:
Ha ha ha ha Haka...

183
00:26:09,466 --> 00:26:14,779
Furnishes your kitchen
in just 9 days, measured to perfection.

184
00:26:19,506 --> 00:26:21,178
It's the beginning, not the end?

185
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:22,421
No, it's the end.

186
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:27,016
Can I listen to a tape?

187
00:26:27,226 --> 00:26:29,660
Sure. What is on it? Is it good?

188
00:26:29,866 --> 00:26:32,221
Yes, it's got my favorite song.

189
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:37,015
It's a great tape.
- Then let's hear it.

190
00:26:37,626 --> 00:26:39,981
Here, it's on here.
How do you put it in?

191
00:26:40,186 --> 00:26:41,505
My song's on here.

192
00:26:42,106 --> 00:26:43,824
I hope it's the right side.

193
00:26:44,026 --> 00:26:46,381
Where do you turn it on?

194
00:26:48,626 --> 00:26:50,025
Is this the song?

195
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:07,903
Pretty. You're a romantic, huh?
Totally, huh?

196
00:27:10,466 --> 00:27:14,664
The mood is perfect, fine weather,
sun, what more could one want?

197
00:27:15,306 --> 00:27:17,661
Monja...

198
00:27:33,426 --> 00:27:34,825
Well, come on in.

199
00:28:05,186 --> 00:28:06,585
It's me, your mother.

200
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:09,619
I'm just calling to tell you I feel lousy.

201
00:28:09,826 --> 00:28:12,659
My heart hurts,
I feel like I'm suffocating,

202
00:28:12,866 --> 00:28:17,496
the heat, I can hardly stand it.
I can't sleep.

203
00:28:17,706 --> 00:28:21,301
And I don't know
if I took enough medicine,

204
00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:23,861
I just don't remember.

205
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:27,581
My feet ache and they're real swollen.

206
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:30,175
When are you going to call me?

207
00:28:41,506 --> 00:28:44,020
Hey baby.
Hi there, my favorite tush.

208
00:28:44,226 --> 00:28:46,262
About tonight, that sounds fine.

209
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:49,139
I'll be there. This evening is ours.

210
00:28:49,346 --> 00:28:50,699
Just the two of us.

211
00:28:50,906 --> 00:28:54,216
Get yourself prettied up.

212
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:57,463
Alright. See ya. I love you.

213
00:29:51,026 --> 00:29:52,425
Mr. Theodorakis?

214
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:55,265
The security man?
- That's right, exactly.

215
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,985
The bathroom.

216
00:29:58,186 --> 00:30:01,303
Ah, there's a skylight,
that shouldn't be a problem.

217
00:30:01,546 --> 00:30:02,740
Nice, very nice.

218
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:04,982
And this?

219
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:07,461
A closet.

220
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,939
No windows, right?

221
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:12,905
The room you share with your wife?

222
00:30:13,106 --> 00:30:16,018
I once shared with my ex-wife.

223
00:30:16,226 --> 00:30:18,535
Now it's just my room.

224
00:30:18,746 --> 00:30:21,101
The window's over here.

225
00:30:24,386 --> 00:30:26,741
Let me just check how high we are.

226
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:29,738
Another window here.

227
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:42,701
Your wife's bedroom?
- My ex-wife's chapel, yes.

228
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:44,658
Yes well, to each his own.

229
00:30:44,866 --> 00:30:48,222
Here we've got one window
and one skylight.

230
00:30:50,986 --> 00:30:52,419
One window.

231
00:30:53,386 --> 00:30:55,138
One skylight.

232
00:30:55,906 --> 00:30:59,615
The children's bedroom, how nice.
Here we have one window.

233
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:01,422
Adorable.

234
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,186
My God, what a cute child.

235
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:07,218
How old is your little girl?

236
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:08,336
She's not here.

237
00:31:08,546 --> 00:31:09,899
Oh... not here.

238
00:31:11,266 --> 00:31:12,858
She's at her grandma's?

239
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:14,579
No, she's just not here.

240
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:16,221
I understand.

241
00:31:16,986 --> 00:31:20,456
Is everyone in your profession
so nosy?

242
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:22,145
There's no way around it.

243
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:25,099
To sell security,
I need to know the situation.

244
00:31:25,306 --> 00:31:28,855
I need to give each client
exactly what he needs.

245
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:30,545
Fine. Let's continue.

246
00:31:36,906 --> 00:31:39,261
What's your name?

247
00:31:40,826 --> 00:31:42,623
And yours?

248
00:31:42,946 --> 00:31:46,097
Where are you from?

249
00:31:46,306 --> 00:31:49,423
Is it a real leather bag?
- No, it's plastic.

250
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:51,582
It's plastic? Looks like leather.

251
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:53,663
It's a good imitation.

252
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:57,463
It's pretty, a pretty bag you have.

253
00:31:58,466 --> 00:32:01,663
Did you take anything out of my bag?

254
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:05,774
Why don't you wear them?
It's sunny, you have to wear them.

255
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:08,136
I'm wearing these. I decide that.

256
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:12,259
This one's real leather though, huh?

257
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:14,104
I told you it's plastic.

258
00:32:14,306 --> 00:32:16,615
This one? The wallet's plastic too?

259
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:19,294
Leave it closed, I don't like that!

260
00:32:25,906 --> 00:32:27,225
You have lots of cards in here.

261
00:32:27,426 --> 00:32:29,382
Please close my purse now!

262
00:32:29,586 --> 00:32:31,702
How many times do I have to tell you?

263
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:37,577
Where are your manners?

264
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:39,738
I'm going to throw you out right now.

265
00:32:39,946 --> 00:32:42,540
Are you always so grumpy?
- No. But people normally...

266
00:32:42,746 --> 00:32:46,261
don't go through my bag.
I don't go through yours, after all.

267
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:49,496
What pretty hair. Pretty hair.

268
00:32:50,906 --> 00:32:52,783
Have you closed my purse now?

269
00:32:59,306 --> 00:33:02,343
But you're not a good driver, huh?

270
00:33:04,186 --> 00:33:05,585
You don't drive very well.

271
00:33:05,786 --> 00:33:07,139
Who says?

272
00:33:07,346 --> 00:33:08,096
It's so bumpy.

273
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:10,257
Got it?

274
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:12,099
You have to get out.

275
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:16,458
How old are you? You're old, huh?

276
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:18,145
Anna, get out please.

277
00:33:19,586 --> 00:33:21,781
Do you still get your period?

278
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,579
Anna, get out!

279
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:28,461
Do you still have sex?
Do you still have a boyfriend?

280
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,537
You don't, huh? You're too old.

281
00:33:30,746 --> 00:33:32,065
Will you get out now!

282
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:01,782
Here you've got something...

283
00:35:02,306 --> 00:35:04,900
A sore muscle, neuralgia, hm?

284
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:04,220
Here you are.

285
00:37:06,706 --> 00:37:11,939
I'd like to ask a favor.
You've been smoking again. I smell it.

286
00:37:12,386 --> 00:37:14,342
No, you smell something else.

287
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:16,935
Have you ever caught me smoking?
- No, I haven't,

288
00:37:17,146 --> 00:37:19,819
but I can smell it.

289
00:37:20,106 --> 00:37:22,745
Who knows what you're smelling?

290
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,054
Don't forget my money.

291
00:37:27,266 --> 00:37:28,984
I haven't.

292
00:37:29,466 --> 00:37:32,902
Have it all ready for you. Here you go.

293
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:35,495
Now I'd like to ask you a favor.

294
00:37:35,706 --> 00:37:38,425
I'd like you to stay here tonight.

295
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:43,381
I can't today, unfortunately.
I've already made plans.

296
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:46,099
With a man?

297
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:49,378
That's none of your business.
No, I really can't today,

298
00:37:49,586 --> 00:37:51,702
but how about if I come tomorrow?

299
00:37:52,226 --> 00:37:55,582
Sure, that wouldn't be bad either.

300
00:37:55,786 --> 00:38:00,906
You can make us a nice meal,
a nice pork roast, with dumplings,

301
00:38:01,506 --> 00:38:04,623
maybe some sauerkraut,
some tasty gravy.

302
00:38:09,786 --> 00:38:13,142
The ten sexiest TV show hosts?

303
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:16,418
No. 1. Marie Christine Guiliani,

304
00:38:21,506 --> 00:38:23,895
7. Lizzi Engstler,
8. Karin Resetaris,

305
00:38:24,106 --> 00:38:25,858
9. Ingrid Thurnher,
10. Hannelore Veith.

306
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:28,626
Did you know them?

307
00:38:30,346 --> 00:38:33,782
Need a break
'Cause your boss is mad?

308
00:38:33,986 --> 00:38:36,739
He always is, so you must
have a snack, a Fruchtikus.

309
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:38,664
'Cause afternoons
Are twice as bad.

310
00:38:38,866 --> 00:38:42,142
D'Arbo Fruchtikus,
a between-meal fruity plus.

311
00:38:43,786 --> 00:38:46,175
You watch a lot of TV, right?
- Shopping never was much fun...

312
00:38:46,386 --> 00:38:49,423
till I spied it:
Fruchtikus, it's the one!

313
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:51,299
D'Arbo Fruchtikus!

314
00:38:51,506 --> 00:38:55,135
A between-meal fruity plus.

315
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:59,464
Stop talking or you'll be walking!

316
00:39:01,786 --> 00:39:05,620
You reach for banana-pear,
and soon you find that you don't care.

317
00:39:05,826 --> 00:39:08,420
D'Arbo Fruchtikus,
a between-meal fruity must.

318
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:12,579
You know the 10 best supermarkets?
- I don't want to know.

319
00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:15,346
Merkur, Spar, Billa, Hofer,
Schlecker, Meindl, Adeg, Mondo,

320
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:16,695
Lîwa, Pam Pam.

321
00:39:17,626 --> 00:39:20,094
Can you be quiet a few minutes!
Unbelievable!

322
00:39:24,226 --> 00:39:27,104
What's all this stuff
you have in your bag?

323
00:39:28,626 --> 00:39:30,105
There you go again!

324
00:39:30,306 --> 00:39:34,015
What kind of pen is this?
- None of your business! Put it back!

325
00:39:34,386 --> 00:39:37,184
Okay, I've had it with you moron.

326
00:39:37,386 --> 00:39:38,580
She's a pain in the neck, man!

327
00:39:38,826 --> 00:39:41,738
You know
the 10 most common diseases?

328
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:45,939
1. Allergies, 2. Migraine,
3. Gastritis, 4. Arthritis,

329
00:39:46,146 --> 00:39:49,616
5. Diabetes, 6. Asthma,
7. Heart disease,

330
00:39:49,946 --> 00:39:53,382
8. Cancer, 9. Liver cirrhosis,
10. Stroke.

331
00:39:53,586 --> 00:39:55,975
Do you have any of them?

332
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:58,381
If you keep on like this, a stroke.

333
00:39:58,586 --> 00:40:00,144
You have that one, huh?

334
00:40:00,386 --> 00:40:02,217
You're absolutely impossible.

335
00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:05,983
Can't you just sit there
and be quiet?

336
00:40:06,506 --> 00:40:09,259
That can't be too hard.

337
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:11,104
Hey, leave the bag alone!

338
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:15,096
You know the 10 most used pills?
- Put it down right now!

339
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:21,663
I've had it. Out with you this minute!

340
00:40:21,946 --> 00:40:23,743
Get out! Out with you!

341
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:26,261
I'll dump water on you.

342
00:40:27,946 --> 00:40:30,779
8. Renault Twingo, 9. VW Lupo...

343
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:35,301
Get out and get lost, fucking moron!

344
00:40:36,426 --> 00:40:39,020
What a pain in the ass!

345
00:40:56,146 --> 00:40:58,614
Scratched here on the side.

346
00:40:59,586 --> 00:41:01,224
I can't believe it.

347
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:06,144
And it's black too. I'm speechless.
Just look at this.

348
00:41:06,346 --> 00:41:08,257
It's terrible.

349
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,663
Looks like Modern Art.
Probably a screwdriver.

350
00:41:11,866 --> 00:41:13,743
If he had at least signed his name.

351
00:41:13,946 --> 00:41:15,504
I can imagine who it was.

352
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:19,016
Now we can do something good.
Not like last time.

353
00:41:19,506 --> 00:41:21,974
Wait a second,
last time was all right.

354
00:41:22,266 --> 00:41:25,019
Not my fault he didn't do anything.

355
00:41:25,226 --> 00:41:27,023
You should have been more patient.

356
00:41:27,226 --> 00:41:30,218
It's a scandal. Now it's hit us.
- Yes, it's terrible.

357
00:41:30,426 --> 00:41:33,816
Every month they destroy a car,

358
00:41:34,026 --> 00:41:35,254
but only the new ones.

359
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:37,741
They don't touch the old ones.

360
00:41:40,906 --> 00:41:43,864
On both sides.
It must have been a gang.

361
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:47,297
It's not as if someone
would go along and then stop.

362
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:50,384
One on the left, one on the right.

363
00:41:50,746 --> 00:41:51,735
If we catch them...

364
00:41:51,946 --> 00:41:53,982
They deserve it. It would be good...

365
00:41:54,186 --> 00:41:55,221
to wring their necks...

366
00:41:55,426 --> 00:41:58,259
We must catch them.

367
00:41:59,026 --> 00:42:02,780
We can't just sit and wait for them,
can we?

368
00:42:03,746 --> 00:42:05,941
I don't make money on those cases,

369
00:42:06,146 --> 00:42:08,137
I'm doing it mainly for the prestige.

370
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:12,303
Since we're alone,
I'm going to be open with you.

371
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:15,782
I feel you're making a fool of me.
I hired you...

372
00:42:15,986 --> 00:42:17,897
How do you mean?
- It cost money, didn't it?

373
00:42:18,106 --> 00:42:21,621
Now I'm hiring you again, more money.
Let me say it like this:

374
00:42:21,826 --> 00:42:24,977
If nothing happens this time,
I'm turning it over to a lawyer.

375
00:42:25,186 --> 00:42:28,781
Or I'll take a hammer
and smash that car to pieces,

376
00:42:28,986 --> 00:42:30,897
and probably someone's head too.

377
00:42:31,906 --> 00:42:32,941
Let me do my work.

378
00:42:59,626 --> 00:43:01,105
Hello, Hruby speaking.

379
00:43:02,306 --> 00:43:04,024
Please Honey, not again!

380
00:43:04,986 --> 00:43:08,103
I'm on some parking lot,
in the middle of changing clothes.

381
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:12,543
I'm sweaty, that's why.
Stupid question.

382
00:43:12,746 --> 00:43:15,180
Why do you think
I always take an extra shirt?

383
00:43:15,386 --> 00:43:16,580
No, today's impossible.

384
00:43:16,786 --> 00:43:20,017
I won't be able to get home today.
Same as last time.

385
00:43:20,426 --> 00:43:24,465
I have to work all night.
I'm getting the equipment now.

386
00:44:57,186 --> 00:44:59,063
Ya... ya... what?

387
00:45:01,706 --> 00:45:02,741
Yasou.

388
00:45:04,346 --> 00:45:07,224
I'm going to sing you
a Greek drinking song.

389
00:45:23,386 --> 00:45:24,580
That's it?

390
00:45:58,626 --> 00:46:00,537
Come on, let's go inside.

391
00:46:01,066 --> 00:46:03,136
Really? It's so nice out here.

392
00:46:04,226 --> 00:46:07,616
Honey, with me it's nice indoors, too.
Let's go.

393
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:36,336
Oh how good I feel at night,

394
00:46:39,626 --> 00:46:44,302
When the bells ring at last light.

395
00:46:47,186 --> 00:46:49,222
Ding-dong.

396
00:46:49,746 --> 00:46:54,137
Oh how good I feel at night,

397
00:46:56,986 --> 00:47:00,740
When the bells ring at last light.

398
00:47:27,546 --> 00:47:28,979
Hop, hop, hop,

399
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:35,103
Horsy goes gallop.

400
00:47:35,306 --> 00:47:37,536
Through the fields
And through the woods...

401
00:47:37,946 --> 00:47:39,425
Hop, hop, hop,

402
00:47:39,826 --> 00:47:41,578
Horsy goes gallop.

403
00:48:19,226 --> 00:48:21,103
Hop, hop, hop...

404
00:48:40,746 --> 00:48:42,896
Are you a princess? A real princess?

405
00:48:43,106 --> 00:48:44,619
No, unfortunately not.

406
00:48:45,306 --> 00:48:46,978
Not a princess.

407
00:48:47,186 --> 00:48:50,223
My family had a title, though.
Von Kroneck.

408
00:48:51,026 --> 00:48:54,905
But titles of nobility
were abolished in Austria in 1918.

409
00:48:55,306 --> 00:48:58,901
Now they're just normal last names.

410
00:48:59,786 --> 00:49:02,744
After all, we're about
to enter the 21st century.

411
00:49:05,186 --> 00:49:08,144
But you used to be a real princess?

412
00:49:08,626 --> 00:49:12,938
No, but I would have had
a position at court.

413
00:49:13,546 --> 00:49:14,820
As it is, I get by.

414
00:49:15,106 --> 00:49:16,698
Do you go to church? Do you?

415
00:49:16,906 --> 00:49:18,180
Of course.

416
00:49:18,386 --> 00:49:21,344
I always go to church, too.

417
00:49:21,546 --> 00:49:23,059
I know some hymns.

418
00:49:23,266 --> 00:49:26,303
They often sing Holy God,
We Praise Thy Name in church.

419
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:28,224
You know that one?

420
00:49:28,426 --> 00:49:32,214
Holy God we praise Thy name,

421
00:49:32,706 --> 00:49:37,382
Lord of all we bow before Thee;

422
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:43,016
All on Earth Thy scepter claim,

423
00:49:43,986 --> 00:49:49,618
All in heav'n above adore Thee;

424
00:49:50,586 --> 00:49:55,501
Infinite Thy vast domain,

425
00:49:56,626 --> 00:50:01,495
Everlasting is Thy reign.

426
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:03,185
Do you like church?

427
00:50:03,386 --> 00:50:04,296
Yes, very much.

428
00:50:04,506 --> 00:50:07,020
I like to sing, and it's so nice there.

429
00:50:07,226 --> 00:50:10,298
I'm not going to church any more
because it all lasts so long.

430
00:50:10,506 --> 00:50:12,542
You can do what you want.

431
00:50:12,746 --> 00:50:14,145
We have freedom of religion.

432
00:50:14,346 --> 00:50:18,624
I like the Virgin Mary
and the baby Jesus. I like them.

433
00:50:18,906 --> 00:50:22,615
I've got a statuette at home
and Lordes water...

434
00:50:22,826 --> 00:50:24,145
from Our Lady of Lordes.

435
00:50:24,346 --> 00:50:27,816
Have you ever been to Lourdes?

436
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:30,824
And you can unscrew her head,
and the Lordes water is inside.

437
00:50:31,026 --> 00:50:32,345
It's pronounced Lourdes.

438
00:50:32,546 --> 00:50:34,423
Have you been there?

439
00:50:34,626 --> 00:50:36,696
There's holy water there.

440
00:50:36,906 --> 00:50:38,942
I know.

441
00:50:39,146 --> 00:50:41,785
But people who go to Lourdes
are mostly sick.

442
00:50:41,986 --> 00:50:45,376
You're sick already? You're a bit old.

443
00:50:45,586 --> 00:50:48,225
You've got weird teeth.
- I'm not that old.

444
00:50:48,426 --> 00:50:49,142
Weird teeth.

445
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,621
Nothing unusual. Everyone has teeth.

446
00:50:51,986 --> 00:50:55,740
But yours are kind of weird.

447
00:50:55,946 --> 00:50:57,220
And we can change too.

448
00:50:57,426 --> 00:50:58,905
Do you ever leak a little?

449
00:50:59,106 --> 00:51:03,258
Because often old women wet their
pants and have to use diapers.

450
00:51:03,466 --> 00:51:06,026
I told you I'm only 50.

451
00:51:06,226 --> 00:51:08,501
Often they pee in their pants,

452
00:51:08,706 --> 00:51:10,378
and then they have to wear diapers.

453
00:51:10,906 --> 00:51:12,976
They can't help it.
- Oh dear, that's sad.

454
00:51:13,186 --> 00:51:16,940
They pee in their pants. Do you?
- I don't like conversations like this.

455
00:51:17,146 --> 00:51:19,535
They're not interesting at all.

456
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:20,542
You don't do that too?

457
00:51:20,746 --> 00:51:24,136
My goodness,
I'm a well-groomed young woman.

458
00:51:25,066 --> 00:51:26,658
You know Star of the Sea?

459
00:51:26,866 --> 00:51:28,424
I sing it a lot at home.

460
00:51:28,626 --> 00:51:32,221
Star of the Sea I praise thee

461
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,737
Oh help me, Mary.

462
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:40,500
Sweet Mother of God

463
00:51:41,586 --> 00:51:45,295
Oh help me, Mary.

464
00:52:49,946 --> 00:52:52,062
My favorite little piece of ass!

465
00:52:56,746 --> 00:52:59,340
Yes, my horny little nympho.

466
00:53:02,826 --> 00:53:07,138
Chef-surprise:
batter-fried calamari rings.

467
00:53:07,426 --> 00:53:10,543
Oh yes, my little cunt,

468
00:53:11,266 --> 00:53:12,904
you've been waiting for me, hm?

469
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,415
You naughty little girl.

470
00:53:17,586 --> 00:53:20,020
A vagina lick-toris.

471
00:53:22,026 --> 00:53:23,744
You wild little thing...

472
00:53:23,946 --> 00:53:28,383
Your juices are dripping
into your stockings.

473
00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:35,098
They're about to slip,
you're dripping wet...

474
00:53:35,466 --> 00:53:40,301
As soon as you smell my little friend,
you go crazy with anticipation.

475
00:53:41,746 --> 00:53:45,978
Pussy's meowing now,
it knows what's about to come.

476
00:53:48,146 --> 00:53:51,582
And here comes Edward Scissorhands.

477
00:53:53,786 --> 00:53:55,458
Freddy Krueger.

478
00:53:57,546 --> 00:53:59,218
What? Are you crazy?

479
00:54:00,306 --> 00:54:02,342
What do you mean,
Ow, you idiot.

480
00:54:02,626 --> 00:54:05,265
How dare you?

481
00:54:05,466 --> 00:54:06,865
Who's he?
- That's Lucky.

482
00:54:07,066 --> 00:54:08,499
How do you do, I'm Lucky.

483
00:54:08,706 --> 00:54:10,822
Didn't you hear? I'm Lucky.

484
00:54:11,186 --> 00:54:12,858
Can't you shake his hand?

485
00:54:13,066 --> 00:54:15,136
Be good and shake hands.

486
00:54:15,346 --> 00:54:17,940
Hello. Name's Lucky, Ma'am.

487
00:54:18,146 --> 00:54:20,535
How can you humiliate me so?

488
00:54:20,786 --> 00:54:24,017
You're humiliating yourself!

489
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:25,815
What an asshole.

490
00:54:53,546 --> 00:54:56,504
Listen, let's play a drinking game.

491
00:54:57,146 --> 00:55:01,059
You say a word, I repeat your word...

492
00:55:01,266 --> 00:55:03,302
and say another one.

493
00:55:04,586 --> 00:55:08,295
Then she repeats both of our words
and says a new one...

494
00:55:08,506 --> 00:55:10,019
And we keep going like that.

495
00:55:10,226 --> 00:55:13,377
And if you make a mistake,
you have to drink a shot of vodka.

496
00:55:13,586 --> 00:55:15,656
Two words that make sense?

497
00:55:15,866 --> 00:55:16,696
No, one.

498
00:55:17,106 --> 00:55:18,221
You start.

499
00:55:19,266 --> 00:55:20,415
Go...

500
00:55:20,626 --> 00:55:21,979
Go shit...

501
00:55:22,306 --> 00:55:23,898
Exactly. That's what I meant.

502
00:55:24,106 --> 00:55:25,778
Shut the fuck up.

503
00:55:26,826 --> 00:55:28,817
I can't shut the fuck up.

504
00:55:29,026 --> 00:55:30,345
You go shit!

505
00:55:30,546 --> 00:55:31,581
Wrong!

506
00:55:31,986 --> 00:55:33,385
Go shit, you...

507
00:55:33,586 --> 00:55:35,019
If at all.

508
00:55:35,226 --> 00:55:37,899
Now you have to drink a shot of vodka.

509
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,299
Yes sir, a shot-o-vodka.

510
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:44,174
Lucky, if you were as tall
as you are stupid,

511
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:47,184
you could drink out
of a skyscraper's rain-gutter.

512
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:50,662
She made a mistake! She has to drink.

513
00:55:50,866 --> 00:55:52,743
Pour the vodka and shut up.

514
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:58,180
She's got to drink a shot of vodka.

515
00:55:59,946 --> 00:56:01,857
Sit down and shut up.

516
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:03,294
Make her drink a shot of vodka.

517
00:56:03,506 --> 00:56:06,020
Sit down and shut up.

518
00:56:06,226 --> 00:56:08,820
She has to drink a shot of vodka!

519
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:12,138
Teddy bear, calm down.

520
00:56:12,346 --> 00:56:14,143
Don't get all worked up.

521
00:56:14,986 --> 00:56:16,658
She said it wrong.

522
00:56:16,866 --> 00:56:19,903
Are we playing by the rules,

523
00:56:20,106 --> 00:56:20,936
or aren't we?

524
00:56:23,226 --> 00:56:24,978
Let's start over:

525
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:27,816
Wickerl, you say a word.

526
00:56:28,026 --> 00:56:29,744
I repeat the word...

527
00:56:29,946 --> 00:56:31,584
and say another word on top of it.

528
00:56:31,786 --> 00:56:34,425
She says your word, my word,

529
00:56:34,626 --> 00:56:36,423
and another word on top of that.

530
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:38,981
You say your word, my word, her word,

531
00:56:39,186 --> 00:56:41,097
and another one.

532
00:56:41,306 --> 00:56:43,774
I say your word, my word, her word,

533
00:56:43,986 --> 00:56:46,216
your word, and another word.

534
00:56:46,426 --> 00:56:47,575
I start.

535
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:50,255
I...

536
00:56:52,946 --> 00:56:55,460
Gaius Julius Caesar.

537
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:57,224
Come on, Wickerl:

538
00:56:58,786 --> 00:57:00,617
I...

539
00:57:01,106 --> 00:57:02,585
...shit.
- Yes!

540
00:57:04,266 --> 00:57:05,494
I go...

541
00:57:06,826 --> 00:57:08,305
Are you going to go shit now...

542
00:57:08,506 --> 00:57:10,417
so we can have a drink in peace?

543
00:57:10,706 --> 00:57:12,139
Wrong, Wickerl. Drink!

544
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:13,415
Because you have to say...

545
00:57:13,626 --> 00:57:15,856
the two words: go shit.

546
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,540
You have to repeat mine, too.

547
00:57:17,746 --> 00:57:20,579
OK, now we're playing right.

548
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,784
If you make a mistake,

549
00:57:22,986 --> 00:57:23,702
you drink.

550
00:57:24,666 --> 00:57:25,815
I...

551
00:57:30,306 --> 00:57:31,455
I go...

552
00:57:31,706 --> 00:57:32,821
I go...

553
00:57:33,026 --> 00:57:34,778
Come on, say something.

554
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:37,781
Come on.

555
00:57:38,506 --> 00:57:39,905
I go...

556
00:57:40,986 --> 00:57:42,260
...shit.

557
00:57:47,666 --> 00:57:51,625
That's all I can think of
when I look at you two sorry creatures.

558
00:57:51,826 --> 00:57:54,977
You have to say I go shit,
not just shit.

559
00:57:55,666 --> 00:57:59,625
Don't you get it? Are you that dense?

560
00:58:00,306 --> 00:58:02,866
Say: I go shit.

561
00:58:03,066 --> 00:58:06,456
I go shit. From the look of you,
you have to go shit too.

562
00:58:08,546 --> 00:58:12,175
I go shit. From the look of you,
you have to go shit too.

563
00:58:12,786 --> 00:58:15,983
I go shit. From the look of you,
you have to go shit too.

564
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:18,015
...if...

565
00:58:20,346 --> 00:58:22,735
If nothing better comes along.

566
00:58:23,506 --> 00:58:25,542
He's so stupid.

567
00:58:27,706 --> 00:58:30,345
Don't you get it, or is it too hard?

568
00:58:31,226 --> 00:58:34,935
It's a stupid game.

569
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:39,295
I don't feel like playing this
dumb game any more.

570
00:58:40,026 --> 00:58:40,856
I don't feel like...

571
00:58:41,066 --> 00:58:42,784
playing this any more.

572
00:58:52,146 --> 00:58:56,025
Listen! I told you I'd probably
be gone all night.

573
00:58:57,266 --> 00:59:00,303
How should I know?
I'm observing the lot...

574
00:59:00,506 --> 00:59:02,258
where they scratched the cars.

575
00:59:02,946 --> 00:59:05,585
I really hope I catch him this time.

576
00:59:05,786 --> 00:59:07,697
Otherwise it's another wasted night.

577
00:59:08,506 --> 00:59:09,905
I know, I know.

578
00:59:10,106 --> 00:59:14,258
No, I haven't forgotten.
I don't forget things.

579
00:59:15,266 --> 00:59:16,540
Don't worry.

580
00:59:19,066 --> 00:59:20,977
Look, it's late.

581
00:59:21,906 --> 00:59:23,624
Go to bed and sleep.

582
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:26,135
And stop bothering me at work.

583
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:29,385
Okay then, go to sleep, bye.

584
00:59:53,346 --> 00:59:55,496
Disgusting.

585
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:57,903
Tell him he can't do that.

586
00:59:58,106 --> 00:59:59,744
With us anything goes.

587
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:02,422
Please stop it, Wickerl.

588
01:00:02,706 --> 01:00:04,537
Drink.
- I can't drink that.

589
01:00:04,746 --> 01:00:06,623
I said: Drink!
I can't...

590
01:00:09,346 --> 01:00:10,904
I already feel sick.

591
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:13,861
Then we'll have
a group vomiting session.

592
01:00:16,466 --> 01:00:19,981
Stop it!
Stop the shit, and do it quick!

593
01:00:27,986 --> 01:00:31,217
Come on, sing something for me.

594
01:00:32,986 --> 01:00:33,736
No.

595
01:00:34,706 --> 01:00:36,936
I told you to sing for me now!

596
01:00:37,506 --> 01:00:40,703
I don't feel like it!

597
01:00:40,906 --> 01:00:44,899
You're a boring, joyless creature.
Start singing and you'll feel like it.

598
01:00:45,106 --> 01:00:48,860
I don't feel like singing that's all.
- You won't when you're dead.

599
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:52,502
But till you stop breathing,
you're going to sing for me.

600
01:00:53,546 --> 01:00:55,059
I told you to sing, damn it!

601
01:00:55,626 --> 01:00:56,536
Sing!

602
01:00:59,026 --> 01:01:00,618
Sing or bleed!

603
01:01:01,386 --> 01:01:04,025
Come on, sing, let's hear it. Sing!

604
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:09,615
Oh Love has brightly colored wings,

605
01:01:10,106 --> 01:01:15,134
A bird so fine is hard to seize.

606
01:01:17,386 --> 01:01:20,219
Keep going.

607
01:01:21,186 --> 01:01:24,144
Come on, let's hear it!

608
01:01:25,266 --> 01:01:28,542
Come on, let's have
a little more feeling, asshole.

609
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,142
Like the Negro bitches...

610
01:01:31,346 --> 01:01:33,018
With baskets on their heads...

611
01:01:33,226 --> 01:01:36,935
of bananas, oranges, pineapples...

612
01:01:37,266 --> 01:01:39,826
La Cucaracha...

613
01:01:41,986 --> 01:01:45,058
La Cucaracha...

614
01:01:47,546 --> 01:01:50,504
Come on, let's hear it.

615
01:01:51,986 --> 01:01:55,103
We want to hear La Cucaracha.

616
01:01:55,506 --> 01:01:56,575
Now!

617
01:01:58,706 --> 01:02:00,936
Or we'll smash your teeth in.

618
01:02:01,306 --> 01:02:05,857
Oh Love has brightly colored wings...

619
01:02:06,826 --> 01:02:10,785
Are you deaf? La Cucaracha!

620
01:02:17,586 --> 01:02:19,736
Man, are you lame.

621
01:02:46,146 --> 01:02:49,821
Bonjour l'amour...

622
01:02:53,466 --> 01:02:55,422
You're such a drag.

623
01:03:01,186 --> 01:03:04,144
Are you crazy, spitting in my face?

624
01:03:04,626 --> 01:03:07,777
You stinking toilet bowl,
you useless bitch!

625
01:03:10,306 --> 01:03:12,979
Come here, you need some mouthwash.

626
01:03:14,306 --> 01:03:17,423
Bon appetit, you bitch.

627
01:03:18,186 --> 01:03:21,417
We'll wash your hair while we're at it.

628
01:06:31,106 --> 01:06:32,334
The phone!

629
01:06:35,346 --> 01:06:36,301
Thanks.

630
01:06:41,106 --> 01:06:42,903
Wait, just a second.

631
01:06:44,426 --> 01:06:46,986
You look awful. Are you crying?

632
01:06:47,186 --> 01:06:49,859
No.
Can I get the phone first?

633
01:06:51,026 --> 01:06:52,300
My phone call?

634
01:06:52,506 --> 01:06:54,383
Can't you come down?

635
01:06:55,146 --> 01:06:58,775
Your room is a terrible mess.
It's a nightmare.

636
01:06:59,666 --> 01:07:01,463
I don't know what to do any more.

637
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:03,338
And you never eat a thing.

638
01:07:04,946 --> 01:07:06,425
But you'll hurry up, right?

639
01:07:06,626 --> 01:07:08,059
Okay?

640
01:07:15,106 --> 01:07:15,936
Yes?

641
01:09:17,826 --> 01:09:19,623
You look good today.

642
01:10:01,746 --> 01:10:04,499
How do you think I'm doing?
It's hot, I'm sweating,

643
01:10:04,706 --> 01:10:07,618
I spent the whole night
sitting in the car,

644
01:10:07,826 --> 01:10:09,498
and all for nothing.

645
01:10:10,586 --> 01:10:13,225
And just now I got a call from a client.

646
01:10:13,426 --> 01:10:15,781
The guy even threatened me!

647
01:10:15,986 --> 01:10:19,183
I gotta think of something.
I'm up against a wall here.

648
01:10:19,946 --> 01:10:22,301
How are the things at home?

649
01:10:22,506 --> 01:10:26,294
Did you check on the painters
the way I told you?

650
01:10:26,506 --> 01:10:29,179
No, come on.
Go down and check on them...

651
01:10:29,386 --> 01:10:30,899
or they'll just make a mess.

652
01:10:31,106 --> 01:10:33,666
And don't forget,
have a peppermint first.

653
01:10:33,866 --> 01:10:35,504
You're slurring your words again.

654
01:10:35,706 --> 01:10:39,301
You don't have to tell me,
I know what's going on.

655
01:10:51,746 --> 01:10:53,976
Can I listen to a tape, can I, huh?

656
01:10:54,186 --> 01:10:56,825
I have a real nice tape here.

657
01:11:00,386 --> 01:11:03,184
It's got my favorite song on it.

658
01:11:05,106 --> 01:11:07,097
It's on here, on this side right here.

659
01:11:07,306 --> 01:11:08,261
How does your one work?

660
01:11:08,466 --> 01:11:09,535
Let me see.

661
01:11:11,146 --> 01:11:12,340
Monja...

662
01:11:26,146 --> 01:11:27,056
It's not loud enough.

663
01:11:27,266 --> 01:11:29,655
Let's not argue about music.

664
01:11:29,866 --> 01:11:32,175
I'll let you play this and that's it.

665
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:40,862
I don't know
why I keep giving you rides.

666
01:11:41,066 --> 01:11:42,818
I really don't understand it...

667
01:11:43,026 --> 01:11:44,539
You can't hear the words.

668
01:11:44,746 --> 01:11:47,579
Monja...

669
01:12:05,626 --> 01:12:07,378
He stuck his tongue out at me.

670
01:12:18,346 --> 01:12:20,098
All my thoughts,

671
01:12:26,546 --> 01:12:28,582
my whole life too...

672
01:12:29,626 --> 01:12:31,218
I give to you...

673
01:12:33,746 --> 01:12:35,577
because I love you.

674
01:12:36,866 --> 01:12:38,265
Just you,

675
01:12:39,746 --> 01:12:40,895
Monja.

676
01:12:48,106 --> 01:12:50,495
Do you know
the most popular sex positions?

677
01:12:50,706 --> 01:12:51,980
Missionary 44%,

678
01:12:52,186 --> 01:12:54,620
Woman on top 33%, Doggie-style 30%,

679
01:12:54,826 --> 01:12:56,942
On your side 25%, Sitting 11%,

680
01:12:57,146 --> 01:12:59,785
Standing 11%, no, it's 8%.

681
01:13:28,146 --> 01:13:30,660
The sauce didn't have much flavor.

682
01:13:30,866 --> 01:13:33,744
With roast pork the sauce
has to be nice and tasty.

683
01:13:33,946 --> 01:13:36,016
Not too greasy, but flavorful.

684
01:13:40,706 --> 01:13:42,344
So it wasn't enough...?

685
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:45,538
No, it's not that.
I can't chew the crust.

686
01:13:58,586 --> 01:14:00,975
It's got a slip too, be careful.

687
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:03,142
Yes, I see it. They all have one.

688
01:14:04,906 --> 01:14:08,216
She was particular,
didn't want it to be see-through.

689
01:14:09,186 --> 01:14:10,096
A modest one, huh?

690
01:14:10,306 --> 01:14:12,342
Yes, she was plenty modest.

691
01:14:12,666 --> 01:14:14,657
But she didn't hide anything.

692
01:14:16,306 --> 01:14:19,218
That one's pretty, it looks very nice.

693
01:14:19,786 --> 01:14:21,583
A cute little dress.

694
01:14:21,826 --> 01:14:23,179
Yes.

695
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:27,338
Let me see how it fits.
- Aren't you rushing things a bit?

696
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:29,662
Well, I have to check and see, right?

697
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:31,015
We see with our eyes.

698
01:14:31,226 --> 01:14:33,501
You have to feel to know if it fits.

699
01:14:33,706 --> 01:14:36,504
So you like it?
- I'd say it fits.

700
01:14:37,426 --> 01:14:38,700
It looks nice.

701
01:14:38,906 --> 01:14:39,975
I like it too.

702
01:14:43,626 --> 01:14:47,460
Try the one that used to be
my wife's favorite dress.

703
01:14:47,666 --> 01:14:49,782
Which one?

704
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:52,705
This one?

705
01:14:55,906 --> 01:14:57,259
Cold. Cold.

706
01:15:00,106 --> 01:15:01,141
Cold.

707
01:15:15,666 --> 01:15:17,099
Very cold.

708
01:15:17,826 --> 01:15:19,623
Getting warmer.

709
01:15:20,906 --> 01:15:21,975
Cold.

710
01:15:22,186 --> 01:15:23,221
What now, cold or warm?

711
01:15:23,426 --> 01:15:25,223
Cold.

712
01:15:25,986 --> 01:15:27,101
Cold.

713
01:15:30,866 --> 01:15:32,185
Ice cold.

714
01:15:35,186 --> 01:15:36,938
Getting lukewarm now.

715
01:15:39,266 --> 01:15:40,858
You hid it quite well.

716
01:15:41,786 --> 01:15:43,014
Lukewarm.

717
01:15:43,226 --> 01:15:44,625
Getting warmer?

718
01:15:45,186 --> 01:15:46,938
Getting even warmer.

719
01:15:47,146 --> 01:15:48,898
Then I'm on the right track.

720
01:15:49,466 --> 01:15:50,740
Yes, you are.

721
01:15:55,786 --> 01:15:57,060
Lukewarm.

722
01:15:57,826 --> 01:15:59,339
Getting warmer.

723
01:16:00,226 --> 01:16:01,898
Even warmer.

724
01:16:02,626 --> 01:16:04,184
Now it's getting hot.

725
01:16:04,506 --> 01:16:06,497
Now it's very hot.

726
01:16:09,626 --> 01:16:11,378
Oh, I've got it.

727
01:16:12,586 --> 01:16:13,939
I've got it!

728
01:16:15,586 --> 01:16:17,702
Well, I have something to celebrate.

729
01:16:19,146 --> 01:16:24,015
Today would have been our
50th anniversary for my wife and me.

730
01:16:25,026 --> 01:16:26,175
That's why I told you...

731
01:16:26,386 --> 01:16:29,776
to put on my late wife's dress...

732
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:32,625
and show me you deserve it.

733
01:16:33,146 --> 01:16:35,899
Do you at least like me in it?

734
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,067
Hi, is Wickerl here?

735
01:17:54,268 --> 01:17:54,905
No.

736
01:17:55,108 --> 01:17:56,985
Can I come in for a minute, please?

737
01:17:57,628 --> 01:18:00,859
I forgot my key last night.
I can't get in the apartment.

738
01:18:08,028 --> 01:18:11,543
I just wanted to say that
I'm awfully sorry about yesterday.

739
01:18:11,788 --> 01:18:13,506
I won't make a big apology out of it.

740
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:16,142
I can't undo what happened, but...

741
01:18:18,508 --> 01:18:21,944
It just happened,
but I'm not this way normally, really.

742
01:18:25,068 --> 01:18:27,536
I want... This may sound stupid,

743
01:18:27,748 --> 01:18:30,308
and I don't want
to sound cynical either, but...

744
01:18:34,188 --> 01:18:37,624
there hasn't been a woman
in the last 3 years...

745
01:18:39,228 --> 01:18:42,345
that I had so many feelings
for as for you yesterday.

746
01:18:43,828 --> 01:18:47,946
Even if it was the wrong kind,
or too heavy, or whatever...

747
01:18:49,428 --> 01:18:52,340
But I also enjoyed it some of the time,

748
01:18:53,868 --> 01:18:55,460
I have to admit.

749
01:18:55,828 --> 01:18:58,342
That was heavy. Nothing like this...

750
01:18:58,548 --> 01:19:01,221
ever happened to me before, you know.

751
01:19:03,268 --> 01:19:05,702
And somehow I liked it in a way...

752
01:19:06,148 --> 01:19:09,618
to see how some people...

753
01:19:10,948 --> 01:19:12,939
can act toward other people.

754
01:19:16,588 --> 01:19:18,579
That's why I...

755
01:19:20,148 --> 01:19:23,379
encouraged him at times.
Yes, I egged him on.

756
01:19:24,908 --> 01:19:27,900
Anyway, now I'm really sorry.

757
01:19:30,908 --> 01:19:33,741
As I said,
because of the sins of all women,

758
01:19:35,308 --> 01:19:38,425
you probably had to take
a lot of shit yesterday.

759
01:19:43,188 --> 01:19:45,782
I was never very lucky with the girls.

760
01:19:49,668 --> 01:19:51,340
It was always painful.

761
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:56,056
At first it hurts when you fall in love,

762
01:19:57,108 --> 01:20:00,305
then it hurts
when you fall out of love again,

763
01:20:00,508 --> 01:20:03,784
and you don't know where you stand...

764
01:20:03,988 --> 01:20:07,105
or whether she likes you
or if you like her.

765
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:10,306
Then it hurts when you break up,

766
01:20:10,508 --> 01:20:15,946
and then afterwards you realize
you really liked her a lot after all...

767
01:20:20,028 --> 01:20:21,461
Love sucks.

768
01:20:22,628 --> 01:20:26,223
Every woman I ever had just hurt me,
every single one.

769
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:29,707
The last one managed
to make me hate... all women.

770
01:20:39,228 --> 01:20:42,220
She's got my son locked up
like a hostage, you know?

771
01:20:45,988 --> 01:20:48,456
He's defenseless,
and she's hurting him...

772
01:20:48,668 --> 01:20:50,021
just like she hurt me.

773
01:20:50,788 --> 01:20:52,699
She doesn't understand that.

774
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:56,105
I'm not even allowed to see him.

775
01:20:56,308 --> 01:20:58,503
Last time I saw him was 2 years ago.

776
01:20:59,868 --> 01:21:03,099
I'd really like to be there for him and...

777
01:21:04,028 --> 01:21:06,019
I would teach him things and...

778
01:21:09,868 --> 01:21:12,428
She's hurting him like she hurt me.

779
01:21:13,148 --> 01:21:15,104
He can't defend himself...

780
01:21:35,468 --> 01:21:38,426
I'm sorry I'm burdening you with all this.

781
01:21:42,428 --> 01:21:45,943
But what I wanted to say is just
that I'm sorry about yesterday.

782
01:21:49,908 --> 01:21:51,626
No, I don't want that.

783
01:21:52,788 --> 01:21:54,016
No, please...

784
01:21:56,868 --> 01:21:58,426
No, I don't want that.

785
01:22:15,788 --> 01:22:18,097
Wickerl doesn't have to know.

786
01:22:18,348 --> 01:22:20,578
No, no. Don't you tell him anything.

787
01:22:23,668 --> 01:22:24,987
I won't say anything.

788
01:22:25,188 --> 01:22:27,304
No, don't, I don't want that.

789
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:31,461
Please stop it.

790
01:22:45,148 --> 01:22:47,298
Do you want me to stab him?

791
01:22:47,828 --> 01:22:49,546
If you want, I'll kill him.

792
01:22:57,908 --> 01:22:59,057
I'm not kidding.

793
01:22:59,268 --> 01:23:02,340
Just give me the word
and I'll get rid of him,

794
01:23:03,748 --> 01:23:05,739
then he won't bother you any more.

795
01:23:39,628 --> 01:23:40,902
My towel.

796
01:23:42,388 --> 01:23:43,537
Her towel.

797
01:24:20,188 --> 01:24:21,223
Come on.

798
01:24:21,548 --> 01:24:22,663
Get up.

799
01:24:23,388 --> 01:24:24,343
Get up.

800
01:24:25,388 --> 01:24:27,822
Get up!

801
01:24:30,028 --> 01:24:32,303
Go to the refrigerator.

802
01:24:32,828 --> 01:24:34,739
You already know where it is, hm?

803
01:24:35,068 --> 01:24:37,901
The refrigerator with my beer.
There it is.

804
01:24:38,188 --> 01:24:39,382
Open it.

805
01:24:40,068 --> 01:24:41,740
Open the refrigerator.

806
01:24:41,948 --> 01:24:43,779
Now take a beer.

807
01:24:44,428 --> 01:24:45,622
Take a beer!

808
01:24:47,788 --> 01:24:49,346
Close the refrigerator.

809
01:24:49,788 --> 01:24:52,302
Very good. Now open the beer.

810
01:24:52,908 --> 01:24:54,227
Open it.

811
01:24:57,108 --> 01:24:58,336
Very good.

812
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:01,544
No, no, for you. Take a drink.

813
01:25:02,428 --> 01:25:03,861
Take a drink!

814
01:25:05,628 --> 01:25:07,380
Okay. Very good.

815
01:25:07,868 --> 01:25:09,620
Take another one out.

816
01:25:10,028 --> 01:25:11,507
Get one out for me.

817
01:25:14,268 --> 01:25:15,337
Open it.

818
01:25:23,628 --> 01:25:24,743
Thanks.

819
01:25:24,988 --> 01:25:26,137
Very good.

820
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:27,857
Cheers.

821
01:26:32,988 --> 01:26:34,467
I can't stay.

822
01:26:35,588 --> 01:26:38,580
My family is waiting,
my wife is waiting at home.

823
01:27:09,188 --> 01:27:11,144
OK, what was that all about?

824
01:27:13,028 --> 01:27:13,858
Huh?

825
01:27:15,388 --> 01:27:17,504
What's this shit you're pulling again?

826
01:27:18,228 --> 01:27:21,664
I thought we had cleared up
this shit last time.

827
01:27:21,868 --> 01:27:23,017
What is this?

828
01:27:23,428 --> 01:27:27,182
You spent an hour talking to that
blond asshole of an ex-boyfriend.

829
01:27:29,788 --> 01:27:31,301
Answer me!

830
01:27:33,388 --> 01:27:35,504
What's this shit again?
You think I'm stupid?

831
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:38,017
Listen, do you think I'm stupid?

832
01:27:42,628 --> 01:27:45,665
You made me watch you
with that idiot for an hour.

833
01:27:46,268 --> 01:27:49,101
Don't you hear what I'm saying?

834
01:27:51,668 --> 01:27:56,025
I really believed you weren't like
the rest of them, I really did.

835
01:27:56,228 --> 01:27:59,618
But you're just like
every other bitch I ever met.

836
01:27:59,908 --> 01:28:03,423
Every relationship, every woman
screwed me over from the start.

837
01:28:03,628 --> 01:28:05,186
I'm telling you: Every one.

838
01:28:05,388 --> 01:28:07,663
Do you hear me?
Every single one.

839
01:28:08,028 --> 01:28:10,019
Did you get that? Did you?

840
01:28:10,268 --> 01:28:12,099
I don't hear you.

841
01:28:14,668 --> 01:28:15,657
When I met you,

842
01:28:15,868 --> 01:28:18,826
I thought you were different
from the rest, special.

843
01:28:19,028 --> 01:28:23,180
But you're just like the rest of them.
Listen to me.

844
01:28:23,388 --> 01:28:25,982
You're just like all the other bitches.

845
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:30,260
Only shit, only bitches,
that's all I ever got.

846
01:28:30,468 --> 01:28:33,858
Each relationship was nothing but shit.

847
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:36,221
Every single one.

848
01:28:37,708 --> 01:28:39,266
Can you imagine that?

849
01:28:39,908 --> 01:28:40,624
Yeah?

850
01:28:40,828 --> 01:28:42,784
I just don't know how to...

851
01:28:43,108 --> 01:28:44,427
You have no idea.

852
01:28:44,628 --> 01:28:45,947
No idea at all.

853
01:28:46,668 --> 01:28:48,818
You want to hear my story?

854
01:28:49,068 --> 01:28:50,217
Shall I tell you my story?

855
01:28:50,428 --> 01:28:53,101
What it's like to keep falling
on your nose?

856
01:28:54,988 --> 01:28:57,343
The last one, Anita, was just great,

857
01:28:57,548 --> 01:28:58,822
cheated on me left and right...

858
01:28:59,028 --> 01:29:03,419
She let every asshole
with a dick go at her.

859
01:29:03,628 --> 01:29:06,984
Or the next one, Doris,
she was just like you.

860
01:29:07,228 --> 01:29:10,823
She thought she could do
what she wanted, was always late...

861
01:29:11,028 --> 01:29:14,225
You kept me waiting there like a fool.

862
01:29:15,548 --> 01:29:18,585
You, Miss Lower Austria,
show up 10 minutes late.

863
01:29:18,788 --> 01:29:22,463
Please explain that to me instead
of just sitting there.

864
01:29:22,668 --> 01:29:25,580
I'm starting to think you don't care.

865
01:29:25,788 --> 01:29:27,267
Don't you care?

866
01:29:27,508 --> 01:29:28,418
What?

867
01:29:31,628 --> 01:29:33,061
What's wrong with you?

868
01:29:33,268 --> 01:29:34,417
You want to go home?

869
01:29:50,548 --> 01:29:52,027
What's wrong with you?

870
01:29:54,228 --> 01:29:55,138
Get out!

871
01:29:55,428 --> 01:29:56,338
Come here!

872
01:29:58,868 --> 01:29:59,903
Get out!

873
01:30:01,708 --> 01:30:03,300
What's wrong with you?

874
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:08,423
What do you think
I'm going to do to you?

875
01:30:09,468 --> 01:30:12,301
What do you expect me to do with you?

876
01:30:12,628 --> 01:30:14,858
What do you think
I'm going to do to you?

877
01:30:16,748 --> 01:30:19,182
Enough. Get lost! Get lost!

878
01:30:19,428 --> 01:30:21,942
Fuck off! Just fuck off! Right now.

879
01:30:22,828 --> 01:30:25,740
You're a fucking asshole...

880
01:30:46,388 --> 01:30:47,707
Can I have a ride?

881
01:30:54,708 --> 01:30:56,266
Ah, the crazy girl.

882
01:31:07,748 --> 01:31:09,704
Can I have a ride again, can I?

883
01:31:09,908 --> 01:31:10,704
Yes, get in.

884
01:31:14,468 --> 01:31:16,299
Are you going to throw me out again?

885
01:31:16,508 --> 01:31:18,658
Wait, I need to concentrate.

886
01:31:18,868 --> 01:31:21,336
You won't kick me out again?

887
01:31:21,548 --> 01:31:23,379
No, no, we're going for a ride.

888
01:31:25,308 --> 01:31:27,185
It's hot in here. Real hot.

889
01:31:27,388 --> 01:31:28,741
Want to know how hot...

890
01:31:28,948 --> 01:31:30,142
Yes, tell me.

891
01:31:31,268 --> 01:31:34,863
Jesus, she's got a thermometer.
- It's 34o C in here. 34o C.

892
01:32:11,148 --> 01:32:12,866
Don't you have doors at home?

893
01:32:13,068 --> 01:32:14,660
It's dirty down there.

894
01:32:14,868 --> 01:32:17,177
Is this your house?

895
01:32:17,428 --> 01:32:19,225
Did you build it? Is it yours?

896
01:32:19,428 --> 01:32:21,305
Do you own it?
- Come, let's have a look.

897
01:32:21,508 --> 01:32:24,784
Look how dirty it is here in front.

898
01:32:27,028 --> 01:32:28,302
Come on inside.

899
01:32:29,148 --> 01:32:30,467
Look. Come.

900
01:32:30,748 --> 01:32:33,308
A nice door you have here.

901
01:32:33,508 --> 01:32:34,861
Wait till you see this one.

902
01:32:35,068 --> 01:32:35,784
Come along.

903
01:32:35,988 --> 01:32:39,060
A great house you got here.

904
01:32:40,668 --> 01:32:44,661
You've got lots of naked women here.

905
01:32:45,228 --> 01:32:47,617
Do you know all these naked ladies,
do you?

906
01:32:47,828 --> 01:32:51,377
You got a new TV too. Is it a new TV?

907
01:32:51,588 --> 01:32:54,580
Do you know the
new Plasma television sets? 1. Philipps 42BF

908
01:32:57,428 --> 01:32:59,384
2. Grundig Planatron 2,

909
01:32:59,588 --> 01:33:01,260
3. Panasonic TC,

910
01:33:01,548 --> 01:33:04,267
4. Sony PF...
A nice kitchen you've got here too.

911
01:33:04,468 --> 01:33:07,665
Come with me.

912
01:33:07,868 --> 01:33:09,221
Come, I'll show you something.

913
01:33:09,428 --> 01:33:10,986
Do you have ice in there?

914
01:33:11,748 --> 01:33:12,817
Come with me.

915
01:33:13,108 --> 01:33:15,702
What's down there, is it the basement?

916
01:33:16,908 --> 01:33:18,546
I'll show you, come on.

917
01:33:18,788 --> 01:33:21,541
A big basement, there's lots of room.

918
01:33:21,948 --> 01:33:24,667
What's this you have in here?

919
01:33:24,868 --> 01:33:26,665
You have a bed in here.

920
01:33:27,068 --> 01:33:28,706
You have a bed in here.

921
01:33:29,868 --> 01:33:33,417
Is this the bedroom?

922
01:33:33,628 --> 01:33:35,858
And the wardrobes?
- We don't need any.

923
01:33:36,068 --> 01:33:38,263
Didn't you buy any?

924
01:33:38,468 --> 01:33:40,538
Come here. Look how soft.

925
01:33:40,748 --> 01:33:42,340
Yeah, it sure is a great bed.

926
01:33:42,628 --> 01:33:45,984
Lie down. You can rest a while.

927
01:33:47,668 --> 01:33:48,737
Expensive?

928
01:33:48,948 --> 01:33:50,745
Did it cost a lot, the bed?

929
01:33:51,108 --> 01:33:52,621
Did you pay a lot?

930
01:34:11,348 --> 01:34:12,576
She's in there.

931
01:34:16,988 --> 01:34:20,185
What? It was you?

932
01:34:21,628 --> 01:34:24,938
You're the monster
who goes around ruining cars?

933
01:34:25,148 --> 01:34:28,857
Listen when I'm talking to you!

934
01:34:29,068 --> 01:34:31,502
Why did you ruin my car? Why?

935
01:34:32,548 --> 01:34:35,142
Look, I'm doing the talking, you idiot!

936
01:34:35,348 --> 01:34:37,498
You belong in the psychiatric ward!

937
01:34:37,708 --> 01:34:39,107
Why did you ruin my car?

938
01:35:08,908 --> 01:35:10,580
Can you hear me, Mr. Schiel?

939
01:35:10,948 --> 01:35:12,381
Hello, this is Hruby.

940
01:35:12,908 --> 01:35:14,580
Don't get all hysterical,

941
01:35:14,788 --> 01:35:16,107
just wait a second.

942
01:35:17,188 --> 01:35:20,783
Like I promised, I have the guilty one.

943
01:35:35,868 --> 01:35:37,267
I'm here, what's going on?

944
01:35:37,468 --> 01:35:38,537
Come on in.

945
01:35:51,988 --> 01:35:54,548
So you're the slut who ruined my car.

946
01:35:55,228 --> 01:35:57,696
Not quite right in the head, you moron?

947
01:35:59,748 --> 01:36:02,057
You'll see what you get for that.

948
01:36:14,388 --> 01:36:17,937
Why are you taking your pants off?
I don't like it when you're naked!

949
01:36:18,148 --> 01:36:19,979
Put them back on!

950
01:38:24,588 --> 01:38:26,306
Let's talk to each other.

951
01:38:29,548 --> 01:38:30,424
Hey.

952
01:38:36,188 --> 01:38:37,462
Talk to me.

953
01:38:40,228 --> 01:38:41,820
Let me talk to you!

954
01:38:42,308 --> 01:38:43,423
Hey, you!

955
01:38:43,868 --> 01:38:47,986
Speak to me for once, damn it!

956
01:40:40,748 --> 01:40:43,421
Hail Mary, full of grace
The Lord is with thee

957
01:40:43,628 --> 01:40:45,300
Blessed art thou amongst women,

958
01:40:45,508 --> 01:40:48,306
And blessed
Is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

959
01:40:48,508 --> 01:40:51,580
Holy Mary, Mother of God
Pray for us sinners now

960
01:40:51,788 --> 01:40:54,382
And at the hour of our death, Amen.

961
01:40:54,708 --> 01:40:56,699
Hail Mary, full of grace...

962
01:43:35,428 --> 01:43:36,986
Well done.

963
01:43:37,748 --> 01:43:40,421
Well done, just like in the Orient.

964
01:44:07,068 --> 01:44:08,467
Is Wickerl here?

965
01:44:09,908 --> 01:44:11,182
What do you want?

966
01:44:12,188 --> 01:44:13,223
Is he here?

967
01:44:24,988 --> 01:44:26,103
What's wrong?

968
01:44:27,108 --> 01:44:28,302
What's up?

969
01:44:32,108 --> 01:44:33,336
Nothing new.

970
01:44:38,388 --> 01:44:39,298
And?

971
01:44:40,188 --> 01:44:41,940
Have you apologized yet?

972
01:44:42,828 --> 01:44:44,420
Apologize for what?

973
01:44:49,548 --> 01:44:50,822
For everything.

974
01:44:51,668 --> 01:44:53,386
Lucky, put that away.

975
01:44:53,588 --> 01:44:55,863
Time for some serious apologizing.

976
01:44:56,508 --> 01:44:58,624
I want to hear a big apology.

977
01:44:59,908 --> 01:45:00,863
Put that away!

978
01:45:01,068 --> 01:45:02,865
It's payback time.

979
01:45:04,668 --> 01:45:06,226
Where did you get the gun?

980
01:45:06,428 --> 01:45:08,737
Tell him to apologize to you.

981
01:45:09,388 --> 01:45:11,424
Tell him to apologize for all...

982
01:45:11,628 --> 01:45:13,937
he's done to you in the last 2 years.

983
01:45:16,548 --> 01:45:18,345
Tell him now!

984
01:45:25,988 --> 01:45:28,980
Apologize for all...

985
01:45:29,548 --> 01:45:31,618
you've done to me in the last 2 years.

986
01:45:33,348 --> 01:45:35,020
Okay, I apologize...

987
01:45:35,228 --> 01:45:37,696
for all I've done to you
in the last 2 years.

988
01:45:38,468 --> 01:45:40,140
Was that so hard?

989
01:45:42,468 --> 01:45:43,867
Do you feel better at least?

990
01:45:44,068 --> 01:45:46,707
Calm down now and sit down.

991
01:45:46,988 --> 01:45:50,663
Now tell him to get down on his knees.

992
01:45:50,868 --> 01:45:51,983
We can talk about it.

993
01:45:52,188 --> 01:45:55,703
Who do you think I'm doing this for?!

994
01:45:58,268 --> 01:46:00,543
Lucky, put down the gun.

995
01:46:00,908 --> 01:46:03,342
Tell him I'll blow his brains out,

996
01:46:03,548 --> 01:46:06,062
I swear I will. I'll blow him away.

997
01:46:09,188 --> 01:46:11,782
Tell him to get down on his knees!

998
01:46:14,708 --> 01:46:18,257
Come on, be sensible, Lucky.
What good is all this?

999
01:46:19,108 --> 01:46:21,019
Calm down, come sit down.

1000
01:46:23,308 --> 01:46:26,459
Do you want stains on your sofa?

1001
01:46:27,748 --> 01:46:30,023
Tell him to kneel down.

1002
01:46:32,868 --> 01:46:34,221
Not like that, damn it!

1003
01:46:34,428 --> 01:46:37,420
Say: Get down on your knees
and sing La Cucaracha!

1004
01:46:43,548 --> 01:46:46,267
Get down on your knees
and sing La Cucaracha.

1005
01:46:51,908 --> 01:46:52,943
Well?

1006
01:46:54,348 --> 01:46:55,576
Tell him now.

1007
01:46:56,348 --> 01:47:00,102
Tell him he's a dirty bastard
and he has to sing La Cucaracha.

1008
01:47:01,868 --> 01:47:02,983
Say it!

1009
01:47:03,548 --> 01:47:06,381
Say: Sing La Cucaracha,
you bastard, you.

1010
01:47:10,468 --> 01:47:11,901
Come on, say it!

1011
01:47:13,508 --> 01:47:16,500
Sing La Cucaracha, you bastard, you.

1012
01:47:19,188 --> 01:47:20,416
No good. Say it again:

1013
01:47:20,628 --> 01:47:23,142
Sing La Cucaracha, you bastard you.

1014
01:47:23,748 --> 01:47:24,976
Say it again,

1015
01:47:27,068 --> 01:47:28,660
but really mean it!

1016
01:47:29,828 --> 01:47:32,581
Sing La Cucaracha, you bastard you.

1017
01:47:34,108 --> 01:47:36,178
Sing La Cucaracha, you bastard you!

1018
01:47:36,948 --> 01:47:38,779
That's what I said.

1019
01:47:38,988 --> 01:47:41,582
Tell him: Sing La Cucaracha!

1020
01:47:43,588 --> 01:47:45,624
Sing La Cucaracha.

1021
01:47:45,828 --> 01:47:47,659
I'll blow you away in a minute!

1022
01:47:50,148 --> 01:47:52,787
Sing La Cucaracha, you bastard!

1023
01:47:54,868 --> 01:47:55,823
Well?

1024
01:47:56,388 --> 01:47:57,867
Didn't you hear?

1025
01:47:58,548 --> 01:48:00,266
Of course I heard.

1026
01:48:15,148 --> 01:48:17,423
Tell him to play the guitar too.

1027
01:48:18,428 --> 01:48:19,497
I can't play the guitar.

1028
01:48:19,708 --> 01:48:21,300
Play the guitar too.

1029
01:48:37,028 --> 01:48:38,939
Now tell him he did a good job.

1030
01:48:40,188 --> 01:48:43,260
Say: Good little piggy,
you sang nicely.

1031
01:48:43,468 --> 01:48:45,698
Run your fingers through his hair.

1032
01:48:56,868 --> 01:48:59,063
Good little piggy, you sang nicely.

1033
01:48:59,268 --> 01:49:00,986
Now slap him in the face.

1034
01:49:04,228 --> 01:49:05,547
Slap him in the face.

1035
01:49:06,668 --> 01:49:08,420
And say: Naughty bear.

1036
01:49:10,188 --> 01:49:11,257
Naughty bear.

1037
01:49:11,468 --> 01:49:12,218
Again.

1038
01:49:15,388 --> 01:49:16,503
Naughty bear.

1039
01:49:16,708 --> 01:49:17,538
Again.

1040
01:49:19,388 --> 01:49:20,901
Naughty bear!

1041
01:49:21,428 --> 01:49:24,340
You don't need to hit so hard,
you'll hurt him.

1042
01:49:24,588 --> 01:49:27,227
A few more slaps:
Naughty bear, naughty bear, naughty bear.

1043
01:49:32,828 --> 01:49:34,466
Bad piggy.

1044
01:49:34,868 --> 01:49:35,903
And slap him.

1045
01:49:36,108 --> 01:49:37,336
Naughty piggy.

1046
01:49:39,228 --> 01:49:41,025
Bad, bad Wicky.

1047
01:49:41,508 --> 01:49:43,066
Bad, bad Wicky.

1048
01:49:45,028 --> 01:49:48,259
Bad, bad Wicky,
you have a limpy dicky.

1049
01:49:51,748 --> 01:49:53,625
Bad, bad Wicky.

1050
01:49:54,828 --> 01:49:56,739
You have a limpy dicky.

1051
01:49:57,068 --> 01:49:58,945
You have a limpy dicky!

1052
01:50:00,468 --> 01:50:02,220
Bad, bad Wicky,

1053
01:50:02,428 --> 01:50:03,781
you have a limpy dicky.

1054
01:50:04,108 --> 01:50:06,258
Bad, bad Wicky,

1055
01:50:06,468 --> 01:50:07,867
you have a limpy dicky!

1056
01:50:08,548 --> 01:50:10,504
Slap his face at the same time!

1057
01:50:15,828 --> 01:50:17,341
That was pretty good.

1058
01:50:17,708 --> 01:50:18,902
Not bad.

1059
01:50:20,788 --> 01:50:22,460
Now make him turn around.

1060
01:50:23,148 --> 01:50:26,663
Make him kneel on the chair
and pull down his pants.

1061
01:50:27,428 --> 01:50:30,545
Kneel on the chair
and pull down your pants.

1062
01:50:31,068 --> 01:50:32,501
Tell him to do it!

1063
01:50:33,748 --> 01:50:35,625
Pull down your pants and...

1064
01:50:37,068 --> 01:50:38,626
kneel on the chair.

1065
01:50:42,548 --> 01:50:43,822
You'll pay for this.

1066
01:50:44,028 --> 01:50:47,065
I'll blow your brains
all over this apartment, I swear.

1067
01:50:50,548 --> 01:50:52,300
Does that feel good, huh?

1068
01:50:54,508 --> 01:50:57,420
Happy birthday into your new life.

1069
01:50:58,868 --> 01:51:00,938
From now on you fight back.

1070
01:51:01,588 --> 01:51:04,148
If anyone does anything to you,
you fight back.

1071
01:51:04,708 --> 01:51:06,460
Happy birthday.

1072
01:51:07,348 --> 01:51:08,940
And now tell him...

1073
01:51:09,668 --> 01:51:11,465
to sing La Cucaracha.

1074
01:51:11,668 --> 01:51:13,863
No, make him sing the national anthem.

1075
01:51:20,068 --> 01:51:22,024
Please sing the national anthem.

1076
01:51:22,748 --> 01:51:24,784
I don't remember the words.

1077
01:51:24,988 --> 01:51:28,298
Land of mountains,
Land on the river...

1078
01:51:28,508 --> 01:51:29,827
Bloody Patriot.

1079
01:51:30,548 --> 01:51:31,583
Come on, sing!

1080
01:51:31,788 --> 01:51:33,107
Tell him to sing!

1081
01:51:33,308 --> 01:51:34,218
Wickerl, sing!

1082
01:51:34,668 --> 01:51:38,820
Land of mountains,
Land on the river,

1083
01:51:39,028 --> 01:51:41,178
Land of fields,
Land of cathedrals,

1084
01:51:41,548 --> 01:51:42,776
Not you!

1085
01:51:46,788 --> 01:51:48,904
Land of hammers,
with a future bright.

1086
01:51:51,228 --> 01:51:54,300
Land of hammers,
with a future bright.

1087
01:51:54,508 --> 01:51:56,578
Native home of many great sons...

1088
01:51:59,108 --> 01:52:02,987
Native home
of many great sons

1089
01:52:03,348 --> 01:52:05,498
A people with a gift for beauty...

1090
01:52:05,868 --> 01:52:10,419
A people with a gift for beauty

1091
01:52:11,468 --> 01:52:14,221
Oh, famed...

1092
01:52:14,428 --> 01:52:15,986
Austria.

1093
01:52:17,828 --> 01:52:22,299
Oh, famed Austria.

1094
01:52:24,828 --> 01:52:26,056
Good job.

1095
01:52:50,268 --> 01:52:51,496
Girlie!

1096
01:52:52,348 --> 01:52:53,417
Girlie!

1097
01:53:02,468 --> 01:53:04,379
Girlie, what's the matter?

1098
01:53:15,508 --> 01:53:19,137
What's wrong with my Girlie?

1099
01:53:19,748 --> 01:53:21,386
What is it, Girlie?

1100
01:53:25,468 --> 01:53:26,821
Is something wrong?

1101
01:53:27,148 --> 01:53:30,936
They must have poisoned her.
Take the flashlight so I can see.

1102
01:53:46,708 --> 01:53:48,778
This old dog is heavy.

1103
01:54:03,228 --> 01:54:05,025
Can you manage?

1104
01:54:05,828 --> 01:54:06,977
Heavy, huh?

1105
01:54:20,308 --> 01:54:22,378
Put out the cigarette on his hand.

1106
01:54:23,428 --> 01:54:24,827
Are you crazy?

1107
01:54:25,468 --> 01:54:27,220
You keep your mouth shut.

1108
01:54:27,428 --> 01:54:28,304
He's sick.

1109
01:54:29,868 --> 01:54:31,301
Come on, do it.

1110
01:54:31,748 --> 01:54:33,340
Don't make me angry.

1111
01:54:35,508 --> 01:54:37,305
Seriously, don't make me angry.

1112
01:54:42,148 --> 01:54:44,537
Put it out on his hand.

1113
01:54:45,828 --> 01:54:46,943
Go on!

1114
01:54:50,828 --> 01:54:53,467
Want me to blow him away,
you really want that?

1115
01:55:03,668 --> 01:55:04,942
That feel good?

1116
01:55:08,948 --> 01:55:11,178
Harder. Grind it in there real good!

1117
01:55:11,388 --> 01:55:12,616
I did!

1118
01:55:15,628 --> 01:55:16,856
Another one.

1119
01:55:17,468 --> 01:55:18,787
Do it again.

1120
01:55:21,308 --> 01:55:23,060
Good? Does that feel good?

1121
01:55:23,268 --> 01:55:24,906
Is that good, huh?

1122
01:55:31,548 --> 01:55:33,061
That's how it works.

1123
01:55:34,028 --> 01:55:35,541
I love you so much.

1124
01:55:35,948 --> 01:55:37,825
Please forgive me.

1125
01:55:40,188 --> 01:55:42,861
What do you mean you love him so?

1126
01:55:43,268 --> 01:55:44,986
I love you so much!

1127
01:55:47,068 --> 01:55:49,423
Why the hell am I doing this?

1128
01:55:53,228 --> 01:55:54,707
Why did I come back here?

1129
01:55:54,908 --> 01:55:57,945
Why am I even helping you?

1130
01:56:04,828 --> 01:56:06,546
You're the perfect couple.

1131
01:56:10,668 --> 01:56:13,057
Tell me, lady, why do I come back...

1132
01:56:13,268 --> 01:56:14,781
and try to help you?

1133
01:56:20,788 --> 01:56:22,858
Do you really love him?

1134
01:56:24,828 --> 01:56:25,897
Tell me!

1135
01:56:29,388 --> 01:56:31,140
You love... him?

1136
01:56:33,548 --> 01:56:34,503
Yes.

1137
01:56:45,668 --> 01:56:48,466
He forced me to.

1138
01:56:51,988 --> 01:56:54,900
I love you so much. I'm so sorry.

1139
01:56:57,428 --> 01:56:58,827
I love you.

1140
01:57:01,268 --> 01:57:02,462
Oh God!

1141
01:57:45,028 --> 01:57:47,861
