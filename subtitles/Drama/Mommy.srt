1
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,278
In a fictional Canada,
a new government comes into power

2
00:00:53,403 --> 00:00:55,532
during the federal elections of 2015.

3
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:02,547
Two months later, its cabinet
introduces the 8-18 bill,

4
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:06,510
aiming to amend
the Canadian health services policy.

5
00:01:08,754 --> 00:01:11,758
More specifically,
the highly controversial S-14 Bill

6
00:01:11,882 --> 00:01:15,056
stipulates that the parent of
a child with behaviour problems has,

7
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:18,682
in a situation of financial distress,
physical andlor psychological danger,

8
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:21,855
the moral and legal right
to put his children

9
00:01:21,976 --> 00:01:25,731
in the care of any public hospital,
without due process of law.

10
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:31,199
This is the story
of Diane "Die" Despres,

11
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,620
a woman whose fate appears
to be intimately tied to this affair.

12
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:01,742
You fuck!

13
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:07,661
You cocksucker!

14
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,252
Yeah?

15
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,803
Love the pool.

16
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:24,050
Sorry, Mrs. Despres.

17
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:26,386
We should've asked you
to bring your bikini.

18
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:28,681
You a stand-up or something?

19
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:30,604
You sign Steve's eviction fonn

20
00:04:30,724 --> 00:04:31,691
and you're both free.

21
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:35,150
Free from what!
Are we gonna talk about this?

22
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:40,193
Do you speak French'?

23
00:04:40,318 --> 00:04:43,538
Just as good
as they do in France, yeah.

24
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,830
Al 12h15, your son
was in the cafeteria

25
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:51,752
with four other residents,

26
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:54,501
when a fire broke out.

27
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:58,172
Little Kevin Julien was rushed
to the hospital,

28
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:01,096
burned to the second,
if not third degree.

29
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:04,686
Want me to draw you a picture too'?

30
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,484
Are those your kids?
They/re cute.

31
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:22,915
Your initials below mine,
and sign the second-to-last page.

32
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:55,404
So what do we do now?

33
00:05:57,027 --> 00:05:58,620
There's no "we".

34
00:05:59,863 --> 00:06:02,117
You know what I mean.
Not you and me.

35
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:03,834
Me and my son.
I'm not stupid.

36
00:06:04,827 --> 00:06:06,454
We gave Steve a chance.

37
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:08,088
If you can't take him back,

38
00:06:08,414 --> 00:06:10,041
we'll send him
to our security department.

39
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,088
Excuse me'?

40
00:06:12,043 --> 00:06:14,968
Don't act surprised!
Come on!

41
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:18,013
Your son has
a one-way ticket to jail.

42
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:20,144
Are you insane'?

43
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,855
My boy ain't going to jail.
I know the drill.

44
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:25,647
Once they're in,
they're done for.

45
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:27,144
His educator says

46
00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:29,942
his positive attitude made progress.

47
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:32,524
He keeps telling me
he's doing better.

48
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:36,029
This is a detention centre.

49
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:42,123
The kids do better...

50
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:44,246
Until they don't.

51
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,091
Have you given thought
to little Kevin Julien,

52
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,210
scarred for life?

53
00:06:50,335 --> 00:06:52,133
Little Kevin, little Kevin...

54
00:06:52,254 --> 00:06:55,179
We gonna canonize the kid'?
Shit him a statue?

55
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:58,769
Tough luck! Next time, don't stick
yourface in the microwave!

56
00:07:05,644 --> 00:07:08,067
- Jacqueline to Jacques.
- I'm listening.

57
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:09,857
We're on our way.

58
00:07:11,817 --> 00:07:12,693
Roger.

59
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:20,209
Listen...

60
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,832
Diane...

61
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:26,467
I've seen tons of kids
in and out of here.

62
00:07:28,085 --> 00:07:29,758
We save some,

63
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,052
we lose some,
and that's the way of it.

64
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:34,346
We tried helping Steve,

65
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:36,219
as well as specialized schools,

66
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:37,721
residential centres.

67
00:07:37,846 --> 00:07:39,519
Our centre tried helping him.

68
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:41,434
Your tum.

69
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,030
And what am I gonna do
with him all daylong?

70
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:48,445
I can't drag him to work.
I got a job.

71
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:51,285
I can't dump everything
and go party with my kid.

72
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:52,745
L'm broke.

73
00:07:53,613 --> 00:07:56,287
I'm this close to welfare
and welfare's a fucking no.

74
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:57,158
When he turns 16,

75
00:07:57,784 --> 00:08:00,709
he'll be eligible
for youth detention.

76
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:03,127
I ain't gonna send my son
to a jail for lil' punks

77
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:07,003
waiting to be big punks!
They/ll fuck him up.

78
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,467
Did you...

79
00:08:12,884 --> 00:08:15,228
consider the S-14 law'?

80
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:20,188
The new law.

81
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,104
Forget about it.

82
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:23,980
As a last resort.

83
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:25,607
L'll never do that to my son!

84
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:37,123
Don't consider him or yourself
invincible.

85
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:40,168
That's the worst thing you oould do.

86
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,885
Loving people doesn'l save them.

87
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:46,634
Love has no say.

88
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:48,635
Unfortunately.

89
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:53,804
Skeptics...

90
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:55,848
will be proven wrong.

91
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:00,110
Good luck, Ma'am.

92
00:09:03,314 --> 00:09:06,909
Jacqueline, it's Jacques.
We brought little Despres

93
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:09,324
to the isolation room
because he was out of control.

94
00:09:09,737 --> 00:09:11,239
Fucking son of a cunt!

95
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:14,035
Don't ya touch me, bitch!
I dare ya, fucking homo!

96
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,791
- I said calm down!
- Fucking suck-ass, ya flaming twat!

97
00:09:19,331 --> 00:09:21,129
Suck my dick, dipshit!

98
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,172
Roger.

99
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:28,058
At least you fixed his bad language.

100
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:29,518
You're stunning, babe!

101
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:31,602
Every time, you're beautifuler!

102
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,314
You look younger, too, lhafs dope!

103
00:09:33,431 --> 00:09:35,149
What's effln dope
is you staning a fire.

104
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:37,018
That's real dope, boy!

105
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,736
Fire's up my ass,
gotta let it out.

106
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:43,320
Get your head out too,
once you're at it.

107
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:44,614
Didn't ya miss me'?

108
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,204
I always think of ya, Mom!
You're always in my head!

109
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,322
Your heads up your ass!

110
00:09:48,447 --> 00:09:50,495
Must be pretty dark in there.

111
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:53,369
Dark as a black dude's ass
but I still see ya!

112
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,916
Where the fuck's our ride!

113
00:09:55,038 --> 00:09:57,006
Ride's gone.
We'll take the bus.

114
00:09:58,374 --> 00:09:59,842
You're playing, right'? LOL.

115
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:02,754
LOL alright,
d'ya see the blood here?

116
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,005
Who's the motherfucker?

117
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:07,556
Some dumbass on Poirier Street.

118
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:09,269
The car's an effin wreck.

119
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:10,888
Can we sell the parts online?

120
00:10:11,013 --> 00:10:13,687
Fuck no.
Jeez, that foot hurts like a bitch!

121
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:14,558
Gimme that.

122
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:18,905
I couldn't stand
them fucking freaks anymore!

123
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:20,148
Can I bum one?

124
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:22,192
I smoke. here!

125
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:23,819
Well, time to quit!

126
00:10:23,944 --> 00:10:25,571
L'm quitting too. On my birthday.

127
00:10:26,822 --> 00:10:29,416
You listen to me, Stevo!
Listen up!

128
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:31,502
We gotta set some ground rules!

129
00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:33,417
You wanna live with Mom'?
Stay outta trouble?

130
00:10:33,537 --> 00:10:35,164
You gotta help.

131
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:37,258
That starts with mutual respect, bud.

132
00:10:37,376 --> 00:10:40,255
I don't wanna hear no more fuck yous,
am I clear?

133
00:10:42,256 --> 00:10:43,553
You deaf or what'?

134
00:10:44,132 --> 00:10:46,726
- Where do we live now?
- St-Hubert, next to the 116.

135
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:47,811
Sexy.

136
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:49,438
I got my own room'?

137
00:10:50,598 --> 00:10:53,067
I still got enough dough
for that, dimwit.

138
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:54,777
I ain't gonna spoon at 40.

139
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:56,316
- You're 46!
- Shut up!

140
00:10:56,437 --> 00:10:58,111
Don't look at the deco, eh!

141
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:01,156
Tenant before, some old lady,
she died two months ago.

142
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:03,245
There's so much tapestry in there

143
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,363
we could start a shop.

144
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,495
- I hate that ugly shit!
- I feel ya!

145
00:11:07,658 --> 00:11:09,161
You can get the last toke.

146
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:21,549
You didn't even kiss me!

147
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:22,846
First thing I did.

148
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:23,934
I don't think so.

149
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:26,513
You little shit.

150
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,013
Come on, come on!

151
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:31,063
You little shit!

152
00:11:31,184 --> 00:11:32,686
You're just like your father!

153
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:52,632
Well, well!

154
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:54,088
How is she?

155
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,304
Same old! Hanging in there!

156
00:11:57,963 --> 00:11:59,089
Don't tell me that's your kid'?

157
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:00,557
You betcha!

158
00:12:00,674 --> 00:12:02,803
Just back from boarding school.

159
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:04,554
- Paul.
- Steve.

160
00:12:05,764 --> 00:12:09,519
Great social skills, eh! So proud!

161
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:12,192
Why don't you guys
come watch some TV?

162
00:12:12,313 --> 00:12:15,408
I'll fix some pine-nut pesto pasta
real quick!

163
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:17,117
I dunno,

164
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:18,156
some other time maybe,

165
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:20,826
we're just gonna settle in
real smooth, ya know.

166
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:22,540
Alright. Rain check, then'?

167
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:28,876
We gotta work
on that shit attitude, hon.

168
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:30,544
L'll fix some pasta..."

169
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:32,508
Shut up!

170
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,925
- Yo, who's that homo!
- A neighbour.

171
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,600
Bitch, please!
He's obviousingly hitting on ya.

172
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,220
"Obviousingly."
That ain't in the dictionary.

173
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:43,433
We there?

174
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,984
Not so five-stary, eh...

175
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,070
ls that in the dictionary'?

176
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,609
This plane's perfect, trust me.

177
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,323
There's a big yard.
Big yard, big life.

178
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,784
Two bathrooms, right'?

179
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:56,153
Sure!
Waterbeds and jacuzzis, too!

180
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:57,324
Where's my room'?

181
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:58,867
Down there!

182
00:13:43,203 --> 00:13:45,831
Hey, Radio City Hall!

183
00:13:50,587 --> 00:13:53,682
Two radios at once!
Thanks but no thanks!

184
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,767
What'?

185
00:13:57,552 --> 00:14:00,272
Shut her trap, wiil ya!

186
00:14:01,098 --> 00:14:05,148
We got both of them playin,
it's a goddamn racket!

187
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:12,202
Mom, I can't find my shit
in that mess.

188
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,866
Where are dad's pics?

189
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:19,289
Why d'you need that now'?

190
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:22,463
They're...

191
00:14:24,832 --> 00:14:28,257
They're in the bedroom!
I'm swimming in boxes, I dunno!

192
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:18,732
No way...

193
00:15:20,893 --> 00:15:21,940
Crazy bitch...

194
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,948
Fucking A!

195
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,328
That's your last warning!

196
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:15,044
That's another thing,
repeating myself again and again!

197
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:16,459
That ain't in our contract!

198
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,674
We gotta catch the 10h45 bus!
Otherwise we fall on AM shifts

199
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,793
and we'll hit lunch traffic.

200
00:16:22,252 --> 00:16:23,219
Come on, get up.

201
00:16:23,337 --> 00:16:24,338
Fuck, man!

202
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:25,681
Nice motel whiff, here...

203
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,763
You're supposed
to knock before, fuck!

204
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:29,886
You can be such a dumbass!

205
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:30,887
Watch your mouth!
I knocked!

206
00:16:31,262 --> 00:16:33,981
Did not!
You just came in, fuck!

207
00:16:34,474 --> 00:16:37,103
24 hours you've been here
and this place is a slum!

208
00:16:37,227 --> 00:16:38,444
Tidy up!

209
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:40,280
Can I jerk off in peace, before!

210
00:16:40,397 --> 00:16:41,899
Gimme your undies.

211
00:16:42,024 --> 00:16:44,277
The bunched-up tissues,
not so guest-friendly.

212
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:46,324
So get yourjizz together

213
00:16:46,445 --> 00:16:47,493
and we'll be in business.

214
00:16:47,614 --> 00:16:49,287
Gonna hold my dick when I piss too'?

215
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,909
If it helps you aim!

216
00:18:57,255 --> 00:18:58,222
Mommy?

217
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:16,444
What's the matter, sweetie?

218
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:18,703
That we did win..."

219
00:19:18,821 --> 00:19:21,449
- Win what?
- The games?

220
00:19:22,032 --> 00:19:25,913
Plural form.
- So you put?

221
00:19:26,037 --> 00:19:28,460
An S.
- Very good.

222
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:43,431
$299. 51, please.

223
00:19:44,473 --> 00:19:45,565
Come again?

224
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:46,981
It's $300.

225
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:54,150
And what's this?

226
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,195
A work of an'?

227
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,289
If it was 300 bucks
I wouldn't have rushed

228
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,408
all the way here
to frolic in car jams!

229
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,537
Ma, I gotta get those pens!
They're fucking dope!

230
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,880
It's our Fall issue, come on, now!

231
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:09,377
Oh really? So a schoolbook's price's
got a season now?

232
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,465
Why of course, dear!

233
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,306
"Why of course, dear, why of course!"

234
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:16,221
How can I be so dumb!

235
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:19,221
I bet it's written in pink
on every bitch's ass!

236
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:22,724
Madam, our sales are valid
during the back to school period.

237
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:24,396
Afterwards--
- I haven't got a choice...

238
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:26,064
Smells like fucking strawberries!

239
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:28,153
I'm writing shit
and it smells like strawberries!

240
00:20:28,271 --> 00:20:31,321
You don't need it, Stevie!
Stop moving things around!

241
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:32,409
Try this one.

242
00:20:32,985 --> 00:20:35,363
Mom, wail up!
There's all this shit, too!

243
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:36,534
I don't think so.

244
00:20:36,655 --> 00:20:37,622
But I need it!

245
00:20:38,407 --> 00:20:40,160
I'm home-schooling you,
not opening a stickers shop!

246
00:20:40,285 --> 00:20:40,956
Mom!

247
00:20:41,494 --> 00:20:43,167
Come on!
I'll be late for work.

248
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:44,380
Bitch...

249
00:20:44,998 --> 00:20:47,501
You shouldn't talk to your mother
that way, young man.

250
00:20:48,752 --> 00:20:51,882
D'ya dip your bangs
in some gingefs ass or something?

251
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:53,883
I don't buy cars online!

252
00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:56,602
I ain't gonna spend my life
at a mechanic's!

253
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:59,518
You just gotta check your shit,
lowball the shit out of it!

254
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:01,108
Look I know the market.

255
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:03,192
You watch your suspensions, you--

256
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,688
The market! Sure!
And l'm Marilyn Monroe!

257
00:21:05,812 --> 00:21:08,406
Well beats being the metro's bitch

258
00:21:08,523 --> 00:21:10,525
and spending mad cash on cab rides!

259
00:21:10,651 --> 00:21:13,906
Steve, lemme manage the budget
and focus on your beat-off schedule.

260
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,749
Yo, respect me, girl!
Treat me like an adult!

261
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:19,164
Mutual respect! Remember?

262
00:21:19,285 --> 00:21:22,665
Yo sir, can you cut the bongos,
it fucking sucks ass!

263
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,418
Let the driver listen to his bongos!
We're almost there.

264
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:26,589
Where the fuck are we!

265
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,962
Sir. I said don't take that street,

266
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,930
we'll get caught up in construction!

267
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:31,765
You never said that.
You say that earlier!

268
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:35,933
You kidding, right?
I said, "Don't take Ste-H?l?ne."

269
00:21:36,054 --> 00:21:37,146
That's as clear as it gets!

270
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,981
And you still did, like a boss!

271
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,772
Watch your mouth, boy!

272
00:21:40,892 --> 00:21:42,360
Sir. make a U-turn.

273
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:43,570
I can't, my friend.

274
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:46,148
- We're not your friends!
- Will you shut up, Steve!

275
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:47,490
Sir, it ain't my problem.

276
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:48,780
I told you DON'T go there.

277
00:21:48,901 --> 00:21:50,574
It's like all you want is to boost--

278
00:21:50,695 --> 00:21:53,164
What! You accuse me?
Telling me I'm trying to rip you off?

279
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,952
Chill out!

280
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:55,367
Look, you tell me I rip you off,

281
00:21:55,492 --> 00:21:57,620
you tell me I'm a crook,
with your son!

282
00:21:57,744 --> 00:21:59,291
You yell at me!
- Fuck off, Mamadou!

283
00:21:59,413 --> 00:22:00,209
Steve!

284
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,291
What! Get outta my car! Now! Out!

285
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,761
You idiots!
- Why don't ya shut your mouth!

286
00:22:04,877 --> 00:22:06,299
Imbeciles!

287
00:22:06,421 --> 00:22:08,423
Piece of shit!
Damn savages!

288
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:12,177
That's quite a start, Stevo!
You gonna be my good luck charm.

289
00:22:12,301 --> 00:22:13,223
I could call the cops!

290
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:15,439
L'mma call them loo, dawg!

291
00:22:15,556 --> 00:22:16,808
I'll smash your face, little fucker!

292
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:18,650
Teach your son some manners!
Bitch!

293
00:22:19,643 --> 00:22:21,896
- Whafd you call my mom'?
- Back off!

294
00:22:24,106 --> 00:22:26,826
What d'you just call my mom,
you big monkey!

295
00:22:27,235 --> 00:22:29,237
I ain't got time for pigs today!

296
00:22:29,362 --> 00:22:31,660
Motherfucking nigger!

297
00:22:32,365 --> 00:22:34,083
- Stop it!
- You shut your mouth, bitch!

298
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,169
Fucking ratface!
Get out and fight me!

299
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:38,881
Ratface! Nigger!
I think he got your point!

300
00:22:38,998 --> 00:22:41,126
G0 back to yourjungle
mixing coconut drinks!

301
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,752
Not in my country!

302
00:22:42,877 --> 00:22:44,345
Stop being so racist!

303
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:46,761
I'm not being racist!
He's a nigger!

304
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:48,099
Sit your ass down.

305
00:22:48,216 --> 00:22:49,593
Hi, Diane. Unfortunately--

306
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,106
Excuse me, Gilles, I'm so sorry.

307
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,732
Forty minutes...

308
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,118
Yes, Diane.
I'm so happy to see you.

309
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:08,496
Mr. Gravel's on sick leave.

310
00:23:09,073 --> 00:23:11,622
I know, it's disappointing.
But by all means, sit down.

311
00:23:11,742 --> 00:23:14,040
What favour did you want
to ask my husband?

312
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:17,256
I'm all ears
and I cannot wait to help you.

313
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:43,076
Y0, girl!

314
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:46,163
D'you want me to show ya
some sweet chill-out technique?

315
00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:51,460
I'd like to hear Gilles' opinion.

316
00:23:52,453 --> 00:23:54,296
I'm afraid I don't, doll.

317
00:23:55,331 --> 00:23:56,878
Don't call me doll.

318
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,846
Gilles' gone, he can't
run the place and l'm in charge now.

319
00:24:00,963 --> 00:24:03,762
Sure he'd have been very moved
by your channs,

320
00:24:03,882 --> 00:24:05,134
but the decision's mine.

321
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:10,223
You can't do this.

322
00:24:10,347 --> 00:24:12,271
The hell, I can.
You're not permanent.

323
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:14,736
You'll be compensated.
100% legal.

324
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:17,481
So no more Dear Abby'?

325
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:20,567
Yeah, only a real journalist
will write it.

326
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:27,120
I'm talented; Gilles said so.

327
00:24:27,241 --> 00:24:28,413
He said I had great timing.

328
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:33,253
I'm sure he loved the timing
of your tits in his face!

329
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:37,173
But for me, your talent here
is to make photocopies

330
00:24:37,294 --> 00:24:39,012
and serve coffee four days a week.

331
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:41,973
So if you got your son full time
and can't show up anymore,

332
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,389
pack your shit
and sayonara, bitch!

333
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:49,523
What are you doing in my bag'?
Drop it.

334
00:24:49,932 --> 00:24:51,149
That's my stuff...

335
00:24:54,104 --> 00:24:57,950
It ain't ourfirst ride,
Diane, is it?

336
00:24:59,276 --> 00:25:00,243
Look at me.

337
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:03,740
We gonna be a team.
The two of us!

338
00:25:05,116 --> 00:25:06,459
I'm gonna control myself

339
00:25:06,576 --> 00:25:08,123
and I'll take care of you...

340
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:09,291
l'mma protect you.

341
00:25:09,746 --> 00:25:12,420
Number one priority, school, ok'?

342
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,417
I was your age when I dropped out.

343
00:25:14,543 --> 00:25:16,637
And look at me now,
I'm a wreck!

344
00:25:16,754 --> 00:25:19,303
No diploma, no education, nada!
A fucking loser!

345
00:25:26,264 --> 00:25:27,311
What would Dad say'?

346
00:25:27,807 --> 00:25:28,899
What he'd say'?

347
00:25:29,017 --> 00:25:30,940
- I dunno.
- You know it.

348
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:31,937
You know it, come on!

349
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,482
Grab the future by the balls...

350
00:25:38,611 --> 00:25:40,579
- Fuck the past, in the ass.
- What?

351
00:25:41,155 --> 00:25:42,202
Fuck the past, in the ass.

352
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:46,962
Yeah! It's fucking brilliant, eh!

353
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:48,706
Alright, what's the damage...

354
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,003
You're fine.

355
00:25:50,123 --> 00:25:51,466
I dunno 'bout fine!

356
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:54,386
- You look great, promise.
- I look like a panda.

357
00:25:54,795 --> 00:25:57,219
Got shit running down my face.
Fucking hell!

358
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:04,681
I always did that back at the Centre.

359
00:26:04,806 --> 00:26:08,607
Whenever I'd spazz
I'd hop in a bitching cold shower!

360
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,528
Ma, you listening to me'?

361
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,328
What the hell...

362
00:26:54,444 --> 00:27:00,042
Your translator bailed last minute.
So I ended up translating...

363
00:27:01,577 --> 00:27:03,204
that kids' book, it was real cute...

364
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:05,707
for a small collection...
Do you remember?

365
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:10,632
That's it!
Exactly, yes, that's right.

366
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:16,143
Yeah, so I've been thinking,
what if...

367
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,102
A girl's gotta ask, right...

368
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,930
if you had another...

369
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:24,067
little contract like that for me.

370
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,980
I mean, Marthe,
I know I don't have the r?sum?

371
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,857
or the skills to translate some...

372
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,277
Z-foot thick Ken Follett!

373
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,073
I know! Ken Follett!

374
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,289
Yeah, as if! So huge!
lt's too much for me.

375
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:42,664
But you know, some kids thingy...

376
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:46,464
I'm thinking, "Grab the Oxford
and Bob's your uncle."

377
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:48,218
It's not...

378
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:56,224
Just as a hobby". time killer...

379
00:27:57,054 --> 00:27:58,556
to kill some time.

380
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:13,246
Of course I understand, Marthe.

381
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,917
No! It's no big deal, of course!

382
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:20,963
Things have been great.

383
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,927
Steve's just moved back in.
We're staning...

384
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:28,172
One chapter ends, another begins,
as they say.

385
00:30:57,501 --> 00:30:59,378
L'm back, baby!

386
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,093
Where you been?

387
00:31:04,217 --> 00:31:05,844
I'm waiting like a fool
to home-school ya!

388
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:07,346
Save it for tomorrow!

389
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,972
L'm still catching up.

390
00:31:09,097 --> 00:31:10,440
'The hell's that crown?

391
00:31:10,557 --> 00:31:11,558
It's my new cap!

392
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:16,110
And what's all this'?

393
00:31:20,651 --> 00:31:21,994
Damn it...

394
00:31:24,906 --> 00:31:27,910
What's that can, for God's sake!

395
00:31:28,035 --> 00:31:28,957
It's a cart!

396
00:31:29,661 --> 00:31:31,629
No shit, but why the fuck is it
in my driveway

397
00:31:31,747 --> 00:31:34,876
and why are you loading
my fridge with that stuff!

398
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,175
Look at all the shitzels I got ya!
l'mma pimp this crib,

399
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,218
Don't change the subject!

400
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:40,386
It's goddamn food!

401
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:42,766
I ain't gonna shove it under my bed!
But wait up!

402
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,851
Told ya I'd take care of ya.

403
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:57,530
You stupid motherfucking
dumbass idiot!

404
00:31:57,651 --> 00:32:00,029
How much did it cost?
- It ain't your business.

405
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:01,575
The fuck it is

406
00:32:01,696 --> 00:32:03,698
when the pigs show up
'cause my son's a thief!

407
00:32:04,491 --> 00:32:05,834
I didn't steal it,
it's a gift.

408
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:06,872
That's real sweet

409
00:32:07,495 --> 00:32:09,714
but that doesn't mean
you didn'! steal it.

410
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,922
Where d'ya steal that stuff'?

411
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:12,507
I didn't steal it!

412
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:17,221
You tell me where you stole it all
and we're gonna bring it~

413
00:32:17,338 --> 00:32:20,764
I didn't steal it!
Are you fucking deaf, hoe?

414
00:32:20,884 --> 00:32:22,136
I didn't steal it!

415
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,262
I ain't gonna repeat it,
stupid bitch!

416
00:32:25,472 --> 00:32:27,315
Calm down, don't throw a fit.

417
00:32:27,432 --> 00:32:30,061
Mommy isn't mad,
but we'll bring everything back--

418
00:32:30,186 --> 00:32:32,188
It's yours!

419
00:32:32,313 --> 00:32:34,407
We're not bringing back anything!

420
00:32:34,524 --> 00:32:37,744
It's yours!
Don't touch any fucking thing!

421
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,990
Touch it, and I beat
the shit outta ya, you cunt!

422
00:32:42,241 --> 00:32:45,040
Steve, calm down, honey.
Calm down, honey.

423
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,915
Don't you fucking "honey" me
to make up for things!

424
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:52,336
Stop taking me for a fucking idiot!

425
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,632
' 90* you a gift!

426
00:32:56,673 --> 00:32:59,894
Steve... it's a beautiful gift.

427
00:33:00,302 --> 00:33:02,896
Mommy likes your gift,
Mommy's happy.

428
00:33:03,013 --> 00:33:04,185
But now...

429
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:08,486

430
00:33:09,228 --> 00:33:11,982
...and you're gonna take your pill--
- Give me that...

431
00:33:12,107 --> 00:33:13,029
Slop!

432
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,618
You gimme that shit

L'mma flush them meds

00:33:23,953 --> 00:33:25,500
The meds and your head, girl--

438
00:33:25,621 --> 00:33:27,214
Slop!

439
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,843
Mommy didn't wanna hurt you, baby.

440
00:33:33,964 --> 00:33:35,762
Mommy didn't mean wrong, okay'?

441
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:36,975
But Mommy...

442
00:33:37,634 --> 00:33:39,056
was choking.

443
00:33:39,178 --> 00:33:40,851
You were choking me, Steve.

444
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,567
Show me your head,

445
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:47,483
l'mma fix it and we gonna
calm down together.

446
00:33:48,688 --> 00:33:50,690
You attack me, you fucking snake'?

447
00:33:51,816 --> 00:33:55,697
Mommy didn't do it on purpose!
Mommy was scared, OK?

448
00:33:56,739 --> 00:33:59,538
You wanna low blow,
you fucking whore?

449
00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:01,911
You wanna fight me'?
Fine, me too.

450
00:34:02,036 --> 00:34:04,085
- Stop...
- 50-50!

451
00:34:04,206 --> 00:34:05,799
Wait till I get you!

452
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,133
Stop, stop!

453
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,627
Fight me you fucking wimp!

454
00:34:08,752 --> 00:34:09,844
Stop, Steve! Stop!

455
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:18,847
You fucking cut me, bitch!

456
00:34:18,971 --> 00:34:21,065
L'm fucking bleeding!

457
00:34:25,854 --> 00:34:27,276
You gotta calm down,

458
00:34:27,397 --> 00:34:29,650
othenuise Mommy can't help.

459
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:32,198
You're dangerous, you gotta chill,
you're in a state...

460
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,496
Take your pill, okay'?

461
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,908
I'm fucking dizzy!

462
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,254
Stop it, Steve, I swear...

463
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,707
You can't do this to me!

464
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:47,219
Mommy doesn't know what
to think anymore! I'm freaking out!

465
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:52,179
You gotta be calm if I come out!
I don't wanna fight anymore!

466
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:57,310
Answer me, I'm talking to you!

467
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,773
I'm going fucking nuts!

468
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:02,356
Answer me!

469
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:16,249
Steve, you there?

470
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:17,163
Fuck off!

471
00:35:34,554 --> 00:35:35,601
Are you alright?

472
00:35:39,476 --> 00:35:41,023
Feel dizzy'?

473
00:35:54,784 --> 00:35:56,161
We should...

474
00:35:57,704 --> 00:36:00,083
We should really
get him to a hospital.

475
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:02,217
No way, no hospital...

476
00:36:31,408 --> 00:36:34,958
Her ass smells like fucking roses.
It's written in the stars.

477
00:36:54,141 --> 00:36:55,108
Don't hurt him.

478
00:36:55,434 --> 00:36:57,061
- Don't try!
- Don't start!

479
00:37:02,692 --> 00:37:04,286
'The hell's that doobie'?

480
00:37:04,403 --> 00:37:06,656
They give you that in hospitals
to kill the pain.

481
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,501
Should we make your will'?
Gimme that! Give it!

482
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,092
You...

483
00:37:19,544 --> 00:37:20,670
I like you.

484
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:22,964
But you're hurting me.

485
00:37:23,756 --> 00:37:25,555
But I love it when it hurts.

486
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,354
Chill out, you're still my fave,
child-beater.

487
00:37:29,471 --> 00:37:30,597
Motherfuck!

488
00:37:30,723 --> 00:37:33,021
Take it easy, I'm just playing!

489
00:37:44,571 --> 00:37:45,915
What's your name'?

490
00:37:58,003 --> 00:37:59,050
Kyla.

491
00:37:59,796 --> 00:38:01,389
Two syllables, better off that way.

492
00:38:01,506 --> 00:38:02,428
L'm kidding.

493
00:38:02,966 --> 00:38:03,933
Want some coffee?

494
00:38:05,218 --> 00:38:06,470
Juice? No?

495
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,432
I got one of those kits too,

496
00:38:09,557 --> 00:38:11,935
somewhere in the boxes.
Didn't find it...

497
00:38:12,477 --> 00:38:15,276
I could've put some stitches
or whatever, but...

498
00:38:16,522 --> 00:38:17,991
Stupid kit.

499
00:38:18,484 --> 00:38:20,612
"If your child has trouble
with a subject,

500
00:38:20,736 --> 00:38:23,239
how can you take him
a step furthefl"

501
00:38:23,947 --> 00:38:25,369
As further away, please.

502
00:38:26,617 --> 00:38:29,747
A column matrix is a matrix
consisting of a single column...

503
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:31,647
Hello.

504
00:39:31,772 --> 00:39:32,819
Hello!

505
00:39:33,524 --> 00:39:35,492
Nice to meet you, Diane Despr?s,
from across the street.

506
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:38,237
- OK. Hello...
- Hello!

507
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:40,493
Is Kyla there?

508
00:39:40,614 --> 00:39:42,367
No... Yes...

509
00:39:42,492 --> 00:39:45,996
She's asleep.
You have a message for her?

510
00:39:46,121 --> 00:39:48,044
A message in a bottle, yep!

511
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,253
She dropped by this afternoon...

512
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,173
She was real nice.

513
00:39:55,298 --> 00:39:56,470
And I appreciate it.

514
00:39:57,675 --> 00:39:59,598
I wanted to give her this.

515
00:39:59,927 --> 00:40:01,349
What did she do'?

516
00:40:03,473 --> 00:40:04,440
Nothing...

517
00:40:04,808 --> 00:40:07,402
Nothing... I mean... Anyway...

518
00:40:10,564 --> 00:40:14,570
l've heard it's a good one...

519
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,076
Bye.

520
00:40:21,034 --> 00:40:24,835
If you got nothing tonight,
would you join us for a scoff?

521
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,796
This is fucking boring!

522
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:36,852
No more green veggies, 'ight,
you know I hate it.

523
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:39,221
You father wasn't tall,
your mom ain't any better...

524
00:40:39,346 --> 00:40:42,065
If you wanna go past 5'7",
veggies are your friends.

525
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:44,233
How are the onions'?

526
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,354
Brown. lsh.
I'm throwing in the veggies.

527
00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:47,651
That's right.

528
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:50,654
...at the General Hospital,
in an allegedly critical state.

529
00:40:50,775 --> 00:40:52,322
"A bloodcurdling death toll",

530
00:40:52,652 --> 00:40:55,405
says Maude Lajoie
from Montreal Police.

531
00:40:58,158 --> 00:41:00,707
Don't smoke there,
it'll taste like ashes!

532
00:41:01,078 --> 00:41:04,048
It'll suck the odour in,
just like bread!

533
00:41:04,456 --> 00:41:06,585
Gimme that, you dork!

534
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:08,253
Indeed, the campus is,

535
00:41:08,878 --> 00:41:10,630
to say the least,
bathed in fear and distress.

536
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:11,798
ls it Kyla?

537
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:15,643
...tmubled testimonies from
students who knew young Asselin.

538
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,017
Where's your man!

539
00:41:18,389 --> 00:41:19,515
The little neighbour was fun,

540
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,142
I just wanted to play with her.

541
00:41:21,267 --> 00:41:24,316
- We were still in Laval, then--
- It's my story!

542
00:41:24,436 --> 00:41:27,360
Hun, you gotta give context,
put some meat around the bone!

543
00:41:27,481 --> 00:41:28,859
We're in fucking Laval, jeez!

544
00:41:28,984 --> 00:41:30,952
People speak English in Laval, 'ight'?

545
00:41:34,531 --> 00:41:36,249
They speak English in Laval?

546
00:41:36,366 --> 00:41:37,663
More than you'd think.

547
00:41:37,784 --> 00:41:40,834
But I don't know a goddamn--

548
00:41:40,955 --> 00:41:43,174
Quit swearing! Goddamn, goddamn...

549
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:46,545
Not a fucking word of English.
But when Mom and Dad

550
00:41:46,669 --> 00:41:48,592
didn't want me to get
what they were saying,

551
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,761
they?! speak English.

552
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,557
It'd always end with,
"Shut up! Fuck off!"

553
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,679
So I'd tell Barbara
across the street,

554
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,728
Hey Barbara, come play with me!"

555
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,944
No wonder he played alone.

556
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,237
Great effin social skills!

557
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,781
He always liked to mingle.

558
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:12,949
D'you see that!

559
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:14,450
You Pig!

560
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:17,498
Mingle!

561
00:42:28,214 --> 00:42:29,682
Do you like it, Kyla'?

562
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:31,643
Is mingle in the dictionary'?

563
00:42:32,011 --> 00:42:33,308
Move on.

564
00:42:34,013 --> 00:42:35,390
Yes, thank you.

565
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:36,481
Besides...

566
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,106
Besides fixing my leg,

567
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,698
what do you do in life'?

568
00:42:48,153 --> 00:42:49,780
L'm on sabbatical.

569
00:42:50,197 --> 00:42:51,039
What the hell?

570
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:53,209
Means time off. A break.

571
00:42:53,326 --> 00:42:54,452
A break.

572
00:42:54,577 --> 00:42:55,954
From what?

573
00:43:04,713 --> 00:43:06,681
What do you do, your job'?

574
00:43:09,927 --> 00:43:10,928
Teacher.

575
00:43:11,303 --> 00:43:13,398
Yikes. Elementary, high school'?

576
00:43:14,432 --> 00:43:15,274
High school.

577
00:43:16,851 --> 00:43:19,980
Kids your age.
From grade 7 to grade 9.

578
00:43:20,939 --> 00:43:22,236
You're getting better!

579
00:43:22,357 --> 00:43:24,406
Making long sentences.

580
00:43:24,527 --> 00:43:25,528
Idiot!

581
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:26,654
What'?

582
00:43:32,201 --> 00:43:33,327
Tough one, eh'?

583
00:43:33,661 --> 00:43:36,916
I was always a bit shy, but...

584
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:43,718
I've had my language problem
for two years.

585
00:43:45,466 --> 00:43:47,514
Seven-year cycle apparently,

586
00:43:47,635 --> 00:43:49,433
it comes and goes...

587
00:43:49,804 --> 00:43:52,102
It'll stop.

588
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,858
I hope it doesn'l, it's sexy.

589
00:43:55,686 --> 00:43:57,188
What? It is!

590
00:43:58,313 --> 00:43:59,906
What about you, Steve?

591
00:44:00,816 --> 00:44:02,489
I noticed the skateboard.

592
00:44:03,068 --> 00:44:04,615
It's not a skate, it's a longboard.

593
00:44:05,446 --> 00:44:06,949
You know the diff... No'?

594
00:44:07,073 --> 00:44:09,201
The difference is that
the longboard--

595
00:44:09,325 --> 00:44:10,372
It's longer.

596
00:44:10,952 --> 00:44:12,829
Stay outta my story, jeez!
l'm a big boy, okay?

597
00:44:12,954 --> 00:44:14,206
I was talking to her.

598
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:17,380
You're less mobile.

599
00:44:17,501 --> 00:44:20,004
- But--
- Stop! I'm explaining!

600
00:44:20,921 --> 00:44:23,015
L'm due for seconds! You'?

601
00:44:24,425 --> 00:44:25,893
Another shot'?
- Last one...

602
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:35,111
Cheers.

603
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:37,443
Cheer.

604
00:44:38,483 --> 00:44:42,829
So you... moved in the 450,

605
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:45,164
you're on sabbatical...
What about your boyfriend?

606
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,662
Computer programming.

607
00:44:51,663 --> 00:44:53,461
Big nerd, eh'?

608
00:44:56,835 --> 00:44:58,837
Why did you leave Quebec City?

609
00:45:01,216 --> 00:45:02,809
Can I have one?

610
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,057
You smoke'?

611
00:45:05,178 --> 00:45:06,555
No, but...

612
00:45:08,431 --> 00:45:09,809
We're celebrating!

613
00:45:10,684 --> 00:45:12,482
Damn straight. Here.

614
00:45:12,603 --> 00:45:15,072
No holding back tonight.

615
00:45:15,189 --> 00:45:16,532
Be my effin' guest.

616
00:45:21,238 --> 00:45:25,334
It's my first night out
since we moved here.

617
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,967
We're on transit
between Quebec and...

618
00:45:34,085 --> 00:45:35,678
God knows where.

619
00:45:37,672 --> 00:45:40,425
It depends on Patrick's job.

620
00:45:42,135 --> 00:45:43,557
What about your job'?

621
00:45:49,935 --> 00:45:51,403
L\\

622
00:45:52,438 --> 00:45:55,408
I'm not ready to work
with kids again, yet.

623
00:46:00,989 --> 00:46:04,836
We're trying something new, too.

624
00:46:09,415 --> 00:46:10,792
Steve has...

625
00:46:12,501 --> 00:46:13,594
ADHD.

626
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,797
Disruptive, provoking...

627
00:46:16,756 --> 00:46:22,104
And apparently some...

628
00:46:23,305 --> 00:46:24,853
attachment disorder,

629
00:46:24,974 --> 00:46:26,897
or whatever ifs called.

630
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:30,984
He was okay when he was little.
We thought it was just...

631
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:36,237
Hyperactivity.

632
00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:40,119
But his dad died
three years ago...

633
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,743
D'y0u mind,
it reeks of smoke in here.

634
00:46:46,706 --> 00:46:48,253
The odor...

635
00:46:49,334 --> 00:46:51,587
Smells stale.

636
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,682
By the way, Steve...

637
00:47:02,514 --> 00:47:04,562
About this afternoon...

638
00:47:06,311 --> 00:47:08,313
Steve's violent. eh'?

639
00:47:09,564 --> 00:47:12,738
He's a sweet boy deep down,
loads of charisma...

640
00:47:13,818 --> 00:47:16,287
When he blows a fuse,
you best scram

641
00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:18,286
'cause it gets ugly.

642
00:47:20,409 --> 00:47:21,956
But I...

643
00:47:24,163 --> 00:47:26,257
...I don't touch my boy.

644
00:47:29,378 --> 00:47:30,595
I know that.

645
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,429
They quickly jump to conclusions
at the hospital.

646
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:37,678
I know the drill.

647
00:47:38,137 --> 00:47:40,014
Youth Protection, cops...

648
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:44,940
They'd florce him back
to George-Etienne Lemieux...

649
00:47:46,145 --> 00:47:48,569
But it ain't his place.
Right?

650
00:47:50,609 --> 00:47:52,611
You don't know him,
but you saw him.

651
00:47:54,947 --> 00:47:59,203
But I'm happy 'cause
it was tough being away from him.

652
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:03,172
He's all mine now.

653
00:48:04,374 --> 00:48:05,671
And he's quite a number.

654
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:08,215
You never get bored with Steve.

655
00:48:10,881 --> 00:48:14,226
Not a dull moment with Steve.

656
00:48:20,726 --> 00:48:22,478
There you have it.

657
00:48:22,602 --> 00:48:24,354
Fasten your seatbelt.

658
00:48:28,984 --> 00:48:30,201
Gawd help us all...

659
00:48:49,173 --> 00:48:50,220
You queen!

660
00:49:00,602 --> 00:49:03,152
That's from a mixtape his father
made a few years ago.

661
00:49:03,272 --> 00:49:04,524
All the songs

662
00:49:04,648 --> 00:49:06,400
from our road trip to Cali.

663
00:49:06,525 --> 00:49:09,074
We did the coast,
all the way down to L.A.

664
00:49:09,528 --> 00:49:10,996
He's got them on repeat.

665
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:15,369
Effin' hell'
Alright, cake time.

666
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,753
You smell like fucking heaven!

667
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,093
Eau Sauvage! Christian Dior.

668
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,259
My uncle gave me his leftovers.

669
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:29,259
And I still wear it. Love the smell.
You know it, Eau Sauvage?

670
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:31,428
Don't touch that, asshole!

671
00:49:41,438 --> 00:49:42,985
Whatcha doin'?

672
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:46,657
Drop that shit for a sec,
come dance with your son!

673
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:49,073
D'ya know the lyrics?

674
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,241
It's rather...

675
00:49:51,366 --> 00:49:52,458
...rather famous.

676
00:49:52,992 --> 00:49:55,872
Come on, sing!
She's our effin' national treasure!

677
00:50:14,182 --> 00:50:17,153
There's our Kyla!
Lettin' her gospel out!

678
00:50:18,229 --> 00:50:19,731
You good, hun!

679
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:55,677
Jesus H Christ...

680
00:51:57,003 --> 00:51:58,095
0h boy!

681
00:52:36,338 --> 00:52:38,557
Hey, Kyla! This a bad moment?

682
00:52:38,674 --> 00:52:39,971
I just wanted to»

683
00:52:40,092 --> 00:52:41,059
'§§

684
00:52:48,643 --> 00:52:52,364
I just wanted to tell you that...
yesterday was fun.

685
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,949
Yeah, yeah, it was.
What a blast.

686
00:52:55,484 --> 00:52:56,406
Listen...

687
00:52:57,403 --> 00:53:00,202
D'ya think you could do me...

688
00:53:00,322 --> 00:53:02,074
a teeny-weeny favour'?

689
00:54:06,812 --> 00:54:08,735
So, Die,

690
00:54:08,855 --> 00:54:12,201
I called Marty
right after you rang yesterday.

691
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:15,242
Ourjunior section translatofs
on leave with a couple gigs.

692
00:54:15,363 --> 00:54:17,115
One more, one less, he doesn't care!

693
00:54:17,824 --> 00:54:19,542
So timing-wise...

694
00:54:20,494 --> 00:54:21,711
You're dead on.

695
00:54:22,162 --> 00:54:24,164
Marthe, you're making my day.

696
00:54:24,289 --> 00:54:27,543
Well if it's a "hobby",
like you said...

697
00:54:27,668 --> 00:54:30,468
you were always
such a sweet neighbour!

698
00:54:30,588 --> 00:54:32,761
It's so nice to give back, isn't it!

699
00:54:34,926 --> 00:54:36,894
How's life treating you'?

700
00:54:37,011 --> 00:54:38,388
How's Steve?

701
00:54:41,142 --> 00:54:42,439
Yawn!

702
00:54:42,977 --> 00:54:44,979
This shit is useless!

703
00:54:45,104 --> 00:54:46,481
We had an agreement.

704
00:54:48,732 --> 00:54:51,155
Agreement my ass.
That was your idea.

705
00:54:51,277 --> 00:54:52,370
I don't give a shit!

706
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,077
The music...

707
00:54:55,198 --> 00:54:56,324
please turn it down.

708
00:55:01,746 --> 00:55:03,374
Where's the fucking O.J.

709
00:55:03,499 --> 00:55:05,342
In this motherfucking house!

710
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:09,965
We have ten minutes left
out of our thir...

711
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:12,008
Thirty!

712
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,933
Thirty! Say it, for fuck sake!
Hang in there; you can do it!

713
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,394
Steve... ten minutes!

714
00:55:19,183 --> 00:55:20,105
And then we dance.

715
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:24,522
Ten minutes.

716
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,238
And then we. we dance.

717
00:55:29,027 --> 00:55:30,244
Please calm down.

718
00:55:31,738 --> 00:55:34,117
Steve! Steve...

719
00:55:35,784 --> 00:55:37,001
No, Steve...

720
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:38,871
l'm not gonna take this!

721
00:55:40,873 --> 00:55:42,921
Come on, fight me, fucking pussy!

722
00:55:43,459 --> 00:55:45,713
Smack that face!

723
00:55:46,546 --> 00:55:48,594
I'm doing this to help, okay'?

724
00:55:51,843 --> 00:55:54,312
Cute gifly necklace...

725
00:55:57,308 --> 00:55:58,981
Get off me, bitch!

726
00:55:59,101 --> 00:56:01,069
Shut your mouth!

727
00:56:01,187 --> 00:56:03,531
Shut your fucking mouth!
Get your hands off me!

728
00:56:03,648 --> 00:56:06,744
And give me that necklace back
before I crush your skull!

729
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:09,909
You got it'? You got it now?!

730
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,492
That's what you want, eh'?

731
00:56:14,576 --> 00:56:17,501
You love it that way, right'?

732
00:56:33,472 --> 00:56:36,521
Do I bring up your dead father?

733
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,483
Do I fucking bring that up'?

734
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,151
So shut it tight,

735
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:49,124
sit your ass on the sofa,
and hold your fucking breath!

736
00:57:57,689 --> 00:57:58,941
Steve...

737
00:57:59,441 --> 00:58:01,193
Just go! I hale you!

738
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,473
Take your time, Diane.

739
00:58:22,174 --> 00:58:23,301
OK.

740
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:25,595
What?

741
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,096
It's nothing.

742
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,932
Come on, tell me.

743
00:58:29,057 --> 00:58:31,105
No, it's dumb, forget it.

744
00:58:31,226 --> 00:58:32,318
Come on, you tease!

745
00:58:32,435 --> 00:58:34,029
It's dumb...

746
00:58:34,146 --> 00:58:35,523
I'm not at the top of your list--

747
00:58:35,648 --> 00:58:36,991
Come on, you tease!

748

750
00:58:40,778 --> 00:58:42,030

Come on!

752
00:58:43,406 --> 00:58:45,409
It was a pleasure catching up.

00:58:45,534 --> 00:58:46,456
Tell me!

754
00:58:46,576 --> 00:58:48,328
You won't be disappointed.

00:58:48,453 --> 00:58:50,126
You gotta tell me right away.

00:58:52,707 --> 00:58:55,427
"Gee, what did she want?

758
00:58:55,545 --> 00:58:57,138

This isn't your day, eh'?

769
01:01:53,947 --> 01:01:59,000
You win some, you lose some,
that's life.

770
01:02:02,415 --> 01:02:03,507
How are you guys'?

There's always something going on
at the municipal court.

776
01:02:18,183 --> 01:02:20,231
You wouldn't believe the cases I get.

777
01:02:20,352 --> 01:02:21,274
I can imagine...

778

786
01:02:43,835 --> 01:02:45,382
Nah, nah, don't try!

01:04:16,812 --> 01:04:18,485
just to see your face!

798
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:22,360
We were done with math and chem

Forgive him.

803

Well, can I give a hand'?

804
01:04:38,628 --> 01:04:41,802
Table's set, food's sewed, Jesus!

805
01:04:41,923 --> 01:04:43,140
You can relax.

806

Relax, breathe!

01:05:29,642 --> 01:05:31,189
Versailles!

817
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:34,610
Those baloney rolls
are screaming my name!

818
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:37,117
You guys, let's take a pic!
Come on.

819
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:38,451
Lefs do it, guys.

820
01:05:39,736 --> 01:05:42,455
You come here. Come, Kyla.
- Wait...

821
01:05:43,323 --> 01:05:44,950
But my hair...

822
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:46,872
Your hair's sick.

823
01:05:46,994 --> 01:05:48,463
But that light's harsh, Stevo...

824
01:05:48,788 --> 01:05:50,756
Lel's switch sides, alright...

825
01:06:22,366 --> 01:06:24,209
We found out in March,

826
01:06:25,369 --> 01:06:26,916
End of March 2010.

827
01:06:30,417 --> 01:06:32,715
Three weeks later,
I was signing papers for his casket.

828
01:06:32,836 --> 01:06:33,712
Bingo!

829
01:06:34,963 --> 01:06:36,431
That was something.

830
01:06:37,257 --> 01:06:40,182
First off, we moved.

831
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,517
Left the burbs.

832
01:06:43,389 --> 01:06:45,938
Rich was up to his neck in debt.

833
01:06:46,059 --> 01:06:48,107
I sold the house,

834
01:06:48,227 --> 01:06:50,981
paid the bills,
set the counter straight.

835
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,284
And that's when Steve...

836
01:06:54,401 --> 01:06:57,746
Vandalism, petty theft,
the crying and cursing...

837
01:06:57,863 --> 01:06:59,740
All that bullshit.

838
01:07:01,785 --> 01:07:06,382
Then he got diagnosed
and I placed him.

839
01:07:06,498 --> 01:07:07,670
I mean, I placed him.

840
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:14,599
And what about you?
I did ask you before, didn't l?

841
01:07:15,299 --> 01:07:18,678
You used to live in Quebec City?
Why did y'all move here?

842
01:07:28,647 --> 01:07:29,899
I know Quebec, you know.

843
01:07:30,399 --> 01:07:33,495
We often went for Richard's job.
I always ended up there.

844
01:07:38,574 --> 01:07:40,417
What did Richard do'?

845
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:45,591
He worked in the inventors business.

846
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:49,170
He...
He invented...

847
01:07:49,294 --> 01:07:50,511
I never really got it but...

848
01:07:50,629 --> 01:07:51,846
I mean, I did but anyway...

849
01:07:51,964 --> 01:07:55,139
It was a microwave thingy...

850
01:07:57,053 --> 01:07:59,522
He named it the Heater-Waver.

851
01:08:01,099 --> 01:08:02,942
You know it'?

852
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:05,483
The Heater-waver, yes!

853
01:08:05,604 --> 01:08:08,483
Get outta here!
No effin way!

854
01:08:08,607 --> 01:08:10,359
It did good, yeah, it was a hit!

855
01:08:10,484 --> 01:08:13,283
Everyone had the Heater-Waver!
My sister, my sister-in-law!

856
01:08:13,404 --> 01:08:14,621
Really?

857
01:08:14,739 --> 01:08:15,787
Well, hello!

858
01:08:16,616 --> 01:08:19,790
We made a shitload of money
on that one, but it didn't last...

859
01:08:20,579 --> 01:08:23,298
Richie started thinking big,
next thing, I was thinking big...

860
01:08:23,415 --> 01:08:26,044
Of course... it was big!

861
01:08:26,169 --> 01:08:29,343
We all did, but better think big
than small, am I right or what?!

862
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:32,718
And then".
the Americans called.

863
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:35,812
- Americans are never far...
- They know best, don't they...

864
01:08:35,928 --> 01:08:37,306
When there's money to be made!

865
01:08:37,431 --> 01:08:40,935
So they got their hands on it...
and that's that.

866
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,403
Effin bunch of crooks!

867
01:08:44,104 --> 01:08:46,357
Yup.
Whafs done is done.

868
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,971
Are you looking for a job'?

869
01:09:09,341 --> 01:09:12,936
One of my friends gave me
some translation gig.

870
01:09:13,053 --> 01:09:15,431
Not really my job, but...

871
01:09:16,681 --> 01:09:19,606
at least I'll make it
to the holidays, now...

872
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:24,399
I mean, Christmas' right around
the comer. But then there's...

873
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:29,781
All that clutter in the basement.
The old furniture.

874
01:09:29,905 --> 01:09:32,124
I've got no room for that here.

875
01:09:32,741 --> 01:09:33,993
And it's from another life...

876
01:09:34,118 --> 01:09:35,711
it's got nothing
to do with me anymore.

877
01:09:37,454 --> 01:09:40,629
I was thinking I could...
you know... sell it.

878
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:45,130
Like a son of
garage sale type-a-thing...

879
01:09:46,214 --> 01:09:47,887
I don't know what ifs worth but...

880
01:09:49,676 --> 01:09:53,102
Must be worth something, at least.
Fancy dinner or some night out...

881
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:55,771
Makes a lil' bundle of dough...
Bundle here, bundle there...

882
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:57,234
We'll end up going somewhere!

883
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,237
That little wine's not bad, eh'?

884
01:10:03,275 --> 01:10:06,825
And you... is there anyone?
Anyone special, I mean?

885
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:09,997
L'm a jingle lady!

886
01:10:13,369 --> 01:10:14,962
Sorry.

887
01:10:15,079 --> 01:10:17,923
I meant single.

888
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,259
I'm surprised.
You're so pretty!

889
01:10:21,252 --> 01:10:22,379
You're pretty, Die.

890
01:10:22,504 --> 01:10:24,131
You're real sweet, but...

891
01:10:25,424 --> 01:10:28,803
Pretty won't getcha any!

892
01:10:29,636 --> 01:10:30,853
Life's like poker:

893
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:33,308
If you ain't got a good pair,
you're in deep shit!

894
01:10:45,446 --> 01:10:47,119
Time to flat call, lguess!

895
01:10:50,951 --> 01:10:52,953
No hooters, no poker!

896
01:10:53,078 --> 01:10:55,832
Might as well play with myself!

897
01:10:58,752 --> 01:11:00,846
Or watch some TV!

898
01:11:01,504 --> 01:11:05,226
I don't even have a TV!
No TV, no candy, sweet fuck all!

899
01:11:06,135 --> 01:11:08,354
No bazookas in my 34A!

900
01:11:08,471 --> 01:11:10,189
But a big one in my mouth!

901
01:11:13,434 --> 01:11:15,779
Tastes good!
They're my favourite!

902
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:18,448
That one was effin huge!

903
01:11:18,565 --> 01:11:21,068
Quite the mission!

904
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,618
I got cramps in my face!

905
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:27,534
L'mma help it down the drain!

906
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:35,834
Stop it, Die!

907
01:11:36,168 --> 01:11:37,260
Sorry!

908
01:11:37,962 --> 01:11:40,215
You're gonna kill me, Die!

909
01:11:41,757 --> 01:11:43,350
DO you get n?

910
01:12:18,715 --> 01:12:21,343
Holy fuck!
Should've seen your face!

911
01:12:21,467 --> 01:12:23,094
You scared me...

912
01:12:24,554 --> 01:12:26,602
It's just me,
Don't worry, babe.

913
01:12:29,893 --> 01:12:31,770
Don't call me babe.

914
01:12:31,895 --> 01:12:33,488
'Ight, I won't.

915
01:12:36,775 --> 01:12:37,822
It's okay.

916
01:12:40,947 --> 01:12:42,665
Are you done with
your history homework?

917
01:12:42,782 --> 01:12:44,375
I was just about to,

918
01:12:44,492 --> 01:12:47,416
but I can't see shit
'cause of the blackout.

919
01:12:50,374 --> 01:12:51,296
There.

920
01:13:05,182 --> 01:13:07,435
I'm a fucking pro, eh'?

921
01:13:08,894 --> 01:13:10,020
Mom?

922
01:13:10,896 --> 01:13:15,073
Dad wants to know where you put
the candles and flashlights.

923
01:13:22,534 --> 01:13:25,879
They're in a box in the basement.
He knows where!

924
01:13:27,081 --> 01:13:28,333
Thank you.

925
01:13:31,919 --> 01:13:33,297
I meant to tell ya...

926
01:13:35,715 --> 01:13:36,841
about earlier...

927
01:13:37,509 --> 01:13:39,511
about this morning.
I wanted to apologize, first.

928
01:13:40,887 --> 01:13:42,605
L'm sorry and...

929
01:13:48,145 --> 01:13:50,113
I like it when you teach me stuff.

930
01:13:51,857 --> 01:13:56,534
And... I get it
when you explain shit to me.

931
01:13:57,906 --> 01:14:00,000
For that reason,

932
01:14:00,117 --> 01:14:03,041
it makes me wanna ask you,
do you wanna keep doing it?

933
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:09,714
Mom!
Dinnefs ready!

934
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:18,304
Thanks, I'm coming.

935
01:14:19,805 --> 01:14:22,103
Thai way...

936
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:24,852
I could pass my exams
at the end of the year, and...

937
01:14:25,353 --> 01:14:26,980
'cause when l'm old enough,

938
01:14:27,105 --> 01:14:30,905
I'll apply to an Art school,
in the Slates.

939
01:14:31,025 --> 01:14:32,117
Juilliard.

940
01:14:34,487 --> 01:14:36,866
And I think Die likes you.

941
01:14:36,991 --> 01:14:39,335
We like you, we're chill.

942
01:14:40,202 --> 01:14:42,671
You're on sabbatical
so if you stay with me,

943
01:14:42,788 --> 01:14:46,714
she could find a day job
and we'd get it going again.

944
01:14:52,132 --> 01:14:54,555
I don't mean to interrupt
but the food's gonna get cold!

945
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:51,378
Show me!

946
01:18:00,129 --> 01:18:01,221
Come back here, you dork!

947
01:18:01,339 --> 01:18:02,932
Get your ass here!

948
01:18:04,759 --> 01:18:06,887
Chill out!

949
01:18:08,222 --> 01:18:10,645
You goddamn stupid punk!
l'mma come and getcha!

950
01:18:17,147 --> 01:18:18,741
What the hell are you doing'?!

951
01:18:23,405 --> 01:18:25,407
Stop encouraging him!

952
01:18:25,532 --> 01:18:27,876
L'm trying to raise that kid!

953
01:18:35,251 --> 01:18:36,719
I'm free!

954
01:18:37,294 --> 01:18:39,514
I am free!

955
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,522
D'you like ital dente'?

956
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:50,109
I'm from a special school of thought.

957
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:54,857
I like my pasta just a tiny tiny bit
harder than al dente.

958
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:56,483
Well, it's al dente now!

959
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:59,030
Strain them, illico pesto!

960
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:02,623
- Fail! Keep your day job, please!
- Why don't ya shut it!

961
01:19:03,574 --> 01:19:06,077
Says here the mayo
may contain mustard.

962
01:19:06,201 --> 01:19:08,579
Yeah, they always write that BS,
even for cookies!

963
01:19:08,704 --> 01:19:09,500
I hate fucking mustard.

964
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:12,630
Just put two spoonfuls, just two.

965
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:14,427
What the...?

966
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:17,969
Don't put the dressing yet,
it'll make the lettuce soggy.

967
01:19:18,089 --> 01:19:20,262
Kyla, start 'em pine nuts!
On low.

968
01:19:20,383 --> 01:19:21,852
So they don't burn!

969
01:19:26,432 --> 01:19:28,776
You've been served, ma'am.

970
01:19:29,518 --> 01:19:30,735
Good evening.

971
01:19:45,661 --> 01:19:48,039
It may contain traces of mustard.

972
01:19:48,623 --> 01:19:51,046
Myourson.

973
01:19:51,167 --> 01:19:54,672
...set fire to the cafeteria.

974
01:19:54,797 --> 01:19:56,765
This fire caused physical
and moral damages...

975
01:19:56,882 --> 01:19:58,429
Pine nuts are ready!

976
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:00,678
Take 'em out of the pan
so they won't burn!

977
01:20:01,428 --> 01:20:02,680
...to our son Kevin Julien.

978
01:20:02,805 --> 01:20:04,683
Put the lid on, so they stay moist.

979
01:20:07,644 --> 01:20:08,611
75% of his face...

980
01:20:08,728 --> 01:20:10,025
...skin graft...

981
01:20:10,146 --> 01:20:11,614
Can we change the subject?

982
01:20:14,485 --> 01:20:16,908
Please act accordingly.

983
01:20:46,687 --> 01:20:48,064
Pour the dressing.

984
01:20:48,188 --> 01:20:52,238
Stop poking my face with that shit!

985
01:20:52,359 --> 01:20:53,611
L'mma look like a slut!

986
01:20:53,735 --> 01:20:55,658
You already look like one!

987
01:20:56,405 --> 01:20:57,282
Stop it!

988
01:20:58,324 --> 01:21:00,076
That sweaters way too small.

989
01:21:00,201 --> 01:21:02,829
It's got a big spot, like you
slept in a pile of shit.

990
01:21:02,954 --> 01:21:04,331
Pile of shit, yourself!

991
01:21:04,455 --> 01:21:05,957
Mind your own, kiss ass!

992
01:21:06,291 --> 01:21:08,920
Is the kid that set the canteen
on fire a pile of shit?

993
01:21:09,044 --> 01:21:10,921
The kid whose mom's
meeting with the neighbour

994
01:21:11,046 --> 01:21:12,468
who's helping for free

995
01:21:12,798 --> 01:21:14,675
so you'don't end up
at George-Etienne Lemieux?

996
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,349
- I'm not going back!
- I know, you dumbass!

997
01:21:17,469 --> 01:21:19,689
But for fuck's sake,
we gotta lawyer our asses up.

998
01:21:19,806 --> 01:21:21,729
We can't just sit and wait for God

999
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:24,319
to come down on an effin cloud!

1000
01:21:24,436 --> 01:21:27,030
I have a bird-nest on my head!

1001
01:21:27,606 --> 01:21:28,574
I'm not a tumbleweed!

1002
01:21:28,691 --> 01:21:30,068
Wait.

1003
01:21:30,943 --> 01:21:32,160
L'm getting there.

1004
01:21:32,278 --> 01:21:33,245
I know.

1005
01:21:41,246 --> 01:21:43,840
Fucking douche.

1006
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:47,673
10 max, l'm peacing out.

1007
01:21:48,295 --> 01:21:51,596
No one's pissing till I say so.

1008
01:21:51,716 --> 01:21:53,684
Steve, you have to do it.

1009
01:21:53,801 --> 01:21:56,680
2-3 hours of your precious time,
suck it up.

1010
01:21:56,804 --> 01:21:57,771
Fuck that shit!

1011
01:21:58,556 --> 01:22:00,855
I'm done with that dirty mouth!
Fuck fuck fuck!

1012
01:22:00,976 --> 01:22:01,977
Back off!

1013
01:22:02,102 --> 01:22:03,775
L've had it 'bout up to here!

1014
01:22:03,896 --> 01:22:06,570
We'll make a good impression tonight!

1015
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:08,988
Are you blind or you just dumb!

1016
01:22:09,109 --> 01:22:13,035
That dick doesn't wanna help us,
he just wants in your panties!

1017
01:22:25,461 --> 01:22:26,838
We'll be right out!

1018
01:22:26,963 --> 01:22:28,215
No problemo!

1019
01:22:31,467 --> 01:22:34,062
As usual...
Thank you.

1020
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,977
Good luck.

1021
01:22:40,102 --> 01:22:41,354
We'll do what we can.

1022
01:22:44,357 --> 01:22:46,234
You coming, cutie?

1023
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:51,405
You wait!

1024
01:22:52,573 --> 01:22:53,541
Stay here.

1025
01:22:57,162 --> 01:22:59,164
There's no lwo ways about it.

1026
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:02,213
Mom's got a couple gigs
here and there

1027
01:23:02,334 --> 01:23:04,053
for bills and groceries.

1028
01:23:05,171 --> 01:23:07,219
Not a lawsuit, not a lawyer.

1029
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:11,429
If we don't defend ourselves...

1030
01:23:15,641 --> 01:23:17,188
We gotta put some water
in ourwine...

1031
01:23:18,227 --> 01:23:19,399
Huh. baby?

1032
01:23:19,979 --> 01:23:22,698
Ever heard that expression?

1033
01:23:24,818 --> 01:23:29,198
We stick together, tonight.
Mom's there for ya, and vice versa.

1034
01:23:33,326 --> 01:23:34,202
We good?

1035
01:23:52,222 --> 01:23:53,348
Wheeeeretoooooo!

1036
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:56,351
Alrighty!

1037
01:23:57,228 --> 01:23:59,947
It's scary,
how nothing's changed here.

1038
01:24:00,065 --> 01:24:03,285
That secret sauce
is what scares me!

1039
01:24:03,401 --> 01:24:04,994
Those freaking secrets scare me.

1040
01:24:05,904 --> 01:24:07,657
I don't get it.

1041
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:09,366
I just don't.

1042
01:24:10,201 --> 01:24:11,919
I don't get them burgers!

1043
01:24:12,036 --> 01:24:14,130
Who's into that stuff
except for tourists

1044
01:24:14,246 --> 01:24:15,839
who've never seen flat bread?

1045
01:24:16,332 --> 01:24:19,803
I was surprised
you brought up that place.

1046
01:24:20,921 --> 01:24:25,267
Who'd be into swaggy homemade burgers

1047
01:24:25,383 --> 01:24:27,306
with nice hot sauce

1048
01:24:27,427 --> 01:24:31,774
and melting cheddar
when you got that effin orange cheese

1049
01:24:31,891 --> 01:24:35,361
from some obese-packed
American dive, eh?

1050
01:24:36,312 --> 01:24:39,112
I guess my dad was just
some random tourist.

1051
01:24:44,196 --> 01:24:47,917
He sure knows how to liven it up.

1052
01:24:57,836 --> 01:25:00,590
I hope you like karaoke, Steve.

1053
01:25:00,714 --> 01:25:03,558
'Cause I got it all planned out!

1054
01:25:03,676 --> 01:25:05,394
You kidding, we love it!

1055
01:25:05,511 --> 01:25:07,605
I told ya on the phone, he sings!

1056
01:25:07,721 --> 01:25:09,268
I don't sing, I dance!

1057
01:25:10,851 --> 01:25:13,149
You can do both at once,
you're no dummy.

1058
01:25:15,105 --> 01:25:19,360
You gonna smack like a cow
without manners all night, or what?

1059
01:25:22,655 --> 01:25:25,704
Wait until I sing Eye of the Tiger,

1060
01:25:25,825 --> 01:25:27,668
you'll loosen up.

1061
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:31,373
Freakin' blast from the past!

1062
01:25:31,957 --> 01:25:33,709
I've been hooked since '82.

1063
01:25:34,751 --> 01:25:38,255
I saw it maybe 11 times,

1064
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:40,257
and I keep forgetting how it ends!

1065
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:44,638
I have the Scarface poster
on my fridge.

1066
01:25:47,557 --> 01:25:49,685
But about...

1067
01:25:50,435 --> 01:25:53,485
about Steve...

1068
01:25:54,356 --> 01:25:56,825
'Cause our Steve here got himself...

1069
01:25:58,819 --> 01:26:01,322
in a fine mess...

1070
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:04,292
He's a pro.

1071
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:07,708
It's about time we...

1072
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:11,417
get to the bottom of things...

1073
01:26:25,515 --> 01:26:29,816
- Whatcha gonna sing tonight, Steve?
- Yeah, what?

1074
01:26:42,617 --> 01:26:47,294
Get the fuck out!
I just can't believe it!

1075
01:26:47,414 --> 01:26:49,462
Eyes like this, jaw-dropped!

1076
01:26:49,583 --> 01:26:51,631
He's standing frozen,
drooling on the floor.

1077
01:26:51,752 --> 01:26:54,801
Poor girl's got her money's worth!

1078
01:26:55,506 --> 01:26:57,930
Her dude shows up,
middle of the night!

1079
01:26:58,051 --> 01:26:59,724
Busts her with the stripper,

1080
01:26:59,844 --> 01:27:02,017
his schlong
sticking outta his speedo!

1081
01:27:03,515 --> 01:27:05,142
One big schlong!

1082
01:27:05,475 --> 01:27:06,601
Steve, buddy'?

1083
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,897
Whafs our song, kiddo!

1084
01:27:10,231 --> 01:27:11,278
You know what'?

1085
01:27:11,399 --> 01:27:12,992
Why don't we pick a song,

1086
01:27:13,109 --> 01:27:14,611
and sing your mom some duet,

1087
01:27:14,735 --> 01:27:16,578
a beautiful song
for a beautiful woman.

1088
01:27:21,493 --> 01:27:25,543
Hey Missy! Same thing. here!
Die, seconds?

1089
01:27:25,664 --> 01:27:26,540
Bring it on!

1090
01:27:26,665 --> 01:27:28,589
Make that two!

1091
01:27:28,918 --> 01:27:29,919
Thanks!

1092
01:27:30,044 --> 01:27:32,172
So... my dear Paul...

1093
01:27:34,924 --> 01:27:39,396
About Steve and that whole shebang,

1094
01:27:39,513 --> 01:27:43,234
we better talk it through
before we're too wasted to speak!

1095
01:27:43,851 --> 01:27:45,524
L'm never too wasted.

1096
01:27:46,228 --> 01:27:48,071
Seriously, Paul,

1097
01:27:48,188 --> 01:27:51,284
could you direct...

1098
01:27:53,945 --> 01:27:56,323
our direction...

1099
01:27:56,448 --> 01:27:59,497
in this crazy whatchamacallit'?

1100
01:27:59,617 --> 01:28:01,336
The only thing you gotta know

1101
01:28:01,454 --> 01:28:03,548
is that when it comes to a lawsuit,

1102
01:28:04,832 --> 01:28:08,632
it's all about the angle.
- Oh, yeah.

1103
01:28:08,753 --> 01:28:10,506
What's your angle'?

1104
01:28:10,630 --> 01:28:12,598
Is it this one'?

1105
01:28:12,716 --> 01:28:13,638
Or this one?

1106
01:28:13,759 --> 01:28:15,602
I dunno, you're the boss!

1107
01:28:15,719 --> 01:28:16,561
Or this one?

1108
01:28:16,678 --> 01:28:18,225
That ain't the same!

1109
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,057
That's another one!

1110
01:28:20,182 --> 01:28:22,060
It's fragile, but it's the angle.

1111
01:28:22,185 --> 01:28:26,065
Seriously, drop by my place
tomorrow morning.

1112
01:28:26,189 --> 01:28:28,783
Doesn't feel right talking about it
with Steve around,

1113
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:31,028
we should be partying,
kicking back a few!

1114
01:28:31,361 --> 01:28:32,955
Are you a cottage kinda girl?

1115
01:28:33,072 --> 01:28:37,543
Well, cottage, just like that, eh'?

1116
01:28:37,659 --> 01:28:41,539
My cottage yeah, we could go
for a day, or two, or three

1117
01:28:41,955 --> 01:28:45,506
whenever I don't have my daughter
and you uh... I dunno...

1118
01:28:45,627 --> 01:28:46,469
ldunno...

1119
01:29:09,861 --> 01:29:13,411
- Hey, you got Vivo Per Lei'?
- Huh?

1120
01:29:13,532 --> 01:29:14,750
Vivo Per Lei, the song.

1121
01:29:14,867 --> 01:29:17,996
Andrea Bocelli, yup, I have it.

1122
01:29:18,121 --> 01:29:21,796
You have the duet version,
the guy and the girl?

1123
01:29:21,916 --> 01:29:24,420
- I do.
- You wouldn't sing it with me, eh?

1124
01:29:24,545 --> 01:29:26,593
Sure! Could be fun!

1125
01:29:26,922 --> 01:29:28,674
Go on, I'll be right up.
- Thanks.

1126
01:29:46,902 --> 01:29:49,451
Hey, it's our international Steve!

1127
01:29:50,448 --> 01:29:52,200
Steve's the shy type but,

1128
01:29:52,324 --> 01:29:55,168
give him some time
and he's stealing the show!

1129
01:29:55,828 --> 01:29:59,709
Steve's the mingle-type.

1130
01:30:17,143 --> 01:30:20,990
I'm sure that ain't a favorite here!

1131
01:30:22,733 --> 01:30:24,451
Canada's got talent, eh!

1132
01:30:26,278 --> 01:30:28,532
Who's that homo!

1133
01:31:01,317 --> 01:31:02,864
Check this out, guys!

1134
01:31:48,910 --> 01:31:52,506
Sing. faggot, sins!

1135
01:32:24,658 --> 01:32:28,037
You lemme sing my song
and shut your fucking cunt!

1136
01:32:28,162 --> 01:32:31,837
You lemme sing
or l'mma fucking rip your face!

1137
01:32:31,957 --> 01:32:34,585
- Chill out, man!
- Fuck off, asshole!

1138
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:36,133
Steve, stop right now!

1139
01:32:36,254 --> 01:32:39,724
Motherfucker!
l'mma fucking kill you, ok!

1140
01:32:41,968 --> 01:32:46,395
You punks get the fuck outta my sight
before I call the pigs!

1141
01:32:46,515 --> 01:32:48,643
Come on, scram!

1142
01:32:50,519 --> 01:32:52,863
- Steve, come here!
- I'm going home!

1143
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:55,779
Do what you want.
Fuck him, I don't give a shit.

1144
01:32:55,901 --> 01:32:58,575
Listen to your Mom, come here,
we'll talk like adults,

1145
01:32:58,695 --> 01:33:01,164
Adults who chugged 27 beers'?
No thanks.

1146
01:33:01,281 --> 01:33:03,955
We're doing this for you, son,
not for me!

1147
01:33:04,076 --> 01:33:05,828
You're the one in trouble
with the law,

1148
01:33:05,952 --> 01:33:07,170
we're looking for solutions here!

1149
01:33:07,288 --> 01:33:08,881
In a Karaoke bar'?

1150
01:33:08,998 --> 01:33:11,342
Wake up, Diane,
he just wants to bone you!

1151
01:33:11,459 --> 01:33:14,588
Hey you watch your mouth!
We're older than you!

1152
01:33:14,712 --> 01:33:15,759
Older my ass!

1153
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:16,927
Stop it, Steve!

1154
01:33:17,591 --> 01:33:20,936
Why? Sol can sing while
that gaylord rubs his dick on ya!

1155
01:33:21,053 --> 01:33:22,726
That's enough, you little shit!

1156
01:33:22,846 --> 01:33:23,972
Don't start!

1157
01:33:24,598 --> 01:33:26,396
- Watch your goddam mouth with her!
- We're all drunk--

1158
01:33:26,517 --> 01:33:28,771
D'you even hear yourself?
Who d'you think you are?

1159
01:33:28,895 --> 01:33:32,820
She's going through hell for ya!
Because of ya!

1160
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:36,161
She gives you everything,
her cash, her time, her whole life!

1161
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:38,497
And how d'you thank her, tonight?

1162
01:33:38,614 --> 01:33:41,288
Spit in my face and start a brawl!

1163
01:33:41,409 --> 01:33:42,501
Go fuck yourself bitch

1164
01:33:42,618 --> 01:33:44,871
with your lame-ass shitty lawyer job!

1165
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:46,997
Come on! You just want
my mom to suck your cock--

1166
01:33:47,957 --> 01:33:49,835
Motherfucker!

1167
01:33:55,549 --> 01:33:58,052
Choke on your fucking loser problems.

1168
01:33:58,176 --> 01:34:00,726
Yeah, get the fuck outta here!

1169
01:34:03,307 --> 01:34:05,355
Fuck off!

1170
01:34:13,235 --> 01:34:14,327
That gllY- --

1171
01:34:15,863 --> 01:34:19,584
was gonna help us, you idiot.

1172
01:34:20,117 --> 01:34:21,620
Help you.

1173
01:34:21,745 --> 01:34:23,964
No one can help us.
They/re all the same!

1174
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,084
It's just the two of us,
fuck the rest of 'em!

1175
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:29,552
I don't have any problems, alright?

1176
01:34:29,669 --> 01:34:32,674
You know what my big problem is? You.

1177
01:34:32,798 --> 01:34:36,223
No more job because of you.
No money! No life!

1178
01:34:36,343 --> 01:34:38,562
Meds, bail, correctional centres,

1179
01:34:38,679 --> 01:34:39,976
and now a lawsuit!

1180
01:34:40,097 --> 01:34:43,398
Will someone gimme a fucking break?

1181
01:34:43,518 --> 01:34:46,863
No! Steve-O, ladies and gentlemen!

1182
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:48,607
A break? What the fuck for!

1183
01:34:48,732 --> 01:34:50,905
Dream on, Die, dream on!

1184
01:34:51,526 --> 01:34:53,404
Daddy dug the grave,
sonny keeps digging!

1185
01:34:53,529 --> 01:34:57,204
And I'm singing in the rain!
And it just goes on and on and on,

1186
01:34:57,325 --> 01:35:00,169
'cause ya always find
a fucking brilliant way

1187
01:35:00,286 --> 01:35:03,211
so it hits the fan full effin blast!

1188
01:35:03,332 --> 01:35:05,505
And I just keep cleaning
the shit off the walls!

1189
01:35:05,626 --> 01:35:10,507
Come on, wipe the retard's ass!
Just wipe that effin retard's ass!

1190
01:35:23,478 --> 01:35:24,696
Now...

1191
01:37:11,555 --> 01:37:12,852
What can I do for you'?

1192
01:37:13,891 --> 01:37:15,359
Where were you'?

1193
01:37:19,271 --> 01:37:20,147
When?

1194
01:37:22,108 --> 01:37:23,576
When d'ya think?

1195
01:37:25,528 --> 01:37:26,950
I was sleeping.

1196
01:38:01,317 --> 01:38:02,786
Maybe, one day...

1197
01:38:06,115 --> 01:38:07,742
you won't love me anymore.

1198
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:11,582
It's true.

1199
01:38:12,496 --> 01:38:13,544
It happens.

1200
01:38:18,169 --> 01:38:19,170
Me...

1201
01:38:20,463 --> 01:38:22,261
I'll always be there for you.

1202
01:38:23,843 --> 01:38:25,140
You...

1203
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:27,472
You're my priority.

1204
01:39:04,553 --> 01:39:06,852
Aisle 2, aisle 3...
Jesus Christ!

1205
01:39:06,973 --> 01:39:08,816
Is it too much
to put fucking signs up!

1206
01:39:09,434 --> 01:39:11,812
Calm down, we'll find it.

1207
01:39:12,312 --> 01:39:16,739
He's on a high, Some bad phase.
That ain't in the budget right now.

1208
01:39:17,610 --> 01:39:18,953
- What?
- Don't touch anything!

1209
01:39:19,487 --> 01:39:20,989
All phases have an end,

1210
01:39:21,572 --> 01:39:22,789
he'll mellow out soon...

1211
01:39:22,907 --> 01:39:25,751
Here, take half my list

1212
01:39:25,868 --> 01:39:27,621
so we can gel outta here.

1213
01:39:27,746 --> 01:39:28,713
L'm going that way.

1214
01:39:29,372 --> 01:39:30,464
Don't touch anything!

1215
01:39:30,916 --> 01:39:33,419
I don't know your mom
like you do, but...

1216
01:39:33,877 --> 01:39:35,879
I know what being a mom's like.

1217
01:39:36,797 --> 01:39:39,096
She doesn't mean any hann.

1218
01:39:39,217 --> 01:39:41,311
It's her fear talking.

1219
01:39:41,844 --> 01:39:43,096
Fear drives people.

1220
01:39:43,513 --> 01:39:45,891
I don't give a shit if she don't
want me anymore.

1221
01:39:46,265 --> 01:39:49,520
Doesn't. She does want you with her.
Come on, please.

1222
01:39:50,687 --> 01:39:52,234
You have to refocus.

1223
01:39:53,357 --> 01:39:56,577
We'll focus on grades 10 and 11,
and then...

1224
01:39:57,194 --> 01:39:58,366
when the time comes...

1225
01:39:59,614 --> 01:40:01,867
we'll apply to Juilliard.

1226
01:40:02,492 --> 01:40:06,167
One day we'll get a nice letter

1227
01:40:06,287 --> 01:40:07,709
in a nice envelope,

1228
01:40:07,831 --> 01:40:09,834
and your mom will be so proud.

1229
01:41:20,327 --> 01:41:21,169
You can do it.

1230
01:41:28,085 --> 01:41:30,304
Just say the fucking words.

1231
01:41:35,969 --> 01:41:36,811
What'?

1232
01:41:42,517 --> 01:41:44,315
The hell d'you do'?

1233
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:52,157
Come on...

1234
01:41:58,494 --> 01:42:01,043
We still love each other, right'?

1235
01:42:01,622 --> 01:42:05,172
That's what we best at, buddy!
Let's go, dmere!

1236
01:42:05,709 --> 01:42:07,553
Grab the feet, Kyla.

1237
01:45:09,953 --> 01:45:11,170
Are you coming home late'?

1238
01:45:13,999 --> 01:45:18,176
Are you cooking
or should I order?

1239
01:45:25,928 --> 01:45:28,148
I'll be home for dinner
but order, yeah.

1240
01:45:28,682 --> 01:45:30,480
I won't be in the mood.

1241
01:45:31,268 --> 01:45:35,273
The box below contains 4 balls...

1242
01:45:37,232 --> 01:45:39,702
Numbered from 1 to 4.

1243
01:45:39,819 --> 01:45:45,417
Successively draw two balls
from the box without replacement.

1244
01:45:45,992 --> 01:45:47,244
Balls...

1245
01:45:49,205 --> 01:45:52,675
You don't return
the first ball in the box

1246
01:45:52,791 --> 01:45:54,714
before drawing the second one.

1247
01:45:55,169 --> 01:45:56,091
Balls...

1248
01:45:59,216 --> 01:46:00,638
Go on.

1249
01:46:01,092 --> 01:46:01,718
The result--

1250
01:46:02,761 --> 01:46:04,479
What's that sexy white car
doing in my driveway?

1251
01:46:16,817 --> 01:46:18,034
D'you like it'?

1252
01:46:19,195 --> 01:46:20,573
Where to, miss?

1253
01:46:20,697 --> 01:46:23,291
It's got an ass-heater.

1254
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:24,872
See the button'?

1255
01:46:45,558 --> 01:46:48,607
A mother doesn't wake up one morning
not loving her son.

1256
01:46:49,478 --> 01:46:50,775
Do you get that?

1257
01:46:53,984 --> 01:46:55,076
Yeah, whatev...

1258
01:46:58,613 --> 01:47:00,581
The only thing thafs gonna happen...

1259
01:47:01,908 --> 01:47:04,253
is I'll love you more and more.

1260
01:47:06,998 --> 01:47:09,672
And you'll be the one loving me
less and less, but...

1261
01:47:14,298 --> 01:47:15,971
Life works that way.

1262
01:47:17,342 --> 01:47:18,935
We deal with it.

1263
01:47:19,678 --> 01:47:23,354
It's the natural order of things,
you'll get that one day, bud.

1264
01:47:25,101 --> 01:47:26,944
You know what I'm saying?

1265
01:47:27,061 --> 01:47:28,529
D'you understand?

1266
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:41,247
D'ya pack your bags like I asked'?

1267
01:47:46,791 --> 01:47:48,759
D'you pack your shit or what'?

1268
01:47:54,049 --> 01:47:55,176
Don't tickle me!

1269
01:47:59,513 --> 01:48:01,186
Don't forget the sandwiches!

1270
01:48:02,350 --> 01:48:03,897
Look what I found in the fridge!

1271
01:48:04,644 --> 01:48:05,567
Look!

1272
01:48:06,271 --> 01:48:08,114
How the fuck is that my problem'?

1273
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:11,076
Back door locked, eh'?

1274
01:48:18,451 --> 01:48:20,453
It's gonna be an effin trip!

1275
01:48:20,578 --> 01:48:22,376
Do you want this with you, Die'?

1276
01:48:22,497 --> 01:48:23,794
Yeah, not in the trunk.

1277
01:48:29,838 --> 01:48:31,385
We got everything?

1278
01:48:31,715 --> 01:48:33,262
Didn't forget anything?

1279
01:53:29,666 --> 01:53:30,667
It's green.

1280
01:53:32,002 --> 01:53:32,924
You okay?

1281
01:53:49,813 --> 01:53:51,440
I gotta use the washroom.

1282
01:53:59,407 --> 01:54:00,624
Lefs try this place.

1283
01:55:20,621 --> 01:55:22,623
Mom's pissing?

1284
01:55:45,606 --> 01:55:47,199
Am I squishing you'?

1285
01:57:01,689 --> 01:57:03,783
You motherfucking bitch from hell!

1286
01:57:04,567 --> 01:57:06,320
Take it easy! Take it easy!

1287
01:57:06,695 --> 01:57:08,288
Back off, asshole!

1288
01:57:08,948 --> 01:57:11,451
Don't touch me, don't talk to me!
- Chill out, bro!

1289
01:57:23,630 --> 01:57:25,598
- Easy, easy, easy...
- Relax, we're hereto help.

1290
01:57:27,343 --> 01:57:29,471
Why you doing this to me,
you bitch!

1291
01:57:29,595 --> 01:57:32,439
It's for you own good, sweetie!

1292
01:57:33,015 --> 01:57:34,983
My own good, you fucking traitor!

1293
01:57:35,810 --> 01:57:38,155
You dump me here like goddamn trash!

1294
01:57:38,272 --> 01:57:40,570
You got sick of me!
You're done with me!

1295
01:57:46,822 --> 01:57:48,996
Don't be violent, Steve.
There's no point.

1296
01:57:49,117 --> 01:57:51,666
Shut up!
You gonna taze my ass, bitch!

1297
01:57:51,786 --> 01:57:54,084
You want 'em
to fucking electrocute me!

1298
01:57:59,461 --> 01:58:02,840
I won't touch you if you come
in the hospital without resisting.

1299
01:58:03,549 --> 01:58:05,176
No! I ain't mad!

1300
01:58:05,301 --> 01:58:07,429
I ain't goin in a hospital!
Do I look fucking crazy?

1301
01:58:07,553 --> 01:58:08,806
No one here's crazy. pal.

1302
01:58:09,139 --> 01:58:12,643
Stop it! No! lwon't go! Mom!

1303
01:58:13,393 --> 01:58:15,270
I don't wanna go! I won't!

1304
01:58:16,730 --> 01:58:19,405
Don't leave me here!
Don't do this to me!

1305
01:58:21,444 --> 01:58:22,366
Mom!

1306
01:58:25,698 --> 01:58:28,747
And you, you fucking wimp!
You too?

1307
01:58:29,118 --> 01:58:31,588
You bitches are all against me!
All of you!

1308
01:58:31,705 --> 01:58:33,127
I said back the fuck off!

1309
01:58:34,916 --> 01:58:36,418
Is that fucking necessary!

1310
01:58:36,543 --> 01:58:38,921
Lel us do our job!

1311
01:58:39,046 --> 01:58:41,266
- Drop that!
- You gonna fucking hurt me!

1312
01:58:42,216 --> 01:58:43,559
Calm the fuck down, man!

1313
01:58:43,676 --> 01:58:44,518
Calm down!

1314
01:58:46,346 --> 01:58:47,268
Let me fucking go!

1315
01:58:47,388 --> 01:58:48,389
Lel him go!

1316
01:58:49,891 --> 01:58:51,189
Son of a bitch!

1317
01:58:53,812 --> 01:58:54,938
Let go of him!

1318
01:58:55,939 --> 01:58:57,065
Son of a bitch!

1319
01:58:57,191 --> 01:58:58,659
L'm just doing my job, ma'am!

1320
01:58:58,776 --> 01:59:01,280
He hit my son!

1321
01:59:01,613 --> 01:59:04,662
He hii him! He hit him!

1322
01:59:04,783 --> 01:59:06,911
You signed the form!

1323
01:59:07,035 --> 01:59:08,708
Let us do our job!
That's enough, ma'am!

1324
01:59:08,828 --> 01:59:11,081
I didn't sign for you
to hit my son!

1325
01:59:11,206 --> 01:59:12,800
Withdrawal clause ends
in 24 hours!

1326
01:59:12,917 --> 01:59:14,419
Fuck your clause!

1327
01:59:14,752 --> 01:59:17,756
- Come back in 24 hours, ma'am!
- Mom, he's hurting me!

1328
01:59:18,089 --> 01:59:20,342
L'm his mother, I decide!

1329
01:59:20,466 --> 01:59:21,433
Not anymore!

1330
01:59:25,138 --> 01:59:27,937
What are they doing to him'?
I changed my mind!

1331
01:59:28,058 --> 01:59:29,651
Get out of the fucking way!

1332
01:59:30,644 --> 01:59:31,611
Son of a bitch!

1333
02:01:42,247 --> 02:01:44,295
There goes the forest...

1334
02:01:45,458 --> 02:01:47,711
Forest again...

1335
02:01:50,046 --> 02:01:52,095
And, now the beach, okay...

1336
02:02:27,838 --> 02:02:30,432
Hi, you've reached Diane's voicemail.

1337
02:02:30,549 --> 02:02:31,550
Leave a message

1338
02:02:32,426 --> 02:02:33,849
and I'll call you back
as soon as possible.

1339
02:02:34,387 --> 02:02:35,809
Thank you, bye, have a nice day.

1340
02:02:37,098 --> 02:02:38,725
Hey, it's me.

1341
02:02:39,392 --> 02:02:42,145
I bet you must be
cleaning up your houses...

1342
02:02:43,355 --> 02:02:45,574
l'm pretty bad-ass high...

1343
02:02:46,942 --> 02:02:49,036
Iwas calling to say...

1344
02:02:53,699 --> 02:02:55,873
Yo Die,
I'm so fucking ripped, serious...

1345
02:02:57,537 --> 02:02:59,380
If you could see my face...

1346
02:02:59,789 --> 02:03:02,167
You'd laugh your ass off!

1347
02:03:04,712 --> 02:03:06,760
I thought you were gonna answer.

1348
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:08,842
I wanted to tell you...

1349
02:03:13,137 --> 02:03:15,106
I just wanted to...

1350
02:03:15,223 --> 02:03:17,601
thank you for your patience.

1351
02:03:18,852 --> 02:03:21,822
I know I'm rough.

1352
02:03:21,938 --> 02:03:24,111
Like Grandma used to say
when I was younger,

1353
02:03:24,232 --> 02:03:25,358
that I was rough.

1354
02:03:26,027 --> 02:03:28,405
Now I get it, why she said that.

1355
02:03:29,614 --> 02:03:31,207
So... I'm sorry.

1356
02:03:32,825 --> 02:03:34,042
And...

1357
02:03:38,749 --> 02:03:39,796
And when...

1358
02:03:40,751 --> 02:03:42,924
When I think about the times when...

1359
02:03:45,381 --> 02:03:48,431
When I think about
how much maybe I hurt you...

1360
02:03:50,178 --> 02:03:53,682
After, when I get my shit together...

1361
02:03:56,559 --> 02:03:58,528
l'm so fucking sad because...

1362
02:03:58,646 --> 02:04:01,399
you deserve so much better
than a fucking retard like me!

1363
02:04:06,570 --> 02:04:07,617
So...

1364
02:04:11,993 --> 02:04:16,373
What matters is... I'm thinking
about you here, and I love you.

1365
02:04:20,545 --> 02:04:24,095
Tell Kyla I said hi.

1366
02:04:31,807 --> 02:04:33,650
Was it okay'?

1367
02:04:38,021 --> 02:04:39,865
I mean, was it...

1368
02:04:40,692 --> 02:04:42,444
I was okay? 'lght.

1369
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:50,544
I rang.

1370
02:04:51,287 --> 02:04:53,460
I didn't hear ya,
it must be broken.

1371
02:04:57,042 --> 02:05:00,421
I'm cleaning up that shed,
it's a freakin' pigsty.

1372
02:05:03,216 --> 02:05:04,593
Are you okay'?

1373
02:05:04,926 --> 02:05:06,519
Of course!

1374
02:05:06,636 --> 02:05:09,105
You?
Long time no see, stranger!

1375
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:12,690
You wanna come in, have a beer'?

1376
02:05:12,810 --> 02:05:15,780
Watch some TV,
I finally plugged it in.

1377
02:05:15,897 --> 02:05:17,365
It's just aboul time I did.

1378
02:05:19,066 --> 02:05:20,033
Have a beer!

1379
02:05:20,777 --> 02:05:24,248
We can have dinner too,
I'll fix some pasta...

1380
02:05:25,240 --> 02:05:26,287
Come on!

1381
02:05:27,451 --> 02:05:28,543
There!

1382
02:05:30,704 --> 02:05:31,956
My good glasses...

1383
02:05:46,263 --> 02:05:50,313
I came to tell you
we're moving to Toronto.

1384
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:52,398
For Patrick's job.

1385
02:05:58,109 --> 02:05:59,656
Get outta here!

1386
02:06:00,403 --> 02:06:03,031
Well, that ain't dull news, Toronto!

1387
02:06:03,782 --> 02:06:05,035
Jeez, I only got beer!

1388
02:06:05,701 --> 02:06:08,705
Had I known, lwould have gotten
something more fancy! To party!

1389
02:06:09,497 --> 02:06:11,249
L'll be damned!

1390
02:06:12,083 --> 02:06:14,211
I lived in Toronto. once!

1391
02:06:14,669 --> 02:06:16,468
Ages ago, though, but...

1392
02:06:17,673 --> 02:06:20,096
Just before Steve, actually.

1393
02:06:20,217 --> 02:06:24,267
I'd written down tons of addresses
and places and...

1394
02:06:24,388 --> 02:06:28,610
in that huge, huge address book
I could give you...

1395
02:06:29,394 --> 02:06:31,237
'Cause you can't tell right away,

1396
02:06:32,397 --> 02:06:35,571
but Toronto can be an effin bore
if you dunno your way around.

1397
02:06:36,235 --> 02:06:37,782
All of these places
I spotted, jeez...

1398
02:06:38,112 --> 02:06:42,162
Restaurants, some good ones,
and cute shops, not tourist-traps.

1399
02:06:43,033 --> 02:06:45,627
There's no way I threw that away!
Where the hell is it...

1400
02:06:46,537 --> 02:06:48,085
When are you guys leaving?

1401
02:06:48,623 --> 02:06:51,126
Well, two months from now,
originally,

1402
02:06:52,961 --> 02:06:54,429
but then...

1403
02:06:55,881 --> 02:06:59,932
they moved it
to two week-ends from now.

1404
02:07:01,929 --> 02:07:03,476
But now...

1405
02:07:03,598 --> 02:07:05,100
finally...

1406
02:07:07,351 --> 02:07:10,105
we're leaving next weekend.

1407
02:07:10,230 --> 02:07:11,857
Shit on a brick!

1408
02:07:12,441 --> 02:07:13,693
Next weekend?!

1409
02:07:14,318 --> 02:07:16,070
Wow!

1410
02:07:20,158 --> 02:07:23,537
Talk about a big project!
Well, that's quite the adventure!

1411
02:07:23,661 --> 02:07:26,631
You're moving to Toronto
next weekend!

1412
02:07:27,999 --> 02:07:29,843
You must be over the effin moon!

1413
02:07:36,008 --> 02:07:38,477
I didn't think you'd react that way.

1414
02:07:41,806 --> 02:07:44,650
What the hell did ya expect!
It's such great news!

1415
02:07:46,269 --> 02:07:49,193
It's awesome!
It's freaking awesome!

1416
02:07:49,314 --> 02:07:50,441
You best write me, girl!

1417
02:07:51,817 --> 02:07:54,866
If you don't, l'll visit you,
I swear l will, want it or not!

1418
02:07:58,032 --> 02:08:00,330
I gotta go back to my boxes...

1419
02:08:00,869 --> 02:08:03,122
Stay, grab a beer!

1420
02:08:03,246 --> 02:08:05,248
Let's have dinner to celebrate!

1421
02:08:05,374 --> 02:08:08,218
By the way,
bugs are eating up my apples,

1422
02:08:08,335 --> 02:08:11,510
I gotta do something with them.
I could bake a pie.

1423
02:08:11,631 --> 02:08:15,431
We'll have some pie. I got some
nice ice cream to put on top!

1424
02:08:17,845 --> 02:08:20,268
I could come back later!

1425
02:08:20,390 --> 02:08:22,735
Come with Patrick!

1426
02:08:22,851 --> 02:08:23,818
And your daughter!

1427
02:08:24,478 --> 02:08:25,400
They never came over!

1428
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:41,838
I don't want you to think

1429
02:08:41,955 --> 02:08:45,005
these past few months
didn't mean anything to me,

1430
02:08:45,918 --> 02:08:47,295
with you...

1431
02:08:48,462 --> 02:08:49,679
Me too.

1432
02:08:50,297 --> 02:08:52,641
They were important for me too!

1433
02:08:52,758 --> 02:08:53,931
We had fun!

1434
02:08:54,761 --> 02:08:57,310
A shitload of fun!

1435
02:08:58,265 --> 02:09:00,984
You did us good, we loved having ya!

1436
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:02,777
In my life...

1437
02:09:03,353 --> 02:09:05,277
You more of a pie girl
or crisp girl?

1438
02:09:23,459 --> 02:09:25,588
I can't just abandon...

1439
02:09:29,924 --> 02:09:31,176
...abandon my family...

1440
02:09:44,523 --> 02:09:46,196
That's not what I meant.

1441
02:10:03,169 --> 02:10:04,341
You know, Kyla...

1442
02:10:07,758 --> 02:10:09,431
There's just so many ways to deal.

1443
02:10:11,136 --> 02:10:13,810
You deal with your life,
I deal with mine. That's it.

1444
02:10:20,772 --> 02:10:22,319
I sent him there...

1445
02:10:26,402 --> 02:10:27,904
because I have hope.

1446
02:10:29,865 --> 02:10:32,084
L'm fuli of hope, okay'?

1447
02:10:38,415 --> 02:10:40,544
This world ain't got tons of hope.

1448
02:10:42,170 --> 02:10:43,717
But I like to think...

1449
02:10:45,882 --> 02:10:49,512
that it's full of hopeful people,
hoping all day long.

1450
02:10:53,015 --> 02:10:56,315
Better off that way 'cause us
hopeful people can change things.

1451
02:10:57,311 --> 02:10:59,405
Hopeful wol1d with hopeless people...

1452
02:10:59,522 --> 02:11:01,776
That won't get us far.

1453
02:11:04,111 --> 02:11:05,533
Idid what I did...

1454
02:11:10,242 --> 02:11:12,496
so that way, there is hope.

1455
02:11:20,461 --> 02:11:21,679
So lwin.

1456
02:11:25,384 --> 02:11:26,636
All the way.

1457
02:11:28,971 --> 02:11:32,317
It's a win-win.
For everybody.

1458
02:11:36,855 --> 02:11:38,027
So...

1459
02:11:38,899 --> 02:11:41,368
Pie or crisp?

1460
02:13:26,057 --> 02:13:29,278
Dr. Fawcett will pass by later,
for his meds' eval.

1461
02:13:29,603 --> 02:13:31,526
Hopefully, we can relocate him--

1462
02:13:31,647 --> 02:13:33,399
Nah, Micheline's off tonight.

1463
02:13:34,066 --> 02:13:36,160
She left for St-PauFs
but she's back tonight.

1464
02:13:36,277 --> 02:13:38,530
It's her Thursday.
- She's done with Thursdays.

1465
02:13:38,946 --> 02:13:41,416
Not anymore.
Don't ask.

1466
02:13:42,409 --> 02:13:43,911
Don't try to understand, bro.

1467
02:13:45,329 --> 02:13:46,797
What can you do'?

1468
02:13:47,456 --> 02:13:48,582
She's happy with him.

1469
02:13:49,374 --> 02:13:52,345
He started drinking again...
She's back with him, what can I say?

1470
02:13:52,462 --> 02:13:54,590
Is she dumb,
she'll never understand?

1471
02:13:54,714 --> 02:13:56,057
There's nothing to understand.

1472
02:13:56,174 --> 02:13:57,926
She wants to save him.

1473
02:13:58,551 --> 02:13:59,928
Fucking human nature, bro.
