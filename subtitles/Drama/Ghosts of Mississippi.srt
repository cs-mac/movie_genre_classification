00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:03,580
It is better to settle
these matters in the courts...

2
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:05,215
... than on the streets.

3
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:08,352
And new laws are needed
at every level.

4
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:11,920
But law alone cannot make
men see right.

5
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,618
We are confronted primarily
with a moral issue.

6
00:04:15,827 --> 00:04:17,818
The heart of the question is...

7
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,396
... whether all Americans are
to be afforded equal rights...

8
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,362
...and equal opportunities...

9
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:26,602
... whether we treat
our fellow Americans...

10
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:28,136
...as we want to be treated.

11
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:31,331
If an American,
because his skin is dark...

12
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,337
...cannot eat lunch
in a restaurant open to the public...

13
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:37,515
...if he cannot send his children...

14
00:04:37,715 --> 00:04:39,910
... to the best public school
available...

15
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:43,982
...if he cannot vote
for the officials who represent him...

16
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:47,558
...if, in short, he cannot enjoy
the full and free life...

17
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,693
... which all of us want...

18
00:04:50,628 --> 00:04:52,960
... then who among us
would be content...

19
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:55,392
... to have the color
of his skin changed?

20
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:58,395
Who among us would then be content...

21
00:04:58,603 --> 00:05:01,800
... with the counsels
of patience and delay?

22
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:04,932
One hundred years
of delay have passed...

23
00:05:05,143 --> 00:05:07,737
...since President Lincoln
freed the slaves...

24
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:12,616
... yet their heirs, their grandsons
are not fully free.

25
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:15,817
They are not yet freed
from the bonds of injustice.

26
00:05:16,154 --> 00:05:19,487
They are not yet freed
from social and economic oppression.

27
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:21,591
That looks like a police car.

28
00:05:22,026 --> 00:05:25,826
And this nation, for all
its hopes and all its boasts...

29
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,693
... will not be fully free
until all its citizens are free.

30
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:33,963
We preach freedom
around the world and we mean it.

31
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:36,504
And we cherish our freedom
here at home.

32
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,300
Are we to say to the world...

33
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,035
...and much more importantly,
to each other...

34
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:44,682
... that this is a land of the free,
except for the Negroes?

35
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,484
That we have no second-class citizens,
except Negroes?

36
00:05:48,786 --> 00:05:51,254
That we have no class
or caste system...

37
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:55,722
...no ghettos, no master race,
except with respect to Negroes?

38
00:05:56,361 --> 00:06:00,388
Now the time has come for
this nation to fulfill its promise.

39
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:02,800
The events in Birmingham
and elsewhere...

40
00:06:03,368 --> 00:06:07,202
...have so increased the cries
for equality that no city...

41
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:11,303
...or state or legislative body
can prudently choose...

42
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:12,771
... to ignore them.

43
00:06:12,977 --> 00:06:14,911
The fires of frustration
and discord...

44
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:18,571
...are burning in every city,
North and South...

45
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:21,374
... where legal remedies
are not at hand.

46
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:23,918
Redress is sought in the streets.

47
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:27,422
We face a moral crisis
as a country and a people.

48
00:06:28,326 --> 00:06:31,386
It cannot be met
by repressive police action.

49
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:34,755
It is a time to act
in the Congress...

50
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:38,059
...in your state
and local legislative body...

51
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:41,761
...and above all,
in all of our daily lives.

52
00:06:41,973 --> 00:06:44,134
A great change is at hand...

53
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,706
...and our task...

54
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,175
...our obligation is to make
that revolution, that change...

55
00:06:49,747 --> 00:06:52,045
...peaceful and constructive for all.

56
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,649
Those who do nothing...

57
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:56,954
...are inviting shame
as well as violence.

58
00:06:57,555 --> 00:07:00,149
Those who act boldly
are recognizing right...

59
00:07:01,426 --> 00:07:02,893
...as well as reality.

60
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:05,058
Medgar!

61
00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:06,992
-Get down!
-Get the baby!

62
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:12,564
Medgar!

63
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:23,808
Oh, my God!

64
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:29,483
Daddy! Daddy!

65
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:31,211
Daddy, I love you!

66
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:36,188
Daddy, don't die!

67
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:39,326
I want my daddy!

68
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:46,064
Turn me loose.

69
00:07:46,804 --> 00:07:48,396
Turn me loose.

70
00:07:55,446 --> 00:07:59,473
Medgar Evers believed in this country.

71
00:08:00,284 --> 00:08:04,311
It now remains to be seen
whether his country believed in him.

72
00:08:21,873 --> 00:08:24,603
The Citizens Council's raised
thousands for your defense.

73
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:26,936
Money's pouring in
from all over the South.

74
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:29,613
Nice likeness.
What do you think, boys?

75
00:08:29,814 --> 00:08:31,577
Mr. Beckwith, glad to see you.

76
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:33,774
Mighty glad to be here.

77
00:08:34,452 --> 00:08:36,920
And isn't it true
your husband was the first...

78
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:40,022
...to attempt to integrate
the University of Mississippi?

79
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,287
At the time of his death,
he was involved in a lawsuit...

80
00:08:44,495 --> 00:08:47,362
...to integrate the public
school system, wasn't he?

81
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,265
Your husband must've had quite
a few enemies, would you agree?

82
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,767
Yes, he did.

83
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:57,202
Your eldest boy,
his name is Kenyatta, isn't it?

84
00:08:57,475 --> 00:08:59,739
Darrell Kenyatta Evers.

85
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:02,079
Kenyatta's a Mau Mau name, isn't it?

86
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,269
Objection.

87
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:04,675
Sustained.

88
00:09:04,882 --> 00:09:09,046
Isn't it true that over 100 people
were arrested during a demonstration...

89
00:09:09,253 --> 00:09:11,448
...that your husband
organized boycotting...

90
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:15,551
...a department store in downtown
Jackson known as Kennington's?

91
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:17,158
Who's that?

92
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:19,057
Ross Barnett.

93
00:09:19,263 --> 00:09:20,730
You're kidding.

94
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:24,358
Nope. You don't see that
every day of the week.

95
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:28,505
A former governor shaking hands
with an assassin in front of the jury.

96
00:09:28,706 --> 00:09:31,869
There's not a court in America
that would stand for that.

97
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:34,203
What's America got to do
with anything?

98
00:09:34,412 --> 00:09:36,073
This is Mississippi.

99
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:38,515
Byron De La Beckwith.

100
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,578
-You live in Greenwood, Mississippi?
-Y es, sir.

101
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:43,720
My mother was a Yerger.

102
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:45,786
Her mother was Susan Yerger...

103
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,982
...a close personal friend
of Mrs. Jefferson Davis.

104
00:09:49,193 --> 00:09:50,888
You shoot Medgar Evers?

105
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:52,255
No, sir!

106
00:09:53,297 --> 00:09:55,197
Your Honor, may l?

107
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,366
Mr. Beckwith, is this your rifle?

108
00:09:59,137 --> 00:10:00,035
Let's see.

109
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,771
Well, it bears a similarity...

110
00:10:05,977 --> 00:10:08,070
...but I couldn't say for certain.

111
00:10:08,312 --> 00:10:11,042
I don't record the
serial numbers of my weapons...

112
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:15,879
...and my gun was stolen
from my home several days before...

113
00:10:16,154 --> 00:10:17,678
...this whole business.

114
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:50,014
How do you feel, Delay?

115
00:10:50,254 --> 00:10:52,745
I got tears in my eyes.

116
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,287
For Dixie, huh?

117
00:11:14,812 --> 00:11:15,938
In summation...

118
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:19,514
...not only did surveillance cameras
provide us with a visual record...

119
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:21,580
...of the crime being committed...

120
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:26,189
...but four eyewitnesses observed
the defendant removing his mask...

121
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,881
...upon exiting the convenience store.

122
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,989
Short of you ladies and gentlemen
attending the actual event...

123
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:36,462
...we don't feel the state
could have a stronger case.

124
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:37,531
Thank you.

125
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:39,695
Counsel?

126
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,373
Hey, Bobby. How'd it go?

127
00:11:43,674 --> 00:11:46,336
Through a combination
of superior lawyering...

128
00:11:46,544 --> 00:11:50,708
...and a less than stellar performance
by our criminal, I got a conviction.

129
00:11:50,915 --> 00:11:52,007
Congratulations.

130
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,482
My rape victim's reluctant to testify.
Can you handle the Harrison motion?

131
00:11:56,687 --> 00:11:58,279
-You bet.
-You're a lifesaver.

132
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:01,458
-DeLaughter, your wife just called.
-What'd she want?

133
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:05,993
To remind you you're having lunch with
her mother and your parents at 1:00.

134
00:12:06,197 --> 00:12:07,994
How could I forget?

135
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:09,324
Bobby.

136
00:12:11,702 --> 00:12:14,136
-You seen this?
-Yes, I have.

137
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:17,796
Evers' widow is calling for
the re-prosecution of De La Beckwith.

138
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:20,443
Ed, this guy was killed
over 25 years ago.

139
00:12:20,945 --> 00:12:24,676
Dig up whatever you can on Medgar Evers
and be in my office at 3:00.

140
00:12:24,882 --> 00:12:26,372
Ed, this is ridiculous.

141
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:27,642
Well, sure it is.

142
00:12:27,852 --> 00:12:29,149
But if we try to bury this...

143
00:12:29,353 --> 00:12:32,447
...she'll have every black politician
climbing all over me.

144
00:12:33,324 --> 00:12:35,451
My office, 3:00.

145
00:12:45,469 --> 00:12:47,903
Do we have any files here
on Medgar Evers?

146
00:12:48,105 --> 00:12:48,935
Who?

147
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,871
The civil rights leader
that got himself shot in the 1960s?

148
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:57,343
I just saw that file. It was next
to the one on the Lindbergh baby.

149
00:12:57,715 --> 00:13:00,149
Clara, just bring me what we have.

150
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:12,126
Good afternoon, sir.

151
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,404
Did you make Hinds County safer today?

152
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:29,739
You know how it is with criminals.
It's like finding a gray hair.

153
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:32,643
You pull one and two more pop up
to take its place.

154
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:36,113
I love those earrings.
Have you worn them before?

155
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,450
I've had them for quite some time.
I just never wear them during the day.

156
00:13:40,658 --> 00:13:43,855
You see that nonsense
about the Sovereignty Commission?

157
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:45,756
Yeah, isn't that awful?

158
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,529
That fool, Rea Hederman.
Since he took over that paper...

159
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:53,101
...Iiberals like Jerry Mitchell
been trying to rewrite history.

160
00:13:53,537 --> 00:13:57,997
The Sovereignty Commission was a fine
organization that did a lot of good.

161
00:13:58,275 --> 00:14:00,505
Dixie, would you pass me the butter?

162
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:04,179
Why do they dig up things
that happened 25 years ago anyway?

163
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:07,180
Medgar Evers' widow
wants to reopen the case.

164
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:09,516
You can't be serious.

165
00:14:09,854 --> 00:14:11,788
Ed asked me to look into it.

166
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:17,586
You just tell him, "No, thank you."

167
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:22,164
When will these people get it through
their heads that the '60s are over?

168
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:25,802
The 1860s and the 1960s.

169
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:29,029
I thought they found
that Beckwith fella not guilty.

170
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,073
Actually, there were two hung juries.

171
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,711
The reason I know is because
my late husband, Judge Moore...

172
00:14:36,914 --> 00:14:39,246
...was a spectator
at both those trials.

173
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,949
He'd never miss a day.
And he told me...

174
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:46,815
...that they'd never convict Beckwith,
no matter how many trials they had.

175
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:50,525
It's just political. I don't
think anything will come of it.

176
00:14:50,728 --> 00:14:53,128
Son, for your sake,
it had better not.

177
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,195
You want to be a judge someday.

178
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:59,267
You persecute a 70-year-old man,
guilty or not, over some nigger...

179
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,928
...you'll have everybody in Mississippi
lined up against you.

180
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,732
-Hey, Howard.
-How you doing?

181
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:07,570
Y'all got any
of that crawdad chowder today?

182
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:08,972
Yes, sir.

183
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,013
-How many for crawdad chowder?
-Oh, come on!

184
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:17,448
Mrs. Evers, Mr. Dees, I'm Jerry Mitchell
from The Clarion-Ledger.

185
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:20,647
I broke the story on the jury
tampering in your husband's case.

186
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:23,391
-I talked to you on the phone.
-That's right.

187
00:15:23,594 --> 00:15:27,792
Thank you for your good work. I can't
tell you how much it's appreciated.

188
00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:29,761
I'm just doing my job, ma'am.

189
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:33,960
What do you think your chances are
of getting the D.A. to reopen the case?

190
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:36,162
I've passed this way before.

191
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:40,366
Let's just say I've adopted
an attitude of tempered optimism.

192
00:15:43,848 --> 00:15:45,475
DeLaughter, hear the news?

193
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:47,844
President Lincoln just got shot.

194
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:50,316
Some guy named Booth did it.

195
00:15:51,822 --> 00:15:55,781
The Sovereignty Commission, a state
agency, worked against the D.A...

196
00:15:55,993 --> 00:15:59,986
...to ensure the jury had Beckwith
sympathizers to keep him out of jail.

197
00:16:00,197 --> 00:16:02,358
That's grounds for a new trial.

198
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:03,658
With all due respect...

199
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:07,201
...those old files have been
leaking out for years.

200
00:16:07,404 --> 00:16:11,636
They only ran background checks which,
while unethical, was not illegal.

201
00:16:11,842 --> 00:16:16,074
We can't prove jury tampering.
I'd like you to meet Bob DeLaughter.

202
00:16:16,547 --> 00:16:17,377
How do you do?

203
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:19,648
-Pleasure.
-Mr. Morris Dees...

204
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,374
...the Southern Poverty Law Center.

205
00:16:21,619 --> 00:16:23,314
-How you doing?
-I was explaining...

206
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:25,318
...that in order for us
to pursue this...

207
00:16:25,523 --> 00:16:27,991
...we'll need more
than an article in a newspaper.

208
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:29,557
We'll need new evidence.

209
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,660
In 1964, you had
a mountain of evidence.

210
00:16:31,862 --> 00:16:33,659
All you gotta do is retry Beckwith.

211
00:16:33,864 --> 00:16:36,389
On the basis of that alone,
you'll get a conviction.

212
00:16:37,668 --> 00:16:40,899
As you can see, the mountain
has crumbled a bit.

213
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,028
What's this?

214
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,937
That's all that's left of the
state's case against De La Beckwith.

215
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:50,079
Just a few pages
of the old police report.

216
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:53,079
-Where's the gun? Where--
-Where's the bullet?

217
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,184
Where's the original trial transcript?
Where are the files? Beats me.

218
00:16:58,822 --> 00:17:00,619
Are you telling us it is lost?

219
00:17:00,824 --> 00:17:02,689
I'm telling you, we don't have it.

220
00:17:02,993 --> 00:17:04,221
Well, that's outrageous.

221
00:17:05,062 --> 00:17:07,963
Even if we had the evidence,
we'd never get around...

222
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:11,362
...to the Sixth Amendment right
to a speedy trial.

223
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,562
Mr. Dees would agree that 25 years
isn't exactly what you'd call speedy.

224
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,267
May I see that?

225
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:20,568
Mrs. Evers, this is
pretty strong stuff.

226
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:22,640
I'd like to see it.

227
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,081
"June 13, 1963.

228
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:37,724
To the Jackson Police Department:

229
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:41,930
When you catch whoever killed
the nigger, pin a medal on him...

230
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:46,167
...because he just did Mississippi
one hell of a favor.

231
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:49,933
June 14, 1963.

232
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,973
A female who refused
to identify herself stated...

233
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:56,408
...that she'd heard a rumor
that Medgar Evers' wife...

234
00:17:56,647 --> 00:18:00,583
...had gotten jealous of Lena Horne,
who appeared with Evers at a rally...

235
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:04,345
...and might have gotten
her brother-in-law to kill Evers."

236
00:18:07,024 --> 00:18:10,755
Who wouldn't be jealous of Lena Horne?
What a beautiful woman.

237
00:18:11,795 --> 00:18:13,023
Y es, ma'am.

238
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,826
The cops wrote that garbage down
because they actually took it seriously.

239
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:18,967
Mr. Dees.

240
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:23,700
Do you think the police in Washington,
D.C. would have written it up...

241
00:18:23,907 --> 00:18:27,638
...if some nitwit said Jackie Kennedy
had a hand in J.F.K.'s death...

242
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:30,643
...because her husband ran around
with Marilyn Monroe?

243
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:32,007
What's your point?

244
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:35,276
The murder of Medgar Evers
was a race crime...

245
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:37,511
...a political crime.
An assassination.

246
00:18:37,888 --> 00:18:39,856
Beckwith is free today...

247
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:42,582
...thanks to a racist jury,
a racist police department...

248
00:18:42,793 --> 00:18:44,954
...and a racist D.A.'s office.

249
00:18:45,162 --> 00:18:47,630
Twenty-five years ago,
Waller and this office...

250
00:18:47,831 --> 00:18:49,958
...went after Beckwith
not once but twice.

251
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,226
I don't need to sit here and listen--

252
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:56,201
Twenty-five years ago,
I sat on the witness stand...

253
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:59,638
...and I watched as the former
governor of this state...

254
00:18:59,843 --> 00:19:03,006
...shook hands with the man
who murdered my husband...

255
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:05,509
...while I was on the stand.

256
00:19:08,585 --> 00:19:10,485
I don't expect you to understand...

257
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:13,122
...the pain and suffering
my family went through...

258
00:19:13,324 --> 00:19:14,985
...but I did come here thinking...

259
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:18,889
...that this office might want
to see justice finally served.

260
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:25,435
You've given me all the reasons
why you can't pursue this.

261
00:19:25,636 --> 00:19:28,764
Perhaps you can find
one reason why you can.

262
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:31,203
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

263
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:52,618
Ed Peters is a good man...

264
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,424
...but as you can see,
we simply don't have a case.

265
00:19:55,632 --> 00:19:59,466
I know you've been living
with this thing for a long while...

266
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:02,632
...but maybe it's just time you....

267
00:20:03,707 --> 00:20:04,969
Let it go?

268
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:08,409
I can understand why you'd
think that, Mr. DeLaughter.

269
00:20:08,612 --> 00:20:10,978
For years, I said
the same thing to Medgar.

270
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:13,911
"Let it go.
Let's get out of Mississippi."

271
00:20:14,418 --> 00:20:16,215
Do you know what he said to me?

272
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,311
" I don't know if I'm going
to heaven or to hell...

273
00:20:19,523 --> 00:20:21,650
...but I'm going from Jackson."

274
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:24,056
Good afternoon, Mr. DeLaughter.

275
00:20:56,827 --> 00:20:58,692
Hey, everybody, I'm home.

276
00:21:07,104 --> 00:21:08,298
Hey, tiger.

277
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:10,200
Hi, Dad.

278
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:15,043
You sure you got enough distractions?
I can go get your Game Boy.

279
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:16,772
Dad.

280
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,208
Hi, Daddy.

281
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:19,581
Hi, Dad.

282
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:23,844
-Did you bring me a lollipop?
-I did. I got one for Claire too.

283
00:21:24,054 --> 00:21:27,023
-Thanks, Daddy.
-How was school today, sweetie?

284
00:21:27,224 --> 00:21:29,522
Did Miss Collins like
the bracelet you made?

285
00:21:29,827 --> 00:21:31,556
Daddy, tell us a story.

286
00:21:32,262 --> 00:21:35,129
-A real scary one.
-Claire, you want to hear a story?

287
00:21:35,332 --> 00:21:37,300
Okay, but not too scary.

288
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:41,198
Let's go to Mommy and Daddy's room,
because we don't wanna disturb Burt.

289
00:21:44,575 --> 00:21:48,102
-You want something to eat?
-No, I got something at the office.

290
00:21:49,947 --> 00:21:51,676
Thanks for letting me know.

291
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,016
Honey, what are you doing up?

292
00:22:36,226 --> 00:22:37,693
I can't sleep.

293
00:22:37,895 --> 00:22:39,556
The ghost is back.

294
00:22:39,963 --> 00:22:42,056
I'll go. I'll go.

295
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,101
The ghost is back?
Where is he this time?

296
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:47,270
In my bed.

297
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:50,565
Really? We'll just have
to see about that.

298
00:22:53,977 --> 00:22:56,810
You were right.
He's right there on the bed.

299
00:22:57,514 --> 00:22:58,606
No, Daddy.

300
00:22:58,815 --> 00:23:00,976
Now he's over by the window.

301
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:04,649
I see.

302
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,588
Your bottle tree was
supposed to keep him away.

303
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:11,588
Maybe I don't have
the right kind of bottles.

304
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:13,328
You know, baby...

305
00:23:14,398 --> 00:23:16,832
...when we lived in Natchez,
there was a ghost...

306
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:18,626
...that lived right next door...

307
00:23:18,835 --> 00:23:21,963
...in the remains of this house
that got burned during the war.

308
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:26,307
And sometimes he'd come over
and get right in my closet.

309
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,804
How'd you make him go away?

310
00:23:28,178 --> 00:23:30,578
Granny would come in
and sing a song...

311
00:23:30,781 --> 00:23:32,806
...and before you knew it,
he was gone.

312
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,108
What'd she sing?

313
00:23:35,552 --> 00:23:38,419
She sang the song every ghost
from Mississippi loves.

314
00:23:38,922 --> 00:23:40,014
Sing it, Daddy.

315
00:23:40,524 --> 00:23:41,684
All right.

316
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,188
I wish I was in the land of cotton

317
00:23:46,396 --> 00:23:48,626
Old times there are not forgotten

318
00:23:48,832 --> 00:23:50,129
Look away

319
00:23:50,434 --> 00:23:51,765
Look away

320
00:23:52,035 --> 00:23:55,334
Look away, Dixieland

321
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:57,871
In Dixieland where I was born

322
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,836
Early on one frosty morn'

323
00:24:01,178 --> 00:24:03,806
Look away, look away

324
00:24:04,014 --> 00:24:07,142
Look away, Dixieland

325
00:24:07,718 --> 00:24:09,948
Oh, I wish I was in Dixie

326
00:24:10,153 --> 00:24:12,917
Hooray, hooray

327
00:24:13,123 --> 00:24:15,819
In Dixieland I'll take my stand

328
00:24:16,026 --> 00:24:18,995
To live and die in Dixie

329
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:21,289
Away, away

330
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:24,159
Away down South

331
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:26,432
In Dixie

332
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,772
I'd ask what's new,
but I'm afraid you'd tell me.

333
00:24:32,976 --> 00:24:35,536
My readers are on the edge
of their collective seat.

334
00:24:36,913 --> 00:24:38,380
Will Mr. DeLaughter go after
Byron De La Beckwith?

335
00:24:38,582 --> 00:24:42,985
The D.A.'s office will investigate
the possibility of reopening the case.

336
00:24:43,186 --> 00:24:46,553
I didn't go to law school,
but that sounds like bullshit.

337
00:24:46,757 --> 00:24:47,815
Nice talking to you.

338
00:24:48,025 --> 00:24:49,515
Have a nice day.

339
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:14,517
Can you tell me how I can get
ahold of Lewis Skinner...

340
00:25:14,718 --> 00:25:15,810
...or Fred Sanders?

341
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:20,251
If you want Lewis Skinner, you'll need
a shovel and six hours of digging time.

342
00:25:20,657 --> 00:25:21,783
What's Fred's status?

343
00:25:21,992 --> 00:25:24,722
As far as I know,
he's still aboveground.

344
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:28,888
Back in '63,
none of those houses were there.

345
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:31,090
That was all vacant lot.

346
00:25:31,301 --> 00:25:34,236
And this here was
all covered over with brush.

347
00:25:34,471 --> 00:25:37,531
I got out here eight minutes
after the call came in.

348
00:25:37,741 --> 00:25:41,973
The way Mrs. Evers yelled at me,
you'd think I was the one who done it.

349
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,412
This is where they found the gun,
hidden in some honeysuckle vines.

350
00:25:47,884 --> 00:25:49,943
Any idea where
that gun might be today?

351
00:25:50,153 --> 00:25:51,211
Hell, no.

352
00:25:51,421 --> 00:25:52,513
Back in those days...

353
00:25:52,723 --> 00:25:56,318
...evidence had a habit
of disappearing after the trials.

354
00:25:56,793 --> 00:25:57,919
Look at that.

355
00:25:58,128 --> 00:26:01,256
My grandmother could have
picked Evers off from over here.

356
00:26:01,465 --> 00:26:03,365
That's where he was shot.

357
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:06,092
That big tree wasn't there
at the time.

358
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:07,960
There was blood everywhere.

359
00:26:08,171 --> 00:26:11,072
All over the driveway,
all over the car.

360
00:26:11,274 --> 00:26:13,640
It was as if somebody
had butchered a hog.

361
00:26:13,877 --> 00:26:18,610
But Evers must've been one hell of a
strong man because somehow he managed...

362
00:26:18,815 --> 00:26:21,147
...to drag himself
all the way up to his door.

363
00:26:21,485 --> 00:26:25,478
After that bullet tore through his back,
it slammed through that window...

364
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:27,156
...crashed through a wall...

365
00:26:27,357 --> 00:26:31,225
...ricocheted off the refrigerator
and busted the coffeepot.

366
00:26:31,428 --> 00:26:35,524
We found it on the kitchen counter
next to a watermelon.

367
00:26:36,867 --> 00:26:37,959
You're kidding me.

368
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:39,596
No, sir.

369
00:26:44,574 --> 00:26:45,939
Did he have any kids?

370
00:26:46,143 --> 00:26:50,477
If my memory serves, I believe there
were three little ones there that night.

371
00:26:54,885 --> 00:26:59,447
What kind of man shoots another man
in the back in front of his family?

372
00:27:00,624 --> 00:27:03,149
I love the land of my birth.

373
00:27:03,927 --> 00:27:06,521
I do not mean
just America as a country...

374
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:08,287
...but Mississippi...

375
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:10,159
... the state in which I was born.

376
00:27:11,268 --> 00:27:14,294
So the deplorable things
I speak of here today...

377
00:27:14,538 --> 00:27:16,836
... will be said to you
in hopes of a future...

378
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:20,838
... where such will not
be the case in Mississippi.

379
00:27:21,044 --> 00:27:22,807
In the horrific deaths...

380
00:27:23,013 --> 00:27:24,503
...of Emmett Till...

381
00:27:24,881 --> 00:27:27,076
...Reverend G. W. Lee...

382
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,180
...Lamar Smith and a variety
of other atrocities...

383
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:32,821
...no one has been convicted.

384
00:27:33,423 --> 00:27:38,190
And we feel those guilty of having
committed these ungodly acts...

385
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:41,956
...had the feeling of assurance
that nothing ever would be done.

386
00:27:42,265 --> 00:27:44,529
For you see, ladies and gentlemen...

387
00:27:45,168 --> 00:27:49,400
... white juries have yet to convict
a white man in Mississippi...

388
00:27:49,673 --> 00:27:52,198
...guilty of a crime against a Negro.

389
00:27:52,976 --> 00:27:57,572
The failure of the so-called decent
or moderate white person...

390
00:27:57,781 --> 00:28:01,217
... to take a positive
and uncompromising stand....

391
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:02,680
Who's that?

392
00:28:04,254 --> 00:28:05,619
Medgar Evers.

393
00:28:08,725 --> 00:28:10,352
Why are you looking at it?

394
00:28:12,495 --> 00:28:15,953
I just wanted to get
an idea of who he was.

395
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,366
I'd like to get
an idea of who you are.

396
00:28:20,003 --> 00:28:21,732
What's that supposed to mean?

397
00:28:22,472 --> 00:28:24,940
I was willing to go down
that road with you...

398
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:28,201
...when you got out of law school
and did that pro bono work.

399
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:31,938
And when you worked for
that Jew lawyer who ran you ragged.

400
00:28:32,415 --> 00:28:36,215
I minded a little when you turned down
that offer from Morse & Braggs...

401
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:39,286
...so you could be assistant D.A.
at one-fourth the salary.

402
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:42,856
But I'll be damned if I spent
10 years supporting your career...

403
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:44,458
...just so you can humiliate me.

404
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:47,325
You're gonna pursue this, aren't you?

405
00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:51,391
You're gonna humiliate me
in front of my friends...

406
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:53,694
...my family and the entire state.

407
00:28:53,904 --> 00:28:55,929
I'm just looking
at a couple of tapes.

408
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:59,064
Fine. Look at your tapes.

409
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:01,105
That's all you'd better do.

410
00:29:06,716 --> 00:29:08,274
-Why not?
-Because you can't win.

411
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:09,315
Who says?

412
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:12,419
-The Sixth Amendment.
-Suppose I could get around it.

413
00:29:12,622 --> 00:29:15,887
It's one thing for
the grieving widow to carry on--

414
00:29:16,293 --> 00:29:20,195
Suppose an argument could be made
that the Sixth Amendment doesn't apply.

415
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:21,921
You want to retry Beckwith?

416
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:23,097
Fine.

417
00:29:23,366 --> 00:29:28,167
Dig up 26-year-old physical evidence
which probably no longer exists...

418
00:29:28,605 --> 00:29:32,735
...identify it, and then you'll have
to locate the key witnesses...

419
00:29:32,943 --> 00:29:35,707
...who, if you find them,
are probably dead or senile.

420
00:29:35,912 --> 00:29:38,380
Their testimony could be read
from the transcript.

421
00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:42,278
We haven't seen a certified
transcript in over 25 years.

422
00:29:42,485 --> 00:29:45,010
-What if I found one?
-Let's say, by some miracle...

423
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:48,782
...you found one, got an indictment.
Then by some greater miracle...

424
00:29:48,992 --> 00:29:53,156
...the state Supreme Court and U.S.
Supreme Court didn't throw it out...

425
00:29:53,363 --> 00:29:56,025
...and you actually got to trial.
What if you lose?

426
00:29:56,232 --> 00:30:00,168
The whole state, which is supposed
to have changed so much...

427
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,066
...will be facing the worst
public relations disaster...

428
00:30:03,273 --> 00:30:06,538
...since that black kid, Emmett Till,
bobbed up out of the river.

429
00:30:12,182 --> 00:30:14,412
Are you telling me
I can't go after this?

430
00:30:14,617 --> 00:30:16,847
I'm telling you
you're dealing with the past.

431
00:30:17,053 --> 00:30:19,487
Mississippi's not
a place you wanna be.

432
00:30:24,194 --> 00:30:27,322
Hopefully, Jerry Mitchell can
keep this thing alive for us.

433
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:30,761
Jerry Mitchell's fine, but
what we need is national press.

434
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:35,529
Darrell, CNN won't run a major story
about how the D.A. of Hinds County...

435
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:38,708
...is refusing to re-prosecute a case...

436
00:30:38,908 --> 00:30:40,899
...that's a quarter of a century old.

437
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:43,671
Stop annoying your grandmama.

438
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,078
The greatest joy in your mother's life
is being annoyed by her grandchildren.

439
00:30:48,284 --> 00:30:50,718
Next to being annoyed by you, Walter.

440
00:30:51,454 --> 00:30:52,421
I'll get it.

441
00:30:52,622 --> 00:30:54,681
I'm not here no matter who it is.

442
00:31:00,964 --> 00:31:01,988
Who?

443
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,663
Just a minute, please.

444
00:31:06,503 --> 00:31:08,198
I want you to eat those beans.

445
00:31:08,405 --> 00:31:10,100
It's long distance from Jackson.

446
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,241
A man by the name of DeLaughter.
You want me to take it?

447
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:15,308
No, I'll take it.

448
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:17,273
Eat those beans.

449
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:19,948
I don't eat beans.

450
00:31:25,221 --> 00:31:26,381
Hello, Mrs. Evers.

451
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:29,820
I know you probably left here
feeling pretty discouraged...

452
00:31:30,026 --> 00:31:33,393
...but I hope you understand
Mr. Peters was just being realistic.

453
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:35,257
I understand perfectly.

454
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:36,830
I also wanted you to know...

455
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:39,866
...that we are going to
be keeping this case open.

456
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:43,932
Mrs. Evers?

457
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,303
Did it suddenly occur to
Mr. Peters that he'd better...

458
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:51,446
...start making nice with the
black community before November?

459
00:31:52,015 --> 00:31:54,176
-Mrs. Evers--
-He made it clear to me...

460
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:57,614
...that in addition to having
no evidence and no witnesses...

461
00:31:57,821 --> 00:31:59,482
...he also had no interest.

462
00:31:59,722 --> 00:32:03,954
Looking into this wasn't so much
Mr. Peter's idea as it was mine.

463
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,321
-Yours?
-Yes, ma'am.

464
00:32:08,898 --> 00:32:12,493
Judge Russel Moore was perhaps
the most racist judge...

465
00:32:12,702 --> 00:32:14,966
...in the history
of the state of Mississippi.

466
00:32:15,171 --> 00:32:18,106
Why would his son-in-law
be interested in this case?

467
00:32:18,374 --> 00:32:22,140
Mrs. Evers, I'm 37 years old,
just like Medgar was...

468
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:24,677
...and I've got three kids,
like he did.

469
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:27,675
I was 11 years old
when your husband was killed...

470
00:32:27,884 --> 00:32:30,011
...and I hardly remember him at all.

471
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,184
But I went by your house the other day
and I could see him there...

472
00:32:36,025 --> 00:32:37,856
...watering his lawn...

473
00:32:38,428 --> 00:32:40,191
... working on his roof...

474
00:32:40,997 --> 00:32:42,931
...playing with his children.

475
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,593
No man has the right to take
another man away from his children.

476
00:32:49,372 --> 00:32:52,034
I appreciate the call,
Mr. DeLaughter.

477
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:54,609
I'll keep in touch, Mrs. Evers.

478
00:33:00,216 --> 00:33:01,911
Did you plan on telling me...

479
00:33:02,452 --> 00:33:05,114
...or was I just gonna read
about it in the papers?

480
00:33:07,223 --> 00:33:10,056
We should be at the
Walkers' house in 15 minutes.

481
00:33:11,561 --> 00:33:14,291
Well, I've got a lot
of work to do here.

482
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:19,766
Suit yourself.

483
00:33:24,874 --> 00:33:27,775
Nobody gives a goddamn
what Byron De La Beckwith did...

484
00:33:27,977 --> 00:33:30,241
...to some Medgar Evers 26 years ago.

485
00:33:30,446 --> 00:33:34,314
Hell, Larry Smith got shot down
in his own driveway just last week.

486
00:33:34,617 --> 00:33:36,380
And it wasn't for no civil rights.

487
00:33:36,586 --> 00:33:38,383
It was for his spare change.

488
00:33:38,588 --> 00:33:42,615
I could have had any investigator
I wanted, and I asked for you.

489
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:44,793
Am I meant to be flattered by that?

490
00:33:44,994 --> 00:33:49,727
We're supposed to nail Eddie Williams
for killing Wendell Washington...

491
00:33:49,933 --> 00:33:52,766
...or that guy Pierson
for shooting Donny Brown.

492
00:33:52,969 --> 00:33:57,133
That's why we're only gonna work
on this case in our spare time.

493
00:34:15,825 --> 00:34:16,655
Holy shit.

494
00:34:17,827 --> 00:34:18,953
Will you look at this?

495
00:34:19,195 --> 00:34:23,723
You could buy a whole damn General
Electric refrigerator for $185.

496
00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:27,830
T alk about your good old days.

497
00:34:45,722 --> 00:34:46,780
That's my daddy.

498
00:34:49,092 --> 00:34:51,424
I didn't know he was on the force too.

499
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:54,494
Sure. Detective L.C. Bennett.

500
00:34:54,998 --> 00:34:59,332
He was there when they found Beckwith's
rifle, but I've never seen this.

501
00:34:59,535 --> 00:35:01,230
John Goza is dead.

502
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:02,961
Herbert Speight is dead.

503
00:35:03,406 --> 00:35:06,102
B.L. Pittman is dead.

504
00:35:06,342 --> 00:35:07,707
Is anybody alive?

505
00:35:07,944 --> 00:35:09,434
This is pointless.

506
00:35:12,215 --> 00:35:13,682
It's Jerry Mitchell.

507
00:35:15,518 --> 00:35:16,450
Jerry.

508
00:35:17,387 --> 00:35:19,014
I don't have the gun yet.

509
00:35:19,222 --> 00:35:23,158
I don't have anything. If I find
the gun, you'll be the first to know.

510
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,828
-Pain in my ass.
-It's funny.

511
00:35:26,062 --> 00:35:29,088
I came by to see if you could
use some help on this case...

512
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:31,529
...and you've got a picture of my daddy.

513
00:35:31,734 --> 00:35:33,497
We sure could use some help.

514
00:35:33,703 --> 00:35:35,796
Can you bring people
back from the dead?

515
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:40,333
You're joking, but that's
exactly what we have to do.

516
00:35:40,543 --> 00:35:43,011
We have to make the past
start living again.

517
00:35:43,212 --> 00:35:45,407
This whole case is one big resurrection.

518
00:35:45,615 --> 00:35:48,015
I want you to go through
all the literature...

519
00:35:48,217 --> 00:35:50,515
...from every organization
Beckwith was part of:

520
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,679
White Citizens Council,
Sons of the American Revolution, KKK.

521
00:35:54,924 --> 00:35:56,824
Good, I always loved homework.

522
00:35:57,026 --> 00:35:59,961
We'll start by paying
these boys a little visit.

523
00:36:00,163 --> 00:36:01,460
-Who's that?
-Two cops.

524
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:05,430
They saw Beckwith 90 miles away
at the time of the murder.

525
00:36:05,668 --> 00:36:09,160
You think Holley and Cresswell
will admit they lied under oath?

526
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,740
Time has a way of cleaning up
people's memories.

527
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:22,008
I love the Delta.

528
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:24,412
It's the best place on earth.

529
00:36:25,888 --> 00:36:27,185
If you're a mosquito.

530
00:36:32,295 --> 00:36:34,593
-T ake care now.
-Thank you, Mr. Holley.

531
00:36:36,265 --> 00:36:39,234
Sometimes you can't win for losing.

532
00:36:39,502 --> 00:36:42,369
I asked you boys
to meet me out here...

533
00:36:42,572 --> 00:36:46,804
...so as to avoid running
into any of my constituents.

534
00:36:47,777 --> 00:36:50,905
How long have you been
an alderman up here, Mr. Holley?

535
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,646
Must be going on about five years.

536
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,210
I'll tell you this:

537
00:36:55,418 --> 00:36:59,878
If word got out that I testified
on behalf of Byron De La Beckwith....

538
00:37:00,256 --> 00:37:03,783
I suppose, in a way, your boss
and me got the same problem.

539
00:37:03,993 --> 00:37:04,960
Sir?

540
00:37:05,228 --> 00:37:06,889
If we want to keep our jobs...

541
00:37:07,096 --> 00:37:09,894
...we'll have to kiss
an awful lot of black behind.

542
00:37:13,403 --> 00:37:14,802
Mr. Holley...

543
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:19,468
...Evers was killed shortly after
midnight, 90 miles away in Jackson.

544
00:37:19,675 --> 00:37:22,007
There's no way the killer
could have been here...

545
00:37:22,245 --> 00:37:24,213
...at 1 a.m. pumping gas.

546
00:37:24,514 --> 00:37:27,108
No, sir, that'd be impossible.

547
00:37:27,316 --> 00:37:31,810
It was a long while ago, but I'd like
you to think back and tell me...

548
00:37:32,021 --> 00:37:33,818
...are you sure about the time...

549
00:37:34,023 --> 00:37:36,423
...you saw Mr. Beckwith
at that gas station?

550
00:37:36,826 --> 00:37:38,657
This old memory of mine...

551
00:37:38,861 --> 00:37:42,228
...gets worse and worse
with each passing year...

552
00:37:42,432 --> 00:37:45,060
...but there's two things
I am pretty sure about:

553
00:37:45,268 --> 00:37:47,896
It was approximately 1:03
in the morning...

554
00:37:48,104 --> 00:37:51,335
...and old Delay was gassing up
that Valiant of his.

555
00:37:53,276 --> 00:37:55,176
Lying son of a bitch.

556
00:37:55,445 --> 00:37:57,640
You thought you'd hear
something different?

557
00:37:57,847 --> 00:38:00,372
Maybe we'll have better luck
with his partner.

558
00:38:01,284 --> 00:38:03,149
Y'all wanna subpoena me...

559
00:38:03,352 --> 00:38:05,411
...then you go right ahead and do it.

560
00:38:05,688 --> 00:38:09,283
But if I see you,
Byron De La Beckwith...

561
00:38:09,492 --> 00:38:12,017
...or the blackest nigger
in this country...

562
00:38:12,228 --> 00:38:14,992
...putting gas in his car
at the time of a murder...

563
00:38:15,198 --> 00:38:17,029
...then that's what I'll say.

564
00:38:18,201 --> 00:38:20,066
I'd say he's in our camp.

565
00:38:28,544 --> 00:38:30,671
I wish I had better news
for her today.

566
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,142
Who's that?

567
00:38:32,782 --> 00:38:34,044
Mrs. Evers.

568
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,518
Fill it up for me, would you, buddy?

569
00:38:36,853 --> 00:38:40,619
I call her every Friday and let her
know how the case is progressing.

570
00:38:40,857 --> 00:38:43,724
Got a flash for you.
This case ain't progressing.

571
00:38:44,227 --> 00:38:47,719
I think about her keeping
this thing alive all this time.

572
00:38:48,464 --> 00:38:51,558
Imagine a woman loving a man so much.

573
00:38:54,003 --> 00:38:56,995
I can't even get a woman
to love me while I'm still alive.

574
00:38:57,206 --> 00:38:59,106
Know what I did after my last divorce?

575
00:38:59,342 --> 00:39:00,934
I took up golf.

576
00:39:01,143 --> 00:39:05,307
Man needs a hobby to occupy his mind,
or he'll start doing crazy things...

577
00:39:05,581 --> 00:39:07,242
...Iike drinking too much...

578
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:11,352
...or chasing 26-year-old murder cases
across the Mississippi Delta.

579
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:22,391
I told you I'd call you every Friday.

580
00:39:22,598 --> 00:39:25,795
And it's Friday, Mrs. Evers,
so I'm calling.

581
00:39:26,035 --> 00:39:28,799
This really isn't necessary.

582
00:39:29,038 --> 00:39:32,337
It's important to me you know
we're doing what we can.

583
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:34,533
I wish I had better news
for you today...

584
00:39:34,744 --> 00:39:38,202
...but we still haven't been able
to locate the autopsy report.

585
00:39:38,414 --> 00:39:40,644
Most of the physical evidence
is still missing.

586
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:44,249
A number of the witnesses have died,
which really hurts us...

587
00:39:44,453 --> 00:39:48,355
...and we've had no luck finding
the original trial transcript.

588
00:39:48,558 --> 00:39:51,527
I've just spoke with
both Holley and Cresswell...

589
00:39:51,727 --> 00:39:53,422
...and they're sticking
by their stories.

590
00:39:54,096 --> 00:39:58,965
I'm sure as the assistant
district attorney of Hinds County...

591
00:39:59,168 --> 00:40:01,432
...you're doing everything
in your power...

592
00:40:01,637 --> 00:40:03,628
...to see that justice is done.

593
00:40:09,478 --> 00:40:10,843
I'll call you next Friday.

594
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:13,943
I'll be on pins and needles till then.

595
00:41:25,554 --> 00:41:27,545
I waited for you to come home.

596
00:41:30,593 --> 00:41:32,993
I'm not taking the children with me.

597
00:41:35,197 --> 00:41:38,166
I just need to be
on my own for a while.

598
00:41:55,484 --> 00:41:58,544
I was just wondering
when we stopped loving each other.

599
00:42:01,057 --> 00:42:02,354
I don't know.

600
00:42:06,696 --> 00:42:08,254
What happened, Bobby?

601
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:12,925
People change.

602
00:42:15,271 --> 00:42:17,205
You saying I've changed?

603
00:42:19,008 --> 00:42:21,203
I'm saying you haven't.

604
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:41,157
-It's a beautiful area, Mr. Beckwith.
-It's heaven on earth.

605
00:42:41,363 --> 00:42:43,593
Of course, like everywhere else...

606
00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:47,027
... we do get the occasional
stray nigger moving in.

607
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:50,038
But their houses always
seem to burn down.

608
00:42:50,272 --> 00:42:53,730
You know how careless niggers are
with their cigarettes.

609
00:42:54,844 --> 00:42:56,835
A real beauty.

610
00:42:57,046 --> 00:43:00,174
-Where'd you get this?
-Ed Bryson at Channel 3.

611
00:43:00,382 --> 00:43:02,577
They're running a piece on Beckwith.

612
00:43:02,785 --> 00:43:03,752
Do you think...

613
00:43:03,986 --> 00:43:07,217
...it's a crime for a white man
to kill a black man?

614
00:43:07,423 --> 00:43:11,655
God put the white man here
to rule over all the dusky races.

615
00:43:11,861 --> 00:43:13,795
It says so in the Bible.

616
00:43:13,996 --> 00:43:15,429
Is there a chance...

617
00:43:15,664 --> 00:43:19,122
... you'd be indicted again
for the murder of Medgar Evers?

618
00:43:19,335 --> 00:43:23,237
Why would I be?
Do you know of any new evidence?

619
00:43:23,439 --> 00:43:24,599
-Are you a Jew?
-Catholic.

620
00:43:24,807 --> 00:43:27,071
I told you, I won't talk to no Jew.

621
00:43:27,276 --> 00:43:30,074
Anybody who knows anything
about Jews and niggers...

622
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:33,373
...knows that Jews put the niggers
up to all this foolishness.

623
00:43:33,616 --> 00:43:37,916
This CORE and SNCC and NAACP.

624
00:43:38,187 --> 00:43:39,654
If you were indicted again?

625
00:43:40,055 --> 00:43:43,081
Well, I'm just gonna
tend to my business...

626
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,917
...Iike I always have.

627
00:43:45,194 --> 00:43:48,652
I'm gonna look out
for my God, my family...

628
00:43:48,864 --> 00:43:51,264
...and the whole state
of Christ's church.

629
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:54,331
That don't encompass anybody
but white Christians.

630
00:43:54,537 --> 00:43:56,164
All these other...

631
00:43:56,372 --> 00:43:59,535
...races and colors
and creeds and sissies...

632
00:43:59,742 --> 00:44:02,836
... they are anti-Christs.
See, many of them...

633
00:44:03,045 --> 00:44:06,173
...believe in human sacrifices
and voodoo and such.

634
00:44:06,382 --> 00:44:09,078
According to your way
of thinking...

635
00:44:09,318 --> 00:44:12,219
...how could justice be done
in the Medgar Evers murder?

636
00:44:14,123 --> 00:44:16,353
First, find out
who killed the nigger.

637
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:18,186
Then you just...

638
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,122
...do whatever the law says
that you can do...

639
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:23,696
...if you're big enough to do it.

640
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:26,392
He's daring us to get him.

641
00:44:27,102 --> 00:44:29,866
-We still ain't got nothing.
-I know what you'll say.

642
00:44:30,573 --> 00:44:32,973
-Did I kill Medgar Evers?
-Did you?

643
00:44:33,242 --> 00:44:34,869
I did not kill him.

644
00:44:35,878 --> 00:44:38,039
But he sure is dead.

645
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,846
And he ain't coming back.

646
00:44:41,784 --> 00:44:44,344
What did you think when
you heard he'd been killed?

647
00:44:44,653 --> 00:44:46,621
I didn't shed a tear.

648
00:44:46,822 --> 00:44:47,846
No, sir.

649
00:44:52,695 --> 00:44:56,722
Here. The latest literary efforts
from the "Hate Group of the Month" Club.

650
00:44:57,266 --> 00:44:59,291
For people who got one thing
on their minds...

651
00:44:59,501 --> 00:45:02,197
...they got a lot of ways
to tell you about it.

652
00:45:03,772 --> 00:45:06,969
I wonder what old Judge Moore
would think about all this.

653
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:09,370
Dixie still living with her mom?

654
00:45:11,146 --> 00:45:12,579
Shit, I'm late!

655
00:45:13,048 --> 00:45:15,039
Hot off the presses. Armed robbery.

656
00:45:15,384 --> 00:45:19,150
A guy named Spratlin held up
Crechelle's, got away with $3800...

657
00:45:19,421 --> 00:45:22,049
-...and an order of onion rings.
-I'll take care of it.

658
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:23,758
Where you going?

659
00:45:23,959 --> 00:45:26,587
-I said I'd be home by 6.
-What about the Owens case?

660
00:45:26,896 --> 00:45:29,558
-The assault with the baseball bat.
-No, the carjacking.

661
00:45:29,765 --> 00:45:31,528
Right. I'm on top of it.

662
00:45:31,734 --> 00:45:34,294
You want this Evers thing
to be your life's work...

663
00:45:34,503 --> 00:45:36,437
...but there's cases that
occurred in this decade.

664
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,731
I promise.

665
00:45:37,973 --> 00:45:40,840
This office can't keep covering
for you with the judges.

666
00:45:41,076 --> 00:45:43,738
-You'd best be in court tomorrow.
-I'll be there.

667
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:51,745
Daddy...

668
00:45:52,254 --> 00:45:55,451
...how come Grandpa Russel
would be mad at you?

669
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:01,086
Mommy said Grandpa Russel
would be mad at you.

670
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:04,130
Great. What else did Mommy say?

671
00:46:04,366 --> 00:46:07,665
She said that you're doing something
that Grandpa won't like.

672
00:46:08,771 --> 00:46:10,170
Yeah, well....

673
00:46:11,407 --> 00:46:12,931
What are you doing?

674
00:46:22,851 --> 00:46:25,877
Grandpa Russel and I didn't
always agree on things.

675
00:46:26,255 --> 00:46:27,449
What things?

676
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:31,652
Let's see, how can I explain this?

677
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:35,961
Explain it.

678
00:46:36,899 --> 00:46:38,025
Right.

679
00:46:38,701 --> 00:46:42,034
You know how sometimes
people can just be different?

680
00:46:42,304 --> 00:46:43,498
Like how?

681
00:46:43,706 --> 00:46:45,799
Grandpa used to eat pig's knuckles.

682
00:46:46,775 --> 00:46:49,107
That's how I feel.
See, we're different.

683
00:46:49,311 --> 00:46:51,336
Grandpa used to like to build things.

684
00:46:51,547 --> 00:46:55,108
I can't build anything,
but I like to work in the garden.

685
00:46:55,351 --> 00:46:59,082
Grandpa had guns all over his house,
and we don't have any guns.

686
00:46:59,655 --> 00:47:00,644
I have a gun.

687
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:03,323
Yours is a nuclear-powered laser gun.

688
00:47:03,525 --> 00:47:06,119
I'm talking about
handguns and rifles.

689
00:47:08,263 --> 00:47:09,195
Holy shit!

690
00:47:09,398 --> 00:47:10,456
Claire, watch Drew!

691
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:11,758
Holy shit.

692
00:47:12,001 --> 00:47:13,525
Don't say that.
That's a bad word.

693
00:47:19,775 --> 00:47:20,799
Benny?

694
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:25,140
Sanders said something about
evidence disappearing after trials.

695
00:47:25,347 --> 00:47:27,338
Do you know anything about that?

696
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:31,110
My daddy told me that kind of thing
happened all the time.

697
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:36,257
People used to take stuff as souvenirs.
You know, lawyers, bailiffs, clerks.

698
00:47:36,792 --> 00:47:38,589
How about judges?

699
00:47:39,995 --> 00:47:40,893
That's true.

700
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,792
I'm afraid I won't
be able to play Tuesday.

701
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:47,025
We have a round robin at the club,
and I promised Lou Ann.

702
00:47:49,538 --> 00:47:52,234
Honey, don't worry about it.
I'll call Charlynne.

703
00:47:52,441 --> 00:47:54,966
If she can't make it, I'll get Louise.

704
00:47:55,177 --> 00:47:59,876
Sugar, play that jack of clubs for me
there, if you would. Please, ma'am.

705
00:48:01,383 --> 00:48:03,044
Hi, Grandma.

706
00:48:03,285 --> 00:48:06,584
What are you doing here?
Dixie's not here.

707
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:09,485
I thought you'd enjoy
a visit from your grandkids.

708
00:48:09,691 --> 00:48:14,094
Darlin', it's my bridge night tonight.
Drew! Come here.

709
00:48:14,296 --> 00:48:16,526
Well, we can't stay but a minute.

710
00:48:16,765 --> 00:48:20,531
Remember that rifle Judge Moore used
to hold open the door to his study?

711
00:48:20,736 --> 00:48:23,068
Have you seen that around anywhere?

712
00:48:23,439 --> 00:48:25,430
Ladies, y'all know Bobby.

713
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:27,541
That's Marilyn and Jill and Leah.

714
00:48:27,776 --> 00:48:32,008
I won't keep you from your game.
Go ahead and I'll be right back.

715
00:48:32,247 --> 00:48:34,943
Now, what is he doing here, Caroline?

716
00:48:36,819 --> 00:48:38,252
He's looking for a gun.

717
00:48:45,828 --> 00:48:47,955
I don't appreciate
your roaming around.

718
00:48:48,163 --> 00:48:51,690
I want you coming down
those stairs now, and leave.

719
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:56,701
I spent many a happy hour up here
arguing the law with your husband.

720
00:48:56,972 --> 00:49:00,203
And if he knew what you were up to
with this Evers nonsense...

721
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:02,707
...that man would
turn over in his grave.

722
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:05,104
I said that to myself just this morning.

723
00:49:06,014 --> 00:49:08,482
Dixie always said
that you were crazy as hell.

724
00:49:08,717 --> 00:49:10,241
Maybe she did have a point.

725
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:11,778
I love you...

726
00:49:12,354 --> 00:49:15,152
...but you and Dixie aren't
any more right for each other...

727
00:49:15,357 --> 00:49:16,949
...than the man in the moon.

728
00:49:19,461 --> 00:49:21,622
I'll go back
and resume my bridge game.

729
00:49:23,198 --> 00:49:25,291
You go on ahead.
I'll be right down.

730
00:49:28,303 --> 00:49:31,431
It's best if you come on
back down with me right now.

731
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,572
I prefer it.

732
00:49:39,615 --> 00:49:41,879
Be careful. It could be loaded.

733
00:49:42,084 --> 00:49:44,018
-Hold on to that.
-What are you doing?

734
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:47,120
-Checking this serial number.
-I love my grandchildren.

735
00:49:47,322 --> 00:49:51,224
-A little bit higher.
-It's inappropriate to march in here...

736
00:49:51,493 --> 00:49:54,394
...and you expect me to just let you....

737
00:49:54,596 --> 00:49:55,585
What?

738
00:49:56,832 --> 00:49:58,891
I love you, Caroline.

739
00:49:59,835 --> 00:50:02,861
-You're full of shit.
-I logged it in the evidence locker.

740
00:50:03,071 --> 00:50:05,471
-Logged what in?
-The gun that killed Medgar Evers.

741
00:50:05,674 --> 00:50:07,301
-You're full of shit.
-Who?

742
00:50:07,509 --> 00:50:09,374
He says he found the gun.

743
00:50:09,845 --> 00:50:12,780
-You're full of shit.
-That's something to tell Mrs. Evers.

744
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:15,575
I'm not gonna tell Mrs. Evers.

745
00:50:16,852 --> 00:50:19,980
You've been making those Friday calls
so she'd trust you.

746
00:50:20,189 --> 00:50:25,092
-lf she finds out....
-I can't have her find out.

747
00:50:25,294 --> 00:50:26,921
This can't leave the office.

748
00:50:27,496 --> 00:50:31,933
The only way we're gonna get a new
indictment is if we find something...

749
00:50:32,134 --> 00:50:34,898
...they didn't have 27 years ago.

750
00:50:35,103 --> 00:50:38,436
The way I see it, that something
will come from Beckwith.

751
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,540
Right now,
he's on his mountaintop...

752
00:50:40,742 --> 00:50:43,734
...shooting his mouth off
to anyone who'll listen.

753
00:50:43,946 --> 00:50:47,313
No telling what incriminating thing's
liable to come out of that man.

754
00:50:47,649 --> 00:50:50,345
But if he knows we have
something like this...

755
00:50:50,552 --> 00:50:52,782
...he'll know we're serious
and clam up.

756
00:50:52,988 --> 00:50:56,014
I doubt that Beckwith and Myrlie
speak all that often.

757
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:58,589
Myrlie speaks to Jerry Mitchell.

758
00:50:59,094 --> 00:51:01,619
Jerry Mitchell speaks to the world.

759
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:15,938
"You best stop wasting
our taxpayers' money.

760
00:51:16,144 --> 00:51:18,078
Enjoy your drive home."

761
00:51:18,714 --> 00:51:22,150
Nice to see Jackson still
has some concerned citizens.

762
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:27,086
Well, heck, son,
what did you expect?

763
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:30,888
I expect people to act like
decent, law-abiding citizens.

764
00:51:31,093 --> 00:51:33,084
This is 1990, for crying out loud.

765
00:51:33,295 --> 00:51:37,959
Of course it is. And we got blacks
and whites playing ball together...

766
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:42,262
...and on the police force,
in the government, on TV.

767
00:51:42,671 --> 00:51:46,903
We are a fully evolved society.
Aren't we, son?

768
00:51:49,911 --> 00:51:51,208
Let me tell you something:

769
00:51:51,647 --> 00:51:55,640
This country may be legally
integrated, but emotionally...

770
00:51:55,851 --> 00:51:58,376
...we will always be segregated.

771
00:51:58,587 --> 00:52:00,748
I don't know that I accept that.

772
00:52:01,256 --> 00:52:02,348
Of course not.

773
00:52:02,591 --> 00:52:04,286
You're Bobby DeLaughter...

774
00:52:04,493 --> 00:52:07,519
...Mississippi's self-appointed
new civil rights leader.

775
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,052
Barney...

776
00:52:09,331 --> 00:52:11,128
...do we have to talk about this?

777
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:13,528
No, we do not.

778
00:52:14,903 --> 00:52:17,895
Who all wants some of your
grandpa's famous baby backs?

779
00:52:18,106 --> 00:52:19,698
I do! I do!

780
00:52:30,552 --> 00:52:32,042
You're my son.

781
00:52:32,521 --> 00:52:34,148
I don't want you to get hurt.

782
00:52:37,059 --> 00:52:39,459
In Jackson, Mississippi

783
00:52:40,462 --> 00:52:43,898
In 1963

784
00:52:44,733 --> 00:52:47,930
There lived a man

785
00:52:48,136 --> 00:52:49,262
Who was brave

786
00:52:51,473 --> 00:52:55,466
He fought for freedom

787
00:52:56,478 --> 00:52:57,809
Hello, Mrs. Evers?

788
00:52:58,113 --> 00:52:59,341
It's Bobby DeLaughter.

789
00:53:00,115 --> 00:53:02,447
Nothing earth shattering, no.

790
00:53:02,784 --> 00:53:04,945
We've located all the witnesses...

791
00:53:05,153 --> 00:53:08,179
...but without the original
trial transcript...

792
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:10,381
...it's tough piecing the case together.

793
00:53:11,893 --> 00:53:13,724
No, ma'am, that's about it.

794
00:53:14,629 --> 00:53:18,190
-I wish I had more to report.
-Hang up the phone.

795
00:53:18,433 --> 00:53:21,402
-Hang up the phone.
-I hope I'll have something...

796
00:53:21,603 --> 00:53:23,935
...a little more exciting next Friday.

797
00:53:24,773 --> 00:53:26,070
-You too.
-Hang up.

798
00:53:26,675 --> 00:53:29,109
I'll call you next Friday, Mrs. Evers.

799
00:53:30,045 --> 00:53:31,979
Thank you. Goodbye.

800
00:53:32,447 --> 00:53:33,607
What is going on?

801
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:37,285
Would a confession by Mr. Beckwith
qualify as exciting?

802
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:38,950
What do you got?

803
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:40,745
You know Jack Ables?

804
00:53:40,956 --> 00:53:41,786
The lawyer?

805
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:45,448
He's representing a movie studio
in a defamation of character suit...

806
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:50,154
...brought by a couple Klansmen.
While he was doing his research...

807
00:53:50,365 --> 00:53:52,026
...he came across that.

808
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,002
"Klandestine."

809
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:57,097
It was written 20 years ago...

810
00:53:57,305 --> 00:54:01,002
...about this Klan titan turned
FBl informant, Delmar Dennis.

811
00:54:01,209 --> 00:54:06,146
On page 38, he talks about attending
a Klan rally in August of 1965.

812
00:54:06,481 --> 00:54:08,642
Guess who was a motivational speaker?

813
00:54:10,952 --> 00:54:12,442
-Beckwith?
-Our boy.

814
00:54:12,654 --> 00:54:13,882
Listen to this.

815
00:54:14,289 --> 00:54:15,756
And I quote:

816
00:54:16,158 --> 00:54:19,992
" Killing that nigger gave me no more
discomfort than our wives endure...

817
00:54:20,195 --> 00:54:22,186
...when they give birth
to our children."

818
00:54:22,597 --> 00:54:24,360
Sounds like a confession to me.

819
00:54:24,566 --> 00:54:28,832
Let's run down this Delmar Dennis.
We need to have a chat with him.

820
00:54:37,012 --> 00:54:39,606
$100 says old Delmar
chickens out on us.

821
00:54:39,915 --> 00:54:43,351
He's probably hiding in the woods,
shitting in his drawers.

822
00:54:51,827 --> 00:54:53,727
Where the hell is this place?

823
00:54:53,962 --> 00:54:55,827
This guy informed on the Klan.

824
00:54:56,064 --> 00:55:00,626
He could have made a deal with them
to save his butt by delivering us.

825
00:55:00,836 --> 00:55:02,599
That's a happy thought.

826
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:10,938
One of you Bobby DeLaughter?

827
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:16,072
Holding rallies and burning
crosses is one thing...

828
00:56:16,278 --> 00:56:19,577
...but when they killed them
three kids up in Neshoba County...

829
00:56:19,781 --> 00:56:22,079
-...freedom riders--
-Goodman, Chaney, Schwerner?

830
00:56:23,785 --> 00:56:26,515
That made a lot of people
come to their senses.

831
00:56:26,922 --> 00:56:30,551
That's why I decided
to go undercover for the FBl.

832
00:56:31,293 --> 00:56:34,592
I need to ask you if what
you say in that book happened.

833
00:56:34,796 --> 00:56:38,892
That part about Beckwith's speech
at that Klan rally. Is that a fact?

834
00:56:39,768 --> 00:56:40,962
It's a fact.

835
00:56:41,336 --> 00:56:44,601
I was shocked, and I remember
thinking how stupid he was...

836
00:56:44,806 --> 00:56:47,798
...shooting off his mouth
like that in front of 100 men.

837
00:56:48,043 --> 00:56:50,944
-Did you report that to the FBl?
-Sure, I did.

838
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:54,376
But Beckwith was a white man
accused of killing a black.

839
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:58,246
The FBl wasn't gonna blow my cover
on a case they couldn't win.

840
00:56:58,453 --> 00:57:00,444
They were saving me
for Neshoba because--

841
00:57:00,855 --> 00:57:02,413
Two of the victims were white.

842
00:57:09,664 --> 00:57:12,792
Mr. Dennis,
if I can't build the case...

843
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:16,732
...I give you my word that
we never had this conversation.

844
00:57:17,739 --> 00:57:19,172
But if I can...

845
00:57:19,374 --> 00:57:20,932
...will you testify?

846
00:57:24,779 --> 00:57:27,043
Byron De La Beckwith
is the craziest...

847
00:57:27,248 --> 00:57:30,376
...most dangerous son of a bitch
I ever come across.

848
00:57:30,685 --> 00:57:33,279
He's so crazy even
the Klan's afraid of him.

849
00:57:33,521 --> 00:57:34,818
He's an old man now.

850
00:57:35,023 --> 00:57:39,460
That old man is probably more dangerous
today than he was 30 years ago.

851
00:57:40,428 --> 00:57:42,988
Mr. Dennis, we need your help.

852
00:57:43,932 --> 00:57:46,162
I can't make no promises.

853
00:57:50,305 --> 00:57:52,205
You know something, Mr. Dennis?

854
00:57:52,641 --> 00:57:54,165
Six months I've worked this case.

855
00:57:54,376 --> 00:57:56,936
A lot of people have told me
to give it up.

856
00:57:57,145 --> 00:58:00,410
" It's 27 years old.
Let sleeping dogs lie."

857
00:58:00,615 --> 00:58:03,049
But I don't see
what difference it makes...

858
00:58:03,251 --> 00:58:05,412
...if a man was
bushwhacked yesterday...

859
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:08,521
...today or 27 damn years ago.

860
00:58:08,723 --> 00:58:10,384
Murder is murder.

861
00:58:11,126 --> 00:58:14,493
It's still my job to bring
the son of a bitch to justice.

862
00:58:14,696 --> 00:58:16,493
It's still your job to help me.

863
00:58:16,731 --> 00:58:20,098
No. I did my job.
I testified against the Klan.

864
00:58:20,301 --> 00:58:22,701
They shot out my windows,
blew up my car.

865
00:58:22,904 --> 00:58:25,668
They hunted and harassed me
for 25 years!

866
00:58:26,074 --> 00:58:28,201
Don't that get me even
for the wrong I done?

867
00:58:29,477 --> 00:58:32,139
We never get even
for the wrong we've done.

868
00:58:45,894 --> 00:58:47,794
If I do this thing...

869
00:58:50,231 --> 00:58:52,256
...you gotta promise me protection.

870
00:59:02,143 --> 00:59:03,337
What's going on?

871
00:59:04,579 --> 00:59:05,409
Stop that.

872
00:59:05,613 --> 00:59:06,978
Stop that. IKnock it off.

873
00:59:07,215 --> 00:59:08,045
Enough of that!

874
00:59:08,349 --> 00:59:10,817
-What's going on?
-Eddy called you a nigger lover.

875
00:59:11,019 --> 00:59:14,386
My dad says you're after a man
for something that isn't even a crime.

876
00:59:14,622 --> 00:59:17,955
That's enough fighting, son.
You get on home. Go on home.

877
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:19,592
Let me take a look at you.

878
00:59:19,794 --> 00:59:23,491
My God. Get in this house.
What's gotten into you?

879
00:59:28,069 --> 00:59:30,697
All this fighting.
All this name-calling.

880
00:59:31,206 --> 00:59:32,503
Is this what you want?

881
00:59:32,741 --> 00:59:34,436
To drag your children into this?

882
00:59:34,676 --> 00:59:37,770
What would you have me do?
Let a murderer go free?

883
00:59:38,146 --> 00:59:41,377
I'd never tell you your business.
I'm thinking about the children.

884
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:44,882
I don't understand why every
decent person in this state...

885
00:59:45,086 --> 00:59:48,283
...isn't sickened by what
happened here 27 years ago.

886
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:50,754
-Oh, Bobby.
-You're not, are you?

887
00:59:50,959 --> 00:59:53,359
-Not in front of the children.
-Why not?

888
00:59:53,595 --> 00:59:55,028
I was just a kid...

889
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:58,324
...and I still remember you
and your friends discussing it.

890
00:59:58,533 --> 01:00:02,025
And I recollect someone saying,
"That nigger needed to be shot."

891
01:00:03,304 --> 01:00:05,465
I never said a hateful
thing like that.

892
01:00:05,673 --> 01:00:09,404
-You didn't cry, did you?
-I can't say that I shed any tears--

893
01:00:09,611 --> 01:00:13,172
Had it been our beloved governor,
Ross Barnett, got himself shot...

894
01:00:13,381 --> 01:00:16,111
...you would've been
bawling your eyes out.

895
01:00:16,317 --> 01:00:20,515
Evers left a young widow and three
little kids. Why didn't you cry?

896
01:00:20,722 --> 01:00:22,849
-I don't wanna discuss this now.
-Why?

897
01:00:23,057 --> 01:00:25,548
Because he tried to destroy
our way of life.

898
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,455
And he succeeded all too well.

899
01:00:27,662 --> 01:00:30,426
This state's going to hell
on account of integration.

900
01:00:30,632 --> 01:00:33,430
That's a fact. If you think
they appreciate one thing...

901
01:00:33,635 --> 01:00:35,432
...we gave them, you're crazy.

902
01:00:35,637 --> 01:00:38,128
-Tiger, how do you feel?
-I'm all right.

903
01:00:38,339 --> 01:00:41,831
-Your son has one tough nose.
-So it's not broken?

904
01:00:43,111 --> 01:00:46,205
It'll be tender for a couple days,
then it'll be good as new.

905
01:00:46,481 --> 01:00:48,176
Thank you. I appreciate it.

906
01:00:48,383 --> 01:00:49,782
You're welcome.

907
01:00:50,518 --> 01:00:51,917
Thank you, ma'am.

908
01:00:57,692 --> 01:01:00,092
Are you the one involved
in this Medgar Evers thing?

909
01:01:02,297 --> 01:01:03,730
Yes, I am.

910
01:01:04,265 --> 01:01:07,757
I think what you're trying to do
is very important.

911
01:01:11,873 --> 01:01:13,738
Thank you very much.

912
01:01:29,357 --> 01:01:31,882
I don't want you kids getting
into anymore fights.

913
01:01:32,093 --> 01:01:35,062
-But he called you a--
-I don't care what he called me.

914
01:01:35,263 --> 01:01:38,926
It doesn't bother me. You gotta
learn not to let it bother you.

915
01:01:39,133 --> 01:01:42,296
A lot of people around here
don't like what Daddy's doing now.

916
01:01:42,637 --> 01:01:44,264
What are you doing, Daddy?

917
01:01:45,807 --> 01:01:48,970
I'm trying to put a bad man in jail.

918
01:01:49,544 --> 01:01:51,478
Mama says what you're doing is wrong.

919
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:54,944
Grandma said Edgar Mevers
is ruining our life.

920
01:01:59,854 --> 01:02:03,620
Medgar Evers was a good guy
who tried to help people.

921
01:02:03,825 --> 01:02:06,385
Did he try to beat the bad guys?

922
01:02:06,594 --> 01:02:10,223
Yes, he did. He fought
so that black people...

923
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:13,457
...could eat in the same restaurants,
swim in the same pools...

924
01:02:13,668 --> 01:02:17,399
...shop in the same stores and go
to the same schools as white people.

925
01:02:17,605 --> 01:02:18,629
What's wrong with that?

926
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:19,932
Nothing.

927
01:02:21,075 --> 01:02:23,805
But you'll hear people say
all kinds of bad things...

928
01:02:24,012 --> 01:02:25,673
...about what your daddy's doing.

929
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,815
They're gonna tease you,
try to pick fights.

930
01:02:29,183 --> 01:02:30,946
But no matter what they do...

931
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:33,680
...I want you to walk away.

932
01:02:34,722 --> 01:02:36,781
What if they say
something really mean?

933
01:02:36,991 --> 01:02:40,586
They're only words. They can't
hurt you unless you let them.

934
01:02:40,795 --> 01:02:43,263
Is this about sticks and stones?

935
01:02:43,464 --> 01:02:46,126
That's exactly what this is about.

936
01:02:46,434 --> 01:02:48,163
Y'all understand what I'm saying?

937
01:02:48,369 --> 01:02:49,461
Yes, sir.

938
01:02:49,804 --> 01:02:50,964
All right.

939
01:02:51,272 --> 01:02:52,671
All y'all get on to bed now.

940
01:02:54,175 --> 01:02:55,369
Good night.

941
01:03:17,498 --> 01:03:21,025
I heard you had a little visit
with my friend Delmar.

942
01:03:21,235 --> 01:03:22,293
Mr. Beckwith?

943
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:26,231
Next time you see old Delmar,
you tell him for me...

944
01:03:26,507 --> 01:03:28,532
...there are a lot
of dark, winding roads...

945
01:03:28,743 --> 01:03:33,339
... between the backwoods of Louisiana
and a courtroom in Mississippi.

946
01:03:33,915 --> 01:03:36,509
A man could get lost.

947
01:03:46,294 --> 01:03:47,921
Claire, what's the matter?

948
01:03:48,463 --> 01:03:50,556
The ghost's in my room again.

949
01:03:54,435 --> 01:03:56,426
Let's see what we can do.

950
01:03:59,374 --> 01:04:01,604
-Where is he?
-Sitting right there.

951
01:04:01,809 --> 01:04:03,333
Oh, right.

952
01:04:05,046 --> 01:04:07,105
Daddy, sing "Dixie."

953
01:04:09,117 --> 01:04:10,880
Hop into bed, sweetie.

954
01:04:21,429 --> 01:04:22,521
Sing.

955
01:04:24,065 --> 01:04:27,694
You know, sweetie, maybe
" Dixie" is not the right song.

956
01:04:28,169 --> 01:04:30,535
Maybe that's why
this ghost keeps coming back.

957
01:04:30,738 --> 01:04:32,729
-But you said--
-I know, baby.

958
01:04:33,408 --> 01:04:36,775
But I'm not so sure
that all ghosts like "Dixie."

959
01:04:36,978 --> 01:04:39,742
But how do we know
what this ghost likes?

960
01:04:40,314 --> 01:04:44,774
Seeing as this is your special ghost,
maybe he'll like your favorite song.

961
01:04:44,986 --> 01:04:46,578
"Old MacDonald"?

962
01:04:46,788 --> 01:04:48,415
Let's give it a try.

963
01:04:50,425 --> 01:04:52,416
Old MacDonald had a farm

964
01:04:52,693 --> 01:04:54,251
E-I-E-I-O

965
01:04:54,462 --> 01:04:56,396
And on that farm he had a--

966
01:04:56,597 --> 01:04:57,495
What?

967
01:04:57,999 --> 01:04:59,159
A ghost?

968
01:05:01,169 --> 01:05:03,399
And on that farm he had a ghost

969
01:05:03,604 --> 01:05:05,094
E-I-E-I-O

970
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,408
With a boo boo here
And a boo boo there

971
01:05:07,608 --> 01:05:10,236
Here a boo, there a boo
Everywhere a boo boo

972
01:05:24,058 --> 01:05:25,582
You wanted to have lunch
to talk about Burt's nose?

973
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,588
No, actually, l....

974
01:05:27,795 --> 01:05:29,285
I didn't think so.

975
01:05:31,866 --> 01:05:33,697
So then, this is a date?

976
01:05:35,136 --> 01:05:36,262
Apparently.

977
01:05:36,704 --> 01:05:38,501
In the hospital cafeteria?

978
01:05:38,706 --> 01:05:43,143
I took a chance. I thought
it would either be stupid or charming.

979
01:05:43,845 --> 01:05:44,812
What do you think?

980
01:05:45,246 --> 01:05:46,838
Is there a third choice?

981
01:05:47,048 --> 01:05:47,980
Extremely charming?

982
01:05:48,182 --> 01:05:49,706
That's the one.

983
01:05:51,986 --> 01:05:53,715
How'd you get into all this?

984
01:05:54,155 --> 01:05:56,146
You want the standard answer
or the truth?

985
01:05:56,357 --> 01:05:57,881
How about a little of both?

986
01:05:59,894 --> 01:06:01,987
I always liked helping people...

987
01:06:02,196 --> 01:06:03,356
...and I like the hours.

988
01:06:03,631 --> 01:06:04,962
Which answer was that?

989
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:06,531
A little of both.

990
01:06:06,767 --> 01:06:10,328
But I do like that I work
one week on and one week off.

991
01:06:10,705 --> 01:06:11,865
Can't beat that.

992
01:06:12,073 --> 01:06:15,270
Have to be careful not to shop
too much in that week off.

993
01:06:15,476 --> 01:06:18,070
That can kill you.
What about you?

994
01:06:18,746 --> 01:06:21,544
I wanted to be a lawyer
since I was a little kid.

995
01:06:21,749 --> 01:06:23,376
I watched Perry Mason...

996
01:06:23,584 --> 01:06:26,519
...all the time.
I identified with him.

997
01:06:26,754 --> 01:06:29,222
-But he was a defense attorney.
-I know.

998
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:32,557
Later, I realized the only way
he ever won a case...

999
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,354
...is if some guy jumped up
and yelled, "I did it!"

1000
01:06:35,563 --> 01:06:38,760
That didn't happen often,
so I switched to the other side.

1001
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,432
I think it's a good thing you did.

1002
01:06:44,038 --> 01:06:46,472
You would be in
the minority these days.

1003
01:06:47,742 --> 01:06:50,939
There are a lot more people
on your side than you think.

1004
01:06:52,046 --> 01:06:55,106
You're not saying that because
I bought you a lime Jell-O?

1005
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:58,784
Well, it is the way
to a woman's heart.

1006
01:07:01,389 --> 01:07:05,826
But if you could pull this off,
it'd do Mississippi a whole lot of good.

1007
01:07:07,562 --> 01:07:08,790
And if I don't?

1008
01:07:10,398 --> 01:07:12,559
I'll pretend I never met you.

1009
01:07:20,074 --> 01:07:23,009
I have renewed faith
in the institution of marriage.

1010
01:07:23,211 --> 01:07:25,577
I can't get enough
of my hunk of burning love.

1011
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,748
Not now, Clara May!

1012
01:07:30,418 --> 01:07:31,908
Clara Mayfield.

1013
01:07:33,321 --> 01:07:35,915
-It's Jerry Mitchell.
-I'll take it.

1014
01:07:41,996 --> 01:07:44,556
-I know you have the gun.
-We've been over this.

1015
01:07:44,765 --> 01:07:47,063
I know you found it
in Russel Moore's den.

1016
01:07:47,935 --> 01:07:52,395
There'll be a story about how the
D.A. Iied to the people of Jackson...

1017
01:07:52,607 --> 01:07:55,303
...and how Bobby DeLaughter
lied to Myrlie Evers.

1018
01:07:55,509 --> 01:07:58,034
I'm calling to see
if you care to comment.

1019
01:07:58,246 --> 01:08:00,077
You've explained why
you lied to the press.

1020
01:08:00,281 --> 01:08:02,806
You still have not explained
why you lied to me.

1021
01:08:03,017 --> 01:08:05,577
I told you. Jerry Mitchell
is a loose cannon.

1022
01:08:05,786 --> 01:08:08,755
This case was so delicate,
I didn't want to take chances.

1023
01:08:08,956 --> 01:08:12,949
I'm the last person on earth who
would jeopardize this investigation.

1024
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,594
There's something
you're not telling me.

1025
01:08:15,796 --> 01:08:18,663
I swear to God, there is no cover-up.

1026
01:08:18,866 --> 01:08:21,926
You fully intend to seek
an indictment and a new trial?

1027
01:08:22,136 --> 01:08:24,331
That's what we've
been working toward.

1028
01:08:24,538 --> 01:08:26,631
I thought so, Mr. DeLaughter.

1029
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:28,474
I thought so.

1030
01:08:28,776 --> 01:08:32,337
This latest revelation only proves
what we've suspected all along.

1031
01:08:32,546 --> 01:08:36,607
Peters and DeLaughter are just putting
on a show for the black community.

1032
01:08:36,817 --> 01:08:40,844
As far as I'm concerned, they're nothing
but a pair of lying racists...

1033
01:08:41,055 --> 01:08:42,682
...who never, I repeat, never...

1034
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:45,859
...had any intention
of prosecuting this case.

1035
01:08:47,895 --> 01:08:49,055
You wanted to see me?

1036
01:08:49,263 --> 01:08:51,163
Come on, sit down.

1037
01:08:54,001 --> 01:08:58,062
You don't mind being seen in
the same room with a "lying racist"?

1038
01:08:58,873 --> 01:09:00,670
I don't mind if you don't.

1039
01:09:02,343 --> 01:09:03,708
You know Pat Bennett?

1040
01:09:04,245 --> 01:09:07,180
Sure, she's one of the best
lawyers in the state.

1041
01:09:08,683 --> 01:09:10,207
Why are we talking about her?

1042
01:09:11,519 --> 01:09:14,682
I thought she might be able
to help you on the case.

1043
01:09:15,589 --> 01:09:17,853
I've got it under control, Ed.

1044
01:09:20,261 --> 01:09:22,889
You have your share of
the 93 capital murder cases...

1045
01:09:23,097 --> 01:09:25,429
...we have waiting for trial
under control?

1046
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,498
What new excuse would
you suggest I give...

1047
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:32,002
...to the families as to why those
who've murdered their loved ones...

1048
01:09:32,206 --> 01:09:33,935
...have yet to see a courtroom?

1049
01:09:34,608 --> 01:09:38,203
I'm just curious.
The fact that Pat Bennett is black...

1050
01:09:38,412 --> 01:09:41,074
...wouldn't have anything to do
with this, would it?

1051
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:43,977
I'm not gonna dignify that.

1052
01:09:45,986 --> 01:09:49,478
Whatever you may think,
this is not the Bobby DeLaughter case.

1053
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:53,126
This is a case against the peace
and dignity of Mississippi.

1054
01:09:54,061 --> 01:09:56,495
Monday morning, I'm making a change.

1055
01:10:01,602 --> 01:10:05,003
You're about to hear the testimony
of a fingerprint expert...

1056
01:10:05,206 --> 01:10:09,506
...concerning evidence he claims
to have identified in a certain glass.

1057
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,371
You're entitled to consider...

1058
01:10:11,579 --> 01:10:15,413
... the prosecution's failure to make
the glass available to the defense.

1059
01:10:15,616 --> 01:10:20,144
It is permissible that for one fact
alone to raise a doubt in your minds...

1060
01:10:20,354 --> 01:10:22,754
... that will require
Mrs. Savage's acquittal.

1061
01:10:22,957 --> 01:10:26,290
-Can he do that?
-This is my case, damn it.

1062
01:10:26,494 --> 01:10:28,519
How dare they say
I'm putting on a show?

1063
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:32,096
Only two people care about
this case, and I'm one of them.

1064
01:10:32,299 --> 01:10:36,065
If anybody's putting on a show,
they are. The only thing they' re--

1065
01:10:36,737 --> 01:10:40,264
They're only trying to stir up
emotions and position themselves...

1066
01:10:40,474 --> 01:10:42,908
...as the saviors
of the black community.

1067
01:10:51,018 --> 01:10:52,178
Where you going?

1068
01:11:11,372 --> 01:11:14,170
This is Bobby DeLaughter.
I hope I didn't disturb you.

1069
01:11:15,843 --> 01:11:17,936
This won't take but a minute, ma'am.

1070
01:11:19,346 --> 01:11:21,576
When I started off,
I had nothing more than...

1071
01:11:21,782 --> 01:11:24,774
...a couple of pages
in an old police report.

1072
01:11:25,553 --> 01:11:28,716
I spent the better part of a year
bumping up against dead witnesses...

1073
01:11:28,923 --> 01:11:30,914
...and tracking down live ones.

1074
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:34,458
My car's been vandalized,
my son's been in a fight...

1075
01:11:34,662 --> 01:11:38,257
...and I've been called ugly things
by every racist in Mississippi.

1076
01:11:38,466 --> 01:11:40,559
Now, when there's a chance
for an indictment...

1077
01:11:40,768 --> 01:11:42,929
...I've gotta fight off
black politicians too.

1078
01:11:43,137 --> 01:11:47,267
I'm sorry I lied about the gun,
but I've made a commitment to this case.

1079
01:11:47,475 --> 01:11:48,669
I'll be goddamned--

1080
01:11:48,876 --> 01:11:51,709
Pardon me, if I give it up
to some special prosecutor...

1081
01:11:51,912 --> 01:11:54,312
...I don't care if he's
black, green or blue.

1082
01:11:54,515 --> 01:11:57,575
I'm committed and I'm asking you
to make a commitment to me.

1083
01:11:57,785 --> 01:12:00,515
If you do, I'll ride this thing
to the finish line...

1084
01:12:00,721 --> 01:12:02,985
...or collapse
heading in that direction.

1085
01:12:04,558 --> 01:12:07,186
Thank you for your call,
Mr. DeLaughter.

1086
01:12:11,632 --> 01:12:14,032
The hell with her!
She's like all the rest.

1087
01:12:14,235 --> 01:12:18,365
The white world hasn't gone out
of its way to make her trusting.

1088
01:12:18,572 --> 01:12:20,437
When does it start?
What do I have to do?

1089
01:12:20,641 --> 01:12:23,633
We had a real chance to send
a message to this country...

1090
01:12:23,844 --> 01:12:26,813
...that Mississippi isn't
a bunch of redneck racists.

1091
01:12:27,014 --> 01:12:31,110
My mother was right. We should
separate and let the South rise again.

1092
01:12:31,318 --> 01:12:33,445
-You don't believe that.
-Why not?

1093
01:12:33,654 --> 01:12:35,144
She doesn't want my help.

1094
01:12:35,356 --> 01:12:37,790
I'm just another white man
putting her in her place.

1095
01:12:37,992 --> 01:12:40,483
She sees no difference
between me and Beckwith.

1096
01:12:40,694 --> 01:12:42,594
-You didn't tell her about the gun.
-Right.

1097
01:12:42,863 --> 01:12:46,890
If I had it to do over again,
I still wouldn't have told her.

1098
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:51,060
IKeeping the discovery of the murder
weapon a secret was a good strategy.

1099
01:12:51,272 --> 01:12:55,402
It wouldn't bother her a lick if I was
black. I'd just be a smart lawyer.

1100
01:12:56,043 --> 01:12:58,238
You can't have it both ways.

1101
01:12:58,579 --> 01:13:00,308
What do you mean by that?

1102
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:04,578
You said the reason you didn't
tell her about the gun...

1103
01:13:04,785 --> 01:13:07,413
...was that you were afraid
she would leak the story.

1104
01:13:07,621 --> 01:13:10,715
You can't expect her to trust you,
if you don't trust her.

1105
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:32,140
I want you to meet with Pat Bennett
and bring her up to speed.

1106
01:13:33,948 --> 01:13:34,972
Fine.

1107
01:13:36,317 --> 01:13:37,750
It's for the best.

1108
01:13:38,886 --> 01:13:40,478
If you say so.

1109
01:14:03,477 --> 01:14:05,468
I'm going out.
You want something?

1110
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:09,410
I'd like a Mercedes convertible,
but I'd settle for a Dr. Pepper.

1111
01:15:04,938 --> 01:15:08,339
There are four important
things in my life:

1112
01:15:09,243 --> 01:15:11,370
Medgar, Walter...

1113
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,044
...my children...

1114
01:15:13,347 --> 01:15:14,746
...and this...

1115
01:15:15,382 --> 01:15:18,681
...the original
court-certified transcript.

1116
01:15:19,253 --> 01:15:21,813
I've kept this for 27 years...

1117
01:15:22,122 --> 01:15:24,386
...through three district attorneys.

1118
01:15:24,591 --> 01:15:26,491
Once I give this up...

1119
01:15:26,694 --> 01:15:29,561
...I know that it may be gone forever.

1120
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:41,766
I don't believe you'll find
anymore opposition...

1121
01:15:41,975 --> 01:15:44,466
...to your continuing
to handle this case.

1122
01:15:45,779 --> 01:15:47,041
Thank you, ma'am.

1123
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:52,043
It's truly appreciated.

1124
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,284
Let's get the son of a bitch.

1125
01:15:56,557 --> 01:15:57,956
My pleasure.

1126
01:16:00,094 --> 01:16:02,187
The decision by the D.A.'s office...

1127
01:16:02,396 --> 01:16:06,355
...to re-open the 27-year-old murder
case of Byron De La Beckwith...

1128
01:16:06,567 --> 01:16:08,228
...continues to cause controversy.

1129
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:11,504
Citizens of Jackson are concerned...

1130
01:16:11,705 --> 01:16:15,004
... that taxpayers' money is being
used to dig up the past.

1131
01:16:15,209 --> 01:16:18,940
The grand jury handed down an
indictment of Byron De La Beckwith...

1132
01:16:19,146 --> 01:16:22,138
...in the murder of
civil rights leader Medgar Evers.

1133
01:16:22,349 --> 01:16:23,873
Extradition in the Beckwith case...

1134
01:16:24,084 --> 01:16:27,315
...is seen as a stumbling
block for the D.A.'s office.

1135
01:16:27,521 --> 01:16:29,887
I plan to fight repossession--
What's the word?

1136
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:33,253
Extradition tooth, nail and claw!

1137
01:16:33,794 --> 01:16:36,786
In an attempt to replace
a lost autopsy report...

1138
01:16:36,997 --> 01:16:40,763
... the D.A.'s office of Hinds County
today received permission...

1139
01:16:40,968 --> 01:16:43,061
...by the Evers family
to exhume the body...

1140
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:46,706
...of slain civil rights leader
Medgar Evers.

1141
01:16:47,374 --> 01:16:50,901
The body, buried in
Arlington National Cemetery in 1963...

1142
01:16:51,111 --> 01:16:53,773
... was found in remarkably
near-perfect condition.

1143
01:16:57,885 --> 01:17:00,911
After 18 months, extradition was
finally granted...

1144
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:03,089
...in the case
of Byron De La Beckwith...

1145
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:07,158
... the man accused of slaying
civil rights leader Medgar Evers.

1146
01:17:08,228 --> 01:17:12,756
Beckwith will face murder charges
30 years after the initial two trials...

1147
01:17:12,966 --> 01:17:16,094
...for the same offense
ended in hung juries.

1148
01:17:16,303 --> 01:17:17,167
Thank you, son.

1149
01:17:17,471 --> 01:17:19,166
" I first received the call...

1150
01:17:19,373 --> 01:17:21,307
...at 9 :42 p. m...

1151
01:17:21,508 --> 01:17:25,205
...on the night of June 12, 1963.

1152
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:29,608
My partner and I responded
and proceeded to the crime scene...

1153
01:17:29,817 --> 01:17:33,150
...Iocated at 2332 Guynes Street."

1154
01:17:33,487 --> 01:17:35,148
That's pretty good, Benny...

1155
01:17:35,355 --> 01:17:38,290
...but just because you read
the part of a dead witness...

1156
01:17:38,492 --> 01:17:41,393
...doesn't mean you have to
act like you're actually dead.

1157
01:17:41,595 --> 01:17:42,994
I'm doing my best.

1158
01:17:43,197 --> 01:17:44,664
I know you are.

1159
01:17:44,865 --> 01:17:47,356
Medgar Evers' autopsy report
just came in.

1160
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:51,334
You're not gonna believe this.
He's still dead.

1161
01:17:51,805 --> 01:17:52,999
Thank you, Clara.

1162
01:17:53,207 --> 01:17:56,665
I got off the phone with Charles Evers.
He won't come to the trial.

1163
01:17:56,877 --> 01:17:57,707
Did he say why?

1164
01:17:57,911 --> 01:17:59,173
He wouldn't say.

1165
01:17:59,379 --> 01:18:01,677
Get me the address
of his radio station.

1166
01:18:01,882 --> 01:18:04,043
They found a bullet fragment
in the body.

1167
01:18:04,251 --> 01:18:06,776
It's consistent with a.30-06 Enfield.

1168
01:18:07,754 --> 01:18:11,690
You'll be sorry. What happened to
that nigger will happen to you.

1169
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:13,890
Another one?

1170
01:18:15,729 --> 01:18:19,756
Closer we get to trial, the more
nutjobs will crawl out of the woodwork.

1171
01:18:20,968 --> 01:18:21,866
You got a gun?

1172
01:18:23,403 --> 01:18:25,030
Here. T ake this.

1173
01:18:25,572 --> 01:18:27,437
No, wait. T ake this.

1174
01:18:29,076 --> 01:18:30,668
T ake this.

1175
01:18:55,002 --> 01:18:58,438
That was Muddy Waters doing
his thing for y'all.

1176
01:18:58,639 --> 01:19:01,631
Now I'll play a little something
that goes way back.

1177
01:19:01,842 --> 01:19:04,811
The great Robert Johnson.

1178
01:19:09,249 --> 01:19:10,307
Mr. Evers?

1179
01:19:13,687 --> 01:19:16,155
-Hi, I'm--
-Bobby DeLaughter.

1180
01:19:17,591 --> 01:19:19,320
Please sit down.

1181
01:19:29,169 --> 01:19:30,500
Robert Johnson.

1182
01:19:31,004 --> 01:19:33,234
IKing of the Delta Blues.

1183
01:19:36,076 --> 01:19:38,408
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1184
01:19:40,981 --> 01:19:43,108
May your soul rise up to heaven...

1185
01:19:43,317 --> 01:19:45,785
...'fore the devil knows you're dead.

1186
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:56,991
They say Robert Johnson sold his soul to
the devil to play the guitar like that.

1187
01:19:57,397 --> 01:19:58,295
What do you think?

1188
01:19:58,498 --> 01:20:02,798
If the devil wanted my soul, it'd cost
a lot more than some guitar lessons.

1189
01:20:06,039 --> 01:20:08,530
I believe after this trial's over...

1190
01:20:08,742 --> 01:20:11,176
...Mississippi come through this time.

1191
01:20:11,478 --> 01:20:14,345
That's why I came here
to talk with you, Mr. Evers.

1192
01:20:14,548 --> 01:20:18,416
Would you change your mind and come
to the trial? Your presence...

1193
01:20:18,618 --> 01:20:20,552
...would mean a great deal.

1194
01:20:22,389 --> 01:20:24,789
Let me tell you something.

1195
01:20:26,059 --> 01:20:28,550
Medgar was my baby brother.

1196
01:20:29,196 --> 01:20:31,960
There ain't nothing
I wouldn't do for him.

1197
01:20:33,033 --> 01:20:34,762
When we were little kids...

1198
01:20:34,968 --> 01:20:36,731
...we used to sleep in the same bed.

1199
01:20:36,937 --> 01:20:38,336
And on cold nights...

1200
01:20:38,538 --> 01:20:42,167
...I'd climb in first just so I could
warm up the sheets for him.

1201
01:20:44,745 --> 01:20:48,078
I didn't go to the first two trials.

1202
01:20:49,383 --> 01:20:50,907
Myrlie...

1203
01:20:51,585 --> 01:20:54,986
...a lot of people,
they criticized me for that.

1204
01:20:55,789 --> 01:20:58,417
But I won't go
to no third trial neither...

1205
01:20:59,459 --> 01:21:02,053
...and for the exact same reason.

1206
01:21:02,262 --> 01:21:06,289
I know if I ever got in the same room
with Byron De La Beckwith...

1207
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,934
...as God is my witness...

1208
01:21:09,269 --> 01:21:12,761
...I'd wrap my hands around
his chicken neck and snap it in half.

1209
01:21:12,973 --> 01:21:14,702
And nobody...

1210
01:21:14,908 --> 01:21:16,842
...be able to stop me.

1211
01:21:18,512 --> 01:21:20,139
I wouldn't blame you.

1212
01:21:20,347 --> 01:21:21,575
Nobody hardly ever...

1213
01:21:21,782 --> 01:21:24,182
...remembers Medgar anymore.

1214
01:21:25,152 --> 01:21:27,017
Whites or blacks.

1215
01:21:27,687 --> 01:21:30,019
And that's a goddamn shame.

1216
01:21:30,757 --> 01:21:33,590
Because whatever rights
the black man has now...

1217
01:21:33,794 --> 01:21:37,127
...he's got because of something
called the Civil Rights Movement.

1218
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:40,458
And for a long time here
in the state of Mississippi...

1219
01:21:40,967 --> 01:21:44,767
...before the television, newspapers,
back before the fancy speeches...

1220
01:21:44,971 --> 01:21:48,964
...my brother, Medgar, was
the Civil Rights Movement.

1221
01:21:54,614 --> 01:21:59,108
I'm sitting here tonight,
talking to my friend and your friend...

1222
01:21:59,319 --> 01:22:01,981
...Assistant District Attorney
Bobby DeLaughter.

1223
01:22:02,189 --> 01:22:05,317
We're talking about my brother,
Medgar Evers...

1224
01:22:05,525 --> 01:22:10,326
...and we're gonna play the blues
for Medgar all night long.

1225
01:22:20,841 --> 01:22:23,002
You and my sister-in-law...

1226
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:26,045
...you get justice for my brother.

1227
01:22:35,822 --> 01:22:38,017
Devil, if you listening...

1228
01:22:38,258 --> 01:22:40,556
...I won't sell my soul
for no guitar lessons...

1229
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:43,194
...but I'll sell my soul for that.

1230
01:22:47,834 --> 01:22:49,699
Are you surprised bail
was granted so quickly?

1231
01:22:49,903 --> 01:22:52,701
Mr. Beckwith was being held
as a political prisoner.

1232
01:22:52,906 --> 01:22:56,069
He's not been found guilty.
Why should he be kept in jail?

1233
01:22:57,444 --> 01:22:59,935
Mr. Scott, you're an officer
of the Nationalist Movement, correct?

1234
01:23:00,147 --> 01:23:02,479
Is that where the money came from
to secure his bond?

1235
01:23:02,682 --> 01:23:06,914
Mr. Beckwith has a lot of friends here.
We'll do whatever it takes.

1236
01:23:07,387 --> 01:23:11,619
Suppose he doesn't show for the trial?
Suppose he leaves the country?

1237
01:23:11,825 --> 01:23:13,884
If he runs, we'll find him.

1238
01:23:14,094 --> 01:23:15,823
How long will that take?

1239
01:23:16,029 --> 01:23:18,827
Another five years? Another 10?

1240
01:23:19,032 --> 01:23:23,059
I've already devoted a lifetime to this.
That ought to be enough.

1241
01:23:24,037 --> 01:23:26,562
Yes, ma'am. It sure ought to be.

1242
01:23:31,511 --> 01:23:33,138
I'm sorry, Bobby.

1243
01:23:34,247 --> 01:23:36,238
It's all right, Mrs. Evers.

1244
01:23:36,449 --> 01:23:37,939
It's quite all right.

1245
01:24:05,011 --> 01:24:07,571
-How's Jared doing?
-Fine.

1246
01:24:07,781 --> 01:24:11,046
He and Burt seem like
they've been brothers all their lives.

1247
01:24:11,251 --> 01:24:12,775
They all sleeping?

1248
01:24:14,454 --> 01:24:16,684
And that's what you should be doing.

1249
01:24:17,524 --> 01:24:19,719
I want the opening statement
to be great.

1250
01:24:20,493 --> 01:24:22,893
It was great when you read
it three nights ago.

1251
01:24:23,096 --> 01:24:25,030
Unless you snuck in something about...

1252
01:24:25,232 --> 01:24:27,325
...Beckwith deserving
the Nobel Peace Prize...

1253
01:24:27,534 --> 01:24:29,764
...I'm sure it'll be great
tomorrow morning.

1254
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:32,495
You see? That's why I look to you.

1255
01:24:32,706 --> 01:24:36,164
Eliminate Nobel Peace Prize reference.

1256
01:24:36,376 --> 01:24:37,843
That's good.

1257
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:44,446
I left a gift for you in appreciation
for everything you're doing...

1258
01:24:44,651 --> 01:24:46,516
... to ruin civilized society.

1259
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,951
-What the hell is this?
-It's scheduled to go off at 10 p.m.

1260
01:24:50,156 --> 01:24:52,147
You have a nice night.

1261
01:24:56,663 --> 01:24:57,493
It's a bomb.

1262
01:25:02,502 --> 01:25:04,299
Everybody, get up.
Let's go.

1263
01:25:04,504 --> 01:25:05,869
What's going on?

1264
01:25:06,072 --> 01:25:09,974
It's nothing at all. Outside that door.
A little drill is all.

1265
01:25:10,176 --> 01:25:11,768
Head for the front door.

1266
01:25:45,912 --> 01:25:48,073
Is this still the drill?

1267
01:26:01,194 --> 01:26:02,752
Where are we going, Dad?

1268
01:26:02,962 --> 01:26:05,089
Told you we're going
to the Holiday Inn.

1269
01:26:05,298 --> 01:26:07,732
Is that where we're going?
The Holiday Inn?

1270
01:26:07,934 --> 01:26:08,832
That's right.

1271
01:26:09,035 --> 01:26:13,369
We haven't found anything,
but we'll go through it one more time.

1272
01:26:13,573 --> 01:26:15,404
I appreciate that.

1273
01:26:35,662 --> 01:26:40,258
I told them if anything ever happened,
all they had to do was walk away.

1274
01:26:42,435 --> 01:26:45,598
How're they supposed to walk away
from a bomb?

1275
01:26:50,577 --> 01:26:52,511
There wasn't a bomb.

1276
01:26:55,048 --> 01:26:56,515
This time.

1277
01:27:00,053 --> 01:27:02,920
If you want to give this thing up,
I understand.

1278
01:27:03,123 --> 01:27:06,650
No one could fault you. But the world
isn't going to be any safer.

1279
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:09,727
I don't give a shit about the world.
These are my children.

1280
01:27:09,929 --> 01:27:11,260
Yes, they are.

1281
01:27:11,464 --> 01:27:13,955
Someday they'll be able
to tell their children...

1282
01:27:14,167 --> 01:27:16,897
...that their daddy put away
Medgar Evers' killer.

1283
01:27:17,470 --> 01:27:20,405
Medgar Evers was a fool,
and my daddy was right.

1284
01:27:20,607 --> 01:27:22,905
Doesn't matter how many
civil rights laws you pass.

1285
01:27:23,109 --> 01:27:25,407
You'll never legislate
how people think.

1286
01:27:25,612 --> 01:27:28,274
There are always gonna be
a few misguided people.

1287
01:27:28,481 --> 01:27:32,577
I'm not talking about a few people.
I'm talking about everybody, about us.

1288
01:27:32,786 --> 01:27:35,254
Do we have one single
black friend? No.

1289
01:27:35,455 --> 01:27:37,923
We don't have dinner with them
or have them over.

1290
01:27:38,124 --> 01:27:39,751
We don't sit with them in church.

1291
01:27:39,959 --> 01:27:42,757
You think this one trial will
magically change this?

1292
01:27:42,996 --> 01:27:44,657
No, I don't.

1293
01:27:45,131 --> 01:27:46,655
It's a step.

1294
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,425
That's all anyone can do
is take a step.

1295
01:27:49,636 --> 01:27:51,763
Why do I have to take that step?

1296
01:27:51,971 --> 01:27:54,906
So some sick son of a bitch
can murder my wife and kids?

1297
01:27:55,108 --> 01:27:57,770
Excuse me if I'm not interested
in taking that step.

1298
01:27:57,977 --> 01:27:59,171
Where are you going?

1299
01:27:59,379 --> 01:28:01,142
For a drive.

1300
01:30:13,413 --> 01:30:17,782
" I don't know if I'm going to heaven
or hell, but I'm going from Jackson."

1301
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:25,484
We're on record in the matter
of Mississippi v. Byron De La Beckwith.

1302
01:30:25,692 --> 01:30:27,819
Does prosecution have
its opening statement?

1303
01:30:29,329 --> 01:30:30,296
We do, Your Honor.

1304
01:30:36,536 --> 01:30:38,401
Ladies and gentlemen...

1305
01:30:38,605 --> 01:30:41,096
...this is a very simple case.

1306
01:30:43,076 --> 01:30:45,738
It's about a man whose life
was snuffed out...

1307
01:30:45,945 --> 01:30:49,312
...on June the 12th of 1963...

1308
01:30:49,916 --> 01:30:52,646
...by a bullet that tore
through his body.

1309
01:30:53,286 --> 01:30:56,221
A bullet aimed out of prejudice...

1310
01:30:56,422 --> 01:30:58,287
...propelled by hatred...

1311
01:30:58,491 --> 01:31:01,927
...and fired by
a back-shooting coward...

1312
01:31:03,062 --> 01:31:04,757
...from ambush...

1313
01:31:05,898 --> 01:31:06,990
...at night.

1314
01:31:07,533 --> 01:31:12,368
The evidence will overwhelmingly show
that Byron De La Beckwith...

1315
01:31:12,839 --> 01:31:16,275
...a self-proclaimed, rabid racist
on a lifelong mission...

1316
01:31:16,476 --> 01:31:19,274
...to purge society
of anyone and anything...

1317
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:21,106
...that stood for integration...

1318
01:31:21,314 --> 01:31:23,839
...is the man that fired that bullet.

1319
01:31:24,417 --> 01:31:27,682
Evidence will show how, when he
thought he beat the system...

1320
01:31:27,887 --> 01:31:30,481
...he bragged about what he'd done.

1321
01:31:31,524 --> 01:31:34,891
Bragged about getting
away with murder.

1322
01:31:36,963 --> 01:31:41,093
The evidence will undeniably show that
the person who pulled the trigger...

1323
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:45,327
...and ended the life of Medgar Evers
is this defendant...

1324
01:31:46,172 --> 01:31:48,231
...Byron De La Beckwith.

1325
01:31:52,745 --> 01:31:54,212
Mr. Coxwell?

1326
01:31:55,248 --> 01:31:56,840
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

1327
01:31:57,283 --> 01:32:01,014
My name is Merrida Coxwell.
This is James Kitchens...

1328
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:04,451
...and we are representing
Mr. Beckwith.

1329
01:32:05,058 --> 01:32:07,788
Mr. DeLaughter started
his opening statement...

1330
01:32:07,994 --> 01:32:10,963
...by saying that this was
a very simple case.

1331
01:32:11,164 --> 01:32:12,631
I agree with him.

1332
01:32:12,899 --> 01:32:16,892
But what Mr. DeLaughter is going
to rely on is for you...

1333
01:32:17,103 --> 01:32:21,699
...to convict Mr. Beckwith
simply because of his opinions.

1334
01:32:22,308 --> 01:32:23,468
That's because...

1335
01:32:23,676 --> 01:32:28,136
...he knows that the state cannot prove
to you beyond a reasonable doubt...

1336
01:32:28,347 --> 01:32:30,907
...that the defendant committed
the crime.

1337
01:32:31,117 --> 01:32:33,449
By the time this trial is over...

1338
01:32:33,653 --> 01:32:37,316
...you will have seen it was
physically impossible...

1339
01:32:37,523 --> 01:32:40,617
...for Mr. Byron De La Beckwith
to have killed Medgar Evers.

1340
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,360
Mr. Beckwith is not guilty.

1341
01:32:43,563 --> 01:32:45,895
That's what the proof will show.

1342
01:32:46,499 --> 01:32:47,727
Thank you.

1343
01:32:49,635 --> 01:32:51,626
The state may call its first witness.

1344
01:32:52,905 --> 01:32:55,396
The state calls Myrlie Evers.

1345
01:33:08,387 --> 01:33:09,752
Raise your right hand.

1346
01:33:09,956 --> 01:33:11,981
Do you swear to tell the truth...

1347
01:33:12,191 --> 01:33:14,955
-...the whole truth, so help you God?
-I do.

1348
01:33:15,228 --> 01:33:16,525
Be seated.

1349
01:33:22,769 --> 01:33:24,532
Will you tell us your name?

1350
01:33:25,104 --> 01:33:27,197
My name is Myrlie Evers.

1351
01:33:27,406 --> 01:33:30,500
Going back to 1963,
were you married at that time?

1352
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:32,143
Yes, I was.

1353
01:33:32,345 --> 01:33:34,176
And to whom were you married?

1354
01:33:36,916 --> 01:33:38,781
Medgar Wylie...

1355
01:33:38,985 --> 01:33:40,475
...Evers.

1356
01:33:46,793 --> 01:33:49,785
When was the last time
you saw your husband alive?

1357
01:33:50,663 --> 01:33:53,359
June 11, 1963.

1358
01:33:55,034 --> 01:33:57,093
I'd fallen behind...

1359
01:33:57,303 --> 01:34:00,466
...in my housework
and got up early that morning...

1360
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:03,231
...to iron some shirts for Medgar.

1361
01:34:04,610 --> 01:34:06,100
By the time he woke...

1362
01:34:06,312 --> 01:34:10,646
...I had 10 freshly ironed shirts
neatly hung on hangers.

1363
01:34:12,185 --> 01:34:15,450
He said, "I thank you
for ironing these shirts...

1364
01:34:15,655 --> 01:34:17,418
...but I'm not going to need them."

1365
01:34:18,858 --> 01:34:22,851
Before he left for work that morning,
he kissed us all goodbye...

1366
01:34:23,262 --> 01:34:25,162
...and then left.

1367
01:34:26,532 --> 01:34:28,124
But then he came back...

1368
01:34:28,334 --> 01:34:30,427
...and took me aside.

1369
01:34:30,837 --> 01:34:33,328
He said, "If anything
should happen to me...

1370
01:34:33,539 --> 01:34:35,598
...I want you to promise me...

1371
01:34:35,808 --> 01:34:38,504
...you will take care of my babies."

1372
01:34:39,445 --> 01:34:42,812
I said, "Of course.
They're my babies too."

1373
01:34:45,251 --> 01:34:48,846
He then kissed us all
goodbye again and left.

1374
01:34:51,858 --> 01:34:54,258
Could you tell the jury
what you remember...

1375
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:58,419
...seeing and hearing when your husband
returned home that night?

1376
01:34:59,098 --> 01:35:02,625
It was just after midnight
when he got home.

1377
01:35:03,469 --> 01:35:05,300
We heard the car.

1378
01:35:13,746 --> 01:35:16,214
And then there was...

1379
01:35:20,553 --> 01:35:23,147
...this horrible blast.

1380
01:35:25,691 --> 01:35:27,318
The children...

1381
01:35:28,027 --> 01:35:31,258
...fell to the floor
as their father had taught them.

1382
01:35:32,265 --> 01:35:34,825
I bolted to the front door.

1383
01:35:36,202 --> 01:35:39,069
Medgar was lying in the carport.

1384
01:35:40,306 --> 01:35:42,831
He still had his keys in his hand.

1385
01:35:45,044 --> 01:35:47,410
Blood everywhere.

1386
01:35:49,148 --> 01:35:51,776
The children came out
shortly after I did...

1387
01:35:51,984 --> 01:35:53,849
...and they were screaming...

1388
01:35:54,854 --> 01:35:56,014
... "Daddy!

1389
01:35:57,056 --> 01:35:58,580
Daddy, get up!

1390
01:36:00,393 --> 01:36:02,361
Daddy, please get up."

1391
01:36:05,965 --> 01:36:08,866
But I knew he would
never get up again.

1392
01:36:13,873 --> 01:36:15,773
Nothing further, Your Honor.

1393
01:36:17,877 --> 01:36:22,940
Mr. McIntyre, have you ever owned
a 1917 Enfield.30-06 rifle?

1394
01:36:23,749 --> 01:36:24,943
Yes, I have.

1395
01:36:25,151 --> 01:36:27,881
Did you own that rifle in 1963?

1396
01:36:28,821 --> 01:36:33,622
Sometime, I believe in 1960,
I traded it to Mr. Beckwith.

1397
01:36:33,893 --> 01:36:37,954
Mr. McIntyre, I want to show you
this firearm and ask if you would...

1398
01:36:38,164 --> 01:36:41,395
...read the serial number
on the barrel, please.

1399
01:36:42,101 --> 01:36:46,037
1-0-5-2-6-8-2.

1400
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:50,299
Thank you. Going back to exhibit 35,
would you read the serial number...

1401
01:36:50,509 --> 01:36:52,977
...on the invoice of the gun
that you purchased...

1402
01:36:53,179 --> 01:36:55,238
...and later traded to Mr. Beckwith?

1403
01:36:55,448 --> 01:36:59,111
1-0-5-2-6-8-2.

1404
01:36:59,618 --> 01:37:03,987
Ms. Holder, were you at Joe's Drive-In
on the night of June 11, 1963?

1405
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:05,316
Yes, sir.

1406
01:37:05,524 --> 01:37:09,255
I wasn't working, but I was there
hanging out with my friends.

1407
01:37:09,762 --> 01:37:12,890
T ell the jury if there came
a time when your attention...

1408
01:37:13,099 --> 01:37:15,590
...was directed towards
any particular automobile.

1409
01:37:17,603 --> 01:37:20,333
Being a carhop, you notice cars.

1410
01:37:20,539 --> 01:37:23,702
This one had a long antenna
on the side of it.

1411
01:37:23,909 --> 01:37:26,343
We thought at first
it was a patrol car.

1412
01:37:26,979 --> 01:37:29,948
It was white and it had
a lot of mud on it.

1413
01:37:30,983 --> 01:37:32,780
It was a Plymouth Valiant.

1414
01:37:32,985 --> 01:37:37,752
Mr. Hargrove, were you employed by the
Jackson Police Department in June 1963?

1415
01:37:37,957 --> 01:37:39,686
Yes, I was.

1416
01:37:39,892 --> 01:37:43,623
In charge of the ldentification Division
for 42 years.

1417
01:37:43,829 --> 01:37:46,957
Did you reach a conclusion
as to whose fingerprint...

1418
01:37:47,166 --> 01:37:49,600
...was on the telescopic side
of the gun...

1419
01:37:49,802 --> 01:37:54,068
...recovered in your presence
on June 12, 1963?

1420
01:37:54,407 --> 01:37:55,669
Yes, sir. I did.

1421
01:37:55,875 --> 01:37:59,174
With 14 points of identification,
there's more than enough...

1422
01:37:59,378 --> 01:38:02,711
...to identify the fingerprint
of Mr. Byron De La Beckwith.

1423
01:38:03,015 --> 01:38:07,281
After four days of testimony in the
trial of white supremacist Beckwith...

1424
01:38:07,486 --> 01:38:10,887
...the prosecution, thus far, has
presented essentially the same case...

1425
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:12,387
...as was offered up
in the two original trials.

1426
01:38:14,326 --> 01:38:17,454
However, this time there are
two significant differences.

1427
01:38:17,663 --> 01:38:19,722
First, the makeup of the jury.

1428
01:38:19,932 --> 01:38:24,062
In 1964, Beckwith faced
two all-male, all-white juries.

1429
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:27,899
Today, he faces a jury made up
of eight blacks and four whites.

1430
01:38:28,107 --> 01:38:32,237
Tomorrow the prosecution is expected
to introduce three new witnesses...

1431
01:38:32,445 --> 01:38:35,107
... who did not testify
in the first two trials.

1432
01:38:37,283 --> 01:38:39,274
State your name for the record.

1433
01:38:39,485 --> 01:38:40,918
Delmar Dennis.

1434
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:43,520
Mr. Dennis, in March of 1964...

1435
01:38:43,722 --> 01:38:45,849
...were you a member
of an organization known as...

1436
01:38:46,058 --> 01:38:47,958
...the White Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan?

1437
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:49,286
I was.

1438
01:38:49,495 --> 01:38:51,019
In September of that year...

1439
01:38:51,230 --> 01:38:54,131
...did you become
a paid informant for the FBl?

1440
01:38:54,333 --> 01:38:55,595
I did.

1441
01:38:55,801 --> 01:38:57,701
And in your capacity as informant...

1442
01:38:57,903 --> 01:39:01,498
...did you ever encounter
the defendant, Byron De La Beckwith?

1443
01:39:02,208 --> 01:39:03,539
I did.

1444
01:39:04,543 --> 01:39:06,977
What were the circumstances
of that encounter?

1445
01:39:07,713 --> 01:39:10,841
On August 8, 1965,
I met Mr. Beckwith...

1446
01:39:11,050 --> 01:39:13,245
...at a Klan meeting
in Byram, Mississippi.

1447
01:39:13,519 --> 01:39:15,544
He was a featured speaker that night.

1448
01:39:16,388 --> 01:39:19,915
Now, during that talk, would you tell
the jury what, if anything...

1449
01:39:20,126 --> 01:39:24,620
...the defendant said about the murder
or shooting death of Medgar Evers.

1450
01:39:26,098 --> 01:39:29,067
He said, "Killing that nigger gave me
no more inner discomfort...

1451
01:39:29,268 --> 01:39:32,362
...than our wives endure
giving birth to our children.

1452
01:39:32,571 --> 01:39:34,471
We gotta kill those enemies...

1453
01:39:34,673 --> 01:39:37,665
...including the President,
from the top down."

1454
01:39:38,177 --> 01:39:39,667
Did he say anything else?

1455
01:39:39,979 --> 01:39:41,105
Yes, sir.

1456
01:39:41,313 --> 01:39:44,407
He said, "You're gonna get away
with it like I did."

1457
01:39:45,484 --> 01:39:47,315
Thank you, Mr. Dennis.

1458
01:39:47,653 --> 01:39:48,551
Your witness.

1459
01:39:52,858 --> 01:39:55,691
You have seen FBl reports
about your activities...

1460
01:39:55,895 --> 01:39:57,886
...as a paid informant, haven't you?

1461
01:39:58,430 --> 01:40:00,864
Mr. DeLaughter's office
furnished me with copies.

1462
01:40:01,066 --> 01:40:02,158
In fact, there are...

1463
01:40:02,368 --> 01:40:04,529
...pages and pages of dialogue...

1464
01:40:04,737 --> 01:40:07,171
...that you reported
to the FBl of things...

1465
01:40:07,439 --> 01:40:10,135
...that various people said
over lunch, over dinner...

1466
01:40:10,342 --> 01:40:13,834
...riding in cars, meetings.
Isn't that right?

1467
01:40:15,214 --> 01:40:18,240
Yet, nowhere in all those reports...

1468
01:40:18,450 --> 01:40:22,352
...does the quotation that you
attributed to Mr. Beckwith appear.

1469
01:40:22,555 --> 01:40:23,852
Does it?

1470
01:40:24,790 --> 01:40:27,190
Maybe the pages got lost
over the years.

1471
01:40:27,393 --> 01:40:29,486
And maybe they never existed.

1472
01:40:29,695 --> 01:40:30,627
Objection.

1473
01:40:30,829 --> 01:40:31,796
Sustained.

1474
01:40:32,231 --> 01:40:34,096
Dog ate my homework.

1475
01:40:35,134 --> 01:40:37,694
Mr. Dennis, did Byron De La Beckwith...

1476
01:40:37,903 --> 01:40:41,430
...ever specifically say
that he killed Medgar Evers?

1477
01:40:43,075 --> 01:40:45,976
He never said, "I killed
Medgar Evers. "That's true.

1478
01:40:46,178 --> 01:40:47,270
No further questions.

1479
01:40:47,479 --> 01:40:48,969
That's what he meant.

1480
01:40:49,181 --> 01:40:52,617
We ask that the witness's unsolicited
opinion be stricken...

1481
01:40:52,885 --> 01:40:55,115
...and that the jury disregard it.

1482
01:40:55,854 --> 01:40:59,620
The jury will disregard
Mr. Dennis' last statement.

1483
01:41:00,759 --> 01:41:05,196
I was standing out in the yard,
and he said something to me about...

1484
01:41:05,397 --> 01:41:08,833
...having been tried twice
in Mississippi...

1485
01:41:09,068 --> 01:41:10,626
...for "killing that nigger."

1486
01:41:10,836 --> 01:41:12,463
And what'd he say about that?

1487
01:41:12,671 --> 01:41:13,797
He said...

1488
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:17,265
... "I had a job to do and I did it."

1489
01:41:17,643 --> 01:41:20,237
Thank you, Mr. Prince.
Nothing further.

1490
01:41:23,015 --> 01:41:26,951
Back in 1986, when Mr. Beckwith
allegedly made this statement to you...

1491
01:41:27,152 --> 01:41:30,144
...you went straight
to the authorities, didn't you?

1492
01:41:31,323 --> 01:41:33,848
Well, you must've told
some of your buddies.

1493
01:41:35,027 --> 01:41:37,996
You didn't tell anybody you were
renting a house from a man...

1494
01:41:38,197 --> 01:41:40,597
...who admitted to you
that he'd killed somebody?

1495
01:41:40,866 --> 01:41:43,198
I didn't at that time, no.

1496
01:41:43,802 --> 01:41:46,600
Mr. and Mrs. Beckwith had you
thrown out of the house...

1497
01:41:46,805 --> 01:41:49,103
...because you had
a drinking problem, right?

1498
01:41:52,911 --> 01:41:55,379
I had a drinking problem...

1499
01:41:56,048 --> 01:41:57,538
...but that's not why they--

1500
01:41:57,750 --> 01:42:01,550
You don't particularly like Mr. Beckwith
for throwing you out, do you?

1501
01:42:03,589 --> 01:42:04,920
Mrs. Morgan...

1502
01:42:05,124 --> 01:42:09,083
...when you lived in Greenwood,
Mississippi in the early 1970s...

1503
01:42:09,295 --> 01:42:13,231
...did you and your husband give
the defendant a ride to Parchman Prison?

1504
01:42:13,465 --> 01:42:14,397
Yes, sir.

1505
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:18,036
Me and my husband, Lloyd, was going
to see Lloyd's brother...

1506
01:42:18,237 --> 01:42:19,636
...Jimmy Dale Morgan...

1507
01:42:19,838 --> 01:42:23,467
...and Mr. Beckwith was going to see
some friend of his...

1508
01:42:23,676 --> 01:42:25,837
...whose name he wouldn't tell us.

1509
01:42:26,178 --> 01:42:29,807
During that time, did he make
any statements concerning the murder...

1510
01:42:30,015 --> 01:42:31,482
...of Medgar Evers?

1511
01:42:32,117 --> 01:42:32,981
Yes, sir.

1512
01:42:33,185 --> 01:42:37,281
He said that he had killed
Medgar Evers, a nigger...

1513
01:42:37,489 --> 01:42:41,926
...and said we'd better not say anything
about us driving him up to Parchman...

1514
01:42:42,127 --> 01:42:44,891
...because he wasn't scared
to kill again.

1515
01:42:45,364 --> 01:42:46,558
Thank you, Mrs. Morgan.

1516
01:42:53,305 --> 01:42:55,865
You have had some
very traumatic things...

1517
01:42:56,075 --> 01:42:58,202
...happen to you in your life,
haven't you?

1518
01:42:58,544 --> 01:42:59,943
Most definitely.

1519
01:43:00,145 --> 01:43:01,772
Your estranged husband...

1520
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:04,608
...Lloyd Morgan, was
very abusive to you.

1521
01:43:04,817 --> 01:43:06,842
Objection. Irrelevant.

1522
01:43:07,619 --> 01:43:09,553
Where are you going with this?

1523
01:43:09,755 --> 01:43:11,120
If you'll allow me...

1524
01:43:11,323 --> 01:43:15,419
...this line of questioning speaks
directly to this witness's credibility.

1525
01:43:16,128 --> 01:43:17,117
Overruled.

1526
01:43:22,501 --> 01:43:24,662
Your husband, you told us...

1527
01:43:24,870 --> 01:43:29,239
...carried on an incestuous
relationship with one of his children.

1528
01:43:29,775 --> 01:43:31,242
Yes, he did.

1529
01:43:31,443 --> 01:43:33,138
And your father...

1530
01:43:33,345 --> 01:43:36,576
...was very abusive to you
when you were a child.

1531
01:43:37,483 --> 01:43:38,780
Yes, sir.

1532
01:43:39,017 --> 01:43:40,279
And as a result...

1533
01:43:40,552 --> 01:43:41,883
...of all this...

1534
01:43:42,121 --> 01:43:45,056
...you have been diagnosed
by psychiatrists...

1535
01:43:45,257 --> 01:43:47,452
...as having an anxiety disorder.

1536
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,551
Yes, sir, I have.

1537
01:43:52,231 --> 01:43:54,165
I have nothing further.

1538
01:43:55,567 --> 01:43:59,333
If this jury wants to believe
a lying drunk, a paid informant...

1539
01:43:59,538 --> 01:44:01,062
...and a damn loony bird...

1540
01:44:01,273 --> 01:44:03,264
...then I might be
in a bit of trouble.

1541
01:44:03,475 --> 01:44:04,965
But not as much trouble
as our beloved justice system.

1542
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:10,439
And this Prince fella
still owes me $ 64 worth of rent.

1543
01:44:10,649 --> 01:44:13,482
How do you account for
the matching numbers on the gun?

1544
01:44:13,685 --> 01:44:17,143
My rifle was stolen days
before this nigger turned up dead.

1545
01:44:17,356 --> 01:44:19,017
Turn those lights off.

1546
01:44:20,025 --> 01:44:23,017
Mom, how can you stand
watching this idiot?

1547
01:44:23,228 --> 01:44:24,752
When your father died...

1548
01:44:24,963 --> 01:44:27,488
...I carried around
such hatred for that man...

1549
01:44:27,699 --> 01:44:30,964
... I actually made inquiries
into having him killed.

1550
01:44:31,837 --> 01:44:34,931
But in time, I was able
to let that hatred go.

1551
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:36,573
I don't know how.

1552
01:44:36,775 --> 01:44:40,176
I remembered something
your father once said to me.

1553
01:44:40,379 --> 01:44:44,475
He said, "When you hate,
the only person who suffers is you.

1554
01:44:44,683 --> 01:44:46,548
Because most of the people you hate...

1555
01:44:46,752 --> 01:44:49,846
...don't know it
and the others don't care."

1556
01:44:50,255 --> 01:44:53,156
The big question here is
will Beckwith testify...

1557
01:44:53,358 --> 01:44:57,158
...as he did so confidently
back in 1964?

1558
01:44:59,998 --> 01:45:02,899
Everybody wants to see
the Byron De La Beckwith Show.

1559
01:45:03,101 --> 01:45:04,932
What if putting him on is too risky?

1560
01:45:05,137 --> 01:45:06,832
You kidding? He'll wanna tell
that cock-and-bull story...

1561
01:45:08,407 --> 01:45:11,240
...about his gun being stolen
two days before the murder.

1562
01:45:11,443 --> 01:45:15,345
Besides, this is Byron De La Beckwith
we're talking about.

1563
01:45:15,547 --> 01:45:17,913
Summoned from his mountain
by God Almighty...

1564
01:45:18,116 --> 01:45:20,584
...to give us
the word according to Delay.

1565
01:45:21,687 --> 01:45:22,915
He'll testify.

1566
01:45:23,322 --> 01:45:24,812
I'll see you upstairs.

1567
01:45:43,141 --> 01:45:46,076
Something happen to you in your boyhood
make you mean-spirited...

1568
01:45:46,278 --> 01:45:48,109
...enough to turn on your own?

1569
01:45:48,313 --> 01:45:52,875
Do what the good Lord and Mississippi
got every right to expect you to do.

1570
01:45:53,552 --> 01:45:54,382
Which is?

1571
01:45:54,586 --> 01:45:58,852
Putting niggers away for killing white
people instead of the other way around.

1572
01:45:59,057 --> 01:46:03,426
Mr. Peters and y'all should be run out
of this state for this foolishness...

1573
01:46:03,629 --> 01:46:05,221
...and y'all probably will be.

1574
01:46:06,498 --> 01:46:10,628
This is not some deer you brought down.
This is a human being.

1575
01:46:10,836 --> 01:46:14,704
A deer, Mr. DeLaughter,
is a beautiful animal.

1576
01:46:14,907 --> 01:46:16,465
It's one of God's creatures.

1577
01:46:16,675 --> 01:46:19,473
I would never kill a deer.

1578
01:46:19,611 --> 01:46:22,978
A nigger, on the other hand,
that's another matter entirely.

1579
01:46:23,348 --> 01:46:25,748
Are you standing here
admitting to me that you--

1580
01:46:26,118 --> 01:46:27,847
IKilled Medgar Evers?

1581
01:46:28,053 --> 01:46:29,714
What if I did?

1582
01:46:30,155 --> 01:46:33,647
It's not like there's anything you
nor anybody else can do about it.

1583
01:46:33,859 --> 01:46:34,951
Is there?

1584
01:46:35,827 --> 01:46:36,953
We'll see about that.

1585
01:46:37,162 --> 01:46:38,823
Oh, that we will.

1586
01:46:39,031 --> 01:46:40,658
That we will.

1587
01:46:42,668 --> 01:46:45,432
You know, it only takes
but one of them, doesn't it?

1588
01:46:45,871 --> 01:46:47,498
The question is...

1589
01:46:47,706 --> 01:46:49,003
...which one will it be?

1590
01:46:49,741 --> 01:46:52,574
Maybe that chubby white gal
who'd be sorely vexed...

1591
01:46:52,778 --> 01:46:57,181
...to let one of her own kind be
put away, no matter what she told you.

1592
01:46:57,616 --> 01:46:59,447
Or maybe that old nigger minister...

1593
01:46:59,651 --> 01:47:03,883
...who won't want sending a sick
old man to prison on his conscience.

1594
01:47:04,289 --> 01:47:09,226
You ain't never gonna get 12 people
to convict me of killing a nigger...

1595
01:47:09,461 --> 01:47:11,429
...in the state of Mississippi.

1596
01:47:11,630 --> 01:47:14,758
No, sir. Hell, I don't even have
to take the stand.

1597
01:47:14,967 --> 01:47:18,664
Couple more days, I'll be heading back
to my home in T ennessee...

1598
01:47:18,937 --> 01:47:20,871
...where I will sit on my porch...

1599
01:47:21,073 --> 01:47:24,804
...and live out my days
in peace and prosperity.

1600
01:47:25,477 --> 01:47:27,172
What are you gonna do?

1601
01:47:30,582 --> 01:47:32,277
What are you gonna do?

1602
01:47:32,784 --> 01:47:35,275
" Free at last, free at last.

1603
01:47:35,487 --> 01:47:38,456
Great God Almighty, I'm free at last!"

1604
01:47:42,294 --> 01:47:44,228
The defense calls James Holley.

1605
01:47:47,332 --> 01:47:49,357
Relax. He's just needling you.

1606
01:47:50,769 --> 01:47:51,167
He'll testify.

1607
01:47:53,872 --> 01:47:55,305
Raise your right hand.

1608
01:47:55,507 --> 01:47:59,739
You swear the testimony you'll give
is the whole truth, so help you God?

1609
01:47:59,945 --> 01:48:01,913
-I do.
-Be seated.

1610
01:48:04,249 --> 01:48:08,709
Mr. Holley, did you have a personal
relationship with the defendant?

1611
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:12,686
No, sir. None whatsoever.
I just kind of knew who he was.

1612
01:48:12,891 --> 01:48:15,985
Mr. Holley, in the early morning
of June 12th, 1963...

1613
01:48:16,194 --> 01:48:18,628
...did you have occasion
to see Mr. Beckwith?

1614
01:48:19,531 --> 01:48:21,795
He was standing outside
at a Shell station...

1615
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,525
...while the attendant was
putting gas in his car.

1616
01:48:24,836 --> 01:48:26,997
T ell the jury what time
you saw him.

1617
01:48:27,673 --> 01:48:30,301
At approximately 1:03 in the morning.

1618
01:48:31,043 --> 01:48:34,342
About how many miles is it
from Greenwood to Jackson?

1619
01:48:34,846 --> 01:48:38,873
Must be around 90, 95 miles.

1620
01:48:39,084 --> 01:48:42,542
So you saw the defendant
less than an hour after the murder...

1621
01:48:42,754 --> 01:48:47,453
...calmly standing by his car some 95
miles away from the scene of the crime?

1622
01:48:50,262 --> 01:48:52,059
I have nothing further.

1623
01:48:57,102 --> 01:48:58,228
Mr. Holley...

1624
01:48:58,437 --> 01:49:00,871
...on the night you say you saw...

1625
01:49:01,106 --> 01:49:03,870
...Byron De La Beckwith
in Greenwood....

1626
01:49:04,276 --> 01:49:07,074
Delay, as you call him, I believe.
Is that right?

1627
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:08,678
Delay Beckwith, yes, sir.

1628
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:12,372
Why do you call him Delay?
Are y'all first-name buddies?

1629
01:49:12,584 --> 01:49:16,111
No, sir. I call him Mr. Beckwith
most of the time.

1630
01:49:17,723 --> 01:49:18,747
We just noted...

1631
01:49:18,957 --> 01:49:21,357
... "Delay's car"
and "Delay and the attendant."

1632
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:24,757
Isn't that exactly what you told
me and my investigators...

1633
01:49:24,963 --> 01:49:27,557
...when we asked what you were
doing that night?

1634
01:49:28,967 --> 01:49:30,298
"Delay."

1635
01:49:30,969 --> 01:49:32,231
Your buddy.

1636
01:49:32,437 --> 01:49:33,961
My friend.

1637
01:49:34,573 --> 01:49:36,973
And how long has he been your friend?

1638
01:49:38,243 --> 01:49:41,144
-Just shortly after World War ll.
-When you said...

1639
01:49:41,346 --> 01:49:45,544
...you had no personal relationship
with him, that wasn't entirely true.

1640
01:49:45,751 --> 01:49:49,653
You've known him a long time and been
friends a long time, right?

1641
01:49:49,855 --> 01:49:51,948
Well, sure, we're friends.

1642
01:49:52,157 --> 01:49:54,318
Just like I hope
you and I are friends.

1643
01:49:56,595 --> 01:49:57,425
Pardon?

1644
01:49:57,662 --> 01:50:00,859
I said just like I would hope
you and I are friends.

1645
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:03,667
I'm flattered.

1646
01:50:06,238 --> 01:50:07,796
Let me ask you this.

1647
01:50:08,373 --> 01:50:10,466
At the time the defendant
was arrested...

1648
01:50:10,675 --> 01:50:13,337
...there were a whole lot
of law enforcement people...

1649
01:50:13,545 --> 01:50:16,013
...trying to gather
information, am I right?

1650
01:50:16,214 --> 01:50:17,943
FBl, Jackson Police.

1651
01:50:18,150 --> 01:50:19,515
Do you remember that?

1652
01:50:20,051 --> 01:50:21,143
Did you speak to...

1653
01:50:21,353 --> 01:50:24,015
...Detective Sanders,
one of the investigators?

1654
01:50:24,556 --> 01:50:26,353
I might've spoken a word with him.

1655
01:50:26,625 --> 01:50:31,028
Then you told him you saw Beckwith
in Greenwood the night of the killing.

1656
01:50:31,229 --> 01:50:32,662
-ls that right?
-I did not.

1657
01:50:34,065 --> 01:50:34,997
Why not?

1658
01:50:35,333 --> 01:50:37,426
I had no reason to tell
unless he asked.

1659
01:50:37,636 --> 01:50:41,800
You had no reason, as a sworn police
officer, to tell an investigator...

1660
01:50:42,007 --> 01:50:43,531
...in an important murder case...

1661
01:50:43,742 --> 01:50:48,145
...that you knew the suspect was 90
miles away at the time of the murder?

1662
01:50:48,346 --> 01:50:50,974
I'd have been butting
into his investigation--

1663
01:50:51,183 --> 01:50:54,983
You'd have been "butting into his
investigation "by telling him an alibi?

1664
01:50:55,587 --> 01:50:56,815
Sure.

1665
01:50:58,423 --> 01:51:01,586
Did you ever go to the D.A.
and tell them what was going on?

1666
01:51:02,394 --> 01:51:04,828
Did you tell the FBl
what was going on?

1667
01:51:05,730 --> 01:51:09,598
The only person you spoke to
about this case was Hardy Lott...

1668
01:51:09,801 --> 01:51:11,393
...Mr. Beckwith's defense attorney.

1669
01:51:11,603 --> 01:51:14,037
-When he called me--
-How long was...

1670
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:17,208
...the defendant in jail by then?
A couple of weeks?

1671
01:51:18,410 --> 01:51:20,002
I don't remember, exactly.

1672
01:51:21,313 --> 01:51:23,178
Well, let me help you out.

1673
01:51:23,815 --> 01:51:26,750
It was over eight months.

1674
01:51:27,185 --> 01:51:28,880
Eight months.

1675
01:51:29,087 --> 01:51:32,147
You let your buddy sit in jail
all that time...

1676
01:51:32,357 --> 01:51:35,554
...and never once told anyone,
"You've got the wrong guy."

1677
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:37,887
You're asking this jury
to believe that?

1678
01:51:38,797 --> 01:51:40,025
Yes, sir.

1679
01:51:43,668 --> 01:51:47,468
Earlier in your testimony, you said
that you and I are friends, right?

1680
01:51:47,906 --> 01:51:48,736
Said what?

1681
01:51:48,974 --> 01:51:51,875
That we're friends.
You and I are friends.

1682
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:56,080
You still think we're friends?

1683
01:51:57,282 --> 01:51:58,476
Sure.

1684
01:52:00,385 --> 01:52:02,910
As my friend, if I ever go
to jail for murder...

1685
01:52:03,121 --> 01:52:05,021
...don't leave me there
for eight months...

1686
01:52:05,223 --> 01:52:07,691
...if you know where I was
when the murder took place.

1687
01:52:07,893 --> 01:52:08,723
Objection!

1688
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:10,425
That was a thing of beauty.

1689
01:52:10,629 --> 01:52:11,755
Nothing further.

1690
01:52:11,963 --> 01:52:13,225
Will you redirect?

1691
01:52:13,431 --> 01:52:15,058
Thank you, Your Honor.

1692
01:52:16,434 --> 01:52:18,061
Would you lie for Mr. Beckwith?

1693
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:20,369
Did he ask you to?

1694
01:52:20,605 --> 01:52:24,097
As a former police officer,
you know perjury is a serious crime.

1695
01:52:25,043 --> 01:52:27,136
I'm gonna ask you this one last time.

1696
01:52:27,345 --> 01:52:29,779
On the night that Medgar Evers
was killed...

1697
01:52:29,981 --> 01:52:34,509
...did you or did you not see
Beckwith some 95 miles away...

1698
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:36,482
...from where the murder took place?

1699
01:52:38,223 --> 01:52:39,315
I saw him.

1700
01:52:39,524 --> 01:52:42,186
As God is your judge.

1701
01:52:43,595 --> 01:52:45,790
As God is my judge.

1702
01:52:46,665 --> 01:52:49,600
Thank you, Mr. Holley.
We have nothing further.

1703
01:52:52,871 --> 01:52:54,338
No further questions.

1704
01:52:55,674 --> 01:52:56,641
You may step down.

1705
01:53:00,578 --> 01:53:03,012
Is the defense prepared to call
its next witness?

1706
01:53:13,391 --> 01:53:14,585
Your Honor...

1707
01:53:14,926 --> 01:53:17,053
...the defense rests.

1708
01:53:18,530 --> 01:53:20,191
-What?
-Damn!

1709
01:53:21,499 --> 01:53:22,488
Quiet.

1710
01:53:24,202 --> 01:53:25,134
Ladies and gentlemen.

1711
01:53:25,470 --> 01:53:28,234
Quiet or I'll order the bailiff
to clear the courtroom.

1712
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:30,635
Coward to the end.

1713
01:53:34,946 --> 01:53:36,607
To my knowledge...

1714
01:53:36,815 --> 01:53:39,511
...this jury is being asked
to look further...

1715
01:53:39,718 --> 01:53:42,744
...into the past than any jury...

1716
01:53:43,455 --> 01:53:46,788
...in the history
of American jurisprudence.

1717
01:53:47,225 --> 01:53:51,594
That places you folks
at a considerable disadvantage.

1718
01:53:52,197 --> 01:53:55,166
Evidence has been lost.

1719
01:53:56,034 --> 01:53:58,093
They don't have the bullet.

1720
01:53:58,470 --> 01:54:02,770
They don't have the spent cartridge
case that was found in the gun.

1721
01:54:02,974 --> 01:54:06,967
They don't have the live ammunition
that was found in the gun.

1722
01:54:07,312 --> 01:54:08,836
Where is it?

1723
01:54:09,914 --> 01:54:11,575
Nobody knows.

1724
01:54:12,484 --> 01:54:15,009
Does this create reasonable doubt?

1725
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:17,083
Of course it does.

1726
01:54:17,922 --> 01:54:20,948
And you have heard a number
of witnesses testify...

1727
01:54:21,159 --> 01:54:24,560
...that years after the crime,
Mr. Beckwith said this...

1728
01:54:24,763 --> 01:54:26,754
...or Mr. Beckwith said that.

1729
01:54:27,032 --> 01:54:31,401
But the defense has presented you
with an eyewitness.

1730
01:54:31,603 --> 01:54:34,299
A sworn officer of the law...

1731
01:54:34,506 --> 01:54:38,875
...who has testified under oath
that he saw the defendant...

1732
01:54:39,077 --> 01:54:43,639
...in Greenwood, Mississippi,
over 90 miles from Jackson...

1733
01:54:43,848 --> 01:54:46,783
...Iess than an hour after the murder.

1734
01:54:48,386 --> 01:54:50,684
Does that create reasonable doubt?

1735
01:54:51,523 --> 01:54:53,150
You bet it does.

1736
01:54:53,858 --> 01:54:57,760
And reasonable doubt
means one thing...

1737
01:54:58,029 --> 01:54:59,860
...and one thing only.

1738
01:55:00,465 --> 01:55:01,864
By law...

1739
01:55:02,133 --> 01:55:05,796
...you must render
a not guilty verdict.

1740
01:55:06,604 --> 01:55:10,005
Forget that it's Byron "Delay" Beckwith.

1741
01:55:10,475 --> 01:55:13,933
Forget that you may not like him,
that you...

1742
01:55:14,145 --> 01:55:16,306
...may not agree with him.

1743
01:55:17,382 --> 01:55:19,213
Judge the evidence...

1744
01:55:19,851 --> 01:55:21,819
...and judge it fairly.

1745
01:55:22,821 --> 01:55:24,186
Because...

1746
01:55:24,389 --> 01:55:26,653
...in the United States...

1747
01:55:27,058 --> 01:55:31,324
...we don't do that for people
we just like and admire.

1748
01:55:32,497 --> 01:55:34,795
We do that for everybody...

1749
01:55:34,999 --> 01:55:36,364
...that's on trial...

1750
01:55:36,568 --> 01:55:38,866
...in an American court of law.

1751
01:55:39,604 --> 01:55:42,664
Because if the system doesn't work...

1752
01:55:42,874 --> 01:55:44,865
...for Byron De La Beckwith...

1753
01:55:45,076 --> 01:55:46,100
...it doesn't work...

1754
01:55:46,611 --> 01:55:48,238
...for anyone.

1755
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:52,973
I ask you to let the system work...

1756
01:55:54,519 --> 01:55:56,578
...and once and for all...

1757
01:55:56,921 --> 01:55:58,752
...find the defendant...

1758
01:55:59,090 --> 01:56:02,526
...Byron De La Beckwith,
not guilty.

1759
01:56:05,296 --> 01:56:06,763
Thank you.

1760
01:56:21,379 --> 01:56:23,370
An unarmed man...

1761
01:56:23,882 --> 01:56:27,181
...arrives home in the late hours
of the night...

1762
01:56:27,385 --> 01:56:30,183
...home to his family, his wife...

1763
01:56:30,388 --> 01:56:32,379
...and three small children...

1764
01:56:33,124 --> 01:56:35,217
...gets out of his car...

1765
01:56:35,793 --> 01:56:37,954
...and with his back turned...

1766
01:56:38,296 --> 01:56:40,787
...is gunned down by a coward.

1767
01:56:42,734 --> 01:56:44,599
That coward is...

1768
01:56:44,802 --> 01:56:46,394
...Byron De La Beckwith.

1769
01:56:47,572 --> 01:56:48,971
His gun.

1770
01:56:49,407 --> 01:56:50,772
His scope.

1771
01:56:50,975 --> 01:56:52,374
His fingerprint.

1772
01:56:52,577 --> 01:56:53,874
His car.

1773
01:56:54,078 --> 01:56:58,208
And lastly, but certainly not least,
his mouth.

1774
01:56:59,417 --> 01:57:01,282
When he thought he got away with it...

1775
01:57:01,486 --> 01:57:05,115
...he couldn't keep his mouth shut
with people he wanted to impress.

1776
01:57:05,323 --> 01:57:08,315
And now his venom has come back
to do him in...

1777
01:57:08,526 --> 01:57:10,153
...because, ladies and gentlemen...

1778
01:57:10,361 --> 01:57:13,853
...there is no statute
of limitations on murder.

1779
01:57:14,432 --> 01:57:17,060
The law doesn't say
that if you killed someone...

1780
01:57:17,268 --> 01:57:19,133
... 10 years ago or 20 years ago...

1781
01:57:19,337 --> 01:57:23,398
...or even 30 years ago,
that you don't have to pay the price.

1782
01:57:23,608 --> 01:57:27,567
The law doesn't say that if you are
50 years old or 60 years old...

1783
01:57:27,779 --> 01:57:31,738
...or 70 years old,
that you don't have to pay the price.

1784
01:57:31,950 --> 01:57:33,611
No man...

1785
01:57:34,452 --> 01:57:36,249
...is above the law.

1786
01:57:39,057 --> 01:57:40,820
And for what reason...

1787
01:57:41,025 --> 01:57:42,925
...was Medgar Evers' life taken?

1788
01:57:43,127 --> 01:57:47,427
For wanting some degree
of equality for himself...

1789
01:57:47,632 --> 01:57:49,998
...his family and his fellow man.

1790
01:57:50,201 --> 01:57:54,297
Ladies and gentlemen,
when that kind of murder happens...

1791
01:57:54,706 --> 01:57:56,970
...no matter who the victim...

1792
01:57:57,375 --> 01:57:59,673
...no matter what his race...

1793
01:57:59,877 --> 01:58:02,277
...there is a gaping wound...

1794
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:05,813
...Iaid open on society as a whole.

1795
01:58:07,819 --> 01:58:09,218
Justice...

1796
01:58:09,821 --> 01:58:11,812
...has sometimes been referred to...

1797
01:58:12,023 --> 01:58:13,991
...as the soothing balm
to be applied...

1798
01:58:14,192 --> 01:58:16,752
...to the wounds inflicted on society.

1799
01:58:16,961 --> 01:58:18,758
But when there is no justice...

1800
01:58:18,963 --> 01:58:22,228
...those wounds can never be cleansed.

1801
01:58:23,167 --> 01:58:26,398
Those wounds can never be healed.

1802
01:58:29,073 --> 01:58:31,507
When I addressed you
in my opening statement...

1803
01:58:31,709 --> 01:58:34,576
...I said that this was a simple case.

1804
01:58:34,779 --> 01:58:37,339
Well, I was right and I was wrong.

1805
01:58:37,682 --> 01:58:39,707
The evidence is simple...

1806
01:58:39,917 --> 01:58:41,976
...and the conclusion is
more than obvious.

1807
01:58:42,186 --> 01:58:43,778
But the reason we are all...

1808
01:58:43,988 --> 01:58:46,616
...sitting in this courtroom
so many years after...

1809
01:58:46,824 --> 01:58:49,520
...this disgraceful
assassination took place...

1810
01:58:49,761 --> 01:58:52,423
...is anything but simple.

1811
01:58:54,766 --> 01:58:56,734
President John F. Kennedy...

1812
01:58:56,934 --> 01:58:59,767
...in his landmark civil rights speech
to the nation...

1813
01:58:59,971 --> 01:59:04,340
...delivered on the very night
Medgar Evers was murdered, said...

1814
01:59:04,542 --> 01:59:08,273
... "We face a moral crisis
as a country...

1815
01:59:08,546 --> 01:59:10,036
...and as a people.

1816
01:59:10,948 --> 01:59:14,679
Those who do nothing are
inviting shame...

1817
01:59:14,886 --> 01:59:17,047
...as well as violence.

1818
01:59:17,355 --> 01:59:21,587
Those who act boldly are
recognizing right...

1819
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:24,851
...as well as reality."

1820
01:59:26,130 --> 01:59:29,293
Today, 30 years later...

1821
01:59:29,634 --> 01:59:31,966
...on behalf of the state
of Mississippi...

1822
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:36,971
...I'm asking you 12 ladies
and gentlemen to act boldly.

1823
01:59:37,241 --> 01:59:41,200
To hold this defendant accountable
and find him guilty...

1824
01:59:41,412 --> 01:59:43,437
...simply because it is right...

1825
01:59:43,648 --> 01:59:44,945
...it is just...

1826
01:59:45,149 --> 01:59:48,243
...and Lord knows, it is time.

1827
01:59:51,823 --> 01:59:53,154
Is it ever...

1828
01:59:53,725 --> 01:59:56,455
...too late to do the right thing?

1829
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:01,228
For the sake of justice...

1830
02:00:01,432 --> 02:00:05,493
...and for the hope of us
as a civilized society...

1831
02:00:06,604 --> 02:00:10,404
...I sincerely pray that it is not.

1832
02:00:13,811 --> 02:00:14,800
Thank you.

1833
02:00:17,448 --> 02:00:19,279
How long do you think they'll be out?

1834
02:00:19,617 --> 02:00:23,144
All I know is a short time is good
and a long time is...

1835
02:00:23,554 --> 02:00:24,452
...not so good.

1836
02:00:24,956 --> 02:00:26,890
Then I'll pray for a short time.

1837
02:00:29,026 --> 02:00:31,859
This reminds me of Medgar's office
on Lynch Street.

1838
02:00:32,063 --> 02:00:34,827
You know, I used to be
Medgar's secretary.

1839
02:00:35,933 --> 02:00:38,231
He insisted that we behave
in the office...

1840
02:00:38,436 --> 02:00:41,337
...strictly as employer-employee.

1841
02:00:41,539 --> 02:00:45,100
He'd call me Mrs. Evers,
and I'd have to call him Mr. Evers.

1842
02:00:45,309 --> 02:00:46,776
Is that right?

1843
02:00:47,211 --> 02:00:49,338
Everybody thought he was crazy.

1844
02:00:49,547 --> 02:00:52,846
But he was just so determined
to do a good job.

1845
02:00:56,554 --> 02:00:58,283
You remind me of Medgar.

1846
02:01:03,728 --> 02:01:05,161
Thank you, ma'am.

1847
02:01:06,330 --> 02:01:08,321
Would you like a cup of coffee?

1848
02:01:08,566 --> 02:01:09,760
No, thanks.

1849
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:15,736
As many trials as I've been through
and I can never take the waiting.

1850
02:01:16,174 --> 02:01:17,266
Wanna go for a walk?

1851
02:01:17,675 --> 02:01:20,769
No, you go ahead. I've gotten
pretty good at waiting.

1852
02:01:40,431 --> 02:01:41,898
That Judge Hilburn...

1853
02:01:42,099 --> 02:01:43,794
...he don't have a lot of patience.

1854
02:01:44,001 --> 02:01:46,765
That jury ain't back with a verdict
in a few hours...

1855
02:01:46,971 --> 02:01:48,336
...he'll declare a mistrial.

1856
02:01:48,539 --> 02:01:50,302
I'm not sure I got that.

1857
02:01:50,508 --> 02:01:53,341
Would you mind repeating that,
please?

1858
02:01:53,544 --> 02:01:55,307
You did say mistrial, didn't you?

1859
02:01:55,513 --> 02:01:56,741
I'm gonna snooch you.

1860
02:02:12,830 --> 02:02:14,058
All rise.

1861
02:02:32,850 --> 02:02:34,784
When the verdict is read...

1862
02:02:34,986 --> 02:02:37,352
...there will be no demonstrations...

1863
02:02:37,555 --> 02:02:40,547
...or any emotional outbursts
of any type.

1864
02:03:05,850 --> 02:03:08,045
Has the jury reached a verdict?

1865
02:03:08,753 --> 02:03:10,084
It has, Your Honor.

1866
02:03:10,288 --> 02:03:12,222
If the bailiff will hand me
the verdict.

1867
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:40,075
I'll ask the jury at this time
to stand and face the defendant.

1868
02:03:44,255 --> 02:03:46,155
The defendant will face the jury.

1869
02:03:54,398 --> 02:03:56,866
The jury foreman will now
read the verdict.

1870
02:03:58,970 --> 02:04:00,198
We the jury...

1871
02:04:00,404 --> 02:04:01,803
...find the defendant...

1872
02:04:02,006 --> 02:04:06,136
...Byron De La Beckwith,
guilty as charged.

1873
02:04:13,985 --> 02:04:15,646
-Quiet in this courtroom.
-Guilty.

1874
02:04:49,553 --> 02:04:52,750
Mrs. Evers, how did you feel
when the verdict came in?

1875
02:05:14,979 --> 02:05:18,471
It's been a long journey.

1876
02:05:21,686 --> 02:05:24,849
Medgar, I've gone the last mile
of the way.

1877
02:05:26,357 --> 02:05:29,417
I've gone the last mile of the way.

1878
02:05:31,829 --> 02:05:33,820
And all I want to say...

1879
02:05:34,398 --> 02:05:36,559
...is yea, Medgar!

1880
02:05:37,559 --> 02:05:47,559
