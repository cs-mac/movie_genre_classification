1
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,438
Leon!

2
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,156
This is Car 4 requesting assistance
to Schou's Square. We hit someone.

3
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,832
- Hi, Ella. Did you call?
- Yes.

4
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,791
Everything OK?
Sleep tight.

5
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,029
Want the door closed,
or cracked open?

6
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,199
This idiot tried to
hang a poster in my room!

7
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,229
- What happened to you?
- Let him go.

8
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,036
Be nice. Whatever you do to Leon,
you also do to me.

9
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,792
- You're my guardian angel.
- Knock it off, Leon.

10
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,069
- What have I done?
- If Åsa is in town, you'll meet her.

11
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,991
She may not come.
She may have forgotten me.

12
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,391
How could she forget you, Leon?

13
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,037
What do I do, when I meet her?

14
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,358
You'll just have to
tell her the truth.

15
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,350
I'll be Åsa.
Say it to me.

16
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,473
Three words.
Three words, Leon. Come on.

17
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,313
Look at me, Leon.

18
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,274
If you can't say it to me,
how can you say it to her?

19
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,317
Who's the biggest hero, Leon?

20
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,359
Sleep now.
Rest up for your big day tomorrow.

21
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,875
Vidar?

22
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,559
Can't you just
take my place tomorrow?

23
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,589
Who's the biggest hero?

24
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,194
- Leon, Leon, Leon.
- Now go to sleep.

25
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,638
ÅSA, DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

26
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:48,592
The weather in Oslo will be nice,
with temperatures over 30 degrees.

27
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:56,751
There is a chance of thunderstorms
later in the afternoon.

28
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,390
Winds will be from the northeast.
The weather in eastern Norway...

29
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,437
I've never seen him so upset.

30
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,391
He expects to meet Åsa, but I
have dreamt that she won't show up.

31
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,556
Stop it! He just went running.
He always comes back.

32
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,868
I never have time to do anything
before it's too late.

33
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,875
Take my shift for me.
That's all I ask.

34
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,314
Dorte, I have to find Leon!

35
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,273
When does he ever sleep?

36
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,950
Remember when Vidar got drunk
at the Christmas party?

37
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,272
He told me
his grandfather was going to fall.

38
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,956
He called his grandfather
to warn him.

39
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,070
As the phone rang, his grandfather
fell, broke his neck, and died.

40
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,912
You're the paper girl, right?

41
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,755
You probably know
everyone around here.

42
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,750
You have keys
and can open all kinds of doors.

43
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,957
Can you deliver this for me?

44
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,233
- Where the hell have you been?
- Please?

45
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,872
- Where have you been?
- Please!

46
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,196
What are you up to?

47
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,920
Mikkel!

48
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,196
What are you staring at, fuckface?

49
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,314
You talking to me?

50
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,393
I'm just looking for someone.

51
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,514
Have you seen him?

52
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,235
That stroke patient...

53
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,190
He stood in that 10th floor window
to wave to his sons.

54
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,716
He got dizzy, fell out, and died.

55
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,750
The oldest son, who had waved,
thought it was his fault.

56
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,872
But the window latch was broken.

57
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,034
Stroke patients get dizzy.
So whose fault was it?

58
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,557
The window,
the hospital, the patient himself...

59
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,159
But it wasn't your fault!
You just wanted to wave to your dad!

60
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,671
How could he know.

61
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,918
Hello?

62
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,080
Hello?

63
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,988
- It's a...
- Don't tell me. It's a boy.

64
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,513
Yes!
It's a boy!

65
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,992
Thanks for your help!
It's a boy! I have a son!

66
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,439
Milla!

67
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,799
- You haven't hit anyone?
- No, we haven't.

68
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,988
- Is this a first for you?
- No, I've delivered several babies.

69
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,558
Are you ready
to cut the umbilical cord?

70
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,633
- The umbilical cord?
- Yes.

71
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,233
You can do it.
Come on!

72
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,951
He looks just fine.

73
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,352
Take these.

74
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,632
Just cut right between here.

75
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,954
It's OK.
Go ahead and cut.

76
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,598
Excellent.

77
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,716
Come to mommy.

78
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,115
You never know
how long you'll get together.

79
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,469
I dreamt that you drove
through town in this ambulance.

80
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,509
I dreamt that you were driving.
I knew it was a boy!

81
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,513
Are you OK?

82
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,871
Have you seen this person?

83
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,673
He was supposed to get run over.
Tonight.

84
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,432
Remember to cherish this moment.
Every moment.

85
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,189
- What do you mean by that?
- Cherish the moment.

86
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,837
What do you think we're doing?
We're cherishing!

87
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,479
- Get him out of here!
- Calm down.

88
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:11,235
We have a person with low
respiration at 4B Copenhagen Street.

89
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,799
Car 7 is on its way.

90
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,475
4B Copenhagen Street?

91
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,359
- Do you think it's her?
- Not necessarily.

92
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,354
- But it could be her.
- It isn't.

93
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,114
This is car 4.
We're near Copenhagen St.

94
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,155
- You go first. Car 7 can take over.
- Roger.

95
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,077
- Has someone been run over?
- Isn't this our ambulance?

96
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,833
What did they mean
by "respiration"?

97
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,432
Let's go home, Mikkel.
The cops could come...

98
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,998
How many posters
has that guy hung up?

99
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,476
OUR BELOVED FATHER, MORTEN
FRANCK, PASSED AWAY TODAY

100
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,877
Hi.

101
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,319
- Did you find her?
- Yes.

102
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,314
- Is she awake?
- No, I don't think so.

103
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,756
Can you hear me?
Hello? Hello!

104
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,436
- Do you know what she has taken?
- No.

105
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,672
- Have you taken anything?
- No.

106
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,834
Give her some air.

107
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,112
Hello?

108
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,191
What do we have?

109
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,868
Probable OD. Weak respiration.
No reaction to pain stimuli.

110
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,069
- Has she been awake?
- She found her.

111
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,353
- Helped clear her airways.
- Excellent.

112
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,599
Know how I met her the first time?

113
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,349
Just like this.

114
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,079
Hey!

115
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,796
Mikkel!

116
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,150
Calm down!
Hey!

117
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,518
Look at me!

118
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,190
Yeah?

119
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:48,109
Why are you calling now?
It's the middle of the night.

120
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,353
I'll talk to Erland.
I'll call you.

121
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,872
You hear what I'm saying?
Good.

122
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,718
Take care of it by tomorrow.

123
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,354
Are you hot?

124
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,475
- Want something to sleep on?
- I can't sleep anyway.

125
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,354
I have a little brother too.
I know what it's like.

126
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,510
Try to get some sleep.

127
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,435
- Anything else you need?
- No thanks.

128
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,395
Have you ever
seen anything so beautiful?

129
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,877
Look at all this equipment.

130
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,797
- This huge room for yourself.
- Not just for me.

131
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,115
I get to share it with him.

132
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:59,191
- They've checked for hepatitis.
- They need all this stuff for that?

133
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,714
This is an Aaron.

134
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,389
- No, he's a Jim.
- No way.

135
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,195
He's an Aaron.
Look.

136
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,354
He's an Aaron.

137
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,188
- Stian Lonnberg.
- Frode. The father.

138
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,189
Hi there!

139
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:39,712
We'd like you to have a word
with doctor Krogh.

140
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,158
The tests we took on your son
last night and this morning -

141
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,990
have given us
some unfortunate surprises.

142
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,633
It appears as if
your son has a heart defect.

143
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,868
It's difficult to explain.
It has to do with -

144
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,158
decreased blood flow.

145
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,916
When the child is born,
its ties to the mother are broken.

146
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,358
The child has to adapt
to life outside the womb.

147
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,798
Complications arise when the child
is unable to handle this.

148
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,192
With his mother's help
he has done fine in the womb.

149
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,514
But once he is born
and on his own, he has a problem.

150
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,670
We can create an artificial
connection through an IV tube.

151
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,391
But that would be unbearable
for the child.

152
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,159
This is a rare heart defect.

153
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,388
But unfortunately
it is not possible -

154
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,394
to operate on such a small child.

155
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:02,554
Even if we choose to
keep the child alive through an IV, -

156
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,714
we have to assume his lifespan
will be dramatically reduced.

157
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,077
"Dramatically reduced"?
What do you mean?

158
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:17,156
It's difficult to say. He will
suffer gradual multi-organ failure.

159
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,109
He will most likely
not survive more than 3-4 days.

160
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,319
If there's anything you...

161
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,193
We'll come back to you.

162
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,674
Hello!

163
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,358
There must be something you can do.
Something!

164
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,873
As Dr. Krogh said,
there is nothing we can do.

165
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,550
- Nothing you can do?
- No.

166
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,034
Just about anything can be fixed
today. There has to be something.

167
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,309
People get pig hearts and survive.
There has to be some expert, -

168
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:07,590
someone willing to take
responsibility, somewhere!

169
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,149
Not in this case.

170
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,996
So what happens now?

171
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,115
Do we just let him lie there?

172
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,036
Did you see Vidar?

173
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,920
Vidar?

174
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,398
- Is something wrong?
- He went looking for you.

175
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,156
Looking for me?
Why?

176
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,233
He said he had dreamt something.

177
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,589
He didn't dream
that Åsa isn't coming, did he?

178
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,874
I'll call him
and tell him you're back.

179
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,949
He's so tired.

180
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,993
Vidar's phone.
I'm sure he'll be fine.

181
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,430
Leon...

182
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,030
Happy birthday.

183
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,075
Thank you.

184
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,558
Get moving, Trygve!

185
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,714
A 12-hour furlough.
It's a pretty short time out there.

186
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,073
Thanks to you,
I get to celebrate my brother.

187
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,917
- It's because you're a good guy.
- You did this for me, John.

188
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,796
Well before my time.

189
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:23,349
It only took 20 minutes with
the brass before everyone agreed.

190
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,678
And I mean everyone.
Understand?

191
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,833
Come on...

192
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,669
You all dressed up?

193
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,429
Thanks for doing this for me.

194
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,039
You're a good man.

195
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,390
Who's coming?

196
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,394
Who's escorting me?

197
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,992
Hope it's not one of the rookies.

198
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,836
We wouldn't let you out
on escorted leave with rookies.

199
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,232
I've worked something out.
Hope you'll be pleased.

200
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,517
You have twelve minutes.

201
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,910
Enjoy your weekend!

202
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,080
Good luck, Trygve.

203
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,478
- Hi...
- Hello.

204
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,075
- You'll only have one escort.
- How did you manage that?

205
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,233
I trust you.
So they trust you too.

206
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,676
Who's it going to be?

207
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,238
Hey...

208
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,872
Come on.

209
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,194
- You all dressed up?
- We're going to a birthday party.

210
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,029
- Are you home alone?
- Yes.

211
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,428
Do you live here?

212
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,396
Where are your parents?

213
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,679
Have you traveled far
to meet that guy?

214
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,559
Pretty far.

215
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,914
What do you do?

216
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,634
I'm a stewardess.

217
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,873
I travel.
All the time.

218
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,712
Can I have my purse?

219
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,911
I need my purse.

220
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:37,838
She's here to meet a boyfriend
she hasn't seen for eleven years.

221
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:44,473
They agreed to get married
if they were still single at 25.

222
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,959
Can I have my purse?

223
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,310
What's going on here?

224
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,390
We're going to our dad's funeral.

225
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,398
No, we aren't!

226
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,156
Dad got sick this summer.
We have to go to an orphanage.

227
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,437
Or be split up with families.

228
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,115
Will you relax?

229
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,273
Here. Take your purse.
And get lost!

230
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,030
Shut up!

231
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,874
Hey...

232
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,110
Good to see you again, Mads.
How's it going?

233
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,515
I took care of everything.

234
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,555
Hawaii, Trygve?

235
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:21,068
Trygve's brother thinks Trygve's
in Hawaii when he's locked up.

236
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,434
Please...
It's the welfare workers...

237
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,349
Mikkel?

238
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,913
Mikkel?

239
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,835
Mikkel, take it easy.

240
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,354
- Put that knife down.
- Do it, Mikkel.

241
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,432
Look at me,
and put the knife down. OK?

242
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,592
I know you're not stupid.
This will just make matters worse.

243
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,629
- OK?
- Do as she says.

244
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:37,433
Are you OK, Magne? Look at me.
What are you doing?

245
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,110
Do you know them?
What are you...

246
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,350
What are you doing here?

247
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,273
My name is Åsa.

248
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,032
I came to Oslo today
to visit an old boyfriend.

249
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:01,194
But then I lost my purse.
That's when I met Magne.

250
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,156
...Mikkel just misunderstood.

251
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,198
This is Leon!

252
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,195
I need to ask you something.

253
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,195
- Are you going to the funeral?
- We're staying here.

254
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,389
Can't we go, Mikkel?

255
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,476
Please?

256
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,674
I didn't recognize you
out of uniform.

257
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,310
- I'm off duty.
- Did you hit anyone?

258
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,873
- Fortunately not.
- Did you save the unconscious person?

259
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:22,156
Her?
Maybe. Almost.

260
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,798
Did you find the guy
you were looking for?

261
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,877
Do you ever visit
the people you save?

262
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,670
Are you crazy?
Visit the people I pick up?

263
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:45,073
Go visit her.
The woman you almost saved.

264
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,036
Never stop saving.

265
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,076
There's one button on the outside,
one on the inside.

266
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,118
Cool.

267
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,070
Hi.

268
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,438
Hi there.

269
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,953
It's been a while.

270
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,919
Four years.

271
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,310
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

272
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,033
Here.

273
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,670
- Nice.
- Thank you.

274
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:22,115
- Did you come straight from Hawaii?
- Yes. Last night.

275
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,069
Solely
to celebrate your birthday, Leon.

276
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,039
Was it cloudy in Hawaii?

277
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,637
Haven't you ever heard of sunblock?

278
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,558
Hawaii?

279
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:44,716
Trygve imports flowers to Hawaii.
They need so many leis there.

280
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,590
- I know a guy with a plant nursery.
- Outside Oslo.

281
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,957
And we fly them over there.

282
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,994
That's my brother!

283
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,233
- What are you bringing?
- Bringing?

284
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,519
I'm taking you out.
You don't turn 25 every day.

285
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,229
I want to stay here.
Åsa's coming.

286
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,551
Who's that?

287
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:19,431
Åsa. I've told you about her.
She saved me from the wave machine.

288
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:25,789
When I was down on the bottom.
Don't you remember?

289
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,830
Of course I do. She's all you've
talked about since eighth grade!

290
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:40,155
Leon has hung up posters.
You've probably seen them already.

291
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,476
We can't wait in here in vain
on your 25th birthday.

292
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,151
Maybe we could wait a little?

293
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,672
We bought a cake,
and maybe we'll sing for you.

294
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:05,675
You plan to keep him in here
on his birthday? You can't sit here.

295
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,233
- They just called them.
- Who?

296
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,632
A private clinic.
They can do the operation.

297
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:28,828
They've performed almost
the exact same operation before.

298
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:35,115
- Almost the same operation?
- Yes! We're gonna do it!

299
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,595
I just spoke to
the clinic over there.

300
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:57,199
They can perform the operation if
you meet the financial requirements.

301
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,351
Do we have to pay?

302
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,833
There is nothing we can do,
officially.

303
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,950
- We can't guarantee the results...
- They've had one success.

304
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:17,513
You need to understand that
it is a private hospital.

305
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,115
They insist on
a financial guarantee.

306
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,953
How much will it cost?

307
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,590
Relax, Milla.
Money is no problem.

308
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:35,038
It will cost 900,000.

309
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,437
Transportation,
room and board is additional.

310
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:47,353
We need an answer by 9 p.m. tonight
in order to make it.

311
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,590
- Where is this hospital?
- In America.

312
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,550
That's where everything happens.
We're gonna do it!

313
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,350
What should we do?

314
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:09,196
I have never heard of this clinic.

315
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:14,833
I wouldn't do it
even if I had the money in the bank.

316
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,309
I'm sorry.

317
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,510
900,000 divided by 10 is 90,000.

318
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:33,152
90,000 divided by 60 minutes is...

319
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:39,799
That's 1500 kroner.
1500 kroner per minute.

320
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,193
You're an expensive baby, Aaron.

321
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,432
Frode, don't go anywhere.

322
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,672
This is my only chance.
Understand?

323
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,673
They have done the operation before.

324
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,389
Don't, Frode. You've tried
to arrange things before.

325
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:01,439
This time it's different, Milla.
It's our only chance.

326
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:07,436
This is something you can't fix.
You can't fix this.

327
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:15,159
If these are his last hours,
I don't want you wasting them away!

328
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,315
This is our only chance
to get to know our boy, Frode.

329
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,035
This is our only chance
to fix his heart, Milla.

330
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,354
And if we fix that, we'll
have him for the rest of our life!

331
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,750
Frode!

332
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,800
What a place!

333
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,432
I have to wait here.

334
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,990
What if Åsa comes and I'm not here?

335
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,039
- Or if Vidar comes...
- Listen to yourself!

336
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,873
If Åsa comes here, -

337
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,318
that lady will call me
on my cell phone. OK?

338
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:16,039
Let's go.
OK?

339
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,519
Wait here.

340
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,593
- Vidar told me to wear this suit.
- Relax.

341
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:44,029
- No one gets to see me naked!
- I'm taking off your shirt and tie.

342
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,753
Take care of this for me, OK?

343
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,517
There.

344
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,109
Do you still run?

345
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,950
A little?

346
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,111
Happy birthday to you...

347
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,673
- Happy birthday.
- Hi, Mads.

348
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,834
- This is my friend John.
- Leon.

349
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,112
Have a beer, Leon.
You deserve it.

350
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,511
Vidar says
intoxicants dull the senses.

351
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,559
Aren't we proof of the opposite?

352
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,678
I'm the one who...

353
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,638
I saved you.

354
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,558
What time is it?

355
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,834
Careful.

356
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,548
- Want me to call for help?
- No!

357
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,758
You can't go anywhere now.

358
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,354
I'm OK.

359
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:39,274
A guarantee? What do you mean?
I just explained my situation.

360
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:46,397
We need an asset-based guarantee
so we know we'll get our money back.

361
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:52,635
I need to borrow assets. If I had
any assets, I wouldn't need a loan.

362
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,349
I understand.
All right.

363
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,712
I'm sorry.

364
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,956
But I've been
a customer here for years.

365
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,234
You've defaulted too many times.

366
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,750
Please.

367
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,437
I'm sorry.

368
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,877
- Can't you please help me?
- I'm sorry.

369
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,078
Have you ever been robbed?

370
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,670
Have you ever been robbed?
Have you?

371
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:04,436
This is just what it feels like.

372
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:10,432
You are robbing my baby from me.
That's what it feels like!

373
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,955
Hi!

374
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,148
So you're Leon?

375
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,431
- Who is this?
- Susanne. Let the birthday begin!

376
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,752
It's your birthday?
Get anything nice?

377
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,908
- I got this.
- Susanne, want a hot dog?

378
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,193
Of course Susanne wants a hot dog!

379
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,393
- Stop it!
- It isn't dangerous.

380
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,476
This won't hurt.

381
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,512
Help me, Trygve.

382
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,874
It isn't dangerous.

383
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,152
- Help me, Trygve.
- Run!

384
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,993
- Run!
- No, I can't.

385
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,311
Run, dammit!

386
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,470
Let go of him!

387
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,833
- Leon!
- Trygve!

388
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:11,157
I have to run after him.
No one else can stop him.

389
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,995
- You have to trust me.
- Fine. Hurry!

390
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:23,394
When Leon becomes unsure, he runs.
He's always been like that.

391
01:00:39,173 --> 01:00:42,086
Run!

392
01:00:44,294 --> 01:00:46,445
Run!

393
01:00:51,576 --> 01:00:53,772
Shit!

394
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:08,093
- Did you want me to run?
- No.

395
01:01:08,261 --> 01:01:11,537
Hi, it's me.

396
01:01:13,182 --> 01:01:16,698
I'll be there in about a half-hour.

397
01:01:16,863 --> 01:01:21,335
What?
Did you take care of the passport?

398
01:01:22,065 --> 01:01:25,263
You said... run...

399
01:01:27,186 --> 01:01:33,786
When some things are right,
other things may seem wrong.

400
01:01:37,508 --> 01:01:40,547
I want to go back to Karibu.

401
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:43,459
We're getting out of here.

402
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:46,748
Far from here.

403
01:01:46,952 --> 01:01:51,025
Get it?
We're leaving. You and I.

404
01:01:56,074 --> 01:01:59,067
What were you thinking?

405
01:01:59,234 --> 01:02:03,024
It was his brother.

406
01:02:03,195 --> 01:02:07,076
He came on a surprise visit
from Hawaii.

407
01:02:07,517 --> 01:02:11,397
His brother is in prison
for armed robbery!

408
01:02:11,998 --> 01:02:14,877
Calm down, Vidar.

409
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,079
- I'll have to report this.
- What?

410
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,994
You pose a threat
to the patients. You scare them.

411
01:02:24,201 --> 01:02:27,274
Go ahead.
It will be over by then.

412
01:02:27,482 --> 01:02:32,034
Let's get to the bottom of this.

413
01:02:32,444 --> 01:02:36,563
- So Åsa does not exist?
- She won't show up.

414
01:02:36,764 --> 01:02:42,363
And Leon is going to be
hit by a car and killed.

415
01:02:45,327 --> 01:02:49,162
Karibu, level B2.
Dorte speaking.

416
01:02:50,848 --> 01:02:53,488
Yes.

417
01:02:53,929 --> 01:02:57,240
Yes, he lives here.

418
01:02:59,891 --> 01:03:03,123
All right.
Good-bye.

419
01:03:07,213 --> 01:03:09,568
That was Åsa.

420
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:16,053
We are to tell Leon
that she is waiting for him.

421
01:03:17,456 --> 01:03:20,414
At Hawaii.

422
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,297
Impossible.

423
01:03:37,461 --> 01:03:40,215
Don't screw this up, Vidar.

424
01:03:40,382 --> 01:03:45,777
This may be Leon's only chance
to meet someone from outside.

425
01:03:55,906 --> 01:03:58,216
Is this it?

426
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:01,501
Yes, that's it.

427
01:04:03,588 --> 01:04:07,582
That's Kurt Cobain's.
He was a lefty too.

428
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:12,507
Put that in the front seat.

429
01:04:16,031 --> 01:04:19,741
You can keep the baby gear.

430
01:04:20,393 --> 01:04:24,069
It isn't for sale anyway.

431
01:04:41,799 --> 01:04:44,313
55,000, for all of it.

432
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,156
Lend me 400,000.

433
01:04:52,682 --> 01:04:57,199
I need to borrow 400,000.
Please.

434
01:04:58,763 --> 01:05:02,962
I can't, Frode.
You know that.

435
01:05:04,805 --> 01:05:09,196
Your project last year...
You still owe money.

436
01:06:22,946 --> 01:06:26,144
Excuse me.
Are you Åsa?

437
01:06:27,187 --> 01:06:30,498
- Yes.
- Did you call for Leon?

438
01:06:30,908 --> 01:06:33,946
Yes.
Who are you?

439
01:06:34,108 --> 01:06:36,623
Vidar.
A friend.

440
01:06:53,394 --> 01:06:56,034
I don't know...

441
01:06:56,235 --> 01:07:00,195
It was a deal we made ages ago.

442
01:07:01,676 --> 01:07:05,557
The world's most naive project.

443
01:07:08,918 --> 01:07:12,548
I just came to a point...

444
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,917
I gave up on everyone else.

445
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,634
And then I thought...

446
01:07:26,203 --> 01:07:30,038
Then I started thinking about Leon.

447
01:07:30,284 --> 01:07:33,960
I never forgot his birthday...

448
01:07:35,446 --> 01:07:38,917
I never forgot his birthday.

449
01:07:46,968 --> 01:07:50,644
I didn't think
he was going to meet you.

450
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:55,448
I thought something terrible
would happen.

451
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:58,172
Something terrible?

452
01:07:59,692 --> 01:08:02,161
I dreamt it.

453
01:08:07,094 --> 01:08:09,609
Dreamt it?

454
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:31,929
If you're here, he will come.

455
01:08:33,381 --> 01:08:37,170
I'm glad you are real.

456
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:44,460
I don't want to disturb
if... when he comes.

457
01:08:44,624 --> 01:08:47,741
It was nice to meet you.

458
01:08:51,185 --> 01:08:53,223
Hello?

459
01:08:53,946 --> 01:08:56,859
Dorte who?

460
01:08:57,027 --> 01:09:01,544
A girl called for you.

461
01:09:04,549 --> 01:09:07,144
Hello?

462
01:09:09,631 --> 01:09:13,102
Hawaii?

463
01:09:14,432 --> 01:09:17,390
A bar called Hawaii?

464
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:20,422
Here in town?

465
01:09:25,275 --> 01:09:27,153
Bye.

466
01:09:32,397 --> 01:09:34,958
It's her.

467
01:09:37,278 --> 01:09:41,876
I need to take care of something,
then I'll help you.

468
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,355
I promise.

469
01:09:48,241 --> 01:09:53,680
- Do you know where Hawaii is?
- In the middle of the Pacific.

470
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:02,159
Of course I know where it is.

471
01:10:03,965 --> 01:10:06,036
OK?

472
01:11:43,153 --> 01:11:46,543
Would you please stop crying?

473
01:11:54,516 --> 01:11:57,508
It's you, isn't it?

474
01:12:00,277 --> 01:12:02,552
You sing like an angel.

475
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:06,597
Want to go to McDonald's first?

476
01:12:06,758 --> 01:12:10,229
- Before what?
- Mikkel...

477
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:16,674
I knew it. You couldn't find us
some fucking wannabe family!

478
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:22,314
We're going to McDonald's
before we get split up!

479
01:12:22,483 --> 01:12:27,605
- We can't talk here.
- This is the last I'll see of him.

480
01:12:27,804 --> 01:12:32,357
Before we get locked up
in two separate fucking orphanages!

481
01:12:32,525 --> 01:12:37,806
Don't you get it?
Then we'll have no one. No one.

482
01:12:37,967 --> 01:12:39,878
No one left!

483
01:12:40,048 --> 01:12:45,203
Don't you understand
that you can't do this?!

484
01:12:47,249 --> 01:12:50,447
Fuck!
Fuck!

485
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:53,371
Fuck!

486
01:13:05,695 --> 01:13:08,084
Relax.

487
01:13:47,865 --> 01:13:50,427
I'm sorry.

488
01:13:53,308 --> 01:13:56,505
I'm the boys, mother.

489
01:14:00,389 --> 01:14:02,824
I knew it.

490
01:14:02,990 --> 01:14:05,060
I'm their mommy.

491
01:14:05,231 --> 01:14:09,464
This is a funeral.
This is not a good time...

492
01:14:13,753 --> 01:14:16,587
You're lying!

493
01:14:21,035 --> 01:14:23,105
Mikkel, wait!

494
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:33,992
It will be better for you,
don't you get it?

495
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:37,117
You have to wait.

496
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:45,916
You never liked us,
so we sure as hell don't like you!

497
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:36,052
- Are you always on duty?
- No, I got off last night.

498
01:15:38,215 --> 01:15:41,128
I followed you, because...

499
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:44,170
Because?

500
01:15:44,337 --> 01:15:46,977
That cat.

501
01:15:47,138 --> 01:15:50,131
Your cat...

502
01:15:50,299 --> 01:15:53,736
It didn't make it.

503
01:15:54,340 --> 01:16:00,099
We were unable to save it.
I just thought I'd tell you.

504
01:16:08,623 --> 01:16:11,742
Can you do me a favor?

505
01:16:13,906 --> 01:16:17,820
Yes... sure... of course.

506
01:16:23,108 --> 01:16:26,818
I have something
in a safe-deposit box.

507
01:16:27,469 --> 01:16:31,383
It's in my name.

508
01:16:33,671 --> 01:16:39,383
In a Nordea bank
on Trondheim Street.

509
01:16:41,913 --> 01:16:45,463
Thanks.

510
01:18:12,777 --> 01:18:16,487
How are you doing?

511
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:31,852
I was just wondering...

512
01:18:33,783 --> 01:18:37,858
Who decides who gets to live?

513
01:18:52,548 --> 01:18:58,466
Could I talk to the doctor
who makes those decisions?

514
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:03,303
I'm afraid that's me.

515
01:19:08,352 --> 01:19:15,909
I have managed to scrape together
149,750 kroner.

516
01:19:16,955 --> 01:19:21,154
I have sold
all my earthly possessions.

517
01:19:23,996 --> 01:19:27,832
And you wonder how I'm doing?

518
01:19:32,398 --> 01:19:39,159
It would be ethically irresponsible
for me to recommend this procedure.

519
01:19:42,162 --> 01:19:45,838
So we should just give up?

520
01:19:46,923 --> 01:19:53,602
There is nothing I'd rather do
than tell you to do all you can.

521
01:19:53,765 --> 01:20:00,080
Do anything in your power.
But it isn't morally justifiable.

522
01:20:00,647 --> 01:20:05,517
This solution is not legitimate.
It is undocumented.

523
01:20:05,688 --> 01:20:07,679
Bullshit!

524
01:20:07,848 --> 01:20:14,085
I want to talk to someone
who dares take responsibility!

525
01:20:15,891 --> 01:20:18,246
Calm down.

526
01:20:20,932 --> 01:20:24,892
Get a grip, Milla.

527
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:29,612
You've been brainwashed
by lying here all day.

528
01:20:36,976 --> 01:20:41,732
No, you have to stop dreaming.

529
01:20:41,898 --> 01:20:44,492
You have to wake up!

530
01:20:44,658 --> 01:20:48,573
Listen to yourself.
Just listen.

531
01:20:49,459 --> 01:20:53,419
Wake up?
I'm wide awake!

532
01:20:54,381 --> 01:20:57,215
If you leave now...

533
01:21:12,146 --> 01:21:13,739
Stop. Please.

534
01:21:22,629 --> 01:21:27,067
Give me that bag
I told you to take care of.

535
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:30,510
Leon...

536
01:21:37,273 --> 01:21:39,104
Leon!

537
01:21:39,313 --> 01:21:43,354
Do you plan on using that?
Do you?

538
01:21:47,316 --> 01:21:49,910
Yes.

539
01:22:00,519 --> 01:22:04,068
You wait here,
and everything will be OK.

540
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:07,836
Why is everything going to be OK?

541
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,837
Because you're my brother
and I care about you.

542
01:22:28,567 --> 01:22:32,481
I need something
in this safe-deposit box.

543
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:43,489
It hasn't been paid for.

544
01:22:45,811 --> 01:22:49,088
I can pay.

545
01:22:49,812 --> 01:22:54,524
- It's never been paid for.
- I can pay now.

546
01:22:56,734 --> 01:22:59,772
One moment.

547
01:23:52,389 --> 01:23:55,587
Everyone down!
Get down!

548
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:59,307
Get down!

549
01:24:00,111 --> 01:24:04,742
Everybody down!
Get away from the registers!

550
01:24:05,272 --> 01:24:09,347
- Get over to the wall!
- She isn't breathing...

551
01:24:17,276 --> 01:24:19,233
Hurry!

552
01:24:21,037 --> 01:24:23,472
Put it in the bag!

553
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:37,848
Come on, Leon.

554
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:48,049
Leon...

555
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,780
Leon!

556
01:25:54,783 --> 01:25:57,820
Come on.

557
01:26:17,388 --> 01:26:19,823
Do you remember me?

558
01:26:19,989 --> 01:26:24,984
Remember the ambulance?
I had a son. Remember?

559
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:28,270
The ambulance.

560
01:26:33,553 --> 01:26:40,233
- You have to help me.
- I can't help anyone right now.

561
01:26:43,436 --> 01:26:47,224
I'm not the type
to believe in mysteries.

562
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:54,193
- But I will believe in anything...
- I don't believe in anything.

563
01:26:55,519 --> 01:27:02,119
- You dreamt that I had a son.
- I always dream. I need to sleep.

564
01:27:30,128 --> 01:27:35,807
Hi, where are you? We're waiting.
Call when you get this message.

565
01:27:45,212 --> 01:27:48,922
- I found them.
- You'll probably get lice.

566
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:31,353
What's the matter with you?

567
01:29:32,841 --> 01:29:36,915
You can't sit and rot at that place.

568
01:29:37,803 --> 01:29:39,997
You're smart.

569
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:45,439
You're my brother.
Get it?

570
01:29:57,688 --> 01:30:02,001
We have a bag full of money
that's ours alone.

571
01:30:04,970 --> 01:30:07,609
Yours and mine.

572
01:30:09,211 --> 01:30:12,887
Can you take care of yourself, Leon?

573
01:30:18,933 --> 01:30:22,291
Do you know where we're going?

574
01:30:23,815 --> 01:30:26,250
Hawaii.

575
01:30:26,415 --> 01:30:31,013
- To get Åsa?
- No. Hawaii, Hawaii.

576
01:30:33,777 --> 01:30:37,658
I want to go to Hawaii in Oslo!

577
01:30:38,939 --> 01:30:42,454
Let me do this for you, Leon.

578
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:46,937
This time I won't run away.

579
01:30:49,341 --> 01:30:53,621
I promise I won't run away
this time. I promise.

580
01:30:54,583 --> 01:30:58,213
- About time, Erland!
- It takes time.

581
01:30:58,624 --> 01:31:02,618
- What the hell is this?
- A passport.

582
01:31:07,547 --> 01:31:12,224
Do I look like Ahmed Abdu
from f... Marocco?

583
01:31:12,388 --> 01:31:17,179
That's all you get for that price.
It's your picture, right?

584
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:21,507
Give me a thousand, Leon.

585
01:31:21,670 --> 01:31:24,982
Leon?
Leon!

586
01:31:26,391 --> 01:31:29,111
Leon!

587
01:32:15,285 --> 01:32:19,245
Excuse me,
do you know where Hawaii is?

588
01:32:25,727 --> 01:32:29,687
Up to the right
and then take a left.

589
01:34:17,238 --> 01:34:21,676
You aren't... who you claim to be.

590
01:34:23,239 --> 01:34:26,994
Neither are you.

591
01:35:25,216 --> 01:35:29,335
Remember what I said
the first time I met you?

592
01:35:29,577 --> 01:35:31,887
Do you?

593
01:35:35,619 --> 01:35:41,809
I said that without me you were
a star with no place in the sky.

594
01:35:44,021 --> 01:35:47,651
A princess without a kingdom.

595
01:35:47,902 --> 01:35:51,657
A guitar without strings.

596
01:35:52,703 --> 01:35:57,256
But it's the other way around.
I lied.

597
01:36:04,506 --> 01:36:07,180
I love you.

598
01:36:31,514 --> 01:36:33,790
What is it?

599
01:36:35,595 --> 01:36:38,315
Take a look.

600
01:36:56,361 --> 01:36:58,591
Hi.

601
01:37:00,682 --> 01:37:03,321
How are things here?

602
01:37:07,564 --> 01:37:10,318
We did it.

603
01:37:12,125 --> 01:37:15,038
You have...

604
01:37:17,007 --> 01:37:20,841
850,000 has to be enough, dammit!

605
01:37:23,688 --> 01:37:28,366
All right.
I'll try to find an ambulance, -

606
01:37:28,729 --> 01:37:32,928
and we'll get you
out of here tonight.

607
01:37:58,978 --> 01:38:04,612
- I was starting to get worried.
- I had to drop by work too.

608
01:38:07,059 --> 01:38:11,019
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

609
01:38:30,186 --> 01:38:33,065
I have...

610
01:38:34,187 --> 01:38:36,986
I have two kids.

611
01:38:38,229 --> 01:38:41,744
That's nice.
Kids are great.

612
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:46,621
Those boys you saw
outside the church.

613
01:38:53,033 --> 01:38:57,151
I haven't seen them
for eleven years.

614
01:39:03,595 --> 01:39:06,872
And they're so...

615
01:39:07,516 --> 01:39:10,873
Such wonderful kids!

616
01:39:51,928 --> 01:39:54,523
Yes?

617
01:39:55,289 --> 01:39:59,249
No, I'm off duty now.
Yes, I know.

618
01:40:00,170 --> 01:40:04,005
The ones who had the kid
this morning?

619
01:40:07,933 --> 01:40:10,766
Okay. I'm coming.

620
01:40:25,057 --> 01:40:29,256
I guess it was your kids I saw
down the street.

621
01:40:29,859 --> 01:40:34,216
They looked like you.
Especially the oldest one.

622
01:40:39,781 --> 01:40:43,457
- I'll call you.
- Thank you.

623
01:41:53,841 --> 01:41:57,801
I have to... get back to Karibu.

624
01:41:57,962 --> 01:42:02,003
I have to look out for Vidar.

625
01:42:03,804 --> 01:42:06,876
Sorry.

626
01:42:21,608 --> 01:42:24,362
Leon!

627
01:42:29,731 --> 01:42:33,519
Leon, not now.
Not now, Leon.

628
01:43:36,429 --> 01:43:40,184
I thought maybe you had forgotten.

629
01:43:40,350 --> 01:43:43,387
I never forgot you, Leon.

630
01:43:43,551 --> 01:43:47,545
And I never forgot your birthday.

631
01:43:50,032 --> 01:43:53,663
Have you had a nice birthday?

632
01:43:54,513 --> 01:43:57,313
Not really.

633
01:44:22,721 --> 01:44:25,715
Where's the money, Leon?

634
01:44:25,963 --> 01:44:30,719
- We need it to get out of here.
- I don't want to go.

635
01:44:32,164 --> 01:44:36,043
Stop it, Leon.
Where is the money?

636
01:44:36,205 --> 01:44:39,915
I remember you. From the school.

637
01:44:40,086 --> 01:44:43,124
Trygve imports flowers to Hawaii.

638
01:44:43,287 --> 01:44:48,078
We don't have time for this.
Where is the money?

639
01:44:53,609 --> 01:44:59,083
Nothing is like Waikiki Beach.
Nowhere will you find bigger waves.

640
01:44:59,251 --> 01:45:04,008
Every morning I drink
a Blue Hawaii and go surfing.

641
01:45:04,172 --> 01:45:09,453
You surf on Waikiki Beach?
Have you ever been there?

642
01:45:10,974 --> 01:45:15,526
I noticed the shirt
had a Norwegian tag on it.

643
01:45:26,338 --> 01:45:30,697
Fine, I admit it,
I have lied to you.

644
01:45:30,899 --> 01:45:34,416
But I want you to come now.

645
01:45:35,301 --> 01:45:39,693
Run with me now.
Come on.

646
01:45:42,143 --> 01:45:45,375
Police, freeze!

647
01:45:48,745 --> 01:45:52,055
Leon, what's going on?

648
01:46:21,233 --> 01:46:24,112
Leon?

649
01:46:24,714 --> 01:46:27,832
- What's happened?
- Step back!

650
01:46:27,995 --> 01:46:32,069
I know him.
There must be a misunderstanding.

651
01:46:32,276 --> 01:46:36,157
I'll take care of it, Leon.
Don't worry.

652
01:46:42,919 --> 01:46:46,390
- I'll take care of this.
- Who are you?

653
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:51,760
Step over
to the other side of the sidewalk.

654
01:46:57,323 --> 01:47:00,521
- Spread your legs.
- Step back.

655
01:47:03,605 --> 01:47:07,962
Do you have
anything else in your pockets?

656
01:47:11,047 --> 01:47:14,484
You can release him.
He is not involved.

657
01:47:14,648 --> 01:47:17,959
- Just calm down, Leon.
- Step back.

658
01:47:34,493 --> 01:47:37,326
Leon!

659
01:49:30,204 --> 01:49:32,560
We're on schedule.

660
01:49:32,725 --> 01:49:38,278
The plane doesn't leave until 7.
The boy will make it.

661
01:49:47,008 --> 01:49:50,047
Jim Aaron?

662
01:49:51,570 --> 01:49:54,722
Jim Aaron.
Sure, Jim Aaron!

663
01:49:57,812 --> 01:50:01,692
- Want me to drive?
- No, I'm fine.

664
01:50:03,133 --> 01:50:06,570
It just itches in this heat.

665
01:50:47,385 --> 01:50:52,938
This is Car 4 requesting assistance
to Schou's Square. We hit someone.

666
01:50:53,107 --> 01:50:55,621
Viggo!

667
01:50:56,347 --> 01:50:59,385
Hello?
Can you hear me?

668
01:51:04,029 --> 01:51:06,829
- Hold his head.
- My God...

669
01:51:54,483 --> 01:51:56,554
Remember...

670
01:52:03,206 --> 01:52:06,961
The three... words.

671
01:53:24,027 --> 01:53:26,986
What did you say to him?

672
01:53:28,109 --> 01:53:31,659
I love you.

673
01:56:15,074 --> 01:56:18,306
