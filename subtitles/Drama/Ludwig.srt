1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,875
I can tell you now
what the Maestro needs

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,556
The request he is planning
to put in writing for Your Majesty...

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,950
...this is what my husband told me...

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,078
...regards a certain sum he would need...

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,518
...to be able to extinguish his old debts
and look to the future with more serenity

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,713
Otherwise, he would rather leave Munich

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,318
He would need 200,000 gulden

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,951
Did you say 200,000?

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,076
200,000 gulden

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,355
Part of the sum could be paid
in cash and the rest in shares...

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,476
...with monthly repayments

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,634
I will have to ask for a loan
from the State Treasury

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,749
I will also need the approval
of Pfistermeister and von Worden

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,796
I will let the Maestro know

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,352
They promise the moon, they swear
friendship and love, and then...

16
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,474
Are these the great patrons of our days?

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,676
This is just a brainless youth

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,274
The last eccentric
of a family of eccentrics

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,353
He will give you everything you want,
I am sure

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,431
My love... Cosima

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,756
My love

22
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,356
What kind of country is this?

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,596
A nation of policemen?

24
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,590
Pfistermeister uses the police
to invite my guests

25
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,355
They are then followed and spied on
by the police

26
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,071
And the letters that my guests write and
receive, are brought to me as trophies

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,879
This is outrageous!

28
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,399
These are just standard precautions,
Sire

29
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,314
Fully justified in this case,
as Wagner is a foreigner...

30
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,994
...and he is on the records
as a revolutionary

31
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,999
If Richard Wagner was not an artist...

32
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,355
...he would be a saint

33
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,310
His genius has a moral and purifying
quality. His art redeems us

34
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,519
He is an antidote to the evil
and corruption of our society!

35
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,150
Richard Wagner is a man
who will be remembered eternally

36
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,754
Because art is the absolute truth

37
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,798
What an artist leaves behind
are not his weaknesses...

38
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,396
...for as shocking as they can be,
but his work

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,075
Your Majesty is right, of course...

40
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,755
...but if I may say so...

41
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,630
...it can be dangerous to allow the
guardians of the law to make exceptions

42
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,357
Their point of view is different from ours

43
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,080
For them, Richard Wagner...

44
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,869
...does nothing but waste
the taxpayers' money

45
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,989
Madame von Bulow is not his muse,
but an adulteress

46
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,438
And her husband is a despicable
opportunist who pretends not to know...

47
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,512
...the relationship
between his own wife and Wagner...

48
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,796
...because he does not want to lose
his job

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,350
These are just slanders!

50
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,875
No, Sire. It is the truth

51
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,190
As these letters clearly show

52
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,039
Your Majesty has to understand
something

53
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,273
Maybe Wagner's detractors are
insensitive to art...

54
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,670
...but they are not liars

55
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,793
Maestro Wagner and Mr. and Mrs.
von Bulow are in the waiting-room

56
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,358
They wish to see you
about a very urgent matter

57
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,831
Let them in

58
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,713
His Majesty the King is waiting for you

59
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,596
Thank you

60
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,515
Your Majesty told me to ignore
what the papers were writing about me

61
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,638
Criticism, verbal attacks, insinuations...

62
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,509
...insults of the press in general.
I followed Your Majesty's advice

63
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,035
I have suffered everything in silence

64
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,875
And I would keep quiet,
if I was the only one involved

65
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,833
But it is not just about me anymore

66
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,114
Your Majesty, in the "Fushbutter"
there was an article claiming...

67
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,272
...that my wife is Richard Wagner's
mistress

68
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,913
I have challenged the editor to a duel

69
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,196
This is very serious, Your Majesty

70
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,349
Yes, you are right. It is very serious

71
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,831
Because we are all accomplices

72
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,757
Mr. von Bulow, who knows that his wife
is Wagner's mistress...

73
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,672
...but feigns ignorance

74
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,479
Otherwise he would have
to throw her out...

75
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,031
...and give up his prestigious post
as the Maestro's conductor

76
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,318
And me, I know everything...

77
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,472
...because my friend Wagner
does not hide anything from me

78
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,519
Me - his friend, his patron...

79
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,630
...especially in such a delicate situation,
which affects his private...

80
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,634
...and public life...

81
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,837
Me - friend, admirer and confidant...

82
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,629
...obviously I am the accomplice
of my favorite

83
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,634
It is only an evil slander.
Unacceptable, Your Majesty

84
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,837
Only Your Majesty can help us
resolve it

85
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,988
If only Your Majesty could write a letter
to Mr. von Bulow...

86
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,915
...a simple letter expressing your
admiration and friendship...

87
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,390
...once the letter is published
in the papers...

88
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,996
Lohengrin is ready to defend Elsa...

89
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,794
...but it is easier to fight in a duel
than to write a letter

90
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,988
If I may, Your Majesty,
I have written a draft

91
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,834
"Dear Mr. von Bulow...

92
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,594
..."having had the chance
to fully appreciate...

93
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,116
..."the noble and generous qualities
of your esteemed spouse..."

94
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,350
Fine

95
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,836
I understand

96
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,399
I will copy it
and it will be delivered tomorrow

97
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,915
Your Majesty does not wish
to read the rest?

98
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,548
No, it is not necessary

99
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,915
I am sure it is absolutely fine

100
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,115
Your Majesty, I am very grateful

101
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,158
I have only done my duty

102
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,679
Wagner knows how much I value
true friendship

103
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,111
His Majesty the King
has entrusted me with the task...

104
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,910
...of ordering you to leave Munich
as soon as possible

105
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,396
Here is His Majesty's message

106
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,315
"Dear friend...

107
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,436
..."as painful as this is...

108
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,036
..."I find myself forced to ask you
to follow Minister Lutz's orders

109
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,508
"My love for you will be forever unaltered

110
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,798
"And I beg you to remain friends with me

111
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,520
"I did not have any other options

112
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,798
"Until death, yours faithfully, Ludwig"

113
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,676
Do not say anything

114
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,197
I can confirm that His Majesty,
the King of Bavaria...

115
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,955
...has been suffering from a form
of mental instability...

116
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,429
...since the year 1866...

117
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,878
...on the eve of our unfortunate
participation to the war of that year

118
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,835
The position taken by our monarch
against the government...

119
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,118
...which supported our alliance
with Austria...

120
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,317
...provoked a dangerous feeling
of general discontent

121
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,155
Gentlemen, you have to wait a bit longer

122
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,109
Your Majesty is required at the castle

123
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,273
Come in

124
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,514
Your Majesty,
His Majesty Prince Otto

125
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,995
- Did they get offended?
- I doubt it. They are waiting for me

126
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,469
They think you are not here

127
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,750
Let them wait

128
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,274
- Come
- We are going back to Munich tonight

129
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,355
And tomorrow...
I have to go back to the front

130
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,196
Do you find it hard?

131
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,392
Yes, I do. I hate the smell, the dirt...

132
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,394
...the cries of soldiers when they are
operated on without chloroform...

133
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,074
...because they have run out of supplies

134
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,710
- What do they want from me this time?
- They want you back in Munich

135
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,836
You are the King

136
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,238
We are losing the war

137
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,789
Look!

138
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,916
The four quarters of the moon...

139
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,197
...like when we used to go fishing
at night-time as children

140
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,592
Yes. And you would get upset
if I had more luck than you

141
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,035
Because I was the King

142
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,839
I did not want this war

143
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,515
I want everybody to know!

144
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,476
Yes

145
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,396
What is the matter?

146
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,757
I do not know. My eyes are stinging

147
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,515
Maybe it is because
I am not able to sleep anymore

148
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,196
And when I do sleep, I dream
of not being able to sleep

149
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,718
I dream of not being able to close
my eyes, and so I stay like this, always

150
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,159
Whether I am awake or asleep, I keep
my eyes open. That is why they sting

151
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,236
You are not well

152
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,550
Stay here in Berg with me

153
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,357
I cannot and you know that

154
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,109
I must go back to the front

155
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,630
It would be dishonorable
towards our allies too

156
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,357
They are our cousins, after all

157
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,876
Our enemies in Prussia
are our cousins too!

158
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,954
We keep everything in the family -
wars, weddings, babies...

159
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,795
We are incestuous and fratricidal

160
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,156
Without knowing why

161
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,869
You are the King. If you did not want
the war, you should have prevented it

162
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,396
That is what I did. And I do my best
to make my opinions clear

163
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,599
As far as I am concerned,
this war does not exist

164
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,559
Tell the generals that the King
does not know that there is a war

165
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,834
- Who is there? Who are you?
- It is me, Your Majesty, Volk!

166
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,279
Why are you not at the castle?

167
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,829
Who gave you permission to go out?

168
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,833
I thought Your Majesty
did not need me anymore

169
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,553
A waiter must not leave the apartment
while on duty

170
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,196
Did you not know that?

171
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,076
Yes, Your Majesty

172
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,471
Nevertheless, you came here

173
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,757
You left your job to have a swim!

174
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,309
I could not sleep

175
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,596
Are you not afraid of being caught
by patrolling squads?

176
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,514
Usually, I hear them coming
and I hide in the canes

177
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,116
- Can you swim?
- A little, Your Majesty

178
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,670
I never go where I cannot touch
the bottom, especially when I am alone

179
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,034
- Are you cold?
- Yes, a bit

180
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,231
Take this

181
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,349
Help me

182
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,353
Help me, I beg you

183
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,073
Help me

184
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,795
It is extremely important and urgent!

185
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,316
Captain Durckheim asks
to be seen by Your Majesty

186
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,391
Come in!

187
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,320
We have been defeated, Your Majesty

188
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,436
We have surrendered

189
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,270
- Are there many casualties?
- No

190
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,396
Your Majesty,
the enemies' forces were stronger

191
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,989
Our troops were demoralized

192
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,515
We do not have too many casualties...

193
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,752
...but to keep fighting would have led
to a pointless massacre

194
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,272
I am happy it is over,
and it did not last long

195
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,000
Seven weeks, Your Majesty

196
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,076
But they seemed like an eternity
for those who were fighting

197
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,591
Any news about my brother Otto?

198
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,150
He went back to Munich.
He was very demoralized

199
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,397
You are very fond of my brother,
am I right Durckheim?

200
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,994
Yes, Your Majesty. I am very fond of him

201
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,911
One day, Otto will be your king

202
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,596
Very soon

203
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,351
Because I...

204
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,156
His Majesty Prince Otto
is deeply unhappy

205
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,000
He is so young...

206
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,559
...but it is as if he has got to the end
of his life without having lived it

207
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,158
His ambitions are dipped
in bitterness

208
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,318
They have turned into sorrow and fear.
He is extremely lonely

209
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,195
He does not sleep
for more than two hours a night

210
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,478
He is unable to rest. He was
desperately looking for happiness...

211
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,876
...in something unreachable...

212
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,076
...and security...

213
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,511
...in what falls outside the rules

214
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,638
What's wrong with that?

215
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,634
The world around us
is unbearable and miserable

216
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,558
Men are only after material security,
nothing else

217
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,837
They are ready to lose their lives
in order to achieve that

218
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,552
I want to be free! Free to look
for happiness in the unreachable

219
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,919
But unlike my brother,
I try to act upon my thoughts

220
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,515
That is why I abandoned this silly war
that I was not able to prevent

221
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:46,356
I am not a coward! I hate lies

222
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,357
- I want to live in truth, always
- Forgive me, Sire

223
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,909
Allow a common man
to express his opinion

224
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,756
Your Majesty said
that he wants to live in truth

225
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,349
But I think what you meant
is that you want to live as a free man...

226
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,876
...following your instincts
and your tastes...

227
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,828
...without hypocrisy or lies.
Am I right?

228
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,876
In my opinion, the truth...

229
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,670
...doesn't have anything to do
with this search for the unreachable

230
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,474
When freedom is a privilege of the few...

231
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,712
...it does not have anything to do
with real freedom...

232
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,594
...the same freedom that belongs
to every man...

233
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,398
...and that each of us
has the right to hold on to

234
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,992
We live in a world
where there are no innocents...

235
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,673
...where nobody has the right
to judge anybody

236
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,678
I am speaking as a friend.
The generosity...

237
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,197
...that Your Majesty showed me
when we were both younger...

238
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,955
...gives me the courage
to speak my mind...

239
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,554
...as men do with each other

240
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,229
I am a soldier who was left alone
on the battlefield...

241
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,519
...at a time of danger and bitterness

242
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:36,392
But I do not feel neither contempt nor
rancor for the king who abandoned me

243
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,558
Instead, I feel great pity

244
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,076
My king thinks he has made
a brave decision...

245
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,030
...but he is mistaken if he thinks
he can find happiness...

246
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,839
...outside the rules and the duties of men

247
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,719
Those who love life cannot afford
to search for the unreachable...

248
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,393
...but have to be extremely careful

249
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,756
This is true even for a monarch

250
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,789
Even for a monarch, because
the great power that a monarch has...

251
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,754
...is limited by the boundaries
of the society of which he is part

252
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,679
Who could ever be able to follow him
outside those boundaries?

253
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:38,438
Certainly not the weak and humble
whose only worry is to find security...

254
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,630
...both material and moral

255
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,112
The same security Your Majesty
was talking about with such contempt

256
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,716
The only ones following him
will be those...

257
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,429
...who see freedom
as a search for pleasure...

258
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,558
...beyond any moral boundary.
No...

259
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,031
...you surely do not want this

260
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,508
Being followed only
by despicable servants...

261
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,558
...exploiters, traders of illusions...

262
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,508
No, I do not believe it. Your Majesty
cannot like such a breed...

263
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,912
...who would take advantage of his
generosity and would try to deceive him

264
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,957
Why would a young person,
who has a whole life ahead of him...

265
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,918
...not be tempted to find
a different reason to live?

266
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,995
Even if it is difficult because it is
the one of common people...

267
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,111
...who accept mediocrity

268
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,920
It takes a lot of courage
to accept mediocrity...

269
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,039
...for somebody who is pursuing sublime
ideals beyond this world. I know it

270
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,237
But it is the only way to be saved
from a terrible loneliness

271
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,789
- I need to talk to my mother
- Her Majesty is resting

272
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,951
Wake her up! What are you waiting for?

273
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,076
- Yes
- Hurry!

274
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,190
Her Majesty the Queen
is waiting for Your Majesty

275
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,910
I apologize for waking you up
at this time...

276
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,197
...but I needed to tell you something
immediately

277
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,316
I have decided to get married

278
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,512
I knew this would be good news for you

279
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,918
Are you not going to ask me
who the chosen one is?

280
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,629
I was waiting for Your Majesty to tell me

281
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,837
I fully trust Your Majesty's judgment

282
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,197
I want you to go immediately...

283
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,316
...to Possenhofen...

284
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,439
...to ask Duchess Ludovica
for the hand of Princess Sophie

285
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,719
I am sure Sophie will be
the perfect spouse for you

286
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,034
I have already asked Father Hoffman
to come here. See him straight away

287
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,237
I would like you to inform him
of my decision...

288
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,791
...and to go with him to Possenhofen,
because Sophie is Catholic

289
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,390
Ludwig

290
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,839
- Your Majesty
- My dressing-gown, hurry!

291
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,596
Hurry!

292
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,555
As soon as Father Hoffman arrives,
take him to my dressing room

293
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,676
Yes, Your Majesty

294
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,918
Reverend Father Hoffman
is already here

295
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,313
Your Majesty

296
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,269
- What happened?
- Did you see my son?

297
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,592
Yes, just now as he was leaving

298
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,719
- He did not say a word. He seemed...
- Happy

299
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,351
He is full of joy

300
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,149
Ludwig wants to get married

301
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,437
He wanted me to let you know

302
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,389
He also wants you to come with me
to ask for the hand of the young girl

303
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,120
This is only fair,
because the princess is Catholic

304
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,909
And the request made by a Protestant
mother may not be enough

305
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,557
- He wants to get married?
- Princess Sophie, Elisabeth's sister

306
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,075
Is it not wonderful news?

307
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,632
Father, I feel like I am waking up
from a nightmare

308
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,797
A nightmare you have not helped me
much with, to tell you the truth

309
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,068
- Please, take a seat
- Thank you

310
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,797
It must be a big relief

311
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,436
I hope...

312
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,718
...that His Majesty has found
a stable balance

313
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,674
Many young men struggle
to find balance within themselves...

314
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,190
- An inner harmony
- He has found it

315
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,633
What matters is that he found it
and is getting married

316
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,911
I am surprised that His Majesty has
never mentioned to me his intentions

317
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,192
I was saying that I hope...

318
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,038
...that he has weighed carefully
the decision he has made

319
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,752
Because this choice...

320
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,956
...involves not only him...

321
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,549
...but also his spouse who,
with the blessing of the Lord...

322
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,836
Enough, Father Hoffman!

323
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,639
What matters is that they get married...

324
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,837
...and that the wedding is celebrated
as soon as possible

325
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,311
This is exactly what we all hoped for

326
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,479
- Am I right?
- Of course. It is a relief for all of us

327
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,756
And for the country

328
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,993
We will probably need
the papal dispensation...

329
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,470
...given the close relationship
between the two

330
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,236
Of course. I am sure
there will not be any problems,

331
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,556
- Their parents are cousins too
- Exactly

332
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,315
That is the reason why people believe
that in the Wittelsbach...

333
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,951
...and in the Hohenzollers family, there
have been many cases of anomalies

334
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,113
But as far as I know,
young Sophie enjoys good health

335
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,432
And His Majesty the King has never
given us any reasons to worry

336
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,469
We should mention certain timidities
and indispositions of His Majesty...

337
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,997
...so that Sophie can help him
and be understanding

338
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,870
Like her sisters,
Sophie will quickly learn...

339
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,796
...that a woman in her position does not
only have rights and privileges...

340
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,919
...but also duties. Many duties

341
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,551
My dear

342
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,118
- Sophie, are you happy?
- Yes, indeed

343
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,317
This is one of the best days of my life,
Ludwig

344
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,637
My dear Durckheim,
these family reunions are very tiring

345
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,996
My best wishes

346
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,790
I am very, very happy. Really

347
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,190
Thank you, Otto

348
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,716
Well done, Otto.
You are always so nice

349
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,271
- Nene, Matilde, ma tante...
- Elisabeth!

350
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,355
I am very happy too

351
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,080
Congratulations, mon beau-frere

352
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,713
My dear Otto, you are so nice

353
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,275
Everybody is happy. And the station
looked beautiful, with all those flags

354
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,157
Father

355
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,915
You did not think I was going
to show up? I did not either

356
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,594
Everything is always so complicated

357
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,469
So, ma tante, I have heard you will do
refurbishment work at the residence

358
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,394
The old residence will be renovated.
Who will be in charge of the work?

359
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,711
Sophie, let your voice be heard.
Sophie is not like me

360
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,635
I can only say if I like something or not
after it has been done

361
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,999
I must have a warm drink,
if you will excuse me

362
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,193
Thank you. I can do it myself

363
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,476
I was dying for a cup of tea

364
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,200
- We will not be living at the residence
- Will you not?

365
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:12,195
Only for a short while. As little as
possible. Until the new house is ready

366
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,158
What are these?

367
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,709
Something I have been thinking about
for a while

368
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,551
I would like to build a castle

369
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,151
Remember the Graswang Valley?

370
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,597
Above Oberammergau. There is also
another place that I like just as much

371
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,076
Maybe even more

372
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,676
Herrenchiemsee. I am still not sure

373
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,670
We could go there tomorrow, by horse

374
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,116
Remember Bad Ischl?

375
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,671
It will not be tiring, quite the opposite

376
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,514
So you can give me your advice

377
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,515
Sadly, I will not be here tomorrow.
I will be on my way to Zurich

378
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,475
I stopped by just to see Sophie
and give you both Franz's best wishes

379
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,076
And mine, of course

380
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,189
With the wedding approaching,
His Majesty gave the go ahead...

381
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,670
...to the building works
for his damned castles

382
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,550
I was in charge of making the King
experience certain things...

383
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,599
...that he was thought to be
totally new to

384
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,879
It was all so complicated

385
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:38,478
They told me so many things about you.
They recommended you

386
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,516
Who did?

387
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,079
Your Majesty sent his aide-de-camp
to the theatre to invite me for dinner...

388
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,233
...and I suddenly found myself
at the center of a big State affair

389
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,156
Closed carriage, curtains down

390
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,197
I was taken to a place full of offices

391
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,232
And then?

392
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,517
Do you want to know? Are you curious?

393
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,916
Thank you

394
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,711
There were some gentlemen

395
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,156
I think one of them
was sent by the archbishop

396
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,550
A very indiscreet person

397
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,833
And another one was sent...

398
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,636
...by Her Majesty the Queen Mother

399
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,071
Oh, my God, Your Majesty!

400
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,075
Are things always so complicated
when a king wants to make love?

401
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,199
For us actors it is much simpler.
A gaze is all we need

402
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,195
A sign like this

403
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,829
I have been told this too -
that you are very shy

404
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,588
Then they asked me a lot of questions

405
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,716
Even about my health

406
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,875
- Really?
- Really outrageous

407
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,077
Scandalous. And in the end...

408
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,872
...they appealed to my discretion

409
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,396
Although it doesn't apply to them,
obviously

410
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,954
They want to know how things went

411
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,154
Are you going to tell them?

412
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,029
With Your Majesty's permission,
I would like to deceive them all

413
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,270
They are too indiscreet

414
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,590
Curious.
We...

415
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,557
...could make love...

416
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,678
...and say that we have not done it

417
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:40,240
Or we could not do it,
and say we have done it

418
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,235
Yes, we must satisfy their curiosity

419
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,915
Let's tell them something
that will shock them

420
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,992
For example,
that Your Majesty spanked me

421
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,712
- Will they believe you?
- Your Majesty, I am a great actress

422
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,395
The truth is... that you will surely
go back to them

423
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,195
And you will tell them what did not
happen between us in every detail

424
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,112
- Is that why they pay you?
- No

425
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,635
- Is that why you do it?
- No

426
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,837
- No, Your Majesty. No!
- Yes, they are paying you

427
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,833
I am sure of it

428
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,955
Why would you not accept?

429
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,635
If you do not do it today,
somebody else will do it tomorrow

430
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,759
Do you think I do not know
what happens around me?

431
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,677
I know it. I am surrounded by people
who check everything I do

432
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,310
Not to protect me, but to ruin me

433
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:29,790
I have not understood yet
how they will do it, but I know they will

434
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,876
This is their aim

435
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,114
I can only watch...

436
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,110
...fascinated, while they move
quietly and cautiously

437
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,235
It is as if I was watching them...

438
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,836
...while they build the scaffold
on which they will hang me

439
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:58,350
No. No, Your Majesty.
This is not true

440
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,715
- This is not true at all
- Go away

441
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,836
And get them to pay you

442
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:10,555
Ask for a good sum,
more than you deserve. Go, Madame

443
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,509
- Prostitute!
- Your Majesty!

444
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,672
Why? What have I done?

445
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:24,436
Not like this, please. Please

446
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,155
Your Majesty, rescue me! Help me!

447
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,118
Rescue Madame von Buliowski,
and send her home, now

448
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,717
Your Majesty! Help me!

449
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,429
The jewels that the queens of Bavaria
have been wearing for 700 years

450
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,835
But I will give you a better present.
It is a secret, you cannot tell anybody

451
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,553
I will introduce you to Richard Wagner

452
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,351
Our engagement is more tiring
than a military campaign

453
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,036
It is a martyrdom...

454
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,839
...that Sophie bears
without a single complaint

455
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,629
She is the perfect fiancée

456
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,389
And she loves your music

457
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,428
Do you know what she is afraid of
right now?

458
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,359
That I ask her
to sing something for you

459
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,555
She is afraid of your judgment, not
only as a singer but also as a fiancée

460
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:23,269
She is convinced that by asking you
to meet her, I sought your approval

461
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,917
- When are you coming back?
- Soon, Sire, soon

462
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:49,915
And I will not be hiding. I will come back
with my wife and a new opera

463
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,909
You will save me from much sorrow,
much loneliness

464
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,880
Sophie is delightful...

465
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,951
...very pretty and sweet

466
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,672
For the first time I saw love
for Your Majesty in somebody's eyes

467
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:11,391
I have decided to postpone the wedding
by a month or two

468
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,271
I wish it had already happened. I can
already hear the crowd screaming...

469
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:23,070
...the banquets, the ceremonies,
both here and at the church

470
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,279
It is like a nightmare,
it keeps me awake at night

471
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,672
My uncles, my aunts,
my cousins from all over Europe...

472
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,990
...the kisses, the hand-shakes,
the wishes...

473
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,389
...the hugs

474
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,028
You can open your heart to me,
Your Majesty

475
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,512
My affection for you is the same as
it was the day you called me to Munich

476
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,196
I have not forgotten you saved me from
poverty, welcomed me into your arms

477
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,478
I took up your invitation right away
because I realized you needed me

478
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,396
Forget what happened in the past

479
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,831
You can betray friends,
even their trust...

480
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,596
...and still love them.
Be magnanimous, try to forgive

481
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,716
I know that nobody else can advise you
like I can...

482
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:20,749
...because my words are born
of a very honest and deep feeling

483
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,636
What is bothering you, my friend?

484
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:49,151
I understand many things, but I cannot
speak if you do not ask me to

485
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,551
My name is Richard Hornig

486
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,069
I worked for the King for 10 years

487
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,477
I became part of his staff
by chance, when His Majesty...

488
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,838
...in one of his moments of rage,
threw out a squire called Volk

489
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,916
And so I replaced him

490
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,073
During my years at the service of the
King, I never betrayed his trust

491
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,595
And I do not have any intention
of doing it today

492
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:37,438
Apart from this -
nothing in his behavior...

493
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,239
...was different from what everybody
considered...

494
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,994
...suitable behavior for a king

495
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,796
Wait here

496
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:29,836
- Take this! Are you able to put it up?
- Yes, Your Majesty

497
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:50,834
- Good. Very good
- I learnt it when I was in the Army

498
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,353
- I have not seen you before
- I started few days ago, Your Majesty

499
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,238
- And what did you do before?
- I worked in a farm

500
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,316
I looked after horses

501
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,828
- Light the fire
- Right away, Your Majesty

502
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,676
Take off your gloves!

503
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,556
- What are you waiting for?
- Have you got any orders for me, Sire?

504
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,356
If you want, you can sleep here tonight

505
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,791
Yes, Your Majesty
