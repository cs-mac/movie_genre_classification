1
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:29,087
Into love and out again,

2
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:32,507
Thus i went,
and thus i go.

3
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,763
Spare your voice,
and hold your pen...

4
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:42,766
Well and bitterly
i know

5
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:46,478
All the songs
were ever sung,

6
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,397
All the words
were ever said...

7
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,483
Could it be,
when i was young,

8
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:55,528
Some one dropped me
on my head?

9
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:15,838
Oh, i'm rather glad
that you caught me like this

10
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,340
Because it gives me
an opportunity

11
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:20,801
To give you a little talk

12
00:02:20,843 --> 00:02:23,053
On the art of making
motion pictures

13
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:25,305
In your own home.

14
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:29,017
Of course, you all know
that you can...

15
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,898
...that you can make
motion pictures

16
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,816
In your own home.

17
00:02:36,816 --> 00:02:41,445
All you need to have
is a home

18
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:47,492
And a small camera
like this...somewhere.

19
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,995
And quite a lot of film,
as you see.

20
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,789
Oh, well.
Never mind.

21
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:54,248
With these essentials,

22
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,043
You can take pictures
of any interesting events

23
00:02:57,084 --> 00:02:59,461
That may happen
in your own household,

24
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:01,296
If any interesting events
ever do happen

25
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:03,465
In your own household.

26
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:06,259
And you can make
a record of all trips

27
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:07,969
And of the progress
of the children

28
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:10,346
Down the path of life.

29
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:12,599
And you can also
entertain your friends

30
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,183
Into the bargain.

31
00:03:14,225 --> 00:03:17,561
The other night, we had a party
of friends in for dinner.

32
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:20,564
After dinner, instead of
going out on the town,

33
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:22,107
As they say,

34
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:25,360
Or settling down
for a dull game of bridge...

35
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,611
Cut!

36
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:28,530
Wonderful.
The rest of this is voice-Over.

37
00:03:29,823 --> 00:03:31,783
Thank you, everyone!
An early lunch today!

38
00:03:31,824 --> 00:03:34,494
Let's be back
in one hour, please.

39
00:03:34,535 --> 00:03:36,787
Try to be back
in one hour.

40
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:39,790
Bob,
we'll be in the living room after lunch.

41
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:41,417
How are you
feeling, bob?

42
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,252
I'm fine.
Just hurting inside.

43
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:45,504
The top one's
a corker.

44
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,510
Look at that.
The higher authority.

45
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:02,811
If it comes through,

46
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:04,438
It'll be the first ever
nomination

47
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,981
For a husband-And-Wife
team.

48
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:07,691
We could be the first
husband-And-Wife team

49
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:09,401
Ever nominated
for an oscar.

50
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:11,819
Shit.
Now i'll have to see the picture.

51
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,823
Mr. Selznick should know
by this afternoon.

52
00:04:15,865 --> 00:04:17,616
Bob!

53
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,243
Alan,
how are you?

54
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:21,286
It's good
to see you.

55
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:22,287
Oh, mrs. Parker.

56
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:23,956
Mr. Benchley.

57
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,584
Oh, bob,
you look terrific.

58
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:28,960
When i dress up,

59
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,838
I still manage to look
like a house detective.

60
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,339
It's the tie.

61
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:35,633
Listen, you must come up
to roxbury drive.

62
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,510
I'll whip up some tomato curry
with spring lamb.

63
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:38,552
That will be fine.

64
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:42,139
Alan enjoys whipping
young lambs.

65
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,307
Darling.

66
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:45,017
Well, great
to see you, bob.

67
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:47,143
Darling, i'll prepare them
for our scene.

68
00:04:47,185 --> 00:04:49,521
We did a little fix
for goldwyn.

69
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:51,272
He told us people want
a happy ending.

70
00:04:51,314 --> 00:04:53,274
Dorothy reminded him
that in all history,

71
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:55,902
No single person
ever had such a thing.

72
00:04:55,902 --> 00:05:00,698
Goldwyn doesn't know
what she's talking about.

73
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,701
You must tell me
the moment you know.

74
00:05:04,743 --> 00:05:08,496
He can be such
a fawn's ass.

75
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:12,625
Well, mrs. Parker,
goldwyn.

76
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:13,751
Mr. Benchley,
out here,

77
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:16,671
The streets are
paved with goldwyn.

78
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,298
Careful, man.
Stepped in something.

79
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,844
Little art going by.

80
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:25,053
I'm seeing
don stewart tonight.

81
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:27,013
We're going to go out
for a hot-Fudge gin.

82
00:05:27,055 --> 00:05:28,014
Donny needs a break

83
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:30,683
From his leagues
and guilds and soviets.

84
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:33,144
Union is a five-Letter word,
mr. Benchley.

85
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:35,146
What do you know
about that?

86
00:05:35,188 --> 00:05:36,355
And i expect
to see you

87
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:38,649
At the writers'
fund raiser.

88
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:40,776
Oh, you sent me
that little card.

89
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:41,568
I couldn't make it out
with the red ink.

90
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,653
On the first.

91
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:44,863
I promised gertrude
and the boys

92
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:47,157
I'd launch the big benchley
expedition that weekend.

93
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,241
These are not the days

94
00:05:48,283 --> 00:05:50,201
For timid,
selfish little things.

95
00:05:50,243 --> 00:05:52,287
Mrs. Parker,
it's no small affair,

96
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:53,705
Getting all those people...

97
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:57,416
Years i've wasted being a
party girl and smartass.

98
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,252
You were a pretty smart
party gi...

99
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:01,837
Ass.

100
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,839
Ready for you
on the set.

101
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:05,841
Bit of a party girl
myself.

102
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:07,842
Visiting hours
are over, mr. Benchley.

103
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:10,512
Let's do it again
sometime soon, mrs. Parker.

104
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:13,681
You'll find us
next-Door to caligula.

105
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:15,558
Oh, does that hurt?

106
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,602
Must have been so colorful
in the twenties.

107
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,688
Was it?
I barely remember.

108
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:33,658
So many famous writers

109
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,661
Are from the algonquin roundtable,
mrs. Parker.

110
00:06:36,702 --> 00:06:38,662
Ah, but no
real giants.

111
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:40,581
Just a bunch of
loudmouths showing off,

112
00:06:40,623 --> 00:06:42,875
Writing it up in their
columns the next day.

113
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:46,503
It's no mermaid tavern,
i promise you that.

114
00:06:46,545 --> 00:06:48,588
Will you get me
a cup of coffee, dear?

115
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,714
They love it,
darling.

116
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:52,467
They love
our new ending.

117
00:06:52,508 --> 00:06:54,677
Brilliant scene, dottie.
Alan.

118
00:06:54,677 --> 00:06:56,178
Thank you, farleigh.

119
00:06:56,178 --> 00:06:57,680
So, how was bob?

120
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,640
It's so silly.
We're all out here,

121
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:00,891
And we never
see him.

122
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:04,144
Alan, mr. Benchley
has sold out to hollywood.

123
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:05,604
Really?

124
00:07:05,645 --> 00:07:08,231
A perfect happy-Ending
scene, dottie.

125
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:09,649
Bravo.

126
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:12,652
How very kind
of you, seymour...

127
00:07:12,694 --> 00:07:13,986
You monumental shit.

128
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:17,156
Darling, please
don't use that word.

129
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:20,159
Well, sorry,
you monumental shit.

130
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,410
Alan.

131
00:07:21,452 --> 00:07:22,661
Yes.

132
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:24,663
Veronica, make
your heart sing!

133
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:27,165
Just put it
on the floor, dear.

134
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:29,709
And action!

135
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:33,963
I came in such a hurry,
my heart is still pounding.

136
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:37,216
And i thought it was
valentine's day.

137
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,227
I suppose it was colorful.

138
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:52,939
Cut!

139
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:25,677
Ahem.

140
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:27,220
Oh.

141
00:08:27,262 --> 00:08:28,805
Oh, yes.
Delightful.

142
00:08:28,847 --> 00:08:31,474
How are you today,
mr. Crowninshield, sir?

143
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:35,102
Oh, the mail elf
is here.

144
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:36,479
Mr. Elf.

145
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,148
Do you have anything
for me in there?

146
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,941
What's with the sign?

147
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:43,777
Sorry. We're not allowed
to discuss our salaries.

148
00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:46,988
Crownie's posted
a memo.

149
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,991
There's a love letter
from a soldier in there.

150
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,451
A real letter?

151
00:08:51,492 --> 00:08:52,785
No. Another post card.

152
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:54,954
War must have run him
short on paper.

153
00:08:54,954 --> 00:08:57,123
What's the difference
between the red...

154
00:08:57,164 --> 00:08:58,874
Don't touch that!

155
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:03,795
"Dear, if you can send
a cake of working soap,

156
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:08,174
I think i can arrange
to buy this castle. Ed."

157
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:11,261
Such passion.
I am overwhelmed.

158
00:09:11,261 --> 00:09:12,762
"If i were better paid,

159
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:15,097
"I might feel happier about
murdering time

160
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:16,599
"In an overheated theater.

161
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,684
"Indeed, given the state
in which i hobbled home,

162
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,769
"Bruised and beaten
by the mediocrity

163
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,729
Of both author and cast..."

164
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,232
My, our vines do bear
tender grapes...

165
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,566
"I can only guess
that my refusal

166
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:27,901
"To list their names here

167
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,028
"Is due to a lingering sense
of playground honor.

168
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,321
I'm not going
to tell on them."

169
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,739
Like it, crownie?

170
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,407
I would have liked it
better if it hadn't been...

171
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,741
Another dull thug

172
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,536
From another one of
your prodigious producers.

173
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:39,453
That had nothing
to do with it.

174
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,996
How silly of me.

175
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,916
Was it a very big advertisement
he was going to take out?

176
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:46,168
Not that it matters,
but, yes, a quarter page.

177
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:48,670
Benchley, why didn't you cut
that bit about her salary?

178
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:49,838
Would that it
were in my power

179
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:51,589
To alter
mrs. Parker's wages.

180
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:54,258
Get rid of that ludicrous sign.
Didn't you see my memo?

181
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,302
I'm hungry.
Aren't you?

182
00:09:56,344 --> 00:09:59,597
No. I'm mr. Sherwood.

183
00:09:59,638 --> 00:10:02,683
You inspire
deathless prose.

184
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:04,393
I think we'd better
feed mrs. Parker

185
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:05,227
Before she gets
cranky.

186
00:10:05,268 --> 00:10:06,478
Be careful.

187
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:08,063
You know she bites
the hand that feeds her.

188
00:10:08,104 --> 00:10:11,983
Oh, i do not.
Do i?

189
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,271
Oh, shit.

190
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:06,283
I thought i was late.

191
00:11:06,324 --> 00:11:08,910
Not so anyone
would notice.

192
00:11:08,952 --> 00:11:11,704
Only three hours.

193
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:18,210
What are we doing?
May i come in?

194
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:41,732
It smells like home.

195
00:11:47,988 --> 00:11:50,240
Thank you.

196
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:54,619
You must be
terribly hot.

197
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:57,288
No. No.
Not at all.

198
00:12:15,054 --> 00:12:16,013
Oh, dear.
We can't.

199
00:12:16,055 --> 00:12:17,598
Why not?

200
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,892
Don't you want to
feel married again?

201
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:23,812
I have to be at the
theater in half an hour.

202
00:12:23,854 --> 00:12:25,105
Musical?

203
00:12:25,147 --> 00:12:27,190
No. Ibsen.

204
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:28,608
Who's he?

205
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,901
You'll like it, idiot.

206
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:32,904
Gun goes off
in the third act.

207
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,577
So, where is this
mythical husband of yours?

208
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:43,622
Tonight i rank third
in his affections,

209
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:46,833
Behind misters
hague and hague.

210
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,627
Please.

211
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,879
I look pitiful
enough.

212
00:12:58,385 --> 00:13:00,012
Oh...

213
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:04,141
Let's hope the actors don't put
too much glug into their lines.

214
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:13,107
Eddie!

215
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:15,651
Eddie, are you hungry?

216
00:13:26,203 --> 00:13:27,621
Eddie.

217
00:13:28,663 --> 00:13:30,790
Eddie, wake up.

218
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,125
Oh, god.

219
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,627
Eddie, wake up.
Wake up.

220
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:38,631
Kiss me.

221
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:42,134
Oh, i missed you.

222
00:13:45,012 --> 00:13:52,602
Lady, lady, never speak of
the tears that burn your cheek...

223
00:13:52,644 --> 00:13:54,937
She will never win him,

224
00:13:54,937 --> 00:13:59,483
Whose words had shown
she feared to lose.

225
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:03,111
Be you wise and never sad,

226
00:14:03,153 --> 00:14:06,114
You will get
your lovely lad.

227
00:14:06,156 --> 00:14:09,909
Never serious be,
nor true,

228
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:13,913
And your wish
will come to you...

229
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:16,916
And if that
makes you happy, kid,

230
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:20,169
You'll be the first
it ever did.

231
00:14:27,592 --> 00:14:29,094
There's the phone.

232
00:14:30,678 --> 00:14:33,514
Young mr. Benchley,
where are you going over there?

233
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:36,309
Hello.

234
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,644
Hello, gertrude.
It's dorothy.

235
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,604
Something's come up
with work.

236
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,482
May i speak with
mr. Benchley, please?

237
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,193
Certainly.
One moment.

238
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:48,653
It's dorothy.

239
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,156
On a sunday.

240
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:53,658
A sunday.

241
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:57,495
Mrs. Parker,
what happened?

242
00:14:57,536 --> 00:14:59,622
Crownie fired me.

243
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:02,124
He took me
out to lunch,

244
00:15:02,124 --> 00:15:03,917
And then
he fired me.

245
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,629
He didn't even have
the nerve to say why.

246
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:10,632
You and i
both know why.

247
00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:12,634
I've wrecked
my career.

248
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:14,927
Kindly direct me
to hell.

249
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:17,513
Take two aspirin,
lightly grilled.

250
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:20,140
I'll be in
on the next train.

251
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,101
Well...

252
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:24,603
Don't tell me.

253
00:15:24,645 --> 00:15:26,605
I suppose
she started crying.

254
00:15:26,646 --> 00:15:27,939
They fired her.

255
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:31,651
She did get
a bit weepy, yes.

256
00:15:31,693 --> 00:15:33,569
And then
the bastard offered me

257
00:15:33,611 --> 00:15:35,279
A satisfactory rate.

258
00:15:35,321 --> 00:15:36,781
What does
that mean?

259
00:15:36,822 --> 00:15:37,907
Exactly.

260
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:41,744
For a few little pieces
at home.

261
00:15:41,785 --> 00:15:43,662
Like i'm a spoiled virgin

262
00:15:43,704 --> 00:15:44,621
And no one else
would have me.

263
00:15:44,663 --> 00:15:46,123
You're not spoiled.

264
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:47,624
I'm not?

265
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,210
Just
highly seasoned.

266
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,670
What does that mean, bob?

267
00:15:54,964 --> 00:15:58,134
What were you two doing
when i was overseas?

268
00:15:58,175 --> 00:15:59,927
Nothing, ed,

269
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:04,139
Which is a lot more
than you weren't doing.

270
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:06,183
Do you mind?

271
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:08,935
I'm leaving.

272
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:11,646
I was expecting a raise,
i really was.

273
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:32,957
Do you mind?

274
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:34,500
Yes, all right.
Then i'll stop.

275
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,002
The day will arrive

276
00:16:36,043 --> 00:16:38,754
When they come to me on their
knees and beg me to drum.

277
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:40,506
There will be three
of you today?

278
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:43,967
Yes. Only three.

279
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:45,427
I wonder what
the least expensive item is

280
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:46,928
On this menu.

281
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,680
The eggs.

282
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:52,517
Uh, yes, i believe
i'll have the eggs.

283
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:54,227
Same for me, please.
Loosely scrambled,

284
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:56,145
Like my brains.

285
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:59,481
Could i get
a half-Order?

286
00:16:59,523 --> 00:17:00,607
Hello, guppies!

287
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:01,817
What colossal
trumpery

288
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:03,944
Is taking place at
vanity fair?

289
00:17:03,986 --> 00:17:07,072
Well, mr. Sherwood
was replaced last week

290
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:09,240
By the woman who gives
music lessons

291
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,992
To conde nast's daughter.

292
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:12,952
A woman, i might add,
who's so full of charm,

293
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:16,205
She's practically
panting with it.

294
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:17,957
And then mrs. Parker
was fired...

295
00:17:17,998 --> 00:17:19,416
Because, i presume,

296
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,543
Vanity fair is a magazine
of no opinion,

297
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:22,377
And she has plenty.

298
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:23,879
And you, benchley?

299
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:27,090
We hear your income is
running well into one figure.

300
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:28,633
Go ahead, rob.
Tell them.

301
00:17:28,675 --> 00:17:30,093
I trust this is for
publication.

302
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:32,345
Benchley,
one can't simply repeat rumors.

303
00:17:32,387 --> 00:17:33,721
And do it with
some complexity.

304
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:37,558
I am resigning from
vanity fair...

305
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,976
There will be
five of you today?

306
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:41,020
Yes. Only five.

307
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,855
I'm, uh...i'm resigning
from the magazine

308
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,483
Because mrs. Parker's dismissal
was remarkably stupid...

309
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:50,278
Hello, helen!

310
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,237
And unfair.

311
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,280
Helen hayes.

312
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,574
And if i've learned
anything...

313
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,576
I've allowed them
to seat five in the booth.

314
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,578
I know it's
a little disorderly,

315
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,498
But i think we can keep them
from being disruptive.

316
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,542
Everyone,
ross and i have set

317
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,377
A september date
for the wedding!

318
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,503
Congratulations!

319
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,213
Call me cox.

320
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,506
It's damned
embarrassing.

321
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,132
And i'm keeping
my maiden name.

322
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:14,425
No goddamn music!

323
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:17,803
No marching down the
aisles to mendelssohn!

324
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:19,346
I insist on picking out
the wedding ring

325
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:22,307
And making
all the arrangements.

326
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:23,559
It's settled!

327
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,018
We must remodel
that ghastly house

328
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,686
Before i move in.

329
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:29,439
Aleck,
you left the tub full this morning.

330
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:31,774
In the hopes
that you might take a bath.

331
00:18:31,816 --> 00:18:34,277
I tell you, that house
reeks of sex.

332
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:35,736
Aleck, how would
you know?

333
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:37,738
A childhood bout
of the mumps

334
00:18:37,738 --> 00:18:40,074
Killed the impulse
in me.

335
00:18:40,074 --> 00:18:41,408
Don't apologize.

336
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:42,534
Celibacy sharpens
the senses.

337
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:44,536
Is this a dagger
i see before me?

338
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:47,372
I think this calls for
a cele-Bation.

339
00:18:47,414 --> 00:18:48,540
I may not be able
to vote red,

340
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:49,999
But i can certainly
drink it.

341
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,377
Where's my bread?

342
00:18:52,418 --> 00:18:55,129
I'm hungry!

343
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:58,340
Bring them some celery
and some popovers or something.

344
00:18:58,382 --> 00:19:00,426
Mr. Case already
told me, sir.

345
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:02,553
Well, i knew that.

346
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:04,554
Are you nervous?
Don't be nervous.

347
00:19:04,596 --> 00:19:06,014
I'll take care
of you.

348
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:08,516
Your royal highnesses,
i give you marc connelly,

349
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:10,685
Fact-Finder for
the morning telegraph.

350
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:12,562
Ah, the chorus girl's
breakfast.

351
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:15,690
Well, i don't actually write
for the telegraph.

352
00:19:15,731 --> 00:19:17,024
11

353
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:18,400
A bald man.

354
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:19,568
Strange.

355
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,862
It feels just like
my wife's behind.

356
00:19:21,904 --> 00:19:24,031
So it does!

357
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,490
Ha ha ha!

358
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,867
Listen, everyone.

359
00:19:26,908 --> 00:19:30,036
Ross is in the planning stages
of a brand-New weekly.

360
00:19:30,078 --> 00:19:32,538
Something similar to what you're doing now,
ross?

361
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,040
Just what the world
is waiting for,

362
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:36,167
Another publication for
little old ladies in dubuque.

363
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,962
Don't ask us to be on your advisory board.
It'll ruin our appetites.

364
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:42,131
Does that mean you're
interested, aleck?

365
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:43,924
You remind me
a great deal

366
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:45,258
Of my grandfather's
coachman.

367
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,636
A horse's ass
would know the coachman.

368
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:49,304
Oh, here's kaufman!

369
00:19:49,345 --> 00:19:51,222
George, over here!

370
00:19:51,264 --> 00:19:52,432
Table for one,
sir?

371
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:54,142
Everyone,
i'd like you to meet

372
00:19:54,183 --> 00:19:56,894
My assistant at the new york times,
george s. Kaufman.

373
00:19:56,936 --> 00:19:57,436
A jew.

374
00:19:57,478 --> 00:19:58,104
Gesundheit.

375
00:19:58,145 --> 00:19:59,313
Shalom.

376
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:00,648
I'm no longer
your assistant, aleck.

377
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:01,690
You haven't converted,
i trust.

378
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:03,609
No, just promoted.

379
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,735
You look
terrible.

380
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,111
Terrible would be
an improvement.

381
00:20:06,153 --> 00:20:07,362
Harold ross,
american legion weekly.

382
00:20:07,404 --> 00:20:08,446
You shouldn't
touch george.

383
00:20:08,488 --> 00:20:09,864
George doesn't like
to be touched.

384
00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:11,199
How many will there be
for lunch?

385
00:20:11,241 --> 00:20:14,202
There will be
two of everybody!

386
00:20:14,243 --> 00:20:16,203
Mr. Case
won't like this.

387
00:20:16,245 --> 00:20:18,414
Oh, well.
Case closed.

388
00:20:19,582 --> 00:20:21,542
Yes, bob?
You rang?

389
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:25,879
I...I...I'm afraid
i have...

390
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:29,716
I am resigning my position
at vanity fair.

391
00:20:29,758 --> 00:20:31,009
Why?

392
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,886
Well, because my job,
if you could call it that,

393
00:20:33,886 --> 00:20:35,888
As managing editor
is no longer attractive

394
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,183
Without the extraordinary
talents of mrs. Parker

395
00:20:39,183 --> 00:20:41,560
And mr. Sherwood.

396
00:20:41,602 --> 00:20:44,062
This is not
a reckless decision.

397
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:45,355
I'm a careful man,

398
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:46,481
One who often
wears a belt,

399
00:20:46,523 --> 00:20:48,275
As well as suspenders.

400
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:50,944
Bravo.
Bravo, bob.

401
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:53,404
Think of us fondly,
please,

402
00:20:53,446 --> 00:20:55,489
As ships departing
a sinking rat.

403
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:58,993
Well, make a good
union man.

404
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:00,119
Ha ha ha!

405
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,578
What was that
all about?

406
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,580
Uh, mr. Woollcott,

407
00:21:03,622 --> 00:21:06,583
Have to remind you,
as of this week,

408
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,877
Drinking alcohol
here is illegal.

409
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:12,463
Geoplenarian,
i am interested only in things

410
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:15,591
That are illegal, immoral,
or fattening.

411
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:17,593
It's wine,
not alcohol.

412
00:21:17,635 --> 00:21:19,053
Ice, please.

413
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:28,061
Are you all right,
mrs. Parker?

414
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:29,854
Oh, that man
is a mess.

415
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:32,357
Kaufman...Oh, i think
he's rather quick.

416
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:33,691
Is that
what his name is?

417
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:34,567
Yes.

418
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:37,236
Oh, i never saw
such a thing.

419
00:21:37,236 --> 00:21:40,531
He's a twitchy fella.

420
00:21:40,572 --> 00:21:45,077
Mr. Benchley, are you
quite sure about this?

421
00:21:45,077 --> 00:21:46,578
Positive, mrs. Parker.

422
00:21:46,578 --> 00:21:50,457
Listen, you can't buy
the kind of advertising

423
00:21:50,498 --> 00:21:51,291
They'll be giving us.

424
00:21:51,332 --> 00:21:51,958
We'll be freelancers.

425
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,792
Oh, my god.

426
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:54,710
We'll write
only what we like,

427
00:21:54,752 --> 00:21:58,214
Not slave over a hot desk
for people like conde nast.

428
00:21:58,214 --> 00:22:00,883
Have you told
gertrude?

429
00:22:00,924 --> 00:22:02,050
Pardon.

430
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:09,265
Is there a problem?

431
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:10,433
Don't worry
about a thing.

432
00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:11,351
I've set this kind
of fracture before

433
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:12,518
Without much pain,

434
00:22:12,518 --> 00:22:13,728
But we must get started
immediately.

435
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,563
Mrs. Beemish,
please take a seat.

436
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:16,355
Does it hurt?

437
00:22:16,397 --> 00:22:17,356
Oh, it's dreadful.

438
00:22:17,356 --> 00:22:18,190
Please don't try
to speak.

439
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,109
I need room to work.

440
00:22:23,362 --> 00:22:24,488
We'll rent an office
together,

441
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:25,280
Move in,

442
00:22:25,322 --> 00:22:26,531
Cheer each other on.

443
00:22:26,573 --> 00:22:28,283
You can try your dainty
hand at fiction,

444
00:22:28,325 --> 00:22:30,618
And i'll start
my history

445
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,496
Of the queen anne humorists...
Both of them.

446
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:36,165
Mr. Benchley...

447
00:22:36,207 --> 00:22:39,543
I feel as though you're
proposing marriage.

448
00:22:39,585 --> 00:22:42,337
Many torments lie
in the small circle

449
00:22:42,379 --> 00:22:44,298
Of a wedding ring.

450
00:22:44,298 --> 00:22:45,924
What if
it doesn't work?

451
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:47,926
Well, we'll just
yearn a living.

452
00:22:47,968 --> 00:22:51,679
First, we need a name
for the office door.

453
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:54,015
Utica drop forge
and tool company.

454
00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:55,141
Perfect.

455
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,726
Robert benchley,
president.

456
00:22:56,767 --> 00:23:00,229
Dorothy parker,
president.

457
00:23:00,271 --> 00:23:03,440
Dorothy...

458
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,733
I could kiss you,

459
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:08,445
But i'm not sure
it would come out right.

460
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:10,738
You're afraid
you might

461
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,950
Melt the gold
in my teeth.

462
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:15,743
Huh?

463
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:18,746
Afraid i might
lose you.

464
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:21,457
I know
i'm losing eddie.

465
00:23:21,498 --> 00:23:24,251
I couldn't bear
losing you, too.

466
00:23:24,293 --> 00:23:26,545
You'd have to wear a pretty
large hole in your pocket

467
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:29,547
To lose me,
mrs. Parker.

468
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:31,341
The eggs
are getting cold.

469
00:23:31,382 --> 00:23:32,717
Ah.

470
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:45,479
Much better.

471
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,481
Have to be comfortable
when i sit down to write,

472
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:50,483
Because that's where
i shine.

473
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:56,489
Park bench.

474
00:23:56,489 --> 00:23:57,698
Mm-Hmm.

475
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,783
May i tell her
who's calling?

476
00:23:59,825 --> 00:24:01,994
Does the cent sign
go before or after?

477
00:24:01,994 --> 00:24:03,245
After.

478
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:04,496
This is mr. Nichols.

479
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:07,290
Wants to know
where your story is.

480
00:24:07,332 --> 00:24:08,792
Oh.

481
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,002
Tell him something,
will you?

482
00:24:12,337 --> 00:24:15,590
I'm afraid mrs. Parker's had
some sort of an attack.

483
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:17,800
They're in the process now
of freezing her appendix.

484
00:24:17,842 --> 00:24:19,343
The doctor thinks
we may get it

485
00:24:19,385 --> 00:24:22,804
To listen to reason
this way.

486
00:24:22,804 --> 00:24:25,974
Yeah. All right.
Certainly.

487
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:27,309
Good-Bye.

488
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,479
Has to be in
by tomorrow.

489
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:34,232
Oh. Shit.

490
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:38,986
I may die before a train of
thought leaves the station.

491
00:24:39,028 --> 00:24:41,447
Me, too.

492
00:24:41,488 --> 00:24:43,448
Let's change places.

493
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,283
All right.

494
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,455
Hmm...well.
Pardon me.

495
00:24:50,497 --> 00:24:52,290
Excuse me.

496
00:25:03,217 --> 00:25:08,638
We'd build a little bungalow,
if you and i were one,

497
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:14,352
And carefully we'd plan it
so we'd get the morning sun.

498
00:25:14,393 --> 00:25:18,355
I'd rise each day
at rosy dawn

499
00:25:18,355 --> 00:25:20,482
And bustle gaily down.

500
00:25:20,524 --> 00:25:23,777
In evening's cool,
you'd spray the lawn

501
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:26,863
When you come back
from town.

502
00:25:26,863 --> 00:25:30,492
If you and i were one,
my dear,

503
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:32,827
A model life we'd lead.

504
00:25:32,827 --> 00:25:36,789
We'd travel on
from year to year,

505
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:41,210
At no increase of speed.

506
00:25:41,251 --> 00:25:44,671
Ah, clear to me
the vision of the things

507
00:25:44,713 --> 00:25:47,674
That we should do.

508
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:51,553
And so i think it best,
my love,

509
00:25:51,594 --> 00:25:53,971
To string along as two.

510
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:55,473
Here, dear?

511
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:57,016
Oh, to the right.

512
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:01,311
Oh, how do you do?
I'm neyso mcmain.

513
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,479
I'm your neighbor.

514
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:04,773
Would you like
a drink?

515
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:06,441
Sworn off.
Thank you.

516
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,777
Oh, well, if you should
ever want to come by,

517
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:11,863
My door is open,
day and night.

518
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:15,533
Hotel algonquin.
Please hold.

519
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,785
O'neill's won
the pulitzer, aleck!

520
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,745
Hey, john.
How are you?

521
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,331
Hello, mr. Woollcott.
How you doing?

522
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,124
You know everyone.
Everyone, will.

523
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,459
Mr. Benchley.

524
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,127
How do you do?
Robert benchley.

525
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,461
Will rogers.

526
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,255
Nice to meet you,
miss parker.

527
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:33,508
I never liked a man
i didn't meet.

528
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:35,009
Thank you, i guess.

529
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,303
So, aleck, will rogers
for president.

530
00:26:37,344 --> 00:26:38,095
What do you think?

531
00:26:38,137 --> 00:26:39,471
Get out of here.

532
00:26:39,513 --> 00:26:40,514
Now that women
have the vote,

533
00:26:40,556 --> 00:26:41,682
What do you think,
ladies?

534
00:26:41,682 --> 00:26:45,185
It is a lovely hat.

535
00:26:45,185 --> 00:26:47,520
It's the hat that gets
you in the white house.

536
00:26:47,562 --> 00:26:48,855
This must be
the smallest table

537
00:26:48,897 --> 00:26:50,857
In the biggest city
on the planet here.

538
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:52,191
You folks got sore knees
under there?

539
00:26:52,191 --> 00:26:57,321
We need a ouija board.
We'd divine the future.

540
00:26:57,363 --> 00:26:59,156
Future looks
pretty divine to me.

541
00:26:59,198 --> 00:27:05,787
Georges, tell mr. Case
i've had a great idea.

542
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:07,831
He might not
believe it, sir.

543
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:11,167
If ziegfeld changed the name
of the show...

544
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:12,335
I'm sorry.
What did you say?

545
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:14,212
Wisdom, every word.

546
00:27:14,253 --> 00:27:16,297
Serge.

547
00:28:40,874 --> 00:28:44,169
Ross, use the word "dog"
in a sentence.

548
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:48,256
We'll give you time.

549
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:49,466
Get her a drink.

550
00:28:49,507 --> 00:28:51,009
Would you
like a drink?

551
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,636
Please, come.

552
00:28:55,304 --> 00:28:56,555
Well, neyso, i think

553
00:28:56,597 --> 00:28:57,973
If you loiter in your
studio long enough,

554
00:28:58,015 --> 00:29:00,601
The whole world will
drift in and out.

555
00:29:00,642 --> 00:29:01,643
That's the point.

556
00:29:01,685 --> 00:29:02,728
Sour trumpet
at the end

557
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:04,730
Of a third-Rate
marching band.

558
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:07,107
Round of cards?
I'll get the girls.

559
00:29:07,107 --> 00:29:08,441
The girls?

560
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:09,818
Poker.
Yes, i'd love to.

561
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:11,277
You're a celebrity,
george, face it.

562
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:13,571
Right.
A temporary one.

563
00:29:13,613 --> 00:29:14,614
There's not
another kind.

564
00:29:14,614 --> 00:29:16,240
My point exactly.

565
00:29:16,282 --> 00:29:17,324
Come on, don.
Ardent fidelity.

566
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:18,284
That's
the first thing

567
00:29:18,284 --> 00:29:19,326
That springs
to your mind

568
00:29:19,368 --> 00:29:20,577
When you think
of mrs. Parker.

569
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:21,787
Well, it's not
the first thing,

570
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:26,666
But gradually, i work
my way back around.

571
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:27,792
let's take a walk
through here.

572
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,627
I'll show you some
of miss mcmain's

573
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:32,297
Extraordinarily
useless object d'art.

574
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:34,090
Your apartment
is just lovely.

575
00:29:34,132 --> 00:29:36,509
You think?
It's that slavic architecture.

576
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,344
It's just like
a dormitory here.

577
00:29:38,427 --> 00:29:40,346
Oh, ho.

578
00:29:40,387 --> 00:29:42,473
Just like
a dormitory here.

579
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:43,682
I was
just saying,

580
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:44,975
The par...Well,
here they are now.

581
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:47,227
The parkers live just
across the hall.

582
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:49,020
That's why...

583
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,314
It's kind of you letting
robert sleep over

584
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,440
When he
works late.

585
00:29:52,482 --> 00:29:53,566
Sometimes
i think

586
00:29:53,608 --> 00:29:55,318
You see more of
him than i do.

587
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,277
I'm always
very modest.

588
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,153
You know that,
gertrude.

589
00:29:57,194 --> 00:29:58,320
It must
be wonderful

590
00:29:58,362 --> 00:30:00,322
To never have babies
waking you up.

591
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:02,991
They don't allow
babies in dormitories.

592
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:05,452
not that there's anything
wrong with babies.

593
00:30:05,494 --> 00:30:06,411
If there were,
gertrude,

594
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:09,164
You'd be arrested
by now.

595
00:30:09,164 --> 00:30:11,791
ha ha! Well...

596
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:15,628
I'm sorry. I...
i didn't understand.

597
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,463
For being so good
with them.

598
00:30:17,505 --> 00:30:18,923
Thank you.

599
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:20,299
and you are good
with them, god knows.

600
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:21,383
They worship her.

601
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:24,219
I don't think
they know who i am.

602
00:30:24,261 --> 00:30:25,262
Aren't you and eddie
anxious

603
00:30:25,303 --> 00:30:26,638
To start a family
of your own?

604
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,474
Oh, good...
heavens no.

605
00:30:29,474 --> 00:30:32,060
My mother was 42
when i was born.

606
00:30:32,101 --> 00:30:33,352
Of course, then
she promptly went

607
00:30:33,394 --> 00:30:34,562
And died on me,

608
00:30:34,604 --> 00:30:37,565
So maybe waiting
isn't such a good idea.

609
00:30:37,606 --> 00:30:40,484
Reminds me,
i need another drink.

610
00:30:40,526 --> 00:30:41,276
Anybody?

611
00:30:41,276 --> 00:30:43,445
Uh, no. No.

612
00:30:43,487 --> 00:30:45,489
You know, my mother
was 34 when she had me,

613
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,741
But then again,
she had the good graces

614
00:30:47,782 --> 00:30:50,160
To wait until i was 12
before she passed away.

615
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:53,496
she was always
the politest of women.

616
00:30:53,538 --> 00:30:55,706
oh, well, here's
a lovely picture...

617
00:30:55,748 --> 00:30:57,583
Benchley
and his two wives.

618
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:58,417
Not nice, aleck.

619
00:30:58,417 --> 00:30:59,752
Oh, come on, sherry.

620
00:30:59,752 --> 00:31:02,212
Don't say it's
an intellectual relationship.

621
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:03,255
What does
that mean?

622
00:31:03,297 --> 00:31:04,548
Yes,
what does that mean?

623
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:07,092
In their minds,
they "mmm" like bunnies.

624
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:09,636
Oh, mr. Benchley.

625
00:31:09,677 --> 00:31:11,804
How's eddie doing?
He seems all right.

626
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:15,433
Well, i think he's
off the morphine, anyway.

627
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:17,143
Now he wants to move
back to hartford

628
00:31:17,184 --> 00:31:19,144
To be near his family.

629
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:20,771
I don't know.

630
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:23,273
Maybe it'll be easier
for him there.

631
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:26,651
At least they know
how to keep house.

632
00:31:26,693 --> 00:31:29,696
Wifely chores can be
lethal, mr. Benchley.

633
00:31:29,737 --> 00:31:31,197
Only if done
properly.

634
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:33,574
You're much too hard on yourself,
mrs. Parker.

635
00:31:33,616 --> 00:31:35,409
A little garbage
gives a house

636
00:31:35,451 --> 00:31:36,494
That lived-In
feeling.

637
00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:37,661
Robert.

638
00:31:37,703 --> 00:31:40,164
Pull a bed sheet
over it or something.

639
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,749
The coward's way out?

640
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,125
robert.

641
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:46,711
Excuse me, please.
I must find the ladies room.

642
00:31:46,753 --> 00:31:49,214
It's just to the left here.
Right...

643
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:50,840
Right around
the corner there.

644
00:31:50,882 --> 00:31:53,301
Do you know where
the ladies room is?

645
00:31:53,301 --> 00:31:55,011
Here, take
one of mine.

646
00:31:55,052 --> 00:31:56,345
No, i don't drink.

647
00:31:56,387 --> 00:31:58,139
All right.
It's just in the back.

648
00:31:58,139 --> 00:32:01,141
Oh, uh, you've, uh,
forgotten your, uh...

649
00:32:01,183 --> 00:32:03,936
Soul, as usual.

650
00:32:05,812 --> 00:32:07,772
If our mrs. Parker
used her body

651
00:32:07,772 --> 00:32:09,774
The way she uses
her mouth...

652
00:32:09,774 --> 00:32:11,109
Dottie,
20 questions.

653
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:12,694
I'm thinking
of a person.

654
00:32:12,735 --> 00:32:14,695
I'm so happy
for you, ross.

655
00:32:14,737 --> 00:32:16,781
Would he be
the kind of man

656
00:32:16,822 --> 00:32:18,824
To put the wings
back on flies?

657
00:32:18,866 --> 00:32:20,617
I know nothing
about entomology.

658
00:32:20,617 --> 00:32:22,953
Compassion, not bugs.
Right?

659
00:32:22,953 --> 00:32:25,288
Who's that sitting
with deems taylor?

660
00:32:25,288 --> 00:32:26,748
Mary kennedy.

661
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,958
She's consoling him
through his divorce.

662
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,585
But if i were you,

663
00:32:30,627 --> 00:32:33,713
I would be paying more
attention to my own flanks

664
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:35,965
Than to his
at the moment.

665
00:32:37,883 --> 00:32:41,261
Paula, i see you've met
my little husband.

666
00:32:41,303 --> 00:32:43,805
Oh! So this
is eddie.

667
00:32:43,847 --> 00:32:44,598
Hmm.

668
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:46,558
Well, how's
your arm, dear?

669
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,892
My arm?

670
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:49,352
Why, yes.
Dottie said you broke it

671
00:32:49,394 --> 00:32:51,771
Sharpening
a pencil?

672
00:32:51,813 --> 00:32:53,398
Did she?
Excuse me.

673
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:56,484
You did say that,
didn't you, dot?

674
00:32:56,525 --> 00:32:59,445
Paula, your slip
is showing.

675
00:32:59,486 --> 00:33:01,321
It's on purpose,
dear.

676
00:33:01,363 --> 00:33:02,656
Hmm.

677
00:33:02,656 --> 00:33:04,991
How like your acting
that is.

678
00:33:04,991 --> 00:33:07,244
Excuse me.

679
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,953
Ha ha ha.

680
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:11,247
Ah, hello, frank.

681
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,666
Take care of
your body, paula,

682
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:15,459
Because
when it goes,

683
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:17,753
You'll have
nothing left.

684
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:22,674
Shouldn't you
leave some

685
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:24,217
For the other
guests, eddie?

686
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:25,427
I have to exercise my arm

687
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:27,762
After all those weeks
in a cast, dear.

688
00:33:27,804 --> 00:33:29,139
I never said
such a thing.

689
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:30,557
Sure, you did.

690
00:33:30,598 --> 00:33:33,059
They know better than
to expect anything from me,

691
00:33:33,101 --> 00:33:34,727
Thanks to you.

692
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:35,728
You don't want
to become

693
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,646
The town drunk,
eddie,

694
00:33:37,688 --> 00:33:38,647
Not
in manhattan.

695
00:33:38,689 --> 00:33:39,607
You know,
i think that you

696
00:33:39,648 --> 00:33:42,359
Ought to drink
more, dear.

697
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:45,695
Then maybe you could
stop nagging me.

698
00:33:48,615 --> 00:33:54,287
I may be a dimwit
and a lousy drunk, dear,

699
00:33:54,328 --> 00:33:56,664
But you
and your friends...

700
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,459
Eddie.

701
00:34:00,501 --> 00:34:01,752
Oh!

702
00:34:01,794 --> 00:34:05,297
It's o.K. It's o.K.
It's o.K.

703
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:36,158
I'm sorry.

704
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,785
I'm sorry. I...

705
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:39,745
I didn't know
what to do,

706
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:43,749
So i...i just
held my breath.

707
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,668
Are...Are you
all right?

708
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,839
I'm just so grateful
robert doesn't drink.

709
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,216
His uncle did,
you know,

710
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,093
So he's seen
the damage done.

711
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,805
Do you really
like that?

712
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,683
Not much.

713
00:35:02,724 --> 00:35:06,311
But it's better than
a sock in the eye.

714
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:10,940
Ha ha ha!

715
00:35:10,982 --> 00:35:14,110
So anyway, i asked him
if he'd ever read

716
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,444
Edna ferber's new book.

717
00:35:15,486 --> 00:35:17,113
It's a very full book.

718
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:18,739
Full of what,
ross?

719
00:35:18,781 --> 00:35:20,115
Full of
not being edited.

720
00:35:20,115 --> 00:35:21,533
And this from
the editor

721
00:35:21,575 --> 00:35:22,951
Of american legion
magazine, mind you.

722
00:35:22,951 --> 00:35:24,077
You could do

723
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,413
With a little trimming yourself,
my dumpling.

724
00:35:26,454 --> 00:35:27,247
So it's thin,
thinning,

725
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:28,415
Or needs thinning.

726
00:35:28,456 --> 00:35:29,791
Three words aleck
has never heard of.

727
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:32,585
That's almost
a subjective completion.

728
00:35:32,627 --> 00:35:34,629
What ross means is that
stories flow easily

729
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,963
From edna's
fingertips.

730
00:35:36,005 --> 00:35:38,090
i understand
she fairly whistles

731
00:35:38,132 --> 00:35:39,592
At her typewriter.

732
00:35:39,633 --> 00:35:42,427
And there was that poor
sucker flaubert

733
00:35:42,427 --> 00:35:44,388
Rolling around
on the floor for days,

734
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:46,223
Looking for just
the right words.

735
00:35:46,223 --> 00:35:48,767
well, dottie, i do
love your pieces,

736
00:35:48,808 --> 00:35:50,768
And when ross launches
his new magazine,

737
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,770
You'll have to be
part of it.

738
00:35:52,812 --> 00:35:54,772
No other woman
writes like you do.

739
00:35:54,814 --> 00:35:56,273
Who would
want to?

740
00:35:56,315 --> 00:35:58,067
Listen, i read
your new piece

741
00:35:58,067 --> 00:35:58,859
In the smart set

742
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:00,194
Over and over
again, dottie.

743
00:36:00,235 --> 00:36:01,320
It was wonderful.

744
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:02,571
How sweet, ross.

745
00:36:02,613 --> 00:36:04,364
Didn't he understand
it the first time?

746
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,035
Alan, dust off your tutu.
It's official.

747
00:36:09,035 --> 00:36:10,703
We've rented
the 49th street theater

748
00:36:10,745 --> 00:36:12,205
For sunday, april 30th.

749
00:36:12,205 --> 00:36:14,790
Bravo!
Hey!

750
00:36:14,832 --> 00:36:17,585
As our treasurer, i feel
compelled to ask...

751
00:36:17,626 --> 00:36:18,752
How much?

752
00:36:18,794 --> 00:36:20,045
I made
a great deal.

753
00:36:20,087 --> 00:36:21,922
They gave us the sleeves
off their vests.

754
00:36:21,964 --> 00:36:23,507
Kaufman should have
negotiated.

755
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:24,633
He's
the christ killer.

756
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:26,051
One more slur
upon my race, aleck,

757
00:36:26,092 --> 00:36:27,636
And i'm walking away
from this table,

758
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:30,221
Out of the dining room,
and away from this hotel.

759
00:36:30,263 --> 00:36:31,306
I trust that mrs. Parker

760
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:35,142
Will walk out with me
halfway?

761
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:36,352
Raoul fleischmann
was 14

762
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,479
Before he realized
he was a jew.

763
00:36:38,479 --> 00:36:40,481
I was 16 before
i realized i was a boy.

764
00:36:40,522 --> 00:36:42,441
What convinced you?

765
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:43,525
Gravity.

766
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:45,235
Sex laws
of a newton.

767
00:36:45,277 --> 00:36:47,779
Mmm. Chemin de fer.

768
00:36:47,779 --> 00:36:49,030
Mirabile
dictum.

769
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:50,615
Oh!
Oh!

770
00:36:50,615 --> 00:36:51,824
What on earth
are they talking about?

771
00:36:51,866 --> 00:36:53,284
And don't tell me
you understand.

772
00:36:53,284 --> 00:36:56,662
Too much for
your precious ears.

773
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,957
Why,
speaking of stage-Struck jewish nuns,

774
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:02,000
Here's edna!

775
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:04,711
You almost look like
a man today, edna.

776
00:37:04,753 --> 00:37:06,588
So do you, aleck.

777
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:09,758
Madam ferber's so
diligent in her duties,

778
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:11,718
I'm surprised
she's deigned to join us.

779
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:13,761
Well, coffee and sandwiches
aren't my usual,

780
00:37:13,803 --> 00:37:15,554
But don't make me out
a dullard to your friends.

781
00:37:15,554 --> 00:37:17,515
I always say, "there's
no good sauce for play

782
00:37:17,556 --> 00:37:19,141
Like hard work."

783
00:37:19,183 --> 00:37:20,934
Please, sit down.

784
00:37:20,976 --> 00:37:22,394
Bite your tongue,
mistress,

785
00:37:22,436 --> 00:37:26,273
Before our mrs. Parker
does it for you.

786
00:37:26,314 --> 00:37:27,816
Ah, the two of you split

787
00:37:27,857 --> 00:37:29,484
Without having written
a flop yet, hey, marc?

788
00:37:29,526 --> 00:37:30,818
That'll be
the day.

789
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,404
Oh, flops...
These days, they're just a play

790
00:37:33,404 --> 00:37:35,197
Where no one wears
evening clothes.

791
00:37:35,197 --> 00:37:37,783
An edna ferberating statement
if ever i've heard one.

792
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:40,285
Oh, that couldn't be
ferber from the truth.

793
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:41,662
You know
what i admire?

794
00:37:41,703 --> 00:37:42,746
An artist who's
got enough brio

795
00:37:42,788 --> 00:37:44,665
To embrace
main street.

796
00:37:44,706 --> 00:37:45,665
Though the range
of his works

797
00:37:45,707 --> 00:37:48,376
May be from
bad to horrible?

798
00:37:48,376 --> 00:37:50,253
I think far
too wide a stretch

799
00:37:50,295 --> 00:37:52,463
Is made of
the word "artist,"

800
00:37:52,505 --> 00:37:53,339
Because
i don't think

801
00:37:53,381 --> 00:37:55,675
That word is
elastic.

802
00:37:55,675 --> 00:38:00,637
If i did, i'd be
better company.

803
00:38:00,637 --> 00:38:02,055
Well, i think

804
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:05,392
You're wonderful
company, mrs. Parker.

805
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:08,436
Homemade fudge,
anyone?

806
00:38:08,478 --> 00:38:09,771
Edna, uh...

807
00:38:09,813 --> 00:38:11,439
I love your fudge,
george.

808
00:38:11,481 --> 00:38:13,107
Who's the actual
producer

809
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:14,734
Of no good ring?

810
00:38:14,775 --> 00:38:16,027
my little dream princess,

811
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:19,780
I will plan, cast, and polish
the entire revue

812
00:38:19,822 --> 00:38:22,282
With my usual
revolutionary taste.

813
00:38:22,282 --> 00:38:23,617
The devil you will.

814
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:29,205
Ladies and gentlemen,

815
00:38:29,247 --> 00:38:33,876
Tonight, 12 rounds
in 3 acts

816
00:38:33,918 --> 00:38:38,088
Of unregulated
artistic impulse.

817
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,341
In the well-Lit
corner,

818
00:38:40,382 --> 00:38:41,759
The vicious circle

819
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,969
Of the hotel
algonquin.

820
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:46,513
Algonquin.

821
00:38:46,555 --> 00:38:48,264
And in the darkened
corner,

822
00:38:48,306 --> 00:38:49,724
Well, the sort
of thing

823
00:38:49,724 --> 00:38:52,352
One usually finds in
a darkened corner.

824
00:38:52,393 --> 00:38:55,062
Tonight,
the no-Walkout rule

825
00:38:55,104 --> 00:38:56,897
Will be in effect,

826
00:38:56,897 --> 00:38:58,816
And our judges
this evening

827
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:01,276
Will be your trampled
sensitivities.

828
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:04,154
We shall be quite vulgar
and unduly exhibitionist,

829
00:39:04,196 --> 00:39:07,616
Chief characteristic
distinguishing man from beast,

830
00:39:07,657 --> 00:39:11,536
And so now, as usual,
we'll shoot ourselves.

831
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:21,879
* we got the blues

832
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,841
* we believe we said before
we got the blues *

833
00:39:25,882 --> 00:39:29,344
* they're little flappers,
never growin' up *

834
00:39:29,344 --> 00:39:32,847
* and they've all been flappin'
since belasco was a pup *

835
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:34,265
* we got the blues

836
00:39:34,307 --> 00:39:35,349
* they've got the blues

837
00:39:35,391 --> 00:39:36,642
* we got the blues...

838
00:39:36,684 --> 00:39:38,310
Didn't know
you played.

839
00:39:38,394 --> 00:39:40,270
Yes. That was
my execution.

840
00:39:40,312 --> 00:39:42,898
* we got the blues

841
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,276
* i'm an ingenue,
and i've got the blues *

842
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:49,988
* as everyone
can plainly see *

843
00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:53,783
* it's 'cause an ingenue
must promise to *

844
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:57,078
* imprison
her virginity *

845
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,498
* i check my maidenhead
in my producer's bed *

846
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:05,210
* oh, gosh, i guess
the joke's on me *

847
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:06,294
* we got the blues...

848
00:40:06,336 --> 00:40:07,754
They're extremely depressed,

849
00:40:07,796 --> 00:40:10,590
And there's nothing
that i can do about it.

850
00:40:10,632 --> 00:40:13,342
Ah, the prodigal bum
has returned.

851
00:40:13,384 --> 00:40:14,635
How's it going?

852
00:40:14,677 --> 00:40:17,513
Why are you
writing numbers?

853
00:40:17,555 --> 00:40:18,722
Mmm. My report.

854
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:20,391
Report? What about
the sketch, man?

855
00:40:20,432 --> 00:40:21,016
Your sketch.

856
00:40:21,058 --> 00:40:21,975
Sketch?

857
00:40:22,017 --> 00:40:23,560
Your sketch.
You're next. You're on.

858
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,936
You wanted an account
of the finances.

859
00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:27,063
That's what connelly
told me.

860
00:40:27,063 --> 00:40:29,065
Don't point the scinger
of forn at me, benchley.

861
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:30,066
Dorothy...

862
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:30,900
If you want to drink,
ruin your life...

863
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:31,901
Share this.

864
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:34,028
Your friend's in need
of inspiration.

865
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,614
Liquor makes people
behave unlike themselves.

866
00:40:36,655 --> 00:40:38,157
Why would you
want people

867
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,533
To behave
like themselves?

868
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:41,035
Well,
in your case, i...

869
00:40:41,076 --> 00:40:42,703
Ahem.

870
00:40:45,622 --> 00:40:50,210
It's like
a train station.

871
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,502
Don't look at me

872
00:40:51,544 --> 00:40:53,504
In that tone of voice,
mr. Benchley.

873
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,172
May i see that,
please?

874
00:40:55,214 --> 00:40:56,340
Thank you.

875
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,842
Oh, it's
my uncle albert.

876
00:40:57,842 --> 00:40:59,593
That's exactly
how he smelled.

877
00:40:59,635 --> 00:41:00,469
What's
it taste like?

878
00:41:00,511 --> 00:41:02,346
Like it smells.

879
00:41:02,387 --> 00:41:03,597
Now, give it here.

880
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:05,515
I won't be the cause
of your corruption.

881
00:41:05,557 --> 00:41:07,100
My corruption?

882
00:41:07,142 --> 00:41:08,601
Two minutes,
you're on.

883
00:41:08,643 --> 00:41:11,354
Come along and hold me up,
mrs. Parker.

884
00:41:12,522 --> 00:41:14,023
* never growing up

885
00:41:14,065 --> 00:41:16,817
* and we've all been flapping
since belasco was a pup *

886
00:41:16,817 --> 00:41:18,277
* we got the blues

887
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,612
They've got
the blues.

888
00:41:19,612 --> 00:41:20,946
* we got the blues...

889
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:22,948
Too bad eddie
didn't stick around.

890
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:26,618
He likes leg
and fanny numbers.

891
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:29,329
He went back
to hartford?

892
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:32,415
And it was all
going so well.

893
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:34,083
*...blues *

894
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:37,002
* copeland and connelly,
connelly and copeland *

895
00:41:37,044 --> 00:41:39,546
* the playwrights
of the prairie *

896
00:41:39,588 --> 00:41:41,632
Hey, girls, how'd you like
to be in a show?

897
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:42,925
Yeah!
Yeah!

898
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:46,553
All right, let's go back
to the dressing room

899
00:41:46,595 --> 00:41:47,804
And, uh, talk.

900
00:41:47,846 --> 00:41:49,013
What's funny
is a laugh

901
00:41:49,055 --> 00:41:50,598
Wrapped inside a fact.
That's funny.

902
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,599
That's funny.

903
00:41:51,641 --> 00:41:52,725
That would
be some of

904
00:41:52,767 --> 00:41:54,727
Our mrs. Parker's
unprintable verse.

905
00:41:54,727 --> 00:41:56,354
Come on. Come on.

906
00:41:56,395 --> 00:41:58,230
You're in a broadway
theater now.

907
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,107
Behave yourself.

908
00:42:00,149 --> 00:42:02,401
Careful, please!

909
00:42:04,444 --> 00:42:06,488
Oh, careful
of the tomatoes.

910
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,198
Wonderful!
Wonderful!

911
00:42:08,198 --> 00:42:09,866
New careers
for everyone.

912
00:42:09,866 --> 00:42:11,200
Very nice.

913
00:42:15,913 --> 00:42:17,790
It's an obsession
with women's clothing.

914
00:42:17,832 --> 00:42:19,041
Oh, you look wonderful.

915
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:21,668
Jane, listen,
i can't go to this party.

916
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,211
Please,
can we not go?

917
00:42:23,253 --> 00:42:25,005
Get out of my way,
ross.

918
00:42:25,005 --> 00:42:26,339
I'm here with
someone with talent.

919
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:27,841
Oh!

920
00:42:27,882 --> 00:42:31,970
Thank you, mr. Sherwood
and your lovely companions.

921
00:42:32,011 --> 00:42:34,222
Certainly, "he who gets flapped"

922
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:38,350
Loses nothing in its translation
from the original russian.

923
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:39,685
And now,

924
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:42,980
It is with a great sense
of mystery that i...

925
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:45,190
Try to pay attention,
mrs. Parker.

926
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:46,441
Don't break a leg.

927
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:47,651
Mr. Robert benchley...

928
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:48,651
I'll enter
from the trenches.

929
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:50,862
And his report.

930
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,751
I shall, uh,

931
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:09,796
Take but a very few moments
of your time this evening.

932
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:11,172
I realize
that you'd much rather

933
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:15,676
Be listening to
this interesting entertainment

934
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,012
Than to a dry
financial report.

935
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,722
Ahem.

936
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,099
But, uh, i am reminded
of a story

937
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:25,727
Which you have probably,
all of you, heard.

938
00:43:25,727 --> 00:43:28,563
Uh, it seems that there were
these two irishmen

939
00:43:28,563 --> 00:43:30,773
Walking down the street,

940
00:43:30,815 --> 00:43:33,276
But when they came up...
They came to a...

941
00:43:33,317 --> 00:43:35,236
Oh, i should have said that
in the first place,

942
00:43:35,236 --> 00:43:41,158
That the store belonging to
the irish...The first irishman...

943
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,201
The first fella's store...

944
00:43:46,371 --> 00:43:48,540
Uh, well, anyway...

945
00:43:48,581 --> 00:43:51,042
The, uh, parrot...

946
00:43:54,795 --> 00:43:56,589
Now, in connection
with reading this report,

947
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,174
There are one or two points

948
00:43:58,174 --> 00:44:00,676
Dr. Murnie wanted brought up
in connection with it,

949
00:44:00,676 --> 00:44:03,470
And he has asked me
to bring them up in...

950
00:44:03,512 --> 00:44:04,304
To bring them up.

951
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,389
The first is in regard

952
00:44:06,431 --> 00:44:08,475
To the work that
we are trying to do

953
00:44:08,516 --> 00:44:10,602
At our little place
at silver lake...

954
00:44:10,643 --> 00:44:11,894
A work that we feel

955
00:44:11,936 --> 00:44:13,521
Not only fills
a very definite need

956
00:44:13,563 --> 00:44:15,147
In the community,

957
00:44:15,147 --> 00:44:18,442
But also fills
a very definite need...

958
00:44:18,484 --> 00:44:20,027
In the community.

959
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:21,403
Ahem.

960
00:44:21,445 --> 00:44:23,363
Uh, the...i don't think

961
00:44:23,405 --> 00:44:26,491
Many of our members
of our society

962
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:27,951
Realize just how big
the work is

963
00:44:27,993 --> 00:44:29,619
We're trying to do
up there.

964
00:44:29,661 --> 00:44:31,496
For instance,
i don't think it's generally known

965
00:44:31,537 --> 00:44:32,914
That most
of our boys

966
00:44:32,955 --> 00:44:34,957
Are between
the age of 14.

967
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:40,421
Uh, we feel that by taking
the boy at this age,

968
00:44:40,462 --> 00:44:43,507
We can get closer
to his real nature,

969
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:46,426
And a boy has
a very real nature,

970
00:44:46,426 --> 00:44:48,553
You may be sure.

971
00:44:48,595 --> 00:44:50,930
Dottie, i'd like you
to meet

972
00:44:50,972 --> 00:44:53,558
My new discovery...
Baby vomit.

973
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:55,351
Beware,
her lacy sleeve

974
00:44:55,393 --> 00:44:56,394
Has a bottle
of vitriol

975
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:57,770
Concealed
in its folds.

976
00:44:57,812 --> 00:44:58,562
Get a load
of this guy.

977
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:00,064
Blows into tony's

978
00:45:00,105 --> 00:45:02,774
Like something cut loose
from the macy's day parade,

979
00:45:02,816 --> 00:45:05,485
Brings me here to meet
one of my favorite writers,

980
00:45:05,527 --> 00:45:07,320
Forgets my name.

981
00:45:07,362 --> 00:45:09,197
Well, it's charles.
Charlie.

982
00:45:09,197 --> 00:45:10,865
Charlie macarthur.

983
00:45:10,907 --> 00:45:12,075
Pleased to meet you,
mr. Vomit.

984
00:45:18,622 --> 00:45:21,750
charlie's new
at the american.

985
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:23,335
Very amusing fellow
from chicago

986
00:45:23,335 --> 00:45:24,795
With theatrical
ambitions.

987
00:45:24,836 --> 00:45:26,004
I thought i'd
lay him at your feet

988
00:45:26,004 --> 00:45:27,505
Like the faithful
retriever i am.

989
00:45:27,547 --> 00:45:29,007
Bad dog, aleck.

990
00:45:29,007 --> 00:45:31,759
I heard your husband
might be away.

991
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:33,094
Well, his wife's
in chicago.

992
00:45:33,136 --> 00:45:36,263
Do you meddle in all your friends'
sex lives

993
00:45:36,305 --> 00:45:38,390
Just because
they have them?

994
00:45:38,432 --> 00:45:39,850
I knew
you'd be pleased.

995
00:45:39,892 --> 00:45:43,353
Now, it seems to me
that the people who criti...

996
00:45:43,395 --> 00:45:45,439
Why, criticize, that, uh...

997
00:45:47,274 --> 00:45:49,317
The, uh, the people who...

998
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,069
Why, as a matter of fact,

999
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:55,323
It was done just as, uh,
economically as...

1000
00:45:55,364 --> 00:45:57,116
As is possible.

1001
00:45:57,158 --> 00:45:58,909
Even more so.

1002
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,956
Mr. Rossiter, uh,
unfortunately,

1003
00:46:03,997 --> 00:46:06,374
Our treasurer...

1004
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:07,792
Uh...

1005
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:10,003
Mr. Rossiter, our treasurer,

1006
00:46:10,044 --> 00:46:14,382
Unfortunately is confined
to his home

1007
00:46:14,423 --> 00:46:16,676
With a bad head cold,

1008
00:46:16,717 --> 00:46:19,845
And, uh, i, uh...

1009
00:46:19,887 --> 00:46:21,847
Excuse me.

1010
00:46:21,889 --> 00:46:23,181
Ahem.

1011
00:46:27,227 --> 00:46:29,521
Oh.

1012
00:46:29,562 --> 00:46:31,397
Well...

1013
00:46:31,397 --> 00:46:33,900
The joke seems to be
on me.

1014
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,985
Mr. Rossiter has pneumonia.

1015
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:39,113
Who is this guy?

1016
00:46:39,154 --> 00:46:41,031
robert benchley,
life magazine.

1017
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:43,700
That's benchley,
the drama critic?

1018
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,077
Mm-Hmm.
A saint.

1019
00:46:45,118 --> 00:46:46,703
A saint,
no less.

1020
00:46:46,745 --> 00:46:47,621
Well, it's
a good thing

1021
00:46:47,662 --> 00:46:48,872
He's so goddamn
funny.

1022
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,331
Yes, it is.
It's a goddamn good thing.

1023
00:46:50,373 --> 00:46:51,499
Aleck.

1024
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:52,667
What, ruth?

1025
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:53,876
We're next.

1026
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:55,544
Don't worry.
Calm down, ruth.

1027
00:46:55,586 --> 00:46:58,506
The treasurer's,
uh, report.

1028
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:09,265
He was the best
thing in the show,

1029
00:47:09,307 --> 00:47:11,517
So into my column
he goes.

1030
00:47:11,517 --> 00:47:13,061
Robert is a writer,
not an actor.

1031
00:47:13,102 --> 00:47:15,479
Besides, he would never
have time for performing,

1032
00:47:15,521 --> 00:47:19,024
What with myself,
the boys, and his job.

1033
00:47:19,066 --> 00:47:20,442
As it is,
he's got to be careful

1034
00:47:20,484 --> 00:47:22,653
He doesn't work himself
into the ground.

1035
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:24,196
I've seen it happen
before, gertrude.

1036
00:47:24,237 --> 00:47:26,406
Never underestimate
the power of applause.

1037
00:47:26,448 --> 00:47:29,909
Marc, from one's self
expect applause.

1038
00:47:29,951 --> 00:47:31,911
He noblest lives
and noblest dies...

1039
00:47:31,953 --> 00:47:33,913
Help me.
Help me, mrs. Parker.

1040
00:47:33,955 --> 00:47:35,915
Well, irving berlin
and sam harris...

1041
00:47:35,957 --> 00:47:37,958
Right behind you,
directly behind you...

1042
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,169
Want me
and the treasurer's report

1043
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:42,129
To be in their next revue.

1044
00:47:42,129 --> 00:47:43,547
Oh, how do you do?

1045
00:47:43,589 --> 00:47:46,341
Uh, ahem.
It seems that, well, i...I...I...

1046
00:47:46,383 --> 00:47:47,884
I...I...I...

1047
00:47:49,135 --> 00:47:51,429
I couldn't justify
a critic like myself being...

1048
00:47:51,429 --> 00:47:53,097
Well, having a paid job
on stage...

1049
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:56,183
But i didn't want to offend them
and say no,

1050
00:47:56,225 --> 00:47:59,395
So i asked for $500,
and i thought they'd just laugh,

1051
00:47:59,395 --> 00:48:01,063
And the next thing i know,

1052
00:48:01,063 --> 00:48:03,106
Harris is gleaming at me
with those...

1053
00:48:03,148 --> 00:48:05,734
And saying, "for $500,
you better be awfully good."

1054
00:48:05,734 --> 00:48:08,820
I'm a bit flustered.
I guess we'll see what happens.

1055
00:48:08,862 --> 00:48:10,446
Congratulations.
I'm charles macarthur.

1056
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:12,365
How do you do?
I'm robert benchley.

1057
00:48:12,407 --> 00:48:13,699
I'm so sorry.

1058
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:16,202
Excuse me. I have to
tell my wife.

1059
00:48:16,202 --> 00:48:17,620
Excuse me, gertrude.

1060
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,371
Would you
like a drink

1061
00:48:19,413 --> 00:48:21,123
Before
kissing me?

1062
00:48:26,378 --> 00:48:27,671
Yes.

1063
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,006
If i don't drive
around the park,

1064
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:32,884
I'm pretty sure
to make my mark.

1065
00:48:32,925 --> 00:48:36,679
If i'm in bed
each night by 10:00,

1066
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:41,308
I may get back
my looks again.

1067
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:45,854
If i abstain
from fun and such,

1068
00:48:45,896 --> 00:48:50,233
I'll probably
amount to much,

1069
00:48:50,275 --> 00:48:55,363
But i shall stay
the way i am,

1070
00:48:55,404 --> 00:48:58,365
Because i do not
give a damn.

1071
00:48:58,407 --> 00:49:00,367
Tim and i
a-Hunting went,

1072
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:02,286
Spied three women
in a tent.

1073
00:49:02,327 --> 00:49:03,912
They being three,
we being two,

1074
00:49:03,954 --> 00:49:07,332
I bucked one,
and tim bucked two.

1075
00:49:07,374 --> 00:49:10,084
Oh, here's
bobby's station.

1076
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:14,714
One man's descent
into hell,

1077
00:49:14,755 --> 00:49:16,590
Where we're all
waiting for you.

1078
00:49:16,632 --> 00:49:17,425
Say hello
to my father,

1079
00:49:17,466 --> 00:49:18,676
Will you, rob?

1080
00:49:19,802 --> 00:49:21,386
If i can find him.

1081
00:49:26,349 --> 00:49:28,393
This place
ought to be closed

1082
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:29,894
By law.

1083
00:49:29,936 --> 00:49:31,396
Ha ha ha!

1084
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:34,398
And thank you.

1085
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,442
That's what
i thought you'd say.

1086
00:49:36,442 --> 00:49:38,235
Rob, how do you
feel?

1087
00:49:38,235 --> 00:49:40,362
How do i feel? I...

1088
00:49:40,404 --> 00:49:44,366
I must say, i...
feel like an angel.

1089
00:49:44,366 --> 00:49:45,659
Ha ha!

1090
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,035
Some friendly
advice, benchley.

1091
00:49:47,035 --> 00:49:49,496
The best way
to avoid a hangover

1092
00:49:49,537 --> 00:49:50,663
Is to stay drunk.

1093
00:49:50,705 --> 00:49:51,497
How does a
sophisticated gentleman

1094
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:52,790
Know when he's drunk?

1095
00:49:52,832 --> 00:49:56,085
When he can't pronounce
sophisticated anymore.

1096
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:57,336
Isn't she adorable?

1097
00:49:57,378 --> 00:49:58,504
She's delirious.

1098
00:49:58,504 --> 00:50:00,422
That's why
she's adorable.

1099
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,966
Well, to get back to me,

1100
00:50:03,008 --> 00:50:04,968
I was wondering how
it could have been

1101
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:09,180
So awful
drinking with eddie

1102
00:50:09,222 --> 00:50:10,723
And so much fun

1103
00:50:10,765 --> 00:50:13,518
Drinking
with all of you.

1104
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:16,896
Is that
a loaded question?

1105
00:50:16,937 --> 00:50:18,647
Because you're
married to him.

1106
00:50:18,647 --> 00:50:19,732
Might be more fun

1107
00:50:19,773 --> 00:50:21,442
Sleeping with
somebody else, too.

1108
00:50:21,483 --> 00:50:22,484
Ahem.

1109
00:50:22,484 --> 00:50:23,819
Oh, dear, dear,

1110
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:26,655
Is the, um, subject
in danger of turning to sex?

1111
00:50:26,696 --> 00:50:27,989
no more than usual.

1112
00:50:28,031 --> 00:50:29,991
Because we wouldn't
want charlie here

1113
00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:32,327
To think that's all
we ever talk about.

1114
00:50:32,327 --> 00:50:33,661
Don't look now, toots,

1115
00:50:33,703 --> 00:50:36,163
But no matter how much
you talk about sex,

1116
00:50:36,205 --> 00:50:38,666
You never know how
the other fellow does it.

1117
00:50:38,707 --> 00:50:41,168
Why would you
want to know that?

1118
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:42,503
Well, you would know

1119
00:50:42,544 --> 00:50:44,963
If you were
an experienced woman,

1120
00:50:44,963 --> 00:50:48,758
But of course, it would be
bad manners to tell,

1121
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,343
Now, wouldn't it?

1122
00:50:55,514 --> 00:51:00,269
Cops are here.
Everybody speak easy.

1123
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:02,271
Through
the kitchen.

1124
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:14,031
This way.

1125
00:51:15,074 --> 00:51:17,076
all right, everybody.

1126
00:51:17,118 --> 00:51:18,494
Settle down.

1127
00:51:18,494 --> 00:51:20,746
We're going to take
a little ride.

1128
00:51:20,788 --> 00:51:22,789
One at a time.
Come on.

1129
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:25,333
You're coming with us
this evening.

1130
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:27,210
nice faces.

1131
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,170
Lovely hats,
too.

1132
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:31,881
Put your drink
away!

1133
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:34,717
ha ha! This is
wonderful!

1134
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:38,345
Oh, shit! I left
my purse inside.

1135
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,347
That's all right.
They'll return it...

1136
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:42,349
Federal good manners
act and all.

1137
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,351
Wait here.
I excel at this.

1138
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:46,061
What?

1139
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:54,986
Press. The american.
Mind if i take a look?

1140
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:57,488
This fella conks me
on the head,

1141
00:51:57,488 --> 00:51:59,156
And thus goes
my heart.

1142
00:51:59,198 --> 00:52:00,783
Ah, love
conks her all.

1143
00:52:00,824 --> 00:52:03,452
He's wild and mad
and fleet.

1144
00:52:03,452 --> 00:52:05,662
I may have him
mounted.

1145
00:52:05,704 --> 00:52:07,289
Yes, one would
assume.

1146
00:52:22,427 --> 00:52:23,762
Philip.

1147
00:52:26,264 --> 00:52:27,474
Here we are.

1148
00:52:27,515 --> 00:52:28,808
Taxi.

1149
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,310
i'm engaged.

1150
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:31,769
he's engaged.

1151
00:52:31,769 --> 00:52:33,896
you are? Then be happy.
Congratulations.

1152
00:52:33,938 --> 00:52:35,856
lousy new yorker.
Lousy goddamn...

1153
00:52:35,898 --> 00:52:37,942
gentlemen! Would you
strike this man?

1154
00:52:37,942 --> 00:52:40,402
want to do something
about it, pip-Squeak?

1155
00:52:40,402 --> 00:52:41,862
New york
will be deprived

1156
00:52:41,904 --> 00:52:43,989
Of its annual gilbert
and sullivan revival,

1157
00:52:44,031 --> 00:52:45,073
I think.

1158
00:52:45,073 --> 00:52:46,950
the hell with him.
Let's walk.

1159
00:52:46,992 --> 00:52:48,368
Nice meeting you,
however.

1160
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:50,828
I love the rain.

1161
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,580
My place is
closest, sister.

1162
00:52:52,622 --> 00:52:53,873
Just missed
my last train.

1163
00:52:53,915 --> 00:52:54,707
I guess
i'm coming, too.

1164
00:52:54,749 --> 00:52:56,917
I'm a late
sleeper.

1165
00:52:56,917 --> 00:52:58,711
I'll be sure
to boil my eggs gently

1166
00:52:58,711 --> 00:52:59,712
And not scrape
my toast.

1167
00:52:59,753 --> 00:53:00,921
Hello. Excuse me.

1168
00:53:00,963 --> 00:53:04,257
Hey, wait, there.
47th and 7th, please.

1169
00:53:04,299 --> 00:53:06,134
Thank you very much.

1170
00:53:11,347 --> 00:53:12,849
Thank you.

1171
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,394
hello.

1172
00:53:16,435 --> 00:53:17,853
Oh.

1173
00:53:20,356 --> 00:53:21,857
Hello.

1174
00:53:23,859 --> 00:53:26,319
Thank you
for the robe.

1175
00:53:26,361 --> 00:53:27,862
Cheers.

1176
00:53:29,948 --> 00:53:32,533
My apartment
is shamefully undeveloped

1177
00:53:32,575 --> 00:53:33,826
Compared to yours.

1178
00:53:33,868 --> 00:53:36,537
Ah, well, a friend
helped me

1179
00:53:36,579 --> 00:53:37,913
Fix up the place.

1180
00:53:37,955 --> 00:53:40,374
I should say
a few friends.

1181
00:53:42,876 --> 00:53:45,545
Oh, do you enjoy
swinburne?

1182
00:53:45,587 --> 00:53:48,840
Look...before you start
analyzing my books,

1183
00:53:48,882 --> 00:53:51,551
There's something
i should clear up.

1184
00:53:51,592 --> 00:53:53,886
You didn't pick
them out, either.

1185
00:53:55,471 --> 00:53:56,597
I lied
when i told you

1186
00:53:56,597 --> 00:53:59,892
You were one
of my favorite writers.

1187
00:54:06,606 --> 00:54:08,900
And i lied
when i smiled.

1188
00:54:11,069 --> 00:54:13,571
It's just that i've read
more about you...

1189
00:54:13,571 --> 00:54:16,240
What dorothy parker
thinks of this or that...

1190
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,908
Than your actual writing.

1191
00:54:19,618 --> 00:54:21,912
Not counting the fluff,
of course.

1192
00:54:23,247 --> 00:54:24,915
Fluff pays the rent.

1193
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:29,377
Yeah, but if i were you,
i'd be worried.

1194
00:54:29,377 --> 00:54:31,045
Oh, how dare you?

1195
00:54:31,045 --> 00:54:32,880
How dare you?

1196
00:54:35,091 --> 00:54:36,217
Come.

1197
00:54:36,258 --> 00:54:36,884
What?

1198
00:54:36,926 --> 00:54:37,718
Come here.

1199
00:54:37,718 --> 00:54:38,886
What, i'm
supposed to worry

1200
00:54:38,969 --> 00:54:41,763
Because a self-Confessed
liar and sycophant

1201
00:54:41,805 --> 00:54:43,515
Whose place
looks like it's been

1202
00:54:43,515 --> 00:54:45,225
Decorated
by the junior league

1203
00:54:45,267 --> 00:54:47,060
Tells me to?

1204
00:54:47,102 --> 00:54:49,354
That's right.

1205
00:54:49,395 --> 00:54:51,439
I'm not going
in there.

1206
00:54:51,481 --> 00:54:53,524
Why?

1207
00:54:53,566 --> 00:54:55,318
Because i've read
my share.

1208
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,027
Oh, really?

1209
00:54:57,069 --> 00:54:58,529
Yeah.

1210
00:54:58,571 --> 00:55:00,823
Well, did you know
that i sold a short story

1211
00:55:00,823 --> 00:55:03,158
That took months
to write?

1212
00:55:03,158 --> 00:55:04,576
That's, um...

1213
00:55:04,618 --> 00:55:07,454
Fiction,
for your information.

1214
00:55:07,495 --> 00:55:10,123
My low brow is not
congenital, dot.

1215
00:55:10,123 --> 00:55:11,666
I saw it.

1216
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:14,293
About a henpecked husband
living in the suburbs...

1217
00:55:14,335 --> 00:55:16,754
Seemed a lot like
benchley.

1218
00:55:27,764 --> 00:55:29,682
Now, don't be mad.

1219
00:55:29,724 --> 00:55:31,225
Dream bigger.

1220
00:55:32,935 --> 00:55:34,103
Like you?

1221
00:55:34,103 --> 00:55:36,564
Yeah, like me.

1222
00:55:36,605 --> 00:55:38,899
And you're going to
help, i suppose.

1223
00:55:38,941 --> 00:55:41,568
Sure.
Whatever you want.

1224
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:43,070
It could be...

1225
00:55:43,111 --> 00:55:44,905
One of
the very best.

1226
00:55:44,905 --> 00:55:47,866
I think you'd want
to find out.

1227
00:55:48,908 --> 00:55:51,911
This must be some sort
of sophisticated

1228
00:55:51,911 --> 00:55:55,831
Midwestern
farm-Boy routine.

1229
00:55:55,873 --> 00:55:57,374
Uh...what's my line?

1230
00:55:57,416 --> 00:55:58,626
You want to hitch up
a mule...

1231
00:55:58,667 --> 00:56:00,586
For a little person,
you talk an awful lot.

1232
00:56:00,627 --> 00:56:02,254
...and plow
my fertile fields?

1233
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:32,795
No, but i'm glad
you're by the book.

1234
00:57:36,632 --> 00:57:39,093
I felt we were
pretty good together

1235
00:57:39,134 --> 00:57:40,386
For the first time.

1236
00:57:40,386 --> 00:57:42,429
I guess adultery
takes practice.

1237
00:57:45,932 --> 00:57:48,184
Double adultery
cancels itself out.

1238
00:57:50,645 --> 00:57:52,230
Questionable logic,

1239
00:57:52,271 --> 00:57:53,940
But i like
the theory.

1240
00:57:55,941 --> 00:57:58,903
What does your wife
think about it?

1241
00:57:58,903 --> 00:58:02,322
Ah...don't worry
about her.

1242
00:58:02,364 --> 00:58:03,865
We're clean.

1243
00:58:05,283 --> 00:58:06,493
Mmm.

1244
00:58:06,535 --> 00:58:09,412
How can you wake up
so beautiful?

1245
00:58:12,415 --> 00:58:14,584
Oh, charlie.

1246
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:18,087
I'm going to wear
my heart on my sleeve

1247
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:20,923
Like a wet, red stain.

1248
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:45,403
A runaway train
colliding.

1249
00:58:45,403 --> 00:58:48,573
You knew it was dangerous
when you introduced them.

1250
00:58:48,615 --> 00:58:51,075
Cupid is judged on precision,
not perils.

1251
00:58:51,117 --> 00:58:52,577
Don't look now, toots,

1252
00:58:52,618 --> 00:58:55,579
But this is the one
she's been waiting for.

1253
00:58:55,621 --> 00:58:57,915
Oh, it's a little
something for woodrow.

1254
00:59:01,919 --> 00:59:03,879
We're engaged,
everybody.

1255
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:06,923
Dorothy's dog
and i.

1256
00:59:09,467 --> 00:59:10,802
Sit.

1257
00:59:12,637 --> 00:59:14,096
Keep it down,
everybody.

1258
00:59:15,848 --> 00:59:19,101
...the bombs exploding
all around me.

1259
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:23,021
I was overcome
with a...

1260
00:59:23,063 --> 00:59:25,107
A powerful feeling
of optimism.

1261
00:59:26,233 --> 00:59:27,359
So i said to myself,

1262
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,945
"Macarthur, this is
the lowest point in your life.

1263
00:59:30,987 --> 00:59:33,698
From here on, everything
will be an improvement."

1264
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,413
Get more.

1265
00:59:48,086 --> 00:59:49,629
Queen's bet.

1266
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:51,714
I don't know how wonderful
they are together.

1267
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:53,216
They're
an ideal couple.

1268
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:55,509
Macarthur's got a terrific
head on his shoulders.

1269
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:57,219
Yeah,
and a different one each night.

1270
00:59:57,261 --> 01:00:00,431
I remind you,
there are two sides to mistress dorothy.

1271
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:02,599
Offensive
and defensive.

1272
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,101
our founder.

1273
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:04,935
If a man
pursued her,

1274
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,436
She wouldn't
be interested.

1275
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:07,896
Let that man pursue
another woman,

1276
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,981
She'll fall deliriously
in love with him.

1277
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,274
With claws flashing
and tears falling.

1278
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,692
She's available,

1279
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,569
But she's the goddamndest
fortress at the same time.

1280
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:17,613
Yeah, a fortress
of cards.

1281
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:19,698
our founder.

1282
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:21,783
She really knows
how to suffer.

1283
01:00:21,825 --> 01:00:24,494
The greatest little
runner-Downer there ever was.

1284
01:00:24,536 --> 01:00:25,745
Dottie can't be
suffering

1285
01:00:25,745 --> 01:00:28,748
And still say all
those funny things.

1286
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:31,542
* there wasn't a soul
to greet me there *

1287
01:00:31,542 --> 01:00:33,711
* a lone stranger
on your shore *

1288
01:00:33,753 --> 01:00:36,047
* but irish luck
was with me there *

1289
01:00:36,047 --> 01:00:39,591
* and wishes came
galore *

1290
01:00:39,633 --> 01:00:41,093
Happy birthday,
dottie.

1291
01:00:41,135 --> 01:00:42,719
Happy birthday,
dot.

1292
01:00:42,761 --> 01:00:45,388
Don't you think 29's
dangerously ripe, darling?

1293
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:47,098
Nah.

1294
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:48,933
Just how i like 'em.

1295
01:00:53,646 --> 01:00:55,856
The tide's out.
The table's set.

1296
01:00:55,898 --> 01:00:58,484
Everybody
like clams?

1297
01:00:58,526 --> 01:00:59,443
Mmm.

1298
01:00:59,485 --> 01:01:00,986
Come on, marc.

1299
01:01:01,028 --> 01:01:02,237
Can't we just
whistle for them?

1300
01:01:02,279 --> 01:01:03,655
They don't have ears.

1301
01:01:03,697 --> 01:01:05,407
Grab that.

1302
01:01:07,158 --> 01:01:08,451
Dottie.

1303
01:01:10,411 --> 01:01:11,621
Oh.

1304
01:01:11,663 --> 01:01:13,122
Thank god.
Nobody saw.

1305
01:01:13,164 --> 01:01:14,916
Oh.

1306
01:01:14,957 --> 01:01:16,917
I can't even get
morning sickness

1307
01:01:16,959 --> 01:01:18,586
When you're
supposed to.

1308
01:01:18,627 --> 01:01:20,379
Are you sure?

1309
01:01:20,421 --> 01:01:21,880
Dottie.

1310
01:01:21,922 --> 01:01:24,925
Oh, neyso, i wish
the lord i weren't.

1311
01:01:33,433 --> 01:01:38,604
In april,

1312
01:01:38,604 --> 01:01:41,899
My one love came along,

1313
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:46,570
And i ran the slope
of my high hill

1314
01:01:46,611 --> 01:01:49,906
To follow
a thread of song.

1315
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:53,910
His eyes were hard
as porphyry

1316
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:57,580
With looking
on cruel lands.

1317
01:01:57,621 --> 01:02:00,958
His voice
went slipping over me

1318
01:02:00,999 --> 01:02:04,920
Like terrible silver hands.

1319
01:02:06,546 --> 01:02:10,675
In april,

1320
01:02:10,717 --> 01:02:14,595
My love went whistling by,

1321
01:02:14,637 --> 01:02:18,891
And i stumbled here
to my high hill

1322
01:02:18,933 --> 01:02:22,603
Along the way of a lie.

1323
01:02:22,644 --> 01:02:25,897
Now what should i do
in this place

1324
01:02:25,939 --> 01:02:29,609
But sit
and count the chimes,

1325
01:02:29,651 --> 01:02:33,905
And splash cold water
on my face

1326
01:02:33,946 --> 01:02:38,450
And spoil a page
with rhymes?

1327
01:02:59,678 --> 01:03:01,346
Aw. What happened?

1328
01:03:01,388 --> 01:03:02,931
Did you fall asleep?

1329
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,394
I went two hours
in the theater

1330
01:03:07,435 --> 01:03:09,896
Imagining you were
dead somewhere.

1331
01:03:09,938 --> 01:03:12,565
Oh, jesus christ, dot.
I'm sorry.

1332
01:03:12,565 --> 01:03:13,941
Ah, don't be.
It was more entertaining

1333
01:03:13,983 --> 01:03:16,402
Than the play
i was watching.

1334
01:03:16,444 --> 01:03:17,903
I'll...i'll just
get dressed.

1335
01:03:17,945 --> 01:03:20,572
I gave up on the whole
thing quite early

1336
01:03:20,614 --> 01:03:23,075
And spent most of the
evening on the floor

1337
01:03:23,075 --> 01:03:24,409
As a member of a
volunteer search party

1338
01:03:24,451 --> 01:03:25,785
To aid the lady
on my left

1339
01:03:25,827 --> 01:03:27,704
In retrieving
a missing rubber.

1340
01:03:27,746 --> 01:03:30,915
Oh, i left my lipstick
here yesterday.

1341
01:03:36,629 --> 01:03:39,590
you know, it must be
just as hard

1342
01:03:39,632 --> 01:03:41,592
To get that look right
in life

1343
01:03:41,633 --> 01:03:43,427
As it is onstage.

1344
01:03:47,639 --> 01:03:49,599
Well, someone
has to leave.

1345
01:03:49,641 --> 01:03:50,892
If you ask me,

1346
01:03:50,934 --> 01:03:52,018
It ought to be
the someone

1347
01:03:52,018 --> 01:03:55,104
Who already has
their clothes on,

1348
01:03:55,146 --> 01:03:57,106
But then...

1349
01:03:57,148 --> 01:03:59,441
You're the writers.

1350
01:04:03,153 --> 01:04:04,946
I'm just an actress.

1351
01:04:11,661 --> 01:04:13,913
Dorothy,
cut the theatrics.

1352
01:04:13,955 --> 01:04:15,956
We're both
still married.

1353
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:20,627
We're in
no position to...

1354
01:04:20,669 --> 01:04:22,629
Look, you know
my situation.

1355
01:04:22,671 --> 01:04:26,633
And you know mine
while you're up.

1356
01:04:26,633 --> 01:04:30,470
I said i'd help take care of it,
and i meant it.

1357
01:04:34,182 --> 01:04:35,766
Here's your lipstick.

1358
01:04:35,808 --> 01:04:37,935
Does the gangplank
need painting?

1359
01:04:41,105 --> 01:04:42,606
Dorothy...

1360
01:04:42,606 --> 01:04:44,566
You know i adore you,

1361
01:04:44,608 --> 01:04:47,569
But i'm not going to
make any excuses.

1362
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:49,571
Oh, no.
Goodness, no.

1363
01:04:49,571 --> 01:04:51,906
It's all my fault.
Really, it is.

1364
01:04:51,906 --> 01:04:54,575
Well, i wish
i didn't have to go,

1365
01:04:54,617 --> 01:04:56,452
And let's hope i
won't be rushing back

1366
01:04:56,494 --> 01:04:59,246
As fast as my little
legs can carry me.

1367
01:04:59,246 --> 01:05:00,205
I can't tell you

1368
01:05:00,247 --> 01:05:02,958
How much i'll...
miss you.

1369
01:05:04,292 --> 01:05:05,794
Just drive, please.

1370
01:05:15,136 --> 01:05:16,721
Where is he?

1371
01:05:16,762 --> 01:05:18,973
Did he telephone?

1372
01:05:20,474 --> 01:05:22,100
Why am i so cold?

1373
01:05:22,142 --> 01:05:23,602
It's the anesthesia.

1374
01:05:23,644 --> 01:05:25,604
We had to
give you extra.

1375
01:05:25,645 --> 01:05:26,980
You must have been
further along

1376
01:05:27,022 --> 01:05:29,691
Than you told
the doctor.

1377
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,620
Your hangover is going

1378
01:05:43,662 --> 01:05:46,289
Straight to the smithsonian,
mrs. Parker.

1379
01:05:46,331 --> 01:05:49,292
Once it kills me and becomes famous,
you mean.

1380
01:05:49,334 --> 01:05:50,793
Jesus.
Don't say that.

1381
01:05:50,835 --> 01:05:54,463
You know, there's a lesson
for all of us in this.

1382
01:05:54,505 --> 01:05:56,007
What's that,
sherry?

1383
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,927
Well,
i don't know.

1384
01:05:59,968 --> 01:06:01,970
Good night,
everyone.

1385
01:06:03,639 --> 01:06:06,224
Yes, well,
it's getting to be that time,

1386
01:06:06,266 --> 01:06:07,600
Isn't it?

1387
01:06:07,642 --> 01:06:09,144
Coming, dot?

1388
01:06:11,813 --> 01:06:13,981
Time does flit.

1389
01:06:13,981 --> 01:06:15,441
Oh, shit.

1390
01:06:17,151 --> 01:06:18,736
Good night.

1391
01:06:18,736 --> 01:06:20,404
Damn it. My watch
has stopped.

1392
01:06:20,404 --> 01:06:21,947
Oh?

1393
01:06:26,743 --> 01:06:28,953
You wound it
too tightly.

1394
01:06:31,623 --> 01:06:33,749
Perhaps it is in need
of lubrication.

1395
01:06:33,749 --> 01:06:35,418
Let's go wild
tonight!

1396
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:37,545
There's plenty of
time to do nothing

1397
01:06:37,586 --> 01:06:39,588
Once you're
dead.

1398
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:41,256
Please don't use
that word.

1399
01:06:41,298 --> 01:06:43,258
What do you say,
mr. Benchley?

1400
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,260
You want to go
wild tonight?

1401
01:06:46,595 --> 01:06:48,263
Thank you.

1402
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:49,597
Mr. Benchley.

1403
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:50,932
Mr. Benchley?

1404
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:53,392
Fred!

1405
01:06:53,434 --> 01:06:54,810
Hmm?

1406
01:06:54,852 --> 01:06:57,354
Oh, perhaps i should
see you home, mrs. P.

1407
01:06:57,396 --> 01:07:00,566
We can recite crossing
the bar along the way.

1408
01:07:00,607 --> 01:07:02,067
What do you think?

1409
01:07:02,109 --> 01:07:05,862
I can't sleep
worth sour apples.

1410
01:07:05,862 --> 01:07:09,616
I keep seeing
these little...

1411
01:07:09,657 --> 01:07:11,909
Hands and feet...

1412
01:07:11,951 --> 01:07:14,328
And a head full
of curly hair,

1413
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:16,914
Just like charlie's.

1414
01:07:16,956 --> 01:07:18,916
God is standing
over me

1415
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:22,127
In a doctor's
jacket...

1416
01:07:22,169 --> 01:07:25,714
Shaking his long,
rubber-Gloved finger.

1417
01:07:25,755 --> 01:07:28,633
That's very phallic.
Don't you think?

1418
01:07:28,633 --> 01:07:32,136
But i...I...
can't understand

1419
01:07:32,136 --> 01:07:33,721
What god is saying

1420
01:07:33,763 --> 01:07:36,974
Because he's got a
mask over his face.

1421
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:41,812
Isn't that
just like him?

1422
01:07:44,981 --> 01:07:47,942
Oh, you poor,
hungry thing.

1423
01:07:53,489 --> 01:07:54,949
All right.

1424
01:07:56,242 --> 01:07:57,910
Up we go.

1425
01:08:00,412 --> 01:08:01,914
Ooh.

1426
01:08:12,548 --> 01:08:14,592
Look, woodrow.

1427
01:08:14,634 --> 01:08:16,594
It's raining.

1428
01:08:16,635 --> 01:08:19,096
We want the rain...

1429
01:08:19,138 --> 01:08:21,098
The wanton rain.

1430
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,432
Ooh.

1431
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:27,604
Oh, you're simply all...

1432
01:08:27,646 --> 01:08:29,814
Worn-Out, aren't you?

1433
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,610
Just...

1434
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:37,279
Hungry and worn-Out.

1435
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:40,866
Well...

1436
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:43,952
We don't want
to have a breakdown.

1437
01:08:45,495 --> 01:08:47,455
Got to keep you healthy.

1438
01:08:47,497 --> 01:08:48,832
Hmm?

1439
01:08:50,208 --> 01:08:52,126
There you are.

1440
01:08:52,168 --> 01:08:53,961
Mmm.

1441
01:08:59,717 --> 01:09:00,968
There you go, darling.

1442
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,305
A nice dinner for you.

1443
01:09:18,943 --> 01:09:21,612
Oh, hello, johnny.
It's mrs. Parker.

1444
01:09:21,653 --> 01:09:24,614
Yes, i'll be needing you
to deliver up some dinner

1445
01:09:24,656 --> 01:09:26,449
Before theater
tonight, dear.

1446
01:09:27,951 --> 01:09:29,953
Oh, whatever's
the special...

1447
01:09:29,953 --> 01:09:32,121
And a large pot
of coffee.

1448
01:09:32,163 --> 01:09:33,831
Thank you.

1449
01:09:39,128 --> 01:09:41,380
Oh.

1450
01:09:41,421 --> 01:09:42,923
All right.

1451
01:09:59,938 --> 01:10:02,941
Tragedies don't
kill us, woodrow.

1452
01:10:04,359 --> 01:10:05,861
Messes kill us.

1453
01:10:05,861 --> 01:10:08,947
I can't stand
messes.

1454
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:13,201
Oh, where's
the fucking aspirin?

1455
01:10:59,326 --> 01:11:01,620
The sun's gone dim,

1456
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:05,123
And the moon's turned
black,

1457
01:11:05,123 --> 01:11:08,918
For i loved him,
and he didn't love back.

1458
01:11:18,093 --> 01:11:20,763
you were a mess
lying there...

1459
01:11:23,307 --> 01:11:24,391
Bleeding
and drooling.

1460
01:11:28,603 --> 01:11:31,272
You were pathetic...

1461
01:11:31,314 --> 01:11:32,398
And disgusting.

1462
01:11:34,609 --> 01:11:36,569
Is that all?

1463
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:38,404
I only know
15 adjectives.

1464
01:11:41,824 --> 01:11:45,577
You don't have to tie double knots,
mr. Benchley.

1465
01:11:45,619 --> 01:11:48,413
These are not
your son's oxfords.

1466
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:56,420
Do you still
love me, fred?

1467
01:11:56,462 --> 01:11:58,631
Of course i do,
mrs. Parker.

1468
01:11:58,672 --> 01:12:01,300
But you think
i'm a kill-Joy.

1469
01:12:04,302 --> 01:12:06,012
No, i don't,

1470
01:12:06,054 --> 01:12:08,723
But if you don't eat
more solid foods

1471
01:12:08,765 --> 01:12:09,974
And stay away
from razor blades,

1472
01:12:09,974 --> 01:12:12,143
You could arouse
that suspicion in others.

1473
01:12:14,645 --> 01:12:15,730
I hear mice.

1474
01:12:15,771 --> 01:12:17,439
Shall i
discourage them?

1475
01:12:19,608 --> 01:12:21,443
Do i look...
all right?

1476
01:12:25,614 --> 01:12:27,490
Now you do.

1477
01:12:27,532 --> 01:12:28,950
Come in.

1478
01:12:43,463 --> 01:12:44,589
well...

1479
01:12:44,631 --> 01:12:47,092
Aside from f.P.A.,
Who withers easily,

1480
01:12:47,133 --> 01:12:49,594
It seems as though
all your friends

1481
01:12:49,636 --> 01:12:51,137
Are here,
mrs. Parker.

1482
01:12:52,638 --> 01:12:54,599
Yes...

1483
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,434
And paula, too.

1484
01:13:00,813 --> 01:13:02,773
It must be rough now
that benchley and charlie

1485
01:13:02,814 --> 01:13:05,567
Are such good
friends, huh?

1486
01:13:05,609 --> 01:13:07,444
It's not so bad.

1487
01:13:07,485 --> 01:13:09,779
I just let him
ignore me.

1488
01:13:12,615 --> 01:13:14,242
You know,
people still think

1489
01:13:14,283 --> 01:13:16,744
He's banging me
every night,

1490
01:13:16,786 --> 01:13:19,288
And sometimes i wish
to god he were.

1491
01:13:20,789 --> 01:13:22,791
But only sometimes.

1492
01:13:24,668 --> 01:13:27,671
You know, he sent me
$30 for the operation.

1493
01:13:29,464 --> 01:13:31,466
Judas making a refund.

1494
01:13:56,364 --> 01:13:59,783
Oh, for christ's sake.

1495
01:14:07,624 --> 01:14:09,292
there you are.

1496
01:14:09,334 --> 01:14:11,294
Fred, how long
do you think

1497
01:14:11,336 --> 01:14:12,503
We can keep
this thing up?

1498
01:14:12,545 --> 01:14:13,588
Keep what up?

1499
01:14:13,588 --> 01:14:15,047
You performing
six nights a week

1500
01:14:15,089 --> 01:14:17,341
And me covering
first acts.

1501
01:14:17,383 --> 01:14:18,759
We need the money,
mrs. Parker.

1502
01:14:18,801 --> 01:14:22,429
You only need enough money
to keep body and soul apart.

1503
01:14:22,471 --> 01:14:26,057
Shh. Remember,
mrs. Parker,

1504
01:14:26,057 --> 01:14:28,268
Speak easy.

1505
01:14:28,309 --> 01:14:29,769
Open up.

1506
01:14:29,811 --> 01:14:31,771
This is a raid.

1507
01:14:36,108 --> 01:14:38,277
Oh, god.

1508
01:14:41,488 --> 01:14:42,739
Please, mrs. Parker.

1509
01:14:42,781 --> 01:14:44,783
You're running
a fever, fred.

1510
01:14:44,825 --> 01:14:46,660
People will think i
beat you in private.

1511
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:47,911
You're running it
ragged.

1512
01:14:47,952 --> 01:14:49,621
Probably how i managed
to get so much done

1513
01:14:49,662 --> 01:14:51,497
And still look
so dissipated.

1514
01:14:51,497 --> 01:14:53,332
I'll bet you haven't
eaten a thing all day.

1515
01:14:53,332 --> 01:14:55,876
Au contraire.
I found a little french place,

1516
01:14:55,918 --> 01:14:57,086
Completely
without charm.

1517
01:14:57,128 --> 01:14:59,505
One brown and one clear,
please.

1518
01:14:59,505 --> 01:15:04,801
Oh, for crying
out loud, fred.

1519
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:06,303
The last thing
you need is that.

1520
01:15:06,303 --> 01:15:07,304
what?

1521
01:15:07,304 --> 01:15:08,471
What? What about
your family?

1522
01:15:08,471 --> 01:15:09,639
Who?

1523
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:10,682
I forbid you.

1524
01:15:10,723 --> 01:15:11,974
May i remind you,
mrs. P.,

1525
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:15,770
That i'm not a fictional
creation of hers.

1526
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:19,023
What could you possibly say
to a thing like that?

1527
01:15:19,064 --> 01:15:21,275
"Did you go to the circus
this year?"

1528
01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:22,776
Oh, no, no. Better.

1529
01:15:22,776 --> 01:15:24,236
"When do your tonsils
come out?"

1530
01:15:24,277 --> 01:15:26,529
How about
"your regal presence at the bar

1531
01:15:26,571 --> 01:15:29,282
Has inspired my soul
to an upheaval"?

1532
01:15:29,282 --> 01:15:31,117
Hmm?
That's the source of all great literature...

1533
01:15:31,117 --> 01:15:33,119
An upheaved soul.

1534
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:39,249
I, uh...have
a question to ask.

1535
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:41,001
Mm-Hmm.

1536
01:15:41,043 --> 01:15:42,794
A serious one.

1537
01:15:47,299 --> 01:15:48,800
Anything.

1538
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:54,972
Why do you think...

1539
01:15:55,014 --> 01:15:57,266
That we...

1540
01:15:57,308 --> 01:15:58,976
Yes?

1541
01:15:59,018 --> 01:16:00,561
You and i...

1542
01:16:00,561 --> 01:16:02,813
That would be "we,"
yeah.

1543
01:16:04,231 --> 01:16:06,483
Have never
misbehaved?

1544
01:16:10,987 --> 01:16:13,197
I'm referring
to what we don't do

1545
01:16:13,239 --> 01:16:15,366
In spite of everything.

1546
01:16:15,366 --> 01:16:17,827
What we don't do,
hmm.

1547
01:16:22,497 --> 01:16:24,291
Mrs. Parker, really.

1548
01:16:27,294 --> 01:16:29,254
Tell me.

1549
01:16:29,295 --> 01:16:30,797
Now.

1550
01:16:33,299 --> 01:16:34,967
Well...ahem.

1551
01:16:34,967 --> 01:16:37,470
I suppose we respect
each other too much.

1552
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:39,972
Ah. We don't respect
anyone.

1553
01:16:39,972 --> 01:16:42,307
Well, mrs. Parker,
suppose it didn't work.

1554
01:16:43,809 --> 01:16:45,310
Suppose it did.

1555
01:16:49,397 --> 01:16:50,690
No. No, no.

1556
01:16:50,732 --> 01:16:51,607
It's a lot easier
to take disappointment

1557
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:52,608
When you're young

1558
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,277
Or dumb or don't
expect much,

1559
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:56,862
But we're old
and smart.

1560
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:58,948
Don't bat those
ingenue eyes at me.

1561
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:01,283
You know what
i'm talking about.

1562
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,492
That's the trouble.
You know entirely too much.

1563
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:05,162
Oh, gee,
and i was thinking

1564
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:06,997
I must not
know enough,

1565
01:17:07,038 --> 01:17:08,748
Because the things
i want most

1566
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,917
I can't seem to get.

1567
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:13,794
That's because you've
forgotten how to have fun.

1568
01:17:15,713 --> 01:17:17,923
Oh, really?

1569
01:17:17,923 --> 01:17:19,300
Fun?

1570
01:17:21,927 --> 01:17:24,805
I'll show you
some fun.

1571
01:17:25,889 --> 01:17:26,556
What are you doing?

1572
01:17:26,598 --> 01:17:27,891
Yes, you.

1573
01:17:27,891 --> 01:17:29,392
What are you doing?

1574
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,481
You looked in need
of rescue, dear.

1575
01:17:35,523 --> 01:17:36,982
What's your name?

1576
01:17:37,024 --> 01:17:38,150
Joanie.

1577
01:17:38,192 --> 01:17:39,652
Sit down, joanie.

1578
01:17:39,693 --> 01:17:41,320
Joanie gerard.

1579
01:17:41,361 --> 01:17:42,988
How do you do?
I'm robert.

1580
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:45,490
Are you an actress,
joanie gerard?

1581
01:17:45,532 --> 01:17:47,492
I'm a western
union girl.

1582
01:17:47,534 --> 01:17:48,993
Yeah. Oh.

1583
01:17:49,035 --> 01:17:51,496
But i want to be
an actress.

1584
01:17:51,537 --> 01:17:54,207
Oh, you dear,
brave soul.

1585
01:17:54,207 --> 01:17:55,708
You're in luck.

1586
01:17:55,708 --> 01:17:57,960
Freddy is a talent scout,
aren't you, fred?

1587
01:17:58,002 --> 01:17:59,461
Really?

1588
01:17:59,503 --> 01:18:01,463
Oh, well,
after a fashion.

1589
01:18:01,463 --> 01:18:03,799
And this is
mrs. Parker,

1590
01:18:03,799 --> 01:18:06,092
My good friend
and favorite living writer.

1591
01:18:06,134 --> 01:18:07,469
But not much fun.

1592
01:18:07,469 --> 01:18:09,471
You're a real,
living writer?

1593
01:18:09,471 --> 01:18:11,139
Currently on leave.

1594
01:18:12,557 --> 01:18:13,766
Jeez,
i feel like

1595
01:18:13,808 --> 01:18:17,353
I ought to drop a
curtsy or something.

1596
01:18:17,394 --> 01:18:20,272
Her curtsy, your pants,
my teeth.

1597
01:18:20,272 --> 01:18:22,274
Ha ha!
All right.

1598
01:18:22,316 --> 01:18:24,276
So...
what do you say?

1599
01:18:24,276 --> 01:18:25,610
Shall we go wild
tonight?

1600
01:18:25,652 --> 01:18:27,612
Yeah, fred.
What do you say?

1601
01:18:27,612 --> 01:18:29,447
You want
to go wild?

1602
01:18:29,489 --> 01:18:30,907
I could outline
several opera plots

1603
01:18:30,949 --> 01:18:32,909
I've been working on.

1604
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:33,910
Oh!

1605
01:18:33,951 --> 01:18:36,162
Oh,
forget him, dear.

1606
01:18:36,203 --> 01:18:37,955
I've just been released

1607
01:18:37,997 --> 01:18:40,165
From our lady
of malpractice,

1608
01:18:40,207 --> 01:18:42,459
And i want
to go wild.

1609
01:18:42,501 --> 01:18:45,128
How do i learn how?

1610
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:47,088
Aah!
Aah!

1611
01:18:56,347 --> 01:18:58,474
Uh! Uh!

1612
01:18:58,515 --> 01:19:01,226
Oh! Oh!

1613
01:19:02,311 --> 01:19:04,146
Uh! Uh!

1614
01:19:04,187 --> 01:19:06,314
artists...that's why
we invite them.

1615
01:19:08,108 --> 01:19:09,275
Ha ha!

1616
01:19:09,317 --> 01:19:10,902
Bravo, george.

1617
01:19:10,944 --> 01:19:11,986
Bravo!

1618
01:19:12,028 --> 01:19:14,238
mind us, you cretins!

1619
01:19:15,197 --> 01:19:17,491
Well played!

1620
01:19:17,533 --> 01:19:18,993
That wasn't
very sporting.

1621
01:19:19,034 --> 01:19:20,494
Well...

1622
01:19:20,536 --> 01:19:22,496
Do we have a game?

1623
01:19:22,537 --> 01:19:23,997
I'll sing an opera.

1624
01:19:24,039 --> 01:19:25,999
You gentlemen see
if you can name it.

1625
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:27,500
All right.

1626
01:19:27,542 --> 01:19:29,043
Here we go.

1627
01:19:36,509 --> 01:19:39,470
I would say that is,
uh...joe green.

1628
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:41,096
Yes. It's definitely
joe green.

1629
01:19:41,138 --> 01:19:43,223
Giuseppe verdi.

1630
01:19:43,265 --> 01:19:44,641
Don't look now, toots,

1631
01:19:44,683 --> 01:19:46,768
But unmarried yale barristers
have been spotted

1632
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:49,479
Cavorting
on the south lawn.

1633
01:19:49,479 --> 01:19:52,940
Oh, a girl can
get splinters

1634
01:19:52,982 --> 01:19:55,526
Sliding down
a barrister.

1635
01:19:55,568 --> 01:19:57,111
What else?

1636
01:19:57,111 --> 01:19:59,780
What about our athletic friend
down there?

1637
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:02,282
He's built like a horse.

1638
01:20:02,324 --> 01:20:04,659
Always
so optimistic.

1639
01:20:04,701 --> 01:20:07,454
Well,
he keeps waving his mallet in my direction.

1640
01:20:07,495 --> 01:20:09,289
It must
mean something.

1641
01:20:09,289 --> 01:20:10,957
What are you doing?

1642
01:20:10,999 --> 01:20:12,959
This isn't polo,
you cretin.

1643
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,086
Descend from your perch,
my little mourning dove,

1644
01:20:15,127 --> 01:20:18,422
And show this neomalthusian
how it's done.

1645
01:20:19,923 --> 01:20:22,676
Mind if
i join you?

1646
01:20:22,718 --> 01:20:26,263
You must be picking
wallflowers, scott.

1647
01:20:26,304 --> 01:20:27,806
Well, sherry,
i read your latest short story...

1648
01:20:27,847 --> 01:20:29,182
"Extra, extra."

1649
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:32,435
It was as fine a bit of
writing i've ever read...

1650
01:20:32,477 --> 01:20:36,480
Short, lean,
acid, so good.

1651
01:20:36,522 --> 01:20:39,066
This is a magazine
of the city.

1652
01:20:39,108 --> 01:20:40,109
A smart magazine.

1653
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:43,445
And not for the little
old lady in dubuque.

1654
01:20:43,487 --> 01:20:44,488
You have a title?

1655
01:20:44,529 --> 01:20:46,948
* ba ba ba ba-Da

1656
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:49,200
* ba ba ba ba-Da
ba ba-Da ba ba-Da *

1657
01:20:49,242 --> 01:20:49,951
What's in a name?

1658
01:20:49,993 --> 01:20:52,370
A name is simply
a name.

1659
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:54,497
It's who you know,
darling.

1660
01:20:54,538 --> 01:20:55,623
It's who you know.

1661
01:20:55,665 --> 01:20:56,874
Most
of our friends

1662
01:20:56,874 --> 01:20:58,209
Will be
contributing.

1663
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,835
Dorothy parker,
for one.

1664
01:20:59,877 --> 01:21:00,669
George kaufman.

1665
01:21:00,711 --> 01:21:01,420
F.P.A.

1666
01:21:01,462 --> 01:21:02,546
Bob benchley.

1667
01:21:02,588 --> 01:21:07,008
They're all devoted
to the idea.

1668
01:21:07,008 --> 01:21:08,802
So, we're...

1669
01:21:08,843 --> 01:21:09,761
George, come here!

1670
01:21:09,802 --> 01:21:12,346
Is he through
that wicket?

1671
01:21:12,346 --> 01:21:14,015
Wicket's
crooked, marc.

1672
01:21:14,056 --> 01:21:15,016
Ha!

1673
01:21:15,016 --> 01:21:16,308
You cheat.

1674
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:17,560
Whose ball
is this?

1675
01:21:17,601 --> 01:21:18,435
That's edna's.

1676
01:21:18,435 --> 01:21:21,313
Oh,
for god's sake!

1677
01:21:21,355 --> 01:21:23,440
What do you
want to do, huh?

1678
01:21:23,482 --> 01:21:25,400
I've always wanted
to write a novel

1679
01:21:25,442 --> 01:21:26,109
Or a play.

1680
01:21:26,151 --> 01:21:27,152
How old are you?

1681
01:21:27,193 --> 01:21:28,862
28

1682
01:21:28,903 --> 01:21:30,196
Don't let
the time pass.

1683
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:32,657
If you want to write something,
you write it.

1684
01:21:32,698 --> 01:21:35,576
Don't turn 40
wishing you had.

1685
01:21:35,618 --> 01:21:37,453
Aah!

1686
01:21:37,495 --> 01:21:38,871
Why is harpo
the only one of us

1687
01:21:38,912 --> 01:21:42,332
Who enjoys performing
like a seal?

1688
01:21:42,374 --> 01:21:44,501
Please
don't answer that.

1689
01:21:44,543 --> 01:21:45,585
It's a magazine
for a man

1690
01:21:45,627 --> 01:21:48,004
Who knows his way
around the city.

1691
01:21:48,046 --> 01:21:50,632
Yes. A man
not unlike myself.

1692
01:21:50,673 --> 01:21:52,175
What's this magazine
about, ross...

1693
01:21:52,216 --> 01:21:54,427
Shipping news?

1694
01:21:54,427 --> 01:21:56,345
It's a magazine
about new york

1695
01:21:56,387 --> 01:21:57,138
For people
with manners.

1696
01:21:57,179 --> 01:21:57,972
Yeah.
M-Manners.

1697
01:21:58,013 --> 01:22:02,476
Well, if it's
about new york,

1698
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:04,770
Why not call it
the new yorker?

1699
01:22:04,811 --> 01:22:06,438
Now, that's
brilliant.

1700
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:11,109
Hello.

1701
01:22:11,150 --> 01:22:13,486
I hope you like
to gamble, dorothy,

1702
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:14,904
Because i
just made a bet

1703
01:22:14,904 --> 01:22:17,490
That i can
make you smile.

1704
01:22:17,531 --> 01:22:20,492
Oh, i hate to see
anyone lose money.

1705
01:22:20,534 --> 01:22:22,494
It's so hard
to find.

1706
01:22:22,536 --> 01:22:23,745
Don't go away.

1707
01:22:23,787 --> 01:22:27,374
I must eat something
before i pass out.

1708
01:22:30,627 --> 01:22:32,628
Attention,
everyone.

1709
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:34,338
Maybe dorothy
would consent

1710
01:22:34,338 --> 01:22:38,676
To recite one of her
little things for us.

1711
01:22:38,717 --> 01:22:41,929
Well, maybe i'll just
digest my little supper

1712
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:43,847
And sing for it later.

1713
01:22:43,889 --> 01:22:45,015
Oh, please,
dorothy.

1714
01:22:45,056 --> 01:22:48,518
Something bilious
for dessert.

1715
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:49,853
No. Something bubbly,
mrs. Parker.

1716
01:22:49,853 --> 01:22:51,604
Something
bubbly bilious.

1717
01:22:51,646 --> 01:22:53,272
Double bubbly,
but don't bill us.

1718
01:22:53,314 --> 01:22:53,814
Ha ha ha ha!

1719
01:22:53,814 --> 01:22:54,815
One more drink,

1720
01:22:54,815 --> 01:22:56,484
And i'll be
under the host.

1721
01:22:56,525 --> 01:22:58,277
Oh, please,
mrs. Parker.

1722
01:22:58,277 --> 01:22:59,653
Do honor us

1723
01:22:59,695 --> 01:23:01,989
With one of your
darling little poems.

1724
01:23:04,157 --> 01:23:06,326
Resume.

1725
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,620
Razors pain you.

1726
01:23:08,661 --> 01:23:11,331
Rivers are damp.

1727
01:23:11,372 --> 01:23:13,416
Acids stain you,

1728
01:23:13,416 --> 01:23:15,626
And drugs cause cramp.

1729
01:23:15,668 --> 01:23:18,087
Guns aren't lawful.

1730
01:23:18,128 --> 01:23:20,255
Nooses give.

1731
01:23:20,255 --> 01:23:24,259
Gas smells awful.

1732
01:23:24,301 --> 01:23:25,760
You might as well live.

1733
01:23:32,558 --> 01:23:33,893
Another
cheerful poem.

1734
01:23:33,893 --> 01:23:38,606
Bravo!

1735
01:23:40,566 --> 01:23:42,025
What
a fascinating woman.

1736
01:23:42,067 --> 01:23:44,069
Nice going.

1737
01:23:50,074 --> 01:23:51,367
Dorothy!

1738
01:23:58,916 --> 01:24:02,002
So,
is it true that you live in a rathole?

1739
01:24:02,044 --> 01:24:03,712
Oh, i like
my apartment.

1740
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:06,339
It's just big enough
to lay my hat

1741
01:24:06,381 --> 01:24:08,758
And a few friends.

1742
01:24:10,218 --> 01:24:13,262
Did you know my family's
in bird sanctuaries?

1743
01:24:13,304 --> 01:24:14,680
It's true.

1744
01:24:14,722 --> 01:24:16,182
Rather interesting.

1745
01:24:16,223 --> 01:24:19,518
Let's say i buy
a peacock for $5.00,

1746
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,186
Throw it up
in a tree,

1747
01:24:21,228 --> 01:24:24,981
And then charge, oh,
any tom, dick, and harry

1748
01:24:24,981 --> 01:24:26,233
$2.00 apiece
just to...

1749
01:25:11,065 --> 01:25:14,694
Oh, don't worry,
uh...roger.

1750
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:16,695
I don't review
rehearsals.

1751
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:20,699
Oh, god.

1752
01:26:26,218 --> 01:26:29,721
Her mind lives
in a quiet room,

1753
01:26:29,762 --> 01:26:33,182
A narrow room,
and tall,

1754
01:26:33,224 --> 01:26:37,686
With pretty lamps
to quench the gloom

1755
01:26:37,728 --> 01:26:40,856
And mottoes on the wall.

1756
01:26:40,898 --> 01:26:44,693
There all the things
are wax and neat

1757
01:26:44,734 --> 01:26:48,029
And set
in decorous lines,

1758
01:26:48,071 --> 01:26:53,701
And there are posies,
round and sweet,

1759
01:26:53,743 --> 01:26:57,621
And little,
straightened vines.

1760
01:26:57,663 --> 01:27:01,542
Her mind lives tidily,
apart from cold

1761
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:03,627
And noise

1762
01:27:03,669 --> 01:27:06,213
And pain,

1763
01:27:06,254 --> 01:27:10,800
And bolts the door
against her heart,

1764
01:27:10,842 --> 01:27:13,678
Out wailing
in the rain.

1765
01:27:15,054 --> 01:27:17,681
I think i was born
to live in a hotel.

1766
01:27:17,723 --> 01:27:18,933
It helps me concentrate

1767
01:27:18,974 --> 01:27:20,392
Knowing i can
just sign for things

1768
01:27:20,434 --> 01:27:21,894
Whenever i need them.

1769
01:27:21,935 --> 01:27:23,395
Yes, it's wonderful.

1770
01:27:23,437 --> 01:27:26,356
But, of course,
the bill always comes through

1771
01:27:26,398 --> 01:27:27,816
At the end
of the month.

1772
01:27:27,816 --> 01:27:30,526
I trust that won't
be a problem.

1773
01:27:30,568 --> 01:27:32,361
Scout's honor.

1774
01:27:32,403 --> 01:27:36,532
Well,
i think this hotel's always been very lucky

1775
01:27:36,574 --> 01:27:37,199
For writers,
mrs. Parker.

1776
01:27:37,241 --> 01:27:38,909
For example,

1777
01:27:38,951 --> 01:27:42,454
Do you have any idea how
many important plays

1778
01:27:42,454 --> 01:27:43,705
Have been
written here?

1779
01:27:43,747 --> 01:27:45,707
Well, well.
How fortunate.

1780
01:27:45,749 --> 01:27:47,709
I'm working
on a play.

1781
01:27:47,751 --> 01:27:49,294
And if you're right,

1782
01:27:49,335 --> 01:27:50,336
We won't
have to worry

1783
01:27:50,378 --> 01:27:53,131
About the rent,
now, will we?

1784
01:27:53,172 --> 01:27:55,716
I wouldn't go away
from you for anything!

1785
01:27:55,758 --> 01:27:56,926
There's nothing
in the world...

1786
01:27:56,967 --> 01:27:59,178
No, no. Stop, please.
You mustn't move.

1787
01:27:59,219 --> 01:28:01,555
Stop! Stop!

1788
01:28:01,597 --> 01:28:02,639
You mustn't move
on his speech!

1789
01:28:02,681 --> 01:28:04,391
Oh, my! I can't
work like this!

1790
01:28:04,391 --> 01:28:05,684
Dorothy,
don't you think

1791
01:28:05,725 --> 01:28:07,018
She ought to be
wearing a brassiere?

1792
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:08,395
Oh, god, no.

1793
01:28:08,395 --> 01:28:11,939
We've got to have something
in this show that moves.

1794
01:28:17,069 --> 01:28:18,529
Good afternoon,
mr. Benchley.

1795
01:28:18,529 --> 01:28:19,697
Hello.

1796
01:28:19,697 --> 01:28:20,948
Loved the play.

1797
01:28:20,989 --> 01:28:23,700
Let's hope it's a big
financial success!

1798
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:26,870
I owe him three
months on the rent.

1799
01:28:26,911 --> 01:28:29,205
Well, at least you got
fantastic reviews.

1800
01:28:29,205 --> 01:28:32,041
Yes. And some were even
from total strangers.

1801
01:28:32,083 --> 01:28:35,378
Ha ha ha!

1802
01:28:35,419 --> 01:28:37,379
Oh, i suppose
it was dull,

1803
01:28:37,421 --> 01:28:40,174
And you all have
my apologies.

1804
01:28:40,215 --> 01:28:42,676
But how can you know
about your own?

1805
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:44,177
You can't.

1806
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:46,680
I want to know
who decided to open it

1807
01:28:46,721 --> 01:28:47,847
Two days
before christmas.

1808
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:49,974
I hear
your mr. Benchley

1809
01:28:50,016 --> 01:28:53,019
Has taken up residence
at polly adler's brothel.

1810
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:54,312
Well, that is,
of course,

1811
01:28:54,353 --> 01:28:56,981
When he's not
with that little show girl.

1812
01:28:56,981 --> 01:28:58,983
Maybe it wouldn't hurt
to work that in.

1813
01:28:58,983 --> 01:29:01,652
The play's about benchley
anyway, isn't it, dot?

1814
01:29:01,652 --> 01:29:03,487
Look on the bright side,
dorothy.

1815
01:29:03,487 --> 01:29:04,654
Bobby.

1816
01:29:04,654 --> 01:29:05,864
Hello, broun.

1817
01:29:05,906 --> 01:29:06,906
My place has
got your name

1818
01:29:06,948 --> 01:29:08,283
Written
all over it.

1819
01:29:08,324 --> 01:29:11,536
Thank you, don.
Thank you.

1820
01:29:11,577 --> 01:29:13,371
Miss hunt,
how do you do?

1821
01:29:13,412 --> 01:29:15,414
Miss ferber.

1822
01:29:20,252 --> 01:29:21,628
Well, when they laughed
at the mandolin duet,

1823
01:29:21,670 --> 01:29:24,131
I wanted to bash
their skulls in.

1824
01:29:24,131 --> 01:29:26,716
Could have used
a french horn.

1825
01:29:26,758 --> 01:29:28,760
I think it's more
of a magnificent tragedy

1826
01:29:28,802 --> 01:29:30,803
Than it is a comedy.

1827
01:29:30,845 --> 01:29:33,181
It's a wonderful play,
and that's final.

1828
01:29:33,222 --> 01:29:35,266
I'm afraid so.

1829
01:29:35,308 --> 01:29:38,435
We did a cool $90 at
yesterday's matinee.

1830
01:29:38,435 --> 01:29:39,436
Philip's closing it
next week.

1831
01:29:39,478 --> 01:29:40,813
What?

1832
01:29:40,854 --> 01:29:43,106
Mr. Woollcott,
we really have to clear the room

1833
01:29:43,148 --> 01:29:44,816
To prepare for
the dinner service.

1834
01:29:44,858 --> 01:29:46,234
Clear the room?

1835
01:29:46,234 --> 01:29:47,235
Obviously
has no taste.

1836
01:29:47,277 --> 01:29:48,194
You imbecile!

1837
01:29:48,236 --> 01:29:50,196
Do i look like
a piece of furniture?

1838
01:29:50,196 --> 01:29:52,698
Well, actually,
an entire showroom.

1839
01:29:52,698 --> 01:29:54,200
On a good day.

1840
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:57,328
Ha! Let's go up
to my room, everybody.

1841
01:29:57,369 --> 01:29:58,787
You coming, fred?

1842
01:29:58,829 --> 01:30:01,874
I think i'll catch up
with you later.

1843
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,877
At polly's?

1844
01:30:05,919 --> 01:30:08,546
Why don't we say
at tony's, mrs. Parker?

1845
01:30:08,588 --> 01:30:10,590
Thank you, sir.

1846
01:30:10,632 --> 01:30:12,008
Please,
mr. Benchley.

1847
01:30:12,008 --> 01:30:14,010
I've never been
to a whorehouse.

1848
01:30:14,051 --> 01:30:15,344
Mrs. Parker...

1849
01:30:15,344 --> 01:30:17,179
It's not
unlike the theater

1850
01:30:17,221 --> 01:30:18,639
In many ways.

1851
01:30:18,681 --> 01:30:20,182
Satisfied?

1852
01:30:21,517 --> 01:30:24,186
No. Ha ha!

1853
01:30:24,227 --> 01:30:25,854
Never,
i suppose.

1854
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:38,032
"For polly.
Long may she wave.

1855
01:30:38,073 --> 01:30:40,159
Al tennyson."

1856
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,660
Yeah,
mr. Benchley.

1857
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:42,995
Oh,
that's very good.

1858
01:30:42,995 --> 01:30:46,539
I prefer
a real whorehouse

1859
01:30:46,581 --> 01:30:48,166
To the theater.

1860
01:30:48,208 --> 01:30:49,334
Oh, yes.

1861
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:50,960
If a girl
can't sing here,

1862
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:51,836
She has the good
manners to fake it.

1863
01:30:51,878 --> 01:30:52,962
What's
the going rate?

1864
01:30:53,004 --> 01:30:55,298
I like the looks
of that one there.

1865
01:30:55,298 --> 01:30:56,298
she's a guest.

1866
01:30:56,298 --> 01:30:57,508
Well, so am i.

1867
01:30:57,550 --> 01:30:58,801
Oh, bobby,

1868
01:30:58,842 --> 01:31:00,135
Are you going to read
to me again tonight?

1869
01:31:00,135 --> 01:31:02,763
Oh, another county
heard from.

1870
01:31:02,763 --> 01:31:06,182
Um, i'd like you
to meet my good friend,

1871
01:31:06,224 --> 01:31:07,767
Mrs...
mrs. Parker.

1872
01:31:08,393 --> 01:31:09,310
Mrs. Parker...

1873
01:31:09,352 --> 01:31:10,311
is she all right?

1874
01:31:10,353 --> 01:31:12,522
I think she
should lie down.

1875
01:31:12,563 --> 01:31:13,856
Here we are.

1876
01:31:13,898 --> 01:31:16,233
Yes, i think
i hit my...ass.

1877
01:31:16,275 --> 01:31:18,694
take her to
the lavender room, coco.

1878
01:31:18,694 --> 01:31:20,195
yes, miss adler.

1879
01:31:20,195 --> 01:31:21,905
Oh...
i'm so sorry.

1880
01:31:21,947 --> 01:31:22,864
it's right this way.

1881
01:31:22,906 --> 01:31:24,282
i'll go up with her.

1882
01:31:24,324 --> 01:31:28,119
I had medical training
in the army, you know.

1883
01:31:30,538 --> 01:31:33,708
Suspicions
confirmed, fred.

1884
01:31:33,708 --> 01:31:37,044
I am
a drunken whore.

1885
01:31:37,044 --> 01:31:39,004
You're an artist,
mrs. Parker.

1886
01:31:39,004 --> 01:31:41,507
Sometimes artists
lose their balance.

1887
01:31:41,507 --> 01:31:43,175
Ah...

1888
01:31:43,216 --> 01:31:46,177
I'm little dorothy with the
curse of the rothschilds

1889
01:31:46,219 --> 01:31:48,012
Hanging
over her head.

1890
01:31:48,012 --> 01:31:50,181
You're the artist,
mr. Benchley.

1891
01:31:50,223 --> 01:31:51,224
No, no. Not me.

1892
01:31:51,265 --> 01:31:52,183
Don't lay that
on me.

1893
01:31:52,225 --> 01:31:54,352
I've discovered
i have no real talent

1894
01:31:54,352 --> 01:31:55,978
For writing.

1895
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:59,481
I can't quit
because i'm too famous.

1896
01:31:59,523 --> 01:32:01,066
All right?

1897
01:32:02,567 --> 01:32:04,653
Here we are.

1898
01:32:04,653 --> 01:32:07,530
You lean down here.

1899
01:32:07,572 --> 01:32:09,741
I want to check
your temperature.

1900
01:32:44,523 --> 01:32:47,692
You need some rest,
mrs. Parker.

1901
01:32:47,734 --> 01:32:49,235
Mr. Benchley...

1902
01:32:51,571 --> 01:32:53,489
Yes, mrs. Parker.

1903
01:32:53,531 --> 01:32:55,741
Oh! Ha ha!

1904
01:33:10,213 --> 01:33:11,506
Oh...

1905
01:33:11,506 --> 01:33:13,007
Christ.

1906
01:33:15,217 --> 01:33:17,011
Oh...

1907
01:33:18,887 --> 01:33:22,015
goddamn it,
thurber.

1908
01:33:22,057 --> 01:33:22,891
Is ross in?

1909
01:33:22,933 --> 01:33:24,393
Yes, but he's
engaged right now.

1910
01:33:24,434 --> 01:33:25,435
You'll have to
take a seat.

1911
01:33:25,477 --> 01:33:26,478
Excuse me, miss!

1912
01:33:26,519 --> 01:33:27,562
Do it over again!

1913
01:33:27,604 --> 01:33:28,980
Thurber's crazy.
You talk to him.

1914
01:33:29,022 --> 01:33:30,982
Finally!
I've been wondering what happened to you.

1915
01:33:31,024 --> 01:33:32,316
Do you have
the article?

1916
01:33:32,358 --> 01:33:33,818
This was due
on the third.

1917
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:36,987
Somebody was using
the pencil.

1918
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:37,988
You look terrible,
dottie.

1919
01:33:37,988 --> 01:33:40,324
Have you not
been sleeping?

1920
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:41,533
Woodrow wilson died.

1921
01:33:41,575 --> 01:33:43,118
Yes. I heard.

1922
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:44,327
About a year ago.

1923
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:45,287
Last week.

1924
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:46,580
You have me there.

1925
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:49,124
This is not a charitable donation,
ross.

1926
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:50,625
I'm fighting them off
at the hotel,

1927
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:51,793
And my bank account
is so overdrawn,

1928
01:33:51,793 --> 01:33:53,503
It's positively
photographic.

1929
01:33:53,544 --> 01:33:55,379
You'll be paid eventually.
I promise.

1930
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:57,882
Don't believe him, dottie.
He owes me for years.

1931
01:33:57,923 --> 01:33:59,633
Jane, for christ's
sake, please.

1932
01:33:59,675 --> 01:34:01,802
Dottie, really,
this is just wonderful.

1933
01:34:01,843 --> 01:34:02,761
Herbert spencer
once said,

1934
01:34:02,803 --> 01:34:03,804
"A genius
can do readily

1935
01:34:03,845 --> 01:34:05,013
What nobody else
can do at all,"

1936
01:34:05,055 --> 01:34:06,890
And that's
what i'm doing.

1937
01:34:06,931 --> 01:34:09,642
Dottie,
i can't read this right now.

1938
01:34:09,684 --> 01:34:11,227
What a thing to be doing
at my age,

1939
01:34:11,269 --> 01:34:12,728
Sitting around
making up stories

1940
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:14,063
About broken-Hearted
sissies.

1941
01:34:14,105 --> 01:34:17,942
Dottie, where
are you going?

1942
01:34:35,541 --> 01:34:37,042
Mrs. Parker.

1943
01:34:38,836 --> 01:34:41,838
I just wanted to see
if you still answered to that.

1944
01:34:47,010 --> 01:34:49,470
We are still married,
aren't we, eddie?

1945
01:34:49,512 --> 01:34:50,972
I guess so.

1946
01:34:51,014 --> 01:34:54,642
I guess we ought to talk about
getting a divorce, then.

1947
01:34:54,684 --> 01:34:55,976
Not today.

1948
01:34:56,018 --> 01:34:57,478
I'm feeling
too good.

1949
01:34:57,478 --> 01:34:58,395
Oh, is it catching?

1950
01:34:58,437 --> 01:35:00,314
Sure. Why not?

1951
01:35:02,316 --> 01:35:04,151
You look swell,
eddie.

1952
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:05,485
Do i, really?

1953
01:35:05,485 --> 01:35:06,987
Truly.

1954
01:35:06,987 --> 01:35:08,488
Thanks.

1955
01:35:08,488 --> 01:35:09,989
You look beautiful.

1956
01:35:09,989 --> 01:35:11,991
Oh, where the hell
are you looking?

1957
01:35:12,033 --> 01:35:13,201
At you.

1958
01:35:13,242 --> 01:35:15,369
No. I'm...

1959
01:35:15,411 --> 01:35:18,455
Lower than worms.

1960
01:35:18,497 --> 01:35:21,458
I miss feeling
safe, eddie.

1961
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:23,460
I do miss that.

1962
01:35:23,502 --> 01:35:25,462
Is that
what we were?

1963
01:35:25,504 --> 01:35:27,297
You could have
fooled me.

1964
01:35:29,507 --> 01:35:32,301
You're not going
to cry, are you?

1965
01:35:35,513 --> 01:35:37,139
Woodrow died.

1966
01:35:37,181 --> 01:35:38,474
Did he?
I'm sorry.

1967
01:35:38,515 --> 01:35:41,977
I'm all alone again
and broke.

1968
01:35:42,019 --> 01:35:43,478
See?

1969
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:44,980
I'm flush.

1970
01:35:45,021 --> 01:35:47,315
Let me buy you
a present.

1971
01:35:53,404 --> 01:35:54,739
Now you can
buy me lunch

1972
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:58,033
If you promise
not to be very dull.

1973
01:35:59,410 --> 01:36:01,495
I'd love to, dear,
but i can't.

1974
01:36:01,537 --> 01:36:04,915
I'm meeting someone,
and i'm late.

1975
01:36:04,956 --> 01:36:06,833
Another time, though.
I insist.

1976
01:36:06,875 --> 01:36:10,503
Actually,
i'm meeting someone, too.

1977
01:36:10,545 --> 01:36:13,047
It's really been
lovely seeing you.

1978
01:36:18,177 --> 01:36:20,345
Dear...

1979
01:36:20,387 --> 01:36:22,014
Oh.

1980
01:36:23,932 --> 01:36:27,852
I do not like
my state of mind.

1981
01:36:27,852 --> 01:36:33,774
I'm bitter,
querulous, unkind.

1982
01:36:33,816 --> 01:36:38,654
I hate my legs,
i hate my hands,

1983
01:36:38,654 --> 01:36:42,991
I do not yearn
for lovelier lands.

1984
01:36:42,991 --> 01:36:45,952
I dread
the dawn's recurrent light.

1985
01:36:45,952 --> 01:36:48,913
I hate to go
to bed at night.

1986
01:36:48,955 --> 01:36:53,626
I snoot
at earnest, simple folk.

1987
01:36:53,626 --> 01:36:57,755
I cannot take
the gentlest joke.

1988
01:36:57,796 --> 01:37:01,758
I find no peace
in paint or type.

1989
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:04,136
My world is but
a lot of tripe.

1990
01:37:04,136 --> 01:37:07,764
I'm disillusioned,
empty-Breasted.

1991
01:37:07,806 --> 01:37:12,268
For what i think,
i'd be arrested.

1992
01:37:12,310 --> 01:37:14,478
I am not sick,

1993
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:17,148
I am not well.

1994
01:37:17,189 --> 01:37:20,943
My quondam dreams
are shot to hell.

1995
01:37:20,943 --> 01:37:24,237
My soul is crushed,

1996
01:37:24,237 --> 01:37:27,407
My spirit sore.

1997
01:37:27,449 --> 01:37:31,661
I do not like me
anymore.

1998
01:37:31,703 --> 01:37:36,499
I cavil, quarrel,
grumble, grouse.

1999
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:40,002
I ponder
on the narrow house.

2000
01:37:40,044 --> 01:37:45,465
I shudder
at the thought of men...

2001
01:37:48,218 --> 01:37:51,137
I'm due
to fall in love again.

2002
01:37:53,055 --> 01:37:56,142
Well, i'll mention it
to her again, mr. Case,

2003
01:37:56,183 --> 01:37:58,978
But there really isn't
that much i can do.

2004
01:37:59,019 --> 01:38:00,813
It's a very difficult
situation.

2005
01:38:03,023 --> 01:38:04,316
Dottie?

2006
01:38:06,651 --> 01:38:08,653
I'd like
to talk to you.

2007
01:38:08,653 --> 01:38:10,154
Cheese it, the fuzz.

2008
01:38:10,196 --> 01:38:13,491
Mrs. Parker.

2009
01:38:13,533 --> 01:38:15,368
I don't know how
he's going to feel

2010
01:38:15,409 --> 01:38:18,287
About an untrained puppy
piddling on his rugs.

2011
01:38:18,329 --> 01:38:19,246
He didn't
like it much

2012
01:38:19,288 --> 01:38:21,290
When the trained
one did.

2013
01:38:21,331 --> 01:38:22,416
Plus, i have
to write him

2014
01:38:22,457 --> 01:38:24,543
Another i.O.U.
For the rent.

2015
01:38:24,584 --> 01:38:26,461
Well, they wouldn't
throw you out.

2016
01:38:26,503 --> 01:38:28,797
You're good
for too much publicity.

2017
01:38:28,838 --> 01:38:30,298
How was lunch?

2018
01:38:30,298 --> 01:38:31,632
Did they talk
about me?

2019
01:38:31,674 --> 01:38:33,634
Of course they
talked about you.

2020
01:38:33,676 --> 01:38:35,803
Rex...

2021
01:38:35,845 --> 01:38:38,013
Learn to read,
darling.

2022
01:38:40,557 --> 01:38:44,519
It's time to think
about serious work.

2023
01:38:46,563 --> 01:38:48,356
Thinking is working,
isn't it?

2024
01:38:48,398 --> 01:38:49,774
Well,
of course it is.

2025
01:38:49,774 --> 01:38:51,609
It's the kind
that i do best.

2026
01:38:51,651 --> 01:38:53,819
Why don't you write
a novel, dear?

2027
01:38:53,861 --> 01:38:54,987
You could probably
knock one off

2028
01:38:55,029 --> 01:38:56,489
In, say,
20 or 30 years.

2029
01:38:56,530 --> 01:38:59,658
Oh, yes.
Why not a novel?

2030
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:02,536
I put as much work
into writing nonsense

2031
01:39:02,577 --> 01:39:04,121
As i do the things
that matter,

2032
01:39:04,162 --> 01:39:06,623
And it's the nonsense
everybody notices.

2033
01:39:06,665 --> 01:39:08,833
And you know what?

2034
01:39:08,875 --> 01:39:10,960
By the time i'm paid
for what i do,

2035
01:39:11,002 --> 01:39:14,046
The money's
already gone.

2036
01:39:14,046 --> 01:39:18,050
But you can dream
on a book, can't you?

2037
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:19,385
Absolutely.

2038
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:23,889
Have we
ever touched?

2039
01:39:38,485 --> 01:39:40,320
Hello,
mrs. Parker.

2040
01:40:06,052 --> 01:40:07,512
Mmm.

2041
01:40:14,477 --> 01:40:18,522
Do you think we should
drink this one, too, hmm?

2042
01:40:18,564 --> 01:40:20,315
How about to us?

2043
01:40:20,357 --> 01:40:24,528
Yes, it's too bad
we don't look prettier.

2044
01:40:24,569 --> 01:40:26,613
We were pretty once,
though, weren't we?

2045
01:40:26,655 --> 01:40:28,740
Hmm?

2046
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:31,326
You might not think
it matters,

2047
01:40:31,367 --> 01:40:33,536
But i do.

2048
01:40:33,578 --> 01:40:35,162
I'll tell you why.

2049
01:40:35,204 --> 01:40:39,541
Because, my dear,
it all turns on that.

2050
01:40:39,583 --> 01:40:42,336
All those little sags
and...

2051
01:40:43,837 --> 01:40:44,671
What is
going on here?

2052
01:40:44,713 --> 01:40:45,881
Yes, it's london zoo.

2053
01:40:45,922 --> 01:40:47,507
Listen.
I've had enough.

2054
01:40:47,549 --> 01:40:48,758
I really have.

2055
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,260
Is that this
woman's dog?

2056
01:40:50,301 --> 01:40:52,095
We've had these interruptions
on this set...

2057
01:40:52,136 --> 01:40:53,429
I did it.

2058
01:40:54,805 --> 01:40:55,723
Nicotine,
nicotine pip-Squeak.

2059
01:40:55,765 --> 01:40:56,891
Listen, sergei.

2060
01:40:56,932 --> 01:40:58,142
This is not
the steppes of russia.

2061
01:40:58,183 --> 01:41:01,103
This is
the united states of america.

2062
01:41:07,192 --> 01:41:09,819
So zanuck says give him
a death scene.

2063
01:41:09,861 --> 01:41:11,404
That'll win an oscar.

2064
01:41:11,446 --> 01:41:13,614
This guy couldn't play dead
if you cremated him.

2065
01:41:13,656 --> 01:41:14,782
Move over.

2066
01:41:14,824 --> 01:41:16,617
What's wrong,
dottie?

2067
01:41:16,659 --> 01:41:18,244
I never worked
on a picture that i liked,

2068
01:41:18,285 --> 01:41:21,788
And i never worked on a picture
that liked me.

2069
01:41:21,788 --> 01:41:22,956
Dottie,
i need a line.

2070
01:41:22,956 --> 01:41:24,583
There's a guy
standing on a ledge,

2071
01:41:24,624 --> 01:41:26,167
And his wife's
got to say something.

2072
01:41:26,209 --> 01:41:28,336
No. Let her push
the son of a bitch

2073
01:41:28,378 --> 01:41:29,462
Without speaking.

2074
01:41:29,462 --> 01:41:30,797
Over!

2075
01:41:30,797 --> 01:41:32,673
Hey, dottie.
Saw alan on the lot this morning

2076
01:41:32,715 --> 01:41:34,300
Standing right
beside wardrobe.

2077
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:37,011
Wearing a dress,
no doubt.

2078
01:41:37,052 --> 01:41:38,262
Hi, harry.

2079
01:41:38,262 --> 01:41:39,430
Harry.

2080
01:41:39,471 --> 01:41:40,514
You guys hear
about bob benchley?

2081
01:41:40,556 --> 01:41:41,181
No.

2082
01:41:41,223 --> 01:41:42,099
Hi, dottie.

2083
01:41:42,099 --> 01:41:43,767
Hey, listen, harry.
I need a line.

2084
01:41:43,809 --> 01:41:45,268
Forget about that.

2085
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:46,770
Harry,
what about benchley?

2086
01:41:46,811 --> 01:41:48,146
He, uh, he died.

2087
01:41:49,689 --> 01:41:52,483
You're kidding.

2088
01:41:52,525 --> 01:41:54,735
How?

2089
01:41:54,777 --> 01:41:57,613
Cirrhosis of the liver,
hemorrhaging.

2090
01:41:57,655 --> 01:41:58,739
They say
marc connelly

2091
01:41:58,781 --> 01:42:00,616
Ran around
the stork club

2092
01:42:00,657 --> 01:42:02,117
Looking for
blood donors.

2093
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:03,618
God, benchley.

2094
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:06,413
I talked to him just
before i left town.

2095
01:42:06,454 --> 01:42:07,914
Dottie...

2096
01:42:07,956 --> 01:42:09,958
Oh, that's
just dandy.

2097
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:16,630
Well, if it isn't
mr. Dorothy parker.

2098
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:17,923
Hello, dottie.

2099
01:42:17,965 --> 01:42:19,925
Thought i might
as well

2100
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:22,219
Get my things
out of your way.

2101
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:23,595
What's in here?
This is mine, you shit!

2102
01:42:23,637 --> 01:42:24,930
You queer!

2103
01:42:24,971 --> 01:42:26,598
You can't use that anymore,
and you know it.

2104
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:29,684
Oh, surely not because of your
wartime adventures in london.

2105
01:42:29,684 --> 01:42:31,352
Everybody knows
it's a lie, dottie,

2106
01:42:31,352 --> 01:42:32,562
And so do you.

2107
01:42:32,603 --> 01:42:33,771
Just because you
fucked another woman

2108
01:42:33,813 --> 01:42:36,190
Doesn't make it
all better.

2109
01:42:36,232 --> 01:42:37,691
Good-Bye, darling.

2110
01:42:37,691 --> 01:42:39,026
Oh, that's right.

2111
01:42:39,026 --> 01:42:42,029
Take your toys and gallop away,
sidesaddle!

2112
01:42:42,029 --> 01:42:44,823
And don't forget to bore a
hole in the hobby-Horse,

2113
01:42:44,865 --> 01:42:47,033
You fucking idiot!

2114
01:43:10,013 --> 01:43:15,101
Oh, fred.

2115
01:43:15,101 --> 01:43:18,103
Dear fred.

2116
01:43:18,103 --> 01:43:22,899
You lovely, wonderful shit.

2117
01:44:20,410 --> 01:44:22,663
Department of mass hysteria
and indecision.

2118
01:44:22,663 --> 01:44:25,207
The new year you ordered
is due shortly

2119
01:44:25,248 --> 01:44:27,834
And may be picked up
at the will-Call desk.

2120
01:44:27,876 --> 01:44:29,669
Where have you been
all evening?

2121
01:44:29,669 --> 01:44:30,878
Hello, charlie!

2122
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:32,839
Anyone seen
my noisemakers?

2123
01:44:32,839 --> 01:44:34,173
You are
a noisemaker!

2124
01:44:34,173 --> 01:44:35,883
Where are my damn
noisemakers?

2125
01:44:35,925 --> 01:44:38,135
I think she likes
you better.

2126
01:44:38,135 --> 01:44:41,722
Yes. Meow, too.

2127
01:44:41,763 --> 01:44:44,558
James,
my stomach hurts.

2128
01:44:44,599 --> 01:44:47,852
I like champagne,
but it doesn't like me.

2129
01:44:47,894 --> 01:44:49,062
Oh, you're just being
modest, mary.

2130
01:44:49,103 --> 01:44:52,023
Ha ha ha!

2131
01:44:52,065 --> 01:44:53,524
Are you nauseous,
dear?

2132
01:44:53,566 --> 01:44:54,358
My stomach.

2133
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:55,568
Your stomach.

2134
01:44:55,568 --> 01:44:58,070
Well,
pardon my pussy.

2135
01:44:58,070 --> 01:45:00,823
Everywhere i draw breath
is a social hall!

2136
01:45:00,864 --> 01:45:02,449
Then go breathe
somewhere else!

2137
01:45:02,491 --> 01:45:05,285
I'm sure
jane means...

2138
01:45:05,327 --> 01:45:06,453
Aleck!

2139
01:45:06,494 --> 01:45:08,413
If you were a true
gentleman, aleck,

2140
01:45:08,455 --> 01:45:09,539
You'd pinch my ass!

2141
01:45:09,581 --> 01:45:11,666
Aleck,
what the hell?

2142
01:45:11,708 --> 01:45:12,750
Calm down,
please.

2143
01:45:12,792 --> 01:45:15,836
Will you please
calm down, aleck?

2144
01:45:18,005 --> 01:45:21,008
didn't i give you
a dollar?

2145
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:27,680
You know, charlie,

2146
01:45:27,722 --> 01:45:31,684
I actually made-Believe
we'd be married someday.

2147
01:45:31,684 --> 01:45:33,978
I even decided
what to wear.

2148
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:36,689
Ah, jesus christ,
dot.

2149
01:45:36,689 --> 01:45:40,984
A rather pinkish gray
with butterfly orchids.

2150
01:45:41,026 --> 01:45:42,778
Your passion
for unhappiness

2151
01:45:42,819 --> 01:45:45,989
Is goddamn endless.

2152
01:45:46,031 --> 01:45:48,616
But you're fine,
aren't you?

2153
01:45:48,658 --> 01:45:50,493
You're all well.

2154
01:45:52,703 --> 01:45:54,121
Just wish you wouldn't
sentimentalize

2155
01:45:54,163 --> 01:45:56,499
All the time.

2156
01:45:56,499 --> 01:46:03,005
And i wish i never learned
to take off my clothes.

2157
01:46:18,686 --> 01:46:20,437
Happy new year, charlie.

2158
01:46:20,479 --> 01:46:21,980
Dottie.

2159
01:46:23,690 --> 01:46:26,818
Happy new year,
john peter.

2160
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:30,321
Harpo,
you'll appreciate this.

2161
01:46:30,363 --> 01:46:34,450
The wisdom tooth...
A comedy in three acts.

2162
01:46:34,492 --> 01:46:36,494
Act one...

2163
01:46:36,535 --> 01:46:37,578
Ha ha ha!

2164
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:39,538
Scene one.

2165
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:40,873
It gets better.

2166
01:46:40,914 --> 01:46:42,499
"A men's washroom.

2167
01:46:42,541 --> 01:46:46,503
Four washbasins are against the wall,
running diagonally."

2168
01:46:49,589 --> 01:46:51,174
Why would i
ruin the night?

2169
01:46:51,215 --> 01:46:52,675
Oh, here.

2170
01:46:52,717 --> 01:46:53,968
Here. One of
your friends.

2171
01:46:54,010 --> 01:46:55,553
Why don't you tell her
about the fact

2172
01:46:55,594 --> 01:46:57,137
That you want
to leave.

2173
01:46:57,179 --> 01:47:00,182
Too late, mary.

2174
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:01,058
Hmm?

2175
01:47:01,058 --> 01:47:01,975
Oh!

2176
01:47:02,017 --> 01:47:03,810
Did he swallow a nut?

2177
01:47:03,852 --> 01:47:05,395
Have you been
drinking, ross?

2178
01:47:05,437 --> 01:47:06,688
Heavily.

2179
01:47:06,730 --> 01:47:09,149
Don't, for a minute,
think i'm not incoherent.

2180
01:47:09,190 --> 01:47:11,192
I would never
not think that.

2181
01:47:11,192 --> 01:47:12,276
There you two are.

2182
01:47:12,318 --> 01:47:14,195
I've been toothing this
comb with a fine...

2183
01:47:14,195 --> 01:47:16,614
Put us back together,
dr. Benchley.

2184
01:47:16,655 --> 01:47:18,365
We're broken into
little bits.

2185
01:47:18,365 --> 01:47:19,742
What seems to be
the problem?

2186
01:47:19,783 --> 01:47:20,909
You, sir, appear
pained enough

2187
01:47:20,951 --> 01:47:23,662
To have appeared
in my column.

2188
01:47:23,662 --> 01:47:26,956
I suppose i should say something
amusing about leaving life,

2189
01:47:26,998 --> 01:47:30,668
But i'm afraid i don't find
any of this amusing anymore.

2190
01:47:30,668 --> 01:47:32,545
what is everybody
staring at?

2191
01:47:32,587 --> 01:47:34,755
That's rude of me.

2192
01:47:34,797 --> 01:47:36,257
Mr. Benchley.

2193
01:47:36,298 --> 01:47:37,383
Mr. Sherwood.

2194
01:47:37,424 --> 01:47:38,842
Mrs. Parker.

2195
01:47:47,517 --> 01:47:50,103
Where are you going,
robert?

2196
01:47:53,606 --> 01:47:56,942
Couldn't have stood another
moment of him looking at me,

2197
01:47:56,942 --> 01:47:59,528
Thinking of what a public
clown i turned out to be.

2198
01:47:59,570 --> 01:48:01,029
Oh, fred.

2199
01:48:01,071 --> 01:48:04,032
That's not what
he was thinking at all.

2200
01:48:04,074 --> 01:48:05,867
Hello.

2201
01:48:09,579 --> 01:48:11,247
Bobby.

2202
01:48:11,247 --> 01:48:12,748
Mademoiselle gerard!

2203
01:48:12,790 --> 01:48:15,042
How did it go?

2204
01:48:15,042 --> 01:48:17,044
Great.

2205
01:48:17,044 --> 01:48:20,214
Isn't he just the bee's knees,
dottie?

2206
01:48:20,255 --> 01:48:21,548
Did you miss me?

2207
01:48:21,548 --> 01:48:23,550
Does the sun
miss the stars?

2208
01:48:23,550 --> 01:48:25,552
Did jackson
miss-Issippi?

2209
01:48:25,552 --> 01:48:26,886
Cain miss abel?

2210
01:48:26,886 --> 01:48:29,556
What do you say
we go wild tonight?

2211
01:48:29,556 --> 01:48:31,224
If you insist.

2212
01:48:31,265 --> 01:48:33,226
Little miss muffet?

2213
01:48:33,267 --> 01:48:35,436
Christmas cheer?

2214
01:48:35,478 --> 01:48:37,521
I try to worry,
mrs. Parker,

2215
01:48:37,563 --> 01:48:39,523
But i can't.

2216
01:48:39,523 --> 01:48:41,525
Isn't anybody happy?

2217
01:48:41,567 --> 01:48:44,111
I feel sick
to my stomach.

2218
01:48:45,779 --> 01:48:49,115
Tolstoy? I always found
tolstoy rather dreary!

2219
01:48:49,157 --> 01:48:50,283
Poor alvan.

2220
01:48:50,325 --> 01:48:52,160
You're right.
Tolstoy isn't very cheerful.

2221
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:52,994
And sentimental!

2222
01:48:53,035 --> 01:48:54,495
Nor sentimental,
for that matter.

2223
01:48:54,537 --> 01:48:56,038
What's he written?

2224
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:58,040
He's a doctor,
a psychotherapist.

2225
01:48:58,082 --> 01:49:00,084
A good one, too,
actually.

2226
01:49:00,125 --> 01:49:03,545
Because of his understanding
of how pure sorrow

2227
01:49:03,587 --> 01:49:06,423
Is no more possible
than pure joy.

2228
01:49:06,464 --> 01:49:09,050
That's hardly
reasonable!

2229
01:49:09,092 --> 01:49:11,052
your friends
don't care

2230
01:49:11,094 --> 01:49:13,387
For the russians,
i'm afraid.

2231
01:49:13,429 --> 01:49:15,056
Come on, doctor.

2232
01:49:15,097 --> 01:49:18,058
Let's talk about
my sorrow and joy.

2233
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:21,061
You don't mind,
do you, paula?

2234
01:49:21,103 --> 01:49:22,562
Why, no.

2235
01:49:22,604 --> 01:49:24,564
Well, at least
i asked.

2236
01:49:24,606 --> 01:49:27,067
i'm a-Freud of that man.

2237
01:49:29,110 --> 01:49:31,362
Someone pay attention
to me!

2238
01:49:39,078 --> 01:49:44,291
My great fear is being
a bitter old woman

2239
01:49:44,332 --> 01:49:46,042
Alone in her room,

2240
01:49:46,042 --> 01:49:48,670
Who, despite
all requests for rain,

2241
01:49:48,711 --> 01:49:53,049
Will meet her maker
on a bright, sunny day.

2242
01:49:54,759 --> 01:49:57,553
I don't know if this is
a terrible tragedy

2243
01:49:57,553 --> 01:49:59,388
Or a big fucking joke.

2244
01:50:06,269 --> 01:50:07,854
Would you like
a nut?

2245
01:50:07,896 --> 01:50:08,813
Could you just
close the door

2246
01:50:08,855 --> 01:50:12,066
On your way out,
please?

2247
01:50:14,568 --> 01:50:16,612
Oh, sit here.

2248
01:50:16,654 --> 01:50:18,364
Please.

2249
01:50:24,411 --> 01:50:26,079
Happy new year,
harp.

2250
01:50:38,549 --> 01:50:42,094
Well...what are you
waiting for?

2251
01:50:44,096 --> 01:50:46,097
Analyze.

2252
01:50:50,101 --> 01:50:53,479
Analysis is
a serious business.

2253
01:50:53,521 --> 01:50:55,398
Would it help
if i cried?

2254
01:50:55,439 --> 01:50:57,066
One needs an office,

2255
01:50:57,107 --> 01:50:58,233
A certain amount
of formality.

2256
01:50:58,275 --> 01:51:00,319
What if i put on
a more expensive dress

2257
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:03,071
And then cried?

2258
01:51:03,113 --> 01:51:04,614
Well, it's safe
to suggest

2259
01:51:04,614 --> 01:51:06,491
That you
examine the need

2260
01:51:06,533 --> 01:51:07,617
You and your
colleagues feel

2261
01:51:07,617 --> 01:51:09,827
To spend so much time
together.

2262
01:51:09,869 --> 01:51:12,955
They're shits, really,
except for mr. Benchley.

2263
01:51:12,955 --> 01:51:17,168
That's quite a thing to say
about your best friends.

2264
01:51:19,253 --> 01:51:21,046
Please be sweet.

2265
01:51:22,547 --> 01:51:26,051
Don't know why
i can't work anymore,

2266
01:51:26,051 --> 01:51:30,221
Why life is
so goddamned painful.

2267
01:51:33,057 --> 01:51:36,685
If we identify your inability to
work as the primary problem...

2268
01:51:36,727 --> 01:51:38,020
It's a tossup, really,
between that

2269
01:51:38,062 --> 01:51:40,522
And my inability
to get laid.

2270
01:51:40,564 --> 01:51:42,190
Then we ought to examine

2271
01:51:42,190 --> 01:51:44,526
How your energy
is being spent instead.

2272
01:51:44,568 --> 01:51:46,236
What else?

2273
01:51:46,278 --> 01:51:47,987
Your drinking.

2274
01:51:48,029 --> 01:51:50,698
Oh, it doesn't do me
much good anymore,

2275
01:51:50,740 --> 01:51:53,201
But that's about
the extent of it.

2276
01:51:53,242 --> 01:51:55,036
I have to disagree.

2277
01:51:55,077 --> 01:51:57,496
Well,
maybe it's the bad whiskey i've been getting.

2278
01:51:57,538 --> 01:51:58,664
May i say,

2279
01:51:58,664 --> 01:52:00,249
The real stuff never
made me suffer.

2280
01:52:00,290 --> 01:52:03,335
It's not what you're suffering,
mrs. Parker.

2281
01:52:03,335 --> 01:52:04,086
It's what
you're missing.

2282
01:52:04,127 --> 01:52:05,170
In my opinion,

2283
01:52:05,212 --> 01:52:09,340
You and your friends
are missing a great deal.

2284
01:52:09,382 --> 01:52:10,967
It's a sign
of insecurity,

2285
01:52:11,009 --> 01:52:14,470
This compulsion to be
constantly with each other,

2286
01:52:14,512 --> 01:52:16,055
To be constantly
entertaining,

2287
01:52:16,097 --> 01:52:18,932
But never discussing one subject for long,
never in-Depth.

2288
01:52:18,974 --> 01:52:22,644
The serious side of
your nature is lost...

2289
01:52:22,686 --> 01:52:24,646
Your purpose.

2290
01:52:24,688 --> 01:52:29,651
And then
you can't write.

2291
01:52:29,692 --> 01:52:30,777
I think life
is something more

2292
01:52:30,777 --> 01:52:32,111
Than being able
to breathe.

2293
01:52:33,696 --> 01:52:36,365
Do i have to
believe that

2294
01:52:36,407 --> 01:52:37,491
To feel better?

2295
01:52:39,410 --> 01:52:42,704
Tell me about
your mother.

2296
01:52:42,746 --> 01:52:46,207
She died
when you were 5.

2297
01:52:46,249 --> 01:52:49,669
Actually,
it was a month before my 5th birthday.

2298
01:52:49,711 --> 01:52:52,380
Oh...

2299
01:52:52,421 --> 01:52:55,174
Sometimes i...

2300
01:52:55,216 --> 01:53:00,220
I think i catch a
bit of her voice,

2301
01:53:00,220 --> 01:53:02,639
Her scent,

2302
01:53:02,681 --> 01:53:05,350
Something
she once said,

2303
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:10,855
And then...
it slips away.

2304
01:53:10,855 --> 01:53:14,900
Oh,
i suppose she loved me and kept me warm

2305
01:53:14,942 --> 01:53:15,651
And made sure
i ate roughage,

2306
01:53:15,693 --> 01:53:17,194
But the, uh...

2307
01:53:18,696 --> 01:53:20,155
The truth is,

2308
01:53:20,197 --> 01:53:25,076
I barely remember
a thing about her.

2309
01:53:25,118 --> 01:53:26,411
That's no reason
to be afraid.

2310
01:53:26,453 --> 01:53:28,371
It's good to remember.

2311
01:53:28,413 --> 01:53:30,331
But i'm not
remembering.

2312
01:53:30,331 --> 01:53:33,626
I'm just guessing.

2313
01:53:33,668 --> 01:53:36,128
I'm guessing
everything.

2314
01:53:36,170 --> 01:53:38,631
It would be
different, if only...

2315
01:53:38,672 --> 01:53:40,632
Ah...

2316
01:53:40,674 --> 01:53:43,468
If only this.
If only that.

2317
01:53:47,138 --> 01:53:49,307
Where are you going,
dorothy?

2318
01:53:49,349 --> 01:53:51,142
I'm returning
to my room.

2319
01:53:51,142 --> 01:53:53,644
My anxieties are waiting.
They miss me.

2320
01:53:53,644 --> 01:53:56,313
You think
that's a good idea?

2321
01:53:56,355 --> 01:53:57,606
I like my room.

2322
01:53:57,648 --> 01:53:59,608
Everything i need
is there.

2323
01:53:59,650 --> 01:54:01,944
Don't you think
you should stay here

2324
01:54:01,944 --> 01:54:04,946
Until you face this pain
more directly?

2325
01:54:04,946 --> 01:54:07,615
Face it
more directly?

2326
01:54:07,657 --> 01:54:10,118
Um, i face it every day.

2327
01:54:10,159 --> 01:54:12,620
I fall in love
with married men,

2328
01:54:12,662 --> 01:54:14,830
But i do it on purpose.

2329
01:54:14,872 --> 01:54:18,083
I drink too much,
and that's because i'm thirsty.

2330
01:54:18,083 --> 01:54:25,632
And i write doodads because
it's a doodad kind of town.

2331
01:54:25,674 --> 01:54:30,637
It's, um, nothing...
personal, doctor,

2332
01:54:30,678 --> 01:54:33,347
But i think
my version of pain

2333
01:54:33,389 --> 01:54:35,182
Is more fun than yours.

2334
01:54:37,685 --> 01:54:39,436
You're up.

2335
01:54:41,188 --> 01:54:42,606
Mr. Kaufman.

2336
01:54:42,648 --> 01:54:44,816
I'm surprised
to see you here.

2337
01:54:44,858 --> 01:54:46,026
You, me,
all of manhattan,

2338
01:54:46,026 --> 01:54:50,113
And parts of schenectady,
i'm sure.

2339
01:54:50,154 --> 01:54:52,448
Did she say anything
about me?

2340
01:55:15,136 --> 01:55:18,639
Just a little one...
while we're up.

2341
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:21,642
My dear, do let me
congratulate you.

2342
01:55:21,642 --> 01:55:23,310
You must be
terribly proud...

2343
01:55:23,310 --> 01:55:24,644
Who?

2344
01:55:24,644 --> 01:55:26,146
Dorothy parker.

2345
01:55:26,146 --> 01:55:27,772
Dorothy parker, yeah,
the writer.

2346
01:55:27,814 --> 01:55:29,774
I worked with
her and her husband

2347
01:55:29,774 --> 01:55:31,943
In hollywood
a long time ago.

2348
01:55:31,943 --> 01:55:35,112
They had just
remarried.

2349
01:55:35,112 --> 01:55:36,780
Didn't she commit
suicide?

2350
01:55:36,822 --> 01:55:38,490
Shh. No, no, no.

2351
01:55:38,532 --> 01:55:39,867
What? I'm just
asking a question.

2352
01:55:39,908 --> 01:55:41,368
She was very famous.

2353
01:55:41,410 --> 01:55:44,704
For writing movies or for
marrying the same guy twice?

2354
01:55:44,746 --> 01:55:46,206
For having lunch,
mostly.

2355
01:55:46,247 --> 01:55:48,083
Ha ha ha!

2356
01:55:48,083 --> 01:55:50,251
is that a double?

2357
01:55:50,293 --> 01:55:53,087
You didn't ask
for a double, lady.

2358
01:55:53,129 --> 01:55:54,922
I didn't?

2359
01:55:54,922 --> 01:55:58,634
I meant to.
I promise you.

2360
01:55:58,676 --> 01:56:00,844
I'll get you
another one.

2361
01:56:04,181 --> 01:56:07,642
How about
a little tummy rub?

2362
01:56:07,684 --> 01:56:11,729
Part of the romance
of digestion.

2363
01:56:11,771 --> 01:56:13,731
I want you to meet her.
Just for a second.

2364
01:56:13,731 --> 01:56:17,902
It's all right.
Go ahead. Sit.

2365
01:56:17,902 --> 01:56:20,612
Mrs. Parker, i hope
we're not disturbing you.

2366
01:56:20,654 --> 01:56:22,322
Well...

2367
01:56:22,364 --> 01:56:23,824
Do you remember me?

2368
01:56:23,865 --> 01:56:26,117
Honey,
i don't remember this morning.

2369
01:56:26,159 --> 01:56:27,619
Ha ha ha!

2370
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:29,329
I'm fred hunter.

2371
01:56:29,329 --> 01:56:31,247
I acted in a picture

2372
01:56:31,289 --> 01:56:33,624
That you and your husband,
alan campbell,

2373
01:56:33,666 --> 01:56:35,251
Wrote several
years ago...

2374
01:56:35,292 --> 01:56:37,336
Flight to nowhere.

2375
01:56:37,336 --> 01:56:39,338
Well, i got
cut out, but...

2376
01:56:39,338 --> 01:56:40,339
Honey,
if i wrote it,

2377
01:56:40,339 --> 01:56:42,799
They cut me out,
too.

2378
01:56:42,841 --> 01:56:45,093
These are two friends
of mine...Marcy and june.

2379
01:56:45,135 --> 01:56:47,637
This is mrs. Parker,
dorothy parker.

2380
01:56:47,637 --> 01:56:49,597
Can we buy you
a drink?

2381
01:56:49,639 --> 01:56:51,265
Well, sure.
Ha ha ha!

2382
01:56:51,307 --> 01:56:54,644
Can we get another drink
here for mrs. Parker?

2383
01:56:54,644 --> 01:56:55,853
I was just
telling them

2384
01:56:55,895 --> 01:56:58,314
About the old
hollywood days

2385
01:56:58,355 --> 01:56:59,815
And about your husband.

2386
01:56:59,857 --> 01:57:01,942
He was so, so nice to me
when we worked together.

2387
01:57:01,942 --> 01:57:05,570
I don't doubt it.

2388
01:57:05,612 --> 01:57:07,280
Unhappily...Oh,
i beg your pardon.

2389
01:57:07,322 --> 01:57:08,948
Happily, i'm away
from hollywood now,

2390
01:57:08,948 --> 01:57:14,161
And i don't have to
hear about that crap.

2391
01:57:14,203 --> 01:57:16,163
Whatever happened
to that director?

2392
01:57:16,205 --> 01:57:17,373
What was his name?
I can't remember.

2393
01:57:17,414 --> 01:57:19,750
He went to jail,

2394
01:57:19,750 --> 01:57:23,378
For being an american
in the u.S. Of a.

2395
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:25,297
Oh, really. Jail?

2396
01:57:25,338 --> 01:57:27,674
Oh, you mean
because of the...Right.

2397
01:57:27,716 --> 01:57:29,717
Thank you.

2398
01:57:29,759 --> 01:57:32,345
Did you, uh,
i mean...

2399
01:57:32,386 --> 01:57:34,096
Oh, no, no, dear.

2400
01:57:34,096 --> 01:57:37,892
But i bought a new hat,
just in case.

2401
01:57:37,892 --> 01:57:39,476
Well, there's plenty
of money in hollywood

2402
01:57:39,518 --> 01:57:40,811
To buy things with.

2403
01:57:40,853 --> 01:57:42,354
Oh, hollywood.

2404
01:57:42,396 --> 01:57:43,605
Money isn't real.

2405
01:57:43,647 --> 01:57:44,898
It's like...

2406
01:57:44,898 --> 01:57:46,691
Well,
i don't know what the money is like.

2407
01:57:46,733 --> 01:57:49,235
It's like small ice
in your hand.

2408
01:57:49,277 --> 01:57:51,821
We got to go.

2409
01:57:51,863 --> 01:57:53,906
Oh, o.K. Great.

2410
01:57:53,906 --> 01:57:55,658
Mrs. Parker,
we're on our way

2411
01:57:55,699 --> 01:57:56,617
To a movie.

2412
01:57:56,617 --> 01:57:58,243
Would you like
to join us?

2413
01:57:58,285 --> 01:58:01,413
Why were you just asking
me about hollywood?

2414
01:58:01,455 --> 01:58:04,082
The thing has come down
on me like a curtain,

2415
01:58:04,124 --> 01:58:06,418
And i don't want to
remember those things.

2416
01:58:06,459 --> 01:58:07,460
Why are you trying

2417
01:58:07,502 --> 01:58:08,753
To split these
curtains to me...

2418
01:58:08,795 --> 01:58:12,298
Just a nice woman
trying to talk to you?

2419
01:58:12,298 --> 01:58:13,591
We're going
to be late.

2420
01:58:13,633 --> 01:58:16,719
O.K. Well, anyway...

2421
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:18,595
Fred...

2422
01:58:18,637 --> 01:58:21,848
Always late.

2423
01:58:21,890 --> 01:58:23,892
Someone said
they'd have to keep

2424
01:58:23,934 --> 01:58:28,062
Heaven open
after hours for him.

2425
01:58:28,104 --> 01:58:30,356
Ha.

2426
01:58:30,398 --> 01:58:33,568
Well, mrs. Parker,
it's a pleasure to see you.

2427
01:58:33,609 --> 01:58:36,403
You look...
It's nice to see you.

2428
01:58:44,119 --> 01:58:45,912
Well...

2429
01:58:47,831 --> 01:58:51,542
A dependable
fact-Of-Life cliche...

2430
01:58:51,584 --> 01:58:56,422
Everything's always worse
than you thought it would be.

2431
01:59:15,606 --> 01:59:18,067
We are here to honor
dorothy parker

2432
01:59:18,067 --> 01:59:20,944
Because the clean wit
of her verse

2433
01:59:20,986 --> 01:59:23,697
And the sharp perceptions
in her stories

2434
01:59:23,739 --> 01:59:27,117
Have produced a brilliant record
of our times.

2435
01:59:27,158 --> 01:59:29,827
Because of mrs. Parker's
true talent,

2436
01:59:29,869 --> 01:59:32,830
Her early work gives us
as much pleasure today

2437
01:59:32,872 --> 01:59:35,124
As it did 30 years ago.

2438
01:59:35,166 --> 01:59:36,834
what horse shit,

2439
01:59:36,834 --> 01:59:38,794
With apologies
to the horses.

2440
01:59:38,836 --> 01:59:42,297
...happily names
dorothy parker

2441
01:59:42,339 --> 01:59:46,092
As this year's recipient of
the marjorie peabody waite award

2442
01:59:46,134 --> 01:59:49,304
For achievement
and integrity.

2443
02:00:22,125 --> 02:00:24,836
I never thought
i'd make it.

2444
02:02:16,730 --> 02:02:18,148
Do you miss the glamour
of the jazz age?

2445
02:02:18,190 --> 02:02:22,819
Glamour? They ought to
call it the dingy decade.

2446
02:02:22,861 --> 02:02:24,738
What disturbs you most
about american culture,

2447
02:02:24,779 --> 02:02:26,865
Mrs. Parker?

2448
02:02:26,906 --> 02:02:30,868
Stupidity, intolerance,
and segregation...

2449
02:02:30,910 --> 02:02:32,829
Particularly segregation.

2450
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:35,956
Is it true that you
were involved in

2451
02:02:35,998 --> 02:02:37,124
The spanish
civil war?

2452
02:02:37,166 --> 02:02:39,293
Why do we have to
go into that?

2453
02:02:39,334 --> 02:02:41,503
Yes, i was!

2454
02:02:41,545 --> 02:02:44,965
Indeed,
i should like to say

2455
02:02:45,006 --> 02:02:48,843
It was the proudest thing
i've ever been of.

2456
02:02:48,843 --> 02:02:50,845
I was, for a time,

2457
02:02:50,845 --> 02:02:55,141
With the proudest people
i've ever been of.

2458
02:02:55,182 --> 02:02:58,310
And that doesn't
hurt you, you know.

2459
02:02:58,310 --> 02:03:01,772
What do you think of kerouac and
the beat generation writers?

2460
02:03:01,813 --> 02:03:06,276
Well, you'll...
You'll take him.

2461
02:03:06,318 --> 02:03:09,279
I think this thing of
the beat generation...

2462
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:10,780
Do you mind?

2463
02:03:10,822 --> 02:03:12,782
I think it's
perfect nonsense,

2464
02:03:12,824 --> 02:03:14,742
And i think
in a couple of years,

2465
02:03:14,784 --> 02:03:16,160
They'll be forgotten.

2466
02:03:16,202 --> 02:03:19,997
But us, messy as we were
and all that,

2467
02:03:20,038 --> 02:03:21,832
We're not going to be
forgotten,

2468
02:03:21,873 --> 02:03:23,959
Because some of us
came out of it.

2469
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,086
There came out benchley.
There came out fitzgerald.

2470
02:03:26,127 --> 02:03:27,670
There came out
hemingway.

2471
02:03:27,712 --> 02:03:29,088
There came out broun.

2472
02:03:29,130 --> 02:03:30,673
There came out
sherwood.

2473
02:03:30,715 --> 02:03:32,675
Well,
for heaven's sweet sake,

2474
02:03:32,717 --> 02:03:35,177
Who's coming out
of the beatniks?

2475
02:03:35,219 --> 02:03:38,722
All right. Kerouac.
All right. All right.

2476
02:03:38,722 --> 02:03:39,848
Ha ha ha!

2477
02:03:39,890 --> 02:03:40,891
Have you
thought about

2478
02:03:40,933 --> 02:03:42,684
What you'd like
to have written

2479
02:03:42,726 --> 02:03:44,686
On your tombstone,
mrs. Parker?

2480
02:03:44,728 --> 02:03:48,690
What a morbid thing
to ask a person.

2481
02:03:48,731 --> 02:03:52,693
You've just stolen
my heart.

2482
02:03:52,735 --> 02:03:55,863
Actually, i have
composed something

2483
02:03:55,905 --> 02:03:57,531
For my epitaph,

2484
02:03:57,573 --> 02:03:58,699
Something memorable,
i hope.

2485
02:03:58,699 --> 02:04:01,201
Well, i'm not
a bit surprised.

2486
02:04:01,201 --> 02:04:04,037
Are you going to let
me know what it is?

2487
02:04:13,713 --> 02:04:16,799
Come here, dear.

2488
02:04:16,841 --> 02:04:19,802
Off we go.

2489
02:04:19,843 --> 02:04:21,678
Excuse me.

2490
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:24,014
What did she say?
