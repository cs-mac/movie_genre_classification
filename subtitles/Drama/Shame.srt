1
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:43,454
Hey, it's me.

2
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:50,044
Pick up.

3
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:21,576
Hi.
Hi.

4
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,578
Come in.

5
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,544
Drink?

6
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,129
No, thank you.

7
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:43,848
Perfect.

8
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,435
This way.

9
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,733
Slowly.

10
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,376
Hey, it's me.

11
00:04:55,462 --> 00:05:00,549
Pick up.

12
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,388
Brandon?

13
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:13,229
Brandon?

14
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,567
Brandon, where are you?

15
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,908
Brandon? Brandon?

16
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:32,581
Brandon?

17
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,090
Ugh!

18
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,929
This is me calling you.

19
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,351
Fuck!

20
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,135
"I find you disgusting.

21
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,601
"I find you inconsolable.
I find you invasive."

22
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,189
This is what
the cynics used to say.

23
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,109
Companies would refuse
to look into the future.

24
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,988
They would say,
"Can we stop this virus?"

25
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,783
As if it was
a negative progression.

26
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,578
But it's growing.

27
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:45,251
More and more,
with a momentum that is unstoppable.

28
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,128
Now some kid snorts
the entire load of his mother's spice cupboard.

29
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,922
Post that on YouTube.

30
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,674
They would watch
as it becomes the buzz word

31
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,634
amongst high school
students everywhere.

32
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,012
Eventually, the cynicism
is turning into awe.

33
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,289
Do you know what's going on
with my computer?

34
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,874
They took it.

35
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,753
Yeah, I know.
Someone could have told me.

36
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,923
Some kind of virus.

37
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,801
Cool.

38
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,137
Thank you.

39
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,536
Okay, me again.

40
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:31,834
I'm dying. I have cancer.
I have one week to live.

41
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,088
The very worst
kind of cancer.

42
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,881
Of the vulva...

43
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,851
Hey.
Hey.

44
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,300
You're such a dick.

45
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,469
What are you
doing, man?

46
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,225
All right, gentlemen.
If you just please make yourselves at home.

47
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,227
Thank you.
Thank you.

48
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:54,166
It falls upon me
as your beloved boss to propose a toast.

49
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,334
To success.

50
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,086
I just hope my wife
appreciates it.

51
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,881
Get a new tie, please.

52
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,258
Jesus Christ.

53
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,718
Oh, my goodness.

54
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,347
I love women in suits.
I love women in suits.

55
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,807
We could talk business,
I would rearrange my life.

56
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,309
Wow, she's beautiful.
Gray suit?

57
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,686
I'm gonna go talk to her.
Count me down. You should go talk to her.

58
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,396
Yeah, you should.

59
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,106
5, 4,
3, 2, 1.

60
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,691
Boom.

61
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,318
Have fun.

62
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,030
20 bucks says
he fucks it up.

63
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,203
Incoming.

64
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,539
Hi, excuse me. Listen,
I don't want to beat around the bush.

65
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,582
I think you're absolutely gorgeous.
My name's David.

66
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,125
Hi, David. Elizabeth.
Nice to meet you.

67
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,502
Elizabeth. That's
a beautiful name.

68
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,045
Hi, I'm David.
I don't mean to be rude. Loren.

69
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,255
Hi, how are you? David.
Nice to meet you.

70
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,339
Rachel.

71
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,883
Listen, can I buy you a drink?
Can I buy you all drinks?

72
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,218
Sure. Why not?
I would love that.

73
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,053
That would be my pleasure.
What are you guys drinking?

74
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,972
Well, we were thinking shots.
You were thinking shots?

75
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,307
We just did shots of tequila.
Would you guys like a shot of tequila?

76
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,684
Bring it on.
Love it.

77
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,937
Excuse me. Bartender?
Can we get 4 shots of your finest tequila?

78
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,022
Thank you very much.

79
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,191
I can see you're
very successful.

80
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,278
I think part of the secret to my success
is attention to detail.

81
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,362
Detail?

82
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,405
Play the game.

83
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,489
What game?

84
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,740
Okay.
Blue or green?

85
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,409
I like games.
I like this game.

86
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,412
Blue. Green.
Green, it's green.

87
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,871
That's brown.
Wow, wow!

88
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,790
I don't know how you
change the color of your eyes like that.

89
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,001
How do you do that so quickly?
That's amazing. That's a real talent.

90
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,711
Detail man.
Hey, buddy.

91
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,672
This guy, right here,
fucking nailed it today.

92
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,300
I want you to know you fucking nailed it.
You're the man.

93
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,760
Your pitch, amazing. Listen,
we're playing a game here.

94
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,178
Close your eyes again.
Blue or green?

95
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,140
Brown.
Fuck off.

96
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,350
All right. You, Loren,
close your eyes.

97
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,352
Blue.
Blue.

98
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,437
You're just making that up.
See? He's good.

99
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,272
He's just picking
colors randomly.

100
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,315
You can have
his shot.

101
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,442
Excuse me. We need
another shot, please.

102
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,321
You can put
these on me.

103
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,448
No, I told you,
I had it.

104
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,574
No, I have it.

105
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,117
I'll get the next round.
Sure.

106
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,952
You're a strong, independent woman.
I like that.

107
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,830
Thank you. Cheers.
To nailing it...

108
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:57,956
To nailing it.
To nailing it.

109
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,041
To nailing it.
...and to success.

110
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,125
Yes.

111
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,337
Mmm!

112
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,713
I love that.

113
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,715
Oh, fuck.

114
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,216
Whoa!

115
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,968
So what do you
girls do for fun?

116
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,553
Fun? Karate.

117
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,391
You hear this song?
I love this song, I wrote this song,

118
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,976
I would love it
if you would dance with me

119
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,728
to this song
that I wrote for you.

120
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,397
Come on. Let's go on the dance floor.
One song.

121
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,359
Yeah, come on.
You're a fun girl. It'll be fun.

122
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,070
I'll bring her back.
Swear to God. Come on, come on, it's fun.

123
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:33,700
Toe to toe
Dancing very close

124
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,661
Spinning, spinning,
spinning...

125
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:36,870
Whoo!

126
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,540
I'm grabbing her purse
'cause she's gonna get robbed and roofied.

127
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,042
Dance?
No.

128
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,169
Are you sure? Okay.
I'm sure.

129
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,174
Wall to wall

130
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,595
People hypnotized

131
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,226
And they're stepping lightly

132
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,689
Hang each night in

133
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,942
Rapture

134
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,152
Okay, okay,
okay! Hold on.

135
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,196
I just gotta talk
to you one more time.

136
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,781
Listen, your eyes,
they're beautiful.

137
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,157
You know why I didn't get it
right the first time?

138
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,368
Because it's like a collage.
Let me see them again.

139
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,161
Look at those eyes.
I know the color of your eyes!

140
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,204
David! Come on!

141
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,372
Come on,
we love that game.

142
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,915
That's so much fun.

143
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,668
It's okay, 'cause
I'm going this way.

144
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,420
Hey, man,
he's going uptown.

145
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,053
Come on.

146
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:42,936
Okay.

147
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,730
I'll see you tomorrow.

148
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,498
Hey. Want a ride?

149
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,209
Sure.

150
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:46,226
I want your love
I want your love

151
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:53,358
I want your love
I want...

152
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:54,901
I'll fucking kill you!

153
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,988
What the fuck?

154
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,698
Ow! Fuck!

155
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,157
Jesus Christ, Sissy!

156
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,869
Fuck! Brandon,
don't you fucking knock?

157
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,829
What the fuck?
Why would I knock? I live here!

158
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,122
Oh, fuck!

159
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,206
How'd you get in?

160
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,000
You gave me
fucking keys.

161
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,628
Fuck.

162
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,593
You fucking scared me.

163
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,678
Don't I always say
call me first if you're coming into town?

164
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,264
Oh, my God!
I called you so many times.

165
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,561
You have a fucking
baseball bat?

166
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,229
Yeah.

167
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:34,983
Hmm.

168
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:39,112
What is this shit you put in your hair?
Honestly, it's awful.

169
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,238
Shampoo.

170
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,948
Is it for grooming dogs?

171
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:46,077
I want your love
I want your love

172
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,331
Good to see you.

173
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,918
I want your love
I want your love

174
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,711
Lock the door next time.
Yeah.

175
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,879
Don't use all the towels.

176
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,005
I won't.

177
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:19,778
I want your love
I want your love

178
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,394
But I want you.

179
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,273
I don't want anyone else.
There is no one else.

180
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,903
I love you.
I'll do anything.

181
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,031
I'll do anything.

182
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:15,333
Please don't say that.

183
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:19,546
I love you.
I love you.

184
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,550
I'll do anything.
I'll do anything.

185
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,430
I don't have to go out!
I don't have to go out!

186
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,765
I don't even fucking
want to go out!

187
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,227
I can stay with you.
I don't care. I don't care.

188
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:38,356
I don't need anybody else.
I love you.

189
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:43,445
I love you. I love you so much.
I love you, please.

190
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,364
I love you.
I love you.

191
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,450
Please.

192
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:53,955
I feel sick.
I feel really sick.

193
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,591
Morning.
Morning.

194
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,052
Nice earring.
Hot date?

195
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:11,890
Juice?

196
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,016
Mmm!

197
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,981
Will you use a glass?

198
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,816
Sorry.

199
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,495
You're going gray.

200
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:43,963
Do you think
I look fat?

201
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:45,840
Sit down.

202
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,718
Fuck you!

203
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,435
I'm doing
a couple gigs.

204
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,395
Yeah. Sure.

205
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,233
Can I stay?

206
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,236
You want toast?

207
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,946
Just for a few days?

208
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,990
I'd stay with Mark,
but he's being a fucking asshole.

209
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,701
Mark?
Please.

210
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,040
Jesus, Sissy.

211
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,668
What do you expect?

212
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:24,963
Pretty please?

213
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,215
Look, you get the sofa
and you get your ass off it

214
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,842
before I leave
every morning.

215
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,760
I will. I promise.
I will.

216
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,263
Okay. Okay. Okay.

217
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,307
We leave in 15.

218
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,725
Okay!

219
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,069
Mmm! So good!

220
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:06,129
Stop fucking around.

221
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,344
Leave it.
You have fluff.

222
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,471
I like it there.

223
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,695
How are you for money?
I'm good.

224
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,655
'Cause if you need some money...
Honestly,

225
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,200
I even make money
now and everything.

226
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,410
Yeah, sure.

227
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,870
Huge amounts.

228
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:41,539
What, you collect
it in that hat?

229
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,419
You should come
and hear me.

230
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,046
Yeah, I will.

231
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,130
"Yeah, I will"?

232
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,507
Like, "Yeah, I will,"
like last time?

233
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,596
Please come.

234
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,264
Where'd you get
this, anyway?

235
00:25:58,349 --> 00:25:59,933
It's vintage.

236
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,017
Yeah,
I can see that.

237
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,481
Wow.

238
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,565
Do you like?

239
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,650
Yeah.

240
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,489
Please come.

241
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,577
Okay, I will.

242
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,082
Yay.

243
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,796
Sorry.

244
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,258
Fuck, my computer.

245
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,093
Well, well, well.

246
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,427
Morning, asshole.

247
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,763
Look who's decided
to grace us with his presence.

248
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,931
Yeah.

249
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,516
Don't tell me.
No cabs.

250
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,643
No, your wife wouldn't let me
leave this morning.

251
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,229
Hey. That's not cool.

252
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,775
You should be so lucky.

253
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,985
Any calls?

254
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,362
Yes. Like, 50.

255
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,953
Hey! Heads up, buddy.
Whoa!

256
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,414
So, how'd it
go last night?

257
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,751
Got home, went to bed.
Good night.

258
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,378
Uh-huh. Right, right.

259
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,173
Let's do it again tonight.
Some place classier, though.

260
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,801
Yeah, my sister's playing
downtown somewhere.

261
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,594
She's playing?

262
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,514
She's a musician.
Well, she's a singer.

263
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:25,143
Okay. Yeah, yeah.
You know what? That sounds like a lot of fun.

264
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,562
And that will
ruin your enamel.

265
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:43,619
That elevator music's
like a bad acid trip.

266
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:44,662
Good evening.

267
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:45,747
Evening.

268
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,124
Reservation. Sullivan?

269
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:52,503
Great. I have you on the list.
I'll have you follow me?

270
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,047
Thank you.

271
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,507
There you are.

272
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,217
Right this way, please.

273
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,808
Wow, look at that ass.
I could follow that forever.

274
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,102
Nice pick.

275
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,524
Oh!

276
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,569
I forget how
beautiful the city is.

277
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,571
Thank you.

278
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:27,163
Hi, guys. How are you both doing tonight?
What can I get you?

279
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,333
Your accent.
Are you... You're from...

280
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,709
Brazil.

281
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,544
Rio? Hmm?

282
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,129
Sao Paulo.
Oh!

283
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,548
That is a beautiful city.
That's...

284
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:38,591
You've been there?

285
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,385
Once or twice.

286
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,387
Can we get two
dry martinis with olives?

287
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,554
Mmm-hmm.

288
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,682
And a little bit later,
why don't you come by for a drink with us?

289
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,768
I'll make sure
I get those drinks.

290
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,269
Thank you.
Thanks.

291
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,607
She would be
so offended if I didn't try.

292
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,484
Unbelievable.

293
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:12,333
Start spreading the news

294
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,470
I'm leaving today

295
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:35,398
I wanna be a part of it

296
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:47,535
New York

297
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:57,545
I wanna wake up in a city

298
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:06,554
That doesn't sleep

299
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:15,021
And find
I'm king of the hill

300
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:22,862
Top of the heap

301
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:33,414
These vagabond shoes

302
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:45,009
Are longing to stray

303
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:52,683
Right through
the very heart of it

304
00:30:54,478 --> 00:31:01,442
New York, New York

305
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:11,911
If I can make it there

306
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:17,041
I'll make it

307
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:22,129
Anywhere

308
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:28,469
It's up to you

309
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:37,311
New York, New York

310
00:31:53,662 --> 00:32:00,585
I wanna wake up in a city

311
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:07,133
That doesn't sleep

312
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:14,765
And find
I'm king of the hill

313
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,560
Head of the list

314
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,229
Cream of the crop

315
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:26,402
At the top of the heap

316
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:38,831
These little town blues

317
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:49,717
Are melting away

318
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:58,392
I'll make
a brand new start of it

319
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:06,984
In old New York

320
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:17,411
If I can make it there

321
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:23,000
I'll make it

322
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:28,422
Anywhere

323
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:36,931
It's up to you

324
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:50,361
New York

325
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:57,618
Wow. Wow! Bravo!

326
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,791
She's good!
She's good!

327
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,716
Hi.
Hi.

328
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,300
I'm David.
Sissy.

329
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:14,927
It is a pleasure to meet you.
Nice to meet...

330
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,345
I think you are
absolutely fantastic

331
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,680
and you look great
in the dress, too.

332
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:18,764
Please, sit down.

333
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,099
Thank you.

334
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,810
What did you think?

335
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,688
Yeah, it was interesting.

336
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,314
What do you mean?

337
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,233
No, it was...

338
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:32,319
It was good.
It was good.

339
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,238
It was good?

340
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,241
He was crying.
He was crying.

341
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,617
There were tears
coming down his face.

342
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,828
I saw it. You made
a grown man cry.

343
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:41,912
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

344
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,414
I'm gonna
get some drinks.

345
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,625
That's a great idea.
Why don't you get a round for the table, buddy?

346
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:53,340
Okay. I'm really
sorry about that.

347
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:56,552
He's had a rough day at work.
I think he's a little bit emotional right now.

348
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,095
Yeah.
Yeah.

349
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,555
So you guys
grew up in Jersey?

350
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,598
Yeah.

351
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,183
You still live there?
God, no.

352
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,810
That's good. That's good.
Where do you live now?

353
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,103
Kind of all
over the place.

354
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:07,354
Yeah?

355
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,190
What's the last city
you've been to?

356
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,316
L.A.

357
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,817
Los Angeles?
Mmm-hmm.

358
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,068
Oh, boy.
You like it there?

359
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,111
I mean,
I'm going back.

360
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,488
That must mean
you love it then, huh?

361
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,573
No! I can't even
fucking drive.

362
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,283
Wait a minute.
You can't drive? It's a nightmare.

363
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,868
Nope.
Why not?

364
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,621
I tried when I was a kid
and I was horrible.

365
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,414
Wait, how old were you
when you quit driving?

366
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,291
16.
You were 16 years old?

367
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,459
Mmm-hmm.

368
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,629
So, wait a minute.
How do you get along in Los Angeles?

369
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:32,755
I take the bus.

370
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,089
No. No, no, no.

371
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:37,259
Look, a girl like you
cannot be taking the bus.

372
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,344
What happened
to your arm here?

373
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,470
Oh!

374
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,472
When I was a kid,
I was bored.

375
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,681
You must have been
really bored.

376
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,141
I was.

377
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,976
All right,
we've got a problem.

378
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,770
Your sister cannot be
taking the bus anywhere, okay?

379
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,313
I know a guy who owns
a car rental company.

380
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,232
We're gonna get you a car,
we're gonna drive around in circles

381
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,150
in a parking lot and you are going to
learn how to drive.

382
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:54,485
Not stick, automatic.
It's a little easier.

383
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,528
I would love that.

384
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,196
You'd love that. That's good.
You know what? Better yet,

385
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,031
we're gonna get
you a golf cart

386
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,658
and you will drive
the golf cart around.

387
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,536
Wow. Now we're talking.
Everybody should drive golf carts.

388
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,037
A golf cart right up
Fifth Avenue, huh?

389
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,040
You know, they should.
They should.

390
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,291
It would be a lot
cleaner and greener.

391
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,669
It would be great for the city.
Brandon,  what do you think?

392
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,462
Sounds great.
Yeah?

393
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:18,259
I love your brother.
What an amazing man.

394
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,762
How long are you here for?
I don't know.

395
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,514
You don't know?

396
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:29,812
Can I see you again? Please?
Is that too forward? I find you fascinating.

397
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,857
I really do.
I think you're a fascinating creature.

398
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,358
I'd love to see you again.
Listen, why don't we...

399
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,026
This is a celebration,
let's get champagne.

400
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,528
Yes! Champagne!
Champagne for everybody.

401
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,863
The whole table!
Come on.

402
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:39,947
Champagne.

403
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,506
I've got it, I've got it.
Get out, get out, get out.

404
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,049
Come here,
come here, come here.

405
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,301
No!

406
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,511
Come on,
come on with me.

407
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,054
Get off. Get off.
How did that work?

408
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,264
Get off me.

409
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,682
Come on, come on.

410
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,514
Champagne on
your dress, that's...

411
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,558
Well,
I'm hot, I'm hot.

412
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:50,768
You are hot.

413
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,527
You are?

414
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,592
No!
You're crushing me.

415
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,472
I need to take this off.
I'm hot.

416
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,058
I need to take it off.
I'm hot.

417
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,686
Nice sheets.

418
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:39,066
Aren't they nice sheets?
Bed Bath & Beyond.

419
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,406
Stop.

420
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:52,162
What if I kiss you
right here?

421
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,174
How about here?

422
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,353
Yeah?

423
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,646
Shit.

424
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,860
Mmm-hmm.

425
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,325
What?

426
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,704
Stop talking!

427
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,755
I have to be up
and out by 7:00.

428
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,840
It's cold.

429
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:45,896
Sissy,
get out of my room.

430
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:51,151
Get the fuck out!
Get out!

431
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:06,333
Hey, slacker.
Your computer's back.

432
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:27,521
Dave's looking for you.

433
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:32,109
Yeah. It was
really great last night.

434
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,193
Daddy, Daddy.

435
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:35,529
Listen, I gotta go, okay?
Thanks for calling.

436
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,658
Hey, buddy. Listen,
we said an hour French,

437
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,034
and then Isobel's
gonna pick you up

438
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,452
because Mommy's
picking up Nathan.

439
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,121
All right?
You can go after.

440
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:46,623
Yeah, I know,
but Mommy says I can't.

441
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:49,167
Okay. Well,
let's go talk to Mommy. Hmm?

442
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:52,170
She's all the way
downstairs.

443
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:53,463
Well, go downstairs
and tell her

444
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:56,466
that Daddy said
it's okay for you to go to Jason's.

445
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,428
Huh? Come on.
How about that? Do it.

446
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,305
You can do it. Get up.
Okay.

447
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,098
Yeah.

448
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,143
Mommy? Mommy?

449
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,146
What's up, man?

450
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,397
Steven said
you wanted to see me.

451
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:11,690
Yes.

452
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,734
Dude, 9:00 this morning,
where were you?

453
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,195
Dentist. Root canal.
Oh, shit.

454
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,531
Now, what did I tell you about that?
Who did you see?

455
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,868
Gary Sher, King's practice,
West 57th Street.

456
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:26,163
Good. Good. You're stinging
the company health plan, I hope, right?

457
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,165
Sure. That's what
it's there for, man.

458
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:29,875
All right, brother.

459
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,878
Listen, one more thing.

460
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,507
Your hard drive is filthy, all right?
We got your computer back.

461
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,926
I mean, it is dirty.

462
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,638
I'm talking like hoes,
sluts, anal, double anal,

463
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:45,724
penetration,
interracial facial, man.

464
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,393
Cream pie...
I don't even know what that is.

465
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:53,940
You think
it was your intern?

466
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,525
On my hard drive?

467
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,736
Yeah, someone's fucking
with your account, man.

468
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:01,114
And we're blowing
our wad in cash, you know?

469
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,868
It takes a really, really
sick fuck to spend all day on that shit.

470
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,703
Daddy, Daddy.

471
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:08,789
Yeah. Hey, buddy.
What'd she say?

472
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,499
She said I can go
to Jason's for a half hour,

473
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,292
but I have to be home
by 5:00 for dinner.

474
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:14,795
Okay. That's great. See?
Best of both worlds.

475
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,296
You got everything
you want. You happy?

476
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:17,547
Yup. Yup.

477
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,216
Yeah. You better be.
Get out of here.

478
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:20,967
Okay.
All right, see you.

479
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,861
Hey. You like your sugar?

480
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:42,823
I do.

481
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,596
Hey.

482
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,140
Hello.
Hello.

483
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:33,850
Did you find it okay?

484
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:36,478
Yes, I'm glad
you made it.

485
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:38,605
Yeah?

486
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:44,152
I'm late. Sorry.

487
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:48,198
You look handsome.

488
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,075
You look amazing.
Hi.

489
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:52,869
Thank you.
How are you doing tonight?

490
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,621
Thank you.
Okay.

491
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:58,250
I have a few specials on the menu,
if you'd like to hear them?

492
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,501
Sure.

493
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:03,797
The soup of the day is
tomato with basil oil and parmesan crostini.

494
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,258
The special is
marinated swordfish,

495
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,510
tabouleh and
Moroccan charmoula.

496
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,886
It's really good.

497
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:12,097
We're also serving
a DeBragga and Spitler

498
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,349
New York Strip with
a side order of fries,

499
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:18,019
and the salad is snow pea and radish
with a cider vinaigrette.

500
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,773
Can I start you off
with a sparkling water?

501
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,400
Tap water's fine.
Okay.

502
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:26,236
And the wine menu is right next to...
Yup, there you go.

503
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,071
You want some wine?
Sure.

504
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,490
White? Red?

505
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,576
Red. Maybe...

506
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,203
Pinot Noir is light,

507
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,709
if you like it,
like, light.

508
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:43,378
Great.

509
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,755
Okay. I'll be back.

510
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,930
So...

511
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,849
Where do you live?

512
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,183
Brooklyn.

513
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,435
Nice.

514
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:01,688
Born and raised.
Where you from?

515
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:06,901
I was born in Ireland
and we moved here when I was a teen.

516
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:09,070
Did you get back much?
Thank you.

517
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:10,739
A couple times.

518
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,867
A big family?
You miss them?

519
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,368
Uh...

520
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,579
I have a sister.

521
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,584
I have two.

522
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:23,627
Oh, yeah?

523
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,794
Yeah.

524
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,838
Older? Younger?

525
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,506
Older and younger.

526
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,508
I'm right
in the middle.

527
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:37,891
What?

528
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:38,975
Just wondering.

529
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,520
Are you nervous?

530
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:43,813
Why would I
be nervous?

531
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,315
You look
a little nervous.

532
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,733
Do I?

533
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,485
No.

534
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:49,653
Well, what's a date?

535
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,321
It's no big deal.

536
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,742
It took me an hour
to figure out what to wear.

537
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,162
You chose wisely.

538
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,246
Yeah.

539
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:04,584
I'm sorry, but I forgot to say
the crab comes in the shell.

540
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,045
Great.

541
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:13,009
Oh! Yeah. I haven't
even looked at this.

542
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:14,344
I'll have the lamb.

543
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,387
The lamb.

544
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:17,681
I'll have the lamb, too.
That sounds great.

545
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,225
Okay.
No appetizer?

546
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,936
I'm fine.
No.

547
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,313
Okay. And how would
you like the lamb?

548
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:26,898
Medium.

549
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,818
We recommend it
pretty pink.

550
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,029
Okay.
Yeah?

551
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:36,533
Okay. Pink it is.

552
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:41,121
Thank you.
Excuse me.

553
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,710
So you seeing anyone
at the moment?

554
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,087
No, I'm not.
Are you seeing anyone?

555
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,880
No.

556
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,340
No? Really?

557
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:56,970
Why is that?

558
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,514
I don't know.
It's just the way it is.

559
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,100
It's just the way it is.
Yeah, I...

560
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:06,646
Actually, I'm separated.

561
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:09,524
Tragedy.

562
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,984
Yeah.
Kind of a recent thing.

563
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:13,653
Okay.

564
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,781
You were
married for long?

565
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,075
No.

566
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,035
Did we decide
on the wine?

567
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:25,540
Well, yeah. Was it the
Pinot Noir, you said?

568
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,293
Yeah, great.
Great choice. Okay.

569
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,882
I wasn't married long.
Gave it a shot. It didn't really work out.

570
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,467
No.

571
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,510
Wow.
What?

572
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:38,928
You just seem, like...

573
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,013
What?

574
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,723
Averse to
the whole idea.

575
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,016
Well, yeah.

576
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,769
I just don't understand
why people would want to get married.

577
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:49,814
Especially nowadays,
I mean, it's... You know?

578
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,442
I don't see the point.

579
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,195
In relationships?

580
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:57,781
It doesn't
seem realistic.

581
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:03,703
Are you serious?
I mean...

582
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:05,538
Yeah. I am, really.

583
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,791
Well, then, you know,
why are we here,

584
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,502
if we don't matter
to one another?

585
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:11,586
Well...

586
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,754
Why are you here?

587
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,882
The food is supposed to be
great here.

588
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,760
No, no, no.
I'm not saying it like that.

589
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,179
I mean...
I just mean... You know?

590
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:25,350
One person for the rest of your life?
I mean, it's...

591
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,144
I mean, you come
to restaurants,

592
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:30,230
you see couples
sitting together,

593
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,981
and they don't even
speak to one another,

594
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,817
they don't have
anything to say.

595
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:37,737
They probably don't
have to speak because they're connected.

596
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:41,157
Or they're just bored
with one another.

597
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:43,326
Every...

598
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,911
Here we go.

599
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,582
What's your
longest relationship?

600
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,501
Um...

601
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,255
Exactly.

602
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,006
That's...
You can pour.

603
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:58,091
Sure.

604
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,595
4 months.

605
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:10,937
You have to commit.
You have to actually give it a shot.

606
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,191
I did.
For 4 months.

607
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:17,360
For 4 months.

608
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,842
Thank you.

609
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,305
Look, touch that.

610
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:47,849
Your head?

611
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,476
No, no, no.

612
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,687
You're such a weirdo.

613
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:56,149
No, seriously, seriously,
seriously. Touch it.

614
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,902
Okay.

615
00:53:58,986 --> 00:53:59,986
Oh, my God.

616
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,362
Do you feel that?

617
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:02,906
Yeah, what is it?

618
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,824
It's a remnant.
A remnant?

619
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:07,785
Yeah, from
the Neanderthals.

620
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,455
There's only a few of us left since the
Homo sapiens took over.

621
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:11,539
Okay.

622
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:12,916
Hmm.

623
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,418
That would explain
the forehead.

624
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,461
What's that
supposed to mean?

625
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:17,545
"What's that
supposed to mean?"

626
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:18,755
What do you mean?

627
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:23,051
Seriously, how did you get it?
What is it?

628
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,302
I used to play this
game with my cousin...

629
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,386
Mmm-hmm.

630
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:28,681
...where I'd sit on his feet
and he'd fly me through the air.

631
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:31,726
I hit my head off the ceiling
and I blacked out.

632
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,270
I was knocked out
for 5 or 10 minutes.

633
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:35,772
I peed my pants.

634
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:36,856
Oh!

635
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:46,908
If you had a choice
to live in the past or the future,

636
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,118
and you could be
anything you wanted to be,

637
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:50,870
what would you be?

638
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,082
What would you be?

639
00:54:56,377 --> 00:55:00,213
Well, I always wanted to be a
musician in the '60s.

640
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,674
That's cool.
A musician?

641
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,092
Yeah.

642
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:05,802
'60s is tough, though.

643
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,929
I saw Gimme Shelter
recently, you know,

644
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,973
the Rolling Stones
documentary?

645
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:11,057
Yeah.

646
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,350
It kind of
seemed like hell.

647
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:13,685
What?

648
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:17,355
Yeah, the '60s would be,
like, the last place I would want to be.

649
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,439
No way!

650
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:19,524
Yes.

651
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,026
Ugh! Chaos!

652
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:25,488
So where and what
would you wanna be?

653
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,656
Um...

654
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,119
You know, here, now.

655
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:35,623
That's boring.

656
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:36,666
Fuck you.

657
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,638
Okay. Well,
this is me.

658
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:51,723
This is you?

659
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,141
This is me.

660
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,353
Thank you very much,
Brandon.

661
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,523
Thank you very much,
Marianne.

662
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:06,029
We should
do this again.

663
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,790
Right.

664
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:26,507
So is that a yes?

665
00:56:28,177 --> 00:56:29,927
Maybe, yeah.

666
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,568
Hello? Sissy?

667
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,029
Oh, fuck!

668
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,532
Fuck!

669
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:39,914
Fuck!

670
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:41,874
What, are you
fucking spying on me?

671
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,376
Lock the fucking
door, Brandon.

672
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,460
Are you fucking spying?

673
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:45,837
"Are you fucking spying?"

674
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:48,589
Fuck! Brandon...
What do you want?

675
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:50,466
You wanna fight?
You wanna fight?

676
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:52,426
You wanna fight?
You want some of this?

677
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:53,761
What do you want from me?

678
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:55,096
What do you want from me?
Brandon!

679
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,264
What do you want?
Get off me!

680
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:57,515
Why did you
come here? Why?

681
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,599
Get off me!
Get off me!

682
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,226
Why? Why?
Get off me!

683
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,477
You're fucking
hurting me.

684
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:02,812
Talk to me!
Fucking bitch!

685
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,189
Get the fuck off,
you fucking weirdo.

686
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:06,899
Fucking slut!
Fuck you! Fuck you!

687
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,463
Brandon?

688
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:33,092
Brandon, I'm sorry.

689
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:53,112
Hey,
where's Brandon?

690
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,657
Are you Brandon's
girlfriend?

691
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,785
Do you wanna play?

692
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,623
You wanna play
with my tits?

693
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,959
I know Brandon
would really like it,

694
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:12,131
and I know exactly
what Brandon likes.

695
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:05,536
Come on.

696
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,839
Where are you
taking me?

697
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,758
Come on.
You'll see.

698
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,718
No, where
are we going?

699
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,011
Come on.

700
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,435
You want a drink?

701
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:37,818
What are you
looking at?

702
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,530
This view
is amazing.

703
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:51,999
Hey.

704
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,739
Are they vintage?

705
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:49,325
A little bit.

706
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:51,577
I love it.

707
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:17,454
Oh, yeah.

708
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,924
Brandon?

709
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,896
You know, it's cool.
It's okay.

710
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:29,652
Should I go?

711
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,278
Sure.

712
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,029
I can walk you down.

713
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,451
That's okay.

714
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:01,386
Can I
get you a drink?

715
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,890
No.

716
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:13,774
Fuck.

717
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,359
Need a hand?

718
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:18,237
No. The hook's odd.

719
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:22,908
There you go.

720
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:55,941
David?

721
01:09:57,861 --> 01:09:59,444
Pick up.

722
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,866
I take it you're at your
pottery class.

723
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:14,543
Have you eaten?

724
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:16,920
No.

725
01:10:17,005 --> 01:10:18,547
Are you hungry?

726
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,173
No.

727
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,649
Can you just
give me a hug?

728
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,679
He's not gonna
screw you again.

729
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:14,353
You left him a message,
didn't you?

730
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:17,814
You can't help yourself.

731
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:20,275
It's disgusting.

732
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:24,237
Why are you
so fucking angry?

733
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:29,368
Why am I
so fucking angry?

734
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,872
That's my boss.

735
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:39,670
You sleep with him after 20 minutes.
Now you're calling him up.

736
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,382
What's the matter with you?

737
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,594
You know he's got
a family, right?

738
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:50,305
You know
he's got a family?

739
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,473
No.

740
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:54,184
You didn't see
the wedding ring on his finger?

741
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:55,727
No.

742
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:57,312
You're a liar.

743
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:01,900
I'm sorry.

744
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:08,490
You're always sorry.
That's all you ever fucking say.

745
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:10,909
Well, at least
I say I'm sorry.

746
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:13,996
Try doing something.

747
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:17,082
Actions count,
not words.

748
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:23,714
I'm sorry.

749
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:27,092
I fucked up.

750
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:32,389
I'm not perfect.
I make mistakes, but I'm trying.

751
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,852
Some people
fuck up all the time.

752
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:45,986
Look, just forget it.

753
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:51,324
This isn't working out.
Obviously.

754
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,079
You need to find
somewhere else to live.

755
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:59,124
I don't have
anywhere else to go.

756
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,506
This isn't about him.

757
01:13:08,176 --> 01:13:11,803
I make you angry all the time and
I don't know why.

758
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:16,600
No. You trap me.

759
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:22,064
You force me into a corner
and you trap me.

760
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,193
"I've got
nowhere else to go."

761
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,862
I mean, what sort of
fucking shit is that?

762
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,405
You're my brother.

763
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:32,824
So what?
I'm responsible for you?

764
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:33,909
Yes.

765
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:35,368
No, I'm not.
Yes, you fucking are.

766
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,661
No, I didn't
give birth to you.

767
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,372
I didn't bring you
into this world.

768
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:42,417
You're my brother,
I'm your sister. We're family.

769
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:43,752
We're meant to look
after each other.

770
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:44,836
You're not
looking after me.

771
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,171
I'm looking
after myself.

772
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:47,756
I'm trying.
I'm trying to help you.

773
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,259
How are you helping me, huh?
How are you helping me?

774
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,428
How are you helping me?

775
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,432
Huh? Look at me.
How are you helping me?

776
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:02,395
You come in here
and you're a weight on me.

777
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,731
Do you understand me?
You're a burden.

778
01:14:04,816 --> 01:14:07,400
You're just fucking
dragging me down.

779
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,820
How are you helping me?

780
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:12,489
You can't even
clean up after yourself.

781
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:16,868
Stop playing the victim.

782
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:19,496
I'm not playing
the fucking victim.

783
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:22,874
If I left, I would never
hear from you again.

784
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:29,214
Don't you think
that's sad?

785
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,885
You're my brother.

786
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:44,271
Why is it always
so dramatic with you?

787
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:45,981
Everything is always
the end of the world.

788
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:49,651
It's not fucking dramatic.
I'm trying to talk to you.

789
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,571
I don't wanna talk.

790
01:14:55,741 --> 01:15:00,704
Try not talking.
Try just listening or thinking for a change.

791
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:03,999
Yeah, 'cause that's working great for you.
You're completely fine.

792
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:05,333
I've got my own
fucking apartment.

793
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:07,210
Oh, whoopee-fucking shit.

794
01:15:07,295 --> 01:15:09,337
You have your own apartment,
that's amazing.

795
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:11,798
You have a job and an apartment.
I should be in awe of you.

796
01:15:11,883 --> 01:15:14,384
Well, at least
I'm responsible for it.

797
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,761
At least I don't
depend on people all the time.

798
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:18,471
You're a dependency.
You're a parasite.

799
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:19,764
You don't have anybody.

800
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:22,893
You don't have anybody.
You have me and your fucking pervert boss.

801
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:25,979
You slept with that fucking pervert boss.
What does that make you?

802
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:29,566
Don't talk to me about sex life, Brandon.
Not from you.

803
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,654
Whatever.

804
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,866
I'm going out.

805
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,576
Great. And then
you'll come back

806
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,536
and we'll just have
the same fucking conversation again.

807
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:43,622
No, you'll move out.

808
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,959
And then I'll never
hear from you again?

809
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:07,163
Hey.

810
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:27,058
You wanna
get out of here?

811
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,895
I could take you
somewhere.

812
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,777
What, are you
with someone?

813
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:44,659
Does he
go down on you?

814
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:49,539
I do.

815
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:53,001
That's what
I like to do.

816
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:42,300
I like
the way it feels.

817
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:46,054
I like the way
it's just me and it.

818
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,269
I wanna taste you.

819
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:57,482
I wanna slip
my tongue inside you,

820
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:01,986
just as you come.

821
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:13,164
You want me
to make you come?

822
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:19,337
I can do that.
Want me to do that?

823
01:19:19,422 --> 01:19:21,172
What's up, babe?

824
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:24,426
I was just
getting some drinks.

825
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,635
Yeah, huh?

826
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:49,033
Whoa.

827
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:50,952
Not tonight, buddy.

828
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,623
I said not tonight.

829
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:11,139
I was just telling your
pretty girlfriend here,

830
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:14,142
I'd like to fuck her
in that tight pussy of hers.

831
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:16,311
I mean,
bone her real hard.

832
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:17,645
Till she's
clawing up my back.

833
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:18,938
He's kidding.

834
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:20,648
This guy's funny.

835
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:25,862
After I fuck her
hard up the ass,

836
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:29,657
I'll put my balls in her mouth
while I come in her face.

837
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:32,494
You won't let me
fuck you in the ass?

838
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:33,536
Christ.

839
01:20:33,621 --> 01:20:34,829
You get to fuck her
in the ass?

840
01:20:34,914 --> 01:20:35,914
You know.

841
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:38,750
Tell me more, man,
'cause I'm fucking loving this.

842
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,126
Smell it.
Yo!

843
01:20:40,211 --> 01:20:42,420
Jesus, come on.
You motherfucker.

844
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:53,806
Hey, Romeo.

845
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:22,205
Brandon, it's Sissy.

846
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:24,415
I really need to talk to you.

847
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:28,628
Please, will you
pick up the fucking phone?

848
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,102
Brandon, I need you.

849
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:52,652
We're not bad people.

850
01:23:57,783 --> 01:24:00,952
We just come
from a bad place.

851
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:05,331
Thanks for letting me stay.

852
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:33,331
Ladies and gentlemen,

853
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:37,251
at this time, due to
a police investigation,

854
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:40,004
we have to discharge
this train.

855
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:44,133
Please follow the conductor
to the rear of the train.

856
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:46,427
Watch your step
between cars.

857
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:48,554
Watch your step.

858
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:51,307
Follow me, please.
Follow me.

859
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:57,271
Watch your step.
This way. This way. Quickly.

860
01:27:57,356 --> 01:27:58,689
This way.
Nothing to see. Move on.

861
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:00,399
Right this way, please.

862
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:10,326
This is Sissy.
Leave a message. Don't if you're an asshole.

863
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:20,419
This is Sissy. Leave a...

864
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:21,754
Shit!

865
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,629
Shithead.

866
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:01,635
God!
