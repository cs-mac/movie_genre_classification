1
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,878
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

2
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,750
Jehovah is not to blame
for all the evil doings.

3
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,590
Imagine a loving father
whose son or daughter moves away -

4
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,158
- and chooses to lead a bad life.
Is that their father's fault?

5
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,079
You're pulling my leg, little boy.

6
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,308
It says so in the Bible.
It also says Jehovah is love.

7
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,354
It does? I should have
read it after all, then.

8
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,757
It's written here
so even you understand it.

9
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,675
Why, so it is. Thank you.
Now I know what it's all about.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,278
Well done.
Thank you, August and Sara.

11
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,439
It's nice to hearJehovah's message
conveyed by such young people.

12
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,358
- Got you!
- Got you!

13
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,599
- Got you!
- Got you!

14
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,638
No tickling! No tickling!
Stop it.

15
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,837
WORLDS APART

16
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,712
I've talked to the elders about it.

17
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,118
They want to help us.

18
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,989
BASED ONATRUE STORY

19
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,237
Jehovah God, -

20
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,390
- watch over Mom and Dad,
Elisabeth and August... and Jonas.

21
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,635
I know that you protect me.
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

22
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,556
Sara and Thea, go through the
bookkeeping assignment next time.

23
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,194
I know I can count on you.

24
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,678
Happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you...

25
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,110
Thank you.

26
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,592
Hi, Sara.
Are you doing your homework?

27
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,189
Yes.

28
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,429
I want to talk to you
about something.

29
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,916
I've done something terribly wrong.

30
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,516
- What have you done?
- Now it's all falling apart.

31
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,990
But what have you done?

32
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,832
I was too weak.
I was tempted.

33
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,637
- Your father and I...
- Karen...

34
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,150
We can't reach an agreement -

35
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,239
- so I think
you should choose for yourselves.

36
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,754
- I don't think this is the right way.
- But I do.

37
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,032
All this is your father's fault
so we'll do it this way.

38
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,916
You have to choose between us. Who
gets to stay in the house with you.

39
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,795
Please forgive him. Can't you?

40
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,835
He does repent.

41
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,556
You can do anything you set
your mind to. You said so yourself.

42
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,309
Yes, but I can't.

43
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,118
Please leave.

44
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,995
Please leave the room.

45
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,112
Who do you choose?

46
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,319
- Dad did something very wrong.
- Yes.

47
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,038
But it's worse that Mom won't
forgive him even though he repents.

48
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,597
But what about Mom then?

49
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,514
We've decided that Dad should stay.

50
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:26,752
Our hearts go out to the outsiders who
are lost unless they accept Jehovah.

51
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,637
The last days are drawing near,
so devote all yourtime to preaching.

52
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,709
Every time you ring a doorbell, you
get a chance to save a human being.

53
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,471
Though the journey may be long

54
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,037
ourfear has been conquered

55
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,358
and the end is drawing near

56
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,678
you have found
yourflock of Witnesses

57
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,238
follow the King
follow his sword.

58
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,388
Only one local announcement today.

59
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,628
BrotherAndreas Dahl
is resigning as an elder.

60
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,196
Take this, will you?

61
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,155
You didn't bring the little bag?

62
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,069
I feel sorry for you.

63
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,989
We didn't understand why you couldn't
forgive him when he repented.

64
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,389
I think you should go down and help,
and remember the bag this time.

65
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,034
Mom...

66
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,232
- l'll cook dinner and tuck August in.
- Good, Sara.

67
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,908
- I need to talk to you.
- Can't it wait? I'm late as it is.

68
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,032
Jehovah will conquer death,
and in his Kingdom -

69
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,835
- all the dead will be reunited
with their loved ones.

70
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,718
Jesus will lead the heavenly armies.
Evil will be eliminated at Armageddon.

71
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,311
I pity the expelled.

72
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,235
You don't have to if they repent.

73
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,959
If they suffer, they will understand,
and then they repent and come back.

74
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,551
- And who will Jesus Christ eliminate?
- The evildoers.

75
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,513
Who'll be resurrected
in the New World?

76
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,475
All of us, even Grandma
and Grandpa. Dad said so.

77
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,757
Please tuck in August tonight.
I'm going over to Thea's.

78
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,839
Sara, what a nice surprise.

79
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,995
You baked me some cookies. Nice.
You've taken great pains.

80
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,149
- Is August asleep?
- Elisabeth is tucking him in.

81
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,873
Sara... I'm very sorry about what
happened between Mom and me.

82
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,389
I've let her down.

83
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,795
But I'm never going
to let any of you down.

84
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,072
You know how much I love you.

85
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,712
Can I leave Elisabeth and August
alone for a few hours?

86
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,675
- Are you going to Thea's?
- She's invited me to a party.

87
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,032
Some people from school
are having it.

88
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,598
It's at the club, but they only
let in people who've been invited.

89
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,918
It's like a private thing.

90
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:17,671
It's your choice, Sara.
I just don't think it's a good idea.

91
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,316
I won't stay out too late.

92
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,432
There are three kinds
of young Witnesses.

93
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,030
The 1's break all the rules.

94
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,549
The 2's try out stuff
without talking too much about it.

95
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,194
That's you.

96
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,110
And the 3's are the nerds.
They attend all the meetings, -

97
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,873
- drink tea with theirparents
and never do anything wrong.

98
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,835
That's me.

99
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,476
Soon to become a 2.

100
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,277
It's not that strong.

101
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,149
The guy with the sunglasses,
that's Kenneth.

102
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,272
We talked a lot online.

103
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,278
Hi. This is my friend Sara.

104
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,439
- Hi.
- Hi. Michael.

105
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,837
- Teis.
- Hi.

106
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,549
- I'm okay.
- Yeah, right.

107
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,754
Can't you be sick inside, Sara?

108
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,437
Ready to go back in?

109
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,760
- We can't go home already.
- L'll walk her home.

110
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:12,038
Is that okay?
Okay, l'll get her stuff.

111
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,795
- Man, this town is quiet.
- You afraid of the quiet?

112
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,835
- Wow, what a deep question.
- Forget it.

113
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,876
I hardly ever hear it...
or don't hear it. The quiet.

114
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,875
Thanks for walking me home.

115
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,470
- You live here?
- Just up the road.

116
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,754
I'd better go alone from here.
Thanks for a nice evening.

117
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,629
I promised Thea
to walk you to your doorstep.

118
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,037
Fuck, this is insane!

119
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,636
Come on.

120
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,274
Wait for me at the door.

121
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,871
My dad is at work but be quiet.
My brother and sister are asleep.

122
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,075
Here.

123
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,558
How did you know
pink was my favourite colour?

124
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,198
- Don't!
- Stand still.

125
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,990
Listen to this.

126
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,994
You don't have to like it
just because I was in on making it.

127
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,279
No?

128
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,436
I like this one.

129
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,035
- Sara... Sara?
- You'd better go.

130
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,279
- Sara, is that you?
- L'll be right up, August.

131
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,238
- Hi.
- Hi.

132
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,228
- I'd like to walk with Sara today.
- Yes.

133
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,633
Hi, sweetie.

134
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,799
We'll start at the far end
and work our way back.

135
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,831
I was home by one.

136
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,318
I hardly had anything to drink
and only danced with Thea.

137
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,233
It wasn't wild or anything.

138
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,031
You know what's right-

139
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,995
- but it'll keep you on
the right track to spread the word.

140
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,351
Teis is asking for you.

141
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,632
She's here now.

142
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,870
Is she okay?

143
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,518
- Answer him... Come on, Sara.
- No way.

144
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,794
The first thing he did
was ask foryou.

145
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,433
Make something up.

146
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,632
She says you're hot!

147
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,311
You idiot, Thea!

148
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,274
That was just Thea goofing around.
Hugs Sara.

149
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,991
Bummer.

150
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,152
Want to meet?
I could come visit you.

151
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,555
It's better I come to you.

152
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,752
Sara...!

153
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,868
Hi.

154
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,159
Hungry?

155
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,036
Coffee?

156
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:23,873
Mind if we just walk around?
I love it that nobody knows me here.

157
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,149
- What?
- My friends think I'm doing homework.

158
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,277
- How old are you anyway?
- Why?

159
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:49,033
Something about you seems older,
but I still think you're pretty young.

160
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,077
- You're pretty old, right?
- I just turned 23.

161
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,556
And still you hang out
with girls like us?

162
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,038
- I'm 17.
- Just turned 17?

163
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,518
- I don't celebrate birthdays.
- Why not?

164
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,397
- Hi, Sara.
- Hi, Jonas.

165
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,270
This is my olderbrother Jonas.
This is Teis, a friend of mine.

166
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,714
Hi.

167
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,149
I recognized you even with your
back turned. You sure have grown.

168
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:49,796
- Are you okay?
- Yes. I'm studying at the university.

169
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,916
How are the others?
Ls Elisabeth okay?

170
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,640
- Has August grown too?
- He's still a little boy.

171
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,551
Let me give you my new address.
I've moved around a bit.

172
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,833
Thanks.

173
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,516
Take care.

174
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,589
- When did you see him last?
- Ayear ago.

175
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,759
The rest of your family
don't see him either?

176
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,999
Why not? Why not?

177
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,038
- It's none of yourbusiness, is it?
- No, I guess not.

178
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,676
He didn't behave correctly.

179
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:06,558
- He read a wrong book.
- Okay. And you didn't like that book?

180
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,034
I'd sure like to read that.

181
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,030
He's expelled. That's why.

182
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,279
Expelled from what?

183
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,792
We're Jehovah's Witnesses.

184
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,356
- You're kidding me.
- No, it's true.

185
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,431
You're one of those who
come knocking and won't leave?

186
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,158
Lt's not worse than making music
or whatever it is you do, is it?

187
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,912
- You believe in that Doomsday crap?
- It's called Armageddon.

188
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,752
- It's a transition to a new world.
- Where everyone but you dies.

189
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,958
So I'm going to die?

190
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,591
Ls she going to die?

191
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,478
Unless she accepts Jehovah
as the one true god, yes, she is.

192
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,672
- Can I help you?
- What about her?

193
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,110
Stop it.

194
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,474
Is that child going to die? Say
the parents don't accept your truth.

195
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,515
Even if the child is too young
to understand, it's still doomed?

196
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,593
Sorry I'm late, but Thea and I
had some homework to do.

197
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,715
- You could've called.
- Yes, but I don't have a cell, do I?

198
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:07,199
- Normal phones have worked for ages.
- I don't like using Thea's phone.

199
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,309
Have you eaten?
L'll heat up something for you.

200
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,875
Thanks.

201
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,392
Have a nice evening. Bye.

202
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,995
We're closing up now.

203
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,519
Hi.

204
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,352
I'm sorry.

205
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,198
It wasn't fair of me
to knock your faith.

206
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,951
I probably should've
prepared you forit.

207
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,951
I know what it's like
to seek a meaning. I know.

208
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,996
- Are you meeting someone?
- No.

209
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:42,351
- How did you know where to find me?
- Thea told me you were at school.

210
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,837
- Want to see my dad?
- Is that a good idea?

211
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,476
As long as he doesn't see us.

212
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,509
- Which one of them is your dad?
- The receptionist.

213
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,757
Come on!

214
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,033
I have to babysit my brother
and sister now. Thanks for coming.

215
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,118
You're welcome.

216
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,471
I have to go.

217
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,434
- You're quite early.
- Hello, Mom.

218
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,030
Hi, sweetheart.

219
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,590
Is it a real TV?
Does it have a lot of channels?

220
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,874
- Dad only lets us have a VCR.
- It's not that dangerous.

221
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,952
- Hi.
- What's he doing here?

222
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:12,474
He was waiting on the steps. I didn't
have the heart to send him away.

223
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,515
- We have to go then.
- I was just leaving.

224
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,314
Take care, Mom.

225
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,717
It's best that you not
tell Dad about this.

226
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:01,315
- Hi. Did I wake you?
- I don't usually sleep this late.

227
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,512
Come on in.

228
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,708
I worked all day
and stayed up all night making music.

229
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,151
Coffee?

230
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,674
- Are these your parents?
- Yes.

231
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,919
- Are you an only child?
- Yes.

232
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,911
- That must be strange.
- It's all I've ever known.

233
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,678
There are four of us. We used to be
six until Jonas and Mom moved out.

234
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,395
I didn't think Jehovahs got divorced.

235
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,719
There are two ways
ofbreaking up a marriage.

236
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:02,233
- Death or sex with someone else.
- Tough choice.

237
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,310
- So sex is a no-no. What else?
- You don't want to hear.

238
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,035
I'm serious.

239
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:20,238
You can't join the army, vote,
smoke or celebrate birthdays.

240
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,513
You can't contradict the elders.
But sex is the worst thing.

241
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,077
- It's okay to party?
- Dance and drink in moderation, yes.

242
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,714
Just like you do.

243
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,714
Apart from that
you have to go to the meetings, -

244
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,118
- preach, read our church magazines
and go to more meetings.

245
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,553
- Why do you put up with it?
- That's the way it's always been.

246
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,756
Everybody knows everybody.
We have strong family ties.

247
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,112
As long as you don't
read the wrong books.

248
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,949
It wasn't just that.

249
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,594
- Jonas contradicted the elders.
- And that was enough?

250
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,156
Lf you persist.

251
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,388
And then you weren't
allowed to talk to him?

252
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,993
- Not even if you meet in the street?
- No, you pretend they're not there.

253
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,432
- Why?
- Because Jehovah sees everything.

254
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,873
- You talked to Jonas the other day.
- Only because you were there.

255
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,431
- It's so weird.
- What is?

256
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,234
You believe in God?

257
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,150
Lt's weirder
not to believe in anything.

258
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,115
- Cheers.
- We don't say "cheers" either.

259
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,511
Thanks.

260
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,840
So if your doctor can only save you
by giving you blood, you still say no?

261
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,511
- Even if you know you may die?
- Yes, if your faith is strong.

262
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,919
- But why?
- Jehovah says you can't take blood.

263
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,354
Shouldn't that be your own decision?

264
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,109
Lt is your own decision.

265
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,516
- You think I'm strange?
- You sure are.

266
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,314
But I like it.

267
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,350
Oh no, the last train leaves
in five minutes!

268
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,354
Fuck, I spend too much time
in front of my computer.

269
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,711
It's not the end of the world
if you sleep over.

270
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,959
Yes, that's exactly what it is.

271
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,439
- L'll wait for the morning train.
- I'm not leaving you here alone.

272
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,272
You can sleep on the bed,
and l'll sleep on the floor. Come on.

273
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,031
Do I have to carry you?

274
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,676
This floor sure is hard.

275
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,994
Yeah, it's not fair.

276
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,316
That didn't take you long.

277
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:10,834
I can lie next to a girl without
things getting out ofhand. Okay?

278
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,150
What if things got
just a little out of hand?

279
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,791
Good morning.

280
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,512
I have to get home before my dad.

281
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,868
L'll walk you to the station.

282
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,637
- Mona!
- That's my bed.

283
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:45,119
- You can't just barge in.
- It's my goddamn apartment!

284
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:54,638
Mona's my ex-girlfriend, okay? My ex.
It's her apartment.

285
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,118
She got another guy two months ago
but comes back whenever they fight.

286
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:03,791
- Keep me out of your mess.
- My mess? She screwed around.

287
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:23,030
You're so strange.
What is it you want, huh?

288
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:37,556
Think I'd have kissed you all night
if I weren't crazy about you?

289
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,114
Do you want to be together with me?
I mean it.

290
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,629
Is that a yes?

291
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,231
Let me have your cell.

292
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,592
Thea, you've got to help me.

293
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,590
I missed the train last night.
Can I say I slept at your place?

294
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,315
No, nothing happened.

295
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,912
I'm just laughing
because you sound so serious.

296
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,350
Okay, bye.

297
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,149
Sing and rejoice
praise Jehovah

298
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:50,357
etemal peace
awaits in his Paradise

299
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,237
preach to the world
that our King is great

300
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,594
in him we will find
etemal joy.

301
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:08,194
- Hi, Mom. How are you?
- I miss you all. But you look happy.

302
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,039
- I am.
- Good.

303
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,878
Sara, I want to talk to you. Sara.

304
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,239
- You heard me.
- Does it have to be right now?

305
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,912
- Yes, I'm afraid so.
- I have to do my homework.

306
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,792
Your socalled homework
will have to wait.

307
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,749
Please put down that brush
and sit down.

308
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:08,476
- Have you got something to tell me?
- No, what?

309
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,594
- I know you've got a boyfriend.
- That's not true. I don't.

310
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,031
Is that so?
Then who is it you go to visit?

311
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:32,268
- I visit Thea. Ask her...
- I already have.

312
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,031
It's not what you think.

313
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:51,909
Then I'd like you to tell the truth.
Come and sit down.

314
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:07,029
I am seeing a guy, and I slept over at
his place because I missed my train.

315
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,839
Please don't be so sad.

316
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:25,349
Sara, you can't handle this
on your own. You need help.

317
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:30,156
It's not so bad. Nothing happened.

318
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:37,072
I'm afraid you're abandoning Jehovah.
We have to call the elders.

319
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,678
I really like him.

320
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,792
But you slept at his place.

321
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,673
Do you want to forsake Jehovah?

322
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:03,228
I know you're struggling, and
temptation is everywhere at your age.

323
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,838
We love you so much.
We just want what's right foryou.

324
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,751
Let's go and call the elders.
Don't you think it's best?

325
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,793
Hello.

326
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,072
I've known him for a couple of weeks.

327
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,193
This Wednesday I ended up...

328
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:16,033
- I ended up staying overnight.
- That's grounds for expulsion.

329
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:21,394
I just missed my train, that's all.
Where else could I go?

330
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,037
We didn't even sleep in the same bed.
I slept on the floor.

331
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,632
God sees you, Sara.

332
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:36,995
You must avoid the things God hates.
Lies and carnal immorality.

333
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,393
I feel guilty towards God.

334
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,957
Then tell us what really happened.

335
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,398
I was in the bed
and he wanted to sleep on the floor.

336
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,070
But then I asked him
to lie next to me.

337
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,875
Did he kiss you?

338
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:10,119
Yes. We kissed each other.

339
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,113
Did you have sex?

340
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,392
- No, we kept our clothes on.
- And then what happened?

341
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:31,397
- We embraced.
- Did he touch your breasts?

342
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,952
Did he touch you anywhere else?

343
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:51,188
We didn't go any further than that.
Please believe me.

344
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,196
We believe you, Sara.

345
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,359
There won't be any public reprimand
or expulsion.

346
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,758
We believe you are repentant. But
write a letter and break up with him.

347
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,158
Do it as soon as you come home so
you won't be seized with doubt again.

348
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:19,718
But I really like him.
I just want to be with him.

349
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,712
It doesn't have to be... physical.
I just want to be near him.

350
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,840
I know you want to be God's friend.
You know what you must do in return.

351
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,918
Can't you help me? Please.

352
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,355
You have to trust in Jehovah.

353
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:48,954
Only by trusting in Jehovah
can you avoid Satan's trials.

354
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,837
Isn't there some way I can keep on
seeing him? Just as a friend.

355
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,478
But you slept at his place. Doesn't
that make him more than a friend?

356
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,157
I'm going to walk home.

357
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,672
Jesus hated corruption and greed.

358
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,549
But did that make him insensitive?
Not at all.

359
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,958
Jesus was known
for reaching out to others.

360
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:33,792
He compared himself to a mother hen
gathering her chicks under herwing.

361
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,836
- What did Jesus hate?
- Corruption and greed. Right?

362
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:45,910
Yes. What kind of animal
did he compare himself to?

363
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,076
Amotherhen.

364
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,149
Hi, Sara.

365
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:19,358
- I did it for your own sake.
- I know.

366
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,439
- I can't lie about stufflike that.
- I'm not mad at you.

367
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,758
You did the right thing.

368
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:38,079
- Talk to anyone online?
- No.

369
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,353
I've stopped going online.
It had gotten out ofhand.

370
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:46,439
Sometimes,
in order to worship Jehovah, -

371
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,475
- we must give up something
we really like.

372
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,116
We have disregard our own needs.

373
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,029
See you.

374
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,153
I understand you.
I feel sorry for you.

375
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:15,388
It's okay, Mom. I trust in God,
so l'll get through it.

376
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,991
If you'd done the same, things
would look different for our family.

377
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,398
Instead you threw it all away.

378
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,799
Thank you very much. Forthe books,
and the talk in particular.

379
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,199
- You're welcome.
- Bye.

380
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:43,396
Well done. People listen to you
because you talk from the heart.

381
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:48,230
You sound so funny sometimes.
Oldfashioned.

382
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:54,276
- "Talk from the heart"!
- You know how much I love you.

383
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:01,238
Dad... I've thought about
dropping out of school.

384
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,718
I want to be a pioneer. I feel most at
one with myself when I'm preaching -

385
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,072
- so isn't it best to focus
all my energy on that?

386
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,558
- Fantastic, Sara!
- You think it's a good idea?

387
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,356
Yes, of course. I'm very proud of you.

388
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,516
Hi. We handed out 21 magazines
and seven books all in one afternoon.

389
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,757
Sara has a gift for it.

390
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,357
Feeling better today, are we?

391
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,916
- Someone called for you, Sara.
- While I went shopping?

392
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:46,240
His name was Teis
and he said he had to talk to you.

393
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:51,389
I have to talk to him, Dad.
It's not fair just to send a letter.

394
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,479
- I have to speak to him.
- No, don't contact him.

395
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,391
He deserves a proper explanation.
You can't just send a letter.

396
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:08,199
- It'll just confuse you even more.
- So what? How do you think he feels?

397
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:20,910
Has he called before?
Has he called without you telling me?

398
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:29,630
Has he? Answer me!
How many times has he called?

399
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:35,073
Contacting him won't do any good.
He'll be okay, trust me.

400
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:42,398
I just want to say goodbye
in a decent way!

401
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,510
Lt's your choice,
but I don't think it's a good idea.

402
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,592
It's great to see you.

403
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,916
I'm glad you came.

404
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:16,558
- It's raining. Let's go to my place.
- No, let's just go for a walk.

405
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:22,278
- Don't make it any harder.
- Now I can't put my arm around you?

406
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,429
- I've come to say goodbye.
- I won't accept that.

407
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:32,236
But that was the deal.

408
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,352
Well, I'm breaking it.

409
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:40,918
- You'll live, make up with Mona...
- Don't give me that crap!

410
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:45,636
Wake up, Teis!
I'm a Jehovah, and you're not.

411
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,912
- It won't work.
- Why not?

412
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:54,148
- You're better off with Mona.
- Shut up about Mona.

413
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,432
- You came back because you like me.
- I came to say goodbye.

414
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,713
Don't let them walk all over you
and make you break up with me-

415
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,710
- so you can hand out pamphlets and
tell people they're better off dead!

416
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,037
- Goddamn it, Sara!
- You don't understand.

417
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,030
- You don't believe in God.
- They're manipulating you like hell!

418
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:21,679
They've got truth on their side.
I know, because I believe in Jehovah.

419
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:26,829
- You don't believe in anything.
- I believe in us.

420
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:45,194
Hi, Sara. I heard
you're dropping out. Why?

421
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:50,513
I'm going to be a pioneer.
In our movement, you know.

422
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,271
Like a missionary? For real?

423
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,998
Lt must be cool
to really believe in something.

424
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:09,309
- Good luck, Sara.
- Thanks.

425
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:14,753
Can you spare a moment?
How about a magazine?

426
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,478
Coming?

427
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,554
Jehovah, thank you
for blessing this meeting -

428
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,709
- and for inspiring and edifying
your congregation with yourword.

429
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,350
Welcome. Good to see a new face.

430
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,353
- Teis, what are you doing here?
- I want to hear the word of Jehovah.

431
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,672
- Dad, this is Teis.
- Obviously.

432
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,668
Welcome.
You're interested in our faith?

433
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,796
I can't forget the things Sara told me
and I want to learn more.

434
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,437
- L'll refer you to a congregation.
- I want to hear what Sara hears.

435
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:38,716
After all, she introduced me to you.
She says you're strong believers here.

436
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:46,192
Teis, I want to talk to John alone.
Wait for me outside.

437
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:55,671
When he's here to learn more
about our faith, it's okay to see him?

438
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,789
- Do you think he's sincere?
- He's very interested in religion.

439
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,959
Lfhe's looking for answers,
we shouldn't turn him away.

440
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:16,550
As long as you aren't intimate with
him, it's your choice if you see him.

441
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,196
- Thanks, John.
- I don't know if thanks are in order.

442
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:26,236
I've known you since you were little,
and I care very much about you.

443
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:30,592
I hope you're strong.

444
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:41,914
- What are you up to?
- You can't get rid of me.

445
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:51,431
Jehovah God, watch over Mom and
Dad, Elisabeth, August... and Jonas.

446
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:59,757
Thank you for your help.
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

447
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:09,760
The most important thing is
that it purifies your thoughts-

448
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,192
- because you know
you have this powerful friend.

449
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,918
Afriend who's always with you...
Thank you, Elisabeth.

450
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:24,716
If you're on the outside,
you have to face everything alone.

451
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:31,189
You're in an emotional chaos
with no sense of right and wrong, -

452
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:37,270
- and so nothing matters. It's hard.
Especially for a young person.

453
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:42,838
But when you walk with Jehovah,
you have a strong sense of direction.

454
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:55,754
- Weren't your parents Wtnesses too?
- How did you know?

455
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:00,033
- Sara told me, of course.
- What does that matter?

456
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:04,313
Have you read books about religions,
not written by Wtnesses?

457
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,875
No, that's the whole idea.

458
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:15,556
It's just interesting for me to see
where you got your strong faith.

459
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:23,112
The thing is not to let one's
certainty be defiled. Understand?

460
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,558
Yes.

461
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:37,358
What is the most defiling thing
when it comes to the purity of God?

462
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,874
Lots of stuff.

463
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,512
Greed.

464
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,553
- Materialism, I guess.
- Yes.

465
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,676
Selfishness... egoism, I guess.

466
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:02,433
Adultery.
Extramarital sex, I guess.

467
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:15,669
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

468
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,913
Goodbye, Teis.

469
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:26,830
Don't mind Dad. He just wants to be
sure we're doing this the right way.

470
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:33,070
You could've helped me.
He's your dad. Say something.

471
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:39,230
I don't disagree with him. I'm afraid
of doing the wrong thing, too.

472
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,631
You and me,
we're doing the right thing.

473
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:53,797
- I really want to kiss you.
- I really want to kiss you, too.

474
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:00,995
Tom here quit his job last summer.

475
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,796
He's spent a yearpreaching
the word of Jehovah in China.

476
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:11,392
HONOUR GOD

477
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:18,751
Now I'd like to introduce Sara,
a girl from my congregation.

478
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,509
Hello. My name is Sara.

479
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,589
I decided to stop my studies
to become a pioneer.

480
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:43,195
That's the kind of young people
we need. Thank you, Sara.

481
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:50,669
Lots of Witnesses are fighting
forthe word of Jehovah.

482
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,111
That's what keeps us going
at a time -

483
01:01:54,320 --> 01:02:00,236
- when worldly people go to extremes,
and those in powerlie.

484
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:04,752
- What do you think?
- I'm overwhelmed by it all.

485
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,953
Let them come to us,
let them be among the redeemed -

486
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:13,597
- and let them follow us
into the new world.

487
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:26,035
We'll sing number 37.

488
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,951
SEE YOU IN PARADISE

489
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:41,278
Good to see you again. I hope
you've met some friendly people.

490
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:44,472
It's been very interesting.

491
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:13,152
Man, this itches!

492
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:17,148
- Did I look cool or like a moron?
- Like a moron.

493
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:48,348
- Where did you learn to fight?
- My big brother.

494
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:00,429
- I don't want to fight anymore.
- You don't?

495
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,114
Now?

496
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,556
Are you sure?

497
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,552
- Hello, darling.
- Welcome.

498
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,832
Thank you forinviting us.

499
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:39,956
- You must be Sara.
- Hello. Vagn.

500
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,436
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

501
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:46,757
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

502
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:57,154
The summerhouse is an investment.
We hardly have time to go there.

503
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:01,831
My parents are yuppie hippies,
loaded with cash and compassion.

504
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:06,670
And Teis was brought up
to speak his mind, as you can hear.

505
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:18,194
- This looks delicious.
- Sara made it.

506
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:25,678
- Teis told me about your faith.
- Jette and Vagn are atheists.

507
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:30,635
- How come you call them by name?
- That's his own little rebellion.

508
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:35,038
And what's wrong with that?

509
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:41,634
- You being in a sect worries us.
- We've been over that, Jette.

510
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,673
Why do you call it a sect?

511
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:51,831
Lt's a group of uneducated people
who believe in the end of the world.

512
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:56,158
We don't think you need to have
an education to be happy.

513
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,873
Cheers.

514
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:02,551
If people don't educate themselves,
how will we support ourselves?

515
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:07,880
We don't believe
in materialism either.

516
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:15,630
We just try to bring people closer
to God. That's the only road to truth.

517
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,396
Think there's only one truth, Sara?

518
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,355
You've proclaimed
the end was near countless times.

519
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,791
- Jette...
- That's what I call brainwashing.

520
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,471
When you tell children the same lie
over and over again.

521
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:38,869
- You think so too, Vagn.
- Stop it, okay? Just stop.

522
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:47,597
- Don't mind Jette.
- Her anger took me by surprise.

523
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:52,157
Is she that hard
on all your girlfriends?

524
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:57,434
- She's just worried.
- Thanks for standing up for me.

525
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:05,436
I don't agree with the way she put it,
but she's right.

526
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:13,349
Somewhere deep inside
you know she is.

527
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:27,671
I thought you were approaching us.

528
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,233
- I thought you wanted to help me.
- I know what's at stake for you.

529
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:40,915
But I just can't.
I can't believe in it.

530
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,393
But we slept with each other.

531
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,434
We slept with each other
because we wanted to.

532
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,189
Stay.

533
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,157
Don't go now.

534
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:23,149
Sara... what a surprise.
Come on in.

535
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,999
Well, this is my home.

536
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:46,434
Would you like a cup of tea?

537
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,117
You still take sugar?

538
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,551
Are you okay?

539
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:15,152
What do you want?
Are you in trouble?

540
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:21,390
I'm sorry I shut you out.
It must have been lonely for you.

541
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,195
No, I've had a blast.

542
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:31,077
I supported your being expelled.
I thought it was your own fault.

543
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:37,674
- I never saw your side of it.
- You just did like all the rest.

544
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,157
L'll get tea.

545
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:09,758
Sorry. I'm really glad to see you.

546
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,520
And I'm glad to see you.

547
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:33,238
- Okay, so what's up?
- I'm in love with a non-believer.

548
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:41,830
We'll work it out.

549
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:03,350
John says everyone who went
to the rally are so proud of you.

550
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:16,878
I've decided to move in with Mom.

551
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:25,429
- What have we done?
- Nothing. She shouldn't be all alone.

552
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:29,110
When did you decide this?

553
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:35,429
I've thought about it for some time.
It was hard for herto move out.

554
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:39,997
- You chose to live here with Dad.
- So can't I change my mind?

555
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,668
Mom and Dad want us to be together.

556
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:47,431
- I'm not going to abandon you.
- Can't you just visit her more often?

557
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:53,237
Lt's not as if
you've been there every day.

558
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:01,119
She looks sad. I want to cheerher up.

559
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:05,552
- What's all this about, Sara?
- I never promised just to live here.

560
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,638
I didn't get divorced, did I?

561
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:25,311
Bye then.

562
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:38,158
I'm so glad you stopped by.

563
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:45,555
- I'm sorry I was so hard on you.
- Well, I am your mother.

564
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:51,199
I've told them I'm moving in with you.

565
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:56,030
Fine. You can have the bedroom,
l'll sleep on the couch and we'll...

566
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:59,118
Mom.

567
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:04,155
It's just so they won't find out
I'm living with Teis.

568
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,949
Okay.

569
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,231
Okay?

570
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:20,798
- Thanks, Mom.
- You're walking on a razor's edge.

571
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:27,638
I know. But you won't tell?

572
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:35,395
Other people have done stuff
like this without being found out.

573
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,720
I take it you don't want to be
a pioneer anymore, then?

574
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,911
I don't know how to tell Dad.

575
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,913
I've been thinking
about renting a house.

576
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,839
Forreal?

577
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:27,909
- Without telling me?
- I wanted to surprise you.

578
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:34,195
My parents want to help out
and we can't stay here.

579
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:43,151
- I'm scared.
- It's no worse than staying here.

580
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,789
It would be great.

581
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,630
No neighbours on the other side
of the wall. Just you and me.

582
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:58,518
- We'd get more room and a garden.
- Want me to be your little missus?

583
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,920
I'm crazy about you.

584
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,832
Careful... take it easy.

585
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,917
Okay, ready?

586
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,512
- Okay...
- Far out, huh?

587
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:05,191
- Can we rent it?
- It's not that expensive.

588
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:36,113
- What's wrong with the bedroom?
- I'm going to sleep here.

589
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:40,472
If anyone asks, I sleep here.
It'll be my word against theirs.

590
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:44,992
They can't do anything without proof.
Others before me have done it.

591
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:49,273
Do you really think
they're going to come afterus?

592
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:59,672
Just remember,
my blanket stays here.

593
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:06,235
- Where do you sleep?
- L'll show you.

594
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:19,075
- Hi.
- Want me to set an extra plate?

595
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:24,718
Hi, Sara. Glad to have you home.
Dinner's ready soon.

596
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:29,948
- So, you and Mom are all cozy here?
- Yes. What's with you?

597
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:34,073
- So where are your clothes?
- In the wash.

598
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:37,989
- All of them?
- Yes.

599
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:43,479
- Where do you sleep?
- Sara offered to sleep on the couch.

600
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:48,876
You don't live here. You don't
even keep a toothbrush here.

601
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:52,197
You never attend the meetings
or preach anymore.

602
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,029
- Stay out of it.
- You never come home anymore.

603
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:59,994
August is devastated. And so is Dad.

604
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:07,474
- Sara just needs some time away.
- From us?

605
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:11,912
I've been extra nice to you, so you'd
see it's our family that matters.

606
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:18,070
You have to let Teis go,
or you'll end up like Jonas.

607
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:24,037
- I won't give up Teis.
- So you love him more than us?

608
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:28,028
No. I never will.

609
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:33,360
It's not me who says I can't be
with him as well as with you.

610
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:41,911
- Elisabeth...
- You lied to us. And you too, Mom.

611
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:48,036
Elisabeth, let's talk about it
over dinner. Don't go.

612
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:56,072
Elisabeth wants to be a pioneer.
She promised your fatherAndreas.

613
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:59,192
Dad's happy then.

614
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:14,593
I haven't been able
to tell you this before.

615
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:21,353
I couldn't forgive Andreas, mostly
because I had doubts about ourfaith.

616
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:26,350
I was so sure you'd choose me.
He was the adulterer.

617
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:32,192
I hoped that if I got you, I could let
you be more like otheryoung people.

618
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:41,197
- I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
- No.

619
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,915
Yes. I was so angry with you.

620
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:48,715
I should have told you then, -

621
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:52,913
- but I was afraid
they'd expel me.

622
01:21:55,080 --> 01:22:00,029
And now I have to play along, or else
l'll lose Elisabeth, August and you.

623
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:03,516
Hopefully I can see Jonas in secret.

624
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,469
- Thanks.
- It looks delicious.

625
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:13,559
- It smells good, too.
- Dig in.

626
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:24,752
What are you going to do now?
Get a job or go back to school?

627
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,589
- I'm not sure.
- You have to do something.

628
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,997
What's the rush?

629
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,028
Hello, Teis.

630
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:46,633
- Is Sara here?
- No, she lives with her mother.

631
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:52,472
- May we come in?
- It's a bit inconvenient right now.

632
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:56,673
Please get her. We know she's here.

633
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:02,989
- Have you been spying on us?
- Please get her. Forher own sake.

634
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,909
- Please get her.
- Please leave.

635
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:11,910
- I've had it!
- L'll handle them.

636
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:18,597
There you are, Sara. We know
you live here like a married couple.

637
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,109
No, I don't sleep here.

638
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:26,030
We're not harming anyone.
We just want to be left alone.

639
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:30,313
You know that fornicators
offend the purity of Jehovah.

640
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:34,115
If you choose carnal lust,
you choose the loneliness of the soul.

641
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:39,633
If you choose desire instead
of Jehovah, you choose eternal death.

642
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:46,552
- Look, just leave her alone.
- You'd better go back inside.

643
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:57,830
Sara, for your own sake,
consider what you stand to lose.

644
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:06,476
You'd better get going. You probably
have many people to visit today.

645
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:13,350
Goodbye, Sara.
Thank you for this little talk.

646
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:17,671
Hi, Sara.

647
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:33,150
- Haven't you been to the stores?
- I haven't got any money.

648
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:38,718
- I left some on the kitchen table.
- I didn't know it was for me.

649
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:52,510
L'll order some pizza.

650
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:02,915
I'm glad you're home.

651
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:20,112
Hello, Sara.

652
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:27,510
- Hi, Dad. Great of you to drop by.
- It's okay.

653
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:32,794
I'm so glad to see you.
Want to stay for dinner?

654
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,790
- What a nice place.
- We want a vegetable patch.

655
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,551
Teis doesn't get a lot done
when I'm at Mom's.

656
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:46,469
This is a plum tree.

657
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:51,235
That's a hazelnut tree.

658
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:56,195
This is an apple tree.
I don't know what kind though.

659
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,836
Ingrid Marie.
You can tell by the leaves.

660
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:16,109
It's an old house, so...

661
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:26,078
- Hi. Welcome.
- Congratulations on the house.

662
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:33,958
Let me show you around.
This is Teis's bedroom.

663
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:39,592
And this is the kitchen.

664
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:50,193
If I can't make the last train,
I sleep down here.

665
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:59,595
I've made some coffee.
L'll go get the pizzas.

666
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:10,275
Sara...

667
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:23,069
- I can't see you anymore.
- What do you mean?

668
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:27,637
Sure you can. Why can't you?

669
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:37,638
- You live here with your boyfriend.
- My address is at Mom's.

670
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:44,073
- Yes, but you live here.
- Didn't you hear me?

671
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,794
My address is at Mom's.

672
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:52,791
You live here with your boyfriend,
and that means you're having sex.

673
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:00,156
No. I don't sleep with him.
When I stay over, I sleep downstairs.

674
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:05,798
You saw my blanket.
My address is at Mom's.

675
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,551
That's all you need. Get it, Dad?

676
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,072
God sees everything.

677
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:23,956
In that case, he sees you choosing
to believe me because you love me.

678
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:28,119
Jehovah is truth,
not a personal emotion.

679
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:34,714
- So you want to stop seeing me?
- No, that's what you want, Sara.

680
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:41,314
This is your choice, and yours alone.
Jehovah sees you make that choice.

681
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:46,833
Don't hide behind Jehovah.
This is your choice.

682
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:53,832
Sara, when you live here with
your boyfriend and sleep with him, -

683
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:57,874
- you can't see your own family.

684
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:01,231
You know that, Sara.

685
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:06,878
You have to come with me
to the elders and make amends.

686
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:11,039
Don't you see?

687
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:18,435
No. Not anymore.

688
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,273
So this is goodbye?

689
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:55,838
- Yes, I suppose so.
- Goodbye then.

690
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:59,032
Goodbye, Sara.

691
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:16,914
- You're not staying for dinner?
- No, I have a lot to do.

692
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:21,318
You know, August is at an age where
he takes things too much to heart, -

693
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,832
- so I have to be everywhere at once.
Goodbye.

694
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:44,389
Are you coming upstairs?

695
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:38,718
Today we have two announcements.
Sara Dahl is no longer a Witness.

696
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:44,472
And BrotherAndreas Dahl
has been appointed an elder.

697
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:49,708
Jehovah God, we thank you
for blessing this meeting.

698
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:55,358
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

699
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:58,552
Goodbye, and thank you.

700
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:35,993
- Is that you, Dad?
- No, it's me.

701
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:42,152
It's okay. I just want to talk to you.

702
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:48,957
- I miss you.
- Come with me.

703
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:53,392
- No!
- Leave, or l'll get Dad.

704
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:57,195
- I just want to talk to you.
- L'll get Dad.

705
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:05,273
- Talk to me. Can't we talk about it?
- You know we can't.

706
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:12,113
It was wrong to expel me.
I didn't contradict the elders.

707
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:16,757
I just wanted to be left alone,
so you and August can talk to me.

708
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:20,032
I miss you.

709
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:24,631
You should've
thought about that before.

710
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:28,752
August...

711
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:40,158
August, come on out.

712
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:43,796
I know Dad told you
not to speak to me.

713
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,879
But Dad doesn't know
you play computer games either.

714
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,470
Hi.

715
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:59,109
I don't want to be separated
from you and Elisabeth. I love you.

716
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:05,395
I hoped the elders wouldn't
expel me... I have to go now.

717
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,990
Dad says you have to suffer
in order to learn.

718
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:15,514
- But I'm suffering too.
- I know, and I'm so sorry.

719
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:22,478
You have to repent or you'll die
in Armageddon, and I don't want that.

720
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:25,719
August.

721
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:32,593
It won't happen. They lied to us.
The Day of Judgment doesn't exist.

722
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:38,073
Trust me. They've been lying.

723
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:43,192
August.

724
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:47,553
- August...
- Yes, Dad.

725
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,433
There you are.

726
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:08,271
Hi, Thea.

727
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:12,516
Thea, it's me!

728
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:40,434
Where have you been?
I've looked everywhere foryou.

729
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:48,272
- I've packed my stuff.
- Why?

730
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:54,276
- I can't stay here with you.
- Why not?

731
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:59,677
Lt's just too unequal.

732
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:05,238
I've tried to replace you
with everything I've lost.

733
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:10,559
I care so much about you.

734
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,273
It just won't work.

735
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:24,518
Deep down you know it's true.

736
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:35,474
I don't want you to go.

737
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:18,628
- What's up?
- I don't know where to start.

738
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:34,671
I've got something to tell you, too.
Something I've been considering.

739
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:40,635
You'd better start. You're more upset.

740
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:49,469
- I've been expelled too.
- I knew it.

741
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:55,118
What did you want to tell me?

742
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:02,317
Just a second.

743
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,115
Hi, Mom.

744
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:11,110
Yes, she's right here.
Do you want to talk to her?

745
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:15,157
Okay.

746
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:18,238
Yes...

747
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:28,037
l'll tell her.

748
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,754
- Bye, Mom.
- What's up?

749
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:40,548
Yourfriend Thea. Her dad called.

750
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:44,389
Thea's been in an accident.

751
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:49,435
They tried to save her,
but she died on the operating table.

752
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:59,236
"For He must reign, till He has put
all enemies under His feet."

753
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:04,992
"The last enemy
that will be destroyed is death."

754
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:15,271
Thea had a lively
and endearing personality.

755
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:30,318
But most of all she was strong.

756
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:39,912
So strong, that she at the very end
chose herfaith in Jehovah -

757
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:42,839
- over her own carnal redemption.

758
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:48,319
Thea never waivered in her decision
not to have a blood transfusion.

759
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:56,598
Not even though it's human
to have doubts in the decisive minute.

760
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:11,000
Before Thea died, the congregation
fully supported her difficult choice.

761
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:19,358
We never left her side.
Let's be happy for Thea.

762
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:27,792
Why save your life here and now,
when you lose eternal life?

763
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,478
Thank you.

764
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:12,513
Sit down.

765
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:20,271
I can't go on.

766
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:25,554
I can't stand being outside.
It's just too hard.

767
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:32,279
I want to repent. If you do too,
we can all be together again.

768
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:51,596
I'm sorry, Jonas.

769
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:54,997
But I can't.

770
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:20,871
Sara. It's extremely selfish of you
to show up.

771
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:26,916
Don't you know how much
it hurts Elisabeth, August and me?

772
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:31,590
Do you love me?

773
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:39,236
How can you even ask?
Of course I do.

774
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:42,193
Do you love God more than me?

775
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:46,678
- Yes.
- Why?

776
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:55,869
He created me. He's my Heavenly
Father and will give me eternal life.

777
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:05,671
Know what, Dad?
I think that's very selfish of you.

778
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:09,634
You could come back.

779
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:15,517
Repent and come back
so we can be a real family again.

780
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:22,150
Goodbye, Dad.

781
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:46,638
Jehovah God.

782
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:50,719
This is the last time we talk-

783
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:56,040
- because I don't
believe in you anymore.

784
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:07,231
Sara doesn't see herfather
and younger siblings anymore

785
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:14,956
She lives in Copenhagen where
she's studying to become a teacher

786
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:25,790
