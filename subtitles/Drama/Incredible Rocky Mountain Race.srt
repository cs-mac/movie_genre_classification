1
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,885
I've never seen that.

2
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,889
- Saucers...
- ...a dry lake bed.

3
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:07,816
- What's your status?
- Are you getting that on radar?

4
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,611
The government won't
admit UFOs are real because...

5
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,946
They're among us today.

6
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:23,123
Roswell, Gulf Breeze,
Area 51, Phoenix.

7
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,168
Scientists believe UFOs
are visiting our planet.

8
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:31,215
- UFOs are real and they know it.
- Something happened.

9
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:35,177
- I know what I saw it was not UFO...
- Of course UFOs exist.

10
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:46,105
We were facing an alien threat
from outside this world.

11
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:56,198
If the United States Air Force
did recover alien bodies...

12
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,575
UFOs are as real as you and me.

13
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,120
Unless the military
proves me wrong,

14
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,206
what I saw was an alien spacecraft.

15
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,678
You felt a connection
to your heart.

16
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,471
And you heard directions in your mind.

17
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,641
We saw the alien spacecraft...

18
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,076
One UFO sighting.

19
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,579
There's more than meets the eye.

20
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:48,417
UFOs are manifesting themselves
to people.

21
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,045
What we're talking about
is the greatest cover-up

22
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,715
in the history of mankind.

23
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,604
Object of unknown origin
is at 90-K and descending fast!

24
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,105
Get me a visual track now!

25
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,859
Zero match
with anything on our database.

26
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,277
It's maneuvering.

27
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,824
We're registering impact!

28
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,205
Get me Henry Burke. Now.

29
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,296
Hey. Do you think this is it?
It's the real deal, right?

30
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,133
You'll learn.

31
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,555
This is not a drill.
Attention...

32
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:49,061
Squad and equipment locked and loaded.
I re-routed local law and media.

33
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,980
Impact was eight minutes ago.
How long until we land?

34
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,942
Imperial Droid,
drive your Geonosian starfighters

35
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:41,113
to Planet...Hollywood.

36
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:46,952
Die! Die! Whoa! Hey!
Give me...No! Come on!

37
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,313
Awesome.

38
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:23,238
Extend the perimeter.
No one gets in. Nothing gets out.

39
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,451
Planet Hollywood, please.

40
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,417
They've got everything here.

41
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,004
This place is truly
like being on another planet.

42
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:42,299
With all this to see every night,
you must never get bored.

43
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,020
Greetings...!

44
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:01,860
- Welcome to the nutjob convention.
- I understand your reaction.

45
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,863
- They aren't helping our cause.
- Our cause?

46
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,826
Educating the public on the legitimate
possibility of life on other planets.

47
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,119
As a matter of fact,

48
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,997
I'm giving a lecture
on Astrophysical Anomaly Detection

49
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,582
at the nutjob convention.

50
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,461
Feel free to stop by.
Skeptics are always welcome.

51
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,713
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

52
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,678
Dr. Alex Friedman.

53
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,308
- Watch your backs, please.
- A classic.

54
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,212
Hey, come on!

55
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:06,341
Knock it off, will ya? I need to sleep!

56
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,927
Yeah, me too.

57
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:19,896
Now, Channel 13 Action
News in high-definition continues.

58
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,481
I'm Casey Smith, we back for a breaking news alert.

59
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,109
- An accident near Searchlight.
- And I'm Tricia Kean,

60
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,695
We're gonna take you to our reporter,
live on the scene.

61
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,240
Officials are calling it the
worst chlorine spill in state history.

62
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,368
A five-mile security perimeter
has been established.

63
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,996
Highway patrol officers
have been re-routing traffic

64
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,623
since the early morning hours,
and we're now being told

65
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,335
this section of Route 95
will be closed indefinitely.

66
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,838
This is Natalie Gann reporting.

67
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,770
The casts we pulled out of the trench
indicate a distinct pattern

68
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:46,358
alternating between the depth
of the impressions here and here.

69
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:51,613
Suggesting not one, but two
separate EBEs. They were moving fast.

70
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,156
Bipedal...

71
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,660
...possibly humanoid in form.

72
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,208
Review every data-gathering
entity within a 50-mile radius,

73
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:07,671
starting upon impact.
Look out for any anomalies.

74
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,554
You guys gotta move this thing.
I gotta go. Come on.

75
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,347
Jack.

76
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,225
You don't return phone calls anymore?

77
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,227
Mr. Wolfe thinks you're being rude.

78
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,480
Well, tell Wolfe that when I said
it was the last time, I meant it.

79
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,234
Mr. Wolfe decides
when it's the last time. Not you, Jack.

80
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:33,321
He likes you, Jackie. Hates to see you
wasting your God-given driving talent

81
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,032
giving fat tourists cab rides
up and down the Strip.

82
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,493
Buddy, what kind of life is that?

83
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,703
It's one I'm late for.

84
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,795
- You got a death wish?
- I drive a cab in Vegas.

85
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,842
You're dead, Jack.

86
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:58,096
Hey! What are you doing?
Man, are you insane?

87
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,765
Move this out of the taxi zone now
before I give you a ticket.

88
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,601
See you soon, Jackie.

89
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,082
- Where'd you come from?
- Outside.

90
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,419
Yeah, I figured that part out on my own.
How'd you get in the car?

91
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,880
Through that portal.

92
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,465
I'm Seth. This is my sister, Sara.

93
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,800
We require transportation
services immediately.

94
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,636
Really? Well, I require...

95
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,972
- A currency transaction.
- Would this amount suffice?

96
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,309
- What, did you two rob a bank?
- Is this acceptable, Jack Bruno?

97
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,562
How'd you know my name?

98
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,899
If we have a deal for your services,
we must move forward rapidly.

99
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,068
It's urgent we get
to our destination without delay.

100
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,235
All right. I'm going.

101
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,696
Where to?

102
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,121
- I need an address.
- We must travel in that direction.

103
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:09,584
I'm gonna need something a little bit
more specific than just "that direction."

104
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:14,339
We must locate latitude 40.54
cross-intersecting longitude...

105
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,591
We're just gonna stick with "that direction."

106
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,848
We tracked the two sets of EBE
footprints on and off for 7.3 miles,

107
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,934
losing them
at a rest stop off the highway.

108
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,353
Four hours, 19 minutes
post-impact, there was

109
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:32,023
a highway patrol incident report
filed at...the exact same rest stop.

110
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,776
A car trunk was burglarized,
no signs of forced entry.

111
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,986
Give me something
better than that, Mr. Pope!

112
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,614
Stolen clothing
belonging to a couple of teenagers.

113
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,491
We're in the game.
People let's roll with this.

114
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,035
Two kids don't
walk down the highway alone at night.

115
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,205
We got a senior citizen bus. Landing roughly
at the same time, same rest stop.

116
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,873
Thirty-nine people exit.

117
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,876
Fast-forward to the passengers
re-entering the vehicle.

118
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,463
- Fast-forwarding.
- Stop. Rewind.

119
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,633
Freeze.

120
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,969
There.

121
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,304
Looks like the bus
picked up some extra baggage.

122
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,974
Route schedule indicates next stop...

123
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,642
...Sin City.

124
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,228
I want total access to
every single surveillance camera

125
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,731
Vegas has turned on.
Check office buildings,

126
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,692
warehouses,
restaurants, department stores.

127
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,902
Look in sewer systems if you have to.

128
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,906
ATMs! Freeman Street
and Main to be exact. 12:45PM.

129
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:26,870
Bank records indicate they withdrew...

130
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,290
...the entire contents of the machine.
Fifteen thousand dollars.

131
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,084
And also. . . they never used a card.

132
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,588
They never even
touched the machine. Not once.

133
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:40,341
These EBEs
possess some extraordinary skills.

134
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,428
Bingo! Here's the
cab company security camera.

135
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,139
Keep your eyes
on the back door of the cab.

136
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,059
Right there.

137
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,396
Synchronous satellite feed.
Get me a license plate.

138
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,899
Ground transport, now.

139
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:59,778
And, no matter what
they appear to look like, gentlemen,

140
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,613
they're not children.

141
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,699
They're not even human.

142
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,301
Are your parents gonna be okay
with you guys spending all this money?

143
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,470
We have agreed upon a financial deal.

144
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,722
If your concern is regarding your compensation...

145
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,058
My concern is the fact
that I got a couple of kids

146
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,393
in the back of my cab
with a big wad of cash,

147
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,396
with a drop-off location that's
petty much in the middle of nowhere.

148
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,817
Now in my book, that's a little chapter
called "running away."

149
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,653
Jack, you better be
getting desert miles on that fare.

150
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,656
And they better be able to pay.

151
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,491
And you better get me an ETA!

152
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,118
- Capisce?
- I'm losing reception, Dominick.

153
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,453
Jack? Jack!

154
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,579
Oh, come on.

155
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,002
Jack Bruno, the vehicles behind us
are indicating a pattern of pursuit.

156
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,921
There's no vehicles following...

157
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,176
At your rate of speed versus theirs,
they will overtake our vehicle...

158
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,428
Relax, kid.
I'm just gonna let them pass.

159
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,942
Open road, people! It's all yours.

160
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,381
See what did I tell you?
Nobody's following us.

161
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,717
- I'm the king of these roads...
- Jack Bruno!

162
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,357
I said I was out, and I meant it!

163
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,860
Who is Mr. Wolfe, Jack Bruno?

164
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,946
How do you know that...?

165
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,573
Get down, now!

166
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:37,644
Hold on.

167
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,025
He is just a cab driver, right?

168
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,408
Jack Bruno, it would appear
we have not eluded them.

169
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,203
I'm so over this.
Stay down! Stay down!

170
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,665
Seth, no. It's not a good idea.

171
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,042
- I have to try.
- It's too dangerous.

172
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,216
Look out!

173
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,400
Now what?

174
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,368
Get out! Get out!

175
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,206
Get out!

176
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,006
You two okay?

177
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,924
- We are...
- Fine.

178
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,010
We should just keep moving.

179
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,350
Stay here. You didn't get the message?

180
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,228
I told Frank and Marty I was out.

181
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,148
You tell Wolfe for me
that he's gonna pay for my repairs.

182
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,818
You are in way over your head here.

183
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,035
I want a complete profile on the driver.

184
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,371
- You think he's collaborating?
- Either way, he's a liability.

185
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,415
Get me some air transport.

186
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,504
How are you two
holding up back there?

187
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,881
We're fine.

188
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,050
I'm sorry I dragged
you two into all this.

189
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,927
There's no need
for you to apologize, Jack Bruno.

190
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,055
You're not always the one to blame.

191
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,558
But the urgency of our trip
has not decreased.

192
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:44,771
Don't worry. I'll get you two
where you need to go. You've earned it.

193
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:09,003
- We're here, Jack Bruno.
- Here? There's nothing here.

194
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,347
Somebody's
expecting you two, right?

195
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,516
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

196
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,603
Don't worry, Jack Bruno.
We'll soon be reunited with relatives.

197
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,775
Okay. Seven hundred and 20 dollars
and 50 cents.

198
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,737
But after everything that went down
today, how about I knock off 25 percent.

199
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,822
- Here.
- I also...

200
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:43,079
Okay, then. Goodbye to you, too.

201
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,500
Five hundred percent tip?

202
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,128
That's reasonable.

203
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,139
Hey! You guys overpaid!

204
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,891
By a lot!

205
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,985
Unbelievable.

206
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,915
Everything OK in there?

207
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,025
Hello?

208
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,505
What just happened?

209
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,176
Jack Bruno, you should not have
jeopardized your life by following us.

210
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,802
What sort of trouble are you in?

211
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,014
Return to your vehicle.
Your services are no longer required.

212
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,016
- He's trying to help.
- We don't need help.

213
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,771
Somebody's already been here looking for
it. We simply cannot trust any of them.

214
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,522
Just us, Sara.

215
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,818
We appreciate your efforts
to assist us, Jack Bruno.

216
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,197
But my brother is right.
We can involve you no further.

217
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,032
- Got it!
- Let's go!

218
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:46,410
- Hey. Just tell me what's going...
- This way.

219
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,496
Hurry up, Sara.

220
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,388
What is that?

221
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,481
Whoa, hey!

222
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,364
Don't go in the pimped-out fridge, Jack.

223
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,991
Hey!

224
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,026
What is this place?

225
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,278
This way.

226
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,365
Hey, hey. Hey.

227
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,879
Hey!

228
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,424
Sara, it's here!

229
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,419
- What is it?
- It is what we came for, Jack Bruno.

230
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,422
Really? Is anyone else looking for it?

231
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,550
Say, the person
who trashed everything upstairs?

232
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,593
We think so. It is very valuable.

233
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,637
Which is why it was vital
that we locate it first.

234
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,932
What makes you sure whoever else
wanted it isn't still looking for it?

235
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,107
Shh! Shh! Go. Go. Go.

236
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,526
Go.

237
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,833
Run! Run! Run!

238
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,383
Ah!

239
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,927
Oh!

240
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,340
Ah!

241
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,305
- Jack Bruno!
- Kids!

242
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,108
Go, go, go, Sara!

243
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:35,991
Come on.

244
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,416
Jack Bruno!

245
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,045
Seth!

246
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,850
Ah!

247
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,066
Come on! We got to go! We got to go!

248
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,503
Seth!

249
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,720
- Seth!
- Keep moving! Keep moving!

250
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,766
Go, go, go, go!

251
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,775
Ah! Let's go! Let's go!

252
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:07,875
Get in!

253
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,254
Ah!

254
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,817
How's your brother doing?

255
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,903
- His system has the ability...
- I will be fine.

256
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,572
It is important we gain much distance
from this location.

257
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,449
I'm happy you're feeling better,

258
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,369
'cause you're gonna need your
strength when you try to explain to me

259
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,120
just what happened back there!

260
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,840
Alright, here's the deal. The cab
doesn't move until your mouths do.

261
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,010
- So start talking.
- The information you are seeking

262
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,304
is not within
your grasp of understanding.

263
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,516
We are dealing with issues
outside the realm of...your world.

264
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,059
Hey, I'm a cab driver, okay?

265
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,020
I have had plenty of worldly experi...

266
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,439
Experiences.

267
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,110
Sara! We have to go!

268
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,282
What is it?

269
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
Hang on!

270
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,501
Hold on!

271
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,495
We can't let him destroy it, Sara.

272
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,333
Who is he?
And this time I need real answers.

273
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,669
- It's a Siphon.
- A what?

274
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,757
He's an assassin trained to pursue his
target until his mission is completed.

275
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,384
And his mission is?

276
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,847
Us.

277
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,747
Is there a safer route, Jack Bruno?

278
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,335
Not unless you know how to fly.

279
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,771
Get down!

280
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,448
Jack Bruno!

281
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,999
Come on, come on. Hold it together!

282
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,836
Oh, come on!

283
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,547
Faster! Faster!

284
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,174
It won't go any faster!

285
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,635
- Sara!
- Ah!

286
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,730
Hold on!

287
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,699
Watch out!

288
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,922
Jack Bruno. In and out of juvie
and state pens since he was a kid.

289
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,673
Grew up poor in Midland, Texas.

290
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:10,761
Showed promise cutting his teeth
driving demolition derby and dirt track.

291
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,639
Ironically, at age 16,
his parents died in a car wreck.

292
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,682
At 17 he ran away from his foster home

293
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:20,228
and he headed to Las Vegas in the hopes
of going from stock car to NASCAR.

294
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:24,733
Instead he found work as a wheel man
for Andrew Wolfe, the Vegas crime boss.

295
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,861
His last bust was two years ago,
grand theft auto.

296
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,697
He got out, went legit,
and he's been driving a cab ever since.

297
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,908
Just spoke to
Jack Bruno's boss at Yellow Cab.

298
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,577
Bruno took a fare
a significant distance out of the city.

299
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,956
Dispatcher claims he's been unable
to make contact for several hours.

300
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,791
Does the cab have a tracking device?

301
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,086
LoJack. Until it
stopped transmitting 28 minutes ago.

302
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,089
For some crazy reason,
the last location was on train tracks.

303
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:57,099
- No. We cannot trust him.
- I know we can, and we must.

304
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:04,564
Couple of kids, big wad of cash.
What could go wrong?

305
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,825
- We know you're frustrated, Jack Bruno...
- No.

306
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:18,996
No more "Jack Bruno this, Jack Bruno
that." I've been asking for answers...

307
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,747
You know the answers, Jack Bruno.

308
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,750
My brother and I
are indeed not from your planet.

309
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,672
That's it? So that's it? Mystery solved?

310
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,133
You two want me to believe
that you're both aliens?

311
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,385
- It is the truth.
- Really?

312
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,178
Well, you don't look like aliens.

313
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,305
What does an alien
look like, Jack Bruno?

314
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,017
You know what aliens look like.
They looked like...like little green people

315
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:44,312
with antennas and laser guns and...and,
"Take me to your leader, Earthlings."

316
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,023
Ooh!

317
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:50,318
You require some sort of proof. He
thinks we're insulting his intelligence.

318
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,029
You think? You just can't drop

319
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,865
the "we're aliens" bomb
just like that on somebody.

320
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,409
I know I've seen some
pretty weird things today,

321
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,661
but you can't expect me
to believe that...

322
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,213
I have the ability
to move objects with my mind.

323
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,508
- That's impossible.
- No, it's quite possible.

324
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,385
On our planet as well as yours.

325
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,513
You don't do it because you haven't
learned to use your full brain capacity.

326
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:22,559
No, I don't do it
because it's kind of creepy,

327
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,811
and I really would like you to stop.

328
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,568
Jack Bruno!

329
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,368
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on!

330
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,496
Come on!

331
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:48,001
Come on! Come on! Start! Start!

332
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,568
Train engineer is banged up, but
alive. Last thing he saw in the tunnel

333
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,570
was our taxi and a set of flying lights.

334
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,781
He figured it must have
been a small plane.

335
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,450
Small plane? Wow...wow...wow.

336
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,286
You think there's a chance
there's a second ship?

337
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,957
You have the ability to fly at the speed
of light, yet you use a beat-up cab?

338
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:27,999
I don't think so.

339
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,460
Secure the site.
Catalog every piece of debris.

340
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:34,881
I want to know what's train,
what's cab and what's left.

341
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:14,045
- Hello! Anyone here?
- Yeah, we're closed!

342
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,298
Oh. There you are.
Yeah I know you're closed,

343
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,842
but ah we've experienced a little bit of
car trouble, so I was hoping...

344
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,928
We still closed. Experience your
car trouble when we're open.

345
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,098
Well I'll work on that next time.
But this time I really need you...

346
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,850
Jack Bruno.

347
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,853
The only thing that will convince
Eddie Cortez to reopen for business

348
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,855
will be a significant amount of money.

349
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,859
Wait a minute. Do I know you?

350
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,653
No. Absolutely not.
You don't know them from anywhere.

351
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,156
I'll pay you double your rate.

352
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,908
- Why not triple?
- Done.

353
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,826
Huh?

354
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,415
What did you get in a fight with,
a rhinoceros?

355
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,711
- Poor rhino.
- Poor rhino! I know.

356
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,549
Yeah, I don't even know where to start this baby.

357
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,093
Where you could start
is replacing the front shocks

358
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,721
and the tie rods, patch up
the radiator, fix the exhaust,

359
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,390
and if you have four tires,
I'll take those too. You got one hour.

360
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,744
Come on.

361
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,756
Over here.
Come on, sit, sit. Sit down.

362
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,642
I hope you do not act upon
your thought of making a fast break

363
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,561
out of the back door of Ray's,
escaping Stony Creek,

364
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,230
never to look back at us again.

365
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,065
How do you know that?

366
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,276
My sister also has
the gift of telepathy.

367
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,111
She can read the minds
of those nearest to her.

368
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:05,991
Really. Well, you tell your sister that
here on earth, reading mind is very rude.

369
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,867
Don't do that.

370
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,912
Hey, guys. Welcome to Ray's.

371
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,331
My name is Tina,
and I'm gonna be your server.

372
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,294
Wow. Look at the two of you.

373
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,587
Uh, what do you mean,
look at the two of them?

374
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:23,758
They look like just two
regular, innocent, all-American kids.

375
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:27,387
Who look like they just rolled around
in a pigpen right before dinner. That's all.

376
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,597
- Evening, Tina.
- Sheriff Antony.

377
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,141
Your table's waiting for you.

378
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,435
I'm gonna send you
a round of Frito pies.

379
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,395
- Sounds good.
- Thanks, Tina.

380
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,648
Why don't the two of you
come with me,

381
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:43,236
- and we'll get you cleaned up.
- Hurry back.

382
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,163
- It's Jack.
- I've been trying you all night.

383
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,874
Where are you?
You drop that fare yet?

384
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,626
No, it's really,
really complicated right now.

385
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,255
Uncomplicate it.
I want my cab back. Spotless.

386
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,134
Uh...Dominick, I got to go.
I got to go.

387
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,635
J...

388
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,514
- Got him! Stony Creek.
- Okay. Get us ground transport.

389
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,725
I want a clean extraction in 20 minutes.

390
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,357
You know, I think it would be...

391
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,984
Best for everyone
if Seth and I found another ride?

392
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,820
Seriously, you got to stop doing that.

393
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:29,282
Jack Bruno, it is understandable
that you are scared and confused,

394
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,077
- considering all that has occurred.
- I'm not scared.

395
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,705
Just...just a little confused.

396
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,709
But...but, the bottom line is, you...
you guys need someone from...from NASA

397
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,046
- or...or the Air Force, not me.
- If you abandon us now,

398
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,215
our mission will be in serious jeopardy.

399
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:48,093
Hey look, I'm just trying
to be honest here, okay?

400
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:51,554
- I'm the wrong guy.
- A wise human once said,

401
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,306
"You are what you think you are."

402
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,392
Why don't you find that guy and ask him?

403
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,186
It was the Buddha. He's unavailable.

404
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:03,149
How is it that beings on your planet
can be so large in form,

405
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,026
yet feel so small inside?

406
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,323
Maybe you need help, too, Jack Bruno.

407
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,622
- Dominick, I told you...
- Are they safe, Jack?

408
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,088
- Who is this?
- My name is Henry Burke.

409
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,549
I work within the Department of Defense.

410
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:30,301
I handle their more...sensitive cases.

411
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,011
What do you mean, "sensitive?"

412
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,765
I suspect we both know
the answer to that question.

413
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,018
Look they're just kids. They don't
want trouble, and neither do I .

414
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,438
Good. Then we're all on the same page.

415
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,107
Trouble is
the last thing I want as well.

416
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:47,569
But what I do want,
and I'm counting on you

417
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:51,614
to help me here,
are your two passengers.

418
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,952
What are you gonna do with them?

419
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,912
Do you care this much about everyone

420
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,958
that gets into your cab?
You're a convicted felon, Jack.

421
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:05,628
You've spent most of the day
breaking one law after another,

422
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,839
for what, for them?

423
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,803
- What do you want me to do?
- Not make a scene.

424
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,765
You walked them into Ray's, you can
walk them out. I'll take it from there.

425
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,560
And to show my appreciation
for your trouble,

426
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,395
I'll wipe your slate clean.

427
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,316
Just walk away, huh?
No harm, no foul?

428
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,234
That's right. Just walk away.

429
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,571
You've got five minutes, Jack,
and then it's all over.

430
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,073
Five minutes. I'll see you then.

431
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:44,667
I don't trust him. Cover all the exits.

432
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,966
They're here for us, aren't they?

433
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,595
Yeah. They are.

434
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,682
- I knew we couldn't trust him.
- Excuse me?

435
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,267
- Too late. We have to run!
- Wait.

436
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,354
I was wondering what your town's
policy is regarding conceal firearms.

437
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,438
Excuse me?

438
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,774
There's a whole lot of guns
coming in right now.

439
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,156
Come on. Come on.

440
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,661
I think he's over here.

441
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,845
Can I help you boys out?

442
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,890
Official government business.
Excuse me.

443
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:44,477
Officially my town.
That makes it my business.

444
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,944
Mr. Carson.

445
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:10,086
- You're making a big mistake, sheriff.
- I'll take my chances.

446
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,380
Dude, I told you I should have a gun.

447
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,383
Now might not be the best time
to bring that up...dude.

448
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,512
This is not good.

449
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:26,811
Shh. Follow me.

450
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,903
Up there.

451
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,365
Okay.

452
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,953
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

453
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:52,128
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

454
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,144
It's locked from the outside.
We got to find another...

455
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,937
Hey, hey, hey!

456
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:18,071
Or we could do that, whatever that is.

457
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,157
My brother has the ability
to control his molecular density

458
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,660
which allows him
to phase through solid objects

459
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,745
or withstand the greatest of impacts.

460
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,208
That's neat. Real neat.

461
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:37,465
You've got some mighty big friends in
some mighty big places. You check out.

462
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,449
Hi, little fella.

463
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,671
We appreciate your understanding.

464
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,632
Let's go.

465
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,888
We got an open hatch
leading to the roof.

466
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,598
We're on our way.

467
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,562
Eddie! Time's up. We got to go.

468
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,981
Go? I still got
a lot of work to do on her.

469
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,319
Next time we're in town,
we'll make an appointment.

470
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,489
- You want my card, or...
- No.

471
00:45:56,754 --> 00:46:00,214
Taxi's on the move. I want every
possible escape route locked down.

472
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,300
I want that cab and everyone in it!

473
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,093
Too many of them to outrun.

474
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,601
Whatever you're doing, keep doing it.

475
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,403
Ah!

476
00:46:22,428 --> 00:46:25,428
What you all looking?
What you all looking? Stop!

477
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,370
Say goodbye to Stony Creek!

478
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:38,044
What? No, no, not now! Not now! Come on!

479
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,714
Sara. Sara, are you doing this?

480
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:46,636
Sara, I said...Oh! Absolutely not!

481
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,555
This junkyard is not going with us.

482
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,891
I am done picking up stray passengers.

483
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,491
Those guys who were
chasing us were the same ones

484
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,243
- from the highway, right?
- Yes.

485
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,495
It is vital you take us
to their base of operation.

486
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,414
You want me to take you to
the guys who are trying to kill you?

487
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,667
Let me explain to you
how we do things here on Earth.

488
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,169
People who want you dead, you avoid.

489
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,923
That way you...mmm...stay alive.
Make sense?

490
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:28,177
No one on your planet will stay alive
if we do not return to our planet.

491
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,513
In order to return, we need our ship.

492
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:34,433
Those men who were trying to kill us
have stolen our ship. Make sense?

493
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,190
Where do you suggest
we begin our search?

494
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,192
I don't suggest
we begin searching at all.

495
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,362
I do suggest we go back to Vegas
and I drop you off where you got on.

496
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:49,657
You, too.

497
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,869
It's just as I thought.
No human is gonna help us, Sara.

498
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,370
Especially not this human.

499
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:57,123
Hey, hey. Easy on the human-bashing, okay?

500
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,542
Some of my best friends
just happen to be human.

501
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,961
And...and even if I want to help you,
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

502
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,339
I don't know anything
about...about UFOs or...or aliens or...

503
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,924
Who's Dr. Alex Friedman?

504
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,637
She's actually somebody who can help.

505
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,974
And, for the record,
she happens to be human.

506
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,024
No sign of the taxi from anyone yet.

507
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:26,819
Extend the search. They're out there.

508
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,914
Sara.

509
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:41,542
He would appreciate you pulling over
so that he can relieve himself.

510
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:45,379
We don't have time for that. He should
have went before we left Stony Creek.

511
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,423
He isn't pleased with your attitude.

512
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,175
Really? Is that the way he feels?

513
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:53,512
Will you remind him
that I'm a man and he's a dog.

514
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,725
And I'm not about to have this
or any conversation with a dog.

515
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:00,478
So my answer is still no.

516
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,197
Junkyard says thank you.

517
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,284
Did he, now?
Is there anything else he wants?

518
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:20,206
Oh. He said he would love
a bone or a meaty treat.

519
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,125
Top of my to-do list. Just get in.

520
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,340
Taxi!

521
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,349
Hey.

522
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:23,602
I need you to keep the cab close
and give the dog some water.

523
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:27,231
And, uh, give him a meaty treat.

524
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:36,282
Okay. So stay close to me,
don't talk to anyone, nice and normal.

525
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:42,705
I'm telling you.
He walked right past me. Bad move.

526
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,875
This was captured
by a far-imaging telescope

527
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:50,004
at the University of Bonn
less than 48 hours ago.

528
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:52,465
What I want
to direct your attention to is this.

529
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:58,721
- That looks like a smudge.
- Yes. Yes, it does.

530
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,973
Was it a spaceship?
Did they abduct you?

531
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,058
Excuse me?

532
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,894
- Were the aliens the Greys?
- Or the lizard people?

533
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,688
What? No, I wasn't abducted by anyone.

534
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,024
How do you know?
Dr. Harlan's last book

535
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:13,235
was all about how the aliens
can erase your memory with probes.

536
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,571
- Donald Harlan's book?
- You may have been probed.

537
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,741
It's pure science fiction.

538
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:24,038
I am talking about science fact here,
hard...hard data, not crop circles.

539
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:26,749
Have you ever actually
been inside a crop circle?

540
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:30,586
I have. It was huge.
It's where the mother ship landed,

541
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:34,423
where they took me on board,
where I was married to an alien woman.

542
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,259
That is it.
I will not answer any more questions

543
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:41,222
about...about alien abductions,
crop circles or Dr. Harlan.

544
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:44,600
Is that clear? If we could just
get back to the matter at hand.

545
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,685
People, hello, excuse me.

546
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,230
I...I promise it will be worth it.
The blue nebula...

547
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:53,859
We got a hit on Bruno's license plate.
They're back in Vegas.

548
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:57,738
Attention. The foundation reporter
has been rescheduled to...

549
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:04,954
The cattle mutilation lecture doesn't
start for an hour. But grab a seat.

550
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,123
This place will be packed. It always is.

551
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:10,042
- We're here to see you, actually.
- Oh.

552
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,586
It's Jack Bruno. We met earlier.

553
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,421
We did?

554
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:18,134
Cab...airport to hotel...driver.

555
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:22,388
Oh. The nonbeliever. What are the odds?

556
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,390
Hey is there someplace we can talk?

557
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,394
The, uh...crowds in here
making you uncomfortable?

558
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,229
Even more private than this.

559
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,148
Look, no offense, but I'm pretty busy...

560
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,818
She's doubting her thesis on
Gliese 581 and Alcubierre's warp drive.

561
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:42,408
- How did you know that?
- Oh, it gets a lot better. Trust me.

562
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,705
- Are you insane?
- I just thought you, of all people,

563
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,498
would understand and want to help.

564
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,501
Why, because I'm the nutjob
speaking at the UFO convention?

565
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:56,172
- Don't answer that.
- I know it sounds really crazy.

566
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:59,175
Ya think? Hey.
Please don't touch that.

567
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,177
You captured an image of our ship.

568
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:05,347
The smudge? You're telling me
you think the smudge is your spaceship?

569
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,767
No, we don't think it's our spaceship.
We know it is our spaceship.

570
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,937
That's it. I'm out.

571
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,231
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll just grab my laptop and...

572
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:33,083
Oh. They can also
do all this stuff, too.

573
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:38,339
Who are you?

574
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,008
Show her.

575
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:25,094
This is...huge.

576
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,763
I have so many questions,
eventhough you are the answers,

577
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,765
here, standing right in front of me.

578
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:35,938
I'm sorry. I'm very excited. Right.

579
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,275
W...Where are you from?

580
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,028
Our planet is located
some 3,000 light-years from Earth.

581
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,048
Space travel of such sizable distance...

582
00:54:46,133 --> 00:54:48,650
Is possible using a paradoxical
called passage in the unbounded...

583
00:54:48,735 --> 00:54:49,952
Wormholes. That's it.

584
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:53,455
My presentation at SETI
National Convention was right.

585
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:58,252
Interstellar travel is possible using
wormholes as a shortcut through space.

586
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,713
That was my first guess as well,
the wormholes.

587
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,674
Continue, doctor.

588
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,804
- Why did you come to Earth?
- Our planet is dying.

589
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,639
Millennia of neglect has rendered

590
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,891
- our atmosphere unbreathable.
- Oh it's sound familiar.

591
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,185
Our parents are scientists
who have studied Earth's

592
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,730
changing climates in hopes of finding
a solution for our planet future.

593
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,523
Our people's fears began to rise and then

594
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:22,818
our parents discovered something
our leaders were very interested in.

595
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:26,822
Your planet makes us a suitable
living environment for our kind.

596
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:31,827
It would be simplest to abandon
our dying planet and...occupy yours.

597
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,163
Okay wait. I'm helping you
conquer my own planet?

598
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:37,750
No. Most of the people on our planet
are fiercely opposed to this plan.

599
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,835
But fear of extinction
triumphed among our people.

600
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,046
But then our parents
discovered a solution.

601
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,466
An experiment at an outpost here
was successful in regenerating life

602
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,551
into all previous
dying plants and trees.

603
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:50,971
Which would enable the re-oxygenating
of your poisoned atmosphere.

604
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,682
- Alright, so what's the problem?
- Our military.

605
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,018
They preferred the solution of invasion over science.

606
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,854
Which is why we had to hurry
and retrieve the experiment.

607
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:04,360
All proof that our planet can be saved,
and your planet spared, is in here.

608
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:07,321
- Where are your parents again?
- They were arrested for their opposition.

609
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,198
We agreed to complete the task for them.

610
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:13,535
- And what about the assassin?
- Assassin? What assassin?

611
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,997
The Siphon warrior series Deraniun 75
was created by our military.

612
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,666
- They're bred to hunt?
- They were bred to kill.

613
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:23,128
If we don't return back home in time,
the invasion will proceed.

614
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,590
We seriously need
to find your spaceship.

615
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,808
How well do you know this guy?

616
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:39,186
We've done a few panels
and debates together on opposite sides.

617
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,647
But no one knows the shadow world of

618
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,483
UFO government conspiracies
better than Harlan.

619
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:47,986
Not now, Whitley.

620
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,448
Well, hello, Dr. Friedman.

621
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,867
So you've finally decided
to accept my offer

622
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,078
of a romantic Benihana dinner for two.

623
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:59,206
- Huzzah!
- What?

624
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:03,252
Ahem. Uh. . . Three years ago,
a screening of the Cooper footage.

625
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:06,422
You were in the fourth row,
second seat, in a saucy flower print.

626
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:10,092
Sorry, I keep my work and
social life separate. I don't date...

627
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:13,762
- ...colleagues.
- Colleagues. Indeed.

628
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,557
Listen, we need to see
Harlan right away.

629
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:19,685
Dr. Harlan is presently
unavailable for consultations.

630
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:22,229
We're more than qualified
to answer any questions.

631
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,605
There is no time for that.

632
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:27,192
It is a matter of life and death
that we see Harlan now.

633
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,944
Life and death, ooh!

634
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:33,282
Uber scary drama queen theatrics.
What's the 411 sitch?

635
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:37,744
You're currently alive. Unless you
take us to Harlan, you'll be dead.

636
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,874
- Okay let's go. We should...
- Together if you want to. Right now.

637
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,004
Go away!

638
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:51,091
The book signing
is not till 4:30. Read the brochure.

639
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,218
Harlan, it's Alex Friedman.

640
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:02,060
Dr. Alex Friedman. Quelle surprise.

641
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,980
We have to speak with you
immediately. It is important.

642
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:13,489
So you're saying the three of you
witnessed this reported UFO crash.

643
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,157
- That's right.
- We were wondering if

644
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,242
there was any intel
amongst your sources.

645
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,954
I hate lying. I really don't like lying.

646
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,249
I can tell when people are lying to me.

647
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:28,003
But, thankfully, your story checks out

648
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:32,049
with all the reports I got from
SETI and NORAD and NASA.

649
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,633
We have reason to believe a team of

650
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:36,845
government-sponsored covert
operatives recovered the spacecraft.

651
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:40,140
Okay. Back up a little.
This is not space camp.

652
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,434
Let the experts do their work.

653
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:46,522
You know you're very lucky, you two,
that you didn't come face to face

654
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,274
with the aliens who were in that craft.

655
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:54,196
They're like deadly praying mantises.
They eat your flesh.

656
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,282
Oh...oh yes, we are, indeed, lucky kids

657
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,827
not to have had our
flesh eaten by the aliens.

658
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:04,373
You got that right.
Okay. Let's go to work here.

659
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:08,544
I got an e-mail from a source
that sent me this sat-grab.

660
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,088
Where...would they take
the spaceship? 51 ? Nellis?

661
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:13,067
Wright-Patterson? Vandenberg?

662
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:15,592
Well, from the size and scope of the crash,

663
00:59:15,592 --> 00:59:18,260
I would say there's
only one possibility.

664
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,888
- Witch Mountain?
- Witch Mountain.

665
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,140
What, are we a singing group here?

666
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:25,477
- Let me talk, and you guys nod a bit.
- I apologize. I'm sorry.

667
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,062
Witch Mountain.

668
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:30,566
Let's take a look.
Here we go. California.

669
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,402
About 50 miles
from the border of Nevada.

670
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:37,239
And it's one of our
top-secret facilities.

671
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,908
I got a schematic here someplace.

672
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,828
You know if you're planning on visiting, don't.

673
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:46,540
When I say this place
is fortified up to the yin yang,

674
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,709
I'm making an understatement.

675
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:52,337
Here's the schematic.
And do you have the book?

676
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,422
Yes, I do.

677
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,883
All right, then, here's an aerial view.

678
00:59:56,968 --> 01:00:00,304
Thank you, Harlan, for everything.

679
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,348
Whatever trouble you're in...

680
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,019
...trust no one.

681
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,032
Thank you, both of you.

682
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:23,118
Seth and I understand that
you don't have to go forward with us,

683
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:26,246
- and yet you choose to.
- You're welcome.

684
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:31,251
And don't worry.
We're gonna get you home. I promise.

685
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:35,005
I'm gonna grab my stuff. Let's meet
upstairs in the convention, at my booth.

686
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:38,300
- Then we get your cab.
- Alex, uh, listen.

687
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,636
- I can't let you come with us.
- What?

688
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,263
If half of what Harlan says
is true, it's way too dangerous.

689
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,307
They got in my cab.
They're my problem.

690
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:49,353
Um, no. I have spent my entire life
preparing for this moment.

691
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:51,897
And now, when I have two actual aliens
in need of my help,

692
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,148
you want me to walk away?

693
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:56,109
It's not gonna happen.
Man up, soldier. I'm in.

694
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,154
Just lay low till we meet up.

695
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:02,491
Sure. Great. Lay low.
Easy. How hard could that be?

696
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,079
She thinks you're very handsome.

697
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,832
- Really?
- And smarter than you think you are.

698
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,794
So she was thinking about me, huh?

699
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:16,380
At least as much
as you were thinking about her.

700
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:21,510
So she didn't happen to mention
in her thoughts that I was...

701
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,053
It's showtime, everybody!

702
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:26,306
Space Expo Number Nine.
It's upstairs. Come on.

703
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:29,726
- Should...should we go upstairs now?
- Err...yeah, yeah. Let's go upstairs.

704
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:37,901
Hey do you think she was thinking about...?

705
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:41,697
Seth. Sara! Seth!

706
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:44,908
- Jack.
- I tried to warn you, Jack.

707
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:47,119
Mr. Wolfe doesn't take rejection well.

708
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,708
This is so not a good time.

709
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:55,502
- Ah! Oh!
- You're out of time, Jack.

710
01:01:55,586 --> 01:02:00,507
Well, well, well. If it isn't
the Rebel Alliance cab driver scum.

711
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:03,719
Not such a tough guy out
of your ship, are you, you womp rat?

712
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,053
You're in our house now!

713
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:08,306
Ah!

714
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,812
Move! Move!

715
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,985
Hi! I'm Sunday.
Welcome to Planet Hollywood.

716
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,571
Are you gentlemen here
for the UFO Space Expo?

717
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,156
Wouldn't miss it.

718
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,162
Seth! Sara!

719
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:39,337
- Wow!
- Costume's great, man.

720
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:41,715
Whoa!

721
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,969
Seth! Seth!

722
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,013
Sara!

723
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,644
Seth. Sara.

724
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:56,730
I'm sorry.

725
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:10,494
I sure hope we have enough fuelage
to get back to planet Earth, Conrad.

726
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:13,288
Fear not, Celeste.
We must get to the ship.

727
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:17,959
Ah!

728
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,461
My leg!

729
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:22,714
No!
Look at that beast from another galaxy.

730
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,466
It's so disgusting and scaly!

731
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,301
Didn't I tell you two
to stay by my side?

732
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:27,594
I heard you the first time.

733
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:30,263
Is this reenactment an important
piece of Earth's history?

734
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:33,892
- Stand back, you beast!
- No. Come on. Let's go. We got to go.

735
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:37,562
Jack Bruno.

736
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,865
Sara!

737
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,413
Let's go! Let's go!

738
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,333
You're down!

739
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,254
Everybody, down!

740
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,923
Stay down! Stay down! Stay down!

741
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,967
Get down! You, down! Everybody, down!

742
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:08,885
You with the blue hair, right there!

743
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:12,264
Best...convention...ever.

744
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:13,890
Not here! Move out!

745
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,243
Other way. Other way.

746
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,231
Sara, are you listening
to what I'm thinking?

747
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:11,197
Go! Go! Move it, move it!

748
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:12,657
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

749
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,580
Oh. That's me.

750
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:25,754
Got to go!

751
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:29,341
- What happened to laying low?
- Who lays low in Vegas?

752
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:33,053
Move, move! Get out of the way!

753
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,138
Move it! Get out of my way!

754
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:28,274
We got them!
Our suspects. No one else interferes.

755
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:31,319
Do not move! Do not move!

756
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:36,032
Stay inside the vehicle!
Hands where we can see them!

757
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:41,037
Greetings, Earthlings.

758
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:11,192
I didn't even imagine they'd actually
look human, much less like kids.

759
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,111
They're lucky you joined us, doctor.

760
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,530
We're lucky...you joined us.

761
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:19,743
Luck has nothing to do with it.
It's pure science.

762
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:23,955
Chaos theory, the underlying order
in apparently random data.

763
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,166
So more like fate?

764
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:29,544
Mmm...science. Think about it.

765
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:33,965
What are the odds that they would crash
near Vegas during a UFO convention?

766
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,051
I got in your cab.
Then they got in your cab.

767
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,511
And now we're all
in Harlan's mobile home

768
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:42,891
loaded with his intel on where
their ship is. That is not luck.

769
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:46,311
That is a predetermined order of
how things work in the universe.

770
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,146
You always been this positive?

771
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,357
I have always been
a searcher for answers,

772
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:54,569
though my folks would say
I was merely a daydreamer.

773
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:56,696
How about you?

774
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:59,949
Me? I'm a, uh,
much easier book to read.

775
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,870
All my life my answers
have been "yes" or "no."

776
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:06,498
Zero gray areas.

777
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:11,669
Where does the Mustang fall?
A yes or a no?

778
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,421
That's not just any Mustang.

779
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:17,175
That's a 1968
Ford Mustang GT 390 Fastback.

780
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:20,386
Steve McQueen's car in Bullitt?

781
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:24,099
- You've never seen Bullitt?
- Uh, no.

782
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:28,228
Err...It's currently a no.

783
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:31,064
But one day I'm gonna earn
that car, the honest way.

784
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,484
- And then it will be my yes.
- Huh.

785
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,989
- Jack?
- What's up, pal?

786
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,659
Are we there yet?

787
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,454
- "Are we there yet?"
- Unbelievable.

788
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,623
Good in any universe, apparently.

789
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,708
- Well, Alex?
- Yes.

790
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:11,855
The maps are 30 years old,
but they're the best intel we've got.

791
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:15,400
Looks to be about five miles
from here to the entrance.

792
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,609
Okay.

793
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,195
Let's rock and roll.

794
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,386
There's gotta be
another entrance.

795
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:52,395
If the map's right,

796
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:55,356
there are several service
tunnels spreading outward.

797
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,650
- Worth looking for, right?
- Let's go.

798
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,362
Ah! Jack...

799
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,156
Sara.

800
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:07,118
Sara! Seth!

801
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:13,875
Mr. Bruno and, I believe, Dr. Friedman.

802
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:16,836
- What did you do to them?
- Consider yourself lucky.

803
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:19,505
I could have had you both
shot on sight for trespassing

804
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,799
and violation
of US government property.

805
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:25,386
Sara!

806
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:30,350
Ah!

807
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:38,900
There you go. All right.

808
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:42,654
Sir. With all due respect,
you have to listen to me.

809
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:45,990
They came in peace.
We cannot respond with violence.

810
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,034
The future of Earth depends on it.

811
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:50,620
It is absolutely vital
that they get home.

812
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:55,416
They are home, Dr. Friedman.
They are now in my custody.

813
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:59,754
"Custody?" You can't expect to
keep them prisoner and get away with it.

814
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:03,174
- They have rights.
- They're illegal aliens on US soil,

815
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,759
without so much as a passport.

816
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:09,222
The Patriot Act enables me to detain
them for as long as is necessary.

817
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:11,266
You can't keep this quiet.

818
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,227
The world has the right
to know that they exist.

819
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:18,314
And you're going to be the one
to blow the whistle, doctor?

820
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:23,695
A failed astrophysicist fired by three
universities for obsessing over UFOs

821
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:26,698
teams up with an ex-con
in declaring that the government

822
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:30,159
has captured two normal-looking kids
and is holding them hostage

823
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:33,079
inside a mountain that doesn't exist?

824
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:36,499
It would be so much easier
to let you speak

825
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:40,712
than to deal with all the paperwork
involved with killing you.

826
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:43,923
- Someone will believe us.
- From behind bars?

827
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:46,801
Let me remind you, Mr. Bruno,
as a convicted felon,

828
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:50,805
you're looking at 20 years just for
standing on this mountain talking to me.

829
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:52,056
Shall I go on?

830
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,727
No. I get the message.

831
01:11:57,229 --> 01:12:00,815
Smart man. Give them a lift back down.

832
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:04,652
What? That's it? It's over?

833
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:08,573
I'm sorry. I will not go back to prison.

834
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,075
Let's go.

835
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:20,668
Thankfully Seth and Sara didn't
have to witness how quickly you gave up.

836
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:24,005
I told them from the beginning it was
a suicide mission and I wasn't wrong.

837
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:25,840
They trusted you. I trusted you.

838
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:28,843
Yeah join the club of everybody else
in my life who I've disappointed.

839
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:31,846
They will dissect them like frogs
in high school biology. You know that.

840
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:33,806
Whatever it's not my problem and it never will...

841
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,683
Hey!

842
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,993
By the way, that slap, very realistic.

843
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:56,996
When did you know?

844
01:12:57,081 --> 01:13:00,041
You haven't bailed on the kids yet.
Why start now?

845
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:08,633
How soon until
the subjects are prepped?

846
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,259
They're heavily sedated.

847
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:14,305
Minimal med tests
proceeding within 48 to 72 hours.

848
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,975
Unacceptable. Commence the procedure.

849
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,228
We don't know enough
about their systems.

850
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:23,022
Any sudden change
could terminate the subjects.

851
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:24,816
You can't just kill them.

852
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:32,031
Mr. Pope. You would do well
not to forget what our mission is.

853
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:34,075
Our orders come from Washington,

854
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:38,079
and Washington wants answers
to some very complex questions.

855
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,415
Our goal is to provide those answers.

856
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:45,002
Now, if you are doubting your ability...

857
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,464
No...sir.

858
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:54,470
Very good, then.
Commence the tests, Mr. Matheson.

859
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:57,306
Right away, sir. Initiating tests.

860
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:07,608
- Here. Here.
- Coming...almost...

861
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:19,203
- After you.
- I'm right behind you.

862
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:21,873
Thanks.

863
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,723
- Back up. Back up for a second.
- What?

864
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:04,916
It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna be here the whole time.

865
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,752
I'll be right below you the whole time.

866
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:10,838
- I can't.
- You can.

867
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:15,009
- Here I go. Oh, boy.
- That's it. Right here.

868
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:20,097
- You got it.
- Here we go.

869
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,851
Ah! What's that?

870
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,855
Oh, no, Jack. Exhaust furnace!

871
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:31,859
This way. This way. Come here.
There's another tunnel right here.

872
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:37,323
Hurry! Hurry!

873
01:15:54,549 --> 01:15:55,967
- You okay?
- Yeah.

874
01:15:56,951 --> 01:15:58,951
Let's go.

875
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:26,956
What now?

876
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:30,918
- Find the kids. Don't get caught.
- Good plan.

877
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:34,672
We're very close to determining
the source of their powers.

878
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:41,429
Yes, sir, containment's
at a hundred percent.

879
01:16:41,513 --> 01:16:45,266
We've recovered
the two targets and their spacecraft.

880
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:53,065
I understand. Thank you, sir.

881
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:55,860
And thank you
for sticking by me and the project.

882
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:58,029
I know it's taken
a long time to get here,

883
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:01,657
but we both agree
it's been worth our previous failures.

884
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:10,124
All vitals
appear to be stabilized.

885
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:15,463
Attention, all personnel.

886
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:18,132
South perimeter is now closed off.

887
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:20,968
South perimeter, closed off.

888
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:27,558
Stand by, all departments,
for re-check of radiation.

889
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:35,274
Whiskey 7,
we have penetration

890
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:39,487
in fence sector 28. Break. Tango 31 .
All stations, general alert.

891
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:42,198
Bruno. Deadly force authorized.

892
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:44,992
Project Moon Dust troops,
meet me in sector two.

893
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:47,319
Red alert, security breach! Red alert!

894
01:17:47,404 --> 01:17:49,780
Red alert, security breach! Red alert!

895
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:55,002
Close containment doors, all levels!
Close containment doors, all levels!

896
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:13,937
This facility's on red alert! Clear standard is operating...

897
01:18:13,962 --> 01:18:15,898
Full safety to general alert.

898
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:19,151
- Bravo Team, follow me!
- Attention! Attention!

899
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:22,321
Go, go, go! Move!

900
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,241
Incoming!

901
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:33,124
Fall back! Fall back!
Get those men out of there!

902
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,461
Hi. Can I borrow that pen?

903
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,430
I have three older brothers.

904
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:56,021
Sir, this area has been compromised.

905
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:59,734
- Make sure the blast door's sealed.
- Seal it off!

906
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:02,361
We got an Alpha Level One breach
in the main complex.

907
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:03,571
All units, respond!

908
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:06,574
Isolate, lock down
and secure your sectors now!

909
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:10,411
Keep moving! Keep moving!

910
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:12,830
We lost all communication
with sector five!

911
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:36,437
Come on, come on, come on. Wake up!

912
01:19:51,828 --> 01:19:55,331
We are under attack. I repeat,
all levels have been compromised.

913
01:19:55,415 --> 01:19:58,959
- We are under attack.
- Sir? Ah...sir!

914
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:01,545
What was that?

915
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,965
No idea. It's cutting down
our troops, driving the pass rate for...

916
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:08,469
Straight for the lab!
Let's go! Move! Move!

917
01:20:08,553 --> 01:20:09,804
Let's go! Clear out!

918
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:21,398
- What is it?
- Uh, some sort of anesthetic.

919
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,984
- Can you fix it?
- I don't know, but I can try.

920
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:27,279
These locks are too strong.

921
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:30,825
- Green is oxygen...
- We got to hurry. We got to hurry.

922
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:31,909
All right. . .

923
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:36,247
Can't get 'em open.

924
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:45,923
Seth.

925
01:20:46,758 --> 01:20:49,510
Seth, it's okay. It's okay.

926
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,650
I'm gonna get you out of here.

927
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,366
...use extreme caution.

928
01:21:19,165 --> 01:21:21,834
Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

929
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,547
Security team Bravo, please report.

930
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:40,811
Let's go.

931
01:21:41,236 --> 01:21:42,236
Let's go.

932
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:52,156
It's over there.

933
01:22:33,573 --> 01:22:34,782
Oh, my...

934
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:44,291
- We have to hurry.
- Well, tell them that.

935
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:45,668
Good idea.

936
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:50,089
Wait!

937
01:22:57,722 --> 01:22:59,723
Excuse me.

938
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:02,226
Do you not hear the alarms?

939
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:05,145
Work in this sector
is to cease immediately.

940
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:09,233
We have off-the-chart readings of
sodium hypochlorite, xenon, hydrazine,

941
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:12,444
and you don't even want to know
how bad the gamma radiation is.

942
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:14,488
But you're gonna
have to do some serious,

943
01:23:14,572 --> 01:23:16,323
and I mean serious, scrubbing down.

944
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:21,412
- Who are you?
- Who am I? Who am I?

945
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:22,830
I'll tell you who I am.

946
01:23:22,914 --> 01:23:25,791
I am your worst nightmare
at a court-martial, soldier.

947
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:27,501
You can either do as you're told,

948
01:23:27,585 --> 01:23:32,131
or I can go tell Henry Burke
you disobeyed his direct orders.

949
01:23:32,215 --> 01:23:35,175
Your call. Choose wisely.

950
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:43,142
Sir, I'm pleased to inform you all personnel
have evacuated the ship's hangar.

951
01:23:43,226 --> 01:23:45,352
What are you talking about?
On whose authority?

952
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:49,565
- Yours...sir?
- Get out of the way!

953
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:50,899
Let's go! Move!

954
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:38,238
Thank you.

955
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:41,241
We were having a hard time
figuring that part out.

956
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:53,420
- Jack...
- A brave but empty gesture, Mr. Bruno.

957
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:55,339
They're just kids.

958
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:32,960
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

959
01:25:33,044 --> 01:25:35,379
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

960
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:46,306
- Go, go! Run! Run!
- Get inside!

961
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:50,310
- Get after them!
- Alpha! Bravo, on me!

962
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,396
Go, go!

963
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:58,819
Cool.

964
01:26:05,076 --> 01:26:07,119
Get this thing up in the air. Let's go!

965
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:14,793
Go, go!

966
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,893
Dude! I could really
use a gun right now!

967
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:33,520
Thank you. This is a really big gun.

968
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:42,738
Come on.

969
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:50,078
Activate the shields.

970
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:52,789
Power's at 25 percent
and increasing.

971
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:56,460
No, no. No, no. No, no.

972
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:06,386
You do know how to fly this thing right?

973
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:09,348
- How do you think we got here?
- Well, you crashed. Remember?

974
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:16,396
Siphon!

975
01:27:19,817 --> 01:27:20,859
Hold on!

976
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:23,987
Got him!

977
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:29,785
Watch out!

978
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:33,497
Follow the tunnels. There you go!

979
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:35,582
Lock down the mountain.

980
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:45,592
Watch out!

981
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,845
Just shut it down!

982
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,390
Gates closing in ten,

983
01:27:51,474 --> 01:27:53,600
nine, eight...

984
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,727
- Watch out!
- ...six...

985
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:58,230
- The door!
- ...four...

986
01:27:58,314 --> 01:27:59,606
The door! The door!

987
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:02,025
- . . .two, one.
- The door!

988
01:28:06,197 --> 01:28:07,364
Whoo!

989
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:21,962
- You did it!
- We did it. We did it!

990
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:24,881
Whoa! What was that?

991
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:28,176
The airlock's jammed.
I need to manually override the system.

992
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:30,762
You two fly. Just tell me what to do.

993
01:29:00,084 --> 01:29:04,171
Alex, it takes two to pilot the ship.
I need you to take the controls.

994
01:29:04,255 --> 01:29:06,548
What? Are...are you insane?

995
01:29:31,824 --> 01:29:33,325
Jack!

996
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,205
You're better with the mask on.

997
01:30:08,778 --> 01:30:10,445
Ah!

998
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:28,046
Jack!

999
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:46,022
Yes, he's here.

1000
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:49,109
Sir, it's Washington.
They have some questions for you.

1001
01:30:56,576 --> 01:30:57,576
Sir?

1002
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:01,246
You both must hurry.

1003
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,248
Only a matter of time
before they get here.

1004
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:05,959
- Don't worry about us.
- Sara and I want you to have this.

1005
01:31:06,043 --> 01:31:10,464
As long as it's in your possession,
we'll always be able to find you.

1006
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:18,013
Thanks.

1007
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:27,522
Your parents will be very proud
of what you've done here.

1008
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:34,404
Thank you, Alex.

1009
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:42,412
I once said that we could never count
on humans to help us. Especially you.

1010
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,999
I was wrong, and for that I am sorry.

1011
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:47,709
You take care of yourself.

1012
01:31:49,378 --> 01:31:52,172
And your sister, too. Do you understand?

1013
01:31:54,717 --> 01:31:56,927
- Yes.
- Jack?

1014
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,811
You guys remember that, me and Alex...

1015
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:12,484
...we're only a wormhole away. Okay?

1016
01:32:12,568 --> 01:32:15,278
I want you to promise me something.

1017
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:18,823
Take care of Junkyard for me.

1018
01:32:20,508 --> 01:32:22,485
Anything you want.

1019
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:31,336
It's time.

1020
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:36,299
You're a good man, Jack.

1021
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:54,502
If everything that
you wrote about in your book is true,

1022
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:56,630
why risk coming out
in the public at all?

1023
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:59,090
Why haven't you been
arrested yet, or worse?

1024
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:02,594
We decided right away that
the more public we went with the story,

1025
01:34:02,678 --> 01:34:06,222
then the less likely we were
to...disappear.

1026
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:09,601
And so far, clearly, we've been right.

1027
01:34:09,685 --> 01:34:12,854
- Thank you all so much for listening.
- Thank you.

1028
01:34:16,859 --> 01:34:19,819
Technically,
I planned the whole mission.

1029
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:33,667
- A big nebula guy. How's it going?
- Oh, Jack.

1030
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:35,377
- Hi, boys.
- Doctor.

1031
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:41,174
Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack!

1032
01:34:41,258 --> 01:34:44,010
Howdy, boys. How you doing?

1033
01:34:44,095 --> 01:34:45,595
He touched me!

1034
01:34:47,572 --> 01:34:50,072
Come back to us, please!

1035
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:58,233
Good boy.

1036
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:05,115
Thank you.

1037
01:35:24,927 --> 01:35:27,011
Here we go.
