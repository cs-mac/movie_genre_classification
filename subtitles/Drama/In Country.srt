1
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:30,431
Left face!

2
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,601
Ground your gear!

3
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:41,792
<i>Gentlemen...</i>

4
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:45,307
<i>...you depart today to fight the forces</i>
<i>of godless Communism.</i>

5
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:50,457
<i>You were chosen to be leaders in a fight</i>
<i>that will never be forgotten.</i>

6
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:54,778
<i>You are chosen because you are the best.</i>

7
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:57,658
<i>Because you are the meanest.</i>

8
00:00:57,731 --> 00:01:02,368
<i>Because you are the hardest, fastest,</i>
<i>toughest sons of bitches in the world.</i>

9
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:07,067
<i>The Viet Cong will learn to respect you,</i>
<i>or he will die.</i>

10
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:11,833
<i>You will make him die</i>
<i>until he gives you that respect.</i>

11
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:16,281
<i>The Viet Cong is never going to forget you.</i>

12
00:01:16,547 --> 00:01:18,784
<i>America is never going to forget you.</i>

13
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,249
<i>God bless you.</i>

14
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:23,039
<i>I love you.</i>

15
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:26,787
<i>America loves you. You are the best.</i>

16
00:01:27,843 --> 00:01:29,469
<i>You are the chosen.</i>

17
00:01:30,403 --> 00:01:32,443
<i>Good luck and go with God.</i>

18
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:17,945
Where the fuck are we?

19
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:20,635
Blue Velvet, this is Night Cross.

20
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,385
Request medevac. Coordinates 956.

21
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:24,858
Take cover!

22
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:41,176
Let's get the fuck out of here.

23
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:59,161
<i>It will take courage.</i>

24
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:02,750
<i>Courage to face godless Communism...</i>

25
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,477
<i>...wherever it may be.</i>

26
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:07,265
<i>America used to be God's light...</i>

27
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:08,640
<i>...on this earth.</i>

28
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:11,737
<i>We were the world's Good Samaritan.</i>

29
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:14,428
<i>There was nowhere on the globe...</i>

30
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:17,815
<i>...that an American couldn't walk tall,</i>
<i>proud...</i>

31
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,670
<i>...respected, and safe.</i>

32
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,919
<i>But along the way, our world has fallen...</i>

33
00:03:26,178 --> 00:03:28,480
<i>...and our dreams have vanished.</i>

34
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:31,489
<i>We forgot our place in God's plan...</i>

35
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:33,436
<i>...for America.</i>

36
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:35,481
<i>Things need to be changed.</i>

37
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:37,693
<i>Changed for the better.</i>

38
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:39,805
<i>And it's up to you...</i>

39
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:41,921
<i>...the youth of America.</i>

40
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:48,034
<i>I congratulate you on the achievement</i>
<i>of graduation from high school.</i>

41
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:51,327
<i>May God bless every one of you...</i>

42
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:55,356
<i>...because you are the future of America.</i>

43
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:03,678
<i>Congratulations to Hopewell High's</i>
<i>class of '89.</i>

44
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:07,741
<i>Good luck, and may you all find</i>
<i>your heart's desire.</i>

45
00:04:25,954 --> 00:04:27,067
Sam!

46
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:30,648
Mom, wasn't it wonderful?

47
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:32,413
Are you proud of me?

48
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,777
Hold the pumpkin for a sec.

49
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:39,296
Let me just get a shot
of this grown-up woman. Say "cheese."

50
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,696
For God's sake. I hate cheese!

51
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:44,729
Here, take her for a minute.

52
00:04:45,762 --> 00:04:48,926
You looked cute as a bug.
I'm so proud of you.

53
00:04:49,474 --> 00:04:52,223
I wish your daddy had been here
to see you.

54
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:55,006
I think he was, Mamaw.
I felt his eyes on me.

55
00:04:56,258 --> 00:04:58,559
-You need fattening up.
-You, too.

56
00:04:59,906 --> 00:05:02,362
Congratulations.
Are you going to Murray in the fall?

57
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:06,363
No, my brother is the college boy.
I'm glad to be done high school.

58
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,789
-Everyone's meeting at the lake.
-Come pick me up.

59
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:13,120
Is that the boy who won that game
with all them jump shots?

60
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:15,837
That's Lonnie Malone, all right.

61
00:05:15,906 --> 00:05:18,273
That's Roy Bob Malone's grandson.

62
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:20,384
His mom's a Crittenden.

63
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:23,195
-See you at the lake.
-I'll meet you there.

64
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:24,673
Family group, everybody.

65
00:05:25,346 --> 00:05:26,688
You don't want me in it.

66
00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:30,682
I said everybody.
It's not everybody without you.

67
00:05:31,682 --> 00:05:35,424
Donna, let's see George's little face.
Nobody is paying for his back.

68
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:38,584
I wish you'd come live with us
instead of Emmett.

69
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,762
I can't just walk away.

70
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,809
I put up with Emmett for 13 years.

71
00:05:42,882 --> 00:05:46,177
I deserve some happiness,
so don't talk to me like that.

72
00:05:46,274 --> 00:05:47,451
Everybody ready?

73
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,725
One, two...say....

74
00:05:49,793 --> 00:05:51,386
Chubby Checker!

75
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:52,927
We forgot Emmett!

76
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:58,104
Uncle Emmett, come get your picture took.
This is history.

77
00:05:58,306 --> 00:06:00,477
I'm not ready for history.

78
00:06:00,545 --> 00:06:01,723
You look good.

79
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:05,471
She's on me again. She ruins everything.

80
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:09,181
Your mom is just doing her job.
You feel smart?

81
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:12,537
I feel like I could fly! Now, come on!

82
00:06:13,057 --> 00:06:16,221
Family portrait. Everybody looking pretty?

83
00:06:16,673 --> 00:06:19,608
One.... Too late! Got you!

84
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:14,332
Lonnie's dad says they're hiring
at the tire plant.

85
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:15,802
Fuck the tire plant.

86
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,151
Fuck the tire plant, by all means.

87
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:24,216
Jelly donut and Diet Pepsi, please!

88
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:27,609
You let her use that kind
of language at home?

89
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,742
-It's on HBO.
-You let her watch HBO?

90
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:34,623
Hell, I don't let my wife watch HBO.

91
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:37,753
Can I sit next to you, Sam?

92
00:07:38,273 --> 00:07:40,859
I swear, I ain't smelled
nothing sweet in weeks.

93
00:07:41,986 --> 00:07:44,920
You can if you show me your tattoo.

94
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:50,045
Emmett, you dog.
You told her my dark secret.

95
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:54,396
Come on out to my truck and I'll show you.

96
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:59,168
I wonder if anybody ever tattooed
his own face on his chest like on a T-shirt.

97
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,114
Why would anyone do that?

98
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:04,481
So when you're old,
people could see how you started out.

99
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:06,840
That could be a lot to live with.

100
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:10,108
What's your long-legged niece doing here?

101
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:12,507
What's her problem?

102
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:16,032
They're hiring at the tire plant.

103
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:17,848
Fuck the tire plant.

104
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:22,554
Buddy ain't coming.
His little girl is sick again.

105
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:26,528
Eggs over easy, bacon and a lot of coffee.

106
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,521
Her gut is all twisted up.
He blames Agent Orange.

107
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:34,815
He blames everything on Agent Orange.
It wasn't no big deal.

108
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:38,489
Were you sprayed with Agent Orange?

109
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:40,830
Is something wrong with Emmett?

110
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,419
He gets headaches and he can't sleep.

111
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:45,117
And he has this rash--

112
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,608
Don't be macho and pretend.

113
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:51,903
I had a place come up on my leg.
All brown and funny.

114
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:54,998
Kind of like a bruise on a banana.

115
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:58,044
But then it just went away.

116
00:08:59,585 --> 00:09:02,335
You reckon it ate clear down to my bone?

117
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,951
Nothing will hurt you.

118
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:08,282
You're like that guy on TV...ate a bicycle.

119
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:11,167
On <i>That's Incredible</i>. I saw that.

120
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:15,382
It didn't hurt him. He was going to go
to Canada and eat a helicopter.

121
00:09:17,793 --> 00:09:21,110
If I had a car,
I'd drive Emmett to the VA hospital.

122
00:09:21,953 --> 00:09:23,196
Get him checked out.

123
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:24,918
I got a car I'll sell you.

124
00:09:25,793 --> 00:09:27,931
VW bug. I'll fix it up good.

125
00:09:28,385 --> 00:09:30,108
$600.

126
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:33,150
I don't have that kind of cash.

127
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:34,746
You want a car?

128
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:36,831
I'll show you a car.

129
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:39,070
Look at that!

130
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,382
See that thing that looks like a ladybug?

131
00:09:44,224 --> 00:09:45,915
That's my old Corvette.

132
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:48,921
My wife sold it while I was gone.

133
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,286
It would be a classic now.

134
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,734
You got that right.

135
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,044
That's my house.

136
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:57,565
There's my street. This is the county.

137
00:09:57,857 --> 00:10:01,173
This could be the stupidest thing
I ever did in my life.

138
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:10,972
Nobody can eat a helicopter.
You don't know how to lie.

139
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:20,313
Hey, man, keep it long to the left.

140
00:10:22,753 --> 00:10:24,346
Think about that VW, Sam.

141
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,546
Come take a test drive
and teach me how to lie.

142
00:10:28,513 --> 00:10:29,942
See you all later!

143
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,535
Come by any time you want.

144
00:10:32,736 --> 00:10:35,453
I got tattoos in places
you never even dreamed of.

145
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,150
That true what you told me about Pete
chasing his wife with a shotgun?

146
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:48,022
She chased him.

147
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:48,990
Why?

148
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:52,063
Why does everything need a reason?

149
00:10:52,128 --> 00:10:54,332
-Because it does.
-Some things don't.

150
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:57,368
Some things just are.
You can't change them.

151
00:10:57,696 --> 00:10:59,190
I don't accept that.

152
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:03,225
Oh, you don't? How do you plan to deal
with gravity? Do you accept that?

153
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,425
Why do you got to know about Vietnam?

154
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:08,023
What do you remember about it?

155
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,989
Hey, Emmett!
Sam, you want to come with me?

156
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:13,718
I need to talk to you.

157
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:16,950
Go on.

158
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:20,891
Take her out of here, Lonnie.
She's pestering me.

159
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:23,511
You're in a mood!

160
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,822
That's good reason to be alone.

161
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:31,837
What's wrong with him?

162
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:36,509
I don't know. They all act like
there's some deep, dark secret.

163
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,456
Why aren't you at work?

164
00:11:38,976 --> 00:11:43,002
I walked in there today,
looked in Quinnie's face and thought:

165
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,906
"If I do this for 30 years,
I'll look just like him."

166
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:48,598
So I told him I quit.

167
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:53,020
He says, "We don't need you.
You're fired."

168
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,648
Wouldn't that burn your ass?

169
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,728
So you just up and quit.

170
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,906
Box boy. That ain't for me.

171
00:11:59,872 --> 00:12:02,425
I want to do something outdoors,
where I'm my own boss.

172
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:03,998
You're your own boss now.

173
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,919
I ain't too crazy about your hanging out
with Emmett's friends.

174
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:10,912
Don't worry about it.

175
00:12:10,976 --> 00:12:13,464
Those guys are still back in Vietnam.

176
00:12:14,112 --> 00:12:15,486
Not one has come to anything.

177
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,177
Shut up, Lonnie!

178
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,504
What do you think they'll do?
Snap and hold me hostage?

179
00:12:20,576 --> 00:12:22,136
You know what they say about Emmett.

180
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,663
I know what they say
about everything in Hopewell.

181
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:26,645
This town never shuts up.

182
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,810
You think I'm weird 'cause of Emmett.

183
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:34,206
You're not weird. You just think you are.

184
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:37,502
You're only half-weird.

185
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,705
I got to find me a job.

186
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:43,771
I got to get a car or else I'll go nuts.

187
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,025
Let me out. I feel like running.

188
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:10,877
I've been thinking.

189
00:13:10,944 --> 00:13:11,892
Good.

190
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:15,608
How old were you when you went over?

191
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:19,478
Old enough to know better.

192
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:21,013
How old is that?

193
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,390
A year older than you are now.

194
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:27,383
What do you remember
when you think about it?

195
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:28,860
The first thing.

196
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:33,403
There was these white birds...

197
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,343
...used to follow the water buffalo.

198
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:39,993
One for every water buffalo,
like he had a pet.

199
00:13:41,184 --> 00:13:44,926
These birds would pick the bugs
off the buffalo's head.

200
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:50,073
Sometimes one would even pick
the bugs out of his teeth.

201
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,475
One time...

202
00:13:52,575 --> 00:13:53,917
Yes, Algebra.

203
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,069
...there was this tree...

204
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:01,567
...and it was full of these white birds...

205
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:04,856
...and a grenade blew it all to hell.

206
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:09,660
These white birds went flying
out of the tree, like it was snowing.

207
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:11,511
It was beautiful.

208
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:16,476
These beautiful white birds,
going about their business...

209
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:20,312
...all this crazy stuff going on around them.

210
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:25,341
Egrets. They're called egrets.

211
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:28,022
I'd like to see one again.

212
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,683
Sam, everything's ready!

213
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:32,059
I'm coming!

214
00:14:34,527 --> 00:14:36,218
Emmett, that's neat.

215
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:45,854
-Is it numb?
-I hope so.

216
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:52,702
-Can you feel this?
-No.

217
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:56,795
I got you by surprise.

218
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:01,205
It didn't hurt that much.

219
00:15:01,663 --> 00:15:05,373
If I had a car, I could get it done
at the mall in Paducah.

220
00:15:06,015 --> 00:15:08,317
A person needs a car to be free.

221
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:11,866
Think of the money you're saving.

222
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:14,551
Will your mom shit bricks
over the second hole?

223
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,143
My mama is provincial and misguided.

224
00:15:17,342 --> 00:15:20,025
My uncle lets me do anything I want to.

225
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:25,173
Lonnie slept over three nights
since he quit his job.

226
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:29,370
My dad would shit bricks if I did that.

227
00:15:30,175 --> 00:15:31,833
You going to marry Lonnie?

228
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:34,969
He's not the main thought
on my mind right now.

229
00:15:36,511 --> 00:15:39,380
I have to find a dress to wear
to his brother's wedding.

230
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:41,627
Come help me find something.

231
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:50,620
Oh, my God! Great.

232
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:54,841
Is this your mom's old stuff?
It's like a museum.

233
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:00,413
This was never in style.
I wouldn't wear this in the dark.

234
00:16:00,735 --> 00:16:03,069
-It's too awful!
-Well, slap my thigh.

235
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:05,213
I do declare.

236
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:12,088
I have to dig up some money
for a dress to wear one time.

237
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,712
Look at these old records.
Do you listen to them?

238
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:16,376
No, my mom used to.

239
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:21,273
She'd sing along in this embarrassing way.
It drove me nuts.

240
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,966
Who are Country Joe and the Fish?

241
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:27,804
Now she's off having babies in Lexington...

242
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,533
...driving with the top down
with easy listening on the car radio...

243
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,779
...with Lorenzo Jones.

244
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:39,063
That's what I call her husband.

245
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:41,754
I guess she thinks he treats her good.

246
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,232
I'm late. But that doesn't mean anything.

247
00:16:50,495 --> 00:16:51,608
How late?

248
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:53,816
Two weeks.

249
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,341
I've been late before.

250
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,942
Why aren't you on the pill?

251
00:16:58,015 --> 00:16:59,356
I don't know.

252
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:04,890
Who's this?

253
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,588
It looks like Lonnie, only in a uniform.

254
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:15,288
-That's my dad!
-He was cute.

255
00:17:15,774 --> 00:17:18,621
He died over there just before I was born.

256
00:17:19,134 --> 00:17:21,338
I never knew she had this stuff.

257
00:17:21,534 --> 00:17:23,225
Look at these letters.

258
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:25,525
-Can we read them?
-God, no!

259
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:27,125
-Why not?
-I don't know.

260
00:17:28,574 --> 00:17:30,101
God, look at him.

261
00:17:32,382 --> 00:17:34,106
He missed everything.

262
00:17:39,102 --> 00:17:41,077
You know what I wish we could do?

263
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,084
I wish we could steal the keys
to your brother's car...

264
00:17:44,158 --> 00:17:46,646
...and drive to the Paducah Oaks Mall.

265
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:50,166
We could hang out in the bars
where the businessmen go...

266
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,343
...and wear sexy outfits.

267
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,413
We could wear black leather pants
and pink sunglasses.

268
00:17:56,062 --> 00:17:58,037
I bet they'd give us money.

269
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,413
-For sex they'll pay--
-Anything.

270
00:18:03,934 --> 00:18:05,941
This town is dead without a mall.

271
00:18:06,143 --> 00:18:07,604
Yeah, I know it.

272
00:18:12,318 --> 00:18:13,660
That's Kenny.

273
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:15,451
Does he know?

274
00:18:15,518 --> 00:18:18,268
I don't even know, do l? I'm just late.

275
00:18:20,094 --> 00:18:21,621
I'm coming! God.

276
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,099
We're the baddest girls in Hopewell!

277
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,780
"The guys were as excited as I was.

278
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,076
"I danced all....

279
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,917
"I danced all around
and they poured beer on me.

280
00:19:33,982 --> 00:19:36,949
"I dreamt maybe
I got a baby boy at home."

281
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:48,541
<i>I don't want to name it Darrell.</i>

282
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,794
<i>There was a Darrell in my outfit</i>
<i>who isn't with us anymore.</i>

283
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:54,422
<i>I'd feel it was unlucky...</i>

284
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,086
<i>...to name him Darrell.</i>

285
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,609
<i>Bill and Bob are too ordinary.</i>

286
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:02,457
<i>My favorite name is Samuel.</i>

287
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:04,504
<i>It's from the Bible.</i>

288
00:20:05,118 --> 00:20:08,020
<i>I wish you weren't going</i>
<i>through this alone.</i>

289
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,711
<i>Don't ask me to tell you how it is here.</i>

290
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:16,668
<i>You don't want to know.</i>

291
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:21,426
<i>If it's a girl, you could call it Samantha.</i>

292
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,784
-<i>This is Larry.</i>
-<i>And Irene.</i>

293
00:20:34,014 --> 00:20:36,021
-<i>Business is good.</i>
-<i>Life is great.</i>

294
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:38,711
<i>We look forward to your terrific message.</i>

295
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,442
<i>At the beep.</i>

296
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:47,925
Mom, I was looking for a dress to wear
to Lonnie's brother's wedding...

297
00:20:48,189 --> 00:20:51,255
...and found Daddy's old letters.

298
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:53,625
Why didn't you take them with you?

299
00:20:53,693 --> 00:20:58,068
What kind of person would just leave
something like that behind?

300
00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:01,269
If I loved someone,
I wouldn't leave their letters.

301
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:03,643
I'd keep them close to my heart.

302
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:11,347
You never told me he wanted a boy.
You never told me anything!

303
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:20,473
I don't even know how he died.

304
00:21:23,101 --> 00:21:25,686
Go home, Danny.
You're possessed of the devil.

305
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:27,795
Mend your evil ways, dog.

306
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:34,489
It's that kind of thing that makes
people think you're mentally alienated.

307
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:37,203
-Mentally what?
-Alienated.

308
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:39,674
-Is that what I am?
-ln a nutshell.

309
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:43,639
Did you know about these?

310
00:21:50,173 --> 00:21:51,450
Irene left them?

311
00:21:51,517 --> 00:21:53,241
Yeah. You read them?

312
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:56,310
She gave them to me a long time ago.

313
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:58,521
He writes like a kid.

314
00:21:59,966 --> 00:22:03,795
That was us. A bunch of little kids
out in the jungle. Didn't know diddly-shit.

315
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:04,949
It's hard to read.

316
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:08,088
What's a "klick"?
And what's a "Bouncing Boobie"?

317
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:10,236
Bouncing Betty.

318
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:11,545
What is it?

319
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:13,020
A cake recipe.

320
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:17,652
You ain't never going to understand it.
You don't want to.

321
00:22:21,117 --> 00:22:23,004
I want to know about it.

322
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:25,939
I got the right.

323
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,452
<i>No, I haven't seen any tigers or gorillas.</i>

324
00:22:57,917 --> 00:22:58,899
<i>It's rained...</i>

325
00:22:58,972 --> 00:23:01,972
<i>...for three months now</i>
<i>and everything is mud.</i>

326
00:23:02,844 --> 00:23:05,266
<i>Seems like we've been in country forever.</i>

327
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,333
<i>I can't tell you what we're doing...</i>

328
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:13,114
<i>...but each time we go out,</i>
<i>we push the enemy back further.</i>

329
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:17,691
<i>I dreamed maybe I got a baby boy at home.</i>

330
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:24,154
<i>I look at your picture</i>
<i>so I know it's not a dream.</i>

331
00:23:25,341 --> 00:23:27,861
<i>You're standing by the Nash Rambler.</i>

332
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:32,378
<i>It's black and white,</i>
<i>but I know you got on the red shorts.</i>

333
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:36,726
<i>The food's not good.</i>
<i>I miss Mama's fried chicken.</i>

334
00:23:38,653 --> 00:23:40,246
<i>I'm sick of beans.</i>

335
00:23:42,972 --> 00:23:45,241
<i>The world's a dream, now that I'm here.</i>

336
00:23:46,652 --> 00:23:49,434
<i>Maybe when I'm home,</i>
<i>this will be a dream.</i>

337
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,547
<i>Maybe we'll take over Daddy's farm.</i>

338
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:59,928
<i>We could build a new house by the pond.</i>

339
00:24:00,892 --> 00:24:02,866
<i>Just you, me and the baby.</i>

340
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,664
<i>I can't wait to see a picture.</i>

341
00:24:09,692 --> 00:24:11,634
<i>I hope he looks like you.</i>

342
00:24:13,116 --> 00:24:15,156
<i>My favorite name is Samuel.</i>

343
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:21,050
<i>I guess if it's a girl,</i>
<i>you could call it Samantha.</i>

344
00:24:38,588 --> 00:24:40,857
When are you going to fix that?

345
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:43,739
Not tonight. There's a tornado watch on.

346
00:24:50,684 --> 00:24:53,466
I'm making muffelatas. Want one, Lonnie?

347
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,759
I don't mind. Have a beer, Emmett.

348
00:24:58,908 --> 00:25:00,402
Where'd you get that getup?

349
00:25:00,796 --> 00:25:02,935
-It's a joke.
-I don't get it.

350
00:25:03,324 --> 00:25:05,015
Like Klinger, on <i>MASH</i>.

351
00:25:05,276 --> 00:25:07,381
I still don't get it. Have a beer.

352
00:25:07,837 --> 00:25:09,625
Where did you get these?

353
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:12,147
Well, I got them from a bootlegger.

354
00:25:25,212 --> 00:25:27,579
I'm sore about
what you said about Emmett.

355
00:25:27,643 --> 00:25:31,026
I thought you liked him.
You always acted like you did.

356
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,322
I like him fine. But how long are you going
to go on keeping house for him?

357
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:37,496
Mom wants me to move in with her.

358
00:25:37,563 --> 00:25:39,985
She's enrolled in psychology in Lexington.

359
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,645
Now she has an answer for everything.

360
00:25:43,196 --> 00:25:45,847
She wants me to go to college
with her this fall.

361
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:50,452
Tell her she can't go with her mother.
She'd be mentally alienated for life.

362
00:25:50,972 --> 00:25:52,249
What's that?

363
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,092
Take my word for it. Come and eat.

364
00:25:56,252 --> 00:25:57,299
He's right.

365
00:25:58,044 --> 00:26:00,466
You can't go. Both of us want you here.

366
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,966
What will you do now that you know
you don't want to be a box boy?

367
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:08,593
I don't know.

368
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:11,603
If you've got no family,
don't take a job from a man who does.

369
00:26:11,676 --> 00:26:16,182
Emmett, that's neat. You got
the unemployment problem worked out.

370
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,253
You're a hero by being a bum.

371
00:26:19,356 --> 00:26:20,785
I ain't no bum!

372
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,769
I won't work at no polluting tire plant.

373
00:26:23,964 --> 00:26:26,997
There are jobs you can do
without hurting anybody.

374
00:26:27,163 --> 00:26:28,537
Be a disc jockey.

375
00:26:28,604 --> 00:26:32,215
Selling things nobody needs.
Yeah, I'll be a disc jockey.

376
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,994
You been at them letters?

377
00:26:44,923 --> 00:26:45,938
What letters?

378
00:26:46,587 --> 00:26:48,660
They were out of order.
Did you read them?

379
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,659
What letters?

380
00:26:49,723 --> 00:26:51,032
Dwayne's letters?

381
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:53,042
My father's letters, yes.

382
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,681
It's okay if you did. I wanted you to.

383
00:27:02,108 --> 00:27:03,221
I read them.

384
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,787
Eat your supper, girl.

385
00:27:12,444 --> 00:27:15,062
Well? Is that what it was like?

386
00:27:16,508 --> 00:27:18,363
They don't say much, do they?

387
00:27:21,468 --> 00:27:23,093
Talk to me, Emmett.

388
00:27:29,052 --> 00:27:30,426
It's stuffy in here.

389
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,267
-It's the humidity.
-No, it's them letters!

390
00:27:36,347 --> 00:27:39,544
Jesus, it's really something out there.

391
00:27:44,027 --> 00:27:45,816
Socrates wore a skirt.

392
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:49,178
The Greeks and Romans wore dresses.

393
00:27:49,243 --> 00:27:52,691
It's healthy for a man to wear a skirt.
He ain't all cramped up.

394
00:27:55,195 --> 00:27:59,057
Burn them damn letters.
Just forget all about that damn shit.

395
00:27:59,835 --> 00:28:03,064
You're prying into something
you'll never understand. Leave it alone!

396
00:28:03,131 --> 00:28:05,814
What made you feel so bad?

397
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:08,050
They're mostly just love letters.

398
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:12,024
It's whipping up. I'll unplug some things.

399
00:28:14,043 --> 00:28:16,726
lncoming, Emmett.
Watch your ass, buddy!

400
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:20,656
Damn it!

401
00:28:20,988 --> 00:28:22,995
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

402
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:30,646
God! What is this, a tornado?

403
00:28:31,131 --> 00:28:32,822
You pay your bill, Emmett?

404
00:28:34,332 --> 00:28:36,950
-This ain't no tornado.
-It's something.

405
00:28:37,212 --> 00:28:39,219
They don't have tornadoes at night.

406
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,772
This is some kind of weird climatic event.

407
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,467
Emmett, get in here! Are you crazy?

408
00:28:52,283 --> 00:28:54,966
Emmett, don't be a damn fool!

409
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:56,442
Where are you going?

410
00:28:57,851 --> 00:28:59,193
Go for it, Emmett!

411
00:29:01,467 --> 00:29:03,158
-Go for it!
-Show me!

412
00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:07,792
Show me your face!

413
00:29:10,362 --> 00:29:12,402
Emmett, get down!

414
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:14,800
Show me your face!

415
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:40,634
I'm not afraid of that.

416
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:53,145
Burn them damn letters, Sam.
There ain't nothing in them for you.

417
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,313
What are you doing?

418
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:23,001
It looks like you're digging clear to China.

419
00:30:23,611 --> 00:30:25,651
I'm excavating, Mr. Hughes.

420
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,432
Very noble work.

421
00:30:30,554 --> 00:30:33,653
Your Egyptians and Romans
were great excavators.

422
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:39,191
And good builders, too.
That storm hit you all last night?

423
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:41,779
A couple of tree limbs down.

424
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:44,921
That old dog about lost his mind.

425
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:47,445
We'll just have to shoot it.

426
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,936
Grandpa, don't say things like that!

427
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:55,034
How are you doing?

428
00:30:55,099 --> 00:30:56,528
Help me with that.

429
00:30:56,635 --> 00:31:00,312
I brought you half a ham.
I know you don't eat right.

430
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:04,339
Having fun down there, Emmett?

431
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,570
The basement is full of water.

432
00:31:07,675 --> 00:31:10,544
If I don't find this leak,
the whole thing will cave in.

433
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:13,717
You got no drainage with these houses.

434
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:17,971
They built these all the same. Wrong.

435
00:31:18,395 --> 00:31:21,843
I brought you a damson pie,
and Emmett can't have any.

436
00:31:22,106 --> 00:31:23,535
What did he do?

437
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:25,778
He doesn't treat you right.

438
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:30,129
Look at that refrigerator!

439
00:31:33,978 --> 00:31:35,669
Rinse that off, Sam.

440
00:31:39,226 --> 00:31:41,048
You got a frog in your ditch.

441
00:31:48,314 --> 00:31:51,696
Water seeping under a house
spawns all kinds of life.

442
00:31:52,442 --> 00:31:54,384
Frogs, mosquitoes...

443
00:31:54,874 --> 00:31:57,525
...tadpoles, mud daubers...

444
00:31:58,298 --> 00:31:59,956
...dry rot, fungus...

445
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:02,425
...worms and snakes of all types.

446
00:32:04,858 --> 00:32:07,476
Emmett, I got a bone to pick with you!

447
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:09,171
What's that?

448
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:11,608
Remember those hippies
you brought to the farm...

449
00:32:11,674 --> 00:32:16,181
...that got stuck in their van trying to turn
around and they had to bull their way out...

450
00:32:16,506 --> 00:32:18,579
...by plowing through my rose garden?

451
00:32:19,163 --> 00:32:21,464
Nothing grows there to this day.

452
00:32:21,658 --> 00:32:24,146
And they never said
they was sorry or nothing.

453
00:32:24,506 --> 00:32:26,645
Mrs. Hughes, that was 12 years ago.

454
00:32:26,714 --> 00:32:29,431
It was April 14, 1972.

455
00:32:29,818 --> 00:32:34,128
Your mama ran off to Lexington
with one that looked like a wild hyena.

456
00:32:34,362 --> 00:32:36,184
I don't remember him.

457
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,439
Now she's in Lexington
with a different baby.

458
00:32:39,514 --> 00:32:43,256
There's just something about that girl
that has to wag a baby off to Lexington.

459
00:32:43,514 --> 00:32:45,336
Where did them idiots go?

460
00:32:45,658 --> 00:32:49,618
California. All the hyenas and idiots
went to California.

461
00:32:49,818 --> 00:32:51,541
Remind me never to go there.

462
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:52,726
Yes, sir.

463
00:32:52,858 --> 00:32:54,581
I'd like to go there.

464
00:32:56,217 --> 00:32:59,349
Emma, I hate to take you away
from your pleasure...

465
00:32:59,418 --> 00:33:04,055
...but we got to get them pullets
out of the sun before they die. Let's go.

466
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:09,459
You going to marry that boy
who does the jump shots?

467
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,123
Lonnie, the jumper?

468
00:33:11,577 --> 00:33:14,643
Emmett, you look real good
with a sweat on you.

469
00:33:14,969 --> 00:33:16,857
Sam, you come and visit.

470
00:33:17,274 --> 00:33:19,248
Not if you shoot your dog.

471
00:33:19,513 --> 00:33:21,040
I guess we won't.

472
00:33:23,673 --> 00:33:25,102
Let's go, Emma!

473
00:33:25,241 --> 00:33:28,918
We got to fatten you up.
I'll fix you a swamp rabbit and a cake.

474
00:33:30,714 --> 00:33:32,307
Sounds good. Yum.

475
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:36,178
Close the door! I want out of here.

476
00:33:41,658 --> 00:33:42,454
Are you?

477
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:44,943
-Am I what?
-Going to marry Lonnie?

478
00:33:46,682 --> 00:33:48,657
He can't pour piss out of a boot.

479
00:33:48,922 --> 00:33:53,078
I don't know. How do I know
what I'm going to do until I do it?

480
00:34:13,658 --> 00:34:14,901
Jesus, Sam.

481
00:34:16,698 --> 00:34:18,738
Listen, do you know that saleslady?

482
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,238
She might know me.

483
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:22,805
Thanks. She'll think it's for me.

484
00:34:22,873 --> 00:34:25,142
Well, you're not pregnant,
so it doesn't matter.

485
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:28,919
Who the hell cares anyway?
But I'm not going to pay for it.

486
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:44,976
Could I get a price check?

487
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,493
Lambert Warner test kit number 5068-A.

488
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,475
It's not this high.

489
00:34:51,546 --> 00:34:54,448
Is it the pregnancy test
or blood sugar one?

490
00:34:55,706 --> 00:34:59,765
The pregnancy!
The first day pregnancy test, 5068-A!

491
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:01,399
$14.79.

492
00:35:43,897 --> 00:35:45,490
It could be wrong.

493
00:35:46,297 --> 00:35:49,199
We could buy another one. I'll pay for it.

494
00:35:57,753 --> 00:35:59,728
I always wanted this to be a happy time.

495
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:08,977
If it does happen, we could go away.

496
00:36:09,657 --> 00:36:12,440
You could have it in Florida.
We could work at Disney World.

497
00:36:16,794 --> 00:36:18,255
I got to go.

498
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:21,209
Carswell will murder me.

499
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,159
Thanks.

500
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,863
You missed Watergate...

501
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:55,412
...<i>E.T</i>...

502
00:36:58,808 --> 00:37:02,998
...the Bruce Springsteen concert.
You missed everything.

503
00:37:09,656 --> 00:37:11,631
You were just a country boy...

504
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,822
...and you never knew me.

505
00:37:51,321 --> 00:37:52,750
Slow down, Sam.

506
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:12,562
-What are you doing here?
-I'm just passing by.

507
00:38:13,336 --> 00:38:17,264
I see you running everywhere.
Where are you going so fast, Sam?

508
00:38:17,784 --> 00:38:19,573
If I was to ask you--

509
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,728
If it's you, then tell me.
If it's a friend, tell them to see me.

510
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,182
No crapping around.
I don't give out free drugs or advice.

511
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:30,742
Who are you going with now?

512
00:38:30,903 --> 00:38:33,718
That boy who won the Libertyville game.

513
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,887
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

514
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:41,555
Lonnie is not the main thing on my mind.
I want Emmett to see a doctor.

515
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:43,152
What's wrong?

516
00:38:43,384 --> 00:38:47,759
He gets these headaches and he's got
these rashes. You know how he is.

517
00:38:48,344 --> 00:38:52,567
He gets in crazy moods.
It's not just one thing, it's a lot of things.

518
00:38:53,304 --> 00:38:57,777
He'll never look after himself.
He should get his eyes checked.

519
00:38:57,912 --> 00:39:00,662
I'll give you the name of a skin doctor...

520
00:39:00,728 --> 00:39:03,412
...and an eye doctor I want him to see.

521
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,549
You going to the veterans' dance?

522
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:07,406
Nobody asked me.

523
00:39:07,736 --> 00:39:09,361
Are you seeing anybody?

524
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:12,367
I'm dating a policeman from Benton.

525
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:16,951
His idea of a good time is to buy a six-pack
and drive a truck into a ditch.

526
00:39:17,848 --> 00:39:19,441
He's getting possessive.

527
00:39:19,512 --> 00:39:22,261
When they get that way,
I just have to get out.

528
00:39:23,768 --> 00:39:26,866
That's why I like Emmett.
He didn't give a damn.

529
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:30,067
That made me possessive.
I just had to have him.

530
00:39:31,512 --> 00:39:34,359
I'm glad to see you're taking care of him.

531
00:39:35,512 --> 00:39:36,974
Come over some time.

532
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:39,214
"Said the spider to the fly."

533
00:39:39,288 --> 00:39:41,589
I'll get Emmett to make lasagna.

534
00:39:42,776 --> 00:39:44,117
I don't know.

535
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,452
Why? Don't you like lasagna?

536
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,821
Yeah, I like it well enough.

537
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,821
Come help me get Emmett interested
in the veterans' dance.

538
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:57,101
I want to go in honor of my daddy.

539
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:59,635
And I don't want to go alone.

540
00:40:04,825 --> 00:40:05,523
Maybe.

541
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:09,107
My mom never told me anything
about my daddy...

542
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,716
...what he was like
or what his favorite foods were.

543
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,528
My mom acts like the Vietnam war
was in the Dark Ages.

544
00:40:17,112 --> 00:40:19,381
It was the dark ages, Sam.

545
00:40:20,472 --> 00:40:21,454
Will you come?

546
00:40:23,736 --> 00:40:26,453
We'll see if Emmett remembers
how to dance.

547
00:40:35,255 --> 00:40:37,557
Your mama called from Lexington.

548
00:40:38,296 --> 00:40:41,525
She wants to know why you left
that lousy message.

549
00:40:42,264 --> 00:40:44,369
I'm not ready to talk to her yet.

550
00:40:44,663 --> 00:40:46,322
What was the message?

551
00:40:46,392 --> 00:40:48,115
-Did you eat?
-Ain't hungry.

552
00:40:48,183 --> 00:40:50,158
-You feed Moonpie?
-Fed him.

553
00:40:50,232 --> 00:40:53,428
-Anita gave me some doctors' names.
-I've been to the doctors.

554
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:55,600
-What did they say?
-Not much.

555
00:40:56,023 --> 00:40:58,870
-Did you tell them about the headaches?
-I did.

556
00:40:59,479 --> 00:41:02,032
-Can't they add two and two?
-Higher than that.

557
00:41:02,903 --> 00:41:05,653
They know where the bank is,
and where it ain't.

558
00:41:05,847 --> 00:41:07,789
-I don't get you.
-That's okay.

559
00:41:08,023 --> 00:41:09,550
Would you go to these doctors?

560
00:41:09,623 --> 00:41:11,412
If you leave me alone.

561
00:41:11,543 --> 00:41:13,332
Boy, are you difficult.

562
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:14,573
I know.

563
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,418
There's your future. Franchised medicine.

564
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:24,692
McDoctors.

565
00:41:25,176 --> 00:41:26,321
Doc-in-a-box.

566
00:41:26,968 --> 00:41:28,342
Bob's Big Doc.

567
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,604
Very funny.

568
00:41:38,615 --> 00:41:41,681
Mr. Smith, the doctor is waiting for you.

569
00:41:42,807 --> 00:41:43,985
Come on.

570
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:45,774
Your order is up.

571
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:48,627
Go get your Whopper.

572
00:41:58,743 --> 00:42:00,915
I'm going up to the lake with the guys.

573
00:42:00,984 --> 00:42:02,260
That's nice.

574
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,662
I need a token of your affection.

575
00:42:13,111 --> 00:42:14,224
What for?

576
00:42:15,127 --> 00:42:19,055
It's a stag party for my brother.
We're all bringing something.

577
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,661
Can I have a pair of your panties?

578
00:42:24,855 --> 00:42:26,284
The black ones?

579
00:42:27,031 --> 00:42:28,275
That's ridiculous.

580
00:42:28,343 --> 00:42:29,270
What?

581
00:42:29,942 --> 00:42:33,936
It will show you care about me.
It will make me think about you.

582
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:36,597
$63!

583
00:42:41,207 --> 00:42:42,134
Well?

584
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:43,379
Well what?

585
00:42:43,447 --> 00:42:44,909
What did he say?

586
00:42:45,336 --> 00:42:46,612
Dr. McShaft?

587
00:42:47,991 --> 00:42:51,090
He said I got to wash my face
10 times a day...

588
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:54,320
...or perhaps it is something I ate.

589
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:57,583
Or perhaps it's something
around the house, like an allergy.

590
00:42:59,447 --> 00:43:03,221
I figured he would ask about cats,
so I said we didn't have any.

591
00:43:04,823 --> 00:43:08,238
I asked how many lab rats he killed
to figure all this out.

592
00:43:11,735 --> 00:43:13,458
Did he give you any medication?

593
00:43:13,527 --> 00:43:17,237
No, he gave me one
of them damn TV-doctor smiles...

594
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:21,617
...and said, "Mr. Smith,
I believe it's all in your head."

595
00:43:22,775 --> 00:43:25,775
I said, "Doc, tell me something
I don't know."

596
00:43:26,742 --> 00:43:28,401
How will you get it out?

597
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,939
There has to be a way.

598
00:44:08,695 --> 00:44:10,386
Jumping Jesus, girl.

599
00:44:12,343 --> 00:44:13,969
Don't come up on a man that way.

600
00:44:14,103 --> 00:44:18,031
Sorry, I didn't mean to sneak up on you.
I just wanted to look at that bug.

601
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:24,206
Check it out.

602
00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:25,936
That's it?

603
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,449
Why get a car if you run all the time?

604
00:44:34,871 --> 00:44:37,838
Everybody wants a car,
so you can go places.

605
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:41,971
Are you sure you don't want a dirt bike?
It's a lot cheaper.

606
00:44:42,134 --> 00:44:45,517
You can drive them in the dirt,
fall off, it don't hurt much.

607
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:49,230
I put one together. I wreck it.
I just put another one together.

608
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:52,367
Don't mean nothing.

609
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,705
Everything means something.

610
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:57,685
Are you always so serious?

611
00:44:58,294 --> 00:45:02,898
You ever feel like the world's falling apart
and people only care about their part?

612
00:45:03,414 --> 00:45:05,934
Nobody does anything
about what's really wrong.

613
00:45:06,326 --> 00:45:07,340
Scares me.

614
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,934
What are you scared will happen?

615
00:45:15,735 --> 00:45:16,978
I'm scared for Emmett.

616
00:45:18,454 --> 00:45:22,099
Emmett's a character.
He's probably not easy to live with.

617
00:45:22,775 --> 00:45:25,142
-Did he find his bird?
-The egret?

618
00:45:26,326 --> 00:45:28,213
There are eagles at Reelfoot Lake.

619
00:45:28,279 --> 00:45:32,239
He's seen eagles.
He's looking for an egret.

620
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:36,304
I know. Some things
we can't stop thinking about.

621
00:45:37,783 --> 00:45:39,725
I got a friend who thinks he'll snap.

622
00:45:39,798 --> 00:45:41,173
Lonnie Malone?

623
00:45:41,494 --> 00:45:42,868
Yes, sir.

624
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:46,289
What does Lonnie Malone know
about those things?

625
00:45:46,454 --> 00:45:48,341
He needs a map to find the bathroom.

626
00:45:49,654 --> 00:45:51,443
-You going to get married?
-No.

627
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,615
I heard you were. ln September.

628
00:45:54,038 --> 00:45:55,412
Why don't you get married?

629
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:58,352
Why don't any of you vets
get along with women?

630
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,042
Ask Emmett.

631
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:04,693
Besides, I never said I didn't like women.

632
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:09,227
Emmett says you got wounded. How?

633
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:14,736
Me and this piece of shrapnel tried
to occupy a space at the same time.

634
00:46:15,478 --> 00:46:19,918
See? Sarcastic!
It's so hard to get an answer to anything.

635
00:46:20,022 --> 00:46:24,462
You might as well stop asking
about the war. Nobody gives a shit.

636
00:46:24,693 --> 00:46:28,469
I do. My daddy died there
and I want to know what happened.

637
00:46:28,567 --> 00:46:30,705
Nobody will tell me anything.

638
00:46:33,238 --> 00:46:36,621
You weren't there.
You can't understand it.

639
00:46:42,326 --> 00:46:45,195
You want to take a test ride?
Come on, pump it.

640
00:47:19,734 --> 00:47:22,516
Your daddy was a good boy. Not wild.

641
00:47:23,797 --> 00:47:26,732
Him and your mama
made a good-looking couple.

642
00:47:27,574 --> 00:47:29,679
I don't know much about him.

643
00:47:32,757 --> 00:47:34,546
He was the quiet type.

644
00:47:35,445 --> 00:47:37,333
What did he like to eat?

645
00:47:38,294 --> 00:47:40,879
Everything we didn't have over there.

646
00:47:41,077 --> 00:47:42,603
Did he like lasagna?

647
00:47:48,278 --> 00:47:50,514
This music really takes me back.

648
00:47:51,542 --> 00:47:53,745
I used to like <i>White Rabbit</i>.

649
00:48:05,077 --> 00:48:07,499
Bobby Ray, take that with you
on your ride.

650
00:48:10,133 --> 00:48:13,199
They would put one of these cards
on his chest.

651
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:15,696
The Navy SEALS did that, too.

652
00:48:16,118 --> 00:48:18,027
This is the Purple Heart.

653
00:48:18,358 --> 00:48:21,325
These are my Vietnam medals.

654
00:48:22,806 --> 00:48:24,082
What's this?

655
00:48:24,597 --> 00:48:26,386
The Bronze Star medal.

656
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:27,891
What's it for?

657
00:48:28,277 --> 00:48:30,000
For bravery, I guess.

658
00:48:30,165 --> 00:48:31,791
-Is it yours?
-Yes, ma'am.

659
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:34,611
Ho-Ho-Ho Chi Minh, boys!

660
00:48:36,341 --> 00:48:39,887
You know my wife, Cindy.
The Corvette salesman.

661
00:48:42,133 --> 00:48:43,759
This is Sam. Emmett's keeper.

662
00:48:44,501 --> 00:48:47,283
I wouldn't have the nerve
to wear all those earrings.

663
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:50,993
I wouldn't have the nerve
to chase someone with a shotgun.

664
00:48:51,093 --> 00:48:52,816
You heard about that?

665
00:48:53,076 --> 00:48:54,189
Oh, hell.

666
00:48:55,477 --> 00:48:59,568
Sometimes you need some drama
just to get some people's attention.

667
00:49:01,557 --> 00:49:05,071
I'll take the cheese log to the food table
and get us some beer.

668
00:49:09,782 --> 00:49:13,491
Sam, don't you tell Cindy
I showed you my tattoo.

669
00:49:14,486 --> 00:49:16,624
Why? What will she do to me?

670
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:20,692
That ain't the question.
It's what she'd do to me.

671
00:49:26,933 --> 00:49:28,820
Better than ham and motherfuckers.

672
00:49:28,885 --> 00:49:32,911
I'll never eat them again.
I can't go near ham nor beans of any kind.

673
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:35,915
Sue Ann ain't coming.

674
00:49:36,085 --> 00:49:36,881
Why not?

675
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:38,858
She started the Jesus diet...

676
00:49:39,029 --> 00:49:42,509
...and figured there'd be a ton of pies
and cakes here.

677
00:49:43,221 --> 00:49:45,009
What's the Jesus diet?

678
00:49:45,365 --> 00:49:48,846
Sue Ann made a pledge to Jesus
to lay off the calories.

679
00:49:49,364 --> 00:49:53,009
"You can cheat on yourself," she says,
"but not on Jesus."

680
00:49:53,429 --> 00:49:55,469
She didn't want to test her faith?

681
00:49:55,861 --> 00:49:57,748
The truth is, she didn't want to come.

682
00:49:57,812 --> 00:50:02,285
I didn't either, except this is
the first recognition the town ever gave.

683
00:50:02,837 --> 00:50:04,811
We didn't even get a parade.

684
00:50:04,917 --> 00:50:07,819
Did you see the Vietnam Memorial
in Washington?

685
00:50:07,956 --> 00:50:12,266
The damn hole in the ground?
No, that's like living in the past.

686
00:50:12,597 --> 00:50:14,964
I'm living in the future...

687
00:50:15,348 --> 00:50:17,519
...not back in a war we couldn't win.

688
00:50:17,716 --> 00:50:18,643
Correction.

689
00:50:19,252 --> 00:50:21,457
A war they did not let us win.

690
00:50:21,973 --> 00:50:24,395
We could have paved
that motherfucker over...

691
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:27,601
...put in a McDonalds, if they'd have let us.

692
00:50:27,701 --> 00:50:31,117
If Johnson had declared war,
we could have.

693
00:50:31,189 --> 00:50:32,978
If he had as he should have--

694
00:50:33,045 --> 00:50:36,394
That's what I mean.
You still want to win it.

695
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,988
-It ain't about that.
-This is sick.

696
00:50:39,413 --> 00:50:43,341
Look at all these flags and pictures.
Why have it? This is stupid.

697
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:46,192
Lay off it.

698
00:50:46,837 --> 00:50:48,560
-Lay off it?
-Lay off it.

699
00:50:48,788 --> 00:50:52,814
Be careful, Earl. Pete may whack you
with his cheese log.

700
00:50:53,813 --> 00:50:55,154
Emmett Smith.

701
00:50:57,813 --> 00:50:59,536
How the hell are you?

702
00:51:03,604 --> 00:51:05,514
You look like a Kentucky redbird.

703
00:51:05,749 --> 00:51:08,683
And I am flying tonight.

704
00:51:08,821 --> 00:51:13,130
Sam, you look darling.
I love those earrings.

705
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:14,666
Yours are cute, too.

706
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:16,017
Thank you.

707
00:51:16,821 --> 00:51:21,163
Why, Emmett, you are just nesting
right into the floor.

708
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:24,690
You want to dance before you grow roots?

709
00:51:40,917 --> 00:51:42,739
What are you laughing at?

710
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:44,555
At you, Emmett.

711
00:51:59,861 --> 00:52:01,322
Go, Emmett, go!

712
00:52:07,764 --> 00:52:11,408
I'm glad you came.
I almost thought you wouldn't make it.

713
00:52:11,733 --> 00:52:13,194
I almost didn't.

714
00:52:15,156 --> 00:52:16,683
Where's your boyfriend?

715
00:52:16,756 --> 00:52:20,334
What boyfriend?
I got my dancing shoes on!

716
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,078
Maybe later. I'm feeling a bit stiff.

717
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:27,890
I'll get you something to drink.

718
00:52:33,332 --> 00:52:36,561
Come on!
Let's give your dancing shoes a workout!

719
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:47,247
Pete won't leave Earl alone
and EarI's looking for a fight.

720
00:52:47,668 --> 00:52:49,042
Does Earl drink a lot?

721
00:52:49,108 --> 00:52:51,563
He shouldn't drink at all.
He's got liver trouble.

722
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:55,179
Those earrings are so cute.

723
00:52:56,597 --> 00:52:58,702
They remind me
of what they did over there.

724
00:52:58,773 --> 00:52:59,721
What?

725
00:53:00,437 --> 00:53:02,640
You're too young to know this.

726
00:53:03,317 --> 00:53:07,310
They cut off the ears of the Viet Cong
to prove they killed them.

727
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,471
They brought them home as a souvenir.
Pete had some in a glass jar.

728
00:53:12,212 --> 00:53:15,311
They were like little mouse ears.
Kind of sweet-looking.

729
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:20,334
I didn't think about it for years,
then one day they got to me.

730
00:53:20,628 --> 00:53:23,213
So I made him put them in the garage.

731
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:41,162
Did you collect ears off the dead?

732
00:53:43,603 --> 00:53:45,807
Where did you hear about that?

733
00:53:48,372 --> 00:53:49,451
Did you?

734
00:53:52,307 --> 00:53:53,452
Some guys did.

735
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:56,589
Did you have a girl back home
who wrote you sexy letters?

736
00:53:58,963 --> 00:53:59,890
Yeah.

737
00:54:00,883 --> 00:54:02,312
Anybody I know?

738
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:05,164
She wasn't from around here.

739
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:09,041
She wouldn't have fit
into my story anyway.

740
00:54:10,131 --> 00:54:11,505
What is your story?

741
00:54:14,421 --> 00:54:15,827
There goes Earl.

742
00:54:16,084 --> 00:54:19,565
-You need professional help!
-Don't tell me about that!

743
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,151
Let me go!

744
00:54:36,372 --> 00:54:38,160
What's wrong with you?

745
00:54:41,715 --> 00:54:42,664
Let him go.

746
00:54:51,508 --> 00:54:52,653
You okay, killer?

747
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,906
This is bullshit.

748
00:54:58,707 --> 00:55:00,976
It's ruining a good party, too.

749
00:55:04,147 --> 00:55:06,089
Both of you, shake hands.

750
00:55:08,147 --> 00:55:09,129
Go on.

751
00:55:11,795 --> 00:55:13,039
Shake his hand, Earl.

752
00:55:32,212 --> 00:55:34,099
I could have killed you.

753
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:15,920
What's wrong?

754
00:58:21,075 --> 00:58:22,668
It's not you, Sam.

755
00:58:29,555 --> 00:58:30,635
It's me.

756
00:58:52,307 --> 00:58:54,728
I shouldn't have brought you here.

757
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:57,584
You didn't bring me here.
I made you bring me.

758
00:58:59,986 --> 00:59:01,928
Did I do something wrong?

759
00:59:02,386 --> 00:59:03,214
No.

760
00:59:05,554 --> 00:59:06,895
It's just me.

761
00:59:08,786 --> 00:59:09,964
You see...

762
00:59:10,258 --> 00:59:13,356
...my mind takes me where
I don't want to go.

763
00:59:17,298 --> 00:59:19,240
It ain't your fault, Sam.

764
00:59:24,114 --> 00:59:25,456
It's just me.

765
00:59:34,258 --> 00:59:35,338
Hold me.

766
00:59:45,459 --> 00:59:47,182
Just stay real close.

767
01:00:17,746 --> 01:00:19,786
Thanks for everything, Jim.

768
01:00:20,593 --> 01:00:22,186
I thought it went real well.

769
01:00:26,386 --> 01:00:28,361
I thought more would come.

770
01:00:29,649 --> 01:00:32,399
Hardly anyone came
who wasn't in country.

771
01:00:33,554 --> 01:00:35,408
People just don't care.

772
01:00:35,921 --> 01:00:38,288
To them, it's like Vietnam never happened.

773
01:00:43,827 --> 01:00:46,282
Take your daddy's picture with you.

774
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:49,069
I'm not responsible for that.

775
01:00:50,162 --> 01:00:52,169
Thanks again. See you.

776
01:01:38,225 --> 01:01:39,087
Emmett?

777
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:01,931
Damn you!

778
01:02:46,161 --> 01:02:48,201
-There you are.
-What are you doing back?

779
01:02:48,273 --> 01:02:49,287
Get in.

780
01:02:54,385 --> 01:02:56,327
We cut the weekend short.

781
01:02:56,753 --> 01:03:00,583
But we had a high time at the stag party,
what I remember of it.

782
01:03:01,457 --> 01:03:03,312
Your panties was a real hit.

783
01:03:03,409 --> 01:03:07,206
Great. Did you take pictures
and pass them around?

784
01:03:07,313 --> 01:03:09,582
Come on, Sam. What's going on?

785
01:03:10,289 --> 01:03:12,591
Emmett's been missing
for two whole days.

786
01:03:13,296 --> 01:03:15,500
I'm tired of taking care of him.

787
01:03:15,568 --> 01:03:17,991
I'm tired of everybody's troubles.

788
01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:22,505
Here.

789
01:03:30,258 --> 01:03:31,370
What's this?

790
01:03:31,826 --> 01:03:34,281
-Your friendship ring.
-I know that.

791
01:03:35,921 --> 01:03:36,968
What does it mean?

792
01:03:38,801 --> 01:03:40,524
It means I'm confused.

793
01:03:48,945 --> 01:03:53,102
I'm not throwing a shit fit over this
because I don't think you mean it.

794
01:03:53,552 --> 01:03:55,145
You're just acting crazy again.

795
01:04:00,432 --> 01:04:02,734
You know what I'll do with this?

796
01:04:06,321 --> 01:04:07,782
Throw it in the lake.

797
01:04:08,816 --> 01:04:11,085
I don't want any other girl wearing it.

798
01:04:12,945 --> 01:04:14,221
You hear me?

799
01:04:17,168 --> 01:04:18,543
Want me to take you home?

800
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:23,691
You can if you don't hate me.
I don't hate you.

801
01:05:07,249 --> 01:05:08,329
Moonpie.

802
01:05:10,641 --> 01:05:13,096
Where is he, Moonpie? Go find him.

803
01:05:16,753 --> 01:05:18,127
Jesus, Emmett.

804
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,760
Did you have a heart attack
and die down here?

805
01:05:33,104 --> 01:05:34,216
God, Mom!

806
01:05:35,312 --> 01:05:37,199
Sam, what are you doing?

807
01:05:38,384 --> 01:05:39,661
Looking for Emmett.

808
01:05:40,048 --> 01:05:42,088
I got him in the car.

809
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,778
Come out of there. I want to see you.

810
01:05:46,352 --> 01:05:49,548
Why didn't you call me?
You must've known I was worried.

811
01:05:50,448 --> 01:05:53,351
He showed up at my place late last night...

812
01:05:53,841 --> 01:05:56,427
...so drunk he was about to pass out.

813
01:05:58,033 --> 01:06:00,935
I've had to put up with this since we left.

814
01:06:02,096 --> 01:06:05,031
A guy in a pickup left him.
Larry was asleep.

815
01:06:05,136 --> 01:06:07,111
Don't cry. I know you're hungry, baby.

816
01:06:07,185 --> 01:06:10,501
I was watching
<i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i>.

817
01:06:10,577 --> 01:06:13,294
Did you see it?
The new movie, not the old one.

818
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,392
I never got to see how it turned out.

819
01:06:16,464 --> 01:06:17,708
They all get snatched.

820
01:06:18,609 --> 01:06:21,642
I thought they might,
but it didn't seem right.

821
01:06:21,872 --> 01:06:24,872
You had to pierce them ears again,
didn't you?

822
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,037
Look at this house. It's a dump.

823
01:06:29,744 --> 01:06:32,810
I should sell it.
I'd be happy if I never saw it again.

824
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,254
Don't you want to see me?

825
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,419
Not if you leave hurtful messages
on my machine.

826
01:06:38,896 --> 01:06:40,172
You read the letters?

827
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,022
-Every one.
-What did they say? I forget.

828
01:06:44,336 --> 01:06:48,230
Sam, we were married a month
before he left and I never saw him again.

829
01:06:48,368 --> 01:06:50,408
I hardly even remember him.

830
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,596
If I loved somebody,
I'd cherish them forever.

831
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:57,901
Life goes on.

832
01:07:00,336 --> 01:07:02,376
Your grandma has his diaries.

833
01:07:03,056 --> 01:07:04,910
I didn't have the heart to read them.

834
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:08,204
It hurt too much and now,
it doesn't matter the way it does to you.

835
01:07:08,272 --> 01:07:09,832
That baby is hungry.

836
01:07:10,063 --> 01:07:12,912
-How did he die?
-They don't tell you that.

837
01:07:14,704 --> 01:07:17,803
They just say, "ln the line of duty."

838
01:07:17,873 --> 01:07:19,629
They don't want you to know.

839
01:07:19,856 --> 01:07:24,493
Come up and go to college with me.
You've got to register by next month.

840
01:07:25,488 --> 01:07:27,212
What's Lorenzo up to?

841
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,254
Must you call him Lorenzo?

842
01:07:29,328 --> 01:07:32,230
Larry is with his brother, fixing the roof.

843
01:07:33,872 --> 01:07:36,719
What keeps you here?
That basketball boy?

844
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,873
You telling stories on me?

845
01:07:42,287 --> 01:07:46,379
You explain yourself.
Anita and me were worried sick.

846
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:49,163
Anita Stevens? She on the loose again?

847
01:07:52,336 --> 01:07:55,652
My body was entered by aliens
and I was transported.

848
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,196
Stinky baby.

849
01:07:57,584 --> 01:08:01,032
I mean it. I was going to call
the <i>National Enquirer</i>.

850
01:08:01,616 --> 01:08:04,714
I was materialized on Irene's doorstep.

851
01:08:05,616 --> 01:08:07,820
She rescued me, so it's a happy ending.

852
01:08:08,111 --> 01:08:09,485
Listen to him.

853
01:08:09,871 --> 01:08:13,799
Did all the bodies get snatched?
Usually they find a way out.

854
01:08:14,575 --> 01:08:16,102
Nobody got saved.

855
01:08:16,784 --> 01:08:19,533
Emmett, can't you tell a straight story?

856
01:08:21,327 --> 01:08:23,051
It ain't nothing to tell.

857
01:08:24,624 --> 01:08:26,053
Anita and me...

858
01:08:26,671 --> 01:08:30,316
...and Pete and Cindy met at McDonald's
and messed around.

859
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:34,219
Then I ran into Earl,
who was going to the lake.

860
01:08:34,704 --> 01:08:38,249
He had a six-pack, so I thought,
"What the hell?"

861
01:08:38,608 --> 01:08:41,291
But he was staying the week,
so he dumped me off.

862
01:08:47,344 --> 01:08:48,653
That's all, folks.

863
01:08:53,935 --> 01:08:55,179
Where's Moonpie?

864
01:08:55,247 --> 01:08:57,135
He went looking for you.

865
01:09:01,167 --> 01:09:03,436
Why don't you go get washed up?

866
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,491
I'll make your bed.
You don't want to drive back tonight.

867
01:09:09,647 --> 01:09:12,516
What a stinky baby.
Are you a stinky baby?

868
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,185
Look at this place.

869
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:24,968
I wish you'd clear all this out
and have a yard sale.

870
01:09:26,031 --> 01:09:28,300
Where's the flag from his casket?

871
01:09:28,655 --> 01:09:31,240
God. Emmett made a cape out of it.

872
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:35,916
That's when Emmett's crazy friends
were here. I was so mad at him.

873
01:09:39,791 --> 01:09:43,053
That friend of Emmett's
you went to Lexington with.

874
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:45,734
Did you love him?

875
01:09:45,808 --> 01:09:47,783
I thought I cared for him.

876
01:09:48,176 --> 01:09:50,412
Everyone was mad at me,
like I should stay...

877
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:54,473
...an old maid forever in memory
of your dad. Emmett had a fit.

878
01:09:55,664 --> 01:09:57,452
Grandpa went to war.

879
01:09:57,776 --> 01:10:00,678
He never came back
all twisted out of shape.

880
01:10:00,976 --> 01:10:02,831
That war was different.

881
01:10:03,983 --> 01:10:06,285
Those were just different times.

882
01:10:25,103 --> 01:10:26,379
Listen, Sam.

883
01:10:27,343 --> 01:10:29,961
Larry has a friend who was in Vietnam.

884
01:10:30,863 --> 01:10:32,968
He killed a whole family in a hut.

885
01:10:34,734 --> 01:10:36,327
Don't you want it?

886
01:10:37,647 --> 01:10:42,120
A mother, a father, three children,
some uncles, aunts and a grandmother.

887
01:10:43,055 --> 01:10:44,844
He killed all of them.

888
01:10:45,519 --> 01:10:49,545
And he said it took two years
for what he did to hit him. But...

889
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:54,758
...he realized all he could do was live life
in the most productive way.

890
01:10:55,439 --> 01:10:59,847
He's married, has kids.
He joined a church and he tithes.

891
01:11:00,462 --> 01:11:02,186
That's all he can do.

892
01:11:06,991 --> 01:11:08,453
Did Daddy kill like that?

893
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:11,661
I don't know.

894
01:11:11,983 --> 01:11:16,139
It wouldn't be unusual if he did.
That's what they were sent to do.

895
01:11:21,519 --> 01:11:22,696
Come here.

896
01:11:33,775 --> 01:11:36,142
Don't let them load you up, baby.

897
01:11:36,878 --> 01:11:40,042
I had many years with Emmett
to think about this.

898
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:43,337
You don't owe anyone
just because they love you.

899
01:12:15,054 --> 01:12:18,502
Tom, this is my mom. Is my car ready?

900
01:12:24,815 --> 01:12:25,862
That's it?

901
01:12:26,031 --> 01:12:28,202
$600? Is it okay to drive?

902
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:32,995
I overhauled the transmission myself.
I'll guarantee it.

903
01:12:34,799 --> 01:12:36,708
She don't have to buy it.

904
01:12:36,879 --> 01:12:40,140
I wasn't inferring anything.
It's just not what I expected.

905
01:12:40,207 --> 01:12:42,410
Mom, it's exactly what I want.

906
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:47,466
-All right.
-Thank you!

907
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:50,317
I'll get the papers.
I got them all made out.

908
01:12:51,662 --> 01:12:53,549
Did you go out with him?

909
01:12:53,678 --> 01:12:55,533
God, what a question.

910
01:12:55,982 --> 01:12:59,844
I hope it's a passing fancy.
He's too old and full of trouble.

911
01:13:00,366 --> 01:13:02,733
-How can you see that?
-I just do.

912
01:13:04,335 --> 01:13:07,498
I'm going to be late.
Larry will have a shit fit.

913
01:13:12,014 --> 01:13:14,470
You don't have to live with me
to go to college.

914
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:16,812
You don't have to move
because I bought the car.

915
01:13:17,486 --> 01:13:19,820
-Just come up and visit.
-Okay, Mom.

916
01:13:20,942 --> 01:13:23,081
All you got to do is sign it.

917
01:13:27,502 --> 01:13:29,290
Nice to meet you, Tom.

918
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:31,623
Careful now, you hear?

919
01:13:36,302 --> 01:13:37,546
Yes, ma'am.

920
01:13:38,605 --> 01:13:40,461
-Drive safely.
-I will.

921
01:13:41,678 --> 01:13:43,980
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

922
01:13:52,175 --> 01:13:55,241
The keys are in the car.
Here's your pink slip.

923
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:00,870
You want to take a test ride
and check me out?

924
01:14:01,742 --> 01:14:03,847
Your boyfriend might see us.

925
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:06,757
I got rid of him.

926
01:14:12,366 --> 01:14:14,188
Why are you giving me a hard time?

927
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:19,594
I had a good time the other night.

928
01:14:19,662 --> 01:14:21,964
You just need to get used to me.

929
01:14:24,206 --> 01:14:26,093
You drive careful, you hear?

930
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,607
Oh, my God! When did you get it?

931
01:14:57,774 --> 01:14:58,756
Today.

932
01:15:00,014 --> 01:15:03,429
It's beautiful. And a convertible, too!

933
01:15:03,982 --> 01:15:06,252
Your mom really bought it for you?

934
01:15:06,542 --> 01:15:08,582
Let's paint it pink! Pink!

935
01:15:15,053 --> 01:15:17,093
-So you like it?
-I love it!

936
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:20,710
-What's wrong?
-I don't want to talk about it.

937
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:22,920
I'm sorry. I have good news.

938
01:15:23,182 --> 01:15:24,644
You got your period?

939
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:29,028
I got up my courage and told Ken
about the baby.

940
01:15:29,517 --> 01:15:33,129
At first he was shocked,
but then he was happy!

941
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:36,901
You didn't plan it.
You didn't want this baby.

942
01:15:36,974 --> 01:15:40,170
Are you going to tell it,
it was an accident when it grows up?

943
01:15:40,237 --> 01:15:44,067
Babies should be born
because they're wanted, not--

944
01:15:44,142 --> 01:15:46,084
I want it! Ken wants it.

945
01:15:46,189 --> 01:15:48,906
Dawn, if I was you,
I'd get an abortion for your own good.

946
01:15:56,813 --> 01:15:59,595
I'm going to pretend you didn't say that.

947
01:16:01,069 --> 01:16:02,957
God, I couldn't do that.

948
01:16:05,037 --> 01:16:07,241
I'm happy, Sam. I'm happy.

949
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:09,956
Can't you be happy for me?

950
01:16:11,917 --> 01:16:14,503
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it, really.

951
01:16:14,638 --> 01:16:16,743
I was thinking about myself.

952
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:19,724
You be happy, you hear?

953
01:16:22,669 --> 01:16:24,742
What's going to happen to you, Sam?

954
01:16:39,085 --> 01:16:40,514
Hi, Aunt Donna!

955
01:16:43,981 --> 01:16:45,956
Mama! It's little Sam.

956
01:16:59,917 --> 01:17:03,463
-How are you doing? You're looking good.
-How have you been, honey?

957
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:06,530
-Where did you get that thing?
-Mom got it for me.

958
01:17:07,021 --> 01:17:09,868
How's Mamaw and Aunt Donna?
I've missed them.

959
01:17:09,933 --> 01:17:11,210
Are the biscuits ready?

960
01:17:11,277 --> 01:17:13,546
I've got the chicken. You get the rest.

961
01:17:15,181 --> 01:17:17,864
Joe, tell Sam about Dwayne.

962
01:17:18,253 --> 01:17:20,195
She wants to know more about her daddy.

963
01:17:20,749 --> 01:17:23,618
I remember when he first brought
your mother here.

964
01:17:23,788 --> 01:17:26,788
She was a skinny little squirt,
like you once was.

965
01:17:27,405 --> 01:17:29,193
It was just after I was born.

966
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:33,287
I used to get so tickled at her.
Once she brought a kite.

967
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:38,219
And if she didn't run out in her high heels
and fly that kite, I'm not here.

968
01:17:47,405 --> 01:17:48,867
Did he love her?

969
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:53,223
They was young. When you're young,
you don't know what you really feel.

970
01:17:54,157 --> 01:17:56,939
But I saw how she felt
when the news come.

971
01:17:57,197 --> 01:18:00,099
She was carrying you.
She was big as a barn.

972
01:18:01,261 --> 01:18:02,984
Was there a big funeral?

973
01:18:03,085 --> 01:18:06,762
It was a closed casket.
They told us not to open and look.

974
01:18:06,988 --> 01:18:10,850
That was hard, because you're supposed
to watch over the body.

975
01:18:11,213 --> 01:18:13,962
It's something that brings you together.

976
01:18:14,476 --> 01:18:17,127
It was like he wasn't there
'cause we couldn't see him.

977
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:20,421
The neighbors started bringing food.

978
01:18:21,613 --> 01:18:25,257
They kept bringing things to eat.
Lutie Cunningham...

979
01:18:25,325 --> 01:18:28,674
...brought a ham, a gallon of potato salad...

980
01:18:29,165 --> 01:18:30,758
...and three pies.

981
01:18:31,181 --> 01:18:34,181
It was almost a relief
when we got him buried.

982
01:18:34,444 --> 01:18:36,997
They wrote that he was a help
to his country.

983
01:18:37,293 --> 01:18:39,911
We never really got to watch over him.

984
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,926
It was a closed casket.

985
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:45,988
Why don't we go
to the monument in Washington?

986
01:18:46,412 --> 01:18:48,354
See his name at the wall.

987
01:18:48,492 --> 01:18:51,559
I saw a picture of it. I've thought about it.

988
01:18:52,045 --> 01:18:52,994
Why not?

989
01:18:53,069 --> 01:18:55,207
I couldn't do that at my age.

990
01:18:56,013 --> 01:19:00,323
Joe went everywhere in World War ll,
but I've never left my time zone.

991
01:19:00,621 --> 01:19:01,799
Pass the gravy.

992
01:19:05,677 --> 01:19:09,899
Mom said you had a notebook
or a diary or something of Daddy's.

993
01:19:10,348 --> 01:19:11,559
You want that?

994
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:16,261
It ain't personal.
It's troop movements and like that.

995
01:19:17,549 --> 01:19:19,403
Not loving, like his letters.

996
01:19:19,469 --> 01:19:20,679
I don't mind.

997
01:19:20,749 --> 01:19:25,026
I have no memory of him.
My own brother. Ain't that a shame?

998
01:19:26,413 --> 01:19:28,201
Everyone thought it was something...

999
01:19:29,229 --> 01:19:32,163
...that Dwayne left you behind
on earth for us.

1000
01:19:33,229 --> 01:19:34,505
Like a gift.

1001
01:19:50,444 --> 01:19:52,713
"Be present at our table, Lord.

1002
01:19:53,292 --> 01:19:55,561
"Be here and everywhere adored.

1003
01:19:55,916 --> 01:20:00,389
"These creatures bless and grant
that we may feast in paradise with Thee.

1004
01:20:00,844 --> 01:20:01,858
"Amen."

1005
01:20:02,347 --> 01:20:05,130
You didn't get any greens, Sam,
for goodness sake.

1006
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:41,994
<i>No mail today.</i>

1007
01:21:42,572 --> 01:21:43,947
<i>No cigarettes.</i>

1008
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,180
<i>Raining.</i>

1009
01:21:48,108 --> 01:21:49,220
<i>July 5.</i>

1010
01:21:50,828 --> 01:21:53,249
<i>Hotshot says we're getting closer.</i>

1011
01:21:54,316 --> 01:21:55,941
<i>Hands cracked and bleeding.</i>

1012
01:21:56,331 --> 01:21:59,593
<i>Depressed, but letter from Irene</i>
<i>got me out of it.</i>

1013
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:02,790
<i>Baby kicking strong.</i>

1014
01:22:04,076 --> 01:22:05,090
<i>Shelling at dark.</i>

1015
01:22:06,987 --> 01:22:08,100
<i>July 6.</i>

1016
01:22:09,131 --> 01:22:10,920
<i>Walking point all day.</i>

1017
01:22:12,076 --> 01:22:13,799
<i>Like hunting rabbits.</i>

1018
01:22:15,179 --> 01:22:17,219
<i>Miss those great fall days.</i>

1019
01:22:17,836 --> 01:22:20,618
<i>Autumn leaves. The change of seasons.</i>

1020
01:22:23,787 --> 01:22:24,900
<i>July 7.</i>

1021
01:22:26,155 --> 01:22:28,130
<i>Eddie looking for trouble.</i>

1022
01:22:28,651 --> 01:22:30,277
<i>Volunteered to walk point.</i>

1023
01:22:32,267 --> 01:22:34,569
<i>He's solid black and real quiet.</i>

1024
01:22:35,691 --> 01:22:39,171
<i>Hotshot says he wouldn't say shit</i>
<i>if he had a mouthful.</i>

1025
01:22:40,459 --> 01:22:41,571
<i>July 8.</i>

1026
01:22:42,603 --> 01:22:44,197
<i>Hotshot in a rage.</i>

1027
01:22:46,156 --> 01:22:47,617
<i>He works us like dogs.</i>

1028
01:22:47,692 --> 01:22:50,954
<i>But if he didn't get so mad,</i>
<i>we wouldn't be as good as we are.</i>

1029
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:54,533
<i>July 9.</i>

1030
01:22:55,755 --> 01:22:57,217
<i>Burned hootches.</i>

1031
01:22:58,731 --> 01:23:00,706
<i>Pregnant woman wouldn't come out.</i>

1032
01:23:02,027 --> 01:23:04,929
<i>Darrell pulled her out</i>
<i>before she burned up.</i>

1033
01:23:08,043 --> 01:23:10,083
<i>I pray Irene and babe are okay.</i>

1034
01:23:12,908 --> 01:23:17,447
<i>I play she's here with me, but when</i>
<i>I get her in my mind, she floats away.</i>

1035
01:23:18,124 --> 01:23:20,425
<i>I wouldn't want her to see this.</i>

1036
01:23:21,643 --> 01:23:22,821
<i>July 10 .</i>

1037
01:23:24,171 --> 01:23:27,019
<i>Found a dead gook</i>
<i>under some rotten leaves.</i>

1038
01:23:28,107 --> 01:23:31,817
<i>Interesting to see body parts broken down.</i>
<i>Like in biology.</i>

1039
01:23:33,771 --> 01:23:37,087
<i>Bobby stirred a stick in it</i>
<i>and some teeth fell out.</i>

1040
01:23:38,187 --> 01:23:39,528
<i>Darrell took one for luck.</i>

1041
01:23:41,419 --> 01:23:43,558
<i>July 11 . Daddy's birthday.</i>

1042
01:23:45,131 --> 01:23:46,822
<i>Thinking about home.</i>

1043
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:49,701
<i>July 12 .</i>

1044
01:23:51,274 --> 01:23:53,314
<i>Face to face with the V.C.</i>

1045
01:23:54,187 --> 01:23:55,169
<i>I won.</i>

1046
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:59,656
<i>Clean head shot. Back of his head gone.</i>

1047
01:24:01,451 --> 01:24:03,972
<i>Picture of his babies in his pocket.</i>

1048
01:24:04,939 --> 01:24:06,728
<i>Easier than I thought.</i>

1049
01:24:30,539 --> 01:24:32,481
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1050
01:26:38,699 --> 01:26:41,961
<i>When I get back to the world,</i>
<i>this will be a dream.</i>

1051
01:26:43,147 --> 01:26:45,732
<i>But now, the world is a dream.</i>

1052
01:26:48,043 --> 01:26:50,344
<i>Hotshot says we're almost there.</i>

1053
01:27:19,658 --> 01:27:21,152
Emmett, what are you--

1054
01:27:21,226 --> 01:27:23,331
What are you doing out here?

1055
01:27:26,282 --> 01:27:28,649
-Humping the boonies.
-This ain't Vietnam.

1056
01:27:29,898 --> 01:27:32,898
It's some swamp for Boy Scouts
to get lost in.

1057
01:27:33,066 --> 01:27:34,724
How did you find me?

1058
01:27:34,794 --> 01:27:36,518
It was just like you.

1059
01:27:37,258 --> 01:27:39,233
I knew you had that diary.

1060
01:27:40,105 --> 01:27:41,567
Did you read it?

1061
01:27:42,666 --> 01:27:46,343
I hated the way he talked
about them gooks and killing.

1062
01:27:46,602 --> 01:27:47,976
I don't like him anymore.

1063
01:27:49,961 --> 01:27:52,001
You don't like him anymore?

1064
01:27:53,962 --> 01:27:55,817
That's so fucking weak.

1065
01:27:57,098 --> 01:27:58,822
Who are you to say that about him?

1066
01:28:05,706 --> 01:28:06,819
When l...

1067
01:28:08,106 --> 01:28:10,080
...first came back here...

1068
01:28:11,274 --> 01:28:13,576
...I looked around at everybody.

1069
01:28:14,698 --> 01:28:19,073
It made me remember how in country
you was always on guard or you died.

1070
01:28:22,538 --> 01:28:24,065
It made you keen.

1071
01:28:25,162 --> 01:28:27,366
It made you sleep with your eyes open.

1072
01:28:32,042 --> 01:28:36,777
Every cell in your body was awake,
full of electricity. That was being alive.

1073
01:28:36,905 --> 01:28:38,815
See? Then I come back here...

1074
01:28:39,562 --> 01:28:43,107
...and what I saw was how weak
everybody's game was.

1075
01:28:44,073 --> 01:28:47,717
You might not like him,
but who are you to judge him?

1076
01:28:48,714 --> 01:28:49,761
I'll tell you...

1077
01:28:49,833 --> 01:28:52,833
...when your buddies are getting shot,
getting even feels good.

1078
01:28:53,289 --> 01:28:55,362
-I don't want to hear it!
-Yes, you do.

1079
01:28:56,361 --> 01:28:57,987
You wanted to know.

1080
01:28:58,825 --> 01:29:01,923
You've been at me
and now you can damn well listen.

1081
01:29:05,001 --> 01:29:07,205
When everybody you care about...

1082
01:29:07,337 --> 01:29:09,923
...even just a little, gets killed...

1083
01:29:11,498 --> 01:29:13,408
...one after the other...

1084
01:29:13,482 --> 01:29:17,508
...sometimes just in a pile of broken bones
and blood and guts...

1085
01:29:19,146 --> 01:29:20,739
...after a while....

1086
01:29:22,058 --> 01:29:24,262
After a while, you don't care.

1087
01:29:26,122 --> 01:29:29,504
Because if you let yourself care
and make a friend...

1088
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:31,016
...he'll get killed, too.

1089
01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:34,595
So you just quit feeling.

1090
01:29:37,610 --> 01:29:39,300
Do you understand that?

1091
01:29:40,617 --> 01:29:42,984
Do you understand that, little girl?

1092
01:29:44,105 --> 01:29:45,731
You walk around Hopewell High...

1093
01:29:45,802 --> 01:29:48,900
...wondering if someone's looking at you
the right way....

1094
01:29:51,818 --> 01:29:52,581
Shit!

1095
01:30:00,809 --> 01:30:02,915
And they're all still alive.

1096
01:30:06,313 --> 01:30:07,688
Do you know that?

1097
01:30:09,129 --> 01:30:10,373
ln my head.

1098
01:30:12,457 --> 01:30:15,686
They're all sitting around
a burned-out village...

1099
01:30:16,361 --> 01:30:19,525
...eating ham and motherfuckers,
waiting to be evacuated.

1100
01:30:21,353 --> 01:30:23,557
They've got a dead V.C. propped up...

1101
01:30:23,625 --> 01:30:26,407
...with a cowboy hat
and a cigarette in his mouth.

1102
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:31,875
They're wondering, "Where is Emmett?"

1103
01:30:33,673 --> 01:30:35,812
"How's he doing back in Hopewell?"

1104
01:30:38,025 --> 01:30:40,447
They're wondering why I ain't with them.

1105
01:30:43,818 --> 01:30:45,673
They're waiting for me.

1106
01:30:57,129 --> 01:31:00,064
I'm hanging on
with every bit of strength I got.

1107
01:31:01,193 --> 01:31:03,048
Christ, it exhausts me.

1108
01:31:05,737 --> 01:31:07,679
I ain't got nothing left.

1109
01:31:08,585 --> 01:31:11,846
Not for you, or Anita, or anybody else.

1110
01:31:22,857 --> 01:31:24,897
Something is wrong with me.

1111
01:31:26,185 --> 01:31:28,640
Like there's this hole in my heart.

1112
01:31:29,769 --> 01:31:32,932
Like something's missing
and I can't get it back.

1113
01:31:35,177 --> 01:31:37,119
It's out there with them.

1114
01:31:38,825 --> 01:31:40,613
I'm already half dead.

1115
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:28,808
I can't get used to the way you two...

1116
01:32:28,872 --> 01:32:31,872
...just whooshed in
and took me off on this trip.

1117
01:32:34,249 --> 01:32:36,932
I'm sorry Grandpa's back was up...

1118
01:32:37,737 --> 01:32:42,144
...but he would have worried about
the wheat anyway. It's near ready to cut.

1119
01:32:43,401 --> 01:32:46,303
For what, I don't know,
at the market prices.

1120
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:52,773
Sometimes I think Dwayne is better off
out of this.

1121
01:32:53,161 --> 01:32:55,910
He'd have been a farmer like his daddy.

1122
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:59,750
If you could do it over,
would you have sent him to Canada?

1123
01:33:00,072 --> 01:33:02,854
Sam, people don't have choices like that.

1124
01:33:04,425 --> 01:33:08,582
Besides, he did good for his country
and I take comfort in that.

1125
01:33:08,905 --> 01:33:13,215
What good did he do?
Emmett said they all died for nothing.

1126
01:33:13,929 --> 01:33:16,231
Emmett can talk. He didn't die.

1127
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:19,750
That's right, Mrs. Hughes.
I'm alive and horrible.

1128
01:33:20,137 --> 01:33:23,203
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to step
on your feelings.

1129
01:33:23,273 --> 01:33:25,412
I just had to say how I feel.

1130
01:33:30,312 --> 01:33:33,127
Emmett, find another station on the radio.

1131
01:33:34,089 --> 01:33:36,456
My legs are killing me.
I need to take my pill.

1132
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:38,659
Can you find a place to stop?

1133
01:33:39,816 --> 01:33:41,343
Where there's barbecue.

1134
01:33:42,312 --> 01:33:44,898
I didn't feed us enough at breakfast.

1135
01:34:08,392 --> 01:34:09,472
Hold on.

1136
01:34:10,375 --> 01:34:12,198
Oh, Lord, my knees.

1137
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,819
Get out of there. Watch out.

1138
01:34:19,048 --> 01:34:21,896
She's driving me crazy! I want to scream.

1139
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:24,000
She ain't been nowhere before.

1140
01:34:24,105 --> 01:34:25,599
She's driving me nuts.

1141
01:34:26,248 --> 01:34:28,037
Oh, my God!

1142
01:34:29,257 --> 01:34:32,355
If it isn't all my favorite people
in the world!

1143
01:34:35,592 --> 01:34:37,218
Emmett, come on in!

1144
01:34:37,832 --> 01:34:39,458
I don't believe it!

1145
01:34:41,416 --> 01:34:44,678
Don't bother with them.
Larry was out of focus on most of them.

1146
01:34:44,744 --> 01:34:47,013
That's a good one of all of us.

1147
01:34:47,688 --> 01:34:49,793
-I like that one.
-That's a good one.

1148
01:34:49,864 --> 01:34:50,977
Can I have it?

1149
01:34:51,048 --> 01:34:54,659
Take what you want.
Larry got double prints on a special.

1150
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:02,018
Are you sure you won't come with us?

1151
01:35:04,968 --> 01:35:07,107
I don't think so. You do it.

1152
01:35:10,472 --> 01:35:11,933
Anyone want another beer?

1153
01:35:12,008 --> 01:35:14,048
-Help yourself.
-Not for me.

1154
01:35:15,368 --> 01:35:17,124
Is Emmett with Anita again?

1155
01:35:17,575 --> 01:35:20,477
Emmett doesn't know what he wants,
but Anita does.

1156
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,131
Why don't you go to colonial Williamsburg
on your way?

1157
01:35:24,199 --> 01:35:28,094
I've never been that far from home.
I'm too old to do that.

1158
01:35:28,455 --> 01:35:29,982
You're not old.

1159
01:35:30,119 --> 01:35:33,283
I'm 58, with 20 years of worry
tacked on to that.

1160
01:35:33,703 --> 01:35:35,197
You're as old as you feel.

1161
01:35:38,024 --> 01:35:39,071
Did you tell her?

1162
01:35:39,912 --> 01:35:41,254
I'm going to.

1163
01:35:41,448 --> 01:35:42,430
Go on.

1164
01:35:42,729 --> 01:35:43,743
I will!

1165
01:35:45,576 --> 01:35:48,194
Mom, can I move up here
and go to college?

1166
01:35:48,648 --> 01:35:50,404
What did I hear over there?

1167
01:35:52,104 --> 01:35:53,762
That's the sweetest thing!

1168
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:59,968
Your big sister is coming to live with us
and go to college.

1169
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,407
-You mean it?
-I mean it.

1170
01:36:02,472 --> 01:36:03,748
She means it!

1171
01:36:06,376 --> 01:36:09,060
Dwayne always thought
you'd hung the moon.

1172
01:36:15,144 --> 01:36:16,573
She's moving up here.

1173
01:36:54,663 --> 01:36:56,638
Come on out of there, Sam.

1174
01:36:58,344 --> 01:36:59,554
I don't see it.

1175
01:36:59,624 --> 01:37:02,079
They say you come up on it all of a sudden.

1176
01:37:02,215 --> 01:37:03,841
My legs hurt.

1177
01:37:04,168 --> 01:37:06,917
Emmett, will you get me my geranium.

1178
01:37:07,944 --> 01:37:10,726
You go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.

1179
01:37:43,847 --> 01:37:45,440
He's on panel 4-W.

1180
01:37:55,239 --> 01:37:56,187
There it is.

1181
01:37:56,967 --> 01:38:00,447
It don't show up good.
It's just a hole in the ground.

1182
01:38:25,383 --> 01:38:27,358
Lord, it's black as night.

1183
01:38:28,552 --> 01:38:31,235
I didn't think it would look like this.

1184
01:38:59,911 --> 01:39:01,798
What are those gold stars for?

1185
01:39:03,207 --> 01:39:05,662
I guess to make the name stand out.

1186
01:39:06,758 --> 01:39:09,027
-I can go with that.
-Me, too.

1187
01:39:16,743 --> 01:39:19,198
Are you going to look
for anyone else besides Daddy?

1188
01:39:22,534 --> 01:39:24,989
I want to look up a couple of guys.

1189
01:39:35,335 --> 01:39:36,229
God!

1190
01:39:37,575 --> 01:39:39,747
It's just like Mom said. The names.

1191
01:39:40,583 --> 01:39:44,358
Bobby Gene and Freddie Ray
and Jimmy Bob.

1192
01:39:45,319 --> 01:39:46,246
Country boys.

1193
01:39:46,695 --> 01:39:50,306
Country boys are just like city boys.
Now they got everything.

1194
01:40:08,679 --> 01:40:09,955
There it is.

1195
01:40:18,343 --> 01:40:19,869
"Dwayne E. Hughes."

1196
01:40:43,046 --> 01:40:44,639
I'm going to bawl.

1197
01:40:45,702 --> 01:40:48,385
-I wish I could touch it.
-Just a minute, Mamaw.

1198
01:40:49,125 --> 01:40:51,908
-Could we use that ladder, please?
-Yes, you may.

1199
01:40:58,534 --> 01:41:00,639
Watch yourself, Mrs. Hughes.

1200
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:14,181
Someone might see up my dress.

1201
01:41:14,279 --> 01:41:16,166
Go on. You can do it.

1202
01:41:42,726 --> 01:41:44,155
Watch your step.

1203
01:41:49,638 --> 01:41:52,802
Sam, you go up there.
Take this and get his name.

1204
01:42:03,653 --> 01:42:05,508
It's real close, Mamaw.

1205
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:32,252
Smile.

1206
01:44:53,669 --> 01:44:56,931
<i>When I get back to the world,</i>
<i>this will be a dream.</i>

1207
01:44:58,117 --> 01:45:00,670
<i>But now, the world is a dream.</i>

1208
01:45:02,469 --> 01:45:04,771
<i>Hotshot says we're almost there.</i>

1209
01:45:22,245 --> 01:45:24,285
You want to get some barbecue?
