1
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,838
- Hey.
- Yes?

2
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,762
Erm, I'm looking for a job.

3
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,507
- Who do I see?
- Oh, ho, you're out of luck, chum.

4
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,271
- Who's won, mate?
- It's on now.

5
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,649
I heard you needed drivers,
for ballast.

6
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,028
- You a ballast driver?
- I'm any kind of a driver.

7
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,824
What difference does it make?

8
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,219
That block, first door,
ask for Cartley.

9
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,846
Ah, thanks a lot.

10
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,843
Must be hungry.

11
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:32,627
Thanks Terry,
bung it down anywhere.

12
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,915
Lovely work, Jackie boy,
Lucy loves you.

13
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,927
Oh, you're not Terry.
Huh, sorry.

14
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,670
See you later, Jackie.

15
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,264
Thought you were the boy
who's mending my typewriter.

16
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,555
I'm looking for Mr Cartley..?

17
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,930
- Is he expecting you?
- I'm looking for a job.

18
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,440
Hmmm! You'll be lucky.

19
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,478
My name's Yately,
Joe Yately, er...

20
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,197
...I met a character called Legubin.

21
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,365
Oh, you know Leggy.
How is he?

22
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,615
They've put a silver plate
in his skull.

23
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,281
So I, I thought there might
be a job going up here.

24
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,750
Why, to get a silver
plate put in your skull?

25
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,287
Leggy said there was
good money up here.

26
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,590
Well...

27
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,842
...I'll see what I can do for you.

28
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,183
Yes?

29
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,611
I heard you needed
ballast drivers.

30
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,027
You met Legubin,
is that right?

31
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,365
Yeah.

32
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,405
Did he tell you how much he
cost us in compensation?

33
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,703
He couldn't handle the loads,
not at the speeds we wanted.

34
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,785
How long have you
been driving?

35
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,788
- Twelve years.
- Many accidents?

36
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,923
- No.
- You sure?

37
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,003
- Now, look, I told you.
- Licence.

38
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,726
Hm. No endorsements, no
convictions for speeding - why not?

39
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,062
Huh. I guess I was
never caught.

40
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,155
Name and address of
your last employer.

41
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,987
I've been out of the country.

42
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,281
Where?

43
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,246
Around.

44
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,295
I want fast drivers.

45
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,709
Fifty miles an hour touched,
right round the clock.

46
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,715
- What kind of roads?
- Bad roads.

47
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,464
Wet or fine.

48
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,338
- What about the speed limit?
- That's up to you.

49
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,177
If you're caught you
pay your own fine.

50
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,975
So if you don't think you can
handle ten tonnes at that speed,

51
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,557
- ...just say so.
- What's the money?

52
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,063
We work a bonus system here.

53
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,192
You get seven shillings a load,
plus four shillings an hour.

54
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,442
- Over what distances?
- Ten miles each way.

55
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,783
Twelve loads a day, minimum.
Anything under, you're fired.

56
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,073
That's a pretty rough
pace, isn't it?

57
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,869
We've got one man that
does eighteen runs a day.

58
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,126
- And what about breakdowns?
- You maintain your own lorry at night.

59
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,454
If you have a breakdown,
it's your fault.

60
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,379
And, ah, we like you to
keep your vehicle clean.

61
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,797
There's a bonus each week
for the best-looking truck.

62
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,879
If you've got one left.

63
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,548
You don't like the idea?

64
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,592
I like the money.

65
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,848
An itchy palm doesn't
make a good driver.

66
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,140
It needs guts, confidence.
You don't inspire me.

67
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,568
You're looking for a sucker,
aren't you, Mr Cartley?

68
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,995
- Lucy.
- Yes, Mr Cartley?

69
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,202
Phone the shop, tell him to
bring round a spare truck.

70
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,832
- The usual test run.
- Yes, Mr Cartley.

71
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,376
Right.

72
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,752
You'd better not be wasting
my time, that's all.

73
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,685
Ed, the usual.
Once over the run.

74
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,766
Roger.

75
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,949
Here, you'll want these.

76
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,491
You've driven one of
this kind before?

77
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,370
I said have you ever
driven one of these before?

78
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,047
Yeah. I've been out of
circulation for a little while.

79
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,667
Ah.

80
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,341
Hop in, then.

81
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,345
What have you been driving?

82
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,137
- Oh, this and that.
- Oh, yeah.

83
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,937
Well, take a tip. These trucks,
they're light on the trigger.

84
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,776
You don't have to fight
'em, the way you're doing.

85
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,362
Loosen up a bit.

86
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:55,817
Good.

87
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,446
Now, here's a corner.

88
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,826
Now, don't check.

89
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,661
Let her run into it.

90
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,999
- We're going too fast.
- No, we're not, we're going dandy.

91
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,205
Step on it,
boost her round.

92
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,128
Well, let her swing,
let her go.

93
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,222
There, see?

94
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,703
The brakes don't work, didn't
you see? They failed on me.

95
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,203
Well, we stopped
didn't we?

96
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,621
Yeah, maybe they
need pulling up a bit.

97
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,752
Go on, back up,
I'll guide you.

98
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,626
Go on.
Back now, straight on.

99
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,298
Left a bit.
Now straighten up.

100
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,724
Pull left.

101
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,679
Great.

102
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,322
Oh, your face,
all them cows!

103
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,280
Yeah, well, I forgot
about the brakes..!

104
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,350
Wooh.

105
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,563
Now, you see, we get the
stock from that pit field.

106
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,361
You bring it round on this belt,
up to the ballast office.

107
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,696
This is the three-eight,
half-inch model.

108
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,912
This is the quarter-inch gravel.

109
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,739
It's the gravel we use.

110
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,782
- You know how to work it?
- No.

111
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,048
Now, get up there
and level it off.

112
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,423
The cops like it that way.

113
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,927
Blimey, they've let you
out today, have they, Ed?

114
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,230
Aye, doctor's orders.

115
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,142
Ah, keep your tail
down, come on.

116
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:43,951
Okay.

117
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,538
From now on it's the run.
I'm timing you.

118
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,499
Give her the gun.

119
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,883
Doesn't come round so friendly
now she's loaded, does she?

120
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,640
You gotta keep that
needle north of thirty.

121
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,650
Every mile you get
above that...

122
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,649
...you can reckon on another
sixpence an hour.

123
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,363
Drop below it and
you're out of a job.

124
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,362
Savvy?

125
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,534
Don't ease up.

126
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,586
Suppose we meet something?

127
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,542
Supposing we don't?

128
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,631
Look on the bright side.

129
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,882
Now, keep straight on.

130
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,926
Let the road look after itself.

131
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,955
Good for you.

132
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,273
Phew.

133
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,520
Red chasing Johnny.

134
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,032
Well, you didn't have to stop.

135
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,572
Come on, get moving.

136
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,533
We're losing time.

137
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,615
We've got a long way
to go yet.

138
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,080
What's the matter?

139
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,958
Who says anything's
the matter?

140
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,122
Oh, you're improving.

141
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,252
Now, here we are.

142
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,421
You've made it.
Wasn't bad, was it?

143
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,573
Oi! Okay, tip 'er.

144
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,477
Nudge 'er forward a bit.

145
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,773
How did I do?

146
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,067
So so.

147
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,029
Didn't get it, eh?

148
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,659
Come on, come on.

149
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,156
Wooh.

150
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,294
What happens now?

151
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,255
Home.

152
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,679
- Ah, well, you drive.
- Me? I can't.

153
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,053
The police took away
me licence.

154
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,616
Hey. Come here.

155
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,540
Lucy. Come here.

156
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,541
Bye bye.

157
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,335
Lets have another look
at that licence.

158
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,751
Yes, Mr Cartley.

159
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,382
Truck thirteen,
make out a log book.

160
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,425
Yes, Mr Cartley.

161
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:58,636
When do I start?

162
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,926
Ye...
LUCY!

163
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,678
Start him tomorrow.

164
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,519
Cards, particulars,
next of kin. Look after him.

165
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,525
Yes, Mr Cartley.

166
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:13,314
- Thanks.
- Well, aren't you the lucky one?

167
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,861
Fitter had me worried.

168
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,620
Ed? Oh, you needn't have.
I put in a good word for yer.

169
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,413
Yeah?

170
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,990
What did you say?

171
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,747
Oh, I said you were a...
friend of mine.

172
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,579
Why should you do that?

173
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,748
Do you always know
why you do things?

174
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,250
Huh.

175
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,225
Yately, Joseph.
Same address?

176
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,597
No.

177
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,726
I'm in between addresses now.

178
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,185
That's yours.

179
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,399
You've got Leggy's old truck.
Number thirteen.

180
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,737
For luck.

181
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,823
Got your cards with you?

182
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,901
No, I...
I've been away.

183
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,491
I lost them.

184
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,575
Does Cartley know that?

185
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,160
No.

186
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,255
Well, we won't tell him.

187
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,503
He's got a suspicious mind.

188
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,210
I'll try and get you
some new ones.

189
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,011
- Thanks.
- Got anywhere to sleep?

190
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,430
- No.
- Ask at the gate for Ma West.

191
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,182
All the boys stay there.

192
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,017
I'll do that.

193
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,985
Oh, by the way, there's a pull-in
across the street where they eat.

194
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,437
- Yeah? Oh.
- Of course...

195
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,446
...you might get to know some
nice local girl...

196
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,740
...and get invited for supper.

197
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,151
Do you like home cooking?

198
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,779
Well, yeah, if it's good.

199
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,864
If I cook it, it's good.

200
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,911
Bye, Joe.

201
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,290
Ah.

202
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,172
I know this might
sound funny, but, er...

203
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,088
...everybody calls me Tom.

204
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,133
Bye, Lucy.

205
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,214
So long, Tom.

206
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,033
Pull!

207
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,028
D'oh!

208
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,787
No, no!

209
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,625
Who's that fiddling
with the letterbox?

210
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,203
Come in or stay out,
I don't care which.

211
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,551
I just can't pull any harder!

212
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,091
Oh!

213
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,972
I'm in the kitchen.

214
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,227
Oh, you couldn't
pull your own shoelaces together.

215
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,309
Hullo, who are you?

216
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,141
Never mind, come in and
make yourself useful.

217
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,528
Oh, Jill, go away, you're
not strong enough.

218
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,234
This needs a man's hand.

219
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,150
Come on, young fella.
Let's see how strong you are.

220
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,486
Well, they told me I
could get a room here.

221
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,156
First things first, here, get
hold of these and pull.

222
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,788
- Okay.
- Go on. All right.

223
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,669
Nnn'uh!

224
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,542
Tighter!

225
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,373
Come on, you
won't hurt me!

226
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,842
Egh! Oh!

227
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,837
That's it. Oh,
that's it.

228
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,259
Steel, these are, young fella.

229
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,101
Supports me spine.

230
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,187
Had an accident.

231
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,520
How long do you
want the room for?

232
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,061
Oh, quite a while, I've got
a job over the road.

233
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,729
Good enough.

234
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,732
Thank your mother
for the groceries.

235
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,738
Okay, Ma.

236
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,329
Come on, then.
I'll show you upstairs.

237
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:54,959
That's the kitchen.

238
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,041
When I'm out,
the door's locked.

239
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,837
Front door's locked
at midnight.

240
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,214
If you're out after that,
you stay out.

241
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,676
That's me husband.

242
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,179
Died in a fire
twenty years ago.

243
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,261
Hum.

244
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,233
There's the bath.

245
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,353
That's the other place.

246
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,113
No scribbling.

247
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,824
Meals you eat out.

248
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,907
There's a pull-in over the way,
most of the men go there.

249
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,411
You can have this one.

250
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,548
Good enough for yer?

251
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,509
Yeah, how much?

252
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,587
Three shillings a night.
Sixpence a bath.

253
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,132
Money in advance.

254
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,854
Okay.

255
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,690
Good.

256
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,689
Any clothes you want boiling,
there's a basket in the bathroom.

257
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,154
I do 'em meself.
Thruppence an article.

258
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,231
Thank you, Mrs West.

259
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,316
Call me Ma.

260
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,030
Okay, Ma.

261
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,241
What do I call you?

262
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,534
Tom.

263
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,161
All right then, Tom.

264
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,705
See that you wash the
bath out when you finish.

265
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,250
Okay.

266
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,396
You own me ten from yesterday!

267
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,066
Let me go or I'll lamp you one!

268
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,484
- Hands off, will yer?!
- You won't get away with it, Scottie.

269
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,627
Now, this is your lot.

270
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,336
Knock it off, will yer?

271
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,090
- Hey, look at...
- Blimey!

272
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,676
Ma, she's gonna hit the
roof when she sees this.

273
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,591
- Ah, Tinker, what you got there?
- What's it look like?

274
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,175
- A mess.
- I've been after this for a month

275
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,715
- Now I got it.
- You can have it.

276
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,138
- No, you don't, I'm first.
- That's what you think.

277
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,927
You're a first class
driver. Oh...!

278
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,971
Here! Here, where d'you
think you're going?

279
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,266
It's ours! Put that name to
the bottom of the list.

280
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,734
- You fixed it, didn't yer?
What d'you mean, me?

281
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,987
- Come on.
- Come on, yer dirty bastard.

282
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,148
- Get outta there.
Come on.

283
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,693
STOP THAT,
DO YOU HEAR ME?!

284
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,202
Go take a flying jum...!

285
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,613
What did you say?

286
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,786
Not you, Ma, I was...

287
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,416
...talking to these tearaways.

288
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,327
Disturbing a gentleman
in his bath.

289
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,496
- Get out of it.
- Come on, you two!

290
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,460
Get upstairs to your rooms.

291
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,465
Kick my door and
I'll kick you.

292
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,547
What are those?

293
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,255
I gotta beautiful flowers,
for a beautiful lady.

294
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,344
Ah, thank you Gino.

295
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,850
- Got 'em cheap too.
- Only gentleman among the lot of yer.

296
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,560
- Thank you, Gino.
- Don't mention it.

297
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,767
- I'll go and put them in some water.
Yeah, do that.

298
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,185
Quick.

299
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:09,230
AND STOP THAT NOISE UP THERE!

300
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,985
- This place is a loony bin.
- Sure.

301
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,787
Where else you
put crazy people?

302
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,705
- Who is it?
- It's okay.

303
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,628
What are you doing here?
Who are you?

304
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,505
This is my room.

305
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:14,507
Ah, mama mia!
You give a me a fright! Heh!

306
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,967
- You just arrive, huh?
- Yeah.

307
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,055
You're beaten.

308
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,221
I come in.

309
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,269
You lie there.
You say nothing.

310
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,192
You, uh, have
a good laugh, huh?

311
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:31,945
No.

312
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,189
You know, there is so
much noise.

313
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,944
You hear the noise, ah?

314
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,567
This room is empty.

315
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,532
I use her for, ah...

316
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,076
...like a church.
You know?

317
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,291
Ah. You want to know I should
move these these things.

318
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,542
Oh, that's okay.

319
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,620
Come in when you like.

320
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,216
Are you sure?

321
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,759
Yeah, I'm sure.

322
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,638
Thank you.

323
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,095
Is better in here for me.

324
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,761
Some people
do not understand.

325
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,478
They make a joke, ah?

326
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,560
I don't mind, but, uh...

327
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:09,933
...thank you.

328
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,944
Uh, are you driver with us?

329
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,649
Yeah, starting tomorrow.

330
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,447
What truck they gave you?

331
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,405
Number thirteen.
Legubin's.

332
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:20,986
Thirteen.

333
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,280
Not so good.

334
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,286
You know, you also
have Legubin's room?

335
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,001
Yeah?

336
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,539
How not? Ha, listen...

337
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,834
...the shell, the shell, ah, she
never fall in the same place twice.

338
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,843
No, you got a very
good situation here.

339
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,179
- Ah, what are you called?
- Tom.

340
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,178
To all the boys,
I am Gino.

341
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:46,436
Because I'm Italian, you know?
But my real name is Manuelo

342
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,638
Leggy, Legubin...

343
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,232
...he was, ah, my...
my special friend.

344
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,817
You have friends here?

345
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,365
No.
No, thanks.

346
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,785
You have met Red?

347
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,241
No, I haven't met anyone.

348
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,031
He's the boss.

349
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,958
What we call the pace-setter,
he drive like the Devil. Marvellous.

350
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,619
He's got truck number one.

351
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,497
When you see him coming you keep
to the side, that is all I tell you, ah?

352
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,791
Yeah, I passed him
on the trial run.

353
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,961
He was going like he'd been fired
from a rocket or something.

354
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,632
That is the one.

355
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,928
That is the one.
I'm glad that you have seen him.

356
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,633
Oh, our Red.

357
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,802
He's a special friend
of yours, too?

358
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,812
I hate the sight of him.

359
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,348
Come over to eat.

360
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,146
Yeah, in the pull-in
over the road?

361
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,522
Yeah, that's right.

362
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,229
Girl in the office told me.

363
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,318
Ah, that is Lucy. Huh.

364
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,616
Funny girl, Lucy.

365
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:45,904
The boys like to make out
she's, ah, what you call it, erm...

366
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,284
...a hot number.

367
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,115
You mean she's not?

368
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,542
Ah, Lucy's like plenty people.

369
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,166
Got to make a big
impression, you know?

370
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,964
Because, er, inside
they are, erm...

371
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,591
...they're lonely.

372
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,591
That is the trouble with girls today.
All the time they must, ah...

373
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,799
...fight for something.
Fight, fight.

374
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,892
You don't like her, huh?

375
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,892
I love her.
She is my girl.

376
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,103
Come over.

377
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,275
Yeah.

378
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,734
Okay, come on.

379
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,153
And I tell you something
very special.

380
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,528
Lucy, she don't know yet,
but when I go back to Italy...

381
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,450
...she is going to
come with me.

382
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,036
We're going to have
our own bambini.

383
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,753
During the war I am prisoner
here, and, uh, I like England...

384
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,667
...I think then I stay forever.

385
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,544
But now, ah, I think different.

386
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,504
Bella Italia is all I want.

387
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,635
That and Lucy.

388
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,212
Small place of my own.

389
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,465
The sunlight,
the blue sky.

390
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,801
Ah, the blue sky, eh? Ah..!

391
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,928
You think she'd
go with you?

392
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,896
I pray she will, caro.

393
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,274
I pray she will.

394
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,238
- Ah, go on!
- Get it in there, then.

395
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,449
Wait for it!

396
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,325
YES!

397
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,325
Come on, now.

398
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,410
I'm gonna stop playing.
Ignore him.

399
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,498
Come on.

400
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,540
- One and nine, you owe me.
Come on, boys...

401
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,552
- Grab a chair.
- I'll get us some matches.

402
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,337
Hello. New one, come
to join us, have you?

403
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,301
- Yup.
- What's the handle?

404
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,136
- Tom.
- Oh, mine's Dusty.

405
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,516
- There's Tinker.
- Stinker.

406
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,142
- Watch it!
- Father Joe.

407
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,144
- Yeah, beautiful bonce.
- Ya, ha, ha!

408
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:35,347
- Come on, Pop, wake up.
- What's up?

409
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:36,765
- Pop, meet Tom.
- Hello, there.

410
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:39,146
- Scottie.
- Hi, Tom, there's a seat goin' over here.

411
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,060
- You can sit next to me.
- Ah, no no...

412
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,028
...you can't do that to
the guest of honour.

413
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,699
- You're gonna sit right next to me.
- Yes, you sit here, Tom.

414
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,450
Hey, Dusty.

415
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,996
The new one always
get the 'ead of the table.

416
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,329
- You blab, I'll break yer neck.
- You go on.

417
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,414
Look, he's gotta learn
sometime ain't he?

418
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,704
This our little Jill,
our little darling.

419
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,214
Aye, treat her good and
you get double portions.

420
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,046
Big enough to look
after his self.

421
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,882
Maybe you're right.

422
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,595
Uh, my name's Tub.

423
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,020
Where you from, mate?

424
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,764
Around.

425
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,644
That's up North
somewhere, innit?

426
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,401
Go on, can't you tell a good
Welshman when you hear one?

427
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,362
Cardiff, innit, mate?

428
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,697
Near there.
A place called Blaenllechau.

429
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,529
Oh, that a horrible disease.

430
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,864
Nah, he's got the hiccups.

431
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,953
Give 'im some water.

432
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,084
So you're gonna join
the 'ell drivers, are yer?

433
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,919
He's a crack driver,
I tell you.

434
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,259
- He's come to take Red's place.
- Ya, ha, ha, ha!

435
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,758
Have you, have you got
your coffin ordered, mate?

436
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,090
Yeah, what made you decide
to put an end to it all, eh?

437
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:54,008
He's after the money.

438
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,185
He's saving for the blind.

439
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,562
- Hey, Red.
- Red!

440
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,767
The er, water's getting cold.

441
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,119
One of the very best.

442
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,451
Th-there's no need
to start anything, Red.

443
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,077
I'll get him to move.

444
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,750
Red.

445
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,595
Give us it over 'ere,
Johnny. As it comes?

446
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,214
- Yeah.
- Nice and warm?

447
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,678
Gino.

448
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,936
Er, your cigar's gone out.

449
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,019
My place.

450
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,360
If you think you're good
enough to sit in my place.

451
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,195
You have to prove it...

452
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,322
...uh?

453
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,411
Yeah.

454
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,129
He's as brave as
the rest of yer.

455
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,379
Thought you were gonna see
somethin' then, didn't you? Ah?

456
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,761
Who's the Girl Guide, anyway?

457
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,142
- He's the new driver.
- What truck's he got?

458
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,847
I don't know.
Hey, Tom.

459
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,353
What truck you got?

460
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:24,482
- He's got Legubin's truck.
- Who asked yer, spaghetti?

461
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,482
Nobody asked, but I
tell you anyhow.

462
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,986
Hah, I get it.

463
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,742
Him and you's pals, eh?

464
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,243
Well, just watch he doesn't get in
me way out on the run, that's all.

465
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,377
Aye, ah.

466
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,251
Who gets it?

467
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:53,340
I done eighteen runs.
Who beats me?

468
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,842
Don't look at me,
thirteen's my lot.

469
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,470
Minimum twelve.
No, chicken done it.

470
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,718
Fifteen, me. You're still safe.

471
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,228
- Fourteen.
- Twelve.

472
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,561
Lucky to get that.
Me pressure pump's up the spout.

473
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,311
- Fifteen.
- Ah, stinking fourteen.

474
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,772
Hey, Pop, you passed me
about a dozen times today.

475
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,235
How many runs did you do?

476
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,241
Look at him. Blind, deaf,
and twice a granddad.

477
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,330
- Hey, Pop.
- Hm?

478
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,373
How many
runs d'you do?

479
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,747
- Oh, um, seventeen.
- Seven...?!

480
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,461
- Hello.
- Er, Red you ain't gonna keep...

481
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:28,963
...that thing much longer.

482
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,040
Is gold, that case.

483
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,135
Here, let the new boy
have a look at it.

484
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,220
Look at that, ain't
that marvellous?

485
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,385
Feel the weight of it.
Solid gold.

486
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,389
Ain't that a beaut?

487
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,801
Do more runs that Red
in a day and she's yours.

488
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,352
He's the pace-setter, see?

489
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:44,888
He keeps us on the ball.

490
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,972
That's solid twenty-two
carat gold.

491
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,062
Worth two hundred
and fifty quid.

492
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,315
Oh, two hundred
and fifty quid.

493
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,400
Just think what you
could do with that!

494
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,530
Eh, boys, Red's overslept!

495
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,324
It's anybody's case today!

496
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,451
- Come on!
- Lets go!

497
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:15,690
Get off there.

498
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,154
COME ON, GET BACK!

499
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,988
- What's going on over there?
- Oh, Pop's trying to beat Red's time.

500
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,031
Fine chance he's got.

501
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,205
What's he wanna give way for?

502
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,627
If he don't, he'll have
his front stove in...

503
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,412
...an' he'll be off the road
for two days.

504
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,459
HEY, RED!

505
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,252
'URRY UP. THE SUN'S
FADING ME PAINTWORK.

506
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,077
Hey, Tom.
Where you been?

507
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,280
I look for you, you
are not in to supper.

508
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,781
Ah, I'm working on a
sick truck.

509
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,283
Jill, you got some
sandwiches for me and Ed?

510
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,625
I'll see what there is.

511
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,711
'Ey, Tom...

512
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,042
...two guys come
looking for you.

513
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:52,250
In a car. They go away.

514
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,376
- Me?
- Yah, at Ma West's.

515
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,588
Who were they?
What'd they look like?

516
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59,719
I don't know.
I don't see them.

517
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,263
Ma West yell upstairs.

518
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:03,769
But you are not there.

519
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:06,851
I see them drive away in
a big car, from the window.

520
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,732
Gino, you doing anything tonight?

521
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,769
I wait for Lucy now.

522
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,363
Take her to see the Italian
picture at the Playhouse.

523
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,525
Why, ah, you like perhaps I
should do something for you?

524
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,324
No, it's okay.

525
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,368
- You tell me what you...
- No, it's okay.

526
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,285
Do you know Chick Keithley?

527
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,957
- Hi.
- Hi.

528
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,668
Gino, anybody get
the case today?

529
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,038
The case? Ha, ha.
Fat chance.

530
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,964
That's all I wanna know.

531
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,130
Now, listen, Tom.
This is crazy.

532
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,595
I see you try to
beat Red today.

533
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:40,677
Don't do it.
You listen to me.

534
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,174
Don't try it.

535
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:45,603
So long as he uses a short
cut, it's not possible.

536
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,055
Short cut?

537
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:52,150
Why don't we all use it?

538
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,319
Because we are not pazzo
like Red, that's why.

539
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,856
- You know the quarry, ah?
- Yeah.

540
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,283
Is very dangerous to
drive fast there.

541
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,861
If you drive slow, is no
longer a short cut.

542
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:04,947
Is a long cut, hah!

543
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,124
- Well, have you tried it?
- Yah, we all try.

544
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,002
Leggy tried.

545
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,080
He was the last.

546
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,715
We don't go there no more.

547
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:17,752
I see.

548
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,262
But Red only drives a
truck, just like you and me.

549
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,097
- Here you are, Tom.
- Ah, thanks.

550
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,223
Ham and cheese.

551
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,260
We've got some chicken in
the refrigerator, if you'd like.

552
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,178
- No, this is fine.
- No coffee?

553
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:30,268
- No. Bye.
- Goodnight, Tom.

554
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,057
- Tom.
- Yeah?

555
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,393
Don't try it, ah?
You listen to Gino.

556
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,576
Jill, you falling for
that guy or somethin'?

557
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,157
I never saw you smile so
sweet since we met.

558
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:53,254
Well, well, where've
you been, on a picnic?

559
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,332
Yeah. We, er, we
had champagne.

560
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,466
Well, just fancy.

561
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,344
There was I thinking of
inviting you for supper.

562
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,478
Thanks.

563
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:19,817
Yeah, well, I've got to
get back to work.

564
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,236
Work? This time
of the night?

565
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,781
You act as if you're running away
from a wife or something.

566
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,453
I'm working on a truck.

567
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,534
There doesn't always have
to be a woman in it.

568
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,625
Well, it's usually either
that or money, isn't it?

569
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,747
Is it?

570
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,622
Of course I may be wrong,
and I'm willing to learn.

571
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,666
Why don't you get in and
tell me all about it?

572
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,927
I just love life stories.

573
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,425
Gino's waiting for you
in there, remember?

574
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:50,636
You think I'm flinging myself
at you, don't you?

575
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,730
You're giving a pretty
fair imitation.

576
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,274
What else is wrong with me?

577
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,360
You wanna know?

578
00:44:58,571 --> 00:44:59,812
Yeah.

579
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,648
- Hi, muscles.
- Hi, Lucy.

580
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,941
Hello, boys.

581
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:06,151
- Yeah, were are you going?
- Hey, Lucy.

582
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,071
Tom. What are you
doing here?

583
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,494
Lucy, we got to hurry, or
we miss the picture.

584
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,251
Hey, you want to knock off
and come with us?

585
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,665
- Lucy won't mind.
- No, I haven't finished the truck.

586
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,585
- Ah.
- Gino.

587
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:19,748
Ah?

588
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,547
I'm gonna take that
gold cigarette case from Red.

589
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,714
- You can help me.
- Huh, Tom I told you, don't do it.

590
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,887
Red is pazzo, he don't let
anyone take the case.

591
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:34,688
He's only a... how you say?
A carrot for us donkeys.

592
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,016
And I'm a donkey.

593
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,400
- Tom!
- Gino!

594
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:42,188
Wait a minute. Tom, how long
you been driving ballast?

595
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,939
- You know how long.
- Let it go.

596
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,567
Red been driving it for twelve
years. He knows all the tricks.

597
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,784
You don't.

598
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,069
So you don't
wanna help me.

599
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:50,366
Tom.

600
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,123
All right, huh, I'm with you.

601
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:58,954
But what do you want
me to do?

602
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,298
I'll tell you tomorrow
morning. Thanks, Gino.

603
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,383
Enjoy the picture.

604
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,257
It's like, like, ah, poison in
the blood, this thing.

605
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,175
They all get it.

606
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,102
I will try to see he
don't get hurt.

607
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,145
He's a nice boy, ah?
You like him?

608
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:18,857
- He's all right.
- Ah, he's my friend.

609
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,813
You must be nice to him.

610
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:24,275
Ah, carissima,
you look so, ah...

611
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,819
...ah, you look so pretty tonight.

612
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,573
Come, I drive. Move over

613
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,323
Gino, I don't feel like
a film tonight.

614
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,370
Especially one of those
foreign ones.

615
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,459
Oh, no?

616
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,664
Oh, it's too bad.
Is the last night for it.

617
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:47,754
Huh. I don't get much chance
to, uh, hear my own people talking.

618
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,842
Hey Johnny,
come on, 'urry up.

619
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,849
Where're we going? Huh?

620
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,517
Oh, I don't know.

621
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,722
Let's just go somewhere
and have a drink, huh?

622
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,643
All right.
Whatever you say.

623
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,523
Here, we go and,
uh, we talk, ah?

624
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:12,073
Ah, you don't know yet, but, er,
I think I got a surprise for you.

625
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,162
About you and me.

626
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,240
Tonight I tell you.

627
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:20,581
Er, Gino. If you really want to
go and see the picture..?

628
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,919
You change your mind again?

629
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:27,459
Let's go and see
the picture.

630
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,630
Whatever you say, carissima.

631
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,060
COME ON, HARRY!

632
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,561
- What's your hurry?
- Come on, shake it up.

633
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:48,359
Anybody'd think you're
fond of work!

634
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,153
Get out of it!

635
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,288
He works very 'ard don't 'e?

636
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,956
Yeah.

637
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,086
- Go ahead, boy.
- Yeah.

638
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,461
Come on!

639
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,136
Get out of it, come on!

640
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:43,763
Get out of it.

641
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:49,187
Look at that. Red's gettin'
some of his own medicine.

642
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,680
Ah, he'll never get away
with it.

643
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,767
Hey, Red, how do you
like you're own medicine?

644
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,093
HEY, GINO, GET
OUTTA ME WAY!

645
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,437
That's how it's gonna be, huh?

646
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:02,479
HEY, GINO!

647
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,235
- Hey, Tom.
- What happened?

648
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,488
It don't matter.
Get on.

649
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,952
- Gino, you all right?
- Ah-ha.

650
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,668
What happened?

651
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,747
Gino, what's the matter...

652
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:22,499
- ...with your leg?
- Ooh.

653
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,337
Ah, just a shake-up.

654
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:27,129
It don't matter, I tell you,
get on, go on.

655
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,096
You got a tow chain?

656
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,352
I've got one.

657
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,157
YAH!

658
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:54,455
Hey, Tom! Get going,
you got to beat him!

659
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:02,998
Thanks, Fred.
How much is that?

660
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:06,259
Seventeen shillings,
Miss Lucy. Ah.

661
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,503
Oh-oh, Tom, could
you lend me a...

662
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,592
...couple o' bob until tomorrow?
I'm short.

663
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,715
Oh, yeah, sure.

664
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,143
Thanks a lot.

665
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:18,104
Thank you very much.

666
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,898
I, uh, I see on the
progress report that...

667
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,980
...you didn't break any
records today.

668
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,277
Ah, Gino went off the
road, I had to help him.

669
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:26,775
Oh, is he all right?

670
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,606
I guess so. He's gone to bed,
he doesn't feel too good.

671
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:29,945
Well, does he need anything?

672
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:30,908
No, I don't think so.

673
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,447
He hurt his leg, got
shaken up.

674
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,782
He wants to sleep it off.

675
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:37,623
Yeah? That means he won't be
taking me to the dance tonight.

676
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,041
Ah, that's too bad.

677
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:40,744
Very selfish of him.

678
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,162
Oh, I didn't mean it like that.

679
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,706
In what way did you
mean it?

680
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,666
You know,
you've got a nasty habit.

681
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,254
Yeah, I got lots of them.
Which one are you talking about?

682
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,510
- I could like you if...
- Look...

683
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,345
...nobody's asking you
to like me.

684
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,006
You're Gino's girl.

685
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,473
Ever thought of
asking me that?

686
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,474
Look, Gino's my pal.

687
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,560
You're not pulling this kind of thing
on him, not with me you're not.

688
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,140
Don't talk to me like that!

689
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,270
Gino's my friend, too...

690
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:02,857
- ...and a good friend, and that's all.
- Well, treat him like one.

691
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:07,987
Y'know, the way you act anyone'd think
you're the only girl in this town.

692
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,567
I'll give you some fags.

693
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,875
That right, you done
seventeen runs today?

694
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,168
Yeah.

695
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:31,719
That's pretty close,
eh, Red?

696
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,379
Ah, what about it?

697
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,926
Pop's done better
than that...

698
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:36,716
...drivin' solo.

699
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:41,980
If you and spaghetti try any more
of them stop tactics on me...

700
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:44,812
...I'll show you a thing or two
you haven't even heard about.

701
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,814
The trouble is, when I
teach them, it's the...

702
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:48,190
...the hard way.

703
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,647
Maybe afterwards you won't
be in any condition to use them.

704
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,361
You understand me?

705
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:54,367
Yeah, I think so.

706
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,281
Here, where is old
spaghetti, anyway?

707
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,662
He's in bed.

708
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,947
Somebody side-swiped
him today.

709
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,450
That's what you two was doing
in that ploughed field, is it?

710
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,835
Thought you'd
stopped to have a kip.

711
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,541
If you saw us, why didn't you
give us a hand?

712
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,674
Our job's ballast,
not breakdowns.

713
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,423
The recovery people
don't like it, either.

714
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,550
If they heard what
you did today...

715
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,508
...ah, you'd wake up wearing
their footprints.

716
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:18,929
Why, is somebody gonna
write to them about it?

717
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,601
- What?
- I said is somebody gonna...

718
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:23,480
All right, I heard yer.
What you tryin' to do, be funny?

719
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,610
D'you know, I don't
like your attitude.

720
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:31,521
You've got a
chip on your shoulder.

721
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,357
- You think so?
- Yeah.

722
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,992
If I was to knock it off...

723
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,655
...your head might go with it.

724
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:44,583
Well, I'm the last man who'd
wanna walk around without a head.

725
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,460
Hah?

726
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:50,461
That's better!

727
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,792
Here, now, get a hold of this,
will yer...

728
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:55,086
I, I got two jobs here, see?

729
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,048
I'm the pace-setter,
and the road foreman.

730
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,343
That means I'll be watchin'
yer from two directions at once.

731
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,889
To beat yer on the road...

732
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,973
...and to beat yer down,
when you get out of line.

733
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:08,016
I'm not looking for trouble.

734
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,234
Unless I'm pushed.

735
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,030
Even if you're pushed.

736
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:18,951
- Hey, Tom!
- Over here, Red.

737
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,494
You going to the dance
tonight, Tom?

738
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,916
Yeah, I was
just gonna ask you.

739
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:33,215
We're all going in Johnny's car
after you've finished eating.

740
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:35,843
Do you like my skirt?

741
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,004
Yeah. Sensational.

742
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:39,760
Jill?

743
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,551
Excuse me.

744
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,302
Hello, Red. You boys gonna
behave yourselves tonight?

745
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,395
Right on, Chas.

746
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,227
- My dance.
- Oh! But I can't.

747
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,066
- Shall we sit this one out?
- Yes, dear.

748
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,299
- You busy?
- Well, I'm waiting for someone.

749
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,336
Then you're not busy.

750
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,102
Excuse me, sonny.

751
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,145
- Remember me last week?
- No.

752
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,897
I'll remind you.

753
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,309
You're not married,
are you?

754
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,857
No. Are you?

755
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:22,280
Silly. I like you.
You're real dry.

756
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:32,038
Hey, Dusty. Over 'ere.

757
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,248
Hello, how'd you
make out?

758
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,332
Red. All right.

759
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,248
There's a bird sitting over there,
remember your table manners.

760
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:40,801
Where are all the seats?
What am I, an orphan?

761
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,879
- All right, here y'are.
- Sit down.

762
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,176
Wo-ho, he's on to us!

763
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:49,806
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, cut it out.

764
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:51,808
Fellas, fellas!

765
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,390
Look.

766
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,198
It can't be.

767
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:04,571
- It is, it's Lucy.
- Done up like a dog's dinner.

768
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:09,864
- Great Scott!
- Hello, Boys.

769
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:11,616
- Look at that.
- It's suddenly awfully hot in here.

770
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,751
Where've you been keeping
that dress all our lives, eh?

771
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:14,911
Mind if I join you?

772
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,420
- Mind?!
- I've been keeping this place...

773
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:17,671
- ...'specially for you.
- Yeah...

774
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:19,207
...any fella tries to
takes you away from us...

775
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:20,591
- ...we'll fix him, won't we, fellas?
- Yeah!

776
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:22,677
Lucy, you make the rest of the
bunch here look like hyenas!

777
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:24,303
'Ere, get your
plates of meat off...

778
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,969
- ...get the lady a seat, will yer?
- Call yourself a gentleman?

779
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:30,135
- Your ladyship!
- Oh! Thanks, Tink.

780
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:33,146
- Oohh!
- Now look what you've done!

781
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:37,771
He'll live. I wanna thank you boys
for all calling round to pick me up.

782
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,524
Well, we thought you was
coming with Gino, Lucy.

783
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,605
Jill, do you wanna dance?

784
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:46,693
Oh, you kids go ahead and
dance. Don't mind poor little me.

785
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:49,699
- Lucy, Lucy, dance with me!
- No! No!

786
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:00,714
Get out of it!

787
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:22,857
Hey, remember me?

788
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,447
Having fun?

789
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,367
Yeah, fine, and you?

790
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,329
So so. There's a big brute
I want to dance with...

791
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,038
...and he won't ask me.

792
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,169
That's too bad.

793
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:44,834
What are you trying to prove?

794
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,422
That you're somebody's
best friend?

795
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,637
- Now, look...
- Why don't you get it into your...

796
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,677
...thick skull that I'm
not anybody's girl...

797
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,762
...and I'm not married!

798
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,650
Gino's a sweet guy.

799
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,148
He's in a strange country.

800
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:06,398
I was just trying to be
nice to him.

801
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,694
Do I have to suffer
for that?

802
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,655
If you don't like it,
that's your problem.

803
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:13,028
I don't want to be the one
that puts him out, that's all.

804
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:19,077
Come on, let's dance.

805
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:22,538
Come on.

806
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,971
- Let's dance.
- I'm, I'm waiting for Tom.

807
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,229
On second thoughts,
I think I will.

808
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,862
I just can't imagine what's
happened to my boyfriend.

809
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,528
I sent him for a bottle of coke
about half an hour ago.

810
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,529
P'haps he thought you
said "bucket of coke".

811
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:54,737
You're very humorous.

812
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:56,906
Tom.

813
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,663
Don't tell me you don't
feel the same way as I do.

814
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:02,999
What're you trying to do?

815
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,247
I'm human too, you know.

816
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:09,715
It's not fair, if two people feel the
same way about each other...

817
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:11,425
...what's wrong
with admitting it?

818
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:13,556
I suppose you're the
type who'd like to see...

819
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,345
...two men shooting
it out over you.

820
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,100
Ah!

821
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,846
So long as you win.

822
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,813
Ah, damn. I don't know
what it is.

823
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,483
It's not gonna work, Lucy.

824
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,398
It's got to work.

825
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,367
Are you crazy?

826
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,532
You don't know
anything about me.

827
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,946
I know.

828
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:39,035
I just love finding out.

829
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:44,670
I'm not kidding,
this is a nerve test.

830
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,296
- Really?
- A test for steady nerves.

831
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:47,590
- Oh.
- Steady 'ands.

832
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:49,007
Ah, you know you'll
never drive a truck if...

833
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,002
- ...you can't hold these like this.
- Oh!

834
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:52,507
- Here we go.
- Oh, you're not gonna burn me?!

835
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:53,545
Oh! Careful!

836
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:54,304
Steady!

837
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:55,305
Oh.

838
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,342
Now this is where it comes
very important.

839
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:58,934
You've gotta hold still now.

840
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:00,936
- Are yer ready?
- Yeah.

841
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,893
"Happy Birthday to you.

842
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:06,810
- "Happy Birthday to you."
- Oh!

843
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,732
- Where've you been?
- Where've I been?

844
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,692
I was told my old man wanted
to see me in the pub opposite.

845
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,901
- Wasn't he there?
- No, he wasn't.

846
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,361
So I looked in all the
pubs just to make sure.

847
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:14,532
That's funny.

848
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,656
Must've been some other
Bill I was told to look for.

849
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:19,075
Yeah, maybe you invented
the whole story...

850
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,406
...so you can
walk off with my girl?

851
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:23,246
That's right. You've had a
good drink, now insult me.

852
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,373
A man of my position,
taking care of your girl.

853
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:26,958
You're lucky I didn't
charge her for me time.

854
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:29,920
Piece-work rates!

855
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,183
- Excuse me.
- Oh, sure.

856
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:48,066
Oh, no, you don't.
Not this time.

857
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:50,148
Look, I said "excuse me" once.

858
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:51,521
Do you mind?

859
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:52,780
- Drop dead...
- Bill, please.

860
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,819
...somewhere we won't
fall over yer.

861
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,067
I said let go of her.

862
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,155
- She's my girl, and I was...
- Oh, Bill!

863
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,535
- ...dancing with her.
- Now, look, boy.

864
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,867
Steady. This is only
a joke, don't get rough.

865
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:03,578
Why don't you buzz off?
We let you truck drivers use our hall...

866
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:05,000
...and all you do is
muck up our evening.

867
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:05,826
- Yeah..!
- Ask anyone here...

868
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:07,415
...they'll tell you the
same thing.

869
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:09,171
We're sick and tired of
the lot of you.

870
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:11,089
- Hey, Red.
- YEAH?

871
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:14,343
There's a bloke 'ere says 'im and 'is
mates are sick an' tired of us.

872
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:16,842
Ah, ask him what
he's gonna do about it.

873
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,639
Hey Tom, Scottie, Johnny.
Come on!

874
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:22,931
- Yeah.
- Now then, Red, no trouble.

875
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,098
No trouble, please.

876
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,455
Get the police immediately.

877
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:46,618
- HIT THEM!
- Too late.

878
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:52,172
- Red, the cops!
- Blow the cops.

879
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:54,254
You get stuck in.
Come on!

880
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,012
HEY!

881
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:01,014
Come back, yellow belly!

882
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,426
Come back, you.
Hey!

883
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,262
COME BACK,
YELLOW BELLY!

884
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,360
HEY, YOU.
WE'RE COMIN' UP.

885
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:18,858
BETTER SAY YOUR PRAYERS.

886
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:28,034
COME OUT, YOU!

887
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:30,294
COME OUT, YELLOW!

888
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:32,709
COME ON, NOW!

889
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:41,930
Stop that!

890
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,507
Stop that this instant,
do you hear?

891
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,051
- But we all get...
- Red...

892
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:46,435
- ...come away from that door!
- All right, Ma...

893
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,595
- Here, beat it!
- I don't care what you want.

894
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,560
Now just hold back a bit,
will you.

895
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,270
Get back to your rooms
this minute.

896
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:55,232
- I'll lay into you with this poker.
- All right.

897
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,943
- Don't worry, we'll be seeing him...
- All right, yellow belly.

898
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,861
...tomorrow.

899
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:37,945
How many of those
green sweets...

900
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,279
...can you get for a penny?

901
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:40,815
- Three.
- Ah.

902
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:43,443
Here, you'll like these.

903
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,154
- BATTERED BRAZILS!
- OH, BOY!

904
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,248
- You've got more than half.
- No, I haven't.

905
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:51,992
Yes, you have.
Come back, you dirty little rat.

906
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:54,541
- ...I'll get you for this!
- Ha, ha! That's what you think.

907
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:00,125
How about a packet of fags?

908
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,136
- On credit.
- Huh!

909
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:06,014
Tom!

910
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:08,513
Huh, Tom!

911
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,888
- Oh! Oh, Tom.
- Jim. You all right?

912
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,517
I'm all right.

913
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,607
How are you?

914
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:17,393
Ah, huh!

915
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,774
Oh, you look marvellous.

916
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,647
We heard you were out.

917
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:24,195
- Where you been?
- Oh, what do you mean?

918
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:26,660
- Don't you read my letters?
- Letters?

919
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:28,954
What letters?

920
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:30,865
How's Mam?

921
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,826
I, I thought I'd try to get here
while she was in church.

922
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:37,667
Oh, Tom. Mam wouldn't
keep your letters from me.

923
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,752
Jimmy, the shop looks good.

924
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,797
How's business?

925
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,511
You know this
neighbourhood, Tom.

926
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:50,600
We've been paying our way.

927
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:52,682
So far.

928
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:54,767
Any of the boys still
come round, Jimmy?

929
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,854
Oh, yeah.
For cigarettes, you know.

930
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,187
How are the legs, kid?

931
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,190
Just the same, Tom.

932
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:06,445
Excuse me, Tom.

933
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,913
Morning, Mrs Lipton,
what'll it be?

934
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:14,742
Good morning, Jimmy.
I want a pound of sausages.

935
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:16,702
Myrtle's bringing her
young man to dinner...

936
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,916
...so I've got to make the
Sunday roast stretch a bit!

937
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,547
- Anything else?
- No, thank you.

938
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,337
That'll be three shillings,
please, Mrs Lipton.

939
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,718
Oh dear, up again,
aren't they?

940
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:28,763
Oh, well, maybe Myrtle'll be
off our 'ands before long.

941
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,265
- Remember me to your mother.
- I will.

942
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:32,305
- Bye.
- Bye, Mrs Lipton.

943
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,387
Thank you.

944
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:54,157
How was it...
inside, Tom?

945
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,915
Ah, bad, Jimmy. I can't ever
let that happen to me again.

946
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:02,998
I can't be tied down.

947
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:05,046
I know what you mean.

948
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,506
Killed me, Jimmy,
knowing what I did to you.

949
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:13,634
It was an accident.
I never blamed you.

950
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:15,978
Yeah.

951
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:20,273
It's more than just making
it up to you, Jimmy.

952
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,896
I gotta make the grade
for once.

953
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:25,525
The right way. Do you
know what I mean?

954
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:28,403
Yeah, I know, Tom.

955
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,985
- I took a job.
- What are you doing?

956
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:34,287
- Driving.
- Driving again! Huh.

957
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:35,489
Not what you think.

958
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:39,418
Listen, Jimmy - it's tough
when you come out.

959
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:41,837
There's only the lousiest
jobs and no money, and...

960
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:43,917
...nobody wants you, so...

961
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:46,007
...well, I took this one.

962
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:49,336
Well, as long as you're behind
the wheel, you can go anywhere.

963
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:51,880
- I'm driving ballast, Jimmy.
- Oh..!

964
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:56,806
It's tough but, well -
it's good money.

965
01:11:58,439 --> 01:11:59,805
There's even a...

966
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:02,650
...little solid-gold bonus
waiting for me at the end of it.

967
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:08,655
Jimmy. Look, I want you
to have this.

968
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,865
It's not much, but I've only been
working a couple of weeks.

969
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,450
- No, Tom, I can't take it.
- Take it, will you?

970
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,240
No, please, I...

971
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:20,659
Hello, Mam.

972
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,912
What's that.

973
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:26,999
Ma, take it easy. Tom's
just tryin' to help us.

974
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,417
Take it back.

975
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:32,303
Why should I? It's Jimmy's
money, I gave it to him.

976
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,180
I make the money that
comes into this house.

977
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:36,842
And I make it honestly, with
the sweat of my brow.

978
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:40,020
Maybe it's not much,
but what there is, is clean.

979
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,439
Well, this is clean, too.

980
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:44,979
Oh, look, Mam, we've
got to have a talk.

981
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,064
Nothing you ever touched
was clean.

982
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,237
Ma, Tom's tryin'
to help us.

983
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:50,571
He's got an honest
job, he's...

984
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,482
- I don't believe it.
- Let him finish.

985
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:54,322
Will you let him finish?

986
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:58,371
Look, Mam, you've got
to forget the past.

987
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:00,032
It's not past!

988
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:03,418
It's here, all the time.
I live with it.

989
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,668
For you, it was just
a year in jail.

990
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:10,087
For Jim and me,
it's a life sentence.

991
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:13,592
Him stuck in the shop all
day, never going out.

992
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,676
I KNOW ALL THAT, MA!

993
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:17,765
Tom.

994
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:25,106
Look, Mam. I'm only trying
to put things right.

995
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:29,524
- How can I make you see?
- I'm not listening.

996
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:33,027
Tom.
Mam.

997
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:37,153
Mam.
Please give him a chance.

998
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:40,618
You and him.

999
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:42,783
Always the same.

1000
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:45,744
He led, you followed.

1001
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,424
I wish you were still inside.

1002
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,504
Oh, Mam, no.

1003
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:57,472
All right, Mam.

1004
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,429
I'm gonna have to
draw a picture.

1005
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:05,517
Don't worry, kid.

1006
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:08,103
Maybe it'll work out.

1007
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:50,767
TOM!

1008
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:52,937
TOM.

1009
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:55,777
Well, what're you waiting
for, yellow belly?

1010
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:40,276
All right, boys.
On the road.

1011
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:37,763
Eighteen today.
Who gets it?

1012
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:39,014
- Not me.
- Nah.

1013
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:40,273
Thirteen, I done.

1014
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:43,481
- No good.
- 'Ere, Dust, pass the other one.

1015
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:50,566
You got enough
bread in that?

1016
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,910
- Fill this out, Tink.
- Righto, Luce.

1017
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:47,290
G. Redman, eighteen.

1018
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:49,375
Fill this out, Red, please.

1019
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,968
Joe Yately, eighteen.

1020
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:56,261
- Eighteen? Aye, aye.
- Yes, he went over the...

1021
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:57,721
...quarry today,
I saw him.

1022
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:00,808
- He's brave.
- Oh, another brave one, eh?

1023
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:03,772
- Hello, Gino.
- Hi.

1024
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,901
E. Rossi. Fourteen.

1025
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:16,736
See you tonight.

1026
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:28,631
Miracle. Magnifico.

1027
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,334
How you do this thing,
Tom? Is a miracle.

1028
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:34,303
Yeah. It's a miracle
somebody didn't get killed.

1029
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:37,845
Ah, Tom, today you proved to me
that you are a great driver.

1030
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:41,811
I know you can beat Red.
But everybody is against you.

1031
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:44,438
If you had a clear road - erh!

1032
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:47,020
Yeah. If I had a clear road.

1033
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,654
Tom. The money,
tomorrow.

1034
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:53,735
I see you get it.

1035
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:57,403
- How.
- We will change plates, ah?

1036
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:01,786
You take my number
plates. It's number three.

1037
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:04,959
I put your number
thirteen on my truck.

1038
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:07,044
Then for me the boys
make all the trouble.

1039
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:09,130
For you there is the
clear road.

1040
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:12,967
You like Gino's idea?
Ah, you, you be number three.

1041
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:16,425
- Yeah, but Gino...
- No buts.

1042
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:18,924
After, finito. Finish here.

1043
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:21,468
You go north, look for a
good job. I go south.

1044
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,935
You take the gold
case, I take Lucy. Va bene?

1045
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:28,603
Va bene, pal.

1046
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:35,857
Something stinks around
here, don't it?

1047
01:22:36,243 --> 01:22:38,075
Maybe you ought to
change your socks?

1048
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,578
- Ah, quick as a whip, ain't we?
- "As a wop", you mean.

1049
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,538
Watch your
tongue, Scotch boy.

1050
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,870
Oh, dear, dear, we're
getting tough, eh?

1051
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:47,080
Yeah, tough as macaroni.

1052
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:54,838
Hey, Gino, something's
wrong here.

1053
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:56,419
Huh?

1054
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:00,757
Twenty-four pound deduction.

1055
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:02,850
What advance you take?

1056
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:04,560
Four.

1057
01:23:05,772 --> 01:23:09,265
Five tax, uh.
No, it's wrong, this.

1058
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:11,518
- We see about it.
- Buzz off.

1059
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:14,612
There's other fellas waitin' to get
paid. He's got all he's gonna get.

1060
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:16,530
No, no, it's not at all,
there's been a mistake.

1061
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:18,737
There's no mistake.

1062
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:21,369
What do you know about it?

1063
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,330
- You, I'm talking to you.
- I'm, ah...

1064
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,366
...not talkin' to the yellow belly.

1065
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:30,287
If he wants to find out why
his pay was stopped, ask Ed.

1066
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:31,545
- Ed?
- Yeah.

1067
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,414
His stuff he wrecked.

1068
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:36,922
- Who put this on Tom?
- You mean on yellow belly?

1069
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:39,800
Me.

1070
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:42,340
I'm the road foreman.

1071
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:44,846
Yeah.

1072
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:47,262
And that's not all you are.

1073
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,516
What else am I?

1074
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:54,151
You're scum.

1075
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:13,921
Ha!

1076
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:23,301
COME ON, RED!

1077
01:24:27,854 --> 01:24:29,311
- Go on, Red!
- Come on, then, Red.

1078
01:24:29,356 --> 01:24:32,349
- Go on then, get in there!
- Wait a minute...

1079
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:34,643
- ...'e'll bloody murder 'im!
- Go on.

1080
01:24:34,695 --> 01:24:36,527
All right, take him.

1081
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,896
- Huh!
- GO ON, RED!

1082
01:24:38,949 --> 01:24:40,815
Take him, that's it,
come on!

1083
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:50,491
Come on, Red, take him!

1084
01:24:51,211 --> 01:24:55,000
Come on, Red!
Come on, Red!

1085
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:02,132
- Come on!
- Come on in there!

1086
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:07,137
- Hit 'im!
- Come on, Red!

1087
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:11,600
- Give it to 'im.
- Go on, you can do it.

1088
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,355
- Come on, Red.
- Come on.

1089
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:14,770
Sort 'im out.

1090
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:16,813
- Take him, come on.
- Come on, Red!

1091
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:22,527
Go on, Red,
give it your best.

1092
01:25:23,994 --> 01:25:25,201
ARGH!

1093
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:28,200
Go on, Red, you've got 'im
now, good boy, good boy!

1094
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:37,880
Go on, Red. Go on.

1095
01:25:39,635 --> 01:25:41,001
Give him a head!

1096
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:46,012
Hey, Tom!

1097
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:48,345
The assistant manager!

1098
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:51,970
- Come on, straighten up.
- What the devil's going on here?

1099
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:53,934
Oh, er, it's nothing sir, ah...

1100
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:57,184
...a test of strength, ah?
A bet, nothing.

1101
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:59,648
Nothing?
Fighting like animals?

1102
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:02,735
- Gibson, why didn't you stop them?
- Well you see...

1103
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:04,073
D'ah!

1104
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:08,282
You'll pay this damage,
both of you.

1105
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:11,868
Got your pay. Get out.
Go on, get out, all of you.

1106
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:13,783
Once more and it'll be
for good.

1107
01:26:17,547 --> 01:26:22,667
As for you - you're a foreman.
You're supposed to keep discipline.

1108
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:28,257
I may be a foreman, but
I'm not a prison warder.

1109
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:31,554
You think I don't know
you just done a spell?

1110
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,812
How can I keep discipline
if we're hiring convicts?

1111
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:36,522
All right, you know.

1112
01:26:38,944 --> 01:26:40,435
What are you
gonna do about it?

1113
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:42,520
Is nothing to do
with us, sir.

1114
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,614
He already paid once for
what he done. He told me.

1115
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:50,578
Mm. I'll have to check with
Mr Cartley in the morning.

1116
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:55,116
- Right.
- Come on, Red.

1117
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:59,291
Well, he can look after himself,
that boy, no doubt about it.

1118
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:01,835
Come on, I'm hungry.

1119
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:07,341
You better come
and lie down, ah?

1120
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:08,337
No, I gotta work.

1121
01:27:08,348 --> 01:27:11,011
Ah, this looks bad, you'd better
come and get cleaned up anyway.

1122
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:16,429
You all right, Red?

1123
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:18,147
Yeah.

1124
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:20,812
- He kneed me.
- Yeah.

1125
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:22,318
- You saw what happened.
- Sure.

1126
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:24,319
Otherwise I'd 'a killed him.

1127
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:38,285
Here. Hey.

1128
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:46,004
Oh, well.
Goodnight.

1129
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:48,882
Mailbags.

1130
01:28:25,759 --> 01:28:27,045
Hello.

1131
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,256
What do you want?

1132
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:36,596
I hear you're eating in the
village by yourself these days.

1133
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:39,220
- How's that?
- I like it that way.

1134
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:45,518
I heard what they're saying.

1135
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:47,603
Is it true?

1136
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:50,197
Yeah.

1137
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:52,783
It's true.

1138
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,245
And I wasn't framed, and
nobody talked me into anything.

1139
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:57,700
And the judge didn't
give me a raw deal.

1140
01:28:57,833 --> 01:28:59,790
Happy?

1141
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:04,166
You still have an invitation
to eat at my place.

1142
01:29:12,389 --> 01:29:15,097
- Where's Gino?
- We're through.

1143
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:18,801
What have you done to him?

1144
01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:20,894
I told him the truth.

1145
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:23,560
I told him I liked him, but
I'm not in love with him...

1146
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:27,064
- ...and I never was.
- You had no right to do that.

1147
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:28,986
Whose right is it?

1148
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:22,262
Gino?

1149
01:31:31,277 --> 01:31:32,939
Gino, are you awake?

1150
01:31:35,115 --> 01:31:36,231
Gino.

1151
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:38,904
Gino, I want to talk to you.

1152
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,692
- London, one way.
- The early's gone, mate, that was it.

1153
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:20,700
- Nine thirty-five, the next.
- All right, let's have it.

1154
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:23,653
Don't you characters
ever say "please"?

1155
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,199
Here.

1156
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:41,511
Excuse me.

1157
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:49,103
- Hello.
- Hello, Jimmy?

1158
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:51,351
- Tom.
- Hello, boy.

1159
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:54,642
Listen, Jimmy, if uh, Topper or Mack
or any of the boys come round...

1160
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,644
...tell 'em to get in touch
with Sammy O'Dea.

1161
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:58,730
Sammy O'Dea?
Are are you sure you've...

1162
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,356
Leave me alone, Jimmy
I know what I'm doing.

1163
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:02,445
Tell Sammy I'll be around
at Harry's place about...

1164
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:04,906
About three
o'clock, all right?

1165
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:09,574
Okay, Tom.
Whatever you say.

1166
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:11,625
Okay, Jimmy, boy.

1167
01:33:24,224 --> 01:33:27,012
Oh, Tom, thank God, I've been
searching everywhere.

1168
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:28,050
Ma West said she
thought you'd gone...

1169
01:33:28,103 --> 01:33:30,436
- Go away, I'm leaving.
- You don't understand, it's Gino!

1170
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:32,851
- Will you leave me alone?
- It's Gino, his truck hit a tree...

1171
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:34,686
...and caught fire and he's
very badly burned...

1172
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:36,100
- Fire?
- You've got to come to the hospital...

1173
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:38,194
- ...right away! Please!
- Come on.

1174
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:48,370
What are they doing in there?

1175
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:51,282
Why don't they ever
tell you something?

1176
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:57,000
Tom, maybe...

1177
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:00,670
...maybe I ought to go.

1178
01:34:02,262 --> 01:34:04,504
Maybe seeing me'll
just upset him.

1179
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:07,385
I know, Lucy, but...

1180
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:10,343
...look, you've gotta see him, and
tell him what I told you to tell him.

1181
01:34:10,436 --> 01:34:14,146
Yes, all right. I'll, I'll do
whatever you want me to.

1182
01:34:16,693 --> 01:34:19,026
But... you've got
to stop blaming us.

1183
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:21,270
At least yourself.

1184
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:23,022
- What happened would've...
- I know what happened.

1185
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:25,031
You don't know everything!

1186
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:29,074
Tom, listen. This set
up is a racket.

1187
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:32,240
Cartleys and Reds, they don't
care how many of you are killed...

1188
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:35,456
...as long as they can split their
extra two hundred every week.

1189
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:39,998
Why do you think they specialise in
hiring drifters like you and Gino...

1190
01:34:40,008 --> 01:34:42,466
...who let themselves be
hustled for money?

1191
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:55,763
But how do they make
that kind of money?

1192
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:57,810
- We get good pay.
- Not all of it.

1193
01:35:00,653 --> 01:35:01,769
Tom, Listen.

1194
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:04,901
The head office pays
basic salary for...

1195
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:07,491
...five more drivers
than Cartley runs.

1196
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:11,328
Red paces a short-handed
crew to meet the contract.

1197
01:35:12,123 --> 01:35:15,287
The cash for five drivers never
even reaches our pay window.

1198
01:35:17,503 --> 01:35:19,495
Did you tell Gino
about this?

1199
01:35:23,092 --> 01:35:24,458
Look, are you sure about...

1200
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:30,472
These are friends of his,
Doctor.

1201
01:35:30,892 --> 01:35:32,474
You can see him.

1202
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:39,265
Er...

1203
01:35:40,026 --> 01:35:42,689
How... How is he, Doc?

1204
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:46,897
If you've anything to say to him,
you'd better say it... now.

1205
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,773
It's Lucy, sweet.

1206
01:36:31,286 --> 01:36:32,993
Lucy and Tom.

1207
01:36:46,759 --> 01:36:48,250
Amico.

1208
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,717
I wa-I was, I was leaving when...
when I heard what happened.

1209
01:36:54,267 --> 01:36:57,010
I was on the railway station,
wasn't I, Lucy?

1210
01:36:57,645 --> 01:36:58,977
Yes.

1211
01:36:59,605 --> 01:37:02,473
Gino, it was you she wanted.

1212
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:05,275
All the time.

1213
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:07,524
She's your girl, Gino.

1214
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:10,238
Here, you, you tell him, Lucy.

1215
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:21,162
No. No.

1216
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:24,369
You are right for each other.

1217
01:37:26,049 --> 01:37:28,883
Be happy - together.

1218
01:37:31,137 --> 01:37:34,426
Ah, Tom. Tom, ah...

1219
01:37:34,891 --> 01:37:37,429
...you take care
a' my Lucia.

1220
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:41,478
And one day...

1221
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:44,018
You take her to Italy.

1222
01:37:45,068 --> 01:37:47,060
Ah? Va bene?

1223
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:49,857
- No, Gino, you...
- Tom.

1224
01:37:51,657 --> 01:37:53,114
I drew them off.

1225
01:37:53,326 --> 01:37:54,783
Like we plan.

1226
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:59,038
For... for you to win.

1227
01:37:59,749 --> 01:38:02,207
Hah, they're crazy.

1228
01:38:02,668 --> 01:38:04,284
You don't even come.

1229
01:38:05,171 --> 01:38:06,378
Huh.

1230
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:11,083
You... you changed
the number plates?

1231
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:16,384
And they, they thought
you were me?

1232
01:38:18,935 --> 01:38:22,428
I was, uh, number
thirteen. Huh.

1233
01:38:23,773 --> 01:38:25,264
Who was it Gino?

1234
01:38:26,275 --> 01:38:27,356
Was it Red?

1235
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:37,780
Gi...

1236
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:46,126
Wait outside a moment,
would you, please?

1237
01:38:57,515 --> 01:38:59,006
They...

1238
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:06,851
Oh, oh, my God.

1239
01:39:32,508 --> 01:39:36,127
Eddie, take the recovery truck
and get out there right away.

1240
01:39:36,345 --> 01:39:38,382
Write off or no write off,
she'll be good for some spares.

1241
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:39,717
Okay.

1242
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:41,177
- COOPER?
- Yeah?

1243
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:46,516
Isn't this Red's truck?
What's he doing in?

1244
01:39:46,606 --> 01:39:48,768
Only fuel. He's losing
it somewhere.

1245
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:50,974
- I'll fix it tonight.
- All right.

1246
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:53,068
He'll be out in a minute.

1247
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:57,948
LUCY! Oh, that...

1248
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:04,200
What are you doing in here?

1249
01:40:04,332 --> 01:40:05,914
Get off my desk.

1250
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:09,167
Gino's dead.

1251
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:13,918
Ah. That's bad luck.

1252
01:40:17,136 --> 01:40:20,800
You... You helped to
kill him, Cartley.

1253
01:40:22,892 --> 01:40:24,383
I'll pretend I didn't
hear that.

1254
01:40:24,602 --> 01:40:25,763
I think you'd better
get out...

1255
01:40:25,811 --> 01:40:27,518
...before you say something
you might regret.

1256
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:28,937
About the money you and
Red are grabbing...

1257
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:30,522
...by running us short-handed?

1258
01:40:31,734 --> 01:40:33,066
Yeah.

1259
01:40:33,819 --> 01:40:35,435
I know all about it.

1260
01:40:36,405 --> 01:40:37,486
Oh.

1261
01:40:38,658 --> 01:40:40,490
You do now.
I see.

1262
01:40:41,536 --> 01:40:42,902
Well, if you know
so much.

1263
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:44,699
Why don't you go and
report it somewhere?

1264
01:40:44,747 --> 01:40:46,204
Because that way you'll
only get nicked.

1265
01:40:46,249 --> 01:40:47,410
And that's too good
for you, Cartley.

1266
01:40:47,542 --> 01:40:49,454
Why, you cheap lag.

1267
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:51,001
You think that I don't
know that you've been...

1268
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:52,536
...driving without
a licence?

1269
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:54,333
How long do you
think you'll stay out...

1270
01:40:54,382 --> 01:40:55,714
...with your record?

1271
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:58,375
Then we'll do time together.

1272
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:01,094
And I'm used to it.

1273
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:03,596
I'm giving you a
week to pay, Cartley.

1274
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:06,095
- One week.
- Now listen, where're you going?

1275
01:41:06,269 --> 01:41:08,181
You want loads, Cartley,
you'll get them.

1276
01:41:08,354 --> 01:41:10,562
But from now on, we're getting
all the money that's coming to us.

1277
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:13,098
Every penny of it.

1278
01:41:13,526 --> 01:41:15,392
Listen, Yately.

1279
01:41:19,365 --> 01:41:21,698
Now, listen, wait a
minute, damn you!

1280
01:41:21,867 --> 01:41:22,903
Now, look here.

1281
01:41:23,369 --> 01:41:24,860
You're a clever boy
and a grand driver.

1282
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:26,782
I've seen it all along.

1283
01:41:27,248 --> 01:41:28,864
I can get you a corner on this.

1284
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:31,541
It'll double your wages.
A lot better than a bonus.

1285
01:41:33,254 --> 01:41:34,586
TOM, LISTEN!

1286
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:37,622
Listen, Tom.

1287
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:40,793
I can make things much
easier for you here.

1288
01:41:41,887 --> 01:41:42,798
Okay.

1289
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:45,467
Then I'll take over number one.

1290
01:41:46,142 --> 01:41:47,349
It's better than that
junk you gave me.

1291
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:49,434
All right, all right!

1292
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:51,936
If you want it that way
it can be arranged.

1293
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,180
But lets talk about it first.

1294
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:54,894
No, Cartley.

1295
01:41:55,234 --> 01:41:56,975
I don't want you and
Red for partners.

1296
01:41:57,778 --> 01:41:58,609
You're not my type.

1297
01:41:58,613 --> 01:42:00,570
Oh, now you're
being unreasonable.

1298
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:02,648
Tell Red I'm after him.

1299
01:42:03,284 --> 01:42:05,822
Tell him I don't have any proof
yet that he smashed Gino...

1300
01:42:06,996 --> 01:42:08,703
...but one day he'll
show his hand.

1301
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:11,577
And I'll smash him.

1302
01:42:17,006 --> 01:42:18,417
HEY!

1303
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:20,669
HEY!

1304
01:42:21,636 --> 01:42:23,252
Hey, what's that Mac
doin' in my truck?

1305
01:42:23,346 --> 01:42:25,929
- Why didn't you stop him?
- Stop him? Huh!

1306
01:42:28,684 --> 01:42:31,301
He knows. That slut
must have told him.

1307
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:33,937
He's taken your
job and your truck.

1308
01:42:34,106 --> 01:42:36,018
He says he's gonna
get yer for killing Rossi.

1309
01:42:36,275 --> 01:42:38,062
He is, eh?
Rossi's dead?

1310
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:40,268
Rossi's dead, yes.

1311
01:42:40,738 --> 01:42:42,354
And we're in big trouble.

1312
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:48,118
You'd better get after
him quick, now.

1313
01:42:48,788 --> 01:42:50,279
There's number three.

1314
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:53,202
- How about you?
- I'll back you up.

1315
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:54,582
You will, eh?
You're comin' with me.

1316
01:42:54,794 --> 01:42:57,036
I want a witness in case
anything goes wrong.

1317
01:42:57,171 --> 01:42:58,537
I'm sick of takin'
all the risks.

1318
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:00,751
- Now, don't be a fool.
- I said you're comin'.

1319
01:43:01,258 --> 01:43:03,591
- That means you're comin'.
- Red. Red.

1320
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:05,673
All right!

1321
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:31,570
What are you going
this way for?

1322
01:43:31,664 --> 01:43:33,121
I know what I'm doin'.

1323
01:43:33,207 --> 01:43:35,199
But he's gone to
the ballast pit.

1324
01:43:35,459 --> 01:43:37,416
And where does
he go after that?

1325
01:43:38,045 --> 01:43:40,253
Well, what are you
doing with number one?

1326
01:43:40,589 --> 01:43:42,251
I am number one.

1327
01:43:56,856 --> 01:43:58,392
We're here.

1328
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:12,698
He's taking it slow.

1329
01:44:14,373 --> 01:44:15,534
Tom came in.

1330
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:18,450
- Is he in the office?
- No, he went back out on the run.

1331
01:44:18,627 --> 01:44:21,415
I think he's in for it, too.
He took number one truck.

1332
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:23,542
- What?
- Red and Mr Cartley gone after him...

1333
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:26,379
- ...in number three.
- Oh, no!

1334
01:44:27,887 --> 01:44:29,298
Open the gate, Harry.

1335
01:44:45,696 --> 01:44:47,187
- Red...
- Shh.

1336
01:45:10,429 --> 01:45:14,799
- Red. Maybe we ought to...
- Ah?

1337
01:45:15,851 --> 01:45:17,058
This is cold blood.

1338
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:18,681
It's murder.

1339
01:45:18,813 --> 01:45:20,770
I DON'T WANT ANY
PART OF THIS!

1340
01:45:21,398 --> 01:45:22,514
LET ME GET
OUT OF HERE!

1341
01:45:22,566 --> 01:45:24,478
- Ah, sit tight.
- RED!

1342
01:45:24,735 --> 01:45:26,442
Sit tight.

1343
01:46:01,647 --> 01:46:03,013
YOU'VE GOT HIM.

1344
01:46:03,107 --> 01:46:05,019
Oh, we haven't.

1345
01:46:10,281 --> 01:46:12,238
- What's wrong?
- Brakes.

1346
01:46:13,784 --> 01:46:14,695
So!

1347
01:47:57,846 --> 01:47:59,007
TOM!
