(Episode 63)

4
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:13,733
What are you doing?

5
00:00:14,163 --> 00:00:15,193
I know I'm out of line,

6
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:17,263
but this is how I feel.

7
00:00:20,593 --> 00:00:21,593
I don't know anything.

8
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:24,293
I can't remember anything.

9
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:25,593
Aren't you refusing?

10
00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:29,863
Aren't you just refusing me and your memories?

11
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:33,363
I don't know how much the old Baek Do Hee loved you,

12
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:37,493
but this Baek Do Hee knows nothing.

13
00:00:38,603 --> 00:00:39,603
So...

14
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:42,593
don't force your feelings...

15
00:00:43,993 --> 00:00:45,033
upon me.

16
00:00:49,963 --> 00:00:51,233
I can't wait long.

17
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:54,363
I've gone too far.

18
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:57,293
I can't stop my feelings, no matter how hard I try!

19
00:00:59,763 --> 00:01:00,763
I won't wait any longer.

20
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:03,293
I'll go to you.

21
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:55,293
How did you know?

22
00:01:56,763 --> 00:01:58,163
I could tell...

23
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:01,333
it was your car.

24
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:14,793
Do you plan...

25
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:18,363
to marry Park Hui Kyung?

26
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:21,093
Why do you ask?

27
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:22,633
Tell me.

28
00:02:23,963 --> 00:02:25,433
Do you or don't you?

29
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:27,663
I have no reason to tell you.

30
00:02:29,363 --> 00:02:30,363
No.

31
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:32,863
To be more precise,

32
00:02:34,203 --> 00:02:35,963
I don't know what my answer is...

33
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:38,493
yet.

34
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:42,663
Then I will...

35
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,333
answer for you.

36
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:47,893
Don't...

37
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:50,193
marry him.

38
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:52,933
Why must I do that?

39
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:54,333
Please.

40
00:02:56,663 --> 00:02:58,093
If you marry Uncle,

41
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:00,733
you and I will become family.

42
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:04,533
We may live together in the same house.

43
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:09,533
I can't handle that.

44
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:15,463
Is it because I look like your past girlfriend who died?

45
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,963
It's not just your face.

46
00:03:20,193 --> 00:03:21,433
Of course, Na Yeon...

47
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:25,993
is completely different...

48
00:03:27,493 --> 00:03:28,493
from you.

49
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,463
She was warm...

50
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:35,863
and sweet.

51
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,293
But every so often,

52
00:03:39,993 --> 00:03:41,133
I see Na Yeon...

53
00:03:44,063 --> 00:03:45,263
in you.

54
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,333
Do you not like that?

55
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:51,693
I keep making mistakes.

56
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:58,293
I don't want to be associated with you any further.

57
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:00,333
So what do you want?

58
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:04,233
Once the franchise project is completed, I'll return to Baekdo.

59
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:06,263
You should return to BSS.

60
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:08,263
Then everything ends.

61
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:11,733
That way, everyone will be happy.

62
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:15,233
I'll suffer...

63
00:04:17,503 --> 00:04:18,693
until then.

64
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,393
Since that is...

65
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,763
the burden I must bear.

66
00:04:25,963 --> 00:04:27,363
I understand.

67
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:32,233
But who decides...

68
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,693
your burden?

69
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:39,693
Isn't it difficult to judge on your own?

70
00:04:45,093 --> 00:04:46,233
I suddenly want...

71
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:49,163
to marry Hui Kyung.

72
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:51,003
Ms Baek.

73
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,433
Don't be so shocked.

74
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,233
I'm not saying I will marry him.

75
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:02,063
But seeing you make mistakes...

76
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,503
is fun.

77
00:05:06,693 --> 00:05:08,533
And I'm curious as to why you feel...

78
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,003
you deserve to suffer.

79
00:05:12,363 --> 00:05:13,563
I feel like it'll be more fun...

80
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,933
if we live in the same house.

81
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:21,733
I'm sorry,

82
00:05:22,503 --> 00:05:24,093
but I don't plan to leave AP.

83
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:27,663
I'm sure you don't, either.

84
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:30,163
Goodbye, then.

85
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:09,433
Dong Jin!

86
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:13,593
Come here, Dong Jin!

87
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:27,093
Did Hui Kyung come by?

88
00:06:28,293 --> 00:06:31,293
Yes. We spoke briefly outside.

89
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:34,593
Go visit his mother often.

90
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:38,093
She seems very lonely and weak.

91
00:06:39,493 --> 00:06:41,493
Please do it for me.

92
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:45,063
Yes, I will.

93
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:46,463
Good night.

94
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:55,433
Must you make it so obvious?

95
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,993
What do you mean?

96
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:01,563
I've taken all I could.

97
00:07:02,063 --> 00:07:05,093
Do you know how you look when you talk about Hui Kyung's mum?

98
00:07:05,463 --> 00:07:07,963
Do you know how loving and desperate you look?

99
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:14,133
I've lived with your shell all my life,

100
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:16,633
seeing only your back.

101
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,233
Go!

102
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:20,433
If you long for her so much,

103
00:07:20,593 --> 00:07:22,863
go right now!

104
00:07:24,363 --> 00:07:26,193
What's wrong?

105
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:30,693
Pardon?

106
00:07:31,893 --> 00:07:34,893
Did you want to say something?

107
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:38,433
No, I don't.

108
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:40,393
Good night.

109
00:08:10,263 --> 00:08:11,263
What is it?

110
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:13,263
Is something wrong?

111
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,463
If you don't mind,

112
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:20,493
may I sleep here with you tonight?

113
00:08:32,193 --> 00:08:33,233
Do Hee...

114
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:36,363
hated sleeping...

115
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,333
with someone else.

116
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:41,263
She hated...

117
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,493
someone touching her.

118
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:52,763
I'm sorry for inconveniencing you.

119
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,333
You are not.

120
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:00,893
Once in a while,

121
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:03,663
it hurt my feelings.

122
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:09,263
I wondered if she would've been like that if I were her real mum.

123
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:18,763
May I ask...

124
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,103
how Do Hee and I...

125
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:25,993
were separated?

126
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:36,893
You must want to know.

127
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:42,933
Your real mum...

128
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:45,793
was a single mum.

129
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:48,293
One of the twins...

130
00:09:49,103 --> 00:09:50,333
was deathly ill...

131
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:53,563
and needed heart surgery...

132
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:55,933
as soon as she was born.

133
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,103
In exchange for the surgery,

134
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,993
I adopted Do Hee.

135
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,463
Dad...

136
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:11,493
doesn't know. I didn't want to tell him.

137
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:16,633
I wanted...

138
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:21,533
to keep a secret from him as well.

139
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:26,693
I guess I am...

140
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:29,563
your third mum.

141
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,333
But...

142
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:36,393
for me,

143
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:39,103
you are one.

144
00:10:40,563 --> 00:10:41,663
Because...

145
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:44,763
there must be only one Do Hee.

146
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:56,993
So...

147
00:11:00,263 --> 00:11:01,263
don't...

148
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,533
try so hard.

149
00:11:06,263 --> 00:11:07,963
Don't try to be nice to me,

150
00:11:10,493 --> 00:11:11,963
and don't work so hard.

151
00:11:13,593 --> 00:11:14,593
Just...

152
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:19,863
make mistakes,

153
00:11:21,863 --> 00:11:23,133
hurt me,

154
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:26,233
make me worry...

155
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:29,163
and...

156
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:31,633
act like my daughter...

157
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:34,993
once in a while.

158
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:38,233
Please.

159
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,333
You're home late.

160
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:17,763
Did you go somewhere?

161
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:21,793
I had some stuff at work that I didn't want to push off.

162
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:23,363
I stayed late to work on them.

163
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,233
You're fast.

164
00:12:31,193 --> 00:12:32,293
What do you mean?

165
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,893
They say men...

166
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:37,663
start lying about 2 to 3 years after marriage.

167
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:41,433
Isn't a few months too soon?

168
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:47,533
Baek Do Hee's house and a café!

169
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:49,463
Is this the office?

170
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:52,263
Was the work you didn't want to put off, meeting her?

171
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:55,963
What is this?

172
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:58,033
That's what I'd like to ask.

173
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,193
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth.

174
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,293
I didn't want to complicate things.

175
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:07,533
But you.

176
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:10,633
What do you think you're doing?

177
00:13:11,493 --> 00:13:14,463
What matters is that you started to lie to me!

178
00:13:15,193 --> 00:13:17,463
Why do you make me so pathetic?

179
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,963
Why must I become the type of woman...

180
00:13:21,393 --> 00:13:23,333
whom I thought was the most pathetic?

181
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:24,663
You're the one torturing yourself...

182
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:27,133
with those wild ideas!

183
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:30,563
No. Something is definitely there between the two of you.

184
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:32,093
You're definitely suspicious!

185
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:33,863
That's enough.

186
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:35,733
Okay?

187
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:37,363
Please.

188
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:39,593
Please stop! You're exhausting me!

I know you find me comfortable,

191
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:00,333
but you should still knock.

192
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:02,433
I'm sorry,

193
00:14:02,793 --> 00:14:05,033
but I'm in no state to think about manners.

194
00:14:06,363 --> 00:14:08,833
Tell me. What is it that made you lose...

195
00:14:09,263 --> 00:14:10,463
all manners?

196
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,793
Do you plan to marry Baek Do Hee?

197
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:14,933
Why do you ask that out of the blue?

198
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:17,563
If you plan to marry her,

199
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,833
keep an eye on her.

200
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:22,433
You're making no sense.

201
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:24,793
You understand exactly what I mean.

202
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:27,763
Baek Do Hee is confusing people all over the place.

203
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,933
With work, you...

204
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:33,163
and even Tae Joon.

205
00:14:36,363 --> 00:14:38,533
Please be the only person who is confused by her.

206
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:41,233
Just marry her already.

207
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,393
This is what I needed to say.

208
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:51,163
Please.

Wow. This is great.

Look at the comments. They love it!

214

This is all thanks to the experts' tasting,

215
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:28,063
as Mr Kang suggested.

216
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:30,493
I only did my job.

217
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,763
He's right. I guess the more pressed you are, you must take proper steps.

218
00:15:36,193 --> 00:15:37,893
Next is the advertisements.

219
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,163
Let's hear some ideas.

220
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:43,763
Many comment that the chicken is very unique.

221
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:45,763
How about a unique approach to the advertisement as well?

222
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:48,063
That's right.

223
00:15:48,293 --> 00:15:50,793
Rather than the big celebrities that are plastered everywhere,

224
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:52,893
how about something different?

225
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:56,193
Something comfortable and new.

226
00:15:57,063 --> 00:15:58,563
What about a middle-aged mum as the model?

227
00:15:59,463 --> 00:16:02,433
That's a good start, but is there a suitable model?

228
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:04,963
Of course, there is. We already have one.

229
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:08,093
Ms Yang Mal Sook, the owner.

230
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:10,893
She can be in the advertisement herself.

231
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:15,563
She has that "mum" look, that is pure and not fake.

232
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:19,433
Wow. That is a great idea.

233
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:21,333
She has my vote.

234
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:24,893
The model of an advertisement is the face of the company.

235
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:27,963
We can't decide so flippantly.

236
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:31,363
We must hear what the chairman and the business strategy team think.

237
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:33,633
We must work on it together.

238
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,333
Is that right?

239
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,693
Then call a meeting right away...

240
00:16:39,163 --> 00:16:41,363
so that we can work on it together.

241
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:46,633
Do you think that makes any sense?

242
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,363
Marketing is just as important as product development,

243
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,793
but you want to use the owner of the chicken place as the model?

244
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,463
I agree.

245
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,263
Ms Yang Mal Sook as the face of the new brand?

246
00:16:58,193 --> 00:17:00,633
I believe that is a reckless idea.

247
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,163
What do you think?

248
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:08,463
A brave idea always faces opposition from logic and reason.

249
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:12,033
We want to create a sense of trust and dependability...

250
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:13,963
by using the creator of the product.

251
00:17:14,593 --> 00:17:16,363
They say many times,

252
00:17:16,863 --> 00:17:18,693
people remember the celebrity in an advertisement...

253
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:21,693
and not the product they endorsed.

254
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,663
We want to go beyond star-marketing.

255
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:28,063
We believe the owner, Yang Mal Sook,

256
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:30,463
can be novel and help distinguish us.

257
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,593
We will move forward.

258
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:52,763
You're avoiding my gaze.

259
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:55,563
Did I?

260
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,693
I know it's difficult, but look me in the eye.

261
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:02,833
I need to give you a warning.

262
00:18:03,763 --> 00:18:04,763
Go ahead.

263
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:07,393
I'm sure it'll be very amusing.

264
00:18:07,993 --> 00:18:10,893
Why did you intentionally approach Tae Joon?

265
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:15,033
Is that what he said?

266
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:16,933
That I'm approaching him?

267
00:18:17,803 --> 00:18:18,803
What?

268

If you keep it up, you'll end up being an adulteress.

watch it.

00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:35,533
Don't worry about me.

273
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:39,393
Shall we weigh the odds?

274
00:18:40,963 --> 00:18:42,433
For whom will it be more detrimental?

275
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:45,763
Me or you?

276
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:48,993
I don't care...

277
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:51,363
since it isn't true anyway.

278
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:07,733
What is this?

279
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:10,233
Why did the experts give it such high scores?

280
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:12,803
And what are these complimentary reviews?

281
00:19:13,593 --> 00:19:15,863
I'm more baffled than you are.

282
00:19:16,993 --> 00:19:19,303
We can't underestimate them just because they're a local shop.

283
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:22,363
We need to take proper measures...

284
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:25,933
to get rid of Baek Do Hee and Yang Mal Sook.

285
00:19:27,303 --> 00:19:28,393
How?

286
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:30,233
I'll think about it.

287
00:19:31,093 --> 00:19:34,963
The more baffled you are, you must use a more baffling method.

288
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:37,803
Stay out of it.

289
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:40,233
What?

290
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:44,663
Careless schemes like last time won't work.

291
00:19:45,063 --> 00:19:46,933
I learned a lot from that.

292
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:49,033
I'm different now.

294
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:56,963
I won't let her succeed.

295
00:20:03,993 --> 00:20:06,533
Isn't there anywhere we can get money from?

296
00:20:07,063 --> 00:20:08,433
You startled me.

297
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:12,733

00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:20,493
Why would we lose it when we put in our money?

301

There's a tough lady in Gangnam...

302

Can't you get 20 or 30 thousand dollars somewhere?

305
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:31,803
Where would I get money?

306

I can't even afford to buy pills to kill myself with!

307

This isn't time for this!

308
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:39,163
I sweet-talked the director and got this far.

309
00:20:39,493 --> 00:20:40,963
We can't give up now!

310
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,833
What do you want me to do?

311
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:46,803
Then... Yes, your daughter-in-law.

312
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:49,333
Can't you go see her?

313
00:20:49,563 --> 00:20:52,863
Yes. I'm sure she has a lot of money.

314

It is not. You say that because you haven't met the director.

He's good-looking.

318

He'd never stab people in the back.

319
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:15,263

for my sake.

You can spend that much money without making it show.

322

He has no past works that I can find.

323

Why are you letting those people scam you? It's pathetic.

00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:32,933
You were on the phone for a while. Was that Mr Park?

343
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:35,733
Yes. They want to ask something about choosing a model...

344
00:22:35,893 --> 00:22:37,093
for their advertisements.

345
00:22:37,263 --> 00:22:39,533
They should handle it themselves.

346
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,563
Why does our opinion matter?

347
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,533
It matters a lot.

348
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:46,293
They want Mum to be the model.

349
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:48,063
Mum? Who's mum?

350
00:22:48,293 --> 00:22:49,363
- Our mum. - Oh my gosh.

351
00:22:50,463 --> 00:22:53,163
They want our Madam Yang Mal Sook to be the model.

352
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:54,363
What?

353
00:22:54,963 --> 00:22:57,363
How could I do that?

354
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:58,733
My gosh.

355
00:22:59,293 --> 00:23:00,833
- Enjoy. - Do you need anything?

356
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:02,633
May we get some more radish?

357
00:23:03,093 --> 00:23:05,063
- Would you like more of this? - It's so good.

358
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:06,333
Would you like more chicken?

359
00:23:06,393 --> 00:23:08,363
- Yes, please. - Just a minute.

360
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:09,963
Get back to work.

361
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:18,863
Hello.

362
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:22,063
Did the real estate broker call you?

363
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:25,763
I really like the building.

364
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,333
Yes.

365
00:23:28,963 --> 00:23:30,233
If you agree,

366
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:34,033
I'll buy it for a handsome price, higher than what you want.

367
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:37,933
Ms Park!

368
00:23:38,993 --> 00:23:40,463
I'll wait for your call.

369
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:45,363
What are you doing here?

370
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:49,233
I was passing by. I heard this place is good,

371
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:51,163
so I stopped by.

372
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,693
Yes, it tastes great.

373
00:23:53,963 --> 00:23:57,633
The problem is the owner has zero manners.

374
00:23:58,433 --> 00:23:59,463
But...

375
00:23:59,893 --> 00:24:01,933
do you still see Na Yeon's family?

376
00:24:02,563 --> 00:24:04,363
No way!

377
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:07,193
I came against my will today...

378
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,533
to give them a piece of my mind.

379
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:11,133
Fine.

380
00:24:11,863 --> 00:24:13,633
Fine, so please be cautious.

381
00:24:17,993 --> 00:24:19,033
Like mum, like daughter.

382
00:24:19,193 --> 00:24:21,493
They need to learn to fear their in-laws.

383
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:32,933
You should clear a table for your customer.

384
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,563
You're no customer.

385
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:38,933
Can't you see we're packed?

386
00:24:40,193 --> 00:24:41,993
How did you know?

387
00:24:42,293 --> 00:24:43,763
What? What do you mean?

388
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:46,733
Our boss is going to be the model for the chicken.

389
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:49,163
You'll see her on TV and in magazines, from now on.

390
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:53,693
Modelling isn't for anyone.

391
00:24:53,963 --> 00:24:56,033
You know I was cast in a movie.

392
00:24:56,193 --> 00:24:58,693
I was bumped up to the lead, too.

393
00:24:58,863 --> 00:25:00,833
The classy and elegant Ms Turtle.

394
00:25:03,593 --> 00:25:04,593
Ms Turtle...

395
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:07,363
Why are you laughing? It's true.

396
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:10,963
Don't even think about asking for autographs...

397
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:12,863
or photos later.

398
00:25:13,063 --> 00:25:15,163
We are too humble...

399
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:18,063
to ask such a big star for an autograph.

400
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:21,393
A big star such as yourself should go and film your movie.

401
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,833
Please leave, Ms Turtle. Goodbye, Ms Turtle.

402
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:26,693
My gosh.

403
00:25:26,963 --> 00:25:28,663
(Baekdo Construction)

404
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:32,793
I felt bad that I didn't come in yesterday,

405
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,493
so I packed lunch for everyone.

406
00:25:37,363 --> 00:25:40,733
You're making us welcome your absence.

407
00:25:42,363 --> 00:25:45,333
- I'll give Mr Park his. - That isn't his.

408
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:47,593
Why? Are they all different?

409
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:48,863
- Yes. - What?

410
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:50,733
You wrote us a letter.

411
00:25:51,963 --> 00:25:54,293
That's why the lunch boxes are all different.

412
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:57,663
I wrote a little something to brighten your day.

413
00:25:58,063 --> 00:26:00,633
It's brighter already. Thank you.

414
00:26:01,233 --> 00:26:02,293
Take your time.

415
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:03,533
Thank you.

416
00:26:08,893 --> 00:26:09,893
Enjoy.

417
00:26:28,393 --> 00:26:29,963
You skip breakfast often, don't you?

418
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:31,893
You pass on lunch...

419
00:26:32,393 --> 00:26:33,963
and forget to eat dinner.

420
00:26:34,463 --> 00:26:36,963
Make sure to eat lunch today.

421
00:26:37,593 --> 00:26:41,063
Enjoy, and have a wonderful afternoon.

422
00:26:56,463 --> 00:26:58,433
Did you ask for me?

423
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:01,163
I wanted to thank you for the delicious lunch.

424
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:04,233
Thank you.

425
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:08,493
Did I confuse you?

426
00:27:09,563 --> 00:27:10,563
What?

427
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:12,163
You are...

428
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:14,133
a good person.

429
00:27:15,063 --> 00:27:18,333
You are also a good business partner.

430
00:27:18,693 --> 00:27:19,693
That's enough.

431
00:27:21,663 --> 00:27:24,293
Tell me the rest another time.

432
00:27:28,293 --> 00:27:30,793
I made some for your mother, while I was at it.

433
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:33,063
Please have an assistant bring it to her.

434
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:36,333
Please bring it to her yourself.

435
00:27:37,593 --> 00:27:39,863
Don't feel awkward. Keep it separate from me.

436
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:45,133
To be honest, my mum has grown very weak.

437
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:47,533
If not for your visiting every so often,

438
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:49,593
she may crumble.

439
00:27:55,863 --> 00:27:59,463
Yes. Not Lee Yoon Ae, but her daughter.

440
00:27:59,593 --> 00:28:01,563
Please find her daughter.

441
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:04,693
Of course.

442
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:09,133
What I sent its everything I know about Yoon Ae.

443
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,593
Yes. Yes.

444
00:28:12,033 --> 00:28:13,393
Please.

445
00:28:16,493 --> 00:28:18,163
What do you think you're doing?

446
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,163
What are you doing?

447
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:22,833
What's wrong with you?

448
00:28:23,563 --> 00:28:26,633
Why do you care about me looking for Yoon Ae's daughter?

449
00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:29,033
Why are you looking for her now?

450
00:28:30,393 --> 00:28:32,333
You're acting strange.

451
00:28:32,563 --> 00:28:36,093
Is there any reason why I can't find Yoon Ae's daughter?

452
00:28:38,693 --> 00:28:39,693
Do you...

453
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,593
know where Yoon Ae's daughter is?

454
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:45,893
Where is she? Tell me, if you know.

455
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:49,133
I need to tell Yoon Ae's daughter something!

456
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:52,133
What? What will you tell her?

457
00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:54,033
That's none of your business.

458
00:28:57,233 --> 00:28:58,793
What are you doing?

459
00:28:58,993 --> 00:29:00,793
You're being rude to your elder.

460
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:03,533
Are you all right, Madam?

461
00:29:09,963 --> 00:29:12,733
How long have you lived with me?

462
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,463
It's almost 10 years.

463
00:29:15,763 --> 00:29:16,963
It's been that long already.

464
00:29:18,263 --> 00:29:20,493
We must've grown on each other quite a bit.

465
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:25,463
It must be easier since we have two housekeepers now.

466
00:29:26,963 --> 00:29:28,563
It's better being alone.

467
00:29:29,263 --> 00:29:31,463
That housekeeper constantly nags...

468
00:29:31,733 --> 00:29:33,293
as if she's my manager.

469
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,063
It's quite stressful, actually.

470
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:37,733
Is that right?

471
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:45,193
Aren't we going to have lunch?

472
00:29:45,693 --> 00:29:48,363
Madam, you already ate.

473
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:51,993
You said you were hungry and ate early.

474
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,893
That's right.

475
00:29:58,433 --> 00:29:59,563
I did.

476
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:18,633
What are you looking for? I'll find it. What is it?

477
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:19,793
Forget it.

478
00:30:20,363 --> 00:30:21,463
Forget it!

479
00:30:37,493 --> 00:30:39,693
(I hope today will be so precious that you'll be sad to let it go.)

480
00:30:40,063 --> 00:30:42,733
(Have the best day today, so good that you'll be sad to let it go.)

481
00:31:19,193 --> 00:31:20,563
You changed your room.

482
00:31:20,893 --> 00:31:23,163
Yes, it just happened.

483
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:32,433
The frame broke, so I just put it up like that.

484
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:35,693
Why? Do you recognise someone?

485
00:31:36,763 --> 00:31:37,863
No.

486
00:31:38,793 --> 00:31:41,393
I packed you lunch. I hope you like it.

487
00:31:41,763 --> 00:31:44,263
Wow. A lunch box.

488
00:31:45,793 --> 00:31:50,193
This reminds me of the times we hung out in high school.

489
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:52,733
Actually,

490
00:31:53,493 --> 00:31:57,993
I'm looking for the daughter of a close friend from high school.

491
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:00,233
A friend's daughter?

492
00:32:00,893 --> 00:32:01,993
Who?

493
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,063
Here.

494
00:32:05,793 --> 00:32:07,363
Do you see this pretty girl?

495
00:32:08,863 --> 00:32:10,563
Her name is Lee Yoon Ae.

496
00:32:11,193 --> 00:32:14,633
Actually, she passed a long time ago.

497
00:32:15,663 --> 00:32:19,363
So I'm looking for Yoon Ae's daughter.

498
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:21,633
I have something to tell her.

499
00:32:23,493 --> 00:32:24,733
Something to tell her?

500
00:32:25,363 --> 00:32:28,893
Yes. I need to tell her something. I have to.

501
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,393
(The Promise)

502
00:32:49,563 --> 00:32:51,363
I don't want you coming so frequently.

503
00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:53,393
You signed with AP Foods, correct?

504
00:32:53,563 --> 00:32:54,733
Sign with us instead.

505
00:32:54,893 --> 00:32:56,863
Take care of your mother. She's grown mentally weak.

506
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:59,533
Are you treating me like a patient? I'm fine!

507
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:01,763
Cry when you want and get angry when you want.

508
00:33:01,933 --> 00:33:03,693
To think the heir of Baekdo tails her husband...
