1
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:32,113
I'm just gonna get some flowers, dear.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

2
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,566
It's tulip season today.
I'm so happy.

3
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:43,211
- Son of the bitch.
- Come on, sweetie.

4
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:47,560
Come on, sweetie.

5
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,613
Excuse me.

6
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:55,576
Yes, come on.
Come on, now.

7
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:03,316
Go for a little ride,
then you can whiz all over the city.

8
00:01:03,884 --> 00:01:07,975
Go for a ride.
Come on. Come on, sweetie.

9
00:01:08,142 --> 00:01:10,189
No! Freeze, freeze.

10
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:13,987
Leg down. Leg down. Leg down.
Leg down. That's it.

11
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,870
That's it. Come on, now.

12
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:24,215
No! You monkey-eared son of...

13
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:29,142
You have pissed your last floor.

14
00:01:29,309 --> 00:01:32,884
I bet you wish you were a real...

15
00:01:34,152 --> 00:01:37,409
You dog-eared monkey.

16
00:01:38,387 --> 00:01:40,085
This is New York.

17
00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:43,752
If you can make it here,
you can make it anywhere.

18
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:45,482
You ugly, smelly...

19
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:50,443
AS GOOD AS IT GETS

20
00:01:52,588 --> 00:01:54,585
Verdell?

21
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:58,117
Verdell?

22
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:03,201
Where's my good doggie?
Verdell?

23
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:06,000
Come here, sweetheart.

24
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:10,209
- Mr. Udall?
- Yes?

25
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:16,854
- Have you seen Verdell?
- What does he look like?

26
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:22,369
My dog, you know...

27
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:26,416
My dog with the little face,
little adorable face.

28
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,809
Don't you know what my dog looks like?

29
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,640
I got it.

30
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:32,678
- You were talking about your dog.
- Yeah.

31
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:37,210
I thought it was the name of that colored man
that I've been seeing in the halls.

32
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:39,953
Which color was that?

33
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:45,111
Like thick molasses with a broad nose.

34
00:02:45,152 --> 00:02:48,032
Perfect for smelling trouble
and prison food.

35
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,485
Frank!

36
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,652
- You have got to get dressed.
- Frank Sachs. Melvin Udall.

37
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:54,654
How are you doing?

38
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,603
Frank shows my work, Mr. Udall.
I think you know that.

39
00:02:58,604 --> 00:03:00,062
People are gonna start coming.
Please.

40
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:04,013
What I know is as long as you keep
your work zipped up around me,

41
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:07,062
I don't give a rat crap what or where
you shove you show.

42
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,870
Are we done being neighbors for now?

43
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:17,794
- Let me talk to you for a minute.
- No, no, no. Not worth it.

44
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:20,245
Definitely not worth it.
Verdell must be in the apartment.

45
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:23,162
Okay.

46
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:28,578
Hope you find him.
Love that dog.

47
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:33,171
You don't love anything, Mr. Udall.

48
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:59,624
One, two, three, four, five.

49
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,506
One, two, three, four, five.

50
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:27,211
Hot! Hot, hot, hot!

51
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:47,376
- Hi, Carl.
- Frank.

52
00:04:47,438 --> 00:04:49,350
- So, where is he?
- He's here, isn't he? He lives here.

53
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:51,753
Take it easy.
He just had a little thing with the dog.

54
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:54,606
- It's not such a hot-looking dog.
- He's adorable.

55
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:57,755
Where are you going, Frank?
Who buys more than me?

56
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:02,121
My honey, where have you been?

57
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:07,758
Look at my boy! Look at him!

58
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:15,732
- I found him, Mr. Bishop.
- I know you did. We know you did.

59
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,363
Where was my little baby?
Where was my baby?

60
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:22,498
In the basement garbage bin,
eating diaper shit.

61
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:32,095
- Go ahead, John. You earned your fun.
- I'm sorry. It just struck me as funny.

62
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:33,506
Wait.

63
00:05:34,242 --> 00:05:39,471
How did he get down in the basement?
I mean, even if he got in the elevator...

64
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:44,063
Maybe some nice neighbor shoved him
down the garbage chute.

65
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:52,973
"Somewhere in the dark, she confessed,
and he had forgiven."

66
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,104
"This is what you live for, he said."

67
00:05:56,271 --> 00:06:00,027
"Two heads on a pillow,
where all is approval."

68
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:04,954
"There is only the safety of
being with each other."

69
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:10,882
"How she wondered, could she find such
hope in the most shameful part of her?"

70
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,643
- Mr. Udall!
- "At last, she was able to define love."

71
00:06:16,853 --> 00:06:19,032
"Love was..."

72
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,293
Mr. Udall, I'd like to speak to you, please.
Let me do this by myself.

73
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,258
- "Love was..."
- Are you in there?

74
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,618
Son of a bitch!

75
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:32,926
Pansy ass stool pusher!

76
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:34,565
Yes!

77
00:06:35,582 --> 00:06:37,793
Maybe this can wait.

78
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:42,904
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

79
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:51,588
Well, that's a load off.

80
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:55,905
Did you do something to him?

81
00:06:55,972 --> 00:06:59,474
Do you realize that I work at home?

82
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:02,434
No. I wasn't aware.

83
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,077
Do you like to be interrupted when
you're nancing around in your little garden?

84
00:07:09,582 --> 00:07:14,008
No, no. I actually will turn the
ringer off on my phone.

85
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:18,141
- Sometimes put a piece of cardboard...
- I work all the time.

86
00:07:18,308 --> 00:07:22,441
So never, never interrupt me.
Okay?

87
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:27,366
Not if there's a fire, not even if you hear
the sound of a thud from my home.

88
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:32,376
One week later, there's a smell coming from
there that can only be a decaying human body.

89
00:07:32,544 --> 00:07:37,930
You have to hold a hankie to your face because
the stench that you think you're gonna faint.

90
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:41,645
Even then, don't come knocking.

91
00:07:41,854 --> 00:07:48,098
If it's election night, and you're
excited and you want to celebrate

92
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:53,557
because some fudge-packer was elected
the first queer president of the US

93
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:58,470
and he's going to have you down
to Camp David,

94
00:07:58,637 --> 00:08:02,728
and you want someone to share
the moment with.

95
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:08,032
Even then, don't knock.
Not on this door.

96
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:11,538
Not for any reason.

97
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:15,588
Do you get me sweetheart?

98
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:23,900
Yes. It's not a subtle point
that you're making.

99
00:08:24,563 --> 00:08:26,624
Okay, then.

100
00:08:39,343 --> 00:08:43,188
So, the theory of confrontation says now
he'll think twice before messing with me.

101
00:08:53,078 --> 00:08:55,645
"Love was..."

102
00:08:58,797 --> 00:09:01,220
What was love?

103
00:09:02,012 --> 00:09:04,842
"Love was..."

104
00:09:09,486 --> 00:09:13,378
Now I'm pissed.
Now I am really pissed!

105
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,275
Don't touch!
Don't touch!

106
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:18,318
Shut up!

107
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:22,434
You can intimidate the whole world with
your attitude, but you don't intimidate me.

108
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,393
I grew up in hell, homeboy.
My grandmother had more attitude.

109
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:27,642
Police!

110
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:32,944
Doughnut munching morons!
Help me! Help me!

111
00:09:33,646 --> 00:09:34,639
Shut up!

112
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:37,708
Assault and battery and you're black!

113
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:42,300
I like Simon! I like him enough
to batter you unrecognizable

114
00:09:42,468 --> 00:09:47,227
if you verbally abuse him or so much
as touch that dog again.

115
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:55,953
Meantime, I'm gonna think of some
way that you can make it up to him.

116
00:09:56,118 --> 00:10:00,637
I hate doing this!
I'm an art dealer.

117
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:03,634
Have a nice day.

118
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:05,813
Party!

119
00:10:25,327 --> 00:10:26,457
Excuse me.

120
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,706
- Don't touch. Don't touch.
- Get a life.

121
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:34,162
- Hey, watch it!
- Don't touch!

122
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:45,091
- Look at you. You're all better.
- It's that new medication.

123
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:48,639
So you know all my son's stuff, right?
No, no, no, no. I got a date tonight.

124
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:50,574
I'm walking out the door.
He says to me:

125
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,884
"Mom, I promise not to get one of
my fevers or coughs during your date."

126
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,016
- Isn't that sweet?
- Little blonde angel.

127
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,761
I said, "you love me the way
you love your remote control."

128
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:04,305
"As long as I switch every time you
press one of my buttons."

129
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:06,132
- That's great.
- I know, yeah.

130
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:10,775
I think people that talk in metaphors
ought to shampoo my crotch.

131
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:13,061
- Eat up!
- Good.

132
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:15,926
- Stay there. I've got your money.
- No, you pay me next week.

133
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:19,033
No, I owe you. I told you today.
That's the rule.

134
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,162
- Excuse me, Melvin.
- Don't...

135
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:27,402
- There you go. You take care.
- Thank you.

136
00:11:30,104 --> 00:11:33,206
Pardon. Pardon me.

137
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:35,562
Take the money.
Debts make me crazy.

138
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:38,994
This way you take a cab home so
you have time to get ready for the date.

139
00:11:38,995 --> 00:11:41,369
Ready is not my problem.

140
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:43,623
I'm starving.

141
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:46,526
Sit down. You know you're
not allowed back here.

142
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,052
Spence is more excited by it than I am.

143
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:52,552
He says, "Mom, I promise not to get
a fever or cough during your date."

144
00:11:53,184 --> 00:11:56,356
Sometimes, this kid,
you just wanna...

145
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,686
- I've got Jews at my table.
- It's not your table.

146
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:01,577
It's the place's table. Behave.

147
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:04,188
This once, you can sit
at someone else's station.

148
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,146
Or you can wait your turn.

149
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:19,787
How much more you got to eat?

150
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:26,618
Appetites aren't as big
as your noses, huh?

151
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:29,283
- What?
- That's it. Forget it.

152
00:12:29,284 --> 00:12:31,172
- Let me talk to him.
- I don't care how long he's been coming.

153
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,212
- Let's go.
- I'm gonna give him one more chance.

154
00:12:33,246 --> 00:12:35,650
- Barred for life.
- Here I go! Here I go!

155
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:49,964
- They left.
- Yeah, what do you know?

156
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:55,449
Bryan says he doesn't care how
long you've been coming.

157
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,477
You ever act like this again,
you're barred for life.

158
00:12:58,646 --> 00:13:01,823
I'm gonna miss the excitement,
but I'll handle it.

159
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:05,493
Three eggs over easy.

160
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,412
Two sausages, six strips of bacon
with fries.

161
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:11,574
- Fries today?
- A short stack.

162
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:14,178
Coffee with cream and sweetener.

163
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:17,393
You're gonna die soon with that diet,
you know that.

164
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,105
We're all gonna die soon.

165
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:22,549
I' will, you will, and it sure
sounds like your son will.

166
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,737
If you ever mention my son again,

167
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:47,996
you will never be able to eat here again.
Do you understand?

168
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:59,598
Give me some sign you understand,
or leave now.

169
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:06,243
Do you understand me,
you crazy fuck?

170
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,571
Do you?

171
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:22,730
Yeah. Yes.

172
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,835
I'll get your order.

173
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:36,733
I wan't you wear my earrings tonight.

174
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:44,647
It's just so interesting what you said
at dinner. You said it like it was nothing.

175
00:14:49,783 --> 00:14:54,320
- Where's the bedroom?
- The truth is... This is sort of it.

176
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:58,310
I sort of sleep in here.

177
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:10,366
Don't worry about it.

178
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:36,426
What?

179
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,924
I don't know.

180
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:50,194
Grandma! Grandma!

181
00:15:50,345 --> 00:15:52,394
Maybe you'd better check.

182
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:55,743
What'd you think I was gonna do?

183
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:01,412
- I'm sorry.
- Mom!

184
00:16:01,447 --> 00:16:04,815
I was hearing everything that
you were doing, so

185
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,086
I put these on to give you privacy.

186
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,621
- So how was dinner?
- Hi, pal.

187
00:16:11,662 --> 00:16:13,976
- How's your friend?
- You okay?

188
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:16,471
- Not bad.
- You got a temperature?

189
00:16:16,472 --> 00:16:18,462
Scootch over.

190
00:16:18,476 --> 00:16:22,025
- Where did your friend take you to eat?
- Nice place.

191
00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:26,333
Carol, I have him.

192
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:31,157
- One more spit.
- I said I have him. He's waiting.

193
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:33,395
- Go.
- She has me.

194
00:16:33,538 --> 00:16:36,547
- Okay, pal. Give me a hug.
- Carol.

195
00:16:36,548 --> 00:16:39,612
- Give me a big hug.
- Carol, I have him.

196
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:42,829
I'm okay, mom.
She has me. Go.

197
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:49,846
Close the curtains.

198
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:57,127
No, no, no. You can't smoke.
He can't take smoke.

199
00:17:00,325 --> 00:17:02,286
Magic.

200
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:16,303
God. Well, that'll teach you.
I don't even notice it anymore.

201
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:19,045
All right. Come here.

202
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,595
It's all right. You don't have to get that
embarrassed. It's a little bit of throw-up.

203
00:17:32,596 --> 00:17:34,777
Little bit of throw-up?

204
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:40,063
What should we do?

205
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:43,497
Want me to write down which trains you
take to get home, or you wanna lay down

206
00:17:43,508 --> 00:17:46,704
No, no. I'll take a cab.

207
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:57,020
Just a little too much reality
for a Friday night.

208
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:05,294
I just can't. I promised Simon
I'd find him a model.

209
00:18:05,361 --> 00:18:09,136
Carl, take me off the speaker. Did I
tell you that these are house seats?

210
00:18:09,202 --> 00:18:11,400
Come on. You could use a break.

211
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:15,514
Hello? Carl? You there?

212
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:20,241
Okay.
I just found a model.

213
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:23,559
Hey, boys!

214
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,135
Hey, look! I know this guy.
He even brought me dinner.

215
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:27,879
Carl, right?

216
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:32,439
Hey, what's going on?

217
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,169
- Hey, hi, remember?
- I only need one.

218
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:41,567
You picked me up, maybe a few weeks,
I don't know, sometime ago.

219
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:44,249
But this is for a portrait.
I need a pretty face.

220
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,114
Portrait?

221
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,237
Come here. I'll give you the address.
It's for tomorrow morning.

222
00:18:50,342 --> 00:18:54,683
- Brad Pitt. It's the shit.
- Do you read?

223
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:02,073
Who is it, baby?

224
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:08,545
Who is that, Verdell?
Who is that?

225
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,412
I'm sorry. I told you today.

226
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,145
I was out in the studio doing my work,
and I just...

227
00:19:18,064 --> 00:19:19,876
It's out here.

228
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:23,554
- You sure have great things.
- Gershwin. He's great, isn't he?

229
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:27,829
I usually make such a big deal about
picking models, but Carl is so thorough.

230
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:31,562
I bet he drove you nuts
checking your resume, huh?

231
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:38,416
This is not a nude.

232
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:41,882
Just kidding around.

233
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:45,028
So much for love.

234
00:19:46,507 --> 00:19:48,469
And yet another pose.

235
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,148
Exactly what is your previous
experience?

236
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,002
How about that?

237
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:55,675
I'm running out of ideas here.

238
00:19:57,954 --> 00:20:00,157
Well, then give me some
direction, ok?

239
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:05,011
Nothing. I just watch until
something strikes me.

240
00:20:05,046 --> 00:20:07,898
I mean, do anything that you think of.

241
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:13,335
Wait for me to say, "hold that pose,"
and then just try to comfortably hold it.

242
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:17,535
No direction.

243
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:20,341
Okay.

244
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:24,840
What I do is, I watch.

245
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,016
You ever watch somebody who
doesn't know that you're watching them.

246
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:33,859
An old woman sitting on a bus,
or kids going to school

247
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:39,453
or somebody just waiting. And
you see this flash come over them,

248
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,850
and you know immediately that it has
nothing to do with anything external.

249
00:20:43,886 --> 00:20:45,871
Because that hasn't changed.

250
00:20:45,906 --> 00:20:50,184
And when you see it, they're just sort
of "realer" and they're more alive.

251
00:20:51,268 --> 00:20:55,903
I mean, you look at someone long enough,
you discover their humanity.

252
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:03,234
No, no. I know exactly
what you mean.

253
00:21:08,177 --> 00:21:12,645
Oh, my God.
Hold it.

254
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,028
Hey, look out!

255
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:19,157
Excuse me.

256
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:24,117
So I went in, and I got on
the third line of dialogue.

257
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:27,549
And all of a sudden, I blanked.
I had no clue as to what the next line was.

258
00:21:27,715 --> 00:21:30,004
Clippity-clop, clippity-clop.
Ignores me.

259
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:34,354
- So he said to me, "Last chance."
- Last chance.

260
00:21:34,521 --> 00:21:37,835
- So I came back in.
- Here she comes to ignore me again.

261
00:21:37,902 --> 00:21:42,245
I messed up in the exact same line.
I know. But guess what?

262
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:43,340
What?

263
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:45,208
He cast me!

264
00:21:45,376 --> 00:21:48,533
Just what the world needs.
Another actress.

265
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:50,570
Okay. Okay.

266
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:59,520
Can't live without me?

267
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,126
I'm finally going to ask. All right.
What's with the plastic picnic ware?

268
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:11,260
Why don't you try ours?
Are you afraid it isn't clean?

269
00:22:11,326 --> 00:22:14,459
I see the help. It's a judgment call.

270
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,235
So give yourself a little pep talk:

271
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:22,240
"Must try other people's clean silverware
as part of the fun of dining out."

272
00:22:24,495 --> 00:22:29,337
- What's wrong with your son?
- What do you care?

273
00:22:37,653 --> 00:22:39,850
He's got to fight to breathe.

274
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:42,373
His asthma can just shoot off the charts.

275
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:45,022
He's allergic to dust,
and this is New York,

276
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:48,911
so his immune system bails on him
whenever there's trouble, so an ear infection

277
00:22:49,877 --> 00:22:53,552
- ls this bothering you?
- No.

278
00:22:55,347 --> 00:22:59,313
An ear infection, whatever, sends us
to the emergency room five, six times a month,

279
00:22:59,522 --> 00:23:03,446
where I get whatever nine year-old
they just made a doctor.

280
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:05,994
Nice chatting with you.

281
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:10,877
- His name?
- Spencer.

282
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:13,408
Okay.

283
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:17,223
Spence.

284
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:26,450
Puppy. It's okay.
Go on. Go on.

285
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,056
You can put on anything you want now.

286
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,084
I might be sort of done here.

287
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,877
I've been coming here for two weeks,
and all we've done is work. Let's play!

288
00:23:58,305 --> 00:24:05,026
- So you're practically finished?
- Yeah. There is one more stage.

289
00:24:11,381 --> 00:24:13,063
Where are you going?

290
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:15,589
No place.
I was just gonna sneak a peek.

291
00:24:27,696 --> 00:24:31,788
- Verdell, you want some chocolate?
- No. He's not allowed.

292
00:24:31,954 --> 00:24:36,672
Wait! I gotta take off. Do you
wanna say good-bye or anything?

293
00:24:36,739 --> 00:24:37,802
Yeah.

294
00:24:37,803 --> 00:24:40,537
- He's just got to go. One second.
- No, wait.

295
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,102
I'm gonna look at the painting,
all right?

296
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,906
Where are you going, sweetheart?
Verdell?

297
00:24:52,412 --> 00:24:55,709
Want some water?
What is the matter with you? Come on.

298
00:24:55,918 --> 00:24:58,006
You want some water?

299
00:25:01,513 --> 00:25:04,059
Simon, wait!

300
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,915
Why are you doing this?

301
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,099
No, no, wait, wait...

302
00:25:24,266 --> 00:25:27,732
- That painting in there...
- What are you doing, cruising him?

303
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:38,544
Excuse me.

304
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:42,683
- Help me!
- We gotta go! Come on!

305
00:25:44,222 --> 00:25:46,185
Come on.

306
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,830
Okay, so you call 911
and don't leave your name?

307
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:02,450
That's right. Yes.

308
00:26:02,486 --> 00:26:06,134
- Even a dumb geezer should know...
- Just move on. No one was killed.

309
00:26:06,135 --> 00:26:08,412
- Is he dead?
- Ask him.

310
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:09,912
What's wrong with you?

311
00:26:10,274 --> 00:26:13,447
Don't bark at me.
I didn't name you.

312
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:18,123
We will. And if we can't, we'll come
back and ask you again and again.

313
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,709
Hey, what are you trying to
intimidate me with that attitude?

314
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:25,831
I come from hell. My grandmother's
got more attitude than you.

315
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:29,061
Go shake down a 7-11
for a day-old wiener.

316
00:26:29,062 --> 00:26:30,881
It's just a matter of time, sir.

317
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:32,973
There's a painting of one of the
guys in here.

318
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:34,482
Get some tape on it.

319
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:39,195
I've been praying for him
since I heard.

320
00:26:39,196 --> 00:26:42,146
So, anyway, I'm on my way
to the hospital.

321
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:44,783
If you could just watch the dog.
Just for tonight.

322
00:26:44,784 --> 00:26:46,404
- No, no.
- No?

323
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,518
- No. I'm sorry.
- Okay. Thanks.

324
00:26:50,896 --> 00:26:54,135
Old bitch. Damn dog.

325
00:26:58,453 --> 00:27:01,698
You're taking him.
Yes! Yes, you are!

326
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:04,521
Get the hell out of the way!
You're taking him.

327
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:07,369
This will even the books.
One night.

328
00:27:07,637 --> 00:27:09,600
Wait, wait. Wait!

329
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:13,900
You wanna say "no" to me?
You wanna say "no" to me?

330
00:27:19,244 --> 00:27:22,451
I don't want to say nothing to you.

331
00:27:23,168 --> 00:27:26,398
Because I've never felt this crazy
as I do right now.

332
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,232
I almost want you to say "no."

333
00:27:32,904 --> 00:27:35,149
Thanks for looking after him.

334
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:39,498
Hey! Where are you going?
You can't do this!

335
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:42,480
You don't wanna mess with
me today.

336
00:27:42,498 --> 00:27:47,207
I can't take a dog.
Nobody's ever been in here before!

337
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:53,729
Hey, Frank.
Frank.

338
00:28:17,233 --> 00:28:20,373
One, two, three, four.

339
00:28:40,404 --> 00:28:42,634
You're dead.

340
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:47,042
We don't have no dog food here.
We don't want no dog food here.

341
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:50,776
You'll eat what we got.
What we eat.

342
00:29:00,902 --> 00:29:03,366
Don't you do anything!

343
00:29:18,187 --> 00:29:20,692
Where's the trust?

344
00:29:30,085 --> 00:29:33,745
Never a break. Never. Dogs.

345
00:29:42,254 --> 00:29:48,298
<i>Always look at the bright side
of your life</i>

346
00:29:50,785 --> 00:29:56,368
<i>Always look at the lighter side
of your life</i>

347
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,712
God!

348
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:10,367
We're not gonna sell anything if they
find out we're halfway through a show

349
00:30:10,368 --> 00:30:12,328
and we haven't sold
a single painting!

350
00:30:12,362 --> 00:30:15,026
No, we can't reduce the price
at this stage!

351
00:30:15,655 --> 00:30:18,946
- I'm in a free fall here. Yes?
- We can see him.

352
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:21,012
Okay.
I'll meet you in there.

353
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:26,680
I'll meet you in there, okay?
One minute.

354
00:30:27,511 --> 00:30:29,996
Thank you.
No, I'm here.

355
00:30:32,146 --> 00:30:36,697
- How are you doing, great one?
- I haven't looked at myself yet.

356
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:39,974
I figured
I could tell from your reaction.

357
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:46,127
- That bad?
- Okay. I talked to the doctor and...

358
00:30:46,128 --> 00:30:47,742
Shit!

359
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:52,553
Okay. It's not that bad.

360
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:56,050
I talked to the doctors, they say you're
gonna be your old self in a couple weeks.

361
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:00,311
I mean the scars here might
take a little... Oh, shit!

362
00:31:06,714 --> 00:31:08,677
- Jackie.
- Yes?

363
00:31:08,843 --> 00:31:12,917
- Can you hand me a mirror, please?
- No.

364
00:31:19,572 --> 00:31:23,497
Wait. I have a smaller one.

365
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:36,457
So how are things, anyway?

366
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:39,308
How is Verdell?

367
00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:43,052
Your neighbor, Mr. Udall
taking care of him.

368
00:31:43,087 --> 00:31:45,868
How could you that?

369
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:48,852
- He'll hurt him.
- No, Simon. I promise.

370
00:31:48,887 --> 00:31:53,514
Not a chance. I own this guy.
Besides, there was nobody else.

371
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:56,647
I'm always on the move and...

372
00:31:56,812 --> 00:31:59,152
Trust me.

373
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:02,620
You are very certain my dog is okay,
because you have no idea...

374
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,627
Yes, your dog is fine, Simon.

375
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:08,235
Okay.

376
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:14,590
Waiting gives the devil time.

377
00:32:31,423 --> 00:32:33,161
Oh, my!

378
00:32:44,073 --> 00:32:46,595
Where did I go?

379
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,983
- That's your dog?
- No. No.

380
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,716
What are you doing with a dog?

381
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,201
Suckered in, set up, pushed around.

382
00:32:58,202 --> 00:33:00,648
You're not worried someone
might take it?

383
00:33:02,882 --> 00:33:05,888
No, not until now, for christ sake.

384
00:33:06,555 --> 00:33:09,579
- Sorry.
- I'm going to sit here.

385
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:13,110
- Hey, puppy.
- He's cute.

386
00:33:13,904 --> 00:33:17,368
I love his little face.
It's so cute.

387
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:20,140
I wonder what breed he is.

388
00:33:24,091 --> 00:33:28,891
He's a little dog. Next time if Bryan's
not here, you can bring him in.

389
00:33:31,605 --> 00:33:33,976
How old are you?

390
00:33:34,143 --> 00:33:37,971
If I was gonna guess by your eyes,
I'd say you were 50.

391
00:33:38,051 --> 00:33:40,989
If I went by your eyes,
I'd say you were kind.

392
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,907
So much for eyes, but as long as
you bring up age, how old are you?

393
00:33:44,943 --> 00:33:46,499
- No, no.
- You brought it up.

394
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,710
I'm curious.
You brought it up.

395
00:33:47,744 --> 00:33:49,796
In other words, not that you're ugly.
That's not what I'm saying.

396
00:33:49,797 --> 00:33:52,464
Easy, easy, pal.
I can take the compliment.

397
00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:57,114
But my knees start knocking when
you turn on the charm full blast.

398
00:33:57,322 --> 00:34:00,955
No, but I mean, what's with the dark?

399
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:05,589
Dawn patrol.

400
00:34:05,755 --> 00:34:09,555
Major dawn patrol.
My son had a full-blown attack.

401
00:34:09,722 --> 00:34:14,322
And this time, for extra fun,
they gave us the wrong antibiotics.

402
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:17,771
- So I get him home...
- No, no!

403
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,372
The dog.
It's bacon for the dog.

404
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:28,467
Last week I was playing the piano
for him. And he likes it.

405
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:33,726
So I decide
I'm going to make a little joke.

406
00:34:33,727 --> 00:34:35,776
So, you're all set here?

407
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:48,297
I think it's a beautiful day for our
walk today. Very nice.

408
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:03,912
Look at that!
Look at him!

409
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,388
I gotta give you something. I gotta
give you something real good, too.

410
00:35:09,631 --> 00:35:13,389
I'm gonna show it to you.
Come on, buddy.

411
00:35:14,641 --> 00:35:17,606
Don't be like me.
Don't you be like me.

412
00:35:17,772 --> 00:35:20,931
You stay just the way you are,
because you are a perfect man,

413
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:24,237
and I'm gonna take you home
and get you something to eat.

414
00:35:24,238 --> 00:35:26,063
What you love, you hear me?

415
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,794
I'd like to be treated like that.

416
00:35:30,831 --> 00:35:34,472
Yes!
Let's go home and do some writing.

417
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:40,443
"He had made the girl happy.
And what a girl."

418
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,325
"You've saved my life, she said."

419
00:35:45,828 --> 00:35:49,035
"You'd better make it up to me."

420
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:58,186
Done! Done!
Yes, I hate the doggie.

421
00:35:59,355 --> 00:36:02,653
62 books. Done.

422
00:36:03,105 --> 00:36:05,756
We have to cut back expenses
every place we can.

423
00:36:05,757 --> 00:36:08,428
- He has no medical insurance?
- No.

424
00:36:09,082 --> 00:36:13,735
Let me see these are the food receipts.
Here are the household expenses.

425
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:16,055
Here's one for the dog again.

426
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:18,388
- I can read it. I got it.
- I can't see it. Here you go.

427
00:36:18,422 --> 00:36:21,490
- All the laundry and the cleaners.
- Okay, good.

428
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:30,334
Boy, look at that? He likes it.
He likes it at Chez Melvin.

429
00:36:31,452 --> 00:36:34,338
What are you coming over here for?
I told you to sit here.

430
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:38,841
I can't cook with a dog near me.
Okay, just sit. Good.

431
00:36:38,842 --> 00:36:42,099
We don't want any company.
I'll read you a little Ralph Waldo Emerson.

432
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:43,885
Okay, have it your way.

433
00:36:54,464 --> 00:37:00,309
- How's Verdell doing?
- He's a pain in the ass.

434
00:37:04,192 --> 00:37:05,957
Simon's home.

435
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:11,039
I was sort of hoping you can keep the dog
until he's had a chance to think and adjust.

436
00:37:11,074 --> 00:37:15,289
Well, it's been weeks and weeks.
A few more won't matter.

437
00:37:15,355 --> 00:37:20,525
No. He definitely wants him back
right away. He'll be by tomorrow.

438
00:37:23,062 --> 00:37:24,770
Okay.

439
00:37:24,972 --> 00:37:26,671
Okay by me.

440
00:37:32,414 --> 00:37:35,670
Hungry?
Be right with you, pooch.

441
00:37:40,044 --> 00:37:44,879
One, two, three, four, five.

442
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,926
I'm okay.

443
00:38:39,213 --> 00:38:40,875
Mr. Udall.

444
00:38:46,644 --> 00:38:51,070
Some face they left hanging on you.
You look like...

445
00:38:51,236 --> 00:38:54,335
Could you take it...

446
00:38:55,995 --> 00:38:59,211
...just a little easy, Mr. Udall?

447
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:04,117
Thank you.

448
00:39:07,038 --> 00:39:09,060
Verdell.

449
00:39:10,671 --> 00:39:14,845
Come here, my beautiful boy.
Come here. Come here, boy.

450
00:39:15,012 --> 00:39:18,036
Let's go home and get well.

451
00:39:19,563 --> 00:39:24,573
You can't blame him for being weird.
Have a look at yourself in the mirror.

452
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,094
Thank you.

453
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:37,174
Come on, sweetheart.

454
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:41,022
Verdell, come here.
Come here, boy.

455
00:39:43,152 --> 00:39:45,758
I know what you want.

456
00:39:49,832 --> 00:39:52,278
Come on.
Where's my boy?

457
00:39:57,848 --> 00:40:00,905
No, don't force him.

458
00:40:32,976 --> 00:40:35,700
Over a dog!

459
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:41,660
Over an ugly dog.

460
00:40:48,898 --> 00:40:53,276
Worst sidewalk in New York.
Look where they put it.

461
00:40:53,377 --> 00:40:56,996
FIFTH AVENUE
PSYCHIATRIC GROUP

462
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:01,945
Hi.
Help!

463
00:41:02,146 --> 00:41:05,753
If you want to see me, you will not
do this. You will make an appointment.

464
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:09,614
Dr. Green, how can you diagnose someone
as an obsessive-compulsive disorder

465
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:12,587
and then act as though I had some
choice about barging in.

466
00:41:12,654 --> 00:41:15,300
There's not going to be a debate.
You must leave.

467
00:41:15,335 --> 00:41:18,885
You said you could help me!
What was that? A tease?

468
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,003
I can help you if you take responsibility
to keep regular appointment.

469
00:41:23,038 --> 00:41:26,012
- You changed the room around.
- Two years ago.

470
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:30,364
I also regrew my beard, but you're
not interested in changes in me.

471
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:34,538
I don't have this mountain of available time.
I have to get to my restaurant on time.

472
00:41:34,547 --> 00:41:37,688
Do you know how hard it was
for me to come here?

473
00:41:37,689 --> 00:41:39,022
Yes.

474
00:41:40,425 --> 00:41:42,805
No, we're not doing this now.

475
00:41:42,972 --> 00:41:47,310
I changed just one pattern,
as you always said I should.

476
00:41:48,275 --> 00:41:50,696
No. Nope.

477
00:41:59,964 --> 00:42:03,454
What if this is as good as it gets?

478
00:42:16,538 --> 00:42:19,453
What the heck are those for?

479
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:24,804
No, no, no. Get Carol.

480
00:42:24,971 --> 00:42:28,089
I'm filling in.
We don't know if she's coming back.

481
00:42:28,123 --> 00:42:31,197
You know, I think she might be
getting a job closer to home.

482
00:42:33,112 --> 00:42:37,196
- Why plastic?
- What are you trying to do to me?

483
00:42:37,663 --> 00:42:41,454
- What the heck do you mean?
- Look, elephant girl.

484
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:47,557
Just go get Carol or something.
Just have her do my one meal here.

485
00:42:47,725 --> 00:42:50,814
You know, I'll pay whatever you want.
I'll wait.

486
00:42:53,152 --> 00:42:55,089
Do it!

487
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:01,544
- Bryan. Code blue.
- No.

488
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,871
Out! Just shut up and get out.
Do it!

489
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:18,202
I'll be quiet.
Just let me stay here. No problem.

490
00:43:18,368 --> 00:43:22,668
Go get Carol.
Get her here.

491
00:43:23,212 --> 00:43:28,430
I'm not a prick. You are.
I'm not judging. I'm a great customer.

492
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,831
This day has been a disaster.

493
00:43:34,484 --> 00:43:38,684
- I'm not sure if I can handle this too.
- Get out!

494
00:43:39,327 --> 00:43:45,598
Get out immediately, or there's gonna
be trouble. Man, I mean it.

495
00:43:53,779 --> 00:43:55,403
Okay.

496
00:44:00,836 --> 00:44:03,124
See you. Bye.

497
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:06,588
It's about time.

498
00:44:07,926 --> 00:44:10,183
Carol's last name?

499
00:44:10,585 --> 00:44:13,715
- Connelly.
- Thank you.

500
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,205
- Does he visit often?
- Not really. Not any more.

501
00:44:24,206 --> 00:44:25,858
What can you do?

502
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,400
Hello.

503
00:45:15,704 --> 00:45:17,744
I'm hungry.

504
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,968
You've ruined my whole day.
I haven't eaten.

505
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:25,299
- What are you doing here?
- This is not a sexist thing.

506
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,788
If you were a waiter, I'd...

507
00:45:26,822 --> 00:45:29,858
Are you totally gone?
This is my private home.

508
00:45:31,988 --> 00:45:37,665
I'm trying to keep emotion out of this
even though it's an important issue to me.

509
00:45:37,832 --> 00:45:41,199
And I have very strong feelings
on the subject.

510
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,842
What subject?

511
00:45:42,877 --> 00:45:45,901
That I wasn't there to take crap
from you and bring you eggs?

512
00:45:45,902 --> 00:45:49,663
Do you have any control over how
creepy you allow yourself to get?

513
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:58,258
Yes, I do.
As a matter of fact.

514
00:45:59,374 --> 00:46:05,003
And to prove it, I have not gotten
personal, and you have.

515
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:09,830
Why aren't you at work?
Are you sick?

516
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,879
You don't look sick.

517
00:46:16,367 --> 00:46:19,331
Just tired and bitter.

518
00:46:22,044 --> 00:46:24,619
My son is sick, okay?

519
00:46:27,806 --> 00:46:30,645
What about your mother?

520
00:46:31,187 --> 00:46:36,539
- How do you know about my mother?
- I hear you talking while I wait.

521
00:46:36,707 --> 00:46:40,130
- Mom, I finished my juice.
- I'm sorry, honey. One sec.

522
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,604
Mom!

523
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,354
How are you doing?

524
00:46:58,073 --> 00:47:00,512
You should answer someone
when they speak to you.

525
00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:05,380
I'm sorry, Melvin. That's it. I cannot
handle you teaching my son manners!

526
00:47:08,303 --> 00:47:10,307
Back to life.

527
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,778
What's wrong?

528
00:47:21,244 --> 00:47:27,548
Five one-thousand, four one-thousand,
three one-thousand, two one-thousand, bingo.

529
00:47:30,103 --> 00:47:31,506
104.9.

530
00:47:31,507 --> 00:47:33,975
We're gonna treat ourselves
to a cab ride.

531
00:47:36,441 --> 00:47:39,740
Look out, you guys.
Coming through. Look out.

532
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:45,208
Look out, you guys.
We're okay. We're okay.

533
00:47:46,962 --> 00:47:49,508
Melvin! Wait!

534
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:53,516
Melvin! Wait!

535
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:01,751
Shut up, kids!

536
00:48:02,723 --> 00:48:05,854
- Give us a lift, would you, Melvin?
- Yeah. Okay.

537
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:13,027
Cover your mouth when you cough, kid.

538
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,972
Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital, please.
And quickly, please!

539
00:48:18,673 --> 00:48:20,723
- Hospital?
- Yes.

540
00:48:21,134 --> 00:48:26,436
- Any chance you'll be back at work today?
- No! Stay away from me! God!

541
00:48:30,987 --> 00:48:34,069
Simon, we can't put this off any longer.

542
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:38,211
I feel terrible that I have to...
Simon.

543
00:48:38,246 --> 00:48:41,591
Simon, could you just leave
the dog for a second?

544
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,525
Sorry.

545
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:52,063
- What are those cards?
- Frank's idea.

546
00:48:52,064 --> 00:48:54,859
He thought I should have notes
so I did this right.

547
00:48:55,118 --> 00:48:59,841
Maintained focus, didn't get emotional
and tried not to terrify you.

548
00:49:00,294 --> 00:49:05,197
See? He's right.
I need the cards.

549
00:49:05,605 --> 00:49:07,476
SIMON, YOU'RE BROKE

550
00:49:09,756 --> 00:49:12,410
Simon, you're broke.

551
00:49:14,073 --> 00:49:18,847
The medical bills are 61,000 now.
And the show didn't go well.

552
00:49:18,848 --> 00:49:21,693
CONVINCE HIM TO ASK PARENTS FOR HELP.
I've spoken to your parents.

553
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:24,342
They didn't hang up or anything.

554
00:49:24,551 --> 00:49:28,434
But, they said they would feel
strange about calling you.

555
00:49:29,602 --> 00:49:33,557
I can't call them.
Come here, baby.

556
00:49:34,488 --> 00:49:36,450
Come here, baby.

557
00:49:36,617 --> 00:49:40,540
Verdell? What's wrong?

558
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:45,218
You miss the tough guy?
Well, here I am, sweetheart.

559
00:49:45,225 --> 00:49:47,738
Happy to see me, you little
pissant mop?

560
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:50,197
How about another ride down the chute?

561
00:49:50,603 --> 00:49:53,316
God. I'm sorry. I did not mean that.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

562
00:49:53,383 --> 00:49:56,239
- Simon.
- I didn't mean that, sweetheart.

563
00:49:56,405 --> 00:49:58,076
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

564
00:49:59,578 --> 00:50:04,522
I'll be able to keep my apartment
and the studio, won't I?

565
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:11,602
Oh, my God!

566
00:50:41,195 --> 00:50:44,899
Yes, you write more than everybody else.
Yes, you make us a lot of money.

567
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,223
- But I think it's more appropriate...
- Look, look.

568
00:50:47,258 --> 00:50:52,540
I need this.
Just say, "Melvin, I'll try." Okay?

569
00:50:55,731 --> 00:50:59,656
- Melvin, I'll try.
- Thank you.

570
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:04,859
Now, on a pleasanter note, my son,
he just got accepted to Brown.

571
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,233
My husband was dying.

572
00:51:07,267 --> 00:51:10,753
Yeah. Good, nice, thrilled, exciting.

573
00:51:10,754 --> 00:51:13,192
You don't have to wait with me.

574
00:51:20,029 --> 00:51:22,151
I can't resist.

575
00:51:22,152 --> 00:51:24,581
You usually move through
here so quickly,

576
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:27,611
and I just have so many questions
I wanna ask you.

577
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:31,770
You have no idea what your work
means to me.

578
00:51:32,137 --> 00:51:34,766
What does it mean to you?

579
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:39,651
That somebody out there knows
what it's like to be in here.

580
00:51:40,904 --> 00:51:43,667
God, this is like a nightmare.

581
00:51:44,035 --> 00:51:48,427
Come on. Just a couple of questions.
How hard is that?

582
00:51:51,266 --> 00:51:53,999
How do you write women so well?

583
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,764
I think of a man.

584
00:51:56,017 --> 00:52:00,067
And I take away reason
and accountability.

585
00:52:31,846 --> 00:52:34,227
- Mom!
- In here, Mrs. Connelly.

586
00:52:34,293 --> 00:52:35,443
- What?
- Hi.

587
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,834
- What? Please, just tell me.
- I'm Martin...

588
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:40,646
- Please, just tell me!
- I'm Martin Bettes. Dr. Bettes.

589
00:52:40,714 --> 00:52:44,163
Not your name! What are you telling
me your name for? Where is he?

590
00:52:44,164 --> 00:52:45,794
He's in the bathroom.

591
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:48,117
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

592
00:52:48,118 --> 00:52:50,131
Do you know there are doctors
come to your house?

593
00:52:50,158 --> 00:52:51,609
- No, I didn't.
- I'm home.

594
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,436
- So what are you doing here?
- Well...

595
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:56,521
I didn't know that you had
a secret admirer.

596
00:52:56,522 --> 00:52:58,657
- What?
- You met the gift.

597
00:52:59,392 --> 00:53:02,690
He's good.
I'm an expert on doctors.

598
00:53:02,858 --> 00:53:04,566
Okay, doctor.

599
00:53:06,031 --> 00:53:09,425
My wife is
Melvin Udall's publisher.

600
00:53:09,613 --> 00:53:12,675
She said I was to take excellent
care of this little guy

601
00:53:12,676 --> 00:53:15,808
because you are urgently needed
back at work. That's what she told me.

602
00:53:15,843 --> 00:53:19,808
- What kind of work do you do?
- I'm a waitress.

603
00:53:20,016 --> 00:53:23,983
- In Manhattan.
- Dr. Bettes?

604
00:53:24,192 --> 00:53:26,654
Yeah. Terry. Excuse me.

605
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:30,887
I'm sorry it took so long.
I don't know Brooklyn.

606
00:53:30,888 --> 00:53:33,942
I couldn't find it either.
Could you get this to the lab?

607
00:53:33,978 --> 00:53:37,032
Tell them I need C.B.C. Differential,
platelets, the whole thing.

608
00:53:37,033 --> 00:53:39,081
- And I want it back today.
- Okay.

609
00:53:39,263 --> 00:53:42,296
I'm sorry. Did you say you're
gonna get the results back today?

610
00:53:42,297 --> 00:53:44,787
Sure.
Let's sit down.

611
00:53:46,002 --> 00:53:48,110
These are the receipts,

612
00:53:48,111 --> 00:53:52,094
from all the prescriptions
from the beginning of the year.

613
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:56,431
- Don't forget the calendar.
- Yeah. And this is a calendar of days...

614
00:53:57,924 --> 00:54:01,057
And how he felt and what he's been eating.
That's good, that's very good.

615
00:54:01,264 --> 00:54:05,637
- How long has he had the problem?
- Since forever. Six months old.

616
00:54:05,665 --> 00:54:08,737
- Have they done blood tests on him?
- Yeah.

617
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:11,116
Only in the emergency room,
or when he was well?

618
00:54:11,117 --> 00:54:12,978
- Emergency room only.
- Okay.

619
00:54:13,013 --> 00:54:16,133
- How about skin testing for allergies?
- No.

620
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:18,863
No standard scratch test?
They poke them with a needle.

621
00:54:18,864 --> 00:54:20,091
No, I asked.

622
00:54:20,127 --> 00:54:23,717
They said my plan didn't cover it and
that it wasn't necessary anyways.

623
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:26,262
- Why? Should I have?
- Well.

624
00:54:26,606 --> 00:54:29,780
Fucking HMO bastard pieces of shit!

625
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:32,782
I'm sorry.

626
00:54:32,783 --> 00:54:36,100
It's okay. Actually, I think
that's their technical name.

627
00:54:37,628 --> 00:54:40,206
So, once the tests come back,

628
00:54:40,207 --> 00:54:43,673
is there someone in your office
we should talk to to get the results, or

629
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:47,857
Me.
My home number is on the card.

630
00:54:49,025 --> 00:54:51,790
That's his home number.

631
00:54:57,082 --> 00:55:00,393
- What?
- It's your home...

632
00:55:04,014 --> 00:55:08,614
Can we get you anything else?
Do you want some water or some coffee?

633
00:55:08,615 --> 00:55:10,292
No, thank you.

634
00:55:10,326 --> 00:55:13,341
A couple of female slaves?

635
00:55:13,908 --> 00:55:16,753
Mrs. Connelly, there's still a lot of
tests I need to do...

636
00:55:16,754 --> 00:55:19,017
A lot of things I have to find out here.

637
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:22,634
But look, whatever I find out,
I promise you at the very least

638
00:55:22,801 --> 00:55:27,769
from now on your son is gonna
feel a great deal better, okay?

639
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:37,430
Doc!

640
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,889
Fine. Okay, okay.
That's good.

641
00:55:51,934 --> 00:55:54,933
So, you gotta let me know about the
additional costs.

642
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,317
One way or another we'll...

643
00:55:56,333 --> 00:56:00,501
The costs are gonna be
considerable, I'm afraid.

644
00:56:00,668 --> 00:56:04,784
But don't worry.
But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

645
00:56:08,308 --> 00:56:10,679
That's wonderful.

646
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,845
Anyway, dear.
Thank you for everything, Nora.

647
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,852
Forgive my recent crankiness.

648
00:56:19,853 --> 00:56:22,658
I'll call when things get back
on track, okay?

649
00:56:29,577 --> 00:56:31,181
Hijole.

650
00:56:31,216 --> 00:56:34,848
- What's wrong?
- Who's going to walk Verdell?

651
00:56:34,949 --> 00:56:36,638
Oh, no.

652
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:40,254
No!

653
00:56:55,191 --> 00:56:58,623
- Is he dead yet?
- No.

654
00:57:00,201 --> 00:57:06,338
Would there be any way that you would
be willing to walk his dog for him?

655
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:11,558
- Absolutely.
- You're a wonderful man.

656
00:57:14,647 --> 00:57:20,409
Two o'clock would be a good time.
Here is the key in case he's asleep.

657
00:57:21,661 --> 00:57:26,963
Open his curtains for him
so he can see God's beautiful work.

658
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:32,056
And he'll know that even things
like this happen for the best.

659
00:57:32,065 --> 00:57:34,196
Where did they teach you to talk like this?

660
00:57:34,197 --> 00:57:37,217
In some Panama city sailor
"wanna hump-hump" bar?

661
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:40,422
Or is this getaway day
and your last shot at his whiskey?

662
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:44,873
Sell crazy someplace else.
We're all stocked up here.

663
00:57:52,973 --> 00:57:54,635
No! No, no!

664
00:57:54,636 --> 00:57:57,336
There is a seriously goofy man
behind this!

665
00:57:57,337 --> 00:57:59,427
You're not allowed to block out that man!

666
00:57:59,462 --> 00:58:01,856
Do you really want to go back to emergency

667
00:58:01,857 --> 00:58:05,010
where those runt doctors
keep telling us that they can't help?

668
00:58:05,045 --> 00:58:07,344
This lets a crazy man into our lives.

669
00:58:07,345 --> 00:58:10,705
Let's not fight. You know how
this will turn out. Come on!

670
00:58:12,511 --> 00:58:15,709
You know how this will turn out.

671
00:58:15,818 --> 00:58:18,959
This is not like stockings.
It's not like a string of pearls.

672
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,601
You don't send this one back.

673
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,559
Right?

674
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:38,229
No. I do, I understand.
Listen. I have to go, okay?

675
00:58:39,047 --> 00:58:40,839
FRIENDS TO ASK FOR MONEY

676
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,960
No. Okay.

677
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:45,669
Bye-bye.

678
00:58:46,495 --> 00:58:48,458
Bye-bye.

679
00:58:52,382 --> 00:58:54,436
What a day.
Come here, come here.

680
00:58:54,812 --> 00:58:57,801
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

681
00:58:57,969 --> 00:59:00,623
Thank you for walking him.

682
00:59:02,944 --> 00:59:08,414
- Excuse me, I'm not feeling so well.
- This place smells like shit.

683
00:59:08,581 --> 00:59:10,550
Go away.

684
00:59:11,044 --> 00:59:15,787
- This cleaning lady doesn't...
- Please, just leave!

685
00:59:17,874 --> 00:59:20,301
What happened to your queer
party friends?

686
00:59:20,302 --> 00:59:22,033
Get out of here!

687
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:31,667
There's nothing worse than having
to feel this way in front of you.

688
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:35,815
Nellie.
Your a disgrace to depression.

689
00:59:39,141 --> 00:59:43,624
- Rot in hell, Melvin.
- No need to stop being a lady.

690
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:45,095
Quit worrying.

691
00:59:45,195 --> 00:59:48,367
You'll be back on your knees in no time.

692
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,949
Is this fun for you?

693
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:04,501
You lucky devil, it just keeps getting
better and better, doesn't it?

694
01:00:04,502 --> 01:00:06,967
I'm losing my apartment, Melvin.

695
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:12,465
Frank wants me to beg my parents,
who haven't called me, for help.

696
01:00:12,874 --> 01:00:14,753
And I won't.

697
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,217
And I don't want to paint anymore.

698
01:00:18,393 --> 01:00:21,892
So the life that I was trying for is over.

699
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,098
The life that I had is gone,

700
01:00:24,099 --> 01:00:27,839
and I'm feeling so damn sorry for
myself that it's difficult to breathe.

701
01:00:28,447 --> 01:00:31,044
It's high times for you, isn't it, Melvin?

702
01:00:31,045 --> 01:00:33,966
The gay neighbor is terrified.

703
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:36,563
Terrified!

704
01:00:48,654 --> 01:00:52,261
I was just trying to give you a boost.

705
01:00:52,827 --> 01:00:57,014
Lucky you.
You're here for Rock Bottom.

706
01:00:57,755 --> 01:01:02,205
You absolute horror
of a human being.

707
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:19,440
The one thing I'll do for you,
I might cheer you up.

708
01:01:20,048 --> 01:01:21,911
Get out.

709
01:01:22,646 --> 01:01:26,812
You wanna know why that dog
prefers me? It's not affection.

710
01:01:26,979 --> 01:01:29,050
It's a trick.

711
01:01:31,655 --> 01:01:34,476
I keep bacon in my pocket.

712
01:01:35,496 --> 01:01:37,408
See?

713
01:01:38,351 --> 01:01:40,301
My Gosh.

714
01:01:43,428 --> 01:01:47,997
We'll both call him. You'll see.
It's a trick.

715
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:51,395
Okay?

716
01:01:57,706 --> 01:02:00,688
Come here, Verdell.
Come here.

717
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:08,035
Come on.

718
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:11,845
- Come here. Come here, baby.
- No.

719
01:02:11,846 --> 01:02:14,846
It's okay. Come here.

720
01:02:17,077 --> 01:02:20,099
Just a stupid dog.

721
01:02:23,215 --> 01:02:27,518
Could you leave now?
Please?

722
01:02:29,193 --> 01:02:31,190
I don't get it.

723
01:02:31,592 --> 01:02:33,550
I don't get it.

724
01:04:09,678 --> 01:04:11,419
Mr. Udall!

725
01:04:13,032 --> 01:04:16,224
- Carol the waitress?
- Yes.

726
01:04:25,735 --> 01:04:30,168
The doctors gave me your building address.
I'm sorry about the hour.

727
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:38,309
If you are...

728
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:48,254
- if you're worried about thanking me...
- That's not why I'm here.

729
01:04:48,463 --> 01:04:51,548
Though you have no idea
what it's like to...

730
01:04:51,549 --> 01:04:54,836
Have a real conversation
with a doctor about Spencer.

731
01:04:56,712 --> 01:05:00,546
Note. Put it in a note.

732
01:05:09,445 --> 01:05:14,873
- I have a hairdryer.
- Why did you do this for me?

733
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:22,276
So you'd come back to work
and wait on me.

734
01:05:22,277 --> 01:05:25,470
Do you have some idea
how strange that sounds?

735
01:05:27,607 --> 01:05:30,898
I'm worried you did this be...

736
01:05:46,352 --> 01:05:50,378
Are you waiting for me
to say something?

737
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:55,746
Look...

738
01:05:57,517 --> 01:06:00,372
I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.

739
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:04,622
I don't think this can wait until tomorrow.
I need to clear this up now.

740
01:06:04,688 --> 01:06:06,986
Clear what up?

741
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:11,471
I'm not going to sleep with you.

742
01:06:11,472 --> 01:06:15,075
I will never sleep with you.
Never, ever.

743
01:06:15,869 --> 01:06:17,873
Not ever!

744
01:06:24,284 --> 01:06:26,723
I'm sorry, but...

745
01:06:28,602 --> 01:06:33,346
...we don't open
for the no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.

746
01:06:34,732 --> 01:06:39,114
- I'm not kidding.
- Anything else?

747
01:06:42,755 --> 01:06:47,736
Just... thank you.

748
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:55,840
So you will be at work tomorrow?

749
01:06:58,787 --> 01:07:00,850
Yes.

750
01:07:16,029 --> 01:07:19,164
"Never", she said.
"Never", she said.

751
01:07:37,339 --> 01:07:41,053
I took a chance you were up.

752
01:07:41,597 --> 01:07:44,937
I brought you some Chinese soup.

753
01:07:47,149 --> 01:07:49,120
Thanks.

754
01:08:05,769 --> 01:08:09,126
I've never been this tired
in my life.

755
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:19,138
I haven't been sleeping.

756
01:08:21,134 --> 01:08:25,776
I haven't been clear in my head
or felt like myself.

757
01:08:29,316 --> 01:08:31,746
I'm in trouble.

758
01:08:32,406 --> 01:08:35,202
It's not just the tiredness.

759
01:08:35,704 --> 01:08:38,408
- Boy.
- Sick.

760
01:08:38,509 --> 01:08:41,108
- Nauseous.
- Sleepy.

761
01:08:41,243 --> 01:08:46,996
Where everything looks distorted,
and everything inside just kind of aches.

762
01:08:47,102 --> 01:08:51,000
And you can barely find the will
to complain.

763
01:08:52,271 --> 01:08:55,089
Yeah. Yeah.

764
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:58,108
I'm glad we did this.

765
01:08:59,793 --> 01:09:02,566
Good talking to you.

766
01:09:10,590 --> 01:09:13,633
You are not still writing that
Thank-you note?

767
01:09:13,634 --> 01:09:16,841
I'm on the last page.
How do you spell "conscience"?

768
01:09:17,202 --> 01:09:20,543
C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

769
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:25,970
Look, I got Sean from the bakery to
baby-sit so we could go out.

770
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:29,078
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer
with someone.

771
01:09:29,079 --> 01:09:31,983
- Could you spell that again, please?
- Spencer's okay.

772
01:09:32,017 --> 01:09:35,622
You better start finding something else
to do with your free time.

773
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:39,329
- Sean, are you hungry?
- Yeah.

774
01:09:39,331 --> 01:09:41,057
All right.

775
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:44,174
We got pizza.
Carol and I are going out.

776
01:09:44,175 --> 01:09:47,552
Sausage, pepperoni. You wanna
make this later for you and Spencer?

777
01:09:48,931 --> 01:09:52,522
We are going out, like people do.

778
01:09:54,484 --> 01:10:00,872
If you can't feel good about
this break and step out a little,

779
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:06,927
then I think you ought to have Mr. Udall
send you over a psychiatrist.

780
01:10:06,963 --> 01:10:10,252
I don't need one, because
I know what's really going on here.

781
01:10:12,436 --> 01:10:15,358
I gotta finish this letter, or I'll go nuts.

782
01:10:15,463 --> 01:10:18,363
This can't be right.
"Con-science"?

783
01:10:19,117 --> 01:10:21,013
Carol!

784
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:27,517
What?

785
01:10:43,664 --> 01:10:46,795
It's very weird not feeling that...

786
01:10:47,465 --> 01:10:51,805
...stupid panic thing inside me
all the time.

787
01:10:52,515 --> 01:10:56,315
Without that, I just start
thinking about myself and...

788
01:10:56,523 --> 01:10:59,946
What good
does that ever get anybody?

789
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:06,210
Today on the bus
there was this adorable couple.

790
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:09,174
And I felt myself...

791
01:11:10,509 --> 01:11:13,540
...giving them a dirty look.

792
01:11:14,601 --> 01:11:20,196
I just had no idea everything was...

793
01:11:27,627 --> 01:11:29,998
Go ahead.

794
01:11:31,468 --> 01:11:34,891
Moving in the wrong direction.

795
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,794
Away from a time...

796
01:11:37,795 --> 01:11:42,463
When I remembered what it was like
to have a man to do anything.

797
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:44,777
Hold fucking.

798
01:11:45,877 --> 01:11:48,924
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

799
01:11:48,959 --> 01:11:52,432
Hands with, for christ sake!

800
01:11:54,387 --> 01:12:00,609
I felt almost really bad
that Dr. Bettes is married.

801
01:12:04,157 --> 01:12:09,292
Which is probably why I make poor Spencer
hug me more than he wants to.

802
01:12:10,829 --> 01:12:13,312
The poor kid doesn't have
enough problems.

803
01:12:13,313 --> 01:12:16,582
He has to make up for his mom
not getting any.

804
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:25,482
- Who needs these thoughts?
- So, what are you saying?

805
01:12:25,484 --> 01:12:27,699
- That you're frustrated?
- Leave me be!

806
01:12:27,735 --> 01:12:31,644
Why are you doing this?
What is it you want?

807
01:12:31,671 --> 01:12:34,569
I hope getting me thinking about
everything that's wrong,

808
01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:38,545
when all I want to do is not do that,
has some purpose.

809
01:12:39,394 --> 01:12:43,150
Really, Mom, what is it you want?

810
01:12:43,527 --> 01:12:47,331
- What?
- I want us to go out.

811
01:12:54,838 --> 01:12:56,678
Okay.

812
01:13:17,344 --> 01:13:21,410
- Thank you.
- Now I gotta send you a thank-you note.

813
01:13:22,874 --> 01:13:26,950
Look, Evelyn's here, and her giant Joey.

814
01:13:28,691 --> 01:13:31,768
That's why you brought me here?
That's really why you brought me here?

815
01:13:31,872 --> 01:13:34,525
Well, it's not even mine.

816
01:13:34,526 --> 01:13:37,928
This guy Simon seems to have
enough on his mind.

817
01:13:37,963 --> 01:13:42,245
But the dog did throw up twice last night
and his bark is off.

818
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,824
- Well, take him to the vet.
- I did.

819
01:13:44,825 --> 01:13:47,666
They say his stomach's out of whack.

820
01:13:47,702 --> 01:13:51,003
- They need him for a couple of days.
- Well, do it! What...

821
01:13:51,869 --> 01:13:53,915
Sorry.

822
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:59,093
- Excuse me. This is for later.
- What's this?

823
01:14:00,177 --> 01:14:04,019
- It's a note.
- A note?

824
01:14:04,228 --> 01:14:08,036
- Yeah, it's a thank-you note.
- Thank-you note? No, no, no.

825
01:14:08,101 --> 01:14:10,735
- You can read it later.
- No, no, thank you.

826
01:14:10,736 --> 01:14:13,703
No, thank-you note. No, no.

827
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:18,715
Thank you. Thank you.

828
01:14:24,167 --> 01:14:26,265
She's nice.

829
01:14:26,867 --> 01:14:28,454
Evet.

830
01:14:28,455 --> 01:14:31,267
- Really nice, huh?
- Really nice.

831
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:38,253
Shouldn't that be a good thing,
telling somebody, "no thanks required"?

832
01:14:40,048 --> 01:14:43,130
Sure looks like it went over, too.

833
01:14:45,058 --> 01:14:47,755
Look at you.

834
01:14:48,816 --> 01:14:54,118
You're sure making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup last night.

835
01:14:58,419 --> 01:15:01,967
- What?
- Look at you. You think I'm a mark.

836
01:15:01,975 --> 01:15:04,990
You helped with the dog.
Now, there's other things.

837
01:15:04,991 --> 01:15:07,788
Hey, I'm as concerned about
Simon as you are.

838
01:15:07,823 --> 01:15:10,463
- Concerned?
- It's not just financial assistance.

839
01:15:10,525 --> 01:15:14,426
He's gotta get to Baltimore to ask
his parents for money tomorrow.

840
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:16,124
Well, yeah.

841
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:19,631
I mean, if his parents are alive,
they have to help. It's the rules.

842
01:15:19,665 --> 01:15:21,492
- Good! That's great.
- Absolutely.

843
01:15:21,493 --> 01:15:23,301
Let them help him.

844
01:15:25,013 --> 01:15:27,099
Only...

845
01:15:27,267 --> 01:15:32,639
...I got a high-maintenance selling painter
coming through, so I'm out.

846
01:15:33,236 --> 01:15:39,277
- Can you drive him?
- Think white and get serious!

847
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:43,307
Take my car? A convertible.

848
01:15:44,927 --> 01:15:49,412
- Do you drive?
- Like the wind. But I'm not doing it!

849
01:15:49,415 --> 01:15:51,899
Getting loud. Getting loud.

850
01:15:53,443 --> 01:15:56,550
He wants me to take his car
and his client to Baltimore.

851
01:15:56,551 --> 01:15:59,859
I want your life for one minute, where
my big problem is somebody offers me

852
01:15:59,895 --> 01:16:03,178
a free convertible
so I can get out of this city.

853
01:16:09,851 --> 01:16:14,109
- Go ahead, girl.
- Okay. I'll do it.

854
01:16:14,277 --> 01:16:16,219
I'll take him. I'll take him.

855
01:16:16,221 --> 01:16:19,896
Yeah, get him ready, packed.
Tomorrow morning I'll take him. Okay.

856
01:16:19,897 --> 01:16:22,657
I'll take him.
Fine. Okay.

857
01:16:24,471 --> 01:16:26,516
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

858
01:16:26,517 --> 01:16:30,711
Let's not drag this out.
We don't enjoy one another that much.

859
01:16:35,276 --> 01:16:39,321
If there is some mental health foundation
that raises money for people like you...

860
01:16:39,322 --> 01:16:41,257
Please be sure to let me know.

861
01:16:41,292 --> 01:16:43,958
- Last-word freak.
- Bye-bye.

862
01:16:43,959 --> 01:16:45,431
Good luck, lady.

863
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:50,389
- So anything else?
- Yeah.

864
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:57,027
I'm gonna give my queer neighbor
a lift to Baltimore.

865
01:16:57,566 --> 01:16:59,601
- Okay.
- Hey.

866
01:17:00,868 --> 01:17:05,079
What I did for you,
it's working out?

867
01:17:08,509 --> 01:17:12,225
What you did changed my life.

868
01:17:13,101 --> 01:17:14,812
No!

869
01:17:15,773 --> 01:17:18,403
No. No thank-you note.

870
01:17:18,412 --> 01:17:22,045
Well, part of what I said in this
entire history of my life,

871
01:17:22,046 --> 01:17:24,435
which you won't read,

872
01:17:24,891 --> 01:17:29,592
is that somehow you have done
more for my mother, my son

873
01:17:29,801 --> 01:17:33,433
and me than anybody else ever has.

874
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,148
I'm just going to read you
this part of it.

875
01:17:38,108 --> 01:17:42,529
"And that makes you the most important,
surprising, generous person"

876
01:17:42,566 --> 01:17:44,465
"I ever met in my life."

877
01:17:44,501 --> 01:17:48,996
"And that you're gonna be in our prayers,
our daily prayers, forever."

878
01:17:50,217 --> 01:17:52,003
Lovely.

879
01:17:53,264 --> 01:17:57,848
I also wrote one part...
I'm just gonna say, I wrote, "I'm sorry."

880
01:17:59,735 --> 01:18:04,118
I was talking about how I was sorry
when I got mad at you for

881
01:18:04,328 --> 01:18:08,402
when you came over, and you told my son
that he oughta answer back.

882
01:18:08,568 --> 01:18:10,900
So I wrote that I was sorry about that.

883
01:18:10,901 --> 01:18:15,956
I wrote I was sorry for busting you on that
and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night

884
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:19,400
...when I said I was never...

885
01:18:20,067 --> 01:18:23,594
I was sorry. And I'm sorry
for every time your food was cold,

886
01:18:23,595 --> 01:18:26,572
and that you had to wait
two seconds for a coffee filler.

887
01:18:26,607 --> 01:18:29,940
I'm sorry for never spotting right there
at the table in the restaurant,

888
01:18:30,044 --> 01:18:33,996
the human being that had it in him
to do this things for us.

889
01:18:34,972 --> 01:18:38,186
I'll just, you know what,
I'm just gonna start from the beginning.

890
01:18:38,194 --> 01:18:42,453
"I have not been able to express
my gratefulness to you."

891
01:18:42,488 --> 01:18:44,665
"Even as I look at the word 'grateful' now,"

892
01:18:44,666 --> 01:18:47,475
"it doesn't begin to tell you what I feel."

893
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:55,428
That's nice of you. Thank you.

894
01:18:58,351 --> 01:19:00,630
Thank you.

895
01:19:09,790 --> 01:19:13,205
Now I want you
to do something for me.

896
01:19:20,478 --> 01:19:25,446
I'm sorry. Didn't I say "what"?
I thought I said, "what"?

897
01:19:29,036 --> 01:19:33,514
- What?
- I want you to go on this trip.

898
01:19:33,545 --> 01:19:37,136
- No, sir.
- I can't do this without you.

899
01:19:37,244 --> 01:19:41,036
I'm afraid he might pull
the stiff one-eye on me.

900
01:19:41,037 --> 01:19:44,926
I need you to chaperone.
Separate everything but cars.

901
01:19:44,959 --> 01:19:48,187
You said you liked convertibles.
Now I'm on the hook.

902
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:51,560
- I'm sorry, "the stiff one-eye"?
- Two days.

903
01:19:51,594 --> 01:19:54,127
- I can't. I work.
- You get off when you want to.

904
01:19:54,128 --> 01:19:57,490
- My son.
- Bettes said he's doing fine.

905
01:19:58,177 --> 01:20:01,308
- Melvin, I'd rather not.
- What has that got to do with it?

906
01:20:01,309 --> 01:20:05,472
- Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
- Write a note. Ain't she sweet.

907
01:20:05,508 --> 01:20:08,050
I need a hand, and where'd she go?

908
01:20:08,051 --> 01:20:11,434
Are you saying accepting
your help obligates me?

909
01:20:12,414 --> 01:20:15,651
Is there any other way to see it?

910
01:20:18,259 --> 01:20:20,154
No.

911
01:20:25,273 --> 01:20:30,341
Here's a little suitcase.
Shocked that it's being used.

912
01:20:39,575 --> 01:20:42,574
There's no way to pack
for this trip.

913
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:08,688
- Alo?
- You're still coming, aren't you?

914
01:21:08,723 --> 01:21:09,902
Yes.

915
01:21:11,196 --> 01:21:14,266
Melvin, I would like to know
exactly where we are going.

916
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:18,534
Just south of Baltimore, Maryland.

917
01:21:18,535 --> 01:21:20,547
I know what you're gonna say next.

918
01:21:20,582 --> 01:21:23,345
I mean, I think I know.

919
01:21:24,181 --> 01:21:27,971
I'm not sure, but I think so.

920
01:21:28,572 --> 01:21:31,506
There's no need for me to bring
anything dressy?

921
01:21:33,157 --> 01:21:37,230
I didn't know if we were gonna be eating
in any restaurants that have dress codes?

922
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:44,094
Maybe...

923
01:21:44,429 --> 01:21:49,844
- Yes. Yes, let's! Let's.
- Okay, got you.

924
01:21:52,487 --> 01:21:56,925
- What did you think I was gonna ask?
- Whether crabs were in season there now.

925
01:21:57,460 --> 01:22:01,333
Okay, then. Goodnight.

926
01:22:06,138 --> 01:22:10,438
- Anything unusual in the dog's diet?
- No.

927
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:13,583
- Everybody gets their own cage?
- Certainly.

928
01:22:13,584 --> 01:22:17,090
Okay. Put him in with that one, not that one.
Builds his confidence, huh?

929
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:20,162
Lip kiss.

930
01:22:23,026 --> 01:22:28,537
I love you. I'll miss you.
Hey! Real sensitive.

931
01:22:29,498 --> 01:22:33,756
- Bye.
- Call me when you get settled.

932
01:22:41,438 --> 01:22:45,095
- Don't worry, mom. Have good time!
- No, don't, don't run.

933
01:22:45,137 --> 01:22:47,591
- Have fun! Don't worry!
- Don't run. No, no.

934
01:22:47,616 --> 01:22:50,957
- No, no. Have fun, but don't run.
- Grandma will take care of me! Bye!

935
01:22:55,089 --> 01:22:58,597
- Sorry I'm not taking you myself, Simon.
- So am I, Frank.

936
01:22:58,764 --> 01:23:01,160
Give me a hug.

937
01:23:02,605 --> 01:23:05,663
- Everything's gonna be okay, all right?
- Yeah.

938
01:23:05,697 --> 01:23:07,790
Soak it up.

939
01:23:07,891 --> 01:23:11,979
It's your last chance
for a hug for a few days.

940
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,845
Hello.

941
01:23:26,527 --> 01:23:29,592
Thank you for being on time.

942
01:23:33,672 --> 01:23:37,011
Carol the waitress. Simon the fag.

943
01:23:41,014 --> 01:23:44,167
Holy God. Who did that to you?

944
01:23:45,231 --> 01:23:47,998
I was attacked.

945
01:23:48,099 --> 01:23:51,354
I walked in on some men robbing me.

946
01:23:51,390 --> 01:23:54,290
And I was hospitalized.

947
01:23:55,417 --> 01:23:59,052
- I almost died.
- Let's do the small talk in the car.

948
01:23:59,353 --> 01:24:01,023
Let's go.

949
01:24:04,267 --> 01:24:07,803
- I was gonna do that for you.
- It's all right. Where should we sit?

950
01:24:07,839 --> 01:24:11,587
- There's no place cards or anything.
- That's all right.

951
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:13,878
You need all the room
you can manage.

952
01:24:13,912 --> 01:24:16,542
So I'll sit in the back.

953
01:24:30,444 --> 01:24:33,410
Never a break. Never.

954
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:37,525
I'm sorry. Thank you for the seat.
That was very thoughtful.

955
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:41,708
- You look like you're crowded in there.
- It's all right.

956
01:24:44,764 --> 01:24:46,134
Thanks.

957
01:24:54,826 --> 01:24:56,354
Thank you.

958
01:24:58,166 --> 01:25:00,170
You're welcome.

959
01:25:03,886 --> 01:25:07,285
I've got the whole trip programmed.

960
01:25:11,067 --> 01:25:15,587
I'm just kidding.
I wanted to see what you'd do.

961
01:25:16,569 --> 01:25:19,423
- No, seriously.
- "- TO USE AS ICEBREAKER"

962
01:25:19,543 --> 01:25:22,018
We've got good stuff here.

963
01:25:38,203 --> 01:25:40,375
I like this music.

964
01:25:42,838 --> 01:25:45,299
I like this music.

965
01:25:59,307 --> 01:26:03,431
Yes, I'm sure, Simon, they did something
really off for you to feel this way,

966
01:26:03,467 --> 01:26:07,092
but when it comes to your parents
or your kid,

967
01:26:07,093 --> 01:26:11,517
something will always be off for you
unless you set it straight.

968
01:26:11,551 --> 01:26:16,049
And maybe this thing happened to you
just to give you a chance to do that.

969
01:26:16,216 --> 01:26:19,270
Nonsense, and you want to know why?

970
01:26:19,306 --> 01:26:23,315
Anybody here who's interested in what
Melvin has to say raise their hand.

971
01:26:31,873 --> 01:26:34,580
Do you want to know what happened
with my parents?

972
01:26:34,782 --> 01:26:35,883
Yes.

973
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:39,390
- When I was a kid...
- Wait, wait.

974
01:26:39,391 --> 01:26:42,253
I'm gonna pull over,
give you my full attention.

975
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:51,036
I always painted,
and my mother always encouraged it.

976
01:26:51,202 --> 01:26:55,210
I mean, she was really sort of fabulous
about it actually.

977
01:26:55,586 --> 01:27:01,556
And she used to I was too young to think
there was anything wrong with it,

978
01:27:01,723 --> 01:27:04,762
and she was, she was very natural.

979
01:27:05,272 --> 01:27:08,578
So she used to pose nude for me.

980
01:27:08,945 --> 01:27:14,187
And I always thought or I guess
I assumed that my father knew about it.

981
01:27:14,222 --> 01:27:17,629
- This stuff is pointless.
- Hey! Let him finish, please.

982
01:27:17,664 --> 01:27:20,309
You like sad stories?
You wanna hear mine?

983
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:21,680
Stop!

984
01:27:23,767 --> 01:27:28,443
Go ahead, really.
Please don't let him stop you.

985
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:34,580
One day he walked in and he found us,
and he just, he started screaming.

986
01:27:34,747 --> 01:27:38,161
My father didn't come out of
his room for 11 years.

987
01:27:38,198 --> 01:27:40,676
He used to hit me on the hands
with a yardstick

988
01:27:40,677 --> 01:27:43,327
if I made a mistake playing the piano.

989
01:27:47,688 --> 01:27:52,498
Go ahead, Simon. So you said he came in
your room, and he was yelling?

990
01:27:53,242 --> 01:27:55,497
Please, come on.

991
01:27:56,831 --> 01:27:59,171
He was...

992
01:28:00,005 --> 01:28:05,065
Yeah, I know he was...
I remember I was defending my mother,

993
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:11,486
I was trying to make peace
in the lamest way.

994
01:28:11,652 --> 01:28:16,880
I said,
"She's not naked. It's art."

995
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:23,009
And he started hitting me.

996
01:28:23,175 --> 01:28:26,682
He beat me unconscious.

997
01:28:27,226 --> 01:28:30,773
And he talked to me less and less
after that.

998
01:28:30,874 --> 01:28:34,183
He knew what I was before I did.

999
01:28:34,197 --> 01:28:38,915
The morning I left for college
he walked into my room.

1000
01:28:39,123 --> 01:28:45,178
He held out his hand.
And it was filled with money.

1001
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:51,415
A big sweaty wad of money.

1002
01:28:52,692 --> 01:28:57,553
And he said, "I don't want you
to ever come back."

1003
01:28:58,119 --> 01:29:02,127
I just grabbed him
and I hugged him.

1004
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:06,095
And he turned and walked out.

1005
01:29:16,831 --> 01:29:20,243
We all have these terrible stories
to get over, and you...

1006
01:29:20,244 --> 01:29:22,138
It's not true.

1007
01:29:22,172 --> 01:29:25,077
Some of us have great stories,
pretty stories,

1008
01:29:25,113 --> 01:29:30,976
that take place at lakes with boats
and friends and noodle salad.

1009
01:29:31,143 --> 01:29:36,714
Just no one in this car.
But a lot of people that's their story.

1010
01:29:36,749 --> 01:29:39,441
Good times, noodle salad.

1011
01:29:39,442 --> 01:29:42,593
What makes it so hard is not that
you had it bad,

1012
01:29:42,628 --> 01:29:46,758
but that you're that pissed
that so many others had it good.

1013
01:29:46,924 --> 01:29:51,768
- No! I don't think so.
- Not it at all, really.

1014
01:29:52,602 --> 01:29:54,856
Not it at all?

1015
01:29:55,441 --> 01:30:00,701
Okay.
Let's go to the hotel.

1016
01:30:00,868 --> 01:30:06,588
Tomorrow you'll see if you can get another
big wad of sweaty money out of his hand.

1017
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:18,987
Can I ask you a personal question?

1018
01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:23,640
Sure.

1019
01:30:24,707 --> 01:30:28,182
You ever get an erection
over a woman?

1020
01:30:29,184 --> 01:30:30,600
Melvin.

1021
01:30:30,635 --> 01:30:34,048
I mean, wouldn't your life be
easier if you weren't...

1022
01:30:34,049 --> 01:30:36,712
You consider your life easy?

1023
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:41,357
All right.
I give you that one.

1024
01:30:44,872 --> 01:30:47,268
Nice packing.

1025
01:30:55,327 --> 01:30:57,313
- Hi.
- Hey, Spence.

1026
01:30:57,314 --> 01:31:01,743
- Hey, Mom. Wait till you hear.
- Why are you out of breath?

1027
01:31:01,777 --> 01:31:04,805
Mom, I ran over a guy and scored a goal.

1028
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:08,878
- You did?
- Yep. He was big. Charlie, you know!

1029
01:31:09,087 --> 01:31:12,163
- That's great!
- Yep, amazing.

1030
01:31:12,164 --> 01:31:14,488
- My God, right?
- Yeah.

1031
01:31:14,522 --> 01:31:18,447
- Mom, we're playing again. Gotta go.
- Wait, wait. Just tell me...

1032
01:31:20,776 --> 01:31:25,119
- He scored a goal.
- Mom, I don't believe it.

1033
01:31:25,327 --> 01:31:27,854
- You would've died.
- Yeah.

1034
01:31:29,167 --> 01:31:33,300
My son was outside playing soccer.

1035
01:31:33,468 --> 01:31:37,865
Come on, take me out for a good time.
Take me out dancing.

1036
01:31:37,866 --> 01:31:39,439
Dancing?

1037
01:31:40,314 --> 01:31:43,665
- I can't. I'm exhausted.
- Oh, come on.

1038
01:31:43,667 --> 01:31:45,845
- No. No.
- Please, come on. Come on.

1039
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:47,705
No.

1040
01:31:47,873 --> 01:31:51,421
- All right. You're right.
- Yeah.

1041
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:56,781
- Are you sad or something?
- No, no. I'm nervous.

1042
01:31:56,848 --> 01:32:00,931
It would be very rough, Carol,
if you weren't along.

1043
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:03,199
What a nice compliment.

1044
01:32:15,676 --> 01:32:20,478
I'm happy.
And you're my date.

1045
01:32:22,232 --> 01:32:24,845
Let's get dressed.

1046
01:32:32,510 --> 01:32:35,371
- I'm going to jump in the shower.
- Okay.

1047
01:32:35,372 --> 01:32:37,985
- I'll be right with you.
- Okay.

1048
01:33:15,587 --> 01:33:17,717
All set?

1049
01:33:17,918 --> 01:33:19,335
Yeah.

1050
01:33:22,368 --> 01:33:25,190
- Do you sell hard-shell crabs?
- Yes.

1051
01:33:25,356 --> 01:33:28,446
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

1052
01:33:36,294 --> 01:33:39,218
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

1053
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,278
Thank you.

1054
01:33:44,018 --> 01:33:45,981
- Good evening.
- Hi.

1055
01:33:46,048 --> 01:33:48,282
- You have hard-shells, right?
- Stop asking everyone.

1056
01:33:48,283 --> 01:33:51,794
Just him. That's all.
Okay, you can answer. We worked it out.

1057
01:33:51,928 --> 01:33:53,678
Yes, we do.

1058
01:33:53,997 --> 01:33:57,211
- I can give you a tie and jacket.
- What?

1059
01:33:57,378 --> 01:34:00,877
They require a tie and jacket,
but we have some available.

1060
01:34:12,265 --> 01:34:13,525
Sir.

1061
01:34:14,621 --> 01:34:18,665
No. I'm not putting that on.
In case you were gonna ask,

1062
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:21,700
I'm also not going to let you inject
me with the plague, either.

1063
01:34:21,736 --> 01:34:24,128
It's such a nice place.

1064
01:34:24,129 --> 01:34:27,322
You probably have these dry-cleaned
all the time, don't you?

1065
01:34:27,357 --> 01:34:29,406
Actually, I don't think so.

1066
01:34:38,727 --> 01:34:41,999
You just wait here.

1067
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:44,216
Excuse me. Thank you.

1068
01:34:55,326 --> 01:34:56,955
Good evening.

1069
01:34:58,959 --> 01:35:02,600
- I need a coat and tie.
- Come on in.

1070
01:35:02,601 --> 01:35:03,935
No.

1071
01:35:05,554 --> 01:35:08,640
- No?
- That one.

1072
01:35:09,687 --> 01:35:12,418
That one, yeah. And this tie.

1073
01:35:21,628 --> 01:35:23,298
Excuse me.

1074
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:31,681
She's here.
We saved a table for you.

1075
01:35:31,682 --> 01:35:32,996
Thanks.

1076
01:35:33,031 --> 01:35:38,748
- Should I get her for you?
- No, it's all right. I'll just watch.

1077
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:24,803
Madam?

1078
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:33,942
Wait!

1079
01:37:04,373 --> 01:37:06,794
You look so sex...

1080
01:37:09,299 --> 01:37:12,071
You look great.

1081
01:37:13,516 --> 01:37:15,645
You look great.

1082
01:37:26,207 --> 01:37:28,880
You want to dance?

1083
01:37:29,046 --> 01:37:32,628
I've been thinking about that
since you brought it up before.

1084
01:37:32,646 --> 01:37:34,978
- And?
- No.

1085
01:37:37,730 --> 01:37:40,110
I don't get this place.

1086
01:37:40,278 --> 01:37:44,855
They make me buy a new outfit
and let you in in a house-dress.

1087
01:37:44,856 --> 01:37:46,668
I don't get it.

1088
01:37:47,916 --> 01:37:53,261
What? Wait. No, wait. What?
Where you going? No, why?

1089
01:37:56,309 --> 01:38:00,191
I didn't mean it that way.
I mean, you gotta sit down.

1090
01:38:00,358 --> 01:38:03,746
You can still give me the dirty look,
just sit down and give it to me.

1091
01:38:03,747 --> 01:38:05,713
Pay me a compliment, Melvin.

1092
01:38:05,911 --> 01:38:08,751
I need one. Quick.

1093
01:38:08,958 --> 01:38:12,925
You have no idea how much
what you just said hurt my feelings.

1094
01:38:13,134 --> 01:38:17,935
The mono-minute someone gets that they
need you, they threaten to walk out.

1095
01:38:18,101 --> 01:38:22,694
A compliment is something nice
about somebody else.

1096
01:38:22,986 --> 01:38:25,943
- Now or never.
- Okay.

1097
01:38:35,887 --> 01:38:38,617
And mean it.

1098
01:38:49,371 --> 01:38:52,120
Can we order first?

1099
01:38:53,953 --> 01:38:55,548
Okay.

1100
01:38:58,347 --> 01:39:02,990
Two hard-shell crab dinners!
Pitcher ice-cold beer!

1101
01:39:03,658 --> 01:39:07,199
- Baked or fries?
- Fries.

1102
01:39:08,659 --> 01:39:12,209
- Fries.
- One baked, one fried.

1103
01:39:12,375 --> 01:39:15,553
I'll tell your waiter.

1104
01:39:17,301 --> 01:39:20,877
Okay. Now...

1105
01:39:20,913 --> 01:39:25,170
I got a real great compliment for you,
and it's true.

1106
01:39:25,443 --> 01:39:28,514
I'm so afraid you're about to say
something awful.

1107
01:39:28,515 --> 01:39:32,061
Don't be pessimistic.
It's not your style.

1108
01:39:32,165 --> 01:39:38,636
Okay. Here I go.
Clearly a mistake.

1109
01:39:40,181 --> 01:39:44,564
I've got this what... ailment.

1110
01:39:48,698 --> 01:39:52,455
My doctor, a shrink that
I used to go to all the time,

1111
01:39:52,663 --> 01:39:58,466
he says that in 50 or 60 percent
of the cases, a pill really helps.

1112
01:39:59,135 --> 01:40:02,538
I hate pills.
Very dangerous thing pills.

1113
01:40:02,558 --> 01:40:07,401
Hate. I'm using the word "hate"
here about pills. Hate.

1114
01:40:07,568 --> 01:40:13,163
My compliment is, that night when you came
over and told me that you would never...

1115
01:40:15,542 --> 01:40:19,650
All right, well, you were there.
You know what you said.

1116
01:40:19,884 --> 01:40:23,057
My compliment to you is,

1117
01:40:23,558 --> 01:40:28,400
the next morning
I started taking the pills.

1118
01:40:31,908 --> 01:40:35,499
I don't quite get how that's
a compliment for me.

1119
01:40:40,257 --> 01:40:44,292
You make me
want to be a better man.

1120
01:40:55,705 --> 01:40:59,779
That's maybe
the best compliment of my life.

1121
01:41:03,879 --> 01:41:06,322
Well, maybe I overshot a little,

1122
01:41:06,323 --> 01:41:10,508
because I was aiming at just enough
to keep you from walking out.

1123
01:41:21,798 --> 01:41:27,476
How's it going with those pills?
Good, I hope, I hope, I hope.

1124
01:41:33,321 --> 01:41:36,537
It's little by little.

1125
01:41:37,329 --> 01:41:42,506
It's exhausting talking like this.
Exhausting.

1126
01:42:01,669 --> 01:42:06,594
Do you ever let a romantic moment make
you do something you know is stupid?

1127
01:42:06,761 --> 01:42:08,850
Never.

1128
01:42:09,308 --> 01:42:12,265
Here's the trouble with never.

1129
01:42:34,024 --> 01:42:38,484
- You don't owe me that.
- That wasn't a payment.

1130
01:42:39,602 --> 01:42:42,858
When you first came into breakfast,
when I first saw you,

1131
01:42:42,859 --> 01:42:45,639
I thought you were handsome.

1132
01:42:46,465 --> 01:42:49,680
Then, of course, you spoke.

1133
01:42:51,434 --> 01:42:57,696
So, now that your soft,
little underbelly's all exposed.

1134
01:42:58,302 --> 01:43:01,784
Tell me,
why did you bring me here?

1135
01:43:05,065 --> 01:43:06,735
Well, I...

1136
01:43:11,911 --> 01:43:17,256
- That's a personal question.
- Tell me, even if you're scared.

1137
01:43:17,422 --> 01:43:21,347
- Scared?
- Tell me why you wanted me here.

1138
01:43:21,681 --> 01:43:26,399
It's okay.
If you ask me, I'll say yes.

1139
01:43:28,111 --> 01:43:29,947
I...

1140
01:43:31,492 --> 01:43:36,168
Well...
There's a lot of reasons.

1141
01:43:36,836 --> 01:43:41,231
I thought, maybe if you had sex
with Simon, maybe it would...

1142
01:43:41,232 --> 01:43:42,520
What?

1143
01:43:43,933 --> 01:43:49,612
- Well, it's just one idea.
- That's why you brought me?

1144
01:43:49,777 --> 01:43:54,203
Like I'm a, what,
and I owe you what?

1145
01:43:54,370 --> 01:43:59,130
I don't know why I brought you.
It was just one thought that I had.

1146
01:43:59,297 --> 01:44:02,846
It came out first. That was
all there was to it. I thought...

1147
01:44:03,013 --> 01:44:07,188
You kiss him, me, when you two
seemed to hit it off.

1148
01:44:07,354 --> 01:44:12,072
No. Wait, wait. That's, I didn't mean.
Forget what said about Simon.

1149
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:15,696
- I'll never forget you said it.
- It's a mistake.

1150
01:44:16,205 --> 01:44:18,585
It was a mistake.

1151
01:44:23,937 --> 01:44:26,729
Hello, this is Fred Bishop. And Betty.

1152
01:44:26,730 --> 01:44:29,270
Sorry to be unable to take your
call right now.

1153
01:44:29,305 --> 01:44:31,739
Please leave a message with all
pertinent information.

1154
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:34,542
- Say, "good-bye".
- Good-bye. - And thank you.

1155
01:44:34,909 --> 01:44:37,573
It's Simon.

1156
01:44:38,458 --> 01:44:41,022
I'm in town.

1157
01:44:41,623 --> 01:44:43,592
Hello?

1158
01:44:45,438 --> 01:44:49,351
Folks, you haven't been out later
than 10:00 in your entire lives.

1159
01:44:49,352 --> 01:44:51,456
Please pick up the phone.

1160
01:44:53,738 --> 01:44:55,860
Really.

1161
01:45:00,043 --> 01:45:04,493
Okay, I'm gonna try you in the morning.
I need to see you.

1162
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:07,766
Or at least
get you to answer the phone.

1163
01:45:16,867 --> 01:45:18,536
How are you?

1164
01:45:19,355 --> 01:45:22,047
- ls this going to be your room?
- Our room.

1165
01:45:22,048 --> 01:45:25,275
I don't wanna see him, and he's not
gonna come knocking on your door.

1166
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:29,183
- What happened?
- Don't ask.

1167
01:45:31,772 --> 01:45:34,855
- Can you not be so violent?
- I don't think so.

1168
01:45:34,891 --> 01:45:36,774
- Do you need help?
- No!

1169
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:42,459
I'm taking a big bath
and ordering a big meal.

1170
01:45:42,626 --> 01:45:45,673
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

1171
01:45:46,049 --> 01:45:49,849
Don't ask. I'm tired of my own complaints.
I gotta get some new thoughts.

1172
01:45:50,057 --> 01:45:54,900
- Why? What are you thinking about?
- How to die, mostly.

1173
01:45:56,362 --> 01:46:01,029
Can you believe in our little mix
you're the "good" roommate?

1174
01:46:13,270 --> 01:46:15,808
- Good night.
- Good night.

1175
01:46:58,024 --> 01:47:00,580
Hold it.

1176
01:47:20,736 --> 01:47:23,810
- I have to draw you.
- Ha?

1177
01:47:25,955 --> 01:47:29,212
- I have to draw you.
- No, no, no.

1178
01:47:29,378 --> 01:47:31,859
Absolutely not. I'm a lot more
shy than people think.

1179
01:47:31,896 --> 01:47:34,341
- I give off the wrong impression...
- I have to.

1180
01:47:34,376 --> 01:47:38,705
- I haven't sketched anything in weeks.
- Stop staring. Do a vase.

1181
01:47:40,067 --> 01:47:44,867
But you're beautiful, Carol.
Your skin, your long neck.

1182
01:47:45,452 --> 01:47:48,534
The back. The line of you.

1183
01:47:50,420 --> 01:47:54,022
You're why cavemen
chiseled on walls.

1184
01:47:56,816 --> 01:47:59,705
All right.
Cut me a break.

1185
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:26,320
The next thing I know
she's sitting right there next to me.

1186
01:48:26,972 --> 01:48:32,357
Well, it's not right to go into details.
I got nervous.

1187
01:48:32,524 --> 01:48:35,948
I screwed up.
I said the wrong thing.

1188
01:48:38,912 --> 01:48:41,960
Where if I hadn't,

1189
01:48:42,127 --> 01:48:46,051
I could be in bed right now
with a woman who

1190
01:48:46,219 --> 01:48:50,393
if you make her laugh you got a life.

1191
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:54,443
Instead, I'm here with you.

1192
01:48:54,610 --> 01:48:59,444
No of fence, but a moron
pushing the last legal drug.

1193
01:49:03,126 --> 01:49:06,258
Jameson, soda back.

1194
01:49:07,744 --> 01:49:10,807
I'm sorry.
I don't care how you put this.

1195
01:49:10,808 --> 01:49:15,217
- We're being naughty here, pal.
- No, no. This is, this is great.

1196
01:49:15,252 --> 01:49:17,338
This is so great.

1197
01:49:17,405 --> 01:49:22,173
I swear to God, my hand won't even
keep up. Hold it. Hold it.

1198
01:49:22,373 --> 01:49:25,314
- I'm just turning.
- But then hold that. Hold any of them.

1199
01:49:25,316 --> 01:49:27,288
- Okay, this?
- It doesn't matter.

1200
01:49:27,323 --> 01:49:30,339
I can't get over my hand's not
even bothering me.

1201
01:49:30,340 --> 01:49:32,433
I can't, I just,

1202
01:49:32,810 --> 01:49:36,693
I can't get the angle with this cast.

1203
01:49:40,074 --> 01:49:42,129
Careful.

1204
01:49:48,717 --> 01:49:50,471
PRIVACY

1205
01:49:53,435 --> 01:49:56,892
I'm coming in. It's late.

1206
01:50:02,402 --> 01:50:05,214
Did you have sex with her?

1207
01:50:05,215 --> 01:50:08,564
Okay, so are you sure you don't
want your shampoos or anything?

1208
01:50:12,305 --> 01:50:14,267
Sorry.

1209
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:19,861
I didn't know she was still here.
Did you have sex with her?

1210
01:50:20,029 --> 01:50:25,045
To hell with sex. It was better
than sex. We held each other.

1211
01:50:25,748 --> 01:50:31,677
What I need, he gave me great.
I'll get dressed in a hurry.

1212
01:50:36,457 --> 01:50:38,762
I just love her.

1213
01:50:44,870 --> 01:50:47,400
How are you doing?

1214
01:51:02,613 --> 01:51:05,282
- Hello?
- Mom, hi.

1215
01:51:05,283 --> 01:51:06,950
Hello, Simon.

1216
01:51:06,986 --> 01:51:09,021
You were right.
We were home last night.

1217
01:51:09,022 --> 01:51:11,116
Do you have to whisper?
I can barely hear you.

1218
01:51:11,150 --> 01:51:13,891
- I'm not a screamer. Look, the reason...
- No, no.

1219
01:51:13,892 --> 01:51:16,647
It was the luckiest thing for all of us
you didn't answer last night.

1220
01:51:16,681 --> 01:51:19,980
- Your father has not been feeling well.
- No, I can't hear you!

1221
01:51:20,147 --> 01:51:23,363
- Hold on.
- Hold for what? What do you gotta do?

1222
01:51:23,988 --> 01:51:27,755
I get why you're angry with me,
but it's no...

1223
01:51:27,756 --> 01:51:30,195
- He's talking to his parents.
- Then you listen to me.

1224
01:51:30,230 --> 01:51:33,716
Truly, no grudges. Okay?
Truly.

1225
01:51:33,752 --> 01:51:37,933
It was a little odd that you didn't come
and see me when you heard I was hurt, but

1226
01:51:38,099 --> 01:51:41,096
- We almost did.
- No, I don't even wanna talk about it.

1227
01:51:41,105 --> 01:51:44,513
The important thing is that
your son is happy.

1228
01:51:44,514 --> 01:51:47,787
- You do sound different.
- Yes, I'm working again.

1229
01:51:47,822 --> 01:51:50,845
- Good. About money...
- No, I don't need anything.

1230
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:53,827
I'll drop you a line from wherever I land,

1231
01:51:53,828 --> 01:51:56,870
and then it's up to you to make the
next move, and I hope that you do.

1232
01:51:56,905 --> 01:52:01,772
He's gonna wanna stay. And they'll wanna
take a ride to the lake or whatever...

1233
01:52:02,335 --> 01:52:05,307
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Goodbye, dear.

1234
01:52:05,309 --> 01:52:07,680
- He's gonna feel stirred up.
- By, Mom.

1235
01:52:08,163 --> 01:52:13,232
We'll probably have a good five-hour drive.
It'll give us a chance to relax...

1236
01:52:13,233 --> 01:52:16,686
- So?
- I'm coming with you.

1237
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:20,133
- What about your parents?
- No, no. I'll take care of it myself.

1238
01:52:20,168 --> 01:52:24,355
What are you talking about?
You've got real problems.

1239
01:52:24,389 --> 01:52:27,677
I know. I'm a little bit nervous.

1240
01:52:27,843 --> 01:52:31,519
Suddenly everything seems so easy.

1241
01:52:31,894 --> 01:52:35,484
Carol, a load has been lifted.

1242
01:52:37,906 --> 01:52:41,246
- One night with me.
- You think you're kidding.

1243
01:52:43,622 --> 01:52:45,061
Geez.

1244
01:52:45,237 --> 01:52:47,499
- No choice.
- I've got a gift for you.

1245
01:52:47,501 --> 01:52:50,522
Nothing like no choice to make
you feel at home.

1246
01:52:50,806 --> 01:52:54,605
Let me see. Gorgeous.

1247
01:52:55,123 --> 01:52:57,550
Do it then.
And get the dog picked up.

1248
01:52:57,551 --> 01:52:59,876
I can't believe you let it stay there.

1249
01:53:00,449 --> 01:53:02,547
Good-bye.

1250
01:53:03,456 --> 01:53:05,627
Your luck's running.

1251
01:53:05,794 --> 01:53:10,488
They sublet your place.
You're homeless.

1252
01:53:11,096 --> 01:53:14,733
Frank's got a line on another place
you could use for now.

1253
01:53:14,834 --> 01:53:16,939
Another place where?

1254
01:53:17,442 --> 01:53:20,190
Does it matter?

1255
01:53:22,076 --> 01:53:25,082
No, it doesn't.

1256
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,090
I'm fine. Like the hat?

1257
01:53:30,218 --> 01:53:32,012
I'm sorry.

1258
01:53:47,125 --> 01:53:49,548
FOR EMERGENCY USE ONLY

1259
01:54:04,543 --> 01:54:06,939
I don't wanna hear that music right now.

1260
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:09,201
What do you mean?
You said you liked it?

1261
01:54:09,202 --> 01:54:10,203
I don't.

1262
01:54:12,467 --> 01:54:14,800
This one has a meaning.

1263
01:54:14,801 --> 01:54:19,460
It's your car, but I don't wanna hear it,
if that means anything!

1264
01:54:38,694 --> 01:54:41,129
Yes, sir. All right.

1265
01:54:41,264 --> 01:54:45,324
Here's the keys to my apartment.

1266
01:54:45,491 --> 01:54:49,749
You go up there and wait,
and I'm gonna take Carol home,

1267
01:54:50,217 --> 01:54:54,466
- I'll take a bus.
- No, I'll take you.

1268
01:54:59,895 --> 01:55:02,817
Can you come here?

1269
01:55:02,984 --> 01:55:06,783
- Look, I don't care what you did for me.
- What's wrong?

1270
01:55:06,950 --> 01:55:12,335
I don't think I wanna know you anymore.
All you do is make me feel bad about myself.

1271
01:55:15,718 --> 01:55:18,382
You have my number.

1272
01:55:20,059 --> 01:55:24,234
- Let him take you home.
- Don't want to.

1273
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:28,351
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1274
01:55:37,868 --> 01:55:40,411
Don't say anything.

1275
01:55:43,314 --> 01:55:47,940
I gotta get a hold of Frank and
see where I'm hanging my hat.

1276
01:55:49,543 --> 01:55:52,444
I think you're going to
have to camp it here.

1277
01:55:52,545 --> 01:55:55,112
- What are you talking about?
- Look.

1278
01:55:55,147 --> 01:55:57,203
There's Verdell!

1279
01:55:57,404 --> 01:55:59,874
Come here.
Look at you, sweetheart.

1280
01:55:59,975 --> 01:56:03,831
You feel like your old self again.
I know the feeling.

1281
01:56:05,148 --> 01:56:08,439
Mommy and Daddy are home.

1282
01:56:10,242 --> 01:56:14,500
Sorry.
You're just fun to mess with.

1283
01:56:15,469 --> 01:56:17,891
They rented your place furnished.

1284
01:56:17,892 --> 01:56:21,014
Jackie said she was gonna bring
your personal things.

1285
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:24,561
They were going to set you up
in here. It's an extra room.

1286
01:56:24,562 --> 01:56:29,253
I never use it. It's got good light.
No other choice really.

1287
01:56:29,288 --> 01:56:31,241
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1288
01:56:36,810 --> 01:56:40,176
It's nice. It looks good.

1289
01:56:41,385 --> 01:56:47,483
They've even got your music,
paintings, paints.

1290
01:56:47,650 --> 01:56:50,219
I have to say they did a good job.

1291
01:56:53,310 --> 01:56:57,286
You know, it's gonna be okay, huh?
Cosy, huh?

1292
01:56:57,487 --> 01:56:58,934
Yeah.

1293
01:57:04,349 --> 01:57:08,942
Thank you, Melvin.
You overwhelm me.

1294
01:57:16,247 --> 01:57:18,644
I love you.

1295
01:57:24,138 --> 01:57:30,817
I tell you, buddy. I'd be the luckiest
guy alive if that did it for me.

1296
01:57:42,966 --> 01:57:45,698
Make yourself at home.

1297
01:57:47,634 --> 01:57:50,365
Anything else in the bag?

1298
01:57:50,732 --> 01:57:53,539
But I was playing soccer
while you were away.

1299
01:57:53,540 --> 01:57:54,746
I know.

1300
01:57:54,781 --> 01:57:57,783
I love my cookbook.

1301
01:57:58,331 --> 01:57:59,515
Great.

1302
01:57:59,516 --> 01:58:03,581
It's got all these wonderful recipes in here.
It says something with a shark.

1303
01:58:03,615 --> 01:58:06,834
I never even fixed shark before.
Shark with a bite.

1304
01:58:06,869 --> 01:58:09,096
- Would you like that, Spencer?
- No.

1305
01:58:09,131 --> 01:58:11,997
There's some cookies here
called "Wasps' nests".

1306
01:58:15,072 --> 01:58:18,538
Where is my big hairy boy?

1307
01:58:18,745 --> 01:58:23,548
Where is he?
Where is my beautiful boy?

1308
01:58:23,713 --> 01:58:25,784
Sweetheart!

1309
01:58:26,653 --> 01:58:29,517
- You're in bed.
- No, no.

1310
01:58:33,499 --> 01:58:34,932
Melvin.

1311
01:58:34,933 --> 01:58:40,539
I just didn't think Verdell should get too
comfortable sleeping in here because...

1312
01:58:40,571 --> 01:58:43,962
Look.
The dog's already comfortable.

1313
01:58:47,970 --> 01:58:49,932
Is this okay?

1314
01:58:51,895 --> 01:58:55,543
Hello? Hi, it's me.
Hi!

1315
01:58:55,903 --> 01:59:01,605
Yes. He took me in.
Yes. It's Carol for you.

1316
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:06,172
- Yes. I fainted when I walked...
- Just take the dog. Take the dog.

1317
01:59:07,174 --> 01:59:09,815
- Just take the dog.
- Come here.

1318
01:59:09,816 --> 01:59:11,442
That's right. Take him.

1319
01:59:12,519 --> 01:59:14,738
Come on. Move fast.

1320
01:59:14,739 --> 01:59:17,618
- Don't limp. Move fast.
- Good luck.

1321
01:59:30,340 --> 01:59:33,488
- Hello.
- Yeah.

1322
01:59:34,187 --> 01:59:37,317
- How are you doing?
- Not so hot.

1323
01:59:37,485 --> 01:59:39,694
Why? What's wrong?

1324
01:59:40,195 --> 01:59:43,657
I don't know whether I'm being
sensible or hard on you.

1325
01:59:43,692 --> 01:59:45,885
Maybe both. Maybe.

1326
01:59:45,886 --> 01:59:50,515
See? Right there I don't know whether
you're being cute or crazy now.

1327
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:51,591
Cute.

1328
01:59:51,592 --> 01:59:54,895
You don't have to answer everything I say.
Just listen to me, okay?

1329
01:59:54,924 --> 01:59:57,315
Listen to me.

1330
01:59:58,067 --> 02:00:02,167
It's really something
that you're looking after Simon.

1331
02:00:02,535 --> 02:00:08,212
And what I said on the street,
that was a bad thing to say.

1332
02:00:08,421 --> 02:00:13,457
It made me sick to my stomach.
It was a bad thing to say.

1333
02:00:14,933 --> 02:00:19,951
And I'd be lying if I didn't say
I enjoy your company.

1334
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:24,821
But the truth is you do bother
me enormously.

1335
02:00:24,822 --> 02:00:27,274
And I know that think that it's...

1336
02:00:27,275 --> 02:00:29,102
I think that it's better for me...

1337
02:00:29,136 --> 02:00:32,217
...to not have contact with you
because you're not ready.

1338
02:00:32,385 --> 02:00:36,935
And you're pretty old guy to not be ready,
and I'm too old to ignore that!

1339
02:00:37,102 --> 02:00:42,780
But there were extraordinary
kindnesses that did take place.

1340
02:00:49,461 --> 02:00:52,424
So, anyway, thanks for the trip.

1341
02:00:54,220 --> 02:00:56,557
Good night. Good night.

1342
02:00:56,725 --> 02:00:59,814
Okay if I say something now?

1343
02:01:03,864 --> 02:01:05,951
Go ahead.

1344
02:01:07,454 --> 02:01:10,929
I should've danced with you.

1345
02:01:14,718 --> 02:01:16,982
Good night.

1346
02:01:37,556 --> 02:01:42,148
- Are you going to talk to me or not?
- I'm coming.

1347
02:01:52,586 --> 02:01:56,327
- What did she say?
- That I'm a great guy.

1348
02:01:56,428 --> 02:01:58,131
Extraordinary.

1349
02:01:58,166 --> 02:02:01,427
And she doesn't want
contact with me.

1350
02:02:03,189 --> 02:02:05,769
I'm dying here.

1351
02:02:07,364 --> 02:02:13,093
- Because... you love her.
- No.

1352
02:02:13,460 --> 02:02:16,716
And you people are supposed to be
sensitive and sharp?

1353
02:02:16,884 --> 02:02:21,309
Then you tell me why!
You're the one who's dying here.

1354
02:02:21,476 --> 02:02:25,149
- I don't know. Let me sleep on it.
- Come on.

1355
02:02:25,317 --> 02:02:28,726
- I'll figure it out.
- Please.

1356
02:02:30,935 --> 02:02:36,923
I'm stuck.
I can't get back to my old life.

1357
02:02:39,052 --> 02:02:43,979
- She's evicted me from my life.
- Did you really like it that much?

1358
02:02:44,145 --> 02:02:47,261
It's better than this.
Look, you.

1359
02:02:47,527 --> 02:02:49,105
I'm very intelligent.

1360
02:02:49,106 --> 02:02:52,281
If you're gonna give me hope,
you gotta do better than you are doing.

1361
02:02:52,316 --> 02:02:56,044
If you can't be at least mildly interesting,
then shut the hell up!

1362
02:02:56,211 --> 02:03:00,219
I'm drowning here!
And you're describing the water.

1363
02:03:00,385 --> 02:03:03,475
Picking on me won't help.

1364
02:03:04,602 --> 02:03:08,084
If that's true,
I'm really in trouble.

1365
02:03:08,652 --> 02:03:12,702
Melvin.
Do you know where you're lucky?

1366
02:03:17,462 --> 02:03:20,535
You know who you want.

1367
02:03:21,302 --> 02:03:27,397
I would take your seat any day.
So do something about it! Go over there.

1368
02:03:27,564 --> 02:03:29,860
Now. Tonight.
Don't sleep on it.

1369
02:03:29,861 --> 02:03:33,159
I mean, it's not always good to
let things calm down.

1370
02:03:33,194 --> 02:03:37,375
You can do this, Melvin.
You can do this. You can.

1371
02:03:37,410 --> 02:03:40,772
Pull the stops. Tell her how you feel.
You can do this.

1372
02:03:41,306 --> 02:03:44,848
- I'm charged.
- Yes, you are.

1373
02:03:44,915 --> 02:03:47,124
She might kill me if I go there.

1374
02:03:47,125 --> 02:03:50,018
Then get in your jammies
and I'll read you a story!

1375
02:03:50,052 --> 02:03:52,135
Listen, I really think you have a
chance here.

1376
02:03:52,136 --> 02:03:56,062
The best thing you have going for you
is your willingness to humiliate yourself.

1377
02:03:56,098 --> 02:03:59,545
So go over there.
Do this. Catch her off guard.

1378
02:04:04,869 --> 02:04:07,167
- Okay.
- Okay.

1379
02:04:09,355 --> 02:04:11,928
- Thanks a lot.
- Okay.

1380
02:04:13,698 --> 02:04:15,793
Here I go.

1381
02:04:25,346 --> 02:04:27,642
What's wrong?

1382
02:04:29,728 --> 02:04:32,560
I forgot to lock the door.

1383
02:05:51,223 --> 02:05:54,856
- What do you want, Melvin?
- I'm sorry I woke you.

1384
02:05:55,024 --> 02:05:58,321
- Some other time
- I wasn't asleep.

1385
02:06:01,661 --> 02:06:03,965
What a break.

1386
02:06:05,627 --> 02:06:08,700
Is it a secret
what you're doing here?

1387
02:06:11,555 --> 02:06:14,319
I had to see you.

1388
02:06:17,692 --> 02:06:19,789
Because?

1389
02:06:22,410 --> 02:06:25,058
It relaxes me.

1390
02:06:26,919 --> 02:06:31,153
I'd feel better sitting outside your
apartment on the curb...

1391
02:06:31,261 --> 02:06:35,644
Than any other place
I can think of or imagine.

1392
02:06:35,812 --> 02:06:39,042
No, no, wait. That's overstating.

1393
02:06:39,077 --> 02:06:42,210
I'd rather be sitting inside on the steps,

1394
02:06:42,211 --> 02:06:44,813
because I don't wanna get my feet
in the gutter.

1395
02:06:44,822 --> 02:06:46,817
- What would that serve?
- Stop it!

1396
02:06:46,818 --> 02:06:50,441
Why can't I just have a normal
boyfriend? Why?

1397
02:06:50,475 --> 02:06:54,150
Just a regular boyfriend
who doesn't go nuts on me?

1398
02:06:54,185 --> 02:06:57,988
Everybody wants that, dear.
It doesn't exist.

1399
02:07:01,321 --> 02:07:06,155
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1400
02:07:12,593 --> 02:07:15,307
Boyfriend.

1401
02:07:18,688 --> 02:07:23,490
Come on in and try
not to ruin everything by being you.

1402
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:28,333
Maybe we could live
without the wisecracks?

1403
02:07:31,714 --> 02:07:34,470
Maybe we could.

1404
02:08:00,395 --> 02:08:05,405
It feels a little confined here.
Let's take a walk.

1405
02:08:08,328 --> 02:08:13,881
It's four in the morning.
A walk sounds a little screwy to me.

1406
02:08:14,758 --> 02:08:19,637
- If you don't mind.
- Well, if you need an excuse...

1407
02:08:20,770 --> 02:08:25,144
There's a bakery on the corner
we got a good shot it'll be open soon.

1408
02:08:25,153 --> 02:08:31,215
That way we're not screwy,
just two people that like warm rolls.

1409
02:08:35,425 --> 02:08:36,780
Okay.

1410
02:08:55,463 --> 02:08:57,130
What are you doing?

1411
02:08:57,223 --> 02:09:00,743
I still want you to hear part
of that car song.

1412
02:09:00,744 --> 02:09:02,417
You don't have to.

1413
02:09:09,073 --> 02:09:13,916
And darling I'm never lonely

1414
02:09:14,083 --> 02:09:17,590
whenever you're in sight...

1415
02:09:18,424 --> 02:09:20,687
Thank you.

1416
02:09:21,618 --> 02:09:23,796
You know, I was hope...

1417
02:09:38,715 --> 02:09:43,735
I'm sorry.
Whatever this is, is not gonna work.

1418
02:09:52,410 --> 02:09:55,091
- I'm feeling...
- What?

1419
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,799
I'm feeling better, Carol.

1420
02:09:59,966 --> 02:10:03,835
Melvin, even though it may
seem that way now,

1421
02:10:04,336 --> 02:10:07,356
you don't know me all that well.

1422
02:10:07,730 --> 02:10:10,478
I'm not the answer for you.

1423
02:10:10,946 --> 02:10:15,036
- I've got a great compliment for you.
- You know what?

1424
02:10:15,204 --> 02:10:19,428
Just let me, let me talk.

1425
02:10:25,683 --> 02:10:29,440
I might be the only person
on the face of the earth

1426
02:10:29,649 --> 02:10:32,882
that knows you're
the greatest woman on earth.

1427
02:10:32,917 --> 02:10:36,219
I might be the only one who appreciates

1428
02:10:36,220 --> 02:10:40,914
how amazing you are in every
single thing that you do.

1429
02:10:40,949 --> 02:10:45,171
And how you are with Spencer.
Spence.

1430
02:10:46,182 --> 02:10:50,398
And in every single thought that you have
and how you say what you mean

1431
02:10:50,566 --> 02:10:53,316
and how you almost always
mean something

1432
02:10:53,317 --> 02:10:58,104
that's all about being straight and good.

1433
02:10:58,540 --> 02:11:02,581
And I think most people miss
that about you.

1434
02:11:02,714 --> 02:11:04,451
And I watch them,

1435
02:11:04,452 --> 02:11:08,180
wondering how they can watch you bring
their food and clear their tables

1436
02:11:08,216 --> 02:11:12,358
and never get that they just met
the greatest woman alive.

1437
02:11:12,568 --> 02:11:17,703
And the fact that I get it
makes me feel good...

1438
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:21,092
...about me.

1439
02:11:29,267 --> 02:11:35,038
Is that something that's bad for you
to be around for you?

1440
02:11:44,923 --> 02:11:46,944
No.

1441
02:11:50,099 --> 02:11:52,282
I'm going to grab you.

1442
02:11:53,523 --> 02:11:58,199
I didn't mean for that to be
a question. I'm going to grab you.

1443
02:12:21,704 --> 02:12:24,885
I know I can do better than that.

1444
02:12:48,048 --> 02:12:50,929
Better.
Definitely better.

1445
02:12:55,938 --> 02:12:58,244
See?

1446
02:13:12,972 --> 02:13:17,590
- Want something?
- Warm rolls.

1447
02:13:25,866 --> 02:13:28,546
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.
