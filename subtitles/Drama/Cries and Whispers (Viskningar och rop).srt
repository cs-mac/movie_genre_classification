<i>Previously on "The Whispers"...</i>

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:03,511
- My wish came true.
- What did you wish for?

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,963
For Drill make you and daddy
love each other again.

4
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:07,925
Here's what we know about the entity.

5
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:10,635
It travels electrically,
through power cables,

6
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:12,761
so it can be identified
by a heat signature.

7
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,093
He uses kids, but not just any kids.

8
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,482
He chooses them carefully.
They all have access.

9
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:19,792
His whole planet was dying.

10
00:00:19,827 --> 00:00:21,794
He needed to send a signal
back to the others.

11
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:24,763
Mr. President, we
learned how to kill Drill.

12
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:26,765
He can posses the body of a child.

13
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:28,867
Once he does, he can be destroyed.

14
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:31,637
He never goes outside.

15
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:33,839
- He's always on the computer.
- Well, that's what kids do today.

16
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:36,077
- They play on the computer.
- Maybe we should take his away, then.

17
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,843
Let's just sign him up
for some sports or...

18
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:39,745
He's not you. He doesn't like sports.

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,613
Well, we don't always get
to do what we want, do we?

20
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:43,515
And you know what? It's about
time Nicholas learned that.

21
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:45,551
Seriously? He is a 10-year-old boy.

22
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:46,985
Why don't you take him to the park?

23
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:49,221
I... I see other kids
playing there all the time.

24
00:00:49,256 --> 00:00:51,323
Yeah, the other kids pick on him.

25
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:05,871
Who is that?

26
00:01:05,906 --> 00:01:07,439
Who's there?

27
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,110
Stop it! Go away!

28
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:13,645
Just go away! Leave me alone!
Stop it! Stop it!

29
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:15,881
- Nicholas? Nicholas?
- What's wrong?

30
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,483
Nicholas, are you all right?

31
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:21,787
Baby?

32
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,508
I heard a voice... Like a ghost.

33
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,443
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:30,446
He says he wants to be my friend.

35
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:32,515
A ghost?

36
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,116
Maybe if he made some real friends,

37
00:01:34,152 --> 00:01:38,054
he wouldn't have to invent imaginary ones.

38
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:40,256
Come here, baby. You're okay.

39
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,191
Okay.

41
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:21,697
How long are we gonna live like this?

42
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,733
Until we know we're safe.

43
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,868
How will we know when that is?

44
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:28,704
- I mean, if Drill can posses a child...
- Lena.

45
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,539
We know how close he is with Minx.

46
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:32,541
What if...

47
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:35,711
What if he chooses her?

48
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:39,382
That's... that's why we have monitors,

49
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:42,051
sensors all over the house, okay?

50
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:45,388
If he tries to go near Minx
or any of us, we'll know.

51
00:02:45,423 --> 00:02:49,158
How will knowing stop it from happening?

52
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,595
He finally got to sleep.

53
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,930
Just took three stories
and a children's aspirin.

54
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,932
Said he had a headache again.

55
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,102
He had one last night, too.

56
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:04,106
Everything he's been through,
to only have a headache?

57
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,441
Pretty tough kid.

58
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:10,246
Pretty tough mom, too.

59
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,122
No!

60
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:30,593
Minx?!

61
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:31,527
No, Drill! Leave me alone!

62
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,761
You stay away from her!

63
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,967
It's okay, daddy. He's gone now.

64
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:40,503
Okay. What did he want?

65
00:04:40,538 --> 00:04:45,107
He said that he'd forgive us
for everything we've done if...

66
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:46,909
If I help him make a new friend.

67
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:48,978
Okay, what... what... what friend, honey?

68
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:50,312
Did he... did he say who it is?

69
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:53,716
No. You said not to talk to him anymore.

70
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,950
- Good.
- So I didn't.

71
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:57,052
- Good.
- It's okay, baby. You did good.

72
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,622
We're just trying to figure out
what Drill is up to.

73
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:03,726
I don't know. But whatever
it is, it's gonna happen soon.

74
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,628
How do you know?

75
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,964
Because he said he needed to
play with his new friend now

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,135
because... He's running out of time.

77
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,770
Time for what?

78
00:05:14,805 --> 00:05:15,738
We don't know.

79
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:16,772
Well, if Drill's looking for a new friend,

80
00:05:16,823 --> 00:05:18,869
- that means he needs access to someone.
- Or something.

81
00:05:18,992 --> 00:05:20,532
But what? A-a new energy source?

82
00:05:20,702 --> 00:05:21,544
Well, we know he tried to call his friends,

83
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,579
and we destroyed any possibility of that.

84
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,015
So what would he want to do next?

85
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,283
It doesn't matter what Drill
wants. It's what we want.

86
00:05:27,318 --> 00:05:28,584
It's this thing out of lives for good.

87
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,252
Now, the only way we're gonna do that

88
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,420
is to stop reacting to Drill.

89
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:33,376
- We need to get a step ahead of him.
- Okay, but how?

90
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:34,644
The same way we would if we were tracking

91
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,980
any other killer... we profile Drill.

92
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,160
What are his habits?
How does he choose his victims?

93
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:40,829
And what happens when you find him?

94
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:43,064
We all know what
it's gonna take to kill Drill.

95
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,566
Are we really willing to go that far?

96
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:46,868
Dad?

97
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:47,902
Yeah?

98
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:50,705
I... I don't feel very good.

99
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:55,577
Is it your head again, sweetheart?

100
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:57,712
No, it's all over.

101
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:01,716
I got it, Claire.
I'll take him to the doctor.

102
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:06,888
You guys find the bastard
that's been hurting our kids.

103
00:06:06,923 --> 00:06:08,990
- Okay. How the hell do we do that?
- We know he feeds on energy.

104
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:10,725
We know he travels through power lines.

105
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,928
So there has to be some kind
of evidence of that, right?

106
00:06:13,964 --> 00:06:17,265
Trail of breadcrumbs
telling us where he's been,

107
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,734
hopefully where he's going next.

108
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:24,772
Ah, there you are. Good afternoon.
Agents, what can I do for you?

109
00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:26,708
We're wondering if
you've noticed any anomalies

110
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:29,677
in energy consumption over
the last few weeks...

111
00:06:29,713 --> 00:06:32,313
spikes, dips, anything out of the ordinary.

112
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:34,749
Guess it depends on what you
mean by "out of the ordinary."

113
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:41,923
What are those?

114
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,491
Brownouts.

115
00:06:43,526 --> 00:06:44,726
They're not uncommon in the summer heat,

116
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:45,793
when, uh, people crank their A.C.,

117
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:48,496
but it's been pretty cool lately, so...

118
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:49,964
Can you pull up the addresses?

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,165
Yeah, sure. Over here.

120
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:56,671
There you go.

121
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:00,875
There's a school, playground...

122
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:04,379
Harbor Point nuclear power plant.

123
00:07:04,414 --> 00:07:07,282
Bureau office where
we interviewed the kids.

124
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:09,517
Wes' house.

125
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:11,352
My house.

126
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:13,288
Capitol University Hospital, last night.

127
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:15,757
This is him, Claire.

128
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:18,493
That one, from this morning...
what's this spot?

129
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:21,863
Don't know. It's restricted.

130
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:23,398
One of those government buildings.

131
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,199
Usually NSA, D.O.D.

132
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:27,769
Uh-huh.

133
00:07:27,837 --> 00:07:29,570
We need to know what's there.

134
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:33,441
Okay, Claire. I... I'll make a few calls.

135
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:34,575
Mr. Lawrence.

136
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:35,743
Talk to me, Theo.

137
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:37,845
Okay, so, we looked
at the four thermal images

138
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:39,781
that you brought to us.

139
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:41,416
The first image is from 10 days ago,

140
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:44,319
directly after he consumed
the energy from the meltdown.

141
00:07:44,354 --> 00:07:46,120
Now, the most recent image is from today.

142
00:07:46,156 --> 00:07:48,890
Now, these images might
look similar to the naked eye,

143
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:50,258
but they're not.

144
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:52,827
From one image to the other,
the I.R. Energy is changing.

145
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:54,996
Theo? Layman's terms, please.

146
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:57,598
Uh, your alien has dissipated.

147
00:07:57,634 --> 00:07:59,734
It's literally getting less powerful.

148
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:01,135
That's not possible.

149
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:03,104
It's continually eating...
lights, power lines, et cetera.

150
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:05,039
Maybe it's different where he's from.

151
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:07,608
But in this planet, in this atmosphere,

152
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:09,610
he's basically chewing celery.

153
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:10,845
I don't understand.

154
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,481
It takes more energy to chew celery

155
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:15,316
than the celery can provide,

156
00:08:15,352 --> 00:08:16,918
so a human being
eating nothing but celery...

157
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:20,121
will starve to death.

158
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:30,298
Hey, Nicholas.

159
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,799
Can we ask you a couple of questions?

160
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:34,268
I guess.

161
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:35,403
When you were born,

162
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:36,738
did the whole hospital get stretch marks?

163
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,440
Just leave me alone, okay?

164
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:43,378
Please!

165
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:44,812
Okay, let him go.

166
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:09,370
Did you see that? Let's get out of here.

167
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:21,015
What did you say your name was?

168
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:26,020
Thank you for saving me, Drill.

169
00:09:28,391 --> 00:09:29,690
Okay.

170
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:32,360
How can I help save you?

171
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,725
The location you asked about...

172
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:42,828
there's a good reason
why it's ghosted on the map.

173
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,602
- DSN.
- The deep space network.

174
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:48,370
It's a system of transmission equipment

175
00:09:48,405 --> 00:09:52,874
used to track, receive, and send
messages to orbiting spacecraft.

176
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,777
We destroyed the rock, so Drill,

177
00:09:55,813 --> 00:09:57,946
he must be looking for another
way to send out the signal.

178
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:59,581
While he still can.

179
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:02,617
When he told Minx that he was
"running out of time,"

180
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:04,219
this is what he meant.

181
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:05,420
Now, according to my team,

182
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:08,890
Drill is getting weaker
every minute of every day.

183
00:10:08,926 --> 00:10:10,659
Now, if we can keep him away from DSN

184
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,094
or, more importantly,
keep him from feeding,

185
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,329
them maybe we don't have to kill him,

186
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,397
'cause maybe he'll just die off.

187
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:17,332
Wes...

188
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,034
I think I know how we do it.

189
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:21,603
Wes?

190
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:23,505
Lena, what's...

191
00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:26,575
What's going on?

192
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,876
Honey, I think I forgot
my sweater upstairs.

193
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:29,177
Would you go check for me?

194
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,413
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

195
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:34,082
What's this?

196
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:35,851
I'm scared.

197
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,920
If this thing can possess a child...

198
00:10:38,956 --> 00:10:41,957
I can't lose her.

199
00:10:41,992 --> 00:10:43,525
Not to something like that.

200
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,927
If Drill really wants Minx,

201
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:48,363
there's not a place he can't find her.

202
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,932
It doesn't matter if he knows where she is

203
00:10:50,968 --> 00:10:52,033
if he can't get to her.

204
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:57,839
We're taking a cruise from
Baltimore to the Caribbean.

205
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,275
If Drill travels through
power lines, then...

206
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,777
you're taking her where there aren't any.

207
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:04,513
It's a good plan.

208
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:05,847
It's not a good plan.

209
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,483
It's a great plan.

210
00:11:09,953 --> 00:11:13,288
I don't want you to leave... either of you.

211
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:16,424
Well, we're not leaving.
We're just taking a vacation.

212
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:19,594
Okay.

213
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:25,600
I couldn't find it, mommy.

214
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:27,869
That's okay, sweetie.
Come say goodbye to daddy.

215
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:30,438
Hey. Come here.

216
00:11:30,474 --> 00:11:33,141
Now, listen to me.

217
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:34,576
You be a good girl for your mother, okay?

218
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,844
Okay.

219
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,412
- Okay?
- Okay.

220
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,547
- Okay?
- Okay.

221
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:39,848
Okay.

222
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:41,149
Take care. I love you.

223
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:42,417
Bye, daddy. I love you, too.

224
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,352
See you soon. Bye.

225
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:45,520
Mwah.

226
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:48,423
Okay, off we go.

227
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:53,194
It started as a headache.

228
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,797
Now he's saying he's hurting everywhere.

229
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:59,234
Feels tired, weak.

230
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:01,002
This is a hospital, Sean.

231
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:02,771
Why not just bring him to his pediatrician?

232
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,540
I wasn't sure if his unique circumstance

233
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:06,975
was the thing that might
be causing any of this,

234
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,477
so I thought if anybody
understood, it was you.

235
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:13,515
I know what you're thinking

236
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,749
about those kids from last night.

237
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:17,986
But Henry's not like that.
He's a good boy, Maria.

238
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:20,589
You think he wouldn't
do whatever Drill asked

239
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:23,792
to save your life or his mother's?

240
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,394
We're all good, Sean,

241
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,496
until we have something to lose.

242
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:33,101
Have you lost your mind?

243
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:35,103
Black out an entire city?

244
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:36,705
Not the whole city, sir.
Just the parts that...

245
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,174
Do you have any idea of
the panic it would cause?

246
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:40,275
Oh, we do, sir. And by all means,

247
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,210
we are open to any ideas
you have to capture

248
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:43,945
the alien loose in our nation's capitol.

249
00:12:43,981 --> 00:12:46,214
Watching the grid,
we can identify his signature.

250
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:47,382
The next time he shows himself,

251
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:50,318
we shut the power down
grid by grid, block by block.

252
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:55,323
We drive him, funnel him
right where we want him.

253
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,425
A secure, abandoned building by the water.

254
00:12:57,461 --> 00:12:59,995
A safe zone with no people, no electricity.

255
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,797
- Yeah, and then what?
- We starve him out.

256
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,899
With no energy to feed on,
no way to leave the area...

257
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:07,335
and how long will that take?
We can't truly predict...

258
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,938
wait, you want to bring
Washington to its knees,

259
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:12,040
and you can't even tell me
how long it's gonna take?

260
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:13,508
Sir, I don't care how long it takes

261
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,943
because if we don't do something today,

262
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:17,212
Drill could bring this country
to its knees by tomorrow.

263
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:18,813
The DSN is secure.

264
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:21,216
Even if Drill can access
the electrical system,

265
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:23,351
operating the satellites
requires security codes

266
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:24,919
that change daily.

267
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:26,254
There's no way he can access...

268
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:28,857
he accessed a secure nuclear
facility while were outside,

269
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,291
waiting for him to get there.

270
00:13:31,862 --> 00:13:33,928
He will find a way, sir.

271
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:35,930
He always does.

272
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:42,037
I... fine, fine. I'll come in early.

273
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,438
But tell Bishop he owes me, all right?

274
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:45,173
That's three times this month.

275
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,508
And it's always me that gets the call.

276
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:49,110
Why is that?

277
00:13:49,146 --> 00:13:51,079
I do have a life, you know.

278
00:13:51,114 --> 00:13:53,181
No, I'm not trying to
make more of this than it is.

279
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:56,685
Just a schedule's a schedule, right?

280
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,855
Yeah, well, tell that to Bishop.

281
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:04,526
Tell him I can't do it tonight.

282
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:16,304
How's my boy?

283
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:17,605
I'm worried about him.

284
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:19,074
Maria's still examining him.

285
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,141
Still?

286
00:14:20,177 --> 00:14:21,509
I thought you'd be home by now.

287
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:24,612
Yeah. Hopefully soon. Why? What's wrong?

288
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:25,814
We're blacking out the city, Sean.

289
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:27,916
But to help make sure
that Drill doesn't find out,

290
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,284
we can't tell the public, so...

291
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:30,464
You know it's gonna be
a madhouse out there.

292
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:33,822
Yeah. Get home as soon as possible.

293
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:35,123
Okay, I don't want the two of you

294
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:36,758
out on the streets when this hits.

295
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,561
Okay.

296
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,536
The school was shut down three years ago,

297
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:50,572
so we got complete control of the campus.

298
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:53,842
- Neighbors?
- Compliant so far.

299
00:14:53,877 --> 00:14:55,810
We've evacuated nearly all of them.

300
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,646
What do you got?

301
00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:00,949
All right.

302
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,951
These give us what
the thermal cameras are showing,

303
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,419
and this one's tapped
into the city power grid.

304
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:07,655
Mr. Secretary, can you hear me?

305
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:10,625
Loud and clear, Wes.

306
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,293
Everything is in position.

307
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:13,628
We're just waiting for eyes on the target.

308
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,696
Any sign?

309
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:17,198
Not yet.

310
00:15:17,234 --> 00:15:18,399
Where are you, you son of a bitch?

311
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,472
Is that him?

312
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:25,707
It's the same energy draw

313
00:15:25,742 --> 00:15:28,143
as the brownouts you isolated before.

314
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,978
Looks like a park in Columbia Heights.

315
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:33,815
What do you think?

316
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,651
You better be damn sure, Mr. Lawrence,

317
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,286
before I blind this city.

318
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:41,790
We're sure, Mr. president.

319
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:46,027
Then shut it down.

320
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:01,124
What is it, mommy?

321
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:03,034
It looks like we're delayed an hour.

322
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:05,903
Okay, honey. Why don't
we go sit over there?

323
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,085
Drill?

324
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,686
Where are you?

325
00:16:22,722 --> 00:16:25,256
I brought what you wanted.

326
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,458
Look who's back.

327
00:16:30,596 --> 00:16:31,996
I'm supposed to meet my friend.

328
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:34,265
Sorry. Your friend ain't coming this time.

329
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,733
How do you know?

330
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:36,967
'Cause he told me.

331
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:39,570
What?

332
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:40,538
It was pretty cool.

333
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:41,972
He said he couldn't stay here

334
00:16:42,008 --> 00:16:45,342
and that you have to follow
the lights to find him.

335
00:16:45,378 --> 00:16:47,444
He also told me you're all right,

336
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,413
and we should give you a chance to show it.

337
00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:51,715
Thank you.

338
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:53,150
Good luck, Nicholas.

339
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:00,925
We're getting the first
crime reports in now

340
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,460
from the blacked-out areas, Agent Bennigan.

341
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:03,884
Well, that's to be expected, sir.

342
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,051
Question is, how long do
you stand around at the dance

343
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:07,521
till you realize you've been stood up?

344
00:17:07,556 --> 00:17:09,756
Maybe you should tell me, sir.

345
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,458
My dates always showed.

346
00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:18,899
Come on. Where are you?

347
00:17:20,936 --> 00:17:22,869
We're monitoring the situation as best can.

348
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:24,971
Obviously, the conditions
are just horrendous

349
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:26,907
for anyone in Baltimore today.

350
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:28,408
Because of these power outages, traffic...

351
00:17:28,443 --> 00:17:29,376
Almost home.

352
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:32,279
Shouldn't be too much longer, okay?

353
00:17:32,314 --> 00:17:36,016
Did the doctor tell you
what's wrong with me?

354
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:37,651
Uh, we had to leave
before the test came back,

355
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:38,818
but I'm sure it's probably nothing

356
00:17:38,854 --> 00:17:40,754
to worry about right now, okay, little man?

357
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:46,026
But what if it's not nothing?

358
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:48,728
What if it's Drill punishing me

359
00:17:48,764 --> 00:17:50,197
'cause I won't play with him anymore?

360
00:17:50,232 --> 00:17:51,831
Drill's not gonna hurt you, Henry.

361
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:54,267
In fact, mom is out there right now,

362
00:17:54,303 --> 00:17:57,771
making sure that he can't hurt
you or anyone else ever again.

363
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,876
Okay.

364
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:19,092
What?

365
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:21,027
He's here.

366
00:18:26,935 --> 00:18:28,668
- 8th and Jefferson?
- 8th and Jefferson.

367
00:18:28,704 --> 00:18:29,903
Are you sure it's him?

368
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:31,137
There's nothing on the grid
at their location.

369
00:18:31,173 --> 00:18:33,106
If Henry says it's there,
I say we go for it.

370
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:34,341
If we black out that grid,

371
00:18:34,376 --> 00:18:36,610
they'll be stuck right in the middle of it.

372
00:18:36,645 --> 00:18:38,211
Claire, we're gonna be fine.

373
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:39,512
Just do it.

374
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,717
Take out grid 8.

375
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:57,397
Of course. No, stay in the car.

376
00:18:57,432 --> 00:18:59,532
W... What's going on?

377
00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:00,634
Hey.

378
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:03,236
We're gonna be fine. Okay?

379
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,939
It worked. There he is.

380
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:07,540
Look at all those brownouts.

381
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:08,708
It's like he's starting to panic.

382
00:19:08,744 --> 00:19:11,645
He must be trying to find a way out.

383
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,912
Well, let's give him one.

384
00:19:12,948 --> 00:19:16,950
Funnel him straight to us.
Take out 5, 6, and 7.

385
00:19:38,607 --> 00:19:39,572
Let's go! Back up!

386
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:54,087
You did it!

387
00:19:54,122 --> 00:19:55,488
We did it. On our way now.

388
00:19:55,524 --> 00:19:57,257
First star on the right?

389
00:19:57,292 --> 00:19:58,825
And straight on till morning.

390
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:06,599
I'll be damned. It's working.

391
00:20:06,635 --> 00:20:08,001
How close is he?

392
00:20:08,036 --> 00:20:10,003
Almost home.

393
00:20:18,814 --> 00:20:19,946
Where is this son of a bitch?

394
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:28,855
He's inside the school.

395
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:33,360
He's here.

396
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:43,481
Go dark now.

397
00:20:47,987 --> 00:20:50,888
- It worked?
- It seems so.

398
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:53,924
Without any power source,
he can't move, right?

399
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,193
That's the idea.

400
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:57,820
I think we can assume he's not
gonna be too happy about this.

401
00:20:57,855 --> 00:20:59,755
I need some help here.

402
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:03,659
You okay?

403
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:17,606
Henry?

404
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:19,308
Henry?

405
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:27,416
H... Henry? Henry?

406
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:29,518
Henry? Son?

407
00:21:29,553 --> 00:21:30,953
Dad?

408
00:21:30,988 --> 00:21:32,154
Okay, don't move.

409
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:34,823
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

410
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:45,934
We can't go, mommy.

411
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,403
Honey, we've been through this.

412
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:49,471
I don't want to leave daddy here.

413
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:51,273
He's gonna come meet us as soon as he can.

414
00:21:52,843 --> 00:21:55,077
Honey, here. Come.

415
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:02,151
Look, I don't like the idea
of being away from your dad

416
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:04,586
any more than you do.

417
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:06,321
But...

418
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:09,558
Drill doesn't care about us.
He's after you.

419
00:22:09,593 --> 00:22:12,494
And we need to keep you as
far away from him as possible.

420
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,796
Breaking news...

421
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:15,864
the nation's capitol has been taken down

422
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,366
by a mysterious blackout.

423
00:22:17,401 --> 00:22:20,402
What's happening?

424
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:24,907
I don't know.

425
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:26,508
We need to find your dad.

426
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:28,110
Have you heard from Lena?

427
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:29,745
Yeah, she said she'd call me when she gets

428
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,947
far enough out to sea.

429
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:34,216
Hopefully, you'll be able
to tell her this is all over,

430
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:36,385
she and Minx can come home.

431
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,889
Sean and Henry would like
that news, too, right?

432
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:45,160
I like him... Sean.
He's... he's a good man.

433
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:47,730
Yeah.

434
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,368
Yeah, he is.

435
00:22:53,404 --> 00:22:55,938
It's funny.

436
00:22:55,973 --> 00:23:00,776
I think I had to lose him...
really lose him...

437
00:23:00,811 --> 00:23:03,879
to understand exactly what
it was I needed to save.

438
00:23:03,914 --> 00:23:06,315
I feel the same way...

439
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,417
About Lena.

440
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:11,286
I guess I just forgot who she really was.

441
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:34,743
There's something there.

442
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:36,645
What?

443
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,980
There. You see?

444
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:39,248
Wes, there's a kid inside.

445
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:40,249
How?

446
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:41,617
Drill. He must have lured him.

447
00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:43,218
He knew what was happening.
He took a hostage.

448
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,025
Sir, we need to get the kid out.

449
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,795
No, what we need to do
is hold our position.

450
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,429
I can get to him before anything happens.

451
00:23:54,465 --> 00:23:57,199
For all we know, that kid
may be part of a trap.

452
00:23:57,234 --> 00:23:58,967
I will not allow you or any
of my men to take that risk.

453
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:01,904
- I need you to stay here, Claire.
- Wes, I'm going with you.

454
00:24:01,939 --> 00:24:03,205
Claire.

455
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:11,880
What the hell are you doing?
I ordered you to stand down.

456
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:14,616
I'm sorry, Mr. Secretary.
I'm disobeying those orders.

457
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:18,187
Wes, this is insubordination.

458
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:20,289
Yes, it is, sir.

459
00:24:26,197 --> 00:24:29,031
Taxi!

460
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:29,998
Oh, come on, Wes.

461
00:24:35,105 --> 00:24:37,506
Excuse me.

462
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:38,640
Can you get us into D.C.?

463
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:40,108
Sorry, lady. The city's closed.

464
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:41,543
Look, I'll pay you whatever you want.

465
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:42,578
I'd love to take your money,

466
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:43,679
but I'm telling you there's no way in.

467
00:24:43,714 --> 00:24:46,415
You guys need a ride?

468
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,518
I just dropped my sister off.
I'm heading back home.

469
00:24:49,553 --> 00:24:51,220
Uh, he said the city's closed.

470
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:52,988
I know the city inside and out.

471
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:54,289
I can find a way.

472
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:24,653
If we're gonna find that kid...

473
00:25:24,688 --> 00:25:26,088
we need to split up.

474
00:25:26,123 --> 00:25:29,491
Okay. Keep your coms on.

475
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:30,692
As soon as anything feels off...

476
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:32,227
I'll call in.

477
00:25:32,263 --> 00:25:34,696
Okay.

478
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:22,611
Wait. Wait!

479
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:36,491
Claire, what's happening?

480
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:38,660
I saw him.

481
00:26:38,696 --> 00:26:41,330
He was here.

482
00:27:27,478 --> 00:27:29,211
We're not here to hurt you.

483
00:27:31,982 --> 00:27:33,882
I just want to talk to you.

484
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:38,487
- I'm following the kid.
- Where are you?

485
00:27:38,522 --> 00:27:39,988
Uh, somewhere on
the second floor, the West side.

486
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:42,324
Okay, I'm coming.

487
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,231
Drill.

488
00:27:55,605 --> 00:27:57,838
He's here.

489
00:27:57,874 --> 00:28:00,408
Drill.

490
00:28:00,443 --> 00:28:02,009
He can't move.

491
00:28:02,045 --> 00:28:04,078
Be careful.

492
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,934
How is he doing that? How is he moving?

493
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,903
He must have consumed what little energy

494
00:28:28,938 --> 00:28:30,538
was in that thermal monitor.

495
00:28:30,573 --> 00:28:31,806
He can't go far.

496
00:28:45,722 --> 00:28:47,722
Wes.

497
00:28:47,757 --> 00:28:49,357
See, Drill?

498
00:28:49,392 --> 00:28:52,126
I told you I could get them here.

499
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:54,795
Henry?

500
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:56,731
Be honest. Talk to me. Hey.

501
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:58,499
Dad, my head still hurts.

502
00:28:58,534 --> 00:29:00,134
Okay. Hold on.

503
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:01,736
We'll get you out of here, pal.

504
00:29:01,788 --> 00:29:03,587
You just stay right there.
Put your head right back there.

505
00:29:03,623 --> 00:29:05,089
Hey!

506
00:29:10,263 --> 00:29:12,596
What are you doing out here?

507
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,200
My son, he's stuck.

508
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,304
Well, let's get him out.

509
00:29:24,777 --> 00:29:25,876
On 3.

510
00:29:25,912 --> 00:29:27,478
1, 2...

511
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:35,619
Thank you.

512
00:29:38,257 --> 00:29:41,458
Henry? Come on, son.

513
00:29:41,494 --> 00:29:42,560
Okay.

514
00:29:42,595 --> 00:29:45,129
Come on.

515
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:48,065
Stop.

516
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:50,668
Says he doesn't want you coming any closer.

517
00:29:50,703 --> 00:29:53,304
Okay. Just tell us what your name is.

518
00:29:54,907 --> 00:29:56,006
Nicholas.

519
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:58,242
Nicholas...

520
00:29:58,277 --> 00:29:59,910
We have to get out of here.

521
00:29:59,946 --> 00:30:01,679
Not until you let Drill out.

522
00:30:01,714 --> 00:30:04,715
He's hovering right above him.

523
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,550
This is not happening!
You're not getting out of here!

524
00:30:08,554 --> 00:30:11,922
Wes, he's moving closer.

525
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:17,561
Okay, stop. Just... Just talk to us.

526
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:20,297
Your husband...
uh, he's not a fan of cruises?

527
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,365
Excuse me?

528
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,268
Your wedding ring.

529
00:30:24,303 --> 00:30:26,704
Oh.

530
00:30:26,739 --> 00:30:30,708
Uh, he had to stay behind to work.

531
00:30:30,743 --> 00:30:32,509
What's he do?

532
00:30:32,545 --> 00:30:33,844
Why us?

533
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,914
You could get your energy from
other stars, other planets.

534
00:30:36,949 --> 00:30:38,048
Why come here?

535
00:30:39,051 --> 00:30:40,951
He says their future is dying.

536
00:30:41,954 --> 00:30:43,187
And they need a new one.

537
00:30:43,222 --> 00:30:45,623
But how can we give that to them?

538
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:48,859
He says you don't need
to worry about that now.

539
00:30:48,895 --> 00:30:50,794
I don't want to do this any more.

540
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,929
I want to go home.

541
00:30:51,964 --> 00:30:55,199
Okay, Nicholas. Listen to me.

542
00:30:55,234 --> 00:30:58,335
Listen to me.
Everything is gonna be okay...

543
00:30:58,371 --> 00:31:00,771
If you just do exactly
what I tell you to do.

544
00:31:03,609 --> 00:31:05,009
What is he saying, Nicholas?

545
00:31:07,146 --> 00:31:09,647
He says you never tell
the children the truth,

546
00:31:09,682 --> 00:31:11,282
that things aren't gonna be okay.

547
00:31:11,317 --> 00:31:12,449
We're just trying to protect them.

548
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:17,888
He says you don't even listen
to us... not like he does.

549
00:31:17,924 --> 00:31:20,991
You're too busy playing
your own games with each other,

550
00:31:21,027 --> 00:31:23,260
too busy to really love us.

551
00:31:24,263 --> 00:31:25,396
But Drill loves us.

552
00:31:25,431 --> 00:31:28,799
Nicholas, I need you to listen to me now.

553
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:30,467
Drill says you're good at tricking kids.

554
00:31:30,503 --> 00:31:31,535
No. No, that's not true.

555
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,670
I am just trying to help you, Nicholas.

556
00:31:34,307 --> 00:31:36,540
He says you can't even help your own son...

557
00:31:37,777 --> 00:31:40,311
that he's the one who
gave Henry his hearing back,

558
00:31:40,346 --> 00:31:42,579
and that he can make Henry love him again

559
00:31:42,615 --> 00:31:45,516
when he tells him what you did,

560
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:47,384
what the two of you did.

561
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,386
You stay away from Henry!

562
00:31:52,158 --> 00:31:53,958
Drill, my head feels funny.

563
00:31:53,993 --> 00:31:56,093
We need to stop this.

564
00:31:56,128 --> 00:31:57,161
Wes?

565
00:31:57,196 --> 00:31:59,196
No! What are you doing?!

566
00:32:04,103 --> 00:32:05,536
He's starting the possession, Wes.

567
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:10,708
It's... it's so hot.

568
00:32:12,445 --> 00:32:14,745
Aah! It's so hot! It's burning!

569
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,814
Please make it stop! Drill,

570
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:18,983
you say you love them, but you don't.

571
00:32:19,018 --> 00:32:20,037
You wouldn't do this to someone that

572
00:32:20,062 --> 00:32:21,085
- you love.
- I'm burning! I'm burning!

573
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,220
Sir, you need to turn the grid back in.

574
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:25,289
- He's gonna take the kid.
- I can't do that, Wes.

575
00:32:25,324 --> 00:32:27,658
Do you understand what that means?

576
00:32:27,693 --> 00:32:29,626
Burning! It means we end this.

577
00:32:29,662 --> 00:32:31,595
Ow! Please, make him stop! Drill, stop it!

578
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,697
Mr. President, I know you're seeing this!

579
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:35,466
This is not who we are.
We can't do it this way.

580
00:32:35,501 --> 00:32:38,535
Sir, we may not get another shot.

581
00:32:38,571 --> 00:32:41,805
This is our chance to destroy the enemy.

582
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:43,874
- Yes, at what cost?
- "At what cost?"

583
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:46,176
We make these decisions every day, Wes.

584
00:32:46,212 --> 00:32:48,312
As difficult as this sacrifice is,

585
00:32:48,347 --> 00:32:49,880
it's ultimately a small price,
when you consider...

586
00:32:49,915 --> 00:32:53,684
if you think this comes at
a small price, you're wrong.

587
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:55,386
- Wes, we can't let this happen.
- I know.

588
00:32:55,421 --> 00:32:57,521
Mr. president, before
you were commander in chief,

589
00:32:57,556 --> 00:32:59,923
you were a father. You are a father.

590
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:02,760
And Nicholas, he has a father...

591
00:33:02,795 --> 00:33:04,228
a father who you will
have to face and explain why

592
00:33:04,263 --> 00:33:05,529
you allowed his son to die.

593
00:33:05,564 --> 00:33:07,631
For that father, there will be no solace.

594
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:10,601
So for that, I assure you
this is no small price.

595
00:33:10,636 --> 00:33:13,437
Let Drill go. Please.

596
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,438
Please! Please stop!

597
00:33:14,473 --> 00:33:15,739
We will find another way.

598
00:33:15,775 --> 00:33:18,075
Open up the grid.

599
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,743
Mr. President, I have to advise you...

600
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:21,311
that's an order.

601
00:33:28,654 --> 00:33:31,755
Okay, okay. Okay, okay.

602
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:34,758
Okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

603
00:33:34,794 --> 00:33:37,628
This is not over.

604
00:33:37,663 --> 00:33:39,630
You hear me?

605
00:33:42,668 --> 00:33:45,302
I will hunt you down.

606
00:33:45,337 --> 00:33:48,972
I will destroy you.

607
00:33:49,008 --> 00:33:52,943
Mark my words, you will never win!

608
00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:29,955
Are you okay?

609
00:34:43,437 --> 00:34:47,306
I can't thank you enough.

610
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:49,208
Oh, I'm not gonna take your money.

611
00:34:49,243 --> 00:34:51,477
- Please.
- No, y... You needed a helping hand.

612
00:34:51,512 --> 00:34:52,778
That's all I offered.

613
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:54,113
Oh.

614
00:34:54,148 --> 00:34:56,682
I was worried you were gonna be
some crazy killer or something.

615
00:34:56,717 --> 00:34:57,983
I'm sorry.

616
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:00,419
- Well, I'm happy to allay your fears.
- Thank you.

617
00:35:00,454 --> 00:35:01,720
Bye-bye. Goodnight.

618
00:35:01,756 --> 00:35:03,489
Goodnight.

619
00:35:07,495 --> 00:35:09,728
Okay.

620
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,601
Made it home, buddy.

621
00:35:15,636 --> 00:35:18,871
Go turn some lights on.

622
00:35:29,517 --> 00:35:31,784
- Hey, dad?
- Yeah?

623
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:34,319
I never got a chance to thank
the man who helped us.

624
00:35:34,355 --> 00:35:36,388
I told him we'd call in the morning.

625
00:35:39,727 --> 00:35:43,395
It just goes to show you, when you need it,

626
00:35:43,431 --> 00:35:45,964
people will come to the rescue.

627
00:35:48,703 --> 00:35:49,968
Come on.

628
00:35:50,004 --> 00:35:51,870
You think I made the wrong call?

629
00:35:51,906 --> 00:35:54,740
May I be frank, sir?

630
00:35:56,343 --> 00:35:58,343
I'd expect nothing less.

631
00:35:58,379 --> 00:36:01,413
I don't think you made the wrong call.

632
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:02,948
I know you made the wrong call.

633
00:36:03,648 --> 00:36:05,337
And now that he knows we're after him,

634
00:36:05,845 --> 00:36:08,654
there's no telling what he might do.

635
00:36:08,689 --> 00:36:12,958
And that, sir... That is on you.

636
00:36:22,136 --> 00:36:25,003
I'll be home soon.

637
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:26,805
Okay.

638
00:36:29,877 --> 00:36:31,443
They're home safe.

639
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:33,212
Good.

640
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:35,013
How's Nicholas?

641
00:36:35,049 --> 00:36:36,648
They think he's gonna be fine.

642
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:48,794
You need to take that.

643
00:36:48,829 --> 00:36:51,764
Yeah.

644
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:54,333
Goodnight, Wes.

645
00:36:55,836 --> 00:36:59,538
Goodnight, Claire.

646
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:02,641
- Wes?
- Hi, honey.

647
00:37:02,676 --> 00:37:04,910
Oh, thank God. I was so worried.

648
00:37:04,945 --> 00:37:06,445
You girls far out?

649
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,884
No. No, Minx and I, we changed our minds.

650
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:13,218
We're home.

651
00:37:15,256 --> 00:37:19,258
Lena, I...

652
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:22,995
Okay.

653
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,731
Come home.
