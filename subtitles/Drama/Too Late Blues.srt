1
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:17,900
Hey you little shit, give me that sax!

2
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:46,133
Can I have my sax back, please?

3
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:56,000
Where is Nick?

4
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:59,000
Probably in the can.

5
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,749
Beer Ghost? Yeah, please Red.

6
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,450
You want one? Yes, definitely.

7
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:15,114
Gentlemen, you all know
our host, Nick Bobolenos

8
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:16,800
Nick. How are you Nick

9
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:18,000
If you don't mind, we're
gonna have a bottle of beer.

10
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,265
Hey don't mind.

11
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,350
Mind if we use the tables, Nick?

12
00:03:20,424 --> 00:03:22,424
Hey that's a great vest
you got in there Nick.

13
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, must be new.

14
00:03:24,428 --> 00:03:26,428
Hey Nick, you still smoking ditches?

15
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:32,012
We all joined the diners club, Nick.

16
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:34,000
Have a beer, Nick.

17
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:57,536
How many times have I told you,
not to fool around that beer?

18
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:59,500
Who do you think you are, huh?

19
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:01,532
Who's the boss around
here? I'm the boss!

20
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:04,800
Bobolinas. Nick Bobolinas, proprietor.

21
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:07,817
- Have another beer.
- How 'bout a sandwich?

22
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:10,700
- A sandwich.
- And don't make fun of my accent.

23
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,000
You speak English like Spotik.

24
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:13,900
- What? What?
- Nothing Nick.

25
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,500
What kind of sandwich do you want?

26
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:18,649
You know, all baloney, ham,
sardines, you know, you fix it up.

27
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:21,500
Where are the girls, Nick?

28
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:24,000
They're gambling, playing
cards at Milly Papadakis place.

29
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:26,202
You ought to keep your
sisters off the streets, Nick.

30
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:30,427
Well, I think it's better for them to play
cards, than to hang around bums like you.

31
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:34,693
Bums? You call us bums?

32
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:38,200
Ignorant. Ignoramus. Why don't
you go and work for a living?

33
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:39,500
Look who's talking, man.

34
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:43,300
I sweep the floors, carry Coca
Cola's, they're like dumbells. I work!

35
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,512
- Nick, that's your business.
- But I work with my hands!

36
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,700
Do you trust me, Nick?

37
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:51,742
Sure I trust you, Ghost. But what
does that have to do with my business?

38
00:04:52,252 --> 00:04:54,000
You don't want us to
be unhappy, do you Nick?

39
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:58,815
Look, you're happy doing what you're doing. You
take care of pool hall, you serve some sandwiches.

40
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:01,073
You talk to dumbells like us.

41
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,650
Imagine, could I own a pool hall, Nick?

42
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:06,351
Imagine if I worked all my life,
and raised kids, and then...

43
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,399
And then fifty years later, I died.

44
00:05:08,657 --> 00:05:11,700
I'd miss my music, I'd miss
my fun, We'd miss everything.

45
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,310
Most of all, Nick. We'd miss you.

46
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:20,242
Oh, come on Ghost, Nobody miss nobody.

47
00:05:20,865 --> 00:05:22,865
Hey tough guy, what kind of mustard
do you want in your sandwiches?

48
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,450
Fix them in your own style, Pop. How long does
it take you too learn that we are free thinkers?

49
00:05:28,598 --> 00:05:30,000
Hey Nick, wanna go to a party tonight?

50
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,750
No, I'm gonna go to the movies.

51
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:34,200
- He's quite undependable.
- He's a regular family man.

52
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:37,500
That's all you see at your parties,
A lot of cheap dames and beer.

53
00:05:37,576 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh no. No.

54
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:41,781
What's the matter with beards? All
the old Greeks used to wear 'em out.

55
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,557
Yeah but they were nothing
but laughing daddies, you know?

56
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,900
Nine in the corner.

57
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:48,945
Hey Red, you need a tie. Hey Nick,
can I have a Greek tie for Red please.

58
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:51,732
Why do you need Greek
ties? Eh? I got ties.

59
00:05:51,835 --> 00:05:55,835
Okay, Red, would you go get on of
those, ties, from the Greek please.

60
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,500
Come here, Red.

61
00:05:58,356 --> 00:06:00,356
Why don't you come to
the party tonight, Nick?

62
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,350
I'm too old for picnics.

63
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:04,450
Ah, boy, that's pretty.

64
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:08,226
Listen, pay no attention
to the guys, now.

65
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:12,500
If the philosophy in this country,
were like the philosophy in my country.

66
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,000
Over there, you find a
woman, you love that woman.

67
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,200
Right? Then you don't need
nobody, you don't need no things.

68
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:24,300
One woman. She puts her arms
around you, and says: Nico...

69
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're my man.

70
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,000
That's what...

71
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:31,250
What's the matter, Nick?
Don't you go out with girls?

72
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,100
No. Right now, I own a business.

73
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:37,100
Hey, and don't you forget, to pay
for the beer and for the sandwiches.

74
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,410
You hear that?

75
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:41,100
- Charlie, will you pick up that tab?
- Yeah, will you pick up that tab?

76
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:45,841
Oh, Charlie. Come on,
come on, where's the dough?

77
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,909
Hey, hey, come on, let's go.

78
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,200
Let me have the loot guys.

79
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:55,000
- Oh, man.
- Come on, come on.

80
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,300
Milt, Shelley. Ten cents. Twenty cents.

81
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,200
Charlie? Are you kidding?

82
00:06:58,246 --> 00:07:00,700
I should've known better than
ask. How much do we owe you, Nick?

83
00:07:01,257 --> 00:07:04,800
- Two dollars, twenty cents, including the tip.
- Hold out your hand, please.

84
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:07,450
There's a dollar twenty, on account.

85
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,800
- On account?
- On account, that's all we got.

86
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,005
- Well let me tell you a little Greek history.
- Please.

87
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:15,295
You know, you guys don't fool
me one little bit, you know?

88
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:18,900
I write everything upstairs,
down in my little Greek head.

89
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,250
You still owe me one buck,
and including the tip.

90
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:23,350
- Your shot Pete.
- Thank you.

91
00:07:23,358 --> 00:07:25,000
Oh, yes siree, gentleman!

92
00:07:26,902 --> 00:07:28,902
Hey Ghost, what are we
doing after this wekk?

93
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:31,111
Something crazy will turn up, Charlie.

94
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,450
Hey listen Ghost, this
thing is getting serious.

95
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:36,700
All we ever do is festivals.

96
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:42,000
Festivals in San Diego, festivals in San
Franciso. Playing jazz for deaf-mutes.

97
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:44,300
For old ladies homes, for the blind.

98
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,050
Man, when are we going to make
it. That's what I want to know.

99
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:49,000
Never, Charlie.

100
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,656
Not if you're looking for some rainbow.

101
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,950
I mean. I... I think we ought to
get a nighttime spot once in a while.

102
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,450
Ahh, Charlie Griper.

103
00:07:57,025 --> 00:07:59,100
I mean, these daytime
jobs, you play for nobody.

104
00:08:00,205 --> 00:08:02,500
I'm thirty years old man, I want
to make it in this world someday.

105
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:04,350
I don't want to be a
nothing all my life.

106
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,600
Charlie, we're something.

107
00:08:05,605 --> 00:08:08,500
- I'm happy.
- Man, I'm thirty three years old.

108
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:12,128
Now for valients, come and get 'em!

109
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,000
Excuse me, gang.

110
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:22,650
Where you been, you man you?

111
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,000
Hey, what happened?
None of ya' got drinks.

112
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,120
Well, we don't bring out own.

113
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,044
- You buying?
- What are we standing out here for?

114
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:34,549
Ghost, I wanted to tell you something else man. I
really love what you and your boys are doing, you know?

115
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:37,582
I do really dig what you're
playing, know what I mean?

116
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:43,304
The reason why man, is because most of these people here are
nothing but a bunch of what you call hangers-on, you know?

117
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:48,800
And drifters, and floaters, you
know? And chicks, and smilers.

118
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,976
Man, you know, they're just
terrible. You know what I mean?

119
00:08:50,985 --> 00:08:53,696
Hey, Shelly, I didn't
see you there, now.

120
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,100
What are you doing? Hiding
behind your drumsticks?

121
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:59,800
I heard you tied the knot. Why didn't
you invite Baby Jack into the party?

122
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,106
Oh man, it was small.

123
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:04,869
It was small, dig that.
Hey, ch... small, champagne.

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh oh, waiter!

125
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:08,890
Oh, we'll get you something in a min...

126
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,382
Oh, there you go. Do you
have champagne in that uh...

127
00:09:11,424 --> 00:09:14,696
- Yes sir.
- And why are you so hostile?

128
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:18,984
Look man, don't just stand there.
Give these people something to drink.

129
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:22,114
- Easy, easy.
- There you go.

130
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:23,149
Easy, this ain't no rush hour.

131
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:26,243
You have yourself a good time this
evening, and I'll see you later.

132
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:28,178
- Okay?
- Groovey baby.

133
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,262
- Same party, Charlie.
- Yeah, same party Ghost.

134
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,931
- Same chicks even.
- Same chicks.

135
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,924
The way you say it,
I think you miss this.

136
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,141
Of course I miss it. It's
a top, man. I'm no freak.

137
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,370
Yeah, Charlie.

138
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,348
Ghost, if I want to be here.
It's so easy, I could be here.

139
00:09:51,743 --> 00:09:54,319
Five years ago I was playing
top feature in top spots.

140
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,532
- We play charities now.
- Right.

141
00:09:56,613 --> 00:09:58,939
- Of course I miss it, I ain't no freak.
- Right, Charlie.

142
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,400
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute, where you going?

143
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:20,270
- Now sweetie baby, you just rub my beard, you won't be nervous.
- Right

144
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,000
- No, honey I don't want to...
- Come on baby, sing one.

145
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:28,800
- Right.
- Come on now, don't be shy.

146
00:10:35,617 --> 00:10:37,204
Come on over and sings us
something. Let me see what...

147
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,200
We used to get together and do a
little vocal. What you gonna sing?

148
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,028
What's your range? From what key to what
key? If you know what's range and vocal and...

149
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:48,250
...what key to add in, then we wail right on
through, see? And everything will be scrusimanstrosi.

150
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:50,371
- Alright?
- Okay

151
00:10:58,154 --> 00:11:02,294
Yeah, nice sound. That's tough
there, you got nice pipes there.

152
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,395
You up in moonville there.

153
00:11:20,252 --> 00:11:24,756
No, no. That's just your first note.
Now, when you wheel in to the melody...

154
00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:29,150
Just relax and sing on out. Now you try that
first note and come right into it and continue.

155
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,344
Let's get together and
swing right on through. Okay?

156
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:38,994
- No hello, huh?
- Hello, Ben.

157
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:42,000
What you think of her?

158
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:44,000
Uh huh.

159
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,999
- What did you think Benny?
- Well...

160
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,581
Fellas, what did you folks think?

161
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:53,260
- Oh, she's marvelous. See? See?
What are you worried about honey?

162
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,400
Come over here baby. Excuse
me a second, will you?

163
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,263
What did I think?

164
00:13:09,298 --> 00:13:11,298
I don't think you made it, sweetie baby.

165
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:15,000
You know, it's not
enough to look pretty.

166
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,086
I mean let's face it,
honey. You were embarrasing.

167
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,719
They were laughing at ya'.

168
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:24,252
When someone asks you to sing,
you gotta get up there and sing.

169
00:13:25,406 --> 00:13:28,499
Benny, I didn't even know that number.

170
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,472
Look, I'm not talking about the number.

171
00:13:32,856 --> 00:13:36,524
I'm talking about your need for experience. We
all know you're pretty, we all know you got talent.

172
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:39,421
But honey, you need more experience
and that just finishes it.

173
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,507
Hi.

174
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
- I thought you were just great.
- Ghost.

175
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:51,031
I'm talking about criticism,
you know? Constructive criticism.

176
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,300
Uh, Jess.

177
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:00,748
That's why I'm a good agent, I
never let a client off the hook.

178
00:14:00,836 --> 00:14:04,250
Expect the best, keep them insecure,
that's what you'll get man, the best.

179
00:14:05,518 --> 00:14:07,921
Forget about the girl. How
are ya, ya old son of gun?

180
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,019
I'm pretty good, and you?

181
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:14,616
Uh, great. Listen, you uh... still
uh... playing in the parks and uh, ugh...

182
00:14:14,947 --> 00:14:18,550
- Old ladies homes, and jazz like that?
- I like parks, and I like old ladies.

183
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:20,579
Why don't you come on back and
get a little night club pellet.

184
00:14:20,644 --> 00:14:22,666
We're happy doing what we're
doing, Benny. What's wrong with it?

185
00:14:22,865 --> 00:14:24,700
So you cut a record.

186
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,650
Come on you artist, I love you. Let
an old friend help and old friend.

187
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:31,200
What would an old friend like you,
do with a bunch of screwballs like us?

188
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:33,900
Make money.

189
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,275
- You turn me up.

190
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,350
You don't wanna work in nightclubs, cut
a couple of records, make a little loot.

191
00:14:38,356 --> 00:14:39,528
What's wrong with that?

192
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:42,584
Nothing Benny, nothing at all. Provided
you let us play what we want to play.

193
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:45,300
Of course you can play what you
want to play. What do you think I am?

194
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,087
- Ugly chick.
- I thought she was cute man, what do you mean?

195
00:14:48,183 --> 00:14:50,183
You've got no taste, man. You know that?

196
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,252
- This party is a real drag.
- Bunch of freaks.

197
00:14:53,953 --> 00:14:56,866
- Where's Ghost?
- Busy with an agent somewhere over here.

198
00:14:56,948 --> 00:14:59,999
- Hey let's go over to Nick's place and play some cards.
- No man, I promised my wife...

199
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:02,529
Excuse me, honey. And
I am gonna go home.

200
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:07,600
Oh well, where's Red? Hey Red!
- That's what I mean, you can never get out of these places.

201
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:16,550
Hey waiter, waiter!

202
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,161
Listen, why don't you give me a call sometime?
Maybe I can set up and audition for you boys.

203
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,541
- Great.
- You know, you're a nice kid, I like you.

204
00:15:24,788 --> 00:15:28,211
- I like you, I like the way you talk.
- Geez, thanks a lot mister Frielobe.

205
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:31,280
- That's alright.
- Nice meeting you, nice meeting you, uh, Mrs. Frielobe.

206
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,331
Come on Red. Come on. Wait a minute.

207
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:35,500
Wait a minute. Do you know who
I was just talking to of all?

208
00:15:35,596 --> 00:15:38,200
- A phony.
- Hell, everybodys a phony to you Charlie.

209
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:39,400
- That's right.
- Go ahead.

210
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,835
That guy's Milt Frielobe,
he owns Roadside.

211
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:43,200
- Yeah, yeah.
- Who cares, man.

212
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:58,807
Oh... listen Jess, you look beautiful.

213
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,150
Oh, I want you to meet an
old dear friend of mine:

214
00:16:03,185 --> 00:16:05,459
John "Ghost" Wakefield, Jess Polanski.

215
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,622
- How are ya?
- Come on, lets go down and get a drink. I'm dry. What do you say?

216
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:12,733
- Yeah, uh, Benny, easy easy.
- I'm surprised to see you here tonight.

217
00:16:12,746 --> 00:16:16,000
I didn't think you made
this party scene very often.

218
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:36,200
Yeah well, I know, you know, Baby
Jackson a long time and he said uh:

219
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,150
You wanna come to a party so here I am.

220
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm handling him now, so I got
him book solid. Right on top.

221
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:40,900
Is that right?

222
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:44,185
See, is that where you want to
be Ms. Polanski? On... on top?

223
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,803
I'm an amateur. I don't try
to fool myself or other people.

224
00:16:51,726 --> 00:16:52,669
I... I can see that.

225
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,460
But what I said before,
I wasn't kidding about.

226
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:56,479
- You are good.
- Uh, bartender, give us three glasses of

227
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,535
- champagne, make sure the
glasses are cold, alright?

228
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,539
- And I'm not putting you on either.
- I hate bartenders.

229
00:17:00,574 --> 00:17:03,411
You know how long it's been since I've seen this
son of a gun? How long has it been anyway, huh?

230
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:05,767
- A long time Benny.
- Yeah, couple of years at least.

231
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,200
You know I was a musician then.

232
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,600
Yeah, well, no more Tijuanas, Cincinnatis,
Philadelphias, or one night hassles with drunks

233
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,914
...in third rate bars for me. No sir,
woke up one morning and had a hangover...

234
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,335
...and had a fight, hit some guy, broke my fist, he
cut my lip, and I haven't touched a trumpet since.

235
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,000
Have a nice time?

236
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:25,641
- Hey Benny.
- Hey Baby.

237
00:17:25,691 --> 00:17:28,606
- Hey Benny. I want you to
talk to somebody over here.

238
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,274
- Not now Baby, I'm busy.
- What do you mean 'not now'?

239
00:17:32,962 --> 00:17:37,851
Look, you are my agent... This guy says
he got a contract for me for next summer.

240
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:42,098
Now, I never sign no contract with him,
and that is exactly what I told him.

241
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,802
Don't worry about it, I know what he
means. You know it's in the talk stage.

242
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,588
Ah, well then maybe you better get over here
and talk man because that is exactly what I...

243
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,350
...give you ten percent for. Now you
don't mind, do you sweetie? Come on Benny.

244
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:56,673
- Benny, I want to leave.
- Uh, well, be back in a minute honey, this is business.

245
00:17:56,763 --> 00:17:58,463
I want you to tell this
little girl some stories.

246
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:02,609
He's got wonderful stories, sweetie.
Like Mother Goose and Peter Pan.

247
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:04,720
- Let's go Benny.
- Later Baby.

248
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:14,150
You want another drink?

249
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:37,665
Would you do me a favor?

250
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,500
Sure.

251
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:43,389
Where do you wanna go?

252
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:46,592
Anywhere. I don't care.

253
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,800
Come on.

254
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:04,220
Exactly what do you mean in a minute?

255
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:06,551
- I said, in a minute.
- Just listen, who do you think you...

256
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:08,299
Shut up and let me boy.

257
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:19,650
Eleven, twelve, thirteen,
five is eighteen, nineteen.

258
00:19:19,697 --> 00:19:21,697
Twenty-six,
thirty-one, forty-two.

259
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,824
- What do you say, Ghost?
- How are you?

260
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:27,541
Say hello to the princess.
Princess, uh, meet Reno uh...

261
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,083
Vitelli, Vitelli. Please
to meet you, princess.

262
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,000
That's enough. We'll
be at the back table.

263
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:35,062
- Sure, go ahead. Enjoy yourselves.
- We will.

264
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,240
- Here good?
- Yeah, this is fine.

265
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,307
- What kind of a place is this?
- You know, regular neighborhood bar.

266
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,447
Where uh... working
people come after hours.

267
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,435
Kill some time.

268
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,062
A lot of lonely people
in the world, you know?

269
00:20:05,448 --> 00:20:07,150
You want something to eat?

270
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:09,400
No thanks. I don't feel
like eating, anything.

271
00:20:10,463 --> 00:20:12,510
Kitchen's clean. You
can eat off the floor.

272
00:20:13,481 --> 00:20:15,100
I'm not very hungry.

273
00:20:16,202 --> 00:20:18,000
Hey, I love that dress.

274
00:20:19,922 --> 00:20:21,922
It's just cheap.

275
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,800
Well, maybe it's cheap,
but you make it look good.

276
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,810
- I know.
- You know, huh?

277
00:20:29,668 --> 00:20:33,119
- You really are a princess.
- My name is Polanski.

278
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:37,136
That's my name: Jessica Polanski.

279
00:20:37,796 --> 00:20:39,796
And don't start telling me
how much you can do for me.

280
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,650
Helping my career... Cause
there isn't any career.

281
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:46,308
And you can't do a
thing for me. Understand?

282
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,000
You wanna dance?

283
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:54,108
I guess... yeah.

284
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,000
Okay.

285
00:21:11,324 --> 00:21:12,824
Okay, one more.

286
00:21:12,848 --> 00:21:14,292
Ooh, I like that.

287
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:23,000
Shall we?

288
00:21:50,752 --> 00:21:52,200
You like to dance?

289
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:55,161
Does any man like to dance?

290
00:21:57,078 --> 00:22:00,168
Hey, I bet that's the first exercise
you had in a couple of years, Ghost.

291
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,200
Thank you. Thank you very much loudmouth. I'm
having enough problems keeping time with the music.

292
00:22:04,516 --> 00:22:06,516
No, no. You kids look good. Real good.

293
00:22:07,072 --> 00:22:09,781
Appreciate it. He used to be an
instructor for Arthur Murray, you know?

294
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:13,900
Very funny, very funny.
Hey, hey, you guys thirsty?

295
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:17,500
Wanna drink?

296
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,420
- Yeah, sure.
- Yes, I will take up on a drink, sir.

297
00:22:23,772 --> 00:22:25,100
So how the boys?

298
00:22:25,461 --> 00:22:27,400
- Pretty good, pretty good.
- They working?

299
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,328
Well, we're gonna have a swinging day at the
park tomorrow, playing for a lot of trees.

300
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:35,100
What a life. You know, you can have
it. What do you wanna drink, princess?

301
00:22:35,408 --> 00:22:37,108
Hey, wait a minute. Don't say nothing.

302
00:22:37,644 --> 00:22:39,644
She doesn't know I can fix
drinks. Step aside, young man.

303
00:22:39,812 --> 00:22:41,812
- He could've taken over me.
- Step aside.

304
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:44,500
Let me have some vodka.

305
00:22:45,202 --> 00:22:46,550
- Vodka?
- Yeah.

306
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,000
Good.

307
00:22:48,152 --> 00:22:50,152
Some Irish wiskey.

308
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:57,182
- Evil got to Savannah is at work.
- Yeah, how did you get involved with this cook?

309
00:22:57,387 --> 00:22:59,387
Cognac... Yeah, that's good.

310
00:23:01,612 --> 00:23:03,450
Not too much, I don't want to spoil it.

311
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,520
He's always got some crazy drink.

312
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:08,999
Well listen, the me drinking is a luxury.
It's as simple as that. Now you can waste it...

313
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,992
...on something ordinary or you
can... you can dream a little.

314
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:15,000
I don't want any of that.

315
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:17,843
I've been nothing but nice to you lady. I
don't think I deserve that kind of treatment.

316
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,430
You got some maraschino
cherries, please?

317
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,370
- What do you want? My job?
- No, no, no. A cherry. That's good.

318
00:23:24,293 --> 00:23:27,423
Two. That's gonna make it look pretty,
those cherries. Make it look nice.

319
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,545
Some cream meant for a little coloring.

320
00:23:31,135 --> 00:23:34,466
- Watch this one.
- Hey princess...

321
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:36,983
Now we mix.

322
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:42,300
Hey if the whole place explodes
you're gonna pay for it.

323
00:23:42,452 --> 00:23:44,452
Hey's a cook, ain't he princess?

324
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,333
Three chill glasses if you please.

325
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:55,200
You can have two... thanks
a lot, but no thanks.

326
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:57,999
- You're a coward. Hey, coward!
- That's right.

327
00:23:58,391 --> 00:24:00,000
Jess honey.

328
00:24:00,797 --> 00:24:02,444
I'm a coward too.

329
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:05,460
Very well... I'll... drink alone.

330
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Boy oh boy.

331
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:25,638
A little rough going
town. But it's good.

332
00:24:26,115 --> 00:24:27,800
Yeah.

333
00:24:28,124 --> 00:24:30,200
Try it honey. I wouldn't
let anything hurt you.

334
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh, here goes nothing.

335
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,040
- It is good.
- Yeah?

336
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:42,447
Yeah.

337
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:45,879
- See, what did I tell you?
- Tastes just like créme de menthe.

338
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,982
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you should try it.

339
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:50,032
- See that?
- Alright, alright, I'll try anything once.

340
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:52,200
- Go ahead sport.
- It tastes like créme de menthe.

341
00:24:52,216 --> 00:24:53,687
- Yeah?
- Marvelous.

342
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,451
I have a toast. Hold it. I have a toast.

343
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:02,000
A toast to all the cowards in the
world who never mix their drinks...

344
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,300
...may they one day wake up, and
find out there's a crazy mix up world.

345
00:25:05,524 --> 00:25:07,524
- Great.
- I made that up myself.

346
00:25:09,393 --> 00:25:11,393
- Hey, hey. I got one. A toast.
- Yeah?

347
00:25:11,521 --> 00:25:15,087
Here's to the girl who lives on the
hill, she won't... what's the matter?

348
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:17,550
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry princess,
that's not for ladies.

349
00:25:17,871 --> 00:25:19,871
That's right. Let's drink to
a sense of propriety anyway.

350
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:22,157
Hey, that's a good
one. I'll drink to that.

351
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,665
- More, more nectar for the gods.

352
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:28,716
I'm gonna get stiff on
that créme de menthe...

353
00:25:28,814 --> 00:25:30,814
It's getting me all sloppy

354
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,568
- Here, here, here.
- Hit me again, too, you know.

355
00:25:35,697 --> 00:25:37,000
- Jess?

356
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:42,352
Alright, here's to a man I know who plays
music in the city parks for trees and birds.

357
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:44,000
I wonder who she meant by that.

358
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:48,407
Hey, hey, hey. Here's to people, and
drinking, and wives who keep their husbands...

359
00:25:48,928 --> 00:25:50,475
...in the streets!

360
00:25:53,364 --> 00:25:57,000
I got one. I drink to a girl,
with a voice like an angel.

361
00:25:58,018 --> 00:26:03,100
Well... here's to this drink anyway,
cause it... it makes men say pretty words.

362
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:07,200
Alright, alright, alright. Here's to me.

363
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:11,100
Hey, Reno. This man
wants to pay my bill.

364
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,100
Good luck.

365
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:21,100
Champagne will cost
you three bucks a split.

366
00:26:30,143 --> 00:26:32,000
Let's get outta here.

367
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,100
- Goodnight, Sheryl.
- Goodnight.

368
00:26:34,203 --> 00:26:36,203
- What a dump.
- Oh, I never come in here.

369
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:40,800
You never come in here? Hey Shorty, you
listen to me. You better never come...

370
00:26:40,943 --> 00:26:42,943
...in here again! You here me?

371
00:26:43,221 --> 00:26:45,500
How do you like that broad?
She never comes in here.

372
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,700
No, she never comes in here just Mondays,
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and...

373
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,234
...and Fridays and Saturdays. She
better never come in here again cause...

374
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:53,500
...from now on, she barred in this bar!

375
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:57,350
- She was just embarrased.
- Relax. What kinda hot temper is that?

376
00:26:57,458 --> 00:27:00,681
Well if she don't wanna come in here,
she don't have to come in here, you know?

377
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,000
That's true. Hey, lets drink to
bar tenders and their troubles.

378
00:27:04,108 --> 00:27:08,200
No, no, no, no. Let's drink to dames, they
just wise up that money ain't everything.

379
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:13,589
- I got no more drink, honey.
- Wait a minute, I'll fix...

380
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:15,817
No, no, no. You go ahead. I'll do it.

381
00:27:16,082 --> 00:27:18,900
You try to take a turn around
that South American stuff.

382
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,150
I gotta cool off anyway.
- You know how to do that?

383
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:23,425
I know how to do it, I'm
a bar tender, ain't I?

384
00:27:23,426 --> 00:27:24,667
Forgot, yeah.

385
00:27:40,997 --> 00:27:42,600
I cannot make that.

386
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,942
Sure you can.

387
00:27:45,995 --> 00:27:47,650
It's easy.

388
00:27:51,366 --> 00:27:53,366
You sure move beautifully.

389
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,373
Never mind that.

390
00:27:56,543 --> 00:27:59,300
Come on. Try it. Come on.

391
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:03,130
- Okay. - It's just one-two,
one-two-three. That's all.

392
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,350
How am I doing, teach?

393
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:14,395
I never mind about the
music... Just, come here.

394
00:28:21,471 --> 00:28:23,471
But, keep the rhythm, huh?

395
00:28:25,182 --> 00:28:27,182
- Okay?
- Okay.

396
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,200
You won't let me fall.

397
00:28:48,213 --> 00:28:54,000
I wanted you to fall, cause you can
lean on me any old time, Princess.

398
00:28:55,656 --> 00:28:58,723
That's because you're late
all the time. That's why.

399
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:05,991
Did you know that
(slurred words) Strange?

400
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:09,033
I didn't know that. But it's a
pleasure to make your aquaintance.

401
00:29:12,724 --> 00:29:14,724
Did I ever tell you about the...

402
00:29:16,314 --> 00:29:18,314
- For what?
- Anyhow, he takes this girl.

403
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:21,853
And he opens the door.

404
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:24,323
And he, hands her the key.

405
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:28,304
And he says... goodnight.

406
00:29:29,192 --> 00:29:31,000
- Goodnight?
- Doesn't go like this.

407
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,999
Don't turn it on.

408
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,780
Your lips are soft.

409
00:29:50,135 --> 00:29:52,350
Come on. Come on.

410
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,250
Come on with me.

411
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,391
Come on.

412
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:05,681
Come on.

413
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,999
Now just sit right over here. Sit down.

414
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,159
I'll be ready for you in just a minute.

415
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:26,610
I gotta go make myself look
pretty for you, don't I?

416
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:40,316
So you just... make
yourself comfortable.

417
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:47,257
And a... smoke a cigarette or something.

418
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:51,600
I won't be long.

419
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,508
You won't be sorry.

420
00:30:58,771 --> 00:31:00,771
Cause I'll make you happy.

421
00:31:04,055 --> 00:31:05,720
I like you.

422
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:47,500
Don't I smell good?

423
00:31:47,877 --> 00:31:49,049
You smell great.

424
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:53,923
- Oh, what's the matter?
- Just, stay there, will ya?

425
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Just, right there.

426
00:31:56,069 --> 00:31:58,526
I don't appeal to you?
I'm not your type? Huh?

427
00:32:00,688 --> 00:32:02,250
Yeah, you are my type.

428
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:08,676
Then... don't you want me?

429
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,088
I don't understand.

430
00:32:15,741 --> 00:32:17,741
I didn't even have a chance with you.

431
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:21,220
I mean, how do you know
you wouldn't like me, huh?

432
00:32:21,448 --> 00:32:23,650
It has nothing to do with
whether I would like you, or not.

433
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:27,689
Who ever told you that's what you
had to do in order to reach somebody.

434
00:32:29,524 --> 00:32:31,524
Are you kidding?

435
00:32:31,884 --> 00:32:34,300
Just where do I stand
without my body, huh?

436
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,720
Tell me that... I'm the girl with
no mind, or haven't you heard?

437
00:32:41,308 --> 00:32:44,197
What good is talking to somebody
when nobody listens to you, huh?

438
00:32:44,757 --> 00:32:47,136
What good is falling for somebody
when they don't come back?

439
00:32:47,923 --> 00:32:53,523
If I let you go tonight, I'd never
see you again. And you know it.

440
00:32:53,766 --> 00:32:57,766
And you think that the bomb is gonna drop
and everything inside will be out and...

441
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,963
...everything down will be up.

442
00:33:02,735 --> 00:33:06,026
I don't think... it's too painful.

443
00:33:06,211 --> 00:33:08,211
It's too late for this
kind of stuff anyway.

444
00:33:08,742 --> 00:33:13,078
Okay... then tell me what you
want, and I'll make it happen.

445
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,500
Tell me what you want.

446
00:33:15,652 --> 00:33:17,301
Just like magic, it's gonna happen.

447
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:23,182
To live... just to live, that's all.

448
00:33:24,174 --> 00:33:29,400
Where? Cleveland? New York? Paris?

449
00:33:33,688 --> 00:33:34,905
How about the moon?

450
00:33:36,392 --> 00:33:38,392
I just don't believe in fairy tales.

451
00:33:38,945 --> 00:33:40,500
You will.

452
00:33:40,713 --> 00:33:42,713
I promise you will.

453
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:48,600
I'll see you tomorrow afternoon,
about uh... two o'clock.

454
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,065
Don't do nothing with the day here.

455
00:33:56,298 --> 00:33:57,600
- You leaving?

456
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,276
Two o'clock.

457
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:39,592
Oh man, this is for the birds.

458
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:42,862
Come on Charlie, stop
talking to the customers.

459
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,500
Man, you reach for a high
one, and for what? For nobody.

460
00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:47,402
I like to Charlie.

461
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,999
Yeah maybe we'd all like it Charlie,
if you tried playing it a while.

462
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:52,335
Why don't you stop
complaining Charlie, huh?

463
00:34:52,543 --> 00:34:57,921
Yeah, sure. Why complain. Fresh air, sunshine.
Exactly what we had in mind when we joined the union.

464
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:02,644
It's for the birds. The charity bits,
fine. At least we get an audience. But this?

465
00:35:03,515 --> 00:35:07,721
- We're getting paid man.
- Scale. They pay more to playground supervisors.

466
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:09,365
Then learn how to play basketball.

467
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:13,726
We usually play much better.

468
00:35:16,077 --> 00:35:17,555
What is it with you guys anyway?

469
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:20,980
- Just tired.
- Tired of playing the trees, that's all.

470
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:24,366
Now if I play the tuba and Shelly a
bass drum, we'd have a crowd in no time.

471
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:29,100
Tube and a bass drum...
You deserve each other.

472
00:35:38,523 --> 00:35:40,523
Came on the perfect day, sweetheart.

473
00:35:56,048 --> 00:35:58,900
You know, I never saw anybody look
so good in the sunlight before.

474
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:01,743
I never got in the sunlight before.

475
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:04,600
No, I mean it.

476
00:36:07,222 --> 00:36:09,222
Come on Pete, give a
hand here. Will you?

477
00:36:10,491 --> 00:36:11,233
Pete!

478
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,282
Take your time guys.

479
00:36:19,785 --> 00:36:22,500
Goodbye park. You're
strictly for the birds.

480
00:36:22,904 --> 00:36:24,904
- Goodbye park.
- So long squirrels.

481
00:36:25,324 --> 00:36:27,257
Hey you guys, what's the score.

482
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:30,685
Hey you guys, come on
over and play some ball.

483
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,450
Brind the blonde over, she can umpire.

484
00:36:32,601 --> 00:36:34,601
- Hey, you wanna play some ball?
- With them?

485
00:36:34,663 --> 00:36:38,000
What are you
- what are you crazy? We're too old for that kind of nonsense.

486
00:36:38,024 --> 00:36:40,024
You wanna have a hear
attack or something?

487
00:36:43,398 --> 00:36:44,679
Hey, these kids are pretty good.

488
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,600
- We only have five guys.
- What are you out of your head or what?

489
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:49,800
That's enough. Come on man, lets go.

490
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:53,200
- Alright, we'll play you. Come on let's play.
- They wanna play, we'll play.

491
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,700
You feel athletic?

492
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,000
- No, but you go ahead.
- Sure?

493
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:01,121
- Sure.
- Okay.

494
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:03,283
- Come on guys, let's go.
- I got third base.

495
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:06,100
- Toss me a glove will ya?

496
00:37:09,765 --> 00:37:11,100
Hey Red, you run like a gazelle.

497
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,200
Let me see the ball Red.

498
00:37:14,256 --> 00:37:15,239
Over here.

499
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,180
I got it. I got it.

500
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:21,819
Oh, I had it. Alright here.

501
00:37:28,817 --> 00:37:30,817
This fly in your eyeball.

502
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,886
Come on, you can't even
get it up in the plate.

503
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:40,069
- What's that?
- You can't even get it up here.

504
00:37:43,896 --> 00:37:45,631
I'll put it right in your earlobe.

505
00:37:57,828 --> 00:37:59,200
I'm safe.

506
00:38:01,306 --> 00:38:02,400
I'm safe too.

507
00:38:02,468 --> 00:38:04,000
That's good, isn't it?

508
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,124
Yeah, very good.

509
00:38:15,174 --> 00:38:18,550
- Come on Ghost. Come on, come on.
- Come on Ghost. I've gone!

510
00:38:18,832 --> 00:38:21,000
I'll take care of this
one, over the fence.

511
00:38:23,873 --> 00:38:26,850
Come on Ghost, come on. Bring
me home baby. Watch that pitch.

512
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:31,263
Alright, one out you
guys. Now let's tighten up.

513
00:38:32,032 --> 00:38:33,050
Next time.

514
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,000
Hey honey, come on. You play.

515
00:38:36,008 --> 00:38:38,900
- Come on, you can't do worse than I did.
- She don't want to play man...

516
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,300
...Just let me take a bat once.

517
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:42,208
Wait a minute, old time, beauty
before trumpet players. Come on.

518
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,559
- Ghost, how can you let a girl bat before me.
- Come on honey.

519
00:38:46,752 --> 00:38:47,768
Hey Ghost!

520
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,300
She's batting next. Hey she's playing!

521
00:38:50,301 --> 00:38:53,462
- She's playing for you. What a bunch of sissies.
- Bunch of sissies, she'll bat it out of the park.

522
00:38:53,888 --> 00:38:55,380
Here sweetheart, hit it.

523
00:38:55,622 --> 00:38:57,337
Come on Princess, let's go. Come on.

524
00:38:57,553 --> 00:38:59,000
Alright, come on Princess.

525
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,045
Come on baby, check it in
there. Check it in there.

526
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,463
- Knock it out of the park, honey.
- Oh, beautiful.

527
00:39:04,677 --> 00:39:08,250
- Run, run, run, run.
- Foul ball, foul ball.

528
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,680
Keep going, keep going.

529
00:39:15,327 --> 00:39:17,327
- Here we go!
- Look out.

530
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:21,850
What's he getting so excited
for man, it was a foul ball.

531
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,000
So what, it's only a game.

532
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,300
Come on, let's go home.

533
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,700
- Did you see it?
- Sure.

534
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:52,819
I had the bat... and I hit and...
and I never hit a ball before.

535
00:40:06,061 --> 00:40:07,881
Come her slugger.

536
00:40:30,548 --> 00:40:31,815
What's the matter?

537
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,100
Wait a minute.

538
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:41,934
Well uh...

539
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:44,200
- Hello Benny.
- Hi listen...

540
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:46,500
- Honey, it's Benny.
- I'm sorry. I uh...

541
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:49,450
I was looking for you Ghost, wanted to tell
you you got an audition tomorrow for the group.

542
00:40:49,637 --> 00:40:51,637
Goldstar Records. Four o'clock.

543
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:53,829
I'm sorry, this is kind of embarrasing.

544
00:40:55,093 --> 00:40:57,093
You're a funny little guy, anyhow.

545
00:40:58,259 --> 00:41:01,385
Yeah, well, uh... Hello Jess, I didn't
mean to scare you, just looking for Ghost.

546
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:06,900
You wanna drink Benny? We can
fix him a drink can't we, baby?

547
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,550
Oh, by the way Jess, I... gee I'd like to
do something about getting you some work.

548
00:41:12,143 --> 00:41:14,900
I know you're probably short on
cash and need money for the rent.

549
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:19,000
I'd like to get you something somewhere,
but, well when you walked out on me...

550
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,625
...last night I was about to introduce
you to some people, at that party.

551
00:41:21,672 --> 00:41:23,999
Uh, Benny, you don't have
to worry about Jess anymore.

552
00:41:25,338 --> 00:41:27,338
My baby is gonna sing with the group.

553
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,475
Let's not lose our heads, I mean.
I know Jess needs money, but uh...

554
00:41:34,073 --> 00:41:36,800
Well your group's instrumental.
She's just starting out.

555
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:39,600
You don't have to worry
about Jess anymore Benny.

556
00:41:40,312 --> 00:41:42,234
Okay. Whatever you say I guess.

557
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:44,559
Well, see you tomorrow. Four o'clock.

558
00:41:45,298 --> 00:41:47,000
Do you know where the place is?

559
00:41:47,493 --> 00:41:48,846
I'll find it.

560
00:41:53,273 --> 00:41:56,050
- Okay. Goodnight.
- Goodnight Benny.

561
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:01,619
Hope I didn't embarras you.

562
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,000
He's a fun little guy, isn't he honey?

563
00:42:10,826 --> 00:42:12,138
Yeah, he's funny.

564
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:15,000
He's a scream.

565
00:42:18,725 --> 00:42:20,839
I know something's wrong. What is it?

566
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
What do you mean 'something's wrong?

567
00:42:26,149 --> 00:42:28,000
You know what's bothering me.

568
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,799
I've been around Ghost. Even with Benny.

569
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,000
- Oh.
- Oh? Yeah.

570
00:42:35,148 --> 00:42:37,148
It does make a difference, doesn't it?

571
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,600
Not to me, it doesn't.

572
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:48,120
I don't know if I could be in love with you
cause I don't know if I know what love is.

573
00:42:51,078 --> 00:42:53,078
Then don't worry about what it is.

574
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:56,900
And don't worry about Benny, and don't
worry about rent, or recording, or...

575
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,000
...me, or tomorrow, or nothing.

576
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,835
Alright, kill it.

577
00:43:40,265 --> 00:43:42,696
Alright, kill it. Come on, knock it off.

578
00:43:46,405 --> 00:43:48,100
What a bunch of bananas.

579
00:43:48,191 --> 00:43:50,191
I don't like the number Mr. Wakefield.

580
00:43:50,706 --> 00:43:53,650
Well mister, you paid for what
we like to play. That's our deal.

581
00:43:56,431 --> 00:43:58,206
That's not my deal, kid.

582
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:00,239
- Is not?
- I don't like it.

583
00:44:00,526 --> 00:44:02,287
Hey agent, is he telling the truth?

584
00:44:03,001 --> 00:44:04,856
Let me take care of it Ghost.

585
00:44:04,883 --> 00:44:06,883
Look, maybe the best thing
is to forget the whole thing.

586
00:44:06,971 --> 00:44:08,162
- No, no, no.
- Maybe some other time.

587
00:44:08,304 --> 00:44:10,304
No, no. You just push him.
You'll get what you want.

588
00:44:10,586 --> 00:44:12,586
Hey Benny...

589
00:44:14,061 --> 00:44:17,061
- Man, you dig this?
- Another perfect day.

590
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:20,700
- It was all my fault.
- No, don't be stupid honey. You were great.

591
00:44:21,204 --> 00:44:23,000
Hey listen, why don't
we play something else?

592
00:44:23,122 --> 00:44:25,122
Sax raise its ugly head.
It's just as good a number.

593
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:30,600
- Same tune. I'm a' ram my fist up his mouth.
- Oh man, oh blew it.

594
00:44:30,846 --> 00:44:32,117
Whatever that means.

595
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:34,939
Ghost, you wait outside. Do you mind?

596
00:44:35,017 --> 00:44:36,700
Don't you tell me what to do Benny.

597
00:44:36,804 --> 00:44:38,999
Benny when you tell me something
I gotta take it for a fact.

598
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:41,019
Now you told me this man wouldn't
tell me how to play my music.

599
00:44:41,218 --> 00:44:43,000
He'd just, listen to it.

600
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:45,246
He's an idealist, Milt.

601
00:44:45,465 --> 00:44:49,024
But that's the world, kid. That's the
way it goes. I hate commercialism too.

602
00:44:49,217 --> 00:44:52,337
Don't blame the poor sound engineer.
Blame the world, blame the people.

603
00:44:54,904 --> 00:44:56,650
Turn up that level, will you Georgie.

604
00:44:57,291 --> 00:44:59,291
See? It's beginning to sound good.

605
00:45:01,321 --> 00:45:03,800
Now that's good. That's good.
I like that. Who wrote that?

606
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:05,400
I did.

607
00:45:06,149 --> 00:45:09,610
It's the same number you heard a
minute ago... that you didn't like.

608
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:11,775
But I think I like it now.

609
00:45:13,136 --> 00:45:14,700
That girl's good.

610
00:45:14,908 --> 00:45:18,818
I like that uh... what are you laughing
at? I like that uh no singing singing.

611
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,850
What do you think, Georgie?

612
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,919
I told you before. It's a lousy room.

613
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:28,596
You're a musician too, aren't you? Get in
there, let's here with the whole outfit, huh?

614
00:45:31,951 --> 00:45:33,245
Okay.

615
00:45:33,927 --> 00:45:37,094
- We don't make any stops this time.
- Sure kid, anything you say.

616
00:45:37,784 --> 00:45:38,887
You know it.

617
00:46:06,803 --> 00:46:08,138
What you say the leader's name is?

618
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,520
- He calls himself Ghost.
- Ghost, huh?

619
00:46:13,173 --> 00:46:16,704
The Ghost! The Ghosts,
how's that for a group, huh?

620
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:19,042
The kids will buy it.
It'll attract the kids.

621
00:46:19,293 --> 00:46:21,172
That's the market you
have to sell to nowadays.

622
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,180
- How does it feel, Georgie?
- It's a lousy room! I told you that, didn't I?

623
00:46:27,192 --> 00:46:29,400
- But how's it feel?
- Passible.

624
00:46:29,807 --> 00:46:31,088
Passible, passible.

625
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,050
Princess, you were just wonderful.

626
00:46:49,865 --> 00:46:51,400
If you don't mind Charlie, it's my girl.

627
00:46:51,421 --> 00:46:53,000
Boy, you getting fast.

628
00:46:53,502 --> 00:46:55,100
Honey, you were just beautiful.

629
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,000
Ghost, you're a coup
baby. But I love you.

630
00:46:58,192 --> 00:46:59,965
Come off it, will ya?

631
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,750
You have a great voice, Princess.

632
00:47:07,495 --> 00:47:10,550
I love that style of yours, that
uh... No singing singing, you know?

633
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,400
Kid, I think it's gonna
sell a million copies.

634
00:47:12,677 --> 00:47:15,000
- Pete, you were beautiful. Man that was a...
- I know it.

635
00:47:15,001 --> 00:47:16,115
Thank you Mr. Friedlobe.

636
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,210
Benny come on, let's talk business. You want
in on this? Or you wanna handle it yourself?

637
00:47:19,306 --> 00:47:21,150
Agent, why don't you
take care of it, alright?

638
00:47:21,322 --> 00:47:23,000
He trusts you! He trusts you!

639
00:47:23,076 --> 00:47:26,000
- Hey Mr. Friedlobe, we thank you very much.
- Oh thank you kid. Thank you again.

640
00:47:26,058 --> 00:47:28,058
- Oh darling, you were just beautiful.
- Huh?

641
00:47:28,538 --> 00:47:30,538
- Where are you gonna be later?
- Oh, I don't know, around and about.

642
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,156
Why don't you give us a call at Nick
the Greek's. And if we're not there...

643
00:47:33,276 --> 00:47:36,200
...we'll be at my place. And if we're
not there, you can call us somewhere.

644
00:47:37,677 --> 00:47:39,677
Thanks a lot Mr.
Friedlobe. How's the misses?

645
00:47:39,769 --> 00:47:42,600
- You don't remember me, do you?
- No I uh...

646
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,900
He said you were a great guy but I didn't
believe him. But you're just a great guy.

647
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:49,090
Hey Nick! Congratulate us, we made it.

648
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:52,250
Nick, I got some wine man. I'm
gonna buy you a new tie, Nick.

649
00:47:53,082 --> 00:47:54,345
Close up shop, we're gonna celebrate.

650
00:47:54,643 --> 00:47:56,643
What do you mean, 'close up shop' huh?

651
00:47:56,884 --> 00:47:58,999
This is a business
proper, a business place.

652
00:48:00,657 --> 00:48:02,250
We're gonna have a party Nick!

653
00:48:03,105 --> 00:48:05,000
Will you let me down!

654
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,000
- What's the matter with you guys?
- Nick, Nick. Take it...

655
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,012
What did I tell you? This is a
business place. This is a circus.

656
00:48:11,782 --> 00:48:13,782
Hold it, Nick. Hold it, will ya?

657
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,450
I want you to meet somebody.

658
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,380
Princess, say hello to Nick the Greek.

659
00:48:17,525 --> 00:48:20,525
Bobolenos. Nick Bobolenos.
I'm very happy to know you.

660
00:48:21,308 --> 00:48:23,308
Please excuse our off
language. The boys, you know.

661
00:48:23,865 --> 00:48:25,865
Isn't he sweet? Isn't he sweet?

662
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:28,645
What is your name?

663
00:48:29,252 --> 00:48:32,100
It's Jess... uh, Princess Polanski.

664
00:48:32,605 --> 00:48:36,200
Polanski? That's great you know?
Your name is long just like mine.

665
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:40,989
Come on, a game of cards. A game of loser
weepers. Let's play the game, come on.

666
00:48:41,999 --> 00:48:44,848
- I'll play some music.
- I get the chips.

667
00:48:46,813 --> 00:48:48,200
- You wanna play?
- No, I'll stay out.

668
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,700
- You don't mind honey?
- She don't.

669
00:48:49,743 --> 00:48:51,241
- Of course not.
- Excuse, oh I'm sorry.

670
00:48:51,273 --> 00:48:53,999
You know, Charlie is a great dancer,
let him teach you the mambo, you know?

671
00:48:54,117 --> 00:48:56,240
No, not on your life. This is
a plot to make me lose the girl.

672
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,000
Don't go away. Charlie
stay right where you are.

673
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:01,064
Hey you guys... excuse me, go ahead.

674
00:49:02,004 --> 00:49:04,780
I didn't mean to interrupt, but you guys
wanna join the party, you're welcome.

675
00:49:04,824 --> 00:49:06,824
You don't mind if we
finish the game, do you?

676
00:49:06,886 --> 00:49:09,300
No, I don't really care what you
do. But the wine's on the table.

677
00:49:09,443 --> 00:49:11,000
It's up to you.

678
00:49:12,874 --> 00:49:15,350
Charlie cha-cha would you mind
taking a seat at the poker table?

679
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,480
Play a little cards will you?
You can even use my chips.

680
00:49:19,311 --> 00:49:23,148
Would you cut it? Would you get out...
He's a nut, he'll dance with anybody.

681
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:30,560
- Hi.
- Alright, hold it sweetie babies.

682
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:33,900
Don't anybody drop the bomb but me.
I just conned Friedlobe into four...

683
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:35,990
...four singles and possibly an album.

684
00:49:36,411 --> 00:49:39,700
A little vino. If he digs your way out
blues. You can play anything you want.

685
00:49:39,805 --> 00:49:42,250
- When?
- Tomorrow we cut it at four o'clock.

686
00:49:42,287 --> 00:49:43,394
What's the charge?

687
00:49:43,576 --> 00:49:48,000
Scale. You get scale, Ghost gets
scale, and very bad deal for the music.

688
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:50,400
Hey, that's wonderful.
You finally got a job.

689
00:49:50,974 --> 00:49:52,300
Ghost, you're a genius.

690
00:49:53,308 --> 00:49:55,000
Ghost, could I see you a minute?

691
00:49:56,846 --> 00:49:58,600
Hey Benny, what do you mean
a bad deal for the music?

692
00:49:58,724 --> 00:50:00,724
I'd like to see you
alone, if you don't mind.

693
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,800
- Sure, go on.
- No, honey.

694
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,480
Go on.

695
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,400
Okay, we're alone. What's up?

696
00:50:09,427 --> 00:50:11,800
I'll let you play the blues. I
know how much it meant to you.

697
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:14,500
- Yeah, great. So?
- Look, I'm just an agent. But I remember...

698
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:17,500
...years go when we were doing one-nighters,
and playing on little strip-joints.

699
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,500
I know how much sweat you put into it.
But just seemed what we were gonna get...

700
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,800
...just isn't worth the heartache.

701
00:50:22,961 --> 00:50:24,600
But I like the way Jess sings it.

702
00:50:24,662 --> 00:50:28,150
Look, I'm just an agent. My job is to
buy sell, buy sell. You wanna turn in...

703
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,310
...ten years of your life on
some dame. That's your business.

704
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:32,813
Benny, that's not some dame.

705
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,069
That's the girl I'm gonna marry.

706
00:50:35,852 --> 00:50:38,250
Well, like that saying you
know? That's your business.

707
00:50:39,896 --> 00:50:43,517
I mean, is this thing gonna go on
here? Or are we gonna play cards?

708
00:50:52,741 --> 00:50:54,741
Tommy... look at the girl.

709
00:50:55,683 --> 00:50:58,000
Yeah... she's nutty looking.

710
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,100
Hey Skippy, give me
a glass of wine, huh?

711
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,200
Some wine, please?

712
00:51:17,299 --> 00:51:19,299
What? Oh, oh, sure. Help yourself kid.

713
00:51:20,037 --> 00:51:23,000
Hey Charlie, will you quit watching
the girl? Come on, let's play cards.

714
00:51:23,363 --> 00:51:25,363
Hey, don't forget you're gonna give us
one of those sweet songs, right Nick?

715
00:51:25,698 --> 00:51:27,698
Yeah, but I need a
girl to sing for that.

716
00:51:27,927 --> 00:51:29,700
I'll oblige Mr. Bobalinas.

717
00:51:29,815 --> 00:51:32,581
Alright honey. For you, I sing!

718
00:51:33,001 --> 00:51:37,055
You know, that girl's got class...
Oh... No offense, for, of course.

719
00:51:37,266 --> 00:51:39,124
You guys, come on and play cards.

720
00:51:39,373 --> 00:51:40,899
Where did you get a girl like that, huh?

721
00:51:41,501 --> 00:51:43,501
Where did you get a girl like that, heh?

722
00:51:44,157 --> 00:51:46,619
- Vince?
- I pass.

723
00:51:51,927 --> 00:51:53,927
Uh... that's all sweetie baby.

724
00:52:08,782 --> 00:52:12,056
Listen, I uh... I wanna
apologize about last night.

725
00:52:13,999 --> 00:52:17,600
It's nothing. It's
nobody's fault. Forget it.

726
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:20,500
What do you want from me, Jess?

727
00:52:22,503 --> 00:52:25,688
Nothing... I want nothing at all.

728
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:31,900
I thought we were... two unhappy
people that found each other.

729
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:34,500
I mean, you know with me you never
haev to go through the motions.

730
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,600
Benny, please.

731
00:52:41,413 --> 00:52:42,789
I love you, Jess.

732
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:46,777
I'm sorry.

733
00:52:49,615 --> 00:52:55,335
Well... you uh... better think about
it. You know I'm the sensitive type.

734
00:52:57,032 --> 00:52:59,300
You hurt my feelings. You got
yourself an enemy for life.

735
00:53:01,514 --> 00:53:03,514
See, I'll go running around
telling people what I just told you.

736
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:07,960
- I know Benny, but...
- But?

737
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,163
Okay.

738
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,100
What's the matter?

739
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,112
Nothing.

740
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

741
00:53:32,477 --> 00:53:33,730
How much?

742
00:53:33,755 --> 00:53:35,612
What do you got off the record, Ghost?

743
00:53:35,848 --> 00:53:37,848
Off the record, I don't gotta tell you.

744
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:41,190
I'll make you a side bet...

745
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,850
You can't make no side bet. There
only two of us left in the game.

746
00:53:44,844 --> 00:53:47,845
The loser drinks a large glass
of the China wine, okey-dokey?

747
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,367
What do you got them?

748
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:54,162
Okey-dokey, I got three kings.

749
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,800
Drink up.

750
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,145
You try, Ghost.

751
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:25,341
You want something?

752
00:54:26,794 --> 00:54:28,794
I'm just an outsider like you guys.

753
00:54:29,692 --> 00:54:30,957
What do you mean outsider?

754
00:54:32,417 --> 00:54:37,100
There's a party going on over
there... A bunch of... jazz musicians.

755
00:54:40,497 --> 00:54:42,110
I always say live and let live.

756
00:54:42,294 --> 00:54:44,700
- Are you one of them?
- No sir, I work for a living.

757
00:54:45,802 --> 00:54:48,300
Yeah but I mean, you're uh...
you're a friend of theirs, ain't you?

758
00:54:48,509 --> 00:54:49,675
Sometimes.

759
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,006
Tell me... anybody famous in that group?

760
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,554
- Nope. It's just a nothing outfit.
- Who's the leader?

761
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,000
Ghost Wakefield.

762
00:55:02,089 --> 00:55:07,200
Ghost Wakefield, Ghost... Oh! Ghost
Wakefield, yeah you heard of him.

763
00:55:07,363 --> 00:55:08,400
Never heard of him.

764
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:12,606
Tell me uh... is he uh... alright?

765
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:17,573
What's he, one of them dope fiends?

766
00:55:18,784 --> 00:55:20,070
Who knows...

767
00:55:21,925 --> 00:55:24,337
Come here... come here.

768
00:55:27,771 --> 00:55:31,900
I noticed that they're all dancing
with that one little girl over there.

769
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,400
What's she? Some kind of mascot?

770
00:55:35,826 --> 00:55:36,999
Who knows...

771
00:55:41,879 --> 00:55:45,600
You know I uh... I wouldn't trust
my wife around these musicians.

772
00:55:46,096 --> 00:55:50,600
I hear they give parties that go on all
day and all night, a lot of drinking...

773
00:55:50,897 --> 00:55:55,000
They gettin' doped and mixing up
at the races. Bad things like that.

774
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:58,300
You hang around these
musicians, is that true? Huh?

775
00:56:01,419 --> 00:56:02,499
Yeah.

776
00:56:04,123 --> 00:56:06,123
Well, this one don't seem too bad.

777
00:56:16,801 --> 00:56:18,424
You try, Ghost.

778
00:56:19,516 --> 00:56:21,516
No, I don't want any of that Greek slop.

779
00:56:34,605 --> 00:56:36,200
All the way.

780
00:56:36,515 --> 00:56:38,700
Greeks can drink
anybody under the table.

781
00:56:48,419 --> 00:56:50,100
I'm sorry boy.

782
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,200
Fill it up.

783
00:56:57,439 --> 00:56:59,241
You gonna take me on mister?

784
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,536
That's right. I'm gonna take you on. I think
the Irish can out drink the Greeks anything...

785
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,150
And I got ten bucks on me to
prove it. Come on kid, eat it up.

786
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,800
- Hey, he's had two full glasses already.
- It's alright, fill it up, go ahead.

787
00:57:11,749 --> 00:57:13,300
Ten bucks. Come on.

788
00:57:16,821 --> 00:57:18,248
Don't be shy, go ahead.

789
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:58,900
- My name is Tommy Sheehan.
- Great Irish. Go ahead.

790
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,367
Let's see if this is enough for you.
Or maybe you can stand up with me.

791
00:58:03,721 --> 00:58:08,802
- Hey potato?
- Okay olive oil. We'll see. Now pour.

792
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,742
Go ahead, pour.

793
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:21,868
Come on, Greek. Drink up.

794
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:29,600
One more. Come on Nicky.
Another. All the way.

795
00:58:40,366 --> 00:58:41,400
Any Greek cheese?

796
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:46,100
Never mind that Greek cheese Ed. This is
straight little man, come on back out here.

797
00:58:46,193 --> 00:58:47,800
Come on.

798
00:58:48,077 --> 00:58:53,300
Now come on kid, you pour. Go
ahead. Come on pour. Pour. POUR.

799
00:58:54,014 --> 00:58:57,010
- That's enough.
- Pour?

800
00:59:00,024 --> 00:59:01,633
That's enough.

801
00:59:09,275 --> 00:59:13,390
I want you to meet a pal of mine. This
is Skipper. Skipper, Skipper, come here...

802
00:59:13,423 --> 00:59:15,691
This is a wonderful
guy, he hates musicians.

803
00:59:16,663 --> 00:59:19,450
- I hate musicians too.
- Is that right?

804
00:59:20,171 --> 00:59:22,019
Everybody hates musicians.

805
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:24,992
Let me ask you something, do
you ever sing in the shower?

806
00:59:25,142 --> 00:59:26,439
Yeah...

807
00:59:27,102 --> 00:59:29,600
- That makes him a musician too, doesn't it?
- Sure does.

808
00:59:29,747 --> 00:59:34,743
Yeah, but I ain't a dope fiend.
And I uh... I don't mix with spades.

809
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:42,103
I take you, this friend of mine. You know,
he and I are going to sing a duet together.

810
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,800
Hey you know that girl
over there is great.

811
01:00:06,453 --> 01:00:09,150
She's with everybody. Everybody but me.

812
01:00:09,962 --> 01:00:11,438
That's cause she's with me.

813
01:00:11,644 --> 01:00:13,844
Yeah but what's she
doing dancing with him?

814
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,654
Well he have to be my friend.

815
01:00:15,723 --> 01:00:18,327
- Don't I happen to be your friend?
- Nope.

816
01:00:18,819 --> 01:00:21,000
But I'm good enough to drink
with you, I'm your friend.

817
01:00:21,189 --> 01:00:25,867
- Why don't you be a nice guy and go home?
- I ain't doing nothing. I'm just looking.

818
01:00:26,092 --> 01:00:29,939
I think she's cute. You've been dancing
all night. I think she's real cute. I... I

819
01:00:32,985 --> 01:00:34,985
Wanna fight? Come on, get up. Come on.

820
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:41,100
Hey look man, I uh... I don't want any trouble,
I... all I wanted to do was just... just...

821
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,200
dance with the girl now.

822
01:00:45,872 --> 01:00:48,350
Hello Irish. How do you feel, boy?

823
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:52,100
- I'm alright.
- Alright, don't you worry, nobody's going to hurt you.

824
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:55,750
- I'm your friend, right? You remember me.
- Yeah.

825
01:01:00,951 --> 01:01:04,100
Go now, you take Skippy. Go
home. And I tell you what I'll do.

826
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,560
You come in tomorrow night.
You gonna have dinner with me.

827
01:01:06,725 --> 01:01:11,309
We're gonna have our own Greek
dish. And then a long bottle of ouzo.

828
01:01:26,001 --> 01:01:28,600
Okay, you. Come to me. Come here!

829
01:01:32,379 --> 01:01:35,035
Come on jazzman, come on!

830
01:01:41,018 --> 01:01:43,300
Yeah, you're the one I want musician.

831
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,764
Jazzman.

832
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,100
Romeo with your pocket full of needles.

833
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:51,289
How's your arm kid? What
do you do to the girls?

834
01:01:51,814 --> 01:01:55,100
Come on musician. Let me see
if you can feel this punch.

835
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:01,631
The girl's got more guts.

836
01:02:06,205 --> 01:02:10,500
Let go off me boy. Come
on, try and break away.

837
01:02:11,207 --> 01:02:12,321
Let go.

838
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:15,800
Come on musician. Come on.

839
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,000
Let go.

840
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:38,000

841
01:02:56,392 --> 01:02:57,391
Let 'em go man.

842
01:02:57,603 --> 01:03:00,980
Let 'em go. Let 'em go. LET 'EM GO!

843
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:03,561
Let 'em go. That's it.

844
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,363
- Come on you.

845
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,000

846
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:20,100
- You okay Nick?
- Come on, Nick.

847
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:26,498
Boy... he hit me when I wasn't looking.

848
01:03:28,761 --> 01:03:30,761
- Ghost.
- Give me hand here.

849
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,800
Come on baby. Are you alright?

850
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:32,948
- Yeah.
- Huh?

851
01:03:33,785 --> 01:03:36,700
- Yeah man, I'm fine.
- Oh man, get him on that chair, will ya?

852
01:03:36,735 --> 01:03:39,600
- I'm fine.
- Sit down man, for a minute.

853
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,800
A good tumble, huh?

854
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:44,399
He hit like a tank, don't he?

855
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,699
- You wanna smoke?
- No, no, I'm alright.

856
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,800
- Here baby.
- No, I don't want no smoke.

857
01:03:52,033 --> 01:03:53,457

858
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:57,071
I'm fine guys, I'm fine.

859
01:04:04,988 --> 01:04:06,988
Drinking that rechino, man.

860
01:04:08,332 --> 01:04:10,000
Gonna knock you out, huh?

861
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,500
You gotta cut lip, Cliff.
But, you take care of that.

862
01:04:14,696 --> 01:04:15,593
You okay?

863
01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:19,000
Ghost.

864
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:25,852
I love you.

865
01:04:26,464 --> 01:04:27,524
You leave me alone.

866
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,178
I don't need no mother.

867
01:04:29,179 --> 01:04:31,044
- Ghost.
- Take a walk

868
01:04:33,048 --> 01:04:35,000
She's shaking.

869
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,860
I wanna go home.

870
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:39,541
Man, you hurt the girl's
feelings she wants to go home.

871
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,730
You got two legs, take her home.

872
01:04:42,163 --> 01:04:43,210
Sure?

873
01:04:43,705 --> 01:04:45,358
Yeah Charlie, I'm sure.

874
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:47,026
You'll be okay.

875
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,055
Just how you feel.

876
01:05:39,501 --> 01:05:40,800
You okay now?

877
01:05:45,029 --> 01:05:47,300
Yeah, yeah sure. I'm fine.

878
01:05:49,526 --> 01:05:50,588
Well uh...

879
01:05:50,866 --> 01:05:52,866
I'll see you tomorrow, I guess.

880
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,800
Don't go for a minute, would you?

881
01:05:55,678 --> 01:05:58,450
I'd offer you a drink, but
I don't have anything here.

882
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,346
Gee, that's too bad.

883
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,629
I could use a drink.

884
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:16,792
Are you married, Charlie?

885
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:18,917
No.

886
01:06:19,095 --> 01:06:21,095
A guy like you shouldn't
have any trouble

887
01:06:21,752 --> 01:06:24,900
I didn't say I had any trouble. I
said I wasn't married, that's all.

888
01:06:27,131 --> 01:06:28,786
You are Ghost's girl, aren't you?

889
01:06:30,178 --> 01:06:31,732
- No.
- No?

890
01:06:31,811 --> 01:06:33,811
I'm not anybody's girl.

891
01:06:34,968 --> 01:06:35,999
Feet on the ground?

892
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,200
I don't know what I'm
doing half the time.

893
01:06:39,289 --> 01:06:41,000
You are not Ghost's girl?

894
01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:43,469
No.

895
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,700
You said you had nothing to drink?

896
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I know of a place that's open.

897
01:06:53,437 --> 01:06:54,700
Not far.

898
01:06:55,534 --> 01:06:56,903
You wanna wait for me?

899
01:06:57,999 --> 01:06:59,350
Don't go.

900
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:03,550
Don't leave me Charlie, please.
I don't want to be alone.

901
01:07:40,397 --> 01:07:42,397
What are you doing here?

902
01:07:44,969 --> 01:07:46,969
I came to see if you were alright.

903
01:07:50,909 --> 01:07:52,426
You're okay, aren't you Princess?

904
01:07:53,787 --> 01:07:56,700
I'm fine... nobody hit me.

905
01:07:58,900 --> 01:07:59,734
Look...

906
01:07:59,999 --> 01:08:02,251
- Honey.
- Don't you touch me!

907
01:08:09,701 --> 01:08:11,440
I'm not a prize fighter.

908
01:08:11,844 --> 01:08:13,999
That's not what I was looking for.

909
01:08:15,396 --> 01:08:17,385
I didn't want a prize fighter.

910
01:08:19,999 --> 01:08:21,999
Now you just please leave.

911
01:08:23,148 --> 01:08:25,148
Cause I got somebody inside with me.

912
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:29,200
Yeah.

913
01:08:30,087 --> 01:08:31,800
And he's bigger than you are.

914
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,380
And he's real big.

915
01:08:35,448 --> 01:08:37,448
So he might hurt your feelings.

916
01:08:49,049 --> 01:08:51,520
- Wakefield's late Benny. Where is he?
- He'll be here

917
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:54,400
He'll be here, he'll be here. Oh
boy, what did I get myself into.

918
01:08:54,513 --> 01:08:56,000
How much a night, Dixie?

919
01:08:56,117 --> 01:08:58,117
- Didn't I tell you about these guys?
- Alright.

920
01:08:58,150 --> 01:08:59,400
Don't worry about it.

921
01:08:59,473 --> 01:09:01,500
Don't worry about it?
Every minute costs me money.

922
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,599
Who's gonna pay the
musicians the overtime, huh?

923
01:09:04,621 --> 01:09:06,700
You gotta be independently wealthy
to survive in this business.

924
01:09:07,450 --> 01:09:09,000
What happened to Princess?

925
01:09:09,018 --> 01:09:12,400
Oh, she got all shook up last night by the
fight. Don't want to be a singer no more.

926
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,850
She quit?

927
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,100
Yeah, she doesn't want to play anymore.

928
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:20,250
I cut off my arm for us before I quit.

929
01:09:20,853 --> 01:09:25,000
Milt, you don't know anything about
music. You don't know nothing about music.

930
01:09:25,606 --> 01:09:27,700
That other girl had a
foggy voice. Right, Georgie?

931
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:30,496
- Yeah.
- This girl has a clean voice, right?

932
01:09:32,474 --> 01:09:34,474
- Is that right, Georgie?
- Yeah.

933
01:09:35,095 --> 01:09:38,000
Alright, but she better good. I'm
warning you she better be good.

934
01:09:38,076 --> 01:09:41,810
- Milt, she's wonderful. Would I lie?
- Would I lie, an agent. Would I lie?

935
01:09:54,072 --> 01:09:56,000
Hey uh, who's the bird?

936
01:09:56,168 --> 01:09:58,168
Carol Samuels, got a great voice.

937
01:09:58,249 --> 01:10:00,000
Yeah?

938
01:10:00,001 --> 01:10:02,000
Ugly chick.

939
01:10:02,888 --> 01:10:06,650
- Man, it's about time.
- Told you before they were a bunch of bananas.

940
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:12,448
What's he gonna do?

941
01:10:14,351 --> 01:10:16,132
Are we ready Mr. Wakefield?

942
01:10:23,021 --> 01:10:24,400
Benny, is there trouble?

943
01:10:27,149 --> 01:10:28,800
I got it Milt, just
stay out a second okay?

944
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:31,400
- Something wrong kid?
- Yeah, something's wrong.

945
01:10:31,835 --> 01:10:35,350
I don't wanna sell the blues. And we
have to give you something else, okay?

946
01:10:35,663 --> 01:10:39,012
Something else uh. First it's a new girl, now
it's a new number. What am I buying here anyway?

947
01:10:39,154 --> 01:10:40,450
It's too bad, that's the way it is.

948
01:10:40,494 --> 01:10:43,400
Look, we made an agreement. I
want what I want. Nothing else.

949
01:10:43,547 --> 01:10:45,547
I don't think he's happy
with the price, Milt.

950
01:10:45,747 --> 01:10:47,747
Benny and I worked it out. We agree.

951
01:10:49,464 --> 01:10:51,300
Did you work it out for me?

952
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,300
Okay, you got your deal
and it's not changing.

953
01:10:54,641 --> 01:10:56,250
Well that's not enough, right?

954
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,800
What do you mean 'not enough'?
You guys are dependent on Goldstar.

955
01:11:00,733 --> 01:11:04,999
You got one chance, and one chance
only. And it's right here with me now.

956
01:11:05,239 --> 01:11:07,600
Not tomorrow, not playing
in some back rooms.

957
01:11:08,801 --> 01:11:11,100
Come on. Think about
it, let's be honest.

958
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,973
Ghost, look, uh... we got a
chance to record here and uh...

959
01:11:14,993 --> 01:11:18,500
the blues tune you know is great and everything
and, and you're not compromising anything.

960
01:11:18,968 --> 01:11:21,687
Come on Ghost, let's cut it.
There's a reason we came here for.

961
01:11:21,999 --> 01:11:24,841
Hey, Mr. Friedlobe. He's
not interested in the money.

962
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,900
You know how Mr. Friedlobe
says: 'let's be honest' huh?

963
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:31,497
Well, let's be honest guys.

964
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:34,514
What do you know...

965
01:11:36,572 --> 01:11:39,311
You don't know nothing
about playing my music, man.

966
01:11:40,456 --> 01:11:41,575
None of ya'.

967
01:11:43,573 --> 01:11:45,311
I own that tune.

968
01:11:45,897 --> 01:11:47,108
You understand me?

969
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:53,200
I own it cause I wrote it. Cause I
scored it. Cause I know how to play it.

970
01:11:53,443 --> 01:11:58,000
I sweat with it, I laugh with it, I cry...
It's like part of me, you understand?

971
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:00,450
Hey man, look. You're not the
only one in the group, man.

972
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:04,600
Look, look, Ghost. We're willing to string along
with you, playing charities, clown around...

973
01:12:04,867 --> 01:12:07,100
What is so important about
money all of a sudden?

974
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:09,000
Are you kidding man?

975
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:12,200
Tell me where you guys were gigging
when I picked you up? Tell me that.

976
01:12:12,279 --> 01:12:14,279
I'll tell you: Nowhere.

977
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:16,100
That's where.

978
01:12:16,152 --> 01:12:18,152
- Nowhere.
- You wait a minute.

979
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:23,659
I'm gonna tell you something.

980
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,500
You guys are nothing...

981
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:31,365
Nothing but phonies, man.

982
01:12:32,369 --> 01:12:34,780
Phonies, you dig me?
Phonies! You know why?

983
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:38,640
Cause you talking about fame all the time,
and you talking about making it big and...

984
01:12:38,645 --> 01:12:42,302
being something, am I right? You
tell that to me Charlie, didn't you?

985
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,270
Well go find your own music, man.

986
01:12:46,685 --> 01:12:48,100
Go write it if you can.

987
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,400
I am tired of carrying this group boy.

988
01:12:51,495 --> 01:12:54,150
- Come on, Ghost...
- Get your hands off of me, man.

989
01:12:57,369 --> 01:12:58,850
Shelley, Pete!

990
01:12:58,867 --> 01:13:00,867
Don't fight me baby. Don't touch him.

991
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,400
Let him drop dead.

992
01:13:06,754 --> 01:13:08,415
Come on Shel.

993
01:13:13,042 --> 01:13:14,763
Let's go Benny.

994
01:13:15,116 --> 01:13:16,545
You mean, I'm still in?

995
01:13:17,756 --> 01:13:20,049
- You're my agent, ain't you?
- You sure?

996
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,100
Yeah, I'm sure.

997
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,600
- Let's go.
- Hey Ghost, listen...

998
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,300
Benny...

999
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:30,150
Listen man, I'm not sorry.

1000
01:13:32,065 --> 01:13:34,000
You don't need this.

1001
01:13:34,048 --> 01:13:36,000
You're the leader...

1002
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:40,043
If you need a sax, I'm around.

1003
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,600
These cats don't
understand tough scenes.

1004
01:13:46,647 --> 01:13:48,073
Later baby.

1005
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,600
Benny are you through with me?

1006
01:13:49,601 --> 01:13:52,900
Yeah, thanks honey. Your check will
be at the union and no fee, okay?

1007
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:06,800
We're still friends?

1008
01:14:06,849 --> 01:14:11,800
Friends? NO. Personally, I can't stand your guts. But
you're talented and my job is to service talented people.

1009
01:14:11,816 --> 01:14:12,999
So what do you want me to do?

1010
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:15,558
I don't care.

1011
01:14:17,777 --> 01:14:20,600
Well I care. I got no time for failures.

1012
01:14:21,562 --> 01:14:24,692
Okay... make me a success.

1013
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:30,830
Alright... I know a fairly attractive woman
who spends fortunes sponsoring the careers...

1014
01:14:30,914 --> 01:14:33,200
of talented young jazz musicians.

1015
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,200
What do I have to do?

1016
01:14:36,292 --> 01:14:38,600
Nothing complicated. Just the usual.

1017
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:42,255
Good deal.

1018
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:46,000
I'll make the call right now.

1019
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:11,740
- Vodka and tonic?
- Scotch.

1020
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,500
- Straight?
- On the rocks.

1021
01:16:14,724 --> 01:16:17,000
If I'd said on the rocks,
you'd have wanted it straight.

1022
01:16:17,192 --> 01:16:19,000
Forget it, I'll make my own drink.

1023
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,635
How'd it go tonight?

1024
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,365
Like usual.

1025
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,000
What a bunch of creeps.

1026
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,310
Could be me out there and Harry
the Butcher, it's all the same...

1027
01:16:27,483 --> 01:16:30,219
You put a label on something and
call it Jazz and they all swallow it.

1028
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,028
Glasses tinkering... whispering.

1029
01:16:39,056 --> 01:16:41,056
Waiters comping that stupid feet.

1030
01:16:41,759 --> 01:16:43,600
Who needs it?

1031
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,599
You do.

1032
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:49,999
You kidding me, it could be Art Tatum out there.
They wouldn't about anything but the check.

1033
01:16:51,643 --> 01:16:53,643
If you were Art Tatum...

1034
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,383
But then, you're not.

1035
01:16:56,441 --> 01:17:00,658
If you were talented...
but you're not that either.

1036
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:03,500
Great. All of a sudden
you became a critic.

1037
01:17:04,586 --> 01:17:07,315
I've been with a few
good musicians in my day.

1038
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:10,060
I know all about your sex life.

1039
01:17:12,193 --> 01:17:16,193
You could get some response if you take
a chance, and some decent accompaniment.

1040
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:20,603
Will you get me my robe.

1041
01:17:27,222 --> 01:17:29,299
I'm getting tired of
being pushed around.

1042
01:17:31,399 --> 01:17:33,326
I think that's funny.

1043
01:17:35,267 --> 01:17:38,605
If I were you by now, why...
I'd uh... I'd be used to it.

1044
01:17:39,471 --> 01:17:41,471
I mean I'm getting bored with it.

1045
01:17:45,299 --> 01:17:46,642
You're what?

1046
01:17:47,049 --> 01:17:49,049
Go ahead, hit me.

1047
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:54,530
- Tired of being pushed?
- That's right.

1048
01:17:56,525 --> 01:17:58,190
You're bored with me?

1049
01:17:58,194 --> 01:18:00,000
- No.
- Well that's what you said.

1050
01:18:00,057 --> 01:18:03,561
I mean I'm bored with pretending that
you're a success, that you're a hero.

1051
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:07,200
You're as insecure as I am.
You're as dissilusioned, and...

1052
01:18:08,055 --> 01:18:10,800
Cheap... as I am.

1053
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:13,999
And I'm bored pretending
that it's any other way.

1054
01:18:14,325 --> 01:18:17,166
Okay now take a good look in
there and see the one difference.

1055
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:21,041
I don't pay for you, do I?

1056
01:18:21,938 --> 01:18:23,938
You like to be here, don't you?

1057
01:18:24,198 --> 01:18:26,198
You want to subsidize my music?

1058
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,660
Subsidize your what?

1059
01:18:28,665 --> 01:18:30,000
My music.

1060
01:18:30,011 --> 01:18:31,970
Darling, not since I've known you.

1061
01:18:31,984 --> 01:18:34,837
I don't know what it is you're
looking for, but it is not music.

1062
01:18:35,218 --> 01:18:36,900
And it's not me either.

1063
01:18:36,901 --> 01:18:41,466
Because what you're looking for isn't around,
it's being unscrewed up that you're looking for.

1064
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:44,401
Hurray, for whatever
that's supposed to mean.

1065
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,654
That means you're stupid.

1066
01:18:51,591 --> 01:18:53,591
That means I want out from you.

1067
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,100
You want what?

1068
01:18:57,163 --> 01:18:59,163
OUT!

1069
01:19:05,978 --> 01:19:07,800
What do you want, huh?

1070
01:19:12,435 --> 01:19:14,110
I'm gonna tell you what you want.

1071
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,499
And it ain't out.

1072
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:11,462
Hello, Idealist. How are you?

1073
01:20:13,136 --> 01:20:15,136
- Ghost Wakefield, Billy Gray.
- Hello.

1074
01:20:15,417 --> 01:20:17,000
Hello Countess.

1075
01:20:17,903 --> 01:20:22,909
I'm shocked... I'm honestly and
truly honored and deeply shocked.

1076
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:25,100
- Billy, is that right?
- Billy Grey.

1077
01:20:25,145 --> 01:20:27,145
Well how are you? How
are you, Billy Grey?

1078
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:30,720
Do you know that the man you're with is my
agent, and I haven't seen him in a whole year.

1079
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,350
I thought you were dead.

1080
01:20:34,514 --> 01:20:35,560
Excuse me, Ghost.

1081
01:20:35,952 --> 01:20:39,121
I'm showing her the dressing room,
she moves in here on the thirteenth.

1082
01:20:40,408 --> 01:20:42,000
A bad luck day.

1083
01:20:42,022 --> 01:20:43,510
Well now, luck's what
you make it, right artist?

1084
01:20:46,456 --> 01:20:48,500
- If I can have attend to it.
- Alrighty.

1085
01:20:48,501 --> 01:20:49,400
Fine.

1086
01:20:49,562 --> 01:20:51,999
Hey Benny, I hear there's a new
club pening in Frisco, is that right?

1087
01:20:52,302 --> 01:20:55,400
Yeah, the Blue Room. But it's too
rich for your blood. Right, Countess?

1088
01:20:56,450 --> 01:20:57,800
How much?

1089
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,300
Well, you haven't got enough. They only
take names. You know, no exceptions.

1090
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:03,001
Benny, I'd like to have a new shower

1091
01:21:03,033 --> 01:21:06,189
What do you mean by names, man?
What do I look like, chopped liver?

1092
01:21:06,387 --> 01:21:09,800
- Course I'd rather have a tub, right?
- This is the top spot and I get the best...

1093
01:21:09,871 --> 01:21:11,871
The best money in Los
Angeles, man you know that.

1094
01:21:11,872 --> 01:21:13,870
What more do they want?
No way your credits.

1095
01:21:13,917 --> 01:21:15,386
Listen, would you like
a white rug in here...

1096
01:21:15,426 --> 01:21:17,426
I'm talking to you, man!

1097
01:21:17,946 --> 01:21:19,039
What is it?

1098
01:21:19,062 --> 01:21:21,062
That's better.

1099
01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:25,387
- Now where do I go after this?
- I don't know right now.

1100
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,500
When do you suppose you're
gonna make up your mind?

1101
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:32,400
Well you see I'm not the one who makes the
decision. The owner of the club's do that...

1102
01:21:32,401 --> 01:21:36,453
Now it's why it's complicated. Now you
have the Countess call me tomorrow, alright?

1103
01:21:37,065 --> 01:21:39,300
Like I say, right now I'm
real state, I'm a rental agent.

1104
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:41,495
- Well, what do you think, honey?
- It's fine.

1105
01:21:41,570 --> 01:21:43,570
I wanna talk to you now, and I
want to talk to you alone, Benny.

1106
01:21:44,595 --> 01:21:49,200
Well listen, you picked a very bad time. I'm
busy uh... You have the Countess call me tomorrow.

1107
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:50,250
No, I don't wanna have no...

1108
01:21:50,294 --> 01:21:53,323
It won't take you out long, why don't
you all let me wait for you outisde.

1109
01:21:54,811 --> 01:21:56,999
You're a nice girl... she's a nice
girl, you know how these things are.

1110
01:21:57,066 --> 01:22:00,000
They just get busy for a second, you
know? Haven't seen him in a long time.

1111
01:22:00,001 --> 01:22:02,609
I gotta talk business, thanks. Thanks.

1112
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,300
Look, I said have the
Countess call me tomorrow.

1113
01:22:07,557 --> 01:22:09,100
I need another job, Benny.

1114
01:22:11,583 --> 01:22:13,500
I'm tired of playing the Gigolo bit.

1115
01:22:13,503 --> 01:22:17,706
I'll take a cut. I don't have to play here in Swingtown
man, I'll work a downtown club, it don't matter.

1116
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,711
Don't be ridiculous.

1117
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:24,456
Benny, I need another gig.

1118
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:28,600
You don't seem to get my point.

1119
01:22:31,215 --> 01:22:33,215
Are you kidding man,
they love me out there.

1120
01:22:34,006 --> 01:22:36,006
I never played better
in my life, they...

1121
01:22:37,876 --> 01:22:42,839
Twenty people came up to me, Benny, tonight, after I
got through playing and they wanted my autograph man.

1122
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,500
They wanna talk to me. They just wanted
to invite me to party, are you kidding?

1123
01:22:46,612 --> 01:22:47,999
Once maybe, not now.

1124
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
What do you mean, not now?

1125
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:55,249
I mean a hundred guys can play what you
are playing out there, and ninety-nine...

1126
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:56,780
...of them can play it better.

1127
01:22:56,799 --> 01:22:59,150
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?

1128
01:23:05,931 --> 01:23:07,931
It's a matter of opinion, man.

1129
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:12,608
That's just one little man's opinion.

1130
01:23:14,598 --> 01:23:16,550
I did some weird things man...

1131
01:23:17,022 --> 01:23:19,700
But I never sold my soul.

1132
01:23:21,108 --> 01:23:23,108
I sold me, man. But never my soul.

1133
01:23:23,528 --> 01:23:25,528
I played what I like
with no compromises.

1134
01:23:27,062 --> 01:23:29,900
Name me one guy in this business
who knows anything about music.

1135
01:23:30,115 --> 01:23:31,450
Go ahead, one guy.

1136
01:23:31,454 --> 01:23:36,259
There's nobody, I don't care who it is,
who knows anything good, from anything bad.

1137
01:23:36,556 --> 01:23:41,800
It's all a matter of opinion, Benny. And
nobody, nobody, ever walked out on me.

1138
01:23:42,256 --> 01:23:44,499
Well, you had it once when you
used to play with your group.

1139
01:23:44,841 --> 01:23:46,700
You guys tried to say
something when you played.

1140
01:23:46,763 --> 01:23:49,385
Don't talk to me about music.

1141
01:23:52,337 --> 01:23:55,000
Can't talk to about my music, man.

1142
01:23:55,752 --> 01:23:58,486
Alright then, let's not talk about
music, let's talk about people.

1143
01:24:00,505 --> 01:24:04,018
Cause you're a failure there too, man.
You haven't got a friend left in the world.

1144
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,443
You wanna know why?

1145
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:08,798
Cause you're a bum.

1146
01:24:09,999 --> 01:24:15,500
When an idealist sells himself out, everybody passes
judgement. The bigger the idealist, the bigger the bum.

1147
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:19,461
You're known all over
town as 'her boy. '

1148
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,870
And nobody wants her boy
playing in their band.

1149
01:24:24,647 --> 01:24:27,149
Go on, take a look in the mirror. Go
on, take a good look in the mirror, kid.

1150
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:29,812
That's all you got left to
sell. Go on. Take a good look!

1151
01:24:30,853 --> 01:24:34,500
As far as I can see, she's the only buyer. Now,
maybe you can get yourself a job someplace else...

1152
01:24:34,501 --> 01:24:37,600
I don't know. But if you're looking
for a little respect, forget it!

1153
01:24:39,443 --> 01:24:42,550
Now remember, you came and you said 'Benny
make me a success,' well I said to myself...

1154
01:24:42,552 --> 01:24:47,370
Here's a guy I can't stand personally, a
guy who talks big and loud about art and...

1155
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:50,514
Freedom of expression and I
think he's a phony. A real phony!

1156
01:24:50,856 --> 01:24:54,450
And he wants me to make him a
success. Well alright, phony...

1157
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:59,897
You're a success...
you got what you wanted.

1158
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,999
And I found out what I wanted.

1159
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,930
Countess, you wanna call
me in the morning? Fine.

1160
01:25:07,213 --> 01:25:11,257
If not... well I'll see
you around, sweetie babies.

1161
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,433
What do you say, Greek old pal?

1162
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:46,788
You drinking any wine lately?

1163
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:48,999
A long Ghost, what do you know, boy?

1164
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,492
I'm living.

1165
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:53,400
You don't come around no
more since you work steady.

1166
01:25:54,094 --> 01:25:56,094
All the money goes into
rich people's pocket.

1167
01:25:56,999 --> 01:25:58,652
You know what they say:
'money goes to money. '

1168
01:25:58,794 --> 01:26:00,000
Yeah.

1169
01:26:00,147 --> 01:26:02,073
Mind if I buy myself a beer?

1170
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:04,250
I'll buy the beer.

1171
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:06,284
- Thank you, Ghost.
- Pleasure.

1172
01:26:07,134 --> 01:26:09,000
See that?

1173
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,700
No, thanks.

1174
01:26:11,946 --> 01:26:13,946
Well, good all days is dead.

1175
01:26:14,678 --> 01:26:16,678
- The boys do come around, don't they?
- No.

1176
01:26:17,278 --> 01:26:19,000
They don't?

1177
01:26:19,167 --> 01:26:24,211
Got a deal down in Los Angeles. Small dump,
play for a lotta dumbells. Dancing and girls...

1178
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:29,900
Place stinks... sawdust on the floor.

1179
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,876
Where would that be?

1180
01:26:35,248 --> 01:26:37,165
They don't wanna see you no more, Ghost.

1181
01:26:37,713 --> 01:26:39,713
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1182
01:26:41,197 --> 01:26:42,642
What's the name of the place?

1183
01:26:43,006 --> 01:26:44,864
Uh...

1184
01:26:47,014 --> 01:26:49,014
The witch's tale.

1185
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:51,000
Thanks.

1186
01:26:51,245 --> 01:26:53,700
Oh uh... what do I
owe you for the bruise?

1187
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:57,077
Old time shake.

1188
01:26:58,043 --> 01:27:00,043
Yeah.

1189
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:47,393
You need a sax over swangtown?

1190
01:27:48,067 --> 01:27:51,140
What say music man?
How's... how's business man?

1191
01:27:52,008 --> 01:27:54,712
- Hello, Charlie.
- Great to see you man.

1192
01:27:59,035 --> 01:28:01,400
You uh... working with the boys, huh?

1193
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:04,300
Yeah well, I'm... just
taking a hiatus for a while.

1194
01:28:04,899 --> 01:28:08,763
What's that they say on the uptown
side of the street... slumping.

1195
01:28:10,129 --> 01:28:12,129
Seriously, I'm thinking
of forming my own group.

1196
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:17,600
I heard you got married.

1197
01:28:17,635 --> 01:28:20,055
Married! No.

1198
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,800
Is that good or is that bad?

1199
01:28:23,848 --> 01:28:25,590
That's great.

1200
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,416
You're living with her?

1201
01:28:30,418 --> 01:28:32,418
Listen man, she was a real stiff man.

1202
01:28:33,804 --> 01:28:38,480
I mean, you threw her over... she comes running
to me, comes all like a storm for a month.

1203
01:28:38,673 --> 01:28:40,158
Marry me she said.

1204
01:28:40,930 --> 01:28:42,999
Me, marry Jess Polanski? I say.

1205
01:28:43,385 --> 01:28:46,944
I say what for, I say. I'm a
musician, I don't go steady.

1206
01:28:47,786 --> 01:28:49,600
So she said she'd kill herself.

1207
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,608
So I said, you up dead.

1208
01:28:53,150 --> 01:28:54,700
What happened to her?

1209
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:57,500
Hey Ghost...

1210
01:28:58,691 --> 01:29:00,300
A dame like that...

1211
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,592
Was nothing for a guy like you.

1212
01:29:05,532 --> 01:29:07,532
Where do I find her?

1213
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:16,318
Oh, she used to hang
around... Reno's salon.

1214
01:29:17,958 --> 01:29:19,500
Thanks.

1215
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:39,268
Yes or no?

1216
01:29:39,763 --> 01:29:41,550
Are you kidding?

1217
01:29:41,555 --> 01:29:43,500
Well, what do you want?

1218
01:29:48,872 --> 01:29:51,700
I want a rose-covered cottage.

1219
01:29:51,888 --> 01:29:53,888
Let's have another drink.

1220
01:29:54,228 --> 01:29:58,350
Baby... this is my busy time.

1221
01:29:58,814 --> 01:30:00,814
Have another drink.

1222
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:03,569
We got a deal. We gotta make a deal.

1223
01:30:04,717 --> 01:30:07,717
Just, what you're asking
has to be thought about.

1224
01:30:07,981 --> 01:30:12,040
I mean, okay. It's a deal.

1225
01:30:12,876 --> 01:30:14,876
If you want it.

1226
01:30:15,592 --> 01:30:17,592
- Right, Sal?
- Why not?

1227
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:19,577
It's late.

1228
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:25,226
Anytime I can drink enough wine.

1229
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,448
I give everything I've got.

1230
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:44,665
Hey Ghost, come on! Now come on now, Ghost. Cut
it out. You heard what I said, now cut it out.

1231
01:30:55,742 --> 01:30:57,350
Get out.

1232
01:31:46,354 --> 01:31:47,719
Hi.

1233
01:31:48,373 --> 01:31:50,373
Hello, Jess.

1234
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:54,250
No more Princess?

1235
01:31:57,463 --> 01:31:59,463
No. No more Princess.

1236
01:31:59,784 --> 01:32:01,784
Then what you got back for?

1237
01:32:02,354 --> 01:32:03,400
I mean...

1238
01:32:05,857 --> 01:32:08,447
I don't need you to
come back in here and...

1239
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:11,107
And ruin everything.

1240
01:32:11,663 --> 01:32:13,663
It's just too late.

1241
01:32:17,903 --> 01:32:20,069
I'm not even high fashion.

1242
01:32:26,509 --> 01:32:28,509
I just do what I can do best.

1243
01:32:29,151 --> 01:32:33,378
That's all. And now, for
tomorrow not to be there.

1244
01:32:39,456 --> 01:32:41,456
I'm just me, Ghost.

1245
01:32:45,437 --> 01:32:47,437
But I'm nothing.

1246
01:32:48,397 --> 01:32:50,397
Oh, honey...

1247
01:32:56,174 --> 01:32:58,174
Are you something.

1248
01:33:05,818 --> 01:33:07,600
Go ahead.

1249
01:33:07,812 --> 01:33:09,812
How do you know it's here?

1250
01:33:10,641 --> 01:33:12,641
I'd take you home.

1251
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,100
Hurry up.

1252
01:33:20,647 --> 01:33:22,647
You're real crazy Ghost.

1253
01:33:24,562 --> 01:33:28,597
You ought to see me in a...
sheet, I'm a panic then.

1254
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,250
Hey uh, Reno, how much do I owe you?

1255
01:33:40,303 --> 01:33:42,624
Give me a few bucks, we'll call it even.

1256
01:33:56,637 --> 01:33:58,775
Jess honey! Let it go!

1257
01:33:59,218 --> 01:34:01,218
Let it go!

1258
01:34:05,429 --> 01:34:06,800
Cut it out!

1259
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,999
Face in the water.

1260
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:17,093
Look I'm telling you I've had it,
Ghost, I want no more troubles!

1261
01:34:17,136 --> 01:34:18,936
- There's no trouble.
- Shut up.

1262
01:34:18,937 --> 01:34:21,150
Look, you too get out of here!
Come on, come on. Get out of here!

1263
01:34:32,150 --> 01:34:33,999
I'm alright.

1264
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,600
I probably couldn't
have done that anyway.

1265
01:35:20,636 --> 01:35:23,836
- I know.
- I had lots of time.

1266
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,686
And I still love you.

1267
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,089
Easy.

1268
01:35:46,001 --> 01:35:48,535
Nobody believes anybody
anymore, do they?

1269
01:35:50,831 --> 01:35:52,431
I'm good for nothing.

1270
01:35:53,323 --> 01:35:56,606
Nothing is the only thing I've
ever given in my whole life.

1271
01:35:59,577 --> 01:36:01,577
Nothing ever got better
because I was there.

1272
01:36:03,994 --> 01:36:08,215
Nobody ever once said, 'thank
god Jess Polanski was here. '

1273
01:36:12,289 --> 01:36:16,519
So... buy me a drink, huh?

1274
01:36:16,884 --> 01:36:18,884
Or leave me alone.

1275
01:36:25,502 --> 01:36:27,131
Let's get out of here.

1276
01:37:05,901 --> 01:37:07,901
Wait, why are you
pushing me in here for.

1277
01:37:08,046 --> 01:37:10,346
- Take me home!
- What do you want here pal?

1278
01:37:11,244 --> 01:37:13,062
I don't wanna come in here.

1279
01:37:13,281 --> 01:37:15,100
Let me go!

1280
01:37:15,355 --> 01:37:17,355
You scum!

1281
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,563
What, the Countess let her
protege have a night out?

1282
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:23,999
Alright, that's enough Red.

1283
01:37:24,006 --> 01:37:26,106
Enough nothing, how's your punch champ?

1284
01:37:27,950 --> 01:37:29,435
I'm sorry Pete.

1285
01:37:29,599 --> 01:37:33,953
Alright big boy, why don't you just
turn around and get out of here.

1286
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,544
Go on Ghost, beat it.

1287
01:37:37,718 --> 01:37:39,779
Lose yourself, you heard him.

1288
01:37:40,522 --> 01:37:42,595
Red, it doesn't matter
what you say I'm sorry.

1289
01:37:44,739 --> 01:37:47,514
There ain't nothing here... nothing.

1290
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,875
Not for you.

1291
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,148
Now you get yourself lost.

1292
01:37:55,969 --> 01:37:57,969
Then you die.

1293
01:38:02,935 --> 01:38:04,500
Charlie...

1294
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:11,300
Shelley I, I, uh...

1295
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:14,650
I'm sorry.

1296
01:38:14,734 --> 01:38:18,818
Well it's just a little too late to
be crying the blues now, isn't it?

1297
01:38:19,011 --> 01:38:20,854
I'll tell you what you do.

1298
01:38:21,742 --> 01:38:26,300
You take your little pink cotton candy
dreams and you get them out of here.

1299
01:38:26,378 --> 01:38:28,250
And I mean outta here!

1300
01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:32,586
And on your way out my friend, you take a look
around you when you take a look at this place.

1301
01:38:34,637 --> 01:38:39,016
And you realize when you take your little look that
this is everything that we've got in the world...

1302
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:41,038
This is everything that we've got.

1303
01:38:42,683 --> 01:38:46,768
For which we say, many thanks. Now I want
to play number six, I wanna play it now...

1304
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,101
Let's go, number six. Play it!
