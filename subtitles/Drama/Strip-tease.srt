1
00:00:03,935 --> 00:00:06,021
Previously on Studio 60...

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,551
On Monday I'm going to start to build a city in China

3
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,385
There’s an American consortium

4
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:14,764
TMG, Steve Wynn, MGM Grand….

5
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:21,053
We're investing 20 billion dollars in Macau to turn it into the Las Vegas of Asia.

6
00:00:21,378 --> 00:00:22,976
We're this close...

7
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:29,071
I just drove us 99 yards down the field. Take it the last yard.

8
00:00:29,574 --> 00:00:31,467
Put it in the damn house!

9
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:35,175
THE CHRISTMAS SHOW

10
00:00:42,832 --> 00:00:44,176
It’s strange that you’re here.

11
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:45,199
I don’t think so.

12
00:00:45,497 --> 00:00:46,068
Really?

13
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:48,077
There are lots of men here.

14
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:49,552
They’re the fathers.

15
00:00:50,147 --> 00:00:51,443
You think all of them?

16
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:53,346
Excuse me.

17
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:56,808
Are there any men here who are neither the husband nor the father?

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,091
Get your hand down.

19
00:01:01,953 --> 00:01:07,055
“At 12 weeks a healthy baby would be about 2 inches long and weigh less than an ounce.

20
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,039
- If you’re under 35 -“
- I’m under 35.

21
00:01:11,943 --> 00:01:14,155
- This is no time for vanity.
- I’m under 35.

22
00:01:14,262 --> 00:01:15,796
All right, so you’re under 35.

23
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:19,913
Then you’re not considered a high-risk mother and as a result no… what’s that word?

24
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,221
Amniocentesis.

25
00:01:21,518 --> 00:01:25,110
Good. No amniocentesis is required. If you were under 35,

26
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:26,645
then what we’ve gotta do is

27
00:01:26,646 --> 00:01:30,784
stick a needle about half a foot into your stomach and get some fluid out of your prenatal girth.

28
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:31,497
Why are you here?

29
00:01:31,545 --> 00:01:33,008
- Morale.
- I really don’t need help.

30
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:37,740
Not now, but you will soon, because this says you’re going to have to make a journey of 1200 miles

31
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:39,357
to bury your eggs in the warm mud.

32
00:01:39,358 --> 00:01:40,903
- Danny.
- Wait, that can’t be you.

33
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:41,688
No.

34
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:43,829
That’s an Alaskan king crab that has to do that.

35
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,285
Yeah.

36
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:45,938
Why won’t you tell me who the father is?

37
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:47,687
- You don’t know him.
- I don’t want to know him.

38
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:48,590
How do you know?

39
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:50,517
Because if it was someone I wanted to know, he’d be here.

40
00:01:53,634 --> 00:01:54,847
What makes you think I told him?

41
00:01:54,978 --> 00:01:56,000
‘Cause I do know you.

42
00:01:57,915 --> 00:01:58,498
Jordan?

43
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:01,221
Thank you.

44
00:02:03,385 --> 00:02:04,503
Yes, I told him.

45
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:09,641
“Well, it’s entirely up to you, kitten –“

46
00:02:09,642 --> 00:02:10,331
Yeah.

47
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,173
“—but I’ll pay for everything; no worries in that department.”

48
00:02:16,392 --> 00:02:18,223
You can step behind the partition and put on this gown.

49
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:19,758
- Thank you.
- Thanks a lot.

50
00:02:23,064 --> 00:02:24,301
So, who was it?

51
00:02:26,174 --> 00:02:27,470
My ex-boyfriend.

52
00:02:28,505 --> 00:02:29,052
Whoa.

53
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:30,230
Yes.

54
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:30,969
Wait.

55
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:32,003
Ironic.

56
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:35,393
The guy from Great Western Mutual who ratted me out on the drug test?

57
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:36,142
Yep.

58
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:41,317
Was sleeping with him to get that information really worth it?

59
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:43,826
I didn’t sleep with him to get the information;

60
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:46,193
He gave me the information so he could sleep with me.

61
00:02:46,194 --> 00:02:48,369
Still, integrity all over the place.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,332
This is the time for a lecture?

63
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,080
No, that was about twelve weeks ago.

64
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:55,600
By the way, did you and the Last Honest Man get loaded on Jagermeister

65
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:58,086
and forget that there’s like 500 different types of birth control?

66
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:00,567
Jordan.

67
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:01,471
How are you?

68
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,172
- Daniel Tripp.
- Ah, the husband.

69
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:04,123
We’re not married.

70
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:05,669
The boyfriend, then.

71
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,037
No, I’m the executive producer.

72
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:09,475
- Oh, hey, you’re Danny Tripp.
- Yes, sir.

73
00:03:09,697 --> 00:03:11,195
- The show’s great.
- Thanks a lot.

74
00:03:11,397 --> 00:03:12,111
I just...

75
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:15,524
...love Nicholas Cage in all the different jobs you’ve got him in…

76
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,830
ah, what is it… couples’ counselor, shop teacher…

77
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:19,758
Thanks, I’ll pass that along.

78
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,686
Uh, fellas? I’m a little exposed here.

79
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,161
Let’s get started.

80
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,420
You’re not planning on staying and watching, are you?

81
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:29,119
No, this stuff makes me a little queasy.

82
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:32,318
I’m just going to step over here, but I’m right here for you.

83
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:34,530
I don’t know how I got so lucky.

84
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:38,693
There is a small chance

85
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:42,380
we can determine the sex on ultrasound.

86
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:44,485
- Are you interested?
- No.

87
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:45,520
Yes!

88
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:46,317
No!

89
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:47,268
Yes!

90
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,041
NO!

91
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:49,195
She’ll take yes.

92
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:55,162
And by the way, Doc, if you don’t detect any maleness on the first pass, don’t necessarily assume it’s a girl.

93
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:58,670
The biological father’s only a fraction of a man to begin with.

94
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,324
- Is that right?
- Stop it.

95
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,083
He’s an executive at my studio’s insurance company.

96
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:05,593
He gave Jordan privileged information in order to sleep with her.

97
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:08,292
He’s a real stand-up guy, though, he offered to pay for everything.

98
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:09,410
Oh, jackass.

99
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:10,350
Thank you, sir.

100
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:13,847
Have you told anyone?

101
00:04:14,358 --> 00:04:16,071
Just my assistant Kevin, that’s it.

102
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,605
And Mr. Tripp.

103
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:18,842
I had to tell him.

104
00:04:18,937 --> 00:04:19,769
She wanted to.

105
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:23,415
I was semi-conscious. I had to make sure he wasn’t going to force a B-12 injection on me.

106
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:26,139
You just described the beginning of every great love story.

107
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:27,138
No one else knows?

108
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:30,527
You don’t tell people until after the 12th week, and this is the 12th week.

109
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:32,141
Well, guess what?

110
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,022
What?

111
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:34,877
Start telling people.

112
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,435
We’re having a baby?

113
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:38,611
I’m having a baby.

114
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,707
Relax, you’ll be involved.

115

116
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:03,615
Good morning.

117
00:05:06,136 --> 00:05:07,492
Everybody have a good weekend?

118
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,360
Yeah.

119
00:05:08,503 --> 00:05:09,050
Matt?

120
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:10,263
- Yeah?
- What’s that?

121
00:05:10,363 --> 00:05:11,481
It’s a Christmas tree.

122
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,837
- Really.
- Yeah.

123
00:05:12,956 --> 00:05:14,038
What are you, Linus?

124
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,513
Yes.

125
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:16,302
Yes, I am.

126
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:18,621
I carry with me the true meaning of Christmas.

127
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:20,143
You carry with you a dead Christmas tree.

128
00:05:20,274 --> 00:05:21,273
Okay, Ebenezer.

129
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:24,603
First of all, all Christmas trees are dead; they’ve been chopped down. Second of all,

130
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:28,506
I forgive you for slagging my tree, for I carry with me the true meaning of Christmas.

131
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:29,398
Andy

132
00:05:29,755 --> 00:05:30,611
what have we got?

133
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:32,538
We have a Year in Review theme.

134
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:33,013
Okay.

135
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:33,727
Lucy.

136
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:38,164
Uh, something where the Yugoslavians honor all the famous people who died in 2006

137
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:40,602
and it’s just a series of glamour shots of Milosevic.

138
00:05:40,603 --> 00:05:41,185
Maybe.

139
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:42,957
- Killer spinach on trial.
- Okay.

140
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:44,984
A day without a Mexican, “Brokeback Mountain”…

141
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:46,494
Kim Jong Il…

142
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:47,779
Okay. But what about

143
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,849
Christmas?

144
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:49,800
What about it?

145
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:51,323
It’s our Christmas show.

146
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah, I thought we’d ignore that.

147
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:54,788
- Why?
- ‘Cause Wes always ignored it.

148
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,441
I know he did, but you know why?

149
00:05:56,442 --> 00:05:58,867
‘Cause it’s L.A. and it’s 85 degrees outside.

150
00:05:58,868 --> 00:06:00,104
We’re doing a Christmas show.

151
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:01,841
L.A. just doesn’t feel like Christmas.

152
00:06:01,842 --> 00:06:03,256
We’re going to make it feel like Christmas.

153
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:06,623
We can put your tree on the stage and it’ll be just like Dickensian London.

154
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:10,298
Hey, that happens to be a noble fir. Those things grow to be over 200 feet tall!

155
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:11,939
Yeah, I don’t think that one’s gonna make it.

156
00:06:12,011 --> 00:06:14,949
How is it that I’m Jewish and I’m the only one with Christmas spirit?

157
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:18,136
Come to think of it, how is it that I’m the only Jew in a comedy writers’ room?

158
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:21,443
All good questions, but take some advice from your Protestant brothers:

159
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:24,158
let’s do the Year in Review and screw Christmas.

160
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:25,751
Screw Christmas?

161
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,571
- Uh oh.
- Not on my watch!

162
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:29,795
Look, I hate Los Angeles like everybody else,

163
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:33,065
but I have to work here because in any other part of the country I’m unemployable.

164
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:38,526
So, we are going to deck the halls with boughs of holly. I want to hear sketch ideas with Santa

165
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:41,071
and Rudolph and chestnuts and burning logs.

166
00:06:41,072 --> 00:06:42,391
- Hey, we could set the tree on –
- Shut up!

167
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:47,079
Hey.

168
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:47,722
How are ya?

169
00:06:47,793 --> 00:06:49,827
Good. You know anybody who got hit in the earthquake?

170
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:50,730
There was an earthquake?

171
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:53,335
4.1, about 10 miles northwest of Fontana.

172
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:57,178
About a dozen injuries and some houses came down, but the real damage was to the freeway.

173
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:58,249
- The 10?
- Yeah

174
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,117
What happened to it?

175
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,078
Well, it split in half, basically. There was like a 15 foot chasm.

176
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,172
It’s a miracle no car fell head-first into the thing.

177
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,457
A Christmas miracle.

178
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,289
Thats right!

179
00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:07,680
You know, Wes never did a Christmas show.

180
00:07:07,883 --> 00:07:10,023
I know, he always thought it was cheesy from L.A.

181
00:07:10,024 --> 00:07:12,010
- It doesn’t have to be.
- It doesn’t have to be!

182
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:14,925
This is a TV studio; we can do any kind of magic we want.

183
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:15,948
We could do the magic of Christmas.

184
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,327
We absolutely can.

185
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:20,074
I don’t have anything written yet, but we’re gonna need a lot of snow.

186
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:21,145
That could be a problem.

187
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:23,721
- Why?
- ‘Cause our set-dressing warehouses are in Fontana.

188
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:25,148
- And?
- They collapsed.

189
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:25,873
Really.

190
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:27,848
Well, not all the way. But enough.

191
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:30,381
Thanks for showing up to work.

192
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:31,511
What are you doing?

193
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:34,492
Trying to find out if anyone who works here is injured or dead.

194
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:35,527
Everyone’s fine.

195
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,871
A couple warehouses came down.

196
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:39,630
Those things are made out of Jiffy-Pop. They’ll be back up again at the end of the week.

197
00:07:39,631 --> 00:07:41,259
But in the mean time, we need snow.

198
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,057
What’s he talking about?

199
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:45,221
The three of us are going to bring some holiday romance to this city.

200
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:48,634
I’m the miracle on the Sunset Strip, and you’re, you know, two other guys.

201
00:07:48,765 --> 00:07:49,478
Thank you.

202
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:50,442
Excellent

203
00:07:50,443 --> 00:07:51,370
- Seriously.
- I’m with you.

204
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,976
Our snow is one of those warehouses.

205
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:53,868
Can we make our own?

206
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:54,950
- Sure!
- How?

207
00:07:56,532 --> 00:07:57,150
Bubbles?

208
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,762
Sure, if this were a Don Ho Christmas. Do we really need snow?

209
00:08:00,763 --> 00:08:03,700
Yeah, we need snow! We need snowbanks, snowmen, snowballs –

210
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:04,485
Snowballs!

211
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:05,579
What about them?

212
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,077
The, uh, the things!

213
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:11,229
The, uh, pink marshmallows with the, uh, coconut on top...Shaved coconut!

214
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,811
Beautiful. And they’re indigenous to L.A.

215
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:13,393
No, they’re not.

216
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:14,476
They grow on palm trees!

217
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:15,415
Not ours.

218
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:16,842
- What do ours do?
- Nothing.

219
00:08:17,383 --> 00:08:18,394
This city needs me.

220
00:08:18,643 --> 00:08:20,630
Yeah, we all do. Listen, close the door, would you?

221
00:08:23,353 --> 00:08:26,326
The reason I was late this morning is I was at the doctor’s.

222
00:08:26,754 --> 00:08:28,669
- What’s wrong?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

223
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:31,071
I’m fine. It was an OB/GYN.

224
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,236
Jordan’s pregnant.

225
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:35,031
- You’re kidding.
- You’re kidding.

226
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:36,530
- No.
- Who’s the father?

227
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:39,658
The guy from the insurance company who outed me.

228
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:40,467
Wow.

229
00:08:41,478 --> 00:08:44,487
Yeah. He wants to pay for it, but that’s it, so

230
00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:48,197
I’m going to have him shove his wallet up his ass.

231
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:49,024
- Danny?
- Yeah.

232
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,415
Why were you at the doctor?

233
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:53,091
- Hm?
- Why were you at the doctor?

234
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:57,420
I wanted to be.

235
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:05,522
How’s his mood?

236
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,365
SON OF A HOLY BITCH!

237
00:09:08,152 --> 00:09:08,901
Never mind.

238
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:12,374
SON OF A HOLY, GOD-FORSAKEN BITCH!

239
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:14,538
I’m gonna get a gun.

240
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,358
I swear to God I am!

241
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:18,641
- Take your medicine.
- There is no medicine!

242
00:09:18,853 --> 00:09:20,363
There is no law!

243
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:21,648
What happened?

244
00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:24,276
We did the news.

245
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:27,975
Which, by the way, we’re required by the federal government to do, that’s been the deal.

246
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:33,114
We get free use of the airwaves to broadcast your entertainment shows, in exchange for which we provide the public

247
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,028
with informational programming.

248
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:38,418
We call that the “NBS Nightly News”.

249
00:09:38,657 --> 00:09:42,760
At the moment we’re fighting two wars, so the news division thinks we should cover that, and I agree with them!

250
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:44,068
What happened, Jack?

251
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:52,295
An embedded reporter did a live remote last night about school rebuilding in Charikar, Afghanistan.

252
00:09:52,477 --> 00:09:54,094
Our guy’s interviewing a private

253
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:56,794
when an RPG screams over their head.

254
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:57,627
What’s an RPG?

255
00:09:57,628 --> 00:09:59,292
A rocket propelled grenade.

256
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:02,777
It explodes into the rocks, and the private shouts a word.

257
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:03,787
What word?

258
00:10:04,215 --> 00:10:05,488
A word I don’t use with women.

259
00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:07,141
- He said “f—“
- Yes.

260
00:10:07,557 --> 00:10:08,770
Same word anyone would use.

261
00:10:08,771 --> 00:10:13,052
Same word Mr. Rogers would use if a rocket propelled grenade missed him by 50 feet.

262
00:10:13,053 --> 00:10:13,872
Don’t tell me.

263
00:10:13,873 --> 00:10:16,656
The FCC says it was indecent.

264
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:22,483
They’re going to fine us $325,000 per affiliate that aired the news report!

265
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:23,494
- That’s insane!
- No kidding.

266
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:25,205
It was a live news report!

267
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:26,240
You have to understand

268
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,570
that pro-family groups support our troops in this time of war

269
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:33,864
just as long as we don’t have to see or hear what our troops fighting a war looks and sounds like.

270
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:37,307
What do you need?

271
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:40,447
Well, I wanted to tell you

272
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,837
that I’m pregnant.

273
00:10:44,884 --> 00:10:47,417
I’m pregnant; I’m, I’m due in the middle of May.

274
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:48,262
What?

275
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:49,772
I’m pregnant?

276
00:10:52,356 --> 00:10:53,224
You’re having a baby?

277
00:10:53,462 --> 00:10:54,092
Yes.

278
00:10:55,757 --> 00:10:56,780
That’s fantastic.

279
00:10:56,935 --> 00:10:57,839
- Really?
- Yeah.

280
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,707
Who’s the father?

281
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:01,180
An old boyfriend I got together with for a night.

282
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:04,245
- It’s not very, you know…
- I’m sorry I yelled.

283
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:06,445
- Have a seat.
- Fight ‘em, Jack!

284
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:08,788
Take them to federal court; it’s a First Amendment issue!

285
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:10,925
First Amendment doesn’t apply to broadcast television.

286
00:11:10,926 --> 00:11:13,491
They’ll look ridiculous in public and they’ll back down.

287
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:14,900
- Says you.
- They will.

288
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:20,969
If they don’t, they’ll pull our transponder license, the one we use to beam our programs to the affiliates.

289
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:23,161
Then they’ll take the licenses from the affiliates…

290
00:11:24,023 --> 00:11:25,334
they’ll end the network.

291
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:28,369
It’s the news, Jack. Lawyer up.

292
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:33,005
Congratulations on the baby.

293
00:11:41,473 --> 00:11:42,672
Merry Christmas!

294
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,061
- Oh, God, I’m sorry!
- What are you doing?

295
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:58,234
I was going to throw my beach stuff in the laundry.

296
00:11:58,365 --> 00:12:00,426
- When were you at the beach?
- Yesterday.

297
00:12:00,913 --> 00:12:02,411
Isn’t the sand on the floor now?

298
00:12:02,524 --> 00:12:04,285
That’s better than a broken washing machine.

299
00:12:04,446 --> 00:12:08,904
Wouldn’t shaking the sand out of the towel back at the beach be the best of all, and could we turn off

300
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:10,403
“Hot Fun in the Summertime”?

301
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:11,733
Sure, what would you like to listen to?

302
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:14,112
Mr. Bing Crosby, Mr. Burl Ives…

303
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:16,922
- Perry Como.
- Mr. Perry Como, wait. Was that a..

304
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:17,990
dig at Christmas?

305
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,077
At you.

306
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:21,514
Okay. Am I still on for racquetball at lunch?

307
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:23,649
No, you’re not. Zane’s out sick the whole week.

308
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,242
- Oh, man.
- You want me to find you someone else?

309
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:28,424
It’s not the racquetball, it’s his trumpet. We’re not going to have his trumpet?

310
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:29,851
- Hey!
- What do you know?

311
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:33,252
Go ahead and write in all the snow you want; we just bought a truckload of coconuts.

312
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:34,192
Excellent.

313
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:36,000
Hey, did you hear Zane’s out for the week?

314
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,176
Yeah, but Willy says he’s got a good sub.

315
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:39,805
- Hey, you wanted us?
- Yeah.

316
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:41,055
- I’ll see ya!
- Yeah.

317
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,577
Turn it off.

318
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:44,481
What’d’you need?

319
00:12:45,051 --> 00:12:46,859
Any Christmas ideas you might have.

320
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,107
There’s no such thing as the Star of Bethlehem.

321
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:51,336
Jesus was born in North Africa.

322
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:54,250
How come in paintings it always looks like he’s one of the Bee-Gees?

323
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:57,057
All right, Christmas ideas that don’t shriek of meanness.

324
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:59,090
Hey, your people stole Jesus from my people.

325
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,368
Perhaps, but this is about everyone raising a glass of wassail.

326
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:03,450
Of what?

327
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:05,413
Wassail. “Here we go a-wassailing…”

328
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:06,507
It was a comet.

329
00:13:07,696 --> 00:13:08,779
- What?
- The star.

330
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,050
Of Bethlehem; they saw a comet and they went to the manger with a lamb

331
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:13,156
a camel

332
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:14,785
- and a kid with a fife.
- A drum!

333
00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:17,616
A boy on a drum! A little drummer, there’s a whole song.

334
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:20,892
It doesn’t matter; go downstairs and help these guys pitch me.

335
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:23,235
This could be a good chance to let Lucy get to know me.

336
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,614
He likes Lucy now.

337
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:26,279
With the eyes and the face and everything.

338
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,124
She’s got a great face.

339
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:27,980
Hey, step back.

340
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:28,824
What, I like her face!

341
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,287
Aren’t you about a hundred years old?

342
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:31,739
Aren’t you only marginally talented?

343
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,535
All right, Santa’s helpers? Out the door.

344
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:34,986
It’s a great face, but the mouth?

345
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:36,045
I will beat you up.

346
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:38,399
Hah hah, good one, Tommy. You’re as cute as a button.

347
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:41,516
Mondays, it’s like the dementia grows by…

348
00:13:41,517 --> 00:13:44,180
I’m not even talking to anybody right now. Suzanne!

349
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:44,644
Yeah

350
00:13:46,142 --> 00:13:50,435
I called K-Earth 101, I told them Matthew Albie wants to hear some Perry Como.

351
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:52,600
- You didn’t.
- Nah, Christmas joke.

352
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:54,920
Can you get me Harriet?

353
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:56,978
She’s out at lunch with Luke Scott.

354
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:57,537
All right.

355
00:13:57,787 --> 00:13:58,512
Wait, what?

356
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:01,687
What kind of jerk has their agent set up a lunch?

357
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:03,886
Well, I don’t know, Harriet, what kind of jerks are there?

358
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:04,849
I mean, what are my choices?

359
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,967
I should have said no.

360
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:07,632
- But you didn’t.
- It’s Christmas.

361
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,285
What are your plans?

362
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,415
Well, we’re off until the second week in January

363
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:16,029
so Jeannie and Samantha and I rented a little place in Idaho and I’m gonna take skiing lessons.

364
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,539
I didn’t mean for the holidays, I meant for the future.

365
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:20,097
What do you mean?

366
00:14:20,782 --> 00:14:22,637
What are your plans for the future?

367
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:28,310
Really just the show Friday night, and then the skiing lessons, and then the next show.

368
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:29,737
How about a movie?

369
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:35,006
I’d love to. I can’t on weeknights, but pretty much every Saturday or Sunday is fine.

370
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:36,671
Yeah, or we could make a movie.

371
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:42,118
Are you offering me a job?

372
00:14:42,294 --> 00:14:44,007
Welcome to the lunch. Yes.

373
00:14:45,707 --> 00:14:47,777
You talking about the Rolling Stones movie, or something else?

374
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:51,071
It’s not the Rolling Stones, it’s Brian Jones, who formed the Rolling Stones.

375
00:14:51,072 --> 00:14:53,023
His girlfriend, Anita Pallenberg,

376
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:54,783
ran off with Keith Richards.

377
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,852
Heath Ledger’s playing the part.

378
00:14:56,971 --> 00:14:58,577
And you want me to play Tammy Wynette?

379
00:14:58,743 --> 00:14:59,254
No

380
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:01,800
I want you to play Anita Pallenberg.

381
00:15:07,946 --> 00:15:10,800
You know, sometimes it’s hard to tell with you, Luke, when you’re kidding –

382
00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:12,667
You’ve got an ability well beyond comedy.

383
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:17,545
I’ve boarded you for 20 shooting days which would spread across your hiatus weeks and

384
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:20,137
you’d get an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

385
00:15:23,602 --> 00:15:26,076
Are you still mad at how the agent set up the lunch?

386
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:30,904
Here’s what we have so far:

387
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:34,722
One of Santa’s reindeer, mildly traumatized by an accident last year,

388
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:39,302
is reluctant to pull the sleigh, and so Santa brings in the Reindeer Whisperer.

389
00:15:40,658 --> 00:15:44,404
That's fantastic! Lucy, I love that idea, I want to do it.

390
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:46,326
I want to go with you guys to Matt and Danny.

391
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:47,635
It was Darius’ pitch.

392
00:15:47,636 --> 00:15:51,425
Then let me tell you why it’s iffy. The Horse Whisperer was, like, 10 years ago.

393
00:15:51,426 --> 00:15:53,970
I tell you what else, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer got their names wrong

394
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:55,932
It’s not Donner, it’s Dunder.

395
00:15:56,277 --> 00:15:58,001
And Blixum, not Blixen.

396
00:15:58,002 --> 00:16:01,831
We Three Wise Guys. The characters from “GoodFellas” on camels.

397
00:16:01,832 --> 00:16:03,330
Hang on. It’s not Dunder.

398
00:16:04,721 --> 00:16:07,786
“And he whistled and shouted and called them by name.

399
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:11,389
‘On Dasher, on Dancer, on Prancer and Vixen.

400
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,196
On Comet, on Cupid, on Dunder and Blixen.’

401
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,408
That was ‘Twas the Night Before Christmas,

402
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:19,181
a white guy writing a song for Montgomery Ward screwed up the names.

403
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,237
And ‘Twas the Night Before Christmas was written by Jesse Jackson?

404
00:16:22,344 --> 00:16:23,617
We Three Wise Guys –

405
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:26,150
Nowhere in the Bible does it say there were three of them.

406
00:16:26,493 --> 00:16:29,621
There was never a camel, they didn’t travel from afar, it was six miles.

407
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:31,239
And everything in the song was wrong.

408
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:32,987
It was Lucy’s pitch.

409
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:34,509
Beautiful job, babe.

410
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:35,651
Simon

411
00:16:36,116 --> 00:16:40,694
tell Lucy about the time you were arrested on about 43 larceny counts in high school?

412
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:43,406
Okay, cool, why don’t you tell her about the time when everybody thought you were gay in high school?

413
00:16:43,407 --> 00:16:45,547
It’s a big help having you guys here.

414
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:46,581
Check it out.

415
00:16:46,763 --> 00:16:48,155
We really do need to work.

416
00:16:48,156 --> 00:16:49,487
We’re going to make some prototype snow.

417
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:50,474
Excellent.

418
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:51,960
How do you open a coconut?

419
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:54,958
It’s actually pretty hard, they do it with, like, a machete.

420
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:55,838
Nah.

421
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:57,025
Stand back

422
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:58,690
Pieces might fly!

423
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:21,224
“Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad wants to double his country’s population to 120 million people.

424
00:17:21,379 --> 00:17:23,936
In a recent speech to Parliament, Ahmadinejad – “

425
00:17:23,937 --> 00:17:26,096
She’s got the slightest little overbite.

426
00:17:26,097 --> 00:17:27,618
We dipped in the frame twice.

427
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:28,581
Isn’t that cute?

428
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:30,211
Howie may have been off his mark in the monologue.

429
00:17:30,212 --> 00:17:31,673
You want to play some racquetball?

430
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,469
I’m meeting with product placement people.

431
00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:35,404
Hey, when’s Jordan due?

432
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:36,676
Middle of May.

433
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:38,924
What’s she going to do about the upfronts?

434
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:41,112
What is she going to do about the upfronts?

435
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:44,789
The network’s going to have to make them earlier.

436
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,132
Or later. They can’t do that.

437
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,606
She’s gonna have to let someone else make the presentation.

438
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:52,745
She can’t do that, either. It’s her first schedule; it’s the biggest day of the year for her.

439
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:53,661
- Danny?
- Yeah?

440
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,980
You’re caring more about other people than you usually do.

441
00:17:56,063 --> 00:17:57,966
You’re the one who just said, “What’s she going to do about the upfronts?”

442
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:00,702
Mine was an idle question, then I moved on to other things in my head.

443
00:18:00,703 --> 00:18:01,495
So was mine.

444
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:03,017
No, it wasn’t. It was genuine interest.

445
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:04,789
Well, in case you haven’t noticed, she’s doing a good job.

446
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:06,419
And there you just defended her.

447
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,358
What’s wrong with that?

448
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,678
For starters, no one’s attacking her.

449
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:10,058
- Go write!
- Okay.

450
00:18:15,852 --> 00:18:16,375
What?

451
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:17,600
- Nothing.
- Say it.

452
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:18,944
- Nothing.
- Just say it out loud!

453
00:18:18,945 --> 00:18:20,145
- Nothing.
- Okay.

454
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:35,385
Hello.

455
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:36,990
- Hello.
- How was Luke?

456
00:18:37,371 --> 00:18:38,572
- Good.
- Lucas.

457
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:40,094
- Good.
- Lunch with Luke.

458
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:41,783
- What is your problem?
- It’s Luke.

459
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:44,318
I need to see Danny.

460
00:18:44,484 --> 00:18:45,174
About what?

461
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:48,005
About a private conversation between me and Danny.

462
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:49,444
I’m an executive producer, too.

463
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:51,656
Yeah, but I need to speak to the one who’s important.

464
00:18:51,657 --> 00:18:52,667
About Luke?

465
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:54,310
All right

466
00:18:55,191 --> 00:18:57,141
Why don’t we just get this over with now?

467
00:18:57,605 --> 00:19:00,209
I’ve been offered a part in his Rolling Stones movie.

468
00:19:01,696 --> 00:19:02,671
Anita Pallenberg?

469
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:03,694
That’s right.

470
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,644
How did you know?

471
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,785
I didn’t, but you’re great casting for that.

472
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:09,806
- Really?
- Yeah, it’s a great part.

473
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:14,742
Brian, Keith, Mick Jagger, they all considered her a musical confidant. “Paint it Black” was all her.

474
00:19:14,743 --> 00:19:17,797
You’re not going to throw cold water on this because it’s Luke directing?

475
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:21,020
Harry, I don’t think you’re getting how big a break this is for you.

476
00:19:21,115 --> 00:19:21,864
No

477
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,683
I’m getting it. I didn’t think that you’d be getting it.

478
00:19:24,684 --> 00:19:28,145
Of course I get it. We’ll make the schedule work any way we need to.

479
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,795
He says he can shoot me out in 20 days.

480
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:35,377
And he’s boarded them during hiatus weeks.

481
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:37,197
Whatever, it’s Anita Pallenberg!

482
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:39,445
Any of those guys would have broken up the band for her.

483
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:41,490
I never would have expected this from you.

484
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:42,622
Why not?

485
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,893
No matter what, I’ve always been your biggest fan.

486
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:49,817
Thank you, Matthew.

487
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,897
Do you know what else is great?

488
00:19:53,421 --> 00:19:57,167
That Luke is able to spend $60 million of Paramount’s money to date you again.

489
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:00,105
Ow!

490
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,483
Abs of granite, baby. Hard as a rock.

491
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:04,926
You think he cast me so he can sleep with me?

492
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:07,983
No, I think he cast you so he can marry you and sleep with other people

493
00:20:08,482 --> 00:20:10,706
Ow! When did this stomach happen?

494
00:20:10,707 --> 00:20:11,753
Leg-lifts with Jeannie.

495
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:15,005
Don’t hurt yourself, Anita.

496
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:18,858
I’m going into Danny’s office because he is a real man.

497
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,762
Okay.

498
00:20:21,775 --> 00:20:22,370
Danny –

499
00:20:22,703 --> 00:20:23,357
Yeah?

500
00:20:23,392 --> 00:20:24,843
I’ll come back later.

501
00:20:24,844 --> 00:20:25,616
Okay.

502
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:30,525
Why do I even talk to you?

503
00:20:30,727 --> 00:20:32,273
Little thing called ‘macho’.

504
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:35,984
- Say it!
- GET OUT!

505
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:45,957
Hi.

506
00:20:48,395 --> 00:20:49,097
Sorry.

507
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:51,632
I’m eating for two.

508
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:52,559
At least.

509
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:54,724
Hey, are you guys doing a Christmas show?

510
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:55,532
Yeah.

511
00:20:55,711 --> 00:20:58,839
Yeah, we are; Matt’s got a real head of steam about it.

512
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:01,046
We’re buying all the coconuts we can find.

513
00:21:01,047 --> 00:21:02,830
You need coconuts to do the Christmas show?

514
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:04,459
I didn’t hear you with the roll in your mouth.

515
00:21:05,173 --> 00:21:07,349
You need coconuts for a Christmas show?

516
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,384
To make snow.

517
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:11,347
Well, I’m glad you’re doing it. I miss home.

518
00:21:11,348 --> 00:21:12,572
Charlottesville, Virginia?

519
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:14,879
That’s right. Most people think I’m from Massachusetts.

520
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,319
No, you went to school in Massachusetts.

521
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,103
Yeah.

522
00:21:21,256 --> 00:21:22,910
Have you thought about the upfronts?

523
00:21:22,911 --> 00:21:27,774
You could go into labor in the middle of presenting your fall schedule in front of 3000 advertisers.

524
00:21:27,775 --> 00:21:29,237
Yeah, it’s gonna be my gimmick.

525
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:30,509
Seriously.

526
00:21:30,614 --> 00:21:31,732
I’ll figure something out.

527
00:21:32,612 --> 00:21:33,433
Okay.

528
00:21:36,252 --> 00:21:37,881
Are you meeting someone in the building for lunch?

529
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:42,615
No, no; I just came over because I realized the upfronts were right around your due date.

530
00:21:42,758 --> 00:21:43,709
Why didn’t you just call?

531
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,934
You’re right across the street

532
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:49,840
and I’m a nut about exercise. I’m in very good shape.

533
00:21:50,994 --> 00:21:51,815
Okay.

534
00:21:54,018 --> 00:21:54,898
Okay.

535
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:28,033
This is what I’m talking about.

536
00:22:28,034 --> 00:22:30,804
Hey, miracle! Check it out. Rodney!

537
00:22:33,397 --> 00:22:34,432
Excellent.

538
00:22:36,344 --> 00:22:37,747
It’s a winter wonderland.

539
00:22:37,748 --> 00:22:39,733
Yeah, and then later you can make pina coladas.

540
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:40,910
Keep it up!

541
00:22:48,971 --> 00:22:49,994
- Cal?
- Yeah?

542
00:22:50,196 --> 00:22:51,279
What, uh...

543
00:22:51,956 --> 00:22:52,825
what’s going on with this?

544
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:53,919
What do you mean?

545
00:22:54,061 --> 00:22:54,906
What’s he doing?

546
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:57,403
There’re going to be reindeer up in the balcony; he’s waving at them.

547
00:22:57,404 --> 00:22:59,004
He’s giving the Nazi salute.

548
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:00,967
Nah, he’s waving at the reindeer!

549
00:23:00,968 --> 00:23:02,560
Why wouldn’t the reindeer be with him?

550
00:23:02,858 --> 00:23:05,106
Well, when you start to apply logic to Santa Claus, Matt…

551
00:23:05,107 --> 00:23:08,614
All right, let’s set logistics aside. He’s saying “Heil Hitler.”

552
00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:09,696
I think you’re reading too much into it.

553
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:11,718
He’s giving the Nazi salute.

554
00:23:14,342 --> 00:23:16,067
Well, now that you’ve said it, that’s all I can see.

555
00:23:16,068 --> 00:23:17,506
It’s all anybody can see.

556
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:19,385
- He’s got the crazy eyes too, doesn’t he.
- Yeah.

557
00:23:19,527 --> 00:23:22,239
- Let’s get rid of demented Santa Claus!
- Thank you.

558
00:23:26,024 --> 00:23:26,702
Good morning.

559
00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:28,462
Good morning. Thank you for the hat.

560
00:23:28,712 --> 00:23:32,993
It came with the red velvet miniskirt and garters. Would it make you feel better if I wore that?

561
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:33,874
It wouldn’t hurt.

562
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:36,940
I was just trying to save quarters for the laundry by doing it here.

563
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:37,963
I understand.

564
00:23:39,355 --> 00:23:40,651
Ah, look at this.

565
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:45,087
This is nice: everybody working together, pitching our Christmas sketches for a Christmas show.

566
00:23:45,484 --> 00:23:46,400
Let me hear what you’ve got.

567
00:23:46,495 --> 00:23:47,851
Christmas is a sham, Matt.

568
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:48,683
It’s a ruse.

569
00:23:48,684 --> 00:23:50,788
- It is!
- Jesus was born in 5 B.C.

570
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:52,144
And he wasn’t born in December.

571
00:23:52,145 --> 00:23:55,640
He couldn’t have been, because the description in Luke of the shepherd would put it in Spring or Fall.

572
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:58,733
And it turns out that the image of Santa Claus, as we know it,

573
00:23:58,935 --> 00:24:04,953
was invented in 1931 by an artist named Hayden Sunbloom who had been commissioned to do a portrait of Sinterklaas

574
00:24:05,073 --> 00:24:06,132
by the Coca-Cola company.

575
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,570
The two of you brought them all over to the dark side?

576
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:12,566
Hey, I just said there was no Star of Bethlehem and then everybody got on the internet for two days.

577
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:13,458
Jesus was African.

578
00:24:13,755 --> 00:24:14,635
It was a comet.

579
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,574
Or possibly Ursa Major in the Northern sky –

580
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:20,297
I don’t care! It doesn’t matter!

581
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:22,319
What the hell did you do to my tree?

582
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,853
I was drying my socks.

583
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:25,804
All right.

584
00:24:26,317 --> 00:24:27,803
Context used to matter.

585
00:24:27,993 --> 00:24:29,623
We’re not living in the land of used-to.

586
00:24:29,908 --> 00:24:31,740
I understand that, Mike. I’m explaining it to Jack.

587
00:24:31,741 --> 00:24:32,655
I understand it, too.

588
00:24:32,786 --> 00:24:36,116
NPR was able to run wiretaps of John Gotti swearing

589
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:38,022
because it was understood he was a bad guy.

590
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,674
As opposed to a soldier, who’s a role model.

591
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:44,051
Yeah. Uh, hang on.

592
00:24:46,977 --> 00:24:48,047
What do you need?

593
00:24:48,332 --> 00:24:49,486
Can I sit in on the meeting?

594
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:51,519
No. How’d you get past my secretary?

595
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,506
By telling her I was invited to sit in on the meeting.

596
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:56,122
This is corporate news, it’s not entertainment.

597
00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:57,395
Let me sit in.

598
00:24:58,488 --> 00:25:00,308
I’ll totally behave, I won’t say a word.

599
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:01,342
Jack?

600
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,579
Yeah.

601
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:04,066
Sit in.

602
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:10,414
Jordan McDeere, she’s auditing.

603
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:15,290
You want, at any price, to avoid a war with federal regulators.

604
00:25:15,385 --> 00:25:16,503
Well….

605
00:25:17,105 --> 00:25:18,472
- Why?
- They’ll win.

606
00:25:18,615 --> 00:25:21,077
They’ll block any media related mergers, that’s Macau.

607
00:25:21,267 --> 00:25:25,085
They can bounce you out of the Spectrum auction, and your competitors would get greater broadcast power.

608
00:25:25,086 --> 00:25:26,928
Is there a chance they’d single us out for –

609
00:25:27,035 --> 00:25:27,892
do you need a menu?

610
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:28,570
No.

611
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,197
Apricot danish.

612
00:25:30,352 --> 00:25:32,885
Good. Is there a chance they’d single us out for –

613
00:25:32,886 --> 00:25:35,192
Special indecency treatment, you can count on it.

614
00:25:35,276 --> 00:25:36,429
Yeah, Ian’s right.

615
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,987
You’ve got shows where young people are talking about sex,

616
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:42,531
having sex, having homosexual sex, sex with strangers, threesomes…

617
00:25:42,532 --> 00:25:44,398
they’re going to suddenly decide to take a closer look.

618
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:47,264
Hey, if you know of these shows, send them to me. It’s development season.

619
00:25:49,707 --> 00:25:50,563
I’m not even here.

620
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:52,478
They’re offering a good option: time-delay the news.

621
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:53,263
No!

622
00:25:53,453 --> 00:25:55,059
A five-second delay, who’s gonna care?

623
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,926
Our news producers and reporters, for one.

624
00:25:56,927 --> 00:26:00,209
They’re already leaving the networks for cable over credibility issues.

625
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,458
What’s going to happen when we –

626
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:02,588
You don’t want to time-delay the news

627
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:03,302
Okay.

628
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,651
We fly to Washington,

629
00:26:04,652 --> 00:26:10,026
we meet with the FCC chair and see if we can get a greatly reduced fine if we agree to give away time for PSAs.

630
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,489
It’s a face-saving gesture for everyone.

631
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,892
NBS News should apologize because somebody shot at one of their reporters?

632
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:19,625
Well, that’s it.

633
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:21,565
Obviously that’s not it!

634
00:26:22,017 --> 00:26:23,753
Then I go back to what I said at the beginning:

635
00:26:23,754 --> 00:26:27,012
take on the FCC and you need to know the cost of losing.

636
00:27:02,675 --> 00:27:03,662
What are you doing here?

637
00:27:03,817 --> 00:27:05,470
I came to hear that guy.

638
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,406
He’s a sub; our regular guy’s sick this week.

639
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,739
So is our regular trombone player,

640
00:27:12,143 --> 00:27:14,486
and his sub told me to hear this guy.

641
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:16,092
He’s good.

642
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:19,029
That’s why I was surprised to see him playing in your band.

643
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:22,652
Get your feet of the chair, talk show.

644
00:27:33,766 --> 00:27:34,861
Thanks, guys

645
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,750
4:30 Friday for a 5:30 dress. Thanks a lot. 

646
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:41,965
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.

647
00:27:41,966 --> 00:27:43,832
I’m Danny, the executive producer.

648
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:46,556
- Thanks a lot for sitting in today.
- Well, I appreciate the gig.

649
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,340
You want one full-time?

650
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:49,791
No, I can’t do that.

651
00:27:49,995 --> 00:27:50,697
Why not?

652
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,028
Fella I’m sitting in for did me a favor.

653
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:55,823
All right. Well, you should know Kevin Eubanks is sitting down there

654
00:27:56,144 --> 00:27:58,844
and I think you got a job at The Tonight Show if you want it.

655
00:27:58,972 --> 00:28:02,695
No, they’ve got their horn section. I’m grateful for this, but I appreciate it.

656
00:28:03,052 --> 00:28:04,848
Whoa, whoa, wait up.

657
00:28:07,856 --> 00:28:08,662
Where’re you from?

658
00:28:09,185 --> 00:28:11,956
I don’t want to get anyone in trouble, man. The guy’s doing me a favor.

659
00:28:12,075 --> 00:28:13,086
No one’s in trouble.

660
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:14,926
I’m from New Orleans.

661
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:24,192
How could Jesus’ birth have taken place 4 years before the birth of Christ?

662
00:28:24,193 --> 00:28:26,273
How come Europeans decided he looked like Doug Henning?

663
00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:27,641
It doesn’t matter!

664
00:28:27,642 --> 00:28:29,092
Shepherds don’t work in December.

665
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:30,852
Another expert theologian heard from.

666
00:28:30,853 --> 00:28:33,660
Yet the Gospels say he was born during the reign of Herod the Great

667
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:37,953
and according to the historian Flavius Josephson, Herod died in 4 B.C.

668
00:28:37,954 --> 00:28:39,142
Flavius Josephson.

669
00:28:39,143 --> 00:28:42,459
The Immaculate Conception has nothing to do with the birth of Jesus.

670
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,993
I think it probably does.

671
00:28:43,994 --> 00:28:45,397
In describing Mary

672
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:50,844
the original Hebrew text uses the word ‘alma’, which means ‘to a young woman of marriageable age’,

673
00:28:50,974 --> 00:28:53,103
not the word ‘bethela’, which means ‘virgin’.

674
00:28:53,104 --> 00:28:54,139
And you’re getting this on…

675
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,424
Virginbirthsdebunked…

676
00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:56,839
- Okay.
- .org.

677
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:00,038
Excuse me.

678
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,333
You see, Lucy,

679
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:04,947
I’m a bit of an astronomy buff.

680
00:29:05,185 --> 00:29:06,933
Loser. The word is loser.

681
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:12,238
They calculated the number of homes with children and the average weight of 2 presents per child.

682
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:13,629
What’d they come up with?

683
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:22,552
He’d need 214,200 reindeer pulling a sled weighing 321,000 tons at 3000 times the speed of sound.

684
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,775
Zane’s not out sick this week.

685
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:27,572
What’s going on?

686
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:33,662
Players all over town – here, The Tonight Show, session players, pit bands – they’re trying to do it under the radar, but

687
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:35,101
they’re calling in sick.

688
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:35,566
Why?

689
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:40,156
They heard there were basically homeless musicians in town from New Orleans.

690
00:29:40,597 --> 00:29:42,250
They’re sleeping on people’s couches. 

691
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:46,710
By the way, if our trumpet player’s any indication, they can blow the doors off any room they feel like.

692
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:52,158
The L.A. guys are trying to get them a union card and a pay check so they can send some presents home.

693
00:29:53,288 --> 00:29:55,120
We should pay the guys who are calling in sick.

694
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:58,332
I had a different idea. Is there a sketch you feel like you can cut right now?

695
00:29:58,416 --> 00:29:59,165
Sure.

696
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:02,721
I could cut “Immaculate, My Ass: HBO’s Ho Ho Hos and Hookers at the Pole”.

697
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:04,933
Good. We might need 4 minutes in the middle of the show.

698
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:05,577
For what?

699
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:07,527
I’ll let you know by the end of the day.

700
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,619
You spoken to Jordan since Monday?

701
00:30:11,214 --> 00:30:12,070
- Me?
- Yeah.

702
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:13,581
No, not really.

703
00:30:13,973 --> 00:30:15,495
You don’t know what she’s doing about the upfronts?

704
00:30:16,054 --> 00:30:16,637
No.

705
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:19,407
What did you mean, not really?

706
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:21,512
I’ve driven by her house a couple times.

707
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:22,689
- Really.
- Yeah.

708
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,782
Well, that’s gotta take you back, huh, moon-doggie?

709
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,102
Her house is on the way to work.

710
00:30:26,103 --> 00:30:27,664
If you’re driving from Tijuana.

711
00:30:27,665 --> 00:30:28,652
Leave me alone.

712
00:30:40,826 --> 00:30:42,705
15 minutes, everyone! 15 minutes!

713
00:30:42,706 --> 00:30:48,920
Last time I was in this theatre was 15 years ago to hear Caruso sing “Vesti la giubba” from Pagliacci.

714
00:30:49,086 --> 00:30:49,942
Is that right?

715
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,179
No.

716
00:30:51,528 --> 00:30:54,394
Caruso died 15 years before I was born.

717
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:57,011
Why do young people have no sense of the past?

718
00:30:57,012 --> 00:30:58,235
Caruso’s dead?

719
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,437
Yeah.

720
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,517
Leave this poor girl alone. How are you feeling?

721
00:31:02,518 --> 00:31:03,623
I can’t stop eating.

722
00:31:03,624 --> 00:31:05,657
- Oh, enjoy that.
- I am.

723
00:31:05,882 --> 00:31:07,203
Where’s Jack?

724
00:31:07,476 --> 00:31:10,247
I don’t know. He should be along.

725
00:31:10,617 --> 00:31:14,138
Down the corridor, down the stairs, dressing room D.

726
00:31:14,828 --> 00:31:15,862
I know it well.

727
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:18,217
“Good evening, I’m Simon Styles.”

728
00:31:18,218 --> 00:31:24,331
“And I’m Harriet Hayes. Just after a man purchased a Picasso painting for $139 million, the seller,

729
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:29,522
Las Vegas mogul Steve Wynn, accidentally hit the painting, creating a finger-sized hole in the canvas.

730
00:31:29,523 --> 00:31:35,874
Wynn apologized, and attributed the fault to Retinitis Pigmentosa, an ocular disease that damages peripheral vision.

731
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:41,940
The buyer then punched Wynn in the face, apologized, and attributed the fault to Reflexive Affluentis Magoo,

732
00:31:42,071 --> 00:31:45,675
an emotional disease that makes him want to punch rich blind people in the face.”

733
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:49,604
“A new study released by the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University

734
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:53,160
finds that most men are almost always thinking about sex.

735
00:31:53,316 --> 00:31:55,373
In a soon to be published companion study,

736
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:59,048
researchers hope to be able to prove through a series of controlled experiments

737
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:01,462
that water quenches your thirst.

738
00:32:01,688 --> 00:32:03,496
The Pentagon announced today that –“

739
00:32:03,497 --> 00:32:05,142
- Hey!
- Don’t let me stop you.

740
00:32:06,165 --> 00:32:07,913
- How you doing, man?
- Styles

741
00:32:09,876 --> 00:32:11,505
- You got your tickets?
- Front row.

742
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:13,443
I get to heckle Danny.

743
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:14,728
These are for you.

744
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,218
They’re beautiful.

745
00:32:17,324 --> 00:32:18,929
Let me put them in my dressing room.

746
00:32:19,726 --> 00:32:21,308
The Steve Wynn joke’s funny.

747
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:23,556
Well, he’s a very nice guy; you think he’s going to mind?

748
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:25,197
Only if he’s watching.

749
00:32:25,484 --> 00:32:27,696
- I was happy to hear your deal closed.
- Me, too.

750
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,480
Wasn’t hard, you’re paying me scale.

751
00:32:29,587 --> 00:32:30,431
That’ll change.

752
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,072
Everybody around here happy for you?

753
00:32:32,382 --> 00:32:33,297
- Yeah.
- Matt?

754
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:34,998
Yeah, well

755
00:32:35,723 --> 00:32:36,841
you know, yeah.

756
00:32:37,864 --> 00:32:39,993
He thinks you’re trying to date me again, but he’s just –

757
00:32:39,994 --> 00:32:40,825
I am.

758
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:43,786
Huh?

759
00:32:43,977 --> 00:32:45,606
I am trying to date you again.

760
00:32:46,572 --> 00:32:48,070
- Really?
- Yeah.

761
00:32:51,294 --> 00:32:53,256
But that’s not why you cast me, right?

762
00:32:53,257 --> 00:32:54,112
No.

763
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,432
I cast you ‘cause you’ll be good.

764
00:32:58,001 --> 00:32:59,012
 I can do both.

765
00:33:01,129 --> 00:33:01,974
Okay.

766
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:06,113
Did what I just say make you uncomfortable?

767
00:33:06,362 --> 00:33:06,874
No.

768
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:10,834
Five minutes, please. Five minutes to air!

769
00:33:12,536 --> 00:33:13,916
You should go upstairs.

770
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:15,652
Eat ‘em up.

771
00:33:27,403 --> 00:33:30,888
In five, four, three…

772
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,948
“Hi, fella.”

773
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:57,444
“You wanna step over here a second?”

774
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:00,310
“Oh, now who’re you?”

775
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:03,640
“I’m Chris Hansen from Dateline.

776
00:34:04,797 --> 00:34:10,565
Can I ask what the heck you were doing, coming to see a 12-year-old girl

777
00:34:10,957 --> 00:34:12,843
in the middle of the night?”

778
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,496
“She wrote me a letter.”

779
00:34:15,912 --> 00:34:17,327
Where’s the snow?

780
00:34:17,328 --> 00:34:18,362
We accidentally cooked it.

781
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,955
- The lights?
- Yeah.

782
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,253
Are we gonna have it by the end?

783
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,465
They’re shaving more coconuts right now.

784
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:29,126
“…just figured, ‘I’m gonna go to the house of an underage girl in the middle of the night.’”

785
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:33,043
“That’s what I do.”

786
00:34:33,495 --> 00:34:35,136
“A disturbing twist:

787
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:39,477
the gentleman explains that he’s been visiting young children in their homes

788
00:34:39,597 --> 00:34:42,618
for what he describes as years.”

789
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:48,482
News 60 is next. Stand by, Harriet; stand by, Simon.

790
00:34:48,483 --> 00:34:50,266
30 seconds back.

791
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:54,393
Hang on, I’ve got a note for you from the dress.

792
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:15,640
Use your downstage hand to reach for the glass in Nancy Grace.

793
00:35:15,641 --> 00:35:18,811
In five, four, three…

794
00:35:24,698 --> 00:35:26,636
Hey, Luke. How you doing?

795
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:33,473
“From Los Angeles, California, it’s News 60 with Harriet Hayes and Simon Styles.”

796
00:35:33,806 --> 00:35:35,412
“Good evening, I’m Simon Styles.”

797
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:36,530
“And I’m Matt.

798
00:35:36,853 --> 00:35:37,697
Harriet.

799
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,505
I’m Harriet Hayes.

800
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:47,057
Just after a man purchased a Picasso painting for $139 million, the seller, Las Vegas mogul Steve Wynn…”

801
00:35:57,101 --> 00:36:00,383
I’m sorry to disturb you. I know you’re, you’re with your grandchildren.

802
00:36:00,597 --> 00:36:02,060
I’d like them to meet you.

803
00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:07,616
You know, this may be the first time I’ve ever seen you without a necktie

804
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:12,980
What’s the matter, kid? You don’t look well.

805
00:36:15,705 --> 00:36:18,654
Last Sunday night, there was an incident on our news.

806
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:24,910
During a live feed from Afghanistan a marine, as well as a reporter who was interviewing him,

807
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:28,514
had an RPG explode nearby and the marine said f…

808
00:36:30,477 --> 00:36:31,168
well, he said…

809
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:32,049
Mm hmm.

810
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,595
I waited to tell you

811
00:36:34,197 --> 00:36:36,801
so I could speak with some lawyers and give you good advice.

812
00:36:36,802 --> 00:36:38,311
Yeah, I know about what happened.

813
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:40,964
- You know about the FCC?
- Yeah.

814
00:36:43,223 --> 00:36:44,044
Well...

815
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:48,893
I’ve been playing this out, every possible way in my head

816
00:36:49,773 --> 00:36:52,484
and I think this:

817
00:36:53,947 --> 00:36:55,243
I have to resign.

818
00:36:56,437 --> 00:36:59,220
I know the Macau deal is the one you’ve been waiting for your whole life,

819
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:02,431
and the FCC can block mergers. On the other hand...

820
00:37:03,405 --> 00:37:07,413
I just can’t be a party to the line that’s going to be crossed if we allow them their way on this.

821
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:12,753
I won’t pay a $73 million fine.

822
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,624
I won’t pay a 73 cent fine.

823
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:20,037
I won’t time-delay the news, and I won’t say I’m sorry.

824
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:24,939
I no longer recognize the authority of the FCC in this matter;

825
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,436
I’m going to have to be ordered by federal judge.

826
00:37:28,126 --> 00:37:30,302
And when they come to get my transmitter,

827
00:37:30,303 --> 00:37:35,429
they better send a group a hell of a lot more scary than the Foundation for Friendly Families

828
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,154
or whatever the hell they are.

829
00:37:37,744 --> 00:37:41,466
Let those guys embed themselves with the 2nd Marine division for a while;

830
00:37:41,549 --> 00:37:45,962
they’ll re-jigger their sense of what’s obscene in a quick hurry.

831
00:37:46,962 --> 00:37:52,885
Jack, this is the one I’ve been waiting for my whole life.

832
00:37:54,016 --> 00:37:58,535
You are the Chairman of the National Broadcasting System.

833
00:38:00,307 --> 00:38:03,127
That’s why I wanted my grandchildren to meet you.

834
00:38:05,672 --> 00:38:06,885
Yes, sir.

835
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:12,263
Stand by...15 seconds to air.

836
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:26,576
We’re back in five, four, three…

837
00:38:29,129 --> 00:38:32,268
Ladies and gentlemen, the City of New Orleans.

838
00:40:40,286 --> 00:40:42,546
Can I talk to you a second?

839
00:40:50,151 --> 00:40:53,897
I’ve been married twice before, and I’m a recovering cocaine addict

840
00:40:53,898 --> 00:40:56,715
and I know that’s no woman’s dream of a man

841
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,569
or of a father; nonetheless, I believe I’m falling in love with you.

842
00:41:01,524 --> 00:41:03,118
If you want to run, I understand,

843
00:41:03,498 --> 00:41:06,638
but you better get a head start ‘cause I’m coming for you, Jordan.

844
00:41:11,057 --> 00:41:13,269
You should go ahead and chew that sandwich.

845
00:41:33,672 --> 00:41:34,933
Where did you go?

846
00:41:35,432 --> 00:41:39,155
I went to a place called, “Say it, say it, say it!”

847
00:41:41,355 --> 00:41:43,198
I said it, okay?

848
00:41:44,019 --> 00:41:45,482
- Okay.
- Okay.

849
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:49,062
You were right, you know.

850
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:50,905
About what?

851
00:41:51,226 --> 00:41:52,839
We do live here now.

852
00:41:55,824 --> 00:41:56,894
Merry Christmas.

853
00:41:57,889 --> 00:41:59,459
Merry Christmas.

854
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:35,280
