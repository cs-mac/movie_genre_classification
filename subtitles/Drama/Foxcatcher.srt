00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:15,000
ShinY 

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,500
Knight

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:30,500


4
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,730


5
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,930
Hello.

6
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,530
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk to you today.

7
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,440
My name is Mark Schultz.

8
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,840
I wanna talk about America,

9
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,090
and I wanna tell you why I wrestle.

10
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,480
This is an Olympic gold medal.

11
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,650
I won this three years ago

12
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,640
at the 23rd Olympic Games in Los Angeles, California.

13
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,920
This is more than just some piece of metal.

14
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,330
It's about what the metal represents.

15
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,720
The virtues it requires to attain it.

16
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,520
Twenty dollars and zero cents.

17
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,200
Is it Dave or David?

18
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,240
No, it's Mark.

19
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,200
Mark Schultz.

20
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,920
Um...

21
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,640
Yeah. Dave's my brother.

22
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,120
- Oh. He was originally scheduled.

23
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,840
Okay.

24
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,000
We both won golds.

25
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,480
Make it the works, and coffee.

26
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,400
- For here? - Yes.

27
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,040
Number two, number three, here.

28
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,440
Please come, coach.

29
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,250
We don't want to put any pressure on you right now.

30
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,790
You gotta think it through and all that.

31
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,520
No, I get it. I appreciate it.

32
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,640
That's why I didn't wrestle him.

33
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,640
But didn't you miss that match? I missed that match.

34
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,240
Hey, Mark.

35
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,800
You know the guys from U.S.A. Wrestling.

36
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,070
Mark, how's it going?

37
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,280
Fred, Bruce, Greg.

38
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,930
Hey, Mark.

39
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Well, all right. - All right.

40
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,480
Just give us a call. - Appreciate it, Bruce.

41
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,320
- Thanks for coming all this way. - Okay. All right.

42
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,400
Hey, have a good workout. - Thank you.

43
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,680
Hey, buddy.

44
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,240
You all right?

45
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,610
Hey, you been calling my machine and hanging up?

46
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,080
What?

47
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,640
What do you mean? - Somebody's leaving hang-ups

48
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,960
on my machine. - Come on

49
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,280
Come on.

50
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,680
How you doing, buddy? You all right?

51
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,800
Okay.

52
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,160
Mark. Come on.

53
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,490
Keep your hips in.

54
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,200
Keep your hips in, Mark.

55
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,360
Heh.

56
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,280
Same time tomorrow? - Yeah.

57
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,210
What'd the U.S.A. Wrestling guys want?

58
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,200
We're talking about me doing some coaching.

59
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,600
In Colorado.

60
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,520
Hey. Give me a hug.

61
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,160
Hello?

62
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,760
Hello. May I speak with Mark Schultz?

63
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,400
Speaking.

64
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,120
Mark Schultz, the Olympic wrestler?

65
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,570
Yeah. Who is this?

66
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,320
I'm calling on behalf of Mr. John E. du Pont.

67
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,000
He has been anxious to get in touch with you.

68
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,660
Who?

69
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,680
John E. du Pont of the du Pont family.

70
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,560
Mr. du Pont asked that you consider taking a day off

71
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,880
to come out to Foxcatcher Farms,

72
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,720
so you men can meet face-to-face.

73
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,640
About what?

74
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,400
He'd like to discuss it in person in Pennsylvania.

75
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,080
If I may, I'd like to make travel arrangements for you, Mr. Schultz.

76
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,160
First class, of course.

77
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,080
Who'd you say again?

78
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,600
John E. du Pont, of the du Pont family.

79
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,560
Welcome to Philadelphia International Airport.

80
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,850
Mark, Mr. du Pont wanted to fly you himself today.

81
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But last minute, he got called in by the Newtown Square Police Department.

82
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,320
For tactical support.

83
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,160
He should be back at the estate by the time we get there.

84
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,530
By the way, that's Valley Forge below you.

85
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,600
This is the library.

86
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,040
Mr. du Pont should be here in a few minutes.

87
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,320
Okay.

88
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,040
Mark.

89
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,760
John du Pont.

90
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,800
Thrilled. Thrilled that you're here.

91
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,120
Let's go downstairs.

92
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,160
We call this the trophy room, for obvious reasons.

93
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,930
Have a seat.

94
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,360
How was your flight?

95
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,800
It was good. - Good.

96
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,440
Thank you.

97
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,880
Can I get you something to eat or drink?

98
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,840
Oh, no. No, I'm good. Thank you.

99
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,320
I could have them whip you up something.

100
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,050
No, sir, I'm fine.

101
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,690
Good.

102
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,610
Well, I know how busy you must be.

103
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,490
I assume you're training for the Worlds? - Yes, sir.

104
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,240
Good.

105
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,240
It's a big one.

106
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,880
How is training?

107
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,800
It's good. Um...

108
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,450
It's intense.

109
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,920
We're in two-a-days.

110
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,210
Conditioning and weights in the morning

111
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,360
and technique...

112
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,320
We wrestle in the evenings.

113
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,720
That's good. Get yourself prepared.

114
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,680
Work hard.

115
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,080
You look good. You look strong.

116
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,130
Fit. - Thank you, sir.

117
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,200
Feeling confident?

118
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,810
That's one of the most important elements of entering a match

119
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,240
is feeling the confidence, knowing that you're going to win.

120
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,440
Feeling it inside.

121
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,720
If you go to a match knowing that you're going to win that match,

122
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,160
odds are you're going to win that match.

123
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,600
You're training with your brother Dave?

124
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,000
Yes, sir. - Great Dave Schultz?

125
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,520
Yeah. - I'm talking to the great Mark Schultz.

126
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,050
Do you have any idea why I asked you to come here?

127
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,690
No.  No.

128
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,920
Well, Mark, do you...?

129
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,480
Do you have any idea who I am?

130
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,760
No. No.

131
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,760
Some rich guy calls you on the phone.

132
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,640
"I want Mark Schultz to come visit me."

133
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,920
Well, I'm a... I'm a wrestling coach.

134
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,120
And I have a deep love of the sport of wrestling.

135
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,840
And I wanted to speak with you about your future.

136
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,730
About what you hope to achieve.

137
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,560
What do you hope to achieve, Mark?

138
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,320
Well, I wanna be the best in the world.

139
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,120
I wanna go to Worlds and win gold.

140
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,720
I wanna go to the '88 Olympics in Seoul and win gold.

141
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,560
Good.

142
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,640
I'm proud of you.

143
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,080
Are you getting the support that you need?

144
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,720
What do you mean, sir?

145
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,800
Well, you know how the Soviets support their wrestlers.

146
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,720
I do.

147
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,280
Mark, we as a nation have failed to honor you.

148
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,560
And that's a problem.

149
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,250
Not just for you, but for our society.

150
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,490
When we fail to honor that which should be honored,

151
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,920
it's a problem.

152
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,200
It's a canary in a coal mine.

153
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,360
Do you bird-watch?

154
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,840
Uh, no. - You can learn a lot from birds.

155
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,440
I'm an ornithologist.

156
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,570
But more importantly, I am a patriot.

157
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,840
And I want to see this country soar again.

158
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,080
I want that too.

159
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,560
I can see that.

160
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,400
I'd like us to go to Seoul, stun the world.

161
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,280
What do you think?

162
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,760
Three thousand men died here.

163
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,730
These patriots were willing to give up everything...

164
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,440
including their lives...

165
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,120
for freedom.

166
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,560
I like to come here to remind myself what really matters.

167
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,200
We're going to do great things, Mark.

168
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,720
Great things.

169
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,690
Yes, sir.

170
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,840
Can you answer? Yes I can

171
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,040
But what would be the answer To the answer man?

172
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,520
Hey, Mark. - Hey.

173
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,280
Can I talk to you for a second? - Hey, Mark. Yeah.

174
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,520
Can I talk to him? - Go on.

175
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,080
Here! Do something.

176
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,590
The country has lost their morals and values,

177
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,520
and the kids are lost

178
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,680
and they don't have role models, and I agreed with him.

179
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,370
Hm. - Everything he was saying.

180
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,880
I couldn't believe he was saying stuff that I... It was in my head all the time.

181
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,920
Did you guys talk...? Did you talk money?

182
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,800
Yeah, yeah. - What's he talking?

183
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,120
You ready? - Yeah.

184
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,800
Twenty-five thousand a year.

185
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,850
He said, "Name your price"

186
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,570
and I just said the highest price in my head.

187
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,880
And we get to handpick our team.

188
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,360
Who are you gonna train with?

189
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,360
No. No, we're...

190
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,000
I meant "we" as in me and you, together, picking a team.

191
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,960
Mr. du Pont and I would love to have you.

192
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,680
Mark, what's, uh...?

193
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,840
What's he get out of all this?

194
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,040
Mr. du Pont? - Yeah.

195
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,560
America winning.

196
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,040
You winning. We talked about you.

197
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,920
Me winning.

198
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,160
Okay. - What are you thinking about, Dave?

199
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,800
This is it.

200
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,720
This is everything that we've... That we've ever wanted.

201
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,160
Mark, I can't leave.

202
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,160
I'm settled here.

203
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,520
Nancy's happy.

204
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,200
Xander's doing well at school.

205
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,240
They can come.

206
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,600
Mark,

207
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,920
I got a contract, I got commitments.

208
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,920
That's great for you.

209
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,800
I should just pass this up to be your training partner?

210
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,610
Mark. Mark.

211
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,240
This could be a real good thing for you.

212
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,560
I'm proud of you.

213
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,840
I think you can make something real good for yourself here.

214
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,570
Yeah? - Yeah.

215
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,920
I love you, Mark.

216
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,120
Hi. ls, uh, Mr. du Pont home?

217
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,850
Is Mr. du Pont expecting you?

218
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,440
Yes, ma'am.

219
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,080
Not at this exact moment, but, you know, this week sometime.

220
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,720
I'm Mark Schultz.

221
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,040
Have a seat here, for a moment.

222
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,810
I need to...

223
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,960
Do you have a commode?

224
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,730
Or, like, a washroom or something I could use?

225
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,610
Just in there to the left. - Thank you.

226
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,560
Mr. Beck will see you now.

227
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,480
I'm... I'm sorry. Who?

228
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,880
All right. How old are you, Mark?

229
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,240
Twenty-seven.

230
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,520
Education?

231
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,720
University of Oklahoma.

232
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,840
Undergraduate?

233
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,440
And you graduated? - Yes, sir.

234
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,840
Do you own any property, Mark?

235
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,440
No.

236
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,600
Are your parents still together?

237
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,120
No.

238
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,800
How old were you when they separated?

239
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,090
Two.

240
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,480
Who raised you?

241
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,800
Well, we moved around a lot.

242
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,610
But my brother, mainly.

243
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,610
Okay.

244
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,480
Mark, have you ever been accused of a crime?

245
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,290
No, sir.

246
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,770
I...

247
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,160
Mr. du Pont. - Oh, you're here.

248
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,080
Yes, I drove straight down.

249
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,240
Tonight's speech.

250
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,200
Okay.

251
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,600
So they're putting him in the chalet?

252
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,360
Yes, sir.  Hm.

253
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,760
Excellent bed.

254
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,320
Good mattress. Firm.

255
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,520
That's great. Thank you. - All right.

256
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,960
Good.

257
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,690
Utilities are paid for, gas, electric, water.

258
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,600
Kitchen, dining room. Refrigerator is fully stocked.

259
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,560
Office.

260
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,560
Here's a key for you.

261
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,370
Thank you.

262
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,560
The gym is close. You can almost see it.

263
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,120
Couple hundred yards up is the big house,

264
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,480
in case you ever get invited to dinner.

265
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,400
Otherwise, it is off-limits. - Okay.

266
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,040
Also, the horses that you saw on the way in,

267
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,240
they all belong to Mr. du Pont's mother.

268
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,840
They're all world-class animals.

269
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
They're also off-limits.

270
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,360
Your history of the du Pont dynasty.

271
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,930
One more thing:

272
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,240
Just between you and me,

273
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,600
if you happen to see Mrs. du Pont, just give her her privacy.

274
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
Yeah, of course.

275
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,370
Anything else I can get you?

276
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,040
No. No, no, I'm fine.

277
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,760
Well, I think that's it.

278
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,600
Have a good night.

279
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,010
You too.

280
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,000
Du Pont, a dynasty of wealth and power.

281
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,000
America's need for ammunition

282
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,920
enabled the family to amass a fortune

283
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,600
and grow their company into what is today

284
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,880
the largest chemical corporation in the world.

285
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,760
Mr. du Pont? - Shh-shh-shh.

286
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,280
Do you hear that?

287
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,640
That's a barred owl.

288
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,000
I hope it's not too late. - No, no, no.

289
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,920
I wanted to make sure that everything was all right.

290
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,080
That everything was fine. Drop a few things off that I thought you might enjoy.

291
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,440
Here are some field glasses.

292
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,520
There are many varieties of birds right here on the property.

293
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,000
That'll give you a better vantage point. - Okay.

294
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,110
And this is from 10 years ago,

295
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,240
but I thought you might find it interesting.

296
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,240
Wait, you wrote this? - I did, yeah.

297
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,080
Thank you.

298
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,120
How long do we have till the Worlds?

299
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,440
Two months. Well, a little less, actually.

300
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,680
Well, we'll get it done.

301
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,920
I promise you, I'll give you everything I have.

302
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,960
I have great faith in you, Mark.

303
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,480
Thank you, sir.

304
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,320
You're welcome.

305
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,200
Night.

306
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,170
Certainly Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt,

307
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,970
they gave me something to aspire to.

308
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,520
My father was a role model.

309
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,600
Guys, introduce yourself.

310
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,130
See you guys at 6? - All right.

311
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,080
Very good, I'll see you in three months.

312
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,440
Good.

313
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,210
Mark.

314
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,360
Come in.

315
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,160
Have a seat.

316
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,920
May I get you a drink?

317
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,200
No. No, sir. I'm good.

318
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,570
Good. Good man. In training.

319
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,560
How is it looking with your brother Dave?

320
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,680
Dave?

321
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,920
How do you mean?

322
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,880
You said you were going to talk to him again.

323
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,360
I did.

324
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,520
When is he coming?

325
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,920
He's not.

326
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,000
He... He's just not...

327
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,400
He's just not willing to uproot his family.

328
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,810
Does he understand what we're doing here, Mark?

329
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,530
I told him.

330
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,760
He just really doesn't wanna move.

331
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,040
How much does he want?

332
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,040
No, it's...

333
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,280
It's not about that.

334
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,600
About what?

335
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,010
Well, you can't buy Dave.

336
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,200
So the World Championships are coming up soon?

337
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,050
Yes, sir.

338
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,320
I want you to win.

339
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,240
That's why you're here.

340
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,880
Everything okay, Mark?

341
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,560
Yeah.

342
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,680
What is it?

343
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,560
What's wrong?

344
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,610
Nothing. I'm... I'm fine.

345
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,760
No, you're not.

346
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,680
I just...

347
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,680
I just don't wanna let you down.

348
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,840
Do it! Go!

349
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,080
That's it.

350
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,040
Attack! Attack! Control his rolling. Control his rolling.

351
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,400
Keep your elbows in!

352
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,170
Mark Schultz.

353
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,290
Good job, Mark.

354
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,200
Dave Schultz.

355
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,840
Hello. - Hey, Xander.

356
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,200
Hi. Where's your dad?

357
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,000
Over there. Hello.

358
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,240
Hey, Mark. Come on in, buddy. - Yah!

359
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,920
Oh, God, he's got me.

360
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,640
Dave, I wanted to... I want you to meet Mr. du Pont.

361
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,480
Hold on a sec. We got a guest. I gotta get up.

362
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,790
How you doing? I have to say hi.

363
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,520
Keep him... - No. We're not letting you up.

364
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,880
I wanna say hi to Mr. du Pont. Hold on.

365
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,610
How you doing? - Dad, come on.

366
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,360
It's nice to meet you. Dave Schultz.

367
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,000
John du Pont.

368
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,840
That's my wife, Nancy. - Hey.

369
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,930
Hello. - My beautiful, relaxed children.

370
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,800
This is Xander and Dani. - Hello.

371
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,560
Hi. - They're eating me.

372
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,400
Hey, Dani? Dani, come here.

373
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,120
Can I get you a drink? - No. No, I should go.

374
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,040
Good luck tomorrow.

375
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,240
Mark, thank you.

376
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,200
You sure you don't want to...? - No, no.

377
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,240
No, Mark, stay. - I'm gonna get you.

378
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,240
Come here. Get your brother.

379
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,210
Hey. Okay. It's bedtime now. - I can make an A.

380
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,560
No. Let's go.

381
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,400
Here it comes.  - Get ready for bed.

382
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,950
Dave, I got that tape on Nanev.

383
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:21,560
Yeah, pop it in, buddy.

384
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,130
We need to check out his arm spin.

385
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,400
We'll watch some wrestling.

386
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,080
Get your arm up. Get your arms out of there.

387
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,560
There we go.

388
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,080
Hurry up. Let me go! - I'll have to keep you here.

389
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,280
No. - Let me get these tights off.

390
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,320
Good princess. - Okay, get...

391
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,680
Was it too much for you to come over and just say hi to him?

392
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,240
Aren't they fun? - Excuse me?

393
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,760
You know who that is? It's John du Pont.

394
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,130
I said hi, Mark. - It's John du Pont.

395
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,040
The most generous man in America. You can't treat him like he's anyone.

396
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,850
Mark, she said hi. Mark, I said hi, okay?

397
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,360
She said hi. - You said hi from over there.

398
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,720
Buddy. Mark.

399
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,560
She said hi, pal.

400
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,800
Mark You're in our room.

401
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,760
I'm in your room? Okay. All right.

402
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,160
Great. You know what? You don't even know.

403
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,210
You don't even know what you don't know. You know that?

404
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,480
Dave? - Dad.

405
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,000
Mark. - Why? Dad.

406
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,730
No. - Yes.

407
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,400
Dad. - Buddy.

408
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,920
Mark.

409
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,490
Buddy. Come here.

410
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,410
Come here.

411
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,010
Give me the tape. Okay.

412
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:40,040
Nanev can't set up his arm spin without setting up himself.

413
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,040
You just hit yours first.When you feel him drive, hit it.

414
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,920
All right?

415
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,760
He's gonna drive and turn you and...

416
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,010
There it is.

417
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,680
That's it.Drive him out. Drive him out.

418
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,250
Drive him.

419
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,520
Drive, drive!

420
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,800
Elbows deep, Mark.Drive! Drive!

421
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,800
Five seconds, Mark!

422
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,200
Drive him. That's it.

423
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,080
Drive him, drive him, drive him!Pop him up!

424
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,920
that's it, buddy!

425
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:03,000
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

426
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,490
Oh, there we go.

427
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,640
Who needs a refill?

428
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,480
Let's all get very drunk.

429
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,360
Can I take a look at your medal? - Yeah. Yeah.

430
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,520
What a fantastic evening.

431
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:02,760
Fame makes a man take things over

432
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:07,770
Fame lets him loose hard to swallow

433
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,000
Fame, puts you there where things are hollow

434
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,520
Fame

435
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,680
Fame, it's not your brain

436
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,600
All right. All right.

437
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,360
Enough. Enough!

438
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,040
Turn that off.

439
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,480
Take that down.

440
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,360
Where do you want me to put it? - I don't care.

441
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,000
Throw it away.

442
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,000
All of it, whole shelf.

443
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,200
Horses are stupid.

444
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,520
Horses eat and shit.

445
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,120
That's all they do.

446
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,600
It's very silly.

447
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,120
It's all very silly.

448
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,400
I love my mother very much,but she...

449
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,850
She... It's...

450
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,000
It's ridiculous.

451
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,240
Sitting on an animal was more dignified.

452
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,360
But I wanted to do what you're doing.

453
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,440
Let's have those medals.

454
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,160
Give me those.

455
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,240
Give me those medals.

456
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:00,200
I do not share my mother's affection for horseflesh,

457
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,920
I'll have you know.

458
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:09,040
"Did your horse jump over the thing?"

459
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,840
"Did you catch the fox, Mother?"

460
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,810
Anyway

461
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,280
the proof is in the pudding.

462
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,600
We caught the fox, didn't we?

463
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,040
Yeah. - This is the fox.

464
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,770
Yes, sir.

465
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,880
I am going to put these in there.

466
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,640
Gentlemen, I give you Mark Schultz,

467
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,770
Foxcatcher world champion.Yes. Good.

468
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,120
Whoa, whoa, coach.

469
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,280
You all right? - Get him up.

470
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,520
Coach, you all right? - I think he had too much to drink.

471
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,120
Drive! Drive! - Drive, drive!

472
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,280
Get on his other side.- Get on him.

473
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,880
Push him.- Come on. You got him.

474
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,610
What? - The jig's up.

475
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,440
Climb up on him. Come on. Come on. Work him, work him, work him!

476
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,760
Yes!

477
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,250
Don't let him drive you, Dan. Don't let him drive you.

478
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,560
Turn him. Come on, turn him. That's it.

479
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,340
You gotta turn him. Yes!

480
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,560
Turn him. Turn him.

481
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,800
John! - Johnny D!

482
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,160
John! John! John!

483
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,760
John! John! John! Yeah!

484
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,720
Yo, Johnny D! - Yeah, Johnny D!

485
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,610
Mark.

486
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,200
After practice, I want you to shower and come talk to me, all right?

487
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,120
Yeah. All right.

488
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,480
Three hundred eighty-seven days to Seoul, gentlemen.

489
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,240
Let's have a good practice,shall we?

490
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,970
Mr. du Pont, you don't have to do this.

491
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:45,560
You earned it.

492
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,160
You've given me enough. This is not necessary.

493
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,080
Mark, Mark, you earned that.

494
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,080
Thank you. - You're welcome, Mark.

495
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,720
You're more than Dave Schultz's little brother, Mark.

496
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,320
Okay.

497
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,760
Dave Schultz is a wonderful wrestler.

498
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,440
He, I'm sure,has been an inspiration to you.

499
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,120
A mentor to you.

500
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,320
But he will always be your older brother.

501
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,880
He will never let you

502
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,130
be everything that you can be.

503
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:42,360
Mark, you have been living in your brother's shadow your entire life.

504
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,560
It's time. It's your time now.

505
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,920
I know what you mean.

506
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,400
Do you?

507
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,000
Because everything that I've done,

508
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,000
I feel like...

509
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:12,240
has somehow been credited to Dave.

510
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,840
And, you know, I feel that...

511
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,840
it's time for me to...

512
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,360
distance myself from him.

513
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,480
You know, become my own person.

514
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,160
Without your brother...

515
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,960
you can do anything that you choose to set your mind to.

516
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,640
Mr. du Pont,I need you to know that I'm...

517
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,720
I'm so grateful for what you've done for me.

518
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,040
Well, first of all,

519
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:53,370
I don't want you to call me "Mr. du Pont" or "sir" anymore.

520
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,720
I consider us friends.

521
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:00,880
And most of my friends will call me "Eagle" or "Golden Eagle."

522
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,200
So either of those will work.

523
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,040
Okay.

524
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,840
Or "John" or "Coach."

525
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,320
All right. That's not a problem.

526
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,970
Good.

527
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,120
Good afternoon,sir.

528
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,000
M113, sir. APC. - I know what it is.

529
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,120
Where's the gun?

530
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,120
What gun, sir?

531
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,210
Fifty-caliber machine gun.

532
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,160
Sir, there wasn't a machine gun ordered.

533
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,240
It's supposed to be mounted right there.

534
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,880
There's no gun on the order, sir.

535
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,920
Sir, I just need a signature to complete the order.

536
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,960
Get my gun.

537
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,160
Reed, McClaren,let's off-load.

538
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,520
It's supposed to come with a .50-caliber machine gun.

539
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,250
We'll get it.

540
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,120
You hungry? - Yeah.

541
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,640
Let's get something to eat.

542
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,850
You snap him down.

543
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
He'll posture up, that's your window.

544
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,440
Shoot in and pull him over the top.

545
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,970
Excellent.

546
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,610
One more.

547
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,770
Great.

548
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,280
The oil looks really good on you, Mark.

549
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,640
Bow your arms a little bit. Here we go.

550
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,810
Excellent.

551
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,530
Very good, and all right. Very good, Mark.

552
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,800
Your speeches, your kit.

553
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,530
Do we know if my mother has already arrived?

554
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,480
She is en route, sir.

555
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,400
The blazer looks good.

556
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,080
Thank you, sir.

557
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,730
I wrote down a few things for you to say.

558
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,450
Don't be nervous. You're gonna be great.

559
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,760
Read it. Read it out loud.

560
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,440
Okay. Right now?

561
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,480
Get some practice. - Yes, sir.

No, philatelist. - Philatelist.

568

Don't be intimidated by these people.

569
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,040
How many people are gonna be there?

570
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,120
About 400.

571
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,640
Go ahead.

572
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,210
What is it? - It's cocaine.

573
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:16,330
Uh...I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

574
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,320
Mark, it's just cocaine.

575
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,840
It's not going to kill you.

576
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,280
What am I...? You're supposed to just...?

577
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,240
Take the vial,

578
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,760
tap some on the mirror,

579
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,970

01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,010
You got it.

Yes, John. How are you? Good to see you again.

611
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,080
This is Mark Schultz.- Hi.

612
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,160
Have you ever met an Olympic gold medalist before?

613
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,440
Mark won the Olympic gold medal for wrestling in 1984.

614
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,760
Ever seen an Olympic medalist before?

615
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,680
No, I don't think I have.

616
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,530
Mark. Mark.

617
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,760
This is Congressman Daniel. - Nice to meet you.

618
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:41,560
Bob.

619
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,200

01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,160
Bob, yes. - Bob, nice to meet you.

621
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,560
This is Mark Schultz.

622
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,920
Mark won an Olympic gold medal in the 1984 Olympics.

623
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,960
Impressive. - Isn't that impressive?

624
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,760
Congratulations. - Thank you.

625
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,600
Quite a young man.

626
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,720
Very proud of him. Nice meeting you.

627
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:11,610
I'm so proud to introduce my mentor.

628
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,520
He has the ability to look at me and see where I am in life.

629
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,200
I feel his love for me as an athlete and as a human being.

630
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,120
My mother and father were divorced when I was 2

631
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,930
And I spent a lifetime looking for a father,

632
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,590
and I found one in the Golden Eagle of America,

633
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:28,840
John du Pont.

634
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,920
Mark Schultz. Thank you, son.

635
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,960
Hello, Mother.

636
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:46,770
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to read something.

637
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,090
"The liberties of our country,

638
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,520

639
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:57,120
are worth defending at all hazards.

640
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,680
And it is our duty to defend them against all attacks..."

641
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,800
Oh, hey. Hey, what's up? - I miss you.

642
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,200
Yeah.  What you up to?

643
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,960
Huh?  What you up to?

644
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,400
Nothing. Nothing.

645
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:51,120
Are you working out? Getting ready?

646
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:55,720
Yeah... No. I mean, well, I'm taking a little bit of a break right now.

647
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,080
Just resting up the body. I'm gonna ramp it up, you know,

648
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:02,080
when it gets closer to World... Trials.

649
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,320
All right. How close?

650
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,240
Hey, hold on. Hold on one second. - What?

651
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,600
What's happening?

652
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,610
Hey!

653
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,120
Mark!

654
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,090
Gear up. Practice in the gallery.

655
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,640
As I went walking

656
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,600
That ribbon of highway

657
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,280
I saw above me

658
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,640
That endless skyway

659
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,240
I saw below me

660
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,400
That golden valley

661
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,960
This land was made for you and me

662
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,960
This land is your land

663
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,120
This land is my land

664
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,440
From California

665
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,760
To the New York island

666
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,440
From the red wood forest

667
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,040
To the Gulf Stream waters

668
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,520
This land was made

669
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,680
For you and me

670
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,930
You all right?

671
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,210
Huh?

672
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,320
You are a good friend, Mark.

673
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,080
Thank you, John.

674
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:45,960
I only had one real friend growing up.

675
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,440
Hugh Cherry. Hughby.

676
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,440
He was the son of my mother's chauffeur.

677
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:09,280
When I was 16, I found out that my mother had been paying him

678
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,560
to be my friend.

679
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,360
Dave was my only friend growing up.

680
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,320
I thought we could put it in the Rosemont case.

681
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,600
It says John "Eagle" du Pont. - That's right.

682
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,530
First place? - Yes.

683
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,800
You funded this.

684
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,400
Presumably.

685
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,080
You can put it in the trophy room.

686
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,040
Thank you, Mother.

687
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,720
What are we going to do about your train set?

688
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,680
My train set?

689
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:24,920
Well, Mr. Beck spoke to you about this.

690
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,360
No.

691
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,010
Oh, I know he did.

692
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,840
I know he did.

693
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,080
You've never wanted to give it away, but...

694
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:37,480
I don't care about my train set, Mother. I don't care.

695
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:43,040
Well, I think we'll...

696
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,870
We'll give it to the children's museum,

697
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:48,760
if they have room.

698
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,170
Do you agree?

699
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,160
I don't care what you do with the train set.

700
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,640
I don't care about trains.

701
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,720
Mother, I am leading men.

702
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,960
I am training them. I am teaching them.

703
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,280
I am giving them...

704
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,280
a dream.

705
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,090
And I am giving America...

706
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,890
hope.

707
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,210
Hope?

708
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,040
It doesn't matter.

709
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,360
I'm glad you have your trophy.

710
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,480
It can go in the trophy room.

711
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,080
Not in the Rosemont case.

712
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:38,600
I don't like the sport of wrestling, as you know.

713
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,760
It's a low sport.

714
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:48,640
And I don't like to see you being low.

715
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,640
And quickly Herrera shoots the leg.

716
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,800
And Herrera 's a very good grappler here.

717
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,680
Oh, my. Elbows in number, by Goodridge.

718
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,490
And that is it.

719
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,160
Albert wrestled with this guy at Pitt.

720
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,400
I think it's sad.

721
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,800
He was legit.

722
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,040
He's probably getting paid a lot.

723
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,000
Look at his face.

724
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,640
That was short and sweet. - It's destroyed.

725
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,050
It's John. - It's John.

726
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,610
Hey, coach. - ls Mark in?

727
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,600
Yeah. Right here, coach.

728
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,120
What's up?

729
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,360
Why is there nobody in the gym?

730
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,600
What do you mean? - It's noon. Nobody in there.

731
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:57,920
Yeah, no, I gave the boys the morning off. We're gonna do a double tonight.

732
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,360
Who's making these decisions?

733
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,120
I am.

734
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,760
I want your brother Dave here.

735
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,130
What are you talking about?

736
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,320
I want your brother Dave to come.

737
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,880
Um, that's not gonna happen.

738
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,200
We've talked about that.

739
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,280
Are you okay?

740
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,240
You ungrateful ape.

741
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,680
I made such a mistake bringing you here.

742
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,200
I'm getting Dave.

743
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:49,010
I don't care how much it costs.

744
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,240
Hey. - Hi, guys.

745
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,440
There he is. He's coming. He's coming.

746
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,690
John du Pont. - Yeah.

747
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,440
Thanks. Yeah.

748
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,680
Hey.

749
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,240
How you doing?

750
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,800
Good. I'm good.

751
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,330
What's up?

752
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:35,080
I just... Just came in. All the wrestlers were there to meet me

753
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,440
and you weren't there, and I just thought I'd come up,

754
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,480
make sure everything's okay.

755
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,840
No, I'm good.

756
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,440
Just concentrating.

757
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,680
We got trials coming up.

758
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,920
You okay, Mark?

759
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,560
Yeah. I'm good.

760
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,290
What's up?

761
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,720
You got my messages?

762
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,370
Mm-hm.

763
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,250
Nancy and the kids are here.

764
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,760
Yeah? How are they? - They're good.

765
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:19,960
Why don't you come down and say hi. - Okay. I will. I'll see you.

766
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,640
Boom, down low.

767
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,840
This hand comes here, this hand catches the ankle.

768
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:37,920
Lay your back into the guy, scoop with this leg, catch both knees,

769
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,480
put your arm through.There's your cross ankle,all right?

770
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,130
Nice and tight.

771
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,800
Do it again, all right?

772
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,000
So you're here, you're wrestling.

773
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:52,400
If you get here and you're loose like this,

774
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:57,520
to make it nice and tight, what you wanna do is drive the knees together

775
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:01,680
with your hip and your elbow, and drop your arm down or drop your chest.

776
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,690
That'll make it nice and snug for you.

777
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,280
You wanna keep your outside leg away from him.

778
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,360
Keep your leg away from him, come up to your knee,

779
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:14,040
turn your toe to the ceiling,step him up.

780
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,280
Let's say he does reel over with that outside ankle,

781
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,280
that's pretty much game over.

782
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,480
I have a chance to make him keep those feet...

783
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:30,400
So from here, you pull this up and you drive that.

784
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,200
Outside shoulders from that,and he pulls...

785
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,880
Use your stomach.

786
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,720
Use your stomach.

787
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,160
Good.

788
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,240
Good set.

789
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,720
All right, pair up.

790
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:02,880
Let's go, guys.

791
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,320
What's going on, Mark?

792
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:56,880
There's that knee pick he likes to hit from a fake shot or cross...

793
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:00,970
Dave, I don't need your help. I'm doing this on my own, okay?

794
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,880
You don't want my help? - Dave, what did I just say?!

795
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,160
Wanna tell me what's going on with you and du Pont?

796
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,450
Okay.

797
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,760
Handstands.

798
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,440
Tuck and roll forward, boys.

799
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,200
Army crawl on this side.

800
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,280
Good.

801
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,440
Bring it in.

802
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,210
Move.

803
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,320
Right there. Make some room.

804
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,760
All the way over.

805
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,680
In three days,

806
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:09,200
several of you will be traveling with me to Pensacola

807
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:12,250
to participate in the Olympic trials.

808
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:19,920
When you leave the hallowed grounds of this training facility...

809
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,360
you will be in competition.

810
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,360
You will be representing Foxcatcher.

811
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,610
You will be representing the United States.

812
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,400
As a coach,

813
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:42,920
I want you to be champions in sport...

814
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,640
and winners in life.

815
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,960
And also...

816
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,560
to be good citizens...

817
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,040
for America.

818
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,960
Garcia.

819
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,960
A couple basics.

820
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:15,160
This is one that generally works for me quite well.

821
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,640
Arm drag.

822
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,480
Right to left, left to right.

823
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,560
Rip it across.

824
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,120
And as I do that,you see this portion.

825
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,960
And I can move right in.

826
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,280
Again.

827
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,720

Right to left, left to right.

828
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,200

Rip it across.

829
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,200
And then in.

830
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,840
Got it? - Yeah.

831
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,570
Do we have that? - Yes.

832
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,880
All right, par terre.

833
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,600
Down. Actually, I'll go down.

834
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,010
You do it. - Okay.

835
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,440
Do it on me.

836
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,920
So get underneath my rib.

837
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:06,200
All right.

838
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:17,320
The basic physics is to keep yourself wide at the bottom.

839
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:20,920
All right.

840
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,840
He puts his knee under my hip,

841
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,240
and you see an opening here.

842
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,730
So you shoot...

843
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,720
Let's pair up.

844
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,760
Basics. - All right.

845
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:47,320
All right, let's pair up and work on arm drags.

846
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,320
Arm drags and gut wrenches.

847
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,320
All right, let's do it, guys.

848
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,920
Three days, three days.

849
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,520
Step forward. All right, name, weight.

850
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:01,760
He's good.

851
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,240
All right, you got about a... Looks like about a half a kilo to go.

852
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,970
Step forward. - Name, weight?

853
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,360
Thirty.  He's good.

854
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,320
Next.  Step forward.

855
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,360
Name? Weight?  Let's see.

856
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,040
That's about a half kilo to go.

857
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,560
You're good.  Next.

858
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:17,880
He's good.

859
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,760
Step forward. Name, weight?

860
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,000
Good. Next bastard's good.

861
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,280
Next.

862
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,520
Two kilos over.

863
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,480
That looks good.  You're good.

864
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:27,920
Next.  Step forward.

865
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:44,250
Next match : Mark Schultz versus Rico Chiapparelli.

866
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,120
One, blue.

867
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:31,720
Best of three, Mark. You'll get it back.

868
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:34,800
Mark.

869
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:30,130
You're not in this alone, man.

870
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,360
I'm your brother and I love you.

871
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:39,520
I am not gonna let you go down like this.

872
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,410
That's it.

873
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,560
There's more in there.

874
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,200
That's it, keep going, Mark.

875
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,730
Twelve pounds over. How much time we got?

876
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,240
Ninety minutes. - Ninety minutes, okay.

877
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,320
Come on, there you go.

878
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:14,560
That's it, drive it.

879
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,050
Harder, Mark.

880
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,560
That's it. Time.

881
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:24,640
Okay. All right.

882
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:29,800
Five, four, three, two, one.

883
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,240
Time.

884
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,320
Three, two, one.

885
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,560
All right, buddy.

886
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:05,400
Go.

887
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,640
Circle.

888
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:52,320
Hold your position, Mark.

889
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,920
Ten seconds.

890
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,480
Hold your position.

891
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:03,800
All right. All right, Mark.

892
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:22,640
Sheets can't be on the team.

893
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,560
Mark Schultz is on the Olympic team.

894
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,440
Get in there, Mark, you hear me?

895
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:35,610
Okay, center red, center blue.

896
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:49,770
Yeah!

897
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:51,800
Two-thirty, Mark.

898
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,770
Hey, Henry. - Dave. What can I do for you?

899
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:48,280
Henry, John and I kind of had an uncomfortable moment earlier

900
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:52,080
and, you know, I didn't see him at the finals.

901
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:54,720
Was he even there? - No.

902
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,850
Mr. du Pont flew home earlier today.

903
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,120
Okay.

904
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,160
Mr. du Pont's mother died.

905
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,720
Oh, man. That's really bad news.

906
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,890
Excuse me, Dave. - All right. Thank you.

907
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,320
Would you like us to mount the weapon?

908
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:04,680
Yes. - Gentlemen.

909
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,440
You and me, buddy.

910
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,730
How you doing? You sore?

911
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,040
There you go.

912
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,480
Open that stretch for me.

913
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,200
It's John.

914
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:27,040
Hey, John.

915
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:31,660
I'm really sorry about your mother.

916
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:33,320
Oh, no, no, no. It's fine. It's fine.

917
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:35,050
You okay? You sure? - Yes.

918
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:39,760
David, we have a lot of work to do in the next couple of months.

919
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:44,200
And you're an integral part of that. You understand?

920
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:47,010
I understand.  I'm going to need you.

921
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:50,880
And I will be relying on you

922
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:55,120
All right. - to a great extent. I want,

923
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:58,760
More than anything, to win a gold medal.

924
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:01,760
And we have someone who could do that for us.

925
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,840
We're gonna win a gold medal, John.

926
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,520
How are you feeling about that? - I feel very good about it.

927
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:09,560
I am a little concerned

928
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:14,120
that there are some psychological issues

929
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:16,560
that we need to take care of.

930
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:20,000
He's gonna be in real good shape.  You're doing a great job.

931
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:22,080
Thank you, John.  And I...

932
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:27,360
I think that with you and I, working in tandem,

933
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:30,960
if we can't get him there, no one can.

934
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,480
All right. Get back.

935
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:36,130
Okay.

936
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,090
Mark?

937
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,330
Mark?

938
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:48,400
You okay? - Mark.

939
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:50,240
He's okay.

940
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:52,040
Come on, Mark.

941
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,690
Good.

942
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:27,040
Coach du Pont has a vision.

943
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:29,400
He would like Foxcatcher

944
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,960
to be designated and recognized

945
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:34,040
as the official training site

946
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:36,560
for U.S.A. Wrestling and the Olympic team.

947
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:42,480
Now, this means that the national team would live here and train here.

948
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:46,530
On top of funding this program,

949
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:51,640
Coach du Pont would be willing to make a donation to U.S.A. Wrestling

950
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:54,720
of $500,000 per year.

951
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:57,200
That's fantastic. - Yeah, that's really nice.

952
01:42:57,400 --> 01:42:59,800
Mr. du Pont, thank you very much for...

953
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:01,560
The spirit of Foxcatcher.

954
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:07,400
It is a philosophy which began generations ago.

955
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:12,760
Thank you. - It is more than just sport.

956
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:21,040
And coaching these young athletes,

957
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:26,200
I am able to instill in them the lessons that I have learned in life.

958
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:32,650
Athletes need role models.

959
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:38,000
Like anyone, they need people to look up to.

960
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:42,680
A coach is a father.

961
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:46,160
A coach is a mentor.

962
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:53,520
A coach has great power...

963
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:00,240
great import on an athlete's life.

964
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:05,000
We'll put you in a house with another wrestler.

965
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:07,730
Gym's a hundred yards from it.

966
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,560
There's plenty of places for the kids to run around.

967
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,450
Hey, Mark, I'll just be...

968
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:17,120
All right. I'll tell her you said hey.

969
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:21,610
I'm waiting to hear from you. Bye.

970
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,560
Hey, buddy.

971
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:28,000
Hey. - Warm up. I'll be out there in a minute.

972
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,920
I gotta make one more call.  Yeah, I just...

973
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:32,650
Look.

974
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,640
I don't wanna be here.

975
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:43,090
I called Coach Beacham at BYU.

976
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:47,120
He said he'd take both of us.

977
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:51,970
We don't got time to make a big change like that.

978
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:54,280
Okay, what about after Seoul?

979
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:57,520
Mark...

980
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:01,240
Look, I don't know what's gonna happen in the future,

981
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,960
but Nancy and I would like to try

982
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:08,800
and make it work here.

983
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:14,600
You and I both know that I can't stay here.

984
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,640
I know, Mark.

985
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,410
Hey, do you remember when we were kids?

986
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:38,000
You remember how we lived?

987
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,280
Moving all over the place?

988
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:46,120
Never had any idea where or how long we were gonna be anywhere.

989
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:48,680
Remember how that was for us?

990
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:51,080
Was it easy for us?

991
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,520
No.

992
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:59,400
That's my responsibility to my family, Mark.

993
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:04,120
I know you understand that.

994
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:11,050
Keep your head in the game, Mark.

995
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:13,880
Go on down.

996
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,520
Hi, Dave, I'm Doc.

997
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:36,000
Doc, Dave Schultz. - Nice to meet you.

998
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:38,880
Have a seat in the chair here, if you would.

999
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:45,080
We're rolling.

1000
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:47,810
Let's talk a bit about his philosophy as a coach.

1001
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:53,000
What is his philosophy as the individual that's gonna lead this team and you?

1002
01:46:55,040 --> 01:47:00,040
Well, John's philosophy as a coach is to let the wrestlers...

1003
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,360
Um...

1004
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:08,440
Sorry.

1005
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:12,360
Is to, um, create an environment

1006
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:17,520
where, uh, the athlete doesn't have many obstacles

1007
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:22,240
to get past to be great.

1008
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:26,440
Let's get pointed here. I... - I'm not doing what you want me to.

1009
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:29,080
Let's get pointed. - What are you looking for?

1010
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:31,400
You know what we're trying to accomplish.

1011
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:34,360
We're making a documentary that shows

1012
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:36,560
John is gonna be able to lead this team,

1013
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:41,250
lead you to levels of greatness in wrestling we haven't seen before.

1014
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:45,280
And talk about that, but use some of those terms that he likes,

1015
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:49,000

like "excellent" and "intensity" and "domination."

1016
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:53,400
All right.

1017
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:57,000
Well, John du Pont...

1018
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:02,560
Say that again? I'm sorry. Can you ask me that question again?

1019
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:07,840
John sees you as important to this. You're the closing chapter to this thing.

1020
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:10,800
You're the end of it, and you're his assistant coach.

1021
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,160
He sees himself as your mentor.

1022
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:16,520
I would like you to just look at the camera

1023
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:21,320
and speak about John...

1024
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:23,840
as a mentor.

1025
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,440
And say what exactly?

1026
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:28,850
That he's your mentor.

1027
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,400
Can you do that?

1028
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:42,400
John du Pont...

1029
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:48,600
is kind of a mentor to me.

1030
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:55,730
Just look over here at the camera and say it again.

1031
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:11,360
John du Pont is a mentor to me.

1032
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:22,280
I thought maybe it'd be a good idea if we talked, kind of clear the air.

1033
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,120
I wanna make sure you guys are clear that we expect

1034
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:31,240
that Mr. du Pont is gonna be in Mark's corner throughout the Olympic Games.

1035
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:38,410
Well, we can ask him if that's okay, but first,

1036
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:41,960
I'd like to raise a few things that are important to me.

1037
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:45,360
One, if I'm gonna...

1038
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:50,920
commit to staying on here at Foxcatcher,

1039
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:55,280
I need to know that Mark's gonna be taken care of.

1040
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:58,080
Well, taken care of how?

1041
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:02,880
So long as I'm at Foxcatcher, Mark's gonna get paid.

1042
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:06,010
You want him to be paid even if he's not here?

1043
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:08,720
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

1044
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:15,680
Dave, you may be overestimating your importance to Foxcatcher.

1045
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:19,440
Well, that may be so.

1046
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:24,560
We could test that, but I'm here to say, John,

1047
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:28,920
I wanna continue what we've started here at Foxcatcher.

1048
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:32,410
And it's important to me

1049
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:36,920
that I know that my brother is gonna be supported.

1050
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:49,960
Thanks, John.

1051
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:54,370
Okay, you'll get your deal, you'll get your demands,

1052
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:58,240
but this means that Mr. du Pont

1053
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:02,370
is gonna be seated in Mark's corner throughout the Olympic Games.

1054
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:06,730
I wanna hear Mark agree to that himself.

1055
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:07,370

Remember what we went over today, Mark.

1056
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:12,610
You can't do this to yourself, buddy. You can't do this to yourself.

1057
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:15,930
You can beat this guy, Mark. You can beat him.

1058
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:46,400
Can I help you?

1059
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:51,010
Everything okay? - Can I help you?

1060
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:54,000
Uh, yeah, we live here. - Okay.

1061
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:57,800
There's a new security plan in place. I'm gonna need to see some IDs.

1062
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:00,840
Sure.

1063
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:31,090
Hey, John, it's Sunday. It's family time.

1064
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:34,080
Morning, John. - Say hi to John.

1065
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,400
Hi, John.

1066
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,600
It's Sunday.

1067
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:40,840
Every athlete, no matter what sport, needs structure,

1068
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:43,360
needs direction,

1069
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,250
and this is something that a coach can offer.

1070
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:51,240
As a coach, I hope to develop young athletes,

1071
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:54,680
not only in body, but in mind.

1072
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:02,040
I want you to be champions in sport and winners in life.

1073
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:07,080
And also, good citizens of America.

1074
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:10,280
You will be representing Foxcatcher.

1075
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:12,720
You will be representing the United States.

1076
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,480
The coach is there

1077
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:18,560
to help the athlete succeed

1078
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:23,960
in all the ways that athlete should be able to succeed.

1079
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,640
And in doing so

1080
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:29,960
that coach is able to create a champion.

1081
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:37,120
My athletes look to me as a brother, a mentor,

1082
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:40,440
a father and a leader.

1083
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:42,920
I spent my lifetime looking for a father,

1084
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:46,680
and I have found one in the Golden Eagle of America,

1085
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:48,410
John du Pont.

1086
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:25,440
Wayne.

1087
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:31,480
Yes, sir?

1088
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:33,600
Is it snowing?

1089
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:36,040
No, it's not.

1090
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:42,520
Warm up my car.

1091
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:44,440
Yes, sir.

1092
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:29,680
Hey, John. What's happening?  Hey, whoa!

1093
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,880
No.  Do you have a problem with me?

1094
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:33,640
John. Don't, John.

1095
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:34,880
No, John, I don't have a problem.

1096
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:37,720
Hey, John... Argh!

1097
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:40,240
John, no!

1098
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:41,970
Stop, John. Stop!

1099
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:47,600
John, no!

1100
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:51,840
Freeze! Drop the gun! - Drop it now!

1101
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:24,880
Mark.

1102
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:27,040
You're up.

1103
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:38,400
He is a jujitsu fighter, standing 6 feet, 2 inches tall,

Vladimir "The Prototype" Milstead.

1107
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:59,080
Ladies and gentlemen, fight number three

1108

on our six-bout card features a matchup

1109
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:06,920
with this freestyle wrestler out of Lindon, Utah.

1110
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:12,360
Standing 5 feet, 10 inches tall, weighing in at 203 pounds,

1111
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:18,760
he is a three-time NCAA and three-time world champion,

1112

Please welcome,

1114
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:33,120
Mark Schultz!

U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

1117
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:06,440


1118
02:07:06,940 --> 02:07:11,940


1119
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:20,840


1120
02:07:20,940 --> 02:07:25,940


1121
