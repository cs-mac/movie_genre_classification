2
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:54,652
Shall we ask them if they want to play?

3
00:00:55,354 --> 00:00:57,083
Yeah, good idea.

4
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:58,620
Excuse me...

5
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:03,621
Excuse me - yoo-hoo! Do you want to play?

6
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:06,424
I think they're busy...whoops!

7
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:10,062
Let's goooooo!

8
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,601
Kings of the jungle

9
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:12,863
And queens!

10
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,529
Coming through!

11
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:15,731
Lions in a hurry!

12
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:18,274
We're small but we're as tough as...! Ow.

13
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:19,103
Sorry.

14
00:01:19,278 --> 00:01:20,609
Let's play with the old guys!

15
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,576
They love us!

16
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:23,271
Yeah, they love us!

17
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:25,373
Eddie! James!

18
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:27,884
Oh no.

19
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:29,719
Were we ever like that?

20
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:30,617
Come on, Suki, fight me! Fight me!

21
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,950
Small? Must have been.

22
00:01:32,124 --> 00:01:33,455
No - lively.

23
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,753
Er, no, I don't think so

24
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,288
Oh, look fierce.

25
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:45,528
How's that?

26
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,332
Absolutely terrifying

27
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:49,063
Thank you. Thought it was.

28
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:55,238
Ow, ow! Excuse me, claws,
claws, thank you!

29
00:01:55,414 --> 00:01:56,972
Go find a crocodile to play with.

30
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:58,912
They love this. They love this.

31
00:01:59,085 --> 00:01:59,779
No we don't.

32
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:00,941
Yes you do.

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,348
No we don't.

34
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:13,162
Eurrgh. You've got really stinky breath.

35
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:14,866
I'm never going to get old.

36
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,628
It's boring...and you get bad breath.

37
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:20,638
Race you to the top.

38
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,032
Come on, Linus.

39
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:25,769
You're so slow!

40
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,812
Wrong way, wrong way, wrong way.

41
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,004
Linus, come on!

42
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:31,240
Okay nobody panic.

43
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,748
I'm panicking, I'm panicking.

44
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:34,818
Just say no next time...

45
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:36,750
pretend you've got a foot injury...

46
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:37,820
Did it!

47
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:41,316
Where is he?

48
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:44,092
What are you doing, Linus?

49
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:45,491
I'm enjoying the view.

50
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,461
You're stuck

51
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:47,360
No, I'm not.

52
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:50,400
Well come up here then,
the view's better.

53
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:51,526
Whoops.

54
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,398
Ohh. Ah.

55
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:53,299
Sorry!

56
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:55,565
Don't make me come up there
and smack you one!

57
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,468
Come on!

58
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:01,579
Ha...glad you could make it.

59
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:10,385
Wow. Amazing!

60
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,551
That is awesome!

61
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,824
Although we will have to get down again.

62
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,765
Look at the river

63
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,370
I wonder what's on the other side.

64
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,564
Wanderers, lions that would kill us
all if they could.

65
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:31,933
Mum says the river's so dangerous
it keeps them away.

66
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,978
Well, who are they, then?

67
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:37,481
They're not James and Eddie.

68
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,316
I don't know.

69
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:40,549
We should tell Mum -

70
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,154
There you are. Tell me what, Suki?

71
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,723
We saw some lions, mum.

72
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:49,952
Can't hear you darling.

73
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,461
Is this really the best way to do this?

74
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,096
We saw some lions
we've never seen before.

75
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:56,562
Oh, don't fib, Linus.

76
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,533
We did! Down by the river.

77
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:01,696
There are no other lions near here, Suki

78
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:04,799
You never believe me.
Why don't you believe me?

79
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:07,775
Ok, you saw some lions.

80
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,478
Whoops...
I'm going down...Ow.

81
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:16,345
Linus, look at the state of you.
You're a mess.

82
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:20,849
Come on, I'll clean you up.
Come on.

83
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,150
Eugh. Get off mum.

84
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,762
You're getting spit on me.

85
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,264
Mum, why's Suki so ugly?

86
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,924
Mum, why's Linus got a face
like a bottom?

87
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,460
A baboon's bottom...

88
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:35,702
They never tell you it's going
to be this tiring.

89
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:50,186
Everyone's so dozy.

90
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:54,349
It's called relaxing. We're lucky.

91
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:56,684
We can relax because we've got the pride.

92
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:59,660
Most animals don't know what
it's like to live like this.

93
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,163
They should come and live with us.

94
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,062
No, that wouldn't work.

95
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:04,031
Why not?

96
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,194
We'd eat them.

97
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:44,808
Wanderers. Oh no.

98
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,275
I told you, I told you I'd seen them.

99
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:48,504
Shut up!

100
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:53,384
Get back. Eve look at this.

101
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,654
Wanderers.

102
00:05:58,824 --> 00:05:59,586
Oh dear.

103
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:01,555
Come on. Let's go give'em
the old one-two.

104
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,787
The old what? Oh the old one-two. Yes.

105
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:26,110
Oh dear, oh dear oh dear.

106
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,684
I can smell fear.

107
00:06:31,156 --> 00:06:33,681
Oh really, it's not coming
from this side.

108
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:35,326
Most certainly not, no.

109
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:39,828
You have two choices. Run or fight.

110
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:40,827
We could run.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,331
We're taking over.

112
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:45,902
I'm sorry but we rather like
everything the way it is.

113
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,269
Do we? Oh, yes we do.

114
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,001
You've got five seconds to get out.

115
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:53,474
Count it Harry.

116
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,477
One, two -

117
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:58,840
Oh, life's too short.

118
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:00,482
Nobody said go!

119
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,019
You said five seconds!
Not very sporting is it.

120
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,385
Get out of my way.

121
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,793
I'm not ready! No, wait, wait, wait. No!

122
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,486
Get him, Eddie. Bash him.

123
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,497
Come on old man. Is that the best
you can do?

124
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,132
Get out.

125
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:18,359
You can do it. You're winning.

126
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,269
You're losing.

127
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,202
I'll get up in a minute and then
you'll know what trouble is.

128
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,899
They're rubbish.

129
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,470
They need us. Eve, Megan,

130
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:29,238
you take the light one.
We'll take the dark one.

131
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,404
Mum. Be careful,

132
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:32,015
Mum. Stay back.

133
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,388
Get out of here. You don't belong here.

134
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:47,497
Where are you're men?

135
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,635
Go on. You're just a couple
of big bullies.

136
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:52,430
Go back to where you belong.

137
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:54,663
Bite him, Mum. Tear his ear off.

138
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,602
Scare them off!

139
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:00,636
Come on Harry. We don't fight women.

140
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,611
Leave us in peace!
Think we're a pushover?

141
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:08,882
Sending in the girls...I'd die of shame.

142
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:13,684
You've made a big mistake.

143
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,561
How did they cross the river?

144
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,828
It's full of crocodiles.

145
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,930
I'm scared.

146
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,898
Why did they attack us, Mum?

147
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:31,235
They want what we've got.

148
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,707
Did they hurt you?

149
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,776
We don't believe in pain, do we girls?

150
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,074
Ow!

151
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:42,479
Are you all right, Eddie?
Oh yes, yes, yes, quite all right.

152
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:43,746
I was wearing him down.

153
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:45,389
Oh yes, me too.

154
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:48,355
Why did that feel like the first round?

155
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,560
Looks like the Wanderers
want to take over.

156
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:53,323
And what the Wanderers want,
they usually get.

157
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:55,759
D'you know,

158
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:58,994
I think I'll just go and throw myself
off something very high.

159
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,741
Oh, I can't be bothered.

160
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,508
Is that a bit of your ear over there?

161
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:07,235
Pardon!

162
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:11,711
Oh, I rather think it is. Not to worry.

163
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,852
'Ear' today, gone tomorrow, what?

164
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:17,655
Is everyone here? Are you all right?

165
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:22,254
Where's Eve? Has anyone seen Eve?

166
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,366
Eve, Eve...

167
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,677
Oh no.

168
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:49,578
Oh Eve, what have they done to you?

169
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:58,787
Oh, Fleck.

170
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:01,960
Auntie Macheeba.

171
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:06,629
What's wrong with mum?

172
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:07,702
Fleck.

173
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:11,468
Get up mum, get up, please.

174
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,639
I'm so sorry, Fleck.
They've killed her.

175
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:24,782
We'll look after you now.
You'll never be alone.

176
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:38,665
Don't worry Fleck, you're with us now.
We're your family.

177
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:46,110
You can be a brother for to Linus
and Suki.

178
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,632
Will they come back?

179
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:18,298
I don't know.

180
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,510
Don't worry, Linus
we can look after ourselves.

181
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,504
You said it was safe here.

182
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,879
Oh come on you two, look around

183
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,853
we're the Pride, we're like,
I don't know.

184
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,491
We're like...

185
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:34,858
we're like the stars.

186
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,824
What? We only come out at night?

187
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:38,061
No.

188
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,391
We're pretty but we don't do anything?

189
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,597
No.

190
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:45,601
You are so dim...no,
everyone points at us?

191
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:50,970
No, Fleck, on our own we sparkle
but together we really shine.

192
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,134
We're like a perfect constellation

193
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,303
so much the better for being together.

194
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:56,841
Imagine if you were a leopard,

195
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:59,609
or a cheetah, hiding away,

196
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:03,516
Iiving on your own.
Nobody to be with. That's why

197
00:12:06,758 --> 00:12:09,454
Hmm, kids.

198
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:23,106
Follow me. Quietly now.

199
00:12:25,677 --> 00:12:28,077
We need to be strong
to protect ourselves.

200
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,579
To be strong we need to eat.

201
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:34,817
Right, hunting lesson.

202
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,749
Never hunt buffalo unless
you're with the pride.

203
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:43,621
They're dangerous,
they can hurt you. But zebra...

204
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:14,050
Suki, what are you doing up there?

205
00:13:15,093 --> 00:13:18,790
I can't see, I can't see...oops.

206
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:24,101
I wish we had stripes.
Beige is so boring.

207
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,804
Keep down until I say. They saw you!

208
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,840
She looked nice.
I wanted to play with her.

209
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:34,945
We're here to get food,
not make friends with it.

210
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,118
Now, what do you need
to remember when hunting?

211
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:43,379
That...we're all sparkly stars?

212
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:45,523
On our own we twinkle,
in a group we-

213
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,986
Forget the stars.

214
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,355
What was the question again?

215
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:55,057
When hunting: make use of every bit
of cover,

216
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:57,497
stay hidden from your prey
as long as possible.

217
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,159
And use surprise.

218
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,134
Suki, look at me.

219
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:04,173
We're not the quickest animals around,
but we're strong and we're smart.

220
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:08,669
Well some of us are.

221
00:14:09,314 --> 00:14:14,251
There, up ahead. Don't alert them.

222
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,011
What does alert mean?

223
00:14:18,423 --> 00:14:21,153
No! Will you stop mucking around!

224
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:23,886
Suki, will you stop mucking around!

225
00:14:24,262 --> 00:14:28,358
Watch, this time.
You'll have to do it one day.

226
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,335
Hunting lessons are stupid - let's play!

227
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,031
Yeah, let's play!

228
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,248
Mum, you alerted them.

229
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:47,876
Stay still. I'll distract them.

230
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,680
Buffalo will kill you.
Don't move till I get back.

231
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:01,761
Come on you big idiots.
Come on!

232
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:05,297
D'you know how stupid
you look in those horns?

233
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:08,269
She's very good at this sort of thing...

234
00:15:08,473 --> 00:15:10,202
That's right, run around a bit
and get warm...Call that chasing...?

235
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,235
Oh good, they've gone.

236
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,673
Hel-lo, over here.

237
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:15,142
Get down!

238
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:22,685
Uh oh.

239
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,251
It's all right Linus. Don't be scared.

240
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,490
Don't breathe...don't move.

241
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,932
They wouldn't want to eat me anyway.
I'm quite thin.

242
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,332
Who are you kidding, tubby.

243
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:40,762
Shoo, go away.

244
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,201
We come in peace!

245
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:44,036
Mum!

246
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:48,043
Help! Help mum. Help!

247
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:53,616
Run. Go on, run for it. Fast as you can.

248
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,546
Mum! Quick.

249
00:15:58,723 --> 00:15:59,655
I'm coming.

250
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:00,416
Help!

251
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,924
Don't. You. Dare.

252
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,841
Are you all right?

253
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:23,613
I'd thought I'd lost you.

254
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,780
Anyone hurt?

255
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:33,622
That was so much fun - can we go back
and play with them?

256
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,316
I hope you are joking!

257
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,697
These are great. Will I have them
when I grow up?

258
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,774
Yes but they won't work, Linus.

259
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:53,706
They won't work?
No.

260
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:55,843
Will mine work?
Yes.

261
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:59,609
What! That's not fair.

262
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:02,275
So, I'll be able to suck my own?

263
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:05,784
Oh God. No, love.

264
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:07,254
Why not?

265
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:09,450
We just...don't.
Why not?

266
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,425
I don't know, we just don't.

267
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,461
That's stupid. I'm going to.

268
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:15,796
Teeth! Teeth!

269
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:18,091
Wasn't me!

270
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:21,171
I haven't finished.

271
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,508
All right come on that's enough,
you've had enough.

272
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,748
Hello Fleck.

273
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,044
Excuse me, budge up.

274
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:37,244
Ow, get off Fleck!

275
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:38,912
What do you think you're doing?

276
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,352
What does it look like?

277
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,183
Mum, Fleck's stealing our supper.

278
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:46,922
The Wanderers killed his mother.
He needs milk.

279
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:49,658
So!? Forget it! No way!

280
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:51,995
We help each other out around here.

281
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,797
How else is Fleck going to survive?

282
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,906
That's our milk!

283
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:59,066
Top snack! Sorry,
I think I've finished it all up.

284
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,303
Go away, she's our mother.

285
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,916
You have to be nice to me. I am an orphan.

286
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:13,724
James, James. Not there!

287
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,117
Ah, that's better.

288
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:18,819
Thanks a bunch, we were playing there!

289
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,595
Turned out sunny again.

290
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:27,836
Mm. Have you ever eaten fish?

291
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,439
Er. No, have you?

292
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,042
No. I had a bat once.

293
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,202
Bat? Oh what,
those little flying foxy thingys?

294
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,608
Mmm, yes,
those are the fellas,

295
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:39,215
yes. Never again. Fiddly little bones.

296
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:40,513
Hi Fleck.

297
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:41,583
Alright Linus?

298
00:18:41,886 --> 00:18:43,717
Mum says we should be friends.

299
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:45,685
Did I ever tell you that I was an orphan?

300
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:47,950
No. What, like little what's his name...

301
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:49,650
Iick, is it? Flock? Flesh?

302
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:50,419
Fleck-

303
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:52,256
Fleck. Fleck. That's the one!

304
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,791
Not the whiskers, okay!

305
00:18:54,232 --> 00:18:56,666
Yes. But I'm very well adjusted.

306
00:18:57,268 --> 00:18:57,893
You are indeed.

307
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:00,230
Ooh, I could murder an antelope,
couldn't you?

308
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,480
Have you noticed

309
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,988
the lions never
really hang out with the lionesses?

310
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:23,992
Mm. I don't get it.
No, nor do l.

311
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:26,292
We'll always stick together.

312
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:28,159
Whatever the world throws at us.

313
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,391
Yes...

314
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,949
Linus, look.

315
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:49,548
It's the river.

316
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,962
I saw someone.

317
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,571
Who are they?
You and me, you big loser.

318
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,598
Well...obviously.

319
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,736
I want to know what's over there.

320
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:16,036
Mum says it's dangerous.

321
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,579
Parents say that about everything.
It's sharp,

322
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,684
it's poisonous,
it'll have your eye out...

323
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:26,455
I've been across.

324
00:20:26,624 --> 00:20:27,886
Fleck, you haven't.

325
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,686
Yes I have. Eight times.

326
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:30,987
You are such a liar.

327
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:34,393
That is where the Wanderers live.
We know that.

328
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,091
What we don't know
is how they got across.

329
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:39,930
The river's so wide.

330
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,096
And it's got those in it.

331
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:48,343
The Wanderers wouldn't care.
They're wild and mad.

332
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:51,277
They eat their own cubs and ride on
the backs of elephants.

333
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:52,939
Everyone knows about them.

334
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,245
They're going to come back
and get us all one day.

335
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,012
But they're too scary for kids

336
00:20:57,188 --> 00:20:58,587
Iike you to know about.

337
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:01,490
Ohh!

338
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,453
What's that?

339
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:05,858
I'm guessing we shouldn't try to eat it.

340
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,666
Hello - listen, we're all animals.

341
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,630
Let's talk this through sensibly.

342
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:14,099
Talking to animals. Nutter!

343
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:17,173
They say you should always
look a cobra in the eye.

344
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:21,237
That's it Linus, that's it.

345
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:29,013
Or was it never look a cobra in the eye?

346
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:29,881
Run!

347
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:31,021
Run!

348
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:33,486
You try to be nice and they just
gob on you...

349
00:21:33,758 --> 00:21:35,020
Ooh, yuck!

350
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,561
I took on sixteen cobras once

351
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,400
and within two minutes
they were all screaming for mercy.

352
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:51,174
Shut up Fleck.

353
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,181
Where've you been?

354
00:22:02,353 --> 00:22:03,547
Down to the ri-

355
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:06,690
To this really nice place
not near the river.

356
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:08,820
Nowhere near the river.

357
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,092
I told you not to go near the river.

358
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:16,393
I want you to make me a solemn promise
that you won't go exploring again.

359
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:22,403
What she meant was,
don't go exploring unless you discover

360
00:22:22,576 --> 00:22:24,601
how the Wanderers got across the river.

361
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:25,972
You think so?

362
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:28,671
Mm. If we find the path we'll be heroes.

363
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:29,907
Imagine that, Linus.

364
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:30,947
Wherever we go

365
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:34,053
they'll say there go
those fearless lions...

366
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:37,856
Well, I wouldn't say I'm fearless,
to be honest.

367
00:22:38,158 --> 00:22:40,422
But I've got a good sense of direction.

368
00:22:44,064 --> 00:22:45,463
Where are we?

369
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:47,065
I have no idea.

370
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,397
We need to find the river.
Which way is it?

371
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,061
That way.

372
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:54,002
Or that way.

373
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:57,568
That way is also possible.

374
00:22:59,179 --> 00:22:59,873
Did you hear that?

375
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:00,535
What?

376
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:01,874
That noise.

377
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,239
Thunder.

378
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,522
Trees...

379
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:15,621
walking trees?

380
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:18,021
Well that's just ridiculous.

381
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:21,532
Well, what's that?
It's a big curly thing.

382
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:25,062
Back Linus. Get back...Run!

383
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:26,836
They can't be that fast.

384
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:30,569
Don't get under their feet, Linus!

385
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:34,514
Oh, thank you. Now why didn't
I think of that?

386
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:37,548
Suki, distract them, like mum does.

387
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:38,510
How!?

388
00:23:38,685 --> 00:23:39,344
I don't know

389
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,478
stand on your back legs,
do a dance. I don't know.

390
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:44,385
Keep running.

391
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:48,924
Why is everyone bigger than us? Run!

392
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:56,562
Wow. Great noise! Wish I could do that!

393
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:58,699
Keep running.

394
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:07,304
Phew. We've lost them.

395
00:24:12,853 --> 00:24:14,411
This must be how the Wanderers got across.

396
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:15,646
We've done it!

397
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:17,050
Well we're not going over it.

398
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:19,988
Look, we're having an adventure.
It's exciting!

399
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:26,566
Why did I listen to you?

400
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:29,165
Come on, Linus.

401
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,306
I can't. I've just remembered something.

402
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:34,838
What?

403
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,872
I'm a terrible coward.

404
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:41,475
Go away you big bullies!

405
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:48,679
Oops.

406
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,158
One, two, three...

407
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:57,087
Did it.

408
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,558
Come on Linus, keep up.

409
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,833
I'm slipping! I'm slipping.

410
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:07,997
Hold on with both paws.

411
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:11,137
I'm dangling. I'm dangling.

412
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:12,570
Made it.

413
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:15,179
You can do it.

414
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,077
I'm falling, I'm falling.

415
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,274
Hang on. You'll be fine.

416
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:19,509
I'm not.

417
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,711
Linus, quickly.

418
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:23,082
Help me Suki!

419
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:25,622
Come on Linus, quick.

420
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:30,125
Oh no, hang on.
Pull yourself up.

421
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:31,829
That's it, that's it, that's it.

422
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:32,896
Good grip, good grip.

423
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:34,556
Come on Linus, come on.

424
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:37,328
You can do it; you can do it.

425
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:41,304
That's it. Jump!

426
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,837
Yeah, you made it.

427
00:25:55,855 --> 00:26:02,283
Linus, Suki

428
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:12,567
Are you sure you don't know
where they went?

429
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:13,933
Think, Fleck.

430
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:16,632
I'm sure they wouldn't
do anything dangerous.

431
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,974
Mum.

432
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:23,138
Suki, Linus

433
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,017
What is this place?

434
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:34,953
Oh, I don't know.

435
00:26:35,128 --> 00:26:36,789
It's like a graveyard.

436
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:38,863
I wonder who did all the killing.

437
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:42,426
Yes, fascinating - please can we go now?

438
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:52,306
Suki, it's a Wanderer!

439
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:54,640
Yeah, I can see him.

440
00:26:55,582 --> 00:26:58,176
At last, some posh visitors.

441
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:01,149
The neighbourhood's been going
downhill for far too long.

442
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,649
Suki!

443
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:10,119
Good idea, have a lie down.

444
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:13,626
You're either very brave
to have come here,

445
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,927
or very stupid. Which is it?

446
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:16,761
Brave -

447
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:17,425
Stupid -

448
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:19,629
First they use girls to do their fighting.

449
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,001
Now they're sending in the cubs.

450
00:27:22,175 --> 00:27:24,541
Why don't you pick a fight
with someone your own size?

451
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:27,839
I do, all the time. You're light relief.

452
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:34,114
Oi - you eat my brother
and you're dead meat.

453
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:40,115
Ha. Well, it makes a change from the
begging and snivelling I usually get.

454
00:27:41,895 --> 00:27:44,295
I think I'll let you off, this time.

455
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:51,097
Let's go home.

456
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:53,501
I think the river is definitely that way.

457
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:56,164
In that case, we better go this way.

458
00:28:10,457 --> 00:28:16,123
Uh oh. Hyenas.
Don't show them we're scared...

459
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:21,061
If we stand and face them together
we might be all right.

460
00:28:25,972 --> 00:28:27,599
Linus, what are you doing?

461
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:28,465
I'm hiding.

462
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:29,130
What?

463
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:30,333
I'm hiding.

464
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,239
Linus? Help me, Linus.

465
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:33,709
I'm stuck.

466
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,110
Can you cover my bottom with leaves?

467
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:40,844
Go away, please.

468
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:08,544
Bloody hyenas.
I'll give you something to laugh about.

469
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:21,316
Stay away, until you're old enough
to look after yourself.

470
00:29:24,664 --> 00:29:26,825
Oh, thank you.

471
00:29:31,037 --> 00:29:32,766
He's lovely.

472
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:36,274
Can I come out now?

473
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,339
Did I miss anything?

474
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,760
Suki, look, I didn't mean to-

475
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:05,136
Well you did, didn't you, Linus.

476
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:07,796
You took care of yourself, Linus.

477
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,676
Let's just get home, shall we.

478
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:20,442
There's a problem.

479
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,455
We've no choice. We've got to swim.

480
00:30:23,623 --> 00:30:24,555
Are you sure?

481
00:30:24,724 --> 00:30:27,158
Things can't get any worse, can they?

482
00:30:27,694 --> 00:30:29,423
Oh no, I suppose not.

483
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:34,059
Oh come on. Right, are you ready?

484
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:35,724
I'll go first.

485
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:50,604
Come on. Come on Linus. Jump, jump.

486
00:30:52,452 --> 00:30:53,885
...and keep your mouth closed.

487
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:56,578
Why didn't mum give us swimming lessons?

488
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:01,386
Eugh, I've got water in my whiskers!

489
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,692
Crocodile

490
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:12,804
quick, faster,
faster! Faster Linus, quick.

491
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:18,636
We made it.

492
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:22,973
So that's why
the Wanderers don't swim.

493
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,479
That was refreshing.
I'll race you back.

494
00:31:29,656 --> 00:31:32,181
I'm actually rather tired.

495
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:37,496
Okay. Which way is it...?

496
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:41,699
We were on a mission-

497
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:44,462
Have you any idea how worried I was?

498
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:46,531
You could have been trampled
by elephants,

499
00:31:46,706 --> 00:31:47,798
attacked by hyenas,

500
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:49,532
eaten by crocodiles.

501
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:50,403
Who told you about the...?

502
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,009
We're fine, mum.

503
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:54,078
And we discovered
where the Wanderers got across.

504
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:56,545
Doesn't that make us heroes?

505
00:31:56,816 --> 00:31:58,147
I'm your mother.

506
00:31:58,618 --> 00:32:01,485
You don't have to do anything
to be my heroes.

507
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:04,884
And now the bridge is down,

508
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:07,754
the Wanderers won't ever come back,
will they?

509
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:10,785
No. Maybe not.

510
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:15,658
Fantastic day...best ever.

511
00:32:15,835 --> 00:32:19,100
Growing up so fast.

512
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:39,452
What do you think
my Wanderer's doing right now?

513
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:43,719
Remember how great he was, Linus?

514
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:47,059
Hyena on the left,
our big lion takes him -aagh,

515
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:49,701
hyena on the right, he whacks her, aagh.

516
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:53,801
I enjoyed it more the first
three hundred times you told it,

517
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,567
Suki. I thought you hated violence.

518
00:32:56,743 --> 00:32:58,438
Violence is allowed if...

519
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:00,670
you're saving the life
of the one you love.

520
00:33:00,847 --> 00:33:02,872
He doesn't love you,
you silly tart.

521
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:04,710
He likes killing things.

522
00:33:04,884 --> 00:33:06,784
He'd've killed you
if I hadn't been there.

523
00:33:06,953 --> 00:33:07,612
No, he wouldn't.

524
00:33:07,787 --> 00:33:10,278
And you're allowed to kill hyenas
because they're ugly.

525
00:33:10,757 --> 00:33:13,817
He is so cool. I wonder what his name is?

526
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:15,187
Cuddles?

527
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:16,385
Floppy?

528
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:17,324
Oh shut up.

529
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:20,261
He's amazing, really powerful.

530
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:22,025
The Wanderers are such free spirits.

531
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:25,034
Going where they want,
doing what they want.

532
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:27,138
They're shaggy old tramps!

533
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:29,274
They're an embarrassment
to lions everywhere.

534
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:30,204
And you're not?

535
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:30,865
Ow.

536
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:32,476
Sorry.

537
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:34,875
How many times do you have to be told?

538
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:36,878
Look at our lot, Linus.

539
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:40,348
Watch amazed as Eddie manages
to roll over.

540
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,317
Gasp as James grumbles

541
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:45,252
that warthog isn't as tasty as
it used to be!

542
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:54,833
Baboons!

543
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:59,003
You are such a boy.

544
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,804
Okay, I'm coming to get you.

545
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,508
Why do they have red bottoms?

546
00:34:10,683 --> 00:34:13,743
Oh, I don't want to think about it,
thanks.

547
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,410
Come here, you cheeky little monkey.

548
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:18,819
For goodness sake, Linus.
You'll never catch her.

549
00:34:18,991 --> 00:34:20,458
Course I will.

550
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:23,192
Good shot.

551
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,227
Ow!

552
00:34:25,698 --> 00:34:27,598
Oh yes, and again.

553
00:34:32,705 --> 00:34:34,195
Eugh!

554
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:37,341
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
That will serve you right.

555
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:42,239
That is disgusting.

556
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:47,952
Poof! Do you mind walking ahead, Linus.

557
00:34:49,956 --> 00:34:52,891
I don't think it'll catch on
as a fragrance.

558
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:08,206
Now listen Suki,
the easiest target is the throat.

559
00:35:08,374 --> 00:35:11,104
But if you can help it,
stay away from the sharp bits.

560
00:35:12,712 --> 00:35:13,804
Don't give me that look.

561
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,039
Mum, I'm not interested in hunting.

562
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:18,376
It's boring and really mean.

563
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:21,384
Suki, hunting is not
an optional activity,

564
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:24,352
Iike doing hyena impressions,
or scratching.

565
00:35:24,524 --> 00:35:27,618
It's the difference between
living and dying.

566
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,350
Why can't we just eat grass?

567
00:35:29,529 --> 00:35:30,553
Everyone else does.

568
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,595
I know it's frightening the first time.

569
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:33,697
I'm not frightened.

570
00:35:33,866 --> 00:35:36,061
Yes you are, if you've got any sense.

571
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:42,400
Watch and learn.

572
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:51,475
Oh god. Mum.

573
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:56,654
Parents are so embarrassing.

574
00:36:11,304 --> 00:36:13,499
Fine creature, that Macheeba.

575
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:17,203
Does something for the old loins.

576
00:36:17,577 --> 00:36:19,204
She does something for the old lions?

577
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:21,106
No, loins.

578
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,771
Oh loins, yes. She does indeed.

579
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:28,810
You don't mind eating it, then?

580
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:30,350
Well, it's dead now.

581
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:32,115
Shame to waste it really.

582
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:34,988
See these?

583
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:36,558
Teeth? Er, yes.

584
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:38,492
Why do you think they're so big?

585
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:40,359
So we don't lose them?

586
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:43,297
They're not for nibbling watermelons,
are they?

587
00:36:44,804 --> 00:36:46,135
I know you think it's cruel

588
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,535
but this is what lions do.

589
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:52,943
You can scavenge for a while,
but in the end

590
00:36:53,112 --> 00:36:54,511
you have to pull your own weight.

591
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,875
Why? They don't.

592
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:57,606
Who?

593
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,512
James and Eddie. They don't!

594
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:05,589
Not forgetting our manners
are we ladies?

595
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:09,055
Thank you!

596
00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:12,495
Room for a little one?

597
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,298
Excuse me. Mind your backs.

598
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:16,765
Mmm, this is good.

599
00:37:16,936 --> 00:37:20,497
How come the male lions get to lie
around waiting for us

600
00:37:20,673 --> 00:37:21,799
to kill their food for them,

601
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:23,908
just because they're guys?

602
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:25,475
Because...

603
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,177
You know, you're right,
it is incredibly annoying.

604
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:31,611
Well done everyone.

605
00:37:31,784 --> 00:37:36,812
First rate. Very tasty.

606
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:39,253
Just the job.
This'll set me up.

607
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:41,916
Hey, can the rest of us have a go now?

608
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:42,992
Back off,

609
00:37:44,163 --> 00:37:45,323
I'll not tell you again.

610
00:37:45,498 --> 00:37:47,466
I love liver. I hope it hasn't gone?

611
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:51,535
Who does he think he is?
Go on. Send him back.

612
00:37:51,704 --> 00:37:54,730
Just get away, get off. Wait your turn!

613
00:37:54,907 --> 00:37:56,067
Off with ya!

614
00:37:57,043 --> 00:37:58,510
Who's rattled your cage?

615
00:37:58,678 --> 00:37:59,645
Who's he?

616
00:37:59,812 --> 00:38:03,441
Slush? Lush? Keeps himself to himself.

617
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:05,941
Mother's the skinny one over there.

618
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,710
You know, the one with the nice legs,
what's-her-face.

619
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:10,350
I can't keep up. Who's the father?

620
00:38:10,523 --> 00:38:11,888
No idea.

621
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:14,859
What am I saying - me, I'm the father.

622
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:17,325
Really? Congratulations.

623
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:26,661
All right Sukes?

624
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:29,137
Su-Kl, Flecks.

625
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:32,141
You know, I killed one five times
this size the other day.

626
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:33,744
Oh, go away!

627
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:40,383
You know the trouble with you, Linus,

628
00:38:40,553 --> 00:38:42,680
is you let your sister push you around.

629
00:38:42,855 --> 00:38:44,948
Yeah, yeah, bleuhh bleuhh.

630
00:38:45,124 --> 00:38:47,524
Like you really show her who's boss.

631
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:51,390
Mm. this is good stuff, this.

632
00:38:55,568 --> 00:38:57,433
Girls. Huh.

633
00:38:57,603 --> 00:39:01,164
Yeah, they are so...Iike us-?

634
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,466
No they're not-

635
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:03,539
No they're not.

636
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:05,301
Life's just one big party for them.

637
00:39:05,478 --> 00:39:07,378
They just chase things and have cubs.

638
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:08,979
We males are supposed to go out

639
00:39:09,148 --> 00:39:12,311
and fight for supremacy all the time,
to the death.

640
00:39:12,485 --> 00:39:13,383
Ha. Do we?

641
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:17,921
It could be the two of us one day,
trying to kill each other.

642
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,948
Of course,
I have had it especially tough,

643
00:39:20,126 --> 00:39:21,559
because of course, I am an orphan.

644
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:23,786
...you're an orphan, I know.

645
00:39:25,965 --> 00:39:29,230
I'm starving.
They can't still be hungry.

646
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:32,703
Is it just me or is this slightly off?

647
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:52,190
Not bad...Very tasty.

648
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:07,429
Hi Suki.

649
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:08,971
Hello Fleck.

650
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,674
Why are you stalking me?

651
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:12,208
Stalking you? Oh no, believe me,

652
00:40:12,378 --> 00:40:14,107
if I was stalking you,
you'd soon know about it.

653
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,475
It wouldn't be very good stalking then,
would it.

654
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:19,015
What's that in your mouth?

655
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,451
Nothing.

656
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,985
It looks like grass.

657
00:40:23,556 --> 00:40:26,047
I'm thinking of becoming a vegetarian,
actually.

658
00:40:26,292 --> 00:40:27,623
Taste nice?

659
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:29,317
Great. Yum.

660
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:31,019
What are you looking at?

661
00:40:31,197 --> 00:40:33,165
Nothing. Nothing. Well, you, I suppose.

662
00:40:33,332 --> 00:40:34,162
Well pack it in, you freak.

663
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,164
Come on then. Let's have a bit of a play.

664
00:40:36,335 --> 00:40:37,859
Fleck get off - God you're heavy.

665
00:40:38,037 --> 00:40:41,473
Oww. Get your scuzzy paws off me.

666
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:45,069
What is it about teenage boys!

667
00:40:45,244 --> 00:40:46,302
I only wanted a tickle.

668
00:40:57,389 --> 00:41:00,153
Linus, what is it about the males
around here?

669
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,752
Over there, the Wanderers are tough
and strong;

670
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:06,455
they'd say
"Tell me your problems, little Suki,

671
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,600
and I'll sort it out like a real lion".

672
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:10,166
More like, "I'm, stupid me,

673
00:41:10,336 --> 00:41:12,930
but I manage to make it
look like bravery".

674
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,337
Mm, warthogs.

675
00:41:18,711 --> 00:41:19,939
Hunting lesson.

676
00:41:20,112 --> 00:41:22,137
Oh no, do we have to?

677
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:23,781
Oh, not again.

678
00:41:28,888 --> 00:41:35,054
Linus, Suki...there!

679
00:41:35,294 --> 00:41:38,286
Aw, Hello, who are you?

680
00:41:38,464 --> 00:41:39,795
I've brought you some homework.

681
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:42,490
What? Mum, no!

682
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:47,331
Hello. Ah look, it's really cute.

683
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:48,871
Ugh. I don't believe this.

684
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:52,169
It's all right;
I'm not going to hurt you.

685
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,938
Don't play with your food Suki!
It's not a toy.

686
00:41:56,682 --> 00:42:00,812
Let me kill it mummy - Mum,
I mean - you, lioness there.

687
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:01,247
I'll kill it.

688
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,720
Now go on, when she's not looking...run.
Shoo!

689
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:07,620
No! Don't let it get away Suki!

690
00:42:07,793 --> 00:42:08,350
Now shoo!

691
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:09,323
Suki!

692
00:42:09,495 --> 00:42:11,690
Bye. Have a good life!

693
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:14,389
Don't swim in the river:
there's a crocodile...

694
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,228
Cheeky pig, gave me the slip!
Macheeba drags a wildebeest

695
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:24,171
Ok, you don't want to hunt.

696
00:42:24,343 --> 00:42:27,278
You want to eat animals other lions
have killed.

697
00:42:27,646 --> 00:42:29,637
Well here you are.

698
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:30,872
Where are you going?

699
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:36,488
To sleep. It's all yours Suki.
See how long it lasts you.

700
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:38,088
Okay. Bye.

701
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:44,228
I'll save this for later.
I'll just go and sit in the shade.

702
00:42:52,504 --> 00:42:57,441
Oh no, what are you looking at?

703
00:42:57,609 --> 00:43:00,976
You know what, you birds badly
need a makeover...

704
00:43:01,146 --> 00:43:03,706
Ughhh, not a good look.

705
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:08,483
Oi, stay back.

706
00:43:14,727 --> 00:43:16,524
Oh dear, they've come back again.

707
00:43:18,564 --> 00:43:20,532
Thank you, Linus.

708
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:22,098
Get your own dinner!

709
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,258
Go get 'em huntress.

710
00:43:25,204 --> 00:43:31,803
Stay away! This is ridiculous.

711
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:33,569
Don't all rush to help!

712
00:43:35,147 --> 00:43:36,273
I would help you but...

713
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:39,178
I'm enjoying watching you struggle
too much.

714
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:47,215
Get stuffed, you big turkeys.

715
00:43:56,869 --> 00:43:59,531
I never really liked wildebeest
much anyway.

716
00:43:59,905 --> 00:44:01,031
Terribly rich.

717
00:44:02,243 --> 00:44:03,267
Come on, Linus.

718
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:05,105
Show them you're better than Suki.

719
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,770
Kill something.

720
00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:09,508
You can't show your face back there
without a dead animal.

721
00:44:09,684 --> 00:44:16,146
Preferably a huge great,
fierce-looking- Ah.

722
00:44:16,391 --> 00:44:17,358
You'll do.

723
00:44:29,003 --> 00:44:30,994
Whoops. Buffalo.

724
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:35,908
Oh, here we go again.

725
00:44:37,946 --> 00:44:40,710
I'm no good at climbing trees.

726
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:48,015
Yeah, you don't look so smart now.

727
00:44:49,424 --> 00:44:53,986
Stop it! Just don't. Stop it!

728
00:44:55,663 --> 00:44:57,460
Go away, there's nothing to see.

729
00:44:57,966 --> 00:44:59,297
Go away.

730
00:45:07,475 --> 00:45:09,773
This is so humiliating.

731
00:45:09,944 --> 00:45:14,711
Um, are there any lions in the area?
I need a bit of help.

732
00:45:22,223 --> 00:45:23,747
Where've you been Linus?

733
00:45:24,192 --> 00:45:26,990
Chased up a tree by a buffalo.

734
00:45:27,662 --> 00:45:29,653
Just don't tell Fleck.

735
00:45:30,131 --> 00:45:31,359
Fleck...

736
00:45:31,532 --> 00:45:32,556
Suki!

737
00:45:32,734 --> 00:45:35,100
Oh brother, you are funny.

738
00:45:35,536 --> 00:45:36,696
You can laugh at me now

739
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:37,895
You're telling me

740
00:45:38,072 --> 00:45:41,564
But you'll see. One of these days,
you'll see.

741
00:45:41,743 --> 00:45:43,040
See what?

742
00:45:44,979 --> 00:45:47,413
So much still to learn.

743
00:46:01,396 --> 00:46:02,988
What was that?

744
00:46:03,531 --> 00:46:05,499
The Wanderers, Linus.

745
00:46:05,967 --> 00:46:07,264
They're back.

746
00:46:07,435 --> 00:46:09,027
They sound so angry.

747
00:46:09,203 --> 00:46:10,830
It's fantastic.

748
00:46:11,572 --> 00:46:13,472
You know, bad fantastic.

749
00:46:13,641 --> 00:46:14,869
They're restless.

750
00:46:15,043 --> 00:46:18,342
The rains haven't come.
They need to stay near the river.

751
00:46:18,813 --> 00:46:24,012
So will they be able to cross one day,
like before?

752
00:46:24,919 --> 00:46:26,819
I'm afraid they might.

753
00:46:30,658 --> 00:46:33,058
Did you hear that?
Yes.

754
00:46:33,227 --> 00:46:36,196
Should we do a ferocious roar back,
do you think?

755
00:46:36,364 --> 00:46:38,423
I suppose we should really.

756
00:46:46,574 --> 00:46:49,008
Tactically unsound, in point of fact.

757
00:46:57,819 --> 00:47:00,253
Go away before you break something.

758
00:47:04,459 --> 00:47:05,892
It's him!

759
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,830
Errrggh, how does that feel?!

760
00:47:11,632 --> 00:47:15,124
Clear off and take your fat friend
with you.

761
00:47:16,738 --> 00:47:18,228
He's still as brave...

762
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,309
Hello.

763
00:47:27,582 --> 00:47:28,674
Do I know you?

764
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:32,149
It's me who, it was me who
you saved my life.

765
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,788
A while ago. I was a cub.

766
00:47:35,323 --> 00:47:39,054
Oh, I remember. You've changed.

767
00:47:40,094 --> 00:47:44,827
Yes, I've sort of...
well I've thought about it ever since,

768
00:47:44,999 --> 00:47:46,523
see and um...I mean,

769
00:47:46,701 --> 00:47:49,499
you look like you probably do that
sort of thing every day.

770
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:51,729
Oh, you talking to yourself?

771
00:47:51,906 --> 00:47:52,838
Go away Fleck.

772
00:47:53,007 --> 00:47:54,167
Why?

773
00:47:54,342 --> 00:47:56,242
I'm talking to a real lion.

774
00:47:57,612 --> 00:48:01,104
He's gone. I wittered. I wittered!

775
00:48:01,282 --> 00:48:03,307
You don't like me because I'm an orphan,

776
00:48:03,484 --> 00:48:04,815
that's it Suki, isn't it?

777
00:48:04,986 --> 00:48:06,977
Forget being an orphan, okay?

778
00:48:07,155 --> 00:48:09,487
I don't care if you were brought up
by wasps.

779
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:12,851
Sometimes I just...want to be on my own.

780
00:48:14,061 --> 00:48:17,360
What are you-?
What are you doing?!

781
00:48:17,532 --> 00:48:18,624
What comes naturally!

782
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,427
Well it doesn't come naturally to me.

783
00:48:20,601 --> 00:48:22,000
Not with you.

784
00:48:22,203 --> 00:48:23,898
What's happening?

785
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:26,665
Linus! He just - oh never mind.

786
00:48:26,841 --> 00:48:28,240
What did you do, Fleck?

787
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:29,398
It's none of your business.

788
00:48:29,577 --> 00:48:31,545
Yes it is. She's my sister.

789
00:48:31,712 --> 00:48:32,940
We look out for each other.

790
00:48:33,114 --> 00:48:36,311
Oh yeah? Come on then, fight me.

791
00:48:36,484 --> 00:48:37,712
Ok, anytime, Fleck.

792
00:48:37,885 --> 00:48:40,410
Leave it, Linus. He's not worth it.

793
00:48:42,557 --> 00:48:44,787
He'd make hyena meat out of you.

794
00:48:45,126 --> 00:48:47,390
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that.

795
00:48:54,502 --> 00:48:55,867
So which of these are yours?

796
00:48:56,037 --> 00:48:57,629
Um.

797
00:48:59,373 --> 00:49:00,897
They all look quite similar, don't they?

798
00:49:01,075 --> 00:49:02,303
Oh, she is, definitely.

799
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:03,170
He.

800
00:49:03,344 --> 00:49:05,209
Uh? Oh. He, is it?

801
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,371
Those two over there are mine.

802
00:49:08,683 --> 00:49:10,014
They're mother and daughter,
aren't they?

803
00:49:10,184 --> 00:49:12,118
You got a problem with that?

804
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,448
No, no, no.

805
00:49:15,723 --> 00:49:17,350
Well, they're all very lovely anyway.

806
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:19,186
Absolutely.

807
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,458
Fleck was looking very handsome today.

808
00:49:22,697 --> 00:49:26,189
Fleck, Fleck, Fleck. Forget Fleck.

809
00:49:26,367 --> 00:49:28,392
You and he would make a good couple, Suki.

810
00:49:28,569 --> 00:49:29,695
Give me a break.

811
00:49:29,871 --> 00:49:31,065
Be nice to him.

812
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:33,867
You can't trust him. He creeps around.

813
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:35,508
Fleck would look after you.

814
00:49:35,676 --> 00:49:36,802
No he wouldn't.

815
00:49:36,978 --> 00:49:38,809
I'm really sorry he lost his parents.

816
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,744
But he is the most annoying lion
I've ever met.

817
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:44,517
Maybe if you spent more time with him.

818
00:49:44,685 --> 00:49:46,380
I've had enough of this.

819
00:49:47,054 --> 00:49:48,988
So much for the pride.

820
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:50,817
There are other lions in the world.

821
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:52,857
Like the...Wanderers.

822
00:49:53,027 --> 00:49:54,551
The Wanderers?

823
00:49:54,729 --> 00:49:55,457
Yeah.

824
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:56,688
They killed Fleck's mother.

825
00:49:56,864 --> 00:49:59,298
They're marauding assassins
who want to take over our Pride.

826
00:49:59,467 --> 00:50:00,832
You stay away from them.

827
00:50:01,602 --> 00:50:04,867
Are you two ever going to stop
shouting at each other?

828
00:50:09,744 --> 00:50:11,405
I'll show her.

829
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:16,748
Perfect.

830
00:50:21,589 --> 00:50:22,886
Don't alert it.

831
00:50:27,862 --> 00:50:29,523
Gently.

832
00:50:37,238 --> 00:50:42,175
Hello. It's all right.
I'm not going to hurt you.

833
00:50:44,979 --> 00:50:47,140
Let's clean you up nicely.

834
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:50,009
Oi, keep still. Keep still.

835
00:50:50,184 --> 00:50:52,118
Where are you going? Where are you going?

836
00:50:53,688 --> 00:50:57,454
Stay here, I'm going to be your
new mummy.

837
00:50:58,826 --> 00:51:08,258
Aww, there. I'm a nice fwiendly lion.

838
00:51:12,673 --> 00:51:14,834
I've got a surprise.

839
00:51:15,977 --> 00:51:16,739
Oh dear.

840
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:18,208
What kind of surprise?

841
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:20,142
You'll see. Follow me.

842
00:51:21,248 --> 00:51:22,715
Coming Linus?

843
00:51:22,883 --> 00:51:23,872
Ok!

844
00:51:28,222 --> 00:51:29,985
This better be good Suki.

845
00:51:32,893 --> 00:51:35,521
Oh, well done, Suki.

846
00:51:35,696 --> 00:51:37,027
Not bad, eh.

847
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:39,899
Who's going to kill it? Oh, I could.

848
00:51:40,067 --> 00:51:41,864
Just give me a moment to get in the mood.

849
00:51:42,036 --> 00:51:44,334
What? No, he's a pet.

850
00:51:44,505 --> 00:51:45,096
A what?

851
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:46,705
I've adopted him.

852
00:51:46,941 --> 00:51:49,603
I'm calling him Martin.

853
00:51:49,777 --> 00:51:51,768
You are completely mad.

854
00:51:52,146 --> 00:51:52,874
No I'm not!

855
00:51:53,047 --> 00:51:53,843
We eat antelope.

856
00:51:54,015 --> 00:51:55,380
Well you're not eating this one.

857
00:51:55,549 --> 00:51:55,981
We are!

858
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:56,980
No you're not!

859
00:51:57,151 --> 00:52:00,587
You are a lioness. Lionesses hunt.

860
00:52:00,755 --> 00:52:03,121
Nothing works unless we all contribute.

861
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:06,521
And you contribute nothing.
I've done my best with you, Suki.

862
00:52:06,694 --> 00:52:07,160
But...

863
00:52:07,328 --> 00:52:09,159
...But I'm tired of waiting for you
to grow up.

864
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:10,763
I can't have the boyfriend I want,

865
00:52:10,931 --> 00:52:12,865
at least I should be able to keep a pet!

866
00:52:13,034 --> 00:52:14,262
Boyfriend? What boyfriend?

867
00:52:14,435 --> 00:52:15,424
He's a Wanderer.

868
00:52:15,603 --> 00:52:17,036
A Wanderer? Yes.

869
00:52:17,204 --> 00:52:19,764
You stupid, selfish girl.

870
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:22,172
There are rules in this Pride, Suki.

871
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:25,270
Everyone has a role,
a home and a welcome.

872
00:52:25,446 --> 00:52:26,936
But you have to toe the line.

873
00:52:27,114 --> 00:52:30,208
I'm warning you.
Forget this nonsense, now.

874
00:52:30,384 --> 00:52:32,579
Oh stop nagging.

875
00:52:32,753 --> 00:52:34,186
Come back here.

876
00:52:36,424 --> 00:52:38,255
I know where I'll be wanted.

877
00:53:33,848 --> 00:53:35,748
Phew!

878
00:53:37,618 --> 00:53:41,554
Bye mum, bye Linus.

879
00:53:54,168 --> 00:53:55,499
Missed again.

880
00:54:20,094 --> 00:54:21,322
There he is.

881
00:54:26,267 --> 00:54:27,393
Hello.

882
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:32,497
I'm Suki. I don't know your name.

883
00:54:32,673 --> 00:54:33,901
Dark.

884
00:54:34,808 --> 00:54:36,435
What are your brothers called?

885
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,043
Tall and Handsome?

886
00:54:38,312 --> 00:54:41,475
Ha ha. You turned out well.

887
00:54:41,649 --> 00:54:43,344
Why did you leave your Pride?

888
00:54:43,517 --> 00:54:46,782
Um...they don't...understand me.

889
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:48,216
What don't they understand?

890
00:54:48,389 --> 00:54:52,086
Everything...me...wanting
to be with you?

891
00:54:52,259 --> 00:54:54,022
I understand you.

892
00:54:54,195 --> 00:54:56,186
Yes, I think you do.

893
00:54:56,363 --> 00:54:57,591
Come here.

894
00:55:02,903 --> 00:55:04,598
Are you going to introduce me
to your parents?

895
00:55:04,772 --> 00:55:06,763
No, I ate them.

896
00:55:06,941 --> 00:55:07,532
Eurghh!

897
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:09,073
That was a joke.

898
00:55:09,243 --> 00:55:12,371
Good, very funny!

899
00:55:21,222 --> 00:55:24,248
So, this is the lion's den.

900
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,453
They don't seem very friendly.

901
00:55:38,205 --> 00:55:40,605
Cant you stop them growling and glaring?

902
00:55:40,774 --> 00:55:44,141
Let them look. I'm proud of you.

903
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:46,245
Say hello to Suki.

904
00:55:51,452 --> 00:55:53,477
"Hello Suki, how are you?

905
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:55,588
Delighted to meet you, Suki."

906
00:55:55,756 --> 00:55:57,417
Hmm, I think they like me.

907
00:56:11,605 --> 00:56:13,800
Do you remember my pal, Harry?

908
00:56:17,511 --> 00:56:18,876
I'm afraid so.

909
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:21,309
Didn't you kill Fleck's Mum?

910
00:56:21,815 --> 00:56:24,682
Not bad looking, apart from her mouth.

911
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:32,450
Don't worry. He'll get used to you.

912
00:56:37,064 --> 00:56:38,861
Have you brought her back for good?

913
00:56:39,266 --> 00:56:41,894
Suki. She has a name.

914
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:44,094
She's just another mouth to feed.

915
00:56:44,271 --> 00:56:44,862
Kick her out.

916
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:46,028
No.

917
00:56:51,812 --> 00:56:57,216
Where is Suki? D'you think she's with him,
the Wanderer?

918
00:56:57,685 --> 00:56:58,777
No.

919
00:56:58,952 --> 00:57:00,715
I've driven her away.

920
00:57:01,221 --> 00:57:02,586
How could I do that?

921
00:57:02,756 --> 00:57:04,986
Stop it mum. Don't blame yourself.

922
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:06,353
Anything could have gone wrong,

923
00:57:06,527 --> 00:57:08,358
especially if she's crossed the river.

924
00:57:09,129 --> 00:57:11,188
She'll be back when she's hungry.

925
00:57:11,432 --> 00:57:15,300
I'll never forgive myself
if anything happens to her.

926
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:20,506
Come on, get up. Dark! Tickle me.

927
00:57:20,674 --> 00:57:21,971
Er No.

928
00:57:22,142 --> 00:57:23,939
Oh go on! You know you want to.

929
00:57:24,111 --> 00:57:25,237
No, someone might hear.

930
00:57:25,412 --> 00:57:30,440
Go on, tickle me. Come on,
tickle me please.

931
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:31,982
No we don't tickle.

932
00:57:32,152 --> 00:57:34,313
Okay, lick my ears then, I love that.

933
00:57:34,488 --> 00:57:35,716
You do mine first.

934
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:37,982
No! No way!

935
00:57:38,425 --> 00:57:39,323
Oh, forget it then.

936
00:57:39,493 --> 00:57:40,357
You're so boring.

937
00:57:40,527 --> 00:57:42,324
Ah, you'll get used to it.

938
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,967
Did you hear something?

939
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:54,774
I should have told them I was going.

940
00:58:02,249 --> 00:58:03,876
Suki!?

941
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,143
Linus!

942
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,753
What are you doing over there?

943
00:58:07,921 --> 00:58:10,355
I'm...well...I-I'm just...um...

944
00:58:10,524 --> 00:58:11,684
Who's this?

945
00:58:12,092 --> 00:58:12,922
My brother.

946
00:58:13,093 --> 00:58:15,288
You must come home, Suki.

947
00:58:15,462 --> 00:58:16,656
Mum'll forgive you.

948
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,161
I don't need forgiving.

949
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:20,562
We said we wouldn't be like the others

950
00:58:20,734 --> 00:58:22,463
we'd stay together forever.

951
00:58:22,636 --> 00:58:24,194
I can't go back.

952
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:27,205
I belong over here now,
with Dark.

953
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:29,539
Come away, Suki.

954
00:58:31,512 --> 00:58:32,843
I've got to go now.

955
00:58:33,313 --> 00:58:36,282
You're doing a terrible thing, Suki.

956
00:58:36,517 --> 00:58:38,508
You're betraying us...

957
00:58:52,566 --> 00:58:54,193
We need to go hunting.

958
00:58:55,702 --> 00:58:57,226
There's something you should...

959
00:58:57,404 --> 00:59:00,066
We hunt as a team. Everyone has a part.

960
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,730
You'll take the outside flank...

961
00:59:02,476 --> 00:59:05,775
Outside flank, my favourite position...

962
00:59:06,146 --> 00:59:07,909
remind me where that is, exactly?

963
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:10,015
We'll drive the wildebeest towards you.

964
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:13,413
You head them off at the front
and go for the kill.

965
00:59:14,455 --> 00:59:15,786
But...

966
00:59:15,956 --> 00:59:17,787
I don't do hunting.

967
00:59:23,997 --> 00:59:27,728
Outside flank...as far away as possible.

968
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:32,167
Jolly good. Okay.

969
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:38,040
Yes this'll do.

970
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,427
Stay down,

971
00:59:55,596 --> 01:00:00,158
Suki...oh no, they're coming towards me!

972
01:00:12,513 --> 01:00:15,038
I can't do this! I'm sorry.

973
01:00:15,215 --> 01:00:17,376
I'm not as confident as I look.

974
01:00:25,459 --> 01:00:28,326
Get off me! You don't understand...

975
01:00:28,495 --> 01:00:29,359
Leave her.

976
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:31,259
I said, leave her

977
01:00:39,606 --> 01:00:41,403
What d'you think you were playing at?

978
01:00:41,575 --> 01:00:42,837
I don't hunt.

979
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,637
I tried, I just can't.

980
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:46,711
Whatever you're used to, forget it.

981
01:00:46,947 --> 01:00:49,074
Here, it's kill or starve.

982
01:00:49,249 --> 01:00:50,978
Great date you turned out to be.

983
01:00:51,218 --> 01:00:53,186
You're not with your cosy
little family now.

984
01:00:53,353 --> 01:00:54,718
You're one of us.

985
01:00:55,656 --> 01:00:58,523
You let me down today.

986
01:01:09,036 --> 01:01:13,029
So, Linus - Suki never came back then?

987
01:01:14,975 --> 01:01:16,306
Well, she's probably been eaten by now.

988
01:01:16,476 --> 01:01:17,636
Shut up, Fleck.

989
01:01:17,811 --> 01:01:19,836
I always said she was weird. Well,

990
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:22,504
she's missed her chance with me.

991
01:01:22,749 --> 01:01:24,717
I'm such a catch, it's frightening.

992
01:01:24,885 --> 01:01:27,080
I'm at the height of my physical prowess.

993
01:01:28,221 --> 01:01:29,449
Hyenas!

994
01:01:31,525 --> 01:01:35,484
Oh, oh, ignore them,
they'll probably go away.

995
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:37,788
They're heading straight towards us.

996
01:01:37,965 --> 01:01:39,796
We'll have to drive them back.

997
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,460
Yeah, yeah we could...

998
01:01:41,635 --> 01:01:43,193
or should we...slip away, do you think?

999
01:01:43,837 --> 01:01:45,395
You don't want them to get the food,
do you?

1000
01:01:45,572 --> 01:01:46,061
Well...

1001
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:46,933
Come on!

1002
01:01:47,107 --> 01:01:49,667
Very unpredictable, your hyena.

1003
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:52,640
And actually I'm not that hungry.
See you later.

1004
01:01:57,684 --> 01:01:59,948
Fleck, we've got responsibilities now.

1005
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:00,677
Ooh! Responsibilities.

1006
01:02:00,854 --> 01:02:01,377
Help me...

1007
01:02:01,555 --> 01:02:02,817
It's not really a challenge is it!

1008
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:04,014
You do it yourself.

1009
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:05,954
You're just a bad of wind really,
aren't you!

1010
01:02:06,126 --> 01:02:07,787
Ahh, you kidder.

1011
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:23,366
Go on, get out.
Your not laughing now are you!

1012
01:02:23,877 --> 01:02:26,437
Well done Linus. So,

1013
01:02:26,613 --> 01:02:29,081
it took your sister leaving to make
a lion of you.

1014
01:02:30,217 --> 01:02:31,616
It's made Fleck quite sulky.

1015
01:02:31,785 --> 01:02:33,377
I've had enough of this.

1016
01:02:33,553 --> 01:02:36,044
Well, I couldn't be a cub forever.

1017
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:40,017
I'm proud of you.

1018
01:02:48,869 --> 01:02:52,134
I'm lonely. I'm missing my family.

1019
01:02:52,305 --> 01:02:53,499
They hate me here.

1020
01:02:53,674 --> 01:02:55,699
What do you expect? You won't hunt.

1021
01:02:55,876 --> 01:02:58,140
To them you're just a useless parasite.

1022
01:02:58,311 --> 01:03:00,973
See - you can be charming when you try.

1023
01:03:02,749 --> 01:03:05,183
I'll make a real effort to fit in.
I promise.

1024
01:03:05,352 --> 01:03:06,284
Thank you.

1025
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:08,887
Can we...spend some time alone?

1026
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:11,385
If that's what you want.

1027
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:16,990
I suppose I thought I was special
to you and...

1028
01:03:17,164 --> 01:03:19,928
well, now I wonder if I am.

1029
01:03:21,068 --> 01:03:21,932
You are.

1030
01:03:22,102 --> 01:03:24,832
Really? What's special about me?

1031
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:27,766
All my lionesses are special.

1032
01:03:27,941 --> 01:03:28,703
Excuse me?

1033
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:33,744
But you are...by far the most...special.

1034
01:03:37,184 --> 01:03:39,015
There's a rhino behind you.

1035
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,947
Please, this is important to me, Dark.

1036
01:03:42,122 --> 01:03:43,555
Look, a girl has to feel

1037
01:03:43,724 --> 01:03:46,056
that she's getting something back
from a relationship.

1038
01:03:46,226 --> 01:03:47,090
Mm.

1039
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:50,024
Otherwise it's all
Are you listening to me?

1040
01:03:50,197 --> 01:03:50,822
Yes.

1041
01:03:50,997 --> 01:03:52,794
You see, we never talk.

1042
01:03:52,966 --> 01:03:53,694
What?

1043
01:03:53,867 --> 01:03:55,664
I've got something really important
to tell you.

1044
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:56,894
You know that rhino I was just-

1045
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:00,972
I'm having your cubs.
Please say you're pleased.

1046
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:05,042
I am. But I think
we should talk about this later.

1047
01:04:13,653 --> 01:04:14,915
Dark!

1048
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:29,635
You could have told me there was a
rhino behind me!

1049
01:04:30,137 --> 01:04:31,263
Dark!?

1050
01:04:31,438 --> 01:04:33,872
You're supposed to be protecting me!

1051
01:04:50,223 --> 01:04:54,592
Hey - spare yourself the pain
of giving birth

1052
01:04:55,195 --> 01:04:56,856
go and drown yourself.

1053
01:04:57,197 --> 01:04:58,824
Shut your face, shaggy.

1054
01:05:20,187 --> 01:05:23,850
I will be so glad
when this pregnancy's over!

1055
01:05:24,257 --> 01:05:27,954
At least I won't be short of babysitters
- any volunteers?

1056
01:05:29,329 --> 01:05:30,523
You've got a bit of dirt on your face.

1057
01:05:30,697 --> 01:05:32,426
Let me just get that off.

1058
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,165
Stop it, come on.

1059
01:05:36,636 --> 01:05:39,469
Any more of that and I'll put Harry
in charge of you.

1060
01:06:09,739 --> 01:06:11,070
Come on cubs.

1061
01:06:16,612 --> 01:06:17,943
You're so cute!

1062
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:25,211
Aren't they gorgeous?
They've got your eyes.

1063
01:06:25,388 --> 01:06:27,686
Most of the cubs round here
have got my eyes.

1064
01:06:27,857 --> 01:06:28,915
Good looking aren't they.

1065
01:06:29,092 --> 01:06:30,286
Very funny.

1066
01:06:33,429 --> 01:06:37,525
Maybe he does love us.
It's all going to be fine.

1067
01:06:54,183 --> 01:06:56,481
Ohh, we are going to be happy.

1068
01:07:06,129 --> 01:07:07,653
Oh, there you are, James.

1069
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:09,627
I've been looking for you
all over the place.

1070
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,234
I'll tell you something
that never happened.

1071
01:07:13,403 --> 01:07:14,927
Lots of things never happened.

1072
01:07:15,371 --> 01:07:17,100
The Wanderers never came back.

1073
01:07:17,273 --> 01:07:18,604
Oh, they'll be back.

1074
01:07:19,075 --> 01:07:20,872
I smell them on the wind.

1075
01:07:21,044 --> 01:07:23,171
No, sorry, that was me. Can't be helped,

1076
01:07:24,247 --> 01:07:26,909
you know, perfectly natural.

1077
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:49,866
Well congratulations.
Four more mouths to feed.

1078
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:50,835
Leave us alone.

1079
01:07:51,007 --> 01:07:53,874
Come and play with your Uncle Harry.

1080
01:07:55,545 --> 01:07:58,013
No? Or maybe you'd rather
play with the hyenas.

1081
01:07:58,181 --> 01:07:59,944
Come on, come to me.

1082
01:08:00,116 --> 01:08:00,707
Cubs!

1083
01:08:00,883 --> 01:08:01,542
Get back!

1084
01:08:03,252 --> 01:08:05,743
Mewling, puking little spongers.

1085
01:08:06,022 --> 01:08:07,956
There, it's all right.

1086
01:08:08,858 --> 01:08:11,452
Do take care of them, won't you.

1087
01:08:20,303 --> 01:08:21,736
The thing about you, Linus,

1088
01:08:21,904 --> 01:08:25,135
is you're too much of a mummy's boy
ever to leave the Pride.

1089
01:08:25,308 --> 01:08:27,105
Shut up and kill something.

1090
01:08:27,276 --> 01:08:31,235
But me, I'm ready to leave.
I've had enough.

1091
01:08:31,414 --> 01:08:32,176
Well, go on then.

1092
01:08:32,348 --> 01:08:36,512
Nothing anybody says will stop me
I'll be off and on my way.

1093
01:08:36,686 --> 01:08:37,618
Why not go now?

1094
01:08:37,787 --> 01:08:39,914
Oh yeah, I know what this is about,

1095
01:08:40,089 --> 01:08:41,886
this is because I'm an orphan, isn't it.

1096
01:08:42,058 --> 01:08:45,357
Fleck, if I have to hear the word
"orphan" from you one more time

1097
01:08:45,528 --> 01:08:46,995
I'll bite your legs off,

1098
01:08:47,163 --> 01:08:49,358
one by one, and eat them.

1099
01:08:49,532 --> 01:08:51,432
Ooh, what's got into you.

1100
01:09:28,971 --> 01:09:32,134
Cubs! Where are you?

1101
01:09:33,476 --> 01:09:35,706
Don't play around now...
Mummy's getting scared...

1102
01:09:43,819 --> 01:09:47,755
I love you so much, don't do this! Cubs.

1103
01:09:53,396 --> 01:09:54,795
What have you done with my cubs?

1104
01:09:54,964 --> 01:09:58,161
Have you lost something? How careless.

1105
01:09:58,334 --> 01:10:00,666
No, no. How could you?

1106
01:10:00,836 --> 01:10:03,532
They were my babies -
they were innocent.

1107
01:10:03,706 --> 01:10:05,230
There's not enough food.

1108
01:10:05,408 --> 01:10:06,807
What will Dark say when I tell him

1109
01:10:06,976 --> 01:10:08,238
you've murdered his cubs?

1110
01:10:08,411 --> 01:10:10,538
Oh, I wouldn't tell him that,

1111
01:10:10,713 --> 01:10:15,275
unless you want your last baby
to go missing as well.

1112
01:10:16,852 --> 01:10:21,915
Oh, Rory. You're safe.
Oh, my sweetheart.

1113
01:10:22,091 --> 01:10:23,319
My darling.

1114
01:10:23,793 --> 01:10:25,556
Stay away from us!

1115
01:10:29,932 --> 01:10:32,901
Come on, come on. Stay with me.

1116
01:10:37,006 --> 01:10:38,268
You'd better have not killed my cubs,

1117
01:10:38,441 --> 01:10:38,964
Harry.

1118
01:10:39,141 --> 01:10:40,506
Come on, Dark.

1119
01:10:40,676 --> 01:10:43,144
I may have psychopathic tendencies

1120
01:10:43,312 --> 01:10:45,041
but I'm not an idiot.

1121
01:10:51,354 --> 01:10:54,346
...we should attack them and do it now.

1122
01:10:55,758 --> 01:10:56,622
Not yet.

1123
01:10:56,792 --> 01:11:00,319
Why not? They've got the best land,
the best everything.

1124
01:11:00,496 --> 01:11:02,225
We're living on scrub here.

1125
01:11:02,398 --> 01:11:03,865
Any day now, Harry.

1126
01:11:04,033 --> 01:11:06,797
The river's drying up.
Soon we'll be able to just walk across.

1127
01:11:06,969 --> 01:11:08,436
We should take them by surprise.

1128
01:11:08,604 --> 01:11:12,267
Kill them all.
Mother's and cubs included.

1129
01:11:12,808 --> 01:11:15,572
We'll do what needs to be done.

1130
01:11:16,312 --> 01:11:18,405
There, it's all right.

1131
01:11:18,581 --> 01:11:20,515
We don't belong here, Rory,

1132
01:11:21,651 --> 01:11:23,949
but we'll be all right
because we've got each other.

1133
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,054
We're like the stars, you and me;

1134
01:11:27,657 --> 01:11:29,852
so much the better for being together.

1135
01:11:35,731 --> 01:11:37,028
Come on.

1136
01:11:44,006 --> 01:11:47,271
Just stay close to me
and it'll be all right.

1137
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,639
Come on, be brave.

1138
01:11:53,883 --> 01:11:56,875
Just put one paw in front of the other.

1139
01:12:01,557 --> 01:12:05,459
I've done this before
and it's much easier than it looks,

1140
01:12:06,562 --> 01:12:08,052
I promise.

1141
01:12:13,302 --> 01:12:15,133
That's it, big step.

1142
01:12:18,808 --> 01:12:21,402
Oh, you just wait till we get
to the other side.

1143
01:12:23,312 --> 01:12:26,179
Ooh, spit it out, spit it out.

1144
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,277
Don't worry.

1145
01:12:29,919 --> 01:12:31,147
Well done.

1146
01:12:32,388 --> 01:12:35,357
Here we are, Rory, we're coming home.

1147
01:12:35,524 --> 01:12:36,821
Oh no you're not.

1148
01:12:38,761 --> 01:12:41,662
Hello Fleck. Still creeping up, I see.

1149
01:12:41,964 --> 01:12:43,090
Hello Linus.

1150
01:12:43,265 --> 01:12:44,289
Hello.

1151
01:12:44,467 --> 01:12:46,662
So, it didn't work out, then.

1152
01:12:46,836 --> 01:12:48,269
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1153
01:12:51,774 --> 01:12:52,832
We're not letting you back.

1154
01:12:53,008 --> 01:12:54,270
Why not?

1155
01:12:54,443 --> 01:12:55,933
We're hungry.

1156
01:12:56,245 --> 01:13:00,409
We only need good hunters now,
lions who help the Pride.

1157
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:02,210
Do you feel the same way, Linus?

1158
01:13:06,422 --> 01:13:07,081
Yes.

1159
01:13:07,256 --> 01:13:09,622
In that case all I can do is warn you

1160
01:13:09,792 --> 01:13:12,590
that the Wanderers are planning to
attack you soon,

1161
01:13:12,762 --> 01:13:14,059
so be prepared.

1162
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:15,595
Where will you go?

1163
01:13:15,765 --> 01:13:19,030
Oh, don't you worry about us.
We're as tough as they come.

1164
01:13:23,239 --> 01:13:24,900
Take care Suki.

1165
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:29,538
She's gone.

1166
01:13:29,712 --> 01:13:30,940
Do you think she heard?

1167
01:13:31,113 --> 01:13:32,137
I don't know.

1168
01:13:32,314 --> 01:13:34,646
It won't make any difference
in the long run.

1169
01:13:34,817 --> 01:13:38,583
This will be as easy as snapping
a mongoose's neck.

1170
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:45,888
Listen up, everybody.
They're going to have to cross the river.

1171
01:13:46,195 --> 01:13:48,186
But they could attack from the back.

1172
01:13:48,364 --> 01:13:51,060
If they come from the scrub,
Fleck will see them.

1173
01:13:51,233 --> 01:13:55,260
We mustn't be picked off individually
like last time.

1174
01:13:55,805 --> 01:13:58,137
You're covering that approach, Eddie.

1175
01:13:58,674 --> 01:14:00,301
Oh, you're in charge now are you?

1176
01:14:00,476 --> 01:14:01,602
Oh well, fair enough.

1177
01:14:01,777 --> 01:14:04,405
James will spot them if they approach
from the other direction.

1178
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:05,672
All right up there, James?

1179
01:14:05,848 --> 01:14:08,316
I feel a bit peckish, to be honest.

1180
01:14:08,784 --> 01:14:11,753
Stand up and walk around
if you feel yourself falling asleep.

1181
01:14:11,921 --> 01:14:14,515
Sleep? Don't know the meaning
of the word.

1182
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:17,750
It's hard enough to fight off
the Wanderers with food in our bellies,

1183
01:14:17,927 --> 01:14:21,954
but hungry...our strength
is ebbing away.

1184
01:14:22,231 --> 01:14:23,289
Let's eat Fleck

1185
01:14:26,001 --> 01:14:28,697
Very funny. See you chaps.

1186
01:14:29,038 --> 01:14:30,062
Hey, where are you going?

1187
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:31,399
Oh, I'm leaving the Pride.

1188
01:14:31,574 --> 01:14:32,063
Now?!

1189
01:14:32,241 --> 01:14:32,764
What?!

1190
01:14:32,942 --> 01:14:33,931
Yeah, you should come too.

1191
01:14:34,109 --> 01:14:34,734
No-

1192
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:37,743
Or are you too scared to see
what's out there in the world?

1193
01:14:37,913 --> 01:14:39,175
I didn't think I'd ever hear myself
say this,

1194
01:14:39,348 --> 01:14:41,475
Fleck, but we need you.

1195
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:44,380
You can't hide away here all your life,
you know.

1196
01:14:44,553 --> 01:14:46,646
I'll move on when the time is right.

1197
01:14:46,822 --> 01:14:48,119
You're a coward.

1198
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:50,315
Why leave the Pride now,
just when we need to fight?

1199
01:14:50,493 --> 01:14:52,290
I am not a coward.

1200
01:14:52,461 --> 01:14:56,261
We are staring extinction in the face
and all you can do is run.

1201
01:14:56,432 --> 01:14:57,626
Suki was right.

1202
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,734
You only ever think about yourself.

1203
01:14:59,902 --> 01:15:04,532
Ha. Linus, if I don't, who else will?

1204
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:22,654
Careful. It's a strange lion.

1205
01:15:23,893 --> 01:15:25,485
Stay close to me.

1206
01:15:27,563 --> 01:15:29,554
He could be dangerous.

1207
01:15:34,303 --> 01:15:35,270
Who are you?

1208
01:15:35,437 --> 01:15:38,770
Lush. Who are you?

1209
01:15:38,974 --> 01:15:40,271
Mew.

1210
01:15:40,442 --> 01:15:42,273
I think he means me.

1211
01:15:43,846 --> 01:15:46,713
I'm Suki. Weren't you in the pride?

1212
01:15:46,882 --> 01:15:50,443
That was a while ago.
I left to see a bit of the world.

1213
01:15:50,619 --> 01:15:53,315
What about you?
Why aren't you still with the pride?

1214
01:15:53,489 --> 01:15:56,947
Haven't you heard,
it's a jungle out here?

1215
01:15:57,126 --> 01:16:00,926
It's a long story.
The Wanderers are threatening us.

1216
01:16:01,096 --> 01:16:02,996
A lot's happened since you left.

1217
01:16:03,165 --> 01:16:03,756
Typical

1218
01:16:03,933 --> 01:16:06,925
I turn my back for two years
and I miss all the fun.

1219
01:16:07,102 --> 01:16:09,662
You look like the kind of lion
who makes his own fun.

1220
01:16:09,838 --> 01:16:11,703
You don't always want to make your own.

1221
01:16:39,935 --> 01:16:42,768
Yes, I know. You're hungry.

1222
01:16:44,139 --> 01:16:45,834
This was once the riverbed Rory.

1223
01:16:49,445 --> 01:16:50,935
An old friend of mine.

1224
01:16:53,282 --> 01:16:55,716
It's okay.
He won't bite.

1225
01:17:04,793 --> 01:17:06,818
I used to think I knew it all,

1226
01:17:07,329 --> 01:17:09,422
and that everything needed changing.

1227
01:17:09,898 --> 01:17:12,765
Now I know that the most important thing
is to contribute,

1228
01:17:12,935 --> 01:17:14,459
to be part of a team.

1229
01:17:14,637 --> 01:17:16,366
We're good at that, lions.

1230
01:17:18,273 --> 01:17:19,706
Don't move from here.

1231
01:17:20,676 --> 01:17:22,644
Time I did my bit to help.

1232
01:17:22,811 --> 01:17:25,939
At least being with the Wanderers
has taught me that.

1233
01:18:06,755 --> 01:18:10,555
There's no pleasure in killing.
It's just what we do.

1234
01:18:12,027 --> 01:18:14,188
That's what these are for.

1235
01:18:16,899 --> 01:18:18,594
Come on. It's not for us.

1236
01:18:19,134 --> 01:18:20,931
I've got a delivery to make.

1237
01:18:23,172 --> 01:18:32,945
Come on, all aboard. Are you on?

1238
01:18:33,115 --> 01:18:36,380
Hold on tight. Off we go.

1239
01:18:39,154 --> 01:18:41,349
God it's heavy.

1240
01:19:00,476 --> 01:19:02,341
This should give them strength.

1241
01:19:11,487 --> 01:19:13,682
Good morning. Anything happening,
James?

1242
01:19:13,856 --> 01:19:17,758
No, nothing, nothing.
All very quiet. Nothing happening.

1243
01:19:17,926 --> 01:19:19,553
So what's that then?

1244
01:19:19,795 --> 01:19:25,358
Oh that. Uh, yes, that is rather new,
isn't it?

1245
01:19:29,138 --> 01:19:31,333
Are you a breast lion or a leg lion?

1246
01:19:31,507 --> 01:19:34,135
Ha ha! Just a hungry lion.

1247
01:19:36,745 --> 01:19:38,303
Ooh, these ribs are so good!

1248
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:39,811
Aren't they, though.

1249
01:19:40,949 --> 01:19:43,042
I think I know who brought us this.

1250
01:19:43,252 --> 01:19:47,018
I hope so, Linus. I really hope so.

1251
01:19:53,061 --> 01:19:56,519
I'm sorry Rory, it's not just the river
that's drying up.

1252
01:20:01,637 --> 01:20:03,366
Something's happening.

1253
01:20:25,093 --> 01:20:28,358
Oh my word. It's them, isn't it?

1254
01:20:39,441 --> 01:20:40,465
Come on Linus.

1255
01:20:40,642 --> 01:20:43,668
Right this is it. Are you ready James?

1256
01:20:44,479 --> 01:20:46,106
What? Now you mean?

1257
01:20:51,053 --> 01:20:51,883
Come on Eddie.

1258
01:20:52,054 --> 01:20:53,214
We don't want to fight up here do we?

1259
01:20:53,388 --> 01:20:54,218
Someone's bound to fall off.

1260
01:20:54,389 --> 01:20:56,186
Remember the plan,

1261
01:20:56,491 --> 01:21:00,257
stay back until you are needed
and good luck everybody.

1262
01:21:00,429 --> 01:21:02,590
Good luck indeed.
I think we might need it.

1263
01:21:26,555 --> 01:21:29,581
Shall we get on - you're not getting
any younger.

1264
01:21:29,758 --> 01:21:31,658
You'll regret that.

1265
01:21:31,894 --> 01:21:35,125
I am so looking forward to this.

1266
01:21:40,469 --> 01:21:42,960
Fleck, you've come to help us.

1267
01:21:44,072 --> 01:21:47,633
Linus, I've joined the Wanderers.

1268
01:21:47,809 --> 01:21:50,937
I've had enough of being treated
like your family's hanger-on,

1269
01:21:51,113 --> 01:21:52,205
the poor relation.

1270
01:21:52,381 --> 01:21:54,042
They killed your mother, Fleck.

1271
01:21:54,216 --> 01:21:57,151
They are the future.
You've never got it, have you?

1272
01:21:57,319 --> 01:21:59,947
All of you lot here think life's about
"togetherness".

1273
01:22:00,122 --> 01:22:04,957
Well, it's not - it's about survival,
of the strongest, of the cruellest.

1274
01:22:07,029 --> 01:22:09,657
So, I haven't missed the party then.

1275
01:22:09,831 --> 01:22:10,729
Who are you?

1276
01:22:10,899 --> 01:22:13,800
Lush. Your sister said you could
use some help.

1277
01:22:17,406 --> 01:22:18,566
Suki!

1278
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:19,672
Mum!

1279
01:22:19,841 --> 01:22:22,639
What a touching reunion.

1280
01:22:22,878 --> 01:22:25,813
Suki. Get out of the way.

1281
01:22:25,981 --> 01:22:27,107
Don't do this, Dark.

1282
01:22:27,282 --> 01:22:30,683
Look what I've found,
some light refreshment.

1283
01:22:30,852 --> 01:22:33,844
No! My baby. Let him go.

1284
01:22:34,756 --> 01:22:40,092
No, no. You killer. Let him go.

1285
01:22:40,262 --> 01:22:46,531
Drop my cub, Harry.
So you did kill my cubs.

1286
01:22:46,868 --> 01:22:47,698
Fight me.

1287
01:22:47,869 --> 01:22:49,837
Leave him, Suki. He's mine.

1288
01:22:50,005 --> 01:22:54,533
Oh, very good, sonny. Come on then.

1289
01:23:00,949 --> 01:23:04,316
The edge. Watch the edge Linus.

1290
01:23:04,486 --> 01:23:07,319
I'm sorry, did you slip.

1291
01:23:08,623 --> 01:23:10,784
Let me hear you beg for mercy.

1292
01:23:10,959 --> 01:23:12,153
I'd rather die.

1293
01:23:12,327 --> 01:23:14,625
Leave my brother alone, Harry. Roar.

1294
01:23:16,131 --> 01:23:17,792
It's all right Suki, leave him to me.

1295
01:23:18,266 --> 01:23:19,528
You can do it Linus.

1296
01:23:23,405 --> 01:23:24,531
You've got him Linus.

1297
01:23:24,706 --> 01:23:26,105
Save me, Dark.

1298
01:23:26,508 --> 01:23:28,442
You murdered my cubs, Harry.

1299
01:23:29,644 --> 01:23:31,202
Save me!

1300
01:23:32,481 --> 01:23:34,608
Killer!

1301
01:23:42,858 --> 01:23:46,385
Enough. Back to the river. Come on Fleck.

1302
01:23:50,766 --> 01:23:55,726
Just me then. Who wants to fight me?

1303
01:23:56,271 --> 01:23:59,866
No, this is not the time to be
wasting more lives.

1304
01:24:00,375 --> 01:24:01,933
Even yours, Fleck.

1305
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:03,907
Don't you worry - I'll be back.

1306
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:07,845
With...a big team of highly
trained lions.

1307
01:24:08,016 --> 01:24:09,916
Oh, yeah, run along now.

1308
01:24:10,619 --> 01:24:12,553
Yeah, I will run along and then
I'll be running back.

1309
01:24:12,721 --> 01:24:13,653
You wait and see...

1310
01:24:13,822 --> 01:24:14,914
Well done Linus.

1311
01:24:15,290 --> 01:24:17,019
Didn't I say that someone would fall off.

1312
01:24:17,325 --> 01:24:20,317
Linus, have I said this before?

1313
01:24:20,762 --> 01:24:22,059
"I'm proud of you".

1314
01:24:22,230 --> 01:24:24,858
You've said it. But I don't think
you've meant it.

1315
01:24:25,033 --> 01:24:27,593
Well, I mean it now.

1316
01:24:31,706 --> 01:24:33,936
I don't know where to start, Mum -

1317
01:24:34,743 --> 01:24:38,804
Oh, oh Suki, Suki-

1318
01:24:39,014 --> 01:24:41,744
I'm sorry. It was my hormones, they were-

1319
01:24:41,917 --> 01:24:43,942
Sh, sh, sh enough

1320
01:24:44,619 --> 01:24:47,884
introduce me to my
first grandchild.

1321
01:24:56,331 --> 01:24:57,992
Thank you Lush.

1322
01:24:58,533 --> 01:25:00,558
I gather you know my sister Suki.

1323
01:25:00,735 --> 01:25:03,397
Yes. We've met.

1324
01:25:04,039 --> 01:25:06,132
I normally look better than this.

1325
01:25:06,308 --> 01:25:08,674
I find that hard to believe.

1326
01:25:14,049 --> 01:25:16,813
You're really quite the big brother,
aren't you Linus?

1327
01:25:18,286 --> 01:25:19,719
Oh, stop it!

1328
01:25:21,423 --> 01:25:22,685
I'm leaving Suki.

1329
01:25:22,858 --> 01:25:26,225
Leaving? That's so "last year".

1330
01:25:26,895 --> 01:25:29,762
We're safe now. You've got Lush.

1331
01:25:29,931 --> 01:25:32,263
I need to go out and enjoy the world.

1332
01:25:32,434 --> 01:25:33,366
You know what we said:

1333
01:25:33,535 --> 01:25:36,834
"We'll always stick together,
whatever the world throws at us."

1334
01:25:37,005 --> 01:25:43,376
Well, if you need me
just open your mouth and roar.

1335
01:26:29,658 --> 01:26:30,886
You know what?

1336
01:26:31,059 --> 01:26:33,050
Everything's back
to normal here.

1337
01:26:33,528 --> 01:26:35,723
It's all a bit too comfortable.

1338
01:26:36,765 --> 01:26:38,995
I think it's time to move on.

1339
01:26:39,534 --> 01:26:44,938
He he. I agree, time to seek new pastures,
new challenges.

1340
01:26:45,106 --> 01:26:46,664
Good one, good one.

1341
01:26:46,841 --> 01:26:49,537
Mm. The trouble is we're driven,
got too much energy.

1342
01:26:50,145 --> 01:26:53,273
Uh oh, here we go again. Look fierce.

1343
01:26:55,317 --> 01:26:57,080
Matter of fact I think it's
your turn to look fierce.

1344
01:26:57,252 --> 01:26:58,810
No it's your turn.

1345
01:26:58,987 --> 01:27:01,046
I did it last time,
if you remember correctly.

1346
01:27:01,223 --> 01:27:03,282
I'm absolutely certain it's your turn.

1347
01:27:03,992 --> 01:27:07,860
Ow, ow. Excuse me. Claws, claws.
Thank you.

1348
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:13,690
Cubs! Come on. Come over here.

1349
01:27:14,169 --> 01:27:16,637
Yes, you too Rory.

1350
01:27:16,871 --> 01:27:20,739
Suki! Are you coming? Let's go...

1351
01:27:20,909 --> 01:27:22,900
Okay. You're the boss...

1352
01:27:23,545 --> 01:27:26,207
although this is not entirely true!

1353
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,064
