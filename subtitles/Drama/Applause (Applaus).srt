00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,233
THE KID WITH A BIKE

2
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,799
Hang up, Cyril.

3
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,071
It's like last time.
The number's not in service.

4
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,869
Hang up.

5
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,397
Give it here.

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,755
You dialled it wrong!
Let me do it.

7
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,349
Ok, but put the loudspeaker on.

8
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,557
If you get that message again,
hang up. Ok?

9
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,630
Yes.

10
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,675
Go on.

11
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,952
<i>The number dialled is not in service.</i>

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,635
You heard?

13
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,595
Go and play.

14
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,113
I'll call the janitor.

15
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,157
We did that. You heard him.

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,788
Your dad's moved out.
You must accept it.

17
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,678
He'd have brought my bike.

18
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,478
Ask the janitor where he is.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,517
He doesn't know!
Give me the phone!

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,351
No!

21
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,511
Get off me!

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,556
Cyril!

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,030
Cyril!

24
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,828
Alain! Catch him!

25
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,873
Cyril, get down from there. Let go!

26
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,476
Let go! You'll hurt yourself.
Let go, Cyril!

27
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,629
Calm down!
Just calm down, ok.

28
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,595
Finished?

29
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,789
Come on.

30
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,839
Where are you off to?

31
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,671
The toilet.

32
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,795
Use the urinals.

33
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,995
It's a big job.

34
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,718
- You told the supervisor?
- Yes.

35
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,869
Go on then.

36
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,117
Is this the Val-Potet bus?

37
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,316
- No, number 2 there.
- Ok, thanks.

38
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,435
<i>Janitor.</i>

39
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,238
It's Cyril, to see my dad.

40
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:08,991
<i>Cyril?</i>

41
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,832
Cyril Catoul. 5th floor.

42
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,592
<i>Your dad left a month ago.</i>

43
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,875
His name's here.

44
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,790
<i>He's gone.</i>

45
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,996
- Can't I go up?
<i>- No one's there.</i>

46
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,479
But I'd like to...

47
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,352
<i>Medical practice.</i>

48
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,796
<i>Hello?</i>

49
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,598
I fell off my bike...

50
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,479
<i>Ground floor,</i>
<i>the blue door before the lift.</i>

51
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,395
Dad!

52
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,113
Dad, are you there?

53
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,871
What's going on?
No one lives there.

54
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,631
My dad does.

55
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,678
The place is empty.
Just ask the janitor.

56
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,831
Don't stay here. Go back down!

57
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,315
Go on!

58
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,838
Just go back down, ok.

59
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,869
Cyril!

60
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,916
Wait!

61
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,438
You fell off your bike?

62
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,511
- You got lost in the building?
- A bit.

63
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,954
It's simple enough.

64
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,793
- Where are you hurt?
- My leg.

65
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,757
- Is it bleeding?
- No.

66
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,638
- Did you bang your head?
- No.

67
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,915
Give me your name.

68
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,674
We're his counsellors.
He ran away from school...

69
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,717
Be reasonable. Come with us.

70
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,718
Did you hear me? Come on!

71
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,791
Let go of the lady!
Come with us!

72
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,791
Not so tight, that hurts.

73
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,559
Leave the lady now.

74
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,596
I'm staying at Dad's!

75
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,829
He's moved out.

76
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,274
My bike's here too!

77
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,476
You can hold me but not so tight.

78
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,551
- Come on, Cyril.
- No!

79
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,076
I can let him see the apartment.

80
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,559
You heard the janitor?

81
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,835
We'll go and see
your dad's place, ok?

82
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,949
Sorry about that.

83
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,399
Coming now, Cyril?

84
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,790
Cyril...

85
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,548
The director wants to see you.

86
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,557
Get up. I knowyou're there.

87
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,189
The others are already at breakfast.

88
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,193
Going to get up?

89
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,396
- What time is it?
- Ten to nine.

90
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,120
It's Saturday.
I have ten more minutes.

91
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,237
The director wants to see you.
You have to go.

92
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,758
You're not getting up?

93
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,949
I'll tell him
you won't see him then.

94
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,037
Remember the lady you held
at the medical practice?

95
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,598
She's here to talk to you.

96
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,110
Do you hear what I'm saying?

97
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,519
I've got your bike.

98
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,077
- You sawmy dad?
- No.

99
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,434
How did you find it?

100
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,476
Get dressed.

101
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,675
How did you find it?

102
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,037
You told the janitor
it was black with a chrome fork.

103
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,077
So I looked for one like that.

104
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,469
Where was it?

105
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,474
I saw a boy riding it on the estate,
so I bought it off his dad.

106
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,309
Bought it?

107
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,869
He said your dad sold it to him.

108
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,237
He's a liar.
He stole it and sold it back to you.

109
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,159
Or it's not mine.

110
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,435
It's scratched there. It's mine.
He stole it from my dad.

111
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,990
- Howmuch did you pay?
- Never mind.

112
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,594
Maybe your dad needed money
for bills.

113
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,239
He'd never have sold it.

114
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,591
- Thank the lady.
- Thank you.

115
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,395
Watch this!

116
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,635
Bravo!

117
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,275
Watch.

118
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,672
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Thank you.

119
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,872
Coming for breakfast now?

120
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,799
Cyril, watch out!

121
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,829
Cyril, come back!

122
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,276
Can I stay with you at weekends?

123
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,236
I'll need to ask the director.

124
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,358
He'll agree,
he needs foster families. Ask him.

125
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,035
No, I'm already late for work.
I'll call him. Goodbye.

126
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,872
You say that but you won't.

127
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,479
I will.

128
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,275
Goodbye.

129
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,953
I don't knowhim.

130
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,156
But he told me he came here.

131
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,431
Maybe he said where he was going.

132
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,672
I don't remember him
so even less what he said.

133
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,035
Let me by.

134
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,395
He had a golden helmet. That's rare.

135
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,755
I don't remember. Cut it out.

136
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,390
Yes.

137
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,599
I'm riding my bike

138
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,398
around the neighbourhood.

139
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,631
A boy tried to steal it.

140
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,836
Maybe the one you bought it from.

141
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,592
What colour was his hair?

142
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,798
Tell me anyway.

143
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,748
It wasn't him.

144
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,350
I'll ride a bit more, then come back.

145
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,789
You were with him?

146
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,439
Yes, one Sunday morning.

147
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,194
I remember him
but didn't knowhe'd moved.

148
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,554
I can't help you.

149
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,429
Ok, goodbye.

150
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,033
- You're his son?
- Yes.

151
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,590
- He didn't say where he was going?
- He did but I forgot.

152
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,871
He filled his motorbike here.
He had a golden helmet.

153
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,277
Was it an old BMW 750?

154
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,668
Yes, green and chrome.

155
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,956
He put up an ad for his motorbike.

156
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,917
In the shop windowthere.

157
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,069
When was that?

158
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,748
About a month ago.

159
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,475
Where he was moving to?

160
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,119
Why would he tell me?

161
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,840
Maybe there's an address
on the ad.

162
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,833

00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,798
Cyril, say goodbye.

170
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,878
I hate water being wasted.

171
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,393
What's wrong?

172
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,953
Is it that boy
who tried to steal your bike?

173
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,754
Someone spoke to you about your dad?

174
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,790
You're off to a great start here!

175
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,353
Tell me what's wrong.
I can't guess, Cyril.

176
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,511
You heard the psychologist.

177
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,790
Coming to your dad's neighbourhood,
you'd think about him too much.

178
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,908
Maybe I should just have you
on Sundays.

179
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,629
We could go to the country
or the sea,

180
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,552
then I'd drive you back.

181
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,788
What do you think?

182
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,712
Cyril, look at me.

183
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,109
I'd like to see the man
you got my bike from.

184
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,436
Why? To tell him he's a thief?

185
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,273
No. My dad sold it.

186
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,476
I saw an ad at the petrol station.

187
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,358
What'll you say to him?

188
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,231
I'll ask him about my dad.

189
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,913
I still have his number.
Shall we call him?

190
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,475
Yes.

191
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,154
Turn the tap off.

192
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,791
Don't use up your credit.

193
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,999
Mr Gurza.

194
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,674
04336...

195
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,155
Hi.

196
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,757
Cyril... Gilles, my friend.

197
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,989
Hello.

198
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,239
What's the number?

199
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,836
043366310.

200
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,472
Hello... Mr Gurza?

201
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,359
I'm calling about my bike.
This is Cyril Catoul.

202
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,034
When my dad sold it to you,

203
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,156
did he say where he was moving?

204
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,675
Yes, Guy Catoul's my dad.
Did he say where he was moving?

205
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,598
He really didn't say?

206
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,755
Goodbye.

207
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,911
- Why aren't you coming?
- I'm scared.

208
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,274
With me, you won't be.

209
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,589
I'll watch you both.

210
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,954
Here, Cyril.

211
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,394
Go on.

212
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,917
I'm going alone!

213
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,753
No, it's dangerous.
I have to be with you.

214
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,872
- Stay here!
- I'm going alone!

215
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,429
- What if there's a problem?
- I don't need you!

216
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,670
Samantha!

217
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,317
Stay here! Calm down.

218
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,754
He wants to go alone!

219
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,275
No, not on your own!
Sit down, Cyril!

220
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,788
Sit down!

221
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,715
Can I sit down?

222
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,709
What is it?

223
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,318
I want my dad.

224
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,189
It's warm.

225
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,550
What is?

226
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,879
Your breath.

227
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,959
Let me.

228
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,159
Turn the handlebars.

229
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,318
Give me your bag, Cyril.

230
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,915
Goodbye.

231
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,392
See you on Monday.

232
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,389
- Who gave you his address?
- The police.

233
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,039
What did the director say?

234
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,475
He hopes it'll go well.

235
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,756
But he couldn't get the address.

236
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,955
He could have

237
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,317
but he wanted to let your dad
take the first step.

238
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,469
So did the psychologist.

239
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,110
But my dad told you
he wanted to see me.

240
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,635
Not that he wanted to,
that he agreed to.

241
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,119
- Same difference.
- No.

242
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,999
If he'd wanted to,
he could have called.

243
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,513
No one's stopping him.

244
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,710
Don't be upset if it's not the way
you dream it'll be.

245
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,233
I'm not dreaming.

246
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,794
Another sandwich?

247
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,955
No.

248
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,109
Some water?

249
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,997
Please.

250
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,670
Thank you.

251
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,558
- What?
- Thank you.

252
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,669
I couldn't see him.

253
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,356
He'll probably come that way.

254
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,359
He's not coming.

255
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,237
You should have given him
your number just in case.

256
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,713
Let's go to his place.

257
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,949
What if he's on his way?

258
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,917
He's 40 minutes late.

259
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,513
Let's go to his place.

260
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,671
I'll just check that street.

261
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,238
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

262
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,436
Could we talk to Guy Catoul?

263
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,477
He's not here. Who are you?

264
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,755
He's my dad.

265
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,275
He was supposed
to meet his son at 10.

266
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,671
He wasn't there so we came here.
Where can we find him?

267
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,035
Who are you?

268
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,191
Cyril stays with me at weekends.

269
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,713
You know Guy?

270
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,873
No, I sawhim once
to fix the appointment.

271
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,190
He's prepping my restaurant kitchen.

272
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,952
The 'Acacia', by the bridge.

273
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,111
- This side of the river?
- The other.

274
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,157
Thank you. Goodbye.

275
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,549
It's too loud. He can't hear us.

276
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,076
There he is!

277
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,430
Dad!

278
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,029
Dad!

279
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,119
He's gone in the back.

280
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,396
There's a door in the alley. Come on.

281
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,635
I'll climb up.

282
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,835
I can see him!

283
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,318
He's bringing the bins out.

284
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,234
Dad!

285
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,913
Dad! I'm here!

286
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,636
- What's up?
- I've come to see you!

287
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,878
Do I jump
or can you open the door?

288
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,315
Go round the front.

289
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,989
Round the front.

290
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,035
I'll wait here.

291
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,510
Come on in.

292
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,228
Want a drink?

293
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,072
- Want a drink?
- Yes.

294
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,992
- What?
- I dunno.

295
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,680
Coke, peach juice,
pear juice, water...

296
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,670
Peach.

297
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,798
- What?
- Peach.

298
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,995
Peach.

299
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,835
Is the woman nice?

300
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,115
She's ok.

301
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,431
It's good she can have you weekends.

302
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,431
- Going to be a hairdresser?
- No.

303
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,234
I have work to do in the kitchen.
Come on.

304
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,794
She bought my bike back.

305
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,157
That's great. I had to sell it.
I was in the shit.

306
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,548
That's ok.

307
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,277
When are you coming for me?

308
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,436
- Where?
- At the home.

309
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,834
They're not nice?

310
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,116
You said it was only for a month.

311
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,519
It's not easy for me.

312
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,919
I wanted to call
but why bother if I couldn't come?

313
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,519
That's ok.

314
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,032
You changed your number?

315
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,553
I sold my mobile.

316
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,189
I can't have you back with me, see.

317
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,678
Not yet anyway.

318
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,475
I need to put some money by.

319
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,595
I need a flat and all that.

320
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,315
When will that be?

321
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,029
I don't know.

322
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,349
Samantha got me a mobile.

323
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,191
You could call me at weekends.

324
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,879
Want to note the number?

325
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,955
Just a second.

326
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,476
Go on.

327
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,312
0479...

328
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,309
69...

329
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,638
56...

330
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,949
23.

331
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,314
What's the number here?

332
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,517
There isn't one.
Well, you mustn't call.

333
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,438
My boss doesn't want that.

334
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,194
I'll call you.

335
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,955
What's that?

336
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,149
Sauces.

337
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,397
Choron and Caribbean.

338
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,549
Time to go. I have work to do.

339
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,318
Can I stir it?

340
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,271
Go on. Careful, it's hot.

341
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,753
Off you go.
I have stuff to do before we open.

342
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,239
Give me the spoons.

343
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,994
When do you open?

344
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,711
At midday. In half an hour.

345
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,037
I'll come with Samantha.

346
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,633
You can't, we're full.

347
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,118
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

348
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,272
What do you want? Sausage?
Crisps? With paprika or salt?

349
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,509
Paprika.

350
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,515
Let's go.

351
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,112
- Want one?
- No.

352
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,314
When'll I see you?

353
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,754
I'll call you.

354
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,239
Next Saturday?

355
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,711
I'll try. I'll call you, ok.

356
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,519
If you can't reach me,
I'll come back here.

357
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,035
Hold on...

358
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,156
Can I have a quick word?

359
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,559
No, wait here.

360
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,836
I didn't come because I can't.

361
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,389
It's too much.
I can't look after him.

362
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,755
Nowhis gran's gone, I'm all alone.

363
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,831
I can't. It's too much for me.

364
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,990
I could bring him an hour
at weekends.

365
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,355
No, seeing him stresses me out.

366
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,398
He likes you. Look after him.

367
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,754
He wants you, not me.

368
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,319
He'll forget me.

369
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,799
I'm starting over.

370
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,190
With him around, it won't work.

371
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,470
I just can't look after him.

372
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,836
Even once a month would be good.

373
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,991
No, please, take care of him.

374
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,592
I don't want to see him again.
Tell him I can't.

375
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,317
You should tell him yourself.

376
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,993
I've tried but I can't.

377
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,673
What did your dad say?

378
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,791
That he'd call, maybe Saturday.

379
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,916
I gave him my mobile number.

380
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,155
Come with me.

381
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,555
- Why?
- Come on!

382
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,389
He heard us.

383
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,193
- What is it?
- You have to tell him, not me.

384
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,749
Tell him.

385
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,157
Don't try to see me again.

386
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,320
Stay at the home or with her.
You'll be ok.

387
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,638
You won't be calling me?

388
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,315
I don't know.

389
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,469
No.

390
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,152
No! Cyril!

391
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,915
Stop that!

392
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,235
It's all right...

393
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,398
We're one short. Want to play?

394
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,437
After I take the shopping back.

395
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,597
I'm going to play five-a-side.

396
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,434
There's...

397
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,078
4 euros 60 left.

398
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,878
Put it on the counter.

399
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,916
Thanks.

400
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,195
Howmuch was it?

401
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,110
I dunno.

402
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,271
Work it out. I gave you 10 euros.

403
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,195
- 5 euros... 40.
- Yes.

404
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,151
- Give it back!
- Come and get it.

405
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,350
Attack, Pitbull! Go on, attack!

406
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,075
Go on, attack!

407
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,195
Make him cry! Go on, Pitbull!

408
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,551
Go on, bite him!

409
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,551
- That's good!
- Go on, bite him!

410
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,319
Go on!

411
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,356
Ok, Pitbull, you win!

412
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,348
Enough, I said!

413
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,670
Enough!

414
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,788
Come back down. Come down!

415
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,995
Wait!

416
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,399
Give me your hand.

417
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,071
You're wicked, Pitbull. Respect.

418
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,754
Shake his hand.

419
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,909
Respect.

420
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,635
Respect.

421
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,149
I'm going with him.

422
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,310
Logan!

423
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,471
Wash my car. Nabil has the key.

424
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,594
Going to the estate?

425
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,239
- Yes.
- Me too.

426
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,234
It's flat.

427
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,434
It's full of nails and glass here.

428
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,754
I'll get the garage apprentice
to mend it.

429
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,716
I have no cash.

430
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,108
It's ok, I have some.

431
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,035
- It's a nail...
- Yeah.

432
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,794
Leave it in
so he knows where the hole is.

433
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,037
I'll carry it to the road.
Don't puncture the other.

434
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,789
Where do you live?

435
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,713
At Samantha the hairdresser's
near the square.

436
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,836
You're related to her?

437
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,951
No, I just stay at weekends.

438
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,279
Is she nice to you?

439
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,316
Yes.

440
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,597
- Smoke?
- No.

441
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,712
You're at the home in Theux?

442
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,996
- You knowit?
- I spent 3 years there.

443
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,633
We're made to get along.

444
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,593
Let me see your eye.

445
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,509
Hold my cigarette.

446
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,193
There's a speck of dirt.

447
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,234
Don't touch!

448
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,797
- Like PlayStation games?
- Yes.

449
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,756
Got one?

450
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,150
No, I use an old PS1 at the home.

451
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,354
I have a PS3
and the new <i>Assassin's Creed.</i>

452
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,239
Want to play?

453
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,595
All right.

454
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,708
What happened?

455
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,909
The TV remote fell
and I tried to pick it up.

456
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,597
Pitbull, pick up the remote.

457
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,468
Where's Grandpa?

458
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,153
At the chemist's.

459
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,630
I bet he stopped at the bar.

460
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,948
What channel?

461
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,114
Four.

462
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,230
Will you be ok?

463
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,594
Thank you.

464
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,269
Come on, Pitbull.

465
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,670
Pitbull.

466
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,995
Sit down.

467
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,039
Sit down here, Pitbull.

468
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,589
- You like me calling you Pitbull?
- Yes.

469
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,988
I'm Wes... Wesker,
like in <i>Resident Evil.</i>

470
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,469
- With the glasses!
- I always wore them before.

471
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,595
Hold on.

472
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,958
Don't say you're with me!

473
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,475
Yes.

474
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,474
No, I...

475
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,309
I didn't go and play with them.

476
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,513
I met other boys.
We're riding our bikes.

477
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,595
No.

478
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,476
Yes.

479
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,189
Yes.

480
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,749
See you later.

481
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,278
- The hairdresser?
- Yes.

482
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,998
Mention me
and she'd have said, 'The dealer?'

483
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,196
Everyone around here thinks I deal.

484
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,953
The fuckers!

485
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,029
Seen me deal dope?
Did I offer you any?

486
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,155
No.

487
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:48,876
Here.

488
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,678
- It's cordless?
- Yes.

489
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,594
Want a drink?

490
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,876
Coke, Fanta, beer?

491
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,029
Fanta.

492
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,071
Dagger or sword?

493
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,309
Sword.

494
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,791
Press R2 and pick sword.

495
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,753
- Her again?
- Yes.

496
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,592
Don't answer. Ignore her.

497
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,115
Turn it off.

498
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,309
There...

499
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,073
Go on, play.

500
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,668
Faster or I'll slaughter you.

501
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,391
Dodge him!

502
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,197
You have to waste that shit.

503
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,315
Here, Pitbull.

504
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,029
Wait!

505
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,470
No other guy in the gang
has ever been here. Just you.

506
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,519
To our meeting.

507
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,274
Go on, play.

508
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,078
Watch out there.

509
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,556
There. Nice move.

510
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,469
Go on.

511
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,113
Bad headbutt.

512
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,229
Here.

513
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,435
Thanks.

514
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,959
- Thanks.
- See you.

515
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,191
I'll ask Samantha for 10 euros.

516
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,477
I don't need her money.
I'm glad to help you out.

517
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,152
I'm hungry, aren't you?

518
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,639
Kind of.

519
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,469
Good evening.

520
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,037
What is it?

521
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,998
I told you,
a job we could do together.

522
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,229
What kind of job?

523
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,072
I need to be able to trust you.

524
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,229
You can.

525
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,432
- Sure?
- Yes.

526
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,080
I'm not sure, Pitbull.
You seem a bit sly.

527
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,868
Hey, Pitbull...

528
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,151
You seem a bit sly, right?

529
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,038
I'm kidding! I trust you. Totally.

530
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,870
Here.

531
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,152
Want to move to my place?

532
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,515
I'm at Samantha's.

533
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,238
Change foster home.

534
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,676
There's a free room.
My grandparents would agree.

535
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,717
- Want me to ask them?
- Ok.

536
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,109
It's Samantha!

537
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,276
I'll handle it.
See you Saturday.

538
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,394
I've been looking all over for you!

539
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,994
He had a flat.
I took him to the garage.

540
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,434
Shut up!
Your bike.

541
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,556
- I'll ride back.
- You're coming with me!

542
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:07,837
See you.

543
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,910
See you.

544
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,112
Keep away from that dealer!

545
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,349
He helped me.

546
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,669
Why didn't you call?

547
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,956
Why didn't you answer your phone?

548
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,912
Why didn't you answer?

549
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,630
Tell us.

550
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,399
I didn't hear the phone.

551
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,391
- Liar!
- Liar yourself!

552
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,879
Apologize!

553
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,716
Apologize for that!

554
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,673
Apologize, Cyril.

555
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,639
Apologize or you won't come back.

556
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,074
Don't say that.

557
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,753
No one can say a thing.

558
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,758
He's running rings around you.

559
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,115
Last week, he had a fit of nerves,

560
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,113
today we look for him for hours
and he insults me?

561
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,839
Apologize or don't come back.

562
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,797
You've no right to say that!

563
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,152
It's him or me.

564
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,591
You hear? It's him or me.

565
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,469
Him.

566
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,596
Gilles!

567
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,354
See, it's off.
It was while I was pedalling...

568
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,399
Never mind. You could have called
when you got a puncture.

569
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,149
Get the water.

570
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,629
I don't knowwhy you didn't call.

571
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,914
Why didn't you think
I could help you?

572
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,469
Or that I'd be worried about you?

573
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,396
I forgot the forks.

574
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,152
Answer me!

575
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,237
I don't know. I didn't think.

576
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,795
Wait for me.

577
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,150
Enjoy.

578
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,830
Why did you want me to come here?

579
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,198
You're the one who asked.

580
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,159
But why did you agree?

581
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,595
I don't know.

582
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,752
Promise me one thing, Cyril.

583
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,912
Keep away from that guy.

584
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,230
Don't let him come near you again.

585
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,556
You promise?

586
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,915
Yes.

587
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,398
He lowers the shutter...

588
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,393
He locks it...

589
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,953
Turned your phone off?

590
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,469
I'm doing it now.

591
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,274
I'll leave it at Samantha's tonight.

592
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,835
There.

593
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,918
He comes over to the corner...

594
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,115
He passes you...

595
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,840
He's carrying all the unsold papers.

596
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,033
He puts them down...

597
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,719
He opens the car boot...

598
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,277
He bends to pick them up...

599
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,195
No!

600
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,277
The bag on his wrist first.

601
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,350
Right...

602
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,835
Empty it out.

603
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,190
No!

604
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:32,910
Right...

605
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:35,876
Ok.

606
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,068
Look at me.

607
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,835
If you forget the bag
and his pockets?

608
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,195
- I won't forget.
- What does that mean?

609
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,157
I knowwhere the money is.

610
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,753
And that means?

611
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,151
They'll suspect you because
you worked at the newsagent's.

612
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,834
That means you'd be betraying me
to the cops!

613
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,036
- Want to put me in jail?
- No.

614
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,991
- What comes first?
- The bag.

615
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,991
- Second?
- His jacket pockets.

616
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,832
And third, his belt thing.

617
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,109
Come on...

618
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,999
Practise with this.

619
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,349
It won't kill him?

620
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,431
No, but hold it at the bottom.

621
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,916
Grip it tight. That's good.

622
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,195
Pitbull!

623
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,115
Tie this on me.

624
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,916
Howmuch do you want? 500 euros?

625
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:44,990
No, nothing.

626
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,195
So why do it?

627
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,475
For you.

628
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,549
Stop that, Cyril!

629
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,349
What are you doing?

630
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,636
- You stay in if I say so!
- Why?

631
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,189
I don't want you out alone at night!

632
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,913
Go to the movies with Mourad.

633
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,559
I'll only ride my bike.

634
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,153
Who with? The dealer!

635
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,309
He hasn't got a bike.

636
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,552
He's always around,
trying to hire other kids.

637
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,914
He knows you're new!

638
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,069
I'm going out!

639
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,195
Stop it!

640
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,913
That's Mourad.

641
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,669
Come on.

642
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,993
Go to the movies
with him and his parents.

643
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,078
Mourad wants to be your friend.
His mum told me.

644
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:46,597
Come on...

645
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,715
No.

646
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,438
- Hello.
- I've come for Cyril.

647
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,555
Come in.

648
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,919
He doesn't want to go.

649
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,629
Come and ask him.

650
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,239
Why won't you come?

651
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,596
- Come on...
- No.

652
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,159
It's in 3D, it'll be fun.

653
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,355
I don't want to.

654
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,396
Go on, Cyril.

655
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,709
No!

656
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,516
Come on.

657
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,272
Ok... Bye.

658
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,429
Bye.

659
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,518
Coming to the match tomorrow?

660
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,669
Yes. What time?

661
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,432
- Two o'clock.
- See you then.

662
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,034
Apologize to your parents.

663
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,435
Cyril!

664
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,719
Cyril, get down!

665
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,677
Get down!

666
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,072
Calm down, ok!

667
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,391
You're not my dad or my mum!
I want to go back to the home!

668
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,471
If you want to go back, fine!

669
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,358
Call them and I'll take you.

670
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,152
I'm not staying with you!

671
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,232
Open up!

672
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,628
Cyril, come back!

673
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,199
Hello, this is Samantha,
Cyril's foster family.

674
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,676
Can I speak to a counsellor?

675
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,190
Yes.

676
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,755
All right.

677
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,118
Dad, I can't lock the shutter.

678
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,629
What's going on?

679
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,909
Did he see you?

680
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,877
- I think so.
- You think so?

681
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,594
I had to turn to him to hit him.

682
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,476
Take this!

683
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,789
Why?

684
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,593
Take it!

685
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,836
It was your idea. You did it alone.

686
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,629
If you say I was involved,
I'll kill you! Got that?

687
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,670
Now get out!

688
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,193
- But...
- Get out!

689
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,832
Did you forget what I said?

690
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,558
I have something for you.

691
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:01,836
Where's it from?

692
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,718
I stole it but no one knows.

693
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:07,238
One meatballs with extra chips! Guy!

694
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:08,355
Coming up.

695
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,314
I won't tell the cops
I gave it to you.

696
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,510
Clear off!

697
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,635
I won't tell.

698
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,755
Clear off!

699
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,229
You'll put me in jail!

700
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,516
- I won't tell...
- Shut up! Climb!

701
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:56,675
Jump!

702
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,590
Are you ok?

703
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,115
Yes.

704
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,799
Don't ever come back here!

705
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,468
The police are after you
for the newsagent.

706
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,752
We have to go. Put your bike away.
I'll get my keys.

707
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,188
Samantha...

708
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,750
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.

709
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,511
I'd like to live with you.

710
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:54,869
All the time.

711
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,109
All right.

712
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:01,949
Give me a kiss.

713
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,837
As the money has been found,

714
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,959
the damages requested
by Mr Surlet and his son Martin

715
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,953
amount to their hospital fees

716
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,829
and the loss of earnings
caused by six days closure,

717
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,390
namely a total of 1,750 euros.

718
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,517
As the accomplice, Steve Deschamps,

719
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,114
is insolvent and currently in prison,

720
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,872
Ms. Samantha Puccio,

721
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,508
guardian of the attacker,
Cyril Catoul,

722
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,113
will pay the victims

723
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:02,078
the full sum
in 20 monthly instalments.

724
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,158
Do you have anything to add?

725
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:06,837
No.

726
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:07,716
And you?

727
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:08,915
No.

728
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:13,034
Will you make a full apology
to Mr Surlet now?

729
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:14,150
Yes.

730
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,676
Will you accept his apology?

731
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,109
Yes.

732
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:19,475
Go on then.

733
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,637
I apologize to you
for the money I stole

734
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,276
and for hitting you on the head,
you and your son.

735
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,157
I accept your apology.

736
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,719
You can stand
and shake Mr Surlet's hand.

737
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,836
Then we'll sign the agreement.

738
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,557
Why didn't your son come?

739
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,636
He won't accept your apology.

740
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,156
Change gear! A higher one!

741
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,831
- What gear are you on?
- No idea.

742
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,915
- What numbers on the handle?
- Eight.

743
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,354
That's twice mine.

744
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,678
- Can I try it?
- Sure.

745
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,637
I hadn't ridden a bike in ages.

746
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,478
- Time for a sandwich?
- Yes.

747
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,154
- Tuna?
- Yes.

748
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,755
I'll have cheese.

749
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:03,834
What'll we do this evening?

750
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,035
I don't know.

751
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,474
Let's invite Mourad and his parents
for a barbecue.

752
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,595
Where?

753
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,909
In the back yard.

754
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,030
I have the full kit in the cellar.

755
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,151
- Shall I invite Mourad?
- Ok.

756
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,876
Hello, it's Samantha.

757
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:39,232
Cyril and I would like you
to come to a barbecue.

758
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,516
Mourad, you and Jeannot.

759
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,477
Yes, bring them along.

760
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,075
All right.

761
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,594
At 6 o'clock.

762
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,429
Yes.

763
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,559
His two cousins are here.

764
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,517
- My age?
- More or less.

765
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,472
- How about you?
- What?

766
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,278
You're not inviting a friend?

767
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,033
Mind your own business!

768
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:28,955
Excuse me...

769
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,190
There's no charcoal?

770
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,952
Not until tomorrow.

771
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,559
They're out of charcoal. I can get
some from the petrol station.

772
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,233
I'll give you some money.

773
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,199
I hope they have some.

774
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,440
It's 5 or 6 euros.
I'll see you at home.

775
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,555
Yes.

776
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,553
There you go. Goodbye.

777
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,392
Hello. A bag of charcoal.

778
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,551
5 euros 80, please.

779
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,672
- Here.
- Thank you.

780
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,756
- There you are.
- Goodbye.

781
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:39,995
Hello.

782
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,312
Leave him. Get back in.

783
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:54,995
Martin!

784
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,995
What'll you do nowwithout that bat?
Go on, hit me!

785
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:04,956
I apologized...

786
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,792
Screwyour apologies!

787
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,837
Go on! Try to hit me!

788
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,149
I don't want to.

789
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,356
Just do it!

790
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:35,873
Come down, asshole!

791
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,639
Dad!

792
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,114
He climbed up
and I threw stones at him.

793
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,197
- Sure he's not moving?
- Yes.

794
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,952
What did you do that for?

795
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:54,351
- Where is he?
- Near a trailer...

796
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:04,835
Hold on...

797
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:06,675
Hold on.

798
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,153
If he's dead,

799
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,073
we'll say he insulted us
and you ran after him.

800
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:14,913
He climbed a tree to get away
and fell.

801
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,273
Did the stones hit him?

802
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,193
His hand's cut
but it doesn't have to be a stone.

803
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,839
It could be a branch.

804
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:23,950
Yes.

805
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,799
Get my mobile from the car
to call an ambulance.

806
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,597
You have concussion.
I should call an ambulance.

807
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,469
No.

808
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:33,118
