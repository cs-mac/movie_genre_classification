1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,560
This film is fictional,
not based on a true story or true events

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,620
For the most intimate scenes,
a double was used.

3
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,740
ANATOMY OF HELL

4
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,580
Why did you do that?

5
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,500
Because I'm a woman.

6
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,820
I don't understand.

7
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,820
You understand very well.

8
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,220
Thanks.

9
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,540
Why did you go back
down to the toilets?

10
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,380
People like you don't look at women.

11
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,020
When you touched me,
on the stairs...

12
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,740
You touched me, right?

13
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,860
So what?

14
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,100
It was touching...

15
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,860
At first I paid no attention to it,

16
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,820
then I got scared:
I was sure of what you did.

17
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,020
I was sure of what you did, too.

18
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,420
I know why you went to the can!

19
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,180
To get sucked, like all men.

20
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,140
Dumb bitch!

21
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,220
That's what you all do.

22
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,700
You're all alike.

23
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,140
What do you want to do now?

24
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,940
I'll pay you.

25
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,460
To what end?

26
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,540
To find out.

27
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,020
You don't like women,
you can look at me...

28
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,420
I mean, impartially.

29
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,180
What's this about?

30
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,660
Just that.

31
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,900
Watch me where I'm unwatchable.

32
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,140
No need to touch me.

33
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,300
Just say what you see.

34
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,940
It'll cost you a lot.

35
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,940
I'll pay you.

36
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,180
<i>That's how the deal was made. </i>

37
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,900
<i>First night... </i>

38
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,980
Excuse me.

39
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,340
You're early:
I didn't have time to undress.

40
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,820
I'm paid to watch.

41
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,220
That's all you can ask me to do.

42
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,300
You're right.

43
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,780
But I can still hope for more...

44
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,220
You didn't say
it was an isolated house.

45
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,180
I had to take a train, then a cab.

46
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,420
That will cost you extra.

47
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,980
I'll pay for everything.

48
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,740
<i>He'd been tricked into this meeting. </i>

49
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,380
<i>It sickens him to be here:</i>

50
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,500
<i>He hoped for something new,
unexpected,</i>

51
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,180
<i>though he knows it won't be. </i>

52
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,580
At last. It's about time!

53
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,900
Why do you exhibit yourself
this way?

54
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,220
The fragility of female flesh

55
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,580
inspires disgust or brutality.

56
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,300
Women depend on one or the other.

57
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,780
What should we fear more?

58
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,340
Nothingness...

59
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,140
or brutality?

60
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,980
It takes ages
between the offer and the demand.

61
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,140
Between the offer
and when it's taken up.

62
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,940
That's what we call
the first deception.

63
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,620
Thereafter, nothing flows,

64
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,300
it's all fake...

65
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,300
Artificial catching up,

66
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,020
the clumsiness of hasty brutality...

67
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,420
You talk too much.

68
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,580
Your words are inept reproaches.

69
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,740
Should I have shaved my armpits?

70
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,620
It would still show...

71
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,020
However much women shave.

72
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,460
Even if you removed
the hair from your crack,

73
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,780
you wouldn't be rid
of your obscene nature,

74
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,580
on the contrary.

75
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,620
The skin stays lumpy

76
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,780
like the neck of a plucked chicken.

77
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,660
Every pore exudes
the irritation of pulled hairs

78
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,420
like microscopic sexual swellings.

79
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,780
So we can't do a thing about it?

80
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,300
No, you can't.

81
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,220
It's the depth of this obscenity,

82
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,460
its feminine depth,

83
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,820
that men who don't like women
envy in you,

84
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,780
and that those who like you,
hate you for.

85
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,700
It's not what we see,

86
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,940
though when you spread your legs,
we're revolted,

87
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,940
by the overly bright color,

88
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,620
the sloppy, shapeless aspect
of your hidden lips...

89
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,060
the thinness of their skin,

90
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,700
though...

91
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,060
here and there, it's lumpy,

92
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,780
a skin that sweats, that oozes,

93
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,540
a pestilential skin,

94
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,420
like the skin of frogs.

95
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,180
Frogs, at least,
have the decency of being green,

96
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,340
but their thighs,

97
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,700
symbolically,
can be spread as wide as yours.

98
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,340
It's not what we see:

99
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,060
Your denial of the obscenity
is what frightens us most.

100
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,380
Keep going...

101
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,900
<i>So I wonder if what first
turned me off women</i>

102
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,780
<i>wasn't the deep violence they provoke
from their slumbering depths. </i>

103
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,220
<i>So far, I'd been honest. </i>

104
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,020
<i>But you must have an inkling
of what I inevitably recall,</i>

105
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,140
<i>because thoughts tend to wander... </i>

106
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,220
<i>And you can't channel them forever
in a course that isn't theirs. </i>

107
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,300
<i>You can't deny
what those black tufts remind you of,</i>

108
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,940
<i>with their shiny putrid hairiness?</i>

109
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,420
<i>A just-hatched bird,
still wet from the egg,</i>

110
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,980
<i>so touching</i>

111
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,860
<i>in its newborn weakness. </i>

112
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,820
<i>Still today, the child,</i>

113
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,860
<i>who would become all men,</i>

114
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,740
<i>retained his horror
of the slime that mocked him... </i>

115
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,260
Do you understand?

116
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,100
<i>I was learning what I knew,
but refused to hear:</i>

117
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,140
<i>That the body of women
calls for mutilation. </i>

118
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,700
<i>And yet no part of it is excessive. </i>

119
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,140
<i>Men rant against
something that's invisible. </i>

120
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,180
It's late, and you still know nothing
about women.

121
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,500
Why did you go and sit down?

122
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,940
Come take a closer look.

123
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,620
Isn't that what I pay you for?

124
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,940
Know why people drink
when they're together?

125
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,740
Because they have nothing to say.

126
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,060
They hope a bedroom
will make things better:

127
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,500
It's worse.

128
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,860
We drink because
there's no communication.

129
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,220
Nothing...

130
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,540
You speaking for me?

131
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,220
Not at all!

132
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,380
Man or woman, it makes no difference.

133
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,820
When you offer up
your perishable flesh,

134
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,700
when an opening in the flesh
is promised,

135
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,580
I lack words and thoughts...

136
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,060
I need alcohol...

137
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,620
I need to forget that bestiality.

138
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,860
That loneliness.

139
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,460
Aren't you afraid?

140
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,620
No, I control my impatience.

141
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,820
The waiting has become
part of my pleasure.

142
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,420
It's inherent in my demand.

143
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,460
Can you understand that?

144
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,580
<i>It reminds me of a time</i>

145
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:28,140
<i>when I was still naive
and far-removed from sex. </i>

146
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,180
<i>The silly local boys,
who already went around in a pack,</i>

147
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,340
<i>descended on our garden
behind the house</i>

148
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,660
<i>like a flight of partridges
in the hunting season. </i>

149
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,140
<i>After a short period of hostilities,</i>

150
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,220
<i>since I was the only enemy,
beating me wasn't glorious,</i>

151
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,260
<i>so we agreed to be friends... </i>

152
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,980
<i>To seal the peace, we played doctor. </i>

153
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,140
<i>I was the patient, of course. </i>

154
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,780
<i>A girl is a man's sickness. </i>

155
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,260
<i>So maybe
all these budding young doctors,</i>

156
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,140
<i>were disgusted forever</i>

157
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,660
<i>of the sight
of candid little virgin girls. </i>

158
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,540
I bless the day I was born
immune to you

159
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,820
and of all of your kind.

160
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,940
The elastic resistance
of a boy's anus doesn't lie

161
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,380
about the tightness

162
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,940
of his lower intestine.

163
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,220
The lie about the softness of women
is hateful...

164
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,660
the malevolent triviality,

165
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,820
that turns them into a trap.

166
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,580
The horror of Nothingness
that is the imprescriptible All.

167
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,460
I'm sick of your dallying!

168
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,020
You've hardly looked at me.

169
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,660
Look at me when I can't see myself.

170
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,780
Look at me when I can't see myself!

171
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,740
<i>The ocean,
despite its misleading male image,</i>

172
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,700
<i>rolled in the darkness
like a bitch in heat. </i>

173
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,260
<i>This ocean, like a woman,
could engulf you</i>

174
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:08,540
<i>and make you vanish into its loins. </i>

175
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,380
<i>So I felt trapped by a kind of sorcery</i>

176
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,700
<i>of the signs
and obscene sounds of nature. </i>

177
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,020
<i>Surrounded by the pleading moans
of the weak,</i>

178
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,340
<i>only I was strong... </i>

179
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,140
<i>Helpless against the whole world. </i>

180
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,260
It doesn't matter,

181
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,780
it doesn't matter,

182
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,060
it's just the first night.

183
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,260
It's the first night.

184
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,660
<i>Second night... </i>

185
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,420
Last night you wanted to kill me.

186
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,580
You fought that urge a long time.

187
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,820
How do you know?

188
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,540
It's an urge all men have,

189
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,620
that's how they are.

190
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,740
That's why they lie beside us.

191
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,740
The veils they adorn us with ritually,

192
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,900
anticipate our shrouds.

193
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,540
But you're not part of that.

194
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,220
You know nothing of it.

195
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,980
You don't know the harm you could do.

196
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:55,140
<i>Third night... </i>

197
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,420
Anyone could have come in.

198
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,500
Or anything.

199
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,180
That's what men can't stand.

200
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,460
It's why they've tried
to lock women up,

201
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,580
in all eras, all places,
under every latitude.

202
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,260
To protect us from ourselves, they say.

203
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,780
To break the spell of women.

204
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,660
In fact...

205
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,820
they're afraid
women don't belong to them.

206
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,300
They don't believe in basic freedom.

207
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:48,380
They threaten us with belts, padlocks,

208
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:52,340
their concept of chastity,

209
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:56,260
their foolish morals,

210
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,740
since they always need reassurances.

211
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,260
Yet they know one can't ask for proof.

212
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:10,060
Or else love has no meaning.

213
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,780
I wore it to keep blood off the sheets
in your absence.

214
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,220
But now that you're here...

215
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,660
Pull.

216
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,180
Pull.

217
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,980
It comes out easily.

218
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:07,020
See, that's all there is to it.

219
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,980
Because of this blood,
they say we're impure.

220
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,300
Sometimes they won't shake our hands.

221
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:22,340
And no intercourse during the period
they call our period.

222
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,140
In fact,

223
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:31,020
they're scared of this blood
that flows without the need of a wound.

224
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,140
What they call impurity,

225
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,860
I...

226
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,020
on the contrary...

227
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:58,260
I can put it in a glass of water,
as the aged do their dentures.

228
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:04,180
I watch the haze of red blood

229
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,300
spreading in the water...

230
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,340
Don't we drink the blood
of our enemies?

231
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,300
Isn't that what women are to men?

232
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,020
Here, drink!

233
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,900
We make such a big deal of it.

234
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,340
See the space it takes up,
and one can't even feel it?

235
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,380
The same space
as most human penises.

236
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,540
Proof that in intercourse
the act isn't what matters,

237
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:43,980
but its meaning.

238
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,220
I can push it in just like that,

239
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,460
to the tip...

240
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,940
Without feeling anything,

241
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:02,860
no sensation of pleasure at all.

242
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,860
A very ordinary gesture...

243
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,940
Look...

244
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,540
There's a whole device
to make it look complex.

245
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:25,060
So one can insert it,

246
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,140
without touching oneself,

247
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,220
keeping one's virginity intact.

248
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,940
Without exploring one's genitals.

249
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,780
You insert the tip of the cardboard,

250
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,060
push on it like a syringe

251
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,940
to inject yourself like...

252
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,060
shooting up into your veins,

253
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:56,220
only feeling the hygiene
of the absorbent cotton.

254
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,420
As if to staunch a wound

255
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,620
that is painful and highly sensitive.

256
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,980
I don't feel a thing...

257
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:09,980
Nothing!

258
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,740
Isn't that laughable?

259
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:30,140
I'd gladly laugh, but it foretells
of something terrifying.

260
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,860
Something terrifying
had to lurk in the brain

261
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:39,180
of whoever designed,
and put his servile signature

262
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,140
on this infamous thing!

263
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:44,860
A man, for sure.

264
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:49,060
Who feels superior and protective.

265
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:52,100
Who doesn't like us.

266
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:05,100
In fact, men never understood
who we are.

267
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,700
They fear us, like kids
who are afraid of the dark.

268
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,900
Tell me...

269
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,900
Did I lose all my dignity
doing that in front of you?

270
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:38,820
Tell me!

271
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,540
<i>Fourth night... </i>

272
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,980
See anything?

273
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:11,700
You can't see anything, right?

274
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:24,460
I can hide it inside me,
for as long as I want.

275
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,060
I can also make it come out

276
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,620
when I want.

277
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,780
You don't like us replacing you.

278
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:46,860
No.

279
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,380
Yes.

280
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:56,700
Everything you see there
is non-existent.

281
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:59,420
The only thing that gives me pleasure

282
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,660
is the movement of your hand,

283
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:05,540
as you put the stone dildo
back inside me...

284
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:10,980
Because, you see,

285
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:12,780
you see...

286
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:47,140
It's beautiful,
you look like you're bleeding.

287
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:53,140
You're afraid
because you think you're bleeding,

288
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:55,100
even though you know you're not.

289
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:59,620
This hemorrhage is from
the fertile blood of women.

290
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:05,180
You worry that I may have cursed you,

291
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,260
ruined your penis for life.

292
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:08,940
Right...

293
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:15,180
When you stick it into a man,
sometimes it must come out soiled.

294
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:19,180
You're not angry at them,
you're not sad or afraid.

295
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:22,620
Sometimes it happens.

296
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:26,540
But fecal matter is inert.

297
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,460
It has been through the life-cycle.

298
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:35,020
In that, it's like human nature.

299
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:42,700
Man can't give life.

300
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,060
He takes it.

301
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:51,260
He gives death.

302
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,300
And so gives eternal life.

303
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,660
<i>As I left,
she slipped me the money I had earned. </i>

304
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:32,660
<i>By keeping the money,
I exited from the myth. I lost her. </i>

305
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,540
<i>I knew it at once. </i>

306
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,300
<i>But in fact, I'd been caught off guard,</i>

307
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:42,820
<i>and took the money
when I wanted to refuse it. </i>

308
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:47,140
Paul!

309
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,460
Same again, please.

310
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:59,020
Make that two. Another for him, too.

311
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,100
Don't think about it anymore.

312
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:10,300
Forget it. She was a bitch.

313
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:13,140
A slut,

314
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,100
like any other.

315
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:25,020
Yes, but the queen of sluts.

316
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:33,020
I reamed her pussy so hard,
no one will want her again!

317
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,380
You're right,

318
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:43,020
you have to hump 'em like goats!
Like goats!

319
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:45,620
As many as you can!

320
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:50,260
So you're immunized against them all.

321
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,780
If you let one get under your skin,

322
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:58,660
you're fucked, you're done for!

323
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,060
But she took everything!

324
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,420
Get it? She took all I had.

325
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,100
You can get drunk,
she can't take that.

326
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:07,060
They can't take that away.

327
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,420
They can't, get it?

328
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:25,180
I made her crap her shit
and wallow in her piss...

329
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:30,140
That slut! She was a pigsty
by the time I left.

330
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:34,140
A human being wouldn't let
anyone use her as I did.

331
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:42,060
But she always wanted more!
She wanted more!

332
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:44,860
She wanted more and more!

333
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:52,140
I should've ripped her guts out
and made her eat them!

334
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:53,980
You're right, you're right.

335
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,460
Drink!

336
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,580
I don't even know her name.

337
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,300
I really knew her...

338
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,700
I experienced total intimacy with her.

339
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:30,540
And I don't even know her name.

340
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:48,780
I don't need this.

341
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:52,260
Neither do I.

342
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:34,300
<i>I refused to believe
that what she gave me, was mine now,</i>

343
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:37,380
<i>and I could draw on it
for my existence. </i>

344
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:41,620
<i>I wanted to start all over again,
from the very beginning. </i>

345
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:44,500
<i>This time fully aware
of what I was doing. </i>

346
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:48,820
<i>I didn't want to admit
that life isn't like that. </i>

347
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:52,460
<i>That nothing can be done
all over again. </i>
