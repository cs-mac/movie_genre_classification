- Some clients were late.

Laurence, don't leave your bag there, please.

Do you want me to make a sandwich?

36
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,670
Not at the moment.
I must get these out the way.

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,197
Laurence, you want to have your bath.
They'll be here soon.

- Come on!
- Laurence, you'll get heartburn!

Mr O'Haligan? Mr Moss here, Wibbly Webb.

Where's that key to 15 Clittingham Avenue?

You were supposed to have it back before lunch.

00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,114
That's no good, I need it now.

43
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,475
Will you be in in the morning?

44
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,517
Tonight? Where?

45
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,118
Belfast? What time's your plane?

46
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,675
All right, train, then.

47
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,236
What? A party?
I thought you said you were going to Belfast?

48
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,672
All right, what time are you going to Kilburn?

49
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,952
What time are you having your bath?

50
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,432
I'm not asking you to bath in cold water!

51
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,353
I just want the key to 15 Clittingham Avenue.

52
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,592
Yes!

53
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,353
What? All right, I WILL come and get it.

54
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,589
- Now.
- Laurence, no!

55
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,752
Yes, I do know how to get there.

56
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:39,189
OK, I'll see you shortly. Goodbye.
...That stupid man!

- What?

58
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,393
- How long's this going to take, please?
- I'm sorry.

59
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,516
It won't take long.

60
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,189
Did you get those lagers?

61
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,354
Er, no, I didn't have time.

62
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,192
Laurence!

63
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,670
Get them when you go out,
and don't forget, please.

Hello, Mrs Cushing?
Laurence Moss here, Wibbly Webb.

65
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,359
Yes, we've finally run him to ground.

66
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,752
You'll be happy to know
I'm in the throes of retrieving the key.

67
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,429
Not at all, not at all. All part of the service!

68
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,752
Yeah, surely. When would be best for you?

69
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,837
No, no. I'll fall in with you, Mrs Cushing.

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,992
- What about tomorrow morning?
- Laurence!

71
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,675
My pleasure, Mrs Cushing.
What time suits you best?

72
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,512
No, I am at your service, Mrs Cushing.

73
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,155
He who pays the piper calls the tune.
You name the hour, I shall appear.

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,231
No, really, I insist. Now, what time?

75
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,309
- Eight o'clock?
- Laurence!

76
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,712
Early? No, not at all, no.
Up with the lark, you know!

77
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,199
Yes.

78
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,955
Don't mention it, Mrs Cushing. My privilege.

79
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,149
See you tomorrow morning, then.

80
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,039
Yes... Bye now!

81
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,317
- You'll kill yourself, you know, Laurence.
- Yes. It can't be helped.

82
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,753
Ridiculous.

83
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,233
- It's not a nine to five job, you know, Beverly.
- You can say that again!

84
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,115
- Gonna get changed?
- Oh, yes.

85
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,432
I'll drink this, I'll get changed, and then I'll go out.

86
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,955
And don't forget those lagers.

87
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,310
- Beverly, where are the olives?
- In the kitchen, Laurence.

88
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,439
Laurence, if you want olives,
would you put them out?

89
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,158

90
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,110

- No, they're not. And you're not changed.

91
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,396
Yes, I know that.

92
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,515
Beverly, get the olives.

93
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,711
- Hello, you must be Laurence.
- That's right.

94
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,553
- I'm Angie.
- Do go in, won't you?

95
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,349
Thanks. This is my husband, Tony.

96
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,590
- How do you do?
- Hello.

97
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,076
- Hi, Ange!
- Hello, Beverly.

98
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,471
- Oh, what a lovely dress!
- Thanks.

99
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,668
- Were we meant to wear long?
- No, no, it's just informal.

100
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,229
This is my husband, Tony.

101
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,915
- How do you do? Pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?

102
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,709
He's got a firm handshake, hasn't he? Fantastic.

103
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,713
- Like to come through?
- Mmm.

104
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,830
Angela... Tony.

105
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,717
This is the suite I was telling you about.

106
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,509
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Lovely.

107
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,955
- Drink?
- Yes, please.

108
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,237
- Laurence, would you take Angela's coat?
- Surely.

109
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,595
- Thanks.
- Pleasure.

110
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,272
It's funny, he's a lot bigger than I thought he was.

111
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,037
I've seen him across the road and thought he was
the same size as Laurence, but he's a lot bigger.

112
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,435
- Like a drink?
- Yes, please.

113
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,670
- What would you like?
- Bacardi, please.

114
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,512
- Ice and lemon?
- Please.

115
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,159
- Angela?
- Gin?

116
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,719
- Gin and tonic?
- Please.

117
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,235
- Ice and lemon?
- Yes, please.

118
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,834
Laurence, would you get the drinks?

119
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,470
Tony would like Bacardi with ice and lemon.

120
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,633
Angela would like gin and tonic,
ice and lemon and I'd like a fill up. OK?

121
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,756
- Fine.
- Thanks.

122
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,916
- Like lager, Tony?
- I'm OK with Bacardi, thanks.

123
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,675
No, as a chaser, a bit later.
Laurence is going to get some.

124
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,116
- OK, thank you.
- Or a light ale. Which do you prefer?

125
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,592
- Light ale.
- Light ale? Laurence, get some light ales too.

126
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,079
Yes.

127
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,313
Ange, it's going to be really nice tonight.
I've invited Sue from Number 9.

128
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,678
- Oh, lovely.
- I thought it would be nice for you to meet her.

129
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,278
Her daughter's having a party. So I said,
"Pop down and spend the evening with us."

130
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,560
That'll be really nice,
'cause I want to meet all the neighbours.

131
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,314
Just say hello, Ange, and break the ice.

132
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,430
That was what was so nice when you came over,
'cause it really made me feel at home.

133
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,230
Yeah, it's funny Ange, as soon as we met
I knew we were gonna get on.

134
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,312
Mmm. Well, we're alike, aren't we?

135
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,878
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

136
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,557
- Ta.
- Cheers, everyone.

137
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,632
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Tone.

138
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,873
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

139
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,999
- Darling, are you staying or going?
- I'll stay for a while.

140
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,470
Laurence has to pop out on business,
I'm afraid, so...

141
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,348
Who'd like a cigarette?
Laurence, would you, please? Angela?

142
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,273
- No, thanks.
- Tony, would you like one?

143
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,113
- No, thank you.
- We've just given up.

144
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,714
Oh, yes. Sorry.

145
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,395
- Who'd like some olives?
- Not for me. Ange?

146
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,028
- No, thanks.
- Tony, do you like olives?

147
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,395
- No, I don't.
- Horrible, aren't they?

148
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,156
- Told you nobody would like olives.
- Not "nobody", Beverly.

149
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,519
I like olives.
And that's 25% of the assembled company.

150
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,275
- We've met you before, haven't we?
- Really?

151
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,035
- He IS the one you remember, isn't he?
- Yeah.

152
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,670
Do you remember us?
We came looking for a house.

153
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,231
No, I can't say I do.
Of course, we see a lot of clients.

154
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,599
- We saw a lot of estate agents.
- Yes, we went to all the ones in the area.

155
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,718
We got the house from Spencer's in the end.

156
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,270
- Anthony Spencer.
- Anthony Spencer, yeah.

157
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,877
- He's very nice. Do you know him?
- Yes, I know him.

158
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,431
We were very lucky
because we got the price of the house down

159
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,311
- from 22,000 to 21,000.
- Really, Ange?

160
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,917
Oh, that is fantastic, isn't it? That's really great.

161
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,511
- Is it your first house?
- Yes. We were in a furnished flat before.

162
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,151
- That's a bit grim, isn't it, Ange, furnished flats?
- Yeah.

163
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,711
- Your bed arrived yet, Ange?
- Oh, don't talk about that!

164
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,678
- It's a sore point.
- Is it?

165
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,990
Well, it's funny, really.

166
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,188
I came home today
and saw this big parcel in the hall.

167
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,035
- Yes?
- Then I saw his face and he looked furious!

168
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,634
I thought, "Ooh, what's happened?"

169
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,510
And you know what?
The bed head had arrived and no bed!

170
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,672
No, Ange! Oh, that's disgraceful, isn't it?

171
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,276
- You've been sleeping on the floor, haven't you?
- Yes.

172
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,798
We've got a mattress from Tony's mum's,
but it's not the same.

173
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,279
No.

174
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,070
Well, let's face it, Tone.
You can't do much with a bed head, can you?

175
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,074
- What line of business are you in?
- He's in computers.

176
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,074
- That's funny, my brother's in computers.
- (ANGE) Is he?

177
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,710
- Yes, he's a programs?
- Analyst.

178
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,997
Oh, yes. Tony's just an operator.

179
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,993
Oh. I know it's a fantastic job, though, Tone.

180
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,153
'Cause my brother, Ange,
he had to go to college and get exams.

181
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,993
- And he studied for years, didn't he?
- Yes.

182
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,436
Did you have to do that, Tone,
go to college and all?

183
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,751
- You didn't really, did you?
- No.

184
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,399
- No.
- Hmm.

185
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,395
- These are lovely.
- They are, aren't they? Nice and dainty.

186
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,075
- Nine to five, is it?
- No, there's a lot of variation.

187
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,878
Shift work.

188
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,957
It's a two-weekly system.
One week I work from 8am to 4pm,

189
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,510
then I work from four till midnight,
every other Saturday off.

190
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,274
- Were you off today, Tone?
- Yes, I was.

191
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,117
It's lucky, 'cause if I'm working on a Saturday,
and he's off, he can do the shopping.

192
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,158
Oh. Don't you find shopping boring, Ange?

193
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,356
- Mmm.
- I do. I hate it.

194
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,992
He takes me down in the car, I get my wheelie,
Tone, I whiz in and grab anything I can see,

195
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,869
bung it in my wheelie, he writes me a cheque,
we bung it in the car,

196
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,318
- and then it's done for the week.
- Beverly's not very organised.

197
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,358
She doesn't believe in making shopping lists.

198
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,751
- You have a car, do you?
- Yes, an Escort.

199
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,399
- A yellow one?
- Yes.

200
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,279
- I've seen it.
- Yes, it's beautiful.

201
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,434
- Beverly was saying you only like Minis.
- No, no, not at all, no.

202
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,195
I don't only like Minis. No, I like lots of other cars.

203
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,389
But I find the Mini economic, efficient and reliable.

204
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,233
And the most suited for my purposes.

205
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,678
Of course, I change my car every year.

206
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,479
Yeah, but what I say, Ange, is this.

207
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,474
What's the point in changing your car
just to change the colour?

208
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,074
That's not all you change, Beverly!

209
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,800
The design does alter!

210
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,428
- You're not a motorist. You don't understand.
- OK, Laurence!

211
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,672
- I know I failed my test three times...
- Three times!

212
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,960
Plus, Ange, I'm his wife. A wife
should have a little say in choosing the car.

213
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,874
When you've passed your test,
you can have a little say.

214
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,157
Until then, Beverly, please leave it to me.

215
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,150
Let me put it this way, Ange.

216
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,596
When we chose the furniture,
we chose it together.

217
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,274
When we chose the house, we chose it together.

218
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,719
- But when it comes to...
- Beverly, that is a ridiculous argument.

219
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,238
Buying a house is one of the most important
decisions you ever make in your life.

220
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,516
- Don't you agree?
- Yes.

221
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,389
- Isn't it, Tony?
- Definitely.

222
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,599
'Cause it was so worrying
with the mortgage and everything.

223
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,833
- 'Cause I never thought I'd live in a house.
- Didn't you, Ange?

224
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,994
- No.
- Excuse me, I'm afraid I really must be off.

225
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,516
- Don't be all night, please, Laurence.
- No.

226
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,317
I do apologise. I shan't be long.

227
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,233
- Don't forget the light ales!
- No. And the lagers.

228
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,468
- Are you going to take your test again?
- I'll have another try, Ange.

229
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:09,272
Don't get me wrong, Tone. It's not that
I can't drive. In fact, I'm a good driver.

230
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,749
But let me put it to you this way.

231
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,436
When I get to my test, my nerves fail me.
D'you know what I mean?

232
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,070
It was my nerves
that failed me last time, Ange.

233
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,236
Because I set off, Tone, behind this bloke who
was taking his test - a Chinese bloke, actually.

234
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,278
Right, so we were going along. Now...

235
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,876
My examiner had told me to turn left, right?

236
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,430
So we came to the first "Give way".

237
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,910
Now, the bloke in front, he slams his brakes on.

238
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,594
Now, I'm going behind him, I suppose
a bit too quick with my nerves, you know.

239
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,754
Right, so I slam my brakes on
and I went slap in the back of him.

240
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,708
Now, I reckon
that prejudiced my examiner against me.

241
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,633
- See what I mean?
- Oh, what a shame.

242
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,473
It was, actually. Can you drive, Ange?

243
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:07,113
No, I'd like to learn, but Tony won't let me.
He doesn't think I'd be any good.

244
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,274
It's a shame 'cause it's so awkward
for me to get to work since we've moved.

245
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,069
- Yeah.
- I could use the car when he wasn't working.

246
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,676
That would make you
completely independent of Tone.

247
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,671
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

248
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,072
- Did you pass your test first time, Tony?
- Yeah.

249
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,674
Yeah, I thought so, actually.

250
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,513
He looks the type, doesn't he? Yeah.

251
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,877
- Who's for another drink? Ange?
- Yes, please.

252
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,952
- Thanks.
- Tony? Another drink?

253
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,997
- Ta.
- Thanks.

254
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,440
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

255
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,751
Er, Tony, could you give me a hand, please?

256
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,718
Won't the car start?

257
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,313
No.

258
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,074
- Go on, Tony!
- All right!

259
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,635
You mind you don't
get dirt on your suit, Tone, OK?

260
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,596
- Ange.
- Thanks.

261
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,830
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

262
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,993
Ange...

263
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,633
Can you take a little bit of criticism?

264
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,316
Please don't be offended when I say this,
Ange, but I can see what you've done.

265
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,473
OK, you've sat in front of your mirror
and put your lipstick on.

266
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,518
Next time, will you try this for me?

267
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:38,516
This is something, Ange, I always
used to tell my customers, and it always works.

268
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:45,074
Now, next time, sit down in front of your mirror
and just look at yourself and relax.

269
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,870
And just say, "I've got very beautiful lips."

270
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,196
Then take your lipstick and apply it.
And Ange, you'll see the difference,

271
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,798
because then you will be applying that lipstick
to every single corner of your mouth.

272
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,632
- Know what I mean?
- Mmm.

273
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,075
- Will you try it for me?
- Yes.

274
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,155
Just sit in front of your mirror,
look at yourself, relax, and just say?

275
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,952
"I've got very beautiful lips."

276
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,908
Yeah. I promise, Ange,
you'll see the difference! OK?

277
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,310
Mmm. Thanks.

278
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,391
(DOORBELL)

279
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,632
Would you excuse me, Ange,
for one minute?

280
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,950
- That'll be Sue.
- Oh.

281
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,471
- Hi, Sue.
- Hello, Beverly.

282
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,835
- Come in.
- Thank you.

283
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,434
- All right, Sue?
- Yes, thank you.

284
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,318
Come through.

285
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,111
- I'm sorry I'm a bit late.
- Don't worry, Sue.

286
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,999
Would you like to slip your little jacket off?

287
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,475
- Everything all right, Sue?
- Yes, I think so. I hope so!

288
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,074
- That's it. Thanks.
- Thank you.

289
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,754
Like to come through and say hello?

290
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,192
- Ange, this is Sue. Sue, this is Ange.
- Hello.

291
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,351
- How do you do?
- Sue's at Number 9.

292
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,830
- We've just moved into Number 16.
- Really?

293
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,117
- You know the MacDonalds' house?
- Yes.

294
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,512
Sit down, Sue. I won't be a second,
I'll just pop your coat away.

295
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,752
- Make yourself at home!
- Thank you.

296
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,989
- We've only been here a fortnight.
- Oh, really?

297
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,638
- Did you bring that, Sue?
- Yes.

298
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,870
- Is it for us?
- Yes.

299
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,158
- Oh, thank you, Sue.
- It's nothing special, I'm afraid.

300
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,788
- Isn't that kind, Ange?
- Yes.

301
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,511
- Not at all.
- Lovely. Laurence likes a drop of wine.

302
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,479
Fantastic, it's Beaujolais. Lovely.
Won't be a sec. I'll just pop it in the fridge.

303
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,239
I'm so pleased to meet you.

304
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,188
- I want to meet all the neighbours.
- Yes.

305
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,112
Now then, Sue. What would you like to drink?

306
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,635
I'll have a glass of sherry, please.

307
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,758
- A sherry? Are you sure?
- Yes, thanks.

308
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,755
'Cause we've got everything. Gin, whisky,
brandy, vodka, whatever you like.

309
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:28,350
Would you like a gin and tonic, Sue?
Me and Ange are drinking gin and tonic.

310
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,715
- Oh, all right.
- Ice and lemon?

311
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,075
- Er, yes, please.
- Great.

312
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,279
- It's a nice drink, gin and tonic, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

313
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,431
Refreshing.

314
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,353
Sometimes, I drink lager and lime.

315
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,672
Say I'm in a pub with my husband, I'll drink that.

316
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,195
But I prefer this!

317
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,639
- Can I wash my hands, please?
- One second, Tone, while I make Sue's drink.

318
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,191
- Ooh, sorry. Sue, this is Tony.
- My husband.

319
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,430
(BOTH) How do you do?

320
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,592
- Did you push it all right?
- Yeah.

321
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,990
Battery was flat.

322
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,674
- Sue.
- Thank you.

323
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,115
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

324
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,033
Now, Tony, hands. Come through.

325
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,079
This is our downstairs toilet. OK?

326
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,673
Ta.

327
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,640
- Do you work?
- No, no, I don't.

328
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,597
- I'm a nurse.
- Oh.

329
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,150
- At St Mary's in Walthamstow.
- Oh, yes.

330
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,713
- Beverly says your daughter's having a party.
- That's right, yes.

331
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,952
- Has it started yet?
- Yes, it has.

332
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,469
- All right, Tone?
- Yes, thank you.

333
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,358
Come through.

334
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,114
- Drink's on there. Like to sit down?
- Ta.

335
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,359
Now, then, Sue. Let's see.

336
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,511
- Would you like a cigarette, Sue?
- No, thank you.

337
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,511
- Sure?
- Yes, thanks.

338
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,433
Perhaps you'll have one later on. OK?

339
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,631
And I know Angela doesn't want one.

340
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,836
- Everybody OK?
- (ALL) Yes, thank you.

341
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,033
Great!

342
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,873
<i>(MUSIC STARTS)</i>

343
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,157
Aye aye! It's started, Sue!

344
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,916
- Yes, they've got the record player going.
- Yes.

345
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,755
- They're going to have fun, aren't they?
- Sounds like it!

346
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,549
- I hope so.
- How old is your daughter?

347
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,918
- 15.
- What's she look like? I might have seen her.

348
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,999
Oh, well, she's quite tall
and she's got fair hair, quite long fair hair.

349
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,709
She hasn't got a pink streak in her hair, has she?

350
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,199
Yes.

351
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,388
Yeah, that's Abigail, Ange.
And she wears those jeans with the patches on

352
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,678
and safety pins
going down the side of a scruffy bottom.

353
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,072
- And plumbers' overalls.
- Plumbers' overalls. She makes me die!

354
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,711
I saw her, she was standing
outside your gate with a friend.

355
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,158
And you've seen her as well,
getting off that motorbike.

356
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,072
Yeah.

357
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,919
- How many are coming to the party?
- About 15, isn't it, Sue?

358
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:34,757
Well, it was 15, then it went up to 20,
and last night I gathered it was 25.

359
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,152
- It's creeping up, Sue.
- I've told her that's the limit.

360
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,279
- Well, I think that's enough. Don't you?
- Definitely, Sue.

361
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,149
But this is it with teenagers.

362
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,632
OK, they tell you 25, but a friend invites a friend.

363
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:57,113
That friend invites another friend,
until you end up with about 70 or 80.

364
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,317
Now this is it. This is the danger.

365
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,835
I saw a couple of people arriving.

366
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,310
Yes, it was nice of them to help you with the car.

367
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,439
Not them. Two coloured chaps
and a girl roared up in a Capri.

368
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,113
Oh, really.

369
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,354
There were only half a dozen there
when I left - when I was asked to leave!

370
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,956
This is it, they don't
want Mum sitting there, do they?

371
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,680
No, not when they get to 15!

372
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,791
When I was 15, I really wanted a party of my own.

373
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,520
And my dad, he'd never let me.

374
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:40,434
You see, he was worried about people
pinching things and things getting broken.

375
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:46,311
- Have you locked your silver away, Sue?
- No, I haven't got any. Well, not much.

376
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,314
But I have put a few things upstairs,
in case of accidents.

377
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,790
Yes, it's better to, isn't it?
'Cause it can easily happen.

378
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,638
Don't get me wrong, Sue. I wasn't meaning
that any of Abigail's friends are thieves.

379
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,396
Please don't think that.
But you don't know who you get at a party.

380
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,792
- Let's face it, people are light-fingered.
- Yes.

381
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,236
- Did you leave your carpets down, Sue?
- Yes.

382
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,834
- Have you got fitted carpets?
- Yes.

383
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,309
Yes, we've got fitted carpets.

384
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,554
The MacDonalds left them all.
They were inclusive in the price of the house.

385
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,950
- Oh.
- And we were very lucky,

386
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,558
'cause we got the price of the house down
from 22,000

387
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,188
- to 21,000.
- Oh, really?

388
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,229
I don't know what we'll do
about our carpets when we have a party.

389
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,439
- We're having a party soon, aren't we?
- House warming.

390
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,479
- Yes. You'll have to come.
- Thank you.

391
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:53,795
With fitted carpets you don't know what to do
for the best, particularly with teenagers,

392
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,999
because, let's face it,
they're not as careful as we would be.

393
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:03,075
Know what I mean? They don't think.
A drink in one hand, a cigarette in the other.

394
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,314
They're dancing and the next thing,
it's cigarette on your carpet and stubbed out.

395
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,028
- Did you get that beer, Sue?
- Yes, four of those big tins and some pomagne.

396
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,794
- That's nice, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

397
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,829
Yes. It's funny,
at that age we used to drink Bulmer's cider.

398
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,549
We used to say,
"A glass of cider and she's anybody's!"

399
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,799
I got very drunk on champagne at our wedding.

400
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,838
- D'you remember?
- Yeah.

401
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,675
- Gives you a terrible headache, champagne.
- Yes, in the morning.

402
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,478
Shocking.

403
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,512
- Did you get any spirits, Sue?
- No, I didn't.

404
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,275
Very wise. They're so expensive, aren't they?

405
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,513
Let's face it, if they want spirits
they can bring their own.

406
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,071
Particularly the older boys,
'cause they're working, aren't they?

407
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,232
There will be older boys at the party, won't there?

408
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,278
- Oh, yes. A few, anyway.
- Yeah.

409
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,993
Let's face it, Ange, when you're 15, you don't
want to go out with a bloke who's 15, do you?

410
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,230
They're babies, aren't they?

411
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,076
I mean, when I was 15,
I was going out with a bloke who was 21.

412
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,073
Hey, Sue, how's Abigail getting on
with that bloke, by the way?

413
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,471
- I'm not sure. I daren't ask.
- Yeah.

414
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,749
Mind, I reckon you're better to let her go out
with as many blokes as she wants to at that age

415
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,832
rather than stick to one. Do you agree, Ange?

416
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,835
- Yes. How many boyfriends has she got?
- I don't know.

417
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,552
- I don't think she knows herself, really.
- Footloose and fancy free!

418
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,514
Actually, Sue, I was just thinking.

419
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,073
It might be a good idea if a bit later on
Laurence and Tony popped down there.

420
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,232
Now, I don't mean to go in Sue, no.

421
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,349
Just to check everything's OK and put
your mind at rest. Don't you agree, Ange?

422
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,876
Yes, it's a good idea. You don't mind, do you?

423
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,674
- No.
- It's very nice of you, but not necessary.

424
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,319
- Your husband's away, is he?
- No, we've split up, actually.

425
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,711
- Are you separated or divorced?
- Divorced.

426
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,270
- When did you get divorced?
- Three years ago.

427
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,275
Oh, that's given you time
to sort of get used to it, hasn't it?

428
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,389
We've been married nearly three years.
Three years in September, isn't it?

429
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,519
- We've been married three years.
- That's funny.

430
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,915
We were all getting married about the same time
as you were getting divorced.

431
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,389
- What a coincidence.
- Yes!

432
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,630
- Where is he now? Do you know?
- Yes, he lives quite near here.

433
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,112
- Oh, that's nice. Do you keep in touch?
- Yes.

434
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,477
- He pops over to see the kids.
- Every Sunday.

435
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,073
- Does he?
- For lunch.

436
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,597
- Oh, lovely. Is he coming tomorrow?
- Yes, I expect so.

437
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,354
That's nice, for the kids.

438
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,839
Yeah.

439
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,790
Let's face it, Sue, whatever you say about him,
he is their father.

440
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,959
Yes.

441
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,838
You all right, Tone?

442
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,278
Yes, thank you.

443
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,671
- What did your husband do?
- He's an architect.

444
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,035
That's a good job, isn't it?

445
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,112
- It's a good job, architecture.
- Well paid.

446
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,193
- It can be. It's quite a long training though.
- Yes.

447
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,272
- Has David married again, Sue?
- Yes.

448
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,513
Oh, well, it's a good job
that he's got a... good job, then.

449
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,514
I mean if he's got two families to support.

450
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,598
- Have they got any children, Sue?
- No.

451
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,436
She wants some, so they're trying, but they
don't seem to have had any success so far.

452
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,149
- Does she come over on Sundays?
- No, he comes on his own.

453
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,678
Oh, but I suppose, like, when your kids go
over there it's nice for her

454
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,630
- 'cause she's got a ready-made family.
- They don't go over there.

455
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,553
- Well, hardly ever.
- Don't you get on with her?

456
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,039
No.

457
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,555
Well, I hardly know her.

458
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,474
Well, I mean,
if your husband runs off with another woman...

459
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,918
Let's face it, Ange,
you can hardly be the best of mates!

460
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,470
- Now, who's for another drink? Ange?
- Please.

461
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,039
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

462
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,112
- Sue? Another drink?
- I've still got some, thanks.

463
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,477
Come on, I'll give you a top-up. That's it. Lovely.

464
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,956
Tony, another drink?

465
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,838
- Ta.
- Thanks.

466
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:51,357
I think more and more people
are getting divorced these days.

467
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,670
Definitely, Ange, definitely.

468
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,832
Mind you, I blame a lot of it on women's lib.

469
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,312
And on permissiveness
and this wife-swapping business.

470
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,358
- Don't you, Tone?
- I s'pose so.

471
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,636
- Don't you, Sue?
- Possibly.

472
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,519
I mean, take Peter Sellers, for example.

473
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:14,037
- He's been married five or six times.
- Four, actually.

474
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,111
Is it four, Sue?

475
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,317
Look at Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.

476
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,234
Now, to me, Ange, their relationship is ridiculous.

477
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,915
I think they make a mockery of marriage.
It's disgusting.

478
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:32,473
- They only do it for the publicity.
- Yeah, let's face it, with film stars,

479
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,712
I reckon the attraction is purely physical.

480
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,077
- They did it in the jungle.
- Yeah.

481
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,234
I mean, let's face it, getting divorced,
to a film star, is like going to the lavatory...

482
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,516
...if you'll pardon my French!

483
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,434
But to us, it's a big wrench, isn't it, Sue?

484
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,830
- Yes, of course.
- Yes.

485
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,312
But I think film stars only get married
because the public expects it.

486
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,630
- Do you?
- Yes.

487
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,076
I think people take divorce for granted.

488
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,518
I think if they stuck it out,
they'd be all right, don't you?

489
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,959
But there are times when you could hit 'em
on the head with a rolling pin and clear out!

490
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,395
Well, it's like Tony and me.

491
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:21,510
We've only been married nearly three years,
but we're always having rows, aren't we?

492
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,079
Yeah.

493
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,074
- Does she give you a bad time, Tone?
- Ta... Shocking.

494
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,392
- I think it spoils things, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

495
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:37,237
Mind you, I reckon, sometimes
a little row adds a sparkle to a relationship.

496
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,915
- Did you have a lot of rows with your husband?
- No, we didn't, actually.

497
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,390
There you go, Ange,
it doesn't always follow, does it?

498
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,278
- No.
- No, it's funny.

499
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,595
- Do you think people should get married, Tony?
- Sometimes.

500
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,958
Ah, he's not so sure, you see,
since he's been married to me!

501
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,948
Perhaps we should live in sin
and forget the whole thing!

502
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,476
Did you live with Laurence
before you got married?

503
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,916
- No, I didn't, no.
- Do you think if you had done,

504
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,355
you'd still have married him?

505
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,353
No!

506
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,150
Don't get me wrong.
I do love Laurence... in my own way.

507
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:26,038
But, if we'd lived together, say for a year,
I don't honestly think it would have worked out.

508
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,150
- If you have kids you ought to get married.
- Definitely. Give 'em a name.

509
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,756
- Yes.
- You'll be having all this soon, Sue.

510
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,196
- Do you think Abigail is the marrying type?
- I hope so.

511
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:46,036
- You'll probably get married again yourself soon.
- That's not very likely.

512
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:51,115
You never know, 'cause
I never thought anyone would marry me.

513
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,037
And I met Tony and we were married
within a year, weren't we?

514
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,191
- Eight months.
- Yes.

515
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,033
- So, you see, it can happen.
- Really?

516
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,839
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- No.

517
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,277
Would you like kids, Ange?

518
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,476
- Yes, I would.
- Would you?

519
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,273
- Would you, Tone?
- Not for a while.

520
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,069
- Not till we're settled in.
- Yeah, get sorted first.

521
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,951
- He'd make a nice dad, though.
- Yes.

522
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:27,069
Yeah, I could just see you with a little boy,
taking him out and looking after him.

523
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,028
- It would be nice to have one of each.
- Yeah, like Sue.

524
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,911
Mind, it's funny, Ange. Sue's kids, Abigail
and Jeremy, aren't a bit alike, are they, Sue?

525
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,436
- No.
- Like chalk and cheese, Ange.

526
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,388
Sue, how did Jeremy get on
packing his overnight bag?

527
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,835
- He loved it.
- Did he?

528
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,471
You know what kids are like.
He was so excited about packing all his things.

529
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,837
- He'd have taken the kitchen sink.
- Where's he gone?

530
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,389
- Around the corner.
- How old is he?

531
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,916
- Eleven and a half.
- Would you like kids?

532
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,273
No, I don't think I would, really.

533
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,116
Don't get me wrong.
It's not that I don't like kids, because I do.

534
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,192
But let me put it to you this way.

535
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,113
I wouldn't like to actually have to have them.

536
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,238
- Did you have yours in hospital, Sue?
- Yes.

537
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,952
You see, to me, having to go into hospital
would be like being ill, and I couldn't stand that.

538
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:30,353
I know it sounds horrible,
but having to breastfeed and change nappies

539
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,397
would actually make me heave.

540
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,510
- I don't think I've got that motherly instinct.
- No. You see, it would be different for me

541
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,911
- 'cause I'm used to looking after children.
- Mmm.

542
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,710
With children that are ill,
you've got to watch them every minute.

543
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,236
- Yeah.
- Recently, we had this little girl.

544
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,190
She was only about two
and she kept picking at her dressing.

545
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,592
She picked it all off
and got right down into the wound.

546
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,435
Sorry, Ange, but would you stop?
If you carry on, I'll faint.

547
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,116
- Leave it out, Ange.
- It's all right, she wasn't in any pain.

548
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,919
- But she got the stitches out...
- Drop it!

549
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,959
Did you know
my husband used to be a professional footballer?

550
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,757
- Really?
- He played for Crystal Palace, didn't you?

551
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,037
- Yeah.
- Oh, fantastic!

552
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,715
- It was before I knew him.
- For the reserves?

553
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,792
Oh, no. It was the first team.

554
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,792
- Honestly, is that true?
- For a bit, yeah.

555
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,030
Oh, Tony, that is fantastic!

556
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,478
Sue, we didn't know we had a celebrity
in Richmond Road, did we?

557
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,029
- No, we didn't.
- Tony, that's great.

558
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,589
That's made my night, honestly.

559
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,119
Laurence!

560
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,678
Would you excuse me, please, one minute?

561
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,279
Laurence!

562
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,112
(REGGAE MUSIC FILTERS THROUGH)

563
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,716
Nice music...

564
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,878
...isn't it, Tony?

565
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,674
- Would you like one?
- Thank you.

566
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,479
Ta.

567
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,271
I shouldn't be eating these, we had a big tea.

568
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,918
- Did you eat earlier?
- No, I didn't.

569
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,992
Oh, you must be hungry. Here...

570
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,513
- Have some peanuts.
- Thank you.

571
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,679
Thanks.

572
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,230
Eh, Sue, it's all happening at your place!

573
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,391
Ange, it's so funny!

574
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,314
Your bay window, Sue, at the front, it's wide open

575
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,756
and there's this bloke, he's gotta be 20 stone,

576
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,912
and he's wedged in your bay window.

577
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:34,154
He's got one of those purple vests on
and a great big fat belly sticking out, like this!

578
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,517
There's this girl, Sue,
standing in your front garden,

579
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,638
she is as thin as he's fat, right,

580
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,920
and she's like this, Ange,
draped around him, and they're snogging away.

581
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,392
- You've never seen anything so funny in your life!
- Oh, dear.

582
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,714
Don't worry, Sue, they're only having a bit of fun.
They're only teenagers.

583
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,235
I wonder if I dare pop down for a minute.

584
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,358
- Shall I go and have a look?
- No.

585
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,115
- It's no problem.
- No, thank you. Better not.

586
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,999
Sue's right. It's best not to pop down.

587
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,359
They're only having a bit of fun. Let's face it,
when Laurence gets back, we can discuss it.

588
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,078
OK?

589
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,718
Now, who's for another drink? Come on, Ange!

590
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,030
- Sue, another drink?
- No, thanks.

591
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,875
I'll just give you a little top-up. That's it. Lovely.

592
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,396
Just to settle your nerves, Sue.
Tony, another drink?

593
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,879
Ta.

594
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,390
- Cheers, Ange.
- Cheers.

595
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,836
- Where is Laurence, anyway?
- I don't know, Tony. I wish I did know.

596
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,309
What a lovely table!

597
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,914
This is what I'd really love.

598
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,278
- What's that, Ange?
- The candelabra? It's brilliant, isn't it?

599
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,750
- Is it real silver?
- Yeah. Silver plate, yeah.

600
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,593
Oh, it looks so lovely.

601
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,910
And with the light.

602
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,630
- Sue.
- Thank you.

603
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,112
- Are you all right, Sue?
- Fine, thank you.

604
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,599
Yes.

605
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,436
Sue, you must think I'm dreadful.
I'm sorry, I do apologise.

606
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,354
I haven't offered you anything to eat.
Have some nuts.

607
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,078
Thank you.

608
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,875
Take some crisps as well.

609
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,629
- That's it. Lovely.
- Thank you.

610
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,112
Now then, Sue, let's see.
A little cheesy pineapple one?

611
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,679
Thank you.

612
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,310
- Tone, a little cheesy pineapple one?
- Ta.

613
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,396
- Take another, Sue. Save me coming back.
- Thank you.

614
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,755
That's it. Lovely.

615
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,792
Now then, Sue.
Would you like a little cigarette, Sue?

616
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,556
- No, thank you. Not at the moment.
- Sorry, Sue. This is what I'll do.

617
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,590
I'll pop it on here for you. You can
light that when you've finished those, OK?

618
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:15,709
- Tony, come and see this beautiful kitchen.
- It's lovely, isn't it?

619
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,678
Oh, these tiles are gorgeous.

620
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,230
- Were they here when you came?
- Yeah, we were lucky.

621
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,437
You were, 'cause our kitchen's nothing like this.

622
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,071
- Tony, come and have a look.
- Have a look, Tone. They're beautiful.

623
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,753
Tony!

624
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,040
- He's nice, isn't he?
- Yes.

625
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,270
He's fantastic.

626
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,352
- Actually, they're a very nice couple.
- Yes.

627
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,554
Oh, and you've got one of these!

628
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,756
What's that, Ange?

629
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,994
- Oh, the rotisserie. Yeah.
- Do you do chickens and things on it?

630
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:10,110
Well, you can do. To be honest, I'm not much
of a cook, so I haven't used it yet. But you can.

631
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,836
- Laurence, where have you been?
- To the off-licence!

632
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,992
- Hello, Sue. All right?
- Fine, thank you.

633
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,070
Those want to go in the fridge, Laurence, to chill.

634
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,116
- All right, Ange?
- Yes.

635
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,350
Come through, Tone.

636
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,949
- Like to sit down, Tone?
- Ta.

637
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,799
Now, then, Sue. How about a little cigarette?

638
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,355
- There we are, Sue. OK?
- Thank you.

639
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,839
Lovely.

640
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,270
- Now, everybody OK?
- (ALL) Yes, thank you.

641
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,996
- Now, who's for a drink? Tony, light ale?
- Not just yet, thank you.

642
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,879
Go on, Tone. He got them specially for you.

643
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,079
If he doesn't want one, Beverly,
he doesn't have to have one.

644
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,196
- Sue?
- No, thank you.

645
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,079
- Angela?
- No, I'm all right, thanks.

646
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,117
- Beverly?
- I'm fine, thanks.

647
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,397
Laurence? ...Yes, please!

648
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,075
Thanks very much.

649
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:50,554
- Well, the party's hotting up at your place, Sue.
- So Beverly said.

650
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,190
Yes, Laurence,
we were saying it might be a good idea

651
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,750
if a bit later on you and Tony popped down.

652
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,959
- What for?
- To check everything's all right for Sue.

653
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:05,590
Put Sue's mind at rest,
because she's a bit worried.

654
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,150
- It'll be all right.
- There won't be any problems.

655
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:14,394
Laurence, I'm not saying there'll be problems,
I'm saying would you check for Sue.

656
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,711
I've just been past and everything seems OK.

657
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,158
- Did you see what was happening in the garden?
- Well, yes.

658
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,437
The couple snogging through the window.

659
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,990
- Through the window?
- With the dirty vest.

660
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,119
No, no. I saw a couple
down the side of the house.

661
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,796
And there were a few in the porch.
But I didn't see anybody in the window.

662
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,157
- Want to sit here, Laurence?
- No, stay where you are.

663
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,710
- Sit here. There's plenty of room.
- Thank you.

664
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,159
- Anyway, Sue, these things happen at parties.
- Yes, of course.

665
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,153
- I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.
- No.

666
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,716
Actually, Laurence,
you're being very unfair to Sue.

667
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,440
- Not at all.
- No, don't make excuses for him.

668
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,518
Apart from anything else,
Tony has already agreed to go.

669
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,955
- Have you?
- Yeah.

670
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:15,275
Yes, well, I didn't say I wouldn't go. If Sue
wants us to go, of course we'll go down there.

671
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,670
- I don't know that I do.
- Fine.

672
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,594
- Tony doesn't mind going on his own.
- No, I don't.

673
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,719
- I didn't say I wouldn't go.
- Fine, Laurence, are you going?

674
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,310
- Yes.
- Thank you.

675
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,436
That's quite all right.

676
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:40,792
I'm not saying there'll be any trouble, but
teenagers have a drink and get over-excited.

677
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,714
Yes, well, it starts with one kiss...

678
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,917
This is it. Then they find their way to the bedroom.

679
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,390
- Sue, do you like olives?
- Yes.

680
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,879
Fine!

681
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,838
- I'll get you some.
- Thank you.

682
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,034
- You've got a friend for life, Sue.
- Oh?

683
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,919
- None of us like olives.
- Oh, I see.

684
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,559
I can't stand them.

685
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,030
Those stuffed olives,
the little red bit that sticks out.

686
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,671
It reminds me of a little...
I'm not saying what it reminds me of!

687
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:19,960
- But it puts me off. I can't eat them!
- Not everyone can like everything.

688
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:25,077
It's like Tony. He doesn't like curry and I love it.

689
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:30,030
- So we never go in Indian restaurants, do we?
- No.

690
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,237
And he won't even eat curry at home,

691
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,437
which is a shame, 'cause I enjoy making it.

692
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,079
- Have you ever tried pilchard curry?
- No...

693
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,708
That's a very economical dish.

694
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,998
You just get one of those big tins
of pilchards in tomato sauce

695
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:53,439
and mix it with onions and curry powder
and it's really tasty.

696
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,955
But Tony won't touch it.

697
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,872
- Darling, have you got heartburn?
- No.

698
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,999
I haven't got heartburn,
just slight indigestion, that's all.

699
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,878
I thought so!

700
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,115
This is it, Ange.
He came in late and was all upset.

701
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,750
He's very highly strung, Sue.
It gives him heartburn.

702
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,831
Ah, he must be careful,

703
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,436
because when I was working in intensive care,

704
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:26,038
the people who'd had a cardiac arrest,
they were nearly all businessmen

705
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,510
and those who were worrying about their work.

706
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,231
- I hope you're listening to this, Laurence.
- Yes, I'm listening.

707
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,834
- Cigar?
- No, thanks, I've given up.

708
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,310
- Sure?
- Go on, Tone, take a little cigar.

709
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,995
- Enjoy yourself. Go on, take one.
- Take one.

710
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,230
- Ta.
- Tony!

711
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,153
Well, that counts, doesn't it?

712
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,915
- If he's having a cigar...
- Come on, Ange.

713
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,677
- Sue, would you like one?
- No, thank you.

714
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:02,868
- Some women do like them.
- So I understand. But I've got a cigarette.

715
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,473
Oh.

716
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,915
- Light?
- Ta.

717
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:18,272
- Laurence, would you put a record on?
- Yeah, surely. What would we like to hear?

718
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,716
- Demis Roussos.
- Oh, no, Beverly.

719
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,759
We don't want that fat Greek
caterwauling all night!

720
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,070
- Darling, not classical.
- Light classical, just as a background.

721
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,877
- Sue, do you know James Galway?
- Yes, I've heard him.

722
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,555
He's an up-and-coming
young flautist. Do you like him?

723
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,678
- Yes, he's very good.
- I'll put it on for you.

724
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:48,152
Laurence, we don't want to listen
to classical music at the moment.

725
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,871
- Well, what DO we want to listen to, Beverly?
- Demis Roussos.

726
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,194
Well, if everybody else wants to listen
to Demis Roussos, we'll put him on.

727
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:03,070
- Tone? Do you like Demis Roussos?
- Yeah, he's all right.

728
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,800
Fantastic, isn't he? Sue?

729
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,555
- I don't know him, I'm afraid.
- You'll like him, he's lovely.

730
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,269
- Sue, he's great. Would you like to hear him?
- Yes.

731
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,434
Yes? Laurence, Angela likes
Demis Roussos, Tony likes Demis Roussos,

732
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,479
I like Demis Roussos
and Sue would like to hear Demis Roussos.

733
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,349
So do you think
we could have Demis Roussos on?

734
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,115
- Yes.
- Thank you.

735
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,599
How are you enjoying your cigar?

736
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,637
Very nice, thank you.

737
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,076
- How's your cigarette?
- Oh, it's lovely.

738
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,633
Mind you don't choke on it.
You see, he's not used to smoking a cigar.

739
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,633
He doesn't know what to do with it!

740
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,189
He'll be all right.

741
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,793
Tone!

742
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,996
- Another drink?
- Ta.

743
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,677
- Ange? Another drink?
- Please. Thanks.

744
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,912
- Sue, another drink?
- No, thank you.

745
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,277
Come on, Sue, I'll just give you a top-up. Lovely.

746
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,273
- Like to help yourself, Tone?
- Ta.

747
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,074
- Fantastic drink, Bacardi.
- Yeah.

748
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,912
It's a knock-out.

749
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,550
- I started drinking it in Majorca.
- Have you been to Majorca?

750
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,676
- Yeah.
- Whereabouts?

751
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,274
- Palma.
- Not Palma Nova?

752
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,876
- That's right.
- Oh, Tony, isn't it beautiful?

753
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,473
- Yeah.
- Yes.

754
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,551
They drink it very long there
with ice and Coke and lemon and that.

755
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:45,070
It's my dream to lie on a beach
sipping Bacardi and Coke.

756
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,596
- Have you always had a moustache?
- What do you mean?

757
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,797
- Have you had it for a few years?
- Yes.

758
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,793
- Never thought of having a beard?
- No.

759
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,669
Laurence wouldn't suit a beard.
His face is too small.

760
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,196
Actually, I think a beard can look very scruffy.

761
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,953
(ANGE) Yes...

762
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:11,116
...but I think a man with a moustache
AND a beard, they look more masculine.

763
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,353
- Sexier, isn't it?
- Has your husband got a beard?

764
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,514
No. No, he used to have,
a long time ago, when I first knew him.

765
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:25,196
- Why did he shave it off?
- Well, he grew out of it.

766
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,559
- Do you play any instruments, Sue?
- No.

767
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,553
I used to play the piano when I was a child.

768
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,915
- The piano?
- Just a bit.

769
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,312
I once went for guitar lessons
but I never kept them up.

770
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,598
- That's a pity.
- Yes, I've often regretted it.

771
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:52,392
You know, I think that musicians
and artists are very lucky people.

772
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:56,109
They're born with one great advantage in life.

773
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,115
Do you know what that is?

774
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,077
Their talent.

775
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,708
They've got something to cling to.

776
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,277
I often wish I'd been born with that sort of talent.

777
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,718
Most people, they just drift through life

778
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,269
without any real aims.

779
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,710
They're weak.

780
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:27,230
It's no good just sitting there whining.
You've got to get up and do something about it.

781
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,758
Not that it isn't a fight. Of course it is.

782
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,156
Life is a fight.

783
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,360
People, er...

784
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,632
...they always seem to be against you.

785
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:48,399
Not that I've done badly.
No, no. I've done all right.

786
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,631
But, er...

787
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,312
...certainly an uphill battle.

788
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,435
I once went to a party
and they said, "Can anyone play the piano?"

789
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,353
I said, "Ooh, yes. I can."

790
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,988
And I can't play the piano.

791
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,948
I'd just learnt this one tune from a friend.

792
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:16,989
It was, # Buy a broom, buy a broom

793
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:21,153
# Buy a broom and sweep the room #

794
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,550
And that's all I knew.

795
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,793
You see, they wanted me
to play for musical chairs.

796
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:33,956
So I started, # Buy a broom, buy a broom #

797
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,154
I played it a few times,

798
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,915
- then thought, "I must do something different."
- Yes.

799
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,116
So I started, you know...

800
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,430
- Vamping, type of thing?
- Yes.

801
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,151
But as I can't play, oh, it sounded terrible.

802
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,232
- I felt such a fool.
- Yes.

803
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,472
I thought, "Why did I say I'd play?"

804
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,473
- When was this, Ange?
- It was only when I was eight.

805
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,710
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

806
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,839
- I still felt a fool, though.
- Yeah.

807
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:17,038
Would anybody mind if I turn this next track up?

808
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,192
It's my favourite. It's "Forever and Ever".

809
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,272
I'd like us all to hear it. Anybody mind?

810
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,112

- D'you think he's sexy, Ange?
- Yes.

817
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,434
It's a pity he's so fat.

818
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,718
Yeah, but he doesn't sound it, though,
when you hear him.

819
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,872
It's funny. He's still fantastic, though, isn't he?

- What for?
- Sue wants us to go and inspect the party.

836

- Fine. Would you go now, please?
- Really, it's all right.

- Are you coming, Tony?

Well, come on, then!

- Don't bother, Ange. He's spoiled it now.

- Forget it.
- And you were enjoying yourself.

Yeah. We were all enjoying ourselves,
weren't we?

01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:38,629
- Vomiting in front of blokes is embarrassing.
- Yes.

886
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,872
- And they're not usually sympathetic.
- No.

887
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,190
Well, I know Tony isn't.

888
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:50,230
'Cause if I've got a headache
or my period pains, he doesn't wanna know.

889
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,756
In fact, it annoys him.

890
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,076
This is it, you see, Ange.

891
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:00,870
I reckon a woman,
she needs love and affection from a bloke.

892
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:05,033
OK, sex is important, but it's not everything.

893
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:11,958
No. You see, if Tony comes home
and he's in a bad mood, I can't do anything right.

894
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,954
- They pick on you, don't they?
- Is he like that?

895
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:19,351
- Yes, he's very quick-tempered.
- Mmm.

896
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:23,274
- I think it's because of his red hair.
- Yeah.

897
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,635
Funny, though, isn't it, Sue?

898
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,952
- Sitting there, he looks so quiet and gentle.
- Yes, he does.

899
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:35,069
- Is he very violent?
- No, he's not violent.

900
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,391
He's just a bit nasty.

901
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:44,795
Like the other day,
he said to me he'd like to sellotape my mouth.

902
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,552
No, Ange!

903
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,748
- That's not very nice, is it?
- It certainly isn't, Ange. It certainly isn't.

904
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:56,152
- Was your husband violent?
- Oh, no, not at all.

905
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,788
She's one of the lucky ones, isn't she?

906
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,474
Definitely, Sue, yeah, definitely.

907
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:05,997
- Mind you, if Tony wasn't around, I'd miss him.
- Would you?

908
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,752
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

909
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,638
Funny, isn't it?

910
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,476
I suppose I would miss Laurence,
inasmuch as I need a bloke.

911
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,677
Let's face it, we all need a bloke, don't we?

912
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:22,152
OK, credit where it's due,
he's very good with money.

913
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:28,475
I mean if I want a new dress, make-up, have
my hair done, whatever, the money is there.

914
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,840
But apart from that, it's just boring.
Know what I mean?

915
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,319
- I think that comes from being married, though.
- Do you?

916
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,074
- The fun wears off.
- Yeah.

917
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,519
- (ANGE) Everything all right down there?
- I think so.

918
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:52,314
- How many's at the party, then?
- I didn't stop to count them!

919
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,471
This is my glass.

920
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,549
- It's all right, is it?
- Yes!

921
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:04,234
Oh, I'm sorry, Sue. Yes.

922
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:09,952
Yes, I went in and had a few words with them.
Everything seems to be all right.

923
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,236
Where's Tony got to?

924
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,278
You'd better ask him when he gets back.

925
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,557
- Did you see Abigail?
- I certainly did.

926
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,712
- Is she all right?
- I think so.

927
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:27,678
- Where is he?
- I don't know. I'm not his keeper!

928
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,038
- Did you talk to her?
- I asked her to turn the music down, yes.

929
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,839
- He's stayed at the party!
- Was she upset?

930
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,956
I don't think so.

931
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:42,592
He's probably being raped, Ange,
by a load of 15-year-old schoolgirls!

932
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:46,514
- Lucky them!
- Listen, I'll tell you something,

933
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:50,593
at least they had a bit of taste -
they didn't pick him!

934
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:57,558
I hope he's being a bit more enthusiastic
than when I leap on him!

935
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,632
- Is he one of those?
- Yes, he turns over!

936
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,758
- I've met those before!
- That's enough, Beverly!

937
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:10,956
- Christ, Laurence, as soon as I enjoy myself...
- Can't you see you're embarrassing Sue?

938
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:18,360
- I'm sorry, Sue. I didn't mean to embarrass you.
- That's all right.

939
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,114
Sue, it was only a little joke.

940
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:26,991
- Sue's not been feeling too good, anyway.
- What's the problem, Sue?

941
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:31,597
- She's been vomiting!
- Thank you, Beverly! Sue can speak for herself.

942
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:37,198
She's had a few too many gin and tonics,
and you've not had any tea, have you?

943
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,316
- No.
- Hasn't she, Ange?

944
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,550
- No.
- Like one of these?

945
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:45,395
Laurence, she doesn't want that
on an empty stomach!

946
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:51,192
- A sandwich, would you like a sandwich?
- She doesn't want a sandwich!

947
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,476
Well, I want a sandwich!

948
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,791
- Do you want a sandwich, yes or no?
- No! Thank you.

949
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,473
OK, fine!

950
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,640
I hope it chokes you!

951
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,950
What did you say, Beverly?

952
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:10,318
- Oh, my God! I'm gonna get stabbed!
- Don't tempt me!

953
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,789
Well, go on, then, do it!

954
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,551
Laurence, would you please
go back in the kitchen

955
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,713
and finish making
your little sandwich, all right?

956
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:38,159
- Sure you don't want a sandwich, Sue?
- Yes, thank you.

957
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,799
Fine.

958
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,950
(DOORBELL)

959
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,873
- Everything all right?
- What do you mean?

960
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:02,034
- I wondered where you'd got to.
- I wondered where YOU'D got to.

961
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,478
Come in.

962
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,997
What's that for?

963
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:10,473
I'm making a sandwich. Go in.

964
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,713
- Where have you been?
- Southend.

965
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,872
- Did you enjoy yourself?
- Wonderful.

966
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:26,749
Where have you been?
Laurence has been back ages.

967
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:30,356
- It's OK. Nothing to worry about.
- Good. Not too rowdy?

968
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,158
- No.
- Thank you.

969
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,310
- Like a drink?
- Please.

970
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,631
- What would you like?
- Light ale, please.

971
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,678
- A little Bacardi to go with it?
- No, thanks.

972
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,308
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

973
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,040
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

974
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,319
Great.

975
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,308
- Was Abigail all right?
- I think so.

976
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,711
- You saw her?
- I didn't see her, but I think she's OK.

977
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,438
- Tone?
- Ta.

978
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,960
- Your shirt's wet.
- What is it?

979
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:09,874
- Nothing.
- It's soaking wet.

980
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,474
- What were you doing?
- Nothing! Get off!

981
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:16,792
Bumped into somebody accidentally.
Nothing to worry about.

982
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,829
- Want to sit down, Tone?
- Ta.

983
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:25,951
Laurence didn't come back
with his shirt all wet, did he?

984
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:31,919
I don't think you two have been to the same party!

985
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,913
'Course we have! What are you talking about?

986
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:39,312
- Lay off her, Tone. She's only having a joke.
- See what I mean?

987
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,914
- What?
- Are you all right, Sue?

988
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:47,950
- Yes, but I think I should see Abigail myself.
- No. Sue, please don't go down there.

989
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:54,992
Listen to me, Sue. You know what Abigail's like.
She'll only shout at you and make you upset.

990
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,230
Please, Sue, sit down.

991
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,113
Sue, Tony has only just come back.

992
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,555
- It was all right, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

993
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,314
- Yeah.
- Nothing to worry about.

994
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:10,472
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

995
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,039
Yeah.

996
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,674
Now, come on, Sue. Sit down.

997
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,351
That's it!

998
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,555
Tell you what I'll do.

999
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,598
I'll put a little record on for us all, eh?

1000
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:34,718
Then we can all have a listen to that.

1001
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,394
Now, let's see what we've got.

1002
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,834
Ooh, I'll tell you what, Sue.
Do you like Tom Jones?

1003
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,198
- He's all right.
- He's great, isn't he? Do you like him, Ange?

1004
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,828
- Yes.
- Yeah, he's fabulous!

1005
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:54,512
Now, we'll put this on for Sue.

1006
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,788
Is Abigail always having parties?

1007
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,871
- No.
- Oh.

1008
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,478
- Ready, Ange?
- Mmm.

1009

(MUSIC: "IT'S NOT UNUSUAL")

1010

Oh, isn't he great?

1011
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,473

- Do you want to sit here?

01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,632
- No, thanks.
- Come on!

- No, thanks.
- Steady!

1023
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:06,149
Seen a few changes
since you've been here, Sue?

Not really, no.

1025

Come on, Sue.
Surely you must have seen some changes.

1026
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,636
New houses on the other side of Raven's Way.

1027
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,598
Yes, the houses. But what about people?

1028
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,796
What about them?

1029
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,873
The class of people.
Don't you think that's changed?

1030
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:29,033
- Not really, no.
- The tone of the area, don't you feel it's altered?

1031
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,670
- Not particularly.
- You don't think it's gone down?

01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,398
No.

1033
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,720
And you, Tony, come on!

1034
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:41,236
- What do you think, eh?
- I wouldn't know, would I?

1035
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,789
Oh, no, of course not.

1036
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:46,633
- You've just moved in, haven't you?
- Yes.

1037
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,916
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1038
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,435
- A drink?
- No, thank you.

1039
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,670
- Angela?
- Mmm, please!

1040
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,398
- It's more mixed, that's all.
- Mixed?

1041
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,592
Yes, I suppose you could say it was mixed.

1042
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,389
- More cosmopolitan.
- Nothing wrong with that.

1043
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:14,120
- Oh, you don't think so?
- No.

1044
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,874
Well, that's a matter of opinion.

1045
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,557
- Would you like another drink?
- I'm on soda water.

1046
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:25,111
- Fine. Would you like more soda water?
- Thank you.

1047
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,920
We like to keep our guests happy.

1048
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,748
- Do you read, Tony?
- Sometimes.

1049
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,595
- Sue?
- Thank you.

1050
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:46,036
- And just what do you read?
- All sorts.

1051
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,997
"All sorts."

1052
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,951
- You know Shakespeare?
- Not personally.

1053
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,759
- I read it at school.
- At school.

1054
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:01,552
- Well, I have the complete works here.
- They're a lovely set, aren't they?

1055
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:04,359
Yes, they are very well bound.

1056
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:10,397
- They're embossed in gold.
- Mmm, really nice.

1057
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,959
Sue...

1058
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,678
Very nice.

1059
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,676
Part of our heritage.

1060
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:37,998
'Course, they're not something
you can actually read.

1061
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:42,676
- Your house is a lot older than ours.
- Yes.

1062
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:49,359
- Sue, 1936, yes?
- I'm not sure. I know it was built before the war.

1063
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,957
- I thought so.
- (ANGE) There's nothing wrong with an old house.

1064
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:59,399
There's some quite nice ones.
I like old and I like new.

1065
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,391
I like the Tudor houses...

1066
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,630
- All right, Sue?
- Fine, thanks.

1067
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,394
- You don't feel sick again?
- No.

1068
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,437
- No?
- It's settling.

- All right, Tone?

1070
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,510
Yes, thank you.

1071
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:17,592
- Great.
- Do you know the Belvedere Hotel?

1072
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,117
- Yes, I do.
- Originally on that site stood a Tudor mansion.

1073
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:24,874
- Did there?
- The official residence...

1074
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,678
- Another drink?
- Ta.

1075
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:30,150
...They owned...
- Angela, another drink?

1076
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,312
I've seen to the drinks, thank you, Beverly.

1077
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:37,951
Sorry, it's just that I can't hear
through two brick walls.

1078
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,869
Yes, it was all part of the Belvedere Estate.

1079
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:48,157
Laurence, would you turn that record UP, please?

1080
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:52,154
How can we hold a conversation
with that racket blaring out?

1081
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:56,950
We're not here to hold conversations,
we're here to enjoy ourselves.

1082
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,998
Beverly, we are enjoying ourselves.

1083
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,833
We're enjoying this conversation.

All right, Laurence, all right.

1088
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,917
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right.

1089
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:54,390
We're all getting a little bit merry, aren't we?

1090
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,030
It's nice for us to have a bit of a break.

1091
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:01,237
Since the move, we've hardly been out.

1092
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:04,915
- Where are you going, Sue?
- I was going to the toilet.

1093
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:08,311
- Not feeling sick again?
- No, I'm fine.

1094
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,869
- Shall I come with you?
- No, thank you.

1095
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:15,630
You see, Sue's been vomiting up her gin.

1096
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:20,032
While you were away,
I had to take her to the lavatory.

1097
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:35,111
- Ange, shall we have a little dance?
- Yeah, it would be nice!

1098
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,317
- Tone, do you fancy a dance?
- Yeah, I don't mind.

1099
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,472
There's no room to dance in here, Beverly.

1100
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:47,749
Laurence, if I wanted somebody to put
a damper on the idea, I'd have asked you first.

1101
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,717
OK?

1102
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,958
Ange, give us a hand to move the couch.

1103
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:59,271
(LAURENCE) I'll sort that.
(TONY) I'll do that.

1104
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:04,155
- I'll take this corner.
- You just sit down.

1105
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,438
Cheers, Tone.

1106
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,196
- Got it, Laurence?
- Yes.

1107
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:16,357
- For Christ's sake!
- Don't interfere, Beverly!

1108
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:22,155
- Ready?
- Where do you want it?

1109
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,197
Where do you want it?

1110
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:27,511
For God's sake, just move it back there, please.

1111
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,318
Just back?

1112
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,032
Got this fantastic record I'll play, Ange.
Hang on a sec.

1113
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,149
Now, this record, Ange,

1114
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,198
it turns my husband on.

1115
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,518
And when he hears it,
he cannot resist my charms.

1116
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:07,950
- They're still enjoying themselves down there.
- Yeah.

1117
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:10,588
What were they getting up to?

1118
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,312
- Nothing much.
- Ready, Ange?

- Dance with Beverly.

1122
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,314
Perhaps Laurence would like a dance.

1123
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,994
No, I don't think he would, actually.

1124

Come on, Tone. Have a dance.

1125

- All right, Sue?
- Fine, thanks.

1126
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,079
Yeah.

1127
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:45,711
- You don't mind me mauling your husband?
- No, go ahead!

1128
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:54,556
- Dance with Laurence.
- No, I can't.

1129
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,280
'Course you can. Get up and dance!

1130

Don't worry, Ange, you're quite safe
with Laurence. He won't rape you.

1131

- Do you wanna dance?
- Surely, if you'd like to.

- I'm not very good at these slow dances.
- No.

I'm better at this sort.

- D'you wanna dance with us?
- No, thank you.

- I'm fine, really.

- Thanks.

- Laurence was shaking my hand.
- Oh, was he?

01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,873
Christ, he'll be shaking mine next!

Now, who's for another drink?

- Ange?
- Please.

- No.

- Ange, give us a light, would you, please?
- Mmm.

1183
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,199
Cheers.

1184
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:45,990
Once you've had one cigarette,
you want to keep on smoking.

1185
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,991
This is it, yeah.

1186
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:53,991
- What sort of work do you do?
- I'm in computers.

1187
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,276
He's an operator.

1188
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,837
- Still play football, Tone?
- No...

1189
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:04,279
He gave it up when he was 20.
He plays for the firm's team, though.

1190
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:08,672
- But he's much better than the others.
- I've only played twice.

1191
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:11,229
He looks so funny in his shorts!

1192
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:16,548
- Why did you give it up?
- Things didn't work out.

1193
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:21,271
- You've got footballer's legs, though.
- Has he?

1194
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,157
Have you? Let's have a little look.

1195
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,508
Ooh, yes, so he has!

1196
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,513
I like footballers' legs.
Nice and muscly, aren't they?

1197
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,191
I can't stand blokes
with skinny legs, Ange. Can you?

1198
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,920
Puts you off, doesn't it?

1199
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:56,956
- Talking of Paris, Sue, do you like art?
- Yes.

1200
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,271
So do I, but Beverly doesn't.

1201
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:04,353
You know that Paris
is the centre of the art world.

1202
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,080
- Do you like Van Gogh?
- Yes.

1203
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,439
- This is a Van Gogh.
- Yes.

1204
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:16,470
They called him a Post Impressionist,
but to my mind he was more of a Symbolist.

1205
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:19,473
- Do you like the Impressionists?
- Yes.

1206
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:23,076
Oh, you do. That's good. That's fine.

1207
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,719
Fine.

1208
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,080
- You all right, Tone?
- Yeah.

1209
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:37,876
Of course, you know Van Gogh,
he was a very unstable man.

1210
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:42,110
Not only did he cut his ear off
and leave it in a brothel,

1211
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:45,352
he also ate paint and he shot himself.

1212
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:49,195
Thank you, Laurence,
we don't want all the gory details.

1213
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,396
I am talking to Sue!

1214
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,356
And Sue is interested in these things!

1215
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,710
Now, this is a picture of his chair
in the corner of his room at Arles.

1216
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:06,955
It wasn't actually yellow, no. He painted it yellow
because yellow symbolised so much for him.

1217
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,759
- Shall we liven things up?
- (TONY AND ANGE) Yeah.

1218
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,797
- Do you like art?
- Yes.

1219
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:18,953
This is a Lowry.
Did you know his father was an estate agent?

1220
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:22,757
For Christ's sake, Laurence, give it a rest!

1221
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:26,469
- Give what a rest?
- Nobody is interested.

1222
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,471
Oh, yes, they are!

1223
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:33,472
- Oh, no, they're not!
- Do you know something, Beverly?

1224
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:37,315
- You're ignorant!
- Oh, I'm ignorant now, am I?

1225
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,471
Now? You always have been!

1226
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:43,952
It's not a question of ignorance,
Laurence, it's a question of taste.

1227
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:47,112
Taste? What would YOU know about taste?

1228
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:52,400
The trouble with you is if somebody doesn't like
what YOU like, you say they've got no taste.

1229
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,028
- That's rubbish!
- Oh, is it rubbish?

1230
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,670
- Yes!
- Then what about my picture in the bedroom?

1231
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,308
That is cheap, pornographic trash!

1232
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:07,191
Laurence, just because a picture happens
to be erotic, it doesn't mean it's pornographic!

1233
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,237
Shut up, Beverly!

1234
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:14,511
I've got this fabulous picture, right?
It's really beautiful.

1235
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:19,871
I brought it home
and he wouldn't let me put it up in here.

1236
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:24,716
- I had to hang it in the bedroom.
- If I had my way, it would be in the dustbin!

1237
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:29,795
- Well, you're dead from the waist down, anyway!
- Can I see it?

1238
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:31,712
- Do you wanna see it?
- Yes!

1239
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:35,190
Angela's got work in the morning.
We ought to be going.

1240
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,351
- I should go.
- See it another time.

1241
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:41,115
- We don't have to go early, just 'cause of me.
- Sure?

1242
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,953
- I'll be fine.
- She's gotta get up!

1243
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:47,351
- Oh, shut up, Laurence!
- Don't tell me to shut up!

1244
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,954
- Angela, coat!
- It's all right!

1245
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:54,989
- I really think I ought to be going.
- Don't be silly, we haven't had a coffee yet!

1246
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,798
Sit down.

1247
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:01,273
- Beverly!
- We're going soon, anyway.

1248
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:05,877
- Beverly, don't bring that picture down.
- Sod off, Laurence!

1249
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,235
- Beverly!
- Drop dead!

1250
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:12,672
You just can't keep your big mouth shut!

1251
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,751
GET UP!

1252
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,389
Sit down! ...Please.

1253
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:51,636
(MUSIC: BEETHOVEN'S FIFTH SYMPHONY)

1254

Laurence!

1255
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:29,392
- Laurence!
- What's the matter?

1256
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,198
(ANGE) Just a minute!

1257
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:34,716
- Ange, what's wrong with him?
- I don't know yet!

1258
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,758
Tony, help me get him on the floor!

(LAURENCE GASPS FOR AIR)

1260
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:46,759
Get me something for his head.
Get his feet up higher!

1261
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:49,514
- Here you are.
- That's too big.

1262
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,672
- Here you are.
- What's going on?

1263
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,308
What's the matter with him? Laurence.

1264
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:59,792
- What's happened? Has he passed out?
- Tony, could you lift his feet?

1265
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:04,511
Tony, do you mind?
Sue, get him a glass of water, please.

1266
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:07,148
- Laurence, come on.
- No, leave him.

1267
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,356
- Leave him!
- Leave him!

1268
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:15,390
- Angela, he happens to be my husband, OK?
- We've got to let him breathe.

1269
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:19,633
- He is breathing, for Christ's sake!
- Get an ambulance, don't sit there!

1270
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,472
- Ambulance?
- Yes!

1271
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:24,552
OK, Angela, what is the matter with him?

1272
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:27,359
- I think it's a heart attack!
- Where's the phone?

1273
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,988
- Heart attack?
- Where's your phone?

1274
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:32,310
Under the bar, Tony.

Oh, Christ, Ange, are you sure?

1276
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:40,477
- He hasn't got false teeth, has he?
- Of course he hasn't got false teeth!

- Ange, his hands are going freezing!
- Get him something to keep him warm.

01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,310
- A blanket?
- Yes.

- Yes.

- Leave him, he's got to lie still!

- Ambulance!

- Tell them it's urgent.
- Turn that bleedin' record off!

- (MUSIC STOPS)
- (TONY) That's right, yeah.

1290
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:36,229
- Ange, listen to that noise he's making!
- An ambulance, please!

1291
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,551
- Ange...
- What's the house number? What's the number?

1292
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:42,439
- 13.
- 13 Richmond Road.

1293
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,079
Yeah.

1294
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:46,595
- Angela.
- A heart attack.

1295
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:51,356
- Angela, I told him this would happen.
- 5-0-3-9-0-4-1.

1296
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:55,798
I said, "Laurence,
you're gonna have a heart attack."

1297
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:58,599
But he wouldn't listen to me, Ange.

1298
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:05,279
But I never thought it would happen at this age.
I thought it would be when he was 50 or 60.

1299
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,512
- (LABOURED BREATHING)
- Oh, Christ!

1300
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:14,071
- Sue, listen to that noise he's making.
- Is there anything we can do?

1301
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:16,435
We must just wait for the ambulance.

1302
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:21,390
What happens when they get him to the hospital?
Will they give him oxygen to revive him?

1303
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:26,031
- They've got everything in the ambulance.
- Yeah? Great.

1304
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:40,798
- Sue, drop of brandy?
- No, thank you.

1305
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,439
- Tone?
- No, thanks.

1306
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:45,751
- Angela, do you want a drop...
- No.

1307
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,271
Now, listen to me, Ange.

1308
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,759
Ange...

1309
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:55,675
Would it be a good idea
if I put a dab of brandy on his lips?

1310
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,718
- No!
- I don't mean for him to drink...

1311
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:04,072
- How about a dab of water?
- No, he must just lie still.

1312
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:10,190
- Or shall I get a cold flannel and lay it across...
- He'll be OK if he lies still!

1313
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:15,832
- The thing is, Ange, I'm very fond of him, I am.
- Keep that cigarette out of his face!

1314
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,516
- All right, Tony, lay off me, please!
- You're flicking ash all over him!

1315
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:24,195
- That'll do from you as well!
- Calm down!

1316
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:29,753
It's all right for you.
Your husband isn't lying here with a heart attack!

1317
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:33,674
- Angela, is there nothing we can do?
- No, just sit down.

1318
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:36,035
(WHEEZING)

1319
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,269
- It's my fault, isn't it?
- No.

1320
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:45,998
I know it is.

1321
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:52,034
But I didn't mean to upset him tonight, Sue.
I wouldn't do that.

1322
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:56,472
But he is argumentative with me, Sue.

1323
01:34:56,640 --> 01:35:01,031
When he starts shouting at me,
I can't help but shout back.

1324
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,998
But I didn't mean to upset him tonight.

1325
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:09,518
You see, the thing is, Ange, when
he started going on about his pictures,

1326
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:12,558
I should have kept quiet, but I couldn't.

1327
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:17,998
I shouldn't have brought that picture down,
'cause he hates it.

1328
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,189
Christ, this is ridiculous!

1329
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:24,079
Tony, where's that ambulance?

1330
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:29,954
- Ange, shall we give them a ring again?
- Beverly, we've only just phoned them!

1331
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:35,399
I know we've only just phoned them, Sue,
but you don't know what goes on in these places.

1332
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:40,839
They could have taken the address down wrong.
Or they could have got the wrong road.

1333
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:46,630
- Tony, just phone and check what's going on.
- Shall I ring again, Ange?

1334
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:50,588
Never mind her.
I know she's a nurse but I'm his bloody wife!

1335
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:53,228
- All right!
- Get on that phone!

1336
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:59,834
- How is he?
- He's all right.

1337
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,676
Mind you, Sue... he's brought this on himself.

1338
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,956
I'm sorry, Sue, but he has.

1339
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:20,231
Sue, if you knew the number of times I have
pleaded with him to take a day off and rest,

1340
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:24,916
and he wouldn't listen to me, Sue,
he wouldn't take any notice of me.

1341
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:30,313
And do you know why? Because basically
he is stubborn and pig-headed.

1342
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:31,799
Ambulance!

1343
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:36,750
- Er, 5-0-3-9-0-4-1.
- 13 Richmond Road, tell 'em, Tony.

1344
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:41,072
- It's off Raven's Way, make sure they know.
- That's right, yeah.

1345
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:45,232
- Hello. We phoned for an ambulance earlier...
- Tony!

1346
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:49,791
- We've waited 10 minutes and there's a man...
- SHUT UP!

1347
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:53,555
- BE QUIET!
- I beg your pardon, Sue?

1348
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:58,316
- Will you shut up for a minute?
- Look, I'm telling you now.

1349
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:02,917
- It's my house and if you don't like it, piss off!
- Shut up, please!

1350
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:07,358
Sorry. 13 Richmond Road.

1351
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:17,275
5-0-3-9-0-4-1.

1352
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:21,390
That's right, yeah.

1353
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:24,239
Ta.

1354
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,718
Thank you.

1355
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,749
- What did they say?
- It's on its way.

1356
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,790
(MUSIC THUDS OUT FROM PARTY)

1357
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,834
For Christ's sake, Sue,
would you go and tell Abigail?

1358
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,994
- It's not my fault they're making a row!
- I know, but she's your daughter.

1359
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:57,436
- I can't help that. Can I use the phone?
- Yes.

1360
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:01,552
(ANGE) No, you're all right. Just lie still.

1361
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:05,429
- Is he coming round a bit?
- Yes. Keep still.

1362
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,556
Laurence!

1363
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,153
Laurence...

1364
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:11,914
It's Beverly speaking.

1365
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,878
Now, listen to me, Laurence. Look...

1366
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:18,032
Laurence, I'm just putting my cigarette down.

1367
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:21,158
We don't wanna blow smoke in your face.

1368
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:24,474
Now, Laurence, listen to me.

1369
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,392
Laurence...

1370
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:31,873
You're not well, but we're taking you
to hospital. Listen to me, Laurence...

1371
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,996
Laurence, I promise I'm not gonna leave you.

1372
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:39,197
I'm gonna stay with you all the time.

1373
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:43,273
Listen to me, Laurence.
Angela is looking after you.

1374
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:46,432
You'll be all right. There's no need to worry.

1375
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,233
Ange...

1376
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:58,113
- Ange, what are you doing?
- Can I speak to Abigail?

1377
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:01,590
Abigail! ...Abigail Lawson.

1378
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:11,831
- Tony, can you hold my hair out of my face?
- Eh?

1379
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,319
Tony!

1380
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:31,639
Oh, Tony!

1381
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,598
Oh, Tony!

1382
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:38,309
- Tony! Tony!
- What's the matter?

1383
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:41,472
You haven't got cramp again? Come here.

1384
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:43,471
Give us your leg.

1385
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:46,552
Stretch it! STRETCH IT!

1386
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:52,279
Abigail, it's Mummy here.

1387
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,599
Abigail?

1388
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:56,716
Abigail!
