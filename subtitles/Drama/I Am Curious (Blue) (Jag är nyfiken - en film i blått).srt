I don't feel very good
Nothing's looking as it should

2
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:26,149
Dad, Mom, Grandma, Grandpa don't know
who they brought into the world

3
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:31,491
I want to be someone
Do what no one else has done

4
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:35,393
So our sweet name will be
remembered by posterity

5
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:39,905
I like my own sweet name

6
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:45,301
I like the touch of fame

7
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:50,412
Sweden can be really good
Fix things up as they all should

8
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,752
Germans, Russians, Americans
We'll set them a good example

9
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:59,655
Of social democracy
Of a mixed economy

10
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,729
So Sweden's sweet name will be
remembered by posterity

11

Reform the world

12
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:13,436
Just from little Sweden

13
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:18,337
So we get well-known,you see

Buy our film!! Buy it!!

16
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:41,364
The only film in two versions.
One yellow, one blue.

17
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:45,734
Buy the yellow, buy the blue.
Buy our film, 'cause there are two.

18
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,535
The same picture, yet different.

19
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,768
- Nice and ugly!!
- The yellow film.

20
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,242
- Big and small!!
- The blue film.

21
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:57,976
This is the blue version.
The blue version...

22
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,209
Madeleine, four, take three.

23
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:05,587
- What school did you graduate from?
- The Sigtuna private school.

24
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:08,819
- In the crown prince's class?
- No.

25
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,531
- You seem big-headed. Are you?
- No.

26
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,793
- The French Lyceum.
- For how long?

27
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,097
All my life, since I was seven.

28
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,296
- The French Lyceum.
- And after that?

29
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:25,036
Language studies in Switzerland.

30
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,315
I often go abroad, to France.

31
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,815
- You like France, do you?
- I love France.

32
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:38,251
- What do you do?
- I study French at the university here.

33
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,018
Look at me.

34
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,394
Now look into the camera.

35
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:47,023
BEWARE OF MERITOCRACY

36

who the crown prince's girlfriend is?

''Maj Hultén, Teacher, Age 34''

38
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,877
Many women find it difficult
to reach a climax in ordinary coitus.

39
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,243
The position doesn't matter.

40
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:06,341
On top, on the side,
sitting or whatever.

41
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:12,083
Just about any position is possible -

42
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,217
well, perhaps not while running.

43
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:20,665
But there are many ways,

44
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:25,067
just like for any other
physical activity.

45
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:30,199
Many people think
it's due to psychological reasons

46
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:35,747
that younger women
don't reach a climax.

47
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:40,410
Subconscious or even somewhat
conscious conflicts

48
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,522
cause them to forbid themselves
to reach a climax.

49
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,986
- That it's not ''nice.''
- Exactly.

50
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:52,495
- That it's not ''nice.''
- That's what I think.

51
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,226
Most girls think like that.

52
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,838
Oh, please!!!

53
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:11,382
You know how you'll look naked
if you just eat and eat.

A BLUE FI LM

59
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,059
Marie,you had a question?

60
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:30,431
If homosexual women have sex,
is that also mutual onanism?

61
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:34,996
Yes, the word onanism, masturbation,

62
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:39,840
means self-satisfaction.

63
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:45,407
It's a bit difficult to call something
''mutual self-satisfaction.''

64
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:50,184
But it does describe what it is.

65
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:56,918
They caress each other's sex organs

66
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:00,555
so they both reach a climax.

67
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:07,362
Before, I hardly dared touch a girl
in case she'd think I was a lesbian.

68
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,635
The word lesbian is clear, then?

69
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:16,310
It means homosexual woman.

70
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:21,353
- I've never felt that, but-
- Never?

71
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,287
Do you touch people a lot?

72
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,689
Have you been
to a girls'boarding school

73
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,922
where it's even more

74
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,430
sensitive about homosexuality?

75
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:43,332
It's not the same at this school.
We go out, we meet boys.

76
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,207
It's not the same.

77
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,507
But take girls at boarding schools
in Switzerland,

78
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,310
with nuns chaperoning them.

79
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,657
- How much, then?
- Five thousand crowns.

80
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,589
Damn good it isn't ten!

81
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,838
We'll have to write an IOU.
- Cheapskate.

82
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:52,434
- And you'll have to pay it off.
- Cheapskate.

83
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,843
Hey, can we get going?
Damn, he can't hear.

84
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,710
We can't wait for Ahlstedt.

85
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,249
Where the hell is he?

86

At Sandrew they make good films

88
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,268
Hell's bells!

89
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,330
It's embarrassing! You're making
a film on the Swedish class-system,

90
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,037
but you buy a black-market apartment!
- Look who's talking!

91
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,911
You just want it good for yourself!.
- Honey.

92
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:37,315
Isn't my place okay, then?
- Yes, but I want my own place.

93
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,481
Why?

94
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:44,723
- Hi. Am I late?
- Yes, we said ten to.

95
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:48,300
- Isn't it that now?
- It's a bit later.

96
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,696
Sit down, for Christ's sake.

97

Screen test : Börje Ahlstedt.
Director : Hortlund.

98
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,708
Action!

- You're the sales director
- Yes, I'm head

of the company's sales and servicing
in Stockholm.

101
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:20,263
And head of Bergengren Ltd.

102
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,327
Yes!!!

103
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,500
- You have a driver's license?
- Oh, yes!

104
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,877
- It's a basic requirement.
- Of course. I'm a good driver.

105
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,212
Are you interested in cars?

106
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:43,721
I like sports cars.
All kinds of cars.

107
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,383
How old are you?

108
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,154
- How old are you?
- I'm 28.

109

You get a love scene with Lena.

110
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,164
A love scene with consequences.

111
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,959
What kind of consequences?

112
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,029
I don't know.
I'll think of something.

113
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:07,042
- This Madeleine!!!
- An upper-class chick.

114
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:12,641
You're really hot for her.
Then you have something with Lena.

115
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,922
You think you'll be
a successful salesman?

116
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,492
Yes, I believe in my personality.

117
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:26,293
Yes. 1200. Then I'll make
350 crowns for every car.

118
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,736
- Can I get paid tax-free?
- No, that's not possible.

119

The term tax-free doesn't exist
these days, sorry to say.

Take a look.

141
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:30,451
Imagine that's your mom and dad
and you're very young.

142
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:36,321
A tiny kid, lying there listening
to them talking about you.

143
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:41,389
You can't hear what they're saying,
but it's obviously about you.

144
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,434
The radio is on, too.
A popular song.

145
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:56,976
One your mom liked a lot
and went around humming

146
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,450
before she disappeared.

147
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,756
- But why did she run off?
- I don't know.

148
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:12,426
She couldn't take it any longer.
- But to leave me like that!

149
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:18,536
It had to do with her nerves.
Maybe she had a nervous breakdown.

150
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:26,643
I think she was in a mental hospital
for a while when you were little.

151
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:32,813
You know, she came from
the country, from Västergötland.

From a little place
called Lundsbrunn.

156
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,504
And longed for her.

157
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:23,692
May I ask you a few questions
for a survey for the Nyman Institute?

158
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,395
You have to branch out on your own.

159
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,592
Newspapers work too fast
and can't be trusted.

160
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:34,162
Science works far too slowly
and gets no results.

161
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,131
So you have to branch out
on your own.

162
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:44,278
Has the leveling of income gone
as far as it can in Sweden?

163
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,817
As far as it can?

164
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:53,757
No, but I don't think it'll go much
further in the near future.

165
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:58,887
Did you know that income leveling
here has stood still for 20 years?

166
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,057
No? It's true nevertheless.

167
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:06,763
Guess how it'll be in 20 years.
The income gap will be even bigger.

168
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,397
But not many believed me.

169
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,677
Especially not among the students.

170
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,576
They thought it was natural as hell

171
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:19,708
that those with a head for studies
should earn a lot more than others.

172
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:27,783
No storms yet
in our minds do dwell

173
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,155
BEWARE OF

174
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,227
They didn't fear

175
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,891
MERITOCRACY
an educational welfare state

176
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:39,300
that rewards the bookworms
and forgets everyone else.

177
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,772
I warn you::

178
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,645
Emphasizing education
will sharpen class boundaries!!

179
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,987
Some people were born
with limited prospects.

180
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,781
They're lost and awkward.

181
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,122
They lack the brains to study.

182
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:08,097
Others have a very different start.
They have the chance to study.

183
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,829
They have parents who encourage
and push them on.

184
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:17,773
Should they be rewarded for that?
Should they get better jobs?

185
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,606
Better wages?
A better position in society?

186
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,648
Is that right and fair?

187
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:31,287
Yes, I suppose so.
It's a question of performance.

188
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:37,124
Yeah, but you can't help being born
with a less-than-brilliant mind.

189
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:41,565
He shouldn't have to suffer for it.
But the thing is, does he?

190
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,966
Either I hadn't made myself clear,

191
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:50,574
or he didn't make any major
demands on justice and equality.

192
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,637
He shouldn't have to suffer for it.
But the thing is, does he?

193
00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:00,549
I got the strangest results
from the workers.

194
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:06,149
They seemed brainwashed, like they'd
not heard the term ''class society.''

195
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,589
Class society?

196
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,323
Class society?

197
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,327
How do you answer that?

198
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:21,395
No, I don't think so.
I think everything's okay.

199
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,872
You can't ask for more.

200
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,467
UNAWARE

201
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,478
No, I don't think so.

202
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,280
- I don't think so.
- You don't?

203
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:41,823
A guy from the Swedish Labor Federation
said it was due to Per Albin,

204
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,259
a prime minister during my childhood.

205
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:48,258
He duped the workers with dreams.

206
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:53,964
They're in a coma and won't wake up
even if the right wing takes power.

207
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,202
THE SWEDISH CLASS SOCI ETY

208
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,972
What gives a really low wage
in Sweden?

209
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,940
Being over 50, with only elementary
school, and doing manual labor.

210
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:12,217
Preferably a woman,
in a rural area. Then it's tough.

211
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:17,125
14,000 is enough for a woman,
at least in rural areas.

212
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:21,996
- Women should earn less than men?
- Absolutely.

213
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:27,232
CONTEMPT OF WOMEN
SECRET: OPEN:

214
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:33,040
- Where in Northern Sweden?
- Hammerdal, in Jämtland.

215
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,680
- And what's your occupation?
- Short-order cook.

216
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,315
- What education do you have?
- Elementary school.

217
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,424
Let me try and guess your income.

218
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:52,930
It must be around 1 1 , 000.

219
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,498
That's right.

220
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,967
- I'm from Blekinge.
- Another short-order cook?

221
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,698
No, I'm a teacher.

222
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,606
- What level?
- Elementary.

223
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,974
I earn 25,000.

224
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,912
Textile worker.
Let me guess.

225
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:16,218
- Say 16, 17, 18,000?
- Yes, 16-17,000.

226
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:22,692
- High school teacher.
- A fine profession, isn't it?

227
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:28,664
- Well, yes, I enjoy it.
- And you make good money too?

228
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,964
Fifty thousand?
- About that, yes.

229
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,504
- An architect.
- From Stockholm?

230
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:44,138
You make a very good income.
A gross income of about -

231
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,342
About 100,000.

232
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,353
You look energetic. Perhaps you do
a little extra work on the side?

233
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:57,952
I do. That's another 50,000.

234
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:02,556
Fifty thousand?
So you're up around 150,000?

235
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,669
Congratulations!

236
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:09,263
Would you please
stand over there by yourself.

237
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,866
I think we really must
do something here.

238
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,174
Don't the five of you

239
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:20,684
and the whole public
think we should give

240
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:26,190
a great big cheer for that
good old Swedish class society.

241
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:36,230
Swedes are moving away
from the church, thank God.

242
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:41,397
So why get married and buried in
church and have their kids confirmed?

243
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,174
I did a survey.

244
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,147
42% : need for something solemn.

245
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,718
21% : keeping up with the Joneses.

246
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:58,653
17% : spellbound.
8% : fear of God.

247
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:04,062
For Swedes, sufficient reason
to take part in religious ceremonies!!

248
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,222
Goddamn it!!

249
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,750
CHURCH WEDDINGS ARE HYPOCRISY

250
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,716
CONFIRMATION IS HYPOCRISY

251
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,492
CHURCH + BOURGEOISIE =
UNHOLY ALLIANCE

252
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,563
THE ONLY WAY TO GO
INTO CHURCH IS FEET FIRST

253
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:52,601
- Should we separate church and state?
- Yes, that's a good idea.

254
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,872
- What political party are you?
- I'm a Social Democrat.

255
00:21:56,014 --> 00:22:00,280
- And yet you don't think so?
- No, it's too risky.

256
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:06,324
The church might really wake up!
Let them stay asleep.

257
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,187
PARISH REGISTRAR'S OFFICE

258
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,296
- Should we separate church and state?
- Yes.

259
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,988
Why?

260
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:19,335
The state doesn't want
to appear Christian,

261
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,202
so church and state
don't belong together.

262
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:26,243
For example, this office has
nothing to do with the church.

263
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:32,106
What's the point in my sitting here
copying birth certificates?

264
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:37,048
All this talk about reaching people -
it's just nonsense.

265
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:43,128
A few years ago there was a big fuss
about having female priests.

266
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:48,198
There still is.
But not among ordinary people.

267
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:53,737
It's among highly educated
theologians.

268
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,832
This movement within the state church
called ''Rally The Church'':

269
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:01,036
Have you noticed
what they're yakking about?

270
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:05,514
Female priests.
Abortion. Sex education.

271
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,652
Aren't they fuck-fixated?

272
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:13,523
Is it good or bad that the church
is losing its power in Sweden?

273
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,558
Good.

274
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,457
- Don't you believe in God?
- No.

275
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,761
- Have you left the state church?
- No.

276
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:25,769
- Why not?
- Plain laziness.

277
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:31,172
- Are you confirmed? Baptized?
- Both.

278
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,743
When I was confirmed,
I was religious.

279
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,580
- How did it go?
- Hi, Lena.

280
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:52,062
- I only got to borrow fifty.
- That's nothing! So what's next?

281
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,222
We'll talk about that later.

282
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,496
Lena, I've got myself a new home.

283
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:01,362
It's fantastic.
Come over and take a look.

284
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,807
I was embarrassed
that I hadn't recognized Bim.

285
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,907
God, I mean... Bim!!

286
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:22,320
I often slept in his chair up at
'Stockholms Tidningen' while he wrote.

287
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:29,395
Sometimes we'd both sleep there
before he went home to Bim.

288
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:36,770
He'd toiled for the socialist press
all his life, after political training.

289
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,244
For every paper that the
Labor Federation had bought up

290
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,808
and closed down.

291
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:48,448
Finally the bastards put
'Stockholms Tidningen' to death. Hell!!

292
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:54,152
- How much did you pay?
- Ten thousand.

293
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:58,058
- For all of this?
- It was all of my Labor Federation grant.

294
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:04,467
When I first met Hans,
he was working on a future project.

295
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,700
He wanted to shake
the movement up

296
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:13,608
and make the May Day demonstration
of 1974 something wholly new.

297
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,074
FRATERNIZATION!!!
SABOTAGE!!! NONCOOPERATION

298
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:30,424
The May Day demonstration was
a manifestation for nonviolence.

299
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:34,225
An unusually large crowd
took part or watched.

300
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:38,826
A sign of renewal within the
labor movement, said the organizers.

301
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:42,031
Nonviolence! Nonviolence!

302
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:50,573
Foreign Minister Torsten Nilsson
addressed a crowded stadium::

303
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:55,142
''We need thorough knowledge
of the techniques of nonviolence,

304
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:58,882
indoctrination of its 'catechism, '

305
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,652
and transformed military training.

306
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:06,228
We must not underestimate
the problems,

307
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:12,166
or make little of the risk
of reprisals by an occupying force.

308
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:18,300
The fact that loss of life
for us and the enemy

309
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,436
would be much greater
in conventional warfare

310
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,916
motivates our wish to introduce
new defense methods in an era

311
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:32,479
when society's development makes
military weapons seem antiquated.''

312
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:07,050
The earth is a pillow

313
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,924
Nice and soft and warm

314
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:23,770
There will Lena safely sleep

315
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:33,375
Animals and mankind dream

316
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,648
Silent in the arms of the night

317
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,919
It's the altitude.

318
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,919
I just can't.

319
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:13,702
Hans, what's the matter?

320
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,077
Why can't you?

321
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:21,617
Too much going on in my head.
I can't relax.

322
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,792
What are you thinking about then?

323
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,259
Is it Bim?

324
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,024
Yes.

325
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:40,903
- How strange you've become.
- You think so?

326
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,137
Why did you move out to the boat?

327
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:53,039
You talk so much about the group,
and about group feelings.

328
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:57,446
How the hell can you
isolate yourself out there with Bim?

329
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:06,060
Does it work out?
- Yes, it's so damned good with her.

330
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:12,365
- But are you happy with Bim?
- Sure. We yell and fight.

331
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,167
Then we make love.
- You yell and fight?

332
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:21,744
After that, it works fine.

333
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,446
But I'm no sadist.

334
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:36,359
Hell, that's not it!
Give me a break!

335
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,089
Yeah, but he's been impotent.

336
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:43,964
You can't play him as a wimp.

337
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:49,005
He'll end up a whining brat.
There has to be some power in the guy.

338
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:55,708
There can't be any power
in this scene. He's a total failure.

339
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:59,715
He's worked on the girl all night!
- All night?

340
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,684
A whole bloody night and he fails.

341
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:06,382
There's no power there!

342
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:11,690
He had that power years ago,
like we said!

343
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:15,430
Hey, he's Lena's intellectual father!

344
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:20,402
He's given her all the ideas
on nonviolence and the class society.

345
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:24,669
He's the one who educated her
and got her turned on about this stuff.

346
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:29,170
You screw up the whole situation!

347
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:34,445
Why ask me to make him impotent?

348
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:38,010
That wasn't my idea.
It was your idea.

349
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,681
I didn't go home with Vilgot.

350
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:16,951
I wandered around,
not knowing where to go.

351
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:24,026
All of a sudden
I started thinking about Börje,

352
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:29,201
and all the fun we'd had
in drama school

353
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:33,635
before Marie got pregnant
and they got married.

354
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:42,783
Then I just hoped time would fly
so I could phone him.

355
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:47,458
I was terrified
Marie would answer the phone.

356
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:49,923
Madeleine!

357
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,892
- Do you come here often?
- No!

358
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:58,969
- First time?
- Yes.

359
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:03,907
I go to Cecil's. No, not just go.

360
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:07,842
I have fun at Cecil's.

361
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:11,745
- Are you here often?
- I'm a regular.

362
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:15,045
- Ever been to Lorry?
- No.

363
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,552
-Jambalaya?
- No.

364
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:24,355
- Is Sweden a class society?
- I suppose so, to some extent.

365
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:30,526
Some people, like here,
see this place as something special,

366
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,728
when perhaps it isn't.

367
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,398
The name scares some off.
Just as well.

368
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:41,805
- I'm in advertising.
- Is Sweden a class society?

369
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,246
A class society?
No, I don't think so.

370
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:49,285
- Definitely not.
- So we have total equality?

371
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:54,689
- Yes, quite shocking.
- A shocking equality?

372
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:59,693
- So we shouldn't change anything?
- Definitely not.

373
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:04,091
Do you know who the crown prince's
current girlfriend is?

374
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,073
- I'm not the least interested.
- No?

375
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:16,079
Is sex the greatest joy in life?
- No, that's very-

376
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,247
What's the word?

377
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:32,722
- Do you have problems with Swedish?
- Yes, I just arrived yesterday. Sorry.

378
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:36,197
- Were you abroad?
- I live abroad.

379
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,268
- Where?
- In Switzerland.

380
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:48,371
Those who don't work
shouldn't live off those who do.

381
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,243
So that's a class society, then?

382
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:55,410
There's too much welfare support.

383
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:02,751
People laze around and get lots
of benefits. Those who work pay for it!

384
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:14,905
Damn it, it's all happening!
They want me and Marie to play the leads!

385
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,397
What kind of play?

386
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:22,502
An American hit.
Success, money, laughter.

387
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:26,944
A chance like that, of course -

388
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,549
Exactly. But your film!!!

389
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:35,219
You mentioned a love scene with Lena.
With consequences.

390
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,760
Yes, a love scene
with consequences.

391
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:42,662
Of course, a love scene without
consequences would be pointless.

392
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:46,159
What is a lawyer's annual income?

393
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:50,536
From almost nothing
to a couple of hundred thousand.

394
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:55,378
Then he pays 80% in taxes.

395
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,172
It's pretty fair that taxes
are as high as they are.

396
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:05,244
But a restaurant worker, for instance,

397
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,687
earns so many times less,

398
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,695
though the work is hard.
Is that fair?

399
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:13,791
No, it's not fair.

400
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:19,531
When I worked in a mine
or on a farm,

401
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,801
I paid lower income tax.

402
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:28,004
I worked more then but had less left,
even after lower taxes,

403
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,808
than now, when I work less.

404
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,713
Though people say I work hard.

405
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:40,580
I have more left over now,
and much more satisfying work.

406
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:46,630
- Can't we do something about it?
- You can do a lot about things.

407
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:52,725
It's all dynamics. We always revert
to differences and distinctions.

408
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,940
Madeleine! Hurry up.

409
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,710
We're leaving, Madeleine!

410
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:27,501
He's changed his mind again!
We're leaving town for two months.

411
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:32,474
- Hell, no. You and I have to get together.
- I know. But how?

412
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:37,914
How can I get away?
- Say you're staying with your mom.

413
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,882
I've used that excuse too often.

414
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,885
What the hell will you say, then?

415
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:52,624
- I have to go in now.
- But two months!

416
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:01,197
- What do I ask them now?
- Same thing.

417
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:08,712
- The IOU's fixed. I withdrew 5,000.
- Great.

418
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:13,013
But your mom will have to co-sign.

419
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:16,712
Then I have to go and see her.

420
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:22,191
I'll do it before we leave town.
I haven't seen her for a while.

421
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,361
Happy now you'll be getting
your own place?

422
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,554
Sure.

423
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,264
Go back to sleep now.

424
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:12,733
Be good for daddy.

425
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:21,110
I really messed up
on that screen test.

426
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,107
If he says he wants me
in the film, I'll say,

427
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:31,218
''No, thanks. Not interested.''

428
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:36,916
He can be sure of that!
- But he's counting on you.

429
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,654
He is?

430
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,757
We talked about our scenes last night.

431
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:49,572
- Last night? In his bed?
- Yeah, I'm living there.

432
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:52,574
- You can move.
- If I can borrow the money.

433
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:56,976
- Money, money, money!
- An apartment costs money.

434
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,381
Damned prostitution everywhere!

435
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:07,486
- Nice if we had a place we could go.
- Everywhere! We can come here.

436
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,119
I don't like being here.

437
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,500
When will Marie be back?
- Not before 12:00.

438
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:22,037
- Sure?
- I promise.

439
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,670
I'm hungry.

440
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:14,143
- Where are you all going?
- Lundsbrunn.

441
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:20,085
- Where's that?
- In Västergötland, I think.

442
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:27,357
- What are you going to do there?
- Search for Mom, he said.

443
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,231
- Who?
- Mom.

444
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:48,647
Suppose I'd got on Mom's trail
that afternoon.

445
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,583
If someone had said,

446
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:55,682
''She's up there at the new school.
She's a cook.

447
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,994
But the school's closed
for the summer. ''

448
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,666
Wrong trail, of course.

449
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:16,038
No, she's not working there at all.

450
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,908
She moved to Borås a year ago.

451
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,353
Now we'll go up, up, up

452
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:36,126
Up on our dawning love's
top, top, top

453
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:40,134
Come, come, come with me

454
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:44,367
She lives in Borås, is remarried,

455
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,876
and has a son of eight or nine
that I've never seen.

456
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,814
My halfbrother.

457
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:00,020
Grandma was a Revivalist,

458
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:04,117
and Mom tried to leave
the church as a girl.

459
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,554
Difficult to understand

460
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:12,396
that she had a hard time
leaving the church.

461
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:18,000
Through lies and deception,
they take Him

462
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,040
and crucify Him,

463
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:26,681
thus proving
the inherent evil of mankind.

464
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:35,487
But instead of letting mankind
suffer its just punishment,

465
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:40,359
Jesus went in His love
and said to his Father,

466
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:45,299
''Father in Heaven, you know me
and you see the evil of mankind.

467
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:49,395
Let me go down to earth.

468
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:51,565
Let me speak to the people,

469
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:55,475
and let me give my life for theirs,

470
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,945
Father, God in Heaven.''

471
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:02,485
And this was God's plan.
He told His Son to go.

472
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:09,626
Thus it happened thatJesus came
unto us bringing His gift of love.

473
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:13,726
We cannot understand this,
but such is the love of God.

474
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:18,662
Even if we cannot understand,
through faith we can experience it

475
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:25,164
and perceive that Jesus
purifies and sanctifies our hearts.

476
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,103
Amen.

477
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:36,653
We shall close by standing up
and praising the Lord.

478
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:42,252
Hallelujah!!! hallelujah!!!

479
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:52,729
Praise be toJesus!

480
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:10,079
God's blessing on you all.
I hope to see you here again soon.

481
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,685
Many other prophecies

482
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,131
also speak of the Day ofJudgment.

483
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:01,631
How people are busy with worldly
things and have turned away from God.

484
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,302
And, well!!!

485
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,102
how depravity prevails.

486
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,611
Like in the days of Noah and Lot.

487
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:14,548
- And depravity prevails now, then?
- Oh, yes. Very much so.

488
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:17,954
Especially in Sweden.
- In what way?

489
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:25,993
You only have to listen to what
they say in the news and so on.

490
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,597
What do you mean by depravity?

491
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:35,232
Immorality, thievishness.

492
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,966
REMEMBRANCE OF SUNDAY SCHOOL

493
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:38,837
What's immorality?

494
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:44,708
The Bible says

495
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:48,808
that all intercourse
outside marriage is immoral.

496
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,786
So you and your fiancée
have never had sex?

497
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:52,820
No.

498
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,948
You're not going to do it
until you're married?

499
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:56,525
No, we won't.

500
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:59,220
- Have you ever?
- No.

501
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,165
- Has your fiancée?
- I hardly think so.

502
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:29,288
Do you desire her in that way?

503
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,296
Of course. That's normal.

504
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:38,556
But since the word of God says

505
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:42,764
that it belongs solely in wedlock,
you comply.

506
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,363
You get the strength to do it.

507
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,436
The two of you
don't indulge in petting?

508
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,674
- No.
- But you kiss and cuddle?

509
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:55,752
- Yes, we do.
- But that's all?

510
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:58,946
Will you have children straightaway?

511
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:03,954
It depends if we can.
Not everyone can.

512
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:09,397
If you're not going to have children,
how are you going to prevent it?

513
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:16,632
- I don't think we'll try to prevent it.
- But if you did want to?

514
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:22,009
You just have to go without.

515
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:24,771
- Complete abstinence, then?
- Yes, exactly.

516
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,847
- No contraceptives?
- No.

517
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:35,617
No rhythm? No coitus interruptus?
Abstinence.

518
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:49,171
Take the population explosion,
for example.

519
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:53,109
The world's getting overpopulated.
How can we stop that?

520
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:56,176
Stop it!!!

521
00:51:56,279 --> 00:52:00,841
I don't think
it's a question of stopping it.

522
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:05,621
As I said before, I don't think
we have a long time left.

523
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:09,451
The Bible says that
the whole world -

524
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:14,462
But shouldn't we do something
about starvation due to overpopulation?

525
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:18,431
- Of course. We'll do what we can.
- Like what?

526
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:22,767
We can send them contraceptives,
teach them birth control.

527
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:28,608
What the world needs most
is the gospel.

528
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:36,419
The gospels don't feed starving
people who have a baby every year.

529
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,385
Think about this:

530
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:43,625
A man who is saved
goes to heaven when he dies.

531
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:47,061
One who is not saved goes to hell.

532
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:51,397
But all those millions

533
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,334
in India and China aren't saved.

534
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:56,462
Are they going to hell?

535
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:06,404
The Bible speaks of heaven and hell
and those with no faith in Jesus.

536
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:11,783
So first they starve to death on earth,
and then they burn in hell!

537
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:17,758
They're children! ''Suffer the children,
for such is the Kingdom of Heaven.''

538
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,963
Jesus said so.

539
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:27,931
- First torment on earth -
- ''Suffer the children'', it says.

540
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:29,933
But!!!

541
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:36,638
Yes, that's a difficult question.

542
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:45,053
I was damned upset afterwards
and thought of all kinds of things.

543
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:51,149
Like the Catholics, they don't give
a damn about social change.

544
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:55,229
And the religions in India,
the caste system!!

545
00:53:56,866 --> 00:54:01,894
Our own state church, that never
made a move for anything important.

546
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:06,333
QUESTION TO HUMANITY:

547
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:10,745
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
WITH ALL THE RELIGIONS?

548
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:16,817
I never went to Borås,
though I was sure I'd find Mom there.

549
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:22,490
Mom, my halfbrother,
and her new man.

550
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,658
I just couldn't do it.

551
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,900
I had some very strange days,

552
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:36,237
floating around in thin air.

553
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:40,768
Anything could have happened.

554
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,311
It was frightening.

555
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:52,050
But nice, too.

556
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,172
They dropped me off
five hours later...

557
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:34,983
near Örebro.

558
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,941
Welcome to our
maximum-security prison,

559
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:01,510
built by order of the Swedish people.

560
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,748
''There is a refuge for all eternity
in His arms. Amen.''

561
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:26,726
I'll have to talk with
the social workers in Strömsund.

562
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:32,366
And in Gäddede,
to find out if there's any room.

563
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:35,562
Yes, do they have room?

564
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:41,036
What will your friends here
at the home say if you move?

565
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:45,444
- They never talk.
- Don't they?

566
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:48,415
It's as if they're deaf and dumb.

567
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,914
They're not exactly lively.

568
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:56,653
I'll have a look at that leg again.

569
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,753
That's the one that hurts, eh?

570
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:04,958
Like the joints are coming apart.

571
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:10,028
''Bertil Wikström,
General Practitioner, Age 45''

572
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:13,241
- The doctor's here.
- Oh, good.

573
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:19,438
- Sleep well last night?
- Better than in twenty million years!

574
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:31,425
- You're interested in prison welfare?
- Quite right.

575
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:34,086
- Do you know Torsten?
- Torsten who?

576
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:36,131
Torsten Eriksson, prison director.

577
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:40,968
The one who built Kumla,
''The Desert Fortress''?

578
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,462
May I come with you to Strömsund?

579
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,403
But you've got so much to load.

580
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:10,462
Torsten was a prison chief
for whom we're very thankful

581
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:14,866
He built Kumla Desert Fort
upon the plains of Närke

582
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:19,135
Strong he built the citadel
Everybody thinks he's swell

583
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:21,073
That's Torsten

584
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:26,542
Running, running away

585
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:31,582
Torsten was a radical
even in the '30s

586
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:35,886
Hens are clucking, roosters crow
''Radicals are ninnies''

587
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:39,951
Wall was built 'bout seven miles high
Faggots seen by TV-eye

588
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:42,656
And Torsten

589
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:47,462
Running, running away

590
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:52,273
Very gentle are the screws
never using axes

591
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:56,573
Out of work, they got the news
Now they're paying taxes

592
01:01:56,679 --> 01:02:00,672
Radicals becoming men
Old gods can be used again

593
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:02,944
By Torsten

594
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:08,019
Running, running away

595
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,926
This institution here -

596
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:16,689
we ought to blow
the damn thing to pieces.

597
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:22,001
- Why?
- I don't believe in prisons.

598
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:25,597
Not huge ones like this.
- What sort of transport is that?

599
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:30,078
Prisoner transport
on their way to me. My patients.

600
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:39,120
What do you think will happen
with prison welfare, then?

601
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:42,556
In the Medical Journal recently

602
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:45,821
a colleague of mine, Karl Grünewald,

603
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:50,956
peeked at the Prison Board's
building plans.

604
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,799
They were scary.

605
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:59,364
Evidently, from a therapy aspect,
the institute that's to take over

606
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:03,343
from Långholmen
is worse than Kumla.

607
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:10,341
And the next prison up
in Härnösand is worse still.

608
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:17,283
The planners apparently have
no knowledge of behavioral science.

609
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:22,730
It's only financial considerations
behind the whole system.

610
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:27,860
They build a factory around it
and think it's the perfect solution.

611
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:30,438
Who's that?

612
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,873
A newcomer. She rents Svartön.

613
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:35,970
What a smashing hat.

614
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:40,475
She reminds me of the actress
Gunnel Broström.

615
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:49,690
Wait here a minute, please.

616
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,662
Peter, dinner's ready.
Bring Johan up with you.

617
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,963
Tell Daddy dinner's ready.

618
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:10,605
Okay, Lena, you can come in now.

619
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:21,949
Women, you know. Why aren't you
allowed women when you're in jail?

620
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,586
Does that seem a crucial problem?

621
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:32,026
Well, it is in the beginning.

622
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:35,501
But it dulls off after a while.

623
01:04:55,424 --> 01:05:00,862
- How's your leg, by the way?
- No trouble, really.

624
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:03,488
Except if I've been carrying
heavy stuff. Then it aches.

625
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:08,227
- Why are you here today, then?
- I'm being released soon.

626
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:12,933
You get problems
with your sleep and nerves.

627
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:17,038
- ''Release fever'' you call it, eh?
- Right.

628
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,211
You brood over such a lot of things.

629
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:25,119
I asked to stay a while,

630
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,923
and I stayed with Bertil and Anna
for two days.

631
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:32,050
I asked around about prison welfare.

632
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:36,587
Nice people. Or stupid, or smart.

633
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:44,495
I got the feeling that no one thought
about what kind of justice we have here.

634
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:47,834
They're pampered too much.

635
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,708
So it's just getting worse.

636
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:54,805
They commit crimes
just to get in here!

637
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:58,409
What was Ulriksfors
in pre-prison days?

638
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:05,123
Originally, a wood pulp factory.
Then it became a textile factory.

639
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:10,498
Does the municipality benefit
from the prison being here?

640
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:14,933
I think it does.

641
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:18,837
They employ
a lot of people from this area.

642
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:24,408
It's unlikely any company
would move here

643
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,846
into those huge premises.

644
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:34,754
- What's a lawyer's annual income?
- I wouldn't know.

645
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:39,022
- Can you guess?
- No.

646
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:42,859
- What do you think?
- They must make quite a bit.

647
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,695
-And a textile worker?
- They don't make much.

648
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:51,500
-A waitress, then? Annually.
- I don't know.

649
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:53,871
It depends on
what town she works in,

650
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:58,509
the type of restaurant, and her age.

651
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:01,276
But it's a lousy job with lousy pay.

652
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:04,878
- Do you have lousy pay?
- Not anymore.

653
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,648
Why not anymore?

654
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:11,284
- Did you go to university?
- Did you?

655
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:14,055
No, the university's in my pocket.

656
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:20,731
- You earn a lot with that education?
- Yes. Didn't you know that?

657
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:30,001
Can you sleep when it never
gets dark at night up here?

658
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:32,637
Yes. I sleep very well.

659
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,913
If you need anything,
like drinking water,just come up.

660
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:42,457
- Do you know what a prisoner costs?
- 30,000 a year, on average.

661
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:45,322
- Do you keep figures in your head?
- Not at the moment.

662
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:49,026
I've locked them up for vacation.

663
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:54,234
- Do you have a guilty conscience?
- No, but Swedish society does.

664
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:56,930
- Really?
- Ask yourself!.

665
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:02,477
If I had a gun,
I'd knock that chimney down.

666
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,677
And the tower.

667
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:08,611
The whole bloody system.

668
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:16,281
Thanks. You forgot noncustodial.

669
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:18,584
Concentrate!

670
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:21,356
- I am!
- You're not!

671
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:25,558
It's pointless just saying
a prisoner costs 30,000 a year.

672
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:27,293
Compare with noncustodial care,

673
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:32,739
20,000 people costing 60 a year.

674
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:36,570
- A retake?
- Yes!

675
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,306
He's crazy.

676
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:43,545
He demands total
concentration on the picture.

677
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:46,450
Nothing else is allowed to exist!

678
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:49,547
I know he's a bastard.
Are you sleeping with him, though?

679
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:53,792
I said, are you sleeping with him?

680
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:55,488
Oh, that!!!

681
01:08:57,233 --> 01:09:02,000
If I don't, I might just as well
tell him about us.

682
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:05,130
You have to stop that!

683
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:08,005
Impossible till the film's finished.

684
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:10,841
Grand Hotel, Strömsund.

685
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:14,382
You can be without a little while!

686
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:20,448
Do you miss me, Lena?
A lot?

687
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:22,957
I miss you.

688
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:24,923
I miss you so.

689
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:28,820
Bye, then.

690
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:51,115
We'll have time to fly down
to Stockholm and be back Sunday night.

691
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:57,888
I think the class society ought
to irritate the Social Democrats.

692
01:09:58,761 --> 01:09:59,989
It itches like hell.

693
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:05,364
Like scabies.
''The socialist itch.''

694
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:16,067
Sweden is a boastful country.
Our socialism is just showing off.

695
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:22,879
Prison welfare is just an example
of how amateurish we are

696
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:24,850
when it comes to looking
after people.

697
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:32,323
I must attack the idea
of general prevention,

698
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:38,564
the groundless thesis that people won't
commit crimes for fear of punishment.

699
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:44,335
What did Mom say?
Did she send her regards?

700
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:49,400
- No.
- It would be nice if she did.

701
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:52,172
- Hey!!!
- Yes?

702
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:59,453
- When are we finished up here?
- That depends on you.

703
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,647
Why is that?

704
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:04,157
Depends on how much you're
prepared to put into this job.

705
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:11,800
You're losing your spirit.
That scene today with Gunnel Broström -

706
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,368
You were so absent.
- How about you, then?

707
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:19,737
- You just faked everything.
- You've changed a lot, too.

708
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:23,300
Have I?
But you admit you've changed?

709
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:29,646
There's something holding you back.
- Not that I know of.

710
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:32,414
Time to find out, then.

711
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:40,451
You're accommodating on the surface,
but there's a barrier you never cross.

712
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:49,600
Is this the way it's going to be?
- No, this is no fun.

713
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:57,268
But we had it good before.

714
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:03,909
Didn't we?
Or was that just fake, too?

715
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:07,319
No.

716
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:12,389
No, it didn't feel like it.

717
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:24,170
Lena, what is it you want to do?
- What do you mean?

718
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:30,678
Finish the film? Stay with me?
Finish the film and then leave me?

719
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:34,473
Have you thought it through?

720
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:40,487
Okay, so now I'm not allowed
to touch you!

721
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:53,094
I'm singing no longer
ofkisses and sweet words

722
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:58,037
I'm singing no longer
of marriage and rings

723
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:03,306
Darling and lover
are only small play words

724
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:08,645
Having no worth
they've lost their meaning

725
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:19,625
You were the first
the last, and the only

726
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:24,529
So said my heart
from the very first day

727
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:30,071
But I've given you back now
the ring that you gave me

728
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:34,575
Bright rings of gold
are nothing for me

729
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:45,380
I was so blue-eyed
so young and so lowly

730
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:50,515
I was a baby
that just couldn't see

731
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:55,586
You had those others
I wasn't your only

732
01:13:55,697 --> 01:14:00,794
The love that I gave you
you just threw away

733
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:12,704
But my heart is mourning

734
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:16,615
And longing and hoping

735
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,748
Longing and hoping

736
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:24,758
Against all,just for you

737
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:28,887
That you'll understand me

738
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:33,127
And then you'll come back, love

739
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:36,830
My heart is hopeless

740
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:40,500
It won't learn a thing

741
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:51,108
But I know I must make
this heart of mine strong

742
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:56,750
A tough girl is what
the men all long for

743
01:14:56,859 --> 01:15:01,819
Is it good that the girls sit here
and the boys stand over there?

744
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:08,295
- It looks a bit stiff, but it's okay.
- So it's okay?

745
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:14,364
Otherwise the guys can't see
us girls if we all just mingle.

746
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:21,306
- What do the guys do all evening?
- I can't really answer that.

747
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:24,384
They're mostly driving around.

748
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:26,579
I mean on a dance night?

749
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:33,359
Most of those who can dance
are up dancing, but tonight is slow.

750
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:39,392
- Do you buy booze before the dance?
- Of course you bring a bottle!

751
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:41,230
Definitely!
- Why?

752
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:46,831
The broads up here are so shy,
so you have to loosen up a little.

753
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:53,142
I was in the liquor store and bought
five whole bottles of brandy.

754
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:02,082
Excuse me. Gosh, you're tall.
How tall are you?

755
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:04,420
Six-four.

756
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:07,391
Full-grown.

757
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:11,762
- Do you go out to pick up a girl?
- Yes.

758
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:14,030
- Do you usually get one?
- No.

759
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:23,909
It's a drag.

760
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:30,377
What do you think of a girl
who sleeps with you the first night?

761
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,851
- Good.
- You like it?

762
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:39,053
Sure, if she's good in bed.
Otherwise it's a drag.

763
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:42,722
- Bad.
- You think she's bad, then?

764
01:16:44,132 --> 01:16:47,101
It depends who the guy is.

765
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:50,899
If you meet a guy who wants to,
do you let him?

766
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:53,497
I don't think so. It depends.

767
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:58,774
- On what?
- On the boy and other things.

768
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,647
- I wouldn't.
- How many dates first, then?

769
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:05,583
More than one, anyway.

770
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:09,350
- Should girls save sex for after marriage?
- No.

771
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:12,950
- What do you think?
- Definitely not.

772
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:15,592
- Oh, so they should get practice?
- Right!

773
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:21,525
Should the girl or the boy
take precautions?

774
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:25,630
- Who should take care of that?
- The girl.

775
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:30,772
Well, the guy.

776
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:32,403
Both.

777
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:37,081
Which do you prefer,
a rubber or a diaphragm?

778
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:40,416
- What?
- Rubber, diaphragm or the pill?

779
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:42,922
The pill's best.

780
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:46,887
- Are you on the pill?
- No.

781
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:50,863
- Too shy to ask a doctor?
- No.

782
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,764
Should the boy marry a girl
if he gets her pregnant?

783
01:17:56,138 --> 01:18:01,007
Not necessarily, if they find out
they don't like each other.

784
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:03,441
Well, that's a damn problem.

785
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:09,413
But it should be tried in court
and that.

786
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:13,652
If the guy loves the girl,
he should take care of her.

787
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:19,627
If he doesn't, he should forget her.

788
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:23,660
- Do you believe in marriage?
- No.

789
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:28,267
- Have you been married?
- No.

790
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:31,739
- But don't you want children?
- I already have one.

791
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:35,809
- How old is it now?
- Thirteen.

792
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:38,279
Thirteen!

793
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:46,988
I'm doing a scientific survey.
Can I ask you a few questions?

794
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:48,589
Sure.

795
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,659
- How old are you?
- Twenty-nine.

796
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:55,988
So you were how old
when you had your baby?

797
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:58,726
Just turned 1 7.

798
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:01,564
- A boy or a girl?
- A girl.

799
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:18,452
''Lena Explains
Nonviolence to Sonja''

800
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:27,057
FRATERNIZATION!!!
SABOTAGE!!! NONCOOPERATION

801
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:00,453
It's just as shallow out here!

802
01:20:03,665 --> 01:20:08,568
Christ, it's muddy.
What a lousy lake bed. Hell!

803
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:15,107
Are there crabs in here?
- No,just fish.

804
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:16,835
Come on!

805
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:24,184
Hurry up! I'll give you
a swimming lesson.

806
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:30,222
Don't you dare? Come on!

807
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:57,884
I had dinner with Sonja and Elin
every day for a week.

808
01:20:58,486 --> 01:21:00,386
Cloudberries?

809
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:05,221
It was the first time that summer
I felt like staying in one place.

810
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:11,394
- God, that was cold!
- It's so peaceful here.

811
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:17,538
Not a soul for miles.
- I'm so muddy!

812
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:21,604
Rinse off before you get dressed.

813
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:24,035
- Do you know Sonja Lindgren?
- Yes.

814
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:29,515
Did many condemn her for getting
pregnant when she was only 17?

815
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:32,985
Goodness, no.
I can't imagine that.

816
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:36,751
- I hardly think so.
- You don't?

817
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:38,189
Did you?

818
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:43,663
No, there's nothing!!!
nothing wrong with that.

819
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:45,460
- You don't?
- Not me.

820
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:50,264
That belongs to another century,
judging like that.

821
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:53,569
- Another century? The 19th?
- Yes.

822
01:21:56,778 --> 01:22:01,112
I don't think people are so strict
nowadays. Not people in general.

823
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:07,484
When I went into the hospital,
they wanted me to take the elevator.

824
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:11,255
I refused.

825
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:14,817
''I'll take the stairs.
You take my bag in the elevator.''

826
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:23,102
Then, in the labor room,
I refused the bed and everything.

827
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:29,805
They all seemed to look at me
as if to say, ''What's she doing here?''

828
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:35,007
I thought, ''You go on laughing.
I'll manage this myself.''

829
01:22:37,052 --> 01:22:41,887
You know how it feels.
Not a soul gives you a kind look.

830
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:45,016
They all think you're filth,

831
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:49,196
not being able to keep out of trouble.

832
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:21,879
Hell, only 1 2:00.

833
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:30,324
I'd sworn I'd get a few hours'sleep
before Sonja and Elin came to get me.

834
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:36,629
We were going fishing for trout.
But it was just too light up there.

835
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,510
Damned mosquitoes!

836
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:10,274
Lena!

837
01:29:04,572 --> 01:29:07,473
MESSAGE TO
THE PRISON BOARD:

838
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:12,112
YOU HAVE STOPPED
THINKING RADICALLY

839
01:29:12,213 --> 01:29:17,674
PRISON (WELFARE) FACILITY

840
01:29:32,266 --> 01:29:36,225
The earth is a pillow

841
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:44,500
Nice and soft and warm

842
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:53,347
There will Lena safely sleep

843
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:07,394
MARCH AGAINST IMPERIALISM

844
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:12,037
USA - Murderers!

845
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:18,439
Franco - Murderer!

846
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:24,108
Viva Ho Chi Minh!

847
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:32,225
Here comes the socialist movement's

848
01:30:33,027 --> 01:30:35,222
march against imperialism,

849
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:40,692
symbolized here by a snake.

850
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:48,636
Africa :Uhuru means freedom.

851
01:30:49,844 --> 01:30:52,574
Portugal out of Africa!!

852
01:30:53,314 --> 01:30:57,774
Volvo in South Africa::
''Apartheid's value lasts. ''

853
01:30:57,885 --> 01:31:02,185
Fire Wallenberg!
Fire the financiers!

854
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:08,788
Franco, executioner
of the Spanish people.

855
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:11,865
Crush the right-wing junta
in Athens.

856
01:31:17,905 --> 01:31:19,702
Spread the revolution in the US.

857
01:31:20,241 --> 01:31:25,440
Indonesia is the CIA's gas chamber.
One million people murdered.

858
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:29,977
It was awful meeting them all again.

859
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:34,451
All I wanted to do at that moment
was go into hiding.

860
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:39,582
Workers of the world unite.

861
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:42,521
Fight for world peace.

862
01:32:33,981 --> 01:32:35,471
Is there a party here?

863
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:39,946
No, Lena's going to live here.

864
01:32:41,923 --> 01:32:45,552
-Just for a couple of days.
- It doesn't matter how long.

865
01:32:46,027 --> 01:32:47,892
The thing is, where will you sleep?

866
01:32:48,429 --> 01:32:52,195
That's all arranged. Over there.

867
01:32:56,437 --> 01:32:59,031
Hans!

868
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:06,211
- What is it?
- She gets the right-hand cabin.

869
01:33:07,548 --> 01:33:10,244
- Stop nagging. She'll be in here.
- No, I said!

870
01:33:10,885 --> 01:33:12,785
Put her to bed yourself, damn it!

871
01:33:18,059 --> 01:33:22,723
Let's see if we can find you
a place to live.

872
01:33:22,830 --> 01:33:28,666
- I can't live at home right now, so -
- That's fine.

873
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:31,229
I don't want to be any trouble.

874
01:33:31,339 --> 01:33:36,140
Oh, no! Hans often has guests.

875
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:39,102
He's awfully kind.

876
01:33:40,681 --> 01:33:43,775
Yes, he is, but!!!

877
01:33:48,489 --> 01:33:51,549
- What is it?
- It itches.

878
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:56,426
A doctor in Strömsund
said I had an allergy.

879
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:58,498
An allergy? Let's have a look.

880
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:08,738
Only here?
- No. My armpits and fingers, too.

881
01:34:18,953 --> 01:34:22,081
What is it? Move.
I'm going to put -

882
01:34:41,842 --> 01:34:45,369
Bloody pacifist!
Nonviolence, eh?

883
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:48,248
You're crazy.

884
01:34:49,216 --> 01:34:53,585
- What the hell. You win anyway.
- Win?

885
01:34:55,256 --> 01:34:56,780
You know very well.

886
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:01,252
I brought Lena here.

887
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:06,963
I know her
and I want to help her.

888
01:35:13,507 --> 01:35:19,468
You and your damned pseudo-psychology!
- Go and help her your way, then!

889
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:22,106
If you can.

890
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:27,019
I've managed Lena before.

891
01:35:27,688 --> 01:35:28,882
Before, yeah!

892
01:35:31,158 --> 01:35:34,719
- Come here.
- I want to sleep.

893
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:36,660
I don't want to hit you.

894
01:36:35,222 --> 01:36:37,918
Tired of fighting

895
01:36:39,093 --> 01:36:40,993
Half would be enough

896
01:36:41,896 --> 01:36:45,491
We're turned on and off
like lights

897
01:36:47,201 --> 01:36:52,434
Men and beasts alike
The same damned family

898
01:36:53,207 --> 01:36:56,768
Is the pillow big enough for us?

899
01:36:59,446 --> 01:37:01,937
Let us rest now

900
01:37:02,383 --> 01:37:04,544
Shut up in Babel's Tower

901
01:37:05,019 --> 01:37:08,750
People are all blown about

902
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:13,491
I am one of them

903
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:16,152
The samejunk and weed

904
01:37:16,864 --> 01:37:19,799
None of us are good enough

905
01:37:22,903 --> 01:37:24,530
I'm one of them

906
01:37:25,706 --> 01:37:28,072
The samejunk and weed

907
01:37:28,642 --> 01:37:32,237
The wind sends me where it will

908
01:37:56,837 --> 01:37:58,634
- Come here.
- Where's Bim?

909
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:01,030
Asleep.

910
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:05,909
Come in and sit down.
I want to talk a bit.

911
01:38:13,354 --> 01:38:15,914
It's so damned difficult
to talk about these things.

912
01:38:23,464 --> 01:38:24,453
Lena!!!

913
01:38:27,701 --> 01:38:29,464
You're so sweet.

914
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:34,233
It's such a mess!

915
01:38:36,644 --> 01:38:38,874
I can't stand this damned fighting.

916
01:38:40,214 --> 01:38:43,081
- Before you go any further-
- What are you doing here?

917
01:38:43,183 --> 01:38:46,675
- I want to talk to Lena!
- I know, but I want to see something.

918
01:38:48,022 --> 01:38:51,822
Leave Lena alone!
You've got nothing to do with her!

919
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:55,885
I'm going to look at your allergy.
Give me your hand.

920
01:38:57,064 --> 01:38:59,498
A magnifying glass! You're crazy.

921
01:39:03,304 --> 01:39:05,238
Just what I thought.
You've got scabies.

922
01:39:05,372 --> 01:39:09,468
Scabies! The doctor said
it was an allergy.

923
01:39:09,576 --> 01:39:14,843
That's no allergy. It's scabies.
I wonder if you've infected anyone.

924
01:39:15,482 --> 01:39:18,508
- Infected?
- It's catching, in a warm bed.

925
01:39:20,087 --> 01:39:23,113
I almost think you've made up
this scabies to stop us.

926
01:39:23,223 --> 01:39:25,214
Shut up!

927
01:39:35,436 --> 01:39:39,930
I took the part, then.
The part of a car salesman.

928
01:39:42,109 --> 01:39:47,479
Even though I'd sworn I'd say no
and Marie asked me not to.

929
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:52,175
Börje.

930
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:57,723
You sold Mr.Johansson a car,
and he's very angry now.

931
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:07,761
Hi.

932
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:10,300
Can we talk somewhere?

933
01:40:13,207 --> 01:40:15,334
I'm off now. I can give you a lift.

934
01:40:17,344 --> 01:40:19,141
The car's in the garage.

935
01:40:30,958 --> 01:40:33,085
- What did you say you have?
- Scabies.

936
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:41,961
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Thanks for the scabies.

937
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:46,405
- Have you noticed anything?
- You bet! I itch all over!

938
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:47,973
So you've got it too.

939
01:40:54,148 --> 01:40:59,017
But I might not have infected you.
- Who else, then?

940
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:03,522
- Maybe you gave it to me!
- Guys always get it from girls!

941
01:41:03,624 --> 01:41:08,891
I know that much about scabies!
- So it's a girl's disease now, eh?

942
01:41:08,996 --> 01:41:13,228
- You've slept with lots of guys.
- And you with lots of girls!

943
01:41:13,367 --> 01:41:18,771
- Were you with anyone before me?
- Yes. And so were you.

944
01:41:18,872 --> 01:41:21,636
- So what?
- You could have gotten it then.

945
01:41:21,775 --> 01:41:23,868
You gave it to me.

946
01:41:26,113 --> 01:41:28,946
And my kid. Bloody hell!

947
01:41:29,049 --> 01:41:32,246
- You've never talked about your kid before!
- Damn, damn, damn!

948
01:41:32,386 --> 01:41:35,787
Bloody hypocrite.
You disgust me!

949
01:41:35,889 --> 01:41:38,756
You're so disgusting!

950
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:44,788
No matter. We have to do
something about it.

951
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:50,566
You just call St. Göran's clinic
for an appointment.

952
01:41:51,505 --> 01:41:53,166
Number 27.

953
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:14,992
THE SOCIALIST ITCH

954
01:42:42,356 --> 01:42:45,291
''!!!we no longer require
your services!!!''

955
01:42:48,262 --> 01:42:53,393
- Do you work at BMC?
- I've just been fired.

956
01:42:54,067 --> 01:42:56,535
- What will you do now?
- Don't know.

957
01:43:02,676 --> 01:43:04,837
Damned prostitution everywhere.

958
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:08,543
Your number, please.

959
01:43:10,884 --> 01:43:12,408
Step up, please.

960
01:43:13,487 --> 01:43:16,684
Sit on the paper.
One heel in each.

961
01:43:22,863 --> 01:43:26,264
- A bit further forward.
- Give me her card.

962
01:43:30,103 --> 01:43:36,064
- What are you here for?
- I itch. I think I have scabies.

963
01:43:36,777 --> 01:43:38,642
How long has it been?

964
01:43:40,514 --> 01:43:43,608
Two or three weeks.

965
01:43:43,717 --> 01:43:45,275
Move down a bit.

966
01:43:48,188 --> 01:43:50,520
I thought it was mosquito bites.

967
01:43:51,625 --> 01:43:54,651
I itch and I can't sleep.

968
01:43:55,829 --> 01:43:58,093
Your National Health Card, please.

969
01:44:03,003 --> 01:44:07,030
- Have you been here before?
- No.

970
01:44:09,643 --> 01:44:13,909
- You have any discharge?
- Nothing I've noticed.

971
01:44:15,148 --> 01:44:18,777
- You'd notice if you did.
- Then I don't.

972
01:44:25,459 --> 01:44:27,154
Your name is Börje?

973
01:44:28,028 --> 01:44:30,588
- Occupation?
- Car salesman.

974
01:44:32,065 --> 01:44:34,795
Former.

975
01:44:35,435 --> 01:44:36,993
No, why?

976
01:44:37,137 --> 01:44:40,072
Depending on the examination,

977
01:44:40,173 --> 01:44:44,041
other family members might
need an examination.

978
01:44:45,379 --> 01:44:47,074
- No, I'm not married.
- Unmarried.

979
01:44:48,315 --> 01:44:53,116
Residence as stated here -
- If I were married, would she!!!?

980
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:57,816
- The doctor decides that.
- No, I'm not married.

981
01:45:00,994 --> 01:45:02,859
Move down a little more.

982
01:45:05,932 --> 01:45:07,991
A bit more.

983
01:45:08,735 --> 01:45:11,670
I can't examine you unless -

984
01:45:14,408 --> 01:45:15,807
That'll be three crowns.

985
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:30,756
There, then.

986
01:45:31,425 --> 01:45:32,858
Get up, please.

987
01:45:34,928 --> 01:45:38,125
Wait outside for the results.

988
01:45:38,231 --> 01:45:42,463
No alcohol, sexual intercourse
or petting during the treatment.

989
01:45:52,145 --> 01:45:53,874
Stop!

990
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:56,972
We should be a bit ahead of them.
Back again.

991
01:45:57,651 --> 01:45:59,642
We need speed.

992
01:46:01,688 --> 01:46:04,919
- We should have started earlier.
- Do it, then.

993
01:46:05,659 --> 01:46:09,151
Reform the world

994
01:46:10,097 --> 01:46:13,726
Just from little Sweden

995
01:46:14,801 --> 01:46:18,498
So we get well-known,you see
for our fine democracy

996
01:46:22,476 --> 01:46:27,038
- What are we doing tomorrow?

997
01:46:29,449 --> 01:46:32,282

998
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:41,126
Now we'll go up, up, up

999
01:46:41,595 --> 01:46:46,328
Up on our dawning love's
top, top, top

1000
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:52,638
Come, come, come with me

1001
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:55,572
Buy our film!! Buy it!!

1002
01:46:55,675 --> 01:46:58,838
The only film in two versions.

1003
01:46:58,945 --> 01:47:01,379
- This was the blue version.
- The blue version.
