00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:14,394
Who?

9
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:18,755
A'la?

10
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:24,482
- Just hurry up, Mr. Arab.
- What's wrong?

11
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:26,359
A'la cut his vein, search me.

12
00:01:26,403 --> 00:01:28,154
It's okay, go.

13
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,917
A'la!

14
00:01:32,562 --> 00:01:34,521
Hey, A'la!

15
00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:36,361
Get up, what is it A'la?

16
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,840
A'la!

17
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:40,279
I'm talking to you.

18
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:42,718
What?

19
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,437
Here's to the honor of Akbar.

20
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:30,996
Happy birthday.

21
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:35,237
Happy birthday to you.

22
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:39,673
Come and blow out the candles.

23
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,867
One two three.

24
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:53,394
Careful not to waste any of the cake.

25
00:02:53,396 --> 00:02:54,995
Get back, pal.

26
00:02:54,996 --> 00:02:56,474
Get away.

27
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:58,635
The cake got ruined.

28
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,194
Eat it with bread to get full.

29
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:06,426
Bread.

30
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:35,431
Akbar!

31
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:36,985
Akbar!

32
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:43,064
Hold on, what happened Akbar?

33
00:03:45,952 --> 00:03:47,623
What's with you Akbar?

34
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:55,339
Hold on Akbar.

35
00:03:58,951 --> 00:04:00,906
What's with you?

36
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,901
Go to the office.

37
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:12,342
Get out.

38
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:15,586
Come here.

39
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,269
What?

40
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,948
Nothing, sir.

41
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,938
Solitary.

42
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,429
Why are you hitting me?

43
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,429
Just so you invite me the next time
you throw a party.

44
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:28,464
I just wanted him to have some fun
before he's sent to the adult section.

45
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,389
So you're the one to give fun
to all those who are having fun.

46
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:33,742
Let it go.

47
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:36,307
- Two days in solitary.
- I won't go.

48
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:37,707
You won't? I'll beat you up.

49
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,508
- Piece of shit.
- Knock it off.

50
00:04:39,508 --> 00:04:41,627
- Shut up.
- Be nice.

51
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:43,067
- Throw him in solitary.
- Okay.

52
00:04:43,068 --> 00:04:45,217
- Throw him there.
- I will, you go.

53
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:47,223
Come.

54
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:52,707
You asked for it.

55
00:04:52,707 --> 00:04:54,856
I'll beat the living shit out of him
the minute I step out of here.

56
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:57,260
- No, you won't.
- He is not logical.

57
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:59,546
You don't seem to
understand what you did today.

58
00:04:59,547 --> 00:05:01,746
What did I do?
I had a festivity, is that a crime?

59
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:04,946
Who are you to remind that poor soul
it's his eighteenth birthday today?

60
00:05:04,947 --> 00:05:06,866
- He's my friend.
- Is that how you show friendship?

61
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:07,985
I just wanted to make him happy.

62
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:10,578
- So why didn't he get happy?
- I don't know.

63
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:12,616
But I know.

64
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:14,585
He's eighteen years old fix today.

65
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:16,384
Meaning it's time for his execution.

66
00:05:16,386 --> 00:05:18,103
Got it now?

67
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:20,817
Take him.

68
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:09,214
Jump up.

69
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:17,850
Don't you panic.

70
00:06:17,981 --> 00:06:20,858
I have a feeling the guy
will finally give his consent.

71
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:24,092
Just be careful.
Adults' section is different than here.

72
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,209
You won't get close to anyone there.

73
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,859
And you'll leave everyone alone.

74
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:30,179
Just be yourself, got that?

75
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,179
Okay.

76
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,578
And if you're released and come
back here empty-handed. . .

77
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,729
I'll throw your ass in solitary for a week.

78
00:07:19,657 --> 00:07:21,496
You're leaving early today.

79
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:23,854
I'm going to see the boy's complainant.

80
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:25,766
Aren't you tired yet?

81
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:28,255
It's the last time.

82
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:30,007
There might be hope yet.

83
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:31,695
You're only disrespecting yourself.

84
00:07:31,695 --> 00:07:33,491
That fellow won't give an inch.

85
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:35,769
It won't hurt to go though.

86
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:38,649
Remember what I told you two years ago?

87
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:43,173
I said if we meet that
fellow ten years later. . .

88
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:45,687
If we beg him, and preach him. . .

89
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:50,254
He'll still want capital punishment.

90
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:51,533
Now you believe me?

91
00:07:51,534 --> 00:07:54,252
I would have let go if it were
anyone else besides Akbar.

92
00:07:54,534 --> 00:07:56,333
But that kid doesn't deserve to be executed.

93
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,572
Two and two is four.

94
00:07:57,574 --> 00:07:59,413
You'll have to be executed
if you kill someone.

95
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:02,166
This is called justice
and the rest is bullshit.

96
00:08:03,493 --> 00:08:05,800
Bring something on the way back.

97
00:08:12,212 --> 00:08:15,203
A'la has cut himself and
is dying, Mr. Ghafourian.

98
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:16,691
Where is he now?

99
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:18,329
In the toilets.

100
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:22,411
They're coming.

101
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:23,891
Hit me.

102
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:25,811
Come on do an "X".

103
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:27,570
Hold it right.

104
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:29,686
Cut me, you idiot, before he comes.
Don't worry, do it.

105
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:31,524
Go on.

106
00:08:32,531 --> 00:08:34,804
Goddamn, you piece of shit.

107
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:39,726
I got here a bit early, didn't I?

108
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,209
How did you kill your father coward?

109
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:51,848
He's killing everyone.

110
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,044
Cutie.

111
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:56,638
Get out of here.

112
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:59,807
Why did you want to cut yourself?

113
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:02,275
So we take you to the hospital
and you can escape from there.

114
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:05,208
How stupid do you think we are
not to know what goes on in your heads. . .

115
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:07,687
After four years of dealing with prisoners?

116
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:09,288
I want to get out of here.

117
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:10,768
What's going on out there?

118
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:12,207
Your wife and children are waiting for you?

119
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:13,888
Or your parents?

120
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:14,876
I have things to do.

121
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:18,844
Have you found new work?
Or the same shit and stealing?

122
00:09:19,327 --> 00:09:20,964
I'll run away from here.

123
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:22,520
Go on.

124
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:25,398
Do it.

125
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:28,206
I want to do it for Akbar.

126
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:29,366
To do what?

127
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:31,246
To get his consent.

128
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:32,846
No way.

129
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:34,245
I'll do it.

130
00:09:34,247 --> 00:09:36,486
I've done everything I wanted
to do in this world.

131
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:37,846
Thanks a lot.

132
00:09:37,846 --> 00:09:40,284
You'll go and mess things up
worse than they already are.

133
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:42,285
What are they going to
do if things get worse?

134
00:09:42,286 --> 00:09:43,725
Will they execute him twice?

135
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:45,044
This isn't your responsibility.

136
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:47,085
Whose is it then? You?

137
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,645
How come you haven't been able
to do it then?

138
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:50,604
I would have done it if it were
possible, you idiot.

139
00:09:50,605 --> 00:09:52,037
I'll do it.

140
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:54,685
I'll stick to him in twenty four hours
and get his consent.

141
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:56,004
I'm a bastard if I don't get it.

142
00:09:56,005 --> 00:09:57,804
Do it when your time is up.

143
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,764
He'll be executed by then.

144
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:00,763
I have to go now.

145
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:02,516
It's out of my hands.

146
00:10:02,564 --> 00:10:03,683
Go in the ward.

147
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:06,072
And you do things like that once more
and you'll find yourself in solitary.

148
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:08,116
Now.

149
00:10:15,363 --> 00:10:17,398
How much more is left of your jail time?

150
00:10:18,403 --> 00:10:19,722
Twenty eight days.

151
00:10:19,723 --> 00:10:22,794
I would have been able to help you
if you had good diciplinary things.

152
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:26,755
But you're always either
fighting or hitting yourself.

153
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:30,042
My record is black anyway.

154
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:32,400
But Akbar's is full of good things.

155
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:33,641
For him.

156
00:10:33,642 --> 00:10:35,281
Get your hand off.

157
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:37,759
I swear if I get out of here
and get consent. . .

158
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:39,360
I'll be back by myself. . .

159
00:10:39,362 --> 00:10:41,192
And I'll spend two months instead
of twenty eight days.

160
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,993
In order for the first good diciplinary
report to go in your record. . .

161
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,559
You'll bring my that cutter right now.

162
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:49,120
Sure thing, sir.

163
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:50,109
Get lost.

164
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:58,280
You've changed.

165
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,156
I even did my morning prayers.

166
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,117
How many times?

167
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,079
I said how many times?

168
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,195
I prayed for all the days I haven't.

169
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,669
Did you shower before it?

170
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,555
Did you see these photos?

171
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,390
Animals.

172
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:18,989
Can I go now? Is it done?

173
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,278
You'll bring the rest tomorrow.

174
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,198
I swear there is no more, sir.

175
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:24,837
You shouldn't lie when you pray.

176
00:11:24,838 --> 00:11:26,236
There are more.

177
00:11:27,398 --> 00:11:29,547
- Sure sir, I'll bring them.
- That's it.

178
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:38,796
Bring his file.
Let's see if there's anything we can do.

179
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:41,676
Put a couple of good behavoir
reports in there as well.

180
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:43,556
Never mind that.

181
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:46,115
He only has about a month left
of his time anyway.

182
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:47,956
If he were going to change. . .

183
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:50,514
He would have done so
during the past couple of years.

184
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,988
Besides the twenty some days left
of his time is for extra punishment.

185
00:11:54,596 --> 00:11:56,187
You know his fines.

186
00:12:00,276 --> 00:12:02,315
A'la Pour Salehi.

187
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:05,751
A'la Pour Salehi.
Get your belongings and come to the office.

188
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:08,145
Pour Salehi to the office.

189
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:46,231
Do you see that blue window?

190
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,711
That's Akbar's sister's house.

191
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:49,431
You'll talk to her.

192
00:12:49,432 --> 00:12:52,231
And you'll go to the old man's house together.

193
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:54,549
You'll mess things up if you go alone.

194
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:57,508
Remember not to talk shit when you go there.

195
00:12:57,671 --> 00:12:59,470
And don't get into a fight.

196
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:01,070
Be nice.

197
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,470
Get out.

198
00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:41,899
Who do you want to see?

199
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:44,667
Who do you want to talk to?

200
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:46,225
What's it to you?

201
00:13:47,508 --> 00:13:50,827
I said who are you here to see
in this house? Don't be smart.

202
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:52,626
With my friend's sister.

203
00:13:52,628 --> 00:13:54,867
- Akbar?
- Is she here?

204
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,987
- No.
- When will she be back?

205
00:13:56,987 --> 00:13:58,066
There's no telling.

206
00:13:58,067 --> 00:13:59,666
Tell me, I'll give her the message.

207
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,185
I have to tell her.

208
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:02,778
She's out.

209
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:11,698
Give me a cold drink.

210
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:37,216
Do you want some?

211
00:14:47,783 --> 00:14:49,022
Don't drink it, kid.

212
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:50,250
Give it to me.

213
00:15:01,462 --> 00:15:03,261
You're a bit sick, aren't you?

214
00:15:03,262 --> 00:15:05,980
Get out of here.
Don't cause trouble.

215
00:15:17,261 --> 00:15:19,819
Why did you bring the kid here again?

216
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:21,180
What do you want keep knocking?

217
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:22,540
Get in the house.

218
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,700
You're stupid to bring the kid out
here in the dust and mud.

219
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:26,620
- Yeah, I'm stupid.
- You'll eventually kill the kid.

220
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:28,979
- Are you Akbar's sister?
- Get out of here.

221
00:15:28,981 --> 00:15:30,380
What do you want?

222
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,299
I was with Akbar, in the rehab.

223
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,219
- Didn't I tell you. . .
- None of your business.

224
00:15:34,219 --> 00:15:36,458
Do you have to bark at anyone
passing by here?

225
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:38,897
- You're the dog.
- Get in the house.

226
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:40,729
Shut your mouth.

227
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:43,338
- Is he your husband?
- Never mind.

228
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:44,578
What's new with Akbar?

229
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:45,858
Is he alright?

230
00:15:45,859 --> 00:15:46,938
Yeah.

231
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:48,578
He's just scared.

232
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:49,852
Why?

233
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:52,216
It's time for his execution.

234
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:56,210
Easy baby, let me see what I can do.

235
00:15:56,298 --> 00:15:58,177
When are they going to hang him?

236
00:15:58,178 --> 00:15:59,937
Not much longer.

237
00:15:59,938 --> 00:16:02,897
He begged for you to go and get
the complainant's consent somehow.

238
00:16:02,898 --> 00:16:04,057
He won't.

239
00:16:04,058 --> 00:16:06,777
I've tried it a thousand times during
the past two years.

240
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:09,176
I cried, I begged him.

241
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,848
I begged him.

242
00:16:12,337 --> 00:16:14,935
The last time I bent down to kiss his hand.

243
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:16,376
He punched me in the head.

244
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:18,655
I've had a headache for a month now.

245
00:16:18,657 --> 00:16:21,123
I'm embarrassed to go and visit Akbar.

246
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:25,008
How can I keep lying to him?

247
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:33,131
Doesn't Akbar have anyone else but you?

248
00:16:33,536 --> 00:16:34,809
Like who?

249
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:37,527
We wouldn't be in this mess
if we had anyone watching over us.

250
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,894
As far as me too.

251
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:42,134
It's no difference if I go or not to go.

252
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,250
So you don't want to do anything for him?

253
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:45,892
Like what?

254
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:47,813
How much more can I drag the baby. . .

255
00:16:47,815 --> 00:16:50,373
And go and keep getting
beat up and cursed out?

256
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:52,006
Maybe he wants money.

257
00:16:52,814 --> 00:16:53,962
No, he doesn't.

258
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:55,613
Besides I don't have any
even if he wants money.

259
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,773
Get out of here, pal.

260
00:16:57,774 --> 00:16:59,729
Don't come around here anymore.

261
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,246
Leave her alone.

262
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,001
Stop there.

263
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,247
What did you get from that addict?

264
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,569
Pardon?

265
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:00,684
Sorry ma'am, do you know him?

266
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,480
He's a relative.

267
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:06,198
Can you bring us some water?

268
00:18:11,768 --> 00:18:13,447
Give him his bag and let him go.

269
00:18:13,448 --> 00:18:15,647
- Is there something wrong sir?
- No, it's nothing

270
00:18:15,647 --> 00:18:17,965
- How about a drink?
- Is it cold?

271
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:20,354
Come here, it's cold.

272
00:18:31,406 --> 00:18:34,077
A stranger coming in this neighborhood
means he's here to buy drugs.

273
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,405
Come in and wash up.

274
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,759
No, just give me some water.

275
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:46,564
Where is Akbar now?

276
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:48,283
I'll find out for you.

277
00:18:48,646 --> 00:18:49,600
No.

278
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,044
Just don't tell him you saw
me if you go to visit him.

279
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:53,964
I won't go to see him until
I get the consent for him.

280
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:56,194
- You want to go and meet his complainant?
- Yeah.

281
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:58,484
Do you have his address?

282
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:00,439
I'll get it from the rehab.

283
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:04,595
We'll go together then.

284
00:19:04,964 --> 00:19:06,203
When should I come?

285
00:19:06,204 --> 00:19:08,682
I'm home till noon everyday
then I go to work.

286
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:10,843
Stand over that line when you come.

287
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:13,117
- I'll see you from my room.
- Okay.

288
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:16,470
Does your husband sell envelops too?

289
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:18,793
- No.
- Bye.

290
00:19:30,322 --> 00:19:31,640
Who is it?

291
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:48,718
Here's the key.

292
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,320
- You're leaving early.
- I have things to do.

293
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:53,151
Give me an envelop.

294
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,349
And pain killers the rest.

295
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,033
You still haven't gone to see a doctor yet.

296
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:21,958
Sorry, I'm late.

297
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,470
It's alright.

298
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:39,783
- I'll bring this.
- Thanks.

299
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:58,032
Watch the other way.

300
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:24,031
Take this.

301
00:21:24,994 --> 00:21:26,506
And this too.

302
00:21:27,794 --> 00:21:30,990
Walk him a bit if he starts to cry.

303
00:21:41,193 --> 00:21:42,912
Give this to me too.

304
00:21:42,912 --> 00:21:44,551
Don't you want me to come in?

305
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:46,382
Let me go in this time.

306
00:21:49,272 --> 00:21:50,829
- Hello.
- Hello.

307
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:54,099
- Is your husband home?
- No, he's out.

308
00:21:54,552 --> 00:21:55,751
For God's sake.

309
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:58,349
Do you know how far I've come
here in this heat with this kid?

310
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:00,669
You're gonna be ruded out again.
Haven't you had enough?

311
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:02,190
Let him do it if it makes him feel better.

312
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:03,750
Can't blame him.

313
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:05,388
Let me come in for God's sake.

314
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:07,826
Let me see what I can do.

315
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,989
Why are you upset?

316
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,308
Why did I come here then?
To babysit?

317
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,469
You don't know him yet.

318
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,149
He'll get pissed off if it's the two of us.

319
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:25,587
But I'm a woman and alone.
He'll take it under consideration.

320
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:28,147
I'll call you if he's in a good mood.

321
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,589
What can I do?
He doesn't want you in.

322
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:32,468
You let me come in, 
tell him I forced my way.

323
00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:34,907
You come and go but I have
to bear his bad attitude for two days.

324
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:36,948
Please, I won't come anymore.

325
00:22:36,948 --> 00:22:39,867
He'll give consent today hopefully
and you won't ever see me.

326
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:42,108
- His got a patient in the room.
- Please, I'll wait till she leaves.

327
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:44,626
He's not in a good mood at all today.
He went to the cemetery.

328
00:22:44,628 --> 00:22:46,427
I'm so sorry, let me come in.

329
00:22:46,428 --> 00:22:48,467
Just two minutes.
I'll leave soon.

330
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:50,697
- Don't tell him I let you in then.
- Okay, don't worry.

331
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,019
Gather this up or I'll throw it out.

332
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:24,944
There is a Qur'an on it.

333
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,060
Will you throw that out too?

334
00:23:27,385 --> 00:23:29,420
Let me talk to you for a moment.

335
00:23:30,184 --> 00:23:32,457
I have to go out.

336
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,823
Mr. Abolqasem!

337
00:23:35,824 --> 00:23:38,177
Pick this up and then talk.

338
00:23:46,143 --> 00:23:47,894
Mr. Abolqasem!

339
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:52,136
Akbar turned eighteen.

340
00:23:52,302 --> 00:23:54,496
They took him to the death row.

341
00:23:55,663 --> 00:23:58,334
He's not the same boy you saw
two years ago in the court.

342
00:23:59,782 --> 00:24:01,181
He's gotten old, he's a corpse.

343
00:24:01,182 --> 00:24:03,740
He's a bag of bones.

344
00:24:04,422 --> 00:24:07,458
He's gotten tortured as much
as ten executions during the past two years.

345
00:24:08,501 --> 00:24:11,333
I would have brought him personally
if he had the nerve to do it.

346
00:24:12,142 --> 00:24:14,211
You'd have given consent.

347
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,973
There's no time left, Mr. Abolqasem.

348
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:22,490
They'll hang him if you don't give consent.

349
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:24,692
Was that all?

350
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,578
I don't have anyone else besides him.

351
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,938
All my hope is for him to come
out in five or ten years. . .

352
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,213
And to take care of me.

353
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,579
Don't waste your breath.

354
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,299
I won't forget my girl's death.

355
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:39,857
I swear to God Maliheh wouldn't
be happy about Akbar's death neither.

356
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:41,618
Don't use my girl's name.

357
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:43,370
Who let you in here?

358
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,253
Do you belong to this house?

359
00:25:19,577 --> 00:25:21,096
- Hello.
- Hi.

360
00:25:21,096 --> 00:25:22,733
Give me your hand.

361
00:25:26,616 --> 00:25:28,969
The baby is hungry.
Tell her mother to come out and feed her.

362
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:32,694
The milk she'll give the baby now
is more like poison to him.

363
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:34,492
What do I do then?

364
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,406
Give him to me.

365
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:06,285
Someone help me.

366
00:26:07,053 --> 00:26:09,885
Shame on you, she's a woman.

367
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:19,809
Did he hit you?

368
00:26:20,492 --> 00:26:22,845
Why are you lying?
I saw him throw you out.

369
00:26:26,132 --> 00:26:27,131
What are you gonna do?

370
00:26:27,131 --> 00:26:29,090
He's got no right to raise
his hand on a woman.

371
00:26:29,092 --> 00:26:31,131
Come on out if you dare to.
Come on out you. . .

372
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,802
Quiet.

373
00:26:33,571 --> 00:26:35,288
Get back.

374
00:26:36,611 --> 00:26:38,328
I told you to get back.

375
00:27:05,768 --> 00:27:07,359
Where is my baby?

376
00:27:08,248 --> 00:27:09,919
Didn't they give him to you?

377
00:27:13,928 --> 00:27:17,407
He notices all the animals in the forest. . .

378
00:27:17,408 --> 00:27:20,927
To have a party for him.

379
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:23,564
The deer becomes happy.

380
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:25,756
I have to take him, dear.

381
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:31,766
That's the end of our story.

382
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:36,123
But not the end of all stories.

383
00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:50,680
Come.

384
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:52,962
You wanted an envelope.

385
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,162
You want to write a letter
to your girlfriend?

386
00:28:04,604 --> 00:28:06,483
Doesn't she have a phone?

387
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,122
She's worthless if she doesn't have a phone.

388
00:28:09,124 --> 00:28:11,079
Specially for someone who's in prison.

389
00:28:19,124 --> 00:28:20,403
If I told you not to come in. . .

390
00:28:20,403 --> 00:28:22,472
It's because I knew that's
how it would turn out to be.

391
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:27,436
I'm willing to do anything for Akbar.

392
00:28:27,683 --> 00:28:29,242
To belittle myself.

393
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:30,961
To be cursed, and to beg.

394
00:28:30,962 --> 00:28:32,280
And to lie.

395
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:36,035
But I don't want anyone to see me that way.

396
00:28:40,962 --> 00:28:43,031
Stop in front of the hospital, mister.

397
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,198
- Fare for two.
- No, just one.

398
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,155
No the two.

399
00:29:31,317 --> 00:29:33,227
Pay attention.

400
00:29:33,677 --> 00:29:36,235
Act like I don't know what you want here.

401
00:29:36,237 --> 00:29:39,156
He'll put me through hell if he finds out.

402
00:29:39,157 --> 00:29:40,436
Why isn't he coming then?

403
00:29:40,437 --> 00:29:42,313
He's washing up.

404
00:29:51,396 --> 00:29:54,114
- Who is it?
- I think it's a patient.

405
00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:04,954
Hello Haji, how are you?

406
00:30:04,955 --> 00:30:06,592
Hello son, sit down.

407
00:30:11,594 --> 00:30:13,473
Sorry, it's a bad time.

408
00:30:13,475 --> 00:30:15,034
Would you like to do your prayers first. . .

409
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:17,433
I'll bother you later then.

410
00:30:17,435 --> 00:30:19,186
I'll pray at the mosque.

411
00:30:24,194 --> 00:30:25,512
Sit down.

412
00:30:29,593 --> 00:30:31,389
Come closer.

413
00:30:38,273 --> 00:30:40,149
What's the matter?

414
00:30:41,512 --> 00:30:43,551
What is your sickness son?

415
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:45,462
Nothing.

416
00:30:46,832 --> 00:30:48,871
Why are you here then?

417
00:30:48,872 --> 00:30:50,782
I have a letter for you.

418
00:30:55,512 --> 00:30:56,911
Where from?

419
00:30:56,911 --> 00:30:59,105
Someone who told me
to make sure you get it.

420
00:31:00,071 --> 00:31:01,510
Who?

421
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:03,110
You'll know when you read it.

422
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,100
Should I read it to you?

423
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:07,589
Go on.

424
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,940
In the name of God.

425
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,908
Hello, Mr. Abolqasem Rahmati.

426
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,909
Now that I'm writing this letter to you. . .

427
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:25,388
I've turned eighteen and. . .

428
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:28,108
I'll be executed in a little while.

429
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:33,388
I know hearing this. . .

430
00:31:33,389 --> 00:31:35,628
Is difficult for you.

431
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:38,984
But I didn't want to kill your loved one.

432
00:31:39,428 --> 00:31:42,260
I meant to kill her and me both.

433
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:45,186
I was supposed to kill myself first.

434
00:31:45,188 --> 00:31:47,427
But Maliheh said that if I killed myself. . .

435
00:31:47,428 --> 00:31:50,065
She's kill herself too.

436
00:31:50,307 --> 00:31:51,746
You loved her a lot.

437
00:31:51,748 --> 00:31:53,977
Maliheh had told me about it a few times.

438
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:56,106
But I want you to know. . .

439
00:31:56,107 --> 00:31:59,066
That no one loved her as much as I did.

440
00:31:59,067 --> 00:32:01,499
And she didn't love anyone more
than me after you of course.

441
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:07,025
I don't mean to ask you.

442
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08,825
To give consent so I won't be executed.

443
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,895
I wanted to be executed two years ago.

444
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:17,465
But I don't deserve to be executed.

445
00:32:17,465 --> 00:32:19,304
It's not all my fault.

446
00:32:19,306 --> 00:32:22,422
Remember how you beat her up
once in front of me.

447
00:32:23,745 --> 00:32:25,384
The pleasure you find in venges. . .

448
00:32:25,385 --> 00:32:27,579
I mean in forgiveness you won't
find in taking revenge.

449
00:32:50,143 --> 00:32:51,416
May God accept it.

450
00:32:53,062 --> 00:32:54,699
May God accept it, Haji.

451
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,377
Just give me an ear while you're praying.

452
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:43,578
I understand you.

453
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:45,648
You lost a dear one, and you're angry.

454
00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:49,011
And you think you'll feel
better once he's executed.

455
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:51,057
But I swear to God you won't.

456
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:53,094
I swear to Qur'an if anything changes.

457
00:33:53,818 --> 00:33:56,455
You'll be the first one to feel bad
once he's executed.

458
00:33:57,738 --> 00:34:00,737
Do you believe in the very God
you're praying to now?

459
00:34:00,737 --> 00:34:02,328
Refer him to God.

460
00:34:02,897 --> 00:34:04,807
Doesn't he deserve to die?

461
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:07,894
God knows it better than you and me
what's right and what's wrong.

462
00:34:09,138 --> 00:34:12,095
He'll do such a number on him
worse than a hundred executions.

463
00:34:12,857 --> 00:34:15,295
For instance, once he steps out of jail. . .

464
00:34:15,297 --> 00:34:16,696
He'll get run over by a car.

465
00:34:16,696 --> 00:34:18,526
It's nothing for God.

466
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,573
He'll take care of it.

467
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:23,935
But if you don't believe me. . .

468
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,812
That means you have doubts in God.

469
00:34:30,776 --> 00:34:33,242
Besides there is a difference.

470
00:34:33,536 --> 00:34:35,605
Your girl didn't know she was going to die.

471
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:37,974
It was over in a moment.

472
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,333
But my friend knows he's supposed to die.

473
00:34:40,335 --> 00:34:41,614
For two years.

474
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:42,934
Until he's hanged. . .

475
00:34:42,935 --> 00:34:45,242
He'll die a hundred times a night.

476
00:34:46,574 --> 00:34:48,892
Now is that the same?

477
00:34:48,894 --> 00:34:50,451
You be the judge of that.

478
00:34:50,694 --> 00:34:52,206
Hold on, Haji.

479
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,205
I want to talk to you.

480
00:34:55,774 --> 00:34:57,973
Even if my own brother
had committed murder. . .

481
00:34:57,974 --> 00:34:59,413
I wouldn't have left everything. . .

482
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:01,612
To go and get consent for him.

483
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:04,000
But Akbar doesn't deserve execution.

484
00:35:04,373 --> 00:35:07,092
So I won't give up until I get your consent.

485
00:35:07,093 --> 00:35:09,048
I'll be on you night and day.

486
00:35:09,413 --> 00:35:11,084
Now it's up to you.

487
00:35:12,452 --> 00:35:14,291
Okay, go on for now.

488
00:35:14,293 --> 00:35:16,600
Until I think it over.

489
00:35:23,092 --> 00:35:24,888
Thanks a lot, Haji.

490
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,037
Where did she go again?

491
00:36:12,688 --> 00:36:15,807
My pretty baby.

492
00:36:15,808 --> 00:36:19,436
Mother's baby.

493
00:36:27,887 --> 00:36:29,686
- Hi.
- Hi.

494
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,926
Abolqasem isn't in.

495
00:36:30,926 --> 00:36:32,438
I don't want to come in.

496
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:36,166
Here you are.

497
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:38,125
Why do you keep spending money, girl?

498
00:36:38,126 --> 00:36:40,165
No matter how much I spent
it's not enough for you.

499
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,962
These are nothing.

500
00:36:43,766 --> 00:36:46,643
Thank God, Mr. Abolqasem's gotten a bit soft.

501
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:49,757
Says who?

502
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:52,325
He told me last night.

503
00:36:52,325 --> 00:36:54,791
He went to the court this morning.

504
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:57,194
To give consent?

505
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:00,964
Didn't he say anything to you?

506
00:37:00,964 --> 00:37:03,430
Execution is his final word.

507
00:37:05,084 --> 00:37:06,403
Last night he'd gotten a bit soft.

508
00:37:06,404 --> 00:37:08,203
He didn't curse out nor did he beat me.

509
00:37:08,204 --> 00:37:10,636
He listened to everything I told him.

510
00:37:11,283 --> 00:37:12,442
How dare did he go to the court?

511
00:37:12,444 --> 00:37:13,683
I'm not a kid to play me!

512
00:37:13,683 --> 00:37:15,513
I'm tired anymore.

513
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,602
Do whatever you want to.

514
00:37:17,604 --> 00:37:19,321
Come in and see him yourself.

515
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,521
Don't worry.

516
00:37:30,522 --> 00:37:33,481
File a complaint and they'll take care of it.

517
00:37:33,482 --> 00:37:35,920
For as long as they have hopes to
get my consent. . .

518
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,400
They won't let up on me.

519
00:37:37,402 --> 00:37:39,596
So are you going to give consent?

520
00:37:39,682 --> 00:37:41,881
How can I? He killed my girl.

521
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:43,599
Why are you here then?

522
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,840
I'm here to see if there's anything
I can do to speed things up.

523
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:49,439
And for them to stop hoping.

524
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,439
You waited for two years
and you can wait a bit longer.

525
00:37:52,441 --> 00:37:54,240
They'll execute him.

526
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,638
But I'm fed up with them coming and going.

527
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,439
Well just as much as you loved your girl. . .

528
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,191
They love the boy too.

529
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,319
You can't blame them for trying.

530
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,116
To stop their boy to be executed.

531
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,879
What can I do for them to realize
I won't be giving my consent?

532
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,039
If you don't want the
execution to be postponed. . .

533
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,758
Go after coming up with the blood money.

534
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:14,918
I told you I don't have any money.

535
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:18,149
But you have to pay the difference
between a man and woman's blood money.

536
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:20,157
He killed my girl. . .

537
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:22,278
But I have to pay so he's executed?

538
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:24,757
The victim is a woman and
the murderer is a man.

539
00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:27,077
The blood money of the victim
is half of the one of the murderer.

540
00:38:27,078 --> 00:38:28,877
I'd told you this before.

541
00:38:28,878 --> 00:38:31,997
So my girl's life is worth half
of that bastard's life?

542
00:38:31,997 --> 00:38:34,395
According to the law the blood money
of a Muslim woman. . .

543
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:36,512
Is half of a Muslim man.

544
00:38:47,397 --> 00:38:49,915
Are you a Muslim or not?

545
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:51,276
I sure am.

546
00:38:51,276 --> 00:38:54,635
I believe in the same God
and prophet that you do.

547
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:56,315
This is the laws of Islam.

548
00:38:56,316 --> 00:38:58,355
And the law says anyone
who's loved one is killed. . .

549
00:38:58,356 --> 00:39:01,195
Has to pay a couple of millions
so you could execute the murderer?

550
00:39:01,195 --> 00:39:02,194
Or is that what you say?

551
00:39:02,195 --> 00:39:03,794
This money isn't going in my pocket. . .

552
00:39:03,795 --> 00:39:05,466
Or to the government.

553
00:39:05,516 --> 00:39:07,635
It goes to the murderer's family.

554
00:39:07,635 --> 00:39:09,554
And I don't have time to explain
the logic behind it.

555
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:12,466
Is there any logic to this anyway?

556
00:39:13,155 --> 00:39:14,914
The same religion you believe in. . .

557
00:39:14,914 --> 00:39:17,432
It is hasty when it comes to someone
being killed. . .

558
00:39:17,434 --> 00:39:19,673
And for another person to be
killed because of it.

559
00:39:19,674 --> 00:39:22,593
So it's put barriers on your way. . .

560
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:25,391
So you would forgive.

561
00:39:25,514 --> 00:39:27,153
I won't.

562
00:39:27,154 --> 00:39:28,673
You will, God willingly.

563
00:39:28,673 --> 00:39:30,552
It's more of a good deed.

564
00:39:30,553 --> 00:39:33,111
One thing us poor people have a lot
in this world. . .

565
00:39:33,113 --> 00:39:34,872
Is doing good deeds, sir.

566
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,102
So think about preparing the blood money.

567
00:39:43,033 --> 00:39:45,499
- Bye.
- Take care.

568
00:39:52,352 --> 00:39:53,750
Mister!

569
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:56,827
Are you his relative?

570
00:39:57,152 --> 00:39:58,951
No, I'm his friend.

571
00:39:58,952 --> 00:40:00,271
Akbar's friend.

572
00:40:00,271 --> 00:40:02,629
Do they have anyone to pay money for them?

573
00:40:02,631 --> 00:40:03,790
What money?

574
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:05,348
For consent.

575
00:40:05,991 --> 00:40:07,990
I thought you said your husband
won't give consent.

576
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:10,868
What if I persuade him?
Do they have anyone with money?

577
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,509
How much?

578
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:15,069
Enough to cure my daughter.

579
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,947
From what I gathered from your husband
he won't give consent even with money.

580
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,069
He only listens to one person.

581
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:21,308
I'll go to him.

582
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,029
He'll make him give his consent
even if it's for the cure. . .

583
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,469
Of my daughter.

584
00:40:25,469 --> 00:40:26,748
Who?

585
00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:28,108
The praying leader of the mosque.

586
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:29,668
You have to stand up to him.

587
00:40:29,669 --> 00:40:31,818
You're the one who has to forgive.

588
00:40:32,669 --> 00:40:34,898
A mother is more righteous than a father.

589
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:36,508
I mean she was your child too.

590
00:40:36,508 --> 00:40:38,227
And say you want to forgive.

591
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:40,107
Maliheh wasn't my daughter.

592
00:40:40,108 --> 00:40:43,467
She was the only memory
of his late first wife.

593
00:40:43,468 --> 00:40:45,662
You can't blame him for not forgiving.

594
00:40:46,588 --> 00:40:49,226
Just don't let him find out I talked to you.

595
00:40:49,227 --> 00:40:51,106
And if they gather enough money. . .

596
00:40:51,108 --> 00:40:52,779
Let me know.

597
00:41:06,267 --> 00:41:07,986
You haven't had lunch have you?

598
00:41:07,986 --> 00:41:09,585
I had.

599
00:41:09,586 --> 00:41:12,144
Okay eat this too.
It'll be your dinner.

600
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:14,257
How do you know?

601
00:41:18,985 --> 00:41:21,054
Where do you stay at night?

602
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:25,260
In my mother's house in Niavaran.

603
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:28,621
Funny!

604
00:41:29,984 --> 00:41:31,623
When will you be done work?

605
00:41:31,624 --> 00:41:32,623
Why?

606
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:34,614
Let's go to get consent.

607
00:41:36,904 --> 00:41:40,100
His wife said she'll force him to accept
it if we come up with money.

608
00:41:41,304 --> 00:41:44,534
Tell your mother in Niavaran
to loan a couple of millions.

609
00:41:46,624 --> 00:41:48,931
It's possible to come up with the money
if they don't want it all at once.

610
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,254
How?

611
00:41:53,183 --> 00:41:54,820
We'll come up with it.

612
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:05,057
Why were you in the rehab?

613
00:42:05,502 --> 00:42:06,775
For robbery.

614
00:42:14,421 --> 00:42:16,217
When should I come to pick you up?

615
00:42:18,341 --> 00:42:19,780
I'm here tonight.

616
00:42:19,781 --> 00:42:21,420
So tomorrow.

617
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,535
- Are you full now?
- Not really.

618
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:48,336
Yes, Haji?

619
00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:51,538
I looked the Qur'an for you.

620
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:53,378
You did?

621
00:42:53,378 --> 00:42:56,337
Your wife told me to ask God
for advice for you.

622
00:42:56,338 --> 00:42:58,177
What for?

623
00:42:58,178 --> 00:43:00,897
For your problem.

624
00:43:00,898 --> 00:43:02,417
Sit down.

625
00:43:02,418 --> 00:43:05,089
My wife came to you without telling me.

626
00:43:05,698 --> 00:43:07,697
I don't need advice.

627
00:43:07,698 --> 00:43:10,894
Everyone needs advice
when you are in doubt.

628
00:43:11,217 --> 00:43:13,615
And what better advice than God's?

629
00:43:13,617 --> 00:43:16,015
But I'm not in doubt.

630
00:43:16,017 --> 00:43:17,972
Sit down anyway.

631
00:43:18,457 --> 00:43:19,730
Here.

632
00:43:28,695 --> 00:43:32,323
[ reading the Quran ]

633
00:43:46,294 --> 00:43:49,330
Anyone of you did something bad. . .

634
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:53,813
And if he repents and corrects himself. . .

635
00:43:53,814 --> 00:43:57,089
And of course God is
merciful and compassionate.

636
00:43:58,774 --> 00:44:00,453
This holy verse. . .

637
00:44:00,453 --> 00:44:02,488
Doesn't precisely tell you what to do.

638
00:44:03,133 --> 00:44:07,011
But it's talking about mercy and forgiveness.

639
00:44:08,253 --> 00:44:10,004
I have a question, Haji.

640
00:44:10,893 --> 00:44:14,248
Hasn't the Qur'an given me the right
to ask for revenge?

641
00:44:14,773 --> 00:44:17,410
Doesn't it say murderers
should pay for their acts?

642
00:44:18,252 --> 00:44:20,091
Haven't I been subjected to injustice?

643
00:44:20,092 --> 00:44:22,558
So why does it keep putting
barriers in my way?

644
00:44:23,132 --> 00:44:25,331
It's as if I've done something wrong.

645
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:26,763
And I'm the oppressor.

646
00:44:27,091 --> 00:44:29,603
I swear to the prophet there is no one
else more oppressed than I am.

647
00:44:29,931 --> 00:44:33,445
Don't say something you might regret later.

648
00:44:37,491 --> 00:44:38,970
I won't forgive.

649
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:41,244
But God's happy if you do.

650
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:46,048
In that case God isn't just then.

651
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:48,049
Don't talk blasfemous.

652
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:49,846
I'm not.

653
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:53,363
But I'm upset with God too.

654
00:45:08,048 --> 00:45:12,087
We the residents of Shams Abad. . .

655
00:45:12,088 --> 00:45:14,123
The businessmen. . .

656
00:45:14,688 --> 00:45:17,407
The people of the mosque area. . .

657
00:45:17,408 --> 00:45:21,527
The workers of the textile factory. . .

658
00:45:21,527 --> 00:45:24,005
Testify that. . .

659
00:45:24,007 --> 00:45:27,486
Mr. Abolqasem Rahmati. . .

660
00:45:27,487 --> 00:45:29,726
The son of Karim

661
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:33,354
The father of the victim. . .

662
00:45:33,966 --> 00:45:36,564
And the fired worker. . .

663
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:39,032
Is ill. . .

664
00:45:41,246 --> 00:45:43,475
And in poverty

665
00:45:43,886 --> 00:45:45,685
And doesn't have the power. . .

666
00:45:45,685 --> 00:45:48,801
To pay for the blood money. . .

667
00:45:49,326 --> 00:45:51,525
Thus we are asking. . .

668
00:45:51,525 --> 00:45:54,721
For him to reach justice. . .

669
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,883
For this amount. . .

670
00:45:57,885 --> 00:45:59,924
To be paid by the government

671
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:01,564
And the verdict

672
00:46:01,564 --> 00:46:04,242
And the execution of the murderer

673
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:06,676
To be carried out.

674
00:46:11,604 --> 00:46:13,753
I took her to the doctor yesterday.

675
00:46:14,284 --> 00:46:16,003
He went over the tests.

676
00:46:16,004 --> 00:46:17,914
He said she can be operated on.

677
00:46:21,243 --> 00:46:23,516
Scratch out the fired worker part.

678
00:46:30,842 --> 00:46:33,001
But he said once she's older. . .

679
00:46:33,002 --> 00:46:35,196
The operation will be harder.

680
00:46:35,602 --> 00:46:37,637
It's too late already.

681
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:53,476
I want to do the surgery.

682
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,919
How much is it?

683
00:47:06,919 --> 00:47:08,670
There are a couple of operations.

684
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:10,478
He said about four million tomans.

685
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:12,116
Or perhaps less.

686
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,951
Write small so there will be enough
room for a lot of signatures.

687
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:18,430
Listen to me.

688
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:19,758
If I had that kind of a money. . .

689
00:47:19,758 --> 00:47:22,031
I'd pay the blood money to take
revenge for my daughter.

690
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:23,909
We won't pay anything.

691
00:47:25,879 --> 00:47:29,268
Instead of executing the boy. . .

692
00:47:30,158 --> 00:47:32,273
You can get the money from them.

693
00:47:52,276 --> 00:47:54,106
Rewrite it.

694
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:06,382
Let me see you.

695
00:49:08,311 --> 00:49:11,507
I would have thrown him under
the train if he weren't your husband.

696
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:17,945
Was I wrong for hitting him?

697
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,824
No, you were right!

698
00:49:21,469 --> 00:49:23,742
Why did you take my side
if I did the wrong thing?

699
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:26,940
You're my brother's friend.

700
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:29,180
Well, he is your husband.

701
00:49:29,789 --> 00:49:31,904
I'll take his side the next time.

701
00:49:34,869 --> 00:49:37,142
Why did you take my side
if I did the wrong thing?

701
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,340
You're my brother's friend.

701
00:49:40,909 --> 00:49:42,580
Well, he is your husband.

701
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:45,304
I'll take his side the next time.

702
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:50,939
All the injustice to the God's prophet.

703
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,985
All the problems caused for the
leader of the Muslims.

704
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,160
But he forgave.

705
00:49:59,048 --> 00:50:02,203
What's the first verse of the Holy Qur'an?

706
00:50:03,642 --> 00:50:06,258
It goes
In the name of God.

707
00:50:07,035 --> 00:50:10,860
That's right.
In the name of God.

712
00:50:12,068 --> 00:50:15,747
Our religion is the right religion.

713
00:50:15,927 --> 00:50:18,305
Why doesn't it say
In the name of the Angry God?

714
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,334
It says the Compassionate God.

715
00:50:20,335 --> 00:50:22,284
Well that tells us something.

716
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:24,367
Read the Holy Qur'an.

717
00:50:24,369 --> 00:50:25,547
Read it.

718
00:50:25,549 --> 00:50:28,984
So many verses about mercifullness
and forgiveness.

719
00:50:29,817 --> 00:50:32,914
Humans are the top of the creation.

720
00:50:34,016 --> 00:50:37,011
And humans are valuable
since they're God's creations.

721
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:40,139
Any kindness we do to any other
human beings. . .

722
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:41,918
Means we've done so to God.

723
00:50:45,228 --> 00:50:46,619
Peace be upon prophet Muhammad.

724
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:49,563
[ singing a song to the child ]

725
00:51:17,497 --> 00:51:19,141
Hi.

726
00:51:35,035 --> 00:51:37,913
What happened, Haji?

727
00:51:38,074 --> 00:51:39,844
I told you, sister.

728
00:51:39,945 --> 00:51:42,537
I can't do anything if you're in a hurry.

729
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,832
Sure, anything you say.

730
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:46,795
You can't blame him anyway.

731
00:51:47,097 --> 00:51:49,802
He feels if he gives consent. . .

732
00:51:49,804 --> 00:51:53,368
- He's made a deal over his girl's life.
- Hello, Haji.

733
00:51:53,871 --> 00:51:56,127
- Hello.
- So he doesn't agree?

733
00:51:56,289 --> 00:51:57,127
It's not something you do in a day or two.

734
00:51:57,337 --> 00:51:59,109
It takes time.

735
00:51:59,312 --> 00:52:00,444
But there is no time left, Haji.

736
00:52:00,445 --> 00:52:02,375
They're going to hang my brother.

737
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:05,998
You get the blood money as soon as you can.

738
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,974
I'll persuade him.

739
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:10,434
Really?

740
00:52:10,534 --> 00:52:12,619
I'll do it.

741
00:52:12,622 --> 00:52:14,462
Goodbye.

743
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:33,121
What is your name?

744
00:52:33,971 --> 00:52:35,930
Tell me your name.

745
00:52:35,931 --> 00:52:37,443
A'la.

746
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:40,450
Tell me it doesn't suit me.

747
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:42,167
What?

748
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:45,325
Tell me what your mother. . .

749
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:48,322
In uptown, what does she call you?

750
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,489
They all call me A'la.

751
00:52:51,489 --> 00:52:53,240
They call me Andy.

752
00:52:54,089 --> 00:52:56,044
Tell him to be serious.

753
00:52:58,169 --> 00:53:00,208
Ask him where his house is?

754
00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:02,244
Shahr-e-Ziba.

755
00:53:06,888 --> 00:53:08,605
Ask him how old he is.

756
00:53:09,608 --> 00:53:11,837
I'm younger than you are.
A couple of years.

757
00:53:12,488 --> 00:53:13,966
How old are you?

758
00:53:15,448 --> 00:53:17,403
Tell him a year old.

759
00:53:17,807 --> 00:53:19,444
I'm talking about you.

760
00:53:23,928 --> 00:53:25,599
Does it matter?

761
00:53:28,207 --> 00:53:29,321
No.

762
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:31,437
But you're older than me.

763
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:39,996
Do you what I thought the first
time I saw you?

764
00:53:41,046 --> 00:53:43,001
I thought you were about twenty three.

765
00:53:44,725 --> 00:53:46,316
What about now?

766
00:53:46,726 --> 00:53:48,078
Now. . .

767
00:53:48,686 --> 00:53:50,835
I think about thirty two.

768
00:53:59,725 --> 00:54:01,044
I don't want to.
It's too much.

769
00:54:01,044 --> 00:54:02,601
Eat it, don't be shy.

770
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:05,312
What is it?

771
00:54:05,884 --> 00:54:07,077
Nothing.

772
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,919
Can I take a smoke?

773
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,750
- No.
- Why not?

774
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,193
I don't like the women who smoke.

775
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,397
But I like it.

776
00:55:40,317 --> 00:55:41,756
How much, pal?

777
00:55:41,757 --> 00:55:43,276
Be my guest.

778
00:55:43,277 --> 00:55:44,994
Three thousand and three hundred.

779
00:56:04,155 --> 00:56:05,382
Hold on.

780
00:56:10,035 --> 00:56:11,387
I'll take you.

781
00:56:12,395 --> 00:56:13,827
No, I'll go by myself.

782
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:04,422
Will you come tomorrow?

783
00:57:07,431 --> 00:57:08,870
When should I come?

784
00:57:08,871 --> 00:57:10,670
Sooner.

785
00:57:10,671 --> 00:57:12,103
In the morning.

786
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,942
What?

787
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:27,947
At the hospital yesterday. . .

788
00:57:28,189 --> 00:57:30,108
Why did you ask me the reason
I went to the rehab?

789
00:57:30,109 --> 00:57:32,188
No reason.

790
00:57:32,189 --> 00:57:34,655
You asked for Akbar's money.

791
00:57:36,468 --> 00:57:38,227
I have to come up with that money.

792
00:57:38,228 --> 00:57:39,987
I can do it.

793
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,828
You hate women who smoke. . .

794
00:57:41,828 --> 00:57:43,627
And I hate men who are thieves.

795
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:44,667
And keep stealing.

796
00:57:44,668 --> 00:57:46,941
They're constantly in and out of prison.

797
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,299
Why haven't you gone to work yet?

798
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,051
I'm tired.

799
00:59:52,419 --> 00:59:53,738
Take this.

800
00:59:53,738 --> 00:59:55,409
I quit.

801
01:00:04,497 --> 01:00:06,293
There they come again.

802
01:00:13,337 --> 01:00:15,935
Take these inside, Firouzeh.

803
01:00:15,937 --> 01:00:18,244
I'm talking to you.
They'll arrest me.

804
01:00:22,736 --> 01:00:24,575
- Hello, officer.
- Shut the place down.

805
01:00:24,576 --> 01:00:26,566
I swear I'm working legal here.

806
01:00:26,616 --> 01:00:27,775
Close it down.

807
01:00:27,776 --> 01:00:30,005
Where are you taking me?

808
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:31,928
Let go of my hand.

809
01:00:31,976 --> 01:00:35,047
I swear I've been here for three years.

810
01:00:46,575 --> 01:00:49,774
The guy wants to move to Tehran.

811
01:00:49,774 --> 01:00:51,889
His money is honest.

812
01:00:52,934 --> 01:00:54,093
Is it cash?

813
01:00:54,094 --> 01:00:57,403
It's enough cash to solve your problem.

814
01:00:57,933 --> 01:00:59,650
I'll guarantee him.

815
01:01:00,293 --> 01:01:01,572
He's a friend.

816
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,613
He'll pay the rest bit by bit.

817
01:01:03,613 --> 01:01:05,012
I know him.

818
01:01:05,013 --> 01:01:06,972
I've found a place for you too.

819
01:01:06,973 --> 01:01:09,167
The rent is not much
and you can handle it.

820
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:12,851
Forget the building.
You have to price the land.

821
01:01:13,573 --> 01:01:15,528
Should we write up the contract?

822
01:01:16,532 --> 01:01:18,651
- Sure.
- Here you are.

823
01:01:18,652 --> 01:01:20,131
Does it have city gas?

824
01:01:20,132 --> 01:01:22,326
The plumbing is done.
It'll be connected anytime now.

825
01:01:23,852 --> 01:01:25,364
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

826
01:01:33,491 --> 01:01:35,048
What's wrong ma'am?

827
01:01:42,731 --> 01:01:44,650
Go to the clergy in the mosque. . .

828
01:01:44,651 --> 01:01:46,370
Tell him Abolqasem is selling his house.

829
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:48,280
Bring him over.

830
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:57,003
Like I said before. . .

831
01:01:57,129 --> 01:01:59,487
It's up to him.

832
01:01:59,489 --> 01:02:00,568
He's not a kid.

833
01:02:00,569 --> 01:02:02,479
You can't force him.

834
01:02:02,769 --> 01:02:05,047
Legally he's got the right to anyway.

835
01:02:05,049 --> 01:02:07,088
He can ask for execution.

836
01:02:07,089 --> 01:02:08,648
What do you mean?

837
01:02:08,648 --> 01:02:10,807
Is it right for him to ruin his family?

838
01:02:10,808 --> 01:02:13,206
To pay the blood money to execute
his child's murderer?

839
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:16,287
Are you worried for his family
or thinking of your friend?

840
01:02:16,288 --> 01:02:18,007
It's to his advantage too.

841
01:02:18,008 --> 01:02:20,646
Instead of the execution he'll
get some money to cure that girl.

842
01:02:20,648 --> 01:02:22,717
This is a better of a good deed.

843
01:02:23,088 --> 01:02:25,043
Since when you can decide on what's good?

844
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:29,561
You aren't entitled to decide
what's good and what's not.

845
01:02:29,767 --> 01:02:31,406
Why?

846
01:02:31,407 --> 01:02:34,246
A five year old child can distinguish
between the two.

847
01:02:34,247 --> 01:02:37,766
Yes, this way a life is saved.

848
01:02:37,766 --> 01:02:42,156
But the society is not safe.

849
01:02:42,846 --> 01:02:44,244
[ reading the Holy Quran ]

850
01:02:50,125 --> 01:02:53,724
Do you know if an unwanted
person is executed. . .

851
01:02:53,725 --> 01:02:55,924
How big of a good deed it is to others?

852
01:02:55,925 --> 01:02:57,644
What unwanted?

853
01:02:57,645 --> 01:02:59,923
My friend is a very nice boy.

854
01:02:59,924 --> 01:03:02,561
How did he commit murder then?

855
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:05,004
He was young and stupid, only sixteen.

856
01:03:05,004 --> 01:03:06,443
He was in love and blind.

857
01:03:06,444 --> 01:03:08,363
He was going to kill himself too.

858
01:03:08,364 --> 01:03:11,203
I have to pray first anyway.

859
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,762
You do the same for now.

860
01:03:13,964 --> 01:03:16,875
He'll sell the house if we don't rush there.

861
01:03:16,924 --> 01:03:19,282
He won't give consent if
he puts the blood money together.

862
01:03:19,284 --> 01:03:21,882
- What do you suggest me do?
- Go now if possible.

863
01:03:21,883 --> 01:03:24,082
- Hello.
- Hello.

864
01:03:24,082 --> 01:03:25,921
The people are waiting for me.

865
01:03:25,923 --> 01:03:29,278
- Is praying more important than saving a life?
- Yes, it is.

866
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:32,641
I'll send someone to bring him here.

867
01:03:37,762 --> 01:03:39,401
Come to the agency and
take the cheques tomorrow.

868
01:03:39,402 --> 01:03:41,481
Don't forget the documents too.

869
01:03:41,482 --> 01:03:44,712
- The whole thing.
- God bless you.

870
01:03:45,081 --> 01:03:46,752
Bye.

871
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,390
Is your cheque money?

872
01:03:50,481 --> 01:03:51,913
It's cash.

873
01:03:54,161 --> 01:03:55,480
It was meant to be.

874
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,798
You couldn't have found a better
house than that. . .

875
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,999
And he wouldn't have found a buying
customer in this neighborhood anytime soon.

876
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,278
I'll come to see you at the agency, thanks.

877
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,235
- Bye.
- Bye.

878
01:04:34,197 --> 01:04:36,916
It's nothing personal.

879
01:04:36,917 --> 01:04:39,475
I don't want your family to get tortured.

880
01:04:40,357 --> 01:04:43,035
- Says who?
- Your wife's heart isn't in this.

881
01:04:43,037 --> 01:04:46,745
And I don't want to have the curse
of your family on me all my life.

882
01:04:53,197 --> 01:04:55,396
And take this from me. . .

883
01:04:55,396 --> 01:04:57,355
Don't treat your family like this.

884
01:04:57,356 --> 01:04:59,435
Don't break their hearts.

885
01:04:59,436 --> 01:05:01,948
This is more urgent than anything else.

886
01:05:04,516 --> 01:05:07,187
You'll excuse me, bye.

887
01:05:11,195 --> 01:05:14,903
- It's alright.
- Bye.

888
01:05:25,954 --> 01:05:27,705
It's over.

889
01:05:28,874 --> 01:05:30,943
Thanks a lot.

890
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:39,706
What are you doing?

891
01:05:43,632 --> 01:05:46,230
Someone help me.

892
01:05:46,232 --> 01:05:48,539
Help me.

893
01:05:52,231 --> 01:05:54,061
Somayeh!

894
01:05:56,671 --> 01:06:00,549
You're crazy
and have driven us crazy too.

895
01:06:01,231 --> 01:06:02,822
Two years.

896
01:06:05,071 --> 01:06:09,585
You want me to live in rented houses
with this handicaped girl?

897
01:06:11,231 --> 01:06:13,743
How could you be so vengeful?

898
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:19,068
Don't I own a part of this house?

899
01:06:19,069 --> 01:06:20,988
I won't sell.

900
01:06:20,990 --> 01:06:24,868
I would have done so years ago
to spend it on my daughter's treatment.

901
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:29,105
You're not worried about your kid.
You're only concerned with your share.

902
01:06:30,349 --> 01:06:32,388
I would not have married you. . .

903
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:35,227
If that was the case.

904
01:06:35,228 --> 01:06:37,067
Why are you embarrassed?

905
01:06:37,068 --> 01:06:40,184
Just tell me you wanted a servant
and not a wife.

906
01:06:41,149 --> 01:06:43,218
I've worked so hard for you.

907
01:06:44,988 --> 01:06:47,420
Ever since the day I stepped in this house. . .

908
01:06:47,788 --> 01:06:50,300
You've never treated me decently once.

909
01:06:51,027 --> 01:06:54,018
Have you ever touched me
except for beating me up?

910
01:06:55,627 --> 01:06:58,584
I came into this house with my girl. . .

911
01:06:59,426 --> 01:07:01,984
So you'd be a father to her.

912
01:07:03,387 --> 01:07:07,095
Didn't I do so much for your girl?

913
01:07:08,027 --> 01:07:10,221
Why won't you let go?

914
01:07:10,306 --> 01:07:13,103
Your wife died, and so did your girl.

915
01:07:13,346 --> 01:07:15,904
You won't bring them back to life
by killing yourself.

916
01:07:35,344 --> 01:07:36,983
Somayeh!

917
01:07:36,984 --> 01:07:39,019
Let's go, dear.

918
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:43,974
Do you want me to take your hand?

919
01:09:02,737 --> 01:09:04,496
Thanks.

920
01:09:04,498 --> 01:09:06,417
Her uncle's house is here.

921
01:09:06,418 --> 01:09:08,294
We'll manage from here.

922
01:09:39,615 --> 01:09:41,922
I'm not here to get your consent.

923
01:09:45,934 --> 01:09:48,321
I just want to say something and leave.

924
01:09:50,654 --> 01:09:53,291
I went to see Akbar today.

925
01:09:53,974 --> 01:09:56,566
I told him you won't change your mind.

926
01:09:58,534 --> 01:10:01,366
He doesn't have hope to get
your consent anymore.

927
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:05,244
He knows he'll be executed in a little while.

928
01:10:06,573 --> 01:10:09,210
But he wanted me to tell you something.

929
01:10:10,732 --> 01:10:12,801
He said that he doesn't want the blood money.

930
01:10:14,253 --> 01:10:16,971
And so don't sell your house
to come up with it.

931
01:10:17,972 --> 01:10:20,929
He said he'd consent to be executed
without the blood money.

932
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:25,444
Just make sure he's executed
as soon as possible.

933
01:10:27,972 --> 01:10:30,121
And he finally said. . .

934
01:10:32,091 --> 01:10:34,285
To tell you. . .

935
01:10:34,331 --> 01:10:36,366
To forgive him.

936
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:48,207
Tell them to bring the blood money.

937
01:10:56,209 --> 01:10:58,596
I'll give my consent.

938
01:10:59,609 --> 01:11:01,564
God bless you, Haji.

939
01:11:01,928 --> 01:11:03,758
You're the best.

940
01:12:17,203 --> 01:12:19,272
- What is it?
- He gave consent.

941
01:12:19,843 --> 01:12:22,196
He gave consent not to execute Akbar.

942
01:12:23,963 --> 01:12:27,202
- You're lying.
- I swear to God.

943
01:12:27,202 --> 01:12:29,157
Akbar won't be executed.

944
01:12:29,642 --> 01:12:31,321
Are you serious?

945
01:12:31,323 --> 01:12:33,472
I swear to God.

946
01:12:37,082 --> 01:12:39,276
Thank you God.

947
01:12:40,521 --> 01:12:43,273
He gave consent.

948
01:12:45,641 --> 01:12:47,480
He says Akbar won't be executed.

949
01:12:47,481 --> 01:12:49,152
He'll be free.

950
01:12:50,481 --> 01:12:52,675
He said it himself.

951
01:12:55,641 --> 01:12:57,790
Oh God, he gave consent.

952
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,194
I ran all the way to here.

953
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,229
We have to tell Akbar.

954
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:40,708
Where are you going?

955
01:13:41,237 --> 01:13:43,590
I came by to tell you this.

956
01:13:43,917 --> 01:13:45,588
A'la!

957
01:13:49,837 --> 01:13:52,190
Why didn't you come today?

958
01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:55,907
I didn't go to work.
I thought you'd come for sure.

959
01:13:56,436 --> 01:13:58,789
I kept waiting by the window.

960
01:14:01,555 --> 01:14:03,434
I don't like it.

961
01:14:03,436 --> 01:14:06,347
- Me?
- No, myself.

962
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:08,426
Why?

963
01:14:09,315 --> 01:14:12,943
Akbar sent me here to get consent.

964
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,954
Not to back stab him.

965
01:14:14,954 --> 01:14:17,069
What back stab?

966
01:14:18,194 --> 01:14:20,786
You have a husband, it's not right.

967
01:14:21,395 --> 01:14:23,544
I'm not the type.

968
01:14:26,874 --> 01:14:29,306
Where do you sleep at night?

969
01:14:30,713 --> 01:14:33,465
Anywhere possible.
In the park or the terminal.

970
01:14:34,353 --> 01:14:35,751
Don't leave.

971
01:14:36,073 --> 01:14:38,188
Stay.

972
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:28,180
Sleep in here.

973
01:15:32,829 --> 01:15:34,988
What if your husband comes?

974
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:37,068
I don't have a husband.

975
01:15:37,069 --> 01:15:40,583
Isn't he the father of your kid then?

976
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:43,067
That's all he is.

977
01:15:43,068 --> 01:15:45,297
I divorced him a year and half ago.

978
01:15:46,068 --> 01:15:47,707
But you are together.

979
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:50,220
But everything between us is separated.

980
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:53,743
What is this on your finger then?

981
01:15:55,708 --> 01:15:58,987
How do you think I've been living
in this neighborhood?

982
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:01,102
Just like this.

983
01:16:01,587 --> 01:16:04,783
A ring, and an addict
whom everyone thinks is my husband.

984
01:16:06,587 --> 01:16:09,498
Here if you don't have a man...

985
01:16:09,986 --> 01:16:12,105
You'll be faced with a hundred
men every night.

986
01:16:12,106 --> 01:16:14,300
Why did you divorce him?

987
01:16:16,785 --> 01:16:19,584
I didn't want to have to sell myself. . .

988
01:16:19,585 --> 01:16:22,143
Everytime he got hard up to make
money for his fix.

989
01:16:25,345 --> 01:16:27,384
Where is he now?

990
01:16:27,384 --> 01:16:31,262
Don't worry, he won't be released
anytime sooner than a month.

991
01:16:32,664 --> 01:16:34,494
Sleep.

992
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:35,299
I'm a lonely woman with a child.

993
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:38,059
I get paid fifty grand a month
and I have to pay rent with that too.

994
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:40,819
Even if I put everything I have together. . .

995
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:42,699
I may stretch it to be three hundred grand.

996
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:45,017
Let's say I get a loan too.
It'll be seven hundred grand.

997
01:17:45,019 --> 01:17:47,778
What will I tell Abolqasem
with seven hundred grand?

998
01:17:47,779 --> 01:17:51,098
Ask him to forgive his girl's murderer
with that money?

999
01:17:51,098 --> 01:17:53,496
I swear I wouldn't have hesitated
if I had the money.

1000
01:17:53,498 --> 01:17:55,257
Why did you keep coming here then. . .

1001
01:17:55,258 --> 01:17:58,297
And forced me to work on the old
man to give consent?

1002
01:17:58,298 --> 01:18:00,656
Would you like me to talk to
the doctors at the hospital?

1003
01:18:00,658 --> 01:18:01,897
They might be less expensive.

1004
01:18:01,897 --> 01:18:04,215
Not every doctor can do this operation.

1005
01:18:04,217 --> 01:18:07,576
The expert doctors said she might
become paralyzed after the surgery.

1006
01:18:07,578 --> 01:18:09,697
Let alone those fake doctors.

1007
01:18:09,697 --> 01:18:11,496
You be in my shoe.
What would you have me do?

1008
01:18:11,497 --> 01:18:13,096
What can I do?

1009
01:18:13,097 --> 01:18:15,735
Can't you let me know soon
so the old man makes his decision. . .

1010
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:17,567
To have the boy executed?

1011
01:18:17,736 --> 01:18:21,255
He hasn't been sleeping nor eating
ever since he's decided to give consent.

1012
01:18:21,257 --> 01:18:23,167
He's about to have a heart attack.

1013
01:18:27,296 --> 01:18:29,888
Take your fruits with you as well.

1014
01:18:41,575 --> 01:18:43,334
I'll come up with the money.

1015
01:18:43,335 --> 01:18:45,254
- How?
- Never mind how.

1016
01:18:45,255 --> 01:18:46,934
Don't even talk about it.

1017
01:18:46,934 --> 01:18:49,653
So you want him get executed
for a couple of millions?

1018
01:18:49,654 --> 01:18:51,653
I keep telling you I hate men like that.

1019
01:18:51,654 --> 01:18:53,333
So what?

1020
01:18:53,334 --> 01:18:55,812
Who are you anyway to be preaching me?

1021
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:57,453
Don't I have the right to know?

1022
01:18:57,454 --> 01:19:00,172
- You don't know. . .
- I don't want you to go to prison.

1023
01:19:00,933 --> 01:19:03,451
I swear to God I won't.

1024
01:19:03,453 --> 01:19:06,372
I know my work.
I've done this many times.

1025
01:19:06,373 --> 01:19:09,444
Is that why you've spent seven
years of your life behind the bars?

1026
01:19:10,813 --> 01:19:13,086
I'll show you now.

1027
01:19:13,372 --> 01:19:14,971
A'la!

1028
01:19:14,973 --> 01:19:17,122
Don't go for God's sake.

1029
01:19:24,172 --> 01:19:26,207
Okay, stop.

1030
01:19:29,411 --> 01:19:31,923
For me.

1031
01:19:35,371 --> 01:19:37,689
Suppose I had the money to loan it to you. . .

1032
01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:39,806
It's just spending good money after bad.

1033
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:43,889
Remember how you sold your life
to have her operated on?

1034
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:45,609
Did it make a difference though?

1035
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:48,689
What if she becomes paralyzed after
the surgery?

1036
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:50,329
What will you do then?

1037
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:53,889
She'll be a piece of meat for
the rest of her life.

1038
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:57,088
That stupid Abolqasem doesn't
have a good head.

1039
01:19:57,089 --> 01:19:58,888
You have to be wise.

1040
01:19:58,889 --> 01:20:03,438
I've been wanting to tell you something
for a couple of days now.

1041
01:20:04,409 --> 01:20:07,320
- But I'm embarrassed.
- What is it?

1042
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:10,247
There is a boy. . .

1043
01:20:10,248 --> 01:20:13,364
The one I told you who comes
and goes for the consent. . .

1044
01:20:14,928 --> 01:20:17,122
He's a simple kid.

1045
01:20:18,407 --> 01:20:21,078
I thought now that they
don't have the money. . .

1046
01:20:21,927 --> 01:20:23,766
Is he a clean kid?

1047
01:20:23,767 --> 01:20:26,085
He's got guts, that's obvious.

1048
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:27,486
He went through hell and high water.

1049
01:20:27,487 --> 01:20:30,085
Until he forced Abolqasem
to give consent.

1050
01:20:30,087 --> 01:20:32,046
That's great.

1051
01:20:32,046 --> 01:20:34,684
Your girl is handicaped
but not in the brain.

1052
01:20:34,686 --> 01:20:37,164
Let him have her.

1053
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:39,165
What if it's imposing the boy?

1054
01:20:39,166 --> 01:20:40,885
What? You've been imposed.

1055
01:20:40,886 --> 01:20:43,845
You have a stupid husband and
a handicaped girl.

1056
01:20:43,846 --> 01:20:47,285
But if he doesn't want your girl
he can come up witht he blood money then.

1057
01:20:47,286 --> 01:20:49,003
So the boy doesn't get executed.

1058
01:20:52,165 --> 01:20:53,916
Ten.

1059
01:21:15,043 --> 01:21:17,555
Why won't you tell him personally?

1060
01:21:18,323 --> 01:21:20,681
That's not right.

1061
01:21:20,683 --> 01:21:24,152
I don't want him to claim that my
girl was given to him by force later on.

1062
01:21:24,403 --> 01:21:27,242
You talk to him and send him over.

1063
01:21:27,243 --> 01:21:29,402
In fact tell him in your own words.

1064
01:21:29,403 --> 01:21:32,242
Tell him you've found a good girl for him.

1065
01:21:32,243 --> 01:21:34,601
Make him like her slowly.

1066
01:21:34,602 --> 01:21:36,681
You women know how to talk to each other.

1067
01:21:36,682 --> 01:21:38,841
Hopefully when they're wedded. . .

1068
01:21:38,842 --> 01:21:41,200
We'll take Abolqasem to the court.

1069
01:21:41,202 --> 01:21:44,193
To give consent so your brother is freed.

1070
01:22:54,236 --> 01:22:56,146
What did they want here?

1071
01:22:56,556 --> 01:22:58,863
The same thing.

1072
01:23:00,275 --> 01:23:02,424
Why did you cry then?

1073
01:23:03,315 --> 01:23:05,430
They want money.

1074
01:23:05,475 --> 01:23:07,907
We already knew that
they didn't need to come here for that.

1075
01:23:08,195 --> 01:23:11,034
They want the whole blood money
not just four million.

1076
01:23:11,035 --> 01:23:13,342
Bullshit.
That's what they said before.

1077
01:23:13,674 --> 01:23:15,553
What's the difference?
I don't have the money. . .

1078
01:23:15,555 --> 01:23:17,704
Whether it's four or ten million.

1079
01:23:18,594 --> 01:23:20,901
- Did you tell them you didn't have it?
- Yeah.

1080
01:23:24,594 --> 01:23:25,753
It's useless though.

1081
01:23:25,754 --> 01:23:28,152
They're looking for an excuse
to execute Akbar.

1082
01:23:28,154 --> 01:23:30,541
They're going over their words.

1083
01:23:31,393 --> 01:23:32,871
Take this.

1084
01:23:33,514 --> 01:23:35,549
Thanks a lot.

1085
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:38,352
- Where are you going?
- They have to stand by their words.

1086
01:23:38,352 --> 01:23:40,551
Don't go.
I know how to convince them.

1087
01:23:40,552 --> 01:23:42,701
- You go in.
- Why are you scared of them?

1088
01:23:43,392 --> 01:23:44,949
A'la!

1089
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:12,140
Is someone here?

1090
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:14,307
A'la.

1091
01:24:27,789 --> 01:24:29,665
Give it to me, dear.

1092
01:24:29,989 --> 01:24:32,068
Go and get freshened up a bit.

1093
01:24:32,068 --> 01:24:34,027
Put on my colored scarf.

1094
01:24:34,029 --> 01:24:35,780
Come in quickly.

1095
01:24:40,469 --> 01:24:42,822
Hello.

1096
01:24:44,188 --> 01:24:46,267
Why don't you eat something?

1097
01:24:46,268 --> 01:24:48,067
- Do you want me to cut them up for you?
- No, I don't.

1098
01:24:48,067 --> 01:24:49,863
I'll eat.

1099
01:24:50,387 --> 01:24:52,979
- Did Firouzeh tell you to come here?
- Yeah.

1100
01:24:53,307 --> 01:24:56,264
She's a nice girl.
She wants the best for you.

1101
01:24:57,147 --> 01:25:01,185
She's talked to me about
you a couple of times.

1102
01:25:01,546 --> 01:25:04,582
I told her it's all up to fate.

1103
01:25:20,065 --> 01:25:22,897
Eat something.

1104
01:25:25,305 --> 01:25:28,660
Didn't you bring sugar cubes dear?

1105
01:25:29,225 --> 01:25:32,614
She panics everytime someone
comes to propose to her.

1106
01:25:33,904 --> 01:25:35,863
I'll get them.

1107
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:38,058
Talk to the guest, dear.

1108
01:26:17,382 --> 01:26:19,133
Hello.

1109
01:26:19,461 --> 01:26:21,973
- What?
- We got a guest.

1110
01:26:22,821 --> 01:26:26,460
The boy who comes here for consent.

1111
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:27,938
- What does he want here?
- It's a good thing.

1112
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:29,259
I'll tell you.

1113
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:31,011
Come here.

1114
01:27:37,375 --> 01:27:39,773
- Hey, mister!
- Firouzeh!

1115
01:27:39,775 --> 01:27:41,894
- Leave please.
- I'm talking to you, Firouzeh.

1116
01:27:41,895 --> 01:27:43,694
Please leave,

1117
01:27:43,695 --> 01:27:47,289
- Mister, please.
- Firouzeh!

1118
01:27:51,134 --> 01:27:52,612
Firouzeh!

1119
01:27:52,894 --> 01:27:54,246
Firouzeh!

1120
01:28:03,253 --> 01:28:05,292
Why are you running from me?

1121
01:28:05,293 --> 01:28:07,372
I'm late, what is it?

1122
01:28:07,373 --> 01:28:09,012
What should I do?

1123
01:28:09,013 --> 01:28:11,479
- What about?
- The condition they have.

1124
01:28:12,252 --> 01:28:14,091
What can I say?

1125
01:28:14,093 --> 01:28:17,012
I can't tell you to marry her
to save my brother.

1126
01:28:17,012 --> 01:28:18,967
I'm stupid, I'll do it if you want me to.

1127
01:28:20,332 --> 01:28:22,242
What should I do, Firouzeh?

1128
01:28:22,772 --> 01:28:24,648
She's a nice girl.

1129
01:28:25,052 --> 01:28:27,087
- So are you.
- Me?

1130
01:28:27,651 --> 01:28:30,483
I have a child.
I'm older than you.

1131
01:28:30,971 --> 01:28:32,490
I'm not good for you.

1132
01:28:32,491 --> 01:28:34,530
But you were good for me
till just a few days ago.

1133
01:28:34,530 --> 01:28:36,803
When did I ever tell you that?

1134
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:46,204
You think I'm in love with you just
because I was good to you for a while?

1135
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:50,009
I noticed you were busting your
bones for my brother Akbar. . .

1136
01:28:50,010 --> 01:28:51,889
So I was kind to you.

1137
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:54,039
You're lying.

1138
01:28:55,289 --> 01:28:57,927
You want to force me to marry her
for your brother's sake.

1139
01:28:57,929 --> 01:29:00,008
Don't then, if you don't want to.

1140
01:29:00,009 --> 01:29:02,441
Why should you sacrifice yourself for Akbar?

1141
01:29:02,529 --> 01:29:04,882
I'm just telling you not to count on me.

1142
01:29:05,888 --> 01:29:08,241
- Hold on.
- I'm late.

1143
01:29:47,886 --> 01:29:49,477
Shahr-e-Ziba.

1144
01:29:50,486 --> 01:29:51,964
Shahr-e-Ziba.

1145
01:29:52,965 --> 01:29:54,556
Shahr-e-Ziba.

1146
01:29:56,525 --> 01:29:58,364
- Shahr-e-Ziba.
- Which part?

1147
01:29:58,365 --> 01:30:00,604
- The rehab.
- Where is that?

1148
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:02,355
The Rehabilitation Center.

1149
01:30:03,044 --> 01:30:06,479
Amininan.

1150
01:30:13,683 --> 01:30:15,882
You have to make the decision.

1151
01:30:15,883 --> 01:30:17,395
I can't.

1152
01:30:17,883 --> 01:30:20,270
That's why I'm here.

1153
01:30:20,323 --> 01:30:22,755
Does his sister love you?

1154
01:30:23,363 --> 01:30:24,875
A lot.

1155
01:30:25,083 --> 01:30:27,595
Can you forget her?

1156
01:30:27,963 --> 01:30:31,352
- No.
- Marry her then.

1157
01:30:32,842 --> 01:30:34,752
What about Akbar then?

1158
01:30:35,322 --> 01:30:38,681
Do you know why Akbar killed that girl?

1159
01:30:38,682 --> 01:30:40,319
He loved her.

1160
01:30:40,801 --> 01:30:43,712
How can you kill someone you love?

1161
01:30:43,962 --> 01:30:45,841
He didn't want for someone else to have her.

1162
01:30:45,841 --> 01:30:48,273
What would you do
if you were in Akbar's shoe?

1163
01:30:49,681 --> 01:30:51,716
Would you have killed the girl as well?

1164
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,799
I'd have forgotten her.

1165
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,879
So you can forget someone you love.

1166
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,153
Right?

1167
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,317
You can forget Akbar's sister too
if that's possible.

1168
01:31:04,799 --> 01:31:07,835
No, it's not.

1169
01:31:09,399 --> 01:31:12,231
- Remember Shahin?
- Yeah.

1170
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,278
Remember why he had committed murder?

1171
01:31:16,279 --> 01:31:18,158
They didn't have the money
to pay for her mother's debts. . .

1172
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:20,238
So they had to kill the guy.

1173
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:21,466
Yeah.

1174
01:31:22,878 --> 01:31:24,913
Shahin didn't have a father.

1175
01:31:25,678 --> 01:31:27,747
He loved his mother.

1176
01:31:28,318 --> 01:31:32,390
He didn't want her mother to go to
prison for her heavy debt.

1177
01:31:33,398 --> 01:31:35,513
He couldn't bear it.

1178
01:31:35,758 --> 01:31:38,715
He killed the man
in order not to lose his mother.

1179
01:31:40,197 --> 01:31:42,629
- Do you think he did the right thing?
- No.

1180
01:31:45,157 --> 01:31:48,396
What would you do?

1181
01:31:48,396 --> 01:31:51,235
Would you have killed the guy
or have forgotten your mother?

1182
01:31:51,237 --> 01:31:53,510
I'd have forgotten my mother.

1183
01:31:53,716 --> 01:31:56,673
So it is possible to forget someone you love.

1184
01:31:58,715 --> 01:32:00,874
No, it's not.

1185
01:32:00,876 --> 01:32:02,115
I can't.

1186
01:32:02,116 --> 01:32:05,551
It's easy to tell others to forget.

1187
01:32:05,995 --> 01:32:10,314
The judges who gave death sentences
to Akbar and Shahin and others. . .

1188
01:32:10,315 --> 01:32:12,509
They too thought the same.

1189
01:32:13,835 --> 01:32:15,314
What should I do, Mr. Ghafouri?

1190
01:32:15,314 --> 01:32:19,192
I would have forgotten about
Akbar's sister if I were you.

1191
01:32:19,714 --> 01:32:23,467
But I may fall in love some day
and won't be able to forget.

1192
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:27,871
Even if it's at the price of someone's death.

1193
01:32:32,274 --> 01:32:34,073
Go and see the guys.

1194
01:32:34,073 --> 01:32:36,302
Think it over, I'll be right here.

1195
01:33:01,071 --> 01:33:03,150
If this boy marries your girl. . .

1196
01:33:03,151 --> 01:33:06,270
He'll destroy his and her life both.

1197
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:08,429
I know this boy.

1198
01:33:08,430 --> 01:33:12,104
This condition is neither to yours
nor his advantage.

1199
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:15,989
It's been two years.

1200
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:18,377
Take off the black shirt.

1201
01:33:27,269 --> 01:33:29,735
- Don't unwrap it.
- Why not though?

1202
01:33:33,509 --> 01:33:35,188
I won't give consent.

1203
01:33:35,188 --> 01:33:37,620
I won't step out of this house
unless I get your consent.

1204
01:33:37,621 --> 01:33:38,991
Leave me alone for God's sake.

1205
01:33:38,992 --> 01:33:41,593
Why do you keep torturing me?

1206
01:35:06,862 --> 01:35:08,840
Move away from the door.

1207
01:37:08,967 --> 01:37:11,431
"THE END"

1208
01:37:25,657 --> 01:37:29,418
