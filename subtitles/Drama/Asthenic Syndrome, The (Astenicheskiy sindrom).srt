1
00:00:33,974 --> 00:00:36,379
[ I've been<br>temporarily suspended. ]

2
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:38,879
[ So you cannot use my name<br>to reserve an operating room. ]

3
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:43,789
[ Use Park Sun-woo's<br>name instead. ]

4
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:49,629
[ Dr. Cha Tae-jin will do everything<br>to stop this surgery. ]

5
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:55,829
[ I will pretend to give up<br>the surgery reluctantly. ]

6
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:57,739
[ Kang Eun-hyun. ]

7
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,839
[ Before the surgery starts, ]

8
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,299
[ you have to get the information<br>on what kind of side effects ]

9
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,549
[ he will inflict on Dr. Oh. ]

10
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:09,509
[ Can you do that? ]

11
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:13,419
[ I'll try my best. ]

12
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:17,619
[ Lee Hae-jo, be the<br>second assistant in this surgery. ]

13
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:18,929
[ Yes, sir. ]

14
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:20,629
[ When the time comes... ]

15
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:22,369
[ you will come<br>outside to send... ]

16
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,029
[ the tumor tissue<br>to pathology. ]

17
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:30,189
[ Before Lee Hae-jo<br>sends it to pathology... ]

18
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:34,419
[ I will check Dr. Cha Tae-jin's<br>previous records... ]

19
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:37,679
[ and I will find out which<br>area he'll operate on. ]

20
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:39,739
[ Then I'll tell<br>Dr. Lee Hae-jo... ]

21
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:42,999
[ which part of the<br>cranial nerve he will touch. ]

22
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:46,369
[ Change the surgical... ]

23
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:49,559
[ equipment right before... ]

24
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,889
[ Cha Tae-jin<br>makes a move. ]

25
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:54,559
[ This is customized equipment... ]

26
00:01:55,529 --> 00:02:00,029
[ to prevent damage<br>to cranial nerves. ]

27
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,509
[ Min Sung-joon. ]

28
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:10,829
[ Can you accurately<br>pinpoint which area... ]

29
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,609
[ he'll operate in such... ]

30
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:14,519
[ a short amount of time? ]

31
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:16,919
[ It's not a matter of<br>whether I can or cannot. ]

32
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:20,049
[ I must make it happen. ]

33
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,309
[ What if there are... ]

34
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,109
[ changes to the plan... ]

35
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:26,859
[ what do we do? ]

36
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,019
[ It'd be best... ]

37
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:33,449
[ if everything goes<br>according to plan. ]

38
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:36,169
[ But even if<br>something goes wrong... ]

39
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:41,289
[ and the worst case<br>scenario happens... ]

40
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:43,819
[ I'll be fine. ]

41
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:48,109
[ I'm prepared for it. ]

42
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:04,969
Mom.

43
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:10,179
We'll give you<br>anesthesia now.

44
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:11,489
Okay.

45
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:52,149
I clearly told you not to go<br>near an operating room...

46
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:56,149
and that you cannot<br>do any surgeries.

47
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:58,679
Stop this surgery at once.

48
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:01,419
What if I don't?

49
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,149
What is your reason...

50
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:05,009
for booking the<br>surgery room secretly...

51
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:08,619
at dawn under the name<br>of Dr. Park Sun-woo?

52
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:12,229
You would probably<br>know that already.

53
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:15,469
As the chairman, I d<br>o not permit this.

54
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:16,699
If you insist...

55
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:19,039
on this surgery,

56
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:21,349
you will have to<br>leave this hospital.

57
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:23,249
Even if this surgery...

58
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,479
is my final one here...

59
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:28,669
it doesn't matter.

60
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,749
You don't care...

61
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,469
that the whole<br>world finds out...

62
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:38,289
Cha Yeo-wook is your son?

63
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,059
Same thing<br>goes for you...

64
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:45,959
we all have secrets.

65
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:48,999
Dr. Kang Eun-hyun too.

66
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:02,379
[ Dr. Kang Eun-hyun. ]

67
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,559
[ Before you see Dr. Cha... ]

68
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:11,219
[ there is something<br>you must know first. ]

69
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:21,029
[ Yeo-wook is... ]

70
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:25,319
[ not Dr. Cha Tae-jin's son. ]

71
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:32,379
[ What... ]

72
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,909
[ do you mean? ]

73
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:38,209
[ Dr. Cha knows<br>about this too. ]

74
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,339
[ We will use<br>Yeo-wook's matter ]

75
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:42,629
[ to discreetly turn over ]

76
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:45,229
[ the surgery to<br>Dr. Cha Tae-jin. ]

77
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:47,899
[ Kang Eun-hyun. ]

78
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:52,029
[ You take care of this. ]

79
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:53,609
[ What do I... ]

80
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:57,239
[ need to do? ]

81
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,389
If you don't stop<br>the surgery...

82
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,409
I will use physical force.

83
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:08,649
You are willing to do that?

84
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:11,289
No use in hiding it.

85
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:17,999
Dr. Kang Eun-hyun.

86
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:24,459
I have something to say<br>to Dr. Min Sung-joon.

87
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:28,389
You have something...

88
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:29,859
to say to me?

89
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:30,869
Yes.

90
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:37,379
I heard you will perform<br>Dr. Oh's tumor surgery.

91
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:42,379
How dare you decide<br>on this without...

92
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,229
consulting with<br>the chief resident.

93
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:48,959
Not to mention you're<br>currently suspended from work.

94
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,759
I am really curious<br>as to why...

95
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,379
you are here.

96
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:01,269
A chief resident...

97
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,069
dare talk back to...

98
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:06,269
Didn't you kick me<br>out of the operating room

99
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:08,909
and made Cha Yeo-wook<br>as your assistant?

100
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:13,799
A few days ago, the patient you operated on<br>expired from the shunt surgery.

101
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:18,119
I will formally file a<br>complaint on the matter.

102
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:21,019
Choosing an assistant<br>is a right of the surgeon.

103
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:22,129
That's only...

104
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:25,529
when there are<br>no complications

105
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:27,749
with the patient.

106
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:31,929
Chairman Cha Tae-jin.

107
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:35,299
Korea University Hospital is not

108
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:38,649
Dr. Min Sung-joon's hospital.

109
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:40,649
As chief resident,

110
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:44,429
I have a lot of concerns.

111
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:48,549
I hope you act on this.

112
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:50,819
You will formally..

113
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:52,489
file a complaint?

114
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:53,459
Yes.

115
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:59,129
As chief resident, I am<br>questioning the shunt surgery...

116
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,479
done by Cha Yeo-wook.

117
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:08,399
Once you challenge<br>the shunt surgery...

118
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:09,999
Dr. Min Sung-joon and...

119
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:11,389
Dr. Cha Yeo-wook will...

120
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:14,509
be put in a very<br>precarious situation.

121
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:17,989
This will cause...

122
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:20,409
a public uproar.

123
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:26,019
As the chairman,

124
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:27,529
I don't want to throw

125
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:30,309
this hospital into chaos.

126
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:35,969
Nothing good will<br>come out of this.

127
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:40,009
Cha Yeo-wook is innocent.

128
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,379
Because he was dragged<br>into your surgery,

129
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,439
he will have to bear<br>a huge burden.

130
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:47,739
He might even get<br>dismissed from the hospital.

131
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,139
Just like someone<br>from the past.

132
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:53,849
Min Sung-joon.

133
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,249
You're not a 3 year old kid.

134
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:57,549
Don't make matters worse.

135
00:08:57,699 --> 00:08:59,199
Cha Tae-jin.

136
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:01,379
Before this gets<br>any bigger...

137
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:04,159
stop this surgery at once.

138
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,379
This is to<br>protect my son.

139
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:13,969
Dr. Kang Eun-hyun.

140
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:15,469
Yes.

141
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:18,499
I'm sure you understand...

142
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:22,009
as well as Dr. Min Sung-joon.

143
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:25,759
I will perform<br>Dr. Oh Eun-hee's...

144
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:28,279
tumor surgery.

145
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:29,979
Prepare...

146
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:32,689
to assist me.

147
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:35,289
Cha Tae-jin.

148
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:36,789
Min Sung-joon.

149
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:41,449
I don't want<br>to embarrass you.

150
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,509
Let go of me before...

151
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:47,089
I call the police.

152
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:20,479
What...

153
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:21,999
happened?

154
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:25,399
Why did you come here?

155
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:30,709
I thought you'd be<br>in a tough situation.

156
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,779
Once Dr. Min's<br>surgery succeeds,

157
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:34,879
you will be put...

158
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:38,309
in a difficult situation...

159
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:45,489
Today is the<br>last opportunity.

160
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:48,089
The last opportunity to...

161
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:52,199
completely put an end<br>to accusations.

162
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:55,499
You helped me...

163
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,519
at the right time.

164
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,609
What do you<br>plan to do...

165
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:07,509
to Dr. Oh Eun-hee?

166
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:10,379
She won't be able<br>to control her rage.

167
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:13,889
You will manipulate<br>her personality?

168
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:17,389
Like a prisoner, she will live...

169
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:20,229
in a mental hospital<br>for the rest of her life.

170
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:25,199
She became prosopagnosic<br>after her last surgery.

171
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:27,979
If she gets that kind<br>of serious side effect...

172
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:31,639
I'm not interested<br>in this hospital.

173
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:33,839
This is just...

174
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:38,499
a place to create<br>my brain map.

175
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:41,289
It's the only one...

176
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,409
of its kind.

177
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,919
So even if it's not...

178
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:48,069
in this hospital,

179
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:52,709
I can also achieve<br>it elsewhere.

180
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:54,949
After removing vDr. Oh Eun-hee,

181
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:57,089
let's lay low for sometime

182
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,429
and I will help you<br>become the owner of this hospital.

183
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:04,869
Now, Min Sung-joon<br>is nothing.

184
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:07,959
He and Oh Eun-hee...

185
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:13,269
will be kicked<br>out of this hospital.

186
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:08,269
Father.

187
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:11,269
Is everything ready?

188
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:12,169
Yes.

189
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:14,769
We've already given<br>her anesthesia.

190
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:16,209
I will be doing...

191
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:19,209
your mom's surgery.

192
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:20,749
What?

193
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:23,189
Why are you startled?

194
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,379
Isn't Dr. Min...

195
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:28,329
- supposed to do it?<br>- I've spoken...

196
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,049
with him.

197
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,419
But...

198
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:35,719
You may leave now.

199
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:56,629
Doctor.

200
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,479
I'd like to be your assistant...

201
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:03,559
for today's surgery.

202
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:06,259
You?

203
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:08,849
Yes.

204
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:12,359
It's been my dream...

205
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:15,099
to assist you during surgery.

206
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,559
Because it's a tumor surgery,

207
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:20,709
somebody has<br>to send it to the lab.

208
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:22,689
Please have...

209
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:24,609
faith in me.

210
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,419
Then, Dr. Kang Eun-hyun<br>will be the first assistant.

211
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:34,839
And you...

212
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:36,759
will be the...

213
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,179
second assistant.

214
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:42,239
Thank you.

215
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:46,089
I will go wash my hands.

216
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:14,959
Cha Yeo-wook.

217
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,329
Chief.

218
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,699
The surgery...

219
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:16,089
is in your hands now.

220
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,019
[ He's giving her<br>personality disorder. ]

221
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:26,929
[ Personality disorder? ]

222
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:28,829
[ It's to control... ]

223
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,759
[ her temper. ]

224
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:36,979
[ Looks like I have<br>to go through Cha's... ]

225
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:41,269
[ past surgery post-op effects<br>of personality disorder. ]

226
00:17:41,469 --> 00:17:42,779
[ There's not enough time. ]

227
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:44,809
[ I have to find it fast. ]

228
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:48,579
[ The area where<br>Cha Tae-jin plans to operate on. ]

229
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:53,779
[ This approach must<br>have been used before. ]

230
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:21,169
Let's begin.

231
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:23,419
Scalpel.

232
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:03,389
[ Since we're getting married, ]

233
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:10,559
[ the least I could do<br>is give you a wedding ring. ]

234
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:26,109
[ Interesting. ]

235
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,679
[ What are you doing,<br>Oh Eun-hee? ]

236
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,279
[ Dr. Cha Tae-jin,<br>what are you up to? ]

237
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:40,939
[ Listen carefully. ]

238
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,519
[ To me, you're... ]

239
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:46,889
[ just my father's pet. ]

240
00:20:47,489 --> 00:20:49,219
[ You do<br>whatever he wants. ]

241
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:51,799
[ Like a dog who<br>wags its tail any time. ]

242
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:58,849
[ Before Dr. Min Sung-joon's<br>giant aneurysm patient died, ]

243
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:01,889
[ you forced him to<br>sign the consent form... ]

244
00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:05,989
[ of the organ donation. ]

245
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:08,409
[ - That...<br>- Did my father push you to it? ]

246
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,399
[ After the patient's death, ]

247
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:14,639
[ you made it seem like<br>it was a medical malpractice. ]

248
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,849
[ You did that. ]

249
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:18,749
[ Do you plan to... ]

250
00:21:18,949 --> 00:21:21,839
[ blame this on my dad too? ]

251
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:24,259
[ It was an<br>unreasonable surgery. ]

252
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,849
[ It could have been<br>treated by medication. ]

253
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:29,469
[ That's what you<br>believe to be true. ]

254
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:31,719
[ I'll marry you... ]

255
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:33,959
[ but don't give me... ]

256
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:37,479
[ things like this. ]

257
00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:40,609
[ It sickens me. ]

258
00:22:58,259 --> 00:22:59,269
I...

259
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:06,629
don't believe in God.

260
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:10,969
I've never believed...

261
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:15,669
from the beginning.

262
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,369
But seeing this happen,

263
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,259
I feel so resentful.

264
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:33,839
Why must such immoral...

265
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:38,299
acts happen?

266
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,029
The tumor has<br>already been excised.

267
00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:15,669
Let's finish up now.

268
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,159
Yes, sir.

269
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:19,769
Send that to the lab.

270
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:21,739
Yes, sir.

271
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:30,889
Now, all we need<br>to do is touch...

272
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:36,039
the nerve to give<br>her personality disorder.

273
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:06,829
I don't know how...

274
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:10,489
to pray.

275
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:14,429
But...

276
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:18,679
if you really do exist,

277
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,839
and if you're<br>looking at me,

278
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:24,639
please help me.

279
00:25:28,969 --> 00:25:31,239
Please save my mother.

280
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:36,009
Lee Hae-jo!

281
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:37,239
Doctor.

282
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,239
And the surgery?

283
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,659
The tumor was excised.

284
00:26:40,989 --> 00:26:43,269
I found the area<br>Cha Tae-jin's going to touch.

285
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:47,859
After sending the tumor to the lab,<br>go back in as soon as possible.

286
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,709
The area is...

287
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:02,489
I've sent it to the lab.

288
00:27:02,939 --> 00:27:04,969
The result will<br>come out shortly.

289
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:05,869
Good.

290
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:07,859
Put on your gown.

291
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:11,359
Continue as<br>the second assistant.

292
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:04,349
He has to operate along<br>the front side...

293
00:28:04,729 --> 00:28:06,869
and along the main<br>portion of the brain...

294
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:10,929
to cause a personality disorder.

295
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:25,879
[ Hee-yeon. ]

296
00:29:26,229 --> 00:29:27,619
[ The moment I abandoned you, ]

297
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,079
[ I've given up my<br>life as a human being. ]

298
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:35,129
[ As the price<br>for abandoning you, ]

299
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:38,289
[ I will live an<br>unfortunate life forever. ]

300
00:29:40,589 --> 00:29:41,789
[ It's all right though. ]

301
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:45,539
[ I never expected... ]

302
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:47,289
[ to live... ]

303
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,039
[ a loving and... ]

304
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:53,249
[ happy like others. ]

305
00:29:54,869 --> 00:29:56,599
[ I've given up<br>my human life. ]

306
00:29:57,939 --> 00:29:58,709
[ I cannot...

307
00:29:59,689 --> 00:30:01,879
[ live life like a human being. ]

308
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:03,879
[ No...

309
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:09,289
[ I won't live like<br>a human being. ]

310
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:43,799
[ I need to finish this up. ]

311
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,719
[ Nothing will... ]

312
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:49,229
[ ever be in my way again. ]

313
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:54,529
[ It travels along the front and<br>main portions of the nerves. ]

314
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:57,529
Electric tool.

315
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:39,109
I acknowledge...

316
00:31:42,689 --> 00:31:46,689
that humans cannot<br>be brought back to life.

317
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,779
I acknowledge...

318
00:31:53,189 --> 00:31:56,429
that humans<br>should not kill.

319
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:08,239
[ The role of a doctor... ]

320
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:14,039
[ is not to control<br>a human being's life. ]

321
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:19,879
On bended knees<br>before a sick person,

322
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:25,769
I will be a good doctor.

323
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:32,249
Please help me!

324
00:32:36,449 --> 00:32:38,699
Please stop my father.

325
00:32:42,739 --> 00:32:46,239
Please stop this<br>terrifying event that is...

326
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:52,269
happening before my eyes.

327
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,949
We've done<br>all that we could.

328
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,449
Yeo-wook.

329
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:58,089
The surgery has ended.

330
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:01,279
It ended<br>according to plan.

331
00:35:02,169 --> 00:35:03,669
All of it.

332
00:35:06,889 --> 00:35:08,279
Now...

333
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:14,219
the only thing is to wait...

334
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,579
for your mother<br>to wake up.

335
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:23,799
If there...

336
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:28,209
is anyone to blame...

337
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:33,309
blame me.

338
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:39,949
From the very beginning...

339
00:35:41,049 --> 00:35:44,549
I shouldn't have<br>let this happen.

340
00:35:45,689 --> 00:35:46,699
Doctor...

341
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:52,549
If I could turn back time...

342
00:35:54,169 --> 00:35:56,169
if I could...

343
00:35:56,849 --> 00:35:59,299
return to the past...

344
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:03,219
I would have...

345
00:36:05,689 --> 00:36:08,559
never left your mother.

346
00:36:15,419 --> 00:36:16,659
It's me..

347
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:23,399
who made her<br>this unfortunate.

348
00:36:26,929 --> 00:36:28,729
And even you.

349
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:32,859
Doctor.

350
00:36:37,959 --> 00:36:40,959
You didn't cause any<br>unfortunate events.

351
00:36:43,219 --> 00:36:46,719
All the things<br>that happened,

352
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:49,529
are choices...

353
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,459
everyone made.

354
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:01,159
Can you...

355
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,769
forgive me?

356
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:15,809
Can I call you...

357
00:37:18,189 --> 00:37:20,119
father this once?

358
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:37,479
Thank you...

359
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:44,069
for being my father.

360
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:50,349
Father.

361
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:02,219
What are you<br>doing here?

362
00:39:03,249 --> 00:39:04,259
Lee Hae-jo.

363
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:11,709
Dr. Cha Tae-jin...

364
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:14,399
is my birth father.

365
00:39:15,499 --> 00:39:18,879
I found out after my mom was<br>diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

366
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:24,769
That Dr. Cha Tae-jin<br>is my father.

367
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:27,029
Doctor...

368
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:34,589
From that moment on,<br>I was consumed with thoughts of revenge.

369
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:38,719
How to beat that person<br>who abandoned my mom and me.

370
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:41,909
How to bring him down.

371
00:39:42,729 --> 00:39:47,729
When I discovered he was<br>experimenting on patients,

372
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:49,789
I realized I can...

373
00:39:50,469 --> 00:39:52,569
never forgive him...

374
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:55,319
even if he's my father.

375
00:39:56,779 --> 00:39:59,279
I staked my whole life,

376
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:01,879
and set my mind<br>to seek revenge.

377
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:03,879
But...

378
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:06,999
when I found out your father...

379
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:13,089
lost his eyesight because<br>of my father.

380
00:40:14,489 --> 00:40:16,489
For the first time,

381
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:21,389
I wanted to<br>appear indifferent.

382
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:22,959
I wanted to look away.

383
00:40:23,399 --> 00:40:24,909
I wanted to conceal it.

384
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:28,769
I wanted to<br>cover up immorality.

385
00:40:36,649 --> 00:40:38,649
I feel really...

386
00:40:39,449 --> 00:40:41,449
apologetic to you.

387
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:49,459
I'm sorry for hurting you.

388
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,159
I'm sorry I caused<br>you heartache.

389
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,499
I'm also sorry<br>for letting you face...

390
00:41:04,669 --> 00:41:06,169
me like this.

391
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:17,369
You don't need<br>to apologize.

392
00:41:20,989 --> 00:41:23,559
It's not your fault.

393
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:30,829
You couldn't<br>control such events.

394
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,769
You didn't do...

395
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:38,499
anything wrong at all.

396
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:43,779
I will not hate you...

397
00:41:46,169 --> 00:41:49,169
for what<br>Dr. Cha Tae-jin did.

398
00:42:03,469 --> 00:42:05,369
Leave! Leave!

399
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:06,969
I told you<br>to get lost!

400
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:08,269
Get lost!

401
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:10,049
Let go of me!

402
00:42:10,409 --> 00:42:14,409
- Let go of me!<br>- Sister, calm down!

403
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,679
Let go!

404
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,979
Get out of here!

405
00:42:21,979 --> 00:42:24,479
Disappear from my sight!

406
00:42:33,899 --> 00:42:35,499
She's gone totally crazy.

407
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:38,189
She's out of her mind!

408
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:47,179
Who are you?

409
00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:49,839
I'm Cha Tae-jin.

410
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:50,869
You...

411
00:42:51,939 --> 00:42:54,939
operated on<br>my head again?

412
00:42:56,419 --> 00:42:59,419
You might as well kill me!

413
00:43:00,629 --> 00:43:03,429
I can't even recognize<br>the people before me...

414
00:43:03,629 --> 00:43:08,129
Do you know what<br>I have to go through?!

415
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:11,429
I want to die.

416
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:13,779
I don't want<br>to live anymore.

417
00:43:14,729 --> 00:43:16,839
Kill me. Kill me!

418
00:43:17,009 --> 00:43:19,019
I can't take it anymore!

419
00:43:19,169 --> 00:43:21,979
Get a hold of her!

420
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:23,979
Let go!

421
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:26,579
Let go!

422
00:43:26,669 --> 00:43:27,589
Let go!

423
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:28,819
Let go!

424
00:43:42,169 --> 00:43:43,169
Mom!

425
00:43:43,409 --> 00:43:45,939
Let go of me!

426
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:50,189
I don't want injections...!

427
00:43:57,059 --> 00:43:58,079
What's going on?

428
00:43:58,479 --> 00:44:01,599
Why has she<br>gone crazy?!

429
00:44:01,689 --> 00:44:03,319
Why are you<br>asking me that?

430
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:04,689
Father.

431
00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:06,589
Yeo-wook.

432
00:44:11,299 --> 00:44:12,799
You know that...

433
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:15,599
I am not your father.

434
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,999
Don't call me that.

435
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:35,819
Brother-in-law.

436
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:37,319
What happened?

437
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:39,919
This isn't another<br>post-op side effect, right?

438
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:43,119
This is just<br>temporary, right?

439
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,829
Looks like I have to<br>look for a suitable hospital.

440
00:44:48,149 --> 00:44:50,649
Look for a hospital?

441
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:53,569
She's a lunatic.

442
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:54,849
We can't control her.

443
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,129
Are you...

444
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,819
going to send her...

445
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:00,909
to a mental hospital?

446
00:45:02,279 --> 00:45:03,179
Yes.

447
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:05,179
Brother-in-law.

448
00:45:05,979 --> 00:45:08,169
I may not be<br>anything to you,

449
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:09,569
but I'm still her brother.

450
00:45:09,979 --> 00:45:10,639
Why would<br>you send her

451
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:11,849
to a mental hospital?!

452
00:45:12,029 --> 00:45:14,529
Are you going to take...

453
00:45:14,759 --> 00:45:17,759
care of your<br>lunatic sister?

454
00:45:20,249 --> 00:45:23,249
Regardless, I will never...

455
00:45:23,299 --> 00:45:24,299
agree...

456
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:26,359
to this.

457
00:45:34,959 --> 00:45:37,959
If you don't agree to it,

458
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:41,249
without Oh Eun-hee,

459
00:45:42,669 --> 00:45:44,089
you are nothing.

460
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:45,319
What did you say?

461
00:45:45,419 --> 00:45:48,339
If you don't want to be<br>kicked out of this hospital too,

462
00:45:49,229 --> 00:45:51,229
don't mess with me.

463
00:46:09,149 --> 00:46:10,649
Cha Tae-jin.

464
00:46:11,419 --> 00:46:13,349
What did you<br>do to Eun-hee?

465
00:46:13,999 --> 00:46:16,549
You saw it very clearly in<br>the observation room.

466
00:46:17,709 --> 00:46:19,709
We excised the tumor.

467
00:46:19,939 --> 00:46:21,629
Are you still<br>a human being?

468
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:24,339
Don't you feel guilty?

469
00:46:24,419 --> 00:46:25,429
Guilty?

470
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:28,199
Cha Tae-jin.

471
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:29,209
I am...

472
00:46:29,459 --> 00:46:31,959
a doctor who<br>helps others.

473
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:38,669
A doctor who determines<br>a person's life and death.

474
00:46:39,749 --> 00:46:42,379
Oh Eun-hee's<br>test was positive.

475
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:44,229
The CT scan and...

476
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:46,279
MRI clearly<br>showed it too.

477
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:50,679
I did all I could<br>as a doctor.

478
00:46:55,209 --> 00:46:56,709
By the way.

479
00:46:57,259 --> 00:47:00,699
You know the surgery that<br>was revealed to the public?

480
00:47:02,479 --> 00:47:05,099
The shunt surgery you<br>did with Yeo-wook.

481
00:47:05,299 --> 00:47:09,299
Looks like this will<br>boil over very soon.

482
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:10,809
A formal inquiry...

483
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:14,939
will be set up<br>to analyze it.

484
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:16,449
What did you say?

485
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:19,349
Prepare yourself.

486
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:42,099
[ I will... ]

487
00:47:42,939 --> 00:47:44,279
[ let Dr. Cha Tae-jin<br>perform... ]

488
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:48,519
[ my tumor surgery. ]

489
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:51,219
[ You and I both know... ]

490
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:54,489
[ what that means. ]

491
00:48:11,569 --> 00:48:13,569
[ Please help... ]

492
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:17,059
[ Dr. Min Sung-joon. ]

493
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:19,309
[ As a human being... ]

494
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:22,809
[ and as a woman... ]

495
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:26,779
[ I'm begging you. ]

496
00:48:56,629 --> 00:48:58,629
I'm Kim Yi-joon.

497
00:49:08,919 --> 00:49:11,919
I need to tell you this.

498
00:49:13,339 --> 00:49:15,949
I called a<br>reporter regarding...

499
00:49:16,419 --> 00:49:18,419
my uncle's operation.

500
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:22,309
What do you mean...

501
00:49:22,649 --> 00:49:24,149
by you called?

502
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:26,029
As a guardian

503
00:49:26,449 --> 00:49:28,019
and a doctor,

504
00:49:28,649 --> 00:49:31,649
I expressed my viewpoint.

505
00:49:31,759 --> 00:49:33,259
There were no...

506
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:36,659
problems with the surgery.

507
00:49:37,219 --> 00:49:39,239
I've talked with<br>my family members...

508
00:49:39,299 --> 00:49:41,909
and we decided to<br>cancel the lawsuit.

509
00:49:42,759 --> 00:49:44,549
I didn't want to file a lawsuit...

510
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:47,339
from the very beginning.

511
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:51,589
Dr. Kim Yi-joon.

512
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:54,399
I came to tell you...

513
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:57,099
that you have<br>nothing to...

514
00:49:57,509 --> 00:49:59,539
worry about.

515
00:50:02,049 --> 00:50:03,379
Then, I'll take my leave.

516
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:05,819
I thought you're..

517
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,949
with Dr. Cha Tae-jin.

518
00:50:09,879 --> 00:50:12,379
Why are you doing this?

519
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:17,599
I'm leaving...

520
00:50:18,279 --> 00:50:19,559
in a couple of days.

521
00:50:19,759 --> 00:50:21,759
I'm leaving South Korea.

522
00:50:22,959 --> 00:50:24,799
I wanted to...

523
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,319
do the right thing

524
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:32,219
at least once<br>before I leave.

525
00:50:53,729 --> 00:50:56,759
Dr. Oh Eun-hee's surgery<br>went ahead as expected.

526
00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:58,979
She can't<br>control her feelings.

527
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:02,969
And she can't recognize people,<br>so she'd be more upset.

528
00:51:03,549 --> 00:51:04,679
The hospital

529
00:51:04,939 --> 00:51:06,209
will get chaotic.

530
00:51:06,209 --> 00:51:08,919
Time will take<br>care of...

531
00:51:09,129 --> 00:51:11,529
people's anger.

532
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,989
I've been married to...

533
00:51:17,429 --> 00:51:19,589
Oh Eun-hee for<br>half a lifetime.

534
00:51:20,389 --> 00:51:21,759
She's cold-hearted and

535
00:51:22,149 --> 00:51:23,989
keeps herself<br>composed at all times.

536
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:27,329
This kind of woman...

537
00:51:27,489 --> 00:51:30,489
can't control her<br>own feelings.

538
00:51:30,769 --> 00:51:32,409
There's nothing<br>to be scared...

539
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:35,289
and worry about.

540
00:52:41,609 --> 00:52:42,769
Sung-joon.

541
00:52:43,269 --> 00:52:44,269
Eun-hee.

542
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:49,039
Are you really Sung-joon?

543
00:52:51,149 --> 00:52:53,649
I've been waiting for you.

544
00:52:54,449 --> 00:52:56,449
Are you all right?

545
00:53:05,859 --> 00:53:07,029
I'm fine.

546
00:53:09,129 --> 00:53:11,269
You don't feel weak at all?

547
00:53:11,649 --> 00:53:13,149
No headaches?

548
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:18,529
- Can you hear my clearly?<br>- I...

549
00:53:18,709 --> 00:53:19,709
am fine.

550
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,479
Do you feel upset<br>all of a sudden?

551
00:53:23,219 --> 00:53:25,119
Or experience fits of anger?

552
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:28,269
I feel the same, Sung-joon.

553
00:53:29,809 --> 00:53:31,139
Nothing...

554
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,869
has...

555
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:37,429
changed.

556
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:46,469
Thank you.

557
00:54:02,749 --> 00:54:04,249
Do you know?

558
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:10,089
My love for you...

559
00:54:11,959 --> 00:54:13,959
hasn't changed one bit.

560
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:17,329
Nothing has...

561
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,699
changed at all.

562
00:54:22,669 --> 00:54:25,169
My heart still beats fast.

563
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:28,179
I still have...

564
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:31,109
pain in my heart.

565
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:35,489
Nothing is damaged.

566
00:54:36,379 --> 00:54:38,879
Heart, thinking, memory...

567
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:42,739
They're all the same.

568
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:44,899
I'm all right.

569
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:49,299
Eun-hee.

570
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:54,989
I had a dream.

571
00:54:56,869 --> 00:54:58,419
In that dream,

572
00:54:59,899 --> 00:55:01,899
I saw your face.

573
00:55:07,279 --> 00:55:09,069
I recognized...

574
00:55:10,229 --> 00:55:12,089
your face.

575
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:31,909
What about Dr. Cha Tae-jin?

576
00:55:33,249 --> 00:55:35,749
Was he completely fooled?

577
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:43,159
Seems like he doesn't<br>suspect a thing.

578
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:45,349
Now...

579
00:55:46,869 --> 00:55:48,259
we just need to...

580
00:55:48,729 --> 00:55:50,839
get the brain map.

581
00:55:52,229 --> 00:55:54,229
Dr. Kang Eun-hyun...

582
00:55:55,229 --> 00:55:58,229
has been consistently<br>investigating.

583
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:00,689
I'm sure he will bring over...

584
00:56:01,639 --> 00:56:03,569
the files soon.

585
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:06,779
We must trust him.

586
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:10,329
Can we trust him?

587
00:56:12,479 --> 00:56:14,189
Although I<br>don't want to...

588
00:56:14,749 --> 00:56:16,749
doubt and keep guard,

589
00:56:18,759 --> 00:56:20,179
he is Cha Tae-jin's...

590
00:56:20,689 --> 00:56:22,259
son after all.

591
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:26,859
When the specialized<br>medical exam is over,

592
00:56:27,299 --> 00:56:29,069
you will remain as<br>chairman of this hospital.

593
00:56:30,299 --> 00:56:31,369
You can choose...

594
00:56:31,899 --> 00:56:34,399
to purse your specialty.

595
00:56:34,419 --> 00:56:36,419
I will help you.

596
00:56:37,739 --> 00:56:38,739
I understand.

597
00:56:38,939 --> 00:56:39,909
In a calm and orderly way.

598
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:41,619
Don't feel rushed.

599
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,419
Make this hospital yours.

600
00:56:44,749 --> 00:56:46,549
You're not alone.

601
00:56:48,549 --> 00:56:49,389
Yes.

602
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:57,859
I want to see...

603
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:00,799
your mother.

604
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:04,199
Can you tell me...

605
00:57:04,349 --> 00:57:06,369
where she is now?

606
00:57:15,579 --> 00:57:16,579
Take this.

607
00:57:17,649 --> 00:57:19,149
What is this?

608
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:21,709
This is fruit of my labor,

609
00:57:22,129 --> 00:57:23,629
the brain map.

610
00:57:26,869 --> 00:57:28,689
If you tell me<br>where Hee-yeon is,

611
00:57:29,389 --> 00:57:31,349
I will tell you password...

612
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:33,799
to open it.

613
00:57:45,639 --> 00:57:46,749
Do you...

614
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:48,979
trust me?

615
00:57:51,479 --> 00:57:52,979
I'm not yet used to it.

616
00:57:53,979 --> 00:57:56,979
The fact that<br>I'm your father.

617
00:57:59,269 --> 00:58:01,389
And believing<br>in other people...

618
00:58:01,589 --> 00:58:04,589
I'm not used<br>to it yet.

619
00:58:05,589 --> 00:58:09,089
Including you<br>in this project...

620
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:13,269
was a huge<br>decision for me.

621
00:58:13,899 --> 00:58:15,899
But we can't...

622
00:58:16,419 --> 00:58:18,279
go back now.

623
00:58:20,439 --> 00:58:21,459
This time,

624
00:58:22,379 --> 00:58:23,979
we have to fight<br>against those...

625
00:58:24,989 --> 00:58:27,489
who covet our position.

626
00:58:48,129 --> 00:58:50,629
The sun is so bright.

627
00:58:53,999 --> 00:58:57,499
When the sun<br>shines so brightly,

628
00:58:57,769 --> 00:59:00,769
I sometimes<br>feel so shabby.

629
00:59:16,759 --> 00:59:20,259
How did you<br>keep yourself calm?

630
00:59:20,759 --> 00:59:22,759
What do you mean?

631
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,099
After finding out<br>what father had done,

632
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:32,609
you ran out immediately

633
00:59:33,429 --> 00:59:37,429
to help in the<br>emergency surgery.

634
00:59:41,389 --> 00:59:44,389
Then you went to my mom

635
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:49,739
and volunteered to<br>be the assistant surgeon.

636
00:59:51,939 --> 00:59:53,939
You calmly performed...

637
00:59:54,969 --> 00:59:57,969
your duty<br>as an assistant.

638
01:00:00,739 --> 01:00:05,239
I'm sure it must have<br>been a huge shock.

639
01:00:05,409 --> 01:00:08,909
How did you keep<br>yourself calm?

640
01:00:11,699 --> 01:00:15,699
When my dad returned<br>after his surgery,

641
01:00:16,659 --> 01:00:18,659
he said to me...

642
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:21,429
"I don't know what<br>happened to me."

643
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,619
"I can't see."

644
01:00:27,629 --> 01:00:31,629
I swayed my hands<br>up in the air.

645
01:00:34,629 --> 01:00:36,629
I wasn't frightened.

646
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:42,619
You weren't frightened?

647
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:47,739
If something<br>shocking occurs...

648
01:00:48,219 --> 01:00:50,209
Fright, panic...

649
01:00:51,509 --> 01:00:53,509
anger and sadness...

650
01:00:54,919 --> 01:00:57,919
I don't feel them at all.

651
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:02,039
Everything suddenly disappears.

652
01:01:03,379 --> 01:01:07,379
So I can't feel<br>anything at all.

653
01:01:10,179 --> 01:01:13,679
When I heard<br>that my father...

654
01:01:14,019 --> 01:01:17,519
became blind on<br>purpose by Dr. Cha...

655
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:21,269
I had no...

656
01:01:23,109 --> 01:01:27,109
feelilngs at all<br>in the beginning.

657
01:01:28,739 --> 01:01:32,739
And I slowly started<br>to think that...

658
01:01:34,939 --> 01:01:36,939
Dr. Cha Tae-jin...

659
01:01:40,109 --> 01:01:41,619
needs to be killed.
