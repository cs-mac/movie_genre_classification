How great is that? I've got an
entire room With no defined purpose.

52
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:24,728
I could fill it With
cornflakes if i wanted.

53
00:03:24,763 --> 00:03:27,711
Not sure this neighborhood
Is zoned for cornflakes,

54
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:28,886
but an intriguing notion Nonetheless.

55
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:31,809
Okay, then sand. I could fill it
with sand. Better yet, bullets.

56
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,795
You can never have Too many bullets.

adding spirulina To the mix?

62
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:50,966
Bite me, I'm trying to do
Something healthy For a change.

- Why?
- Why?

64
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:54,863
How 'bout Because being healthy
Is better than Not being healthy?

65
00:03:54,898 --> 00:03:57,311
Doesn't suit you. Seems oddly out
of character. Kind of unsettling.

66

That i might want Just a little bit more

70
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:15,401
for my life, Or is that just too much For
you to wrap Your little pea-Brain around?

71
00:04:15,436 --> 00:04:17,116
I gotta believe this Is
the spirulina talking.

shove That bagel up your-

No, i can't. But i
think I can do a week.

117
00:06:50,947 --> 00:06:54,499
I bet if i don't show up For a week,
She'll run out Of food and booze, and leave.

118
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:58,327
Oh, god. Why won't She stop calling me?

119
00:06:59,957 --> 00:07:04,472
Maybe because You left her home alone In a
house full Of unpacked boxes 12 hours ago.

120
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,440
- Good god, I'm so hungry.

<i>I'm not a cop anymore. And this doesn't
look Like the greatest neighborhood.</i>

But to save you From future humiliation,
You should know A couple of things.

145

One, wasting my time Is a big mistake.

146
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:49,702
Two, arrogant assholes Who
think They can get in my pants

I, uh-

153
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:24,642
I don't know.

154
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:27,483
You know, in chicago That woulda worked.

155
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,346
I think maybe I'm one of those people
You need to see In context to get.

156
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:38,313
And you were Completely right
About the b-Movie fantasy.

157
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:41,637
Except in my version, It
ends with me getting loaded

158
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:44,175
With all my old buddies,
The ones i ratted out,

159
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:49,835
Tellin' them all About the hot witsec
inspector I nailed in albuquerque.

160
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:54,911
Why'd you do it?

161
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:02,760
You want The complicated
answer Or the truth?

162
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:06,263
I don't know, Surprise me.

163
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,127
I was afraid To go to jail.

164
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:12,804
Is that The complicated
answer Or the truth?

165
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,499
That's the truth.

166
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:15,985
And...

167
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:20,429
it's complicated. The
fbi Had a ton of evidence.

168
00:10:20,464 --> 00:10:23,937
If i hadn't taken the deal,
Someone else would have.

169
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,748
And i'd be The one in prison.

170
00:10:31,654 --> 00:10:37,359
But i know A few of those guys Woulda
told the feds To go screw themselves.

171
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:41,044
Which leads me to believe That
i just Didn't have the balls

172
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:43,652
To stand up With my friends

173
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:46,741
and say, "We did what we had to do. "

174
00:10:47,726 --> 00:10:49,649
- Which was what?
- Which was...

175
00:10:50,673 --> 00:10:53,877
Putting away murderers. And rapists.

176
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:59,945
And junkies who were Pimping their
kids For a fix By any means necessary.

177
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:03,865
And for that part of
it, I have no regrets.

178
00:11:04,817 --> 00:11:08,210
So what, You planted
evidence, Gave false testimony?

179
00:11:10,217 --> 00:11:11,651
Yeah.

180
00:11:13,457 --> 00:11:16,277
Look, i don't expect you To understand.

181
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:21,003
I'm sure you always play
By the book. It just gets-

182
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:26,172
It just gets frustrating After awhile.

183
00:11:26,973 --> 00:11:29,377
You know, All those rules That
are supposed To protect us,

184
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:32,795
They just get between us
And the things we want most.

185
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,071
It's kinda hard For me
to take you seriously

186
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:42,462
with that tinfoil bird In your lap.

187
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:34,103
As soon as we're finished, I
am gonna eat That entire swan.

188
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,351
I might have to live here.

189
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,148
<i>Every day we make Hundreds of choices.</i>

190
00:13:32,183 --> 00:13:35,045
<i>Most of them innocuous
Either-Or kind of decisions,</i>

191
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,875
<i>Like, "should i turn Right or left?"</i>

192
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,627
<i>Others require A bit more thought, Like,
"should i order The bacon-Cheeseburger,</i>

193
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:43,993
<i>"Which i love, "Or some low-Fat
Flavorless salad "Which i know</i>

194
00:13:43,994 --> 00:13:47,360
<i>Is better for me But will
ultimately Leave me unsatisfied?"</i>

195
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:50,861
<i>And then there are Those
really tough choices...</i>

196
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,011
- Hey, squish.
- Hey.

197
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:56,611
<i>Like, "should i Sleep with someone
"Just because i'm isolated "And yearn</i>

198
00:13:56,612 --> 00:14:01,177
<i>so deeply For any kind of human
contact That my skin Actually aches?"</i>

199
00:14:07,465 --> 00:14:08,932
So, um...

200
00:14:09,505 --> 00:14:12,620
- about yesterday.
- I'm not sleeping With raph.

201
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:15,563
And now we're not Even friends anymore.
So you can stop Worrying about it.

202
00:14:15,598 --> 00:14:17,455
I'm not worried About it.

203
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,788
And i don't want you
To stop being friends...

204
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:21,999
But I don't want To compete with
you For his attention Either.

205
00:14:23,675 --> 00:14:27,248
I know. I know, And you
shouldn't have to. I just...

206
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,847
I understand.

207
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,427
You don't have Any other friends here.

208
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:35,996
Look, awhile ago You asked me To help
you find Some direction in your life.

209
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,562
I want to apologize For not
following through With that.

210
00:14:39,597 --> 00:14:42,397
- Well, it's no big deal.
- It is.

211
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,909
It's a really big deal.

212
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:51,173
So how 'bout, um, After work we
get some dinner And talk about it?

213
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:55,158
- Yeah, okay.
- Good.

214
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:59,243
And in the meantime, It's fine
with me If you hang out with raph.

215
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:05,376
<i>The slain officer,
Stephen ramirez, Was shot</i>

216
00:15:05,377 --> 00:15:07,947
<i>to death Near his
Northeast heights precinct.</i>

217
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:11,247
<i>Police sources tell us Before

218
00:15:11,282 --> 00:15:14,797
<i>He served with distinction On
chicago's Narcotics division.</i>

219
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:19,216
<i>Ramirez leaves behind His

221
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:25,425
Hey, it's eps. Leave a message.

222
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,859
Hey, it's mary shepherd. I need you
to call me As soon as you get this.

223
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,146
It's important.

224
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:36,712

226
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:41,776
Hey, what's going on?

227
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:43,313
Anyone know anything About the shooting?

228
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:44,901
- Not much.
- He was off duty.

229
00:15:44,936 --> 00:15:48,975
Got shot four times Up close down
on central. Never drew his weapon.

230
00:15:49,597 --> 00:15:52,688
Could have been Someone he
knew. Cops make Lots of enemies.

231
00:15:52,723 --> 00:15:56,053
Yeah, maybe he ran Into
someone he knew From chicago.

232
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,654
What's with the looks?

233
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:04,267
He's pointing A not-So-Subtle
finger At my witness, Robert eps.

234
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:06,305
I'm not pointing anything At anyone.

235
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,152
But it wouldn't be The
first cop he killed.

236
00:16:08,187 --> 00:16:09,930
Yeah, well, I'm already
into it. And screw you.

237
00:16:09,965 --> 00:16:13,438
He took one in the back, Then shot that
cop In self-Defense, And you know that.

238
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,171
What are you doing?

239
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,515
Nothing, just considering
All possibilities.

240
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,825
Maybe he shot this cop
In self-Defense too.

241
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,793
All right, That's enough.

242
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:22,718
We're all On the same team here.

243
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:24,987
Mary, Talk to your witness.

244
00:16:25,022 --> 00:16:27,377
Find out where he was Last night.

245
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:31,491
Listen, Chico,

246
00:16:31,526 --> 00:16:33,671
Whatever might have happened Between us

247
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:36,151
Didn't, wouldn't, And never will.

248
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:39,253
And the fact is, We're friends.

249
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:41,687
And i don't have Many friends.

250
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,920
Actually, I don't have any
friends Except for your sorry ass.

251
00:16:44,955 --> 00:16:47,474
So until i find Someone better,
You don't get To just decide

252
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:50,032
That we're not Hanging out
anymore. Okay, you just don't.

253
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:53,298
Too bad. Sorry. So shut up about it.

254
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:57,694
- How do you have keys To my place?
- It's mary's.

255
00:16:57,729 --> 00:17:01,967
Oh, and by the way, um, She said
that it was okay For us to, you know.

256
00:17:02,002 --> 00:17:04,958
No, not that "you know," You know.

257
00:17:05,636 --> 00:17:10,324
Brandi, we are friends, And
i don't want To lose that.

258
00:17:10,782 --> 00:17:16,385
But you have to admit That between
us There's this Kind of attraction.

259
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,064
Oh, please. Okay, so what?
Nothing's gonna happen.

260
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:24,940
Even if i wanted to, Which just the thought
of it Makes me throw up a little bit.

261
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:29,349
Okay, you would Never cheat on mary.
Never, ever In a million, billion years.

262
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:33,860
You're such a boy scout.
You're, like, The most honest,

263
00:17:33,895 --> 00:17:37,741
- Decent, Trustworthy guy...
- I slept with judy.

264
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:42,093
Fat judy? Your physical therapist?

265
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:44,973
Well, i wouldn't Call her fat.

266
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:55,642
<i>Why don't you go hustle Your
flabby ass downstairs And bring me</i>

267

<i>back The goddamn ballistics report

00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:33,317
You dropped this.

302
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:37,794
Thanks.

303
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:52,546
Who's that?

304
00:19:57,602 --> 00:20:00,251
According to this, He's
a guy who didn't exist

305
00:20:00,252 --> 00:20:02,901
Until he showed up In
new mexico 13 months ago.

306
00:20:12,318 --> 00:20:13,826
Where have you been, Asshole?

307
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:15,559
Workin'.

308
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:18,574
- Is this about That dead cop?
- I called seven hours ago.

309
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:21,287
<i>Sorry, i was in the middle
Of doing a hot tub install.</i>

310
00:20:21,322 --> 00:20:23,261
I don't bring my cell
Into clients' homes.

311
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:26,028
You know, just because We slept
together once Doesn't mean You own me.

312
00:20:26,063 --> 00:20:27,445
- Where the hell are you now?
- Home.

313
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:29,619
- Stay there.
- I'm coming over. Yes, ma'am.

314
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:32,363
You know, if i knew Killing another
cop Would get you To come to my house,

315
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,373
I woulda done it A long time ago.

316
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:36,348
That's not even A little bit funny.

317
00:20:38,132 --> 00:20:41,361
Brandi, come on. I need
to talk to you. Open the-

318
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:44,653
- Brandi.
- Coming.

319
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:51,066
Hello, raphael. Come in.

320
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:53,345
Hi. Thanks.

321
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,352
- I need to talk To you.
- Why?

322
00:20:57,387 --> 00:20:59,843
You got another secret You're
dying To get off your chest?

323
00:20:59,878 --> 00:21:01,409
Are you boning Your maid too?

324
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:04,312
- What?
- She's joking.

325
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:08,712
Can we just Talk in private, please?

326
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:10,408
Fine.

327
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:22,215
You want me to go.

328
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:27,284
- What happened Was an accident.
- Really?

329
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,914
'Cause accidents Are usually more
like You trip And you sprain an ankle.

330
00:21:30,949 --> 00:21:33,456
Not you trip and you stick
Your penis in someone.

331
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:35,963
I didn't mean an "accident"
As much as a "mistake. "

332
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:40,789
Look, it was A confusing time.
Mary was Completely avoiding me.

333
00:21:40,824 --> 00:21:44,586
Every time i ask her To do something,
She asked you To do it for her.

334
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:46,428
I thought We were broken up.

335
00:21:46,463 --> 00:21:50,491
So you nailed That fat pig,
And you never Even hit on me?

336
00:21:51,582 --> 00:21:53,043
Damn, chico...

337
00:21:56,964 --> 00:21:59,752
i can't think Of the right answer here.

338
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:06,584
God, you look good.

339
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:09,007
Where were you Last night?

340
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:13,420
I took a walk Around old town.

341
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:16,014
Had a drink alone.

342
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,727
Got home around 11:00,
Also alone unfortunately.

343
00:22:18,762 --> 00:22:21,025
Did you know this guy, The one
who was killed, Stephen ramirez?

344
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,747
Look, i didn't even know
Everyone in my precinct.

345
00:22:23,782 --> 00:22:26,435
No, i didn't Know the guy.
And no, I didn't kill him.

346
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:29,886
Next time i call you, Call me back.

347
00:22:30,094 --> 00:22:32,239
So how come you avoid
me Like the plague?

348
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,880
Because i like my job, And i don't
want what happened To happen again.

349
00:22:37,915 --> 00:22:39,632
At least you didn't
say It was a mistake.

350
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:43,025
No, just a choice, And
choices Have consequences.

351
00:22:43,136 --> 00:22:45,366
The consequence Of us sleeping
together Is like it or not

352
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:47,597
I have to keep My distance from
you More than other witnesses.

353
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,837
- More than you want to?
- Actually, no.

354
00:22:49,872 --> 00:22:53,898
Perfectly happy Staying away from
you. I gotta go. Keep your phone handy.

355
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:59,347
- What?
- Your boy's About to get arrested.

356
00:22:59,382 --> 00:23:02,170
What? How's that possible?

357
00:23:02,205 --> 00:23:05,441
I have no idea. Stan's on
his way Over to metro now.

358
00:23:05,476 --> 00:23:07,243
All right, Thanks.

359
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:09,131
- Come on.
- Where?

360
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,765
Police station. Better you
walk in Th get dragged in.

361
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,158
I don't know how The
son of a bitch found you,

362
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,552
But at least he won't have the
Satisfaction of bringing you in.

363
00:23:16,587 --> 00:23:18,900
What the hell is this?

364
00:23:19,227 --> 00:23:21,003
Are you kidding me?

365
00:23:31,948 --> 00:23:33,485
Stay where you are, Both of you.

366
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,987
Keep your hands Where i can see 'em.

367
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:37,843
Are you outta your mind? You're
drawing down On a u. S. Marshal.

368
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:42,081
I am gonna burn you For this.

369
00:23:42,561 --> 00:23:48,117
Robert eps, You're wanted For questioning
In the murder Of officer stephen ramirez.

370
00:23:48,152 --> 00:23:50,111
So what's plan b?

371
00:24:11,318 --> 00:24:12,946

00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:15,858
- Keep walking, Douche bag.
- Don't say a word.

373
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:18,061
How about When this crazy bitch
Shoots me For trying to escape?

374
00:24:18,096 --> 00:24:20,058
Then should I say something?

375
00:24:20,322 --> 00:24:21,379
Hold up.

376
00:24:21,414 --> 00:24:22,570
Visitors go Around front.

377
00:24:22,605 --> 00:24:24,707
I'm here on official
business. Get outta my way.

378
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:26,250
And what kinda business Would that be?

379
00:24:26,285 --> 00:24:28,098
'Cause if you wanna
state For the record Your

380
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,911
official connection To my
prisoner, I'd be happy To

381
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:31,724
let you pass. Otherwise,
you go around front And

382
00:24:31,725 --> 00:24:33,502
fill out A visitation
request Like everyone else.

383
00:24:33,537 --> 00:24:36,021
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause i don't like Cop killers.

384
00:24:36,056 --> 00:24:38,500
And right now i'm not
too wild About you either.

385
00:24:43,885 --> 00:24:45,193
Mary.

386
00:24:45,469 --> 00:24:46,839
They're booking eps.

387
00:24:46,874 --> 00:24:48,768
Prick dershowitz Won't even let me in.

388
00:24:48,803 --> 00:24:49,519
I'll take care of it.

389
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,000
I need to call The
u. S. Attorney's office.

390
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:52,724
I said I'll take care of it.

391
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:55,567
They just peed On the wrong dog's porch.

392
00:24:58,616 --> 00:25:01,681
This federal court order Gives my
people Complete access To mr. Eps.

393
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:04,029
That means two marshals
On post 24 hours a day.

394
00:25:04,064 --> 00:25:07,510
Your lead detective Will keep us up to
speed On any developments In the case.

395
00:25:07,545 --> 00:25:10,956
And albuquerque e. S.U. Will take down
The wiretap on this number Immediately.

396
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:13,624
I can't believe that little
Bitch actually tapped my phone.

397
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:15,698
- Excuse me?
- Actually he tapped Eps' phone.

398
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:18,416
Whose number he snooped Off your phone.

399
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,451
Anyway, captain, The u. S. Government

400
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,301
Appreciates your
cooperation In this matter.

401
00:25:23,026 --> 00:25:25,383
I'm saying I didn't know the
guy. Not here, Not in chicago.

402
00:25:25,418 --> 00:25:27,219
Yeah, we know All about chicago.

403
00:25:27,254 --> 00:25:30,821
We found the gun That you dumped
Three blocks away In the arroyo.

404
00:25:30,856 --> 00:25:32,164
That's Some nice police work.

405
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:36,206
Once we find Your prints on it, The
d. A. Won't be Offering you any deals.

406
00:25:38,196 --> 00:25:42,390
Worst law enforcement idea In the
last 100 years... Male/female partners.

407
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:46,790
Did you know That nine times outta ten
They end up screwing Or killing each other?

408
00:25:46,825 --> 00:25:48,338
Or both?

409
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,429
Ten bucks Says she did it.

410
00:25:51,464 --> 00:25:54,002
You're a bastard!
You're a bastard!

411
00:25:55,563 --> 00:25:57,408
Oh, you are tough.

412
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:04,223
So that's the kinda guy You
go for, A rat cop killer?

413
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:07,749
Anything other than They both worked
in chicago Tying these guys together?

414
00:26:07,784 --> 00:26:09,112
I'm confident we got The right guy.

415
00:26:09,147 --> 00:26:12,412
Sounds like you're doing Some
great police work. Keep it up.

416
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,238
So where do you wanna start?

417
00:26:16,273 --> 00:26:18,709

419
00:26:22,105 --> 00:26:24,375

420
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,611

421

422
00:26:29,126 --> 00:26:31,088

good idea? She's a widow.

423

00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,435
Sure.

453
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:13,043
Did you know steve?

454
00:29:13,355 --> 00:29:15,380
No, no, i didn't.

455
00:29:16,036 --> 00:29:20,177
Everyone i talk to Speaks so highly
of him. He must have been A great cop.

456
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:21,726
He was.

457
00:29:22,205 --> 00:29:23,869
He was a hero too.

458
00:29:24,254 --> 00:29:27,290
Twice decorated. Once
here And once in chicago.

459
00:29:28,177 --> 00:29:31,036
- Oh, let me Fix you a plate.
- Thank you.

460
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:35,681
It sounds like he had A lot
of close friends On the force.

461
00:29:36,489 --> 00:29:37,729
Not really.

462
00:29:38,128 --> 00:29:40,371
You know, he was so
devoted To his family,

463
00:29:40,372 --> 00:29:42,614
He didn't have a lot of
time For other people.

464
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:44,813
- What about his partner?
- Roxanne?

465
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,779
Oh, he loved her. She's a great girl.

466
00:29:47,814 --> 00:29:51,006
Steve and I Always wished She'd
find a nice man To be with.

467
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,781
- She isn't dating anybody?
- Roxy? No.

468
00:29:53,816 --> 00:29:56,521
- But if you know Of anyone...
- thanks.

469
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:58,821
What the hell Are you doing here?

470
00:29:59,602 --> 00:30:02,129
- Paying my respects.
- Roxanne, we're just-

471
00:30:02,164 --> 00:30:04,579
- Get her out of here.
- But i haven't eaten.

472
00:30:04,614 --> 00:30:06,994
What the hell Is wrong
with you? Coming here!

473
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:09,355
All right, I'm leaving!

474
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:15,506
Come on, let's go.

475
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:19,551
Get it, get it. Get a shot. Come on.

476
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:20,976
Got it?

477
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:22,612
Get up. Unbelievable.

478
00:30:23,627 --> 00:30:24,858
Get up.

479
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:26,784
All right, Take it easy. Come on.

480
00:30:29,174 --> 00:30:32,635
<i>The cause of the scuffle Between
albuquerque detective Roxanne lewis</i>

481
00:30:32,636 --> 00:30:36,061
<i>and the other Unidentified
female Remains unknown.</i>

482
00:30:36,096 --> 00:30:38,718
Your grappling technique
Leaves something to be desired.

483
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:42,286
You try fighting And keeping Your
face off-Camera At the same time.

484
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:44,520
Did you find anything
In ramirez's case files?

485
00:30:44,555 --> 00:30:49,606
Yeah, i dug up A confidential informant
He used in a couple Of drug cases.

486
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:53,207
Thought he might know If ramirez Was
investigating something That got dangerous.

487
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:56,060
You mind talking to him While i go
make nice With ramirez's partner?

488
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:59,031
Sure, but keep your left up This time.

489
00:31:15,894 --> 00:31:19,415
Looks like someone
Kicked the crap outta you.

490
00:31:24,135 --> 00:31:26,143
You hit like a girl.

491
00:31:26,608 --> 00:31:29,451
Thanks. You too.

492
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:34,415
Look, i know What you're going through.

493
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,729
My partner got shot A few months ago.

494
00:31:37,242 --> 00:31:38,722
I almost lost him.

495
00:31:39,304 --> 00:31:41,638
You get the guy?

496
00:31:42,285 --> 00:31:43,460
Yeah.

497
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,533
Good.

498
00:31:49,621 --> 00:31:51,069
You want coffee?

499
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:52,957
All right.

500
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:55,410
I want you to know, If it turns out Eps

501
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:57,536
is your guy I'll hold
him down While you do it.

502
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:59,063
But i don't think It's him.

503
00:31:59,098 --> 00:32:01,987
Yeah, well, Forgive my
skepticism, But objectivity

504
00:32:01,988 --> 00:32:04,876
Kinda goes out the window
Once you've slept With the guy.

505
00:32:04,911 --> 00:32:06,137
What?

506
00:32:06,172 --> 00:32:07,609
It was on the wiretap.

507
00:32:07,644 --> 00:32:09,952
He said you only Slept with him once.

508
00:32:09,987 --> 00:32:11,707
You thought That was real?

509
00:32:12,088 --> 00:32:14,329
He's always saying stuff Like that.

510
00:32:14,773 --> 00:32:19,086
But if it were true And it got
out, You'd be kinda screwed, huh?

511
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:22,136
Ballistics got a hit On the gun.

512
00:32:22,171 --> 00:32:25,403
It was stolen From an evidence
locker In chicago Five years ago.

513
00:32:25,438 --> 00:32:28,636
I don't suppose I need to point
out Ramirez is from chicago too.

514
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:30,493
Ramirez didn't steal
His own murder weapon.

515
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:32,571
And there's One more thing...

516
00:32:32,606 --> 00:32:34,580
Eps lied About knowing ramirez.

517
00:32:34,615 --> 00:32:37,031
They worked the same
Murder case six years ago...

518
00:32:37,032 --> 00:32:39,447
And that's enough For me to charge him.

519
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:46,311
You lied to me. You
worked a case With ramirez.

520
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:49,924
Jesus, does anybody In
this town do their homework?

521
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:53,854
That case Was the murder Of an
alderman And his entire family.

522
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,996
I probably did work
With ramirez on it Along

523
00:32:55,997 --> 00:32:58,813
with 400 other cops
Over a two-Year span.

524
00:32:58,848 --> 00:33:01,630
The whole goddamn
force Worked that case.

525
00:33:12,332 --> 00:33:14,261
- Marshall?
- Yeah.

526
00:33:14,296 --> 00:33:16,191
- Cooper?
- Guilty.

527
00:33:17,626 --> 00:33:20,348
I still can't believe
What happened to stephen.

528
00:33:20,383 --> 00:33:24,875
Yeah. I was wondering What
kinda things Was he into?

529
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:27,602
Excuse me?

530
00:33:28,151 --> 00:33:30,210
What kinda cases Did
he talk to you about?

531
00:33:30,245 --> 00:33:32,270
He had you listed As a
confidential informant.

532
00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:36,709
Uh, that was years ago. That's
how we got To be friends.

533
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,746
I helped him arrest This
boy who was dealing meth.

534
00:33:39,781 --> 00:33:44,607
Stephen and i Both really hated What
those drugs Were doing to our people.

535
00:33:46,097 --> 00:33:47,946
You have people?

536
00:33:58,774 --> 00:34:00,614
Excuse me.

537
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:10,882
Hey, mare. Feel like
joing me For a drink?

538
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:13,888
How long did you know
Your partner was gay?

539
00:34:13,923 --> 00:34:16,047
What are You talking about?

540
00:34:18,226 --> 00:34:19,852
Are you crazy?

541
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:22,686
Guy's married For 12
years. He's got two kids.

542
00:34:22,721 --> 00:34:25,103
- How long have you been His partner?
- It's nothing.

543
00:34:25,138 --> 00:34:28,172
Some things are private, You know?
Everyone's got secrets, Right?

544
00:34:28,207 --> 00:34:32,142
You need to tell me Right
now... Was detective ramirez gay?

545
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:36,077
I honestly Don't know for sure.
I didn't ask. He didn't tell.

546
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:41,809
- But i did suspect.
- Did his wife know?

547
00:34:41,844 --> 00:34:44,443
Elizabeth? God no. I can't imagine.

548
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:47,790
A gay cop With a wife Wound
tighter Than a golf ball.

549
00:34:47,825 --> 00:34:49,590
And you didn't think
That warranted mentioning?

550
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:51,355
I thought his sex life
Ought to remain private.

551
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:51,946
- Really?
- Yeah.

552
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:53,477
Is that how you work
Your civilian homicides?

553
00:34:53,512 --> 00:34:55,490
He was a good cop, bobby, With a family.

554
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:58,649
You think the fact That
he was gay changes that?

555
00:35:03,553 --> 00:35:05,586
Come on, let's go talk To elizabeth.

556
00:35:05,621 --> 00:35:10,139
Ramirez had access To that gun in chicago.
Maybe he lifted it, Kept it at home.

557
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:14,658
Maybe, maybe not. Let's not Start accusing
people Until we have Proper evidence.

558
00:35:14,693 --> 00:35:17,702
Wow, talk about the cop
Calling the kettle black.

559
00:35:19,597 --> 00:35:23,859
That's funny. Never sounded
racist Till now. My bad.

560
00:35:26,378 --> 00:35:29,229
I wish i knew What to say, bobby.

561
00:35:29,264 --> 00:35:32,475
But you have Honestly got me stumped.

562
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,686
Steve and i Were very happy together.

563
00:35:35,997 --> 00:35:38,357
We were High school sweethearts.

564
00:35:39,446 --> 00:35:41,134
It must have been so hard.

565
00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:45,197
All those years Not being
able To tell anyone the truth.

566
00:35:46,262 --> 00:35:48,325
How long did you have To live like that?

567
00:35:49,572 --> 00:35:51,373
I couldn't have done it.

568
00:35:52,598 --> 00:35:54,335
What is she talking about?

569
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,958
I mean, If i found
out My husband was gay,

570
00:35:56,993 --> 00:35:59,777
- Yeah, i'd be pissed.
- Dear lord, bobby.

571
00:35:59,812 --> 00:36:02,562
Roxanne, Make her
stop Saying these lies.

572
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:05,229
All i'm saying Is you poor thing.

573
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,695
To spend all those years
With a man who doesn't

574
00:36:07,696 --> 00:36:10,265
Find you desirable, Who'd
rather be With other men-

575
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,835
Stop it. I don't know why
You're letting her to this.

576
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,451
This man was a hero.
He was one of you.

577
00:36:16,486 --> 00:36:19,907
I think the real tragedy Is
it didn't Accomplish anything.

578
00:36:19,942 --> 00:36:23,531
He didn't fool anyone. Everybody
knew, And nobody cared but you.

579
00:36:23,566 --> 00:36:24,981
Who knew?

580
00:36:25,998 --> 00:36:27,724
Don't say that.

581
00:36:28,373 --> 00:36:29,838
Nobody knew.

582
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:32,140
That would kill him.

583
00:36:32,614 --> 00:36:34,237
Elizabeth,

584
00:36:35,036 --> 00:36:39,323
Did you know That all police
ammunition Is marked For identification?

585
00:36:39,393 --> 00:36:42,857
The fbi Keeps a database, And
they called me A little while ago.

586
00:36:42,892 --> 00:36:45,842
We know that your husband
Was shot With a stolen gun.

587
00:36:45,877 --> 00:36:48,947
But we also know It
was with his own bullet.

588
00:36:49,818 --> 00:36:54,927
No cop would ever load A throway
With department-Issue Ammunition.

589
00:36:56,919 --> 00:37:00,085
You've got kids In the house.
He probably Kept it empty.

590
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,157
Locked away somewhere.

591
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:09,876
He died like a hero.

592
00:37:11,253 --> 00:37:13,615
That's what He would have wanted.

593
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:16,469
He died right.

594
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:21,309
You understand, Don't you?

595
00:37:36,157 --> 00:37:38,709
Hey, it's me.

596
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:42,226
So this thing With judy.

597
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:47,923
I guess we were Kinda broken
up Or whatever When it happened.

598
00:37:48,153 --> 00:37:50,001
So i can't be too pissed.

599
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:53,141
But i don't know.

600
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:57,050
<i>It feels Like we're trying To
make this Into something it's not.</i>

601
00:37:57,312 --> 00:38:00,278
<i>And the only time We get
into trouble Is when we</i>

602
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:03,245
<i>start acting Like we're
supposed To be something more.</i>

603
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:06,857
<i>So i don't know If you're
okay With us just coasting,</i>

604
00:38:06,858 --> 00:38:10,153
<i>but it sounds Like a good idea to me.</i>

605
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:13,905
<i>And if you want To see other
