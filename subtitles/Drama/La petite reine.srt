00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,080
Petite Reine: Downfall of a Champion

2
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,220
Really?
That's good.

3
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,760
Tell him. He'll be happy.

4
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,100
The papers here didn't cover it.

5
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,680
That's how it is with women's racing.

6
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,980
A full page?

7
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,860
That's really cool.
- Tell him, already.

8
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,200
- l'm not even there, Dad.
- lt'll make him happy.

9
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,500
We're leaving in...

10
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,460
- ln an hour.
- About an hour.

11
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,460
Go out for supper?

12
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,630
What does Mom think?

13
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,600
l wanted to relax
with just the two of you.

14
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,030
You decide, Dad.

15
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,450
Yeah. Here he is.

16
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,870
Hi, Alain.

17
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,370
Yeah.

18
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,960
She surpassed her time trial.

19
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,250
20 kilometres in 27.45!

20
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,170
Yeah, it's amazing.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,630
lt's looking good?

22
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,300
Did you throw out all the food?

23
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,090
Go buy some champagne right now.

24
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,890
This is our year for the World Cup.

25
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,850
Definitely.

26
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,270
Alain, l have to go.

27
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,770
Yeah.

28
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,650
OK, perfect.

29
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,860
Bye.

30
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,280
But they were here yesterday.

31
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,200
l just injected myself.

32
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,420
JP, what do we do?

33
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,380
Get the lV bag, then do push-ups.

34
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,710
- No, no.
- Do it!

35
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,770
Keep going. Come on!

36
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,070
- Where were you?
- Slowing him down.

37
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,200
lt'll be OK.

38
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,660
Keep going! lt'll be fine!

39
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,450
C'mon, fuck.

40
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,660
Sit down.

41
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,290
Put it in, now.

42
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,890
- l can't do it, JP.
- C'mon, fuck.

43
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,020
- The stuff!
- Squeeze, damn it.

44
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:19,980
The stuff.

45
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,650
- Squeeze hard.
- l'm squeezing!

46
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,910
Let's go. Squeeze.

47
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,050
- The bike!
- Fuck!

48
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,130
Get on and pedal.
Gimme that. Come on!

49
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,340
Come on!

50
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,550
Right, good.

51
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,930
Come on, let's go!

52
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,940
Faster.

53
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,980
Break.

54
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,700
JP.

55
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,450
lf he comes in, you slip out.

56
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,950
No, it'll be all right.

57
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,200
This way. Hurry.

58
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,410
C'mon.

59
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,210
Hurry up.

60
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,500
Squeeze.

61
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,880
Keep squeezing.

62
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,100
Keep squeezing, fuck.

63
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,930
- l'm squeezing.
- Until he comes back.

64
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,140
When he does...
- Then what?

65
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,560
Then take it out.

66
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,350
And turn off the shower.

67
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,770
Squeeze!

68
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,510
Dad, can you put this in my room?

69
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,970
- Sure.
- Thanks.

70
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,780
He reserved at Baton Rouge.

71
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,950
- At Roberto's. lt's quieter.
- Thanks, Mom.

72
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,740
She's too tired to be hassled.

73
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,950
lt's in half an hour, OK?
- Perfect.

74
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,460
Good.

75
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,580
Suzanne,
the ones from Hamilton are nicer.

76
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,590
Yes, definitely.

77
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,550
We should put them in a special case.

78
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,130
- We'd see them better.
- Yes.

79
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,800
- You'll need another shelf.
- l guess so.

80
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,680
What's up with you two?

81
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,970
You know how she gets
when you're gone.

82
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,270
You should talk.
He spent his weekends scrapbooking.

83
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,980
Seriously, Dad?

84
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,070
Albums are meant
to be looked at sometimes.

85
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,780
Let's go.
Your mom's nerves get on my nerves.

86
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,990
Good.

87
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,910
Mom, in five minutes, OK?

88
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,850
When l dream,
l see a medal and the podium.

89
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,390
Realizing your dream is great,
but it's work.

90
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,270
- lt's not work.
- Yes, it is.

91
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,690
Ten races in less than four months.

92
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,610
lt sounds fun,
but l'm on my bike six hours a day.

93
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,820
l train in Arizona in winter
and race the rest of the year.

94
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,620
Friends, computer games...
l've never known any of that.

95
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,950
l'm alone or with my coach,
training hard.

96
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,790
- ls the money good?
- She isn't Lance Armstrong.

97
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,620
Not yet.

98
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,040
But you are a star.

99
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,500
No, that's not how it works.

100
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,920
- How does it work?
- When l win a race,

101
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,550
l don't do it alone.
l have a team.

102
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,390
For example,
a paceline is really important.

103
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,850
lt's a way to position ourselves.

104
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,480
We take turns,
being shielded from the wind.

105
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,060
Like geese.

106
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,520
l don't know about birds.

107
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,110
My team shields me
the whole time,

108
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,400
so l'm stronger for the final sprint.

109
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,530
And we have a great coach.

110
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,820
Fucking pedal, already!

111
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,410
He decides strategy, observes
who's better on hills or flat roads

112
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,990
and takes it from there.

113
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,040
lt's all planned in advance.

114
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,750
When you win,
is it you or the whole team?

115
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,670
- lt's me.
- Then you are the star.

116
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,630
Yes.

117
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,640
They could win,
but their priority is the leader.

118
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,140
That sucks for them.

119
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,060
Why do they do it?

120
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,890
They love cycling
and they get a salary.

121
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,520
But they're paid less than you.

122
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,440
Yes, that's true.

123
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,660
l'm also sponsored.

124
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,700
My contract states
l get a bonus when l win.

125
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,660
So winning is important.

126
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,080
l'm not supposed to say that.

127
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,080
They don't teach that at school.

128
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,500
"lt's not winning,
but taking part that counts."

129
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,670
Right, but if you don't win,
what will you take part in?

130
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,590
You were good.

131
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,180
The kids loved it.

132
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,390
Sorry for not following
the game plan.

133
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,810
lt was perfect.
From the heart and no bullshit.

134
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,270
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

135
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,270
Don't forget Saturday's telethon.
- Yes.

136
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,820
We have the outdoor fair on the 25th,

137
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,030
the Breakfast Club the 26th,
the radio interview the 29th,

138
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,280
and the Gala after the race.

139
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,200
l left the schedule with your dad.

140
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,290
Perfect.

141
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,330
Drop me off at the next light.

142
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,630
- Don't you want a ride home?
- l'm meeting a friend.

143
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,050
- l can take you.
- Right here is perfect.

144
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,500
OK.

145
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,760
OK. Bye.

146
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,140
- Bye.
- Take care.

147
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,030
Private Orthopedic Clinic

148
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,280
You really hurt yourself.

149
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,660
What were we supposed to do?

150
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,160
How much did you intake?
A half, two-thirds?

151
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,660
- Two-thirds.
- At least three-fourths.

152
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,830
- Three-fourths? lt's all right.
- Really?

153
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,090
l wasn't sure.
l had just injected myself.

154
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,630
lt's not that bad!

155
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,880
The solution lowered
your hematocrit by three points.

156
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,840
You were probably at 46
when you were tested.

157
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,720
Might raise a red flag,
but it's within limits.

158
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,060
There. What did l tell you?

159
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,230
She always argues with me.
- Drop it, Dr. JP.

160
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,900
You'll be fine,
JP did good.

161
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,780
l know, but still.

162
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,360
Your pressure is good.

163
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,700
Any dizziness?
- No.

164
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,910
- Arrythmia?
- No.

165
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,990
Good.

166
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,580
Any pain?
- No. lt's good.

167
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,710
- Are you eating well?
- Not bad.

168
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,000
Oh, boy.

169
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,880
Don't mess with that, Julie.

170
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,170
None of my sport clients have built
a career eating tofu and salad.

171
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,010
You have to eat.

172
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,720
l'll try harder. But l am taking
your supplements.

173
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,510
Attagirl! You're my idol.

174
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,520
Should l renew
the anti-inflammatories?

175
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,400
- l have some left.
- Same as usual?

176
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,240
Keep going. One more minute.

177
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,420
Not too hard.
Keep it at 300 watts.

178
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,300
Why are you going so fast?

179
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,720
Hi, love.

180
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,680
Hi. You okay?
- Yes. You?

181
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,770
- Leave it there to dry.
- l got it.

182
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,270
Hi, sweetie.

183
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,860
C'mon, keep going.

184
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,650
What are you doing at 320?
l said 300.

185
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,610
Lower it
or you won't be able to finish.

186
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,200
l said down.
Bring it to 300.

187
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,540
Not up. Down.

188
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,500
l'll knock you down.
l said 300.

189
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,050
What the hell?

190
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,550
Shit.

191
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,640
That's what happens
when you're overconfident.

192
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,970
l'm not overconfident.

193
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,720
You and your smug face.

194
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,230
- What smug face?
- That one.

195
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,230
Save the look you had in the garage
for the track.

196
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,110
OK. lt's fine.

197
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,570
Really?

198
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,490
ls that why you're half dead
on my kitchen floor?

199
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,530
- My back hurts. lt feels good.
- Take two.

200
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,030
You don't appreciate people
who want the best for you.

201
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,580
You don't listen during training.
Here, love.

202
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,170
What now?

203
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,130
The Federation left a message.

204
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,220
- Hello.
- Hi.

205
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,060
They're in François's office.

206
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,110
Why aren't you training?

207
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,910
- What are you doing here?
- He called.

208
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,410
- Hi.
- Hi.

209
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,990
ls something wrong?

210
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,500
They don't have your itinerary
for the upcoming months.

211
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,170
The Anti-Doping Agency
has asked me for it three times.

212
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,800
Why didn't you ask JP to send it?

213
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,760
He never returns my calls.

214
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,380
Yeah...

215
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,800
There's a lot going on.
- They're so busy.

216
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,930
This isn't up-to-date, Dad.

217
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,640
- What?
- You know the rules.

218
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,230
They can suspend you for that.

219
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,400
l know. l'm really sorry.

220
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,200
l just forgot.

221
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,030
You coming, Dad?

222
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,160
They sent your last test results.
Have you seen them?

223
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,000
You have irregularities.

224
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,500
- Really?
- But all's good.

225
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,750
ls it your anemia, again?

226
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,130
- You're anemic?
- She has been for years.

227
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,470
My blood sucks or it's their test.
That's that.

228
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,260
lf it's your blood, fix it.
lt's unhealthy.

229
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,970
Don't worry.
Dr. Henri says it's under control.

230
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,850
You should see a specialist.

231
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,730
- He is a specialist...
- An orthopedist.

232
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,730
lt'll be fine, François.

233
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,990
lt'd be a shame
if she were disqualified.

234
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,740
- Disqualified?
- Why would l be?

235
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,950
- ls something wrong?
- Of course not.

236
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,580
- l've always respected requirements.
- But...

237
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,460
Hang on there.
Has she or not?

238
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,830
She has.

239
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,220
But at the Federation,
we know sports-medicine specialists

240
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,340
who would take excellent care of her.

241
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,180
François, athletes are fine-tuned
but fragile machines.

242
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,560
You need the right person.

243
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,140
Dr. Henri has followed her since she's 14.

244
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,820
- Sure, but...
- l appreciate it, but it's fine.

245
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,860
Why are the Chinese such sourpusses
on Olympic podiums?

246
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,950
They feel guilty
for taking a break.

247
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,410
Pull up your zipper a bit.

248
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,990
Cheese, everyone!

249
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,870
- Perfect. That's everything.
- Good.

250
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,960
l'm getting a drink.

251
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,090
l'm dying to leave.
l'll be in the hall.

252
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,340
Check out Ducros.

253
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,760
Hi.

254
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,430
Didn't she have chicken thighs?

255
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,850
That chicken's fed with hormones now.

256
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,010
Told you it was her on the track.

257
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,560
- When?
- We trained two days ago.

258
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,020
- Why didn't you call me?
- We did.

259
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,810
l called JP. Didn't he tell you?

260
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,520
Julie. lnterview.

261
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,780
- With who?
- Thierry Côté.

262
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,110
Tall red-headed guy.
Really nice.

263
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,030
Mic.

264
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,910
Hi.

265
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,210
lt's unusual to see you here,
Ms. Lebigot.

266
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,920
The Canadian Anti-Doping Program
is sending a clear message

267
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,260
to all sport disciplines:
Our presence will be stronger.

268
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,720
Ms. Lebigot, can that
really stop doping once and for all?

269
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,220
l don't know...

270
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,350
Lobster in Nantua sauce.
ls that good?

271
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,360
OK for the appetizers
and the lobster.

272
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,650
l hate it when she does that.

273
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,650
lt's a good sign.
Means she's going to win.

274
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,820
035...

275
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,620
Put a three.
lt doesn't work.

276
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,530
lt'll cost a fortune!

277
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,750
- lt does work.
- Could you stop?!

278
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,250
- lt's starting.
- And a pastry platter...

279
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,300
Suzanne.

280
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,550
Hurry up.

281
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,510
lt played three times today.

282
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,970
Your feet.

283
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,310
- The two stars of this edition...
- Listen to this.

284
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,850
Belgian Renalda Ducros,
2nd in the standings,

285
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,980
right behind Quebec's darling,
the incredible Julie Arseneau...

286
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,980
"The incredible Julie Arseneau."

287
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,190
- Who's at the top...
- My daughter!

288
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,820
Julie, are you nervous about
the next stage in the Cup?

289
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,450
Honestly, no. We're ready.

290
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,620
We're so happy it's in Quebec.
It's an honour to race at home.

291
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,620
We're really looking forward to it.

292
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,370
That's that.

293
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,080
Thanks, Julie. Good luck.

294
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,640
Climbing should be easy.

295
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,360
They've paved those streets.
But on Decelles and Côte-des-Neiges,

296
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,070
there are potholes,
so watch out.

297
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:35,120
...with a close second
by Renalda Ducros from Belgium.

298
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,250
Faster, Julie!

299
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,460
...has managed to take the lead.

300
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,590
You three lead out on the last turn.

301
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,760
The French and Belgians
will definitely be there.

302
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,600
Keep a fast pace to block an attack.

303
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
- OK.
- Cool.

304
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,600
Julie and Valerie, hide nearby
for as long as possible.

305
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,350
Once on Parc Avenue,

306
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,270
Julie, sprint like hell.
No one's going to wait for you.

307
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,070
No problem.

308
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,070
Fuck!

309
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,820
My chain.
- What?

310
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,080
How the fuck did it fall off?!

311
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,330
Get it back on and hustle!

312
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,790
Jess. Cynthia--
- Too far.

313
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,420
We're stuck behind.
- Val, where are you?

314
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,840
Valerie Morin, from team Vita,
overtakes her teammate,

315
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,090
who's having some trouble.
She's speeding towards

316
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,300
the French and Belgian leaders.
- Go!

317
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,800
Hammer it, Julie. Go.

318
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,390
She's off the saddle.

319
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,690
Go for it. Keep it up.

320
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,770
Jump across. Go.

321
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,980
She's back in the race.

322
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,700
She's caught up with Ducros.

323
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,950
You're there. lt's yours.

324
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,710
This comes down
to Frenchwoman Eugénie Polard

325
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,510
and Quebec's darling, Julie Arseneau!

326
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,130
What a race!

327
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,550
It doesn't get better than this!

328
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,560
Arseneau rides to victory!

329
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,530
She gave everything she had
on those last 500 metres!

330
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,950
What an extraordinary feat.

331
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:42,950
Miss Arseneau, new protocol.
We need a blood sample.

332
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,080
No problem.

333
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,660
ls it the champagne?
There's one race left!

334
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,290
lt's just sparkling wine.

335
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,710
The champagne is for Belgium.

336
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:33,250
- You OK, sweetie?
- My head hurts.

337
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,880
- A toast.
- Suzanne, here's a glass.

338
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,590
Everyone, a toast.

339
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,840
To the whole team.

340
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:44,140
Girls, two medals in one race.
l'm speechless.

341
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,060
JP, impeccable!
We're lucky to have you, coach.

342
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,220
- Thanks.
- lmpeccable.

343
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:53,650
And of course, our champion.
This race belongs to her.

344
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,690
We're proud of you.

345
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,780
Cheers!
- Cheers!

346
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,280
- Eat some meatballs.
- Not too many.

347
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,570
This smells delicious.
Same restaurant as last time?

348
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,370
Yes. lt's the best.

349
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,080
You're the best.

350
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,920
- Do you want anything?
- Here, champion.

351
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,500
- No, thanks.
- l'll take that. Thanks.

352
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,000
Bring me a plate?

353
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,590
She has a migraine.

354
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,030
l'll go talk to her.

355
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,620
Suzanne, get me some meatballs.

356
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,130
Mind if l take a dip?

357
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,420
- Absolutely not.
- OK!

358
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,530
What's wrong?

359
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,280
They did a blood test after the race.

360
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,160
"New protocol."

361
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,580
Don't think about that, now.

362
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,540
l was the only one tested.
l'll have irregularities again.

363
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,460
l'll take care of it, OK?

364
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,250
Don't worry.

365
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,880
l'm really freaking out.
Tell me you'll take care of it.

366
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,880
l'll take care of it.

367
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,260
Promise?

368
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,470
Promise.

369
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,480
ln the pool.

370
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,420
lt's like training in high altitude.
lt's perfectly legal.

371
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,630
- Did you invent this?
- This model, yes.

372
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,840
l have more sophisticated ones,

373
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,550
but basically, they all lower
oxygen in the blood.

374
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,220
After sleeping in this tent,
a higher hematocrit level is normal.

375
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:37,140
lt naturally increases
the number of red blood cells.

376
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,520
Do people believe you?

377
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,820
Of course.

378
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,280
lt's the latest craze.

379
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,950
- You OK?
- What?

380
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,870
Yes, l'm fine.

381
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,830
- How much for this model?
- Two thousand.

382
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,670
They're not cheap.

383
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,590
- lt's a good investment.
- For who?

384
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,970
Well?
- lt's ridiculous.

385
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:18,980
l've been asked to give out awards
to the best Vita reps.

386
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,480
Honestly, it's an honour for me
to be here and meet you.

387
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,270
- l'm starving.
- l have toothpaste.

388
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,490
- Doesn't work.
- lt does too.

389
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,780
Only for five minutes.

390
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,780
For those of you coming on stage,
l'll keep close.

391
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,910
Because even if we won
in Montreal last Sunday...

392
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,250
lt's...

393
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,380
lt's not over.

394
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,090
She found something.

395
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,920
We'll need all your energy,
because in two weeks,

396
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,430
we'll be in Belgium
for the World Cup.

397
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,640
There's a vending machine
by the pool.

398
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,970
l always gain weight between races.

399
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,520
Claude, even if you don't have
the guts to ride with me -

400
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:06,060
or is it because you're
always playing with your phone...

401
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:12,450
Thank you for your faith in me
and for your friendship.

402
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,610
The World Cup is yours!

403
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,620
We'll work hard. That's for sure.

404
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,370
Yes!

405
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,830
Thank you.

406
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,170
The award for the best
Vita Sales Team goes to...

407
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,670
She's not going out with us tonight.

408
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,340
- What is it?
- lt's Dr. Henri.

409
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,760
- What about him?
- lt's coming out tomorrow.

410
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,720
Tell Claude none of it is true.

411
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,350
ls this a joke?

412
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,480
He ratted you out.

413
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,270
Talk to him when he gets off stage.
l'll be in the car.

414
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,280
Did he believe you?

415
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,080
l don't know.

416
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,380
l can't go home.
- You have to.

417
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,670
He won't drop it.
You know how he gets.

418
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,180
- Hi.
- JP, what's up?

419
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,640
Can l talk to you for a minute?

420
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,230
Either he was caught selling
doping products to athletes,

421
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,230
or someone sold him out.

422
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,480
He named just about anyone.

423
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,900
The list hasn't been made public yet,
but you know reporters.

424
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,780
- ls Julie on that list?
- We just don't know.

425
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:43,620
He could have lied to save his ass.
We don't know a thing.

426
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,000
There will certainly be an inquiry.

427
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:50,040
Definitely. Anyway,
this is one big misunderstanding.

428
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,630
Why would anyone accuse Julie?

429
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,260
He got caught,
so he said anything.

430
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,840
The police showed up and he panicked.

431
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:02,430
Why her? He can denounce away,
but Julie hasn't done anything wrong.

432
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,600
- She has nothing to be ashamed of.
- Exactly.

433
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,640
- Where is she?
- ls she OK?

434
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:11,440
She's still at the Vita Gala.
Claude is handling it.

435
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,650
- Go to her, Alain.
- No, don't.

436
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:17,280
She won't be long.
She might even be on her way.

437
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:21,280
The best thing is
to avoid upsetting her.

438
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,160
- You think?
- Yes.

439
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,960
Holy shit.

440
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,970
We're stopping.

441
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:44,260
We have no choice but to stop.
We'll get caught.

442
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:47,770
We won't.
No one here is getting caught.

443
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,240
What now?

444
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,410
l don't know.

445
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,000
l don't want to go home.

446
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,010
No, no.

447
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,800
l have to go.

448
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,600
Nathalie is all nerves. And...

449
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,220
l don't wanna...

450
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,150
What about me?

451
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,610
l'll drive you home.

452
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,130
l barely said a thing.

453
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,720
They already knew everything.

454
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,350
ln fact, they made assumptions.

455
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,730
l just answered their questions.

456
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,730
They treated me like a criminal.

457
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,730
They searched everywhere.

458
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,960
l didn't want to hurt you, Julie.

459
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,580
Fine.

460
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,380
Just write, then.

461
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,600
They threatened to revoke my licence,
l had no choice.

462
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,190
Write.

463
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,400
Go on, write.

464
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,000
l've never taken any.

465
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,970
l've never seen any.

466
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,430
No one has ever offered me any.

467
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,050
l don't even know what it looks like.

468
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,970
You've never used doping products?

469
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,850
- Never.
- Any steroids?

470
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,440
- No.
- Any blood transfusions?

471
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:02,860
Vitamins. Just vitamins.

472
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,110
Was Dr. Henri your doctor?

473
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:10,360
Yes. We have his letter confirming
that if she is on the list of athletes

474
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:14,240
he said he supplied doping products to,
it's a mistake.

475
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,370
You'll get a copy after
the press conference.

476
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,910
Was he referred to you
by another athlete?

477
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,130
No. My coach knew him.

478
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,170
l've been a patient
since l was fourteen.

479
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,420
For what?

480
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,960
- Anemia.
- Why then be followed

481
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,930
by an orthopedist
instead of a hematologist?

482
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,600
Dr. Henri was someone
Julie and her coach trusted.

483
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,480
lf her coach introduced them,
why isn't he here?

484
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,190
Because this is about me.

485
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,610
You're targeted by
the Anti-Doping Agency.

486
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,400
How long have suspicions
surrounded you?

487
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:51,400
There are no suspicions
surrounding me.

488
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:54,370
Top athletes are tested worldwide.

489
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,620
lt's part of a normal process.

490
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,330
lt doesn't mean anything.

491
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:01,330
There have been blood irregularities.

492
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,000
We won't go into details
about her health.

493
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:08,920
Those irregularities are simply due to
my altitude tent.

494
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,300
lt's legal.
- Altitude tent?

495
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,970
lt helps with recovery,
but it raises hematocrit levels.

496
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:19,430
You must admit,
for reporters covering you for years,

497
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,060
an altitude tent seems
to come out of nowhere.

498
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,150
lt was a secret.

499
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,650
Now, it has to come out,

500
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,690
though l'm not happy about
my competitors knowing.

501
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:34,530
According to you,
what happens next?

502
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,490
Nothing has changed.

503
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,040
My team and l
are going for the Cup.

504
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,460
And we will make Quebec proud.

505
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:46,830
Vita reiterates its support
for Julie Arseneau and her family.

506
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,840
lt's an honour to have her
as spokesperson,

507
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,430
and we're confident Team Vita
will succeed at the World Cup.

508
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,340
That's all for now.

509
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:03,560
Thank you.

510
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,490
- Very good.
- Sorry l never mentioned the tent.

511
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,490
- You hadn't?
- Not sure.

512
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,500
Technical stuff...

513
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,870
- Bravo.
- Good job.

514
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,130
Wasn't she amazing?

515
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,840
You were so impressive,
facing down those reporters.

516
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,170
Claude did help.

517
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:35,510
Reporters will be hounding you.

518
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:39,180
lgnore them and don't worry.
l'll handle everything.

519
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,970
lt'll be all right.

520
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,400
How did it go?

521
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,900
- Didn't you watch?
- l tried to, but...

522
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:56,200
- She was great. Firm.
- Good.

523
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,660
You really didn't watch?!

524
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,450
Why would l?
lt's a bunch of lies.

525
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,750
- Not what l said.
- You know how emotional he gets.

526
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:07,000
- Alain is such a big softy.
- Whatever.

527
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,340
The inquiry into Dr. Henri's fraud

528
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,710
falls under criminal jurisdiction
and not the Agency's.

529
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,260
Damn right.

530
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:20,050
But Ms. Arseneau's
evasive answers

531
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,970
concerning her high hematocrit level
and her altitude tent...

532
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,640
leave much to be desired.
- What do they all have against her?

533
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,650
But her tent isn't illegal.

534
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:31,860
Exactly, it's not. Wake up.

535
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,650
She has to justify her job.

536
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:37,570
The normal hematocrit level
for a woman is 37-48%.

537
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,570
But levels normally remain stable.

538
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,790
Could an altitude tent alone explain

539
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:49,210
the large gaps in irregularities
observed in Ms. Arseneau?

540
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,630
Probably not.

541
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,670
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

542
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,510
Anything to be on TV.

543
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,720
- Are we eating?
- Yes.

544
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,050
What irregularities?

545
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,390
ln six years of racing,
l've had tons of blood tests.

546
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,390
They could have made mistakes.

547
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,350
- Due to your anemia.
- But what tent?

548
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,270
- We got one in Arizona.
- Didn't you see it in the garage?

549
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:17,190
Why haven't we heard about it before?

550
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,450
What the hell?
Are you a cop now?

551
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:22,990
- No one tells me anything.
- lt's tech stuff, Mom.

552
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,160
lt's like me.
l've tried to keep up, but...

553
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:29,330
And remember,
reporters aren't all experts.

554
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,580
A lot of bullshit's coming.

555
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,840
When the users' names come out,
they'll let us be.

556
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,340
Fucking Dr. Henri.

557
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,670
l'd love two minutes with him.

558
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,970
Two minutes? The bastard.

559
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,550
l never liked his face.

560
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,680
Never mind Dr. Henri.
Go get us that World Cup.

561
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:49,640
That'll shut them up.

562
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:52,560
ln two days, this will be old news.

563
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:55,610
Drop it. No one answers
their phone. l got this.

564
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,230
But it's the Federation.

565
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,110
- Don't answer, Dad.
- Hello?

566
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,540
He should be here soon.

567
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,790
Can we start without him?

568
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,970
The Federation isn't at ease
with renewing your licence.

569
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,520
l don't understand.

570
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,350
The irregularities...

571
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,190
Dr. Henri...

572
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:39,030
Dr. Henri... that was resolved
at the press conference.

573
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,280
Not for us. We're uneasy.

574
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,200
The Federation
doesn't have the authority.

575
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,830
As long as you refuse to see
a sports doctor, my hands are tied.

576
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,910
lt's the World Cup Final.

577
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,580
François, we've put you on the map.

578
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,290
You've gotten great exposure.

579
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,670
And you're doing this
over a sports doctor?

580
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,090
We can't grant a licence

581
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:06,220
unless doping
has been completely ruled out.

582
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,220
- Says who?
- l'm just following protocol.

583
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:12,020
You can't do this to me.
lt's ridiculous.

584
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,600
l'm sorry.

585
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:17,770
OK.

586
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:24,490
Supposing we do see a sports doctor,
would she get her licence in time?

587
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:29,780
Probably, but it's not guaranteed.

588
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:31,580
What does that mean?

589
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,500
We're going there to win the Cup,

590
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:38,000
and you can't guarantee
she'll have it for the race?!

591
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:39,630
Julie!

592
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,210
Julie.

593
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,510
What was that?
- l'm going home.

594
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:46,840
- We're going to see his doctor.
- No.

595
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:50,720
- What then?
- Nothing. l've done nothing wrong.

596
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:53,140
- So let's see his doctor.
- l won't.

597
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:56,810
Why did you answer the phone?
Claude told you not to.

598
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,810
What will Claude think
when he finds out?

599
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:03,030
We do what François says,
then it's done.

600
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,990
He has no right to ask.

601
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,490
He's not the one asking.

602
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,410
After all l've done for you,
l'm asking.

603
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:10,990
You have no right, either!

604
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,370
What am l supposed to do?
Give them my file?

605
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,870
- Why not?
- You know exactly why not.

606
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,250
No, l don't know.

607
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,260
Seriously, Dad?
You really suck. You piss me off.

608
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,690
Where are you going?
You have a race in ten days.

609
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,690
Where is she going?

610
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,900
Will someone tell me
what's going on?

611
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,740
Alain, do something.
We can't let her go like this.

612
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,930
- What was that about?
- What do you think?

613
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,800
Why are you giving me that look?
- l don't know.

614
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:16,310
l can't buy some
at the duty-free shop.

615
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,610
You're not trying.
You're not trying at all.

616
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:12,490
- lt's not my fault, it's windy.
- lt'll be windy in Belgium.

617
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:14,570
l know that, JP.

618
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,660
Your race on Mount Royal,
that was kid stuff.

619
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:21,830
Small time.

620
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:25,290
Over there, the last kilometre is
the Wall of Huy,

621
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,590
a 23%  slope.

622
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:30,380
23!
So shut up and pedal.

623
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,180
Fuck.

624
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,850
What's going on?

625
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,400
- lt's windy.
- No. What's going on?

626
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,480
l don't know.
Maybe l'm overwhelmed.

627
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,110
By what?

628
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,860
By what?! Everything.

629
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,950
l get it, it sucks. But you have to
get over it and move on.

630
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:02,790
Easy for you to say. You're never
there when the shit hits the fan.

631
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,510
You're crazy!

632
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,630
I'm not even at 30.

633
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,090
Stop it!

634
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:20,260
I set the cruise control at 35.

635
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,390
- That's enough!
- Pedal.

636
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:28,360
- Turn off your cruise control!
- Go.

637
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:31,650
lt's fucking dangerous!

638
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,610
Only because you're not moving.

639
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,000
lt's not my fault.

640
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:47,330
lt's windy.

641
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:50,880
OK. Fine.

642
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,260
Figure things out.

643
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:57,680
Let me know when you're ready.

644
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,430
JP!

645
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,060
We're in the middle of nowhere!

646
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,650
Fuck.

647
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,870
She'll have her licence.

648
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,960
Definitely.

649
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,500
What can l say?

650
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,880
Welcome to the States.

651
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,960
No jerking around.

652
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:22,390
You happy?
So quit fighting.

653
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,980
Why bother with that?

654
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,150
Forget it.

655
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:36,400
Once we've won,
they'll shut their traps.

656
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:44,200
And us, what do you think?

657
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,660
Here she is.
lt's your dad.

658
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:54,880
Alain, she's in the shower.

659
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,360
What's your problem?

660
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:02,990
You look beautiful.

661
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,140
l can't believe
Dr. Henri never mentioned this.

662
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:17,640
lt gives the exact hematocrit level.

663
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:19,560
What's the big deal?

664
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,400
l can avoid irregularities.

665
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:23,690
OK.

666
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,900
Let's say you check your level.

667
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,280
You're at 49.

668
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,410
Then the anti-doping guy
is at the door.

669
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:33,200
lt didn't help much.

670
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:35,410
But l can keep it under 48.

671
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,580
You'll still have irregularities.

672
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,420
With smaller gaps.

673
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,090
lf you say so.

674
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,590
- Look. 45.
- Show me.

675
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:50,760
Right, 45.
That there is one nice irregularity.

676
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,680
Go to hell.

677
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:56,850
lt's completely stupid.

678
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,730
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

679
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:00,400
You're camping tonight.

680
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,860
No way, l'm not sleeping in there.
That's stupid.

681
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,610
- You're camping.
- What a waste of money.

682
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:13,740
Go. You can do it.

683
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:15,740
Push! Push! Push!

684
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:19,120
You can do it.

685
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,210
Harder!

686
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:25,420
Faster or l'll catch you.

687
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:29,050
Don't even try. See you at the van.

688
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:32,640
Really?
Not if l get there first.

689
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:47,070
What's wrong?

690
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,160
l think l took too much.

691
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,580
l don't feel good.

692
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,040
lt's just nerves.

693
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,790
JP, my heart stopped beating.

694
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,170
lt's beating. Sleep.

695
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,470
Come to bed.

696
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:18,680
JP.

697
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,520
l need a hospital.

698
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,110
Breathe. Keep breathing.

699
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,110
My blood is too thick. l can feel it.

700
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,740
Get on the bike.
You have to pedal.

701
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:37,530
Get on.

702
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:40,450
- l can't.
- Get on.

703
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:43,120
- l can't.
- Pedal. lt has to go down.

704
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,830
lt has to go down.

705
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,960
There. Pedal.

706
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,510
Go. Pedal!

707
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,510
You have to burn the surplus.

708
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,890
Fifty-six. Holy shit, Julie.
What did you do?

709
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:05,150
The hospital!

710
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:06,900
Did you take 500 or 200?

711
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:21,660
Get on. Good. Go.

712
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:24,160
Don't fall.

713
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:26,920
lt's OK.
Look at me.

714
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:29,340
- JP.
- lt's OK.

715
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:34,840
l'm going to die...

716
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:36,130
Here.

717
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:40,010
Good.
- l'm going to die.

718
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,430
You're not going to die.

719
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,060
Keep going.

720
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,690
Go.

721
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,590
You feeling better?

722
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,150
Yes?

723
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,730
Dad.

724
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:32,940
lt's me.

725
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:34,360
Yes.

726
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,990
Where are you? Have you guys left?

727
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:40,410
Not yet.

728
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:43,990
l...

729
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,580
l need to talk to you.

730
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,800
JP told me about the licence.

731
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,430
He sure knows his stuff.

732
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,180
For sure.

733
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,680
Everything OK?

734
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:13,980
Yes.

735
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:16,820
l was just calling...

736
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:19,700
To see how things are going.

737
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,870
Good. That's nice.

738
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,620
We'll see you there?

739
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:29,710
Yes.

740
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:30,830
OK, Dad.

741
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:32,580
OK.

742
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,730
Liège, Belgium

743
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,410
Room 51 1 1 .

744
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:54,750
- May l have another key?
- Of course.

745
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,880
Ms. Arseneau?

746
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,460
Hello. l'm Gilbert Lennel from WADA.

747
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,130
We need a blood sample.
Please follow me.

748
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:05,340
No problem.

749
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,010
Hey.
- Hi.

750
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,640
You good?

751
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:53,020
When did you arrive?
- Yesterday.

752
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,940
We were wondering
where you guys were.

753
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:59,400
- We had things to take care of.
- l can imagine.

754
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,610
- How are the girls?
- Good.

755
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:05,450
Why?

756
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:09,070
You know it's all a smear campaign.

757
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:10,450
Yeah.

758
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,410
We watched the press conference.

759
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,960
Doesn't change a thing for you guys.

760
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,830
Sure. But it still sucks.

761
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:31,930
- Hi.
- Hi.

762
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:35,390
Are you sleeping at the hotel?
What about your tent?

763
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,770
- Jessica.
- Can't l make a joke?

764
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,230
The truck is ready. Let's go, girls.

765
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:44,070
- Shotgun.
- Eat shit.

766
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:50,200
You're heading towards the Wall.

767
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,450
Julie should be in the lead pack.

768
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:54,160
Valerie, protect Julie.

769
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:56,960
Anyone else who can, do the same.

770
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:01,170
Do what you can until the Chicane,
then it's time.

771
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:03,800
Then, Julie, it'll be in your hands.

772
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,010
lt'll be tough,

773
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:07,470
but you can do this.

774
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,130
Why did you hug the inner curb?

775
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,930
lt was obviously going
to screw us up.

776
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:53,140
- They shoved you over like...
- A fucking amateur.

777
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:56,010
- What?
- Put a lid on the bickering.

778
01:03:56,350 --> 01:03:58,520
Valerie did the best climbing.

779
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:02,600
Julie, keep up. And go easy.
You're not even halfway up, yet.

780
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:06,570
Go back down and get it right.

781
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:10,610
l don't believe this.
Taking a bend is pretty basic.

782
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:23,920
l'm starving. What are you eating?

783
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,500
- l'm not hungry.
- Get over it.

784
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:29,710
Bad day. Tomorrow will be better.
No big deal.

785
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:33,510
We're having a drink later.
Feel free to come. Room 5064.

786
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:34,970
Cool. Thanks.

787
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:40,350
You thinking of going?

788
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,690
No.

789
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:51,190
Do you want people
to think you're a lesbian?

790
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:54,780
No. l wasn't planning on going.

791
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:58,580
Are you hiding something?

792
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,000
What does the butch want
with you, anyway?

793
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:12,380
You look beautiful.

794
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,690
You can't stay.

795
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,860
Sleep in your room.

796
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,710
Girls, l'm back. Who wants some?

797
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:42,620
lt's too hard for Canadians.
Just kidding!

798
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:45,540
Do you want a drink?

799
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,420
You need Belgian thighs!

800
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
To climb the Wall!

801
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:54,960
l'm so glad you came. Really cool.

802
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,160
Julie, come play. Take the paddle.
Give me your drink.

803
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:14,830
Everyone, the Champion is playing!

804
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:20,260
- Just hit it.
- You can do it.

805
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:31,450
- What the hell are you doing?
- Where were you?

806
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:32,950
Nowhere.

807
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,910
Partying with the Belgians?

808
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,170
l was playing Wii.

809
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:42,170
What did the butch want?

810
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,340
l'm talking to you.
What did the butch want?

811
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:49,930
Bitch.

812
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:04,440
Let go!

813
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:08,650
When did you stop?
The fucking vials are full.

814
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:11,570
- l'm scared!
- When did you stop?

815
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:14,950
- A couple of days ago.
- You fucking idiot!

816
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:17,870
l can win clean!

817
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,880
What the fuck, Julie? Clean?

818
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,300
They're built like goons
and they're gonna destroy you.

819
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,670
ls that clean?

820
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:29,380
Nobody gets to the podium clean.
Clean, you come in twelfth!

821
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,660
Take an extra dose
today and tomorrow.

822
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,200
You should be fine for the race.

823
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,040
lt's too soon.

824
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:01,920
You don't care about losing, then?

825
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:05,210
lf you stop the stuff,
you'll stop winning!

826
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,800
And what will everyone think?

827
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,340
"Minor doping scandal and, oops,
she stops winning."

828
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:14,930
Fucking brilliant.

829
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:19,230
No more sponsors, money, nothing.
We're screwed.

830
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:22,440
l'm scared l'll die.

831
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:31,150
What are you doing?
- None of this is yours.

832
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,740
Equipment. Clothes.
Even the bike belongs to Team Vita.

833
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:36,530
Leave my things alone.

834
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:39,370
You don't care? Fine.
l'll find someone who does.

835
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:40,710
Stop. lt isn't funny.

836
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:44,830
Enjoy your new day job, you crazy bitch.
You never finished high school.

837
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:33,550
Let's go.

838
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,520
C'mon, girls!

839
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:45,480
Keep going.

840
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,900
Keep tight together in the wind.

841
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,740
The pace is too slow.

842
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,110
OK, Valerie attack.

843
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,740
Valerie, l said: Attack!

844
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,250
- What about me?
- Valerie is attacking.

845
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:06,830
lt's the same plan,
but with Valerie attacking.

846
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,670
lt isn't complicated. Go!

847
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:10,250
Fuck.

848
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:44,790
Who is it?
- lt's Marie-Eve.

849
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,010
Are you OK?

850
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:59,090
Yes, l'm fine.

851
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:03,010
What JP did was wrong.

852
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,560
l... We're sorry.

853
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:08,310
lt's fine.

854
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:09,400
Julie?

855
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,650
Don't put up with it.
You're really good.

856
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,820
l don't know. Maybe...

857
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,780
There are other coaches.

858
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:21,990
Other teams.

859
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:26,330
Would it be better
if Valerie were lead?

860
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:28,040
No, l didn't...

861
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:30,630
Sure would be convenient...
What did she promise you?

862
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:34,170
- What are you talking about?
- Save your breath.

863
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:48,600
Hello?

864
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,230
Already?

865
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:57,820
l injected myself earlier.

866
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:00,030
Bravo.

867
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:01,860
A dose and a half.

868
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:04,450
Why are you telling me now?

869
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,450
lsn't that what you wanted?

870
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,450
OK.

871
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,880
You know what? l'm not going
to play your little game.

872
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:16,800
l'm here to make you win, OK?

873
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,380
That's why you pay me.

874
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:21,760
You pay me 50%
to make you win.

875
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:25,470
lt's no small feat.
What l do must be worth something.

876
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:30,890
But now, you're playing the victim.

877
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:35,400
Before Dr. Henri ratted you out,
you were happy

878
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,070
to inject yourself
and stand on podiums.

879
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:42,070
Don't pretend
you're trying to make me happy.

880
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:45,160
l don't want you to feel anything.

881
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:48,490
l don't want to stop, either.

882
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,670
l told you.

883
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:58,880
l'm scared.

884
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:03,090
You're done being scared.
lt's over.

885
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,300
- What's over?
- lt's over! l can't want it for you.

886
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:10,930
Look at you go.

887
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:14,440
The other girls
would kill to win this race.

888
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,310
But not you. No way.

889
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:24,030
Do you have makeup?
You look like shit.

890
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:26,160
You'll freak out your parents.

891
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,420
Are you sure you're fine?

892
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:38,040
- Yes, Mom.
- Nervous for the big day?

893
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:39,590
lt's all right.

894
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:43,050
l'm hungry, let's eat mussels.
lt's on me.

895
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:45,680
l can't. l have too much work.

896
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,430
And l have to train.

897
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,970
Take some time to eat.
lt'll do you good.

898
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:05,490
He's a French specialist who's followed
top athletes with irregularities.

899
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:07,870
He's proven it wasn't doping.

900
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:09,990
He's exactly the guy we need.

901
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:11,870
Some more white.

902
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,540
Your father hasn't stopped.

903
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:16,500
lt's really nice, but...

904
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,500
Money isn't an issue.

905
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:22,090
Vita will pay for
all medical procedures.

906
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:25,050
lf we have to go overseas,
we'll go.

907
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:27,890
But it's OK now, l have my licence.

908
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:31,930
We'd like you to see a doctor.
Settle this once and for all.

909
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:36,310
You're not in this alone.
People stare at us too.

910
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,690
Co-workers,
and especially neighbours.

911
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:42,440
Thank you.

912
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:44,780
Reporters won't stop.

913
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:47,280
lf you saw a specialist,

914
01:18:47,410 --> 01:18:49,110
it would shut everybody up.

915
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:51,950
You have nothing to lose.

916
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:56,710
What is it?
Why don't you want to go?

917
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:00,380
Of course l'll go.

918
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:03,130
Give me his number.
l'll take care of it.

919
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:04,800
lt's already booked.

920
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:21,980
- Where are JP and Valerie?
- We don't know.

921
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:25,360
- lt's an easy question. Where?
- Chill out.

922
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:28,650
- Relax.
- Don't worry, l'm not after your JP.

923
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:31,700
- You think you're good.
- Stop acting up.

924
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:34,370
Acting up? She's never done a thing.

925
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:37,450
She's been touring for ten years,
winning off of others...

926
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:41,330
Now she thinks she can win.
You'll be crushed.

927
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:42,750
You don't have what it takes.

928
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:46,170
Being second is easy.
But will you do what it takes to win?

929
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,670
Like suck the coach's cock?

930
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:50,260
ls that it?

931
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:01,400
Let go.

932
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,480
Let me go, fuck!

933
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:34,970
You want to stop?

934
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,060
Why?

935
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:40,390
l'm fed up.

936
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:43,400
Julie.

937
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:50,360
You're about to win the World Cup,
and you want to stop?

938
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:51,990
What's wrong?

939
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:54,200
l'm burnt out.

940
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,330
l'm tired.

941
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:59,500
That's why we want you
to see a doctor.

942
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,210
Would you stop bringing that up?

943
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:06,000
You know why l don't want to see one.

944
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:09,550
No, we don't.

945
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,550
Dad.

946
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:14,430
Stop.

947
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:17,350
You were there,

948
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,890
with me at Dr. Henri's.

949
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:22,690
Why...

950
01:21:23,730 --> 01:21:25,690
Why are you bringing this up?

951
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:29,570
lt was six years ago.
Why bring it up now?

952
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:33,490
What do you think Dr. Henri sold us?

953
01:21:34,450 --> 01:21:36,620
You were sick, Julie.

954
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:37,990
So what?

955
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,370
lt doesn't change what we bought.

956
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:42,710
lt was once.

957
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:44,500
Six years ago.

958
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:46,790
Calm down, Alain.

959
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:49,500
You were sick. lt was a one-time thing.

960
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:51,090
Just stop it.

961
01:21:52,170 --> 01:21:53,760
That's what we always said.

962
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:02,310
Did you keep taking it, Julie?

963
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,620
l'm sorry.

964
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,750
l'm just tired.

965
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:30,040
Then that means
everything is all right.

966
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:33,960
Everything is all right.

967
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:37,630
You're not on anything.

968
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,340
l'm not on anything.

969
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,220
Swear.

970
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,270
lt's all right, OK?

971
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:45,640
You're right.

972
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,350
l'll race tomorrow.

973
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,980
l can't...

974
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:52,270
... stop now.

975
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,280
Julie, swear you're on nothing.

976
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:01,280
l swear.

977
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:16,170
lt's what we always said.

978
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,020
Julie.

979
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:38,320
l've been looking for you.

980
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:53,420
That was quite a punch.

981
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:58,340
She had it coming, the hypocrite.

982
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:02,140
As if l'd ever replace you
with Valerie.

983
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:07,140
She'd have no qualms
stealing your place.

984
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,440
But l know who my star is.

985
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:17,360
l did it to get you back.

986
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:20,700
And it worked. Look at you.

987
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:25,530
The beast has risen.

988
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:34,840
Thanks.

989
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:50,310
Thank you
- Thanks.

990
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:16,630
Less than five minutes to start time.
There are only a few teams left

991
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:19,840
to check in before
they head to the start line.

992
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:23,590
Team USA is now being presented
to the crowd.

993
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:27,800
Cynthia, fueling up is at
Kilometre 40 and 80.

994
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:33,640
Jess, Marie-Eve,
protect Julie on flat terrain.

995
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:35,980
Less than a minute...

996
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,950
Just so it's clear with everyone...

997
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:49,370
Valerie, we're doing the initial plan.
Julie leads. You help her.

998
01:25:49,490 --> 01:25:50,830
Good luck.

999
01:25:57,790 --> 01:26:00,300
Start time in less than thirty seconds.

1000
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:08,470
Three, two, one.

1001
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:15,440
The Fleche Wallonne has begun!

1002
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,240
After the race,
we'll stop messing around, OK?

1003
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:16,330
l'm going to do what it takes.
l'll talk to Nathalie.

1004
01:27:16,710 --> 01:27:19,000
- What?
- l'll get a divorce.

1005
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,540
We'll really be together.

1006
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:28,010
Are you happy?

1007
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:47,400
We're at Kilometre 25.

1008
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:49,490
The peloton is in the plains.

1009
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:52,160
Where is she? lt's making me nervous.

1010
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:54,620
l don't like it.

1011
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:58,710
Sometimes, l'm afraid l'll lose you.

1012
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:03,380
l'm so afraid you'll quit.

1013
01:28:06,130 --> 01:28:07,760
That you'll quit on me.

1014
01:28:09,930 --> 01:28:11,430
Julie, where are you?

1015
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:14,260
Julie?

1016
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:16,430
What's wrong?

1017
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:19,350
Can anyone hear me?
- Yes.

1018
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:20,940
- Yes.
- Yes.

1019
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:22,190
Julie?

1020
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:27,190
Jess? Cynthia? ls Julie with you?

1021
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:28,820
No. She's behind.

1022
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:30,450
l'm near her.

1023
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:36,450
Your earpiece is off.
- l lost it.

1024
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:39,790
- She lost her earpiece.
- Give her yours.

1025
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,330
- She's gone.
- Gone where?

1026
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:44,630
Toward Valerie. I can't catch up.

1027
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:47,340
- Valerie? Are you with Julie?
- Yes.

1028
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:49,090
Give her your earpiece.

1029
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:50,380
No.

1030
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:55,010
If I tell you to give it,
then you fucking give it. Simple.

1031
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:58,640
l'm done coddling your princess,
so too bad.

1032
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:01,310
They're zipping through Andenne.

1033
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:04,810
The leaders of the peloton
are quickening the pace.

1034
01:29:07,610 --> 01:29:09,900
We won't let them get ahead. Let's go.

1035
01:29:10,030 --> 01:29:13,280
The French cyclist Catherine Moranger
is trying to escape.

1036
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:16,030
She's breaking away
and is now in the lead.

1037
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:20,870
What the hell is going on?!

1038
01:29:26,590 --> 01:29:28,750
l see everyone but our girl.

1039
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,420
Calm down, Alain. lt's not even midway, yet.

1040
01:29:31,550 --> 01:29:32,670
No, it's...

1041
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:34,590
l got it.

1042
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,140
lt's only coffee.

1043
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:37,890
Are you part of the break?

1044
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:40,850
- We're in front with Valerie.
- What for?

1045
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:43,850
lt's too early.
- We're following Valerie.

1046
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:46,350
Would you follow her off a bridge?

1047
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:48,900
I'll come when the gong hits.

1048
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,400
- Your damn coffee.
- Not my fault.

1049
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:52,690
Then l suppose it's mine.

1050
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:57,490
We mustn't ruin your nice shirt.

1051
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:02,450
No. We mustn't ruin my nice shirt.

1052
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:04,870
Not today.

1053
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:08,130
At Kilometre 40, the gap is widening.

1054
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:09,290
Suzanne.

1055
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:13,420
Permission to move ahead
to join my team

1056
01:30:13,550 --> 01:30:15,050
as soon as possible, please.

1057
01:30:18,890 --> 01:30:21,720
Team Vita, permission granted.

1058
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:25,440
Cynthia, go back to Julie.
See if she needs fuel.

1059
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:26,810
Do yourjob!

1060
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:29,110
Gotta do my job...

1061
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:40,120
Do you need fuel?

1062
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:45,660
Cynthia, I'm right behind you.
Come talk to me.

1063
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:48,250
Julie ignored me.
Marie-Eve needs water.

1064
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:51,920
What are you doing?

1065
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:54,510
Valerie is pushing us for nothing.

1066
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:57,050
She's unplugged herself,
so she can't hear.

1067
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:59,470
lt's a mess. lt's all fucked up.

1068
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:02,140
- Help Julie.
- She's working alone.

1069
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:05,180
She doesn't want help.
l'm done with her.

1070
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,790
Where's Valerie?

1071
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:28,080
We're nearing Kilometre 60.

1072
01:31:28,210 --> 01:31:32,380
There are two pelotons divided
by a 55-second gap.

1073
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,840
Moranger is still in the lead.

1074
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:38,090
- l'm alone. Let's team up.
- For how long?

1075
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:40,930
Until the Wall.
Then you're on our own.

1076
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:42,260
OK.

1077
01:31:44,810 --> 01:31:46,060
Hello?

1078
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:48,810
With who?

1079
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:51,270
Fine.

1080
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:53,900
After that, the deal's over.

1081
01:31:54,030 --> 01:31:54,980
OK.

1082
01:32:01,450 --> 01:32:03,410
Bravo! Bravo!

1083
01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:05,200
You're doing such a great job,

1084
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:06,910
Julie's with the Belgian butch.

1085
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,210
You're all fucking incompetent.

1086
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:11,790
Next year, find yourselves
another team.

1087
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,420
You're all useless!

1088
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:18,420
Fucking hell!

1089
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:35,230
We're at Kilometre 80
and nothing has changed.

1090
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:38,030
It's down to a 30-second gap.

1091
01:32:38,150 --> 01:32:40,610
In the lead, Moranger from France,

1092
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:42,780
Team Vita's Valerie Morin,

1093
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:46,370
Sandrine Bruquelle from Belgium,
and Miriam Bosquet from France.

1094
01:32:46,490 --> 01:32:48,500
She's unwell and burned out.

1095
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:51,460
It's stress.

1096
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,130
She wanted to quit.

1097
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,250
It's normal before a race.

1098
01:32:57,590 --> 01:33:00,800
You wouldn't let a child quit school.
You say no.

1099
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:03,720
But we did let her quit school.

1100
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:09,970
An attack at Kilometre 90.
Two racers have left the tail bunch.

1101
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:12,230
They're trying to catch up
to the leaders.

1102
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:15,610
If you leave,

1103
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:17,070
I'll die.

1104
01:33:18,730 --> 01:33:19,980
l'll kill myself.

1105
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:24,700
You don't know how much I love you.

1106
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,910
Say you love me.

1107
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:32,750
l love you.

1108
01:33:44,970 --> 01:33:46,300
Come on.

1109
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:47,760
Come on, goddamit.

1110
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:56,940
Canadian Julie Arseneau from Team Vita
and number 51 , Belgian Renalda Ducros,

1111
01:33:57,060 --> 01:33:59,480
are closing in on the leaders
past Kilometre 1 00.

1112
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:11,040
Go!

1113
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:13,250
l know you can do it. Do it!

1114
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:39,560
Numbers 31 and 51
have caught up to the leaders.

1115
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:02,590
We've reached it.

1116
01:35:02,710 --> 01:35:05,760
The Wall of Huy, a gruelling ordeal.

1117
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:09,340
This is where true climbers prove
what they're made of.

1118
01:35:23,070 --> 01:35:28,110
Welcome to the merciless Chicane,
where it's a hit or miss.

1119
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:39,750
World Cup leader Julie Arseneau

1120
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:43,340
is moving away
from longtime rival Renalda Ducros.

1121
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:14,330
Final sprint,
1 00 meters from the finish line.

1122
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:17,160
Julie Arseneau is ahead.
She's over the finish line!

1123
01:36:17,290 --> 01:36:20,160
It's a victory for Canadian Julie Arseneau,

1124
01:36:20,290 --> 01:36:22,380
the new World Cup Champion,

1125
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:27,010
with Renalda Ducros in second
and Catherine Moranger in third.

1126
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:28,880
What an incredible race.

1127
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:25,460
Ms. Arseneau?

1128
01:38:26,290 --> 01:38:28,130
Please follow me for your test.

1129
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:31,130
l'm coming.

1130
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:32,880
Champagne! Champagne!

1131
01:38:33,010 --> 01:38:35,880
Marie-Eve! Valerie! Come here.

1132
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:40,970
This champagne is amazing.

1133
01:38:41,970 --> 01:38:44,180
Here. We sure do deserve it.

1134
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:46,810
- l hope there's more than one case.
- Me, too.

1135
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:48,810
- More. More.
- l'm so emotional.

1136
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:50,730
- Tonight we're allowed.
- Yes.

1137
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:53,190
- Did you fall during the race?
- No.

1138
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:56,780
- Poor you. What happened?
- lt was while playing Wii.

1139
01:38:57,450 --> 01:39:02,410
lt feels weird. l knew you'd win.
But it just hasn't sunk in, yet.

1140
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:04,250
lt hasn't sunk in for me, either.

1141
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:07,040
The World Cup.

1142
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:08,830
The World Cup!

1143
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:12,000
- My little girl.
- The waiting is over.

1144
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:15,090
We told you there'd be
a bonus if you won.

1145
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:17,300
Here it is.

1146
01:39:19,390 --> 01:39:20,760
Open it.

1147
01:39:20,890 --> 01:39:22,260
Go on.

1148
01:39:31,070 --> 01:39:32,190
Damn...

1149
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,360
Not bad, huh?

1150
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:34,780
l don't believe it.

1151
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:37,740
- Cheers!

1152
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:39,570
- To Julie.
- Cheers!

1153
01:39:40,490 --> 01:39:42,870

- Come on!

1154
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:44,410
l'm just kidding.

1155
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,620
Are you happy, Julie?

1156
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:49,750
- Of course l am, Mom.
- l can barely keep it in.

1157
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:52,340
lf it were up to me...
The sky's the limit!

1158
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:54,170
The Olympics... Name it!

1159
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:56,710
Can we savour this victory first?

1160
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:58,420
l haven't said a word.

1161
01:39:59,470 --> 01:40:02,010

So?

1163

Wasn't it beautiful?

1164
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,060
Wasn't she amazing?
- You betcha!

1165
01:40:17,490 --> 01:40:18,950
Who told you that?

1166
01:40:22,410 --> 01:40:24,410
You didn't get tested after the race?

1167
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:30,120
l forgot.

1168
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,670
