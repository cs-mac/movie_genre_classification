Watch that line, now.
Watch that line.

00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,190
<i>- Po Lazarus
- Po Lazarus!</i>

00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,190
<i>Po Lazarus...</i>

4
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:00,390
<i>Well, the high sheriff,
he told the deputy</i>

5
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:07,590
<i>Won't you go out
and bring me Lazarus?</i>

6
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,190
<i>Well, the high sheriff,
he told the deputy</i>

00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:20,990
<i>Won't you go out
and bring me Lazarus?</i>

8
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,390
<i>Oh, bring him dead or alive</i>

9
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,190
<i>O Lord</i>

10
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,890
<i>Bring him dead or alive</i>

11
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,590
<i>Well, the deputy,
he told the high sheriff</i>

12
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:43,390
<i>Well, I ain't gonna mess
with Lazarus</i>

13
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,390
<i>Well, the deputy...
he told the high sheriff</i>

14
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:54,890
<i>Said I ain't gonna mess
with Lazarus...</i>

15
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,590
- Pick up that hammer there boy.
- Yes sir boss.

16
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,190
<i>Well, he's a dangerous man</i>

17
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:09,190
<i>O Lord, he's a dangerous man...</i>

18
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,890
Go on, hit it, go!

19
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,390
<i>One evening as the sun went down</i>

20
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,890
<i>And the jungle fire was burning</i>

21
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,490
<i>Down the track came a hobo hikin'</i>

22
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,990
<i>And he said, boys I'm not turning</i>

23
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,890
<i>I'm headed for a land that's far away</i>

24
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,290
<i>Beside the crystal fountains</i>

25
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,190
<i>So come with me, we'll go and see
the big rock candy mountains</i>

26
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,790
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

27
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,390
<i>There's a land that's fair and bright</i>

28
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,790
<i>Where the handouts grow on bushes</i>

29
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,490
<i>And you sleep out every night</i>

30
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,990
<i>Where the boxcars all are empty</i>

31
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,790
<i>And the sun shines every day</i>

32
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,190
<i>On the birds and the bees
and the cigarette trees</i>

33
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,390
<i>The lemonade springs
where the bluebird sings</i>

34
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,090
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

35
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,490
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

36
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,990
<i>All the cops have wooden legs</i>

37
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,590
<i>And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth</i>

38
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,090
<i>And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs</i>

39
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,490
<i>The farmers' trees are full of fruit</i>

40
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,890
<i>And the barns are full of hay</i>

41
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,190
<i>Oh, I'm bound to go
where there ain't no snow</i>

42
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,590
<i>Where the rain don't fall,
the wind don't blow</i>

43
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,190
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

44
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,690
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

45
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,890
<i>You never change your socks</i>

46
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,390
<i>And the little streams of alcohol</i>

47
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,690
<i>Come a-trickling down the rocks</i>

48
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,090
<i>The brakemen have to tip their hats</i>

49
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,390
<i>And the railroad bulls are blind</i>

50
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,890
<i>There's a lake of stew and of whiskey, too</i>

51
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,190
<i>You can paddle all around'em in a big canoe</i>

52
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,300
<i>In the big rock candy mountains...</i>

52
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,690
<i>In the big rock candy mountains...</i>

53
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,490
<i>The jails are made of tin</i>

54
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,690
<i>And you can walk right out again</i>

55
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,190
<i>As soon as you are in</i>

56
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,390
<i>There ain't no short-handle shovels</i>

57
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,790
<i>No axes, saws or picks</i>

58
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,290
<i>I'm a-goin' to stay
where you sleep all day</i>

59
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,390
<i>Where they hung the jerk
that invented work</i>

60
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,390
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

61
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,990
<i>I'll see you all this comin' fall</i>

62
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,090
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

63
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,790
Say,

64
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,390
any of you boys smithies?

65
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,890
Or if not smithies,
trained in the metallurgic arts,

66
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,790
before circumstances forced you
into a life of wanderin'?

67
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,390
Jesus! Can't I count on you people?

68
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,290
Sorry, Everett.

69
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,090
Well, all right.
If we take off through that bayou...

70
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,590
Wait a minute!

71
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,190
Who elected you leader of this outfit?

72
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,190
I figured it should be the one with
the capacity for abstract thought,

73
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,390
but if that ain't the consensus,
then hell, let's vote.

74
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,990
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly.

75
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,990
Well, I'm votin' for yours truly, too.

76
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,490
OK. I'm with you fellas.

77
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,390
Mind if we join you, old-timer?

78
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,590
Join me, m'son. Join me.

79
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,790
You work for the railroad, grandpa?

80
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,190
I work for no man.

81
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,290
- Got a name, do you?
- I have no name.

82
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,590
That may be why you had difficulty
finding gainful employment.

83
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,590
Y'see, in the mart of competitive commerce...

84
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,590
You seek a great fortune,

85
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,190
you three who are now in chains.

86
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,990
You will find a fortune,

87
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,490
though it will not be the fortune you seek.

88
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,790
But first...

89
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,590
first you must travel a long and difficult road,

90
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,390
a road fraught with peril, mm-hmm.

91
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,590
You shall see things...

92
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,890
wonderful to tell.

93
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,390
You shall see a... a cow...

94
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,990
on the roof of a cotton house, ha.

95
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:31,390
And, oh, so many startlements.

96
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,590
I cannot tell you how long
this road shall be,

97
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,890
but fear not the obstacles in your path,

98
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,390
for fate has...

99
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,690
vouchsafed your reward.

100
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,590
Though the road may wind,

101
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,290
yea, your hearts grow weary,

102
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,190
still shall ye follow them,

103
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:56,090
even unto your salvation.

104
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,090
No, the treasure's still there, believe me.

105
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,590
But how'd he know about it ?

106
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,590
I don't know, Delmar. The blind
reputedly possess sensitivities

107
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,590
compensating for lack of sight,

108
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,390
to the point of developing psychic powers.

109
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,990
Clearly, seeing the future
falls into that category.

110
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,090
It's not so surprising, then,
that one lacking earthly vision...

111
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,190
He said we wouldn't get
the treasure we seek,

112
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,990
on account of our obstacles.

113
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,890
What the hell does an ignorant old man know ?

114
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,790
Jesus, Pete. I told you
I buried it myself.

115
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,990
If your cousin still has this farm

116
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,390
and shoein' impedimenta
to restore liberty of movement...

117
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,490
Hold it right there!

118
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,290
You men from the bank?

119
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,990
You Wash's boy?

120
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,790
Yes, sir. Daddy told me to shoot
who's ever from the bank.

121
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,390
We ain't from the bank, young fella.

122
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,890
Yes, sir. I'm supposed to shoot folks
servin' papers.

123
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,590
- We ain't got no papers, neither.
- I nicked the census man.

124
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,890
Now, there's a good boy.

125
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,190
Is... is your daddy about?

126
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,790
Hello, Pete.

127
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,990
Who are your friends?

128
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,990
Pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr Hogwallop.

129
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:37,190
- My name's Ulysses Everett McGill...
- I'm Delmar O'Donnel.

130
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,990
How you been, Wash?

131
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,990
Been what, 12, 13 years ?

132
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,790
Yeah...

133
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,590
I expect you want them chains knocked off.

134
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,390
They foreclosed on Cousin Bishop.

135
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,390
He hanged hisself a year come May.

136
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,390
And Uncle Radcliffe ?

137
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,790
The anthrax took most of his cows.

138
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,590
The rest don't milk.

139
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,490
He lost a boy to mumps.

140
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,390
Where's Cora, Cousin Wash?

141
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,790
Couldn't say.

142
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:21,890
Mrs Hogwallop up and R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

143
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,090
She must have been lookin' for answers.

144
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,490
Possibly. Good riddance, as far as I'm concerned.

145
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,490
I do miss her cooking, though.

146
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,390
- This stew's awful good.
- Think so?

147
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,190
I slaughtered this horse last Tuesday.

148
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,890
I'm afraid she's startin' to turn.

149
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,890
<i>You are my sunshine</i>

150
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,890
<i>My only sunshine</i>

151
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,790
<i>You make me happy</i>

152
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,290
<i>When skies are grey</i>

153
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,890
<i>You'll never know, dear</i>

154
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,590
<i>How much I love you</i>

155
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,390
<i>Please don't take my sunshine away</i>

156
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:11,490
<i>That winds up the Pass The
Biscuits Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour.</i>

157
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,990
<i>This is Pappy O'Daniel</i>

158
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,990
<i>hopin' you been enjoyin'
that old-timey music.</i>

159
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,090
<i>And remember,</i>

160
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,590
<i>when you're fixing to
bake a mess of biscuits,</i>

161
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,590
<i>use cool, clear water</i>

162
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,790
<i>and good, pure, Pappy O'Daniel flour.</i>

163
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:33,090
Well, guess I'll be turnin' in.
Say, uh, cousin Wash,

164
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,390
I suppose it'd be the acme of foolishness

165
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,390
to ask if you had a hair net.

166
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,290
We got a bunch in yon bureau.

167
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,790
Mrs Hogwallop's, matter of fact.

168
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:47,390
Help yourself. I won't be needing 'em.

169
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,190
<i>You are my sunshine</i>

170
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,590
<i>My only sunshine</i>

171
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,190
<i>You make me happy</i>

172
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,890
<i>When skies are grey...</i>

173
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,190
All right, boys!

174
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,190
How's my hair?

175
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,590
It's the authorities! We got you surrounded.

176
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,690
Damn, we're in a tight spot.

177
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,790
Just come on out and grab at air!

178
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,390
And don't try nothin' fancy.

179
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,990
Your situation is pretty nigh hopeless.

180
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,790
- Damn ! We're in a tight spot!
- What in the Sam Hill...?

181
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,690
Pete's cousin turned us in.

182
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,990
What the hell you sayin'?!

183
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,990
Wash is kin!

184
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,290
Sorry, Pete!

185
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,990
I know we're kin, but they got this depression on.

186
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,890
I got to do for me and mine.

187
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,190
I'm gonna kill you, Judas Iscariot Hogwallop!

188
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,590
You miserable, horse-eatin' son of a...

189
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,390
Damn ! We're in a tight spot!

190
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,190
Damn his eyes!

191
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,090
Pa always said, "Never trust a Hogwallop".

192
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,690
Come and get us, coppers!

193
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,590
You leave us no choice but to smoke you out.

194
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,490
We're in a tight spot.

195
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,690
Light her up!

196
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,090
Hold up boys. Stop! Ain't you ever heard of negotiatin'?

197
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,590
We could talk this thing out. I hate fire !

198
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,390
You lousy, yella-bellied...
Pete, we need to keep to one voice here.

199
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,090
Careful with that fire now boys!

200
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,590
Light the loft, son.

201
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,990
Aah ! I hate fire!

202
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,190
Gapped-toothed, carpetbaggin',
motherless spawn of hell!

203
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,090
Step back. Damn it. Look out.

204
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,990
Holy Saint Christopher!

205
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,590
Get away from that vehicle Jim, she's liquid fire!

206
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,190
Take cover, boys! It ain't popcorn!

207
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:48,290
Scatter, boys!

208
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,190
God damn it!

209
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,390
Get in, boys!

210
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,990
I'm gonna R-U-N-N-O-F-T!

211
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,790
Come on, boys, come on! Come on!

212
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,990
What are you doing here ? You ought
to be in bed, clump snatcher.

213
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,190
You ain't the boss of me!

214
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,890
You candy-butted, car-thievin' sos-and-sos!

215
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,090
I curse your name!

216
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,990
Go back home and mind your pa!

217
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,990
What's the damn problem?

218
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,990
I can get the part from Bristol
in two weeks, here's your pomade.

219
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,990
Two weeks? That don't do me no good.

220
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,590
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.

221
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,990
Hold on. I don't want this pomade,
I want Dapper Dan.

222
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,990
I don't carry Dapper Dan, I carry Fop.

223
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,590
I don't want Fop, god damn it!
I'm a Dapper Dan man!

224
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,290
Watch your language young fella
this is a public market.

225
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,790
Now, if you want Dapper Dan, I can order
it for you... have it in a coupla weeks.

226
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,390
Well, ain't this a geographical oddity!
Two weeks from everywhere.

227
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,390
Forget it.

228
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,290
A dozen hair nets.

229
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,090
Well, didn't look like a one-horse town,

230
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,590
but try finding a decent hair jelly.

231
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:17,790
- Gopher, Everett?
- No transmission belt for two weeks.

232
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,590
Huh? They dam that river on the 21st.

233
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,090
- Today is the 17th.
- Don't I know it.

234
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,790
We got but four days to get to that treasure.

235
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,790
After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake.

236
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,790
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.

237
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,925
- That's right... Gopher, Everett?

238
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,390
But the old tactician's got a plan.

239
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,390
For the transportation that is, I don't know
how I'm going to keep my coiffure in order.

240
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,590
How's this a plan? How we gonna get a car?

241
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,090
Sell that. I figure you can only have
painful association for Wash.

242
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:51,690
"To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop,

243
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,290
from his lovin' Cora."

244
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:58,690
- "Amor fidel... is."
- It was in his bureau,

245
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,090
I reckon it'll fetch us enough
for a good used auto voiture

246
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,990
and a little leftover besides.

247
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,590
Whoo ! You got light fingers, Everett.

248
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,390
- Gopher?
- You miserable little snake.

249
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,390
You stole from my kin!

250
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,990
Who was fixin' to betray us.

251
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,190
You didn't know that at the time.

252
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,390
So I borrowed it till I did know.

253
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,490
That don't make no sense!

254
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,390
A fool seeks logic in the chambers of the heart.

255
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,990
What the hell is that singing?

256
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,790
Appears to be some kind of a... congregation.

257
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,490
Care for some gopher?

258
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,990
No, thank you, Delmar.

259
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,990
A third of a gopher'd only arouse my appetite

260
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,490
without beddin' her back down.

261
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,890
Oh, you can have the whole thing.

262
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,890
Me and Pete already had one.

263
00:16:54,190 --> 00:17:02,590
We ran across a whole... gopher... village.

264
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,690
<i>O brothers, let's go down</i>

265
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,490
<i>Let's go down, come on down</i>

266
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,990
<i>Come on, brothers, let's go down</i>

267
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,190
<i>Down in the river to pray</i>

268
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,090
<i>As I went down in the river to pray</i>

269
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,090
<i>Studyin' about that good old way</i>

270
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,590
<i>And who shall wear the starry crown</i>

271
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,990
<i>Good Lord, show me the way</i>

272
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,590
<i>O fathers, let's go down</i>

273
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,290
<i>Let's go down, come on down</i>

274
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,690
<i>O fathers, let's go down</i>

275
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,990
<i>Down in the river to pray</i>

276
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,990
<i>As I went down in the river to pray</i>

277
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,190
<i>Studying about that good old way</i>

278
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,590
<i>And who shall wear the robe and crown</i>

279
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,290
<i>Good lord, show me the way</i>

280
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,790
<i>O mothers, let's go down</i>

281
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,190
<i>Come on down, don't you wanna go down ?</i>

282
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,990
<i>Come on, mothers, let's go down...</i>

283
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,190
Well, I guess hard times flush the chumps.

284
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,390
Everybody's lookin' for answers.

285
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,790
Where the hell's he going ?

286
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,790
The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

287
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,790
<i>Good Lord, show me the way</i>

288
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,290
<i>O sinners, let's go down...</i>

289
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,790
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

290
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,890
Delmar's been saved.

291
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,990
Well, that's it, boys. I been redeemed.

292
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:51,290
The preacher done washed away
all my sins and transgressions.

293
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,190
It's the straight and narrow from here on out.

294
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,890
And heaven everlasting's my reward.

295
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:00,190
Delmar, what are you on about?
We got bigger fish to fry.

296
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,290
The preacher said all my sins is washed away,

297
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,390
including that Piggly Wiggly
I knocked over in Yazoo.

298
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,590
I thought you said you was innocent of that.

299
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,990
Well, I was lyin'.

300
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,790
And the preacher said that
that sin's been washed away, too.

301
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,190
Neither God nor man's got nothin' on me now.

302
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,190
Come on in, boys. The water is fine.

303
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,590
Come on boy, there, boy. Good doggy.

304
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,690
All right, boys, we got the scent.
He don't care if we bring'em back dead does he?

305
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,790
- The preacher said it absolved us.
- For Him, not for the law.

306
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,720
Surprised at you Pete,
I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.

307
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,690
- But they was witnesses seen us redeemed.
- That's not the issue, Delmar.

308
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,090
Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the
state of Mississippi's a little more hard-nosed.

309
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,590
You shoulda joined us Everett,
it couldn'a hurt none.

310
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,090
Hell, it woulda washed away
the stink of that pomade.

311
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,790
Join you two ignorant fools in a rediculous
superstition thank you, anyway...

312
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,190
and I like the smell of my hair treatment,
the pleasin' odour's half the point.

313
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,290
Baptism!

314
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,690
You two are just dumber than a bag of hammers.

315
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,790
Well, I guess you're my cross to bear.

316
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:21,690
Pull over, Everett. Let's give
that coloured boy a lift.

317
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,690
You folks going past Tishomingo?

318
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,690
Sure, hop in.

319
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,590
How you doin' son, name's Everett.

320
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,090
These two soggy sons of bitches
are Pete and Delmar.

321
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,990
Keep your fingers away from Pete's mouth, 
he ain't had nothin' to eat for 13 years,

322
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,390
'cept prison food, gopher and a little greasy horse.

323
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,390
Thanks for the lift, sir.
My name's Tommy, Tommy Johnson.

324
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,490
How you doin', Tommy?

325
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,590
Say, I haven't seen a house out here for miles.

326
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,290
What are you doin' out in the middle of nowhere?

327
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,090
I had to be at that there crossroads last midnight.

328
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,190
Sell my soul to the devil.

329
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,790
Ain't it a small world, spiritually speakin'?

330
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,990
Pete and Delmar just been baptised and saved.
I'm guess I'm the only one that remains unaffiliated.

331
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,290
It's no laughin' matter.

332
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,290
What'd the devil give you for your soul Tommy?

333
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,790
Well, he taught me to play this here guitar real good.

334
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,090
Oh, son, for that you traded your everlasting soul?

335
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,790
Well, I wasn't usin' it.

336
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,990
I've always wondered, what's the devil look like?

337
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,590
Well, 'course there are all manner
of lesser imps and demons Pete

338
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,290
but the great Satan hisself is red and scaly
with a bifurcated tail,

339
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,890
- and he carries a hayfork.
- Oh, no. no, sir.

340
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,390
He's white... as white as you folks.

341
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,390
With empty eyes and a big, hollow voice.

342
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:54,190
He loved to travel 'round
with a mean old hound, that's right.

343
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,290
He told you to go to Tishomingo?

344
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,190
Well, no sir... why, that was my idea.

345
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,190
I heard there's a man down there,

346
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,690
he pays folks money to sing into his can.

347
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,690
They say he pays extra if'n you play real good.

348
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,690
Tishomingo, huh?

349
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,390
How much he pay?

350
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,690
All right boys follow my lead.

351
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,890
Hello?

352
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,590
- Who's the honcho here?
- I am, who are you?

353
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:47,090
Well, sir, I'm Jordan Rivers,
and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys,

354
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,190
out of Cottonillia, Mississippi.

355
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,690
Songs of salvation to salve the soul.

356
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,590
Uh, we hear that you pay good money
to sing into a can.

357
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,990
Well, that all depends. You boys do Negra songs?

358
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:03,890
Um... Well, uh, sir, we are Negroes.

359
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,990
All except for our accomp... accomp...
the fella that plays the guitar.

360
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,290
Yeah, well, I don't record Negra songs.

361
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,790
No, I'm lookin' for some old-timey material.

362
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,050
Seem people can't get enough of it.

363
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,490
since we started broadcasting it
on the Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour,

364
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,890
so thank you for stopping by, but...

365
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,790
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys have been
steeped in old-timey material.

366
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,590
Heck, we're silly with it, ain't we boys.
- That's right.

367
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,790
That's right, we ain't really Negroes.

368
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,090
All except for our accompanist.

369
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,690
<i>I am a man</i>

370
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,590
<i>Of constant sorrow</i>

371
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:49,590
<i>I've seen trouble all my days</i>

372
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,990
<i>I bid farewell</i>

373
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,690
<i>To old Kentucky</i>

374
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,190
<i>The place where I</i>

375
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,990
<i>Was born and raised</i>

376
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,890
<i>The place where he</i>

377
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,390
<i>Was born and raised</i>

378
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,790
<i>For six long years</i>

379
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,490
<i>I've been in trouble</i>

380
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,290
<i>No pleasure here</i>

381
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,790
<i>On Earth I found</i>

382
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:26,090
<i>For in this world</i>

383
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,390
<i>I'm bound to ramble</i>

384
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,490
<i>I have no friends</i>

385
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,190
<i>To help me now</i>

386
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,890
<i>He has no friends</i>

387
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,490
<i>To help him now</i>

388
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,990
<i>Maybe your friends think</i>

389
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,690
<i>I'm just a stranger</i>

390
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,290
<i>My face you never</i>

391
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,790
<i>Will see no more</i>

392
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:58,790
<i>But there is one promise</i>

393
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,990
<i>That is given</i>

394
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,690
<i>I'll meet you on</i>

395
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,390
<i>God's golden shore</i>

396
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:09,190
<i>He'll meet you on</i>

397
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:14,190
<i>God's golden shore</i>

398
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,890
Whoo! Hot damn, son!
I do believe you did sell your soul to the devil!

399
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:24,290
Boy, that was some mighty fine
a-pickin' and a-singin'.

400
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,790
I'll tell you what.

401
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,190
Ahem. You come on in here, you...

402
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:32,690
you sign these papers here,
I'm gonna give you $10 apiece.

403
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:38,890
Uh, OK, sir, but Mert and...
Aloysious'll have to just sign x's.

404
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,990
Only four of us can write.
That'd be fine.

405
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,990
Hey, mister, I don't mean
to tell tales out of school,

406
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,890
but there's a fella in there'll pay
you $10 if you sing into his can.

407
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,090
I'm not here to make a record, you dumb cracker.

408
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,090
They broadcast me out on the radio.

409
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,090
That's Governor Menelaus "Pass-the-biscuits Pappy" O'Daniel.

410
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:05,290
He'd sure appreciate it if you ate his
farina and voted him a second term.

411
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:08,090
- Finest Governor we ever had in Mississippi.
- In any state.

412
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,570
Oh Lord yes, every parish or precinct...
He was making a bigger point...

413
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:13,585
Hey,ain't you gonna press the flesh, Pappy?
Do a little politickin'?

414
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:16,690
I'll press your flesh, you dim-witted son'bitch.

415
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,590
Don't you tell your Pappy how to court the
elecorate, we ain't one-at-a-timin' it here

416
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,490
we're mass communicatin'!

417
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,190
Oh, yes, that's a powerful new force.

418
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,790
Shake a leg, Junior.

419
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,290
Thank God your mammy died givin' birth,

420
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,990
she'd a seen ya, she'd a died of shame.

421
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,090
Well, hi there! How you doin'?

422
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:40,390
<i>Hard time yearnin' where you go</i>

423
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:45,990
<i>Times is harder than ever been before</i>

424
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,990
<i>And the people are driftin'</i>

425
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,590
<i>From door to door</i>

426
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,190
<i>Can't find no heaven</i>

427
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,590
<i>I don't care where they go</i>

428
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,190
<i>Say you had money</i>

429
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,790
<i>You better be sure</i>

430
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,790
<i>These hard times will drive you</i>

431
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,790
<i>From door to door</i>

432
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,390
Let's bed down here for the night.

433
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,090
Yeah, it stinks in that old barn.

434
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,690
Suits me.

435
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:46,590
Pretty soon it'll be nothin' but
featherbeds and silk sheets.

436
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,290
A million dollars.

437
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,390
Million point two.

438
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:58,190
- 500,000 each.
- 400, Delmar.

439
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:04,790
Pete, what are you gonna do
with your share of the treasure ?

440
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,490
Go out west somewhere.

441
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:11,190
Open a fine restaurant.

442
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,590
I'm gonna be the Maitre d'.

443
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,390
Greet all the swells.

444
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,790
Go to work every day in a bow tie...

445
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,990
tuxedo.

446
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,590
And all the staff say "yes, sir" and...

447
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,090
"no, sir"...

448
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,590
and "in a jiffy, Pete"...

449
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,790
And all my meals for free.

450
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,390
What about you, Delmar,

451
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,690
what are you gonna do with
your share of that dough?

452
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,490
I'm gonna visit them foreclosin' son of a guns

453
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,190
down at the Indianola Savings and Loan.

454
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:57,190
Slap that money on the barrel head
and buy back the family farm.

455
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:01,790
You ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.

456
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,790
What about you, Everett?

457
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,690
What you have in mind
when you stole it in the first place?

458
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:13,990
Ahem. I... didn't have no plan.

459
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,990
Well, that hardly sounds like you.

460
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,390
All right, boys! It's the authorities!

461
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,090
Your situation is purt'nigh hopeless!

462
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,590
Damn, they found our car.

463
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,790
We ain't got the time
and nary the inclination

464
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,390
to shoo you boys any further.

465
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,690
Damn, we got to skedaddle.

466
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:37,690
I left my pomade in the car,
maybe I can creep up.

467
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:42,090
Don't be a fool, Everett.
We got to R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

468
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:44,190
Where's Tommy?

469
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:49,390
Already lit out, scared out of his wits.

470
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,290
Let's go!

471
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,390
Well hell, it ain't square one.

472
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:59,490
Ain't no one gonna pick up three
filthy, unshaved hitchhikers.

473
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:03,590
And one of them a know-it-all
who can't keep his trap shut.

474
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,890
Pete, the personal rancour reflected in that 
remark I don't intend to dignify with comment.

475
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,190
But I would like to address your general
attitude of hopeless negativism.

476
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,090
Consider the lilies of the goddam field.

477
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,190
Or, hell, look at Delmar
as your paradigm of hope.

478
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,990
Yeah. Look at me.

479
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,990
Now, you may call it unreasoning optimism,
you may call it obtuse,

480
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,290
but the plain and simple fact
is we got close to...

481
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,990
three days before they...

482
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:38,690
dam that river.

483
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:03,590
Is this the road to Itta Bena?

484
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,390
Uh... Itta Bena?

485
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:10,790
Itta Bena?
Stay on this here road.

486
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,190
That ain't right, I was thinking of...

487
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,690
- Take this road.
- Nah, nah, that ain't right.

488
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,990
Seems to me there's a road...

489
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,790
cow road that used to lead all the way...

490
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,190
Well, most of the way...
Er, that ain't right, either.

491
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:32,090
- Hop on in while you give it a think.
- Right. Delmar.

492
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,790
Any of you boys know your way around
a Walther PPK ?

493
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:47,290
Well see that' where we can't help ya,
I don't believe it's in Mississippi.

494
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,990
Friend, some of your folding
money has come unstowed.

495
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,890
Just stuff it down that sack there, will you?

496
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,190
You boys aren't bad men, I take it?

497
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,490
Well, it's funny you should ask.

498
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:02,590
I was bad till yesterday,
but me and Pete here been saved.

499
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,590
I'm Delmar, and that there is Everett.

500
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,490
George Nelson... It's a pleasure.

501
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,690
Grab the tiller will you, buddy?

502
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,690
Hand me that chopper.

503
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,890
Say, what line of work you in, George ?

504
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,390
Come and get me, coppers!

505
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:30,690
You flatfooted, lame-brained,
soft-ass sons of bitches!

506
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:35,790
Ah ha! No one can catch me! I'm George Nelson!

507
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,550
I'm bigger than any John, live or limp!

508
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:45,090
I'm ten an' a half feet tall still yet full growed!

509
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:51,390
Cows. I hate cows worse than coppers!

510
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,790
Oh, George... not the livestock.

511
00:32:54,990 --> 00:33:00,090
Come on, you miserable salaried
sons of bitches! Come and get me!

512
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,790
Come on, boys, we're going for the record.

513
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,490
Three banks in two hours!

514
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,790
OK, folks, hold the applause
and drop your drawers!

515
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:35,490
I'm George Nelson, and I'm here
to sack the city Itta Bena!

516
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,690
He's a live wire, though, ain't he?

517
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,890
All the money in a bag.
What are you lookin' at, grandpa?

518
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,590
Pardon me, George, you got a plan
for gettin' outta here?

519
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,390
Sure, boys.

520
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,590
Here's my plan. Ha ha!

521
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,390
They ain't never seen ordnance like this!

522
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,390
Thank you, folks.

523
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:57,490
And remember, Jesus saves
but George Nelson withdraws!

524
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,590
Go fix the auto voiture, Pete.

525
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,690
That's Babyface Nelson.

526
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,500
Who said that?

527
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,690
What ignorant, low-down, slanderisin'

528
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,990
son of a bitch said that?!

529
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:17,590
My name is George Nelson, get me?!

530
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,890
George, she didn't mean nothin'
by it, George.

531
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,090
George Nelson! Not Babyface!

532
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:28,290
You remember... and you tell your friends!

533
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,790
I'm George Nelson.

534
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,190
Born to raise hell.

535
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:53,390
Well, that was some fun though
wasn't it, George?

536
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,790
Yeah.

537
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,690
Almost makes me wish
I hadn'ta been saved.

538
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,190
Jacking up banks.

539
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,675
I can see how a fella'd
derive a whole lot of pleasure

540
00:35:02,676 --> 00:35:04,250
and satisfaction out of it.

541
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:09,190
- It's ok.
- Hoo, dawgies!

542
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,090
Well...

543
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:18,990
I'm takin' off.

544
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:27,190
You boys might as well keep my...
share of the riches.

545
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:32,075
Well, where are you going George?

546
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,190
I don't know... who cares?

547
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,790
Now, what do you suppose is eatin' George?

548
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:45,490
Well Delmar, they say that with
the thrill-seeking personality,

549
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,390
what goes up must come down.

550
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:50,690
Top of the world one minute, haunted by
meetin's the next.

551
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:55,390
Yes, sir, it's as if
our old friend George is a alley cat

552
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,490
and his own damn humours
swingin' him by the tail.

553
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,290
I wouldn't worry, Delmar.
He'll be back on top again.

554
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:07,990
I don't think we've seen
the last of George Nelson.

555
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:28,090
<i>Don't be saps for Pappy.</i>

556
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,590
<i>Homer Stokes for Governor.</i>

557
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,190
<i>Let's sweep this state clean.
Vote for Stokes, brother.</i>

558
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:38,890
<i>...meet with the darkness
and strive</i>

559
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:43,790
<i>The sunny side you also may view</i>

560
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:46,290
<i>Keep on the sunny side</i>

561
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,390
<i>Always on the sunny side</i>

562
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,790
Aw, shh. Hang on! 
I'm gonna slap one on here.

563
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,190
Folks, here's my cousin Ezra's niece,

564
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,290
Eudora from out of Greenwood,

565
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:59,490
doin' a little number with her
cousin Tom-Tom,

566
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:04,390
which I predict you gonna
enjoy thoroughly.

567
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:10,990
Now, what can I do you for Mr French?

568
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,190
How can I lay a hold of
them Soggy Bottom Boys?

569
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,790
Soggy Bottom?
No, I don't precisely recollect them.

570
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,390
They cut a record in here a few days ago
with an old-timey harmony thing,

571
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,590
with a guitar accomp'ny... accomp'ny....

572
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,790
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember them.

573
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,790
Coloured fellas, I believe.
Aha

574
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,390
Yes sir, they a fine bunch of boys.

575
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,890
They sang into yonder can then skedaddled.

576
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:38,690
Well, that record is just
goin' through the goddam roof.

577
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,190
- They playin' it far away as Mobile.
- No.

578
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,290
Whole damn state's goin' apey.

579
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,690
Well, it was a powerful air.

580
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,290
Hot damn, we gotta find them boys
and sign 'em to a big fat contract.

581
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:54,190
Hell's bells Mr Lund, if we don't
the goddam competition will.

582
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,590
Oh...mercy, yes... we got
to beat that competition.

583
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,290
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

584
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,190
<i>Fly away</i>

585
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:05,890

Delmar! Over here!

606
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:38,190
Do you have the Soggy Bottom Boys
performing "Man of Constant Sorrow"?

607
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,990
No, ma'am. We got a new shipment in yesterday.

608
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:44,390
Sorry, but we just can't
keep 'em on our shelves.

Delmar, come on. Go.

622
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:40,690
<i>...I'll fly away, fly away</i>

623
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:43,790
<i>I'll fly away, fly away</i>

624
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:49,790
<i>In the mornin'</i>

625
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:00,190
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

626
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,490
Shut up, Delmar.

627
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:14,790
Pull over! Pull over!

628
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:23,590
Guess old Pete's got the itch.

629
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:28,890
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

630
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,690
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

631
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,090
<i>Your mama's gone away,
and your daddy's gonna stay</i>

632
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:42,390
<i>Didn't leave nobody but the baby</i>

633
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:46,790
<i>- Go to sleep, you little baby...
- Howdy do, ladies? Name of Pete.</i>

634
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,390
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

635
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:54,090
<i>Everybody's gone
in the cotton and the corn</i>

636
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:59,290
<i>Didn't leave nobody
but the baby...</i>

637
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,890
You gonna introduce us?

638
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:04,690
I don't know their names.
I seen 'em first!

639
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:08,190
<i>You're sweet, little baby</i>

640
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:12,790
<i>Honey in the rock,
and the sugar don't stop</i>

641
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:17,790
<i>Gonna bring a bottle to the baby</i>

642
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:22,790
<i>Don't you weep, pretty baby</i>

643
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,390
<i>Don't you weep, pretty baby</i>

644
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,390
<i>She's long gone
with her red shoes on</i>

645
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:35,490
<i>Gonna need another
lovin' baby...</i>

646
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:39,890
Ladies, my name is
Ulysses Everett McGill,

647
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:45,490
and, well, you three ladies
are about the... the prettiest...

648
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,690
<i>You and me
and the devil makes three</i>

649
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:53,990
<i>Don't need no other
lovin' baby...</i>

650
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,290
Water lilies, uh...

651
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:59,890
<i>- Go to sleep, you little baby...
- Corn liquor.</i>

652
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:03,290
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

653
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,990
<i>You and me
and the devil makes three</i>

654
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:13,190
<i>Don't need no other lovin' baby</i>

655
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:17,690
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

656
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:21,190
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

657
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,890
<i>Your mama's gone away,
and your daddy's gonna stay</i>

658
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:31,290
<i>Didn't leave nobody but the baby</i>

659
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:35,490
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

660
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:39,490
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

661
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:43,190
<i>Come lay your bones
on the alabaster stones</i>

662
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:50,390
<i>And be my everlovin' baby</i>

663
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:32,190
Everett.

664
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:36,390
- Everett.
- My hair!

665
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,590
Look at this.

666
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,390
Pete...

667
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,790
Where the heck are you?! Pete...

668
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:02,190
We ain't got time for hide-and-seek!

669
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,990
We ain't got time for shenanigans!

670
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,290
Sweet Jesus, Everett.

671
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:11,190
They left his heart!

672
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,590
Delmar, what the heck's got into you?

673
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,190
Can't you see it, Everett?

674
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:40,690
Them sirens did this to Pete.

675
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:46,490
They loved him up
and turned him into a... horny toad.

676
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:51,890
Pete!

677
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:12,890
Pete, it's me... Delmar.

678
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:16,390
It's me... Delmar.

679
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,790
- Everett.
- Delmar, what the...?!

680
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:23,290
What are we gonna do?!

681
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,490
I'm not sure that's Pete.

682
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,890
Of course it's Pete. Look at him.

683
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:42,990
We got to find some kind of...
wizard can change him back.

684
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:48,690
I'm just not sure that's Pete.

685
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:53,490
You can't display a toad
in a fine restaurant.

686
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,190
Folks'd go off their feed.

687
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:58,990
Hey. I just don't think it's right
keeping him under wraps

688
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,790
like we was ashamed of him.

689
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,990
If it is Pete, I am ashamed of him.

690
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:07,090
He got what he deserved, fornicatin'
with some whore of Babylon.

691
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,590
These things don't happen
for no reason.

692
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:11,690
It's a judgment on Pete's character.

693
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:16,290
Well, the two of us was
fixin' to fornicate.

694
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:19,090
You'll have to excuse
my rusticated friend,

695
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:22,390
unaccustomed as he is
to city manners.

696
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:26,790
I guess we'll have a couple of steaks

697
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:28,890
and some, uh, gratiné potatoes,

698
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:31,590
and wash it down with
your finest bubbly wine.

699
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,090
Oh, I don't suppose you have any...

700
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,590
Maybe the chef could prepare...

701
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:42,190
Just bring us a couple
of leaves of raw cabbage.

702
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:44,190
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

703
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:48,390
I don't believe I've seen you boys.
Allow me to introduce myself.

704
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:52,390
Name of Daniel Teague,
known around here as Big Dan Teague,

705
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:55,290
Or, pressed for time, Big Dan!
Tout court!

706
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:59,790
Name's Ulysses Everett McGill.
My associate, Delmar O'Donnel.

707
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:03,490
I detect like me,
you're endowed with the gift of gab.

708
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:07,490
I flatter myself such is the case.
In my line, it's plum necessary.

709
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:10,990
The one thing you don't want...

710
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:13,490
is air in the conversation.

711
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,790
Again we agree.
What kind of work you do, Big Dan?

712
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:19,390
Sales, Mr McGill, sales!
What do I sell?

713
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:21,490
The truth, every blessed word of it.

714
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,690
From Genesis down to Revelations.

715
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:26,490
Yes, the word of God,
which, let me say,

716
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:30,390
there's damn good money in
during these times of woe and want.

717
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:34,590
People want answers, and Big Dan
sells the only book that's got 'em.

718
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:39,290
And what do you do,
you and your, uh, tongue-tied friend?

719
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,590
We...

720
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,390
We're adventurers, sir,

721
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,190
pursuing an opportunity,

722
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:47,290
but we're open to others as well.

723
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:50,390
I like you.
I'm gonna propose you a proposition.

724
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:54,990
You cover my bill for now,
get your dinner wrapped picnic-style

725
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,590
and we'll retire to more private environs,

726
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:00,390
where I'll reveal how to make
vast amounts of money

727
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,490
in the service of God Almighty.

728
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:06,290
Well, why not? I can use
some civilised conversation.

729
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:08,690
Don't forget your shoe box, friend.

730
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:12,090
Damn shame!
Goddam campaign is lagging!

731
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:16,590
We need a shot in the arm.
Hear me, boys ? In the goddam arm!

732
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:20,990
Election held tomorrow, that
sumbitch Stokes would win in a walk!

733
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,990
He's the reform candidate, Daddy.

734
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,890
- Yeah?
- A lot of people like that reform.

735
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,190
Maybe we should get us some.

736
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,490
I'll reform you,
you soft-headed son of a bitch.

737
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:35,290
How we gonna run reform?
We're the incumbent!

738
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:38,490
Is that the best you can
come up with? Reform?!

739
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:41,090
Weepin' Jesus on the cross.

740
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,790
That's it!

741
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:45,590
Start drafting my concession speech
right now.

742
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,290
OK, Pappy.

743
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:49,890
I'm just making a point,
you stupid son'bitch.

744
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:53,390
- Give me back that hat!
- Pappy's just makin' a point.

745
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:56,090
Shut up!

746
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:14,190
Thank you for that fricassee.
I'm a man of large appetites.

747
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:17,190
Even with lunch under my belt,
I was a mite peckish.

748
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,390
Our pleasure.

749
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,790
Thank you as well for
the conversational hiatus.

750
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,990
I generally refrain
from speech during gustation.

751
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:28,090
There are those who attempt
both at the same time.

752
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:30,190
I find it coarse and vulgar.

753
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:33,390
- Where were we ?
- Making money in the Lord's service.

754
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:36,890
Friend, when you do speak,
it's to the point and I salute you.

755
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:38,890
Yes, Bible sales.

756
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:43,190
The trade is not complicated.
There are two things to learn...

757
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:44,990
One, find a wholesaler,

758
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:46,690
the word of God in bulk, as it were.

759
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:50,790
Two, recognise your customer.
Who are you dealing with?

760
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:53,790
It's an exercise in psychology,
so to speak.

761
00:50:54,090 --> 00:51:01,390
And it is that which I propose
to give you a lesson in right now.

762
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:05,090
I like to think I'm an astute
observer of the human scene, too.

763
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:08,390
No doubt, brother.
I figured as much at the restaurant.

764
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:13,590
That's why I invited you all out here
for this advanced tutorial.

765
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,290
What's going on, Big Dan?

766
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:19,390
It's all about the money, boys!
That's it!

767
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:24,190
Gol... durned... money!

768
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:25,290
I don't get it.

769
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:31,990
I'll just take your show cards.

770
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:43,590
And whatever you got in the hole.

771
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:50,990
What the...
there ain't nothin' but a damn toad.

772
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:56,890
No, you don't understand.
That's Pete.

773
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:00,690
Pete.

774
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:04,690
You know these give you warts?

775
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:13,090
End of lesson.

776
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,990
So long, boys. Hee hee!

777
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:20,290
See you in the funny papers.

778
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:24,590
Y'all seen the end of Big Dan Teague.

779
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:50,590
Where are they? Talk,
you unreconstructed whelp of a whore!

780
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:52,590
Where they headed?

781
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:55,990
- Aah!
- Your screams won't save your flesh.

782
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:58,590
- Aah!
- Only your tongue is, boy.

783
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:01,290
- Where they headed?
- Aah!

784
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:16,090
Whoa, hound.

785
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:25,590
Sweet summer rain.

786
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:30,590
Like God's own mercy.

787
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,590
Your two friends
have abandoned you, Pete.

788
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:36,890
They don't seem to care
about your hide.

789
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:44,890
OK.

790
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:51,990
Stairway to heaven, Pete.

791
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,490
We shall all meet by and by.

792
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:58,290
God damn it!

793
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:01,790
God forgive me!

794
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,990
Hold.

795
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:18,390
Believe me, Delmar, he would
have wanted us to press on.

796
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:22,590
Pete, rest his soul,
was one sourass son of a bitch

797
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:25,790
and not given to pointless sentimentality.

798
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:28,890
It don't seem right getting
the treasure without him.

799
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:32,090
Maybe it's for the best
he was squished.

800
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:35,590
Why, he... was barely
a sentient being and...

801
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:38,990
when we clean up and
get a little smellum in our hair,

802
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:41,890
we're gonna feel
100% better about ourselves

803
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,990
and about... life in general.

804
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:50,090
Must be near Parchment Farm.

805
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,890
Sorry sons of bitches.

806
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:55,590
Seems like a year ago
we busted off the farm.

807
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:06,090
Pete got a brother?

808
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:10,190
Not that I'm aware.

809
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:13,690
Heat must be getting to me.

810
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:25,990
<i>Oh, the storm and its fury
raged today</i>

811
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:30,590
<i>Crushing hope
that we cherished so dear</i>

812
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:35,790
<i>The cloud and storm
will in time pass away</i>

813
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:40,990
<i>And the sun again
will shine bright and clear</i>

814
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:43,690
<i>Keep on the sunny side</i>

815
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:46,090
<i>Always on the sunny side</i>

816
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:50,390
<i>Keep on the sunny side of life</i>

817
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:52,690
<i>It will help us every day</i>

818
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:54,990
<i>It will brighten all the way</i>

819
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:59,590
<i>If we'll keep on
the sunny side of life</i>

820
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:04,490
<i>If we'll keep on
the sunny side of life</i>

821
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:09,990
That was wonderful.
That sure was. Yes.

822
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:13,190
Now, I know The Sunnysiders
would agree with me

823
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:15,790
when I say that the great state
of Mississippi

824
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:19,790
cannot afford four more years
of Pappy O'Daniel!

825
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:22,690
Four more years of cronyism!

826
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:25,690
Nepotism ! Rascalism!

827
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:29,590
Of service to the interests!

828
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:32,790
Now, the choice, she's a clear'un.

829
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:36,490
Pappy O'Daniel, slave of the interests...

830
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:40,790
Homer Stokes, servant of
the little man. Right, little fella?

831
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,190
He ain't lyin' !

832
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:46,190
Ladies and gentlemen,
the little man has admonished me

833
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:48,790
to grasp the broom of reform

834
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:51,390
and sweep this state clean!

835
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:54,590
It's gonna be,
"Back to the flour mill, Pappy"!

836
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:57,090
The interests can handle themselves!

837
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:01,090
Come Tuesday,
we're gonna sweep the rascals out!

838
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:06,890
Clean government
is yours for the asking!

839
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:11,590
Folks,
now the little Wharvey gals!

840
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:17,190
Wharvey gals ? Did he just say
"little Wharvey gals"?

841
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:19,490
Come here, girls.

842
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:21,490
What y'all gonna sing for us ?

843
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:23,590
"In the Highways".

844
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:26,890
- God damn it all!
- You know them gals, Everett?

845
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:28,290
<i>In the highways</i>

846
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:30,090
<i>In the hedges</i>

847
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:32,590
<i>In the highways</i>

848
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:34,290
<i>In the hedges</i>

849
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:36,790
<i>In the highways</i>

850
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:38,790
<i>In the hedges</i>

851
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:42,790
<i>I'll be somewhere
a-working for my Lord</i>

852
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:44,890
<i>I'll be somewhere a-working</i>

853
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:46,890
<i>I'll be somewhere a-working</i>

854
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:50,890
<i>I'll be somewhere
a-working for my Lord</i>

855
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:52,990
<i>I'll be somewhere a-working</i>

856
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:55,090
<i>I'll be somewhere a-working</i>

857
00:57:55,390 --> 00:58:00,390
<i>I'll be somewhere
a-working for my Lord</i>

858
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,390
Hey, girls!

859
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:04,790
Daddy! Daddy!

860
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:08,990
Daddy ? He ain't our daddy.

861
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:12,190
Hell I ain't.
What's this Wharvey? You're McGills.

862
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:14,690
Not since you got hit by that train.

863
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:16,390
What ? I wasn't hit by a train.

864
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:20,390
- Mama says you was hit by a train.
- Blooey! Nothin' left.

865
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:22,290
Just a grease spot on the L & N.

866
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:25,090
Damn it, I wasn't hit by any train!

867
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,790
Mama's got us back to Wharvey.

868
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:29,990
- That's her maiden name.
- You got a maiden name, Daddy?

869
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:32,190
Daddy don't have a maiden name...

870
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:33,590
That's your misfortune.

871
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:37,290
- And now mama's got a new beau.
- He's a suitor.

872
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,190
Yeah, I heard about that.

873
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,390
Mama says he's bona fide.

874
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,990
Mmm. He give her a ring ?

875
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:46,490
Yes, sir. A big 'un.

876
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,090
- Gold and gems.
- Mama checked it.

877
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:51,190
- It's bona fide.
- He's a suitor.

878
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:53,790
- What's his name ?
- Vernon T Waldrip.

879
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:55,690
- Uncle Vernon.
- Till tomorrow.

880
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:57,190
Then he's Daddy.

881
00:58:57,390 --> 00:59:00,990
I am the only daddy you got.
I am the damn pater familias.

882
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:04,590
But you ain't bona fide.

883
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:07,790
Where's your mama?

884
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:12,290
- At the five-and-dime.
- Buying nipples.

885
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:15,290
<i>This way</i>

886
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:19,490
<i>To take me home</i>

887
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:24,190
<i>Kiss me more...</i>

888
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:30,790
- Daddy!
- Hello, sugar! Ha ha!

889
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:32,690
How's my little girl?

890
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:34,490
Hi.

891
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:37,090
- Who the hell's that?
- Starla Wharvey.

892
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:39,090
Starla McGill, you mean.

893
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:42,090
- You never told me.
- Cos you was hit by a train.

894
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,690
Why are you telling our gals
I was hit by a train?

895
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:47,390
Lots of respectable people
been hit by trains.

896
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:49,390
Judge Hobby was hit by a train.

897
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:51,290
What was I supposed to say,

898
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:54,090
that you were jailed
and I divorced you from shame?

899
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:58,590
I take your point. But it puts me in
an awkward spot vis á vis my progeny.

900
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:05,090
Hello, Penny.
Is this gentleman bothering you?

901
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:07,090
You Waldrip?

902
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:10,390
Uh-huh. That's right.

903
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:24,590
You been using my hair treatment?

904
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:26,790
Your hair treatment?

905
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:30,190
Excuse me.

906
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:35,790
I got news. In case you hadn't
noticed, I wasn't hit by a train,

907
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:38,290
and I have travelled
many a weary mile

908
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:42,790
to be back with my wife
and my six daughters.

909
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:45,990
- Seven, Daddy!
- That ain't your daddy, Alvanelle.

910
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:47,590
Your daddy was hit by a train.

911
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:49,190
Penny, you stop that!

912
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:51,290
You stop it ! Vernon here's got a job.

913
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:54,590
Vernon's got prospects.
He's bona fide. What are you?

914
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:56,290
I'll tell you what I am...

915
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:59,590
I'm the pater familias,
and you can't marry him!

916
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,690
I can, I am and I will, tomorrow.

917
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:04,190
I gotta think about the Wharvey gals.

918
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:06,490
They look to me for answers.

919
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:08,890
Vernon can buy 'em
lessons on the clarinet.

920
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:12,790
The only good thing you
ever did was get hit by that train!

921
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:16,990
Well, you lying, unconstant succubus.

922
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:21,090
Whoa, whoa!
You can't swear at my fiancée!

923
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:25,990
Oh, yeah ?
Well, you can't marry my wife!

924
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:49,390
Who is that man?

925
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:52,190
He's not my husband.

926
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:57,990
Just a drifter, I guess.
Just some no-account drifter.

927
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:03,890
And stay out of the Woolsworth!

928
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:10,490
<i>I'll bet she does
imitations, too.</i>

929
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:13,590
Deceitful, two-faced she-wolf.

930
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:15,990
Never trust a female, Delmar.

931
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:20,590
Remember that precept and your time
with me won't have been ill-spent.

932
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:23,790
- OK, Everett.
- "Hit by a train".

933
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,490
Truth means nothing to a woman,
Delmar.

934
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:30,090
Triumph of the subjective.
You ever been with a woman?

935
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:33,890
Well, I've...
I got to get the family farm back

936
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:36,590
before I can start thinking about that.

937
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:38,690
That's right. If then.

938
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:42,790
Believe me, a woman's the
most fiendish instrument of torture

939
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:45,590
ever devised to bedevil the days of man.

940
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:48,490
Everett, I never figured you
for a pater familias.

941
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:52,990
Ohh, yes. I have spread my seed.

942
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:54,590
And look what it's...

943
01:02:56,490 --> 01:03:01,390
God damn it.
What the hell...?

944
01:03:56,990 --> 01:04:01,690
Ok boys, enjoy your picture show.

945
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:09,390
<i>I have no money, honey</i>

946
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:11,690
<i>How can I change ?</i>

947
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:17,190
Do... not... seek the treasure.

948
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:25,090
Do not... seek the treasure.

949
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:27,290
It's a bushwhack.

950
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:30,290
They're fixin' an ambush.

951
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:34,590
Do not seek the treasure.

952
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:42,990
We... we thought you was...

953
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:46,290
a toad.

954
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:57,590
We... thought...
you... was... a... toad.

955
01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:01,890
Do not seek the treasure.

956
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:06,290
Quiet there!
Watch the picture!

957
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:11,990
I signed that bill.

958
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:14,790
I signed a dozen agriculture bills.

959
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:17,690
Everyone knows I'm a friend of the farmer.

960
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:20,690
What I gotta do,
start diddling livestock?

961
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:23,990
We can't do that, Daddy.
We might offend our constituency.

962
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:29,390
We ain't got a constituency!
Stokes got a constituency!

963
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:31,590
Well, it's a well-run campaign.

964
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:33,590
Midget and broom and whatnot.

965
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:36,590
- Devil his due.
- Hell of an organisation.

966
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:39,890
- Say, I got an idea.
- What's that, Junior?

967
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:43,590
We can hire us a little fella
even smaller than Stokes's.

968
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:45,990
You slump-shouldered sack of nuts!

969
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:48,990
We'd look like a bunch
of johnny-come-latelys

970
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:51,090
bringin' out our own midget.

971
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:52,790
Don't matter how stumpy!

972
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:57,590
That's the goddam problem, people
think Stokes has got fresh ideas.

973
01:05:57,890 --> 01:05:59,890
He's au courant
and we're the past!

974
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:01,390
It's a problem of...

975
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:03,190
- Perception.
- Right.

976
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:06,190
- He's pulling our pants down.
- Gonna paddle some behind.

977
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:08,490
Ain't gonna paddle it. Gonna kick it.

978
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:12,190
- No, he's gonna paddle it.
- That's not a proper description.

979
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:19,090
- That's how I'd characterise it.
- It's more of a kickin' situation.

980
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:37,490
God... God forgive me.

981
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:41,790
I could not gaze upon that fireshow.

982
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:44,990
Pete.

983
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:49,590
- Hold still!
- Can't... stand much longer.

984
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:52,590
It was... it was
a mo-moment of weakness.

985
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:54,790
Quit babblin', we gotta skedaddle.

986
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:56,990
That's all I got.

987
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:58,790
They lured me out for a bathe

988
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:02,290
and then they dunked me,
trussed me up like a hog,

989
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:04,190
and turned me in for the bounty.

990
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:06,990
Shoulda guessed it.
Typical womanly behaviour.

991
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,590
We're lucky we left
before they came back.

992
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:11,490
We didn't abandon you, Pete.

993
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:13,790
We just thought you was a toad.

994
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:16,290
No, they never did
turn me into a toad.

995
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:19,190
Well, that was our mistake, then.

996
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:24,190
We was beat up by a Bible salesman
and banished from Woolworths.

997
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:27,290
Everett, was it the one branch
or all of them ?

998
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:30,190
Well, I ain't had it easy,
either, boys.

999
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:34,890
Frankly, uh, well, I...

1000
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:38,190
I spilt my guts about the treasure.

1001
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:45,190
I'm awful sorry I betrayed you, fellas.

1002
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:48,990
Must be my Hogwallop blood.

1003
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:51,590
That's all right, Pete.

1004
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:54,690
Awful white of you to take it
like that, Everett.

1005
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:57,390
I feel wretched.

1006
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:00,990
Spoiling your play for
a million dollar point two.

1007
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:04,090
You should rip out my guts.

1008
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,490
No, that's all right.

1009
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:12,990
You boys are true friends! Ohh!

1010
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:15,590
You're my beaucoup friends.

1011
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:19,590
Pete, I don't want you to
beat yourself up about this, eh?

1012
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:27,090
I can't help it, but
that's a... a wonderful thing to say.

1013
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:33,190
Yeah. Pete, uh...

1014
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:37,890
Well, fact of the matter is...

1015
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,590
Damn it...

1016
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:44,990
There ain't no treasure.

1017
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:48,890
Fact of the matter is
there never was.

1018
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:50,790
But...

1019
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:56,690
So where's all the money
from the armoured car job?

1020
01:08:56,790 --> 01:08:59,390
I never knocked over no armoured car.

1021
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:02,890
I was sent up for
practising law without a license.

1022
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:04,790
- But...
- I had to bust out.

1023
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:10,190
My wife wrote me she was
getting married, I gotta stop it.

1024
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:13,190
I had two weeks left
on my sentence.

1025
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:15,390
I couldn't wait, wedding's tomorrow.

1026
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:23,390
My added time for the escape,
I don't get out now till 19... 87.

1027
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:25,290
I am sorry about that.

1028
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:30,590
I'll be... 84 years old.

1029
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:34,590
I guess they'll tack on
50 years for me, too.

1030
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:38,990
Boys, we was chained together.
I had to tell you something.

1031
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:44,190
Busting out alone
was not an option. I'm sorry.

1032
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:47,890
84 years old.

1033
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:51,190
Well, I'll only be 82.

1034
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:54,090
You! You ruined my life!

1035
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,890
You ruined my life!

1036
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:59,090
I do apologise, Pete.

1037
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:03,490
84 years old!
I'm becoming Papillon!

1038
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:05,190
Delmar!

1039
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:12,890
Now, boys. Boys.

1040
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:32,390
<i>Eeny meeny meiny mo</i>

1041
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:13,790
<i>Oh death</i>

1042
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:18,890
<i>Whoa death</i>

1043
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:23,890
<i>Won't you spare me over
till another year ?</i>

1044
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:31,790
<i>Well, I am death, none can excel</i>

1045
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:36,190
<i>I'll open the door
to heaven or hell</i>

1046
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:38,990
<i>Whoa, death, someone would pray</i>

1047
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:43,790
<i>Could you wait to call me
another day ?</i>

1048
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:44,990
<i>Children pray...</i>

1049
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:49,590
That's Tommy. They got Tommy!

1050
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:51,790
Noose.

1051
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:54,890
<i>No longer prayin'...</i>

1052
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:59,390
Sweet Jesus, we got to save him.

1053
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:02,190
<i>I'll fix your feet
till you can't walk</i>

1054
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:07,290
<i>I'll lock your jaw
till you can't talk</i>

1055
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:10,690
<i>I'll close your eyes
so you can't see</i>

1056
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:15,190
<i>- It's very dark...
- The colour guard.</i>

1057
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:18,990
<i>Death, I come to take the soul</i>

1058
01:12:19,190 --> 01:12:23,590
<i>Leave the body and leave it cold</i>

1059
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:27,190
<i>Oh death</i>

1060
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:31,590
<i>Whoa death</i>

1061
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:37,290
<i>Won't you spare me over
till another year ?</i>

1062
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:41,590
Brothers!

1063
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:44,390
Oh, brothers !

1064
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:52,190
We have all gathered here to preserve
our hallowed culture and heritage

1065
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:58,190
from intrusion, inclusion and dilution

1066
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:01,090
of colour, of creed,

1067
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:03,290
and of our old-time religion.

1068
01:13:03,490 --> 01:13:07,790
We aim to pull evil up by the root

1069
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:13,790
before it chokes out the flower
of our culture and heritage.

1070
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:17,690
And our women,
let's not forget those ladies, y'all,

1071
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:20,690
looking to us for protection

1072
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:25,490
from darkies, from Jews, from papists,

1073
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:28,390
and from all those smart-ass folks

1074
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:31,290
say we come descended from monkeys.

1075
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,490
- That's not my culture and heritage.
- Yes!

1076
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:36,090
Is it yours?

1077
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:38,390
No!

1078
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:41,090
And so...

1079
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:43,190
we gonna hang us a Negra.

1080
01:13:56,590 --> 01:14:01,390
I ain't never harmed you,
neither of you gentlemen.

1081
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:26,190
I ain't never harmed nobody.

1082
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:29,990
- Hey, Tommy.
- Huh?

1083
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:31,990
Tommy, we come to rescue you.

1084
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:34,190
That's mighty kind of you boys,

1085
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:37,490
but I don't think nothing's
going to save me now.

1086
01:14:37,790 --> 01:14:41,490
The devil's come
to collect his due.

1087
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:43,590
Don't be crazy, Tommy.

1088
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:45,490
You don't wanna get hanged.

1089
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:47,790
Well, naw, I don't reckon I do,

1090
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:51,890
but that's the way it's working out.

1091
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:54,890
Tommy, I got a plan.

1092
01:14:57,790 --> 01:15:00,190
No!

1093
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:06,090
The colour guard is coloured.

1094
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:11,490
Who made them the colour guard?

1095
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:15,190
Run, boys!

1096
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:22,590
No, no, son!

1097
01:15:25,490 --> 01:15:29,990
Can't let that flag touch the ground!

1098
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:54,590
Get your hands off me.

1099
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:57,190
I can do this myself, get away from me.

1100
01:15:57,490 --> 01:15:59,290
We should hire this man away.

1101
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:01,790
- Good idea, Pappy.
- Hell of an idea.

1102
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:05,590
- Can't beat 'em, join 'em.
- He'll join us, run our campaign.

1103
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:09,690
- Power, wealth...
- No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.

1104
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:13,490
- Not with his blandishments.
- And powers of persuasion.

1105
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:16,690
- What's his name again?
- The campaign manager?

1106
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:18,590
- Waldrip.
- Vernon Waldrip.

1107
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:22,190
- Vernon T. Waldrip.
- Hmm.

1108
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:29,190
It's invitation only.

1109
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:32,190
- We'll have to sneak in.
- Hold on.

1110
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:33,790
Wait a minute.

1111
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:36,190
Who elected you leader of this outfit?

1112
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:40,390
Since we've been following your lead,
we got nothing but trouble.

1113
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:43,290
I've gotten this close
to being strung up

1114
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:46,390
and consumed in a fire
and whipped no end

1115
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:48,390
and sunstroked and soggied.

1116
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:49,990
And turned into a frog.

1117
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:51,590
He wasn't turned into a frog.

1118
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:55,890
Almost loved up, though.

1119
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:58,990
So, you're against me now, too?

1120
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:02,690
Is that how it is, boys ?

1121
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:09,690
The whole world and God Almighty...
now you?

1122
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:14,390
I guess I deserve it.

1123
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:18,090
Boys...

1124
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:21,190
I know that I made
some tactical mistakes,

1125
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:24,390
but if you just stick with me,
I got a plan.

1126
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:26,890
Believe me, we can fix this thing.

1127
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:29,490
I'll get my wife back, we'll leave.

1128
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:36,190
Goddam disgrace!

1129
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:38,890
Made a travesty
of the entire evening.

1130
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:42,790
Ohh ! What I wouldn't give
to get a hold of those agitators.

1131
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:46,590
Whoever heard of such behaviour,
even amongst the coloured ?

1132
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:51,290
Mulattos, maybe. I suspect some
miscegenation in their heritage.

1133
01:17:51,490 --> 01:17:54,090
Using a Confederate flag
as a missile!

1134
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:57,490
Crazy! No one's ever gonna believe
we're a real band.

1135
01:17:57,690 --> 01:18:00,490
I just gotta get close enough
to talk to her.

1136
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:03,990
Comin' with us got more future than
marrying a guy called Waldrip.

1137
01:18:04,190 --> 01:18:06,590
I'm goddam bona fide.
I got the answers.

1138
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:09,990
Everett, my beard itches.

1139
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:25,090
"In the Jailhouse Now", fellas.
Neighbourhood of B.

1140
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:36,790
Penny. Ahem.

1141
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:41,790
- It's me.
- No.

1142
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:43,190
Honey!

1143
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:46,990
<i>I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob</i>

1144
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:49,790
<i>He used to steal, gamble and rob</i>

1145
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:54,990
<i>He thought he was
the smartest guy around</i>

1146
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:56,490
<i>Well, I...</i>

1147
01:18:56,790 --> 01:19:01,290
We're leaving the state, pursuing
opportunities in another venue.

1148
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:03,490
I got big plans.

1149
01:19:03,790 --> 01:19:06,390
Not minstrels, I'm going to be a dentist.

1150
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:10,990
I know this guy
who'll print me up a license.

1151
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:14,290
<i>He's in the jailhouse now</i>

1152
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:17,890
<i>Well, I told him once or twice</i>

1153
01:19:18,190 --> 01:19:22,090
<i>To stop playin' cards
and a-shootin' dice</i>

1154
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:25,690
<i>He's in the jailhouse now</i>

1155
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:47,290
<i>Bob liked to play his poker...</i>

1156
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:51,490
Why, that is an improper suggestion.

1157
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:56,590
I can't switch sides
in the middle of a campaign...

1158
01:19:56,790 --> 01:20:00,190
especially to work for a man
who lacks moral fibre.

1159
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:03,590
Moral fibre?
Why, you pasty-face son'bitch.

1160
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:05,290
I invented moral fibre.

1161
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:09,690
Pappy was displaying rectitude and
high-mightyest when that egghead you work for

1162
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:11,190
was still messin' his drawers!

1163
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:14,090
- Psst! Honey.
- Go away.

1164
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:16,590
I want to be what
you want me to be, honey.

1165
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:19,590
I want you and the gals
to come with me.

1166
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:24,390
<i>To stop playin' cards
and a-shootin' dice...</i>

1167
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:27,890
What are you doing here, Pappy ?

1168
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:30,090
Why I bet someone let on we were
giving out liquor.

1169
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:33,200
You'll be laughing out the other side
of your face come November.

1170
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:34,990
Pappy Daniel'ill be laughin' then.

1171
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:38,790
- Not out the other side of his face though
- No, no, no, just the regular side.

1172
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:54,190
They're my daughters, too, Penny.

1173
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:55,890
Ain't you ever heard of...?

1174
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:58,390
<i>In constant sorrow</i>

1175
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:18,690
<i>I am the man</i>

1176
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:21,490
<i>Of constant sorrow</i>

1177
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:24,090
<i>I've seen trouble...</i>

1178
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:26,890
Hot damn !
It's the Soggy Bottom Boys !

1179
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:31,590
<i>I bid farewell</i>

1180
01:21:31,790 --> 01:21:33,690
<i>To old Kentucky</i>

1181
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:39,290
<i>The place where
I was born and raised</i>

1182
01:21:39,490 --> 01:21:41,890
<i>The place where he</i>

1183
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:46,290
<i>Was born and raised...</i>

1184
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:07,190
Holy moly! These boys are a hit!

1185
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:09,790
But, Pappy, they's integrated.

1186
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:12,190
Wait a minute.

1187
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:14,790
Folks don't mind they's integrated.

1188
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:18,890
You's miscegenated.
All you boys is miscegenated!

1189
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:20,290
Gimme microphone!

1190
01:22:20,590 --> 01:22:23,590
Gimme microphone!
Gimme microphone!

1191
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:29,990
These boys isn't white.
These boys isn't white.
Hell, they ain't even old-timey.

1192
01:22:30,190 --> 01:22:31,590
Look, I happen to know ladies and gentlemen,

1193
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:34,490
that this band of miscreants here,
this very evening,

1194
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:39,750
interfered with a lynch mob
in the performance of its duties.

1195
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:41,590
It's true!

1196
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,190
See I belong to a certain secret society.

1197
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:47,290
I don't believe I gotta
mention its name, you know?

1198
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:49,890
Let 'em play! Go on!

1199
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:53,490
And these boys here,

1200
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:57,290
they trampled all over our
venerated observances and rituals.

1201
01:22:57,490 --> 01:23:00,290
Now, this here music is over, all right!

1202
01:23:00,490 --> 01:23:01,990
And I have... No! Hey!

1203
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:04,590
Hey, I ain't... listen to me.

1204
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:06,790
Folks, listen to me. I...

1205
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:09,990
These boys desecrated a fiery cross.

1206
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:13,390
We's all havin' a good time!

1207
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:17,490
And they's convicts, folks,
fugitives escaped off the farm.

1208
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:21,390
Now folks these boys gotta
be remanded to authorities.

1209
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:22,890
Criminals!

1210
01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:25,390
And I have it from the highest authority

1211
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:28,590
that that Negra sold his soul to the devil!

1212
01:23:30,490 --> 01:23:33,490
Wait, wait, wait a minute, folks.
No, it's true!

1213
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:35,490
It's true...


1214
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:36,890
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, folks.

1215
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:40,090
Is you is, or is you ain't
my constituency?

1216
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:41,290
No!

1217
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:43,990
<i>Is you is, or is you ain't
my constituency?</i>

1218
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:46,190
No!

1219
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:48,890
Is you is...

1220
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:53,390
Is you is, or is you ain't my constituency?

1221
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:55,990
Oh, come on, folks.

1222
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:57,590
No. It's Homer now.

1223
01:23:57,890 --> 01:23:59,790
I'm a friend of the little man.

1224
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:13,890
This is not fair! Hey! Come on!

1225
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:22,390
Come on, we got a little
misunderstanding here. God damn!

1226
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:31,090
<i>It's fair to tell</i>

1227
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:33,790
<i>My only lover</i>

1228
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:36,290
<i>I never expect</i>

1229
01:24:36,590 --> 01:24:39,990
<i>To see you again</i>

1230
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:44,490
<i>For I'm bound to ride</i>

1231
01:24:44,690 --> 01:24:47,290
<i>That northern railroad</i>

1232
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:52,190
<i>Perhaps I'll die upon that train</i>

1233
01:24:52,490 --> 01:24:57,790
<i>Perhaps he'll die
upon his train...</i>

1234
01:24:58,090 --> 01:25:01,390
God damn! Opportunity knocks!

1235
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:03,790
Get out of my way!

1236
01:25:04,090 --> 01:25:06,490
<i>I'm just a stranger</i>

1237
01:25:06,690 --> 01:25:09,190
<i>In case you ever</i>

1238
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:11,590
<i>See your man...</i>

1239
01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:17,490
<i>But there is one promise</i>

1240
01:25:17,790 --> 01:25:19,790
<i>That is given</i>

1241
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:22,390
<i>I'll meet you on</i>

1242
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:25,190
<i>God's golden shore</i>

1243
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:27,990
<i>He'll meet you on</i>

1244
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:30,790
<i>God's golden shore</i>

1245
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:34,690
That's fine. That's fine !

1246
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:39,790
Ladies and gentlemans,

1247
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:42,190
here and listening at home,

1248
01:25:42,490 --> 01:25:45,490
the great state of Mississippi...

1249
01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:47,490
Pappy O'Daniel, Governor...

1250
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:53,390
wants to thank the Soggy Bottom Boys
for that wonderful performance.

1251
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:59,390
And it looks like the only man
in this great state

1252
01:25:59,690 --> 01:26:01,490
who ain't a music lover

1253
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:05,190
is my esteemed opponent in the upcoming,
Homer Stokes.

1254
01:26:05,490 --> 01:26:07,890
There ain't no accounting for taste.

1255
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:12,390
Sounded to me like he was harbouring
a hateful grudge

1256
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:14,290
against the Soggy Bottom Boys

1257
01:26:14,490 --> 01:26:16,890
on account of their rough and rowdy past.

1258
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:21,790
Looks like Homer Stokes
is the kind of fellow

1259
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:24,290
who wants to cast the first stone.

1260
01:26:24,490 --> 01:26:27,090
Well, I'm with you, folks.

1261
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:30,390
I'm a forgive-and-forget
Christian, and I say...

1262
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:35,990
if their rambunctiousness
and misdemeanoring is behind them...

1263
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:37,190
It is, ain't it?

1264
01:26:37,390 --> 01:26:38,990
Yes sir, it is.

1265
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:41,090
Well then, I say,

1266
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:43,590
by the power vested in me,

1267
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:48,090
these boys is hereby pardoned!

1268
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:52,990
And furthermore...

1269
01:26:53,190 --> 01:26:55,790
in the second Pappy O'Daniel administration,

1270
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:59,290
these boys is gonna be my brain trust!

1271
01:27:03,490 --> 01:27:05,290
What's that mean, Everett ?

1272
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:09,390
Well, it means you and me
and Pete and Tommy are gonna be

1273
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:11,790
the power behind the throne, so to speak.

1274
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:19,190
So, without further ado,
and by way of endorsing my candidacy,

1275
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:20,990
the Soggy Bottom Boys

1276
01:27:21,190 --> 01:27:25,190
is gonna lead us all
in a chorus of "You Are My Sunshine".

1277
01:27:26,490 --> 01:27:29,090
Ain't you, boys?

1278
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:30,290
One of our favourites.

1279
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:35,090
Son... you're gonna go far.

1280
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:37,490
<i>You are my sunshine</i>

1281
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:39,990
<i>My only sunshine</i>

1282
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:42,690
<i>You make me happy</i>

1283
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:45,090
<i>When skies are grey</i>

1284
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:47,690
<i>You'll never know, dear</i>

1285
01:27:47,890 --> 01:27:50,490
<i>How much I love you</i>

1286
01:27:50,790 --> 01:27:52,190
<i>Please don't take</i>

1287
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:56,790
<i>My sunshine away</i>

1288
01:27:59,090 --> 01:28:02,590
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip
is gonna be going on relief.

1289
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:05,490
Maybe I can throw
a little patronage his way,

1290
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:08,590
get him a job digging
or rounding up stray dogs.

1291
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:11,190
So, is the marriage off,
Miss Wharvey?

1292
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:14,890
McGill. No... the marriage
will take place as planned.

1293
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:16,390
With a change of cast.

1294
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:19,190
Me and the little lady
are gonna pick up the pieces

1295
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:22,490
and re-tie the knot,
mixaphorically speaking.

1296
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:24,790
You boys are invited, of course.

1297
01:28:24,990 --> 01:28:26,690
Hell, you're the best men.

1298
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:29,090
I already got the rings.

1299
01:28:29,290 --> 01:28:32,790
- Where's your ring ?
- I ain't worn it since our divorce.

1300
01:28:32,990 --> 01:28:35,990
Must still be in
the roll-top in the old cabin.

1301
01:28:36,290 --> 01:28:38,490
Vernon's was encrusted with jewels.

1302
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:41,790
Now's the time to buy it off him cheap.

1303
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:45,590
We ain't getting married with
his ring. You said you'd changed.

1304
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:48,190
- Just an old pewter thing.
- Ain't no wedding.

1305
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:50,790
- It's just a symbol, honey.
- No wedding.

1306
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:52,390
We'll fetch it with you.

1307
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:55,390
It's just... shut up, Delmar.
It's just a symbol.

1308
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:58,990
I've spoken my piece and counted to three.

1309
01:28:59,190 --> 01:29:02,790
She counted to three. God damn it.

1310
01:29:03,090 --> 01:29:05,790
She counted to three. Son of a bitch!

1311
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:08,490
You have any idea how far that cabin is?

1312
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:25,890
George?

1313
01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:27,690
Hello, boys!

1314
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:31,990
These little men finally
caught the criminal of the century.

1315
01:29:32,190 --> 01:29:34,190
Looks like the chair
for George Nelson!

1316
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:40,690
Yup, gonna electrify me.
I'm gonna go off like a roman candle!

1317
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:44,290
20,000 volts chasing a rabbit
through yours truly!

1318
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:48,090
Gonna suck all
the power right out of the state!

1319
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:52,790
Gonna shoot sparks out of my head
and lightning from my fingertips!

1320
01:29:52,990 --> 01:29:57,190
I'm George Nelson,
and I'm feeling ten feet tall!

1321
01:29:57,390 --> 01:30:01,990
Looks like George
is right back on top again.

1322
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:03,390
Cow killer!

1323
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:19,590
Well, at least you boys get to see
the ancestral manse,

1324
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:24,290
the home where I spent so many a
happy day in the bosom of my family

1325
01:30:24,490 --> 01:30:27,590
refugin', if you will,
with a mighty oak tree out front

1326
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:32,190
and a happy little tyre swing on it.

1327
01:30:35,490 --> 01:30:40,290
Where's the happy little tyre swing?

1328
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:43,690
End of the road, boys.

1329
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:45,990
- No. Wait a minute.
- Let's go, boys.

1330
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:50,490
It's had its twists and turns,
now it deposits you here.

1331
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:51,790
Wait a minute.

1332
01:30:52,090 --> 01:30:57,290
You have eluded fate and you have
eluded me for the last time.

1333
01:30:57,490 --> 01:31:00,390
- Tie their hands, boys.
- You can't do this, now.

1334
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:03,390
Didn't know you'd be bringing a friend.

1335
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:07,490
He'll just have to wait his turn,
share one of your graves.

1336
01:31:07,690 --> 01:31:10,990
You can't do it, we just got
pardoned by the governor.

1337
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:15,090
It went out on the radio.
- Is that right ?

1338
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:21,790
Well, we ain't got a radio.

1339
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:26,590
God have mercy.

1340
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:32,190
<i>You</i>

1341
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:34,090
<i>Got to go</i>

1342
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:36,990
<i>To that lonesome valley</i>

1343
01:31:37,190 --> 01:31:40,890
<i>You</i>

1344
01:31:41,090 --> 01:31:46,990
<i>Whoa, got...</i>

1345
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:48,690
It ain't fittin'.

1346
01:31:48,890 --> 01:31:50,090
It ain't the law.

1347
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:53,490
<i>- The law?
- To go...</i>

1348
01:31:53,690 --> 01:31:56,690
The law is a human institution.

1349
01:31:56,990 --> 01:32:00,390
<i>Nobody else</i>

1350
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:03,290
<i>Can go there for you, no...</i>

1351
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:06,390
Perhaps you should start
making your prayers.

1352
01:32:11,390 --> 01:32:17,590
<i>Got</i>

1353
01:32:17,790 --> 01:32:19,390
<i>To go...</i>

1354
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:23,790
Oh, my God. Everett?

1355
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:27,390
Tommy, I'm sorry we got you into this.

1356
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:31,190
Good Lord... what do we do?

1357
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:37,290
<i>By yourself</i>

1358
01:32:40,890 --> 01:32:43,590
Oh, Lord...

1359
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:48,590
Please look down
and recognise us poor sinners.

1360
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:51,990
Please, Lord.

1361
01:32:52,290 --> 01:32:55,890
I just want to see my daughters again.

1362
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:59,990
I've been separated
from my family for so long.

1363
01:33:00,190 --> 01:33:03,390
I know I've been guilty of pride
and sharp dealing.

1364
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:05,790
I'm sorry I turned my back on you,

1365
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:08,790
forgive me.

1366
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:11,790
We're helpless, Lord.

1367
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:15,390
For the sake of my family,
for Tommy's sake...

1368
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:19,090
for Delmar's and Pete's.

1369
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:24,190
Let me see my daughters again, Lord.

1370
01:33:24,590 --> 01:33:29,390
Help us, please.

1371
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:46,590
<i>You got to go</i>

1372
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:49,590
<i>To the lonesome valley</i>

1373
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:58,790
<i>Yes, sir, you, whoa</i>

1374
01:33:58,990 --> 01:34:04,090
<i>Got</i>

1375
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:09,190
<i>To go</i>

1376
01:34:09,390 --> 01:34:12,590
<i>There</i>

1377
01:34:14,990 --> 01:34:18,590
<i>By</i>

1378
01:34:18,790 --> 01:34:21,190
<i>Yourself</i>

1379
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:24,190
<i>Nobody else</i>

1380
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:27,990
<i>Nobody else can go for you</i>

1381
01:34:28,190 --> 01:34:34,190
<i>You, whoa</i>

1382
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:42,490
<i>Got</i>

1383
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:46,690
<i>To go</i>

1384
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:50,490
<i>There</i>

1385
01:34:52,990 --> 01:34:57,590
<i>By</i>

1386
01:34:57,790 --> 01:35:00,590
<i>Yourself</i>

1387
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:40,390
- A miracle. It was a miracle!
- Delmar, don't be ignorant.

1388
01:35:40,590 --> 01:35:42,890
I told you they was flooding this valley.

1389
01:35:43,190 --> 01:35:46,390
- No! That ain't it!
- We prayed to God and he pitied us!

1390
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:47,990
Well, it never fails.

1391
01:35:48,190 --> 01:35:51,690
Again, you hayseeds
are showin' you want for intellect.

1392
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:54,490
There's a perfectly scientific explanation.

1393
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:57,890
That ain't the tune you was singin'
back at the gallows!

1394
01:35:58,190 --> 01:36:01,090
Any human being'll cast about
in a moment of stress.

1395
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:03,190
No, they're flooding this valley

1396
01:36:03,390 --> 01:36:06,590
so they can hydroelectric
up the whole darn state.

1397
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:09,590
Yes, sir, the south is gonna change.

1398
01:36:09,790 --> 01:36:12,490
Everything's gonna run on a paying basis.

1399
01:36:12,690 --> 01:36:16,890
Out with the spiritual mumbo-jumbo
and the backward ways.

1400
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:22,090
We're gonna see a brave new world
where they hook us all up to a grid.

1401
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:24,390
Yes, a veritable age of reason.

1402
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:29,690
Like the one they had in France.
Not a moment too soon.

1403
01:36:32,590 --> 01:36:36,590
Not a moment too soon.

1404
01:36:36,890 --> 01:36:38,290
Hey, there's Tommy.

1405
01:36:38,490 --> 01:36:41,090
Tommy, what you ridin' there?

1406
01:36:44,490 --> 01:36:46,190
Roll-top desk.

1407
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:52,690
<i>My latest sun is sinking fast</i>

1408
01:36:53,290 --> 01:36:55,090
<i>My race is nearly run...</i>

1409
01:36:55,390 --> 01:36:57,890
"All's well that ends well",
some poet said.

1410
01:36:58,190 --> 01:36:59,490
That's right, honey.

1411
01:36:59,790 --> 01:37:01,890
Don't mind telling you I'm awful pleased

1412
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:04,590
my adventuring days have come to an end.

1413
01:37:04,890 --> 01:37:07,590
Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.

1414
01:37:07,790 --> 01:37:09,190
That's good, honey.

1415
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:11,390
You were right about that ring, too.

1416
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:14,390
Any other wedding band wouldn't do.

1417
01:37:14,590 --> 01:37:16,290
This here was fore-ordained.

1418
01:37:16,490 --> 01:37:18,190
Fate was a-smilin' on me.

1419
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:20,090
That's not my ring.

1420
01:37:20,290 --> 01:37:23,890
- What ? Not your ring?
- That's one of Aunt Herlene's.

1421
01:37:24,190 --> 01:37:26,890
- You said it was in the roll-top.
- I said I thought it was.

1422
01:37:27,090 --> 01:37:29,490
- No, you said...
- Or under the mattress.

1423
01:37:29,790 --> 01:37:31,390
Or maybe in my chifforobe.

1424
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:34,190
Well, I'm sorry, honey.

1425
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:35,690
We need that ring.

1426
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:38,290
It's at the bottom of a durn big lake.

1427
01:37:38,590 --> 01:37:40,590
- Uh-uh.
- A 9,000 hectare lake.

1428
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:44,190
I don't care if it's 90,000.
That lake was not my doing.

1429
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:47,390
- I've counted to three.
- No, wait, honey.

1430
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:50,390
Finding one ring
in the middle of all that water

1431
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:56,890
<i>- is one hell of a heroic task!
- ...And gives me victory</i>

1432
01:37:57,190 --> 01:38:01,990
<i>O, come, angel band</i>

1433
01:38:02,190 --> 01:38:03,990
<i>Come and</i>

1434
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:06,690
<i>Around me stand</i>

1435
01:38:06,890 --> 01:38:11,490
<i>O, bear me away
on your snow white wings</i>

1436
01:38:11,790 --> 01:38:16,790
<i>To my immortal home</i>

1437
01:38:16,990 --> 01:38:21,890
<i>O, bear me away
on your snow white wings</i>

1438
01:38:22,190 --> 01:38:29,290
<i>To my immortal home</i>

1439
01:38:35,390 --> 01:38:40,990
<i>My latest sun is sinking fast</i>

1440
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:46,590
<i>My race is nearly run</i>

1441
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:52,590
<i>My strongest trials now are past</i>

1442
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:58,390
<i>My triumph has begun</i>

1443
01:38:58,790 --> 01:39:01,690
<i>O, come</i>

1444
01:39:01,990 --> 01:39:04,490
<i>Angel band</i>

1445
01:39:04,690 --> 01:39:09,690
<i>Come and around me stand</i>

1446
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:15,190
<i>O, bear me away
on your snow white wings</i>

1447
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:20,790
<i>To my immortal home</i>

1448
01:39:21,090 --> 01:39:26,290
<i>O, bear me away
on your snow white wings</i>

1449
01:39:26,490 --> 01:39:32,190
<i>To my immortal home</i>

1450
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:44,390
<i>O, bear my longin' heart to him</i>

1451
01:39:44,590 --> 01:39:49,990
<i>Who bled and died for me</i>

1452
01:39:50,290 --> 01:39:55,990
<i>Whose blood now cleanses from all sin</i>

1453
01:39:56,190 --> 01:40:01,990
<i>And gives me victory</i>

1454
01:40:02,190 --> 01:40:04,890
<i>O, come</i>

1455
01:40:05,090 --> 01:40:07,590
<i>Angel band</i>

1456
01:40:07,790 --> 01:40:12,690
<i>Come and around me stand</i>

1457
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:18,290
<i>O, bear me away
on your snow white wings</i>

1458
01:40:18,590 --> 01:40:23,890
<i>To my immortal home</i>

1459
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:29,490
<i>O, bear me away
on your snow white wings</i>

1460
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:38,990
<i>To my immortal home</i>

1461
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:59,390
<i>There's a dark
and a troubled side of life</i>

1462
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:03,590
<i>There's a bright and a sunny side, too</i>

1463
01:41:03,890 --> 01:41:08,090
<i>Though we meet with
darkness and strife</i>

1464
01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:12,590
<i>The sunny side be also with you</i>

1465
01:41:12,790 --> 01:41:14,690
<i>Keep on the sunny side</i>

1466
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:16,690
<i>Always on the sunny side</i>

1467
01:41:16,890 --> 01:41:20,490
<i>Keep on the sunny side of life</i>

1468
01:41:20,690 --> 01:41:22,590
<i>It will help us every day</i>

1469
01:41:22,790 --> 01:41:24,790
<i>It will brighten all the way</i>

1470
01:41:24,990 --> 01:41:30,390
<i>If we'll keep on
the sunny side of life</i>

1471
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:50,190
<i>The storm and its fury
broke today</i>

1472
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:54,190
<i>Crushing hopes
that we cherished so dear</i>

1473
01:41:54,390 --> 01:41:58,290
<i>Clouds and storms
again will pass away</i>

1474
01:41:58,590 --> 01:42:03,190
<i>And the sun will shine again,
bright and clear</i>

1475
01:42:03,390 --> 01:42:05,190
<i>Keep on the sunny side</i>

1476
01:42:05,390 --> 01:42:07,190
<i>Always on the sunny side</i>

1477
01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:11,090
<i>Keep on the sunny side of life</i>

1478
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:13,090
<i>It will help us every day</i>

1479
01:42:13,290 --> 01:42:15,190
<i>It will brighten all the way</i>

1480
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:19,890
<i>If we'll keep on
the sunny side of life</i>

1481
01:42:20,190 --> 01:42:22,090
<i>Keep on the sunny side</i>

1482
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:24,190
<i>Always on the sunny side</i>

1483
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:27,790
<i>Keep on the sunny side of life</i>

1484
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:29,990
<i>It will help us every day</i>

1485
01:42:30,190 --> 01:42:32,190
<i>It will brighten all the way</i>

1486
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:36,390
<i>If we'll keep on
the sunny side of life</i>

1487
01:42:36,690 --> 01:42:42,190
<i>If we'll keep on
the sunny side of life</i>
