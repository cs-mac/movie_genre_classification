1
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,440
MY UNCLE ANTOINE

2
00:01:53,313 --> 00:02:00,310
ASBESTOS-MINING COUNTRY
IN QUEBEC PROVINCE
NOT SO LONG AGO...

3
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,435
Damn this lousy clutch!

4
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,434
I've been after them
for two months to fix it.

5
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,231
I've about had it.

6
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:25,400
One of these days
I'm gonna shove it over the edge.

7
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,080
- Mario.
- What?

8
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,979
- Pass me a wrench.
- There isn't one.

9
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:36,986
An iron rod, anything.
It's filthy. I can't see a thing.

10
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:43,755
They never clean it.
"Maintenance" my ass!

11
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,573
Hey, Jos, it's the boss!

12
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,302
Tell him to go to hell.

13
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,235
They never clean it!

14
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,961
"Maintenance" my ass!

15
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,845
- That may be truer than you think.
- What did he say?

16
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,749
I don't know.
I don't speak English.

17
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,231
Your hat.

18
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,777
Hold your hat up.

19
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,061
- Close the door, Benoit.
- Yes, Uncle.

20
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:51,906
Euclid was a good Christian,
and the whole village knew it.

21
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,416
They've offered 15 high masses
and 25 low masses.

22
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,145
You can set
your heart at ease.

23
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,452
Listen to this.

24
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,416
Oscar Moisan
offered a low mass.

25
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,925
Those two were like
cats and dogs.

26
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,323
Here's a good one.

27
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:47,068
The widow Pelletier,
one high mass at three bucks.

28
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,336
We all know why.

29
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:56,375
Stop wasting time, Fernand.
The priest is waiting.

30
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,600
Come on!

31
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,738
Fernand, take this.

32
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,001
Stop singing.
You're getting on my nerves!

33
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,676
Sorry.

34
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,945
Fernand, fix your tie.

35
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,282
Come on, Fernand.
Hurry up.

36
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,004
SCREW YOU, DUPLESSIS

37
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,842
YVETTE GIVES HEAD

38
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,180
What did I miss?

39
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,618
You're not still going on
about Euclid!

40
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,653
He went so fast.

41
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,553
You call that fast? Christ!

42
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,464
He'd been rotting away
for 25 years.

43
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,058
Same thing's gonna happen
to you bunch of idiots.

44
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,365
- Not me, that's for sure.
- I'm not gonna end up that way.

45
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,779
There's another one
the English won't get.

46
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,777
To hell with them all!
The English, Euclid,

47
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,948
the undertaker, the priest,
the boss, the whole gang.

48
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,626
I'm getting the hell out.

49
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,891
Leave the mine again
and they won't take you back.

50
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,731
To hell with 'em all!

51
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,131
I won't spend my life
kissing their ass.

52
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm off.

53
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,767
Gugusse, what do I owe you?

54
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,612
Take it out of that.
See ya.

55
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,074
Who'll do the milking
and feeding every morning?

56
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,017
And the kids won't see you
for six months.

57
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,550
I can't take it anymore.
I've gotta go.

58
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,328
I'll be back in the spring.
- Yeah, like always.

59
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,032
It's always for you
to decide, huh?

60
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,505
Yeah.

61
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,659
- Hi, Pa!
- Hello, kids.

62
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,327
Listen...

63
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,705
I'm going up
to the logging camp.

64
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,874
Be good to your mother.

65
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,140
Try to give her a hand.

66
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,782
I've gotta go.

67
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,315
I'm fed up with the mine.
It's different up there.

68
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,449
Peace and quiet.
The woods, the snow.

69
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,092
No boss to get on your back.

70
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,030
Pa, a case of beans!

71
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,269
Take it home to your mother.

72
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:42,174
You'll be eating beans
for a week.

73
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,118
I'm going back with the others.

74
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,554
Listen...

75
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:02,322
I'll send you
to school next year, okay?

76
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:04,860
I don't know.

77
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,804
- See ya, son.
- See ya.

78
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,681
See ya, Pa!

79
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,650
See you, Serge.

80
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,165
Good morning, Father.

81
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,857
Good morning.

82
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,539
GENERAL STORE

83
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,989
- Fernand?
- Good morning, Madam Cécile.

84
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,498
You're so early.

85
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,161
There's a lot to do.

86
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,135
Decorations,
the window, the nativity scene.

87
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,299
That's true.

88
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,877
Would you pass me some tea?
I'm all out upstairs.

89
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,916
What kind do you want?

90
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,685
We've got all kinds.

91
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,350
We've got Lipton, Salada...

92
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,491
Make it quick, Fernand.
Salada.

93
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,607
What's that there?

94
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,513
A barrel of nails
they delivered last night.

95
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,475
Well, I'm going
to have my breakfast.

96
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,483
See you later.

97
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,386
Enjoy your breakfast.

98
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,827
Look who's here.

99
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:12,827
Hi, Fernand.

100
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,064
Benoit, take these nails
upstairs right away.

101
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,334
You might say
"good morning."

102
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,003
Good morning.

103
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,771
Now take the barrel up.

104
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,640
I can't. My arm's in a cast.

105
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,319
Excuses, excuses.

106
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,859
Well, if it isn't the new hired help
acting like a princess.

107
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,656
You're hired help too, clerk.

108
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,262
Didn't you buy any jam?

109
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,362
What's that?

110
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,973
You know I don't like that brand.

111
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,435
You didn't say
good morning to Benoit.

112
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,371
- Good morning, my foot.
- Same to you.

113
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,619
I'll take this,
but buy the other kind, okay?

114
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:11,055
Come right back down, Carmen,
and help Benoit.

115
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,992
If I feel like it.

116
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:16,431
We've got decorations, lights,

117
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,570
garlands, gifts, wrapping paper.

118
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,672
Unpack it all and call me
when you're through.

119
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,542
I'll take care of it.

120
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,519
- Some are broken.
- Fine.

121
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,928
Throw 'em out.

122
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,805
I've come to do my bills.

123
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,603
Don't you do that
in the office?

124
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,611
It's too noisy.

125
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,904
What is it?

126
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,980
That dress you're wearing.

127
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,145
It's pretty.

128
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,822
Really?

129
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,426
It's nothing.

130
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,801
Don't you need glasses?

131
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,776
Me?

132
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,918
Isn't anyone here this morning?

133
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,744
I'm here, Uncle.

134
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,883
No one's taken
these nails upstairs?

135
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,788
I can't with my cast.

136
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,124
Where's Fernand?

137
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,524
Haven't seen him.

138
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,529
- Your aunt?
- Haven't seen her either.

139
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,004
Fine way to start a day!

140
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,394
<i>In my father's garden</i>

141
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:15,300
<i>There's an orange tree</i>

142
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:19,239
<i>So full of oranges</i>

143
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:24,780
<i>We fear it may die</i>

144
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:30,280
<i>I'm in love, hey nonny no</i>
<i>My heart is gay</i>

145
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:33,582
<i>I hear singing and dancing</i>

146
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,391
For heaven's sake,
what's gotten into you this morning?

147
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:42,499
These accounts don't add up.

148
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,898
They're off by $30. 14.
- What do you mean?

149
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,301
There's got to be a bill missing.
Look for yourself.

150
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,735
Fernand, I really don't...

151
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,908
Good God, Antoine,
you scared me!

152
00:26:56,448 --> 00:27:01,147
What are you doing here? You haven't
shaved or even gotten dressed!

153
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,151
Don't just sit there!
We've got a big day ahead!

154
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,153
Come on, get going.

155
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:11,295
You've gotta call the tinsmith,
bring up vegetables from the cellar...

156
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,791
$30. 14. It just can't be.

157
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,936
There's got to be
a bill missing for sure.

158
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,800
- I'll make you say uncle.
- I give up, okay?

159
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,873
These nails
have to go upstairs.

160
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,480
- Did you find Aunt Cécile?
- Yeah, 30 years ago.

161
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:36,143
What's going on here?
Haven't you done anything?

162
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,584
My God, with all there is to do!

163
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,758
I always have to do
everything myself.

164
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,519
For heaven's sake, Antoine,
get moving and help me.

165
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:47,425
There's the presents,
the nativity scene, the tree, the bells.

166
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,930
Come on now.
We're in a rush.

167
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,569
You weren't in a rush
a minute ago.

168
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:58,799
Some boxes are missing.
I can't find the figures for the nativity.

169
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,137
Careful with the Virgin Mary.
She's touchy.

170
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,177
Where's Baby Jesus?

171
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,645
Here comes the Holy Spirit.
He'll know.

172
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,784
Let's not waste time.

173
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,113
I'll be in the office.
I've got things to do.

174
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,312
So now you're in a rush too?

175
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,680
Hold it.

176
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,048
There. We got it.

177
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,950
It's nice, huh?

178
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,858
We can make snow balls
to decorate it.

179
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,368
Come along.

180
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,439
Wait for me!

181
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,283
Marcel is sick!

182
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,846
Benoit, put these sweaters
on the shelf.

183
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,515
These are girls' sweaters.
I don't do that.

184
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:29,056
- These too.
- What have you got on your face?

185
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,026
Makes you look cheap.

186
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,965
You looked bad enough before.

187
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,512
Watch it!

188
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:08,292
<i>Hey nonny nonny no</i>

189
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,121
- How many flowers are left?
- Seven.

190
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,184
Stupid idiot.

191
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,161
Careful, Benoit.

192
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,330
You'll break your other arm...

193
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,329
or something else.

194
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,827
Benoit, come here.

195
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,796
Let's see if the curtain works.

196
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:55,370
- What do I do?
- Wait a minute.

197
00:32:55,573 --> 00:33:00,237
Pull the cord, but not too fast.
Wait till I tell you.

198
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,004
Not yet!
Wait till I tell you!

199
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,574
Little jerk.

200
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:08,985
Now!

201
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,191
Okay. Close it.

202
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,530
Perfect. It's just right.

203
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,266
Now for the decorations.
Take the ladder away.

204
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:35,542
No, don't put snow on yet,
sweetheart.

205
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,375
Wait till Baby Jesus is in place.

206
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,717
First I place St. Joseph.

207
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:49,825
Madam Cécile,
I'm going to move the bulbs around.

208
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,486
Good idea, Carmen.
You have good taste.

209
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,490
Now for the Virgin Mary,

210
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:00,899
and Baby Jesus in the center.

211
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:04,032
The nativity scene
is so beautiful this year.

212
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,904
- Jesus doesn't look too good.
- No, he doesn't.

213
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:10,205
He had an accident.
We dropped him.

214
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,413
But he's so small,
it won't show.

215
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,212
- I'll put some snow over here.
- Now you can.

216
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,516
It's lovely.

217
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,123
That's enough snow now.

218
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:26,091
All right, let's go.

219
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,346
- What are you looking for?
- Tape.

220
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,851
Right where it always is.

221
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:03,195
- Need a hand?
- No, thanks.

222
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,292
That'll do.

223
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,651
What about me?

224
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,219
Sorry.

225
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,115
- Not bad.
- I told you. It feels good.

226
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,622
You're right.
It warms you up.

227
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,693
You're wearing your brooch.

228
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:11,801
I thought it went well
with the dress.

229
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:17,635
I shortened it a bit,
'cause my legs still look pretty good.

230
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,600
You're right.
It looks very nice.

231
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,283
You know what?
My wife isn't bad-Iooking.

232
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,679
Come on, stop it.

233
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,551
Sweet old man.

234
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,093
Old... that's for sure.

235
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,525
I said sweet.

236
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,766
- Have more.
- It's stronger than I thought.

237
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,802
- It's good for you.
- I'm not used to it.

238
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:50,837
It'll loosen you up.

239
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,667
Do I need it?

240
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,406
Damn nails.

241
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:08,721
<i>Hey nonny nonny no</i>

242
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,537
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

243
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:29,470
Come back day after tomorrow, boys.
Merry Christmas.

244
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:38,313
Don't drink too much water.
It's not good for you.

245
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,959
Can't wait to get a look, huh?

246
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,891
Want to see it right now, huh?

247
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,658
Well, you'll have to wait.
It's a surprise.

248
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,835
Dying of curiosity, aren't you?

249
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,332
Come in and buy.

250
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,665
I've got good deals
for the ladies.

251
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,536
What have you got for kids?

252
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:42,611
I've got toys for the kids.

253
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,678
- What kind?
- What kind do you want?

254
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,907
An electric train.

255
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:51,214
Ask your dad to buy it for you.
I'll give him a good price.

256
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,149
I'm feeling generous this year.

257
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,849
Arthur, I'll even give you credit.

258
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:59,292
That's enough now.

259
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,223
Ready? Good.

260
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:09,301
Straighten your dress.

261
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:11,170
Good.

262
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,268
Watch closely now.

263
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:18,209
It's gonna open.

264
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,800
<i>Hey, Jos! Are you crazy?</i>

265
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,161
<i>If you leave now,</i>
<i>they won't take you back.</i>

266
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,734
I don't care.

267
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:17,101
<i>Damn it, man!</i>
<i>You never change.</i>

268
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:20,774
<i>Fine. Go ahead.</i>
<i>Run off again.</i>

269
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:25,039
<i>Things will catch up to you one day,</i>
<i>and then you'll come crying!</i>

270
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,644
What can I do?
It's just how I am.

271
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:03,310
You know the one about the Scotsman
whose kilt was too short?

272
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:10,554
Antoine, come here, please.

273
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,626
I'll tell you later.

274
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,655
Don't be too long.

275
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,894
They're nice pants,
and just your size.

276
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:22,004
- I don't like 'em.
- Why not?

277
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,039
- Too big.
- No, they're not.

278
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,837
You're sucking your stomach in.

279
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,638
Turn around.

280
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:34,215
We'll take 'em in a bit.
They'll be perfect.

281
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:38,083
- I heard your wife's pregnant.
- No.

282
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,621
- Even she says so.
- Just rumors.

283
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:43,850
She should know.
Ask her tonight.

284
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:49,227
With a belt
they'll be just fine.

285
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:52,300
You've lost weight.
Married life wearing you out?

286
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,528
Yeah, it takes it out of ya.

287
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,003
- You want 'em or not?
- I'll take 'em.

288
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,972
- They're $8.50. Cash?
- Cash.

289
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:02,611
Cash?

290
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:06,112
Strike up the band!
Let's drink to the occasion!

291
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:10,780
We don't need
an occasion to drink.

292
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,058
I'm surprised
at how quiet Thomas is.

293
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:20,863
I heard he fought in both wars
and married three times.

294
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:23,932
I fought in one war
and spent half of it in the stockade.

295
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,500
The stockade?
What did you do?

296
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:29,036
I was in military prison.

297
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,503
Go change over there.

298
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:38,776
A little drink will do us good.
To your health.

299
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,452
Where did he go?

300
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:49,693
Carmen.

301
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:53,355
Someone's here to see you.
- My father?

302
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,031
Yes.

303
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,378
Why don't you two
just adopt her?

304
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:44,514
You've come to collect
your daughter's pay?

305
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,756
Thirty-five.

306
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,953
Wasn't it 40?

307
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:03,326
I'm keeping the other five
for Carmen.

308
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,263
That wasn't our agreement.

309
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:08,233
I know, but that's the way it is.

310
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,828
Maurice, I've told you
a hundred times.

311
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:41,160
Will you excuse me?

312
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:25,513
Would you have a bridal veil?

313
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:30,847
Miss Briére,
this is wonderful news!

314
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,646
Congratulations!

315
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:34,915
We've been expecting this
for some time!

316
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,525
Lise, congratulations!

317
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,396
Go up to the stockroom.

318
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:45,967
On the third shelf on the left,
there's a gray box with blue printing.

319
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,901
It's a bridal veil.
Miss Briére is going to need it!

320
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,341
And here's the young devil!

321
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:03,716
Let's drink to that!

322
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:07,585
It's about time!

323
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,735
Ladies, you can buy
your own bottle.

324
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,142
Cécile, sing something.

325
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,976
No, I couldn't possibly.

326
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,350
Come on, I'll help you.

327
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:44,284
I guess I could sing something
in honor of the lovely couple.

328
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:51,364
You all have to join in
on the refrain.

329
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:54,002
Don't leave me all alone.

330
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,269
<i>My father married me off</i>
<i>to a textile merchant</i>

331
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,614
<i>On my wedding night</i>

332
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,614
<i>I got a nasty surprise</i>

333
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:18,989
<i>On my wedding night</i>
<i>I got a nasty surprise</i>

334
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:26,991
<i>I was barely in bed</i>
<i>when the skylark began her song</i>

335
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,847
<i>She sang in her language</i>
<i>"Wake up, it's daylight"</i>

336
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:05,668
I see you.

337
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,959
Don't touch me, you jerk.

338
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,759
I'll touch you, all right.

339
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:33,552
Fernand, how come
you have that?

340
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:39,455
What's the matter?
You feel all right?

341
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:41,460
Just great.

342
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,136
Fernand...

343
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,513
it's ten to 4:00.

344
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,446
Your clock is ten minutes fast.

345
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,752
They're gonna blast it.

346
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,400
Go on.

347
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:40,115
Really?
I've never seen her before.

348
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,792
You're never seen her before?

349
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,087
Well, I know her.

350
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,734
Oh, man!

351
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:58,007
The notary shouldn't let his wife out
on her own like that.

352
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,073
He's out of town.

353
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,341
Poor Alexandrine, all alone.

354
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:06,448
Come to me.
I'll show you a good time.

355
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:32,867
- Did it arrive?
- Yes, I put it upstairs.

356
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:35,044
Would you like to try it on?

357
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:40,813
I'd give a hundred bucks
to try <i>her</i> on.

358
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:46,614
It'd be funny to talk to her,
see what she thinks of us.

359
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:49,314
She'd tell me,
"You're a real man."

360
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:07,843
Benoit...

361
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:11,747
did you see who just went upstairs?
Alexandrine!

362
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:14,416
She's gonna try on
her new corset.

363
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,381
Let's go watch.

364
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:21,285
You coming?

365
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,696
Right over there.

366
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:45,981
<i>Lots of people downstairs.</i>

367
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:49,618
<i>There always are</i>
<i>before Christmas. I'm glad.</i>

368
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:53,050
<i>And the weather's so nice.</i>

369
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:57,357
<i>Anyway, your corset came in</i>
<i>yesterday.</i>

370
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,529
<i>It's really beautiful.</i>
<i>You'll see.</i>

371
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:03,759
It's hot in here.

372
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,901
Give me your coat.

373
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:15,136
There's a man there!

374
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:18,678
Excuse me.
We'll make it a bit more private.

375
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,210
Let me help you.

376
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:26,651
I hope it's the same one
I saw in the catalog.

377
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,448
The exact same one.

378
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,554
There's a black lace rose
with pink lining on the front,

379
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:37,028
and little swirls
on the hips. Very pretty.

380
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:38,962
I hope it fits.

381
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:44,033
You haven't gained an ounce since
last year. Still doing those exercises?

382
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,374
Help me with this.

383
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,818
Look at this.
Isn't it beautiful?

384
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:04,154
Just what you wanted.
Look here.

385
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,802
- Look at the waist.
- Don't move.

386
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,664
There, that's it.

387
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,601
Careful.
You're pinching me.

388
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,309
What was that noise?

389
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,849
There's someone at the door!

390
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:32,311
Pigs!

391
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:53,868
The boss from the mine
is throwing his trinkets around.

392
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:58,571
No raises this year,
just like last.

393
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:02,474
Let's throw snowballs
and scare the hell out of him.

394
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:06,046
- My arm's in a cast.
- Use your left one, idiot!

395
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:23,316
So long. Merry Christmas.

396
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:17,706
Get out of here!

397
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:22,736
Go on now, and behave yourselves.
Marcel's very sick.

398
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:39,256
My God!

399
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:03,415
<i>Mr. Antoine?</i>

400
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:07,111
No, this is Fernand.
Who's this?

401
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:09,621
<i>This is Mrs. Poulin in St. Pierre.</i>

402
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:11,157
Mrs. Jos Poulin?

403
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,327
<i>Yes.</i>

404
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,553
What can we do for you, ma'am?

405
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:23,832
Speak a bit louder, ma'am.
I can't hear you.

406
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:27,100
We've got a bad line.
You're breaking up.

407
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:31,371
<i>My eldest son was sick,</i>
<i>and he died this morning.</i>

408
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:36,041
<i>My husband's up in the woods.</i>
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

409
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:42,657
<i>Perhaps Mr. Antoine could come out.</i>
- I'm sorry to hear that.

410
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:45,987
<i>Can you hear me? Hello?</i>

411
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:48,993
I'm very sorry to hear that,
Mrs. Poulin.

412
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:53,391
<i>My husband is up at the logging camp.</i>
<i>If someone could...</i>

413
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:56,400
<i>Could Mr. Antoine come out?</i>

414
01:02:56,606 --> 01:03:00,804
Don't worry. We'll take care
of everything. We'll leave right away.

415
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:05,003
<i>Thank you. I'll be waiting.</i>
<i>Good-bye now.</i>

416
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,457
There's been a death in St. Pierre.

417
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,227
Who died?

418
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,471
The Poulins' eldest son
out in St. Pierre.

419
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:31,572
How old was he?

420
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:34,636
Couldn't have been more than 15.

421
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:37,913
I'll take the small box.
Should be large enough.

422
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,982
It's a long way.
It'll take a while.

423
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:46,114
I'll hitch up the horse right away.

424
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:02,599
Can I go with him?

425
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:04,297
Please.

426
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,773
- Where are you going?
- I'm going with you.

427
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:15,075
Aunt Cécile said I could.

428
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:22,921
Okay, but don't get all excited.

429
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,836
Bring me the box.

430
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:53,813
No, not that one.

431
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:00,258
The small one.

432
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:25,611
All right.

433
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:29,052
Red Fly's saddled up.
Everything's ready.

434
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,988
You can leave anytime.
- Your hat.

435
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:37,321
All set?

436
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:50,869
In case you get cold.

437
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:54,149
Thanks. Good idea.

438
01:05:55,384 --> 01:06:00,253
And give this candy
to the Poulin kids for me.

439
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:01,889
You're very sweet.

440
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:04,355
Have a good trip,
and be careful.

441
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,588
Bundle up.

442
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:12,056
Are you coming, Benoit?
Your uncle's ready.

443
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:15,303
Have you got everything?

444
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:27,809
Have a good trip.
Try to be back for midnight mass.

445
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:03,909
Go on, take the reins.

446
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:33,982
Want some?

447
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:39,544
Suit yourself.
You're gonna freeze.

448
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,541
Come on, Red Fly.

449
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:10,249
Come on, boy.

450
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,705
Drop the reins.

451
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,679
Red Fly knows the way
better than you.

452
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:43,643
Sit down.

453
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:46,286
Cover up.

454
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:49,956
I've known men
a lot tougher than you.

455
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:21,048
What's wrong? You afraid?

456
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:25,916
No. I'm cold.

457
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:31,191
Pick up your end.

458
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:35,952
I tried to reach your husband,
but the line was bad.

459
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:39,861
I'll try again tomorrow.

460
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:20,258
I fixed you a roast.

461
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:22,463
For you too.

462
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,305
Come sit down.

463
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:37,983
He was your eldest?

464
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:42,284
He seemed pretty healthy.

465
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:45,853
He was coughing,
but I thought it was just a cold.

466
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:49,656
Such a nice kid.

467
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:52,426
And so young.

468
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:09,843
We'll take care of that later.

469
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:11,849
Eat now.

470
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:22,786
I forgot. My wife gave me
candy for the children.

471
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,564
Give that to your brothers.
- Serge, Robin.

472
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:41,080
Can we really eat it?
Thank you, sir.

473
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:52,851
I'll make you a cup of tea.

474
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,822
- Are you ready, Benoit?
- I'm ready.

475
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:43,164
Excuse me.

476
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:15,687
Elise, do you have
the birth certificate?

477
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,891
I need it.

478
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:22,934
I'll look upstairs.

479
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:30,100
Benoit, drag the box
to the bedroom door.

480
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:03,762
Come on, help me.

481
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:28,661
Go on.

482
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:35,014
Come on, boy!

483
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:45,856
Come on, boy!

484
01:24:13,281 --> 01:24:15,442
Uncle!

485
01:24:17,952 --> 01:24:19,544
Uncle, wake up!

486
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:36,069
We lost the body.
We've got to get it.

487
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:41,341
We lost the body!
We've got to get it!

488
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:46,974
The body?

489
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:52,651
What body?
- That one, of course!

490
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:00,618
What's it doing there?

491
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:04,027
Get down and help me!

492
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:07,992
Just wait a minute.

493
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:14,269
How did this happen?
I've never seen anything like it.

494
01:25:16,578 --> 01:25:17,704
You coming?

495
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:22,440
It takes a little punk like you
to get me in a mess like this.

496
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:27,017
Just can't mind
your own business, can you?

497
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:30,282
You look for trouble
and drag everyone else along.

498
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:32,687
Why did you come anyway?

499
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:56,241
I can manage on my own.

500
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:05,126
If only Fernand were here.

501
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:12,560
Come on, Red Fly.

502
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,535
Come on.

503
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,014
Damn, it's slippery!

504
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:39,860
Let's go.

505
01:26:40,161 --> 01:26:41,788
Give me a hand.

506
01:26:42,463 --> 01:26:44,693
Ah, never mind.

507
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:12,554
Ready?

508
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:25,202
Don't let go!

509
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:30,508
I can't, Benoit.

510
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:34,671
Sometimes you just can't.

511
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:37,908
Yes, you can!
My arm's in a cast, and I can do it.

512
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:57,633
We're almost there.
Don't give up. You can do it.

513
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,802
What am I doing here, Benoit?

514
01:28:01,142 --> 01:28:02,837
I'm not happy.

515
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:07,276
I'm not made for the country.
I hate it here.

516
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:11,683
I wanted to buy
a hotel in the States.

517
01:28:11,886 --> 01:28:15,219
Your aunt wouldn't let me.
She says no to everything.

518
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:18,320
I'm afraid of corpses.

519
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:20,892
I've been afraid
of corpses for 30 years!

520
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:25,027
I work for everybody.

521
01:28:25,566 --> 01:28:29,127
Your aunt never gave me a child.

522
01:28:30,571 --> 01:28:33,768
I have to take care
of other people's children.

523
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:37,706
I raise Carmen and you.
Haven't I done all I could for you?

524
01:28:41,215 --> 01:28:42,910
Drunkard.

525
01:28:52,727 --> 01:28:54,490
Drunkard!

526
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:48,443
Shit.

527
01:30:32,193 --> 01:30:34,457
Come on, Red Fly.

528
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:51,077
<i>Good evening,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

529
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:54,442
<i>Live from the ballroom</i>

530
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:56,640

531
01:30:56,851 --> 01:31:00,685

01:31:00,888 --> 01:31:04,221

534
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:13,324
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the Harry Trueblood Orchestra.</i>

535
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:33,010
I can't believe it.

536
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:44,355
I never would have thought.

537
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:22,764
Don't drink this too often, do you?
It's from France.

538
01:32:24,605 --> 01:32:26,470
It's good all the same.

539
01:32:29,443 --> 01:32:31,877
Fernand, my Turkish carpet!

540
01:32:33,414 --> 01:32:36,713
I'm your Turkish carpet, madam.

541
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:57,098
Had you been planning this
for a long time?

542
01:33:00,107 --> 01:33:01,734
I don't know.

543
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:07,075
I think it really just occurred to me
this morning.

544
01:33:14,088 --> 01:33:16,648
What about you?
Had you thought about it?

545
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,635
Listen!

546
01:33:30,037 --> 01:33:31,902
I heard something.

547
01:33:32,707 --> 01:33:33,969
I didn't.

548
01:33:34,175 --> 01:33:35,870
I thought I did.

549
01:33:36,143 --> 01:33:37,974
Maybe it was Carmen.

550
01:33:38,512 --> 01:33:40,241
What if they're back?

551
01:33:41,115 --> 01:33:44,573
No, we'd have heard
the door to the shed.

552
01:33:44,785 --> 01:33:47,413
They could have
come in the front.

553
01:33:48,189 --> 01:33:49,349
My God!

554
01:34:01,936 --> 01:34:03,733
You took so long.

555
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:09,402
Carmen waited up all night.
I think she went to sleep.

556
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:11,304
Don't wake her up.

557
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:14,877
I couldn't get to sleep,
so I waited up here.

558
01:34:20,788 --> 01:34:22,415
Where's your uncle?

559
01:34:25,693 --> 01:34:27,991
Outside.
Go take care of him.

560
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:32,465
Outside?

561
01:35:28,756 --> 01:35:30,690
You were gone so long.

562
01:35:30,891 --> 01:35:32,859
It must have been rough.

563
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:38,027
The roads to St. Pierre are bad,
and with the storm...

564
01:35:39,467 --> 01:35:41,094
Are you hungry?

565
01:35:42,103 --> 01:35:44,298
No, I'm tired.

566
01:35:45,072 --> 01:35:48,940
Poor Fernand came upstairs
and fell fast asleep.

567
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:52,743
Carmen sat by the door,
waiting for you.

568
01:35:52,947 --> 01:35:55,438
She waited for you all night.

569
01:35:56,784 --> 01:35:59,116
She was so anxious to see you.

570
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:02,783
Take off your coat.

571
01:36:07,394 --> 01:36:09,123
Stay away from me.

572
01:36:10,965 --> 01:36:13,763
Take off your clothes
and go to bed.

573
01:36:14,702 --> 01:36:16,670
I'll bring you a hot water bottle.

574
01:36:20,141 --> 01:36:21,938
Well, anyway...

575
01:36:23,344 --> 01:36:25,335
isn't Fernand around?

576
01:36:25,546 --> 01:36:28,777
He must have gone downstairs
to help your uncle.

577
01:36:28,983 --> 01:36:31,213
I'll go find them.

578
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:34,683
I'll be right back.
You wait here.

579
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:40,927
Mr. Antoine,
what's the matter?

580
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:43,290
Where's the body?

581
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:46,632
Damn it all.

582
01:36:48,402 --> 01:36:50,336
Wake up, damn it!

583
01:36:50,538 --> 01:36:53,666
Did you make it to the Poulin place?
What happened?

584
01:36:53,874 --> 01:36:57,071
Goddamn it!
What a mess!

585
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:00,940
Fernand, what is it?

586
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:06,314
He's drunker than usual,
and there's no body. I don't get it!

587
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:10,047
Good heavens!
Do something! Bring him inside!

588
01:37:10,257 --> 01:37:12,748
I'm trying!
What do you want me to do?

589
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,149
Come on!

590
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:18,421
Mr. Antoine, help me.
Let's go inside.

591
01:37:57,938 --> 01:37:59,735
<i>Cécile, come help me.</i>

592
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:01,601
<i>Fernand, please!</i>

593
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:05,210
<i>Damn it!</i>
<i>He's like a ton of bricks!</i>

594
01:38:05,412 --> 01:38:06,572
<i>Poor old thing.</i>

595
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:09,510
<i>"Old thing"is right.</i>
<i>He can't do this work anymore.</i>

596
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:13,050
<i>Don't talk like that!</i>
<i>You're not ready to fill his boots yet.</i>

597
01:38:13,454 --> 01:38:16,821
<i>His boots...</i>
<i>Watch the step there.</i>

598
01:38:17,024 --> 01:38:19,356
Poor thing, he's frozen!

599
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:23,396
Be careful, Fernand.
- I am. Sit down.

600
01:38:23,597 --> 01:38:25,155
I'd like to know where the body is.

601
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:28,065
<i>What could have happened?</i>

602
01:38:28,769 --> 01:38:31,329
<i>- Let's call the Poulin place.</i>
<i>- Are you crazy?</i>

603
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:33,563
<i>Suppose they lost the body?</i>

604
01:38:33,774 --> 01:38:35,366
<i>Holy Mother of God!</i>

605
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:38,101
<i>If anyone finds it,</i>
<i>the whole town will know.</i>

606
01:38:38,312 --> 01:38:39,904
<i>We've got to look for it.</i>

607
01:38:40,114 --> 01:38:42,173
<i>- Who?</i>
<i>- You!</i>

608
01:38:42,516 --> 01:38:44,984
<i>Me? I don't even know</i>
<i>what route they took.</i>

609
01:38:45,185 --> 01:38:46,743
<i>Take Benoit with you.</i>

610
01:38:47,121 --> 01:38:48,520
<i>He's asleep.</i>

611
01:38:48,722 --> 01:38:49,950
<i>Wake him up.</i>

612
01:38:50,157 --> 01:38:51,351
<i>It won't be easy.</i>

613
01:38:51,558 --> 01:38:53,549
<i>Too bad. You have to.</i>

614
01:40:02,730 --> 01:40:04,425
<i>We have to wake him up.</i>

615
01:40:37,431 --> 01:40:39,626
Try to remember.

616
01:40:40,501 --> 01:40:42,469
Did you come this way?

617
01:40:45,639 --> 01:40:47,436
I can't see a thing.

618
01:40:50,644 --> 01:40:52,134
Giddyap!

619
01:40:53,147 --> 01:40:56,605
Did you take
the south road or a shortcut?

620
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:03,482
Damn it, Benoit, try!

621
01:41:04,191 --> 01:41:05,749
I don't know.

622
01:41:08,595 --> 01:41:10,256
Goddamn it!

623
01:41:20,107 --> 01:41:22,667
We're here, Benoit.

624
01:41:22,876 --> 01:41:24,434
Get a move on.

625
01:42:01,482 --> 01:42:03,916
Mrs. Poulin!
