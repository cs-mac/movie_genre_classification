that you have given to him.

It's nothing special.

39
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,443
that the transition's
going smoothly.

40
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,478
Okay.

41
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,480
Northside's a good school.

42
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:06,652
I've been a teacher there
going on 25 years.

Vanessa was a nurse there

Long enough.

45
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,693
Well, speaking
of smooth transitions,

46
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,596
your curfew will be 9:00
on school nights.

You've had a curfew before?

I've had a lot of practice being
on time in the last few years.

49
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:25,237
Yes, yes, I suppose you have.

50
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,774
But it will be different without
someone looking over you.

51
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:31,543
I'm sure it'll all
work out fine.

52
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,212
Of course, it'll be fine.

53
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:36,248
I just want to be clear
on our expectations.

54
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,319
There'll be plenty of time
for these things later.

He'll pick up the hours there.

It's important that you
don't fall short

00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,359
in that area either, Brendan.

with Mr. Stubbs, huh?

Yeah, he's a pretty cool guy.

He mentors our Bible study
after school.

Yeah, that's what he was
telling me.

77
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:16,448
Well, look, Northside is
just like any other school.

When you are working with
absolute value inequalities,

there's a lot you have
to keep straight.

82
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,796
You have to combine everything
you know about inequalities

with everything you know
about absolute values.

Well, sweetheart,
I really don't think

94
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,692
that was your decision to make.

95

Since when do you care
about cars?

96

You know what I mean.

00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,430
Okay, I'm sorry.
You're right.

98
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,766
Guess I should have said
something to you.

99
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,534
I can tell him.

100
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,437
Well, you can't tell him now
that you let him start.

101
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,805
I thought we agreed we were
gonna try to help

00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,974
the kid turn his life around.

So in the garden, we see him
pitting man against God

108
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:10,929
and in Job, we see him trying
to turn God against man

109
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:15,033
and in Matthew,
we see him scheming

110
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,769
to turn Jesus from God.

111
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,071
Now, Jesus has just begun
his ministry.

112
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,674
He's only been baptized
a few days prior.

113
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,811
He hasn't even performed
a single miracle

114
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:30,015
and yet the enemy is already
trying to bring him down.

finding it so far?

117
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,023
-Uh, it's...
-He doesn't say much.

118
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:41,560
He's got that quiet thing
going for him.

119
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,228
Yeah, he keeps to himself.

120
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,963
So does that mean you're
not gonna join

121
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,064
our volleyball team then?

122

Volleyball team?

123
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,535
Yeah, the Seekers has
an intramural team

124
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,671
and we play after school
at the park.

125
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,873
You should come out,
Friday night.

126

It's more like jungle ball
than volleyball.

And then afterwards you can
check out my band.

alternative rock

weekly.

to find our identity, you know?

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,123

00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,702

Yeah, set up a payment schedule.

136

Where's he getting his money?

137
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,610
Mike arranged that
he would cut grass

138
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,712
at the school in the fields.

139
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,113
I told Mike this was a bad idea.

140
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,748
I mean, he barely
knows this kid.

141
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,685
How do you make a person
trustworthy? Trust them.

Mike trusted those roofers
a couple of years back.

They did half the job
for the full price

and then they disappeared
on him.

I could use
a high definition TV.

You know, if you're thinking
of passing on

153
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,313
there's this new rec center
the department is sponsoring

154
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,181
and they're looking
for donations.

155
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:13,051
I remember Lewis had
that foosball table

156
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,987

when he was a kid.

I'm Detective Russell Dwyer.

I work for the county.

ever since I heard that Stubbs
took you in.

173
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:03,328
You've been in the system
long enough to know

174
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,031
that your record isn't
gonna fold up neatly

and disappear on you.

176
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,202
I mean, conditional discharge
where they seal your records,

177
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,271
that's for misdemeanors.

Drunk and disorderly,

with a baseball bat.

But that's not you.

00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,948
Now, I know what
you're thinking,

182
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,252
another cop hassling me
for no good reason,

183
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,154
but I have a reason.

184
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:32,924
I am a stat man, Brendan.

185
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,994
You into fantasy football
or baseball?

186
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,195
Oh, you should try it.

187

It's a good distraction.

188
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:43,435
Now, I love it because
it's all stats

189
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:46,871
and the guys that are
really great at it,

190
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,275
well, they learn how to dig
through all the useless data

191
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:53,945
and find what's
really important.

192
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:57,282
I checked the recidivism
statistics on that boys club

193
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,484
you spent the last
three years in.

194
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,786
Do you know what
recidivism means?

195
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:06,725
It's a 50 cent word that means
messing up again.

196
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,893
Do you know the recidivism rate
of those rats

197
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,262
that came out of that hole
you were in?

198
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:15,366
90% arrested within
two years of release.

199
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:20,839
Nine out of ten and that's
why I'm here, Brendan.

200
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:24,175
Nothing personal,
just the stats.

00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:27,746
Now the Stubbs,
they're good folks.

Never took a shortcut
in their lives.

203
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,819
And they had a son.

204
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,488
He was a cop.

205
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,025
He was killed in the line of
duty, routine traffic stop.

206
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:45,363
Guy shot him dead on the side
of the highway.

about three years ago.

She comes in, she goes

She got that tattoo without

She would never do that.

It's good and everything,
but we're a faith club

we're making

we should be.

00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:48,859
everything you do,
every decision you make,

486
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:52,329
you need to do a cost benefit
analysis.

487
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,832
You get to that in
economics class yet?

488
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,868
Uh, no.

489
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,071
How will something benefit you,
what will it cost you,

490
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,740
what do you have to risk.

491
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,008
But see, what people forget
sometimes is

492
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,845
there's a cost for not
doing something, too.

493
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:09,413
We don't only pay for
what we do in life,

494
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:13,183
we also pay for
what we don't do.

495
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:16,954
Yeah, it's a scary deal, I know.

496
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:21,959
You wanted to leave that part
of your life behind.

497
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,027
Pray on it.

498
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:27,197
Right decision will show
itself to you.

499
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,398
I know it did for me
just a little while back

500
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,134
when I was trying to decide
whether or not

501
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:33,504
to bring this young guy
into my house.

502

I'll get working on the charity.

How's the online bidding
for nominees coming?

512
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:22,853
Well, last week
the website crashed,

it's running smoothly.

1129
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:39,647
It's okay, son.

1130
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:42,584
I know what you set out to do,
you know, I do,

1131
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:43,852
but it's too much.

1132
01:08:43,854 --> 01:08:46,621
I mean, first the car,
the house, now this?

1133
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,189
-V...
-Listen!

1134
01:08:48,191 --> 01:08:50,191
The boy needs to be
under the care of a doctor!

1135
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:52,360
He needs to be in a hospital!

1136
01:08:52,362 --> 01:08:55,363
Hospitals ask questions.
You know that.

1137
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:57,265
He's aged out of the system.

1138
01:08:57,267 --> 01:09:00,135
This is his last stop.
Then what?

1139
01:09:00,137 --> 01:09:01,736
He goes back out to the streets?

1140
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:03,838
If that happens, Mike,
it's not our fault.

1141
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,374
It's not on us.

1142
01:09:06,376 --> 01:09:09,878
Maybe not,
but it feels like it is.

1143
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:16,317
I have always been
surrounded by men

1144
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:19,687
who could never turn their backs
on people in need

1145
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:21,389
and I guess I should feel like
that's a blessing,

1146
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:23,691
but I feel abandoned!

1147
01:09:23,693 --> 01:09:24,893
Lewis never abandoned you.

1148
01:09:24,895 --> 01:09:27,729
Well, then why am I here
and he's not?

1149
01:09:27,731 --> 01:09:30,398
Oh, really, V, really?

1150
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,468
You're not here in any sense
that I remember.

1151
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:34,602
Lewis was taken,
but then you've gone

1152
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:36,538
and given everything else away.

1153
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:41,876
I was abandoned by whoever I was
praying to all those years.

1154
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:46,514
Why did he let it happen?
Why?

1155
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:50,652
I mean, I have tried, Mike,
I swear to you I have tried

1156
01:09:50,654 --> 01:09:52,720
to believe that
there's a reason.

1157
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:54,556
I mean, there's a reason
for everything, right?

1158
01:09:54,558 --> 01:09:55,857
That's what we're always
telling ourselves, right?

1159
01:09:55,859 --> 01:10:00,395
Well, I can't think but that
maybe the only answer is

1160
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:02,530
that there is no answer!

1161
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:06,834
there's just random chaos
and that's all there is.

1162
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:09,370
Lewis's death was a tragedy,

1163
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:12,507
but God will use it
for a better purpose.

1164
01:10:12,509 --> 01:10:14,275
I believe that, V,
I really do.

1165
01:10:14,277 --> 01:10:16,778
I know.

1166
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:20,848
Now, we can turn away from
this kid or we can turn to him.

1167
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:27,755
I wish I could believe
like you believe.

1168
01:10:32,662 --> 01:10:36,497
It's been a long, long, long,
long road

1169
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:40,301
and I...I really don't know
anymore.

1170
01:10:40,303 --> 01:10:42,737

I just don't know.

He's not saying.

01:11:18,408 --> 01:11:20,375
He got roughed up pretty bad,
though.

1180
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:22,610
Can I see him?

1181

He's resting now
and I'm not so sure

1182
01:11:25,582 --> 01:11:29,884
he'd want you to see him
like that.

1183

No, but he's been in a fight,
got hurt pretty bad.

With all his baggage,
where is he really going?

or someone that has
a relationship with God?

1209
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:06,614
Both. Some kids just
substitute the God thing in

01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:08,916
for whatever else they've
been using or abusing,

01:13:08,918 --> 01:13:12,920
instead of whatever other kind
of crazy they were before.

Brendan's not crazy
and he's not a hypocrite.

(scoffs) You haven't
known him long.

1216
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:24,699
He could just be using you,
using your issues

1217
01:13:24,701 --> 01:13:26,834
and his religion thing
for whatever he wants.

1218
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:29,837
Stop calling it a thing,
a God thing, a religion thing.

1219
01:13:29,839 --> 01:13:32,106
It isn't a thing to him,
it's a way of life,

1220
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:34,942
a way to life when he was
headed for death before.

Sure.

Brendan, you know that house
that you guys were working on?

01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:44,985

Hey.

Look, I didn't mean
to just pop in on you.

1302
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:15,242
I just wanted to know
you're okay.

1303
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:24,985
Here, I got something for you.

1304
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:29,990
It's not a big deal, just saw it
at the mall last week and...

1305
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:41,368
Brendan?

1306
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:47,308
-I can't take this.
-What?

1307
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:51,078
Brendan, we'll find
another house.

1308
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,848
We'll start all over.
I'll talk to student council.

1309
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:58,452
We can still use the auction
to support this.

1310
01:20:58,454 --> 01:21:00,354
If you're trying to scare me,
it's working.

1311
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:02,556
Maybe you should be
scared of me.

1312
01:21:02,558 --> 01:21:06,460
Yeah, well, you would be if
you know what's inside me.

1313
01:21:06,462 --> 01:21:09,196
What does that mean?

1314
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:14,068
Come on, you can
tell me anything.

1315
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,471
Brendan, will you please
say something?

1316
01:21:17,473 --> 01:21:19,139
Why don't you say something?

1317
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:21,041
Say something to Zack,
say something to your mom.

1318
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:22,376
Let them know what
you're dealing with.

1319
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:24,111
They're the ones you should
be concerned about.

1320
01:21:24,113 --> 01:21:26,380
Forget about me, I'm...

1321
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:33,387
You should just go, Natalie.

I put you and Vanessa
in a bad spot, Mike.

1327
01:22:10,493 --> 01:22:14,094
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

1328
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:18,699
I helped a friend bury some
stuff before we got arrested.

1329
01:22:18,701 --> 01:22:22,236
Drugs.

1330
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:24,571
The guys that beat you up,
they know that?

1331
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:27,508
Yeah, and they're gonna
hurt some people

1332
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:31,478
if I don't get it back to them,
people close to me.

1333
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:35,950
Like Sheedy, like the house
that they burned down.

1334
01:22:35,952 --> 01:22:38,085
-Then give it to them.
-It's not that simple, Mike.

1335
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:41,455
If I had it my way I'd let it
stay buried, let it rot,

1336
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:43,324
but they won't let that happen.

1337
01:22:43,326 --> 01:22:47,094
it's out there on the streets
hurting people and ruining lives

1338
01:22:47,096 --> 01:22:51,065
and I won't let that happen.

1339
01:22:51,067 --> 01:22:54,435
That doesn't leave you
many options, does it?

1340
01:22:54,437 --> 01:22:56,403
Only one that I know of.

1341
01:22:56,405 --> 01:22:59,740
Only one because you're only
listening to your own voice.

1342
01:22:59,742 --> 01:23:03,010
You're shutting out God.
Can't you see that?

1343
01:23:03,012 --> 01:23:04,745
Yeah, I did that, too.

1344
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:08,549
When they took away my baby boy,
I turned my back on God,

1345
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:11,151
tried to handle it on my own.

1346
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:12,720
I held my thumb out
for a way out, Mike,

1347
01:23:12,722 --> 01:23:15,255
and it didn't come, okay?

1348
01:23:15,257 --> 01:23:16,657
So now I gotta do this my way.

1349
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:19,093
-It is not too late, Brendan.
-I gotta go, Mike.

1350
01:23:19,095 --> 01:23:22,096
No, no, you wanna make this
a fight of flesh and blood,

1351
01:23:22,098 --> 01:23:23,464
but it's not.

1352
01:23:23,466 --> 01:23:26,433
It's spiritual with the powers
of darkness.

1353
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:30,437
The enemy is afraid of what
you can truly become.

1354
01:23:30,439 --> 01:23:33,340
You need to turn this over
to God right here, right now.

1355
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:36,010
Mike, I gotta go.

1356
01:23:36,012 --> 01:23:37,144
-Put the bag down.
-Mike...

1357
01:23:37,146 --> 01:23:39,079
Put it down!

1358
01:23:39,081 --> 01:23:42,483
Sit down. Sit down!

1359
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:49,323
Trust in the Lord with
all your heart

1360
01:23:49,325 --> 01:23:53,193
and lean not on your
own understanding.

1361
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:54,561
In all your ways, submit to him

1362
01:23:54,563 --> 01:23:57,498
and he will make
your paths straight.

1363
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,633
If you do not stand
firm in your faith,

1364
01:23:59,635 --> 01:24:02,636
you will not stand at all.

1365
01:24:02,638 --> 01:24:06,573
He will fight this fight
for you, son.

1366

I know.

1367
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:13,614
We should talk to Russell.

What can you tell me?

1382
01:25:52,681 --> 01:25:54,381
There's been a van
hanging out here

for the past couple of days,

Look, I told you
this is a bad idea

Russell, the kid's heart is
in the right place.

1387
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:07,261
I've seen inside their hearts,
Mike.

1388

The day I found Lewis
on the side of the road.

1389
01:26:09,465 --> 01:26:10,731
No, no, that's not what it is!

1390
01:26:10,733 --> 01:26:12,666
Yeah, it is.

1391
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:13,667
It's not your fault, Russell.

1392

-What?
-Lewis.

1393

Mike, not Lewis.

I told you once
and I'll tell you again,

1397
01:26:27,449 --> 01:26:29,883
Lewis did not become a cop
because you encouraged him

1398
01:26:29,885 --> 01:26:31,285
or you nudged him.

He became a cop
because he wanted to!

1400

It's not on you, Russell,
and you don't have to make it

You are a brother to us.
